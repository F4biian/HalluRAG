        "content": "The Sanctuary of the Madonna of Monticino, in Italian, Santuario della Madonna del Monticino is a Neoclassical-style, Roman Catholic, sanctuary church located on Via Rontana on a hill-top to the northwest of the center of the town of Brisighella, province of Ravenna, Italy. \n\n\n== Description ==\n\nA church at the site was built to shelter a revered icon of the Madonna and child, that had been previously placed in 1626 in a pillar outside of Porta Bonfante, along a pilgrimage road. The town council in 1662 decided to move the venerated image to a small oratory, atop Monte Cozzolo, also called Monte Calvario, and now called Monticino. In 1758, the oratory was replaced by the present church. In the apse are frescoes by the nineteenth century painter Savino Lega. The icon is now sheltered in a small round frame behind the altar. The church remained unfinished for decades, until in 1926 under the patronage of cardinal Michele Lega, the present facade was added using a design by the architect Edoardo Collamarini. Since 1662, in honor of the Madonna del Monticino, the town holds a fair (sagra).\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Michael Anthony Cox (born May 17, 1956) is an American serial killer and rapist who kidnapped and killed three teenage girls in Placerville, California, between June and August 1984, later burying their bodies in the Eldorado national forest. He was tried, convicted, and sentenced to death in 1985, and is currently awaiting execution.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nCox was born in 1956 in Monterey County, California, the oldest child in a family of seven kids. His biological father split with his mother, Jean Stokes, during her pregnancy, and she later married a man named Forest Jayne. Jayne is suspected to have molested Cox during his adolescence, and in 1969 he drugged and molested a boy in their neighborhood, causing the family to move out of Monterey County to avoid potential prosecution. Later, during a snowstorm, Jayne accidentally drove the family car off a cliff. Cox rescued his mother and one of his little brothers. While she was being treated at a hospital for broken ribs, Cox took care of his siblings. He attended El Dorado High School, where he worked as a student aid in the library. Cox also suffered from epilepsy and an alcohol addiction.\n\n\n== Murders ==\nAfter high school, Cox worked with a youth forestry conservation crew, where he became acquainted with several adolescents, among them were sisters Debbie and Denise Galston, both 14, who lived in a foster home in Placerville. Cox was known to have regularly insulted Denise with derogatory language, often calling her a slut and a hoser. On June 12, 1984, Denise was hanging out with her friends at a nearby Bell Tower, an area that was often used by teeneagers as a hangout spot. Cox was driving in his car nearby and approached 17-year-old Joanna Napoletano, who lived with the Galston's at their foster home. He offered to drive her to a party at a nearby park and she agreed, but when they got there, he made an unwanted sexual move toward Napoletano, grabbing her breast and causing her to flee. She returned downtown, where she pulled Galston aside and spoke with her about the incident with Cox.\nAfterwards, Galston began walking home when she was approached by Cox in his car, again inviting her in to go to a party. She agreed and Cox again approached Napoletano, who reluctantly got it. Afterwards, Cox drove to an underpass and forced both girls out while brandishing a knife. He proceeded to attack Galston and stab her in the throat. During this, Napoletano ran away and flagged down a nearby car. Despite what had happened, she refused to tell anyone what Cox did. After killing Galston, Cox dumped her body in Pollock Pines of the Eldorado National Forest.\nOn June 29, 1984, Cox visited a club in downtown Placerville, where he met a 17-year-old girl named Lynda Burrill. After convincing her to follow him to the parking lot, he kidnapped her and drove her to a secluded location, where he subsequently stabbed her to death. On August 8, Cox kidnapped Debbie Galston, Denise's twin sister, while she was walking to a nearby party. He her under similar circumstances and dumped her body near an oil rig.\n\n\n== Investigation ==\nOn July 31, the partial remains of Denise Galston were found by a logging crew, and just five days later, the remains of Burrill were found. The discovery of the bodies caused a stir among city residents, with investigators concluding a single killer was responsible. By early September, the body of Debbie Galtson had yet to be found, but some of her cloths had been recovered along a highway. Her skeletal remains were eventually found in late October and identified through dental records.\nOn August 12, Cox was sleeping in his car when it was approached by a Placer field police officer. The officer discovered a gun protruding from under the driver's seat and determined it to be a fully loaded .357-caliber Smith and Wesson revolver. Handcuffs were also located in the rear floorboard area and a knife and scabbard were found in the trunk. Afterwards, Cox was interviewed twice as a possible suspect in the murders but denied involvement. After Joanna Napoletano came forward with her information, Cox was arrested on November 10.\n\n\n== Trial and imprisonment ==\nCox was indicted on three murder charges on November 14 and pleaded not guilty in January 1985. His trial in July resulted in a guilty verdict. During the penalty phase, Cox's lawyers attempted to persuade the jury to not impose a death sentence because of his troubled childhood. The jury nevertheless imposed a death sentence on August 7, and he entered San Quentin State Prison later that month.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of serial killers in the United States\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "William Montagu (1720? – 1757) was a British Royal Navy captain and politician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMontagu was the son of Edward Richard Montagu, viscount Hinchinbroke (d. 1722), by Elizabeth, daughter of Alexander Popham of Littlecote, Wiltshire, and younger brother of John Montagu, fourth earl of Sandwich. He was on 20 September 1740 promoted to be lieutenant of the Defiance, one of the ships going out to the West Indies with Sir Chaloner Ogle, and in her was present at the unsuccessful attack on Cartagena in March–April 1741. He was afterwards moved into the Launceston, one of the squadron with Commodore Warren at the Leeward Islands, and by Warren he was promoted, on 23 May 1744, to the command of the Mercury sloop. On the night of 20 October 1744, as the ship was lying at Antigua, a boat prowling round would not answer when hailed. Montagu ordered the sentry to fire at her, and the boat then came alongside with a negro in her, shot through the calf of the leg, who, through the incompetence of the surgeon of the Mercury, bled to death. The surgeon was dismissed the service by sentence of court-martial, but Commodore Knowles, apparently believing that Montagu was to blame for the man's death, suspended him from his command, and sent him under arrest on board the Eltham for a passage to England. Despite Montagu's appeal, Knowles refused either to try him by court-martial or to hand him over to the civil power at Antigua, and Montagu in the Eltham was carried to New England, where, after he had been seven months under arrest, he was promoted by Warren to the post-ship Mermaid on 23 May 1745 (Montagu's petition to the first lord of the admiralty, not dated, read 14 August 1745 in Captain's Letters, M. 11). On arriving in England in August, he vainly petitioned the first lord of the admiralty to try Knowles, who had just returned to England, for his tyrannical conduct. In a civil suit (25 June 1752), however, Montagu was successful. Heavy damages, it is said, would have been awarded, but his counsel only demanded a nominal penalty often guineas and the costs of the suit.\nMeantime he was appointed to the Prince Edward on 20 Augist 1745, and in July 1746 to the Bristol of 50 guns, one of the ships in the squadron under George Anson in the following spring. In the action of 3 May Montagu's conduct was described as extremely brilliant. He closely engaged the 74-gun ship Invincible ; Captain Fincher of the Pembroke, thinking Montagu's little ship was overmatched, tried to push in between her and the Frenchman, but, finding there was not sufficient room, hailed the Bristol to put her helm a starboard or the Pembroke would run foul of her. To which Montagu hailed back, 'Run foul of me and be damned ; neither you nor any man in the world shall come between me and my enemy.' And he stuck to the In- vincible till, with the assistance of the Devonshire, her guns were silenced, when, exclaiming 'Come, my boys, we must have another of them,' he ran his ship alongside the Diamant of 66 guns, which, after a sharp contest, struck to the Bristol (Gent. Mag. 1747, p. 272). The story is told in a letter from Portsmouth, dated 30 May 1747 ; but neither in his official letter to the admiralty, nor in his private letter to the Duke of Bedford, does Anson say anything about it or about Montagu (Barrow, Life of Anson, pp. 162–165 ; Correspondence of John, fourth Duke of Bedford, i. 213–15). As the Invincible finally struck to the Prince George, Anson may very well have preferred not describing her as a beaten ship when the Prince George closed her. The writer in the 'Gentleman's Magazine' attributes his silence to jealousy.\nDuring the rest of the year the Bristol was employed on detached service and independent cruising. On 12 December Montagu fell in with Rear-admiral Boscawen in the Namur off Madeira, and anchored there with him. Boscawen, who had charge of a large convoy of East Indiamen, wrote to Anson on the 21st that he had been obliged to confine Montagu, at the desire of the governor, for threatening the life of one of the captains of the Indiaman (Barrow, p. 160 ; Addit. MS. 15955). The Bristol, he added, was in great want of stores, and was going to Lisbon to refit. It was found necessary for her to go to England, and to be paid off. In September 1748, however, Montagu was appointed to her again; and in January 1749-50 he was moved into the Cumberland, guardship at Chatham. In November 1745 he was returned to parliament for the county of Huntingdon, and in February 1752 for the borough of Bossiney in Cornwall. He died in the early part of 1757.\nMontagu is said to have been known in the navy of his time as 'Mad Montagu,' and several anecdotes are related of his eccentricities. But though Charnock, who tells them, presumably received them from William Locker and from Forbes, it is not altogether improbable that they had been told, before their time, of men of the older navy. Montagu married Charlotte, daughter of Francis Nailour of Offord Darcy in Huntingdonshire, but died without issue (Collins, Peerage, iii. 302).\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1894). \"Montagu, William (1720?-1757)\".

The organisation engages in public outreach and educational programmes with the stated aims of: \n\npreserving and making accessible historical knowledge of Dutch hydraulic engineering;\nmaintaining a repository in both digital and physical forms, and providing access through a website;\nconnecting historical knowledge with contemporary and future challenges in water management, involving students, experts, and knowledge networks in the process.\n\nThe Stichting Blauwe Lijn conducts tours and events, and has published a series of booklets, including 'The Water Gives and Takes', as part of its effort to disseminate information on water management, particularly to its target audience of 8 to 25 year-olds. It also contributed to the unveiling of a statue of Dr. Ir. Johan van Veen in Capelle aan den IJssel.\nThe organisation is recognised by the Dutch Tax Authorities as an Algemeen Nut Beogende Instelling (ANBI) (English: Public Benefit Organisation), meaning that at least 90% of the efforts of the foundation must be focused on the general good.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDelta Works\nZuiderzee Works\nRijkswaterstaat\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website of Stichting Blauwe Lijn (in Dutch)",

        "content": "David Lloyd (died 1714?) was a British Royal Navy captain and Jacobite agent.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nLloyd was in 1672 appointed lieutenant of the Henry. In 1677 he was promoted to be captain of the Mermaid, and during the next three years commanded the Reserve, Dover, and Crown in the Mediterranean. In May 1687 he was appointed to the Sedgemoor. At the time of the revolution he commanded one of the ships under Lord Dartmouth, and having knowledge of the design of some of the captains to seize Dartmouth and deprive him of the command, he discovered it to him, and so caused the plot to fail (Memoirs relating to the Lord Torrington, Camden Soc., p. 32). When the cause of James was lost in England, Lloyd followed him to France, and during the whole of the reign of William III seems to have been actively employed as an agent in the interests of the exiled king. It was through him that the negotiations were carried on with Admiral Russell previous to the battle of Barfleur, and afterwards with the Duke of Marlborough. Both in 1690 and in 1692 he was proclaimed a traitor, and orders were issued for his apprehension. But then and afterwards he escaped the threatened dangers and continued to act as a go-between from James to his partisans in England. After the death of James II he appears to have retired into private life, but continued to reside in France. He is said to have returned to England in 1714. He seems to have died suddenly in 1716. He is described as a man of honest purpose, possessed of a fund of quaint though rough humour.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1893). \"Lloyd, David (d.1714?)\".

        "content": "Francis Liardet (14 June 1798 – 1 March 1863) was a British Royal Navy captain.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nLiardet was the second son of John Liardet by the Lady Perpetue Catherine de Paul de Lamanon d'Albe. He was born at Chelsea, London on 14 June 1798. He entered the navy in 1809, on board the Mercury frigate, with Captain the Hon. Henry Duncan, in the Mediterranean. In March 1810 he was transferred to the Belvidera frigate, with Captain Richard Byron, on the coast of Africa, and afterwards on the North American station, and was slightly wounded in her running fight with and escape from the United States' squadron under Commodore Rodgers on 23 June 1812 (James, Naval Hist. 1860, v. 357; Roosevelt, Naval War of 1812, p. 74). After an active commission the Belvidera was paid off in October 1814, and for the next two years he served in the West Indies on board the Warrior and Forester sloop. After the peace he devoted himself for some time to the study of mathematics and navigation, and in 1819 went a voyage to the East Indies as mate of a merchant ship. In May 1821 Liardet was appointed to the Hyperion of 42 guns, going out to the Cape of Good Hope, and afterwards to the West Indies, where he was moved into the Union schooner, employed in the suppression of piracy, in which service he was severely wounded, 25 July 1823. On 18 March 1824 he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant, and appointed to command the Lion schooner employed in the same service. In her he destroyed several nests of pirates on the coast of Cuba, captured nine of their vessels, some of their prizes, and a slaver. He was first lieutenant of the Procris, attending on the Duke of Clarence, then lord high admiral, in 1827–8, and of the Jaseur at the Cape of Good Hope from 1828 to 1832, in which period he was three times officially reported as having saved life by jumping overboard, once in a sea abounding in sharks (Young, Acts of Gallantry, 1872, pp. 22, 35). From 1833 to 1835 he was first lieutenant of the Snake on the South American station, and from 1835 to 1838 of the Cleopatra frigate with the Hon. Charles Grey. On 28 June 1838 he was promoted to be commander, and in the following January was appointed to the Powerful of 84 guns, carrying the broad pennant of Commodore Napier, as second in command in the Mediterranean, on the coast of Syria, and especially at the bombardment of St. Jean d'Acre. For his services during this time, when he was frequently in actual command of the Powerful, the commodore being employed on shore, Liardet was promoted to post rank 4 November 1840.\nIn the following year he accepted an appointment as agent for the New Zealand Company at Taranaki. He arrived there towards the end of September. On 29 Nov., in expectation of an attack by Māori, he was endeavouring to clear the vent of a rusty old four-pounder when an untimely explosion of the charge destroyed the sight of one eye and seriously injured the other. For several years he was almost totally blind. In February 1842 he left Taranaki for Sydney, whence he returned to England. During his enforced retirement he wrote or dictated ‘Professional Recollections on points of Seamanship, Discipline, &c.,’ 8vo, 1849, and the ‘Midshipman's Companion,’ 12mo, 1851. In January 1856 he was appointed one of the captains of Greenwich Hospital, and he published ‘Friendly Hints to the Young Naval Lieutenant,’ 12mo, 1858. He died in the hospital on 1 March 1863, and was buried in the mausoleum of the old cemetery. A marble bust by T. Milnes is in the Painted Hall.\nIn October 1842 Liardet married Caroline Anne, sister of Sir Edmund Filmer, bart., and widow of Lieutenant John Jervis Gregory, R.N., and had two daughters and a son.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1893). \"Liardet, Francis\".

        "content": "Helperby Hall is a historic building in Brafferton and Helperby, a village in North Yorkshire, in England.\nThe manor house was originally built in 1709, and since 1816 it has been the home of the Milnes Coates family.  In 1889, it was extensively altered, including changes to the facade, and a rear extension.  A northern range was added in 1914, followed in 1923 by an entrance range, with prominent turrets.  The building was grade II listed in 1952.\nThe building is constructed of reddish-brown brick with a floor band, a modillion eaves cornice, and a hipped green slate roof.  There are two storeys and a U-shaped plan, with six bays.  Steps lead to a doorway with Ionic columns, a frieze and a dentilled cornice.  There are two full-height canted bay windows and pedimented dormers, and the other windows are sashes in architraves.  The entrance wing has a Doric portico with a frieze and a segmental pediment, and it is flanked by turrets with onion domes.  To the right is a square tower with a cupola.  Along the street are wrought iron railings, and to the north is a curving coped brick wall.  Inside, the rear staircase is made of oak and is probably 18th century.  In front of the building is a short wall with iron railings and stone piers, while there is a curved brick wall to the north of the property's courtyard.\nThe garden was noted for its mature yew trees in 1923.  In 2021, it was replanted and is marketed as Helperby Walled Garden, for use as a wedding venue.\n\n\n== See also ==\nListed buildings in Brafferton and Helperby\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "James Killigrew (died 1695) was a British Royal Navy captain.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nKilligrew was the son of Henry Killigrew, D.D., and brother of Admiral Henry Killigrew, was appointed lieutenant of the Portsmouth on 5 September 1688. On 11 April 1690 he was promoted to be captain of the Sapphire, was employed in her cruising in the Channel, and in July 1691 captured a large French privateer. In 1692 he commanded the York, in 1693 the Crown, from which he was moved into the Plymouth of 60 guns, and sent with Admiral Russell to the Mediterranean. In January 1694–5 he was cruising to the southward of Sardinia in command of a detached squadron of five ships, when, on the 18th, they sighted two French men-of-war, the Content of 60, and the Trident of 52 guns. In the chase the Plymouth, being far ahead of her consorts, closed with and engaged the enemy. She was much over-matched, and suffered severely. Killigrew and many of his men were killed. But the French ships had been delayed till the other English ships came up, and, being unable to escape, were both captured. They were taken into Messina, and were afterwards added to the English navy. The question was afterwards raised by his brother, the admiral, whether his estate was not entitled to share in the prize-money, and evidence was adduced to the effect that the two French ships were disabled and virtually beaten by the Plymouth's fire. Russell, who was commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean at the time, presided over the admiralty, and he decided that as Killigrew was killed early in the action, and the Plymouth was beaten off by the French ships, the prize-money was payable only to the captains of the Carlisle, Falmouth, and Adventure, which actually took them. Although presumably in accordance with the regulations of the day, such an award now appears unjust.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1892). \"Killigrew, James\".

        "content": "The Siege of Al-Rahba was a military engagement between the invading Ilkhanate Mongols and the Mamluk Al-Rahba garrison. It was the last military engagement of the Mamluk-Ilkhanid War.\nIn 1312, the Mamluk sultan, Al-Nasir Muhammad, began forming his own Mamluk emirs instead of Syrian ones. Having formed 46 new Emirs, he began eliminating the Emirs who had brought him to power. Only two emirs managed to escape the purge: Qaransunqur, governor of Damascus, and al-Afram, governor of Tripoli, who escaped to the Ilkhanate\nterritory with 600 Mamluks. The two Mamluk emirs convinced the Ilkhanate ruler, Öljaitü, to attack the Mamluks, to which he agreed.\nThe Mongol army set out in October from the city of Mosul. Mamluk spies in Baghdad informed of this and went to inform the Mamluk Sultan of the upcoming invasion. The Mongol march was slow, only moving nine miles a day, which allowed the Mamluks to prepare before their arrival. The Mongols arrived at the walls of Al-Rahba castle and began the siege of the castle on December 23, the month of Ramadan.\nThe castle of Al-Rahba was well-supplied, garrisoned, and prepared, led by the governor, Ibn al-Arkashi. The Mongols launched several assaults against the walls, and the Mamluks repelled several of their assaults, causing heavy casualties to the Mongols. The Mongols found themselves in a difficult position; they began running out of provisions and fodder. Mongol sources attribute the failure of the siege to the hot weather. The Mongols raised the siege on January 26 of the next year. They left all of their siege equipment, and the Mamluk garrison marched out and captured them, taking them to the citadel.\nThe Mongols never returned to attack the Mamluks again, instead engaging in diplomacy with the Mamluks. The failure of the siege was part of the crumbling situation of the Ilkhanate. The economy was falling. The Khanate was split into two administrative governments. Öljaitü returned to drinking and would die on December 1316.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nJames Waterson (2022), The Knights of Islam, The Wars of the Mamluks, 1250 - 1517.[1]\nE. J.

It is a part of the Handbook of Oriental Studies series published by Brill.\n\n\n== Volumes ==\n\n\n=== Volume One: 635–1800 ===\nThe first volume covers the history of Christianity in China in the Tang dynasty, the Yuan dynasty, and the period from late Ming dynasty to the middle of the Qing dynasty. It is edited by Nicholas Standaert. In each period, the primary and secondary sources and introduced in the \"Sources\" section, followed by the main figures (\"Actors\"), geographical context (\"Scene\"), and \"Themes\". It was published in 2001.\nThe scholar Ryan Dunch called the first volume a \"monumental work\" that is \"indispensable [...] for decades to come.\" The historian Morris Rossabi echoed on the volume being \"monumental\" and praised its usefulness. The scholar Willard J. Peterson also called the volume \"indispensable\" for researchers.\n\n\n=== Volume Two: 1800–Present ===\nThe second volume covers three periods: \"1800–1911\", \"1911–1949\", and \"1950 To The Present\". It follows the \"Sources\"-\"Actors\"-\"Scene\"-\"Themes\" structure. It is edited by Gary Tiedemann and published in 2009.\nThe religious scholar Chloë Starr recommended the volume, but also noted its imbalances on certain topics and perspectives: according to Starr, there is little on the worship of Chinese churches, Chinese clergy and theologians, and recent developments. The scholar Jonathan A. Seitz praised the book for its ecumenical nature, abundance of sources, and coherent structure.\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n=== Journal articles ===\nDunch, Ryan (Oct 2001). \"Book Review: Handbook of Christianity in China, Vol. 1: 635–1800\".

        "content": "George Matthew Jones (1785? – April 1831) was a British Royal Navy captain and traveler.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nJones brother of General Sir John Thomas Jones, bart. He was in April 1802 promoted to be a lieutenant in the navy. He was appointed to the Amphion, in which, in the following spring, Lord Nelson went out to the Mediterranean, and which, on 5 October 1804, assisted in the capture of the Spanish treasure-ships off Cape St. Mary. In September 1805 Captain Hoste was appointed to the Amphion, and Jones, continuing with him, took part in the peculiarly active service in the Adriatic, distinguishing himself in several of the boat engagements, and being severely wounded on 8 November 1808. On 13 December 1810 he was promoted to command the Tuscan brig, in which, during the next year, he assisted in the defence of Cadiz. In 1817 he commanded the Pandora on the coast of Ireland, and was posted on 7 Dec. 1818. The following years he spent in travelling over Europe with the object of examining the maritime resources of the different countries. He was already well acquainted with the coasts of Spain and Italy; he now visited the ports and arsenals of France and Holland, of the Black Sea, and of the Baltic. In 1827 he published his journals, under the title of ‘Travels in Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia, and Turkey; also on the Coasts of the Sea of Azof and of the Black Sea, &c.,’ 2 vols. 8vo. The work, which he dedicated to Sir William Hoste, by whose advice the travels seem to have been undertaken and the journals kept, is written intelligently, though at excessive length. After its publication Jones's health broke down. He died at Malta in April 1831.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1892). \"Jones, George Matthew\".

        "content": "St Peter's Church is the parish church of Brafferton and Helperby, a village in North Yorkshire, in England.\nThe oldest surviving parts of the church are the chancel and tower, which date from the 15th century.  At the time, the church was dedicated to Saint Augustine, but it was later rededicated to Saint Peter.  The east chapels and arcade of the chancel were added in the 16th century by Ralph Nevill.  Between 1826 and 1831, the nave and east wall of the chancel were rebuilt by James Pigott Pritchett.  The church was restored in 1878, and a vestry was added in 1893.  The building was grade II* listed in 1960.\n\nThe church is built of sandstone, and the chancel has a slate roof.  It consists of a nave wider than it is long, a chancel flanked by chapels, a northeast vestry, and a west tower.  The tower has three stages, stepped angle buttresses, a south doorway, a three-light west window, two-light bell openings, a south clock face, and an embattled parapet.  The nave, chancel and chapels also have embattled parapets.\nInside the church is a font with a 14th-century bowl.  The east window and window of the south chapel have stained glass manufactured by Charles Eamer Kempe.  The north chapel has a 16th-century coat of arms in its stained glass, and also has a stone slab with a carving of a pastoral staff, which may commemorate a Prior of Newburgh.  One of the bells is Mediaeval, and another is dated 1598.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGrade II* listed buildings in North Yorkshire\nListed buildings in Brafferton and Helperby\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sir William Jennens (c. 27 June 1634 – 1704) was a British Royal Navy captain and Jacobite.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nJennens is said by Charnock (Biog. Nav. i. 106) to have belonged to ‘a very respectable family in the county of Hertford,’ a statement probably due to some confusion with Sir John Jennings, who does not appear to have been any relation. Le Neve, who may have had a personal reason, has noted him, though doubtfully, as a younger brother of Sir Robert Jennings of Ripon (Pedigrees of the Knights, Harl. Soc., p. 92); but it has been pointed out (Notes and Queries, 2nd ser. ix. 124) that neither Sir Robert nor Sir William are recognised in Dugdale's ‘Visitation of Yorkshire’ in 1665. All that is certain is that he himself wrote his name ‘Jennens.’ In 1661 he was appointed second lieutenant of the Adventure. In 1664 he was successively lieutenant of the Gloucester and the Portland, and on 11 October was promoted to be captain of the Ruby, one of the white squadron in the battle of 3 June 1665, some time after which he received the honour of knighthood. That the date is not given by Le Neve would seem to imply that he stood on naval privilege, and refused to pay the fees. He still commanded the Ruby in the four-days' fight of 1–4 June 1666, after which he was moved into the Lion, and in her took part in the action of 25 July. At the burning of the Dutch shipping at the Vlie on 8 August, he commanded in the second post under Sir Robert Holmes. Jennens was afterwards appointed to the Sapphire, and in the disastrous summer of 1667 had charge of a division of the small vessels got together for the defence of the Thames. Pepys implies that he was a man of dissolute and profane life (Diary, 20 October 1666), speaks of him as ‘a proud, idle fellow,’ whom he suspected of malpractices (ib. 29 Jan. 1668–9), and says that a complaint he brought against his lieutenant, Le Neve, ‘was a drunken quarrel, where one was as blameable as the other’ (ib. 23 Nov. 1666; cf. Cal. State Papers, Dom., 7 January 1664–5). In 1670 Jennens commanded the Princess, in which he conducted a convoy to the Mediterranean, and on his return was imprisoned in the Marshalsea, ‘only,’ as he wrote, ‘for having his wife on board some part of the late voyage, which was no prejudice to the service’ (State Papers, Dom. Charles II, xlviii. 137–8–9. These petitions are calendared in error under 1661? Calendar 1661–2, p. 232.) The Duke of York would seem to have condoned the offence, and in 1673 Jennens commanded the Victory in the several engagements between Prince Rupert and De Ruyter. He was afterwards captain successively of the Gloucester, the French Ruby, and the Royal James guardship at Portsmouth. In July 1686 he was appointed to the Jersey, also a guardship at Portsmouth; and on 20 February 1687–8 he was tried by court-martial for brawling on shore with Captain Skelton of the Constant Warwick, another guardship. They were each reprimanded and fined nine months' pay (Minutes of the Court-martial). On 5 September 1688 he was, notwithstanding, appointed to the Rupert, which was still fitting out in October, but was probably one of the fleet with Lord Dartmouth in November (cf. Memoirs relating to the Lord Torrington, Camden Soc., pp. 25, 29).\nWhen James II abdicated, Jennens went over to France, and entering the French navy, served in some capacity in it in the action off Beachy Head, 30 June 1690. Charnock says ‘he condescended to become third captain to a French admiral;’ and an intercepted letter to another traitor speaks of him as ‘one of their admirals’ (Alice Teate to her husband, Matthew Teate, 16 July, enclosed in Killigrew's letter of 18 July, in Home Office Records, Admiralty, vol. iv.) The French lists do not acknowledge him in either capacity, and it is more probable that he was serving as a volunteer and pilot on Tourville's staff. Nothing more is known of him.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1892). \"Jennens, William\".

        "content": "Pinoyshki Bakery & Cafe, or simply Pinoyshki, is a restaurant in Seattle, in the U.S. state of Washington. Established in 1994, the bakery previously operated on 3rd Avenue and was known as Piroshki on 3rd (or Piroshki on Third), before rebranding in December 2023 and relocating to Capitol Hill in early 2024. Owned by Aly Anderson since 2016, the bakery has been featured on the Food Network's Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.\n\n\n== Description ==\nPinoyshki operates on the Pine Street side of the Pike Motorworks development, between Harvard and Boylston Avenues on Seattle's Capitol Hill. In 2014, Eater Seattle said the bakery specializes in \"mashups of Filipino empanadas and Russian piroshki\". Originally focusing on Eastern European and Russian piroshki, the menu was later expanded to incorporate Filipino cuisine. Piroshki varieties have included the cornpilog (corned beef hash), atsara (pickled papaya), and asadero (beef). The restaurant has also served borscht, a cheese and kimchi croissant, and chocnut babka. A small dessert called the \"pot of gold\" has chocolate sponge cake with espresso mousse and Irish cream custard.\n\n\n== History ==\nPiroshki on 3rd was established in 1994. Since 2016, the bakery has been owned by Aly Anderson, who expanded the restaurant's menu to reflect her Filipino heritage. Guy Fieri visited to film for the 28th season of the Food Network's Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives (episode \"Tasty Traditions\"), which aired in 2018. Like many restaurants, Piroshki on 3rd operated via delivery and take-out at times during the COVID-19 pandemic. The bakery rebranded in December 2023 and relocated from downtown Seattle to Capitol Hill in 2024.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIn 2019, Hoodline included Piroshki on 3rd in a list of the city's four best Russian eateries, describing it as \"the highest rated Russian restaurant in Seattle, boasting 4.5 stars out of 303 reviews on Yelp\". The website also included Piroshki on 3rd in 2019 lists of five \"favorite spots to find affordable Eastern European food\" and five \"favorite bakeries (that won't break the bank)\", as well as a 2020 overview of four Seattle eateries for inexpensive desserts. Naomi Tomky included Piroshki on 3rd in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer's 2021 overview of the metropolitan area's best \"hidden gem\" bakeries. Eater Seattle writers included Pinoyshki in a 2024 list of 19 \"essential\" Capitol Hill restaurants. \n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of bakeries\nList of Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives episodes\nList of Filipino restaurants\nList of Russian restaurants\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nPiroshki on 3rd (Closed), Food Network\nGarlic Beef Asado \"Pinoyshki\" Piroshki, Food Network\nPelmeni Soup, Food Network\nGuy Fieri Eats Garlic Beef Asado Piroshki – Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives – Food Network on YouTube",

        "content": "Robert Harris (9 July 1809 – 16 January 1865) was a British Royal Navy captain.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHarris son of James Harris of Wittersham Hall, Kent, and, on the mother's side, grandson of Mrs. Trimmer. He was born on 9 July 1809; Sir William Cornwallis Harris was his elder brother. Robert Harris entered the navy in January 1822, and, serving almost continuously in the Mediterranean, was a midshipman of the Euryalus frigate during the little war with Algiers in 1824, and of the Cambrian at the battle of Navarino, 20 October 1827, and when she was wrecked at Carabusa on 31 January 1828. After his return to England early in 1829 he was borne on the books of the Royal George yacht, during which time he was really serving on board the Onyx and Pantaloon, tenders, on the coast of South America, in the West Indies, on the coast of Spain and Portugal, or in the Channel and on the coast of Ireland. On 21 May 1833 he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant, and the following December was appointed to the Excellent, then recently established as a school of gunnery, at Portsmouth, under the command of Captain Thomas Hastings (1790–1870). From her he was appointed in January 1836 to be gunnery-lieutenant of the Melville with Captain Douglas, and, later on, with Richard Saunders Dundas, under whose command he served in China, and was specially promoted to the rank of commander on 8 June 1841 for his services in the Canton river, and particularly at the capture of the Bogue forts on 26 February 1841. During 1842, while on half-pay, he studied at the Royal Naval College at Portsmouth; and from September 1844 to May 1846 commanded the Flying Fish on the west coast of Africa. In March 1848 he was appointed commander of the Ganges in the Channel fleet with Captain Henry Smith, and from her was promoted to the rank of captain on 19 October 1849. In March 1851 he was appointed to the Prince Regent, also in the Channel fleet, as flag-captain to Commodore William Fanshawe Martin, but left her in May 1852 on Martin's being relieved by Rear-admiral Corry. It is interesting to trace these details of his service under such officers as Hastings, Dundas, and Martin, as explaining and illustrating his peculiar fitness for the appointment which he received in January 1854 to the Illustrious, then commissioned as training ship for landsmen entered into the navy, according to a plan of Sir James Graham's, and who consequently became generally known as ‘Jemmy Graham's novices.’ In his discharge of this new and exceptional duty Harris displayed such ability and resource that when, in 1857, it was determined to give effect to a long-mooted scheme for improving the elementary education and training of young officers, the execution of it was entrusted to Harris, in the first instance on board the Illustrious, from which, on 1 Jan. 1859, he and the cadets were moved to the Britannia, then in Portsmouth harbour, but in November 1861 sent to Portland. Harris continued to hold this difficult and important post till October 1862, during which time the system of education of naval cadets took form, and was permanently established on its present basis. He had no further employment, and died at Southsea, 16 January 1865. Harris married in 1843 Priscilla Sophia, daughter of Captain Penruddocke of the Fusilier guards, and left issue a son, Robert Hastings, a captain in the navy, and two daughters.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1891). \"Harris, Robert (1809-1865)\".

        "content": "Martin Bechthold (born 1964) is a German-born academic, architect, and researcher. He is the Kumagai Professor of Architectural Technology at the Harvard Graduate School of Design.His research focuses on the contemporary understanding of material systems, with a particular emphasis on computational techniques, robotics, 3D printing, and environmental psychology.\n\n\n== Education and career ==\nHe earned Diplom-Ingenieur (Architecture) from Rheinisch-Westfälisch-Technische Hochschule (RWTH) Aachen, Germany, in 1991. During that period he was awarded a grant by the German Academic Exchange Service for studies aboard in the United Kingdom; following his degree, he practiced architecture at the offices of Santiago Calatrava in Paris and von Gerkan, Marg & Partners in Hamburg.He later earned a Doctor of Design (DDes) degree from Harvard University Graduate School of Design in 2001.\nHe co-directed the Master in Design Studies Program from 2008 to 2013, and directed the Doctor of Design Program from 2013 to 2020 and again in 2023 at Harvard GSD. From 2015 to 2023, he was the founding co-director of the Master of Design Engineering Program, a collaborative initiative between Harvard GSD and SEAS.\nCurrently, Bechthold holds the position of Kumagai Professor of Architectural Technology and is an Affiliate in Materials Science & Mechanical Engineering at the Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences since 2021. His affiliations extend to the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, where he served as an Associate Faculty from 2014 to 2020.\nBechthold is the founding director of the Materials Processes and Systems (MaP+S) Group and the Laboratory for Design Technologies (LDT) at Harvard, a collaborative research platform that involves multiple GSD professors and over 20 researchers.\n\n\n== Research ==\nIn the early part of his academic career, he intiated research at the intersection of structural design and digital fabrication with a focus on structural shells and folded plate structures. Since 2010 he has researched on customization of architectural ceramics through robotics and 3D printing, and on the development of structural applications for industrially produced ceramic elements.His recent interdisciplinary research brings together designers and scientists to address challenges in two critical areas: the development of new material solutions for performative, low to negative carbon buildings and the quantification of the impact of the built environment on human perception.\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\n\n\n=== Books ===\nSchodek, Daniel; Bechthold, Martin (2013-08-07).

        "content": "Tyrone Maullin (born 8 October 1968) is a former professional rugby union player who played as a lock for Natal Sharks, Swansea and Thames Valley. Born in Durban, South Africa, he moved from Natal to Swansea in 1997, where he was coached by former Sharks teammate John Plumtree. He spent five seasons in South Wales, scoring 19 tries in 134 appearances. In 2000, after playing in a national trial match on 29 January, he was named in the Wales A squad for that season's Six Nations A Championship. He made his debut against France A on the opening weekend, as well as against Italy A and England A in the following two games; he was named in the starting line-up for the fourth game against Scotland A, but investigations surrounding the Grannygate scandal led to the revelation that he had spent the first six months of his time in the UK living in London, and had therefore not spent the requisite 36 months in Wales to make him eligible by residency, leading to him being dropped. He returned to the Wales A squad for the 2001 Six Nations A Championship, playing in the final two matches against France A and Italy A. At the end of the 2001–02 season, he moved to New Zealand, where he played for Fraser Tech in Hamilton, before making nine appearances for the Thames Valley provincial side in the 2003 National Provincial Championship. He made an impactful performance on his debut for Thames Valley in a 35–7 win against Mid Canterbury, but did not do enough to earn selection for the 2004 season.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSwansea RFC profile\nThames Valley RU profile\nProfile at rugbyhistory.co.nz",

        "content": "Richard Griffith (died 7 August 1719) was a British Royal Navy captain.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nGriffith is said by Charnock to have been the son of Richard Griffith, a captain in the navy temp. Charles II. This is extremely doubtful; he seems to have been of humble origin, and of very imperfect education, scarcely able to write. In 1691 he was, it appears, commander of a small merchant ship, or pink, which was captured by a French privateer, and which he recaptured in the night with the aid of a boy; clapping on the hatches, it is said, and overpowering and throwing overboard the sleeping watch. For this exploit he was ordered by their majesties a gold chain and medal, and appointed captain of the Mary galley, 22 April 1692. The boy also received a medal (Griffith to Burchett, 14 June 1701; Admiralty Minute, 2 December 1692). At La Hogue the Mary galley was tender to the admiral, and ‘was sent the first express to the queen with the news of beating and burning the enemy's ships, for which,’ wrote Griffith nine years afterwards, ‘her majesty ordered me a royal bounty of 300l., which as yet I have not received.’ He was then employed in convoy service to Newfoundland and to Lisbon, in cruising on the coast of France for intelligence, and at the bombardment of St. Malo with Benbow, after which he was sent into the Mediterranean, and early in 1695, being then at Cagliari, was ordered by Russell to go to Messina, to take command of the Trident, a French ship of 54 guns, which, together with the Content, had lately been captured by an English squadron. After bringing the Trident to England, and some months spent in convoy service, Griffith, still in the Trident, was, early in 1697, ordered out to the West Indies in the squadron which joined Vice-admiral John Nevell at Barbadoes, and met. M. de Pointis off Cartagena on 28–9 May. According to Griffith's account the Trident was the only ship engaged ; and she, being the weathermost ship, was for some time surrounded by the enemy and might have been taken, had they not been more intent on getting clearoff with the spoils of Cartagena. She was afterwards one of the squadron under Rear-admiral Meese which sacked Petit-Goave; was with Nevell off Havana, and accompanied him to Virginia, whence, after the vice-admiral's death, she returned to England. Early in the voyage the ship lost her rudder; she was very weak-handed, many of her men sick, and thus, one dark night in November, as she made the coast of Ireland, she struck on a rock, and was for some time in imminent danger. ‘Not knowing where we were,’ wrote Griffith, ‘and having no boat or any other ways of saving a man, I thought I could not do too much to save the king's ship and all our lives; and then, with my cane in one hand, and a case knife in the other, to cut down their hammocks, did rouse up as many men as I could, and with God's assistance got her off, and next day into Baltimore, and after to Spithead.’ There a complaint was laid against him for, among other things, not ‘carrying a due discipline in his majesty's ship, for beating the officers, and for running up and down the deck with a case knife in his hand,’ and, being tried on these charges, was found guilty and suspended during the pleasure of the admiralty. During the peace he took command of a merchant ship to the Mediterranean, and in the beginning of 1702, his suspension having been taken off, he was appointed to the Bridgwater, which he commanded on the coast of Ireland and in the Irish Sea for the next three years. During 1705 he was employed on impress service, and in the beginning of 1706 was appointed to the Swiftsure, in which, in company with the Warspite, he sailed from Plymouth on 19 February 1706–7, in charge of a convoy of thirty-three merchant ships bound for Lisbon. On 22 February they fell in with a squadron of seventeen French ships of war, many of them large; and Griffith, after consulting his officers, decided that it was hopeless to resist such an enormous superiority of force. The convoy crowded sail and made off before the wind, scattering as they went. Many of the merchant ships were captured, but the rest and the two men-of-war got safely to Lisbon. It is stated by Charnock that Griffith's conduct on this occasion was inquired into by a court-martial held at Lisbon. There is no official record of any such court-martial; and probably an explanation to the admiral, Sir George Byng, was all that was called for. In any case, he was held free from blame; and, in the Swiftsure, went on to Gibraltar, and thence into the Mediterranean, where he joined the fleet under Sir Clowdisley Shovell, and took part in the operations at Toulon; returning to England in October, when the Association and other ships of the fleet were lost among the Scilly Islands (Swiftsure's Log). During the winter Griffith had temporarily command of the Essex, cruising in the Channel with Sir John Leake, but in February resumed the command of the Swiftsure, in which he was stationed as senior officer in the Downs. On 25 March 1708, being off Dunkirk with a squadron of four ships of the line, they sighted an enemy's squadron of fourteen sail, one with an admiral's flag at the main. ‘They drew into line of battle, and by reason of their number and strength, we kept our wind, and in the night lost sight of them’ (Griffith to Burchett, 26 March). The next day the squadron returned to the Downs in order to report the affair to the prince; but some weeks after, in consequence of a letter which was published in the ‘Gazette’ (25-9 April), Griffith was ordered to be tried by court-martial. He was tried accordingly on 10 May, and, on a full examination into the circumstances, was acquitted, ‘the matter of fact contained in the letter’ being pronounced ‘false and groundless’ (Minutes of the Court-Martial). Griffith continued in the Swiftsure till July, when he was appointed to the Captain, in which, the following April, he took out a convoy to Lisbon, and went thence to the Mediterranean with Sir John Jennings.\nOn his return to England in the summer of 1710 he was appointed to the Boyne, which he commanded on the home station and in the Mediterranean for the next three years. He had no further service, and died on 7 Aug. 1719. Nothing is known of his family.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1890). \"Griffith, Richard (d.1719)\".

        "content": "The March of Return is an annual protest march in Israel organized by the Association for the Defence of the Rights of the Displaced (ADRID), also known as the Committee of the Uprooted, which represents the \"Present absentees\", i.e. the Palestinian citizens of Israel who are internally displaced. The march takes place annually on or around Nakba Day or Land Day, with a different destination each year – each year one of the c.400 depopulated Palestinian villages in Israel is chosen.\n\n\n== Description and History ==\nThe march traces its origins to the early 1980s when hundreds of Palestinian Israelis marched to commemorate their expulsion from Kafr Bir'im, gradually institutionalizing the practice of private family visits to destroyed villages. The march intersects with the tradition of Land Day commemoration, following the 1976 land confiscations, which diversified in the 1980s to include organized visits to depopulated villages.The Committee of the Uprooted first organized a Land Day rally in the depopulated village of Al-Ghabisiyya in 1995. In 1998, they named their annual event a \"March of Return\", beginning a tradition of a mass march to different depopulated villages each year on Nakba Day. The event's secular character, with mixed-gender participation, dabka dancing, and secular music, contrasts with the Palestinian Israeli Islamist factions' more reserved attitude. The marches have been unified, peaceful festivals, contrasting with Nakba Day events in the West Bank that have been marked by confrontations and violence against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank.The Committee of the Uprooted orchestrates the marches in conjunction with Israeli authorities, aiming to avoid provocation and maintain positive relations with Israeli Jewish communities. Efforts include discipline in protest expressions, careful route planning to avoid conflicts with Jewish localities, and refraining from marching to certain villages. Jewish participation, including speakers and organizational involvement, has been consistently maintained, though it remains a largely Palestinian-led initiative.\n\n\n== Destinations and attendance ==\nThe list below summarizes the destinations of the marches, and where known, the attendance:\n2023: Lajjun\n2022: Mi'ar\n2021: Al-Dumun (mostly online due to Covid)\n2019: Khubbayza2018: Atlit\n2017: Al-Kabri, initially 25,000 attendees expected and blocked by Israeli government.

        "content": "Golf clubs, in the context of establishments, refer to venues that encompass golf courses and often additional facilities such as clubhouses, dining areas, pro shops, and golf practice ranges. These clubs can range from public access courses, where anyone can play for a fee, to private clubs with restricted membership and exclusive access.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe concept of golf clubs dates back to the 15th century in Scotland, with the establishment of the Old Course at St. Andrews in 1552 being one of the earliest known instances. The formal organization of golf clubs began in the 18th century, with The Royal Burgess Golfing Society which holds claim to being the oldest golf society in the world. Additionally, the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, founded in 1744, is also often cited as the oldest golf club. Initially, these clubs were exclusive gatherings of the elite, but over time, they evolved to cater to a broader segment of society.\n\n\n=== Role in golf development ===\nGolf clubs play a crucial role in the social and professional development of the sport by providing venues for competition, fostering talent through access to high-quality coaching and junior programs, and contributing to the game's governance through adherence to rules and handicapping systems.\n\n\n== Types of clubs and memberships ==\nGolf clubs are primarily categorized into private, semi-private, and public clubs.\n\nPrivate Golf Clubs often require an invitation for membership and often have initiation fees and dues. Access to the course and club facilities is restricted to members and their guests.\nSemi-Private Golf Clubs offer memberships and also allow non-members to play for a fee (\"greenfee\"), providing a blend of exclusivity and public access.\nPublic Golf Clubs are open to anyone who pays the green fee, making them the most accessible type of golf club.\n\n\n=== Membership models ===\nMembership models vary widely among golf clubs, from equity memberships where members own a share of the club, to non-equity models where members pay fees for access without owning a stake. Some clubs offer lifetime memberships, while others operate on an annual renewal basis. Additional categories, such as junior, senior, and corporate memberships, cater to specific demographics.\n\n\n=== Facilities and services ===\nBeyond the golf course, clubs may offer a range of facilities and services, including:\n\nClubhouses: Serving as the hub for social and administrative activities, featuring dining areas, locker rooms, and meeting spaces.\nPro Shops: Retail outlets offering golf equipment, apparel, and accessories.\nPractice Ranges: Areas designated for practicing shots, which may include driving ranges, putting greens, and chipping areas.\nInstructors: Professional instruction and coaching for members to improve their game.\n\n\n==== Events and tournaments ====\nMany golf clubs host tournaments and other golfing events. These can range from casual social events to highly competitive tournaments. Some clubs have resident professionals who provide instruction and organize club tournaments.\n\n\n== Famous golf clubs ==\nSome of the world's most renowned golf clubs include Augusta National Golf Club, St. Andrews Links, Pebble Beach Golf Links, TPC Sawgrass and Royal Melbourne Golf Club. These clubs are celebrated for their rich histories, championship courses, and exclusive memberships.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "During the Israel–Hamas war, the Israel Defense Force (IDF) used artificial intelligence tools that could rapidly and automatically perform much of the process of determining what to bomb. Israel greatly expanded the bombing of the Gaza Strip, which in previous wars had been limited by the Israeli Air Force running out of targets.\nThese tools included the Gospel, an AI which was thought to automatically review surveillance data looking for buildings, equipment and people likely belonging to the enemy, and upon finding them, automatically propose a targeting recommendation for a human analyst to decide whether to pass it along to the field. Another was Lavender, an \"AI-powered database\" which listed tens of thousands of Palestinian men linked by AI to Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and which was used for target recommendation.\n\n\n== The Gospel ==\nIsrael used an AI system dubbed \"Habsora\", \"the Gospel\", to determine which targets the Israeli Air Force would bomb. It automatically provides a targeting recommendation to a human analyst, who decides whether to pass it along to soldiers in the field. The recommendations can be anything from individual fighters, rocket launchers, Hamas command posts, to private homes of suspected Hamas or Islamic Jihad members.\nAI can process intel far faster than humans. Aviv Kohavi, head of the IDF until 2023, stated that the system could produce 100 bombing targets in Gaza a day, with real-time recommendations which ones to attack, where human analysts might produce 50 a year. A lecturer interviewed by NPR estimated these figures as 50–100 targets in 300 days for 20 intelligence officers, and 200 targets within 10–12 days for the Gospel.\n\n\n=== Technological background ===\nArtificial intelligences, despite the name, are not capable of thought or consciousness. Instead, they are machines developed to automate tasks humans accomplish with intelligence through other means. The Gospel uses machine learning, where an AI is tasked with identifying commonalities in vast amounts of data (e.g. scans of cancerous tissue, photos of a facial expression, surveillance of Hamas members identified by human analysts), then looking for those commonalities in new material.\nWhat information the Gospel uses is not known, but it is thought to combine surveillance data from diverse sources in enormous amounts.\nRecommendations are based on pattern-matching. A person with enough similarities to other people labeled as enemy combatants may be labelled a combatant themselves.\nRegarding the suitability of AIs for the task, NPR cited Heidy Khlaaf, engineering director of AI Assurance at the technology security firm Trail of Bits, as saying \"AI algorithms are notoriously flawed with high error rates observed across applications that require precision, accuracy, and safety.\" Bianca Baggiarini, lecturer at the Australian National University's Strategic and Defence Studies Centre wrote AIs are \"more effective in predictable environments where concepts are objective, reasonably stable, and internally consistent.\" She contrasted this with telling the difference between a combatant and noncombatant, which even humans frequently can't do.\nKhlaaf went on to point out that such a system's decisions depend entirely on the data it's trained on, and are not based on reasoning, factual evidence or causation, but solely on statistical probability.\n\n\n=== Operation ===\nThe IAF ran out of targets to strike in the 2014 war and 2021 crisis. In an interview on France 24, investigative journalist Yuval Abraham of the left-wing +972 Magazine stated that to maintain military pressure, and due to political pressure to continue the war, the military would bomb the same places twice. Since then, the integration of AI tools has significantly sped up the selection of targets. In early November, the IDF stated more than 12,000 targets in Gaza had been identified by the target administration division that uses the Gospel. NPR wrote on December 14 that it was unclear how many targets from the Gospel had been acted upon, but that the Israeli military said it was currently striking as many as 250 targets a day. The bombing, too, has intensified to what the December 14 article called an astonishing pace: the Israeli military stated at the time it had struck more than 22,000 targets inside Gaza, at a daily rate more than double that of the 2021 conflict, more than 3,500 of them since the collapse of the truce on December 1. Early in the offensive the head of the Air Force stated his forces only struck military targets, but added: \"We are not being surgical.\"\nOnce a recommendation is accepted another AI, Fire Factory, cuts assembling the attack down from hours to minutes by calculating munition loads, prioritizing and assigning targets to aircraft and drones, and proposing a schedule, according to a pre-war Bloomberg article that described such AI tools as tailored for a military confrontation and proxy war with Iran.\nOne change that The Guardian noted is that since senior Hamas leaders disappear into tunnels at the start of an offensive, systems such as the Gospel have allowed the IDF to locate and attack a much larger pool of more junior Hamas operatives. It cited an official who worked on targeting decisions in previous Gaza operations as saying that while the homes of junior Hamas members had previously not been targeted for bombing, the official believes the houses of suspected Hamas operatives were now targeted regardless of rank. In the France 24 interview Abraham, of +972 Magazine, characterized this as enabling the systematization of dropping a 2000 lb bomb into a home to kill one person and everybody around them, something that had previously been done to a very small group of senior Hamas leaders. NPR cited a report by +972 Magazine and its sister publication Local Call as asserting the system is being used to manufacture targets so that Israeli military forces can continue to bombard Gaza at an enormous rate, punishing the general Palestinian population. NPR noted it had not verified this; it was unclear how many targets are being generated by AI alone; but there'd been a substantial increase in targeting, with an enormous civilian toll.\nIn principle, the combination of a computer's speed to identify opportunities and a human's judgment to evaluate them can enable more precise attacks and fewer civilian casualties. Israeli military and media have emphasized the minimized harm to non-combatants. Richard Moyes, researcher and head of the NGO Article 36, pointed to \"the widespread flattening of an urban area with heavy explosive weapons\" to question these claims, while Lucy Suchman, professor emeritus at Lancaster University, described the bombing as \"aimed at maximum devastation of the Gaza Strip\".\nThe Guardian wrote that when a strike was authorized on private homes of those identified as Hamas or Islamic Jihad operatives, target researchers knew in advance the expected number of civilians killed, each target had a file containing a collateral damage score stipulating how many civilians were likely to be killed in a strike, and according to a senior Israeli military source, operatives use a \"very accurate\" measurement of the rate of civilians evacuating a building shortly before a strike. “We use an algorithm to evaluate how many civilians are remaining. It gives us a green, yellow, red, like a traffic signal.”\n\n\n==== 2021 use ====\nKohavi compared the target division using the Gospel to a machine and stated that once the machine was activated in the war of May 2021 it generated 100 targets a day, with half of them being attacked, in contrast with 50 targets in Gaza per year beforehand. Approximately 200 targets came from the Gospel out of the 1,500 targets Israel struck in Gaza in the war, including both static and moving likely targets according to the military.\nThe Jewish Institute for National Security of America's after action report identified an issue, stating [page 31] the system had data on what was a target, but lacked data on what wasn't. The system depends entirely on training data, and intel that human analysts had examined and deemed didn't constitute a target had been discarded, risking bias. The vice president expressed his hopes this had since been rectified.\n\n\n=== Organization ===\nThe Gospel is used by the military's target administration division (or Directorate of Targets or Targeting Directorate), which was formed in 2019 in the IDF's intelligence directorate to address the air force running out of targets to bomb, and which Kohavi described as \"powered by AI capabilities\" and including hundreds of officers of soldiers. In addition to its wartime role, The Guardian wrote it'd helped the IDF build a database of between 30,000 and 40,000 suspected militants in recent years, and that systems such as the Gospel had played a critical role in building lists of individuals authorized to be assassinated.\nThe Gospel was developed by Unit 8200 of the Israeli Intelligence Corps.\n\n\n=== Ethical ramifications ===\nExperts in AI and international humanitarian law identified several topics of concern.\n\n\n==== Limits of human review ====\nThe Guardian cited Moyes as saying a commander who's handed a computer-generated list of targets may not know how the list was generated or be able to question the targeting recommendations, and is in danger of losing the ability to meaningfully consider the risk of civilian harm.\nIn an opinion piece in Le Monde, reporter Élise Vincent wrote that automated weapons are divided into fully automated systems, which aren't really on the market, and lethal autonomous weapons, which in principle allow human control, and that this division allows Israel to claim the Gospel falls on the side of the more appropriate use of force. She cited Laure de Roucy-Rochegonde, a researcher at Institut français des relations internationales, as saying the war could obsolete these blurred categories and invigorate a stricter regulatory definition, significant human control, which human rights activists including Article 36 have been trying to advocate. She quoted de Roucy-Rochegonde as saying it's not known what kind of algorithm the Israeli army uses, or how the data has been aggregated, which wouldn't be a problem if they didn't lead to a life-or-death decision.\n\n\n==== Due care ====\nDr. Marta Bo, researcher at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, noted that the humans in human-in-the-loop risk \"automation bias\": overreliance on systems, giving those systems too much influence over decisions that need to be made by humans.\nSuchman observed that the huge volume of targets is likely putting pressure on the human reviewers, saying that \"in the face of this kind of acceleration, those reviews become more and more constrained in terms of what kind of judgment people can actually exercise.\" Tal Mimran, lecturer at Hebrew University in Jerusalem who's previously worked with the government on targeting, added that pressure will make analysts more likely to accept the AI's targeting recommendations, whether they are correct, and they may be tempted to make life easier for themselves by going along with the machine's recommendations, which could create a \"whole new level of problems\" if the machine is systematically misidentifying targets.\n\n\n==== Accountability ====\nKhlaaf noted the difficulty of pursuing accountability when AIs are involved. Humans retain the culpability, but who's responsible if the targeting system fails, and it's impossible to trace the failure to any one mistake by one person? The NPR article went on: \"Is it the analyst who accepted the AI recommendation? The programmers who made the system? The intelligence officers who gathered the training data?\"\n\n\n== Lavender ==\nThe Guardian defined Lavender as an AI-powered database, according to six intelligence officers' testimonies given to +972 Magazine/Local Call and shared with The Guardian. The six said Lavender had played a central role in the war, rapidly processing data to identify potential junior operatives to target, at one point listing as many as 37,000 Palestinian men linked by AI to Hamas or PIJ. The details of Lavender's operation or how it comes to its conclusions are not included in accounts published by +972/Local Call, but after a sample of the list was found to have a 90% accuracy rate, the IDF approved Lavender's sweeping use for recommending targets. According to the officers it was used alongside the Gospel, which targeted buildings and structures instead of individuals.\nCiting multiple sources, the Guardian wrote that in previous wars identifying someone as a target would be discussed and then signed off by a legal adviser, and that, after 7 October, the process was dramatically accelerated, there was pressure for more targets, and to meet the demand, the IDF came to rely heavily on Lavender for a database of individuals judged to have the characteristics of a PIJ or Hamas militant. The Guardian quoted one source: “I would invest 20 seconds for each target at this stage, and do dozens of them every day. I had zero added-value as a human, apart from being a stamp of approval. It saved a lot of time.” A source who justified the use of Lavender to help identify low-ranking targets said that in wartime there's no time to carefully incriminate [identify as a legitimate target] every target and you don't want to invest manpower and time in a junior militant, but instead take the margin of error of using AI.\nThe IDF issued a statement that some of the claims portrayed are baseless while others reflect a flawed understanding of IDF directives and international law, and that the IDF does not use an AI system that identifies terrorist operatives or tries to predict whether a person is a terrorist. Information systems are merely one of the types of tools that help analysts gather and optimally analyze intelligence from various sources for the process of identifying military targets, and according to IDF directives, analysts must conduct independent examinations to verify the targets meet the relevant definitions in accordance with international law and the additional restrictions of the IDF directives.\nThe statement went on to say the \"system\" in question is not a system, nor a list of confirmed military operatives eligible to attack, only a database to cross-reference intelligence sources in order to produce up-to-date layers of information on the military operatives of terrorist organizations.\n\n\n=== Allegations of bombing homes ===\nThe Guardian cited the intelligence officers' testimonies published by +972 and Local Call as saying Palestinian men linked to Hamas's military wing were considered potential targets regardless of rank or importance, and low-ranking Hamas and PLJ members would be preferentially targeted at home, with one saying the system was built to look for them in these situations when attacking would be much easier. Two of the sources said attacks on low-ranking militants were typically carried out with dumb bombs, destroying entire homes and killing everyone there, with one saying you don't want to waste expensive bombs that are in short supply on unimportant people. Citing unnamed conflict experts, the Guardian wrote that if Israel has been using dumb bombs to flatten the homes of thousands of Palestinians who were linked with AI assistance to militant groups in Gaza, it could help explain what the newspaper called the shockingly high death toll of the war.\nThe IDF's response to the publication of the testimonies said that unlike Hamas, it is committed to international law and only strikes military targets and military operatives, does so in accordance to proportionality and precautions, and thoroughly examines and investigates exceptions; that a member of an organized armed group or a direct participant in hostilities is a lawful target under international humanitarian law and the policy of all law-abiding countries; that it \"makes various efforts to reduce harm to civilians to the extent feasible in the operational circumstances ruling at the time of the strike\"; that it chooses the proper munition in accordance with operational and humanitarian considerations; that aerial munitions without an integrated precision-guide kit are developed militaries' standard weaponry; that onboard aircraft systems used by trained pilots ensure high precision of such weapons; and that the clear majority of munitions it uses are precision-guided.\n\n\n=== Allegations of pre-authorised civilian kill limits ===\nAccording to the testimonies, the IDF imposed pre-authorised limits on how many civilians it permitted killing in order to kill one Hamas militant. The Guardian cited +972 and Local Call on how this number was over 100 for top-ranking Hamas officials, with one of the sources saying there was a calculation for how many civilians could be killed for a brigade commander, how many for a battalion commander, and so on. One of the officers said that for junior militants, this number was 15 on the first week of the war, and at one point was as low as five. Another said it had been as high as 20 uninvolved civilians for one operative, regardless of rank, military importance, or age. The Guardian wrote that experts in international humanitarian law who spoke to the newspaper expressed alarm.\nThe IDF's response said that IDF procedures require assessing the anticipated military advantage and collateral damage for each target, that such assessments are made individually, not categorically, that the EDF doesn't carry out strikes when the collateral damage is excessive relative to the military advantage, and that the IDF outright rejects the claim regarding any policy to kill tens of thousands of people in their homes.\n\n\n== Reactions ==\nUnited Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, said he’s “deeply troubled” by reports that Israel used artificial intelligence in its military campaign in Gaza, saying the practice puts civilians at risk and blurs accountability. Speaking about the Lavender system, Marc Owen Jones, a professor at Hamad Bin Khalifa University stated, \"Let’s be clear: This is an AI-assisted genocide, and going forward, there needs to be a call for a moratorium on the use of AI in the war\". Ben Saul, a United Nations special rapporteur, stated that if reports about Israel's use of AI were true, then \"many Israeli strikes in Gaza would constitute the war crimes of launching disproportionate attacks\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nIntelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance\nLethal autonomous weapon\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Greg Gigantino (born c. 1955) is an American college football coach. He is the defensive coordinator for Massachusetts Maritime Academy, a position he has held since 2024. He was the head football coach for Iona College—now known as Iona University—in 1984.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\nGigantino grew up in Edison, New Jersey. He attended and played high school football for J. P. Stevens High School alongside his older brother Art. Upon his high school graduation he attended Wagner. He played linebacker for the Seahawks football team.Gigantino graduated from Wagner in 1977.\n\n\n== Coaching career ==\nIn 1977, following Gigantino's graduation he was named the wide receivers coach for IUP under head coach Bill Neal. He also helped coach the offense on the freshman team.In 1978, Gigantino joined Rutgers as a part-time graduate assistant coach under head coach Frank R. Burns. In his first year he worked with the wide receivers and tight ends before working with the defensive ends and outside linebackers in 1979. In 1980, Burns hired Gigantino as a full-time coach in charge of the centers and assisted in recruiting, specifically in Central Jersey. After one seasons his role expanded further and he was named defensive line coach. He was fired alongside Burns after finishing the 1983 with a 3–8 record.In 1984, Gigantino was named the head football coach for Iona. He was the successor to Brian Colleary who resigned following the 1983 season. He finished the 1984 season with a record of 2–8 as the Gaels competed as a NCAA Division III independent. The team's two wins came against Marist, 21–0, and at Pace, 34–14. The team's worst loss game against Norwich at home in the eighth week of the season as they lost 13–62. On the year they were outscored 193 to 362. He resigned after only one season as head coach following the 1984 season.In 1985, Gigantino was named as the special teams coordinator and defensive line coach for Davidson under first-year head coach Vic Gatto. In 1986, he retained his role as special teams coordinator but moved to coaching the inside linebackers. 1988, he returned to his original roles; restoring his position as defensive line coach.In 1989, Gigantino was named the linebackers coach for Lehigh under head coach Hank Small. He also served as the academic coordinator. He resigned following only one season.After just one season with Lehigh, Gigantino was named the defensive coordinator for Hofstra under first-year head coach Joe Gardi. In his first season as defensive coordinator he helped lead the Flying Dutchmen to a 12–1 record and a trip to the NCAA Division III semifinal. In 1996, Gigantino was promoted to assistant head coach. He helped lead the defense to only allow 12.5 points per game, which was good enough for sixth in the nation that same year. He was crucial in the recruitment of quarterback Giovanni Carmazzi who went on to be drafted into the National Football League (NFL). In his last season he was a part of the 9–3 team that made the NCAA Division I-AA playoffs. He resigned following the 1997 season.In 1998, Gigantino was named defensive coordinator and linebackers coach for Cornell under first-year head coach Pete Mangurian. He joined Cornell in hopes to help him pursue his goal of coaching in the NFL despite being deemed a lateral move. He wanted to work under head coach Mangurian because of Mangurian's ties to the NFL as he worked under Dan Reeves for the Denver Broncos, New York Giants, and Atlanta Falcons. After one season he was promoted and added the title of assistant head coach alongside his other positions. In his first season with his new role he helped lead the team to a 7–3 record which was their best season since 1992. He was fired following the 2000 season.In 2001, Gigantino returned to Hofstra, again under Joe Gardi. He was initially hired as the defensive backs coach, but defensive coordinator Dan Quinn took a job with the San Francisco 49ers before the start of the season. With Quinn's departure, Gigantino was named defensive coordinator for his second stint. After one season he added the title of associate head coach in 2002. During the 2002 season, while head coach Gardi was on the disabled list, Gigantino served as the acting head coach and led the Pride to two victories. Gardi and Gigantino's last season at Hofstra were both in 2005 and concluded with a 7–4 record.\nIn 2006, Gigantino was hired as the linebackers coach for Bryant under head coach Marty Fine. In 2007, he was promoted to defensive coordinator alongside retaining his previous responsibility. In his first two season in 2006 and 2007 he helped lead the team to back-to-back Northeast-10 Conference (NE-10) titles and back-to-back NCAA Division II playoffs. He was fired following the 2016 season.\nIn 2016, Gigantino took his first high school coaching role as the linebackers coach for Mater Dei High School. He held the position until 2018.\nIn 2019, Gigantino returned to college coaching and was named defensive line coach for Bethany (WV) under head coach Bill Garvey. He was retained in 2022 after Garvey was fired and Brandon Robinson was named the new head coach.\nIn 2024, Gigantino accepted his fifth stint as a defensive coordinator, this time for Massachusetts Maritime under head coach Jeremy Cameron.\n\n\n== Head coaching record ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMassachusetts Maritime profile\nBethany (WV) profile\nBryant profile",

        "content": "Felix Albrecht Harta né Felix Hirsch (July 2, 1884 – November 27, 1967) was an Austrian portrait and landscape painter and graphic artist. He was a central figure in Austrian Expressionism as evidenced by his inclusion in such exhibitions \"Faistauer, Schiele, Harta & Co: Malerei verbindet\" (Faistauer, Schiele, Harta & Co: Painting Unites Us), curated jointly by Vienna's Österreichische Galerie Belvedere and the Salzburg Museum in 2019.\nHarta was born in Budapest, the son of Theresia and Moritz Hirsch, but changed his surname later in life. He grew up in Vienna where he studied architecture at the Technische Hochschule. In 1905, he went to Munich  and switched to painting, studying under Hugo von Habermann at his academy in Dachau. Several years of copying old masters and study trips to Belgium, France, Italy, and Spain followed, with his first exhibition in 1908 at the Salon d'Automne in Paris. He returned to Vienna and served in World War I, after which he lived in Salzburg. He exhibited and received honors in many European cities and lived and taught in England from 1939 to 1950. He returned to Salzburg in his final years., \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nweb site curated by the artist's grandson, www.faharta.com\nrelevant works in the  catalog of the German National Library",

Vorscheck Athletic Complex, it is the home of the Mercyhurst Lakers field hockey, football, lacrosse and marching band programs.  It also serves as home to the Erie Express semi-professional football team and the Erie Commodores FC soccer team in the National Premier Soccer League and United Women's Soccer.\n\n\n== History ==\nSince the program's inception in 1981, Mercyhurst football had played their home games at Erie Veterans Memorial Stadium.  However, when the venue was unavailable for the 1996 season, Mercyhurst officials decided this was the time to accomplish their long-term vision of an on-campus football stadium, thereby building Saxon Stadium.\n\n\n=== Naming ===\nThe stadium is named after John and Patty Saxon, whose significant contribution to the university athletic program and stadium renovations gained them the naming rights.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Teun de Kruif (born 3 September 1993), known professionally as Tantu Beats, is a Dutch record producer, DJ and lyricist. He is mainly known for his work with Joost Klein. In addition to his work with other artists, he also produces and sells individual beats himself. De Kruif also co-produced Klein's song \"Europapa\", which is set to represent the Netherlands in the Eurovision Song Contest 2024.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nDe Kruif was a fanatical skateboarder, but when he could no longer skate due to a knee injury at the age of fourteen, he decided to make hip-hop beats in FL Studio. In 2009, De Kruif started uploading beats to the internet, including YouTube and Myspace. In 2010, he and a friend started a website where he sold beats under a non-exclusive license.\nAfter completing his pre-university education, De Kruif initially chose to study communication sciences in Amsterdam, but he soon realized that this was not his passion. He ultimately chose Music and Technology at the Utrecht School of the Arts (HKU). In 2014 he started making music full-time and took preparatory training at the HKU in the evening, after which he was admitted to the full course. Although his company had been successful since 2012, he still wanted to pursue relevant studies to broaden his technical knowledge.\nIn 2017, De Kruif interned at BeatStars, an American music licensing platform based in Austin, Texas. In January 2018, he received a message from Italian rapper Gemitaiz who wanted to buy a beat from him. This was for the song Questa Qua. At the end of April of that year, the album debuted at number one on the Italian album top 100. He initially produced his beats from a student room in Zuilen, but moved to Berlin in 2021.\nDe Kruif is a collaborator of Joost Klein and has produced several albums with him. Their collaboration contributed to the revival of gabber-pop with songs such as \"Droom groot\", \"Friesenjung\", and the Dutch entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2024, \"Europapa\". He has also produced for Higher Brothers, bbno$, Paulo Londra, Cosculluela, Tai Verdes, S10 and Merol, among others.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

A-Mei was the spokesperson for Sprite Asia in 1999, who also created \"Give Me Feelings\" and \"Sunrise\" for A-Mei. Feel has sold 180,000 copies in Taiwan, making it the best-selling EP in Taiwanese music history.\n\n\n== Background and development ==\nIn 1999, the beverage company Sprite wanted to use A-Mei's personality to convey the brand personality of their soda drink, so they invited A-Mei to be the spokesperson of their beverage in Asia. In order to match the advertisement, they released the EP album Feel, and created the advertisement song \"Give Me Feelings,\" which was written by Wu Yukang and Chen Zhihan, and in order to make the brand even more youthful, the lyrics used the words \"Come on Come on, Give Me Feelings.\"\n\n\n== Writing and production ==\n\"Give Me Feelings\" is a passionate song, which is 10 years apart from 1989's \"Follow the Feelings (跟着感觉走)\", but is even more dynamic than its predecessor. During the performance of the song, A-Mei's spirited vocals were paired with lively dance moves. The stylish and bouncy \"Give Me Feelings\" and other songs came out one after another, gradually established A-Mei's position in the singing world.The song \"Sunrise\" serves as the theme song of the vast WORLD MUSIC Sprite advertisement No. 2 in 1999. The song was written and composed by Tong Kong (童孔). \"Sunrise\" keeps a brighter energy to it, which ties it in with “Give Me Feelings,” but it has a more laid back arrangement.\n\n\n== Release and promotion ==\nThe songs \"Give Me Feelings\" and \"Sunrise\" both appeared in Sprite commercials. The first Sprite commercial features \"Give Me Feelings\"; in the first commercial A-Mei leads a throng of young people in a celebration of song and dance in the streets. She then runs into beauty parlors and restaurants, where she pulls off bystanders' masks off and invites them to join in the revelry. The second commercial that features \"Sunrise\" shows A-Mei dancing with her dancers in a dance studio, driving four-wheel ATVs on the beach with her friends, playing basketball in an outside basketball court with a bunch of children and eating seafood and drinking Sprite at a house party; with the final shot of the commercial showing A-Mei asleep on a chair with a puppy in her arm. The first commercial was filmed in Shanghai on the afternoon of January 19, 1999, which resulted in serious traffic jams around the shooting site.\n\n\n=== Live performances ===\nIn February 2000, A-Mei performed \"Give Me Feelings\" at the CCTV Spring Festival Gala in Beijing. On January 20, 2007, A-Mei performed the song at Sprite China Original Music Pop Chart Annual General Selection Award Ceremony in Chengdu. On February 13, 2007, she performed the song at the Overseas Spring Festival Bilingual Gala in Las Vegas.\n\n\n=== Singles and music videos ===\nThe music video for \"Give Me Feelings\" was directed by Shao Yuanzhi (邵元智). The music videos for both the songs carry identical storylines from their respective commercials. In January 2000, \"Give Me Feelings\" was listed at number 66 on the 1999 Hit FM Top 100 Singles of the Year chart.\n\n\n== Accolades ==\n\"Give Me Feelings\" was one of the winning songs of the 6th Chinese Top 20 Song Awards at the 5th China Music Awards, which was held by Channel V.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

(Bob) Long (born August 5,1959)is an American professional baseball umpire.\nBorn in Salem, Massachusetts, and raised in Randolph, Massachusetts, Long began umpiring at the age of thirteen in the South Randolph Little League where his father was in charge of the umpires.After graduating from Randolph High School in 1977, Long attended the Joe Brinkman Umpire School in 1982. His professional career began that same year when he was assigned to the New York–Penn League, after which he was promoted to the Florida State League. After two years, he was then promoted to the Double A Eastern League. During that time he also umpired in the Venezuelan Winter League. Following his four years, in the Eastern League, Long was promoted to the AAA International League. While in the International League, his contract was purchased by the National League. Long worked 12 games in the National League in 1992 and 1993. His last year as a full-time professional umpire was 1993, but he continued to work in AAA as needed until 2017 when he retired from professional baseball.\nHe is a member of the Randolph High School Hall of Fame and the Cranberry Baseball League Hall of Fame. He continues to work amateur baseball in the Boston area and speak and teach about [umpiring].\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRetrosheet",

It is recognised by the International Mathematics Union.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Colombian Mathematical Society was founded at a meeting in the home of Julio Carrizosa Valenzuela on 10 August 1955. Carrizosa Valenzuela had been greatly influenced by two European mathematicians, Carlo Federici Casa and János Horváth (known in Colombia as Juan Horváth), who were working in Bogotá at the time. He felt the need to modernise Colombian mathematics and develop it as a subject independent of engineering.\nThe founding members of the society were (in alphabetical order):\n\nThe society initially had two governing statutes, and Carrizosa served as the first president.\n\n\n== Activities ==\nThe Colombian Mathematical Society organises the Colombian Mathematics Congress (Spanish: Congreso Colombiano de Matemáticas) every two years, in association with various academic institutions in Colombia.\n\n\n=== Commissions ===\nThe SCM supports three commissions with specific goals.\n\nThe Mathematics Education and Dissemination Commission (Spanish: Comisión de Educación y Divulgación Matemática) aims to improve mathematics education at every level in Colombia.\nThe Equity and Gender Commission (Spanish: Comisión de Equidad y Género) aims to increase the participation and visibility of women in mathematics in Colombia, and to cooperate with other national and international organisations with similar goals.\nThe Applied and Industrial Mathematics Commision Comisión de Matemáticas Aplicadas e Industriales) was established in 2019 to promote applied mathematics in Colombia and to create an intellectual community of interested professionals and students. It organises the Colombian Applied and Industrial Mathematics Conference (Spanish: Conferencias Colombianas de Matemáticas Aplicadas e Industriales, MAPI).\n\n\n== Publications ==\nThe Colombian Mathematical Society has two publications. \n\nThe Colombian Journal of Mathematics (Spanish: Revista Colombiana de Matemáticas) is published in partnership with the National University of Colombia.

The students were mainly Japanese, with Taiwanese accounting for only one percent.\nOn 5 December 1945 (the 34th year of the Republic of China), Taiwan was liberated and was ordered to be renamed \"Hualien Girls' School\". The Hualien Port Office Takeover Committee sent Mr. Wang Cangming to take over. In January 1946, the Education Department of the Chief Executive's Office appointed Ms. Yu Xiaozhao as the first principal. In February, it was renamed \"Taiwan Provincial Hualien Girls' High School\". In 1968, the Republic of China extended the national education to nine years, and the junior high school ended year by year. In July 1970, the junior high school was closed and ordered to be renamed \"Taiwan Provincial Hualien Girls' High School\". In February 2000, in order to save money, it was restructured into \"National Hualien Girls' Senior High School\". In 2010, the school's old administrative teaching building was assessed to be dangerous and included in the demolition and reconstruction process. The new administrative building was completed in 2011.\nIn April 2010, it was rated as a quality high school by the Ministry of Education.\nThe institutional building structure was heavily damaged in the 2024 Hualien earthquake.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNational Hualien Senior High School\nEducation in Taiwan\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nNational Hualien Girls' High School\nCultural Assets Bureau of the Ministry of Culture: Principal’s Dormitory of the Old Hualien Port High School for Girls",

        "content": "The convent of the Visitandines de Chaillot was a convent of the Visitation order located west of Paris, in Chaillot, in what is now the 16th arrondissement. Consecrated in 1651, the convent was destroyed in 1794.\n\n\n== Historical background ==\nIn 1583, Queen Catherine de Médicis bought and converted a hermitage on the hill of Chaillot, renamed \"Catherinemont\"; the architect Étienne Dupérac was commissioned to design a \"U-shaped\" villa with terraced gardens and a courtyard in the shape of a racecourse. However, the sovereign did not enjoy it for long: construction began in 1588 and she died the following year.\nIn 1613, this château overlooking the right bank of the Seine was purchased by Pierre Jeannin, First President of the Paris Parliament, and then, in 1630, by the Marquis de Bassompierre. On July 1, 1651, the property was purchased by the Visitandines at the initiative of Henriette-Marie de France, daughter of Henri IV and widow of Charles I of England, who established a community there. This was the order's third community, after those of rue Saint-Jacques founded in 1626 and rue Saint-Antoine founded in 1632, which was its mother house.\n\nAfter fleeing rebellious England, Henriette-Marie commissioned the architect François Mansart to build a chapel here and invited some of her exiled court members. Mademoiselle de La Fayette (Mother Angelica in religion), Louis XIII's confidante, welcomed Sister Anne de Sainte-Eugénie (Madame de Saint-Ange), one of the twelve nuns exiled from Port-Royal Abbey by the archbishop in August 1664. Marie Mancini, Mazarin's niece, retreated for a time to the Convent of the Visitandines, while Mademoiselle de La Vallière, fleeing the court, took refuge there twice before entering Carmel. In 1669, Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet delivered his famous funeral oration for Henriette-Marie, Queen of England, in Mansart's chapel. The convent later hosted several Stuarts: Henriette of England, the future Duchess of Orleans, was raised here, as was King James II, while the body of Queen Mary of Modena, widow of James II, was buried here in 1718.\nIn 1686, the Visitation Order purchased the entire seigneury of Chaillot.\nThe monastery was located between barrière Sainte-Marie, opposite rue Vineuse and rue des Minimes, quai des Bonshommes and rue des Batailles. The latter joined the quay via the ruelle d'Hérivault and the convent via the ruelle Sainte-Marie.\nIn 1790, the convent housed 22 choir nuns, 9 converses, 2 tourières, a demoiselle agrégée, two sacristans, ten service girls and two carters.\nThe convent was closed in 1792, and its disused premises were partly destroyed on August 31, 1794, by an explosion at the Grenelle powder plant on the opposite bank of the Seine. The public authorities subsequently cleared the site. In 1813, the site became the subject of the Palace of the King of Rome project.\n\n\n=== Convent superiors ===\nHélène Angélique Lhuillier, died in 1655, first superior\nMademoiselle de La Fayette (in religion Mother Angélique), 1655 to 1665;\nMadame Croiset, 1689–1690;\nAnne Charlotte Bochard de Saron, May 1715 to March 31, 1721;\nJeanne Françoise Le Vayer, April 1, 1721, to December 31, 1724;\nLouise de Lorge, May 17, 1749, to May 9, 1755; April 1758 to December 23, 1763;\nMarie Damiette, May 10, 1755, to April 1758; December 1763 to May 25, 1770;\nAnne Madeleine Chalmette, May 26, 1770, to May 17, 1776;\nMarie Gabrielle Roslin, May 18, 1776, to May 1782; in 1790;\nJeanne Adélaïde Pichon, in 1787.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nChâteau de Chaillot\nOrder of the Visitation of Holy Mary\nLouise de La Fayette\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nDuvignac-Glessgen, Marie-Ange (2017). \"La Visitation de Chaillot au xviie siècle : splendeurs et tribulations d'un monastère dans le siècle\".

Durey has been collaborating with queer artist Katie Kozak, who is of Metis and Ukrainian descent, since 2012.\nDurey's practice focuses on mixed media and performance-based works and he engages with found objects, photographs, sounds, and places. In the exhibition, Aporia (Notes to a Medium) at the Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery, Durey and Kozak collaborated on an installation titled Covers, a series of bedsheets that were hand-dyed and marked, and then hung in a series to become “reminiscent of a rainbowed celestial sky.” CBC host Margaret Gallagher conducted a radio interview with the Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery's head curator as part of Gallaghers North by Northwest show, where they discuss Durey and Kozak's Covers in more detail.\nOther collaborative works created with Kozak include Endless Summer at the Gordon Smith Gallery of Canadian Art, Candelabra at the Sointula Art Shed's Window Gallery, and Baba’s House at the Dunlop Art Gallery.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "James Gilchrist (died 1777) was a British Royal Navy captain.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nGilchrist was promoted to be a lieutenant in the navy on 28 August 1741, and in 1749 was serving in the Namur when, on 12 April, she was lost with all hands on board. As only those who were on shore with the admiral, or sick in hospital, escaped, it would seem probable that Gilchrist was Boscawen's flag-lieutenant. When the news of the peace was confirmed, he was sent home in command of the Basilisk bomb, bringing the few survivors. He arrived at Plymouth on 17 April 1750, putting in there on account of the inclemency of the weather, which the men were unable to stand, being, he wrote, entirely naked. On 18 July 1755 he was advanced to post-rank and appointed to the Experiment frigate, which he joined on 8 August. In September he was sent over to the coast of France, where in eleven days he captured no fewer than sixteen, mostly small, vessels. In the beginning of 1756 he was sent into the Mediterranean, where he joined Admiral Byng, and was present at the action off Minorca on 20 May. He was afterwards appointed by Sir Edward Hawke, in rapid succession to the Chesterfield, the Deptford, and the Trident; was then sent home as a witness at the trial of Admiral Byng, and in April 1757 was appointed to the Southampton, a 32-gun frigate, in which, off Portland, on 25 July, he fought a severe action with two French frigates of superior force (Laughton, Studies in Naval history, p. 333), and succeeded in beating them off. With better fortune he met, on 12 September, the French frigate Émeraude, which he captured after a sharp action of thirty-five minutes' duration, and brought into Falmouth. During the following year he was still employed in Channel service, in the course of which he captured two large privateers; and on 28 March 1759, being in company with Captain Hotham in the Melampe [see Hotham, William, Lord], on a cruise in the North sea, met and engaged the 40-gun French frigate Danae, which, after a hard-fought action, lasting all through the night, struck her flag in the morning. Gilchrist was shot through the shoulder by a one-pound ball, a wound that for the time endangered his life, and rendered his arm permanently useless. He never served again, but lived in retirement at his family seat of Hunsfield in Lanarkshire, where he died in 1777. One of his daughters married the ninth earl of Dundonald, and was the mother of Thomas Cochrane, tenth earl of Dundonald.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1890). \"Gilchrist, James\".

        "content": "B.F. Clyde's Cider Mill is a historic cider mill located in Mystic, Connecticut. It is the oldest and only surviving steam powered cider mill in the United States. It is also the oldest continuous producer of hard cider in the United States.\n\n\n== History ==\nBenjamin F. Clyde began selling apple cider in 1881, but had it pressed at other mills. He purchased his own mill in 1897. The mill itself was installed in 1898. It has all steel construction and has one of the final screw presses.\nSince then, ownership of the mill has passed from generation to generation within the family, spanning six generations as of today. Visiting the mill is a local tradition.\nIn 1994 it was listed as a Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark by the ASME.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nASME Pamphlet",

        "content": "The Kindelsberg near Kreuztal in the North Rhine-Westphalian district of Siegen-Wittgenstein is a\n618.5 m (2,029 ft 2+1⁄2 in)  high mountain in the Rothaar Mountains.\nThe mountain, which can be seen from afar, is a landmark of Kreuztal and is the second highest in the city after the Hoher Wald (656.4 m (2,153 ft 6+1⁄2 in)). The Kindelsberg observation tower and the Kindelsberg transmission tower are located on its summit region with the Kindelsberg ring fortress. The mountain has been a popular hiking and excursion destination since the 19th century.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nKindelsberg is a southwestern foothill of the Rothaar Mountains, which are part of the Rhenish Slate Uplands. It rises in the northern part of the Siegerland as part of the Sauerland-Rothaar Mountains Nature Park in the community of Kreuztal between its districts of Littfeld (northwest), Krombach (west) and Eichen (west-southwest), the center of Kreuztal (south), the district of Ferndorf (southeast) and the Hilchenbach districts of Dahlbruch (southeast) and Müsen (east); a few kilometers to the northeast lies the Kirchhundem district of Silberg. The border with Hilchenbach runs about 600 m northeast of its summit, where there is a trigonometric point (617.9 m). The Ferndorfbach stream flows south of the mountain and the Littfe stream flows west.\n\n\n=== Natural area classification ===\nThe Kindelsberg belongs to the main natural region group Süder Uplands (No. 33), the main unit Rothaar Mountains (with Hochsauerland) (333), and the sub-unit Westrothaarhöhen (333.4) of the natural area Brachthäuser High Forest Mountains (333.40, see section in the Rothaar Mountains article). To the east, its landscape falls into the Hilchenbacher Winkel subunit (331.1). It also descends to the south into the Nördliches Siegener Bergland (331.01) and to the west into the Littfelder Grund (331.00), which belong to the North Siegerland highlands (331.0) subunit of the Siegerland (331) main unit.\n\n\n== Protected areas ==\nTo the north of the forested Kindelsberg lies the nature reserve Grubengelände und Wälder bei Burgholdinghausen (CDDA no. 163392; designated in 1991; 1.38 km²) with the local fauna and flora habitat area Grubengelände Littfeld (FFH no. 4914–303; 42 ha) and to the southeast the nature reserve Loher Tal (CDDA no. 318746; 1986; 82 ha). The Rothaar Mountains (SI) landscape conservation area (CDDA no. 555550027; 299.42 km²) extends to its northeastern highlands.\n\n\n== Kindelsberg hillfort ==\n\nThe Kindelsberg is a fertile breeding ground for all sorts of legends, especially about the old prehistoric hillfort, the original meaning of which is probably more guessed than known. This is probably why many singing and gymnastic festivals took place on the mountain.\nAccording to legend, there was once a knight's castle, the Kindelsburg, on the Kindelsberg. The remains of a rampart still exist. Old quarry stone walls and earthen ramparts became a knight's castle, and some even believed they could recognize Roman ramparts. In 2017, the Regional Association of Westphalia-Lippe (LWL) determined from drilling samples that the ramparts even date back to the pre-Roman Iron Age, i.e. the Celts.\nHowever, according to some locals, it is also possible that the name comes from the mountain of the Christ child and was later shortened to Kindelsberg because of the long spelling.\n\nIn 1998, the Regional Association of Westphalia-Lippe published a study by Philipp R. Hömberg that was based on unpublished documents of the soil scientist Heinz Behagels from the year 1933. According to this study, the remains of an up to three-meter-wide dry-stone wall as part of the former rampart front were found about two meters in front of the present rampart crest. There was a level strip (\"berm\") between the wall and the ditch. Inside the castle, charcoal and red burnt clay were found, probably the remains of a burnt wooden structure.\n\n\n== Mining ==\nMining was once carried out on and around the Kindelsberg. As a result, the local mining district of Müsen, including the neighboring Martinshardt (616.1 m) to the east, which was one of the most important in the Siegerland region, is crisscrossed by numerous adits. The most famous is the Crown Prince-Friedrich-Wilhelm Mine, which starts in the center of Kreuztal and extends far under the mountain. On the neighboring Ziegenberg (Hölzenberg; 521.1 m) to the northeast are the remains of the Altenberg mine.\n\n\n== Kindelsberg Tower ==\n\n\n=== Tower history ===\n\nThe first observation towers were built in Germany at the end of the 18th century, initially resembling medieval waiting rooms. Later, simple wooden and iron structures were added. A strong \"visual addiction\" and the desire for untamed nature triggered a \"lookout tower boom\". Impressive monuments were erected to commemorate great days in German history, such as the \"Kaiser Wilhelm\" and \"Bismarck\" towers. The first observation towers and church pulpits were also built in the Siegerland region. The Gilberg Tower near Siegen-Eiserfeld was built in 1888, followed by the Giller Tower near Hilchenbach-Lützel in 1892 and the Rabenhain Tower near Siegen-Volnsberg in 1896.\n\n\n=== Tower development and description ===\n\nThe construction of an observation tower on the Kindelsberg was first discussed at a meeting of the Krombach section of the Sauerland Mountain Association(SGV) on March 30, 1896. In 1904, a building committee of club members was formed. In 1905, this committee abandoned an earlier plan for a wooden or iron frame tower in favor of a quarry stone structure. The cornerstone of the Kindelsberg Tower was laid on Ascension Day, 1906. Siegen's city planning officer, Scheppig, was responsible for planning and supervising the construction, while Krombach builder Eduard Burbach carried out the construction.\n\nAll the building materials had to be hauled up the mountain by oxen and horse-drawn wagons, and the stone was quarried from a nearby ridge. The costs were covered mainly by donations. On May 26, 1907, the tower, which was 22 meters high at the time, was inaugurated in front of a large crowd.\n\nThe Kindelsberg tower was topped by an iron \"lantern\" and surrounded at the base by a covered walkway with a small lounge. In 1953, to better serve the hikers, a log cabin made of spruce trunks with a quarry stone base was erected in place of a small shelter. In 1968, when it was no longer able to meet the demands of the many visitors, it was considerably enlarged to become a large mountain inn \"with an architecture based on the log cabin style of the Alpine countries\". The new building was completed in 1971 with the second phase of construction. A kitchen extension was built in 1990 and a terrace extension in 1996. The building is no longer just a hiker's hostel, but a respectable guesthouse for hikers and tourists - the Kindelsberg Guesthouse.\n\nHowever, the tower can no longer be seen in its original form. In the 1980s, for example, the open viewing platform at a height of 20 meters was replaced by a barred, covered walkway. In addition, antennas were added to the tower and roof, bringing the tower's height to 28 meters. The former appearance can only be guessed at from older Krombacher brewery emblems, as the tower is part of the company's emblem. On the occasion of the 75th-anniversary celebration, which took place on May 20, 1982, with thousands of hikers, the brewery placed a commemorative plaque on the tower.\nThe 100th anniversary of the tower, now a protected monument, was celebrated on May 17, 2007.\n\n\n=== Viewpoint ===\nFrom the Kindelsberg tower, you can see the villages around the mountain in the center of Kreuztal. You can also see the Siegerland region with the Westerwald (south) and the Rothaar Mountains (northeast) beyond and across to the Ebbe Mountains (northwest). In good weather, you can see as far as the Sieben Mountains (west-southwest) near Bonn, about 40 miles (65 km) to the southwest.\n\n\n=== Transmitters of the Kindelsberg Tower ===\nUntil the Kindelsberg transmission tower was completed, all transmission and reception systems were located on the observation tower:\n\nAnalog TV transmitters: ARD in the VHF band and ZDF, WDR Fernsehen, and ARD again in the UHF band.\nMobile phone transmitter of T-Mobile\nAmateur radio relay station\nBall receiving antennas to the transmitter Nordhelle and the telecommunication tower Ebbe Mountains (transmitter Lüdenscheid)\nFrom the Kindelsberg tower, you can see the Nordhelle transmitter (DVB-T, DAB, VHF) and the Ederkopf transmitter (VHF, DAB). In addition, the Ebbe Mountains transmitter (analog ZDF and WDR television until 2007) and the Siegen-South transmitter (formerly DAB) can be seen to the south. The Siegen-Giersberg transmitter is behind mountains when seen from the Kindelsberg tower, so it has no line of sight and therefore no fiber optic connection.\nThe observation tower was largely cleared of antennas, except for the T-Mobile supply and the radio relay.\n\n\n== Kindelsberg transmission tower ==\n\n\n=== Overview ===\n\nThe Kindelsberg transmitter tower of the West German Broadcasting Service (WDR) is located only 60 meters northeast of the Kindelsberg summit. It was built in the 1990s and served as an important transmitter for analog television for a long time. The FM radio station WDR 5, whose frequency (97.6 MHz) was previously transferred to this tower from the Siegen-Giersberg transmitter in the south-southeast, was broadcast from there; among others, 1LIVE, WDR2, WDR3 and WDR4 are broadcast from there. On February 11, 2021, the frequency was moved back to the Giersberg transmitter for cost reasons.\nUntil it was shut down on November 12, 2007, the tower was used to transmit the analog television channel Das Erste (ARD) in the VHF III band and the UHF band (as a feed for other TV converters).\nThere is a fiber optic connection to the Siegen-Giersberg transmitter (VHF, DVB-T, DAB), a radio relay link to the Nordhelle transmitter, and various radio links to other mobile radio transmitters (O₂, E-Plus, Vodafone).\n\n\n=== Analog radio ===\nSince the discontinuation of analog television, only analog radio (FM) has been broadcast from the Kindelsberg transmission tower:\n\n\n== Transport connections, hiking and sports ==\nA narrow private road from Littfeld, which joins the Grubenstraße in this Kreuztal district, leads to the heights of Kindelsberg near the summit. About 320 meters northeast of the summit is the Kindelsberg parking lot, from which a steep path leads to the Kindelsberg tower and the Kindelsberg guesthouse. The mountain is accessible via forest and hiking trails. Since 2007, to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the tower, there is a 14.6 km Kindelsberg Trail with 24 information stations where you can explore the area.\nOn September 8, 2007, TV Eichen organized the 25th Kindelsberg race, which is part of the Rothaar running series. The route leads from Eichen up the mountain.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nPhilipp R. Hömberg: Der Kindelsberg, Stadt Kreuztal, Kreis Siegen-Wittgenstein.

        "content": "Andrew Douglas (died 26 June 1725) was a British Royal Navy captain.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nDouglas was in 1689 master of the Phœnix of Coleraine, laden with provisions and stores for the relief of Londonderry, then besieged by the forces of James II. For some weeks a squadron of English ships had lain in Lough Foyle, unable or unwilling to attempt to force the boom with which the river was blocked, and the garrison was meantime reduced to the utmost extremity. Positive orders to make the attempt were sent to Colonel Kirke, who commanded the relieving force; and two masters of merchant ships, Browning in the Mountjoy of Derry, and Douglas in the Phœnix, volunteered for the service. With them also went Captain John Leake, in the Dartmouth frigate. As the three ships approached the boom, the wind died away; they were becalmed under the enemy's batteries, and were swept up by the tide alone. Their position was thus one of great danger; but while the Dartmouth engaged and silenced the batteries, the Mountjoy first and after her the Phœnix crashed through the boom. The Mountjoy took the ground, and for the moment seemed to be lost. She was exposed to a heavy fire, which killed Browning; but the concussion of her own guns shook her off the bank, and on a rising tide she floated up to the city. With better fortune the Phœnix had passed up without further hindrance, and brought relief to the starving inhabitants, by whom Douglas was hailed as a saviour. A certificate signed by George Walker and others, the leaders of the brave defenders of the city, recommended him to the king, and he was accordingly in February 1689–90 appointed to the command of their majesties' sloop Lark. In the following year, 30 Aug. 1691, he was posted to the Sweepstakes frigate, in which, and afterwards in the Dover, Lion, and Harwich, he served continuously during the war, employed, it would appear, on the Irish and Scotch coasts, but without any opportunity of distinction. In November 1697 the Harwich was paid off, and for the next three years Douglas was unemployed, during which time he wrote repeated letters to the admiralty, praying their lordships to take his case into consideration, as he was dependent on the navy. At last, in February 1700–1 he was appointed to the Norwich of 60 guns, which he commanded for eighteen months in the Channel, and in July 1702 sailed for the West Indies with a considerable convoy. He arrived at Port Royal of Jamaica in September, where for the next eighteen months he remained senior officer, and in July 1704 sailed for England with a large convoy. He arrived in the Thames in the end of September, and while preparing to pay off wrote on 4 Oct.: ‘Understanding that the Plymouth is near ready to be launched, I should gladly desire to be, together with my officers and men, removed into her, if his royal highness thinketh fit.’ The letter is curious; for almost while he was writing many of his officers and men were combining to try him by court-martial on charges of suttling, trading, hiring out the men to merchant ships for his private advantage, and of punishing them ‘exorbitantly.’ On such charges he was tried at Deptford on 16 Nov., and the court holding them to be fully proved, ‘in consideration of the meanness of his proceedings,’ sentenced him to be cashiered (Minutes of Court-martial). Five years afterwards, on 24 Sept. 1709, the Earl of Pembroke, then lord high admiral, on the consideration of fresh evidence, reinstated him in his rank (Home Office Records (Admiralty), xix. 184), and in March 1710–11 he was appointed to command the Arundel, in which he was employed in the North Sea, and stretching as far as Gottenburg with convoy. While in her, on 15 Dec. 1712, he was again tried by court-martial for using indecent language to his officers, and confining some of them to their cabins undeservedly, and for these offences he was fined three months' pay. He seems indeed to have been guilty, but under great provocation, more especially from the lieutenant, who was at the same time fined six months' pay. In the following March the Arundel was paid off, and in February 1714–15 Douglas was appointed to the Flamborough, also on the home station. She was paid off in October, and he had no further service, but after several years on half-pay as a captain, died 26 June 1725.\nOf his family we know but little. He had with him in the Norwich and afterwards in the Arundel a youngster, by name Gallant Rose, whom he speaks of as his wife's brother, ‘whose father was captain in the army in Cromwell's time.’ He also on different occasions applied for leave to go to the north of Ireland on his own affairs, which fact would seem to imply that, notwithstanding his Scotch-sounding name, he was an Ulster Irishman.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1888). \"Douglas, Andrew (d.1725)\".

        "content": "John Crookshanks (1708–20 February 1795) was a British Royal Navy captain.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nCrookshanks entered as a volunteer on board the Torbay with Captain Nicholas Haddock in the autumn of 1725. While serving in her he seems to have found favour with the Hon. John Byng, whom he followed to the Gibraltar, Princess Louisa, and Falmouth. In August 1732 he passed his examination for the rank of lieutenant; was made lieutenant in March 1734, and in July 1742 was promoted to be captain of the Lowestoft frigate of 20 guns. On 17 Sept. 1742, being in company with the Medway of 60 guns, she fell in with a French ship in the Straits. In the chase, as night came on, the Lowestoft far outsailed the Medway, and came up with the enemy; but Crookshanks, preferring to wait till daylight, or till the Medway joined, or till the weather moderated, wrapped himself in his cloak and went to sleep. When he woke up the chase was not to be seen. The ship's company were, not unnaturally, indignant, but their murmurs, if they reached the admiralty, carried no weight, and Crookshanks's explanation was considered sufficient. In the course of 1743 he had again to write an explanatory letter, defending himself against a charge of carelessly performing his duty of protecting the trade in the Straits, so that several merchant ships were picked up by the enemy's privateers. It was said that instead of cruising in search of the enemy's ships he was amusing himself on shore at Gibraltar; but his explanations were considered satisfactory. In 1745 he commanded the Dartmouth in the Mediterranean; and in May 1746 was appointed to the temporary command of the Sunderland of 60 guns, then on the Irish station. On 2 July, off Kinsale, she fell in with three ships judged to be French men-of-war. Crookshanks estimated them as of 40 guns each, and, considering the Sunderland to be no match for the three together, made sail away from them, and night closing in dark, succeeded in escaping. His men were angry and violent; they had not estimated the French force so high, and proposed, with some disturbance, to take the ship from Crookshanks, appoint the first lieutenant as captain, and go down to fight the French. They were quieted, though not without some difficulty; and Crookshanks, if indeed he knew of the uproar, conceived it best to pass it over. Two days afterwards they broke out into open mutiny, and said loudly that the captain was a coward. One man who had been in the Lowestoft brought up the story of what had happened in the Straits four years before. Crookshanks took his pistols in his hands and went on deck. ‘Damn you,’ roared the ringleader of the mutineers, ‘you dare not show the pistols to the French.’ The man was put in irons, tried by court-martial, and hanged; others were ordered two hundred and fifty lashes; the first lieutenant was dismissed the service; and Crookshanks, being relieved from the command of the Sunderland, was, in the following March, appointed to command the Lark of 40 guns, although Anson, then one of the lords of the admiralty, as well as commander-in-chief of the Channel fleet, had written, on 13 Aug. 1746, a month before the court-martial: ‘The first lieutenant of the Sunderland is a sensible, clever fellow, which is more than I can say of the captain; nor can I discover that the first lieutenant has ever caballed with the common men since Crookshanks came into the ship.’ In June 1747 the Lark, in company with the Warwick of 60 guns, sailed from Spithead for the West Indies. On their way, near the Azores, on 14 July, they met the Spanish ship Glorioso of 70 guns and 700 men, homeward bound with treasure, said to amount to nearly three millions sterling. The Warwick attacked the big Spaniard manfully enough, at close quarters, while the Lark kept a more prudent distance. The Warwick, being thus unsupported, was reduced to a wreck, and the Glorioso got away and safely landed her treasure at Ferrol (Fraser's Magazine, November 1881, p. 597). The damage the Warwick had sustained rendered it necessary to bear up for Newfoundland, where her captain officially charged Crookshanks with neglect of duty. He was accordingly tried by court-martial at Jamaica, dismissed from the command of the Lark, and cashiered during the king's pleasure. In October 1759 the board of admiralty submitted that he might, after twelve years, be restored to the half-pay of his rank, which was accordingly done. About the same time Crookshanks published a pamphlet in which he charged Admiral Knowles, who at the time of his court-martial was commander-in-chief at Jamaica, with influencing the decision of the court, out of personal ill-feeling. Knowles replied, refuting the charge, which indeed appears to have been groundless, and other pamphlets followed. Again, in 1772, Crookshanks brought a similar but more scurrilous charge against Knowles's secretary, the judge advocate at his trial, who retaliated by publishing in extenso the minutes of the court-martial. These give no reason for supposing that his condemnation was not perfectly just, or that his sentence was not a fortunate thing for the navy. Even if he was not guilty of cowardice, the officer who incurs suspicion of it on three distinct occasions within the space of four years is too unlucky to have command of a ship of war; in addition to which Crookshanks's manner and temper towards both men and officers seem to have been harsh and overbearing. He died in London on 20 February 1795.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1888). \"Crookshanks, John\".

He moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota to pursue a degree in engineering at the University of Minnesota (BA, 2004), and relocated to Northeast Minneapolis in 2005. Payne later received a master's degree in Business Administration from the Carlson School of Management in 2010.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Early career ===\nPayne began his career as an engineer then moved towards digital advertising and software design consulting. He worked briefly as an adjunct professor with the Minneapolis College of Art and Design.\nIn 2016, Payne joined the City of Minneapolis Office of Performance Innovation, bringing his design focus to a municipal government role. In his time with the OPI, he consulted on alternative public safety responses and helped establish the Behavioral Crisis Response team.\n\n\n=== Minneapolis City Council ===\nPayne ran for city council in 2021. He opposed the more moderate incumbent Kevin Reich (DFL), presenting a progressive platform based on racial equity and an overhaul of policing. He was elected to the Minneapolis City Council in 2021. Payne won the council seat on the second round of ranked-choice tabulation with 50.2% of the vote. He was sworn into office on January 3, 2022.\nIn 2023, he won his re-election, taking 89.7% of the vote over challenger Edwin Fruit of the Socialist Workers Party. His re-election was part of a shift in the council's alignment: a left-wing coalition endorsed by Minneapolis for the Many took a majority of city council seats. He was subsequently chosen as council president by a 10–3 vote in January 2024, serving alongside council vice president Aisha Chughtai. He also serves as the chair of the Settlement Agreement & Consent Decree Subcommittee and is a member of the Public Health & Safety Committee.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Kgabo II was kgosi of the Kwena tribe. He was born a junior son of the Bakwena kgosi Tebele. Tebele was succeeded by Kgabo's older brother Mogopa, and Kgabo was given control of a ward within the tribe. Following a drought, Mogopa wished to move the tribe to find rain, but Kgabo and his village did not accompany them. The Bakwena split into two separate groups: the Bakwena-Kgabo staying in Rathatheng, and the Bakwena-Mogopa that settled in Mabjanamatshwana.\nKgabo may have been the kgosi who lead the Bakwena from Rathatheng into present-day Botswana, but this could also have been his son and successor Motshodi. According to Isaac Schapera, Kgabo was succeeded by Motshodi c. 1740. According to history professor Leonard Ngcongco, Kgabo and Motshodi lived in the seventeenth century.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nNgcongco, Leonard D. (1979). \"Origins of the Tswana\".

        "content": "William Cony (died 1707) was a British Royal Navy captain.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nCony attained the rank of captain on 1 April 1704, when he was appointed to command the Sorlings frigate. In September 1705 he was sent, in company with Captains Foljambe, of the Pendennis, and Martin, of the Blackwall, to convoy the trade to the Baltic. On the return voyage they fell in on 20 October with a squadron of five French ships, four of them of fifty guns, commanded by the Chevalier de Saint-Pol, and having five privateers in company. The privateers captured the merchant ships, thus permitting the ships of war to devote themselves to the three ships of the escort. After a stubborn fight they took them all three, Foljambe and Martin being slain and Cony dangerously wounded. On the part of the French, De Cayeux, one of the captains, lost an arm, and Saint-Pol was killed—a loss which, in the opinion of the French, was poorly compensated for by the successful issue of the combat (Guérin, Histoire Maritime, ii. 242). ‘I would,’ the French king is reported to have said, ‘that the English ships were safe at home if I had but Saint-Pol back again.’ Cony, while still a prisoner in France, was tried by court-martial for the loss of his ship, and very honourably acquitted on 20 January 1705–6; and the court further reporting that he had particularly distinguished himself in the action, and had received several dangerous wounds, recommended him to his royal highness's favour. He was accordingly shortly afterwards appointed to the Romney of 50 guns, and commanded her in the Mediterranean under the orders of Sir Cloudesley Shovell. He seems to have been successfully engaged in cruising against the enemy's privateers in the Straits, and was returning home the following year, when, in company with the Association, the Romney and all in her were lost among the Scilly Islands on 22 October 1707.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1887). \"Cony, William\".

        "content": "Gyulboor Shaulovna Davydova (Russian: Гюльбоо́р Шау́ловна Давы́дова; March 8, 1892 – April 9, 1983) was a Soviet  winegrower of Mountain Jewish descent. She was a manager of the collective farm named after Kaganovich in the Dagestan ASSR, the Soviet Union. She was an awardee of the Hero of Socialist Labor (1949).\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\nGyulboor Davydova was born on March 8, 1892, in the Mountain Jewish village of Khoshmenzil, Dagestan Oblast, Russian Empire, in a peasant family. Since childhood, she worked in the fields and helped her parents. After the death of her husband, she was left with two little children.\nIn 1928, when the collective farm “New Life” was formed in the village, Gyulboor Davydova was not accepted into it, believing that women could not work on an equal basis with men. Then she gathered 14 widowed farmworkers and organized a women's collective farm, to which women named it “Red Farmwoman”, and Gyulboor Davydova was elected chairwoman. The women's collective farm completed the spring sowing, prepared the ground for melon crops, and their yield turned out to be higher than in the men's agricultural farm. Subsequently, both of these collective farms merged into one large farm.\nTwo of Davydova's sons, David and Ruvin, died in the Great Patriotic War.\nOn July 27, 1949, for obtaining high grape yields in 1948, the title of Hero of Socialist Labor was awarded to her by the decree of Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the highest body of state authority in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). Gyulboor Davydova was only Mountain Jewish woman who was awarded such a high award.\nGyulboor Davydova was repeatedly elected as a deputy of the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the Dagestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, as well as a deputy of the local Council of People's Deputies.\nDavydova died on April 9, 1983, and was buried at the Jewish cemetery in Derbent.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nHero of Socialist Labor\nOrder of Lenin\nMedal \"For the Defence of the Caucasus\"\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nA street in the city of Derbent is named after Gulboor Davydova.\nAgricultural firm named after Gulboor Davydova (former collective farm named after Kaganovich)\nA poem “Gyulboor” by the Mountain Jewish writer Hizgil Avshalumov is dedicated to Gyulboor Davydova.\nPoet Sergey Izgiyayev wrote the lyrics for the song “Gyulboor” that he dedicated to Gyulboor Davydova.

        "content": "Henry Wells Giffard (1810 – 1 June 1854) was a British Royal Navy captain.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nGiffard was the son of Admiral John Giffard (d. 1851). He entered the navy in 1824; was a midshipman of the Asia at the battle of Navarino, 20 October 1827; was promoted to the rank of lieutenant on 4 March 1831; and after serving in the Mediterranean and on the East Indian station was made commander on 22 February 1838. In 1839 he commissioned the Cruiser of 16 guns, in which he went out to China and took part in the capture of Chusan and Canton. He was advanced to post-rank on 8 June 1841; but continuing in command of the Cruiser, was present at the reduction of Amoy and Chinghae. He returned to England in 1842, and in 1846–7 was captain of the Penelope, bearing the broad pennant of Sir Charles Hotham, on the coast of Africa. In June 1852 he was appointed to the Tiger, paddle-wheel frigate, for service in the Mediterranean, and in 1854 attached to the fleet in the Black Sea. On 11 May the Tiger, in company with two other steamers, was detached from the fleet off Sebastopol, and early on the following morning in a dense fog took the ground close under a cliff a little to the south of Odessa. As soon as she was discovered from the shore, the Russians brought up a battery of field-pieces, and from the edge of the cliff opened a plunging fire of shot, shell, and carcasses, to which the Tiger's guns were unable to reply. The ship was soon set on fire, shell and shrapnel were sweeping her decks, resistance was impossible, and Giffard, severely wounded in the leg, was carried down to the surgeon. Under these circumstances he ordered the ship to be surrendered, and the officers and men, becoming prisoners of war, were hastily sent ashore; Giffard, whose leg had just been amputated, being passed into a boat through a maindeck port. Every care and attention seems to have been shown to the wounded, but the shock to Giffard's system, added to the anxiety and depression of spirits, proved fatal, and he died on 1 June. ‘He died as he lived, a religious man, much regretted by all,’ is the comment of one of the Tiger's officers. He was buried at Odessa with military honours.\nGiffard married, in 1846, Ella Emilia, daughter of Major-general Sir Benjamin C. Stephenson, G.C.H., and left issue, among others, Vice-admiral George Augustus Giffard, C.M.G. (b. 1849), who, as a lieutenant of the Alert, served in the Arctic expedition of 1875–6.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1890). \"Giffard, Henry Wells\".

        "content": "Between August 8 and 9, 2020, clashes broke out between soldiers of the South Sudan People's Defence Forces (SSPDF) and Luanyjang gelweng in Romic, Tonj East, Warrap State, South Sudan during a disarmament process outlined in the peace process after the South Sudanese Civil War.\n\n\n== Background ==\nFollowing South Sudanese independence in 2011, tensions rose between Dinka President Salva Kiir and Nuer vice-president Riek Machar. These tensions grew into a civil war between Kiir's SSPDF (the official South Sudanese Army) and Machar's pre-independence militia Sudan People's Liberation Movement-in-Opposition (SPLM-IO), and quickly spread across various ethnic and religious militias across South Sudan. In 2018, Machar and Kiir finally signed a peace agreement dubbed the R-ARCSS between South Sudanese opposition movements and the South Sudanese government, but this was not implemented until 2019.\nIn 2020, ethnic violence largely de-escalated across South Sudan as a result of the peace agreement and the implementation of a United Nations arms embargo on the country. However, guns were being imported into the country and to all actors in the conflict despite the embargo, being used in war crimes and stockpiling. Amnesty International investigators also discovered that the disarmament process delineated by the UN was seldom occurring.\nDespite the peace agreement, wars continued across various groups in Tonj East County, Tonj North County, Tonj South County, and Tonj city in Warrap state. Most of Warrap state is ethnically Dinka, but inter-ethnic feuds and clan warfare is prominent in Warrap state between Dinka. In Tonj East, the Rek Dinka share territory with the Luanyjang Dinka, who are a minority. Historically, Luanyjang had been raided by the larger Rek Dinka during disarmament campaigns of the Second Sudanese Civil War. After Akol Koor Kuc, a former ally of Kiir who used his loyalism to become head of and bolster South Sudan's National Security Services (NSS) fell on bad terms with Kiir, Kiir appointed Bona Panek, an opponent of Kuc, as governor of Warrap State. Panek then launched a disarmament campaign in Warrap state, although this was mainly to take arms from Kuc and his supporters, which included Luanyjang areas of Tonj East.\nRek Dinka commander Bol Akot Bol established a post in Romic, the capital of Tonj East, in late July 2020 in preparation for the disarmament campaign. Around this time, Rek Dinka had begun grazing in Luanyjang areas, so Luanyjang feared that with no weapons, they would be defenseless against possible raids by Rek Dinka over cattle.\n\n\n== Clashes ==\nOn August 8, 2020, SSPDF under Bol shot an unarmed man at the market in Romic during disarmament. The shooting occurred following an argument over a red bandana in the market, and the man's refusal to give SSPDF soldiers his bandana. Violence broke out between the SSPDF and Luanyjang civilians at the market, with shops being ransacked and looted and the market eventually being burned down. \nThe shooting of the unarmed man spurred Luanyjang gelweng, or militias, to attack the SSPDF base in Romic on the night between August 8 and 9. The base was attacked during the night, incurring heavy casualties for the SSPDF. Gelweng attacked the base a second time that morning, overrunning the base and killing more SSPDF soldiers. SSPDF forces used tanks and other weapons against cattle camps and villages surrounding Romic. Gelweng on the ground operated independently of the county commissioner and Luanyjang authorities, giving them popularity as a fighting force among Luanyjang residents.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nSSPDF officials asked Luanyjang authorities to identify the leaders of the gelweng in the immediate aftermath of the clashes. United Nations peacekeepers on August 14 conducted an air patrol over Romic and surrounding villages alongside Bol, and also established a temporary base in Romic to ensure stability. At least sixty-three soldiers and eighty-five civilians were killed during the clashes, and locals estimated that at least 150 people had been killed on both sides. At least thirty-one soldiers were injured in the clashes as well. Several tanks were abandoned in Romic as well.\nBol quit the disarmament campaign in Tonj East in late August due to public embarrassment over the heavy losses incurred by the SSPDF in Romic.

        "content": "Arthur Gardiner (1716? – 1758) was a British Royal Navy captain.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nGardiner is described in his passing certificate, dated 3 November 1737, as more than twenty-one years of age, and as having been at sea upwards of six years, chiefly in the Falmouth, with Captain John Byng. On 4 July 1738 he was promoted to be lieutenant, and after serving in the Sutherland, and in the Captain with Captain Thomas Griffin, he was promoted on 6 June 1744 to the command of the Lightning bomb, from which on 27 May 1745 he was posted to the Neptune as flag-captain to Vice-admiral Rowley. On 1 Oct. he was moved into the Feversham, which he commanded for three years in the Mediterranean, From 1749 to 1754 he commanded the Amazon on the coast of Ireland, and, on paying her off, applied on 15 May 1754 for leave to go to France for eight or ten months. In May 1755 he was appointed to the Colchester, but left her in the following September to join the Ramillies as flag-captain to his old commander, now Admiral Byng. In this capacity he accompanied Byng to the Mediterranean; and when, after the action off Minorca, Byng was recalled, Gardiner too was superseded from his command. At Byng's trial several points in Gardiner's evidence bore heavily on the accused, especially as he was a personal friend and an unwilling witness. In February 1757 he was appointed to the Monmouth of 64 guns, and again sent to the Mediterranean. In February 1758 he was with the squadron under Admiral Osborn, shutting up M. de la Clue in Cartagena, when on the 28th the Marquis Duquesne, with three ships, attempted to raise the blockade. The ships were immediately chased, and took different courses. The Foudroyant, carrying Duquesne's broad pennant, was the ship in which M. de Oalsonnière had hoisted his flag in the battle of Minorca, and, notwithstanding her enormous size, Gardiner had been heard to say that if he fell in with her, in the Monmouth, he would take her or perish in the attempt. It is, perhaps, more probable that the story was invented afterwards; for it was by the mere accident of position that the Foudroyant was chased by the Monmouth, the Swiftsure and Hampton Court, each of 70 guns, following. As night closed in, however, the Monmouth ran the chase out of sight of the other two ships, and, having partially disabled her rigging, brought her to close action about seven o'clock. In the very beginning of the fight Gardiner was wounded in the arm by a musket bullet, though not so seriously as to compel him to leave the deck. About nine o'clock, however, he fell, shot through the head, and died a few hours afterwards. The fight was gallantly continued by the first lieutenant, Robert Carkett, and on the Swiftsure coming up about one o'clock, the Foudroyant hauled down her colours. The great disproportion between the combatants, the Foudroyant being an unusually large and heavily armed ship of 8O guns, and the fact that the Monmouth alone had beaten her gigantic adversary almost to a standstill before the Swift sure came up, as well as the circumstances of Gardiner's death, have all combined to render the action one of the most celebrated in the Royal Navy's annals; and that this distinction should have been achieved by a pupil of Byng and Griffin is perhaps not its least remarkable feature.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1889). \"Gardiner, Arthur\".

Along with another brother, Ja'far, Haydara served as his brother's chief aide and deputy already during the latter's service as chief of staff to the all-powerful vizier al-Afdal Shahanshah, in 1107–1121. After al-Ma'mun's rise to the vizierate, Haydara was appointed governor of Alexandria. In this capacity he helped defeat an invasion of the Luwata Berbers in 1123, and in the same year fought off the raids of the Venetian fleet that took part in the Venetian Crusade. When al-Ma'mun was abruptly arrested by Caliph al-Amir on 3 October 1125, Haydara was also imprisoned along with several of his brother's associates and relatives. He died in prison before his brother's execution in July 1128.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\nHalm, Heinz (2014).

        "content": "Robert Carkett (died 1780) was a British Royal Navy captain.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nCarkett seems to have entered the navy in 1734 as able seaman on board the Exeter. In her, and afterwards in the Grampus and Alderney sloops, he served in that capacity for upwards of four years, when he was appointed to the Plymouth as midshipman. In that ship, then belonging to the Mediterranean fleet, he remained for nearly five years, and during the latter part of the time under the command of Captain G.B. Rodney. He passed his examination on 18 July 1743, sailed for the East Indies in the Deptford in May 1744, was made lieutenant in the following February, and returned to England in September 1746. During the rest of the war he served in the Surprise frigate, and in March 1755 was appointed to the Monmouth, a small ship of 64 guns, which, after two years in the Channel, was, early in 1767, sent out to the Mediterranean under the command of Captain Arthur Gardiner. In the early part of 1758 the squadron under Vice-admiral Osborn was blockading Cartagena. On the evening of 28 February the Monmouth chased the French 80-gun ship Foudroyant out of sight of the squadron, and single-handed brought her to action. About nine o'clock Gardiner fell mortally wounded, and the command devolved on Carkett as first-lieutenant, who continued the light with equal spirit. Both ships were beaten nearly to a standstill, when the Swiftsure of 70 guns came up about one o’clock in the morning, and the Foudroyant surrendered. Carkett was immediately promoted by the admiral to command the prize, and a few days later appointed to the Revenge, which he took to England. His post rank was dated 12 March; and he continued in command of the Revenge, in the Downs, till the following February. He was then appointed to the Hussar frigate, and commanded her at home and in the West Indies till 23 May 1762, when she struck on a reef off Cape Français of St. Domingo, and was lost, her officers and men becoming prisoners of war. In June Carkett and the other officers were sent to England on parole, but he was not exchanged till the following December. In August 1763 he commissioned the Active, which he commanded in the West Indies, and most of the time at Pensacola, till 1767, in June of which year she was paid off at Chatham. In July 1769 he commissioned the Lowestoft, and again spent the greater part of his time at Pensacola, where his duties seem to have been promoting the welfare of the settlement and cultivating vegetables. His gardening was interrupted for a short time in 1770 by the death of Commodore Forrest, in consequence of which he had to undertake the duties of senior officer at Jamaica; but on being superseded by Commodore Mackenzie he returned to Pensacola, and remained there for the next three years. The Lowestoft was paid off in May 1773.\nIn November 1778 Carkett was appointed to command the Stirling Castle of 64 guns, and in December sailed for the West Indies in the squadron under Commodore Rowley. He thus in the following summer had his share of the clumsily fought action off Grenada, and on 17 April 1780 led the line in the action to leeward) of Martinique. Of Carkett's personal courage there can be no doubt, but his experience with fleet was extremely small, and of naval tactics he knew nothing beyond the rule for the line of battle laid down in the fighting instructions. When, therefore, Rodney, after directing the attack to be concentrated on the enemy's rear, made the signal to engage, Carkett in the Stirling Castle stretched along to engage the enemy van. Rodney wrote to the secretary of the admiralty on 26 April 1780 that his error had been fatal to the success of the action. This clause of Rodney's letter was not published in the ‘Gazette,’ but Carkett learned from England that something of the sort had been sent. He accordingly wrote to Rodney desiring to see that part of it which related to him. ‘All the satisfaction I received,' he complained to the secretary of the admiralty on 23 July 1780, ‘was his acknowledgment that he had informed their lordships that I had not properly obeyed his signals in attacking the enemy rear’ (Beatson, Nav. and Mil. Memoirs, vi. 222). Rodney's letter did in fact, contain a very severe reprimand, of which Carkett made no mention, but requested the secretary of the admiralty to lay his explanation before their lordships. Whether he ever received an answer is doubtful, for the Stirling Castle, which had been sent to Jamaica, and thence ordered home with the trade, was, in a violent hurricane on 5 October, totally lost on Silver Keys, some small rocks to the north of Cape Français. All onboard perished, with the exception of a midshipman and four seamen.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1887). \"Carkett, Robert\".

It survives only in fragments quoted by later authors, but is a key source for the history of early 12th-century Egypt, especially for unique details such as court ceremonies. When al-Ma'mun was raised to the vizierate in 1122, Musa and his three brothers received robes of honour from the caliph.

        "content": "William Blight (1785 – 22 July 1862) was a British Royal Navy captain.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBlight was entered 9 May 1793, as a volunteer on board the Intrepid, 64 guns, under the command of Captain the Hon. Charles Carpenter. In that ship he continued as midshipman, masters mate, and acting lieutenant, most of the time in the East and West Indies, until confirmed as lieutenant, 15 April 1803, and appointed to the Britannia of 100 guns, with Captain, and afterwards Rear-admiral, the Earl of Northesk. In the Britannia he had his share in the glory of Trafalgar, and was sent to take possession of the French Aigle of 74 guns, which was lost in the gale immediately after the battle. Blight, however, was fortunately rescued in time, and in the spring of 1806 followed Lord Northesk into the Dreadnought. In August 1806 he was appointed to the Néréide, 36 guns, with Captain Robert Corbet, and served in the attack on Buenos Ayres July 1807. The Néréide afterwards went to the East Indies, and in February 1809, when Captain Corbet was tried for cruelty, Blight, then first lieutenant, was the principal witness in defence. He was afterwards, 1812-14, agent for transports at Palermo ; in 1819-21 first lieutenant of the Queen Charlotte, flagship at Portsmouth; and 12 February 1821 was promoted to the rank of commander. In May 1828 he was appointed to the Britannia, carrying the flag of Lord Northesk as commander-in-chief at Plymouth, from which he was transferred to the St. Vincent, and was posted from her on 22 July 1830. He held no further appointment in the navy, and retired with the rank of rear-admiral 27 September 1855. He died 22 July 1862.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1886). \"Blight, William\". In Stephen, Leslie (ed.).

        "content": "Lucas Antonio Cepeda Barturen (born October 31, 2002) is a Chilean footballer who currently plays in Colo-Colo.\n\n\n== Club career ==\nCepeda started his career in the youth ranks of Santiago Wanderers. Nevertheless, in 2014, he had a brief spell at the Colo-Colo Football Academy in the Estadio Monumental David Arellano, which he abandoned due to the exhaustion generated by the constant trips between Santiago –where the training facility was located– and Curauma, where, at that time, he lived. After that, he returned to the lower divisions of Santiago Wanderers.\nIn 2021, Cepeda was promoted to Wanderers senior team. He made his professional debut in a 2–0 defeat against Palestino in a Chilean Primera División match. After Wanderers' relegation to Primera B, Cepeda made sporadic appearances in the 2022 campaign but was named starter for the 2023 season, where the team failed to promote to the first-tier during the promotion playoffs finals with Deportes Iquique.\nOn February 11, 2024, it was released that Cepeda was hired by Colo-Colo. On March 31, he scored his first goal for the team in a 4–1 home win over Everton de Viña del Mar, Wanderers' historic rival. Three days later, Cepeda scored an important continental goal against Paraguayan side, Cerro Porteño, for the 2024 Copa Libertadores. His score was an agonizing goal (90' min).\n\n\n== International career ==\nIn 2024, Cepeda received a call from the coach, Nicolás Córdova, to play in the CONMEBOL Pre-Olympic Tournament held in Venezuela. He played three games in that competition.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLucas Cepeda at Soccerway",

It starts from the border with Serbia at Brnjak, passes through cities such as Mitrovica, Pristina and Ferizaj, and ends at the North Macedonian border at Hani i Elezit. The road is 135 kilometers long.\n\n\n== Route ==\nThe M2 begins at the Serbia-Kosovo border, at Brnjak. It passes by Ujmani Lake. The environment is mountainous until Mitrovica, which connects to the M22.3 highway. The M2 highway continues to Pristina, where construction is ongoing to extend the road until Vushtria, where a bypass is being constructed. After Vushtria, it widens to a 2x2 road. In Pristina, it intersects with the M9 road at a roundabout, commonly known to locals as the \"Duplex Roundabout.\" The road remains a 2x2 road until the Kacanik Gorge, where the road narrows to a 1x1, and tunnels become very common. At Hani i Elezit, a roundabout connects the M2 with the R6 highway, and ends at the Hani i Elezit border.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe N2, once the M2, was a major Yugoslavian road from Italy to Greece. After the breakup of Yugoslavia, it was renumbered in Slovenia, Croatia, Montenegro, and North Macedonia. Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo still keep the name as M2. The road has been renamed from M2 to N2, but it is unknown when this happened.\n\n\n== References ==",

What he wrote was not, he said, collected out of other authors, but was his own practice, the product of real experience. He nowhere mentions any officer with whom he had served, any ship or any particular battle which he had been in, though he refers some of his experiences to ‘the last Holland war,’ to ‘one of the last fights we had with the Hollanders’—that is in 1673; or to ‘before Tripoli in Barbary, when we had wars with that place’—that is, in 1676. Similarly he speaks of having been at Newfoundland, and at many places in the Mediterranean; Alexandria, Scanderoon, Smyrna, and Constantinople are incidentally mentioned. He describes himself in 1693 as ‘being grown in years and not capable to hold it longer in that employ,’ as surgeon at sea. He seems to have lived for his remaining years in Westminster, where he died in February 1713–14. His published works are: \n\n‘Abstractum Chirurgiæ Marinæ, or An Abstract of Sea Surgery’ (12mo, 1686).\n‘Chirurgus Marinus, or The Sea Chirurgion’ (12mo, 1693).\n‘The Experienced Chirurgion’ (12mo, 1703).\n‘Chirurgic Memoirs’ (12mo, 1708). This last has a portrait in full flowing wig.He left a widow, Mary, and three children, a son, John, and two daughters, Mary Nozet, and Susanna Willon, apparently by a former marriage. To these he bequeathed one shilling each, ‘to debar them from claiming any interest in or title to any part of my real or personal estate.’ To a grandson, James Willon, ‘now beyond the seas,’ he left 10l. subject to the condition of his demanding it in person within seven years. The rest of the property was left to the widow, ‘sole and only executrix’ (will in Somerset House, Aston, 32, dated 1 March 1702–3, proved 17 Feb. 1713–14). One of the witnesses to the will is Edward Ives, who may probably have been the father of Edward Ives, the naval surgeon and traveller.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1894). \"Moyle, John (d.1714)\".

        "content": "The Anzeigenhauptmeister (English: Chief Reporting Officer) (born around 2006 as Niclas M.) is a young German man who became widely-known in Germany in 2024 for making thousands of citizen-reports of parking violations.\n\n\n== Origin ==\nNiclas M. dubbed himself the \"Anzeigenhauptmeister\" and systematically reports illegally parked cars to the regulatory authorities, Ordnungsbehörde, which handle low-level offenses.   He uses the website \"weg.li\" to document violations, and filed over 4,000 reports in 2023.  He has also announced a goal to report at least one illegal parker in every city in Germany. He is known for wearing full-body yellow safety clothing while riding a bicycle to find offenders, and temporarily used the name/symbol \"POLIZFI\", a play on the German word for police, Polizei. \nHe came to national attention in Germany in January 2024, and was featured on the Spiegel TV news show in February 2024. Some in the media have criticized the media exposure for coverage of his \"hobby\" and thus exposing him to public ridicule. \n\n\n== Reactions ==\nReactions in Germany have been mixed. Some praise his commitment to the enforcement of traffic laws, while others criticize him. When the city of Neumünster called on their residents to report parking violations in the spirit of Niclas M, this parked a \"Shitstorm\" of debate about citizen participation in government versus surveillance concerns. German rapper Finch released the song \"DER ANZEiGENHAUPTMEiSTER\" about him, and was in turn reported by Niclas for publishing an unauthorized photo of himself.\n\n\n== References ==",

He was born in London, and baptised on 21 January 1672–3. His childhood was spent with his grandfather at Norwich, as is known from the numerous references to 'Tomey' in Sir T. Browne's correspondence with his son. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, and proceeded M.B. in 1695, M.D. 1700. He was admitted a candidate of the College of Physicians on 30 September 1704, and a fellow on 30 September 1707 (Munk). In 1698 he married his cousin Alethea, daughter of Henry Fairfax, but had no issue. He inherited his father's estate at Northfleet, Kent, and (according to a statement in Le Neve's pedigree of the Brownes, printed in Simon Wilkin's 'life and Works of Sir T. Browne') died in 1710, in consequence of a fall from his horse. Browne was not eminent as a physician, and what interest attaches to his memory is chiefly through his family connections. He wrote, however, a curious account of an antiquarian tour through England in company with Dr. Robert Plot (historian of Oxfordshire, &c.), which exists in manuscript in the British Museum (Sloane 1899), and is printed in Wilkin's work above cited.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Payne, Joseph Frank (1886). \"Browne, Thomas (1672-1710)\".

        "content": "The expulsion of Egyptians from Libya took place during heightened tensions between the two countries, when the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi accused Egypt of 'provoking a war' in order to seize Libyan oil fields. With this order, almost all the Egyptians who had lived in Libya were required to leave the country by 1 July 1977 or face arrest.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn the 1970s, Gaddafi pursued Arab unity, resulting in the creation of the Federation of Arab Republics in 1972 with Egypt and Syria. However, the FAR only achieved symbolic gestures of unity despite initial ambitions for military consolidation.\nGaddafi pushed for unity with Egypt, but Anwar Sadat's interest waned, and he developed personal animosity towards Gaddafi. Gaddafi aimed to eliminate Israel, hoping to leverage Libya's finances and Egypt's strength. The Yom Kippur War in 1973 initiated by Egypt and Syria without Libya's consultation, led to Sadat's negotiation with Israel for Sinai's return. Gaddafi criticized Sadat for limited war objectives and ceasefire, leading to strained relations. Gaddafi then began to regularly expel migrant workers in order to put Sadat under pressure.\n\n\n== Expulsion ==\nThen in 1977, tensions reached their height, and as a result, Gaddafi forcefully expelled over 200,000 Egyptians from Libya, under the accusation that Egypt was supposedly attempting to seize Libyan oil fields. They were given a deadline by 1 July 1977 to choose whether to leave, or face arrest.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nGaddafi then initiated a full-scale war against Egypt which resulted in the capture and destruction of Sallum. Sadat then launched a counter offensive in an attempt to regain lost territory and to occupy parts of Libya. The war later culminated in a ceasefire with a status quo ante bellum.\n\n\n== References ==",

From 1996 to 1999, Heubach attended business school, graduating with a secondary school leaving certificate. She then attended high school from 2000 to 2001 and technical college (Fachoberschule) from 2001 to 2003, where she obtained her technical college entrance qualification.\nFrom 2008 to 2011 she completed training as an industrial clerk at e.on Facility Management GmbH, where she then worked until 2013.

On 21 March, joined her colleagues who used sign language welcome her.As a parliamentarian, Heubach will have a fixed seating place in the Reichstag building, unlike most other lawmakers, with interpreters sat close to interpret speeches and her questions. When Heubach is scheduled to make her own speeches, an interpreter with a microphone will have a place next to the Bundestag's stenographers to interpret her speeches to translate for other lawmakers to understand.On her joining the Bundestag the chairwoman of the Bavarian regional group in the SPD parliamentary group, Carolin Wagner said “this is a milestone for the inclusion and representation of the deaf community in the German Parliament\".

        "content": "Logie Easter is a civil parish in  Easter Ross in the Highland area of Scotland.\nIt is bordered by the parishes of Edderton and Tain in the north and Fearn and Nigg in the east. The Balnagown River on the south forms the border with Kilmuir Easter.   It extends about 7.5 miles (12.1 kilometres)  from east to west.  \nThe name Logie is Gaelic for 'hollow' and probably the parish took this name because a previous parish church was sited at Marybank in a hollow or dell by the River Balnagown.   \nThe parish is mainly rural with several areas of woodland. In the west of the parish, above Scotsburn, lies Scotsburn Wood, which contains a number of cairns, whch were almost certainly created to mark an ancient battle.  The land gently rises to  208 feet (63 metres) near Logie Hill in the eastern part of the parish, but further west near Lamington  rises to  351 feet (107 metres). The highest part is along  the western border, where Cnoc an t-Sabhail reaches  1,242 feet (379 metres).\n\nAt the 2011 census, the population of the civil parish was 658. 2.8% had some knowledge of Gaelic. A hundred years before, in 1911, 24.0% were Gaelic speaking (and 52.7% in 1881).   The area of the parish is 10,018 acres (15.7 sq mi; 40.5 km2).\nThe parish was originally divided between the counties of Ross-shire and Cromartyshire, but these counties were united in 1889.  1,807 acres (2.8 sq mi; 7.3 km2) were in Cromartyshire, part of an enclave around Tarbat House spanning Kilmuir Easter and Logie Easter.  The parish council was formed in 1895 with 7 elected members. This was replaced by Invergordon District Council in 1930, which was made up of the parishes of Rosskeen, Kilmuir Easter and Logie Easter. The District Council had 7 members, 3 of whom were the County Councillors for area and 4 elected to the District Council from the parishes (Rosskeen had 2 members and the others 1 each). Since 1976, this has been superseded by the Kilmuir and Logie Easter Community Council, which covers the parish of Kilmuir Easter as well as Logie Easter. The community council has 8 members. \nLogie Easter is in the ward of Tain and Easter Ross of Highland council.\nThe Far North Line railway route passes through the eastern part of the parish, but Nigg railway station within the parish is closed. The nearest open stations are at Tain and Invergordon.\n\nThere is now a combined Church of Scotland parish for Kilmuir & Logie Easter which uses both the Kilmuir Easter and Logie Easter church buildings. \nThe first church after the Scottish Reformation was built at Marybank (in a hollow) and was replaced by another building in the same place in 1767. In 1818 this was replaced by a church on Chapel Hill,  one mile (1.6 km)  north-east of Kildary. The United Free Church building  was opened nearby in 1905 and, after the re-union with the Church of Scotland, it became the parish's main place of worship in 1948. The previous building was demolished in 1988.\t The parish is first recorded (other than minimal references) in 1497 when King James IV  presented a new vicar for \"Logy\" (identified with Logie Easter) in the diocese of Ross. \t\n\n\n== Settlements ==\nArabella, Highland\nKildary\nLamington, Highland\nLogie Hill\nNewfield, Highland\nScotsburn, Highland\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Edmund Chapman (fl. 1733) was an English surgeon and man-midwife.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nChapman was a country practitioner, commenced midwifery practice about 1708. In 1733 he was in practice in Drake Street, Red Lion Square, London, and published 'An Essay on the Improvement of Midwifery, chiefly with regard to the Operation, to which are added Fifty Cases, selected from upwards of Twenty-five Years' Practice.' He was one of the earliest systematic writers on this subject in England, and published as much as he could discover of Hugh Chamberlen's (concealed) methods of delivery with the forceps. A second edition appeared in 1735, entitled 'A Treatise,' &c., with large additions. In 1737 Chapman replied in a pamphlet to some criticisms made by Douglas in his 'Short Account of the State of Midwifery in London and Westminster.' The dates of his birth and death are not known.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Bettany, George Thomas (1887). \"Chapman, Edmund\".

It was later chosen as leading single of the album Rotolando respirando, and it premiered at the 1977 Festivalbar.\n\n\n== Other versions ==\nPooh recorded  the song in English as \"Give Me Only This Moment\" and in Spanish as \"Dame sólo un minuto\". Pooh's member Dodi Battaglia recorded a new version in a duet with Enrico Ruggeri in his 2018 solo album Dodi Day. The song was sampled in Gemelli DiVersi's 1998 hit \"Un attimo ancora\", featuring Jenny B. Artists who covered the song also include Venezuelan rock-progressive band Témpano.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDammi solo un minuto at Discogs (list of releases)",

        "content": "John Cheshire (1695–1762) was an English physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nCheshire is stated to have been educated at Oxford, although he does not seem to have graduated there. He practised medicine in Leicester and the surrounding district, but never entered the London College of Physicians. He attained local celebrity and wrote two medical books: ‘A Treatise upon the Rheumatism,’ first published at Leicester in 1723, and afterwards in an enlarged edition, London, 1735; and ‘The Gouty Man's Companion,’ Nottingham, 1747. A case related (p. 14, ed. 1728; p. 26, ed. 1735) shows that Cheshire did not clearly distinguish between gout and chronic rheumatism. Of acute rheumatism his account shows little clinical knowledge, and is mixed up with trivial passages from other authors and much self-praise. For chronic rheumatism he recommends the waters of Kedlestone (p. 148), and for acute rheumatism advises cold baths and sweating between blankets (p. 75). ‘The Gouty Man's Companion’ is more interesting, but contains no important observations. Cheshire advises temperance as a preventive, draws up a diet scale, recommends tea in the afternoon, calomel and emetics during the attack, mercury in the intervals. He had observed that sciatic pain was sometimes a part of a general gouty condition, and this is almost the only weighty remark in all his pages. Of his personal history and character his medical writings give some glimpses. They show that he himself suffered from gout, that he had a high opinion of his own merits, and that he had been patronised by William, the third lord Craven. Craven was one of the followers of Pulteney, and in a servile dedication Cheshire goes out of his way to join in the cry against Robert Walpole as a corrupt and wicked minister, who ought to be impeached ‘in order to satisfy the well-grounded resentment of an injured nation.’\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Moore, Norman (1887). \"Cheshire, John\".

The hotel opened in October 2023.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe Fifth Avenue Hotel is located on the former estate of Charlotte Goodridge, a Gilded Age society hostess who lived at 250 Fifth Avenue (at the northwest corner of 28th Street). After Goodridge's death in 1902, the property was sold to Second National Bank, which contracted architectural firm McKim, Mead & White to construct a five-story Italian Renaissance palazzo that opened to the public in 1907. There were two subsequent additions, one in 1913 adding two-stories and in an expansion in 1928. The building was purchased in 1978 by the Ohebshalom family for use as commercial and office space.\n\n\n=== Conversion to hotel ===\nIn 2012, Alex Ohebshalom, hired architectural firms Perkins Eastman and PBDW Architects and interior designer Martin Brudnizki for renovating and converting the property into a luxury hotel. The renovation included the addition of a 24-story glass tower replacing the carriage house while restoring the mansion's original buff-colored brick and limestone facade, including its original terra cotta cornice.\nThe hotel opened in October 2023. Owned by Flâneur Hospitality, the hotel has 153 rooms. Most rooms and suites are located in the glass tower with some in the mansion. The mansion has 24 suites and the remainder of rooms and suites are in the tower. The hotel also includes two restaurants, Cafe Carmelini and The Portrait Bar. It also includes a ballroom and several unique meeting spaces. The ballroom is 3,000 square feet (280 m2) with 12-foot (3.7 m) ceilings.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Edmund Symes-Thompson (16 November 1837 – 24 November 1906) was an English physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nSymes-Thompson was born in London on 16 November 1837. He was the son of Theophilus Thompson by his wife Anna Maria, daughter of Nathaniel Walker of Stroud. The name Symes was adopted by his father on inheriting property from the Rev. Richard Symes, the last surviving member of the Somerset branch of the Sydenhams, who were descended from Dr. Thomas Sydenham. Edmund received his early education at St. Paul's School, and in 1857 entered King's College. There he gained a gold medal and the Leathes and Warneford prizes for divinity, and prizes for general proficiency. His medical education was pursued at King's College Hospital, and whilst a student he took an active part in physiological investigations with Lionel Smith Beale. He graduated M.B. in 1859, gaining the scholarship in medicine, a gold medal and honours in surgery, botany, and midwifery ; in 1860 he proceeded M.D.\nIn 1860 he was elected honorary assistant physician to King's College Hospital, and in 1863 to a similar post at the Hospital for Consumption, Brompton, to which his father had also been attached for many years. Having made up his mind to devote himself specially to consumption, he resigned his post at King's College Hospital in 1865. In 1869 he became honorary physician, and in 1889 honorary consulting physician to the Brompton Hospital. He was also honorary physician to the Royal Hospital for Consumption, Ventnor, and to the Artists' Benevolent and Artists' Annual funds. In 1867 he was elected professor of physic at Gresham College, and lectured regularly and with increasing efficiency to the end of his life. With his brother professors at the college, especially Benjamin Morgan Cowie, dean of Exeter, and John William Burgon, dean of Chichester, professor of geometry, he helped to develop the scheme of this old foundation and to popularise the lectures.\nHe became a member of the Royal College of Physicians in 1862, and a fellow in 1868. He was a fellow of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical and Medical societies, and a member of the Clinical and Harveian societies of London, acting as president in 1883 of the last society.\nSymes-Thompson was specially interested in the value of climate and spa treatment for the relief of diseases, especially of the lungs, and travelled widely on the Continent, besides visiting Egypt, Algeria, and South Africa. He was one of the founders of the British Balneological and Climatological Society, and was president in 1903. It was largely through his influence and his pamphlet on 'Winter Health Resorts in the Alps' (1888) that Davos and St. Moritz became popular health resorts, and he was an active mover in the establishment of the invalids' home at Davos (1895), and of the Queen Alexandra Sanatorium, which was opened there (1909) after his death. His most important contributions to medical literature were 'Lectures on Pulmonary Tuberculosis' (1863) and 'On Influenza: an Historical Survey' (1890), both being in part revision of books by his father. He was also closely concerned in the publication by the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society of the book entitled 'The Climates and Baths of Great Britain and Ireland’ (1895), besides contributing himself to its pages.\nLife insurance also interested him greatly, and besides holding a prominent position amongst assurance medical officers in London as physician to the Equity and Law Life Assurance Society, he contributed an article on the subject to the two editions of Sir Clifford Allbutt's 'System of Medicine' (1896 and 1905).\nSymes-Thompson, who had a large consulting practice amongst members of the church of England, cherished deep religious convictions, and he took active interest in many church institutions. He was a prominent worker in the guild of St. Luke, of which he was provost from 1893 to 1902, and he also assisted in establishing (1896) the annual medical service at St. Paul's Cathedral and the Medical Missionary College (1905). Both service and college were under the ægis of the guild of St. Luke. He was interested in the oral training for the deaf and dumb, writing a pamphlet on the subject, and being chairman for many years of the training college for teachers of the deaf and dumb at Ealing.\nHe lived first at 3 Upper George Street, and from 1878 to his death at 33 Cavendish Square. In 1899 he bought Finmere House, Oxfordshire, where he spent much of his leisure and gratified an early love for botany and a country life.\nHe died on 24 November 1906 at his house in Cavendish Square, London, and was buried in the parish churchyard at Finmere. There was an oil portrait in possession of the family by Mr. A. Tennyson Cole, and crayon portraits in Gresham College and the Royal Society of Medicine. His coat of arms was on one of the windows of St. Paul's School. He married on 25 July 1872 Elizabeth, daughter of Henry George Watkins, vicar of Potter's Bar, who survived him with four sons and two daughters.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Brockbank, Edward Mansfield (1912). \"Symes-Thompson, Edmund\".

        "content": "Chao Phraya Express Boat Orange Flag It is a popular express passenger boat for the working population. In urgent time The Orange Flag Chao Phraya Express Boat Orange flag will be another commute to work option for people in Bangkok. To reduce traffic problems and at all times, tourists often use the Chao Phraya Express Boat Orange flag. in tourism See the scenery of the Chao Phraya River as well.\n\n\n== Schedule ==\nUpdate date 27/03/2024\n\n\n== Boats ==\nChao Phraya Express boats Orange Flag operates mainly two types of boats; all of them are built mainly out of wood.\nSingle-screw boat:  They are able to hold around 90–120 passengers at a time and are around 26–32 m (85–105 ft) long and about 2.7 m (8 ft 10 in) wide. The area on the back of the boat (floor painted yellow) is normally restricted to embarking and disembarking passengers, but some people like to stand there when the boat is highly crowded. There are two 2-step stairs on each side of the boat connecting the yellow pad on the back to the passenger area inside the boat, while in between those stairs is a non-functioning on-board toilet. The engine room, in the appearance of a large wooden box, is inboard in the center line of the boat in front of the seating area. There are two rows of seats on the left and another two on the right and an aisle passing in the middle. On the newer boats, the roof from over the engine room to the middle section of the boat is raised for extra headroom because most standing passengers on crowded boats are standing there. This design has been applied to all other boats that are being built in the company's shipyards in Bangkok and Ayutthaya. These type of boats operate on all non-flagged, orange-flagged and green-yellow-flagged boats, but also off-peak direction trips of yellow-flagged boats. The fleet has about 50 boats of this type.\nTwin-screw boat or \"super size\" boat:  This type of boat holds around 120 to 180 passengers. Unlike the single-screw boat, the boat driver sits in a small pod above the passenger deck, similar to a cockpit on board a Boeing 747 airliner, giving view for passenger in the front-most row and public access to the boat's front deck for passengers who desire to watch the view from the boat's front without any obstruction (except for the Thai national flag). It is about 30–40 m (98–131 ft) long and about 5–7 m (16–23 ft) wide. Unlike a single-screw boat, its seating area stretches over the entire boat, while most seating is in front of engines. The engine rooms are placed lower than those in single-screw boats, and some passengers prefer to sit on them when it is crowded. There are 8 seats behind each engine. There are two aisles in the seating area in front of the engines and 3 aisles behind the engines. There are two toilets, one on the port and another one on the starboard, located in front of the engines. This type of boat serves as yellow flagged express boat in peak hours, and serves as tourist boats in off-peak hours. The fleet has about 15 boats of this type.\n\n\n== Routes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nChao Phraya Express Boat site\nChao Phraya Express at TransitBangkok.com\nMap of Chao Phraya Express, Khlong boats, BTS, and MRT\nThe Mass Transport Boats of Bangkok (Chao Phraya Express) (Photos)\nMarineLink.com review\nChaopraya express boat Guide",

        "content": "St. George's Memorial Church is an Anglican church in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nSt. George in Oshawa was founded in 1843 as a mission of St. John's, Whitby, and St. Paul's, Columbus. Services were held in the town hall and court house. They built their first permanent church building, a wood-frame structure at the northeast corner of King Street and Park Road, around 1847. The first incumbent was the Rev. John Pentland. It became an independent parish in 1859.\nThe second church building was constructed in 1858 at the southeast corner of Centre Street and John Street, today Memorial Park. It was also a wood-frame structure and featured a steeple. The church was enlarged in 1881 and consecrated on October 9, 1881, by Arthur Sweatman, Bishop of Toronto. A cairn marking the spot of the old church was unveiled by members of the parish on St. George's Day 1939.\nIn 1864, the parish acquired the land on Park Road North which became St. George's Anglican Cemetery. The earliest burial dates from 1841. Alexander Bethune, later Bishop of Toronto, consecrated the ground.\nThe Rev. Charles R. de Pencier became rector in 1910 and began planning to construct a new church on the site of the existing rectory. The outbreak of World War I halted these plans. On June 12, 1919, sod was turned for a new church by the Duke of Devonshire, Governor General of Canada. The cornerstone was laid by Major General James Howden MacBrien, Chief of the General Staff, on October 7, 1922. The church was renamed St. George's Memorial Church, in memory of those killed during the war.\nThe new church was opened on  May 11, 1924, by James Sweeny, Bishop of Toronto. Trumpeters from the Oshawa Civic Band heralded the opening. The church's tower and carillon were donated by Alice and Edgar Houston family in memory of Rebecca and Edward Carswell, Alice Houston's grandparents. The bells were cast at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry and shipped from England. The tower had to be reinforced to hold the weight of the bells, the largest weighting 2,400 kilograms (5,300 lb). The tower was dedicated on November 9, 1924, by Edward Bidwell, Bishop of Ontario. Many of the furnishing from the old church were donated to other Anglican churches in the city or used in the chapels of the new church.\nIn 1923, the Cowan family donated their home, constructed around 1858, located just north of the new church to be used a rectory. Known as Cowan House, the house served as the parish's rectory until 1968 and then as offices and nursery until 2021. The house was found to be beyond repair and sold in 2022. Despite protests from heritage advocates, Cowan House was demolished in September 2022.\nThe regimental colours of The Ontario Regiment (RCAC) were laid up in the church on Remembrance Day 1927.\nIn 1929, the Cowan family also donated a 3 manual Casavant Frères organ. This was replaced by another Casavant organ in 1966 and dedicated by Frederick Wilkinson, Bishop of Toronto.\nThe mortgage was burned and the church was consecrated on September 12, 1944, by Derwyn Owen, Archbishop of Toronto and Primate of All Canada.\nIn 1952, ground was broken on a new parish hall. The cornerstone was laid by Robert Renison, Archbishop of Moosonee and Metropolitan of Ontario. It was built in the same Credit Valley sandstone as the church. It was dedicated in 1953 by F. J. Sawers, Archdeacon of York. This replaced the earlier parish hall built in 1880.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nSt. George's Memorial Church was designed by Eden Smith in the Gothic Revival style. It is one of Smith's few surviving works outside Toronto. It is of white Credit Valley sandstone construction with white stone detailing. It has a Latin cross floor plan with north south transepts.\nThe interior features an oak beam ceiling and Indiana limestone arches and columns. The chancel furnishings, carved in oak, were another bequest from the Cowan family.\n\n\n== Services ==\nSt. George's is a high church Anglican church. It offers two services on Sunday mornings, a said Eucharist according to the Book of Common Prayer at 8:15 a.m. and a sung Eucharist at 10:00 a.m. Additionally, they say evening prayer on Wednesdays at 6:30 p.m. and offer a said Eucharist 10:00 a.m. on Thursdays. Choral evensong is sung three to four times per year.\n\n\n== List of rectors ==\nSince the parish was established in 1843, they have had fifteen rectors:\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Bruce Alrick Peterson is a cosmologist based at Mount Stromlo Observatory of the Australian National University. Peterson and James Gunn predicted the Gunn–Peterson trough, the absorption effect of neutral hydrogen on the spectra of quasars. His research includes studies of quasars, dark matter and the large-scale structure of the unvierse.\n\n\n== Childhood and education ==\nPeterson was born in 1941 in the United States. He was an undergraduate at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and obtained his PhD, \"A study of absorption and reddening using absolute magnitudes and colors of galaxies\", in 1969 under the supervision of Maarten Schmidt at Caltech.\n\n\n== Cosmologist ==\nPrior to obtaining his PhD, Peterson and James Gunn argued in 1965 that if the universe had a high enough density of neutral hydrogen atoms near a quasar, then almost all photons emitted by the quasar that are more energetic than the Lyman-alpha wavelength of 1216 angstroms should be absorbed by the neutral hydrogen. The effect, called the Gunn–Peterson trough, should yield zero emission at wavelengths shorter than 1216 angstroms (after shifting for redshift) in the observed spectrum of the quasar. The effect was detected in 2001 in a quasar at a redshift of 6.28.\nPeterson obtained a research position at Mount Stromlo Observatory at the Australian National University in Australia, where he continued research into quasars and the Stromlo-APM redshift survey. He played a major role in the MACHO Project that was conducted on a Mount Stromlo telescope to look for massive compact halo objects, a possible candidate for dark matter. Peterson was active in the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey, in identifications of gamma-ray bursts and in searches for high-redshift quasars.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nIn 2004, Peterson received a Thomson ISI Citation Laureate for his \"outstanding contribution to Space Sciences in Australia\". He had the highest number of citations among Australian astronomers for the period from 1980 to 2004: 176 papers cited 11039 times, according to Thomson ISI.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Joan of Arc, Sick, Interrogated in Prison by the Cardinal of Winchester is an oil on canvas painting by French painter Paul Delaroche, created in 1824. The painting depicts Joan of Arc as she is being interrogated by Cardinal Henry Beaufort, of Winchester, despite the fact that the event never happened. It is held at the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Rouen.\n\n\n== History and description ==\nAfter her capture by the English, Joan was delivered on January 3, 1431, to the French ecclesiastical justice. She was questioned by the Bishop of Beauvais, Pierre Cauchon, in order to confuse her about the religious justifications for her intervention in favor of the King of France. For two weeks, Joan maintained her arguments, while her health deteriorated. Delaroche replaced Cauchon with an ecclesiastic better known to the British public, Henry Beaufort, cardinal and bishop of Winchester, who is featured in William Shakespeare's play Henry VI.The painting represents three characters who stand out against a very dark background. Slightly off-center in the composition,  Beaufort is seated, dressed in a characteristic cardinal's outfit: he is wrapped in his cassock, with his mozzetta covering the upper body, and wearing the biretta. He fills the space with the red colour, which is the only mass of intense colour of the painting. Joan is seen bedridden, with her face tired, looking to above, like if asking God's help, and with her wrists chained, while her hands have crossed fingers, like in a prayer. The composition shows Joan huddled to the right of the painting, as if she feels crushed by the presence of her interrogator. A third character, standing in the darkness, holds an open book and takes notes of the minutes of the interrogation.The cardinal's gestures express the tension of the interrogation: one hand is clenched on the arm of his chair, the other extends his index finger imperatively, like pointing to Hell, his mouth is tense and he has a severe expression. His profile posture against a dark background highlights an aquiline nose and accentuates the hardness of his gaze.\nThe darkened atmosphere only allows a few decorative elements to be seen. The large stones of the wall represent the dungeon, the partly torn pallet spills a few strands of straw on the ground, and symbolizes Joan's fragility, or, for the viewer warned of her martyrdom, prefigures her pyre.Delaroche was inspired by English historical paintings created by Joshua Reynolds and his followers. He was aware of it through engravings. The pyramidal composition is based on a painting by James Northcote, where the Jesuit Feckenham questions Jane Grey. The positioning of the jailer on the left and the widening of the format reinforces the representation of the psychological tension between the interrogator and the accused.A smaller version of the same painting is held at the Wallace Collection, in London.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe painting was presented by Delaroche at the Paris Salon in 1824, where it was critically acclaimed. It received praise from Stendhal, who stated that it  would help make a name for its young author.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Danish Free Press Society (Danish: Trykkefrihedsselskabet) is a Danish non-partisan organisation founded in 2004 and originally led by Lars Hedegaard, that works in support of freedom of expression. It presents an annual award, the Sappho Award. The organisation has a publishing house, Trykkefrihedsselskabets Bibliotek, which focuses on research and criticism of Islam, and the organisation had about 800 members in 2010.\n\n\n== Background and activities ==\nThe organisation was founded in 2004 by Lars Hedegaard, David Gress, Kai Sørlander, Søren Krarup and Jesper Langballe, after Danish PEN objected to admit Hedegaard as a member due to his writings on Islam. The organisation published an online magazine, Sappho, that was edited by Helle Merete Brix and Katrine Winkel Holm. Winkel Holm took over as chairman of the organisation in 2014 after Hedegaard was subjected to an assassination attempt.\nIn 2009, the organisation reprinted the Muhammad cartoon drawn by Kurt Westergaard.\nThe organisation formerly counted Venstre politician Søren Pind and Conservative politician Naser Khader among its advisory board members, but both left the organisation in 2009 after controversial comments on Muslims by the chairman Lars Hedegaard.\nThe organisation was extended internationally with the International Free Press Society in 2009, and has been described as a part of the counter-jihad movement.\nThe Sappho Award has been awarded to people including Olga Romanova, Mark Steyn, Thilo Sarrazin, Ezra Levant, Roger Scruton and Tommy Robinson.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in English)",

        "content": "The Assembly of Independents (無所属の会, Mushozoku no Kai) was a political group in Japan. The group initially formed as the House of Councillors Club in November 1998, and renamed to become the Assembly of Independents in 1999. The party won five seats in the 2000 general election, exclusively in FPTP seats, but won nothing in the 2001 House of Councillors election. They fell to just one seat in the 2003 general election, and the party dissolved shortly after they won nothing in the 2004 House of Councillors election.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe main purpose of the group was not to become a new political party. Instead, it mainly functioned as a place for political independents to go, and also served as a haven for politicians who hadn't opted to join with any specific new party at the time, such as the Democratic Party of Japan, Liberal Democratic Party, Liberal Party, and more. As such, the group was not necessarily ideological in nature; it also governed differently from other parties, as there was no recruitment of party members or party membership system. Despite the lack of ideological nature, many of the politicians who joined the group were ultimately centrist or liberal splinters from the LDP or the now-gone New Frontier Party.\nThere were multiple reasons for the necessity of the group. Independents were disadvantaged in many ways even after the 1994 Japanese electoral reform established FPTP districts. These included:\n\nOverall disadvantage in elections due to lack of party behind candidate\nPolitical opinion broadcasts are not possible in single-seat constituencies as an independent\nUnable to put up posters as a political party due to lack of one\nFew allocations for street advertising vehicles, which is a mainstay of campaigning in Japan\nCannot accept political donations from corporations\nNot eligible for political party grants, where the national treasury subsidizes parties.\nThe group was formed to attempt to solve these issues for independents who wished to stay unbound to a party platform. Many of the politicians inside the group would go on to join the Democratic Party of Japan after the dissolution, with some rejoining the LDP.\n\n\n== Leaders ==\n\n\n== Election results ==\n\n\n=== House of Representatives ===\n\n\n== Notes ==",

The tower was originally built sometime during the 1870s by a local shepherd boy named William Buckle who watched the sheep on the Hill of Heddle.\n\n\n== History ==\nWilliam Buckle was a boy who lived in the village of Finstown, Orkney during the late 19th century, and around the age of 13 he was employed by the local farmer at Binscarth to watch over livestock on the Hill of Heddle. Watching livestock graze proved to be a tedious occupation for Buckle, and in his spare time he began constructing a stone tower, using drystone from the nearby quarry. Buckle left some stones jutting out of the tower to act as steps he used to climb the tower as it got taller, eventually breaking them off once the tower was complete. Buckle's Tower in later years was used as a sightline by sailors coming into the Bay of Firth.\nNearby, stands Wilson's Tower; a smaller, more recent stone tower closely resembling Buckle's Tower, built by James Wilson of Lavendale to celebrate the new millennium. Wilson began construction of his folly in 1999 and placed the final stone on the tower on 1 January 2000.\n\n\n== References ==",

The building was used as a post office until 1963, when it was donated to the city for use as a library.  The Phenix City–Russell County Library occupied the building until 1998 when a new, larger building was completed.  A private museum was operated in the building until 2017, when it was sold to the county.\nThe building is a one-story brick Colonial Revival structure, built in a similar style to other New Deal post offices.  It has a hipped roof and central cupola, with a five-bay façade.  The central entrance is slightly recessed, with Doric columns supporting an entablature and brick arch featuring a stone bald eagle.  On the inside, the mural Cotton, painted by Alabama artist John Kelly Fitzpatrick is on a wall of the postmaster's office.\nThe building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2021.\n\n\n== References ==",

The pieve's name derives from that in medieval times, it was measured to be located at the eighth mile of the Via Faventina (oggi Faentina); this was the ancien road that lead from Faenza across the Apennines toward Florence.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe inclusion into the substructure (crypt) of this church of Ancient Roman and paleo-Christian tombs is evidence that a place of worship was present here for centuries before the first mention of a church in documents from 909 AD. The church layout has three naves rising upon columns of either marble and granite, deriving from different sources and some of different sizes suggesting that they were derived a spolia from prior buildings. One column bears inscriptions from the era of the Roman emperor Valentinian II. The semicircular apse is the end of the central nave. The facade atypically faces south. The square bell tower rising to the right of the presbytery dates to about the year 1000. The crypts of the church underwent archeologic restoration during the 1990s leading to the discovery of a number of ancient burials.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Colonel Charles Blair Mayne (15 October 1855 – 17 October 1914) was an association footballer and British Army officer who played in the 1878 FA Cup final.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMayne was born in Madras, British India, in 1855, the son of Jasper and Amelia Mayne.\nHe passed the examinations for the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich in 1873, scoring the 12th highest mark - his future football team-mate Charles Haynes scored the 3rd highest. \n\n\n== Football career ==\nHe joined the Royal Engineers, which had one of the strongest football teams at the time, and made his debut for the Royal Engineers A.F.C. in a 7–0 win over Barnes at the Chatham Lines in October 1875; the match was played 10-a-side.\nHe was mostly a reserve player for his first two seasons of football, and did not play competitively until the 2nd round of the 1877–78 FA Cup, in a 5–0 win over Pilgrims.  He had generally played as a forward, but in the third round tie against the Druids, he had a one-off appearance in goal.  He had little to do as the Sappers had an easy 8–0 win, and in his next appearance - the quarter-final replay with Oxford University – he played as half-back, scoring the Sappers' equalizer in a 2–2 draw after the ball came out of a scrimmage.\nHe retained the position for the remaining Cup games, and scored the winner in the semi-final against the Old Harrovians with a \"well-directed kick\".  He was considered one of the Sappers' better players in the final against the Wanderers, but ended up on the losing side, the Wanderers winning 3–1.\nHis posting abroad prevented him from playing in any more competitive matches until 1882–83, and he featured as half-back (alongside Richard Ruck) in the Sappers' 3–1 win over Woodford Bridge for his only Cup match that season.  His final recorded match was as a full-back in the Sappers' final FA Cup tie, at Great Marlow in November 1884, which, in an indication of how football had moved on, ended 10–1 to the home side.\n\n\n== Army career ==\nHe took part in the Second Anglo-Afghan War in 1878–80.  After his active service was over, he became an army instructor; originally at the School of Military Engineering, and then becoming a professor at the Royal Military College of Canada in 1886, before returning to England to be the Assistant Inspector-General of Fortifications.  He returned to India from 1897 to 1899.\nHe also undertook duties as a lay preacher, and retired with the rank of Colonel in 1907.  He was an authority on field artillery, writing books such as Infantry Fire Tactics and Infantry Weapons And Their Use In War.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nHe married Victoria Moore in Frontenac, Ontario, Canada, on 6 April 1893.  \nMayne died on 17 October 1914, in Camberley, Surrey, leaving his estate to his widow.  The couple had two sons, both of whom were killed in the First World War; Jasper Mayne (of the Royal Field Artillery) in March 1915 and Victor Charles Moore Mayne (of the South Wales Borderers) in February 1916.  Their daughter Grace however lived until 1991.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"Tanta voglia di lei\" ('So much longing for her') is a 1971 song composed by Roby Facchinetti  and Valerio Negrini and performed by the Italian musical group Pooh.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe song had a troubled production, with various lyrics tested and dismissed, including a version titled \"La mia croce è lei\" ('My cross is her') with lyrics by Daniele Pace. Also, CBS initially preferred the B-side \"Tutto alle tre\" as A-side.  \n\n\n== Release ==\nThe single was released on 28 April 1971. It was the first Pooh song to top the Italian hit parade, and sold over 1 million and 200,000 copies, being certified gold disc. It entered the competition at the 1971 Cantagiro, and later took part in Festivalbar, where it ranked second behind Demis Roussos' \"We Shall Dance\". \n\n\n== Other versions ==\nPooh recorded  the song in English as \"I'll Close the Door Behind Me\" and in Spanish in various versions, notably \"Tantos deseos de ti\", \"Tantos deseos de ella\", \"Debes comprenderme\" and \"El verdarero amor\". Pooh's members Roby Facchinetti and Riccardo Fogli released solo versions of the song, while Dodi Battaglia recorded a new version in a duet with Gigi D'Alessio in his 2018 solo album Dodi Day. Artists who covered the song also include Pimpinela, José Luis Rodríguez, Bobby Valentín, Mar de Copas, Danny Rivera, Víctor Manuelle.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTanta voglia di lei at Discogs (list of releases)",

        "content": "The Editors Building, also known as the Kiplinger Building, is a historic office building located in Washington, D.C.. The ten-story structure was built between 1949 and 1950, and was originally constructed as the headquarters of the Kiplinger Washington Editors, a financial advice publishing firm based in the city. It was built by the D.C.-based architect Leon Chatelain Jr. and designed in the Stripped Classical style, featuring a mostly unornamented façade with significant vertical massing. W.M. Kiplinger, the business's founder, was an avid collector of D.C.-area memorabilia, and he displayed his 7,000-piece collection in the Editors Building's lobby, hallways, and offices.\nThe publishing agency kept its headquarters located in the building until selling it in 2011. The new owners kept the exterior intact while gutting the interior, and in 2013 it reopened as a Hampton Inn hotel. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe Editors Building was constructed of a frame made of steel and concrete and faced with limestone. In general, the building conforms to the classical column-like structure of base, shaft, and capital that was common of tall office buildings of the early part of the century, but differs from earlier examples in its more modern, less ornamented Stripped Classical design. It stands ten stories tall, and consists of a two-story base of five bays and an eight-story shaft with a seven-bay width. The base includes a central entrance which features recessed double doors made of bronze surrounded by a pink granite architrave decorated with rosettes and topped with a frieze containing the engraved words \"THE EDITORS BUILDING\" in sans-serif capitals.\nThe building's shaft is largely unornamented, with windows that are delineated vertically by the limestone walls and horizontally by spandrels made of pink granite. The result is one of emphasized verticality. In keeping with the design's muted style, the structure's capital is merely an attic of seven windows with a fluted cornice. The building's west-facing elevation consists of nine bays of windows set similarly to the front façade. The eastern side, however, was built with no windows as it was anticipated that later construction (what became the Matomic Operating Company building) would abut that elevation.\nThe building's vestibule and lobby were built with walls and floors made of Tennessee gray marble. Elevators in the lobby provided access to the rest of the building, including W.M. Kiplinger's office on the ninth floor, the publisher's envelope addressing machinery on the fourth, and a small bowling alley located in the basement.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1920, W.M. Kiplinger, a former journalist for the Associated Press, formed the Kiplinger Washington Agency in an attempt to bridge the information gap between investors on Wall Street and legislators in the nation's capital. Three years later he started the Kiplinger Washington Letter, a periodical aimed at providing commercial interests with insight into the workings of the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve. Subscriptions to the Letter increased steadily through the 1930s as the periodical served as a means for American businesses to understand the legislation and policies of the New Deal.\nThe agency's headquarters were located in the National Press Building, but with more than 200 employees by the 1940s, the company needed larger accommodations. Kiplinger acquired a site in Lafayette Square and received a $1 million permit for construction. The company hired Leon Chatelain Jr., a local architect responsible for many residential, commercial, and church buildings in the area, to design the new structure. Work began in 1949, and W.M. Kiplinger stayed involved with the process, becoming friendly with the construction staff and learning various jobs on site. A contemporary news report claimed that his work \"earned him 87 cents after union dues and Social Security.\" \nKiplinger had every person who worked on the structure put their signature on a large cloth which was later framed and hung in the building. Notable guests of the company, including Norman Rockwell, would later add their own signatures to the wall. Upon the building's completion in October 1950, Kiplinger held a party for the site's 800 laborers and gave each a silver dollar.\nSince the 1920s, Kiplinger had collected memorabilia related to the history of Washington, D.C. With a total of over 7,000 items, the collection was considered one of the largest of Washingtonia held privately. Kiplinger decorated the walls of the office building's lobby, hallways, and an exhibition room with much of the collection, and an archival room on site held more. New employees were allowed to visit the archives with a curator and choose pieces to display in their offices. The agency occasionally made exhibits of the collection available for public view in the building.\nThe company's continued expansion necessitated the construction of a second building at the end of the 1950s, this one located in the suburbs of D.C. One hundred employees remained in the Editors Building, and while the company leased some space there to other businesses, the Kiplinger Agency remained the primary tenant at the site into the 21st century. In 2011, the company moved to a Franklin Square location previously used by the Associated Press, and the following year the Editors Building was sold to a South Carolina-based developer.\nThe new owners performed a major renovation in order to convert the building into a Hampton Inn hotel. Other than an awning added to the entrance, the structure's exterior was kept largely intact, but the interior saw a near-complete overhaul. One area that was retained was Kiplinger's former ninth-floor office. The walnut-paneled room with fireplace and mantel was turned into a penthouse suite. The wall containing the signatures of the building's workforce and other guests was kept as well, and pieces of Kiplinger's art collection were kept on display in the hotel. In 2015, the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Washington, D.C.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Capanno Garibaldi (lit. 'Garibaldi's hut') is a hunting cabin 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) north of Ravenna, in the region of Emilia-Romagna, northern Italy, known for having sheltered Italian revolutionary Giuseppe Garibaldi on the night of 6–7 August 1849, during his escape from Italy after the fall of the short-lived Roman Republic.\nOriginally constructed in 1810, in the delta wetlands between Ravenna and Porto Corsini, the hut was rebuilt in 1834 and 1844. In 1879, the Capanno Garibaldi Conservation Society (Italian: Società Conservatrice del Capanno Garibaldi) was founded to preserve the hut's historical legacy. The hut was rebuilt after being damaged by a fire in 1911.\nThe Capanno Garibaldi features on regional tourist itineraries, especially those of Garibaldi's life, and hosts local celebrations for Garibaldi and the Risorgimento.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Construction and early years ===\nOn 5 January 1810, the Kingdom of Italy's director of state property granted Giuseppe Roncuzzi, a local priest, permission to build a hut, to be used as a hunting cabin within the Pontaccio swamp. The original hut, which came to be known as Il Pontaccio, was built with reeds and oak wood, plastered with clay. The hut is located 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) north of Ravenna, in the delta wetlands on the road to Porto Corsini.\nIn the decades following Roncuzzi's death in 1818, the hut passed through various local owners. On 20 September 1834, it was destroyed by a fire, after which it was rebuilt. In 1844, the hut was rebuilt with brick and limestone walls.\n\n\n=== Garibaldi's stay ===\nIn August 1849, following the collapse of the short-lived Roman Republic, revolutionary Giuseppe Garibaldi and his followers fled Rome while being chased by the Austrian Empire, an escape known as the Trafila Garibaldina. Having passed through San Marino, on his way to safety in Venice, several of Garibaldi's party were captured and executed in Comacchio. Garibaldi's wife, Anita, died on the journey on 4 August. With the Austrian party several kilometres behind Garibaldi, he could not stay for her burial.\nOn the night of 6–7 August, on the road from Comacchio to Ravenna, Garibaldi sheltered in Il Pontaccio with several disciples, including Giovanni Battista Culiolo. They broke into the locked hut. The following morning, one of Garibaldi's followers recruited a local man, Luigi Sanzani, nicknamed Mezzanotte (lit. 'Midnight'), to help the fugitives. Mezzanotte recognised Garibaldi and agreed to deliver a letter to the patriots in Ravenna, with whom Garibaldi's party had lost contact. Despite being questioned and beaten by Austrians on the road, Mezzanotte did not betray Garibaldi, and delivered the letter. Having reconnected with the patriots in Ravenna, Garibaldi's party left the Pontaccio to continue its journey at 7.30pm.\n\n\n=== Conservation ===\n\nOn 20 August 1867, an association called the Democratic Union (Italian: Unione Democratica) purchased the shed for 150 lire, with a view to preserving its history. The Democratic Union dissolved in 1874; in 1879, some former members founded a successor organisation, the Capanno Garibaldi Conservation Society (Società Conservatrice del Capanno Garibaldi).\nOn 29 March 1882, Primo Uccellini, who had collected soldiers' testimonies about Garibaldi's stay, passed away. Uccellini's death prompted Ravenna's municipal government to agree to purchase the Capanno Garibaldi on 5 October of the same year, culminating in the approval of the conservation society's statutes on 21 October.\nOn the night of 3–4 November 1911, the hut was set alight, partially destroying it. It was repaired according to the previous design, under the direction of the engineer Giovanni Baldini.\nThe hut's location in the river wetlands leaves it exposed to damage from natural elements. In 1975, after concern that the land was subsiding, the Capanno Garibaldi was raised by 125 centimetres (49 in). In 1981, the municipal government installed a stone embankment to protect the hut from waterside erosion. The driveway leading to the hut was raised by 65 centimetres (26 in) in 1998.\nIn 2023, the hut was listed by the regional government of Emilia-Romagna as part of the Case e studi delle persone illustri initiative, which recognises sites associated with the region's historical figures.\n\n\n== Architecture and layout ==\n\nThe hut's walls are made of stone, while its sloping roof is covered with reeds. Being susceptible to water infiltration, it requires regular reroofing, as occurred in 2007 (in collaboration with the Museo delle Civiltà Palustri of Villanova di Bagnacavallo) and 2021. Four memorial plaques commemorating the hut's history are affixed to the hut's façade. One of the inscriptions reads:\n\nThis sacred shack, that in 1849 saved Garibaldi the Liberator from the massacre of the Austrian Herodians and of Rome, the baptised Italians honour as that of Bethlehem of Nazareth.\nThe ground floor contains two rectangular rooms. The larger chamber, which measures 5.85 metres (19.2 ft) by 3.85 metres (12.6 ft), contains a fireplace and a wooden staircase leading to a wooden attic. The smaller room, which measures 4.15 metres (13.6 ft) by 2.65 metres (8.7 ft), was likely used to store hunting equipment.\nThe hut is accessed by a dirt road, with a concrete bridge connecting it to the via Baiona acqueduct. The concrete bridge dates to the 1970s, and replaced an earlier wooden bridge. In 1999, the bridge was raised to protect it from high tides.\nSince the 1970s, several pines, olive trees, and tamarisks have been planted in the surrounding land to enhance the hut's aesthetic appearance and protect it from the wind and summer sun.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\nAs of April 2024, the Capanno Garibaldi is open to visitors with free entry between mid-March and November. It features on regional tourist itineraries, especially those of Garibaldi's life.\nThe hut hosts local historical celebrations for Garibaldi and the Risorgimento, including the Festa della Repubblica on 2 June, the date of Garibaldi's death. Since 2010, the Capanno Garibaldi has hosted a toast to Garibaldi each New Year's Eve, completed with panettone and mulled wine. The event begins with a torchlight procession from the bridge leading to the hut.\nThe hut was included in Charles Yriarte's travel guide De Ravenna à Otrante (1877). Artists who have painted, illustrated, or engraved the Capanno Garibaldi include Norberto Pazzini, Vittorio Guaccimanni, and Orazio Toschi.\nGaribaldi's stay at the hut is mentioned in Luigi Orsini's 1921 poem La morte di Anita:\n\nThat Brave One erred, broken by the elementswithin the Forest that holds so muchmystery of leaves and strange enchantments.Short was the stay which protected the ruggedCapanno, good for hosting that Great One,between the lonely and bare walls.The Capanno Garibaldi was among the first monuments to be modelled for Italia in Miniatura, a miniature park in Viserba founded in 1968 by a plumber from Ravenna.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Shigeru Nambara (南原繁) was a Japanese political scientist, who served as the president of the University of Tokyo and the Japan Academy, and as a member of the House of Peers.\n\n\n== Life ==\nNambara was born on 5 September 1889 into a family that ran a sugar production company in Minamino, Kagawa. After studying at the First Higher School, he matriculated at Tokyo Imperial University, where he studied political science. After graduating in 1914, he passed the high-class bureaucrat recruitment examination and began working for the Home Ministry. During his seven-year career as a bureaucrat, he served as a provincial governor in Toyama for two years and initiated a large irrigation project there. He also drafted the Act of Labour Union in 1919, but it never reached the National Diet. He returned to his alma mater in 1921 and became an assistant professor.\nDuring World War II, he published a book titled Nation and Religion: a Study of European Spiritual History, dedicating a chapter to the criticism of Nazi ideology, which was Japan's major ally at the time. He became the dean of the Faculty of Law in March 1945. Partly due to his scepticism against the country's pre-war ideology and his anti-war stance, he was elected president of the university in December 1945, four months after Japan's surrender. As the first post-war president of the university, he oversaw its transition to a more modern and democratic institution. Under his leadership, the university admitted its first female students, established the university co-op and the University of Tokyo Press, and revitalised the university's athletic culture. \nDuring this period, he also served as a member of the House of Peers, where a few seats were reserved for scholars alongside the majority held by hereditary peers. As a member, he opposed signing a peace treaty solely with Western democracies, arguing that in the event of a war between the Western and Eastern blocs, it could lead to catastrophic results. When he visited the United States for the first time after the war in 1949 to attend a conference on education organised by the Home Secretary, he shared this view with Dwight Eisenhower, then president of Columbia University. This enraged Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida, a staunch supporter of signing a peace treaty only with Western powers, who labelled him 'a wicked scholar who is willing to distort knowledge to ingratiate with the masses (曲学阿世の輩)'. \nHe later became the president of the Japan Academy and the Gakushikai, the official alumni club of the former Imperial Universities. He was posthumously awarded the Order of the Rising Sun, 1st Class and the Junior Second Rank.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"Pensiero\" ('Thought') is a 1971 song composed by Roby Facchinetti  and Valerio Negrini and performed by the Italian musical group Pooh.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe music of the song was composed by Roby Facchinetti with the intent of being performed chorally  by all members of the group.  Against the will of their producer and their record company, the lyrics deal with social criticism and tell the story of a man unjustly imprisoned. The tensions between the producer Giancarlo Lucariello and the drummer and lyricist Valerio Negrini eventually led to Negrini leaving the group (even if keeping on collaborating with them as lyricist) and being replaced by Stefano D'Orazio. \n\n\n== Release ==\nThe single was released on 28 September 1971 and it  was the second Pooh single in a row to top the Italian hit parade. It sold over 850,000 copies. \nPooh also recorded the song in Spanish as \"Pensamiento\". In 1998, Negrini and Facchinetti sued for plagiarism Alanis Morissette for the song  \"Mary Jane\", eventually losing the case.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPensiero at Discogs (list of releases)",

One-half of the 32 members of Hastings Borough Council in East Sussex will be elected.\n\n\n== Background ==\nHasting historically been controlled by all 3 major parties. The Conservatives first won a majority in 1976, but lost the council to no overall control in 1980. The Liberal Democrats won control in 1996, with the Conservatives having lost all their seats on the council the previous year. The Labour Party won control of the council 2 years later, and held a majority until 2002, with the Conservatives retaking the council in 2006. Labour gained the council in 2010, and controlled the council until 2022. \nIn 2022, Labour won 9 seats (down 3) with 42.1% of the vote, the Conservatives won 4 with 29.6%, and the Green Party won 3 (up 3) with 23.5%. Following this election, Labour formed a majority coalition with the Green Party, but later formed a minority administration after the Greens withdrew from the coalition. Labour lost their position as the largest group on the council in December 2023, after the resignation of 8 councillors from Labour and the suspension of another. A minority coalition of the Green Party and the 8 who left Labour was then formed, with a Green Party leader.\nThe seats up for election in 2024 were last contested in 2021; because of the delay of all local elections due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the seats are up for election after 3 years rather than the usual 4. In that election, the Conservatives won 8 seats (up 4) with 40.7% of the vote, Labour won 7 (down 5) with 37.6%, and the Green party won 1 (up 1) with 16.3%\n\n\n== Previous council composition ==\n\nChanges:\n\nApril 2023: Lucian Fernando leaves Conservatives to sit as an independent\nMay 2023: Lucian Fernando (independent) joins Reform UK\nOctober 2023: John Rankin leaves Conservatives to sit as an independent\nDecember 2023: Paul Barnett, Andy Batsford, John Cannan, Maya Evans, Ali Roark, Nigel Sinden, Mike Turner, and Simon Willis leave Labour to sit as independents; Sabina Arthur suspended from Labour\nJanuary 2024: Claire Carr leaves Green Party to sit as an independent\n\n\n== Summary ==\n\n\n=== Candidates by party ===\n\n\n=== Election result ===\n\n\n== Candidates ==\nAn asterisk (*) indicates an incumbent councillor.\n\n\n=== Ashdown ===\n\n\n=== Baird ===\n\n\n=== Braybrooke ===\n\n\n=== Castle ===\n\n\n=== Central St Leonards ===\n\n\n=== Conquest ===\n\n\n=== Gensing ===\n\n\n=== Hollington ===\n\n\n=== Maze Hill ===\n\n\n=== Old Hastings ===\n\n\n=== Ore ===\n\n\n=== Silverhill ===\n\n\n=== St Helens ===\n\n\n=== Tressell ===\n\n\n=== West St Leonards ===\n\n\n=== Wishing Tree ===\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sir William David Thomson  (29 June 1843 – 13 November 1909) was an Irish surgeon. He was the brother-in-law of the novelist Bram Stoker.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nThomson was born at Downpatrick, Ireland, on 29 June 1843, was youngest son (in a family of three sons and two daughters) of William Thomson of Lanark, Scotland, by his wife Margaret, daughter of Thomas Patterson of Monklands, Lanarkshire. His father died in Thomson's infancy, and his mother married Mr. McDougal, proprietor of the 'Galway Express' newspaper. While a lad he worked in the editorial office of this paper, and in 1864, without giving up his journalistic work, he entered as a student of Queen's College, Galway, then a constituent college of the Queen's University. He graduated B.A. in 1867. Having obtained a post on the Dublin 'Daily Express,' Thomson began to attend lectures at the Carmichael School of Medicine, and in 1872 he graduated M.D. and M.Ch. of the Queen's University, receiving the hon. M.A. in 1881, and in 1874 he became F.R.C.S. Ireland.\nOn obtaining his medical degrees he became house surgeon to the Richmond Hospital, Dublin, and demonstrator of anatomy in the Carmichael School. Next year he was elected visiting surgeon to the Richmond Hospital, a post he held to his death. In 1873 he was also appointed lecturer in anatomy in the Carmichael School. In 1882 he became the first general secretary of the newly formed Royal Academy of Medicine in Ireland, his principal duty being to edit its 'Transactions.' From 1896 to 1906 he was direct representative of the Irish medical profession on the General Medical Council. From 1896 to 1898 he was president of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, and in 1897 was knighted. In December 1899 he was invited by Lord Iveagh to organise a field hospital for service in South Africa. In February 1900 he set out and accompanied Lord Roberts in his march to Pretoria. He proved his powers of rapid organisation by establishing, immediately on entering that capital, a hospital of 600 beds in the Palace of Justice, and it was in great part due to him and his colleagues that Pretoria escaped the outbreak of enteric fever which proved disastrous elsewhere. Lord Roberts mentioned his services in despatches. He returned home in November 1900, and he and his colleagues were entertained at a public banquet at the Royal College of Surgeons, Dublin (24 Nov.).\nWhile in South Africa he was appointed surgeon in ordinary to Queen Victoria in Ireland, and in 1901 he became honorary surgeon to King Edward VII. For his services in the South African war he was mentioned in despatches and received the Queen's medal with three clasps. He was also made C.B. From 1895 to 1902 he was surgeon to the lord-lieutenant, Earl Cadogan. He was from 1906 to his death inspector of anatomy for Ireland. Thomson was a surgeon of considerable ability. In 1882 he ligatured the innominate artery, and published an important paper on the subject. In later years he devoted attention to the surgery of the geni to -urinary organs, and was the first among Dublin surgeons to remove an enlarged prostate. He wrote clearly and well, and edited several books, notably the third edition of Power's 'Surgical Anatomy of the Arteries' (1881), and Christopher Fleming's 'Diseases of the Genito-Urinary Organs’ (1877), as well as the 'Transactions of the Royal Academy of Medicine in Ireland’ from 1882 to 1896. For several years he acted as Dublin correspondent to the 'British Medical Journal.' In 1901 he delivered the address in surgery at the annual meeting of the British Medical Association held at Cheltenham, choosing as his subject 'Some Surgical Lessons from the South African Campaign' (British Medical Journal, 1901, vol. ii.). His most notable publication was an exhaustive and judicial report on the poor law medical service of Ireland, undertaken in 1891 at the request of Ernest Hart, editor of the 'British Medical Journal.' The report must form the basis of any inquiry into, or reform of, the poor law medical service. As an organiser, Thomson was at his best. He had a large share in the reorganisation of the school of the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland during 1880–90, and in the organisation of the Royal Academy of Medicine in Ireland, formed in 1882 by the amalgamation of several old societies, whose interests and aims were not always concordant.\nThomson, who was a polished speaker and ready debater, died at his residence, 54 St. Stephen's Green, Dublin, on 13 November 1909. He was buried at Mount Jerome cemetery, Dublin. A mural tablet was erected in the Richmond Hospital, to commemorate his thirty-six years' services as surgeon, and his share in the rebuilding of the hospital in 1899. He married on 27 June 1878 Margaret Dalrymple, younger daughter of Abraham Coates Stoker, chief clerk in the office of the chief secretary, Dublin Castle, and sister of Sir William Thornley Stoker, first baronet, surgeon, and of Bram Stoker, novelist. He left a son and daughter.\n\n\n== References ==\nSpecific\n\nGeneral\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Rowlette, Robert James (1912). \"Thomson, William (1843-1909)\".

        "content": "Freedom (Italian: Libertà), sometimes referred to as the Freedom Front (Italian: Fronte della Libertà), is a populist electoral list in Italy founded by Cateno De Luca, mayor of Taormina. The list, which includes several regionalist, Eurosceptic, and populist minor parties, was launched in March 2024 in Rome, with the aim of taking part in the 2024 European Parliament election in Italy.\n\n\n== History ==\nFreedom was officially launched by Cateno De Luca and former minister Roberto Castelli on 7 March 2024. On 31 March 2024, the Northern People's Party, led by Castelli, which was the first party to join the coalition, left the coalition, officially due to possible legal problems between a list within the list and another political force with the same name, Italexit, which accused of using its name improperly.\nAfter weeks of close negotiations, an agreement with Sovereign and Popular Democracy (DSP) also fell through on 15 March 2024. The anti-establishment and Eurosceptic party led by Marco Rizzo refused the alliance due to disagreements with De Luca and the presence of some autonomist lists in the coalition. At the same time, Independence, a sovereignist and Eurosceptic movement led by Gianni Alemanno, also decided not to join the coalition. Alemanno labeled De Luca's proposal as \"too moderate on European Union and neoliberalism\".\n\n\n== Composition ==\n\n\n== Leadership ==\n\n\n=== Leader ===\nCateno De Luca (2024–present)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Komtar station is a proposed light rail transit and monorail station complex located in Komtar, at the intersection of Magazine Road, Carnavon Street, and Tek Soon Street, in George Town, Penang. The station is projected to become a major terminal and interchange station of the Mutiara line, the Tanjong Tokong line, and the Ayer Itam line. It has connections towards the terminal of a proposed tram system in George Town, and the Komtar Bus Terminal, which serves as the primary public bus terminal serving Penang Island.\nThe station complex is planned next to the Sia Boey Urban Archaeological Park, as part of the fifth phase of development in Komtar. Once completed, it is expected to become the main rail station in George Town. Besides this, the station is part of the western end of an elevated link across the Penang Strait towards the Penang Sentral station in Seberang Perai. Construction is expected to start in September or October 2024, and will be completed by 2030, in line with the completion of the Mutiara line.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe site of the Komtar station was previously part of the historic Sia Boey Market, which emerged in 1806 as one of the busiest street markets in central George Town. During the initial planning of the Penang Urban Centre between 1969 and 1970, the site around Sia Boey Market was designated for demolition and replacement under the project's fifth phase of development. After the project evolved into Komtar, the land which the market stood upon was sold in July 1991 for RM31 million, although no progress was done, despite plans for a mixed retail, office, and residential development set for construction in 1995 or 1996.\n\n\n=== Planning ===\nIn 2002, the Penang state government repurposed Sia Boey Market into a centralised transportation hub, with a terminal of a proposed light rail transit line in Penang Island, a precursor to the present Mutiara line. In 2004, anticipating the construction of the transit line, Sia Boey Market closed permanently. However, the project stalled and was never revived to its previous state. In 2012, the site was planned for the construction of an arts district known as the Penang Heritage Square, but progress halted when the arts district was relocated to Macallum Street Ghaut nearby to make way for another integrated transport hub. This revival did not succeed, and by the mid-2010s the project stalled again due to funding concerns and political opposition from the federal government.\nThe introduction of the Penang Transport Master Plan (PTMP) in 2015 designated the Komtar station as a major interchange station and terminal of several proposed light rail transit and monorail routes. It functions as the terminus station of the Mutiara line, the Tanjong Tokong line, Ayer Itam line, and the George Town tram line. Further redesigns of the Mutiara line made the Komtar station the western end of an elevated rail bridge across the Penang Strait towards a station at Penang Sentral at Seberang Perai. Construction of the station and the Mutiara line were delayed repeatedly, with the most recent date of construction set at September or October 2024, with an estimated completion date of 2030.\n\n\n== Layout ==\n\n\n=== Rail services ===\nThe Komtar station is proposed to be served by the following rail lines:\n\n\n=== Connections ===\nThe Komtar station is proposed to be connected to the following stations:\n\n George Town tram line (western terminus): Eastbound towards Carnavon Street\n Rapid Penang public bus terminal (Komtar Bus Terminal): 101, 102, 103, 104, 201, 201*, 202, 203, 204, 206, 301, 302, 303, 304, 306, 401E, 502, CAT, CAT14\n\n\n== References ==",

Apparently, she was from the family of Frédérique Émilie Auguste O'Connell, or the granddaughter of Daniel O'Connell.\nIn her youth, she studied in Andrei\nAfanasievich Egorov's studio.\nO'Connell studied at the School of the Society for the Encouragement of the Arts from 1907. After graduating in 1914, she became a teacher at the school and worked principally in the field of ceramic art.: 189  She studied further abroad in Italy, France, Germany and Hungary.\nO'Connell had many connections in the circle of the Mir iskusstva movement, and her first paintings were heavily influenced by those artists, such as Alexandre Benois.\nAt the end of 1912, O'Connell entered a common law marriage with Mir iskusstva member Ivan Bilibin (although Bilibin was still legally married to his first wife, Maria Chambers).: 189  Bilibin was 15 years her senior, and together they travelled around the Crimean peninsula to draw. \nThe relationship struggled due to Bilibin's drinking. The couple entered an agreement, witnessed by their friend musician Stepan Stepanovich Mitusov, that if Bilibin did not drink for a year, then O'Connell would stay with him. Bilibin did not keep his word, and O'Connell left Bilibin in September 1917, with Bilibin travelling to Crimea alone following the events of the Russian Revolution.: 195 \nMitusov wrote a comic poem about the breakdown of the couple's relationship.\nAfter her relationship with Bilibin had ended, O'Connell married mining engineer Sergei Nikolaevich Mikhailovsky. They had two children, a daughter and a son, and Mikhailovsky died in 1927.\nFrom 1922 to 1932, O'Connell-Mikhailovskaya was engaged to the workshops of the Leningrad Porcelain Factory, where she worked as a porcelain artist. In 1928, O'Connell's work was exhibited at the Soviet Porcelain and Posters exhibition in Paris.\nIn 1932, O'Connell-Mikhailovskaya had a brief relationship with Daniil Kharms.\nIn 1941, O'Connell-Mikhailovskaya's last exhibition took place, where her paintings on porcelain and ceramics were mainly presented.\nDue to her foreign origin, O'Connell-Mikhailovskaya was exiled to Siberia until 1953. She left her teenage son in the care of one her friends in Leningrad. As soon as the opportunity arose, she sent for her son to live with her in exile. However, during one of the stops on the train on the way to meet his mother, he drowned while swimming in a river.\nO'Connell-Mikhailovskaya's daughter died during the Siege of Leningrad, as did her former partner Bilibin.\nWhile in exile, O'Connell-Mikhailovskaya married a German doctor.\nIn the late 1940s and early 1950, O'Connell-Mikhailovskaya worked at ZIK.\nO'Connell-Mikhailovskaya died in 1981.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===",

        "content": "The Buratha Mosque (Arabic: جامع براثا) is a historic Shi'ite place of worship in the Karkh district of Baghdad, Iraq. It is an important holy site for the Twelver Shi'ites. The mosque was allegedly built in the 7th century over an old Nestorian Christian monastery, and it is now located at least five kilometres away from the Al-Kadhimiya Mosque.\n\n\n== History ==\nLocal tradition ascribes the construction of the mosque to be in the 7th century. The traditional account states that the mosque was formerly a monastery for the Nestorian Christians, managed by a monk named Hebar. When Hebar met with Ali ibn Abi Talib, he accepted Islam and converted the monastery into an Islamic place of worship. The mosque in that form existed until the 10th century, when the Abbasid Caliph Al-Radi ordered the demolition of the mosque as an attack against the Shi'ite communities. After the mosque was demolished, locals complained of the matter to the governor of Baghdad, whom rebuilt the mosque and inscribed the name of the Caliph Al-Radi there to prevent it from being demolished.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nRenovations to the mosque happened in the years 1659 and 1933. In 1955, the mosque was completely rebuilt with local efforts, and two new minarets were introduced to the structure.\n\n\n== Religious significance ==\n\nThe Buratha Mosque is a significant holy place for Twelver Shi'ites due to its association with Ali ibn Abi Talib. It is narrated in Shi'ite holy books that Ali rested here after a fight with the Khawarij. Another miraculous event reported by the Shi'ites is that Ali struck a stone in the floor of the mosque, which revealed a fresh spring.\n\n\n=== Christian significance ===\nSome have believed that the rock in the mosque belongs to the Virgin Mary. It is also believed that Patriarch Abraham and subsequent Patriarchs after him prayed at the site, and one of such Patriarchs is buried in the mosque.\n\n\n== 2006 bombing ==\n\nIn 2006, three suicide bombers, two out of three disguised as women, detonated themselves in the mosque compound, leaving 85 dead and 160 wounded. The attack was also a targeted attack against the Iraqi politician Jalaluddin al-Saghir, who was present in the mosque at the time as its main preacher. However, Saghir was not harmed by the attacks.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of mosques in Iraq\nList of mosques in Baghdad\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Taivoan Night Ceremony (Taivoan: Taai, Taa) is one of the most important annual ceremonial rituals of the Taivoan, a plain indigenous people in Taiwan. It is held on September 15th of the lunar calendar in various Taivoan communities such as Siaolin and Rauron in Kaohsiung, and Dazhuang in Hualien. Additionally, the Liuchongxi community in Tainan conducts it a day earlier on September 14th, and the Liouguei community in Kaohsiung holds the ceremony on October 6th.\nThe Taivoan Night Ceremony in Liuchongxi, along with four other Siraya Night Ceremonies in Tainan — Beitouyang, Kabuasua, Fuxing Palace, and Danei Toushe – are collectively known as the \"Five Night Ceremonies\" in the Tainan area.\n\n\n== Origin ==\nThe Anping County Miscellaneous Records (安平縣雜記) written in the late Qing dynasty has arguably the earliest and the most complete of the Night Ceremony of the Taivoan people, related to the ritual Khui-Hiàng:According to their customs, every year, the restriction period is set from the 15th day of the third month, Kìm-Hiàng (禁向, literally \"the Period of Restriction\"), to the 15th day of the ninth month, Khui-Hiàng (開向, literally \"the Period of Permission\"), in the lunar calendar. [...] At that time, regardless of whether it was the period of restriction or permission, it was customary to kill a person as an offering, beheading and scraping the bones for sacrifice. However, when the Qing government became aware of this practice, they issued a decree strictly forbidding it, permitting only hunting of animals and prohibiting the killing of people. Since then, only the unassimilated indigenous people continued the practice of human sacrifice, while the assimilated indigenous people solely hunted animals. Following the Period of Restriction, both men and women had to focus on farming, without engaging in hunting, dancing, or singing, and they were also not allowed to marry, although engagements were permitted. If these prohibitions were violated, the family's entire crop yield was doomed to failure. After the Period of Permission began, hunting, dancing, singing, and marrying were allowed.According to the records, the Taivoan Night Ceremony is related to the restriction and permission of daily activities like hunting, dancing, singing, and marriage. As it's common for Taiwanese indigenous people to practice hunting in winter,  the Night Ceremony could be the effort for the people to main the life philosophy of living in harmony with the universe and all beings.\n\n\n== Cultural significance ==\n\n\n=== The Shrine ===\n\nThe Public Hall or the Shrine (Taivoan: Kuba; Taiwanese: Kong-kài) of the Taivoan, currently used for rituals, houses Kogitanta Agisen, the seat of the spirits, representing the presence of the highest ancestral spirits of Taivoan. \n\n\n=== Erecting the Ritual Bamboo ===\n\nIn Taivoan communities like Siaolin and Alikuan, the Malubiw or the erection of the Ritual Bamboo is a ritual conducted in the afternoon of the Night Ceremony.  To prepare for this ritual, an elder from the family responsible for the Ritual Bamboo chooses a long thorny bamboo with its tip facing east ahead of the Night Ceremony. In the early morning of the ceremony, men from this family follow the elder to the bamboo site, cut it down, and bring it back to the ritual site. The tips of the Ritual Bamboo are left intact with thin bamboo and bamboo leaves, and a bundle of thatch is then tied to them, symbolizing the head of the enemy in the past. Seven evenly spaced bundles of thatch are also tied along the bamboo body, representing ladders for the seven Highest Ancestral Spirits to descend to the ritual site from the heaven. \nIn the afternoon, the indigenous people dig a hole at a designated spot and erect the Ritual Bamboo together. After the bamboo is erected, bamboo cannons are lit, marking the beginning of the ceremony. \n\n\n=== Worshiping the Highest Ancestral Spirits ===\n\nThe Taivoan people prepare offerings such as mai (sticky rice cake), mochi, wine-cooked chicken soup, betel nuts, joss paper, wine, cigarettes, pork, etc., for sacrifice at the Public Hall.\n\nDuring the sacrifice, the elders chant ancient songs, \"Panga\" (also known as the Song of Offerings or \"O I Hei\") and \"Taboro\", to report the sacrificial offerings to the Highest Ancestral Spirits. Some of the lyrics are as follows:Ho i he, rarom mahanru ho i he, rarom taipanga ho i he.\nHo i he, hahu mahanru ho i he, hahu taipanga ho i he.\nHo i he, hana mahanru ho i he, hana taipanga ho i he.\nHo i he, i saviki mahanru ho i he, saviki taipanga ho i he.\nHo i he, i luku mahanru ho i he, tuku taipanga ho i he.\nHo i he, agagang mahanru ho i he, agagang taipanga ho i he.\nHo i he, i tamaku mahanru ho i he, tamaku taipanga ho i he.\nHo i he, babuy mahanru ho i he, babuy taipanga ho i he.\nHo i he, takuka mahanru ho i he, takuka taipanga ho i he.\nHo i he, mapuli mahanru ho i he, mapuli taipanga ho i he.\n\nHo i he, tao mahanru ho i he, tao taipanga ho i he.\n\n\n== Songs ==\n\nAccording to the scholar Lin Ch'ing-ts'ai (2000), the current ritual songs of the Night Ceremony of various Taivoan communities are similar to some of the Siraya communities' ritual songs. However, their origin lies in the songs of the Taivoan communities in the Yujing Basin. Over the past several hundred years, as the Taivoan people migrated, these songs spread to areas such as Liuchongxi in Tainan, the mountain regions of Kaohsiung, and the Huadong Valley, and eventually to the Siraya communities.\nBased on field research by Lin Ch'ing-ts'ai and anthropologist Pan Ing-hai, around 1922, the Highest Ancestral Spirit of the Danei Toushe community in Tainan helped a resident, Yang Wang, win a lawsuit. To fulfill the vow, Yang, through his wife Mao Lai-chih (a Taivoan medium of the Kaohsiung Rauron community), visited Rauron and learned the local \"Indigenous Dance\", and brought it back to Toushe to teach the villagers, recording it in Mandarin phonetics, spreading the Taivoan ritual songs to Siraya communities.\nIn 1915, the outbreak of the Tapani Incident in Kaohsiung led some of the Rauron Taivoan people to flee to Liuchongxi, where the ritual songs were once again spread to the Liuchongxi community.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTaivoan people\nKong-kài\n\n\n== Reference ==",

        "content": "The Russell County Courthouse at Seale is a historic building in Seale, Alabama.  In 1866, Seale was chosen as the new seat of Russell County.  The new courthouse was completed in 1869, and wings were added in 1908.  After the merger of Girard and Phenix City in 1923, there was pressure to move the seat to the much larger, but not centrally located Phenix City.  Phenix City became the seat in 1935, but the Seale courthouse remained in use as an branch until 1943.  It was used for various civic functions through 1958, but became vacant and fell into disrepair until its renovation in the mid-1970s.  Today it is again used for civic functions and a museum of natural history.\nThe two-story Neoclassical building is constructed of red brick.  The façade has a full height portico, with Doric columns supporting the pediment.  A small balcony is above the entrance.  The windows have flat arches with keystones.\nThe courthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Office of the Prime Minister, officially Presidency of the Government (Spanish: Presidencia del Gobierno) is the Spanish government structure that groups all the departments and officials that are at the service of the prime minister to fulfil its constitutional duties. It is staffed by a mix of career civil servants and advisers. The highest-ranking official within the Office is the Chief of Staff, which is a political appointment on which the rest of the Office officials depend.\nThe Office of the Prime Minister, although in the past it was a ministerial department, like any other Ministry, Today it does not have a specific legal definition, although its existence is foreseen on the Legal Regime of the Public Sector Act of 2015, when it regulates the Ministries.\nEstablished in 1834, the 1851 General State Budget elevated it to the rank of Ministry, a situation that would last until 1974, when the Ministry of the Presidency was created. Since then, it no longer has the rank of ministry, although its structure and functions are established by a royal decree, and it operates as one.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins and ministerial rank ===\nThe history of the Presidency of the Government dates back to 1834. On this date, the Royal Statute was promulgated, creating for the first time an executive power differentiated but not separated from the Crown, led by the prime minister (at that time called the president of the Council of Ministers). From this moment, a series of officials were appointed and a series of offices were established to assist the chief executive, which gave rise to the \"Presidency of the Council of Ministers\".\nThese personnel assisting the prime minister were assigned to the Ministry of State, since in the first years of the Spanish constitutionalism the president of the Council of Ministers was also secretary or minister of State. In 1851, for the first time, a specific budgetary item —titled \"Expenses of the Secretariat and Presidency of the Council of Ministers\" — was established, within the section of the Ministry of State; and later a section of its own would be created. That same year, the importance of the Presidency continued to increase, granting it powers over some matters related to overseas territories —except for matters related to the Treasury, War and Navy— and creating the Directorate-General for Overseas and the Overseas Council, both assigned to the Presidency of the council, and was given its own structure and budget, which for the year 1853 amounted to 1.7 million reales. It also managed the General Archive of the Indies and the General Superintendence of Finance of the Indies.\n\nIn 1854 the Overseas responsibilities were transferred to the Ministry of State, maintaining only a secretariat. In 1856 the Statistical Commission of the Kingdom was created and attached to the Presidency. During the next few years, a large part of its allocation corresponded to statistical services, with a budget of 3.5 million reales in 1859 or 11.6 million in 1860, leaving only 170,000 reales for personnel and material resources of the Presidency. From this decade it also assumed the assignment of the Council of State, an advisory body headed by the prime minister, and in 1870 the statistical, geographical and cadastral powers definitively transferred to the Ministry of Development.\nFrom 1865 to 1870 several reforms were made to the Office of the Prime Minister to resemble a ministerial department, including the creation of an undersecretariat.\nIn 1871 the Presidency was moved to a central property in Madrid, known as Casa de los Heros, and it was established a new budgetary item for the conservation and maintenance of the building. Likewise, that same year, on January 26, the Archive of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers (today of the Government) was created, which today also acts as the Central Archive of the Ministry of the Presidency. During the brief First Republic, between 1873 and 1874, it was called the \"Presidency of the Executive Branch of the Republic\", maintaining structure and powers.\n\nThe economic protectionism that was imposed in Spain in the last decades of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, led to the approval of the Law of 14 February 1907, which established that only national products could be purchased by the Public Administrations. To ensure compliance with the law, the Commission for the Protection of National Production was established, which was attached to the Presidency. Likewise, in 1914, the Office of the Civil Comptroller for War and Navy and for the Protectorate of Morocco was created in this department.\n\n\n=== 20th century changes ===\nDuring the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera, various changes occurred. On the one hand, in December 1925 the Undersecretariat of the Presidency was abolished (until 1930) and the Directorate-General for Morocco and Colonies was created. On the other hand, in 1928 the Ministry of State was integrated into the Presidency, and the department was renamed to \"Presidency and Foreign Affairs\". It didn't last long; With the fall of the dictator in 1930, the departments were reestablished as they were at the beginning of the dictatorship.\nDuring the Second Republic, more powers were added to the Presidency, regarding population and land organization through the Parceling and Colonization Section of the Directorate-General for Social Action and in aeronautical matters, with a Directorate-General for Aeronautics.\nAfter the Civil War and the dictatorship was imposed, in 1939 it was renamed as \"Presidency of the Government\" —linked to the Head of State—, a name that continues to this day. During the first years, some organizations attached to the Presidency were created to control some industries, such as the Government Delegation in the Steel Industries, the Railway Material Commissariat or the Delegation for Transport Planning, among others. In 1942, the Directorate-General for Morocco, which had been in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs since 1939, returned to the Presidency.\n\nAfter the appointment of Luis Carrero Blanco as Under Secretary of the Presidency in 1941, this body became a key piece of the regime, with Carrero Blanco being the dictator's right hand. So much so, that in 1951 the position was given the rank of minister, being the seed of the current Ministry of the Presidency that today assists the prime minister and the collective bodies of the Government.\nDuring the decades of 1950 and 1960, the Minister-Under Secretary of the Presidency was the promoter of the administrative reforms. In 1957 the Official State Gazette was assigned to him, the Office for Coordination and Economic Programming was created in the field of the Technical General Secretariat and the powers regarding civil servants were centralized, with the creation of the Centre for Training and Improvement of Civil Servants (in 1958, currently National Institute of Public Administration), the Higher Personnel Commission and the Directorate-General for the Civil Service.\nIn 1968, a series of decrees were approved that reorganized the services of the Presidency, establishing six management bodies —Undersecretariat, Commissariat for the Economic and Social Development Plan, Technical General Secretariat, Directorate-General for the Civil Service and the Directorate-General for the Geographic and Cadastral Institute—, five consultative and advisory bodies —Council of State, Council of National Economy, Higher Personnel Commission, Advisory Commission for Scientific and Technical Research and Commission for Income and Prices—, three organizations autonomous bodies—National Industry Institute, the National School of Public Administration and the Official State Gazette—and six other organizations of different categories.\n\n\n=== Ministry of the Presidency and loss of ministerial rank ===\nIn 1973, the dictator decided to separate the Presidency of the Government from the Head of State, appointing Luis Carrero Blanco as prime minister. Also, in January 1974 the position of Minister-Undersecretary of the Presidency was divided into two, formally creating the Ministry of the Presidency.\n\nAfter these events, the line that separates the bodies of the Presidency of the Government from the bodies of the Ministry of the Presidency is blurred and will not be clarified until 1976. In that year, the minister of the Presidency, Alfonso Osorio, approves a Royal Decree which determines which bodies are integrated in his department, that is, in the Ministry of the Presidency, and which bodies are part of the Presidency of the Government (the Office of the Prime Minister), answering directly to the chief of the executive. This was done two months after prime minister Adolfo Suárez, appointed Carmen Díez de Rivera as the first Moncloa Chief of Staff, creating de facto the Cabinet Office.\nIn 1977 another differentiation was established between the Ministry and the Presidency of the Government, establishing that the Ministry of the Presidency was a body to assist the prime minister, integrated into the Office of the Prime Minister. Thus, in 1977 the Presidency was made up of: the Ministry of the Presidency, the advisors of the prime minister, the Cabinet Office and the prime minister's private secretariat.\nOnce this was clarified, it was clear that the Presidency of the Government had lost its ministerial status, handing it over to a new department headed by the minister of the Presidency with exclusive dedication, while the Presidency was an undefined entity composed of those bodies and advisors that the head of government considers it appropriate to create or appoint, although always assisted financially and organically by the Ministry of the Presidency. Likewise, since the 1980s, differentiated royal decrees have been approved that separately regulate the Presidency of the Government and the Ministry of the Presidency.\nIn 2015, although it did not formally restore its ministerial rank, the Legal Regime of the Public Sector Act, when it regulates the Ministries (Chapter II of Title I), it does foreseen the existence of the Presidency and it established the same regulation for the Presidency and the rest of ministries.\n\n\n== Structure ==\nThe current structure of the Office of the Prime Minister is regulated in Royal Decree 890/2023, of November 27:\n\nThe Prime Minister.\nThe Ministry of the Presidency, Justice and Relations with the Cortes.\nThe Secretariat of State for Justice.\nThe Secretariat of State for Relations with the Cortes and Constitutional Affairs.\nThe Undersecretariat of the Presidency.\nThe Office of the Solicitor Geneal.\nThe Cabinet Office, headed by the Moncloa Chief of Staff with the rank of secretary of state.\nThe General Secretariat of the Prime Minister's Office, with the rank of undersecretariat.\nThe Department for Technical and Legal Coordination, with the rank of directorate-general.\nThe Department for Protocol.\nThe Department for Security.\nThe Deputy Moncloa Chief of Staff, with the rank of undersecretariat.\nThe Department for Speech and Message.\nThe Department for Territorial Monitoring and Analysis.\nThe Department for Institutional Affairs.\nThe General Secretariat for Political Planning.\nThe Department for Political Planning\nThe General Secretariat for Public Policies, European Affairs and Strategic Foresight.\nThe Department for Public Policies.\nThe Department for European Affairs.\nThe National Foresight and Strategy Office.\nThe General Secretariat for Foreign Affairs\nThe Department for Foreign Affairs.\nThe Department for National Security.\nThe Department for Cultural Affairs.\nThe Office for Economic Affairs and G20, with the rank of secretariat of state.\nThe Department for Strategic Projects and Sector Policies.\nThe Office of the Government Spokesperson.\nThe Secretariat of State for Press.\nThe Department for National Information.\nThe Department for International Information.\nThe Department for Regional Information.\nThe Digital Department.\nThe Department for Information Coordination.\nThe Department for Institutional Communication.\nIn accordance with the National Heritage Regulatory Act of 1982 and Royal Decree 204/2024, which develops the structure of the Ministry of the Presidency, the Patrimonio Nacional agency is attached to the Prime Minister's Office through that department.\n\n\n=== Coordination committee ===\nTo ensure the coordination of all the departments of the Presidency, there is a Coordination Committee, headed by the Moncloa Chief of Staff. This committee includes the main senior officials of the Presidency.\n\n\n== Most senior positions within the Office ==\n\n\n== Headquarters ==\nThe meetings of the Council of Ministers were usually held in the palace where the monarch —who chaired the meetings— was staying. Thus, many ministerial meetings took place in the Royal Palace, but not always, since there was no fixed headquarters and they moved along with the royal court. However, starting in 1871, an official headquarters for the Head of Government was established. The chosen location was the Casa de los Heros, which served as headquarters until 1914. This building was demolished two years after its abandonment, building in its place the current headquarters of the Ministry of Education.\n\nIn 1914, during the reign of Alfonso XIII, the government purchased the Palace of Villamejor from Infante Carlos de Borbón-Dos Sicilias, who had owned it since 1906. The purchase was authorized by the Cortes Generales through the Law of June 30, 1914, which granted a credit of two million pesetas —nowadays around USD 11.5 million (2024)— to the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, of which, 1.9 million were for the purchase of the property and the remaining 100,000 pesetas to cover the costs of moving and installing the presidential services.\nThe Presidency was housed in the aforementioned Villamejor Palace until 1977. At the end of 1976, when the democratic transition began, it was considered that, for security reasons, the Government Headquarters should be moved out of the city center and the historic Palace of Moncloa was chosen as the new headquarters. The Moncloa Palace had been rebuilt during the dictatorship, since the Civil War completely destroyed it and since the 1950s it had acted as the residence of foreign heads of state who visited the country.\nToday, the Moncloa Palace serves only as the residence of the head of government and his family, as well as for official events, since the presidential services have been distributed among the different buildings that have been built around the palace since the 1980s. Currently, the Moncloa Government Complex consists of 16 buildings, and also houses the headquarters of the Ministry of the Presidency.\n\n\n== Budget ==\nAs it is not currently a ministerial department, the Office of the Prime Minister does not have its own budget section and it is financed mainly through the section of the Ministry of the Presidency.\nThus, for the fiscal year 2023, extended to 2024, the Office has a budget of 134 million euros, participating in two programs of the aforementioned Ministry:\n\nProgram 912M \"Presidency of the Government\", endowed with 55.6 million euros, which covers the expenses of the Cabinet Office, the General Secretariat, the rest of the departments and the meetings of the Council of Ministers.\nProgram 921Q \"Information coverage\", endowed with 78.4 million euros, which covers the expenses of the Secretariat of State for Press.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Transcaspian Canal (Russian: Транскаспийский канал) was a proposed canal to divert the Amu Darya River from the Aral Sea and into the Caspian Sea. It was first proposed by Tsarist engineers and later considered by Soviet officials. Proponents argued that the project would return the Amu Darya into its supposed old bed.\nSeveral other similar proposals were made in the early 20th century, including a Kazakh-Turkestan Canal to connect Kazakhstan with the Black Sea. The projects were not seriously considered after the late-1920s, when a campaign was launched to ridicule \"fantastic\" hydraulic projects. In 1928, over a dozen hydraulic engineers operating in Central Asia were tried for mismanaging the irrigation system and \"devising intentionally fantastic projects\".\n\n\n== Proposals ==\nFollowing the Russian conquest of Central Asia, multiple suggestions were put forward for the construction of a transcaspian canal. Those who supported the project had Orientalist views and believed it would return \"the [Khivan] oasis to cultured life\".\n\n\n=== Glukhovskoi's proposals ===\nAmong the initial proposals was one presented by Aleksandr Glukhovskoi in 1868. He argued that such a canal would allow ships sailing down the Volga to reach Tashkent via Bukhara. Many of Glukhovskoi's original reports and proposals were lost during the Russian Civil War and a 1924 flood. In June 1925, the Water Section of the State Planning Committee discussed the project. Among the plans considered was one made by Gluvoskoi in 1893.\n\n\n=== Rizenkampf's proposals ===\n\nAfter the October Revolution, Georgii Rizenkampf (German: Georgi Riesenkampff) proposed to build a 1,600-km (1,500-verst) canal stretching from the upper reaches of the Amu Darya in Afghanistan through the Karakum Desert in Turkmenistan all the way to the Caspian sea. In his 1921 book entitled \"Trans-Kaspiiskii kanal (Problema orosheniia Zakaspiia)\" (Russian: Транс-Каспийский канал (Проблема орошения Закаспия)), Rizenkampf argued that the canal would support the growing of cotton in the region. He predicted cotton would become the \"fulcrum of life in Transcaspia\".\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nBy the late 1920s, a media campaign was launched to ridicule large water diversion projects in Central Asia. In February and March 1928, 23 hydraulic engineers and water managers working in Central Asia, including those who had proposed a transcaspian canal, were tried in Tashkent. At the time the London Times reported that \"Until recently the authorities in Moscow boasted of these 'fantastic projects,' but now apparently they need scapegoats to mollify the native population.\" Historian Maya K. Peterson similarly argued that the trial was aimed to \"distract from Soviet failings and find scapegoats\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nEurasia Canal\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nGlukhovskoi's Transcaspian Canal (1921) (in Russian)",

        "content": "The Kampinos Group was a partisan formation of the Home Army fighting in the Kampinos Forest during the Warsaw Uprising of 1944.\nThe Kampinos Group was formed based on the structures of the VIII District of the Warsaw County Subdistrict of the Warsaw District, as well as various units of the Home Army that found themselves in the Kampinos Forest as a result of the Operation Tempest. In August and September 1944, the group tied up significant enemy forces, thereby relieving the besieged Warsaw. Its units fought in 47 battles and skirmishes and temporarily liberated the central and eastern parts of the forest from German occupation, inhabited by several thousand people. Over 900 soldiers of the Kampinos Group also set out to aid the capital, taking part in attacks on the Gdańsk railway station and in the defense of Żoliborz.\nAt the end of September 1944, the Kampinos Group attempted to break through to the Świętokrzyskie Mountains. Initially, the Polish formation effectively evaded the German encirclement, but due to command errors, it was surrounded and defeated on September 29 near Jaktorów. However, many Home Army soldiers, including several cohesive units, managed to break out of the encirclement. Some of them continued to fight until January 1945.\n\n\n== Origins ==\n\n\n=== Conspiracy in the Kampinos Forest ===\n\nAlready at the turn of 1939 and 1940, just a few months after the Invasion of Poland, the first cells of the Polish resistance movement began to emerge in the Kampinos Forest area. By mid-1940, most of these groups had subordinated themselves to the Union of Armed Struggle (renamed the Home Army in February 1942). The structures of the Union of Armed Struggle/Home Army from the pre-war areas of Czosnów, Młociny, and the eastern part of the Zaborów became part of the VIII Łęgów District of the Warsaw County Subdistrict of the Warsaw District. Thus, the VIII District encompassed the eastern part of the Kampinos Forest and villages scattered on both sides of the Warsaw–Modlin road within its territorial scope. The conditions of underground work in the Łęgów District were significantly influenced by the fact that its southern part belonged territorially to the Warsaw District of the General Government, while the northern part was annexed into the Reich as part of the so-called Zichenau. The border between the Nazi Germany and the General Government was guarded by numerous border guard posts.\nThe first commander of the VIII District was Lieutenant Andrzej Niedzielski, alias \"Andrzej\". In September 1941, he was replaced by Captain Józef Krzyczkowski, alias \"Szymon\". At the turn of 1940 and 1941, (according to other sources only in 1942) in the Warsaw County Subdistrict, the creation of so-called line units began, modeled on the structure of a regular army. The previous organizational structure, based on small underground cells (so-called \"fives\"), was replaced by a division into squads and platoons, and eventually also into companies and battalions. In the autumn of 1943, the VIII District already had 953 sworn soldiers organized into five infantry companies and three independent platoons (communications, sappers, and gendarmerie). In addition, at the end of 1942, the district command established the Kedyw unit. Initially, it was in the form of a squad, but already in the first half of 1943, it grew to the size of a platoon (about 40 soldiers). Due to the increasing number of \"burned\" conspirators in the winter of 1943 and 1944, a small partisan unit was organized in the Kampinos Forest area under the command of Second Lieutenant Antoni Frydrych, alias \"Parys\". Initially, the unit consisted of only a few partisans, but over time its strength grew to about 30 soldiers. The partisans were quartered in makeshift dugouts on the so-called Strzeleckie Łąki near Sieraków, and organizationally, they were subordinate to the commander of the Kedyw of the VIII District.\n\nIn the early years of the occupation, the underground activity in the VIII District mainly focused on gathering weapons and ammunition, conducting military training for sworn soldiers, intelligence work, and informational-propaganda activities. Over time, sabotage-diversion actions were also organized, and traitors, informants, and common criminals were punished or eliminated. For almost three years, the VIII District developed its underground activity without significant opposition from the Germans. However, with the increase in the number and activity of conspirators, the number of \"leaks\" and arrests also increased. Inevitably, there were losses during combat actions. The conditions of underground work deteriorated significantly from June 1943 when a unit of German gendarmerie specialized in combating the resistance movement was quartered in Zaborów. In November 1943, as a result of betrayal by one of the conspirators, dozens of people – soldiers of the VIII District and members of their families – were arrested. Eight residents of Truskaw and Izabelin were then burned alive by Zaborów gendarmes. As a result of the series of arrests, the 1st and 5th companies of the VIII District suffered such heavy losses that it became necessary to merge them into one company. On 28 January 1944, a clandestine weapons depot located in the Opaleń forest fell into the hands of the Germans. Another severe blow was the death of the commander of the Kedyw of the VIII District, Second Lieutenant Marian Grobelny, alias \"Macher\", and four other soldiers shot by Zaborów gendarmes in an ambush near Sieraków (24 June 1944).\nUltimately, the Germans failed to break or paralyze the structures of the VIII District. On the eve of the Warsaw Uprising, Captain \"Szymon\" could deploy two infantry battalions with the strength of five frontline companies. Within the district, there were also two platoons of the Military Service of the Uprising Protection and structures of the Military Women's Service. In July 1944, \"Szymon\" was additionally assigned two youth platoons led by officer cadets Janusz Warmiński, alias \"Murzyn\", and Wojciech Pecyński, alias \"Polana\", which – although composed of young boys from the Dąbrowa Leśna and Łomianki areas, therefore from the territory of the VIII District – were previously subordinate to the command of the III Dęby District of the Warsaw County Subdistrict (Rembertów). At the same time, preparations for the insurgent action began, including the gathering of weapons and ammunition. However, arming remained the Achilles' heel of the VIII District. \"Szymon\" stated in his post-war memoirs that after the mobilization in July 1944, there were only about 350–400 armed soldiers in the ranks of the VIII District's units. On the other hand, Edward Bonarowski claimed that the forces of the Łęgów District did not exceed the number of 440 armed soldiers, usually equipped with weapons from the Invasion of Poland.\nThe plans for a general uprising developed by the Home Army command envisaged that the main task of the VIII District would be to seize the Bielany airfield. This facility was to be captured in cooperation with units of the III District of the Żoliborz Subdistrict. In addition, the VIII District was tasked with seizing the Łomianki factory and workshops in Dziekanów Leśny, taking over transportation means on the Vistula river, and blocking the Modlin road at the Młociny Forest. It was also planned that after the arrival of reinforcements from the Błonie District, offensive actions would be conducted towards Kazuń Nowy.\n\n\n=== Arrival of the Stowbtsy-Naliboki Group ===\n\nDuring the night of 25/26 July 1944, Captain \"Szymon\" received a message that a several hundred strong unit had stopped in Dziekanów Polski, which soldiers were dressed in uniforms of the pre-war Polish Armed Forces and spoke Polish with a Northern Borderlands dialect. The next day, the commander of the VIII District went to Dziekanów to personally assess the situation. On the spot, he learned that the Stowbtsy-Naliboki Home Army Group had arrived from the Naliboki forest in the Eastern Borderlands. The group consisted of 861 well-armed and battle-hardened partisans, organized into an infantry battalion, a cavalry squadron, a heavy machine gun squadron, and logistical support. It was led by Lieutenant Adolf Pilch, alias \"Góra\" (a Silent Unseen paratrooper).\nThe Stowbtsy-Naliboki Group was formed based on the Polish Partisan Unit named after Tadeusz Kościuszko, established in June 1943 in the Stowbtsy County in the Nowogródek Voivodeship. In the first months of its existence, the unit engaged in intense combat with the Germans, cooperating with Soviet partisans. However, the situation changed dramatically in December 1943 when Soviet partisans deceitfully kidnapped the command of the Polish group and then proceeded to disarm and liquidate subunits without officers. Lieutenant \"Góra\", who took command of the remnants of the unit, aimed to save the soldiers and provide protection to the Polish population against the terror of the Soviet partisans. With the consent of the command of the Nowogródek Home Army District, he decided to temporarily cease hostilities with the Germans. This decision allowed \"Góra\" to rebuild the group and continue the fight against the Soviets. In the summer of 1944, the rapid advances of the Red Army led to the loss of communication with the district command and prevented the group from participating in Operation Ostra Brama. In this situation, Lieutenant \"Góra\" decided to evacuate his units to central Poland, which also meant breaking the ceasefire with the Germans. During the nearly month-long march, sneaking between the broken German units on the Eastern Front, the group covered a distance of several hundred kilometers, crossing the Neman, Shchara, and Bug rivers along the way. The climax of the journey occurred on July 25 when \"Góra's\" soldiers, thanks to a clever military ruse, crossed the heavily guarded bridge over the Vistula near Nowy Dwór Mazowiecki without a fight. Ultimately, after midnight on July 26, the Naliboki group, with the knowledge and consent of the Germans, arrived in Dziekanów Polski.\nDuring the march and upon arrival in the Warsaw area, Lieutenant \"Góra\" unsuccessfully attempted to establish contact with the Home Army command. The conspiratorial circles received the lieutenant and his soldiers with great mistrust. There were probably fears that the presence of a unit accused of collaborating with the Germans on the eve of the planned uprising might hinder cooperation with the Red Army. Initially, the command of the Warsaw County Subdistrict considered forcibly disarming the Naliboki group or buying weapons from its soldiers. On July 27, however, the Home Army High Command, through Captain \"Szymon\", ordered Lieutenant \"Góra\" to march to the Tuchola Forest in the Gdańsk Pomerania, announcing at the same time that he himself would face a drumhead court-martial for collaboration with the Germans. This order, which Stanisław Podlewski later described as \"mad and insane\", in practice condemned the group to destruction because the Borderland soldiers had no chance of penetrating hundreds of kilometers into German-controlled territory. In this situation, Lieutenant Pilch informed Captain \"Szymon\" that he could not carry out the Home Army High Command's order. He proposed instead that he and his entire group be placed under his command.\n\"Szymon\" quickly embraced this proposal. He shared \"Góra's\" opinion on the senselessness of marching to the Tuchola Forest and also realized that subordinating the Stowbtsy-Naliboki Group would increase his forces by nearly 900 well-armed and battle-hardened partisans. Such a solution would change the previous balance of power in the eastern part of the Kampinos Forest, and the Łęgów District would have a chance to carry out the tasks imposed by the insurgent plans. \"Szymon\" then contacted the Home Army High Command again, proposing to incorporate \"Góra's\" units into the VIII District. Ultimately, the Home Army High Command accepted \"Szymon's\" proposal, but stipulated that he assumed command of the Naliboki group \"at his own risk\".\nThanks to the subordination of the Naliboki group, the strength of the VIII District increased, according to Jerzy Koszada's calculations, to 2092 soldiers (32 officers, 294 non-commissioned officers, 1480 privates, 286 women). The armament of the district's units included: 7 grenade launchers, 13 medium machine guns, 47 light machine guns, 61 submachine guns, 1046 rifles, 175 pistols, 1044 grenades, 367 incendiary bottles, and 239,000 rounds of ammunition.\n\n\n== Battle trail ==\n\n\n=== First battles ===\nAfter being incorporated into the VIII District, the Naliboki units remained in Dziekanowo Polskie for a short time to exploit the Germans' belief that they were dealing with a collaborationist unit and to obtain as much ammunition, medicine, and dressing materials from the Modlin Fortress garrison as possible. When the enemy realized the deception, Captain \"Szymon\" ordered the Naliboki group to move to the area of the villages of Wiersze and Truskawka in the central part of the Kampinos Forest (July 29). Along the way, \"Góra's\" soldiers were to eliminate German gendarmerie and border guard posts. Around the same time, \"Szymon\" decided to mobilize part of the Kampinos subunits of the VIII District (July 28). The presence of over a thousand armed partisans in a relatively small forest area soon led to a series of clashes with German units quartered in the vicinity. The most serious engagement occurred in Aleksandrów, where on the morning of July 31, the Naliboki units completely routed a Wehrmacht company, killing nearly 50 Germans and capturing a considerable amount of weapons and ammunition. According to Józef Krzyczkowski and Adolf Pilch, this battle effectively marked the beginning of the uprising in the Kampinos Forest.\nThe order from the commander of the Warsaw District of the Home Army regarding the start of the uprising reached \"Szymon\" on August 1 at 3:00 PM. Due to the fact that this occurred just two hours before the designated \"W\" Hour, there was little chance that all of the VIII District's forces could complete their concentration and strike at the Bielany airfield in time. Fearing that the inaction of the Kampinos units would allow the Germans to redirect all forces to fight against the units of the Żoliborz District, Captain \"Szymon\" decided not to wait for the concentration to finish and ordered the nearest I Battalion, commanded by Lieutenant Janusz Langner, alias \"Janusz\", to attack. The partially mobilized battalion could only field 190 soldiers, while the airfield garrison was estimated to consist of about 700 well-armed soldiers. In these circumstances, the Polish attack was purely demonstrative. After a two-hour firefight, \"Janusz's\" battalion withdrew to the Łuże Mountain area, losing 5 killed and 12 wounded.\n\nMeanwhile, during the night of August 1 and 2, the main forces of the VIII District completed their concentration in the area of Hill 103 in Łuże Mountain. In the morning, \"Szymon\" launched his units into another attack on the airfield. However, alerted by earlier clashes, the enemy remained vigilant and was not caught off guard. Well-fortified and with a firepower advantage, the Germans repelled all Polish attacks that morning. After hours of fighting, the Home Army units, threatened by a flanking attack from the Modlińska Road, were forced to withdraw to the Łuże area. The VIII District suffered heavy losses, amounting to 31 killed and 45 wounded. Among the fallen were Lieutenant \"Janusz\" and two company commanders, while Captain \"Szymon\" was seriously wounded. A significant portion of the ammunition reserves was also expended. As a result of this defeat, the Home Army units in the Kampinos Forest remained unable to conduct significant offensive operations until mid-August 1944. Nevertheless, the German command soon issued an order to destroy the Bielany airfield. Some Polish historians and veterans were convinced that it was the attacks of the VIII District that prompted the Germans to abandon the use of the base.\nWhile the main forces of the VIII District were advancing towards the Bielany airfield, three squadrons of the 1st Squadron of the 27th Uhlan Regiment of the Home Army attempted to block the Modlińska Road. In ambushes near Pieńków and Buraków, the Uhlans killed approximately 34–41 Germans and destroyed 17 vehicles. However, lacking anti-tank weapons, the cavalrymen had to withdraw when German tanks appeared on the road.\nAfter the unsuccessful attack on the airfield, the units of the VIII District withdrew deeper into the Kampinos Forest, to the area around the villages of Wiersze, Truskawka, Janówek, and Krogulec. On August 3, near Truskawka, Polish forces surprised and completely destroyed a German unit of approximately company strength. At a relatively low cost in casualties, Polish soldiers killed nearly 70 Germans and captured several more. On the same day, troopers from the 2nd Squadron of the 27th Uhlan Regiment engaged and defeated a small Wehrmacht unit that was conducting requisitions in villages within Kampinos. Both victories significantly boosted morale among the Kampinos units of the Home Army, which had been shaken by the earlier defeat at the Bielany airfield.\nOn August 3, based on the Kampinos units of the VIII District and the units of the Naliboki Group, the Home Army Palmiry-Młociny Regiment was formed. The depleted I Kampinos Battalion was merged with the reserve II Battalion commanded by Captain Stanisław Nowosad, alias \"Dulka\". Severely wounded, \"Szymon\" handed over command of the regiment \"during combat action\" to Lieutenant Pilch, who was already operating under the code name \"Dolina\". He reserved for himself the \"assignment of combat tasks and overall leadership\". In the same order, \"Szymon\" also ordered the regiment to move to the area of Sieraków, Truskaw and Izabelin. The relocation was carried out according to the order. However, after four days, \"Szymon\" again ordered the units to withdraw deep into the Kampinos Forest, hoping that this would protect them from being cut off from the forest, facilitate the receipt of Allied airdrops, and prevent Warsaw refugees from exerting a demoralizing influence on the soldiers. Commanding the Kampinos Battalion, Captain \"Dulka\" received an order to demobilize all unarmed soldiers. At the request of the battalion commander, this order was soon modified to leave those soldiers in the ranks who expressed such a desire, while returning the weapons of those reservists who decided to return home.\nBefore the withdrawal, Polish units were to attack German outposts along the road between Leszno and Stare Babice. In the evening of August 7, the Naliboki infantry battalion under the command of Lieutenant Witold Pełczyński, alias \"Witold\", and the cavalry squadron under the command of Lieutenant Zdzisław Nurkiewicz, alias \"Nieczaj\", partially drove the Germans out of Borzęcin Duży, Zaborów and Zaborówek. Meanwhile, the poorly armed Kampinos Battalion, which was attacking between Zielonki and Zalesie, withdrew from the fight on the orders of Captain \"Dulka\" when a German reconnaissance aircraft appeared in the sky. Later that same night, \"Dulka\" convened his officers for a meeting in Sieraków, during which he pointed out the critical situation of the uprising in his opinion and announced that due to a lack of trust from superiors, he was relinquishing command of the battalion. When none of the officers volunteered to take command, \"Dulka\" ordered the dissolution of the battalion. That same night, nearly 600 soldiers left the ranks. Some of the insurgents wishing to continue the fight joined other units. As a result of the dissolution of the Kampinos Battalion, the strength of the Palmiry-Młociny Regiment decreased from 2,000 soldiers to around 1,400.\nIn the following days, the regiment's units skirmished with the Germans near Buda and Truskaw (August 8), as well as near Brzozówka (August 10) and Leoncin (August 11/12).\n\n\n=== Beginning of the Kampinos Group ===\n\nThe presence of a strong partisan group led to the influx of individual soldiers and cohesive units of the Home Army from various districts of Warsaw into the Kampinos Forest after the outbreak of the Warsaw Uprising. They included those who left the city after the initial Polish attacks during \"W\" Hour. Gradually, units from other areas of the Warsaw County Subdistrict and neighboring areas of the Western Subdistrict of the Warsaw Home Army (code-named \"Hallerowo\"/\"Hajduki\") also arrived.\n\nOn August 2, a company from Wiersze, led by Lieutenant Franciszek Wiszniowski, alias \"Jurek\" (1 officer, 75 non-commissioned officers, and soldiers), joined. This unit formally belonged to the Western Subdistrict of the Warsaw Home Army.\nOn August 4, a unit led by Lieutenant Marian Olszewski, alias \"Maryś\", consisting of 2 officers and 98 soldiers from the 1st District of the Wola Subdistrict, joined. Due to the enemy's advantage and lack of weapons caused by the Germans' occupation of warehouses in Ulrychów, this unit could not carry out its insurgent tasks during \"W\" Hour and withdrew to the Kampinos Forest on the night of August 1/2.\nOn August 7, the Zemsta Company, led by Second Lieutenant Jerzy Dudziec, alias \"Puchała\", joined. It comprised soldiers from the Bojowa Dywersja of the 7th Rejon Jelsk of the Warsaw County Subdistrict (Ożarów Mazowiecki). This unit included 1 officer and 49 non-commissioned officers and soldiers.\nAround August 10, a sapper team led by Second Lieutenant Bolesław Janulis, alias \"Juriewicz\", consisting of 1 officer and 11 non-commissioned officers and soldiers, joined. This subunit was previously part of the command platoon of the Ułanów Jeleń Division of the Home Army. After an unsuccessful attack during \"W\" Hour on the heavily fortified \"police district\" in South Śródmieście, the soldiers under \"Juriewicz\" withdrew to the Kabaty Woods and then to the Kampinos Forest.\nOn August 11, a company led by Captain Wilhelm Kosiński, alias \"Mścisław\", appeared near Wiersze. It was formed from soldiers of the Sochaczew District of the Western Subdistrict of the Home Army \"Hajduki\". In the following days, several hundred soldiers from the Hajduki Subdistrict (Sochaczew and Błonie districts) arrived in the Kampinos Forest. They were organized into the Sochaczew Battalion, led by Captain Władysław Starzyk, alias \"Korwin\", who was previously the commander of the Sochaczew District. By the end of September, the battalion consisted of 30 officers and 451 non-commissioned officers and soldiers.\nAround August 14, a platoon led by Lieutenant Henryk Małowiecki, alias \"Ran\", consisting of 1 officer and 47 non-commissioned officers and soldiers, joined. This unit was previously part of the 5th District of the 6th Praga Subdistrict. Around August 9, after the final suppression of the uprising in the right-bank Warsaw, the \"Ran\" platoon began to retreat to the Kampinos Forest.\nAround August 15, a cavalry platoon led by Second Lieutenant Zygmunt Koc, alias \"Dąbrowa\", consisting of 1 officer and 20 non-commissioned officers and soldiers, joined. This unit was formed in 1943 on the estate in Wilków, where \"Dąbrowa\" found employment after the September defeat. After joining the Kampinos Group, the platoon became part of the 4th Squadron of the 1st Division of the 27th Ulhan Regiment of the Home Army, and \"Dąbrowa\" himself became the deputy commander of the squadron.\nOn August 17, a platoon of \"Orliks\" from the 6th Rejon Helenów of the Warsaw County Subdistrict (Pruszków), led by Second Lieutenant Tadeusz Nowicki, alias \"Orlik,\" consisting of 1 officer and 47 non-commissioned officers and soldiers, joined. After the collapse of the insurgent action in the Helenów District, the \"Orlik\" platoon retreated to the forests of Sękocin and Chojnowo, from where they reached the Kampinos Forest. In September, it was incorporated into Lieutenant \"Lawa's\" aviation company.\nOn August 18, a platoon under the command of Lieutenant Tadeusz Gaworski, alias \"Lawa\", consisting of about 30–40 soldiers from the Aviation Department of the Home Army General Staff (known as the aviation platoon), joined. Having missed the tragically ended attack of the Home Army's Garłuch Regiment on Okęcie Airport, the \"Lawa\" unit moved to the forests of Sękocin and Chojnowo, from where it departed for the Kampinos Forest on the night of August 13/14. On August 27, the platoon was transformed into an independent special tasks aviation company.\nOn August 24, the Jerzyki Company of Special Combat Units under the command of Lieutenant Jerzy Strzałkowski, alias \"Jerzy\", joined with approximately 120 officers and soldiers. The company had previously fought in the Old Town of Warsaw, and after reaching Żoliborz through the sewers, it moved to the Kampinos Forest.\nOn September 4, several soldiers from the Zemsta Company of the Pięść Battalion, led by Lieutenant Stefan Matuszczyk, alias \"Porawa\", joined. They had previously fought in Wola and the Old Town, and then made their way to Żoliborz through the sewers on August 27 and September 2. Based on Lieutenant \"Porawa's\" unit, the Zemsta Company was soon reconstituted.\nOn September 8, after a two-day crossing of the Vistula, approximately 200 soldiers under the command of Lieutenant Bolesław Szymkiewicz, alias \"Znicz\", from the 1st Marianowo District in the Warsaw County Subdistrict (Legionowo), arrived in the Kampinos Forest. The \"Znicz\" unit henceforth became known as the Legion Battalion.\nBased on the Palmiry-Młociny Regiment and the arriving units in the forest, the Kampinos Group was formed in mid-August. At its peak, it consisted of 2,700 to 3,000 soldiers and 700 horses. Some sources suggest that upon the transformation of the Warsaw insurgent units into the Warsaw Corps of the Home Army on 20 September 1944, the Kampinos Group became part of the fighting 8th Infantry Division of the Home Army named after Romuald Traugutt, serving as its 13th Infantry Regiment. However, Grzegorz Jasiński questions this, arguing that the mentioned reorganization only affected units fighting in the capital.\nAdditionally, it is worth mentioning that around August 3–4, approximately 160 soldiers from the 3rd District of the 2nd Home Army Żoliborz Subdistrict, commanded by Captain Władysław Nowakowski, alias \"Serb\", arrived in the Kampinos Forest. On August 26, a several dozen-strong unit of the communist People's Army, under the command of Lieutenant Teodor Kufel, alias \"Teoch,\" appeared in Wiersze. Both units did not subordinate themselves to the command of the Kampinos Group.\n\n\n=== Relief attempt for Warsaw ===\nThe Home Army command had high hopes for the presence of a strong partisan group in the Kampinos Forest. Already on August 7, the Home Army High Command subordinated all Home Army units operating in the forest to Captain \"Szymon\", instructing him to form a unit composed of the most experienced soldiers and officers and then send it to the area of the Wola cemeteries with the task of establishing contact with the Radosław Group fighting there. However, \"Szymon\" received this order only the next day, i.e., when the units of the Palmiry-Młociny Regiment had completed their retreat to the Wiersze area. Due to the exhaustion of the soldiers and the shortage of weapons and ammunition, the commander of the VIII District deemed the Home Army High Command's order temporarily impossible to execute. He decided to postpone sending reinforcements to Warsaw until the receipt of Allied airdrops with weapons and ammunition. On the nights of August 9/10 and 10/11, the first airdrops were received, significantly arming the forest Home Army units. However, \"Szymon\" still believed that his units were not ready to go to battle in the capital. This conviction was further reinforced by reconnaissance results, which incorrectly indicated that the Radosław Group units had already withdrawn from the area of the Wola cemeteries.\n\"Szymon's\" actions caused dissatisfaction among the insurgent command. As a result, it was decided to send a combat-ready and energetic officer to the Kampinos Forest with the task of activating local Home Army units. Major Alfons Kotowski, alias \"Okoń\", the former commander of the Pięść Battalion, was chosen for this role. However, during his attempt to escape from the city, \"Okoń\" encountered numerous difficulties and as a result, only managed to reach Wiersze on the night of August 15/16. Meanwhile, a serious competence dispute erupted among the officers present in the forest. While the eastern part of the forest, territorially belonging to the pre-war Warsaw County, was part of the Warsaw County Subdistrict, the remaining part of the forest – including its central area where the Kampinos Group units were stationed – was located in the pre-war counties of Sochaczew and Błonie, which were part of the \"Hajduki\" Western Subdistrict of the Home Army. Under this pretext, the \"Hajduki\" commander, Lieutenant Colonel Franciszek Jachieć, alias \"Roman\", and his representative in the Kampinos Forest, Lieutenant Colonel Ludwik Wiktor Konarski, alias \"Wiktor\"/\"Victor\", attempted to subordinate all Kampinos units to themselves. However, \"Szymon\" and \"Dolina\", referring to orders received from the Home Army High Command a few days earlier, staunchly refused to relinquish command.\nIn the meantime, Colonel Karol Ziemski, alias \"Wachnowski\", to whom the insurgent units in Żoliborz and the Kampinos Forest were subordinated as part of the Home Army's Północ Group, attempted to organize relief for the besieged Warsaw Old Town, under attack by the Germans. With no communication with Major \"Okoń\" and unaware of the difficulties he encountered while attempting to reach Żoliborz, Ziemski decided not to wait for further developments and to compel the Kampinos units to immediately set off for Warsaw. On August 14, he sent a radio message to \"Szymon\", ordering him to form a strike force from the ranks of the Kampinos Group and transfer it to the Wola cemeteries area in case \"Okoń\" was absent. From there, part of the \"forest\" fighters was to advance towards Stawki Street and Muranów, while the rest was to capture the northern part of Okopowa Street in Wola. The next evening, the Kampinos Group sent a well-armed relief force to Warsaw, consisting of the Żoliborz unit under Captain \"Serb\" (160 soldiers), the Sochaczew Company commanded by Captain \"Mścisław\" (about 110–150 soldiers), and a detached infantry battalion from the Palmiry-Młociny Regiment under Lieutenant \"Witold\" (over 450 soldiers). After a \"lengthy, very unpleasant conversation\", it was agreed that the relief force would depart under the overall command of Lieutenant Colonel \"Victor\". Upon arrival in the Powązki area, individual units would carry out tasks independently. However, \"Victor\" questioned Colonel Ziemski's order regarding a nighttime attack on Stawki Street, deciding that only reconnaissance by combat would be conducted there. After three hours of marching, the Polish column reached Powązki, where a unit of German pioneers was stationed. \"Victor\" chose not to risk a nighttime battle, and after many twists and turns, the Polish column ultimately arrived in insurgent-held Żoliborz (there are conflicting accounts regarding the exact course of these events). However, only 400 to 460 \"forest\" fighters reached there, as nearly 300 soldiers got lost in the darkness and returned to the Kampinos Forest.\n\nThat same night, Major \"Okoń\" reached the Kampinos Forest and immediately began organizing a second relief force for Warsaw. Within four days, he managed to organize a well-armed battalion comprising up to 780 soldiers. On the night of August 19/20, \"Okoń\", in accordance with the command's order, led his unit to Żoliborz. Along the way, they encountered posts manned by Hungarian troops allied with the Germans, but after brief negotiations, the Honvéds agreed to let the Poles pass without a fight. Crucial roles were played by the Kampinos Group soldiers Stefan Grzyb, alias \"Adam\", and Kazimierz Sołtysik, alias \"Kazek\", who had previously served as cross-border couriers for the Main Command of the Home Army and had been to Hungary several times, and in 1941 had led Lieutenant Józef Krzyczkowski across the green border to Poland. That night, however, maintaining order in the column proved once again unsuccessful, resulting in the loss of the aviation platoon under Lieutenant \"Lawa\" and at least part of the Sochaczew Company under Lieutenant \"Mazur\", who lost their way and had to return to the forest.\n\n\n==== Attacks on Gdańsk Railway Station ====\n\nOn August 20, there were already six companies from the Kampinos Group in Żoliborz, totaling between 750 to 940 well-armed soldiers. The insurgent command decided to use the \"forest\" fighters to break through the German barrier separating the Old Town from Żoliborz, with the Gdańsk Railway Station and nearby circular railway line forming its core. This task was extremely difficult due to numerous German defensive positions guarding the station and tracks, fortified with bunkers and barbed wire entanglements. Furthermore, the defenders were supported by an armored train, and the area in front of the tracks was flanked by German artillery and machine gun fire from nearby locations such as the Chemical Institute, Buraków, the Warsaw Citadel and Fort, and Traugutt Park. Polish units, on the other hand, lacked heavy weapons, and their command had a very vague idea of the enemy's strength and the layout of their positions. Moreover, the soldiers under \"Okoń\" were unfamiliar with the terrain of the upcoming battle and lacked experience in urban combat. However, the commander of the insurgent forces in Żoliborz, Lieutenant Colonel Mieczysław Niedzielski, alias \"Żywiciel\", did not agree to assign local guides to the \"forest\" fighters.\nThe first attack took place on the night of August 20/21, and there are conflicting accounts of its outcome. Most older sources state that after fierce fighting, the Polish assault collapsed under heavy enemy artillery and machine gun fire. The Kampinos units reportedly suffered heavy casualties, with over 100 killed and dozens wounded. A somewhat different picture of events emerges from the memoirs of Lieutenant Edward Bonarowski, alias \"Ostromir\", published in 2014. He claimed that the \"forest\" fighters incurred losses limited to several dozen killed and wounded that night, and the emerging opportunity to break through the German defenses was squandered due to mistakes made by Lieutenant Colonel \"Żywiciel\" and his staff.\nThe insurgent command decided to launch another attack the following night, this time with greater involvement of units from the Old Town and Żoliborz. General Tadeusz Pełczyński, alias \"Grzegorz\", the Chief of Staff of the Home Army, was to personally oversee the course of the offensive. However, several mistakes made during the initial assault were repeated – adequate reconnaissance of enemy positions was neglected, the \"forest\" fighters were not provided with local guides, and the soldiers were excessively burdened with additional supplies of weapons and ammunition. Moreover, after the experiences of the previous night, German soldiers remained vigilant, remaining at their positions ready for combat. As a result, shortly after the start of the attack, Polish units came under heavy enemy artillery and machine gun fire. The appearance of a German armored train on the tracks was particularly decisive for the course of the battle. Ultimately, only small groups of insurgents managed to break through to the other side of the tracks, where most of them were subsequently wiped out. As a result of the several-hour-long battle, the six Kampinos companies suffered huge losses, in some cases amounting to two-thirds of their personnel. The exact extent of Polish casualties is unknown. It is estimated that on the outskirts of the circular railway, between 350 to over 500 \"forest\" fighters were killed that night. Many officers were among the dead. Meanwhile, the assault by the Old Town units, due to poor coordination of actions, began with significant delay compared to the attack of the Kampinos-Żoliborz forces and was repulsed with significant losses.\n\n\n==== Kampinos soldiers in insurgent Warsaw ====\n\nAfter the defeat at Gdańsk Railway Station, General \"Grzegorz\" ordered Major \"Okoń\" to lead the remaining troops back to the Kampinos Forest. Before departing, the \"forest\" fighters had to surrender all their weapons and ammunition. On the evening of August 23, a detachment of nearly 300 soldiers left Żoliborz under Major \"Okoń's\" command, consisting of around 120 to 150 disarmed soldiers from the Kampinos Group and a large group of insurgents from various Warsaw units. Additionally, a number of civilian authorities from the insurgent government and two members of the Main Command of the Peasant Battalions, along with a group of printers and liaisons, also headed for the forest.\nLieutenant \"Witold\" chose to remain in Żoliborz, accompanied by over 150 \"forest\" fighters, mostly former soldiers of the Stowbtsy-Naliboki Group. Around 40 soldiers from the Marymont platoon 225, previously under Lieutenant \"Dan's\" command, also decided not to return to the forest. The Kampinos soldiers were divided into three platoons: platoon 207 under the command of Lieutenant Henryk Czerwiec, alias \"Jaskólski\", platoon 208 under the command of Second Lieutenant Edward Bonarowski, alias \"Ostromir\", and platoon 209 under the command of Second Lieutenant Józef Krzywicki, alias \"Prawdzic\". These three platoons formed the Żaba Group, with Lieutenant \"Witold\" assuming command. The task of the newly formed group was to defend the southern section of Żoliborz, including the \"Poniatówka\" building, a key bastion of insurgent defense. The remnants of platoon 225 were reintegrated into the parent Żmija Group. However, on August 26, the command of insurgent Żoliborz decided to disband the Żaba Group. Platoons 207 and 208 were absorbed into the Żaglowiec Group and remained in their positions, while platoon 209 was deployed to Promyk Street in Dolny Żoliborz, becoming part of the Żbik Group. Lieutenant \"Witold\" joined the staff of Lieutenant Colonel \"Żywiciel\". The platoons formed from the former Kampinos companies fought in the defense of Żoliborz until the district's surrender on September 30.\nApproximately 30 soldiers from the Kampinos Group, led by Second Lieutenant Jerzy Rybka, alias \"Kiejster\", remained in Warsaw. They crossed the canals to the Old Town, where they joined the 2nd company of the Parasol Battalion, participating in the entire combat route of the Radosław Group.\n\n\n=== \"Independent Republic of Kampinos\" ===\n\nAt the end of August 1944, the Kampinos Group already had undisputed control over the eastern and central areas of the Kampinos Forest, inhabited by several thousand people. Villages such as Ławy, Łubiec, Roztoka, Kiścinne, Krogulec, Wędziszew, Brzozówka, Truskawka, Janówek, Pociecha, Zaborów Leśny, and Wiersze were liberated from German occupation. Polish patrols were also able to penetrate numerous neighboring villages previously unoccupied by enemy forces. The area liberated by the Home Army soldiers was called the \"Independent Republic of Kampinos\". Its unofficial capital was Wiersze, where the headquarters of the Kampinos Group were located.\nAfter over a thousand soldiers crossed to Żoliborz, there were only about 500 armed partisans left in the forest, including the entire cavalry. An energetic enemy attack at that time could have led to the complete destruction of the \"Independent Republic of Kampinos\". Fortunately for the Polish side, the Germans limited themselves to cautious aggressive actions in the Brzozówka and Janówek area on August 22. Probably the decisive factor for the temporary passivity of the enemy was the fact that German intelligence significantly overestimated the size of the Polish group. In the second half of August, the command of the German 9th Army estimated that there were about 5,000 soldiers fighting in the ranks of the Kampinos Group. Some informants even reported that there were 15,000 partisans in the Kampinos Forest equipped with artillery and anti-aircraft defense. Probably, the energetic actions of the Polish cavalry, making numerous raids in distant locations, reinforced the Germans' belief in the large size of the Kampinos Group.\nOn August 24, Major \"Okoń\" returned to Wiersze. He brought with him an order signed by General Pełczyński, confirming that all Home Army units in the Kampinos Forest now fell under the jurisdiction of the major. In the same order, the chief of staff of the Home Army appointed new tasks for the Kampinos Group. They were primarily passive in nature and did not involve conducting significant sabotage actions behind the German lines fighting in Warsaw. According to General Pełczyński's order, the main task of the forest units was to receive airdrops made by Allied aircraft and organize regular deliveries of weapons, ammunition, food, and equipment to the besieged capital. The Kampinos Group was also instructed to cooperate with Home Army units fighting in Warsaw to eliminate German units in the northwestern part of the city.\nThe German command was aware that the Poles were attempting to organize a supply and recruitment base for the Warsaw Uprising in the Kampinos Forest. Initially, the task of blocking communication between the forest and the city was entrusted to the Hungarian 12th Reserve Division of the 2nd Reserve Corps. Soon, however, the Germans realized that the barrier created by their allies remained largely fictional, as the Honvéds openly sympathized with the Poles. Although the Hungarian command rejected the Polish proposal for a change of alliance, both sides entered into an informal \"non-aggression pact\". As a result, the Hungarians did not interfere with maintaining communication between the forest units and Żoliborz – even allowing multiple marches of compact and well-armed Home Army units near their outposts. In this situation, at the end of August, the Germans withdrew the Hungarians from the vicinity of Warsaw, simultaneously strengthening the barrier around the city. On August 27, the areas near Truskaw and Sieraków were occupied by units of the collaborationist Kaminski Brigade, numbering nearly 1500 soldiers (Russians and Belarusians). Kaminski Brigade quickly formed a solid barrier stretching through Laski, Izabelin, and Borzęcin Duży towards Leszno. Similar to the Ochota Massacre in Warsaw, Kaminski Brigade soldiers brutally terrorized the Polish civilian population. For the inhabitants of the Kampinos villages, robberies and rapes of women became a daily occurrence. Additionally, on August 28, Kaminski Brigade units began attacking the Polish outpost in Pociecha.\n\nAt that time, defensive positions in the Pociecha area were held by infantry from the Jerzyki Company supported by the 3rd squadron of the 27th Uhlan Regiment. Supported by artillery fire and heavy infantry weapons, the Kaminski Brigade troops attempted for six days to break through the Polish defense – but each time, they were unsuccessful. Jerzy Krzyczkowski estimated that 16 Polish soldiers were killed and 23 wounded in the defense of the village, while the Kaminski Brigade was said to have suffered losses of at least 30 killed and 40 wounded. Jerzy Koszada, however, assessed that Polish losses in the fighting near Pociecha amounted to 21 killed and 35 wounded, while the enemy losses were estimated at 51 killed and 40 wounded. According to Marian Podgóreczny's assessment, the trench warfare in the Pociecha area constituted the longest partisan battle fought on Polish soil during the German occupation.\nAt the same time, in other areas, the Germans and their collaborators also attempted to penetrate deep into the forest. On August 28, Polish soldiers attempted to break up a German unit conducting cattle requisitions in Małocice. What initially started as a small skirmish soon escalated into a fierce battle, involving, on the Polish side, a flight platoon led by Lieutenant \"Lawa\" and a cavalry reconnaissance squadron, and on the German side, an infantry battalion supported by armored vehicles, artillery, and aircraft. Under pressure from the enemy, Polish soldiers had to retreat, suffering several killed and wounded. The next day, near the village of Kiścinne, Polish cavalry routed a German unit the size of a company that had penetrated the forest from the direction of Leszno. With minimal losses on their side, approximately 140 Germans were killed, and another ten were taken prisoner. On September 1, the enemy displaced a Polish outpost from Roztoka, but soon, Home Army soldiers swiftly recaptured the village with a violent counterattack. The Germans lost 23 killed and three prisoners, while the insurgents' losses were limited to two wounded.\n\nThe Polish command decided not to wait passively for further enemy strikes. During the night of September 2/3, a 80-strong assault unit led by Lieutenant \"Dolina\" carried out a surprise raid on the Kaminski Brigade troops quartered in Truskaw. With minimal losses on their side, the Poles completely routed two strong enemy units, capturing large quantities of weapons and ammunition (including a 75mm caliber cannon). Between 91 and 250 Kaminski Brigade troops were killed, and several to a dozen artillery pieces as well as nearly 30 ammunition wagons were destroyed. That same night, Major \"Okoń\" led a similar raid on the neighboring Sieraków, but the Polish strike missed its target as the enemy had abandoned the village the previous day. During the night of September 3/4, another raid was conducted, this time targeting two Kaminski Brigade companies quartered in the village of Marianów near Leszno. In a battle lasting less than half an hour, an 80-strong cavalry unit commanded by Captain \"Nieczaj\" and Second Lieutenant \"Dąbrowa\" completely crushed the enemy outpost, killing between 60 and 100 Kaminski Brigade troops. During the raid, a quantity of weapons was also captured, and between 22 and 24 prisoners were taken (they were executed when items and valuables looted in Warsaw were found in their possession). As a result of these defeats, Kaminski Brigade units withdrew on September 4 to the line of Laski–Izabelin–Hornówek–Lipków. The Kaminski Brigade troops did not dare to launch further offensive actions against the Kampinos Group, limiting themselves to terrorizing the residents of nearby villages. On September 15, the remnants of Kaminski Brigade were withdrawn from the Warsaw area.\nDespite the victories achieved against the Kaminski Brigade, the Polish group remained permanently cut off from the insurgent Warsaw. During this time, the Home Army High Command also lost interest in the Kampinos Forest, acknowledging that no relief or significant supply deliveries could be expected from there anymore. The actions of the Kampinos Group were henceforth treated by the Polish command as part of the activities of the insurgent Żoliborz district. On September 2, the Home Army Chief Commander, General Tadeusz Komorowski, alias \"Bór\", appealed to the Polish authorities in London to cease the airdrops by Allied aircraft over the Kampinos Forest.\n\nIn September, the Kampinos Group continued to organize ambushes and raids against enemy outposts and their communication lines. Upon learning of German plans to build bridges over the Vistula near Wyszogród, Lieutenant \"Dolina\" led an attack on a sawmill in Piaski Królewskie during the night of September 6/7. Three cavalry squadrons, supported by Lieutenant \"Lawa's\" aviation platoon, burned down the facility along with the accumulated building materials, killing over 30 Germans and capturing a considerable amount of weapons and ammunition. The Polish losses were limited to a few killed and a few wounded.\nTo supplement food supplies, raids were also conducted on estates under German administration (Liegenschaft). Particularly successful was the attack on a German transport unit bivouacked at the manor in Pilaszków, during which Polish lancers captured 254 head of cattle and several wagons loaded with food, cigarettes, and cognac (September 8). Another success was achieved two days later in a raid on the estate in Zaborów, from which several dozen cows, 16 horses, and 8 wagons were taken. Additionally, the partisans set up ambushes on the Babice–Leszno road for small enemy units or lone traveling cars and motorcycles. Often, deception was used, exploiting captured motorcycles and dressing soldiers in German uniforms. On September 20, the Germans were driven out of Polesie Nowe, but the Legion Battalion paid for this success with relatively heavy losses.\nIn September, the Kampinos Group also engaged in several defensive battles. On September 14, soldiers of the Palmiry-Młociny Regiment repelled a German punitive expedition intending to pacify Buda and Mariew. Meanwhile, in mid-September, the Germans, supported by armored cars, attempted to dislodge Home Army soldiers from Pociecha. Covered by minefields, soldiers of the Sochaczew Battalion managed to repel all attacks. The Germans lost several killed and one armored car in the vicinity of Pociecha.\n\n\n==== Allied airdrops over the Kampinos Forest ====\nDuring the Warsaw Uprising, Allied aircraft, including planes piloted by Polish pilots from the No. 301 Polish Bomber Squadron, conducted airdrops of containers with weapons, ammunition, and other supplies over the Kampinos Forest. The overall direction of the airdrop operation was managed by Second Lieutenants Józef Regulski, alias \"Biały\", and Jan Dąbrowski, alias \"Jan\". Responsible for collecting the containers and securing the drop zones was a roughly 50-person \"airdrop platoon\" detached from the Palmiry-Młociny Regiment, led by Second Lieutenant Józef Karney, alias \"Drewno\". Jerzy Koszada reported that there were four drop zones within the \"Independent Republic of Kampinos\":\n\n\"Chochla\" – in meadows near the Debły sanctuary and the village of Ławy. The station commander was Second Lieutenant Henryk Rogala, alias \"Mały\";\n\"Wiersze\" – in the vicinity of the villages of Dąbrowa, Krogulec, and Wiersze. The station commander was Second Lieutenant NN \"Konrad\" from the company of Second Lieutenant Franciszek Wiszniowski, alias \"Jurek\";\n\"Truskawka\" – in the vicinity of the Truskawka village. The station was serviced by the aforementioned \"airdrop platoon\";\n\"Igła\" – between Sieraków and Truskawka. This station was also serviced by the \"airdrop platoon\".\nAlready on the night of August 4/5, the \"Chochla\" station, still under the command of the Błonie District, received an Allied airdrop of weapons and equipment. The contents of the containers were later transferred to the Kampinos units. The first airdrop directly intended for the \"Szymon\" and \"Dolina\" units was made on the night of August 9/10. Jerzy Koszada reported that in August and September 1944, the Kampinos units received a total of 22 airdrops. Of these, 18 were supposed to be received by designated stations, and two were found in the Kampinos Forest but outside the designated stations (near Kromnów and Zamczysko). The last two airdrops were supposed to be received by the \"Tasak\" station operating near Mińsk Mazowiecki and then secretly transported to the Kampinos Forest. Jerzy Kirchmayer reported that the containers received by the Kampinos units contained approximately: 3 mortars with 75 shells, 50 light machine guns with 400,000 rounds of ammunition, 200 submachine guns with 200,000 rounds of ammunition, 30 PIATs with 450 rounds, 30 rifles with 100,000 rounds of ammunition, 250 revolvers and pistols with 7,000 rounds of ammunition, 2,300 hand grenades, 1,000 anti-tank grenades, and 3,000 dressings.\nSome of the weapons and supplies obtained from the airdrops were allocated to the units of the Kampinos Group. The rest were delivered to Warsaw by two relief flights and special transport units.\n\n\n=== Breaking of the Kampinos Group near Jaktorów ===\nIn mid-September, it became clear that the \"Kampinos\" Group would soon have to leave the Kampinos Forest. The Warsaw Uprising was inevitably heading towards collapse, and it was to be expected that after the end of the fighting in the capital, the Germans would commence \"cleansing\" of the forest. In the context of approaching autumn cold, it was also significant that the villages in Kampinos were unable to provide the numerous partisan group with a sufficient amount of food, clothing, and dry shelter. The Home Army High Command expected that the Kampinos group would break through to the insurgent Żoliborz and join the units of Lieutenant Colonel \"Żywiciel\". On the other hand, the Command of the Western Subdistrict of the Home Army \"Hajduki\" proposed to Major \"Okoń\" the dissolution of the group, offering at the same time assistance in the deployment of soldiers and their care. However, the commander of the Kampinos Group intended to break through with his soldiers to the Świętokrzyskie Mountains to continue the fight against the occupier there, together with local units of the Home Army.\n\nWith the cessation of the Soviet Union's offensive on the Warsaw front and the waning of the uprising, the German command concluded that the time was ripe to liquidate the Kampinos Group. In the anti-partisan operation, codenamed Sternschnuppe (Falling Star\"), a combined tactical group under the command of General Friedrich Bernhard took part, equipped with artillery, armored vehicles, and air support. Tadeusz Sawicki assessed that the total strength assigned to crush the Kampinos Group exceeded, in terms of numbers and armament, the structure of a regular infantry division. The beginning of Operation Sternschnuppe took place on September 27, when the Germans struck at Polish positions in the eastern and south-eastern parts of the Kampinos Forest. Fierce battles took place in the area of Brzozówka, Janówek, Pociecha, and Zaborów Leśny. On that day, German Air Force also carried out a raid on the headquarters of the Kampinos Group in Wiersze.\n\nThe German attacks were relatively cautious and did not lead to any significant breakthroughs in the Polish defense on any front. Nevertheless, Major \"Okoń\" quickly realized that they were merely a prelude to a large-scale operation aimed at breaking up the Kampinos Group. Already after the first German air raid, he withdrew the main forces of the group to the forests south of Wiersze, Brzozówka, and Truskawka. He then ordered a full retreat of the entire group to the western part of the Kampinos Forest, from where he intended to break through to the forests south of Żyrardów. Assessing that their units would not withstand the hardships of the march and the impending battles, \"Okoń\" ordered the soldiers to disperse to their homes. According to earlier orders from the subdistrict headquarters \"Hajduki\", the Sochaczew Battalion under Major \"Korwin\" was demobilized. The detachment under Second Lieutenant \"Teoch\" was also dissolved. The remaining units, after a difficult and poorly organized night march, reached the vicinity of the village of Bieliny on the morning of September 28, where \"Okoń\" ordered a full day of rest. Thanks to reports from agents and information provided by captured civilians, the Germans became aware that the Poles had begun to retreat, but they failed to determine the direction of the march and the location of the Polish group's stop.\nIn the afternoon of September 28, the Kampinos Group resumed its retreat. The experiences from the previous night indicated that the extensive baggage trains significantly hindered and slowed down the march of the Polish column. However, Major \"Okoń\" harshly rejected all suggestions from his officers regarding leaving behind the wounded and reducing the number of baggage wagons. As a result, the march proceeded very slowly, and in the dark of night and on unfamiliar terrain, it was extremely difficult to maintain the cohesion of the column. However, the Germans still did not know the location of the Kampinos Group, so the first phase of the retreat proceeded without major incidents. Shortly before midnight on September 29, Polish soldiers reached the vicinity of Wiejca, where they broke through without major difficulties the barrier set up by the collaborationist 308th Russian Battalion, connecting Leszno with Kampinos. Shortly thereafter, \"Okoń\" decided to leave some of the wounded in Gawartowa Wola and Łuszczewko. However, the prolonged halt and the still too slow pace of the march resulted in German armored vehicles sent in pursuit intercepting the rear guard of the Kampinos Group during the crossing of a small wooden bridge over the Utrata river. Chaos erupted in the Polish wagons, and only due to the determined stance of the infantry from the Jerzyki Company and the lancers from the 3rd squadron of the rear guard, the retreat was able to be completed to the other side of the Utrata. However, in the night battle, up to 53 soldiers were lost, as well as the only 75mm cannon, over 150 horses, and 91 baggage wagons with a large amount of supplies. The injured commander of the Jerzyki Company, Second Lieutenant Jerzy Strzałkowski, alias \"Jerzy\", fell into captivity. Another clash between the Polish rear guard and the German pursuit occurred on the morning of September 29 near the village of Baranów. The units led by Second Lieutenant \"Dolina\" managed to break away from the enemy, but some baggage trains and a certain number of marauders fell into the hands of the Germans. Due to the losses suffered in previous battles, as well as the fact that individual soldiers and small subunits were constantly detaching from the main column, the Kampinos Group had dwindled by this time to about 1,200 soldiers.\nMeanwhile, even before the battle began near Baranów, the main forces of the Polish group reached the area of the village of Budy Zosine near Jaktorów, by the railway tracks of the Warsaw–Żyrardów line. At this moment, \"Okoń\" unexpectedly ordered a several-hour halt in the march. The major probably intended to use the stop for rest and to organize the column, and to enable marauders and the rear guard to catch up with the rest of the group. However, many officers received this decision with great concern, as it was known that an enemy pursuit was already following the Kampinos Group, and the vast meadows where the Polish units stood were very difficult terrain to defend, favoring the Germans with their firepower advantage. Budy Zosine was only 6 km away from the Radziejowice Forest on the other side of the tracks, so the officers were convinced that the soldiers would be able to make one final effort and jump across the tracks. However, \"Okoń\" stubbornly stuck to the decision, angrily rejecting all the advice of his subordinates. He didn't even arrange for the securing of passage across the embankment and the blowing up of the railway tracks. Meanwhile, German units gathered hastily in the Żyrardów area.\n\nOnly around noon did the infantry battalion under the command of Lieutenant Witold Lenczewski, alias \"Strzała\", begin to attack the German positions at the railway tracks. Home Army soldiers, covered by machine gun fire, managed to push the German infantry to the other side of the embankment. Some small groups of soldiers even managed to break through the tracks. At this moment, when victory seemed close, a turning point occurred. From the direction of Żyrardów, a German train carrying several Panzer IV tanks and armored personnel carriers on open flatcars entered the tracks. The advancing \"Strzała\" battalion was quickly pinned to the ground and decimated by the intense fire of cannons and machine guns. Then, the train crew shifted their fire onto the wagons, causing massive losses among the vehicles and horses. After the unsuccessful attempt to cross the tracks, the units of the Kampinos Group took up defensive positions in the shape of an extensive quadrangle. The encirclement ring was not yet closed, so there was still a chance, with energetic command and at the cost of abandoning the wagons, that the Polish group could avoid destruction. However, Major \"Okoń\" remained passive, presumably intending to hold the defended positions until dusk, and then attempt a breakout towards the northwest of Żyrardów.\nTaking advantage of the passivity of the Polish command, the Germans closed the encirclement ring around the Kampinos Group and then attacked Polish positions from several directions. Home Army units crowded in an area of less than 6 km2 were bombarded with fire from German artillery, causing massive losses among men and horses. German tanks systematically destroyed successive Polish positions, gradually breaking the cohesive defense line into isolated pockets of resistance. Enemy aircraft also appeared over the battlefield. For several hours, Polish soldiers successfully repelled German attacks. It was only in the afternoon, when Major \"Okoń\" was killed in mysterious circumstances after an unsuccessful attempt to break the encirclement, that the Kampinos Group ceased to function as an organized combat formation. Throughout the late afternoon and evening, individual units continued to fight, trying to hold out until dusk and then break out of the cauldron. Lieutenant \"Dolina\" managed to break through to the nearby Mariańska Forest with over 50 improvised troops. Shortly thereafter, three squadrons of lancers launched a violent charge towards the village of Grądy. At the cost of heavy losses, approximately 140–200 cavalrymen broke through the encirclement ring. Several other small Home Army units also managed to escape from the cauldron near Jaktorów.\nThe Battle of Jaktorów was probably the largest partisan battle fought during World War II on Polish land west of the Vistula river, and it also marked the final battle of the Kampinos Group. The Polish formation was defeated, losing probably around 150–200 killed, about 120 wounded, and 150 taken prisoner. Most of the horses, almost all heavy weapons, wagons, and supplies of equipment and ammunition were also lost. German losses probably amounted to around 100–150 killed and wounded. Polish soldiers also managed to shoot down an Focke-Wulf Fw 189 Uhu reconnaissance aircraft and destroy or damage several German armored vehicles.\n\n\n==== Epilogue ====\n\nOn October 1, the command of the 9th Army issued an order to end Operation Sternschnuppe. According to preserved German reports, during the combing of the forest and the pursuit of Home Army units, German forces killed 76 partisans, while another 44 were taken prisoner (this number does not include the losses suffered by the Polish group near Jaktorów). German units also detained 804 able-bodied men. Eight villages were completely destroyed, and a significant number of farms were burned down in another eighteen. Young men suspected of fighting in the ranks of the partisan movement were executed.\nAfter the defeat at Jaktorów, many soldiers of the Kampinos Group continued to fight against the German occupiers. Lieutenant \"Dolina\" managed to gather nearly 200 survivors, then moved from Puszcza Mariańska to the Opoczno forests, where he established contact with local structures of the Home Army. \"Dolina's\" soldiers then fought in the ranks of the 25th Ziemia Piotrkowsko-Opoczyńska Infantry Regiment of the Home Army. When the regiment was disbanded after heavy fighting near Wincentów on November 9, \"Dolina\" formed a cavalry unit of about 60 men, with whom he continued to fight until January 1945. Another 66 soldiers from the Kampinos Group joined the partisan unit of the Home Army led by Lieutenant Antoni Heda, alias \"Szary\". Until 8 October 1944, the aviation company led by Lieutenant \"Lawa\" also continued to fight, having separated from the main forces of the Kampinos Group shortly before the battle at Jaktorów.\nAt least 100 partisans managed to return to the Kampinos Forest, where they hid in very difficult conditions, awaiting the arrival of the Eastern Front. The local underground network, led by Lieutenant Bohdan Jaworski, alias \"Wyrwa\" (previously the deputy commander of the Palmiry-Młociny Regiment) and Lieutenant Józef Karney, codenamed \"Drewno\" (previously the commander of the parachute platoon), tried to assist the escapees by providing food, civilian clothing, false documents, and, as far as possible, accommodating them in the hospital in Laski.\n\n\n=== Summary ===\nBetween July 29 and September 29, 1944, the units of the Kampinos Group engaged in 47 battles and skirmishes. Ten of these encounters ended in clear victories for the Poles, while in thirteen cases, the enemy's losses far exceeded those of the insurgents. Józef Krzyczkowski reported that during the two-month-long battles, 764 soldiers of the Home Army were killed, and 385 were wounded. The authors of the preface to the monograph \"Obroża\" in the conspiracy and the Warsaw Uprising estimated the overall losses of the Kampinos Group at 801 killed and 493 wounded. Jerzy Koszada, on the other hand, stated that the losses of the Polish group reached about 900 killed and 500 wounded. During the uprising, dozens of residents of the Kampinos villages were also killed by the Germans. The losses suffered by the Germans in the fights with the Kampinos Group are estimated by Polish historians at about 1,000–1,200 killed and about 400–460 wounded.\nThe Kampinos Group liberated a significant part of the Kampinos Forest from German occupation for two months, inhabited by several thousand people. Its attacks probably forced the Germans to abandon the use of the Bielany airfield. The presence of a strong partisan group also prevented the Germans from using safe and convenient forest routes leading from Leszno and Warsaw to Kazuń and Modlin and created a threat to an important German communication line, the Warsaw–Modlin road. By engaging significant German forces for two months, the Kampinos Group relieved the insurgent Warsaw, especially the Żoliborz group led by Lieutenant Colonel \"Żywieciel\". Moreover, as the only organized Home Army unit, it executed the order of General \"Bór\" from 14 August 1944, regarding the organization of relief for the capital, directing over 900 well-armed soldiers to Żoliborz.\nThe German command considered the Kampinos Group a serious threat to the rear of the troops fighting in Warsaw and on the Vistula line. In reality, however, the Polish group did not undertake any significant offensive actions in the German rear, especially when the 9th Army was in its greatest crisis. According to Jerzy Kirchmayer and Józef Krzyczkowski, this opportunity was not seized due to the passivity and neglect of the insurgent command. Adam Borkiewicz, summarizing the actions of the Kampinos Group, also concluded that its efforts, due to poor leadership, did not affect the outcome of the Warsaw Uprising.\nThe Kampinos Group was the only large combat unit of the Warsaw Uprising that did not end the fight with capitulation.\n\n\n== Organizational structure ==\n\n\n=== Ordre de Bataille 31 July 1944 ===\nOn the eve of the Warsaw

District, later transformed into the Quartermaster of the Kampinos Group, was led by Captain Wojciech Dwornicki, alias \"Wojtek\". His deputy was Second Lieutenant Aleksander Wolski, alias \"Jastrząb\".\nThe radio center organized at the command of the VIII District (later the Kampinos Group) was directed by Captain Aleksander Jedliński, alias \"Franek\". His deputy was Captain Stefan Jachowicz, alias \"Dębina\". Since 4 August 1944, the radio center in Kampinos Forest maintained communication with Polish radio centers in London and Italy.\nAt the end of August 1944, the position of the head of the medical corps of the Kampinos Group was assumed by Captain Dr. Cyprian Sadowski, alias \"Skiba\". Medical care for wounded and sick soldiers and civilians was provided by:\n\nA hospital at the institution for the blind in Laski, led by Dr. Kazimierz Cebertowicz, alias \"Świerk\". The hospital operated in the territory controlled by the Germans, so medical assistance was provided to the wounded insurgents under clandestine conditions;\na field hospital in Krogulec, led by Dr. Antoni Banis, alias \"Kleszczyk\";\nfield reserve hospitals in Kuszczew and Gawartowa Wola, led by Dr. Zdzisław Askamas, alias \"Dąb\";\na medical point in Dąbrowa Leśna, intended for lightly wounded, led by Dr. Longinus Pajewski, alias \"Adam II\".\nThe role of chaplains in the Kampinos Group was fulfilled by: Father Jerzy Baszkiewicz, alias \"Radwan II\", Father Wacław Karłowicz, alias \"Andrzej Bobola,\" and Father Hilary Praczyński, alias \"Gwardian\" (the latter arrived from the Eastern Borderlands with the Naliboki Group). During the occupation and the uprising, active involvement in underground activities was also undertaken by the chaplain of the hospital in Laski, Father Stefan Wyszyński, alias \"Radwan III\" (later the Primate of Poland).\n\n\n== Commemoration ==\n\nIn the early years of the Polska Ludowa, efforts to commemorate the armed actions of the Kampinos Group encountered numerous obstacles from the communist authorities. In 1946, Polish Workers' Party squads from Leszno vandalized the partisan cemetery in Wiersze. In the 1950s, the communist authorities also decided to liquidate the cemetery of the soldiers of the Kampinos Group in Budy Zosine, ordering the transfer of the remains to the Warsaw Insurgents Cemetery.\nDespite the unfavorable political conditions, the veteran community centered around the first commander of the Kampinos Group, Captain Józef Krzyczkowski, alias \"Szymon\", quickly developed energetic activity. One of the first initiatives of the veterans was to ensure a dignified burial for soldiers killed in the attacks on the Bielany airfield and to secure individual partisan graves in the forest. The Polish October also allowed for the reconstruction of the neglected and vandalized cemetery in Wiersze. Moreover, as a result of numerous efforts and interventions by veterans, the state authorities agreed to rebuild the cemetery in Budy Zosine and to relocate the remains of soldiers who fell near Jaktorów.\nAt the beginning of the second decade of the 21st century, the armed actions of the soldiers of the Kampinos Group were commemorated in the following ways:\n\nBudy Zosine – the remains of 132 soldiers of the Kampinos Group who fell in the Battle of Jaktorów rest in the military cemetery in Budy Zosine. In 2004, through the efforts of the Council for the Protection of Struggle and Martyrdom Sites, the cemetery was modernized. The monument, which had been there since 1964, was replaced with a granite cross.\nDąbrowa Leśna – there is a monument commemorating, among others, the soldiers of the youth company who fought in the ranks of the Kampinos Group, located on Partyzantów Street.\nDziekanów Polski – a plaque commemorating the stay of the soldiers of the Stowbtsy-Nalibocki Group in the village is located on the school grounds.\nLaski:\n at the Educational and Rehabilitation Center for Blind Children named after Róża Czacka, there is a memorial plaque informing that a hospital of the Kampinos Group operated on the premises during the Warsaw Uprising. There is also a plaque commemorating the friendly relations between soldiers of the Hungarian II Reserve Corps and the Warsaw insurgents and inhabitants of the Kampinos villages;\n at the military cemetery in Laski, next to several hundred soldiers who fell in September 1939, the remains of soldiers of the Kampinos Group who died in attacks on the Bielany airfield and members of the VIII District conspiracy rest.\nLeszno – there is a monument on the city square commemorating the soldiers of the Kampinos Group as well as the inhabitants of Leszno who died and were murdered in the years 1939–1945.\nTruskaw – in August 1971, a commemorative stone and plaque were unveiled at the crossroads leading from Izabelin and Borzęcin to Pociecha, dedicated to the soldiers of the Polish Army, the Home Army, and the residents of Truskaw and neighboring villages who died and were murdered during World War II. In September 2002, another plaque was unveiled at the monument, commemorating the victorious raid of Lieutenant \"Dolina's\" unit on the night of /3S eptember 1944.\nPociecha – on a small hill surrounded by a wall, there is a monument honoring the soldiers of the Jerzyki Company who died defending the village from August 28 to September 2, 1944.

It starts from the border with Montenegro, passes through cities such as Peja and Pristina, and ends at the Serbian border. The road is 143 kilometers long.\n\n\n== Route ==\nThe M9 begins at the closed Montenegro-Kosovo border, at Kuqishte. It passes through Peja and Pristina, offering scenic views and good road conditions. At Gjergjicë, it connects to R7, widening to 2x2 lanes. In Pristina, it intersects with the M2 road at a roundabout, commonly known to locals as the \"Duplex Roundabout.\" After Pristina, it continues as a 1x1 road through the Gollak mountains and ends at Prapashticë.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe N9 once linked the M2 in Montenegro to Pirot, spanning three countries. Notably, the Peja-Pristina section was crucial.\nThe road has been renamed from M9 to N9, but it is unknown when this happened.\n\n\n== References ==",

It is situated at the extreme north of the Cévennes National Park.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\nTaking the shape of an eroded plateau approximately 20 km long in the west–east direction, and 5 to 6 km wide in the north–south direction, the Goulet forms a ridge strictly parallel to that of Mont Lozère (1,699 m) to the south and that of Moure de la Gardille (1,503 m) to the north.\n\n\n=== Hydrology ===\nMany rivers have their source (including the Lot) on the mountain. It is located on the watershed between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean.\n\n\n=== Geology ===\nThe Montagne du Goulet is geologically linked to the southern Cévennes. It is formed of shale, and a large fault to the north, oriented east–west, separates it from Triassic and Jurassic transgressive sedimentary formations that overlay the crystalline basement, which extends further north into the Ardèche Cévennes.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nForming a barrier to the east of the Massif Central, in close proximity to the Ardèche, the Goulet receives abundant precipitation (approximately 1,100 to 1,500 mm per year) throughout the year.\n\n\n=== Fauna and Flora ===\nThe mountain has been heavily forested since the early 20th century, mainly with conifers (spruce and fir).\n\n\n== References ==",

        "revision_id": 1219836499,
        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "A by-election is scheduled to be held in the provincial riding of Lambton—Kent—Middlesex in Ontario on May 2, 2024, to elect a new member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario following the resignation of Progressive Conservative MPP and cabinet minister Monte McNaughton.  \nMonte McNaughton resigned for a private sector position as executive vice-president of industry relations and people experience for Woodbine Entertainment Group. \nIt will be held the same day as the 2024 Milton provincial by-election.\n\n\n== Candidates ==\n\n\n=== Progressive Conservative ===\nOn 27 January 2024, Steve Pinsonneault, a Chatham-Kent councillor for 17 years in Ward 3 (Kent East) and businessman in Thamesville, beat Neal Roberts, chief of the Middlesex London Paramedic Service. Pinsonneault has received criticism from various media sources and the ultra conservative Campaign Life Coalition for his support of pay suspension of fellow Chatham-Kent councillor Rhonda Jubenville. This was in response to her conduct following her support of a ban on non-official flags on municipal property.\n\n\n=== New Democratic Party ===\nKathryn Shailer was elected in Watford on February 15th to take up the New Democratic Banner. Shailer is from Alvinston. In the fall of 2022, Shailer ran for Lambton-Kent District School Board trustee in Central Lambton. She was unsuccessful in that bid. Shailer, a mother of two and grandmother of three, has been involved with the Brooke-Alvinston Optimist Club, Friends of Campbell Park, the Lawrence House Centre for the Arts, Alvinston Arts and Music Festival and Community Friendship Meals at Bothwell United Church. Shailer opposes the Dresden, Ontario landfill expansion.\n\n\n=== Liberal ===\nCathy Burghardt-Jesson is running for the Liberal Party of Ontario. She currently serves as the mayor of Lucan-Biddulph and deputy warden for Middlesex County. She was first elected to be deputy mayor of Lucan-Biddulph in 2010, has been mayor since 2014 and was warden of Middlesex County for three one year terms until becoming deputy warden for 2024.\n\n\n=== New Blue ===\nKeith Benn, a geoscientist and local of Wallaceburg, is running an anti-establishment campaign with a reported focus on local issues, affordability, and providing a \"classical conservative\" approach to governance. He previously ran as a candidate for the New Blue Party in the Sarnia-Lambton riding during the 2022 Ontario General Election. Major topics discussed by Benn have included opposition to the dump being built in Dresden, ensuring clean well water, and promoting fiscal conservatism.\nAt his events, he has campaigned against the 'diversity, equity and inclusion' (DEI) focus of schools, opposes Critical Race Theory, and believes in meritocracy.\nHe was involved in investigating the safety of well water after turbine installations in Chatham-Kent.\n\n\n=== Green ===\nAndraena Tilgner, a registered Respiratory therapist is running a campaign with a focus on healthcare issues and Climate change. Tilgner is originally from British Columbia moving to Ontario in 1998. She gained a Bachelor of Health Sciences (BHSc.) from the University of Western Ontario in 2002.\n\n\n=== None of The Above Party ===\nStephen R. Campbell is the candidate for the None of The Above Party, previously running with them as a candidate for MPP in London-Fanshawe. He is a technical support analyst with the Thames Valley District School Board. Campbell opposes the Dresden, Ontario dump plan, Carbon pricing in Canada and Transmission line which Campbell says \"take up valuable farm land\".  \n\n\n=== Ontario Party ===\nCynthia Workman, a resident of Thamesville and 2022 Ontario Party candidate in London West is running in this by-election. She was running as an independent until the Ontario Party was re-registered on April 10, 2024. She is also the presumptive candidate for the People's Party of Canada in the soon-to-be-created federal riding of Middlesex-London.\n\n\n=== Family Rights Party ===\nHilda Walton is the candidate running for the Family Rights Party.\n\n\n== Polling ==\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n== 2022 result ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n2024 Milton provincial by-election\nList of Ontario by-elections\n\n\n== References ==",

Janauschek states \"some Irish authors argue that a Cistercian abbey existed in this area of ​​eastern Meath, which was founded by Walter de Lacy, Lord of Meath, first as a daughter of Bell-Bec (in Normandy), and later became a cell of Furness. But those who have looked at the documents, understand that the manor of that abbey was there as long as the Normans.\" \nGeraldine Stout, citing Dryburgh and Smith (2006), states that there is no known foundation date for this monastic site but a grant by Walter De Lacy to the church of SS Mary and Laurence of Beaubec and the monks residing there on the lands in Gillekeran has been dated to after 1215. \n\n\n== Modern Day Excavations ==\nExtensive excavations of the site were carried out in the 2019 to 2020 period\n\n\n== External links ==\nVideo about excavations: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXBl91GekZ4\nBeaubec Excavations Blog: https://beaubec.home.blog/\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nJanauschek, Leopold (1877).

        "content": "James Watson (1766? – 12 February 1838) was a British Spencean radical.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nWatson was born about 1766. He was probably a Scotsman, and may have been the person of that name who in 1787 published at Edinburgh a ‘Dissertatio Inauguralis Medica de Amenorrhea.’ He afterwards came to London, and was officially described in 1817 as ‘surgeon, late of Bloomsbury,’ where he lived in Hyde Street with his son, who bore the same name and is similarly described. He may, however, have been only a chemist and apothecary, as he is called in his obituary notice; and in any case he could have had little practice, as he was in very poor circumstances. “Dr.” Watson and his son James early connected themselves with the ‘Societies of Spencean Philanthropists’ founded in 1814 by Thomas Evans, a traces-maker, to carry on the designs of Thomas Spence. They held that private ownership of land was unchristian, and advocated ‘parochial partnership.’ They met weekly at one or other of four London taverns, the chief of which was the Cock in Grafton Street, Soho. In spite of the alarmist reports of the secret committees of the two houses of parliament in 1817, the Spenceans were very harmless as a body, and not only never had provincial branches, but, as Evans told Francis Place, at no time numbered more than fifty persons. The peace of 1815 was followed by great distress and discontent among the labouring population, and of this some of the Spenceans, including the Watsons (father and son) and Arthur Thistlewood, constituted themselves exponents. They were joined by a man named Castle, a figure or doll maker, and a committee was formed consisting of themselves and two others, operatives named Thomas Preston and John Hooper. They met in Greystoke Place, near Fetter Lane. Castle, it seems highly probable, acted throughout as an agent provocateur for the government. According to his story, he struck up an acquaintance with the others at a Spencean meeting in the autumn of 1816, and went about with Watson preparing a revolution which was to follow public meetings in Spa Fields. Thistlewood was to be the head, and the other five, generals under him, Watson the elder being second in command. Attempts were made to rouse the discontented workmen, and especially the ‘navigators’ in Paddington, and some efforts were made to seduce the soldiers. Watson himself prepared combustibles for blowing up the cavalry barracks in Portman Square. Two hundred and fifty pikes were made. The streets were to be barricaded and the Tower and the Bank seized. On 15 November 1816 a meeting of distressed operatives was held in Spa Fields, Islington, at which all the conspirators were present. Henry Hunt addressed them. A petition was prepared which he was to present to the prince regent, and a further meeting was to be called to receive the answer to it. It was proposed that this should take place after the assembling of parliament in the following February; but young Watson opposed this, and it was agreed that the second meeting should be held on 2 December. Placards were printed and posted in London summoning workmen to attend, and declaring that there were ‘four million in distress.’ Hunt's petition was not received, and he himself contrived to be late for the meeting on 2 December. The elder Watson opened the meeting on that day. He spoke from a waggon, and concluded, ‘Ever since the Norman conquest kings and lords have been deluding you … but this must last no longer.’ His son succeeded in a much more violent strain, with allusions to African slaves and Wat Tyler and a personal attack upon the regent. Finally exclaiming: ‘If they will not give us what we want, shall we not take it?’ he seized a tricolour and called on the people to follow him. The mob then went through Clerkenwell and Smithfield to Snow Hill. A gunsmith's shop in Skinner Street was plundered, and young Watson wounded with a pistol a customer who was in it named Platt. He was arrested, but escaped after having lain concealed for some months in a house in Bayham Street belonging to his father's friend, Henry Holl, an actor.\nMeanwhile the mob was met at the Royal Exchange by the lord mayor and a few police, who succeeded in taking their flag from them. Part of them then went through the Minories, where they rifled another gunsmith's shop, towards the Tower. Thistlewood and the elder Watson called to the soldiers on guard to surrender. Soon afterwards, when a few soldiers showed themselves, the people were easily dispersed. The same evening Watson and Thistlewood were arrested at Highgate on suspicion of being footpads. They were armed, and made some resistance. Next day they were committed to the Tower, with Preston and Hooper. A plan of the Tower and of the contemplated operations was found at Watson's new lodgings at Dean Street, Fetter Lane, as well as a list of a ‘committee of public safety,’ which contained the names of Sir Francis Burdett, Lord Cochrane, Major Cartwright, Hunt, and other radicals. On 29 April 1817 a true bill was found by the grand jury of Middlesex against the prisoners, who were charged with high treason. On 17 May they were arraigned and assigned counsel. The younger Watson was included in the indictment, and a reward of 500l. was offered for his apprehension. The trial began on 9 June before the court of king's bench, presided over by Lord Ellenborough. Watson was tried first. The proceedings against him lasted a whole week. For the crown the chief law officers, Sir Samuel Shepherd and Sir Robert Gifford (afterwards first Baron Gifford) testified to the comparative moderation of the elder Watson, who briefly disclaimed having had any intention whatever against ‘the form of government established by king, lords, and commons.’ In spite of an able reply by the solicitor-general, and the summing up of Ellenborough in favour of the prosecution, the jury brought in a verdict of ‘not guilty.’ The prosecution of the remaining prisoners was then dropped. Legal authorities held that had Watson and his associates been indicted merely for riot, they must have been convicted; but the government, it was thought, desired something on which they could ground the repressive measures which they soon afterwards passed. In Place's opinion, which appears to be borne out by other considerations, the mob were ‘a contemptible set of fools and miscreants, whom twenty constables could have dispersed.’ Watson was ‘a half-crazy creature,’ and his son ‘a wild, profligate fellow as crazy as his father.’ The elder was, he adds, a man of loose habits and wretchedly poor. He continued his life as an agitator (‘Memoirs of R. P. Ward,’ quoted in Walpole's Hist. of England, ii. 37). He was not personally implicated in the Cato Street conspiracy, though his son was. Some time afterwards, however, he went to America, where he died in poor circumstances at New York on 12 February 1838.\nSamuel Bamford, who met him soon after the trial, describes Watson as having somewhat of a polish in his gait and manner, and a certain respectability and neatness in his dress. Watson and his friend Preston were in Bamford's opinion two of the most influential leaders of the London operative reformers of the day, though the first had a better heart than head. The younger Watson died two years before his father.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSpa Fields riots\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Norgate, Gerald le Grys (1899). \"Watson, James (1766?-1838)\".

        "content": "The 426 Battalion rebellion (Indonesian: Pemberontakan Batalyon 426), also known as The ex-426 Battalion rebellion, was a conflict that occurred from 8 December 1951 to 9 April 1952 between the Indonesian government and the 426 Battalion which was supported by Darul Islam.\n\n\n== Background ==\n426 Battalion personnel consisted of former members of Hizbullah and Sabilillah in Surakarta. These former Hezbollah members sympathized with the Darul Islam movement. They helped the DI/TII movement by supplying weapons when they were stationed in Demak and involved in the operation to eradicate the disruptive troops at the Merapi Merbabu Complex. Hurt by being merged into the Pragolo Brigade and receiving discriminatory treatment because of the Hezbollah origins, 426 Battalion decided to rebel with the support of DI/TII.\nHearing of 426 Battalion's support for the Darul Islam movement, Major Munawar and Captain Sofyan received orders to go to the Diponegoro Division headquarters for inspection on December 7, 1951. Only Major Munawar came to the headquarters while Captain Sofyan refused. Captain Sofyan admitted that three of his companies had joined Darul Islam.\n\n\n== Beginning of the rebellion ==\n\n\n=== December 1951 ===\nThe rebellion erupted on December 8, 1951, marked by fighting between former 426 Battalion troops and the Indonesian soldiers in Kudus in response to Captain Sofyan's refusal to surrender. The fighting lasted until the afternoon due to the heavy rain. Taking advantage of this condition, the former 426 Battalion troops secretly fled from Kudus. One company fled to Mount Muria while the other two headed southeast of Kudus towards their base area, Surakarta. In response to the rebellion, the government arrested 75 people who were suspected of having close ties to the rebels.\nMeanwhile, two companies of 426 Battalion led by Captain Alif who were undergoing training in Magelang escaped from the Dodik dormitory to the south in the early hours of December 10 by disguising as ordinary residents. Then, each company was assigned to go to a different place. One company led by Muhyiddin fled to the south while the company led by Captain Alif went north. While fleeing, Muhyiddin's troops attacked the Muntilan police station and freed 11 prisoners who were then armed. As a result of this incident, access to Magelang was closed, causing the city to become deserted and a curfew was implemented. On the other hand, Major Munawar, who was wearing thug-like clothes, was captured in Klaten on December 10, 1951.\nTroops from the former 426 Battalion led by Captain Alif arrived in Klaten on December 15, 1951, after passing through various areas. Upon arrival in Klaten, they built defensive ditches in Ngupit,Trucuk, and Cawas. From 16 to 20 December 1951, troops from former 426 Battalion attacked Delanggu and Karanganom. The fighting lasted for four days and one of the police officers, Sudomo, died. An armed confrontation between former 426 Battalion troops and the TNI also occurred in Ngupit and killed Major Kusmanto.  As a result of this rebellion, the Klaten government imposed a curfew from 8 PM to 5 AM.\nIn mid-December 1951, former 426 Battalion troops operated in the Semarang, Purwodadi-Grobogan, Salatiga, Kedu Residency, Yogyakarta-Purworejo and Surakarta areas. They also tried to enter East Java via Ngawi. However, their efforts were thwarted by the TNI.\nMeanwhile, troops from the former 426 Battalion led by Captain Sofyan continued to move. From mid to late December, Sofyan and his troops moved from Purwodadi, Purwodadi, Grobogan, Purwodadi to Klaten to meet up with his colleagues, passing through several areas in Central Java and East Java. While stopping in Wonogiri, Sofyan succeeded in recruiting local youth by naming his troops the Tax Liberation Army. Captain Sofyan's troops arrived in Klaten four weeks after the outbreak of the rebellion.\nTo quell the rebellion of ex-426 Battalion troops, the Diponegoro Division launched Operation Sapta Marga Merdeka Timur V led by Mochammad Bachrun on 19 December 1951. Yon 421, Yon 422, Yon 424, Yon 425, Yon 408, Yon 417, Yon 413, Yon 414 and Yon 446 were included in this military operation. Apart from that, joint army-police forces also carried out cleaning activities in the area of Klaten and surrounding areas.\n\n\n=== January 1952 ===\nIn January 1952, the strength of the former 426 Battalion was weakened as a result of the TNI's pursuit which caused their troops to be scattered. They damaged roads and burned residents' houses in the Klaten area. Jatinom District was the area worst affected by this rebellion. The leader of the rebellion, Captain Sofyan, was killed on 2 January and then Sonhaji on 5 January. Both were buried in the Wonogiri area. After the death of Captain Sofyan, leadership of the former 426 Battalion troops was handed over to Major A.G Ismail.\nIn mid-January 1952, former 426 Battalion troops operated in three areas, namely Klaten, Boyolali and Kedu. In Boyolali, rebel troops succeeded in controlling the Simo District while in Klaten the rebels succeeded in killing Major Sunaryo during a battle in Juwiring on January 5, 1952. Apart from that, the government also arrested religious leaders in Kauman, Surakarta on January 2, 1952, and imposed a state of emergency in the Surakarta area on January 1, 1952. \n\n\n=== February 1952 ===\nThe TNI continued to pursue rebel forces in February. The TNI succeeded in capturing Simo, and this caused the former 426 Battalion's troops to spread to various areas in Boyolali. They had to hide in a rural area in Boyolali. The burning of residents' houses by former 426 Battalion's troops occurred in February in five villages in Nogosari and Temon. \nIn Klaten and Kedu, fighting between former 426 Battalion troops and the TNI also occurred. For the Klaten area, fighting took place in Pedan, Trucuk, and Cawas. In Bendungan, Wonosobo Captain Alif and 100 of his troops were captured by the TNI after fleeing when told to show them where their weapons were hidden.\n\n\n=== March-May 1952 ===\nEntering March 1952, the movement of ex-426 Battalion troops became increasingly squeezed. They experienced logistical problems because the local population was reluctant to assist the rebel forces. As a result, they chose to rob to survive. Even so, a hundred rebel troops managed to regain control of Simo.\nOn April 6, 1952, former 426 Battalion troops fled from Surakarta to Kaliurang to join DI/TII troops in the Central Java region. However, they were heavily attacked by TNI troops and tried to escape into the area of the National Bull Movement (GBN). Rebel troops only managed to enter the GBN area on May 3. \n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe rebellion was declared over on May 9, 1952, after 125 rebels joined the DI/TII group led by Jamil. The rest of the 426 Battalion joined the armed group in Merapi Merbabu Complex and DI/TII troops in the Brebes and Pekalongan areas or tried to join DI/TII troops in West Java.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nKodam VII/Diponegoro, Kodam VII/Diponegoro (1968).

        "content": "William Bruce (16 November 1790 – 25 October 1868) was an Irish Presbyterian minister and professor.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBruce was born at Belfast 16 November 1790. He was the second son of minister William Bruce. He was educated first at the Belfast Academy under his father; entered Trinity College, Dublin, on 2 July 1804, where he obtained a scholarship and graduated A.B. on 20 July 1809. Meantime he attended a session (1808–1809) at Edinburgh, where he studied moral philosophy, church history, &c., under Dugald Stewart, Hugh Meiklejohn, and others. His theological studies were directed by the Antrim presbytery, by which body he was licensed on 25 June 1811. On 19 January 1812 he was called to First Belfast as colleague to his father, and ordained 3 March. He had few of his father's gifts, but his quiet firmness and amiability gave him a hold on the affections of his people. Theologically he followed closely in his father's steps. It is believed that he edited the Belfast edition, 1819, 8vo, of ‘Sermons on the Christian Doctrine,’ by Richard Price, D.D. (originally published 1787), which contain a mild assertion of a modified Arianism, as a middle way between Calvinism and Socinianism. In 1821 Bruce came forward as a candidate for the vacant classical and Hebrew chair in the Belfast Academical Institution. Two-thirds of the Arian vote went against Bruce, in consequence of the hostility hitherto shown to the institution by his family; but Sir Robert Bateson, the episcopalian leader, and Edward Reid of Ramelton, moderator of the general synod, made efforts for Bruce, and he was elected on 27 October by a large majority. The appointment conciliated a section which had stood aloof from the institution on the ground that it had sympathised with unconstitutional principles in 1798, and ultimately the government grant, which had been withdrawn on that account, was renewed (27 February 1829). Bruce, still keeping his congregation, held the chair with solid repute till the establishment of the Queen's College (opened November 1849) reduced the Academical Institution to the rank of a high school. The Hebrew chair was separated from that of classics in 1825, when Thomas Dix Hincks, LL.D., another Arian, was appointed to fill it. Bruce took no active share in the polemics of his time. An early and anonymous publication on the Trinity sufficiently defines his position. In later life he headed the conservative minority in the Antrim presbytery, maintaining that nonsubscribing principles not only allowed but required a presbytery to satisfy itself as to the Christian faith of candidates for the ministry. The discussion was conducted with much acrimony (not on Bruce's part), and ended in the withdrawal of five congregations, since recognised by the government as a distinct ecclesiastical body, the northern presbytery of Antrim, of which, at its first meeting, 4 April 1862, Bruce was elected moderator. In the same year the jubilee of his ordination was marked by the placing of stained glass windows in his meeting-house. He retired from active duty on 21 April 1867. From 1832 he had as colleague John Scott Porter, who remained sole pastor. He continued his services to many of the charities and public bodies of the town. He studied agriculture, and carefully planted his own grounds at The Farm. His last sermon was at a communion in Larne on 28 April 1867. He died 25 October 1868, and was buried at Holywood 28 October. On 20 May 1823 he married Jane Elizabeth (died 27 November 1878, aged 79), only child of William Smith of Barbadoes and Catherine Wentworth. By her he had four sons and six daughters; his first-born died in infancy; William died 7 November 1868, aged 43; Samuel died 6 March 1871, aged 44.\nHe published: \n\n‘Observations on the Doctrine of the Trinity, occasioned by the Rev.

Today, it is accepted to define as Matzah Shmura only matzah that was baked from wheat that was guarded from contact with water from the time of harvesting; however, since there are different opinions among the early decisors regarding whether the guarding needs to be from the time of harvesting, from the time of grinding, or from the time of kneading, someone who only has matzah that was guarded from one of these times for the mitzvah of eating matzah should eat it for the sake of the mitzvah commandment (possibly without a blessing) in order to satisfy these opinions.\nIn addition, the matzah for the mitzvah also needs another element of guarding, meaning it needs to be \"for its sake\", that is, the harvesting and guarding of the matzahs should be done for the sake of the mitzvah of eating matzah, and not for any other purpose.\n\n\n== The sources to Matzah Shmura ==\nThe source for the need for shemurah matzah is in the Talmud. where it concludes that there is a commandment to guard the matzahs for Passover, based on the verse However, the Talmud deliberates whether the need for guarding is from the time of baking or perhaps already from the time of harvesting.\nAccording to Jewish law, it is decided that it is best to be stringent and have guarding from the time of harvesting, but it is also sufficient to guard from the time of grinding, and in pressing circumstances, it is even possible to rely on the third opinion and buy flour from the market, and to guard it from the time of kneading. In addition, different decisors understood that the need is only for guarding the matzah for the Seder night and not for the rest of the holiday, for which regular guarding, meaning from the time of baking, is sufficient.\nThese decisors also differed in the question of whether there is a need to intend \"for the sake of matzah\", meaning to prevent water contact with the flour, or \"for the sake of the commandment\", meaning a special intention is required for the mitzvah of eating the matzah on the Seder night.\nOther decisors (led by the Rif and the Rambam) understood that the commandment applies to all the matzahs eaten on the Passover holiday and not just those on the Seder night, and it seems that according to their opinion, the guarding does not require intention for the sake of the commandment, but only to prevent leavening and.\nThe prevalent custom nowadays is to eat shmurah matzahs on the Seder night only, and on the rest of the holiday to eat \"regular\" matzahs. However, there are those who are stringent and eat shmurah matzahs throughout the entire holiday, and there are those who are lenient and even on the Seder night eat matzahs that were not guarded from the time of harvesting but only from the time of grinding (or kneading) according to the lenient opinions among the early decisors.\nSome of the early decisors believed that at the time when the Passover sacrifice is offered and the obligation to eat matzah and bitter herbs together with an olive's volume from the Passover sacrifice is from the Torah to fulfill \"with matzahs and bitter herbs they shall eat it\", and its commandment at the end of the meal (eaten on a full stomach), they refrained from eating shmurah matzah at the beginning of the Seder so that they could bless \"on eating matzah\" on the mitzvah matzah, and the matzahs of the meal that were eaten before were made specifically not from guarded flour.\nThese traditions are very ancient, and they preserve what was customary in the past. In addition, in the last generation, shmurah matzahs are also produced by machines - 'machine shmurah matzahs', which are square like regular matzahs, but in their production process, the rules of 'shmurah' are observed. At the time of the wheat harvest itself, a supervisor is present with the combine driver, checking that there are no issues of mixed species and the like, which could affect the kosher status.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Fletcher Blakely (13 May 1783 – 25 February 1862) was an Irish non-subscribing Presbyterian minister.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBlakely was born on 13 May 1783 at Ballyroney, County Down. He was the youngest son of Joseph Bleakly, a farmer, and was named after the Rev. William Fletcher, presbyterian minister of Ballyroney (d. 1824), who gave him his early training; both his parents died when he was very young. In 1799 he entered Glasgow College (at which time he spelled his name Bleakly), where he graduated. On 19 September 1809 he was ordained by Bangor presbytery as minister of Moneyrea, county Down, in succession to Samuel Patton. Fletcher had trained him in Calvinism, but he did not long retain this form of theology. He became by degrees a Unitarian of what was then a very advanced type in Ireland, being the first avowed humanitarian preacher in Ulster (after 1813; see Mon. Rep. 1813. p. 515). Under his influence Moneyrea was so marked a home of heterodox opinion that it passed into a proverb, 'Moneyrea, where there is one God and no Devil.' When, in 1821, the English unitarians sent John Smethurst (1792–1859) on a mission to Ulster, the Moneyrea meeting-house was the first that was opened to him; the Arian pulpits were (with five exceptions) refused to him. In 1829 Blakely, with his whole congregation, joined the remonstrant secession from the synod of Ulster; he had throughout the previous synodical debates been one of the most powerful coadjutors of Henry Montgomery, the leader of the New Light party, and assisted him in forming the remonstrant synod. On 27 April 1836 a public testimonial bore witness to his successful advocacy of the rights of conscience and human freedom.' In his own neighbourhood he did much for popular education, for the cause of tenant right, and for the promotion of the flax industry. He was a joint-editor (1830–3) of the 'Bible Christian,' and published two or three tracts and sermons, especially: \n\n'A Dialogue,' Belf. 1817, 8vo (anon.), on the bible and other standards of faith (not seen; it was answered by a covenanting minister, not Paul).\n'The Battle of the Two Dialogues, being a conversation between a Rev. Covenanter and a Rev. Presbyterian on the impropriety of adhering to any standard of faith except the Bible,’ Belf. 1818, 8vo (also anon.; in reply to it John Paul, then covenanting minister of Loughmourne, afterwards of Carrickfergus and D.D. (died 17 March 1848, aged 71), published his first work, ‘Creeds and Confessions defended,’ &c., Belf. 1819, 8vo, which is one of the most caustic pieces of satire ever contributed on the orthodox side of the religious controversies in Ulster).\n‘The Doctrine of the Trinity not comprised in the Faith which was once delivered unto the Saints’ (Jude 1–3), London, 1846, 8vo.\n‘An Explicit Avowal of Truth the best mode of teaching it’ (Romans i. 16), Belfast, 1853, 8vo (preached as president of the Association of Irish Nonsubscribing Presbyterians).\nHe resigned his charge on 22 September 1857, but continued to preach till the installation of his successor, John Jellie, on 27 September 1859. He died on 25 February 1862 at Cradley, Worcestershire, the residence of the Rev. William Cochrane, who had married his eldest child. He was buried at Moneyrea. He married Margaret Lindsay (1783–1825), and had four children: Jane, as above; Sarah (1814–1844); David Lindsay, inspector of Irish National Schools (1816–1854); and William Joseph (born 17 April 1818), unitarian minister at Billingshurst, Sussex, in 1839, ordained on 15 December 1840 by Bangor remonstrant presbytery as minister of York Street, Belfast, and died on 19 March 1842.\n\n\n== References ==\nSpecific\n\nGeneral\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Gordon, Alexander (1886). \"Blakely, Fletcher\".

Coached by Mo Youxue, he improved rapidly and won his first professional competition in the 60 metres at the 3rd Indoor Invitational Meeting in Sichuan Xipu Training Base in Chengdu. His running style has been compared to Su Bingtian. He improved his 100 m time gradually to 10.21 seconds during the 2023 outdoor season.\nAt the 2023 Chinese Athletics Championships, Xinrui won all three rounds of the 100 m. In the finals, he ran just 0.02 seconds off his personal best despite significant rainfall.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nXinrui was born Guangzhou and had participated in sprinting as early as elementary school, driven by his parents' desire to improve his poor health. Xinrui completed his freshman year at Jinan University majoring in physical education in 2023. In late 2022, he began representing the Guangxi regional team in Chinese competition.\nSince high school, Xinrui has changed his WeChat name to reflect his time goals in the 100 metres, originally with a goal of \"1050\" for 10.50 seconds. In 2023, he changed it to \"1025\" and later \"1010\" after he ran 10.21 seconds.\n\n\n== Statistics ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDeng Xinrui at World Athletics",

The spire is subulate and mamillate. The sutures are impressed and deep. The shell contains five, convex whorls. The body whorl is rounded. The base of the shell is smooth. The perforation is small. The aperture is ovate, elongated and effuse. The fold on the columella is obtuse and thick.\nRemarks.—The aperture is large, acute above and rounded and effuse below. The body whorl expands rather suddenly beyond the line of the rest, and is more than half the length of the shell. The fold on the columella is broad at base, but slightly elevated, and obtuse. The surface of the shell is remarkably glabrous and shining.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nFossils of this marine species have been found in Late Miocene to Middle Pliocene strata of the Yorktown Formation in Virginia, USA.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCunha, C.

        "content": "Bridget (Morrison) Radcliffe (Countess of Sussex) (c. 1575 – c. 1623) was an English noblewoman.\n\n\n== Marriage and Issue ==\nBridget married Robert Radclyffe, 5th Earl of Sussex in 1592 in Clerkenwell, Middlesex, England.\nTogether they had four children:\n\nElizabeth (Radcliffe) Ramsey, (31 May 1594, London - 6 December 1618), married John Ramsay, 1st Earl of Holderness on 9 Feb 1608 in Whitehall Palace, Westminster, Middlesex, England, died 6 Dec 1618 in London due to smallpox. Their wedding was celebrated with the masque The Hue and Cry After Cupid on 9 February 1608.\nHenry Radcliffe (1 August 1596 - 15 Sep 1620) married Jane Stanhope, daughter of Michael Stanhope.\nThomas Radcliffe (15 July 1597 - 14 Aug 1619)\nHonour Radcliffe, (27 August 1598 - 14 May 1613)\nThough contemporaries praised Bridget's wit, grace, charm, and beauty (see expressions given in the dedications below), their marriage was not solid. John Manningham, who kept a diary, chronicled in his Diary, 12 October 1602, that the earl was unfaithful, treated her cruelly, and that before 1602 she and her children separated from Sussex, who allowed her £1,700 a year.\n\nThe full quote of John Manningham regarding this unfortunate situation is:\n\nThe Earle of Sussex keepes Mrs. Syluester Morgan (sometyme his ladies gentlewoman) at Dr. Daylies house as his mistress, calls hir his Countesse, hyres Captain Whitlocke,102 with monie and cast suites, to braue his Countes, with telling of hir howe he buyes his[Pg 61] wench a wascote of 10l., and puts hir in hir veluet gowne, &c.: thus, not content to abuse hir by keeping a common wench, he striues to invent meanes of more greife to his lady, whoe is of a verry goodly and comely personage, of an excellent presence, and a rare witt. Shee hath brought the Earle to allowe hir 1700l. a yeare for the maintenaunce of hir selfe and hir children while she lives apart. It is coniectured that Captain Whitlocke, like a base pander, hath incited the Earl to followe this sensuall humour,     *  *  *   as he did the Earl of Rutland. (J. Bramstone nar.) The Countesse is daughter to the Lady Morrison in Hartfordshire,103 with whom it is like she purposeth to liue.   *  *  *   A practise to bring the nobilitie into contempt and beggery, by nourishing such as may prouoke them to spend all vpon lechery and such base pleasures.\nIn addition to his kept mistress, Mrs. Sylvester Morgan, Bridget’s former waiting gentlewoman, Robert Radclyffe, 5th Earl of Sussex had an intimate relationship with Frances Meautas Shute, daughter of Hercules Meautas of West Ham, Essex (c.1548-1587), and Philippa Cooke, widow of Edward Shute. In 1609, Robert Radcliff and Frances Meautas had an illegitimate daughter, Jane Radcliff. \nBridget died in December 1623. The day after she died, Robert Radclyffe, 5th Earl of Sussex married Frances, widow of Francis Shute, daughter of Hercules Meautas, of West Ham. She died on 18 November 1627.\n\n\n== Dedications ==\nRobert Greene (1592) Greene, who dedicated several works to Robert Radclyffe, 5th Earl of Sussex, dedicated Philomela; The Lady Fitzwalter’s Nightingale to Bridget.  An excerpt from the dedication is quoted: your ladyship had far more perfections than years, & more inward excellence than extern beauty, yet so beautiful as few so fair, though none more virtuous, I thought the legend of an honourable and chaste lady would be grateful to your honour, whose mind is  wholly delighted in chaste thoughts, keeping herein a perfect decorum to appropriate the nature of the gift to the content of the person.\n\nThomas Kyd (1595) Kid translated and adapted Robert Garnier’s 1573 French drama Cornélie. In his dedication of Cornelia to the Countess of Sussex, Kid laments bitter times and broken passions he had recently endured, and promised another dedication Portia which he did not complete before his death in 1594.\n\nGeorge Chapman (1598) In the prefix to his translation of the Iliad, a sonnet is included for Robert Radclyffe, 5th Earl of Sussex 'with duty always remembered to his honoured countess.'\nWilliam Barley (1596) In his dedication to The Right Honorable and Virtuous Lady Bridgett, Countesse of Sussex, Barley notes her noble and gentle ways, and wishes for her health and happiness. Following his touching dedication, he also composed an Acrostic praise poem for her, showngiven in the below.\n\nThree Galliard songs with titles 'of Countesse of Sussex', attributed to Philip Rosseter, are included in William Barley's A New Book of Tabliture for the Orpharion written and published in 1596:\n\nThe Countesse of Sussex Galliard f.B1r \"P. R.\" \nAnother Galliard of the Countesse of Sussex f.B2r \"PP\" Another Galliard of the Countesse of Sussex f.B3r \"P.R.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

As a result, the club qualified for the 2023–24 AFC Cup for the very first time. However, the club finished bottom of Group G, losing two games to both Bali United and Macarthur FC, though it got its first-ever point with a 2–2 draw against Malaysia's Terengganu FC. In the 2023 edition of the Copa Paulino Alcantara, the club was knocked out in the semifinals by eventual champions Kaya–Iloilo. Due to Liga Futbol Inc.'s relaxing of foreigner regulations, the club let go of many of its older core players and brought in a large number of foreign players, including Copa Sudamericana champion Ezequiel Cirigliano, and Brazilians Gabriel Silva, Magson Dourado, and Théo, The club also managed to keep forward Griffin McDaniel despite interest from Saudi First Division League, A-League, Malaysia Super League, and USL Championship teams.\n\n\n== Squad ==\nAs of 4 April 2024\n\n\n== Transfers ==\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

        "content": "Richard Budd Vincent (1770? – 18 August 1831) was an English Royal Navy captain.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nVincent was born about 1770 at Newbury, Berkshire, where his father Osman Vincent was a banker. John Painter Vincent was his brother. Richard entered the navy in 1781 on board the Britannia, the flagship of Vice-admiral Samuel Barrington, and was present at the relief of Gibraltar and the rencounter with the allied fleet off Cape Spartel in October 1782. He was, after the peace, for three years in the Salisbury on the Newfoundland station, served for four years in the Channel, and on 3 November 1790 was promoted to be lieutenant. In 1793 he went out to the Mediterranean in the Terrible, was present in the operations at Toulon, and in 1794 on the coast of Corsica. In October 1794 he was moved into the Victory, Lord Hood's flagship, then understood to be certain promotion. But in April 1795 Hood was summarily ordered to strike his flag, and Vincent's chance was gone. It did not come again till 29 April 1802, when, after seven years' continuous service, mostly in the North Sea, he was promoted to be commander, and three weeks later was appointed to the Arrow, one of a class of sloops built and armed on a plan proposed by [Sir] Samuel Bentham. She carried, in fact, twenty-eight 32-pounder carronades, an armament heavier, so far as the mere weight of shot was concerned, than that of any frigate then afloat, but, of course, effective at only a very short range. After nearly a year's preventive service in the Channel, she was paid off on 28 February 1803, and recommissioned the next day, again by Vincent, for the Mediterranean, where for the next two years she was mostly engaged in convoying the trade up the Adriatic and Archipelago.\nBy the end of 1804 she was in need of a thorough repair; many of her timbers were rotten, and a survey at Malta decided that she was too weak to heave down; she must go home to be docked. She was accordingly ordered, with the Acheron bomb in company, to take charge of the homeward-bound trade. They sailed from Malta towards the end of January, and on 3 February were seen and chased between Algiers and Cape Tenez by two French frigates of thirty-eight and forty guns, the Incorruptible and Hortense, the only two ships of Villeneuve's squadron which had continued at sea when the squadron itself was driven back by bad weather on 21 January. Between these and the convoy Vincent interposed the Arrow and the Acheron, hoping that he might at least be able to give the merchant ships time to escape. About half-past seven on the morning of the 4th the French frigates brought them to action, and captured both after a brilliant defence of nearly two hours. The Arrow sank almost immediately afterwards, before all her men could be removed; the Acheron was set on fire and destroyed. The merchant ships had meanwhile got away to the westward, and only three of them were captured. Officers and men were taken to Cartagena, whence in May they were sent in a cartel to Gibraltar. They arrived in England early in June. The court-martial on Vincent, held on 17 June, not only ‘most honourably acquitted’ him, but pronounced his conduct ‘highly meritorious and praiseworthy.’\nTwo days after the trial Vincent was advanced to post rank by a commission dated 8 April, and on 3 July the committee of the Patriotic Fund awarded him a sword of the value of 100l., and also a piece of plate of the same value. Four years later the merchants of Malta presented him with a handsome service of plate. In May 1806 Vincent was appointed to the Brilliant on the Cork station, but in October he was obliged by ill-health to resign the command, nor was he able to accept any further employment till March 1808, when he was appointed to the Cambrian in the Mediterranean. From her he moved into the Hind; but in September 1808, being at Malta, he complied with the request of Sir Alexander John Ball to assist him in the duties of the port as captain of the Trident. With Ball and his successors, he remained in the Trident till December 1815, when he was appointed to the Aquilon, in which he returned to England in April 1816. He was nominated a C.B. in June 1815. He had no further service and died on 18 August 1831.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1899). \"Vincent, Richard Budd\".

        "content": "Payin' for My Sins is an album by the American musician Grady Champion, released in 1999. It was his first album for Shanachie Records. Champion supported the album with a North American tour.\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe album was produced by Dennis Walker. Champion cowrote or wrote eight of its songs. Alan Mirikitani contributed on lead guitar. \"Don't Start Me Talkin'\" is a version of the Sonny Boy Williamson II song. \"She's Some Kind of Wonderful\" is a cover of the Soul Brothers Six song. \"Goin' Down Slow\" uses the music of the Jimmy Oden song to relate a story of a cousin succumbing to AIDS.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nThe Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote that \"Champion's strengths in this sometimes funky, always soulful outing, are his strong vocals and songwriting skills, in which he blends his urbane vision into a traditional style.\" The Independent opined that the production gives the \"material a subtlety and classiness not shared by much of the competition.\" The Philadelphia Inquirer concluded that \"you can hear echoes of [Robert] Cray in tracks such as 'You Got Some Explaining to Do', with its tension between the pointed lyrics and smooth, horns-and-organ groove... But his engagingly robust and reedy voice gives Champion a commanding presence of his own.\" The Clarion-Ledger opined that \"Champion's gravely voice and more than capable harmonica make this a very entertaining album.\" The Star Tribune deemed Payin' for My Sins \"one of 1999's most stirring blues platters.\"\nAllMusic said that Champion's \"voice is rough, more a shouter and screamer than a trained singer, sandpaper over silk, with imprecise phrasings.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

It rises about 600 meters above sea level, and the mountain experiences snowfall and accumulation of snow in the winter, It is located along the Mediterranean coastline.The mountain is located in the town of Balaa in the governorate and is surrounded by land from the villages of Kafr Rumman, Anabta, and others. At the top of the mountain is the Roman archaeological site of \"Khirbet Rasheen\". At the base of the mountain, the Ottoman Empire dug the famous Ottoman train tunnel, known as the \"Balaa Tunnel\". The first of its kind at the time in the Middle East. Today, it is one of the most prominent tourist attractions in Palestine.\n\n\n== History ==\nRasheen Mountain is part of the northern Palestinian mountain range, and during the Roman Empire, the mountain included the historic Roman archaeological site of Khirbet Rasheen. It is a historical ruin full of ancient monuments such as wells and some buildings. During the Ottoman Empire, the Ottoman train tunnel (Kherq Balaa) was dug about 800 meters into the mountain's interior from start to finish as part of the Hejaz railway line Construction of the tunnel began in the late 1800s during the reign of Sultan Abdul Hamid II, then stopped for lack of funds, and in 1908 work resumed, the construction lasted four years. To commemorate the completion of the project at the time, a large celebration was held in Damascus' Marjeh Square, and a monument was erected in the square to that effect.\n\n\n== Events ==\nOn March 29, 2005, Israeli helicopters landed soldiers on the mountain to sweep the area.\n\n\n== Palestine's largest tourism project ==\nAt the end of 2019, some businessmen announced their plans to establish the largest recreational and therapeutic tourism project in Palestine in the mountain area, which will include a medical resort, hotels, and medical and educational tourism treatment centers.\n\n\n== Photos gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Carabus japonicus is a ground beetle endemic to Japan. It inhabits the southwestern Japanese forests and is most frequently observed between May and September, with peak observations occurring mid-August. C. japonicus is a univoltine species, meaning it has one brood of offspring per year. Its larvae prey exclusively on earthworms. At lower altitudes, the reproductive cycle has been shown shown to coincide with the abundance of earthworms. This demonstrates the synchronization between the life cycles of the two species. The males tend to be slightly smaller than the females with both sexes having median body sizes of 24 mm and 26 mm, respectively. However, there is a large variation in intraspecific body size due to factors other than sex. These factors include parent size, food availability, and habitat temperature.\n\n\n== Habitat ==\nOhomopterus beetles occur between 31° N and 44°N in latitude, 0 to 2000 m in altitude, and 6°C to 17°C in annual mean temperature. C. japonicus in particular predominates in the forests on Kyushu, the third largest of Japan's four main islands. \n\n\n== Diet ==\nCarabus japonicus larvae are specialized earthworm predators. Their predation success is dependent on earthworm size. Larger earthworms present a greater predatory challenge. Therefore, the success of larvae decreases with an increase in earthworm size. It follows that geographical variation in earthworm size may affect the body size of C. japonicus. A study examined the life cycle and abundance of earthworms at six different sites of varying altitudes. Earthworms appeared from April to September in all six study sites. At lower altitudes, the abundance of earthworms fell off dramatically after July. However, this effect was absent in the elevated sites. The median body weight of earthworms increased from April to July. This phenomenon was particularly apparent in the low-altitude sites. Larger beetles may be favored in the summer at lower altitudes because of the larger prey size. Larger females lay larger eggs. Therefore, they confer a phenotypic advantage to their progeny in environments where earthworms are larger. The diet of adult C. japonicus is more versatile than in its larval stage. It feeds on animals other than earthworms, like snails, slugs, isopods, and even dead vertebrates.  \n\n\n== Behavior ==\n\n\n=== Mating ===\nAn experiment was conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of body length differences to prevent interspecific copulation. A male and female of differing species (C. japonicus and  C. dehaanii), were placed in a box together. Males of both species attempted to mate with the heterospecific female at a rate similar to that observed in intraspecific pairings. However, C. japonicus males are approximately 5 mm smaller than their C. dehaanii male counterparts. The difference in size between the heterospecific pairings resulted in the blocking of aedeagus insertion and unsuccessful spermatophore deposition. In this way, body size differences act as an effective reproductive barrier between C. japonicus and  C. dehaanii.  This effect can be generalized to other species interactions. Neither male to male competition (i.e. aggressive intraspecific conflict and territorial defense) nor courtship behavior is observed in C. japonicus. Instead, it has a mating system of promiscuity, in which there no there are no pair bonds. Females accept multiple matings with multiple males.  A male recognizes a female by chemical signaling, approaches, and mounts its back. Males deposit larger spermatophores when mated with larger females. This is because larger females have more mature eggs. Copulation duration increases with an increase in male reproductive organ weight. This could be due to the increased time to deposit a larger spermatophore. However, smaller males stay mounted for longer (a 300 minute maximum, compared to a 50 minute maximum of their larger counterparts). This serves purposes other than insemination like mate guarding and assurance of sperm transfer into the spermatheca). Here, we see two distinct mating tactics, one offensive, the other defensive. Larger males spend less time in a mating posture, which permits more frequent copulations. Alternatively, smaller males spend more time in a mating posture, which increases likelihood of paternity (i.e. no spermatophore competition or displacement).  Remating inhibition by seminal substances has been confirmed in C. japonicus through the induction of female refractory period. This function benefits males by decreasing spermatophore competition, but costs females through reducing mating opportunities, which could boost offspring fitness. Although females experience increased fecundity from increased mating, it also causes them physiological harm. Females can control the amount of ejaculation per mating through shifting mating posture.\n\n\n=== Predation ===\nCarabus japonicus attack earthworms by snapping at them with their sharp, arcuate mandibles. When confined with earthworms in a box, C. japonicus will attack regardless of earthworm size. However, success among all instars (one through five) decreased with the increase in relative body weight of the earthworms. Conversely, success increased in all instars with the decrease in relative body weight of the earthworms. Small C. japonicus were unsuccessful in their predation attempts when it was thrown off by the earthworm's secretion of mucus and thrashing. When successful, it continuously bit until the earthworm's thrashing ceased and it became motionless. The C. japonicus proceeded with external ingestion of the carcass. Ohomopterus larvae can attack earthworms up to 400 times greater in body weight than themselves. To provide sufficient nutrition, the earthworm attakcked needs to be 50 to 100 times heavier than the larva. C. japonicus sits and waits for prey. Upon detection of an earthworm, it probes the earthworm's body and snaps violently at its underside.\n\n\n== Physiology ==\n\n\n=== Body size ===\nThe body size of organisms is an important characteristic in all organisms because of its relation to both biological functions and fitness. In C. japonicus, this is no different. Body size differences preclude heterospecific mating, thus facilitating the coexistence of species. C. japonicus exhibit the converse cline of Bergmann's rule: they increase body size with increasing annual mean temperature. In northern Kyushu, mean body length in C. japonicus was shown to covary with temperature with an unstandardized beta of 0.594. This means that for each degree increase in temperature (in Celcius), the mean body length (in mm) increased 0.594 mm. Temperature is just one factor that has been shown to affect body size in C. japonicus. When in sympatry with the beetle C. dehaanii, C. japonicus is markedly smaller than when it is in allopatry. This body size variation in response to and in the absence of a similar species is indicative of character release, which in turn suggests the existence of evolutionary processes of phenotypic plasticity.  In other words, competition affects body size. The genetic basis for differences in body size was confirmed in a laboratory experiment, which took beetles from four sites with different mean body sizes. Offspring developed under the same conditions. Cross-breeding of the populations of varying body size showed that body length was highly heritable. The body length male and female offspring were correlated with the mid-parental length (the sum of the male body length and female body length, divided by two). The regression coefficient for the relationship between these two variables was 0.84 for males and 0.76 for females. Further experimentation revealed three additional factors related to body length: egg size, larval growth rate, and larval development time. There was a positive correlation for all three of these variables. Additionally, larger females were shown to lay larger eggs without an impact on fecundity.\n\n\n=== Genital morphology ===\nThe male inserts its aegeus into the female's vaginal opening. The endophallus is then everted from the aegeus into the vaginal appendix. The spermatophore emerges from the hook-like copulatory piece and is deposited in the vaginal apophysis. When the male body length is slightly smaller than that of the female, spermatophore deposition is more successful. This provides a potential explanation for the sexual dimorphic body size. The selection pressure of size-assortative mating promotes the slightly smaller male body size relative to females. The largest and smallest female body sizes result in improper positioning of the male genitalia, which leads to a failure to transfer gametes. However, males can adjust their posture to circumvent non optimal body size differences. Males with larger testes and accessory glands can eject larger spermatophores. Increased spermatophore size enhances paternity. This is particularly important given the promiscuous mating system of C. japonicus. A longer copulatory piece enables fixation of the endophallus in the proper position. Additionally, a longer copulatory piece enables the conservation of spermatophores. \n\n\n== Life cycle ==\nThe life cycle of C. japonicus can be resolved to five distinct stages known as instars. It begins reproductive activity in the spring. C. japonicus at lower altitudes begin reproduction earlier in spring, but show shorter periods of activity. Populations at higher altitudes used the entire warm season for reproduction. The abundance of earthworms also affects the timing of  C. japonicus hatching. Its seasonal life cycle is synchronized with the earthworm spring hatching to maximize food availability. In conditions of 20°C and 16 hours light to 8 hours dark, the developmental process from egg to adult took approximately 50 days on average. The adult beetles overwinter to reproduce next breeding season. Some beetles live for more than one year and reproduce in successive breeding seasons. Mortality is high during active periods, but low during periods of dormant diapause (assuming the beetles have sufficient energy stored).\n\n\n== References ==",

He played two years of college basketball for the Fort Lewis Skyhawks before playing eight seasons in the Australian National Basketball League (NBL) between 1981 and 1995. He won three NBL championships with the Canberra Cannons in 1983, 1984 and 1988. He became a naturalised Australian during his playing career.\n\n\n== College career ==\nNelson played two years of college basketball for the Fort Lewis Skyhawks between 1977 and 1979. He was named second-team All-RMAC as a junior in 1977–78 and first-team All-RMAC as a senior in 1978–79. He averaged 16.8 points as a junior and 19.0 points as a senior. As of 2022, his 1,058 career points ranked 28th all time in school history while his 455 career rebounds ranked 24th all time.\n\n\n== Professional career ==\nIn 1979, Nelson moved to Australia to play in the Australian-American Amateur Basketball League. He was named the most valuable player in the league.\nIn 1981, Nelson debuted in the Australian National Basketball League (NBL) for the Canberra Cannons. He was named in the All-NBL Team in his first season after averaging a career-high 24.3 points per game. He played in the 1982 NBL All-Star Game and helped the Cannons win back-to-back NBL championships in 1983 and 1984. He was team captain in 1983 and reached 100 NBL games and 2,000 points in 1984.\nAfter five seasons for the Cannons, Nelson joined the Brisbane Bullets for the 1986 NBL season. As a naturalised Australian, he helped the Bullets reach the grand final series, where they lost to the Adelaide 36ers. He sat out the 1987 season and then re-joined the Cannons for the 1988 NBL season. After winning a third championship in 1988, he retired from the NBL.\nIn 1990 and 1991, Nelson was a member of the Toowoomba Mountaineers who won back-to-back Queensland Basketball League (QBL) championships.\nNelson returned to the Cannons for a seven-game stint in the 1995 NBL season. In 173 career games in the NBL, he averaged 17.4 points, 4.5 rebounds and 1.2 assists per game.\n\n\n== Player profile ==\nNelson was considered a dynamic power forward with a \"line dry jumpshot\". He was renowned for his hard-working game and his outside shots. At six foot eight, he was also listed as a center in the NBL.\n\n\n== Coaching career ==\nNelson served as head coach of the Canberra Capitals of the Women's National Basketball League (WNBL) during the 1988 season. The team missed the playoffs with a fifth-place finish and a 13–9 record.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1984, Nelson became eligible for Australian naturalisation.\nNelson's retirement from the NBL coincided with him starting a barbecue spare rib business in Canberra. He has been the owner and chef of two Mexican restaurants in Canberra, where he had a cult following for his ribs and wings.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nandthefoul.net profile\nNBL stats",

        "content": "David James Vaughan (2 August 1825 – 30 July 1905) was an English cleric and social reformer.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nVaughan was an honorary canon of Peterborough, and social reformer. He was born at St. Martin's vicarage, Leicester, on 2 August 1825, was sixth and youngest son of Edward Thomas Vaughan, fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, and vicar of St. Martin's, Leicester, by his second wife Agnes, daughter of John Pares of The Newarke, Leicester. Charles John Vaughan, master of the Temple, and General Sir John Luther Vaughan, G.C.B., were elder brothers. James Vaughan, a physician of Leicester and one of the founders of the Leicester Infirmary, was his grandfather, and his uncles included Sir Henry (who took the name of Halford), physician; Sir John Vaughan, baron of the exchequer and father of Henry Halford Vaughan; and Sir Charles Richard Vaughan, diplomatist.\nDavid James was educated first at the Leicester Collegiate School, under William Hepworth Thompson, afterwards Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, and in August 1840 he went to Rugby, first under Arnold and then under Tait. In 1844 he won a scholarship at Trinity College, Cambridge, and next year the Bell university scholarship, along with John Llewelyn Davies. In 1847 he was Browne medallist for Latin ode and epigrams; and in 1847 and 1848 he obtained the members' prize for a Latin essay. In 1848 he was bracketed fifth classic with his friend Llewelyn Davies, and he was twenty-fourth senior optime. He graduated B.A. in 1848, proceeded M.A. in 1851, and was a fellow of Trinity College from 1850 to 1858.\nVaughan, Davies, and Brooke Foss Westcott, all fellows of Trinity, formed at Cambridge a lifelong friendship. The three were amongst the earliest members of the Cambridge Philological Society. In 1852 Vaughan and Llewelyn Davies brought out together a translation of Plato's 'Republic,' with introduction, analysis, and notes. Davies undertook the first five books, and Vaughan the last five, each author submitting to the other his work for correction or amendment. The analysis was the work of Vaughan, whilst Davies was responsible for the introduction. In 1858 a second edition was issued, and in 1860 a new edition, without the introduction, in the 'Golden Treasury' series. This was stereotyped, and has since been frequently reprinted. An edition de luxe in two quarto volumes appeared in 1898. The translators sold their copyright for 60l. (information from J. L. Davies). The translation is exact and scholarly. Despite the superiority of Jowett's translation in respect alike of English style and of the presentation of Plato's general conceptions, Davies and Vaughan's rendering excels Jowett's in philological insight, and indicates with far greater fidelity the construction of difficult passages.\nIn 1853 Vaughan was ordained deacon, and began his pastoral work in Leicester, living on his fellowship, and serving as honorary curate, first to his eldest brother at St. Martin's, and then at St. John's church. In 1854 he was ordained priest, and in 1856 he succeeded his friend Llewelyn Davies as incumbent of St. Mark's, Whitechapel. In 1860 he was appointed vicar of St. Martin's, Leicester, and master of Wyggeston's Hospital. The living was then in the gift of the crown, and had been held by his father and two of his brothers continuously since 1802, save for a short interval of twelve years. In the case of each of the three sons the appointment was made at the urgent request of the parishioners. Vaughan refused all subsequent offers of preferment, including a residentiary canonry at Peterborough and the lucrative living of Battersea, which Earl Spencer offered him in 1872. He accepted an honorary canonry of Peterborough in 1872, and he was rural dean of Leicester from 1875 to 1884 and from 1888 to 1891. In June 1894 he was made hon. D.D. of Durham University.\nIn early life Vaughan was influenced by the liberal theology of John Macleod Campbell, and while in London he, like his friend Llewelyn Davies, came under the influence of Frederick Denison Maurice. Maurice's example as social and educational reformer largely moulded his career. His teaching on the atonement and inspiration was at the outset called in question, but Vaughan soon concentrated his interests in social questions, to which he brought a broad public spirit and sympathy. His efforts to elevate the working classes by means of education were no less earnest and successful than those of Maurice and his colleagues in London. In 1862 he started in Leicester, on the lines of the Working Men's College founded by Maurice in London in 1854, a working men's reading-room and institute in one of the parish schools. He arranged for classes and lectures, and the numbers attending them grew steadily, the teachers being all volunteers. In 1868 there were four hundred adults under instruction, and the name of the institute was changed to 'college' as being in Vaughan's words 'not only a school of sound learning, but also a home for Christian intercourse and brotherly love.' At one time the Leicester Working Men's College was educating 2300 students. In addition to Sunday morning and evening classes, night classes, and advanced classes, there were established a provident society, sick benefit society, and book club. Some of the students became leading manufacturers in Leicester, and several have filled the office of mayor.\nOn Sunday afternoons, Vaughan gave in St. Martin's church addresses on social and industrial as well as religious themes to working men, including members of the great friendly societies in Leicester, and students of the college. The first was delivered on 13 February 1870, on 'The Christian Aspect and Use of Politics.' Some of his Sunday afternoon addresses were published in 1894 as 'Questions of the Day.'\nVaughan was chairman of the first Leicester school board in 1871, and exercised a moderating influence over stormy deliberations. During an epidemic of small-pox in 1871, he constantly visited the patients in the improvised hospital, and from that time to near the end of his life he regularly ministered to the staff and patients of the borough isolation hospital. In 1893 failing health compelled him to resign his parish, and he retired to the Wyggeston Hospital on the outskirts of the town. He continued to act as chairman of the Institution of District Nurses, president of the Working Men's College, and honorary chaplain to the isolation hospital. He died at the master's house at Wyggeston's Hospital on 30 July 1905, and was buried at the Welford Road cemetery, Leicester. He married, on 11 January 1859, Margaret, daughter of John Greg of Escowbeck, Lancaster; she died on 21 February 1911 and was buried beside her husband.\nTo commemorate Vaughan's work at St. Martin's, as well as that of his father and two brothers, all former vicars, a new south porch was erected at St. Martin's church in 1896–7 at the cost of 3000l. After his death, a new Vaughan Working Men's College, situate in Great Central Street and Holy Bones, Leicester, was erected as a memorial to him at the cost of 8000l. The building was formally opened by Sir Oliver Lodge on 12 Oct. 1908.\nBesides the works already mentioned, Vaughan published: \n\n'Sermons preached in St. John's Church, Leicester,' 1856.\n'Three Sermons on the Atonement,' 1859.\n'Christian Evidences and the Bible,' 1864; 2nd edit. 1865.\n'Thoughts on the Irish Church Question,' 1868.\n'Sermons on the Resurrection,' 1869.\n'The Present Trial of Faith,' 1878.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Fletcher, William George Dimock (1912). \"Vaughan, David James\".

It is based on a 2015 novel by Mizuki Tsujimura. In June 2020, the Toronto International Film Festival announced that the film would be part of their 2020 festival. It was selected as the Japanese entry for the Best International Feature Film at the 93rd Academy Awards, but was not nominated.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nSatoko (Hiromi Nagasaku) and Kiyokazu (Arata Iura) have a kindergarten-age son, Asato (Reo Sato), whom they adopted as a newborn. One day they receive a call from one of his teachers telling them that a boy at his school has fallen off the jungle gym and claims Asato pushed him which Asato denies. The boy's mother requests reimbursement for their medical expenses. Satoko worries that her son may have inherited bad genes from his birth parents. \nIn a flashback to a few years earlier, Satoko and Kiyokazu decide to start a family and learn that Kiyokazu has aspermia. After a long, painful, and ultimately unsuccessful period of treatments, they decided to gave up and settle for a childless life until seeing a program on TV about Baby Baton, a nonprofit association that matches infertile couples with mothers who cannot or don't want to raise their biological children. Seeing this, Satoko and Kiyokazu realize that adoption could be a perfect alternative for them to build a normal family. \nWhen Satoko and Kiyokazu come to pick up the newborn Asato, they are asked if they want to meet his biological mother. They say yes, and are introduced to Hikari, a well-mannered young girl who cares deeply for her baby. Hikari gives them a letter to the baby, and says she is very sorry. \nAnother flashback introduces Asato's biological mother, Hikari (Aju Makita), a fourteen-year-old junior high school student. Hikari falls in love with a male classmate, leading to a pure, mutual, and intense romance. They have sexual intercourse, and Hikari later finds out that she is pregnant; since she had not yet begun to menstruate, the discovery comes too late for her to have an abortion. Afraid of gossip and damaging Hikari's bright future prospects, her family decides to send her away to Baby Baton, which provides accommodations for expectant mothers and finds adoptive parents for their unwanted children. Hikari and the other expectant mothers, mostly young trafficked girls, find peace with each other while waiting to give birth.\nIn the present day, Satoko receives another phone call from the kindergarten teacher, revealing that the other boy lied about Asato pushing him and confessed that he jumped off the jungle gym himself. Satoko feels relieved, and the family plans a joyful visit to the zoo, but they are interrupted by a phone call from a woman claiming she is Asato's mother, and she wants her son back. Satoko and Kiyokazu reluctantly agree to meet Hikari who threatens to reveal their son is adopted unless they give her money. The couple reveal that their son's adoption is not a secret and based on what she has said and their one meeting of Hikari they do not believe that the woman they are talking to actually is Hikari. \nAfter returning from Baby Baton's facilities, Hikari came to feel like an outsider from her old life, and soon leaves home and returns to Baby Baton's facility, asking for a job and a place to stay. She learns that Baby Baton will be closing down after its final current resident delivers her baby. While working there, Hikari accidentally comes upon Baby Baton's records of adoptive parents, and finds the file about the adoptive parents of her son.\nShe moves closer to the city to be nearer her son and takes a job delivering newspapers. While working there she befriends a young girl her own age who reminds her of one of the pregnant women she met at Baby Baton. The two soon form a close friendship; however, her friend is in trouble with loan sharks and fakes Hikari's signature as a co-signer so she won't have to repay the loan. Hikari eventually comes up with the money and, broken hearted, finally reaches out to her son's parents. After hearing her son calling for his mother she apologizes and says she is not his mother and runs away.\nLater on Sakoto is visited by the police who show her Hikari's name and confirm her identity.

He was the head football coach for Carleton College from 1979 to 2000.\n\n\n== Career ==\nSullivan played college football for Saint John's for his freshman and sophomore year.\nAs a junior at Saint John's in 1957, Sullivan was told by coach John Gagliardi that he would be better off as a coach rather than a player, so he helped coach the freshman football team. As a senior in 1958, he was the head freshman coach. In 1959, he began his high school coaching career as the head football coach for Hill High School. He led the school to two state championships and were runner-ups four times. After eleven seasons, in 1970 he became the head football coach for Cooper High School. He ended his tenure with Cooper winning twenty of his last 23 games. In 1979, he was hired as the head football coach for Carleton. In 22 seasons as head coach he led the school to a 101–114 record. In 1979 he led the team to a Midwest Conference (MWC) Blue Division title. In 1992, he had his best season as he finished the year going 9–2 and won the Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (MIAC) alongside a trip to the NCAA Division III playoffs. He resigned following the 2000 season. From 2001 to 2018 he served as a volunteer assistant coach under his son for Northfield High School.\n\n\n== Honors ==\nIn 2002, Sullivan was inducted into the Carleton 'C' Club.\nIn 2022, Carleton's football field was renamed in Sullivan's honor to Bob Sullivan Field.\n\n\n== Head coaching record ==\n\n\n=== College ===\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCarleton profile",

        "content": "Zenito Francisco Cardozo (born 1 December 1988) is an Indian gangster, history-sheeter, and the gang leader of the Bang Bang gang based in St. Cruz. He first gained notoriety in 2008 during the attack on social activist Aires Rodrigues and historian Prajal Sakhardande. Since then, he has been a key figure in over a dozen criminal incidents in North Goa.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nZenito Francisco Cardozo was born on 1 December 1988 in Ribandar, Goa, to Vicente Cardozo and Maria De Lourdes Alexandrina Graca Gomes e Cardozo  (née Gomes) (1957–2013). Before his criminal involvement, Cardozo was characterized as a reclusive resident of St. Cruz, Goa who lived in a small ancestral home. He had no employment history and was not associated with the alleged leadership of the protectors group, which was led by Rodolfo Fernandes.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 2008 attack case ===\nOn 13 October 2008, an incident thrust Cardozo into the public eye when Aires Rodrigues, an advocate and activist, was assaulted by a group of seven individuals at a bar in Panaji. Rodrigues, accompanied by historian Prajal Sakhardande and other friends, was dining when the attack occurred. As a result of the assault, Rodrigues sustained an injury to one of his fingers and required immediate medical attention, leading to surgical intervention at a local hospital.\nIn January 2009, the Panaji police, citing a lack of evidence, filed a chargesheet in a local court under the provisions of the Arms Act, 1959, charging seven individuals, including Cardozo, Sandeep Vaigankar, Shabbir Gujarati, Asif Badiger, Aslam Badiger, Yakut Walikar, and Dinesh Patil, with attempted murder in relation to the alleged attack on Rodrigues.\nOn 30 November 2015, the North Goa District Court acquitted all six accused individuals involved in the Rodrigues attack case, while Dinesh Patil remained a fugitive. The acquittals were granted on the basis of the benefit of doubt, as both the victims and witnesses testified that all the accused individuals were wearing monkey caps, impeding their identification. Pratima Vernekar, serving as the public prosecutor, represented the State during the proceedings. The investigation of the case was conducted by police inspector Francis Corte, who held the position of inspector of the Panjim Police Station at that time. Rodrigues expressed his belief that the investigation had been conducted in a manner that rendered conviction implausible.\n\n\n=== 2009 Siridao gang clash ===\nOn 10 May 2009, an incident unfolded involving Cardozo, which garnered attention. Cardozo single-handedly engaged in a physical confrontation with the Miranda group, who were based in Merces, Goa, at Siridao beach. The altercation ensued due to the alleged mistreatment of Cardozo's sister by the Miranda gang earlier that same day. The confrontation escalated into a violent encounter involving hand-to-hand combat and the use of knives, resulting in two fatalities and three individuals sustaining serious injuries. However, Cardozo was acquitted of all charges after undergoing a trial. During the clash, Cardozo himself sustained injuries and received medical treatment at the Goa Medical College in Bambolim. Cynthia, Cardozo's sister, made allegations implicating Rodolfo Fernandes, the son of St. Cruz MLA Victoria Fernandes, in the incident. Cynthia further asserted that Cardozo was unjustly implicated and did not possess any weapon during the altercation. She also claimed that the police deliberately impeded the investigation by threatening multiple eyewitnesses through telephone communication. The veracity of these claims can potentially be substantiated by examining the phone records with mobile operators, Cynthia stated.\nCynthia asserted that Cardozo was compelled to defend himself against a group of notorious individuals, namely Francis D'Souza, alias Miranda, aged 36, Prakash Naik, alias Pokka, and their associates, in order to avoid being lynched to death. In light of these allegations, Cynthia demanded that the investigation into the incident be entrusted to either the Crime Branch or the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). She communicated her plea by writing letters to the Chief Minister of Goa, Director General of Police (DGP), and Chief secretary. The reporter in Old Goa stated that Rodolfo denied the accusations against him, alleging that they were orchestrated by people with specific motives aiming to damage his character. Likewise, Prakash Naik, a Merces panchayat member, refuted the accusations made by Cynthia, asserting that he and Rodolfo were not behind the purported violent assault on Cardozo. Cynthia had publicly stated in a press conference that Naik, along with Rodolfo, orchestrated the attack on Cardozo. Naik rejected these accusations as a mere strategic political tactic aimed at tarnishing their reputation in the public eye.\nAddressing reporters at his residence in Merces, Goa, Naik revealed that he had not received any official communication from the police about his supposed role in the event. Nevertheless, he expressed his willingness to cooperate fully with the authorities. Naik clarified that his only involvement in the matter was transporting Miranda to the Goa Medical College in Bambolim after the altercation between Miranda and Cardozo had taken place. Naik further asserted that he had no knowledge of any existing animosity between Cardozo and Miranda, if indeed there was any. Naik emphasized that he was unaware of any conflict between Cardozo and Miranda, if it existed. He denied making the alleged phone call to Rodolfo Fernandes, as claimed by Cynthia during her press conference. He explained that his visits to Rodolfo's residence were solely related to overseeing developmental projects in his ward, leaving no opportunity for discussions relating to the incident.\nOn 29 July 2016, the additional sessions court in Mapusa rendered a verdict in the case involving the violent incident that transpired at Siridao beach in 2009, resulting in the deaths of two individuals. In response to this incident, Cardozo, a key figure in the event, was sentenced to a term of three years imprisonment by the court. According to the prosecution's presentation, Cardozo, accompanied by his associates Mahavir Nadar and Domnic Nazareth, engaged in a heated altercation with two individuals, Santosh Kalel, aged 37, from Zuarinagar and Johnny Fernandes from St. Cruz, Goa, at a local shack located on Siridao beach. The confrontation escalated, leading to a violent clash between the two opposing factions involving the use of glass bottles and knives. Kalel, who was associated with the Miranda gang, was dead at the scene, while Fernandes succumbed to his injuries during treatment at the Goa Medical College and Hospital in Bambolim.\nAfter the event took place, the Agacaim police initiated legal proceedings by filing a murder case against Cardozo and his associates for the death of Kalel. Additionally, they filed an attempted murder case against individuals such as Miranda, Fernandes, and others who were linked to the attack on Cardozo and his group. In the detailed ruling, the court cleared Cardozo of murder charges but convicted him of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. It concluded that the event was not planned but a spontaneous outcome of a sudden altercation. Nadar and Nazareth were also found not guilty of any accusations. Judge Vijaya Pol of the additional sessions court issued the verdict, sentencing Cardozo to three years of rigorous imprisonment under Section 304 (II) of the law. Cardozo was further given a three-year term of rigorous imprisonment under Section 326. Furthermore, the court imposed a fine of ₹10,000 (equivalent to ₹14,000 or US$180 in 2023) on Cardozo, taking into consideration his role in the deaths of Kalel and Fernandes.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nCardozo is a resident of St. Cruz, Goa, and is the owner of a bungalow in that area. He has two sisters named Cynthia and Maria. On 12 June 2013, Cardozo's mother, who resided in Kuwait, died. The funeral service took place two days later at Holy Cross Church in St. Cruz. As of July 2020, Cardozo resided with his aunt; however, she was subsequently admitted to Manipal Hospital in Dona Paula for medical treatment. Additionally, Cardozo has established connections with prominent politicians, including Tourism Minister Rohan Khaunte.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGoa mafia\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Benjamin Thompson (1776? – 26 May 1816) was an English dramatist.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nThompson was born about 1776, was the son of Benjamin Blaydes Thompson, a merchant of Kingston-upon-Hull. He was educated for the law, but, disliking the profession, he was sent to Hamburg as his father's agent. He occupied his leisure by translating several of August von Kotzebue's dramas. On 24 March 1798 one of these, ‘The Stranger,’ was brought out at Drury Lane, John Philip Kemble taking the title rôle. It met with much success both there and in 1801 at Covent Garden (Genest, Hist. of the Stage, vii. 336, 513, 591, viii. 478, ix. 457). It was published in 1801 (London, 8vo), and has since been frequently reprinted. On 12 October 1812 an original operatic drama by Thompson, entitled ‘Godolphin,’ was unsuccessfully produced at Drury Lane. A second piece, called ‘Oberon's Oath,’ at the same theatre on 21 May 1816, was not well received at first. The disappointment is said to have killed him. He died in Blackfriars Road, London, on 26 May 1816. In 1799 he married Jane, youngest daughter of John Bourne, rector of Sutton-cum-Duckmanton and of South Wingfield in Derbyshire. By her he had six children.\nBesides the works mentioned, Thompson was the author of: \n\n‘The Florentines: a Tale,’ London, 1808, 8vo.\n‘An Account of the Introduction of Merino Sheep into the different States of Europe and at the Cape of Good Hope,’ London, 1810, 8vo. He also translated numerous German plays, which were published in a collective form under the title ‘The German Theatre’ in 1801, London, 8vo.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Carlyle, Edward Irving (1898). \"Thompson, Benjamin (1776?-1816)\".

He trained as an architect and was appointed to the Commission royale des Monuments (established 1835). He worked on the restoration of medieval churches in Aarschot, Sint-Truiden, Saint-Hubert, and Nivelles, and of St Martin's Cathedral, Ypres. He designed the church of St Boniface, Ixelles, modern prison cells in Brussels, Liège, Marche, Dinant, and Leuven, and a reformatory at Ruiselede (East Flanders). He designed somewhere in the region of 30 Neogothic churches. He died in Saint-Josse-ten-Noode, Brussels, on 29 March 1859.\n\n\n== References ==",

It is to be used in conjunction with a standard antidepressant medication, and with professional guidance and support.\nRejoyn was developed by Otsuka America Pharmaceutical Inc., and gained FDA approval as a \"medical device\" on March 30th, 2024. The smartphone app helps patients with depression using exercises based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), along with timed notifications to keep the patient engaged and in treatment. Randomized controlled trials showed that the Rejoyn app was more effective at relieving depression symptoms compared to a \"sham app\", a placebo app that required similar effort but was not intended to be helpful. Dr. John Torous, MD, MBI, a psychiatrist at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, said that the app seems to pose minimal risks, and is an important step forward in unlocking the power of smartphones in treating psychiatric disorders.\n\n\n== Notes ==\na1  MBI for Masters of Biomedical Informatics.\n\n\n== References ==",

The imperfection of the specimen makes the number of whorls undeterminable. The whorls are gently convex and constitute the greater bulk of the specimen. The aperture is elongate elliptical and fully three times as long as wide. It is rounded below and acute above. The columella apparently contains two folds, both of which are rather obscure and seen only as slight impressions on the surface of the columellar cavity and are situated quite high. The surface is marked by rather fine, spiral lines, coarser on the lower part than above and the surface of the cast is marked by a rather broad depressed spiral band or groove, a little below the suture. Indications of transverse lines of growth are extremely faint. \n\n\n== Distribution ==\nFossils of this marine species have been found in Cretaceous strata in New Jersey, USA.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGabb, W.

        "content": "Gabriele Kafka (September 22, 1889 – fall of 1942) was the eldest sister of the writer Franz Kafka. She was known as Elli or Ellie; her married name is variously rendered as Hermann or Hermannová.\n\n\n== Life ==\nGabriele was born on September 22, 1889, in Prague into the family of Hermann Kafka (1852–1931) and Julie, née Löwa or Löwy (1855–1934). She was the eldest of Franz's siblings and had two sisters, Valli and Ottla. She attended a German girls' school in Prague's Řeznická Street and later a private girls' secondary school.\nOn November 27, 1910, she married Karl Hermann (1883–1939), a salesman. The couple had a son, Felix (1911–1940), and two daughters, Gertrude (Gerti) Kaufmann (1912–1972), and Hanna Seidner (1920–1941). After her marriage to Hermann, she became closer to her brother, whose letters showed an active interest in the upbringing of her children, including strongly advising her to have them educated at a reform school in Hellerau. He accompanied her on a 1915 trip to Hungary to visit Hermann, who was stationed there, and spent a summer with her and her children in Müritz the year before he died.  \nIn a letter to Max Brod from August 1947, daughter Gerti Kaufmann wrote that Franz Kafka was regarded by his sisters as a kind of higher being.\nWith the outbreak of the Great Depression in 1929, the Hermann family business experienced financial difficulties and eventually went bankrupt. Karl Hermann died February 27, 1939, and Elli was supported financially by her sisters.\nOn October 21, 1941, she was deported together with her daughter Hanna to the Łódź Ghetto, where she lived temporarily with her sister Valli and Valli's husband in the spring of 1942. She was probably killed in the Kulmhof extermination camp in the fall of 1942. Other relatives of hers, including her sisters Valli and Ottla, were also victims of the Holocaust. Of Elli's three children, only her daughter Gerti survived the Second World War. A memorial plaque commemorates the three sisters at the family grave in the New Jewish Cemetery in Prague.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nGazda, Grzgorz. \"The Final Journey of Franz Kafka's Sisters\" (PDF).\nStach, Reiner (2016-10-25).

        "content": "William Torr (22 December 1808 – 12 December 1874) was an English agriculturist.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nTorr came from a family of yeomen which had been settled for several generations at Riby in North Lincolnshire. There he was born on 22 December 1808. His education was interfered with by a severe strain affecting the spine while pole-jumping. After leaving school he travelled through various parts of Great Britain and the continent, laying the foundation of that thorough knowledge of farming and stock-breeding which distinguished him through life. Torr began farming in his native parish of Riby in his twenty-fifth year (1833); in 1848 he moved to the Aylesby Manor Farm, which during the preceding eighty years had been celebrated for its breed of Leicester sheep. Its reputation was successfully maintained and increased under Torr's management. From the Aylesby flocks and herds animals were largely purchased for transmission to all parts of the United Kingdom, to the continent, the colonies, and even Japan. In 1854 he also took a farm of 420 acres at Rothwell. In 1856 he succeeded his uncle in the occupation of the Riby Grove Farm. The total area of these three farms was over 2,400 acres, the management of the whole of which he himself personally conducted. An exhaustive account of Torr's farming, written by H. M. Jenkins, secretary of the society, was published in the ‘Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society,’ 1869 (2nd ser. v. 415). It dealt with his farm management in all its bearings, fences, drainage, arable land, cattle, sheep, pigs, cart horses, manures, labour, steam cultivation, mechanical work, and farm accounts.\nThe principal feature of Torr's farm consisted in his magnificent breeds of live stock. He was especially proud of his flock of Leicester sheep. He had also a stud of thoroughbred ponies, largely partaking of Arab blood, which had been bred at Riby since 1804. But what gives Torr's name its importance in the history of agriculture is, above all, his famous breed of shorthorn cattle. \"It takes any man thirty years to make a herd and bring it to one's notions of perfection\", is said to have been one of his maxims, and almost exactly that space of time elapsed between 1844 and 1845, when Torr began to lay the foundations of his herd by hiring bulls from Richard Booth of Worlaby, another famous shorthorn breeder of the time, and September 1875, when eighty-four animals, all bred (for several generations) on his farm, were sold, in the presence of a company of something like three thousand persons, for the remarkable price of 42,919l. 16s. This sale resulted in the scattering of Torr's herd over the whole of the United Kingdom.\nHis reputation as an agriculturist was throughout life widespread. He acted as judge of live stock in the principal agricultural shows of the three kingdoms, and even in those held at Paris under the patronage of Napoleon III.\nHe became a member of the Royal Agricultural Society in 1839, the year after its foundation, and continued through life to be closely connected with it. In May 1857 he was elected on the council. He was a frequent member of the inspection committee appointed to visit the sites offered for the annual country meetings, and was one of the judges of farms in the first competition carried out under the auspices of the society in connection with the Oxford meeting of 1870. Besides his labours in connection with the Royal Agricultural Society, Torr was an active member and trustee of the Smithfield Club, as well as honorary director of the Lincolnshire Agricultural Society. His experience as a producer of beef and mutton caused him to be summoned before several of the select committees of the House of Commons on the subjects of the various means of transport of live cattle and dead meat which have been appointed since the cattle plague of 1865. He was the inventor of many improvements in the details of farm management, of one of the first convex mould-board ploughs, of a farm gate (to which was awarded a prize at the Warwick meeting of the Royal Agricultural Society in 1859), of a spring wagon, and of a pig-trough.\nTorr entertained ‘strong objections to everything in the shape of paper farming.’ This expression he himself used in introducing a lecture on ‘Sheep versus Cattle,’ delivered at a meeting of the weekly council of the Royal Agricultural Society on 20 June 1866. A full report of this address, given in the ‘Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society,’ 2nd ser. ii. 549, is almost the only one of his utterances which has been preserved. He was, however, a brilliant talker. ‘As he rode he lectured; one question was sufficient to bring out an essay.’ He died at Aylesby Manor on 12 December 1874, and was buried in Riby churchyard.\nAfter the Gainsborough show of the North Lincolnshire Society in 1864 a life-size painting by Knight was presented to him by his Lincolnshire friends in recognition of his eminent services in the advancement of agriculture. This picture was later in the possession of his nephew, the successor to the property.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Clarke, Ernest (1899). \"Torr, William\".

        "content": "Mal is a village near the city of Tongeren in the province of Limburg (Belgium), which became a subdivision of the city at the 1977 fusion of the Belgian municipalities. It has a surface area of 399 hectares. It is historically an agricultural village, with cereal and sugar beet production, and alluvial meadows in the valley of the river Jeker. The population in 1988 was 836.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe oldest signs of human occupation are graves from the Roman period, with the old Roman road from Bavay to Cologne running through the area. The oldest recorded mention of the village, as Malla, dates from 1111. The medieval lordship of Mal was subject to the Prince-bishopric of Liège, with the Van Elderen family being considerable local landowners. \nThe church of Mal dates back to the 9th century, originally as a chapel of ease and by the 13th century a full parish that also came to include the nearby village of Sluizen. A history of the dual parish was written in the 18th century by the parish priest, Gerard Joseph Van der Meer, as Acta pastorum de Mall et Sluysen, and partially published posthumously. Parish priests can be identified as far back as 1314. The tithes were paid to Tongeren minster, and the right of presentment was claimed both by the chapter of that church and by the Old University of Leuven. The medieval church, built in Romanesque style, was demolished in 1845 and replaced with a Neogothic structure in brick, designed by Joseph Dumont.\n\n\n== References ==",

In her early years she was mainly inspired by hip hop artists like DMX, Lauryn Hill and Missy Elliott, but also Arabic music had an influence on her musical evolution. When she hit the age of twelve, she took her first steps in the music industry as a contestant on the Flemish version of The Voice Kids 2015, where she barely missed out on a spot in the final. In 2019 she won the Urbanice Battle of Talents, a contest organized by Belgian radio station MNM in a search for Flemish hip hop talent.  At the same time, a collaboration with fellow Belgian artist and producer Chuki Beats quickly amassed views on Youtube and drove her in the spotlights. In 2022 she is nominated by Complex NL as Complex 'Next Best Female' artist. \nThe proliferation of her internet presence through Tiktoks in 2023 and her move to Los Angeles meant that she had the opportunity to establish connections with stars like Ye, Playboi Carti and Lil Tjay. As a result, she could join Lil Tjay sold-out tour through Europe. At the end of 2023, she created her first album 'Superstar!'.",

        "content": "Adelia E. Carman (née, Spalsbury; 1847 – 1923) was an American educator. Serving as Superintendent of Medal Contest Work for the National Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), for 30 years, she directed the WCTU's state superintendents of Public Instruction in supporting instruction and contests in oratory or declamation in the areas of temperance, prohibition, narcotics, women's suffrage, purity, Christian citizenship, and many other topics. She also served as the World's WCTU superintendent of the department of Medal Contests.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nAdelia Eliza Spalsbury was born in Jefferson County, New York, or Russell, St. Lawrence County, New York, March 21, 1847. James Spalsbury (1810–1872) and his wife, Martha (née Whitman) (1813–1899). Adelia's siblings were: Sarah, Martha, Delevan, Daniel, Martin, James, William, and Alice.\nShe was educated in the schools of her own county.\n\n\n== Career ==\nShe began teaching at an early age. After teaching eight years, the family moved to Wisconsin. Here she married Francis J. Carman (1845–1918) on October 3, 1847, and went with her husband to Missouri. She has two children, Clarence and Martha Maude.\nCarman's first work with the WCTU was in Missouri in the Demorest Medal Contests work. So enthusiastic was she in this novel way of educating the children and young people, and so effectually converting their elders to improving the home environment, that she wished the same plans might be broadened and thus made more effective.\n\nThe Demorest recitation only touched on temperance and prohibition, and Carman, knowing well the many-sided work of the WCTU, felt that this same education should be given on the use of narcotics, franchise for women, purity, Christian citizenship, and many other topics. This contest work was adopted in 1896 at St. Louis by the National WCTU at Carman's suggestion, and she was placed at the head of the National department. She was also made State Superintendent for Illinois. She had the hearty co-operation of William and Ellen Demorest. As soon as possible, the Demorest Contest Work was combined with the WCTU contests and all put under Carman's direction.\nThe work developed well, and far outstripped the vision seen by Carman, its founder. Medals were sent to nearly all foreign countries, and the number of kinds of medals in demand seemed unending. She had, beside the regular series of silver, gold, grand gold and diamond medals, an anti-narcotic medal, musical, matrons silver-gray, suffrage and L.T.L.. Those finishing the regular series, finally receiving the diamond medal, were diplomas from the WCTU school of oratory.\nIn managing all the details of this complicated work, with its designing of medals, editing and publishing the several contest books, planning the rules and suggestions and carrying on the large correspondence necessary, the National Superintendent proved herself to be an excellent businesswoman.\n\n\n== Death ==\nCarman made her home in Chicago, where she died March 21, 1923.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "John Charles Tarver (27 March 1790 – 15 April 1851) was an English educational writer.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nTarver was the son of John Tarver of London, by his wife Sarah (Fox). He was born at Dieppe on 27 March 1790. Upon the outbreak of war with England in 1793, the Tarvers were thrown into prison, together with the other English residents. John was at that time staying in the house of M. Féral, a friend of his mother, and chief engineer of the ‘Ponts et Chaussées’ for Seine-Inférieure; and when the means of escape were offered to his parents, he was left in France until an opportunity should offer to send him to England. This never occurred. M. Féral, however, brought the child up as his own son, educated him, partly himself and partly at the government school at Pont Audemer, and in 1805 took him into his own employment in the service of the Ponts et Chaussées. Three years later he obtained him an appointment in the administration de la marine, in which service he remained, first as secretary to the admiral of the fleet at Toulon, and afterwards at Leghorn, Spezzia, Genoa, and Brest, until at the cessation of war in 1814 he was enabled to renew his intercourse with his family. In March of this year he obtained leave of absence and hastened to England, where he found his mother and a brother and sister living. He returned to Paris during the ‘hundred days,’ immediately after the flight of Louis XVIII, but, his prospects there appearing unsettled, he decided to rejoin his friends in England. He soon obtained a post as French master at Macclesfield free school. While there he was struck by the lack of guidance afforded by existing dictionaries as to the right word to choose when a number of equivalents were given. As a first attempt to remedy this defect he prepared his ‘Dictionnaire des Verbes Français’ (Macclesfield, 1818, 8vo); but this was avowedly incomplete, and he was ultimately led to produce, at the cost of immense labour, his valuable and original ‘Royal Phraseological English-French and French-English Dictionary’ (London, 1845, 2 vols. 4to; 2nd edit. 1849; 3rd edit. 1854). It was dedicated by permission to Prince Albert, and it became a standard work. The difficulties involved can be discerned by turning to a word like ‘get,’ for which, in five closely printed columns, some hundreds of equivalents are carefully differentiated.\nIn 1819 Tarver married his cousin, Mary Cristall. He was afterwards appointed French tutor to Prince George, duke of Cambridge, and went to live at Windsor. In 1826 he was appointed French master at Eton, and held that post for the remainder of his life. He issued for the use of his scholars ‘Familiar Conversational French Exercises,’ ‘Introduction à la Langue usuelle’ (1836), and other primers, from which was gradually evolved ‘The Eton French Grammar.’ He also revised several historical abridgments, French grammars, manuals, and dictionaries. His only other work of importance in addition to the ‘Phraseological Dictionary’ was a careful prose translation from Dante, ‘L'Inferno, en français’ (Paris, 1824, 8vo), with a volume of notes. He died at Windsor on 15 April 1851, having been a master at Eton for twenty-five years. Towards the end of this period had been associated with him in succession his sons, William Henry Tarver and Francis Batten Cristall Tarver, postmaster of Merton College (1848–52), who succeeded his father. The eldest son, Charles Féral, so named after his father's benefactor, a fellow of King's College, Cambridge, became tutor to the Prince of Wales, canon of Chester, and rector of Stisted; he died at Stisted rectory on 19 August 1886. The third son, Joseph Tarver, graduated from Worcester College, Oxford, in 1849, and was in 1850 presented to the rectory of Tyringham with Filgrave, Buckinghamshire.\nThe youngest son, Edward John Tarver (1841–1891), after education at Eton and at Bruce Castle, was articled in 1858 to Benjamin Ferrey, architect. After obtaining several prizes at the Institute and at the Architectural Association, he commenced work on his own account in 1863. His chief ecclesiastical work was the large octagonal church at Harlesden Green (1877–90), and his other works include a large country house for the Murrieta family at Wadhurst, Sussex, the rectory at Broadstairs (1870), and the Brixton Orphanage. He was president of the Architectural Association in 1874, and in 1888 issued his useful ‘Guide to the Study of the History of Architecture,’ being the substance of six courses of lectures on the subject. Tarver, who was an F.S.A. and a fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects, died of pneumonia on 7 June 1891 (R.I.B.A. Journal, 11 June 1891).\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Seccombe, Thomas (1898). \"Tarver, John Charles\".

        "content": "Love Is Yours is the second studio album by indie rock band Flasher, released on 17 June 2022 by Domino. The album was created as a duo of guitarist Taylor Mulitz and drummer Emma Baker following the departure of the band's bassist, and written from 2020 during the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. Upon release, Love is Yours received generally favorable reviews, with critics directing praise to the more introspective, personal lyrics, although with reviews mixed on the merits of the album's lighter, more pop-oriented direction compared to its predecessor, Constant Image.   \n\n\n== Background and recording ==\nLove is Yours was recorded by Mulitz and Baker, following the departure of bassist Daniel Saperstein and the movement of Mulitz to Los Angeles, a period in which the duo re-evaluated whether to continue as Flasher. Writing for the album began in 2020 during the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic, during a time in which with Mulitz and Baker had lost their jobs. Early demos for the album were assembled using drum machines and GarageBand samples, with Baker playing a larger role in songwriting, vocal performance, and instrumentation compared to earlier releases. The partnership led to greater openness to experiment with more \"poppy\" riffs and melodies, with influences including Arthur Russell, Air and Kate Bush. The lyrical content of the album was also intended to reflect a more mature tone, with Mulitz describing the lyrics as centred on \"forgiveness\" and \"coming from a place of making peace with the things that you can and can't control\". Songs for the album were recorded in Washington D.C. with producer Owen Wuerker, who also provided additional instrumentation.\n\n\n== Release and promotion ==\nThe lead single, Sideways, announced in March 2022, featured a video directed by Camille Smura, with Mulitz describing the song as a metaphor about \"driving as a means of escape [and] reflection\". The second single, Love is Yours, was released in March. The track, about the \"roller-coaster highs and lows of a long-term relationship\", was accompanied by a music video, also directed by Camille Smura, inspired by the film National Treasure. A third single, I'm Better, was released in June, with a vintage-themed music video filmed in central Oregon and directed by Jolie Maya-Altshuler. Flasher toured the United States in promotion of the album over June to September 2022. \n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nLove Is Yours received \"generally favorable\" reviews from critics according to review aggregator Metacritic. Hayden Merrick of Under the Radar highlighted the album's \"unique personal voice\" and core lyrical theme of the \"real-life complexity and difficulty of a long-term partnership\", stating that the band \"masterfully obscures pop songs beneath pointed post-punk\". The Fader recommended the album as a \"well-rounded listen\" that expanded on the debut album Constant Image. Describing the album as a \"benevolent, playful record\", Christina McCallum of Exclaim! praised the band's exploration of \"new territory\" in their \"brighter, poppier sensibility\" and lyrical focus on interpersonal connections. Mark Deming of AllMusic noted that the album lacked the \"fine grit\" and \"scrappy punk energy\" of its predecessor, but commended the band for bieng \"more willing to push against their systlistic boundaries\" and demonstrated \"musical maturity\". Max Freedman of Paste considered the album to be a \"portrait of change\" reflecting the band's leaner membership, praising the album's \"faster, more jubilant sounds\" but noting the band \"often sing quietly where they once playfully sneered, and their guitars often purr where they once roared\". Lizzie Manno similarly observed the band's decision to \"opt for a more contemplative sound\", praising the \"admirable devotion to oneself\" in the personal lyrics, but assessed the album lacked \"the same level of potency and lyrical sharpness as their debut\". \n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nEmma Baker – drums, guitar, synth, vocals\nTaylor Mulitz – guitar, bass, synth, vocals\nJon Hand – guitar\nOwen Wuerker – producer, bass, synth, guitar\nJorge Elbrecht – mixing\nDave Cooley – mastering\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Gerard Joseph Van der Meer (1684–1730) was a Catholic clergyman, controversialist and historian from the Low Countries.\n\n\n== Life ==\nVan der Meer was born in Tongeren in the Prince-Bishopric of Liège on 18 March 1684, the son of Christiaan Van der Meer and Elisabeth Somers. He studied at the school of the Canons Regular of St Augustine in Tongeren and at the Diocesan Seminary of Liège.\nHe received the tonsure on 22 March 1704, and was ordained to the priesthood on 14 June 1710. After spending half a year at the Wognum station on the Holland Mission he was appointed vicar of the Church of St Matthias, Maastricht. As the church was in Protestant hands, he exercised his parochial function from St Catherine's Chapel, Maastricht, where he became involved in a controversy with the curate, Franciscus Peeters, against whom he published the pamphlet Maestrichter Jan.\nIn 1713 he was transferred to Ulbeek, and the following year published another anti-Jansenist pamphlet. On 6 December 1714 he was appointed parish priest of the village of Mal (now part of Tongeren), but his installation was delayed because the University of Leuven claimed the right of presentment. His appointment was confirmed by a papal bull on 3 February 1715, after the university had withdrawn its objection to his appointment.\nHe went on to publish three treatises against the abuse of dispensations from matrimonial banns. He also left a manuscript history of his parish, Acta pastorum de Mall et Sluysen, parts of which were published in 1893. He died in Maastricht on 7 August 1730. He had made his will on 5 August, leaving a patch of land to the church of Mal to maintain an annuity to commemorate his service there.\n\n\n== Writings ==\nMaestrichter Jan of het Jansenisdom van den heer Franciscus Peeters, onderpastoor van Sinte-Catharina tot Maestricht (1713)\nLe miserere d'un janséniste pénitent qui se reproche devant Dieu ses iniquités janséniennes (Liège, Beauduin Broncart, 1714)\nRubrum sigillum noxium (Maastricht, Hertus, 1719)\n\n\n== References ==",

He taught mathematics at the University of Vienna.\n\n\n== Life and work ==\n\nVon Metzburg was born in Styria in a family from Upper Austria. His father Christoph Augustin Freiherr von Metzburg was a land rights secretary married to Maria Katharina von Hitzelberg. Von Metzburg joined the Society of Jesus in 1751 and was ordained into priesthood in 1764. He became an assistant at the Vienna Observatory. He then received a doctorate in philosophy in 1772. He used his knowledge of geometry and cartography along with Joseph Liesganig to produce a map of Galicia. In 1774 he took up the chair of mathematics at the University of Vienna, succeeding Joseph Walcher. He taught for more than twenty years.  Athanasios Psallidas produced a Greek translation of his book on arithmetic. His brother Franz Leopold (November 15, 1746 – October 6, 1789) worked as a consul in Iași, Moldavia and inherited the library of Von Metzburg. \nHis writings included:\n\nHelshami Physica experimentalis Newtoniana ex anglico in latinum versa, Vindobonae 1769\nElementa Arithmeticae regularis seu vulgaris, ibid. 1769 (Vienna 1772, Augsburg 1773)\nPraxis geometrica ex principiis Geometriae deducta, ibid. 1777,\nInstitutiones mathematicae.

        "content": "\"Strong\" is a song by the xx member Romy Madley Croft, released mononymously as Romy, featuring Fred Again. It was released on 14 November 2022 by Young, as the lead single to her debut album Mid Air. The trance song was written and produced by Romy, Fred Again, and Stuart Price.\nThe song is about grief, and was inspired by the death of Romy's parents. It was released with a music video directed by Romy's wife Vic Lentaigne, and stars Romy and her cousin Luis. It was nominated for Best Dance/Electronic Recording at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards, the first Grammy nomination of Romy's career.\n\n\n== Writing ==\nRomy initially paired up with Fred Again to write songs for other artists at a point where neither had yet to release any solo music. \"Strong\" came out of those early sessions, with the track inspired by Eurodance and trance music which Romy described as \"emotional music to dance to\". Stuart Price, who Romy started collaborating with on the suggestion of Young founder Caius Pawson, was brought in to finish the track. The song went through multiple iterations, including one change to the bassline inspired by Romy performing the song at a festival and noticing the crowd dancing with their chests rather than their hips as she preferred.\nThe song is about grief, and was inspired by the death of Romy's parents. Per Romy, the song \"is an invitation to the listener and to myself to open up about difficult emotions and connect. It's about vulnerability, and the lyric 'You don't have to be so strong' is about it being OK to be vulnerable.\"\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe song was first teased during Fred Again's Boiler Room set, and later given its live debut at a Fred Again concert in Amsterdam on 25 November. The single was released on 14 November 2022 by Young, as the lead single to her debut album Mid Air. With the release, Romy shared a statement saying:\"Strong\" came from a moment in my life when I was processing past grief. Whilst writing the lyrics I was thinking about my cousin Luis, we both have the shared experience of our mums passing away when we were young. I recognise in him the same trait I have which is to try and hold emotions down and put on a brave face. The song was a way to connect with these feelings, offer support and ultimately find a sense of release in the euphoria of music. Luis is with me on the single cover and in the music video too which was really special.My friendship with Fred [Again] means a lot to me, our closeness helps me to feel safe to be honest and vulnerable lyrically and we definitely connect over our love of songwriting and emotions in dance music. It's amazing and inspiring seeing and hearing what Fred is doing in his solo work and I'm very excited to be releasing this song together.\n\"Strong\" is Romy's second solo single, after she debuted with \"Lifetime\" in 2020. She also previously appeared on the single \"Lights Out\", alongside Fred Again and HAAi, which was released in January 2022.\n\n\n== Remixes ==\nIn December 2022, in sessions recorded at the BBC's Maida Vale Studios, Romy's bandmate Oliver Sim performed a mashup of \"Strong\" and the Verve's \"Bitter Sweet Symphony\", backed by a \"Queer choir\" consisting of Romy, Låpsley, Markia Jackman, Katie Gavin, and Casey MQ.\nTwo remixes of the song, one by I. Jordan and the other by Pretty Girl, were released on 2 February 2023.\n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe song came with a music video directed by Romy's wife Vic Lentaigne. It stars Romy and her cousin Luis hugging each other in the middle of a dancefloor while the camera circles around them. The idea of the video was Romy's, while casting Luis came from Lentaigne.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nDIY's Ben Tipple called the song \"euphoric\". The Irish Times's Siobhán Kane called it \"surprising in its weird mixture of earnest lyrics and frantic tempo\". Kane and The Guardian's Alexis Petridis both compared it to the music of Faithless. NME's Nick Levine wrote that Romy singing the line \"You don't have to be so strong\" felt \"both cathartic and uplifting.\" The Skinny's said it had \"an upbeat energy, encouraging vulnerability and the blissful feeling of euphoria when you're able to truly let go in love.\" Rolling Stone UK's Hollie Geraghty called it \"as much a maximalist trance banger as it is a powerful comment on grief.\"\n\"Strong\" was nominated for Best Dance/Electronic Recording at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards, losing to Skrillex, Fred Again, and Flowdan's \"Rumble\". It was the first Grammy nomination of Romy's career, about which she said \"The fact that this song could reach more people ... and hopefully encourage more people to open up about their feelings is really special to me.\"\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nRomy – vocals, lyrics, composer, producer\nFred Again – composer, producer, programmer\nStuart Price – composer, producer, mixing engineer, programmer\nTeneil Throssell – programmer\nEmily Lazar – recording and mastering engineer\nChris Allgood – mastering engineer\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Marko M. Milošević  (Serbian Cyrillic: Марко М. Милошевић; born 14 January 1999) is a Serbian politician who has served in the National Assembly of Serbia since February 2024 as a member of the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS). He is the grandson of Slobodan Milošević and Mirjana Marković and the son of Marko S. Milošević and Milanka Gajić.\n\n\n== Early years ==\nThe newspaper Danas has observed that Milošević, through no \"fault, participation, or merit of his own,\" has been a public figure in Serbia since before his birth. His mother's pregnancy and the fact that then-Yugoslavian president Slobodan Milošević would become a grandfather were recognized as \"political facts\" in late 1998.\nMarko M. Milošević was born on the evening of Thursday, 14 January 1999, in the Milošević family's hometown of Požarevac. The following Monday, Glas javnosti ran an article on his birth, depicting or possibly inventing the celebrations afterward in the Milošević household. His father was offended by the article and entered the Glas javnosti newsroom on Tuesday morning, armed with a large gun and flanked by two bodyguards. He made threats toward the article's author, Dragan Vučićević (who was not present), and toward others employed by the paper. Danas subsequently reported on his father's actions, which were covered in the international media and created a scandal for the government.\nSlobodan Milošević fell from power in October 2000; in announcing his departure from office in a televised address, he said that he looked forward to having more time to play with his grandson. He was later extradited to The Hague and tried for war crimes by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), dying in 2006 while the trial was still in progress. The ICTY and the successor International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals later concluded that Milošević was part of a joint criminal enterprise for the removal of non-Serb populations from parts of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\nAfter Slobodan Milošević's fall from power, the younger Marko Milošević was raised in Požarevac by his mother, who was by this time separated from his father. He did not inherit his father's brash persona but was a diligent student, moderate in his behaviour. He has said that some of his fellow students initially treated him with reserve but that those who took the time to know him found him to be neither arrogant nor rude.\nMilošević is a graduate of the University of Belgrade Faculty of Law and is now a doctoral student in the same faculty. A March 2024 article in NIN described him as a \"quiet and well-behaved young man.\"\n\n\n== Politician ==\nMilošević joined the Socialist Party of Serbia in 2016. In July 2023, he was elected to the party's main board at the proposal of party leader Ivica Dačić. On the latter occasion, he described the idea of the SPS as \"eternal.\"\nHe appeared in the third position on the Socialist Party's electoral list in the 2023 Serbian parliamentary election. This was tantamount to election, and he was indeed elected when the list won eighteen seats. He is now a member of the committee on labour, social issues, social inclusion, and poverty reduction; a deputy member of the committee on constitutional and legislative issues; a deputy member of the committee on the diaspora and Serbs in the region; and a deputy member of the committee on administrative, budgetary, mandate, and immunity issues.\nThe election of Slobodan Milošević's grandson to the Serbian parliament has prompted much discussion. Although Marko Milošević has never talked publicly about his father or grandfather in detail, he told the tabloid newspaper Kurir in 2016 that his grandfather was his political hero.\nIn March 2024, NIN interviewed Uroš Stambolić – the grandson of Ivan Stambolić, whose 2000 assassination was later found by the Supreme Court of Serbia to have been ordered by Slobodan Milošević – about Marko Milošević's entry into public life. Stambolić was quoted as saying, \"Even though he cannot be guilty for his grandfather’s crimes simply because he is his grandson, he has an even greater responsibility to fight against the glorification of Slobodan Milošević. Sloba [nickname for Slobodan Milošević] is his grandfather and he is being presented in public as Milošević’s grandson, and not as an independent person with merits of his own. Since he is not doing it, not distancing himself from that politics, it is clear that both he and the SPS are looking to glorify Sloba.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Muhammad Shahrizal Jaszle bin Jasmin (born 30 July 1988), commonly known by his stage name Shahz Jaszle, is a Malaysian actor and model.\n\n\n== Career ==\nShahrizal, a mixed-blood Malaysian, Chinese, and Pakistani, has been working in the Malaysian entertainment industry since 2006. began with the RTM TV drama series Tari Tirana and the Remaja Naratif TV program.\nOn 16 May 2013, the Petaling Regional Sharia Low Court issued an order for Shahrizal to appear in court on allegations of khalwat against a 23-year-old bank employee named Farah Nurizzati Salleh. Judge Abd Halim gave him the command to defend in that sense. The Selangor Islamic Religious Department (Jais) arrested Shahrizal and his partner Farah near the Sri Subang Park Apartment at approximately 3.30 am following a public complaint. On 13 November, Farah, on the other hand, acknowledged her mistake and the court fined her a maximum of RM3,000.\nOn 21 February 2014, Shahrizal named his sister as his manager since he didn't trust outsiders following his 2013 arrest. In addition, he stated that, in light of the previous events, he wanted to be extra cautious and that's why his mother Zaleha, accompanied him everywhere, even to the filming location and entertainment events.\nDespite the constant offers to perform, Shahrizal has opted to remain mute on social media and at work since his arrest in 2013. He said that his wife and kids are also involved, and that there could be an age component to this. He returns home from the depiction set with little opportunity to socialise. He needs to take care of home problems and send his children to school. His sole thought was that he didn't want kids to be challenging in the future.\nIn 2024, Shahrizal attempted to shed 10 kilograms (22 lb) of weight in just 23 days in order to fulfill a character requirement for his most recent movie. He claims that the main character in the movie Mayang forced him to follow a diet that consisted of only 500 calories per day while he was a university student. In order to accelerate metabolism and reduce fat without making people hungry, the diet calls for injecting HCG. He said that the HCG diet he followed was in accordance to a clinic's advice and guidance.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nOn 8 December 2012, Shahrizal became engaged to Redwani Putri; nevertheless, their engagement ended in June 2013. He said that he still hasn't started any wedding planning for his fiancé Redzwani Putri, whose wedding is slated for later 2014. On 1 May 2015, he officially wed Nur Hanis Husna binti Mohamad Nadzree.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\n\n=== Drama ===\n\n\n=== Telefilm ===\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\n\n== Awards ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nshahzjaszle on Instagram",

One-half of the 28 members of Gosport Borough Council in Hampshire will be elected, as well as a vacancy in Lee West ward.\n\n\n== Background ==\nGosport has historically been controlled by all 3 major parties. Labour controlled the council from its creation to 1976, when the Conservatives won a majority. This lasted until 1990 when the council fell into no overall control, before being gained by the Liberal Democrats in 1991. At the 1998 election, the council again fell into no overall control, and was gained by the Conservatives in 2010.\nThe 2022 election was to elect all seats following boundary changes. In that election, the Liberal Democrats won a majority, with 16 seats and a 40.9% vote share. The Conservatives won 10 with 42.8%, and Labour won 2 with 11.7%. The 2024 election is for seats held by the candidate with the second-highest number of votes.\n\n\n== Previous council composition ==\n\nChanges:\n\nMarch 2024: John Beavis (Conservative) resigns; seat left vacant until 2024 election\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n== Ward results ==\nAn asterisk denotes an incumbent councillor seeking re-election.\n\n\n=== Alverstoke ===\n\n\n=== Anglesey ===\n\n\n=== Bridgemary ===\n\n\n=== Brockhurst and Privett ===\n\n\n=== Elson ===\n\n\n=== Forton ===\n\n\n=== Grange and Alver Valley ===\n\n\n=== Harbourside and Town ===\n\n\n=== Hardway ===\n\n\n=== Lee East ===\n\n\n=== Lee West ===\n\n\n=== Leesland and Newtown ===\n\n\n=== Peel Common ===\n\n\n=== Rowner and Holbrook ===\n\n\n== References ==",

The resulting perceived temperature is often particularly low, creating a chilling atmosphere. When the region is snowy, the burle can be responsible for the formation of snowdrifts.\nThe \"Triangle de la Burle\" is an expression popularized by the journalist Jean Peyrard in the 1980s to describe an area between the Pilat Massif near Saint-Étienne, Puy-en-Velay, and Mont Mézenc where many air disasters are said to have occurred over the past century.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of local winds\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Joey Siu Lam (Chinese: 邵嵐; born 16 April 1999) is an American human rights activist. During her time in Hong Kong as a student in the City University of Hong Kong, she served as spokesperson of the Hong Kong Higher Institutions International Affairs Delegation (HKIAD) and lobbied internationally on human rights issues during the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nSiu was born in North Carolina in 1999. At the age of seven, she moved to Hong Kong and attended St. Mark's School. She then studied at the Department of Public Policy and Political Science at the City University of Hong Kong. During her time in university, she served as an officer of the 34th Association of Public Administration Disciplines and also became the external vice president of the Interim Committee of the City University of Hong Kong Student Union on 3 June 2019.\n\n\n== Activism ==\nDuring the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests against the Government of Hong Kong's introduction of the 2019 Hong Kong extradition bill, Siu served as the spokesperson of the Hong Kong Higher Institutions International Affairs Delegation (HKIAD), which was a joint effort of members of student unions of 12 higher education institutions in Hong Kong protesting against the extradition bill in an international level. As spokesperson, she travelled to the United Kingdom, United States, Germany and Switzerland to give speeches and lobby against the extradition bill.\nIn October 2019, she and another member of the HKIAD traveled to Frankfurt, Germany to meet with members of the European Parliament to discuss follow-up measures for Hong Kong's human rights issues. On 6 November 2019, Siu accepted an exclusive interview with Conflict Zone by Deutsche Welle titled \"Hong Kong: Will violence kill the pro-democracy movement?\" Interviewed by Tim Sebastian, Siu said in the interview that she agreed that demonstrators should try to use peaceful means to express their demands and believed that violence was not a solution to force the government to respond to their demands, but she did not think that the demonstrators' behavior was out of control. When Sebastian asked her regarding the beating of a 49-year-old pro-Chinese demonstrator by protestors and if this was \"the way you treat people with different opinions?\", she responded back by not looking back at Sebastian and said, \"well, of course this is not an ideal way.\" When Sebastian responded to her, \"ideal? You don't even condemn it?\" Siu said \"We don't condemn anything.\" After the interview was released, it resulted in heated discussions regarding Siu's statements.\n\nIn early June 2020, she became an advisor to the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China and policy advisor to Hong Kong Watch. Later that month, she announced her withdrawal from the HKIAD following the passing of the Hong Kong National Security Law in order to avoid tainting her relatives and friends due to her political stance. She stated that she would still actively campaign for human rights in Hong Kong at the international level. In September 2020, following the increase on crackdown of pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong, she fled to the United States, settling in Washington, D.C. After settling in the United States, Siu continued to advocate and call attention for human rights issues in Hong Kong, such as Hong Kong 12 and Hong Kong 47. On 16 December 2020, she testified at the United States Senate Committee on Judiciary Hong Kong hearing.\nOn 17 October 2021, Siu, a Tibetan-American student and a Vietnamese-American activist protested against the hosting of 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, China by unfurling the Tibetan flag and a banner with the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests' slogan 'Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times' at the Acropolis during the Olympic Flame ceremony. They were detained by the Greek Police. Siu was released after being detained for 26 hours while the others were released after 48 hours. Accused of \"attempting to pollute, damage, and distort a historical monument\", a Greek court acquitted them of all charges on 17 November 2022.\nOn 6 April 2022, she spoke at the Summit for Human Rights and Democracy in Geneva, Switzerland, and on 18 October 2022, at the Oslo Freedom Forum in Taiwan, she stated that her \"situation is to let everyone know how dangerous the national security law is.\" In December 2023, Hong Kong police offered HKD 1 million (US$128,000) bounties for information leading to the capture of five prominent democracy activists based abroad including Siu and wanted for national security crimes. As she holds US citizenship, this made her the first US citizen to be declared a fugitive under the Hong Kong National Security Law. In response to the warrant, she stated: \"My response to the Chinese Communist regime's intimidation is short: I will never be silenced, I will never back down.\" She regularly consults with the FBI due to threats and harassment, and fear of transnational repression after the warrant was placed on her.\nAs of 2024, she serves as a program associate at the National Democratic Institute and an ombudsman of the World Liberty Congress, a global movement of pro-democracy leaders.\n\n\n== Publications ==\n\n\n=== Articles ===\n5 Steps Joe Biden Should Take to Confront the China Challenge, The Diplomat, 5 December 2020\n\n\n=== Testimonies ===\nThe Assault on Freedom of Expression in Asia - Testimony before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific, and International Cybersecurity, Joey Siu, 20 March 2022\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nJoey Siu on Twitter\nCommunity of Democracies page",

        "content": "Nanoscribe is the first company to develop, manufacture, and market 3D printers based on two-photon polymerization. Founded in 2007, the company operates in the field of nano- and microscale 3D printing Nanoscribe's printers are noted for their high resolution, enabling submicron-scale additive manufacturing.\nThis technology opens up avenues for various research methods and applications in fields such as photonics, microoptics, medical, and communication technologies, which were previously out of reach of conventional fabrication methods.\nAccording to the company, more than 4,000 users from more than 30 countries are now using Nanoscribe 3D printers for basic and applied research. Among them are several universities, including Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), California Institute of Technology, University of Oxford, Imperial College London and ETH Zurich.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Foundation and expansion ===\nThe company was founded in 2007 by Martin Hermatschweiler, Michael Thiel, Georg von Freymann and Martin Wegener as the first spin-off of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). The Carl ZEISS company acquired shares in the company in September 2008.\nIn 2008, Nanoscribe opened a subsidiary in Shanghai, China, and in 2019 a subsidiary in Boston, USA. In January 2020, Nanoscribe moved into its headquarters at the ZEISS Innovation Hub @ KIT. Since May 2021 Nanoscribe is part of Cellink, now BICO Group AB. In April 2024, the company has more than 100 employees worldwide.\n\n\n=== Product development ===\nThe first 3D laser lithography system was shipped in June 2008. In 2013, the company introduced the world's fastest 3D printer for nano- and microstructuring; the first commercial 3D printer for microfabrication to use a galvanometer mirror system, typically accelerating printing speed by a factor of 100.\nIn 2019, Nanoscribe introduced the new Quantum X product as the world's first two-photon grayscale lithography system. In December 2021, Nanoscribe and Cellink, a sister company within the BICO group, jointly introduced the new Quantum X bio, a 3D bioprinter with submicron resolution for printing biomaterials, bioresins, biocompatible materials and cell-encapsulated materials for live cell printing.\nIn January 2022, the company introduced the Quantum X align, the world's first 3D printer with automatic alignment on complex substrates such as optical fibers and photonic chips with nanometer precision.\n\n\n== Technology ==\nThe technologies developed by Nanoscribe are based on two-photon polymerization (2PP), which is physically based on two-photon absorption.\n\n\n=== Two-photon polymerization ===\nTwo-photon polymerization (2PP) uses a UV-curable photopolymer but exposes it to lower energy near infrared (NIR) light. At least two photons are required simultaneously to activate the chemical curing process with sufficient energy at a given point in the photopolymer volume. This requires high light intensity, which is achieved by femtosecond laser light pulses at the laser focus only. This allows structures to be printed with approximately 100 times higher precision than with 3D printing technologies based on one-photon absorption.\n\n\n=== Two-photon grayscale lithography ===\nNanoscribe's patented Two-Photon Grayscale Lithography (2GL®) combines the exposure dose variation of one-photon grayscale lithography with the submicron resolution and design freedom of two-photon polymerization. With 2GL, the exposure dose can be modulated during the laser scanning process, allowing the size of each voxel to be varied during the printing process. This drastically reduces the number of laser scanning passes required and thus the printing time.\n\n\n== Application areas ==\nThere are more than 1,800 peer-reviewed scientific publications reporting research primarily based on Nanoscribe systems. A Google Scholar search yields approximately >2,600 publications related to Nanoscribe systems.\n\n\n=== Science and research ===\nSome specific application examples from research:\n\nFilter membranes: 3D-printed membranes can filter tumor cells circulating in the blood for early cancer detection.\nCell scaffolds: Glioblastoma cell cultures can be studied on 3D printed cell scaffolds under proton radiation.\nCochlear implants: A cochlear implant with a 3D-printed steroid reservoir is being developed to reduce further damage to residual hearing.\nResponsive microstents: Scientists fabricate the world's smallest microstent from soft and reactive components.\nMicrofluidic mixers: A miniaturized 3D mixer for producing drug-loaded nanoparticles is printed directly onto a microfluidic chip.\n\n\n=== Industrial mastering ===\nIn industrial mastering, Nanoscribe's Two-Photon Grayscale Lithography (2GL) has been utilized for prototyping and mastering micro- and nanostructured 2.5D topographies. This technology, when combined with suitable replication processes, allows for the production of these topographies in large quantities and with high precision.

        "content": "Mustafa Gül (born June 25, 1961, Kemer) is a Turkish politician, former businessman, and former mayor of Kemer.\nBorn on June 25, 1961, in Kemer, Gül completed his primary and secondary education in Kemer and his high school education in Antalya. He was introduced to commerce while working with his father in the market. He served as the Vice President of the Wrestling Federation from 1995 to 1998 and held founding president and managerial positions in various NGOs. Gül started his business career in tourism management. He was elected as the Mayor of Kemer for the CHP in the 1994–1999 term. After a 10-year break, he was elected as the Mayor of Kemer from the MHP in the March 29, 2009, local elections.\nIn 2012, he was detained on allegations of 'rigging the tender' but was later released. He was re-elected as the Mayor of Kemer from the MHP in the 2014 local elections. In 2015, he married Neşe Gül and is a father of four children. In 2016, he shared a photo with Meral Akşener on Twitter, leading to his referral to the disciplinary board by the party headquarters. He resigned from the MHP without waiting for the process and shortly after joined his former party, the CHP. Since 2012, Gül has been undergoing trial without detention, and the course of the case he is involved in has changed, continuing to be tried on bribery allegations.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Melia Sakakini (1890 – 1966) was a Palestinian nationalist. She was a headteacher and one of the founders of the Arab Women's Association of Palestine.\n\n\n== Life ==\nSakakini was born in 1890. Her elder brother was the Arab Nationalist Khalil Sakakini. She attended a school in Jerusalem before training as a teacher at the college in Bayt Jala which was organised by the Russians.\nIn 1917-1918 her brother was arrested because of his friendship with a man suspected of being an American spy. Melia visited her brother during his detention.\nShe was a Palestinian Christian. She and Zleikha Shahabi, a Muslim, founded the first Arab Women Union Club in 1921.\nAt the beginning of the British Mandate in Palestine, she led a group of women who marched to the British governor's house to protest against the Balfour Declaration. She had said that they had been ruled for centuries by the Ottoman's but she found British colonialism to be unacceptable. As a Christian she enjoyed less restrictions than Muslims. She would visit her brother's children Duma and Hala and they would look forward to the news, she could bring from her less restricted travels.\nShe became a teacher which was one of the most coveted jobs for a woman even though class sizes could be as large as eighty. She led a school as the headteacher.\n\nShe was one of the founders of the Arab Women's Association of Palestine in 1929. She was 39 at the time and one of the older founders who was not married. Initially it was the married women who led the organisation but in time the single women became more prominient. The organisation had strong links to the Arab Executive Committee (AEC) as several founders were married to AEC members and her brother was an AEC member. She was one of a number of older single women like Zahiya Nashashibi who became active in women's organisations. Their reputations could have been damaged but their seniority and their family support protected them. The members of the organisations elected them as they had the time and energy to devote themselves to the cause.\nShe died in 1966.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Blake A. Simmons is an American chemical engineer, entrepreneur and an academic. He is an adjunct professor at the University of Queensland, and the University of Hawaiʻi at Hilo, the Division Director for Biological Systems and Engineering at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and the Chief Science and Technology Officer at the Joint BioEnergy Institute.Simmons is most known for his works on biofuels and biomaterials development using biotechnology and biomanufacturing, alongside the development of nanomaterials for energy applications. Among his notable works are his publications in academic journals, including Energy and Environmental Science, ChemSusChem, Nature Microbiology, Green Chemistry, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, One Earth, and Nature as well as an edited book titled Chemical and Biochemical Catalysis for Next Generation Biofuels.\n\n\n== Education ==\nSimmons completed his Bachelor of Science in chemical engineering from the University of Washington in 1997. In 2001 he obtained a PhD in chemical engineering from Tulane University.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 2001 Simmons began his tenure at Sandia National Laboratories, where he held various roles including Senior Member of the Technical Staff, Principal Member of the Technical Staff, Manager of the Biomass Science and Conversion Technologies Department and Energy Systems Department. From 2010 to 2014, he served there as senior manager for Biofuels and Biomaterials Science and Technology Group, and the DOE Biomass Program Lead. Subsequently, from 2014 to 2016, he was appointed as the senior manager for Advanced Biomanufacturing Group while retaining his role as Biomass Program Lead. Since 2007, he has held the position of Vice-President of the Deconstruction Division and Chief Science and Technology Officer at the Joint BioEnergy Institute. In 2016 he joined Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory where he is serving as the Division Director for Biological Systems and Engineering at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Moreover, he also co-founded Illium Technologies in 2015, Caribou Biofuels in 2020, and Erg Bio in 2023.Simmons served as a graduate student research assistant at Tulane University from 1997 to 2001. He has been an adjunct professor at the University of Queensland since 2012 and the University of Hawai’i-Hilo since 2023.\n\n\n== Patents ==\nSimmons holds patents on several projects. This includes a project focused on upgrading biomass, especially by-products of ethanol production, to generate valuable chemical intermediates, fuels, amino acids, and nutrients through pre-treatment and fermentation techniques using modified organisms.\n\n\n== Research ==\nSimmons' research has focused on bioenergy, biotechnology, biomanufacturing, and the development of nanotechnology and nanostructured materials. His early research demonstrated the use of insulator-based dielectrophoresis (iDEP) for effectively separating and concentrating live and dead Escherichia coli cells by exploiting differences in their dielectrophoretic mobility, offering a tool for bacterial analysis without the drawbacks of traditional electrode-based methods. Investigating the preparation, characterization, and optical properties of two zinc metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) based on stilbene linkers, his 2007 collaborative work with Crissie Bauer and others found that their emission spectra correlate with local ligand environments observed in the crystal structures, with implications for sensor applications. In 2009, he collaborated with Seema Singh and others to investigate the use of auto-fluorescent mapping to visualize cellulose and lignin in switchgrass stems during ionic liquid pretreatment. The study revealed disruption of the cell wall, solubilization of biomass, and subsequent cellulose regeneration with high sugar yields, indicating the potential for efficient biofuel production.Simmons' 2010 work compared the efficiency of two biomass pretreatment technologies, dilute acid hydrolysis and dissolution in an ionic liquid, using switchgrass as a model bioenergy crop, finding that ionic liquid pretreatment enhances saccharification efficiency and glucan yield compared to dilute acid pretreatment. In 2011, he edited the book Chemical and Biochemical Catalysis for Next Generation Biofuels. The book provided a comprehensive overview of catalytic systems and conversion processes involved in the production of lignocellulosic biofuels, comparing biochemical, chemical, and thermochemical approaches to address challenges and advancements in achieving efficient and affordable biofuel production. His 2012 research presented a techno-economic analysis showing that the cost of producing fungal cellulases for lignocellulosic biofuels is higher than commonly assumed, with significant variability depending on factors such as biomass conversion yields and fermentation times. The study also indicated the need for efforts to lower enzyme costs to make biofuel production more economically viable. In 2014, he presented MaxBin, a software algorithm for automatically binning assembled metagenomic sequences, facilitating the recovery of individual genomes from metagenomic datasets. The algorithm accurately identified microbial genomes, as demonstrated through analyses of simulated datasets, real metagenomic data from the Human Microbiome Project, and cellulolytic microbial consortia, allowing for the discovery of novel cellulolytic bacterial populations. In related research, he presented MaxBin 2.0, an improved computational method for recovering microbial genomes from metagenomic datasets.Through his collaborative work at JBEI, Simmons has worked on the development of a novel class of ionic liquids that are biocompatible with enzymes and microbes. More recently in 2023, he collaboratively developed a mathematical model using COSMO-RS-derived parameters and machine learning techniques to predict the solubility of carbon dioxide in deep eutectic solvents, demonstrating its reliability for CO2 capture processes.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n1996 – Dow Chemical Outstanding Junior in Chemical Engineering\n1997 – Recipient, Louisiana Board of Regents Fellowship\n2009 – Outstanding Young Alumnus Award in Science and Engineering, Tulane University\n2010 - Lockheed Martin Leadership Award, Sandia National Laboratories\n2011 – Elected to the College of Fellows, American Institute of Medical and Biological Engineers\n2018 – DOE Secretary of Energy's Achievement Award, Pretreatment and Process Development Team\n2020 – DOE Secretary of Energy's Achievement Award, COVID-19 National Virtual Biotechnology Laboratory Team\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Books ===\nChemical and Biochemical Catalysis for Next Generation Biofuels (2011) ISBN  9781849730303\n\n\n=== Selected articles ===\nLapizco-Encinas, B.

        "content": "People's Court is a residential neighbourhood within the city of George Town in the Malaysian state of Penang. Situated within the city's central business district, it comprises three four-storey blocks of walk-up flats. Built in 1961, it was the first low-cost public housing in Malaysia and remains one of the few populated residential pockets within the city's UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAfter Malaya's independence in 1957, the George Town City Council (predecessor to the present-day Penang Island City Council) faced the challenge of providing affordable housing for the urban poor. A significant number of the city's residents lived in substandard houses within urban kampongs and shophouses. According to a councillor at the time, \"there are about 30 kampongs within George Town's limits with about 5,539 substandard houses inhabited by approximately 50,153 people. In about 19 kampongs the Malays are predominant and in the rest there is a mixture of Malays/Chinese and Malays/Indians.\"\nThe George Town City Council sought to address affordable housing as a crucial electoral issue, particularly after the Labour Party retained control in the 1959 local election. As part of their efforts, the city government initiated People's Court, the first low-cost public housing project in Malaya. The project consisted of three blocks of four-storey walk-up flats arranged in an 'L' shape within the city centre's Chinatown. These blocks include 26 shoplots, ranging from 136 sq ft (12.6 m2) to 582 sq ft (54.1 m2), along with 79 residential units, ranging between 438 sq ft (40.7 m2) to 506 sq ft (47.0 m2).\nSince its completion in 1961, People's Court has served as a major source of low-cost housing within George Town's central business district. In spite of the continuing depopulation of the city centre, People's Court remains one of the few inhabited residential areas within the locality. The three blocks are currently owned and managed by the Penang Island City Council.\n\n\n== References ==",

It is a Northern Indo-Aryan language classified as either a dialect of Kashmiri or an intermediate language between Kashmiri and Western Pahari languages. Kishtwari shares similarities with Kashmiri due to a common origin but has also been influenced by neighboring Pahari languages, resulting in a distinct character. Kishtwari is also considered a tonal language.\n\n\n== Religion ==\nThe Kishtwaris are a religiously diverse community. According to the 2011 census, Islam is the dominant religion, followed by Hinduism. Smaller populations adhere to Sikhism, Christianity, and Buddhism.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Kishtwar region has a rich history of cultural exchange. Traditionally, the area was primarily inhabited by ancestors of the Kishtwaris. Over time, particularly in the 17th and 18th centuries, people from Kashmir and other adjoining areas migrated to Kishtwar, adding to the cultural richness of the region. Today, the Kishtwaris represent a blend of ethnicities.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Massada was a Dutch band that had a funk, rock and pop background with Latin influences. They had several hits in the Netherlands, such as \"Latin Dance\", \"Dansa (Don't Quit Dancing)\" in 1978, \"Unknown Destination\" in 1979, \"Feelin' Lonely\", \"Sajang é\" and \"I Never Had A Love Like This Before\" in 1980.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe group was founded by Johnny Manuhutu. Much of the group were of Moluccan ethnicity.\nAccording to the book in the 33⅓ series, Massada's Astaganaga by  Lutgard Mutsaers, they had opportunities to record since 1975. But due to concessions, the group declined the offers.  However, in 1978, things were set to change. Their debut album Astaganaga was released in that year. The two hit singles \"Latin Dance\" and \"Dansa\" are from that album. Both songs spent eight weeks on the Dutch charts, peaking at 17 and 23 respectively.\nThe group's influences include the groups Malo, Escena and El Chicano. Early on they were compared to Santana but at the time they were not familiar with the group.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 1980s ===\nOn the week of 3 May 1980, Cash Box showed that their single \"Sajang é\" was at no 1 in the Dutch International Best Sellers, Top Ten 45s chart. It had actually been at that position earlier.\nIt was reported by Cash Box in the 26 July 1980 issue that Massada were finialising their contract with their label Telstar Records. Their last album that was recorded at three different locations would be with the current label, however their next album would be produced and recorded by their own company.\nThey recorded the song \"Vahevala\" which was originally a hit for Loggins and Messina in 1972, and covered by Sugar Cane in 1979. Massada's version was backed with \"Trust In Me\" which was composed by De Queljoe, J. Manuhutu, and E. Manuhutu, and released in 1986. Music trade magazine Eurotipsheet reported that it was added to the playlist of Radio Veronica on the week of 1 March. It managed to peak at no. 14 on the Dutch Tipparade chart.\n\n\n== Later years ==\nSome five decades after their formation, they regrouped for a fifty-year anniversary tour in September 2023. The line up at that time was Johnny Manuhutu on lead vocals and percussion, Rudy de Queljoe on guitar, Julian Souisa on guitar, James Sabandar on bass, Alvin Manuhuw on drums, Jopie Manuhutu on timbales and percussion, Freddy Anindjola on keyboards and synthesizer, Daniël Bloem-Beretty on congas and percussion and Nippy Noya on congas and percussion.\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nflikr – Massada Dutch postcard\nLatin World NL – Massada @ Huizen\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDiscogs – Massada (2)\nCountdown channel, Mar 2, 2021 – Massada - Vahevala | COUNTDOWN (1986) (video)\nMassada – Topic channel, Jul 21, 2022 - I Never Had a Love Like This Before\nAJPF Official Channel, Nov 19, 2020 – Artists' Interview | Episode 1 // Johnny Manuhutu, lead singer of Massada group (video)",

        "content": "Silvano Ramaccioni (born 15 January 1939) is an Italian football executive and former sporting director.\n\n\n== Managerial career ==\nHe began his career in football as the secretary of Città di Castello, a role he held from 1963 to 1973. Subsequently, after a year as sports director of Cesena in Serie A in the 1973–74 season, he took on the same role at Perugia from the following season.\nHe sat as a sporting director on the bench of the Grifoni in the 1978-79 season, the season of Perugia's miracles, which went down in Italian football history as the first team in the history of the single round to remain unbeaten for an entire season.\nIn 1982, he moved to Milan, where he served as sports director until 1989 and subsequently as team manager until 2008. In the 1991–92 season, he managed to repeat the record achieved in Perugia thirteen years earlier. In fact, Fabio Capello's Milan led the championship from start to finish, remaining unbeaten and winning the league title.\nOn July 5, 2010, he received a special career award from the province of Perugia.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Shanaka L de Silva is a British-American geologist, academic and author. He is Sri Lankan by birth but grew up in England where he completed his education. He then moved to the US where he is a professor of geology and geophysics at Oregon State University.\nDe Silva is most known for his research into how volcanoes develop and erupt and the risks that they pose, primarily focusing on the largest explosive volcanic eruptions on the planet. He has conducted research on volcanoes in many locations including South America, Indonesia, Japan, China/DPRK and Saudi Arabia. Among his authored works are his publications in academic journals, including the Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research, Nature, and Journal of Petrology as well as books such as Volcanoes of the Central Andes.\n\n\n== Education ==\nDe Silva earned his BSc (Hons). in Geology from the University of Southampton in 1983. In 1987, he went on to receive a PhD in Earth Sciences from the Open University in the United Kingdom.\n\n\n== Career ==\nDe Silva began his academic career in 1987 as a visiting postdoctoral fellow at the Lunar and Planetary Institute, a position he held until 1990. From 1991 to 1995, he served as an assistant professor of geology at Indiana State University, before being promoted to associate professor of geology, a role he occupied from 1995 to 2000. In 2000, he was appointed professor of geology at the same institution, a position he held until 2001. Between 2001 and 2006, he undertook concurrent roles at the University of North Dakota, serving as a department head and professor in the Department of Space Studies.\nBetween 2008 and 2013, de Silva held a fellowship at the NASA Experimental Program for Stimulating Competitive Research and the NASA Space Grant Program. Between 2015 and 2019, he was the vice president of the International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior. Additionally, from 2014 to 2022, he was one of the Science Editors of the journal Geosphere, published by the Geological Society of America. Moreover, he is one of the science editors for GSA Books.\nIn 2014, de Silva was invited to give expert testimony to the 113th Congress, Natural Resources Sub-Committee on \"Volcano Hazards: Exploring the National Preparation and Response Strategy\".\n\n\n== Works ==\nDe Silva has contributed to various publications, including books, throughout his career. In 1991, he co-authored a catalog on Andean volcanoes, featuring detailed information, satellite images, figures, and descriptions of 44 major, potentially active volcanoes in the region. He and his teams have worked on the Altiplano-Puna plateau in South America for almost three decades and, since 2015, on the Toba volcano in Sumatra, making contributions to the understanding of the largest and most explosive volcanoes on Earth—large calderas—and their relationship to granite batholiths. His work on hazardous volcanoes includes his team's various publications on the 1600 eruption of Volcán Huaynaputina and Misti Volcano in Peru, and the Changbaishan/Paektu volcano on the China/DPRK border. He has also published several works using Earth processes and products as analogues for other planets, most notably Mars.\n\n\n== Research ==\nAs part of his volcanism research, de Silva has studied the largest and most explosive volcanoes on Earth, large calderas or supervolcanoes. His 1989 research discovered the Altiplano-Puna Volcanic Complex in the Andes, attributing its formation to large-scale crustal melting caused by crustal thickening and subduction-related magma heat, leading to significant silicic magmatism and extensive ignimbrite eruptions. His work establishes that the formation of complex calderas are the result of crustal processes driven by elevated mantle heat, leading to crustal softening, magma formation, and large-scale volcanic eruptions, thereby redefining such calderas as tectonomagmatic phenomena rather than purely volcanic events. This theme of research has been applied to many other calderas, around the world, including Toba, Sumatra, to help understand their development, evolution and future hazards. In 2007 he contributed to a review that integrated data from volcanic and plutonic rocks to understand them as part of a continuum, proposing that volcanic rocks represent erupted melt-rich regions from crystal-rich reservoirs that later solidify into plutons, ultimately aiming to better understand Earth's magmatic processes and crustal formation.\nIn 2020, de Silva's team presented an analysis of the eruptive history of Changbaishan-Tianchi volcano, confirming three eruptions including the Generalized Millennium Eruption of 946 CE, while also providing new age estimates and insights into the nature of these eruptions. Additionally, he is serving as the Principal Investigator of a project to establish the current state of the active Cerro Blanco caldera magmatic system in Argentina and its potential to erupt again. He is also the Co-Principal Investigator (Co-PI) of a project, aiming to advance techniques for dating explosive volcanic eruptions in the Asia-Pacific region within the last million years.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n1994–1995 – Educational Excellence Award Indiana State University\n2004–2005 – Departmental Excellence in Teaching, University of North Dakota\n2011 – Fellow, Geological Society of America\n2020 – Research Fellow, Alexander von Humboldt Foundation\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Books ===\nVolcanoes of the Central Andes (1991) ISBN 9783540537069\n\n\n=== Selected articles ===\nDe Silva, S.

        "content": "During the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip, Shuja'iyya was the last district in Gaza City that had not been subject to an Israeli ground invasion, and as a result many Palestinians who had not been able to evacuate south had sought refuge in the district. Despite this, the Israel Defense Forces had shelled and bombarded Shuja'iyya for weeks before invading on December 4. On the 26th of December, Israel withdrew from Shuja'iyya, announcing that the local Hamas battalion had been defeated. Despite this, militants continued to attack Israel forces within the town until Israeli forces eventually withdrew.\n\n\n== Background ==\nShuja'iyya is one of the largest and most densely populated neighborhoods in Gaza, holding 92,000 people. As a result of Israeli forces invading south Gaza city, many Palestinians had sought refuge in the neighbourhood, causing rising concerns of civilian casualties if Israel were to expand its invasion into the neighbourhood.\n\n\n== Battle ==\nOn December 4, Israel launched an invasion of Shuja'iyya, advancing from the southern Gaza city after subjecting it to a massive bombardment campaign leaving most of the district in ruins.\nPalestinian militant groups led by the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades confronted Israeli forces on the 6th of December. The paramilitaries took advantage of the environment created by Israeli bombardment and relied on dense buildings to weave throughout the district instead of relying on tunnels, setting the stage for a major urban battle.\nDuring early confrontations, the Qassam Brigades attacked vehicles penetrating into Shuja'iyya, armed with AK-47 and Al-Yassin 105 tandem charge rockets. The packed buildings and tight streets allowed the brigades to approach vehicles at very close distances and fire in rapid succession before hopping between buildings for cover. Infamously, after an Achzarit was destroyed and ignited, a militant stood in front of it and took a selfie.\nAs Israeli forces pushed into the district, reconnaissance published footage of Qassam Brigades militants using buildings as hideouts, including crawling on the floors to avoid detection.\nFighting had become more intense, with the Qassam Brigades utilising dense urban landscape, allowing them in some instances to approach tanks and fire at them from mere metres away, as well as pelting Israeli forces with grenades thrown out of windows.\nOn December 13, the Qassam Brigades lured four soldiers into a coordinated ambush, and then launched successive attacks on Israeli forces sent to rescue those wounded, including collapsing the rigged building on top of them. The IDF admitted that 10 soldiers had been killed in the ambush, including two high-ranking officers.\nBy December 21, Israeli forces claimed they had “operational control” of Shuja'iyya, however the combat did not cease and a significant militant presence continued to attack Israeli soldiers throughout the district.\nPalestinian Islamic Jihad militants of the Al-Quds Brigades set up sniper posts on high-rise structures, jumping between the windows of multi-story high buildings to navigate positions throughout the district. The Qassam Brigades located several Israeli soldiers positioned in buildings and outposts and harassed them, eroding morale and security.\nOn December 26, Israeli forces had retreated from Shuja'iyya, following an incomplete operation that allowed the Palestinian militants to retain control of the town and launch attacks on Israeli soldiers from the area.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\nThe Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor assumes that 1,000 Palestinian civilians were killed in the battle, however due to the extent of destruction and no retrieval of bodies underway in Gaza, the civilian death toll could be much higher. Additionally, three Israeli hostages in Shuja'iyya had been accidentally killed by the Israeli Defense Forces.\nFollowing the withdrawal of Israeli forces, civilians have attempted to repopulate Shuja'iyya but struggle as much of the district lies under rubble, alongside the Israeli siege of Gaza City, and complete destruction of infrastructure by Israeli bombardment.\n\n\n== References ==",

She was part of the national senior group.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nShe was on the US national rhythmic gymnastics team from 1994 to 1997, being part of the national senior group along Kate Nelson, Lori Fredreickson, Aliane Baquerot, Ginny Ledgerwood, Becky Turner, Mandy James and Challen Sievers. They all lived together in suburban Chicago largely due to Sievers’ father, Ron, whose construction firm renovated the house where the gymnasts lived and converted a former racquetball complex into the gym where they trained. They won silver at the 1995 Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, and placed second in the group at the 1995 Four Continents Championships.\nIn the summer of 1996 Brandi, Aliane Baquerot, Kate Nelson, Becky Turner, Mandy James and Challen Sievers were selected to compete at the Olympic Games in Atlanta, the first edition to feature the group competition. They finished in 9th place and so did not advance to the final. She also competed at the 1996 World Championships in Budapest finishing 15th.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Carrie Lee Finnell (November 14, 1899 – November 14, 1963) was an American burlesque dancer and comic entertainer.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nShe was born in Covington, Kentucky, and during her teen years was active in local sports and training for national competitions.  She also took to the stage as a member of the Le Roy Musical Comedy Company and the Guy Players.  As a dancer able to produce high kicks and precise turns, she soon joined a national touring company, and became known as \"Minneapolis's Sweetheart\".  At one point, her legs were insured for $100,000 by manager Noah Schechter as a publicity stunt.  Billed as \"The Girl with $100,000 Legs\", she traveled the country and performed at the Minsky brothers' National Winter Garden theatre in New York.  She won further acclaim at an event in Cincinnati, when a fire broke out in the theatre but she continued performing, helping to ensure that the audience did not panic.  The show was witnessed by Florenz Ziegfeld, who gave her a place as a chorus girl in the Ziegfeld Follies.  \nBy 1923, she started performing as a solo burlesque dancer, performing an early form of striptease.  For one contract in Cleveland, she presented a striptease extending over 54 weeks, removing an item of clothing every week.  Over the weeks, as her clothes became fewer, customer demand increased and ticket prices rose. Towards the end of the engagement, she added tassels from a can-can costume to her pasties, and twirled them round as part of her dance.  \nFinnell developed techniques using her muscles to make her nipple tassels dance, at different speeds and in opposite directions, a technique adopted by later performers. Her obituary said that \"the accent was on comedy, not on smut\". Fellow burlesque performer Ann Corio said of Finnell: \"Faster and faster it [the first tassel] would spin while its fellow tassel lay limp and neglected on the other bosom. Then the other tassel would come to life. It would start spinning slowly, while the first tassel was at full speed. Carrie looked like a twin engine bomber. She would walk across the stage with the tassels swirling in front of her and applause would ring out.\"   Her act was \"hilarious and spectacular\", and unashamedly featured her voluptuous body shape.  She danced rhythmically and provocatively, adding humor to her performances.  She was billed as \"The Bad Girl of Burlesque\", \"The Mammary Manipulator\", and \"The Most Novel And Most Startling Act In Show Business\", and was at one time the highest paid burlesque artist in the world.  \nShe met and married Chicago theatre owner Charles Grow, and settled in Independence, Kentucky, where they set up a nightclub.  They were subject to several court cases over illegal slot machines and gambling.  The couple had a son, but divorced in the early 1930s.  Fennell returned to performing, and moved with her second husband to New York City.   In the 1950s, she gave up performing apart from occasional television and nightclub appearances, the last one two weeks before her death.\nShe died in Fayetteville, Ohio, in 1963 at the age of 64 (though contemporary obituaries gave her age as 70).   \nFinnell was married twice: in the 1920s to Charles Grow, with whom she had a son in 1925; and from 1936 to Thomas Morris, until his death three weeks before her own.\n\n\n== References ==",

They ruled the Khanate of Bukhara from 1599 unti 1785.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1598, Abdullah Khan II from the Shaybanid dynasty, who had rule the Khanate of Bukhara since 1583, died.\nAfter his death, the throne passed to his only son Abd al-Mumin, but he was soon killed by rebels. As the son of Abd al-Mumin was only two years old, the first cousin of Abdullah Khan II, Pir Muhammad II, was chosen as new Khan. This appointment was contested by several other rulers, like Tauekel Khan of the Kazakhs, Kasim Sultan and Baqi Muhammad, son of Abdullah Khan's sister and a prince from Astrakhan named Jani Muhammed Beg.\nBaqi Muhammad was victorious and Pir Muhammad II was killed in battle. With his death, the Shaybanid dynasty ended, and Baqi Muhammad became the first Khan of the Janid or Ashtarkhanid dynasty.\nThe name Janid, comes from his father Jani Muhammed Beg. He was the son of Prince Yar Muhammed, who was a member of the Tuqay-Timurid who had ruled the Astrakhan Khanate, until they were chased by the Russians in 1555.\nThe Janid dynasty ruled the Bukhara Khanate from 1599 to 1785.\nIn 1740, Bukhara was conquered by Persia, but Abu al-Fayz Khan remained on the throne.\nThe real power was in the hands of Ataliq Muhammad Rahim, who even had the Khan killed in 1747. \nThe successors of the Khan were all puppets in the hands of their Ataliqs.This situation ended when the new Ataliq Shah Murad deposed Khan Abu'l Ghazi, pronounced himself Emir of Bukhara and created his own Manghud dynasty.\n\n\n== Rulers ==\nBaqi Muhammad Khan (1599–1605)\nVali Muhammad Khan (1605–1611)\nImam Quli Khan (1611–1642)\nNadr Muhammad Khan (1642–1645)\nAbd al-Aziz Khan (1645–1680)\nSubhan Quli Khan (1680–1702)\nUbaidullah Khan (1702–1711)\nAbu al-Fayz Khan (1711–1747)\nMuhammad Abd al-Mumin (1747–1748, nominal)\nMuhammad Ubaidullah II (1748–1753, nominal)\nAbu'l Ghazi (1758–1785, nominal)\n\n\n== Family Tree ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nThomas Welsford: Four Types of Loyalty in Early Modern Central Asia: The Tuqay-Timurid Takeover of Greater M War Al-Nahr, 1598-1605",

        "content": "Challen Kelly Sievers (born 19 April 1979) is a retired American rhythmic gymnast. She was part of the national senior group.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nChallen began individual rhythmic gymnastics in 1987 and was a junior national champion in individual competition. She was on the US national rhythmic gymnastics team from 1994 to 1996, being part of the national senior group along Kate Nelson, Lori Fredreickson, Aliane Baquerot, Ginny Ledgerwood, Becky Turner, Brandi Siegel and Mandy James. They all lived together in suburban Chicago largely due to her father, Ron, whose construction firm renovated the house where the gymnasts lived and converted a former racquetball complex into the gym where they trained. They won silver at the 1995 Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, and placed second in the group at the 1995 Four Continents Championships.\nIn the summer of 1996 Mandy, Aliane Baquerot, Kate Nelson, Becky Turner, Brandi Siegel and Mandy James were selected to compete at the Olympic Games in Atlanta, the first edition to feature the group competition. They finished in 9th place and so did not advance to the final. After the Games her father bought the Olympic carpets that were competed on in Atlanta.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Qision (Hebrew: קַצִיּוֹן, also spelled Qazion and Qatsion) was an ancient settlement in Upper Galilee, now an archaeological site in northern Israel, featuring the ruins of the settlement, including a public building, possibly an ancient synagogue, alongside an inscription dedicated to the Roman emperor Septimius Severus and his family commissioned by the local Jewish community.\nThe site is known as Ḥorvat Qazyon (Hebrew: חורבת קציון), and in Arabic as Khirbet Qasyun or Khirbet Keisun.\n\n\n== Location ==\n\nThe site is located in the Upper Galilee, approximately 9 km northeast of Safed and 1 km north of Meroth, a Jewish village dating from the Late Roman and Byzantine periods.\n\n\n== History ==\nTwice mentioned in rabbinic literature, particularly in the Jerusalem Talmud, Qision appears in the name of Rabbi Yohanan from Kasion (Hebrew: רִבִּי יוֹחָנָן דְּקַצִיּוֹן), elsewhere as Karṣion (Hebrew: רִבִּי יוֹחָנָן דְּקַרְצִיוֹן), a sage from the third century. These passages strongly suggest the presence of a Jewish community at the site during the second and third centuries CE. This is further supported by surveys conducted on the site, which revealed a primary period of occupation during the same centuries.\nDuring the reign of the Roman Severan dynasty, Qision was part of the province of Syria Phoenice.\nThe site experienced another period of occupation during the Mamluk era, particularly the 13th and 14th centuries, when it was possibly occupied by a Muslim group.\nQision's ruins were first discovered in 1860 by Ernest Renan. The Arabic term Khirbet Keisun, recorded in the PEF Survey of Palestine, preserves the ancient name.\n\n\n== Monumental structure and complex ==\nThe discovery of a distinctive complex of structures in Qision, comprising a sizable monumental building and a western structure, unparalleled elsewhere, alongside an inscription honoring the Roman emperor (see below), has sparked significant scholarly debate about its intended function. Opinions are split between two interpretations: Jewish synagogue or a Syro-Phoenician Roman temple.\nErnest Renan, who discovered the site in 1860, and Victor Guérin, who referenced it in his 1880 book, both identified the structure as a synagogue. However, PEF explorers Conder and Kitchener, following their visit in 1877, proposed identifying it with a Roman temple, dating back to the same period as the Temple at Kedesh.\nIn the 20th century, E.W.G. Masterman, in his 1909 writing, identified the site as a synagogue. Conversely, in a 1916 study, E. Kohl and C. Watzinger classified it as a temple, drawing parallels to Kedesh and other Roman temples in the region. In 1987, following a survey, A. Bar Oz and Zvi Ilan concluded that it was a public building with pagan characteristics.\nIn an effort to resolve this dispute, Rachel Hachlili and Ann E. Killebrew undertook three survey seasons at the site in 1992 and 1997. Despite their consensus that it was not a synagogue, they arrived at differing conclusions.\nKillebrew proposed that the structure might have functioned as part of a cultic complex for ceremonies or festivals, constructed by local Jews to honor the imperial family of Septimius Severus.\nHachlili interpreted the site as a complex that served as a communal and religious center for priestly families relocating to Galilee after the Jewish–Roman wars, along with the local Jewish communities, serving as a space for the performance and preservation of priestly rituals. According to her analysis, the architectural features and the presence of ritual purification pools and an incense altar suggest its role in maintaining Jewish religious practices following the destruction of the Temple. This includes facilitating rituals like incense burning and the Water Libation Ceremony observed in the Temple during Sukkot.\n\n\n== Inscription ==\nA Greek-language inscription was found in Qision, dating to 195/6 CE. Discovered near an ancient building in 1860 by Ernest Renan, it was rediscovered in 1984. This inscription, originally part of a lintel, is dedicated to the salvation of Septimius Severus and his family.\nThe inscription is missing a section from the right corner. On the left side, a wreath with stylized leaves ending in a ribbon bound in a 'Hercules' knot features the name of Julia Domna. A similar wreath on the right side is missing.\nThe inscription was dedicated by the local Jewish community, as indicated in its text \"in accord with the vow of the Jews\" (originally [ἐξ] | εὐχῆς Ἰουδαίων). The Jewish villagers of Qision sought to display their loyalty to the imperial family, mirroring the practices of other communities in the province of Syria.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAlma – a nearby site with the remnants of an ancient synagogue along with Jewish inscriptions\nKalybe (temple) for cult of the emperor\nRoman imperial cult\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The siege of Venlo was an 12-day siege of the city of Venlo commenced by the Grand Alliance which saw the city being taken after being occupied by French troops the year before. The siege of Venlo in 1702 was one of many sieges that Venlo had endured throughout its history.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Spanish king, Charles II died in 1700 without an heir to his throne. Ever since Charles' death, there had been disputes about his succession. The two main claimants to his throne were Philip of Anjou. And Charles VI of the house of Habsburg. These tensions of who was to success Charles II escalated into a full scale War between Spain loyal to Philip of Anjou backed by France and it's allies. And Spain loyal to Charles VI backed by the Grand Alliance.\nThe War of the Spanish Succession had commenced in the Netherlands in 1702 with the Allied siege and capture of Kaiserswerth, and with the unsuccessful assault of the French army on Nijmegen. The French forces that invaded Zeeland were repelled when they tried to take Middelburg. Marlborough took command of the combined Anglo-Dutch army on 1 July and at the head of 60,000 men went on the offensive by moving into the Spanish Netherlands. Like Frederick Henry in 1632, the British commander followed the course of the river Meuse. The river was very important as a line of operation, because, due to the inadequacy of the land roads at that time, the possession of a river or a canal to transport an army's military necessities was not only advantageous, but almost necessary.\nAfter outmaneuvering the French army of Boufflers, Marlborough proceeded with the allied army towards Venlo, where the Dutch Obdam and Prussian General Von Heiden had already invested the city. Venlo could not be considered a particularly strong fortress, neither due to its location nor its defensive works. Originally, like all strongholds in the Spanish Netherlands, it had been in a state of total neglect. However, in the last year, it had been put in better condition by the French. Venlo and the associated fort Sint-Michiel were occupied by 2,500 French troops under Brigadier de Labadie. The governor of the city was the Count of Varo.\n\n\n== Battle ==\nAlthough it lasted for 12 days, the siege of Venlo was a bloody event due to the large usage of artillery. Before the siege itself, famine and hot weather were present in the city. \nAnd due to the massive movement of soldiers which spread disease, caused the population of Venlo to decline by 10%. Christian Davies, who was a dragoon of the army. States that the inhabitants of Venlo fled the city and left their implements behind during the siege.6 days after the initial siege started, Allied forces stormed and assaulted the Citadel, and on the 23rd of September, the garrison of Venlo was forced to surrender.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe Allied victory at venlo was a major victory for the Grand Alliance, because the victory marked a turning point in the Low Countries which saw the French invasion of the Netherlands get repelled and the War opening up in the Southern Netherlands and near the Meuse. The 1702 siege of Venlo was also one of the most significant sieges of the history of Venlo and one of the most significant sieges in the Low Countries during the Spanish War of Succession. King Louis XIV saw the taking of the city as a major defeat. He stated that the city of Venlo was the key to Guelders and further fortresses located near the Rhine which were important factors to French defence and Military success.After victory in Venlo the Grand Alliance saw even more success in which the Allied forces took the cities of Stevensweert, Roermond and Liège among the Meuse.Venlo itself along with other parts of Spanish Guelders were ceded to the Dutch Republic after the Peace of Utrecht.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nPhilosophers of War, The Evolution of History's Greatest Military Thinkers (E-book ed.).

Their personalities stand opposite to the characteristics traditionally associated with masculinity and femininity in Asian societies in general.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nPepe Herrera as Junjee\nToni Gonzaga as Sheena\nYayo Aguila\nBodjie Pascua\nAlma Moreno\nBoboy Garrovillo\nJoey Paras\nBenj Manalo\nMark Christopher Israel as Junjee's Classmate\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was announced in 2021, to be starred by Toni Gonzaga and Pepe Herrera.\nFilming and production completed in the same year.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe film was released on January 31, 2024, under Viva Films.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nThe film earned ₱5.2 million on its opening day.\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nThe movie received a score of 68/100 from 8 reviews according to review aggregator website Kritikultura, indicating generally positive reviews.\nGoldwin Reviews gave the film 3 out of 5 stars and said, \"Kinulang sa kilig ang palabas na’to dahil sa katangian at kilos ng mga karakter. Ngunit dahil sa mga biruan nila, nagkaroon ng saya. Dahil sa pagganap ng mga bida, nagkaroon ito ng puso. My Sassy Girl may not be that romantic and sassy, but it has enough comedy, drama and heart to consider it a decent film.\"\nFred Hawson of News.ABS-CBN.com, also gave the film a mixed reaction and rated it 6/10, remarking, \"On their own, Toni Gonzaga and Pepe Herrera were very capable actors in both their dramatic and comedic scenes. However, there was not much real spark nor romantic thrill between them to excite or delight viewers when they were together. In any case, the way director Fifth Solomon handled the revelations building up to the ending was still able to make us root for the two of them to wind up together despite all the gaslighting and ghosting that went on.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMy Sassy Girl at IMDb",

It is 85 kilometres (53 mi) long and has a catchment area of 2,080 square kilometres (800 sq mi).\nThe river water is used for irrigation of nearby farmland in the summer and to provide drinking water to local settlements.\n\n\n== Course ==\nThe Ashchysu has its sources in a spring of the southern slopes of the Semizbughy massif of the Kazakh Uplands. It heads first southwards, then it bends and flows roughly westwards within a plain to the north of the Ayr Mountains. Downwards from its middle course the river channel forms meanders. The water of the river is fresh in the upper reaches, its salinity increasing further downriver. The Ashchysu reservoir is located in the final stretch, about 12 km (7.5 mi) upstream from the confluence with the Nura. Finally it reaches the right bank of river Nura 12 km (7.5 mi) upstream from Sheshenkara village, former Proletarskoye.\nThe Ashchysu is fed by snow and underground water. The river flows all year round and is frozen between November and mid-April. Its main tributary is the Akkora (Аққора), flowing from the northwest into its right bank.\n\n\n== Fauna ==\nAmong the fish species inhabiting the waters of the Ashchysu, the crucian carp, tench, pike, perch and ide are worth mentioning.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of rivers of Kazakhstan\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Almuth was a German fishing trawler which was built in 1937. She was requisitoned by the Kriegsmarine during the Second World War. She was used as a minesweeper under the Pennant numbers M 1403 and M 4414, and later as the Vorpostenboot V 622 Almuth. She struck a mine and sank in June 1944.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe ship was 35.76 m (117 ft 4 in) long, with a beam of 7.49 metres (24 ft 7 in). She had a depth of 3.28 m (10 ft 9 in). She was assessed at 269 GRT, 120 NRT. She was powered by a diesel engine, which had 8 cylinders of 28 centimetres (11 in) diameter by 44.9 centimetres (17+11⁄16 in) stroke. The engine was built by Klöckner-Humboldt-Deutz AG, Köln, Germany. It was rated at 94 nhp. It drove a single screw propeller. It could propel the ship at 11 knots (20 km/h).\n\n\n== History ==\nAlmuth was built as yard number 117 by Schulte & Bruns, Emden, Germany. She was launched on 5 May 1937 and completed on 8 July. She was owned by the Leerer Heringfischerei AG, Leer. Her port of registry was Leer. She was allocated the Code Letters DGLA, and the fishing boat registration AL 36.\nOn 11 September 1939, Almuth was requisitioned by the Kriegsmarine, serving with 14 Minensuchflotille as the minesweeper M 1403. On 12 April 1942, she was reallocated to 44 Minensuchflotille and her pennant number was changed to M 4414. On 1 January 1943, she was designated as a vorpostenboot. She was allocated to 6 Vorpostenflotille as V 622 Almuth. On 5 June 1944, she struck a mine off Saint-Nazaire, Loire-Inférieure, France (47°06′07″N 2°25′06″W). She was taken in tow but consequently sank.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nGröner, Erich (1993). Die deutschen Kriegsschiffe 1815-1945 (in German).

        "content": "Thomas Henry Weist-Hill (3 January 1828 – 26 December 1891) was an English violinist, conductor and academic. He was the first principal of the Guildhall School of Music.\n\n\n== Life ==\nWeist-Hill was born in London, son of Thomas Hill, goldsmith and freeman of the city. He showed an early talent for the violin, and, after appearing at Gravesend as an infant prodigy, he entered in 1844 the Royal Academy of Music, where he studied under Prosper Sainton, and in 1845 took the King's Scholarship. He was subsequently a professor of the violin at the academy, and conducted its choir and orchestra. On leaving the institution he soon became known as a concert violinist, and was taken up first by Edward James Loder, and then by Louis-Antoine Jullien, with whom he toured in America. There he was the first to make known Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto, and he visited the principal continental cities.\nReturning to London, he was engaged as first violin by Michael Costa, under whom he played for many years in the orchestras of the Philharmonic Society and the Sacred Harmonic Society. On the opening of the Alexandra Palace in 1873 he was appointed musical director, and in that capacity promoted new compositions by British composers, and revived forgotten works, such as Handel's Esther and Susanna. In 1878 he conducted the orchestral concerts of Jenny Viard-Louis, at which several important works were heard for the first time in England. He was appointed principal of the Guildhall School of Music in 1880, and held that post until his death in South Kensington on 26 December 1891. He was regarded as an admirable violinist and an able administrator. He wrote a few compositions, mostly for violin and cello, of which the \"Pompadour Gavotte\" became popular.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nAttribution\n\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Hadden, James Cuthbert (1899). \"Weist-Hill, Thomas Henry\".

        "content": "J. Charles Jennette is a physician, nephropathologist, academic, and author. He served as Kenneth M. Brinkhous Distinguished Professor and Chair of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine, and Chief of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Services at UNC Hospitals from 1999 to 2019.\nJennette's research focuses on understanding the causes of kidney diseases, particularly those induced by inflammatory and immunologic mechanisms, and improving the diagnosis and treatment of these diseases. He has authored and edited books, book chapters and articles in medical journals, and is an editor of four editions of the nephropathology textbook titled Heptinstall's Pathology of the Kidney. He has more than 25 named lectureships including the UNC School of Medicine 2015 Norma Berryhill Distinguished Lecture. He is the recipient of the Order of the Long Leaf Pine Award from the Governor of North Carolina for exemplary service to the State, Distinguished Service Award of the Association of Pathology Chairs, UNC Medical Alumni Distinguished Faculty Award, and Robert H. Heptinstall Lifetime Achievement Award from the Renal Pathology Society.\nJennette served as the founding Secretary Treasurer of the Renal Pathology Society from 1993 until 1998, was elected vice president in 2003, and became president in 2004. He also served as President of the Association of Pathology Chairs from 2008 until 2010.\n\n\n== Education ==\nJennette received his Bachelor of Science in Zoology from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1969 and received his M.D. from the UNC School of Medicine in 1973. From 1973 to 1977 he completed anatomic and clinical pathology residency training at UNC, as well as an immunopathology research fellowship at Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation in La Jolla, California.\n\n\n== Career ==\nJennette began his faculty career in 1978 as an instructor of pathology at the School of Medicine at the University of Carolina at Chapel Hill. He was appointed assistant professor of pathology in 1978, promoted to associate professor of pathology in 1985, and Professor of Pathology in 1991. From 1999 to 2019, he served as Kenneth M. Brinkhous Distinguished Professor and Chair of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at the UNC School of Medicine, and as Chief of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Services at UNC Hospitals.\nFrom 1978 to 2019, Jennette was Director/Executive Director of the UNC Nephropathology Laboratory. He and his faculty associates established this regional nephropathology diagnostic service.\nIn 2019, Jennette stepped down as Chair of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine. He continues to hold a faculty position as Professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine in the Division of Nephropathology, and Professor of Medicine in the Division of Nephrology and Hypertension at UNC Chapel Hill.\n\n\n=== Research ===\nJennette's research encompasses clinical research based on evaluation of data obtained from patient medical records, clinical laboratory data, and pathologic evaluation of kidney biopsy specimens; basic research based on experimental investigations using specimens from patients or animal models of kidney disease; and translational research designed to apply (translate) basic research discoveries into improved diagnosis and treatment of disease in patients. Ronald J. Falk has been a colleague in many of his research works.\n\n\n=== Clinical and clinicopathologic research and scholarship ===\nJennette and his associates have performed and published clinical and clinicopathologic studies, and recommendations for the management, diagnosis, and classification of kidney diseases. He was a member of consensus groups that published recommendations for pathologic diagnosis of kidney transplant rejection, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, IgA nephropathy, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, C1q nephropathy, membranous nephropathy, lupus nephritis, and ANCA glomerulonephritis.\nIn 1994 and 2012, Jennette and his associate Falk led two international consensus conferences that standardized the names and pathologic features of different forms of vascular inflammation (vasculitis).\nJennette and Falk established the Glomerular Disease Collaborative Network (GDCN) in 1985 to promote collaborative research on glomerular disease among UNC faculty in nephrology and nephropathology, along with community practice nephrologists who refer kidney biopsies to UNC for diagnosis.\nClinical and clinicopathologic research projects have utilized GDCN resources, including the article published by Jennette and Falk in The New England Journal of Medicine in 1988, which reported the discovery that one major antigen target of ANCA is myeloperoxidase (MPO-ANCA) and clarified the diverse clinical and pathologic spectrum of ANCA disease, using data and samples obtained through the GDCN. In 1990, they documented that the other major antigen specificity of ANCA is proteinase 3 (PR3-ANCA).\nOne of Jennette's clinical research associates is his daughter, Caroline Poulton, who is the Director of Research Operations for the UNC Kidney Center. They are co-authors on 20 journal articles that focus on various clinical aspects of kidney disease with the goal of improving patient outcomes, such as a study to optimize treatment outcomes for patients with ANCA vasculitis.\n\n\n=== Basic research and translational preclinical animal model research ===\nJennette, in collaboration with Falk, and UNC faculty associates Hong Xiao and Peiqi Hu, and other faculty and trainees, made multiple discoveries about the cellular and molecular mechanisms that cause ANCA disease. He, Falk, and their research associates published the first demonstration that ANCA can activate neutrophils in vitro, and the first in vivo animal model confirming that ANCA antibodies cause glomerulonephritis by inducing glomerulonephritis and vasculitis in mice by intravenous injection of anti-MPO antibodies. This model has been used to make discoveries about the pathogenesis of ANCA disease, including the discovery of a key role for alternative complement pathway activation and C5a receptor engagement, which can be targeted by a novel small molecular inhibitor of C5a receptor (Avacopan). This approach to therapy was FDA-approved for patient care in 2021.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nJennette is married to Yvonne Jennette. They have two daughters, Jennifer Jennette, and Caroline Poulton; and three grandchildren.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Selected books ===\nDiagnosis and Management of Renal Disease and Hypertension (1988) ISBN 9780812111293\nImmunohistology in Diagnostic Pathology (1989) ISBN 9780849349874\nNon-neoplastic Kidney Diseases (2005) ISBN 9781881041962\nPrimer on Kidney Diseases (2009) ISBN 9781416051855\nFundamentals of Renal Pathology (2013) ISBN 9783642390791\nHeptinstall's Pathology of the Kidney (2024) ISBN 9781975161538\n\n\n=== Selected articles ===\nFalk, R.

        "content": "The Tobati People (also known as Tobati-Enggros; also referred to as Youtefa Tobati) are an ethnic group from Jayapura, Indonesia. The Tobati people inhabit the coastal area of Youtefa Bay, covering an area of 1,675 hectares within the South Jayapura district, and they have constructed settlements above the sea.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe word Tobati has the same origin as Tabi, which means \"sunrise.\" This village is believed to have been founded by the 'siblings of the sun,' hence named Tabati, which later became Tobati. According to another source, the name Tobati comes from to, meaning Sultan's command, and \"bati,\" means boundary, indicating the Sultan of Tidore boundary reached Tobati Island.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Tobati people are the original inhabitants of Jayapura. This tribe is also known as the Tobati-Enggros tribe. However, Enggros is occasionally considered a separate tribe but still closely related to Tobati. Apart from the Tobati tribe, there are also other indigenous tribes in Jayapura City, such as the Kayu Pulau, Kayu Batu, Nafri, Skouw, and Sentani tribes.\nNot far from the center of Jayapura city, about 20 minutes towards Abepura district, there is a bay called Youtefa Bay. In the bay, there are two traditional villages of the Tobati tribe, Tobati and Enggros, which have long inhabited the area.\n\n\n== Customs ==\n\n\n=== Leadership system ===\nThe Tobati, like other tribes in Youtefa Bay, has a traditional political leadership system led by an ondoafi (village leader or chief), and the position has been inherited through generations. When the evangelist Built began serving in the Tobati area, Tobati was led by a tribal chief named Jantewai. When Jantewai passed away, his son Hamadi was appointed as the ondoafi. To this day, the Hamadi clan still holds the position of ondoafi of the Tobati tribe that leads several other tribal chiefs/clans such as Itaar, Afaar, Hanasbey, Mano, Ireeuw, Hasor, Merauje, Merahabia, Caay, Hanoeby, and Dawir.\n\n\n=== Marriage ===\nDuring the marriage procession, the Tobati people must undergo 7 customary processes before officially becoming a family. The first process begins with the groom's side, which is the proposal process. The groom's family will go to the bride's house to seek permission to propose to the bride. After that, in the second process, the bride's side will reciprocate the visit by sending food to the groom's house. The third process is where the groom's side will gather a certain amount of dowry as agreed upon. In the fourth process, still from the groom's side, the dowry will be directly delivered to the bride's side. Then, in the fifth process, both sides are ready to conduct the holy wedding blessing in the church and simultaneously register the marriage at the Civil Registry Office. After that, the sixth process is where the bride will be escorted to the groom's house. The last process is to deliver various kitchen utensils from the bride's side to the groom's house. All processes have been completed and will be concluded by signing the dowry acceptance agreement from the groom's side to the bride's side, which will end with a feast or meal together.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Sway ===\nTobatis' daily dwelling place is called a sway house. The sway house is almost similar to the traditional kariwari house, with differences in the allocation or function of its rooms. This is done as a development of the traditional house form so that the traditional house and the living house can be distinguished while still remaining a characteristic building of the Tobati tribe. The allocation of each room in the sway house consists of a living room, bedroom, and dining room.\nThe layout of sway house buildings is constructed on the edge or at the side of the main village road, and the orientation of the buildings is directed towards the main road so that the houses face each other. In more detail, the layout of rooms within the sway consists of bedrooms, a living room, a kitchen area (often referred to as the working area for women), and a back terrace.\nAs for the interior of the house, the rooms are divided based on gender. The area for men is positioned towards the sea, while the area for women is inclined towards the land.\n\n\n=== Kariwari ===\n\nThe traditional house of the Tobati is called kariwari or mau house. This traditional house, which is 20–30 meters high, is for males aged 12 and above. It serves as a place for traditional ceremonies and also educates young boys on how to earn a living and survive by learning skills such as carving, weapon-making, boatbuilding, and warfare techniques.\nThe shape of this building itself is square or octagonal, resembling a cone, with its division consisting of 3 main floors: the foot part (floor 1), the body part (floor 2), and the head part (floor 3). The first floor is used as a place to educate young boys. The second floor is the tribal chief's room, meeting room, and resting place for males. Meanwhile, the third floor is used as a prayer area.\nThe octagonal shape of this building is constructed so that it can withstand strong wind. According to Tobati tradition, the conical roof allows them to be closer to their ancestors. The floor is made of layers of wood bark, while the building walls are made of bamboo tree shards, and the roof is made from sago leaves.\n\n\n=== Keramba ===\n\nThe settlement of the Tobati tribe is located directly in coastal or marine areas. Therefore, fishing is one of their main activities, especially for men. Building kelong (floating fish pens) is a mandatory activity for them. The characteristic feature of the Tobati's kelong is that it is made from bamboo poles. These kelongs are usually placed beneath the houses, with nets surrounding each house pole.\nGiant trevally and rabbitfish are two fishes most commonly cultivated by the Tobati people. In addition to catching fish, kelongs are also used to hold various small fish to attract larger fish into the nets set up around the bottom of the house.\n\n\n== Religion ==\nBefore the introduction of Christianity and Islam in Jayapura, the Tobati tribe still adhered to animism or belief in ancestors. The evidence of this can be seen in the Kariwari house buildings. The conical or pyramid-shaped roof is interpreted by the Tobati as a form of respect for their ancestors and to bring them closer to God. At that time, The Tobati community also communicated with the Sultanate of Tidore, which later spread Islam through Muhammad Asghar, a scholar from Baghdad sent by the Ottoman Empire. Because of this, there are many historical remnants of Islam, such as mosques, some of which have been turned into museums in South Jayapura.\nSince the arrival of European missionaries, especially the Dutch, in 1910, Christianity has had a greater influence on the Tobati people's beliefs than the influence of the Sultanate of Tidore. The Gospel was spread in Papua, including the Tobati and Enggros villages, and the teachings of Christianity were subsequently accepted by the surrounding communities. Eventually, the Tobati people adhered to Christianity.  Since the arrival of the Dutch, the mau houses were considered idols and inconsistent with Christian teachings, so the mau houses were destroyed, leaving poles the only remnants that can still be seen today.\n\n\n== Transportation system ==\nThe Tobati tribe is a community inhabiting coastal areas, hence their main mode of transportation is boats. The local inhabitants call it wah, which means \"boat.\" The people in Tobati village and Enggros village use wah as a means of public transportation and also for fishing. Initially, rowing was used to operate the wah, but nowadays, automatic engines have been used at wah to facilitate travel. Previously, traveling to a certain place took about 30 minutes, but now, with engines, the journey only takes around 4 minutes.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

Burshtein decided to set and film much of the series in Tiberias as it connected to her own  biography. As a secular woman, she was not impressed with the '80s aesthetic and appearance of the city. However, when she became religious, she looked at the city differently. She recognized it's place in the Scriptures as one of the five holy places in the world and that \"It could never be Tuscany, because there’s so much holiness in this place.\"\n\n\n=== Casting ===\nBurshtein spoke to Kveller about her reasons for casting Levi, a secular actor: \"He’s 44 [now]. All his sensibilities, all his intelligence, is very, very strong when you say action. We would rehearse, and he doesn’t know the text… but when you say action, he knows the text. It’s a bit mystical, the way he’s so talented. He understands characters in such a deep way that I could really speak to him in my terms and he understood it, which is not easy.\"\nBushtein previously cast Irit Sheleg as the matriarch, Rivka Mendelman in her 2012 drama film, Fill the Void. Bushtein had also previously worked with Noa Koler, directing her in The Wedding Plan (2016).\n\n\n=== Music ===\nThe soundtrack and songs in the series are provided by the Israeli musician, Daniel Zamir. Burshtein hired Zamir before she cast the show and he wrote the music after reading the script. \n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe show has been a critical success, winning three awards from the Israeli Academy of Television. The Jewish Chronicle described it as a \"gripping coming-of-age love story\" and included it in its list of best television for 2024. Levi was awarded the Best Actor award for an international series at Series Mania in France in 2022. Writing in The Forward, Simi Horwitz praised the show: \"Rama Burshtein-Shai’s eight-part TV series Fire Dance is also one of the most haunting, even mystical and, in the end, compelling works that I’ve seen in a long time.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nIsraeli television\nCulture of Israel\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nIMDB",

        "content": "Swainsona microcalyx, commonly known as wild violet, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae and is endemic to southern mainland Australia. It is a prostrate or low-growing perennial herb, with imparipinnate leaves with 5 to 9 broadly egg-shaped to wedge-shaped leaflets and racemes of 5 to 15 purple flowers.\n\n\n== Description ==\nSwainsona microcalyx is a perennial herb, low-lying at first, then with ascending stems up to 10–30 cm (3.9–11.8 in) long and hairy. The leaves are imparipinnate, mostly 30–90 mm (1.2–3.5 in) long with 5 to 9 broadly egg-shaped leaflets with the narrower end towards the base, or wedge-shaped, the lower leaflets mostly 3–15 mm (0.12–0.59 in) long and 1–4 mm (0.039–0.157 in) wide with stipules 1–5 mm (0.039–0.197 in) long at the base of the petioles. The flowers are purple, arranged in racemes of 5 to 15, on a peduncle 0.5–2 mm (0.020–0.079 in) wide, each flower 5–8 mm (0.20–0.31 in) long on a pedicel 1–3 mm (0.039–0.118 in) long. The sepals are joined at the base to form a tube 1.5–2.0 mm (0.059–0.079 in) long, with teeth shorter than the tube. The standard petal is 6–8 mm (0.24–0.31 in) long and 5–8 mm (0.20–0.31 in) wide, the wings 6–8 mm (0.24–0.31 in) long and the keel 6–8 mm (0.24–0.31 in) long and 2.0–2.5 mm (0.079–0.098 in) broad. The fruit is a narrowly egg-shaped to elliptic pod about 20 mm (0.79 in) long and 3–4 mm (0.12–0.16 in) wide with the remains of the style about 4 mm (0.16 in) long.\n\n\n== Taxonomy and naming ==\nSwainsona microcalyx was first formally described in 1924 by John McConnell Black in the Flora of South Australia. The specific epithet (microcalyx) means \"a cup\" referring to the shape of the sepal tube.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nThis species of pea is mostly found north of the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia, with an outlier in inland Western Australia.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Semenivka (Ukrainian: Семенівка, romanized: Seménivka, Russian: Семёновка, romanized: Semjónovka) is a village in Pokrovsk Raion, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine. During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Battle of Avdiivka and subsequent capture of the city by Russian forces led to the village eventually becoming a frontline settlement. While natural defensive lines including hills and a local water reservoir have aided Ukrainian forces in the defense of the village: a lack of proper man-made defenses, alongside shortages in personnel and equipment, have been cited by multiple Ukrainians as making the continued defense of the village particularly difficult in wake of simultaneous Russian attacks from positions in Berdychi in the northeast and Orlivka in the southeast. As of April 2024, the village is contested between Ukrainian and Russian forces.\n\n\n== History ==\nAccording to the 2001 Ukrainian census, the village had a population of 182 people, of whom 54.95% said that their native language was Russian, and 45.05% Ukrainian.\nOn 17 June 2020; Decree No. 33, Article 235 of the Verkhovna Rada placed the village in the administration of the Ocheretyne settlement hromada, also incorporating it into the significantly expanded Pokrovsk Raion.\n\n\n=== Russian invasion of Ukraine ===\n\nDuring the War in Donbas beginning in April 2014, the village was subject to multiple ground and aerial attacks by Russian forces due to its relative proximity to the frontline city of Avdiivka. One particular battle, which took place in the village sometime in 2016, destroyed multiple houses and pieces of infrastructure in the village. In the Russian invasion of Ukraine beginning in February 2022; after the conclusion of the Battle of Avdiivka on 17 February 2024 and the subsequent capture of the city by Russian forces, the village became a frontline settlement after closer settlements to the city were taken quickly in the days following. The \"unusually rapid advance\" of Russian forces in the villages leading up to Semenivka was cited by The New York Times as a result of poor local Ukrainian defense lines outside of the city, with natural barriers like hills and a water reservoir beside the village serving as the primary defensive line. Alongside Semenivka, the villages of Berdychi, Orlivka, and Tonenke were cited by the Ukrainian army chief Oleksandr Syrskyi as objectives in the Russian forces advance from the city. In March, the capture of Orlivka by Russian forces to the southeast of the village allowed attacks to take place on Semenivka simultaneously with other recently captured positions in Berdychi to the northeast of the village. On 28 March and 1 April, continued concerns about the lack of proper defensive lines, personnel, ammunition, and equipment to continue to defend Semenivka and other nearby villages was brought up by deputy commander of the 3rd Assault Brigade Maksym Zhorin and Ukrainian soldiers reporting to CNN, respectively.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of villages in Donetsk Oblast\n\n\n== References ==",

It was written by Lope, Mross, and Summoning Salt, the latter of which also narrated the documentary.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nThe documentary is split up into three main parts, first introducing Summoning Salt and then focusing on classic Mario games such as Super Mario Bros. and Super Mario Bros 3. It then covers the legacy and history of Games Done Quick and its charitable impact on the world and how it fosters the growth of professional careers for featured speedrunners, many of whom earn on a living from streaming on Twitch. It also covers the Nintendo World Championships and other speedrunning competitions, including Kaizo competitions.\nThe documentary mostly focuses on Nintendo classics from the 1980s and 1990s, including Super Mario 64, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Punch-Out!!, and Super Metroid, amongst others. Notable speedrunners featured in the documentary include Allan \"Cheese\" Alvarez, David \"GrandPooBear\" Hunt, and Narcissa Wright.\n\n\n== Critical response ==\nWriting for techraptor.net, Andrew Stretch wrote, \"[Running with Speed takes] the time to set up what Speedrunning is at the start, giving viewers a working foundation of knowledge before diving deep enough into Speedrunning to explain how pixel-perfect jumps and sequence breaking are so important to get the best possible times while speedrunning games like Super Mario Bros. 3 or Super Metroid. Whether you're brand new to Speedrunning or have been tuning in to AGDQ for years[,] chances are this documentary will have something new for you to learn.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

He is shocked to discover that Muddy Mudskipper is an abrasive misanthrope who berates everyone. Stimpy shows Mr. Horse the virtues of using Nitty Gritty kitty litter. Ren watches TV to keep his mind off the absence of Stimpy, but sees his face everyone. Ren descends into madness. Stimpy finds uncomfortable in Hollywood and returns to live with Ren in their trailer park. Ren is first happy to see Stimpy back, but is furious when he learns that Stimpy has given all of his $47 million in prize money.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRen-voice of John Kricfalusi\nStimpy-voice of Billy West\nMuddy Mudskipper-voice of Harris Peet\nPool babe-voice of Cheryl Chase\nTV announcer-voice of Darrin Sargent\nTV Announcer-voice of Jim Smith\nPillow-voice of Vincent Waller.\n\n\n== Production ==\nOriginally, the story of the first episode was intended to be one story, but it was decided to split the story into two parts to properly tell the story. Bob Camp stated: \"There was so much we wanted to do with the story, we had trouble packing it into one eleven-minute cartoon. It was actually easier to stretch it out than to compass it\". The couple of John Kricfalusi and Lynne Naylor set the story in the 1950s as a reference to the world of their youth. In what became a recurring feature of The Ren & Stimpy Show, Kricfalusi first introduced in The Big Shot! the scatological humor that was to play such a central role for the rest of the show. Much of the plot revolves kitty litter, and the story of The Big Shot! makes no effort to hide what is the purpose of kitty litter. The work of inking and painting both Stimpy's Big Day and The Big Shot! was done at the Lacewood studio in Ottawa. The Lacewood studio  had very poorly paid cartoonists, and the American journalist Thad Komorowski wrote that the animation done by the Lacewood studio was inept. Komorowski wrote in both Stimpy's Big Day and The Big Shot! that: \"The drawing is occasionally poor, the animation mostly rigid and the cleanup and ink-and-paint work is absolutely atrocious\".\n\n\n== References ==\nKomorowski wrote that The Big Shot! was \"an entertaining start to the series\" and awarded the episode three stars out of five.\n\n\n== Books ==\nDobbs, G.

Recognized for his unwavering loyalty to Spain, he was granted the encomienda of Oton in the island of Panay.\n\nDuring his extensive travels across the archipelago, Miguel de Loarca documented the diverse beliefs and customs of the pre-Hispanic Filipinos. His writings provide valuable insights into the cultural practices, social structures, and religious beliefs of the indigenous communities that inhabited the islands before the arrival of the Spanish colonizers.\nThrough his observations and writings, Miguel de Loarca contributed to the early ethnographic studies of the Philippines, shedding light on the rich and varied traditions of the indigenous peoples. His accounts serve as a crucial historical resource for understanding the complex  pre-hispanic cultures that existed in the Philippines.\nOverall, his documentation of the beliefs and customs of pre-Hispanic Filipinos offers a glimpse into the vibrant and diverse heritage of the indigenous populations, enriching our understanding of the historical and cultural landscape of the Philippines during that era.",

        "content": "The Chao Phraya Express Boat Orange Flag It is a popular express passenger boat for the working population. In urgent time The Orange Flag Chao Phraya Express Boat Orange flag will be another commute to work option for people in Bangkok. To reduce traffic problems and at all times, tourists often use the Chao Phraya Express Boat Orange flag. in tourism See the scenery of the Chao Phraya River as well.\n\n\n== Boats ==\nChao Phraya Express boats Orange Flag operates mainly two types of boats; all of them are built mainly out of wood.\nSingle-screw boat: They are able to hold around 90-120 passengers at a time and are around 26–32 m (85–105 ft) long and about 2.7 m (8 ft 10 in) wide. The area on the back of the boat (floor painted yellow) is normally restricted to embarking and disembarking passengers, but some people like to stand there when the boat is highly crowded. There are two 2-step stairs on each side of the boat connecting the yellow pad on the back to the passenger area inside the boat, while in between those stairs is a non-functioning on-board toilet. The engine room, in the appearance of a large wooden box, is inboard in the center line of the boat in front of the seating area. There are two rows of seats on the left and another two on the right and an aisle passing in the middle. On the newer boats, the roof from over the engine room to the middle section of the boat is raised for extra headroom because most standing passengers on crowded boats are standing there. This design has been applied to all other boats that are being built in the company's shipyards in Bangkok and Ayutthaya. These type of boats operate on all non-flagged, orange-flagged and green-yellow-flagged boats, but also off-peak direction trips of yellow-flagged boats. The fleet has about 50 boats of this type.\nTwin-screw boat or \"super size\" boat: This type of boat holds around 120 to 180 passengers. Unlike the single-screw boat, the boat driver sits in a small pod above the passenger deck, similar to a cockpit on board a Boeing 747 airliner, giving view for passenger in the front-most row and public access to the boat's front deck for passengers who desire to watch the view from the boat's front without any obstruction (except for the Thai national flag). It is about 30–40 m (98–131 ft) long and about 5–7 m (16–23 ft) wide. Unlike a single-screw boat, its seating area stretches over the entire boat, while most seating is in front of engines. The engine rooms are placed lower than those in single-screw boats, and some passengers prefer to sit on them when it is crowded. There are 8 seats behind each engine. There are two aisles in the seating area in front of the engines and 3 aisles behind the engines. There are two toilets, one on the port and another one on the starboard, located in front of the engines. This type of boat serves as yellow flagged express boat in peak hours, and serves as tourist boats in off-peak hours. The fleet has about 15 boats of this type.\n\n\n== Routes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nChao Phraya Express Boat site\nChao Phraya Express at TransitBangkok.com\nMap of Chao Phraya Express, Khlong boats, BTS, and MRT\nThe Mass Transport Boats of Bangkok (Chao Phraya Express) (Photos)\nMarineLink.com review\nChaopraya express boat Guide",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "The Women is a historical fiction novel by American author Kristin Hannah published by St. Martin's Press in 2024. The book tells the story of Frances \"Frankie\" McGrath, a young nurse who serves in the United States Army Nurse Corps during the Vietnam War. The novel debuted at number one on The New York Times fiction best-seller list.\n\n\n== Background and inspiration ==\nHannah first came up with the idea for the novel 20 years prior to its publication. The story centered on a nurse and was initially a love story. She would occasionally revisit the project only put it aside again. She began to work on it in early 2020, shortly after completing her novel The Four Winds. It was developed during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic while she was confined to her home on a small island outside Seattle.\n\nThe book was inspired by Hannah's experience growing up during the war era, which she says \"cast a huge shadow across [her] life\". She was influenced by the public protests, marches, and social division about the war at the time as well as the later treatment of veterans upon returning home. In an interview with LibraryThing, Hannah commented: For years, I wanted to write about the turbulence and chaos and division of the times, but it wasn't until the pandemic, when I was on lockdown in Seattle, confined to my home essentially, and watching our nurses and doctors serving on the front lines of the pandemic, becoming exhausted amid the political division of the time that it all came together for me. That's when I knew I was ready to write about the women who served in the war and were forgotten at home.\nHannah also spoke about wearing a silver prisoner of war bracelet when she was about 10 years old, one which commemorated her close friend's father who had been shot down as pilot in the war. Her friend's father never returned home, and she wore the bracelet for many years, and as a result \"was reminded of him and his service and war each day.\" In the book, after attending a march by Vietnam Veterans Against the War in Washington, D.C., Frankie encounters two volunteers for the National League of POW/MIA Families, from whom she buys a silver cuff bracelet on which the name of a missing soldier and the date of his disappearance are engraved: \"Maj. Robert Welch 1-16-1967.\"\nIn her research, Hannah read several memoirs by nurses who served in Vietnam, many of whom experienced difficulty adjusting to civilian life and were afflicted with post-traumatic stress disorder.\nHannah chose Frankie to be the novel's central character, as opposed to fellow combat nurses Ethel or Barb, partly due to Frankie's naivete and Southern California origin, which Hannah felt she could empathize with due to her own upbringing in Garden Grove, California.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe novel debuted at number one on The New York Times fiction best-seller list for the week ending February 10, 2024. As of the week ending March 30, 2024, the novel has spent 8 consecutive weeks atop the list.\nKirkus Reviews assessed the novel as a \"dramatic, vividly detailed reconstruction of a little-known aspect of the Vietnam War.\" In her review in the The New York Times Book Review, Beatriz Williams wrote, \"Hannah takes up the Vietnam epic and re-centers the story on the experience of women ... Hannah is in top form here, plunging the reader into the chaotic miseries of the combat zone. She deploys details to visceral effect.\" Alice Cary of BookPage wrote that \"Hannah demonstrates her knack for blending broad sweeps of history with page-turning plots to immediately engross legions of readers in even the most difficult of subjects.\"\nIn her review for The Boston Globe, Meredith Maran panned the novel for resorting to cliché and criticized Hannah for \"underestimating her readers\", concluding, \"Cut by half, edited to delete the predictable, the \"matronizing,\" and the obvious, The Women would have been an even stronger contribution to Hannah's body of work, and to her millions of fans' understanding of American history.\"\n\n\n== Film adaptation ==\nIn January 2024, Warner Bros. preemptively acquired the screen rights to The Women for a film adaptation.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Moses Tjalkabota, also known as Moses Tjalkabota Uraikuria or Blind Moses (c.1869 - 6 July 1954) was a Western Arrernte man and Aboriginal evangelist who was born at Laprapuntja (Ellery Creek), east of Hermannsburg (Ntaria).\nIn the course of his work he came to be known as \"Central Australia's most gifted evangelist\" and it is said that he was a master storyteller and he attracted large crowds when he preached.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nTjalkabota was the fourth of five children born to Tjita and Aranaljika and his name, Tjalkabota, translates as 'best juiciest piece of meat' in Western Arrernte. On Christmas Day in 1890, when his age was stated to be 12, he was baptised and chose the name Mose; this is the German form of Moses. It is believed that he was older than 12 for, as recorded by Paul Albrecht (the Superintendent of the Finke River Mission) as he held clear recollections of the Irpmankara massacre in around 1875; this is also known as the Massacre of Running Waters.\nIn his early life Tjalkabota followed the traditional nomadic patters of his people and, when first meeting with white men, when he saw them in his country in July 1876, he recalled:\n\nWe thought that the white men were black men who had died, and then returned as spirits to the place where they had died long ago. First up, we went to the hills, afraid. We stayed there in the hills and made camp.\nIn June 1877 Tjalkabota and his family met for the first time with the German missionaries who had newly arrived at Hermannsburg and his father, Tjita, performed some early translation work for them in exchange for food and clothes; his father called clothing \"different skin\". Tjalkabota parents were first resistant to the missionaries wanting Tjalkabota, and his siblings, to attend school but relented and they began attending classes. As a part of these classes he was taught the Christian faith and he was immediately interested; the first song he learned was perhaps the only translated hymn at that time called Jesuai, nauna pitjai [Jesus come to us]. Tjita did not approve of this and took him away from the school and they returned to Laprapuntja.\nWithout his father's permission Tjalkabota later returned to school and soon became a Christian. While living there he worked in the garden and as a shepherd and in 1891, after his parents returned to Laprapuntja, he remained there. In 1903 he married Sofia (Sophie) Ingkamala, an Arrernte woman. He also began assisting Carl Strehlow with his translation of the New Testament and many hymns into Western Arrernte and he did so for many years. He said of this work:\n\nWe taught [Mr Strehlow] word the old men had not put down - kaiaka (blameless) and aratjantataka (righteousness) and aluaka ilknama (to shed or sprinkle blood) ... During the day we worked outside and Mr Strehlow taught in the school. Then in the evening we came to him to write down these words,\nIn 1905, following suffering from heat stroke, he became blind and began to work as a catechist and lay preacher at the mission. After the death of Carl Strehlow Tjalkabota assisted the newly arrived FW Albrecht in translating and reading his sermons for him until he learned enough Western Arrernte to do so himself.\nThis was, until, on a visit to Horseshoe Bend Station he was persuaded to stay and act as an evangelist. This became a regular occurrence and Tjalkabota would travel regularly to minister to Aboriginal people (mostly Arrernte people) throughout the region. He travelled by donkey, camel, buggy, on foot and even occasionally on the back of a truck; he is best remembered for his use of the donkey. He visited places such as Arltunga, Deep Well Station, Jay Creek, Undoolya Station and Alice Springs.\nA large part of Tjalkabota's message to other Aboriginal people was to place their trust in Jesus and give up their tjurunga (sacred objects) and this message was oftentimes met with rejection. It is said that his catch-phrase was 'Churinga [tjurunga] or Christ?'.\nFrom April 1932 he also assisted Ted Strehlow in his anthropological work; Ted Strehlow drew on his knowledge of both Arrernte and Luritja to compare the names of totem plants and animals in both languages and also for his knowledge of tribal boundaries and matters relating to tjurunga. Ted Strehlow was also particularly interested in Rain Dreaming songs associated with the nearby Kaporilja Springs [see: Kuprilya Springs Pipeline].\nIn the 1940s, until his death in 1954, he worked as a preacher, in charge of a small church, and teacher to children at Jay Creek.\nOn his death Paul Albrecht said of him:\n\nA man with the knowledge and character of Moses cannot be re-placed, but what he brought as a blessing to his people will live onHis funeral was held at Hermannsburg and it is said that \"most of the western group\" of Arrernte people attended.\n\n\n== Resources about ==\nLatz, P.

        "content": "American Hegemony and the Postwar Reconstruction of Science in Europe is a book by John Krige published in 2008 by MIT Press.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nThe book explores how the United States exerted influence over scientific practices and institutions in Western Europe after World War II. Krige argues that influential American figures collaborated with local elites to promote American scientific, technological, and Cold War agendas in Europe. Through case studies, Krige demonstrates how key individuals and organizations, such as the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations, NATO Science Committee, and prominent scientists like Isidor I. Rabi and Vannevar Bush, attempted to Americanize scientific fields like physics, molecular biology, and operations research. The book highlights efforts to support European scientific institutions like CERN, the Niels Bohr Institute, and the French CNRS.\n\n\n== Reviews ==\nJacob Darwin Hamblin stressed Krige's focus on the American influence on European science post-World War II. He commended the author for elucidating how American institutions shaped European scientific practices and values, particularly in the context of the Cold War. Hamblin also highlighted Krige's adept exploration of the role of philanthropic organizations like the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations in promoting American scientific ideals abroad.\nGiles Scott-Smith lauded Krige for the book's theoretical depth and analytical precision. Scott-Smith praised the author's examination of how US hegemony shaped scientific endeavors in Europe after World War II, emphasizing the collaborative nature of this hegemony and its impact on institutions like CERN and CNRS. The reviewer also underscored the book's exploration of both self-interest and general interest driving American efforts to reshape European socio-economic landscapes, while acknowledging the complexities and challenges inherent in imposing a US blueprint on European institutions.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Coo-ee; Or, Wild Days in the Bush is a 1906 Australian play by Edward William O'Sullivan. It was originally performed by Edward Irham Cole's Bohemian Dramatic Company. \nThe play was specifically devised as a piece of broad appeal popular theatre. \nThe play helped develop the concept of the \"bush heroine\" in Australian culture.\nO'Sullivan later accused the writers of the popular 1907 melodrama The Squatter's Daughter of copying his play.\nThe Sydney Morning Herald declared \"As a melodrama \"Cooee\" is far ahead of many more ambitiously-staged productions, but it is reminiscent of some of them.\"\nThe Sydney Sportsman said the play \"possesses many of the good points of kindred productions, and few of their bad ones, and was voted a complete success by the intensely interested audience.\"\nThe Daily Telegraph said the play \"has been carefully thought out and worked upon such lines as will point a moral, through somewhat murky atmosphere albeit, but a moral just the same.\"\nAnother review said \"his play chiefly fails through its dramatic pudding being so full of sensational plums that each is passed over too quickly to be appreciated by the palate. If two or three speeches were abbreviated, some of the incidents eliminated, and the remainder more fully developed and properly led up to, this would be a very effective play. But the Hippodrome's audiences fairly revel in it, and the curtain goes down nightly on a chorus of Coo-ees, issuing from 1000 throats.\"\n\n\n== Premise ==\nJack Bailey is in love with Eva Braddon. The villain, Rupert Seymour, is in cahoots with Ben Hall, the Clarks, and other notorious bushrangers. Seymour forces Eva's father to consent to marriage with his daughter until stopped by Bailey with the assistance of a faithful black, Nardoo.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Celatoblatta quinquemaculata, the Otago alpine cockroach, is a species of blattid cockroach endemic to New Zealand.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nCelatoblatta quinquemaculata was described in 1966 by entomologist Peter Johns in his revision of the New Zealand cockroaches. Its name quinquemaculata refers to the five distinctive spots on its thorax. The holotype in Canterbury Museum was collected in 1964 in the Old Man Range, Central Otago between 1,300 m (4,200 ft) and 1,400 m (4,700 ft). The Otago alpine cockroach is sister to the subalpine Canterbury species Celatoblatta anisoptera.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThis species is from 13 to 15 mm long, wingless, and dark brown in colour except for distinctive pale brown patches. The pronotum of the thorax has a single pale brown patch with a darker stripe down the middle (so it resembles two patches), and the mesonotum and metanotum each have two pale brown patches, making five in all. The thorax and upper abdomen also have pale brown margins, as do parts of the insect's head (frons, clypeus, and labrum). Adults have small tegmina separated by more than half the mesonatal width.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nFound only in New Zealand, this species is restricted to the alpine zone of mountains in Central Otago. It has been recorded from the Old Man Range, Rock and Pillar Range, the Routeburn Valley, Lake Mackenzie, and in Fiordland National Park. It occurs above 1,300 m (4,300 ft) and is common at an altitude of 1,500 m (4,900 ft).\n\n\n== Habitat and resistance to freezing ==\nLiving under slabs of schist in an alpine and subalpine habitat, C. quinquemaculata is regularly exposed to temperatures below freezing. At anytime of the year this cockroach can survive freezing solid, and during the winter probably freezes and thaws more than 20 times a month. It has moderate freeze tolerance: its body water freezes at −4.2 °C in the autumn and −3.4 °C in the winter, and it can survive up to 4 days frozen at −5 °C, but dies at about −9 °C.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nCelatoblatta quinquemaculata discussed on RNZ Critter of the Week, 5 April 2024",

I announce that today we are going to suspend our campaign and in the next few hours we will give an official position. My condolences and quick resignation to his family and friends. Rest in peace,” she wrote via X, formerly Twitter.\nSubsequently, PAN member Libya Dennise condemned “the cunning” crime, so she did not hesitate to send her condolences to the family, friends, and colleagues of Gaytán, 37 years old.\nAfter the murder of the candidate, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador regretted the murder and sent his condolences to family and friends.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "A thermophone is a type of transducer that converts an electrical singal into heat, which then becomes sound. It can be thought of as a type of loudspeaker that uses heat fluctuations to produce sound, instead of mecahnical vibration.\nThe basic principle of the thermophone has been known since the 19th century. Thermophones have been used to calibrate acoustical apparatus (like microphones) since the 20th century. In recent years, the name thermoacoustic speaker has also been used.\n\n\n== Beginnings ==\n\nThermoacoustics is the study of the interaction between heat and sound. It a basis of the thermophone. Byron Higgins in 1802 reported \"singing flames\" which occurred when the necks of jars were put over a hydrogen gas flame. Sondhauss (1850) and Rijke (1859) performed further experiments. A theory of thermoacoustics was produced by Lord Rayleigh in 1878.\nThe theory and practice of creating sound with electric heat emerged in the late 19th century. In 1880, William Henry Preece observed that, upon connecting a microphone transmitter to a platinum wire, sounds were produced:\n\n...the sonorous effects were most marked and encouraging, when the microphone transmitter M was spoken into. The articluation, though muffled, was clear, and words could easily be heard. In 1917, Harold D. Arnold and Irving B. Crandall of Bell Labs developed a quantitative theory for the thermophone. Since then, thermophones have been used as a precision device for microphone calibration. However, they did not see widespread use elsewhere due to their poor efficiency.\n\n\n== Description ==\nWhen alternating current is passed through a thin conductor, that conductor periodically heats up and cools down following the variations in current strength. This periodic heating and cooling creates temperature waves which the conductor propagates into the surroundings. As the temperature waves propagate away from the conductor, the thermal expansion and contraction of the transmission medium (e.g. air) produces corresponding sound waves. \nAn ideal thermophone is made of a conductor which is very thin and has a small heat capacity.\n\n\n== Modern thermophones ==\nIn 1999, Shinouda and others presented a porous doped sillicon thermophone for ultrasonic emission. In 2008, Xiao et al. reported a thermophone made of carbon nanotubes. Since then, there has been a resurgence of research into thermophones and thermoacoustics. New materials for thermophones are being explored, and thermophones have been created using VLSI processes (like integrated circuits are).\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "William Bryson (1730 – 6 May 1815) was an Irish Presbyterian minister.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBryson was said to have come of a Donegal family, became minister of the nonsubscribing congregation at Antrim in August 1764. Without the pulpit reputation of his cousin James, he was a man of more influence in matters theological. He adopted Arian Christology and rejected the tenets of original sin and imputed righteousness. The ground he took was that of a strong scripturalist, and he upheld sabbath observance, eternal punishments, and Satanic agency. Bryson, though a member of the outcast Antrim presbytery, was, as his manuscripts show, a frequent preacher in neighbouring congregations of the general synod. His first publication was a funeral discourse for a distinguished minister of the synod. At the time of the rebellion in 1798 Bryson was a staunch loyalist, in this, as in other matters, following the lead of his co-presbyter, Bruce of Belfast. In September 1809 his age and infirmities rendered him desirous of resigning his pastorate, but as his people could not agree upon a successor, he did not do so till November 1810. He died on 6 May 1815, in his eighty-sixth year. He is said to have been buried at Antrim, but his name is not on the family tombstone. In the vestry of the First Presbyterian Church, Belfast, hangs a likeness of Bryson, copied by his son Patrick from a silhouette taken in his forty-sixth year. When about that age he married a daughter of Alexander Maclaine, M.A., minister at Antrim, 1742-59, and granddaughter of John Abernethy, by whom he had six children. His daughters kept school at Antrim for many years.\nBryson published:\n\n‘The Practice of Righteousness, productive of happiness both at present and for ever,’ Belfast, 1782, 8vo (funeral sermon, Isaiah xxxii. 17, at Crumlin, 28 July, for Thomas Crawford, ordained at Crumlin, 1723, or early in 1724).\n‘The Duty of Searching the Scriptures.' &c., Belfast, 1786, 8vo (sermon, John v. 39, at ordination in Ballyclare, 9 Feb. 1786, of Futt Marshall, died 23 Oct. 1813, aged 58).\n‘Funeral Sermon for Rev. Robert Sinclair of Larne’ (said to have been published, but not known; Sinclair died on 20 Feb. 1795, aged 70).\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Gordon, Alexander (1886). \"Bryson, William\".

        "content": "William Campbell (died 17 November 1805) was an Irish Presbyterian minister.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nCampbell was the son of Robert Campbell, merchant, of Newry. In 1819 it is said that there were about fifteen hundred living descendants of his grandmother, who died in 1727. Campbell was educated at Glasgow, where he matriculated in November 1744, and was licensed by Armagh presbytery in 1750. He became tutor in the Bagwell family of Clonmel, and in this capacity spent seven years in France. He got into prison in Paris, through refusing to genuflect while the host was passing. Returning to Ireland in 1758 he married his cousin, Jane Carlile of Newry, and in 1759 was ordained minister of the non-subscribing presbyterians at Antrim. In November 1764 he became minister of First Armagh, in connection with the general synod, his successor at Antrim being William Bryson. He was moderator of synod in 1773 at Lurgan. In 1782 the rule of 1705, requiring subscription before ordination, was practically repealed on his motion. An unpublished pamphlet, addressed to Hussey Burgh in the same year, proposed a scheme for a northern university which, though considered by several governments, ultimately failed through Henry Grattan's disapproval. In 1783 he exerted himself to procure an addition to the regium donum (then yielding only 9l. a year to each minister), and obtained an increase of 1,000l. a year to the grant. But the influence of Lord Hillsborough went strongly against the general synod, for political reasons; by his advice a grant of regium donum (500l. a year) was for the first time given to the secession church. However, the synod acknowledged Campbell's efforts by a presentation of plate in 1784. His alma mater gave him the degree of D.D. in the same year. In 1786 he entered into controversy with Richard Woodward, bishop of Cloyne, who had maintained that none but episcopalians could be loyal to the constitution. Woodward answered Campbell, omitting to answer a stronger attack by Samuel Barber. Campbell wrote against the reply with calmness and learning. Meanwhile, his eyesight had failed, and he was nearly blind. He had earned the gratitude of his denomination, but was paid this time only with addresses of congratulation. Applying in 1788 for the post of synod's agent for the regium donum, he was defeated by a large majority in favour of Robert Black. Campbell, much mortified, determined to leave the north of Ireland. On 14 September 1789 he resigned Armagh, and spent the remainder of his days in charge of the small flock at Clonmel, Tipperary. He is said to have shone more in conversation than in the pulpit, and to have possessed much scientific knowledge and a remarkable memory. He was probably an Arian, certainly a strong opponent of subscription. He died on 17 November 1805, leaving three surviving children out of a family of eleven. His successor at Clonmel was James Worrall. Campbell published: \n\n‘The Presence of Christ with his church,’ &c., Belfast, 1774, 8vo (synodical sermon at Antrim on 28 June, from Matt. xxviii. 20).\n‘A Vindication of the Principles and Character of the Presbyterians in Ireland; addressed to the Bishop of Cloyne,’ &c., Dublin, 1787, 12mo (four editions).\n‘An Examination of the Bishop of Cloyne's Defence,’ &c. Belfast, 1788, 12mo. He left a manuscript history of presbyterianism in Ireland of some value. It refers for further particulars to other manuscripts not preserved.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Gordon, Alexander (1886). \"Campbell, William\".

        "content": "The Kuwaiti political gridlock, ongoing since 2020, is marked by a persistent standoff between the appointed cabinet and the elected parliament in Kuwait. This crisis is set against a backdrop of successive internal succession crises within the ruling Al Sabah family, beginning with the death of Emir Sabah Al Ahmad in 2020. Leadership transitioned to his half-brother Nawaf, who died in 2023, subsequently elevating Mishal Al Sabah to the role of emir. Mishal, the last surviving member of his generation and son of Ahmad Al Jaber Al-Sabah, has yet to appoint a successor. \nUnder the constitution, the emir appoints the prime minister, with members of the Al Sabah family traditionally holding key cabinet portfolios, including the prime ministership. Additionally, the emir appoints the crown prince, who must receive approval from at least 50% of the elected parliamentarians. This entrenched practice has fueled the political stalemate, as next-generation succession candidates use populist strategies to gain parliamentary support for their bids for the emirate. These tactics frequently involve the selective prosecution of rivals on corruption charges and sweeping personnel changes across government levels to forge alliances within both the ruling family and the parliament. \nThis ongoing crisis has significantly impacted Kuwait’s political landscape, resulting in the appointment of four different prime ministers, the dissolution of parliament three times, the annulment of one parliamentary session, and the formation of ten different cabinets over three years.\n\n\n== Ruling family succession feud ==\nArticle 4 of the Kuwaiti Constitution mandates that the nomination of a crown prince by the emir must receive approval from over 50% of the parliament, a requirement that has brought internal disputes into the public and parliamentary sphere, moving beyond mere palace intrigue. Kuwaiti political scientist Mohammed Alwuhaib contends that members of the Al Sabah family have engaged in the manipulation of political and economic factions to undermine one another, with rival sheikhs frequently employing accusations of corruption as a strategy.\n\n\n=== Nasser Al-Mohammed and Ahmad Al-Fahad feud ===\nBeginning in late 2010, parliamentarians supportive of Prime Minister Sheikh Nasser Al-Mohamed initiated criticisms against Sheikh Ahmad Al Fahad. In November of that year, MP Adel Al-Saraawi charged Sheikh Ahmad in the Kuwaiti parliament with creating an unauthorized, shadow government within Kuwait. The situation was intensified by the appointment of his brother, Sheikh Athbi Al-Fahad Al-Sabah, as the head of the Kuwait State Security apparatus, suggesting Sheikh Ahmad had influence beyond his designated governmental duties.  By March 2011, MPs Marzouq Al-Ghanim and Adel Al-Saraawi proposed an inquiry into Sheikh Ahmad, at that time the deputy prime minister, concerning alleged mismanagement of government contracts. These developments resulted in Sheikh Ahmad's resignation from his government positions by June 2011.\nIn August 2011, allies of Ahmad Al-Fahad unearthed documents implicating as many as one-third of the members of parliament in what swiftly emerged as the most significant political corruption scandal in Kuwait's history. By October of the same year, allegations had surfaced against 16 MPs, accusing them of accepting payments totaling $350 million in exchange for their backing of government policies.\nAlso in October 2011, MP Musallam Al-Barrack, an ally of Ahmad Al-Fahad, claimed that significant sums of Kuwaiti dinars had been funneled from Kuwait's Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the foreign bank accounts of Prime Minister Nasser Al-Mohammed. This accusation prompted the resignation of the Foreign Minister, Dr. Mohammed Al-Sabah, the last representative of the Al-Salem branch within the Sabah family, as a form of protest. Nasser Al-Mohammed refuted these claims, asserting that \"all transfers were conducted in the interests of Kuwait without any personal gain.\" He was later cleared of these allegations by a special judicial tribunal in Kuwait.\n\n\n=== Resignation of Nasser Al-Mohammed and Appointment of Jaber Al-Mubarak as Prime Minister ===\nLarge-scale political demonstrations in November 2011 prompted Emir Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah to accept the resignation of Nasser Al-Mohammed on November 28, 2011. Following this, he appointed the then-outgoing Defense Minister, Sheikh Jaber Al-Mubarak, as Prime Minister.\n\n\n==== Fake Coup video and Ahmad Al-Fahad fraud conviction ====\nIn December 2013, supporters of Ahmad Al-Fahad asserted they had tapes allegedly showing Nasser Al-Mohammed and former Parliament Speaker Jassem Al-Kharafi planning to overthrow the Kuwaiti government. This incident came to be known as the Kuwait Complaint (Arabic: بلاغ الكويت). Ahmad Al-Fahad discussed these allegations on Al-Watan TV.\nIn response to these allegations, the Kuwaiti public prosecutor initiated an investigation in April 2014, enforcing a comprehensive media blackout to prevent any discussion or reporting on the matter. To persuade the public prosecutor of the tapes' authenticity, Ahmad Al-Fahad and his associates orchestrated a fake legal confrontation in Switzerland. This involved backdating documents and using a Delaware-based shell company they controlled. This sham arbitration, later exposed as fraudulent in Swiss courts, was submitted to the High Court in London to assist in validating the tapes.\nBy March 2015, the Kuwaiti public prosecutor had ceased all inquiries into the alleged coup attempt, and Ahmad Al-Fahad publicly withdrew his accusations on Kuwait state television. Simultaneously, Athbi Al-Fahad, Ahmad's brother and former head of state security, along with associates known as the \"Fintas Group,\" embarked on a campaign of misinformation. They produced and circulated a low-quality video falsely showing the head of the constitutional court accepting a bribe, suggesting this influenced the public prosecutor's decision to halt the investigation. Subsequently, Athbi Al-Fahad and the Fintas Group members were legally prosecuted and found guilty for their involvement in these acts.\nIn November 2018, Ahmed and four co-defendants were charged in Switzerland with forgery connected to their involvement in fabricating an arbitration in Switzerland to validate their spurious video alleging a coup plot. This action followed a criminal complaint filed by the legal representatives of Nasser Al-Mohammad and Jassem Al-Kharafi.\nSheikh Ahmed was convicted of forgery on September 10, 2021, alongside the four other individuals involved, receiving a sentence of 30 months in prison, with half of the sentence suspended.\n\n\n=== Appointment of Sabah Al-Khaled as Prime Minister ===\nIn November 2019, Sheikh Khaled Al Jarrah Al Sabah, the former Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior of Kuwait, was removed from his position following allegations by Nasser Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, the Minister of Defense. The allegations were presented to the Kuwaiti Attorney General, accusing the Prime Minister Sheikh Jaber Al-Mubarak and the Defense Minister Sheikh Khaled of embezzling 240 million Kuwaiti dinars (approximately $794.5 million) from government funds during his tenure as Minister of Defense. Sheikh Jaber Al Mubarak resigned as Prime Minister, but upon reappointment by the emir, he declined the position, stating his desire to first clear his name in court. The Emir Following this, Emir Sabah appointed the then-outgoing Foreign Minister, Sheikh Sabah Al-Khaled, as Prime Minister.\n\n\n== Parliamentary politics ==\n\n\n=== Modification of the electoral system and opposition boycott ===\nOn 21 June 2012, the Constitutional Court annulled the opposition-majority parliamentary session elected in February 2012. Sunsequently, Emir Sabah Al-Ahmad issued a decree modifying the voting system for Kuwaiti citizens from four non-transferable votes to a single non-transferable vote. This adjustment led to the opposition boycotting the December 2012 and 2013 parliamentary elections.\n\n\n=== Populist opposition to economic reform ===\nUnder the speakership of Marzouq Al-Ghanim, the 14th and 15th sessions passed some unpopular laws. In June 2016, parliament passed a lèse-majesté law that banned citizens who defamed the dignity of the emir from running in elections. This law disqualified multiple opposition members like Musallam Al-Barrak and Bader Al-Dahoum from running for office. In August 2016, as part of economic reforms aimed at countering falling oil revenues, parliament approved a bill that increased heavily subsidised gasoline prices, some of the lowest globally, by 40-80%. This marked the first time gas prices were raised in 50 years.\n\n\n=== Sabah Al-Khaled Premiership (December 2020 to June 2022) ===\nIn the December 2020 parliamentary election,  two-thirds of the incumbents lost their seats. On December 11, 40 MPs jointly announced their intention to vote for Bader Al-Humaidi to replace Marzouq Al-Ghanim as speaker of parliament.\n\n\n==== Al-Khalid’s government elects Al-Ghanim ====\nOn December 15, the opening session of 2020, Marzouq Al-Ghanim was elected as speaker of parliament with 33 votes including 16 government members against Al-Humaidi’s 28. Al-Ghanim’s election led to discontent between the elected MPs leading to a request to interpolate Al-Khalid as head of government. The  was interpolation requested by MPs Al-Dahoum, Al-Suwait, and Al-Otaibi. Al-Suwait stated that Sabah Al-Khalid put forward his interests instead of the interests of the people. After the interrogation, a no-confidence motion was passed with support from 31 MPs. On 18 January 2021, Sabah Al-Khalid’s government resigned after staying in office for one month and four days.\n\n\n==== The Opposition rejects to cooperate with Al-Khalid ====\nOn 2 March, Al-Khalid appointed his new cabinet. On 31 March, Al-Khalid’s government took oath in session which saw the boycott of opposition members leading to an attendance of 33 members, 16 of whom were Al-Khalid and his ministers, out of 65 members. Al-Khalid requested that all of his current and future interrogations should be delayed till after the end of the second parliamentary session. Which was agreed by the attending MPs. The session also saw the announcement of the vacancy of Bader Al-Dahoum’s seat in parliament, the announcement being the main reason for the opposition’s boycott.\nOn 13 April, opposition members pushed a motion calling for the cancellation of the postponement of Al-Khalid’s interrogations. The motion was rejected by 33 members of the attending 60. During voting, chaos occurred after opposition members went to the podium to protest the rejection. Mohammed Al-Mutair brought a megaphone with him and started shouting “This request shouldn’t pass!” while Saleh Al-Shallahi tried to take polling paper from the secretary-general. On 28 April, opposition members sat on the government ministers’ designated seats in parliament demanding that Al-Khalid should go to the “interrogation podium”. This action led the government to boycott the session and therefore abandon it. On 25 May, opposition members continued to sit on the government seats continuing the government’s boycott.\n\n\n==== Al-Wasmi replaces Al-Dahoum’s annulled seat ====\nOn 8 June 2014, Bader Al-Dahoum was sentenced to one year and eight months in jail after insulting the emir Sabah Al-Ahmad. After Al-Dahoum was voted into office, the validity of candidacy was questioned by the Constitutional Court. On the 15th of May, the constitutional court annulled Al-Dahoum's candidacy after he violated the candidacy laws passed two years after his speech.\nOn 23 April, Obaid Al-Wasmi announced that he was going to run a by-election for Al-Dahoum’s annulled seat. Multiple opposition MPs welcomed Al-Wasmi’s announcement including Abdulkarim Al-Kanderi, Marzouq Al-Khalifa, and Bader Al-Dahoum himself. In the by-election held on May 21, Obaid Al-Wasmi got a historic 93% of the total votes amounting to 43,810 votes. Obaid’s number of votes broke Musallam Al-Barrak’s number in the February 2012 election of 31,263 votes.\n\n\n==== Kuwaiti National Dialogue ====\nThirteen days before the opening of the second session on October 26, Emir Nawaf Al-Ahmad invited opposition members and the government into a national dialogue in hopes that both branches would cooperate in the next session. On 8 October, the emir pardoned multiple opposition members who resided in Türkiye. Musllam Al-Barrak, Salem Al-Namlan, Jamaan Al-Harbash,  Faisal Al-Muslim, and others were all part of the emir’s pardon list. Controversially, the pardon also included twenty Kuwaiti citizens who were part of the Abdali Terrorist Cell case. A “cell” that was affiliated withHezbollah which stored weapons in the town of Abdali. On 24 October, Marzouq Al-Ghanim and Sabah Al-Khalid were appointed to a committee for future Amiri Pardons.\nOn 28 December, as part of the National Dialogue, Sabah Al-Khalid announced multiple MPs as part of his new cabinet. MPs that were part of the 39th cabinet are Essa Al-Kandari, Mohammed Al-Rajhi, Hamad Rouheddine, and Mubarak Al-Arou. The dialogue formed a permanent scar between opposition members who rejected cooperation between them and Al-Ghanim like Mohammed Al-Mutair and other members who cooperated with the dialogue efforts like Obaid Al-Wasmi.\n\n\n==== Al-Khalid’s fourth resignation ====\nAs part of the National Dialogue, the motion that all of Al-Khalid’s interrogations should be postponed was scrapped. On the 29th of March, 2022, Muhannad Al-Sayer, Muhalhal Al-Mudhaf, and Hassan Jawhar brought on a request to interrogate Sabah Al-Khalid. The interrogation turned into a no-confidence vote supported by 26 MPs leading to Al-Khalid’s resignation on April 5. After his government that lasted 99 days, Nawaf Al-Ahmad accepted his resignation on 10 May.\n\n\n==== The MPs’ Sit-in and the dissolution ====\nAs a protest against Al-Khalid’s delaying his government’s formation. On 15 June, 17 MPs organized a sit-in called “The House of the Nation Sit-in”. The members called for the return of political life in Kuwait which has been interrupted by the Sabah Al-Khalid delays.\nOn 22 June, Crown Prince Mishal Al-Ahmad announced his intention to dissolve parliament after rising tensions between both sides. Leading to the of end the sit-in on the same day.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Moaning is the debut studio album by Los Angeles band Moaning, released on 2 March 2018 by Sub Pop. The band wrote songs for the album several years prior to the release, with most of the debut being recorded and released following being signed to the label. Upon release, Moaning received generally favorable reviews, with critics praising the album's energy and fusion of genres, but expressed mixed views on the impact of the album's tone and lyrical themes, and the use of distortion and noise. \n\n\n== Background and recording ==\nFormed in 2015, Moaning began creating songs for a debut album prior to a record contract in a practice space in Echo Park, with three years between writing, recording and pre-production and release. Lead Sean Solomon stated that the sound of the album was influenced from attending the LA punk rock venue The Smell and bands including Abe Vigoda and No Age. The debut album was recorded and engineered over several months by City and Colour producer Alex Newport in Los Angeles. The album received a distribution contract from Sub Pop following the band's performance at SXSW. \n\n\n== Release and promotion ==\nA music video for The Same was released prior to the debut's announcement. Following announcement, music videos were released for Don't Go, directed by Michael Schmelling, Artificial, directed by A Stranger, Tired, filmed with the California Institute of the Arts and directed by Ambar Navarro, and Misheard, an animated music video evocative of \"1990s MTV adverts\" by Steve Smith.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nMoaning received \"generally favorable\" reviews from critics according to review aggregator Metacritic. Paul Simpson of Allmusic described the album as a \"powerful debut\" and \"alarmingly focused set of tense, bitter post-punk tunes\", highlighting the \"deep questions\" around relationships posed in Solomon's lyrics. Calling it a \"strikingly accomplished debut\", Cole Waterman of PopMatters commended the energy of the album's \"rolling instrumentation\" and \"immediate hooks\" as an appropriate dichotomy to the dour and \"direct derision\" of the lyrics, although noting it could sometimes \"veer toward juvenilia\". Similarly, Wilf Skimmer of Clash noted the \"high-energy songs\" and \"abrasive instrumentation\" surpassed the \"malaise\" of the lyrics and tone of the album hinted at by the song titles. Lisa Sookraj of Exclaim! considered the band's fusion of noise and shoegaze with post-punk and new wave managed to establish a distinctive sound. Peter Watts enjoyed the album's juxtaposition of \"ghostly vocals\" and evocation of a \"dark, endlessly sad hole of despair\" and \"sense of rage and helplesness\", but found at times the album could be \"pitiless\" and \"a lot to take\". Joe Goggins of DIY viewed the album to be a \"cohesive record\" with a \"lot of polish\", but considered it to be derivative of existing post punk bands including Preoccupations and \nWomen. Carl Purvis of No Ripcord considered that the album, in \"straddling the ridge that separates shoegaze from post-punk\", led the album to be \"suffocated by the sheer density of the walls of noise that Moaning are all to happy to build\". Similarly, Ben Lynch of The Line of Best Fit noted that in spite of the \"flashes of brilliance\", the album possessed a \"lack of dynamism\" and \"absence of ideas\", considering the lyrics to be \"lost amid the wall of noise\". \n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nSean Solomon – vocals, guitar\nPascal Stevenson – bass, synth\nAndrew MacKelvie – drums\nAlex Newport – producer\nDave Cerminara – engineer\nApril Golden – mastering\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "John Malcome (1662? – 17 May 1729) was a British Presbyterian polemic.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMalcome was probably a native of Scotland.\nHe was educated at Glasgow, where he graduated M.A. In December 1686 the presbyterian congregation of Killead, co. Antrim, was divided into upper and lower. Malcome was called to Lower Killead in June 1687, and ordained there on 5 December, hence his birth may be dated about 1662. Early in 1699 he was transferred to Dunmurry, co. Antrim, where an old malt-kiln was used as a meeting-house.\nIn 1703 the presbyterian clergy was divided on the question of the oath of abjuration. Malcome was strongly in favour of taking the oath, and attacked a neighbouring minister, Alexander McCracken (d. November 1730), who, though a staunch Hanoverian, had preached against the oath as sinful, and had retreated to Scotland to avoid it. The affair came before the general synod of Ulster in June 1704, when Malcome was rebuked and McCracken admonished.\nIn 1720 the non-subscription controversy broke out in Belfast in connection with the installation of Samuel Haliday. Malcome adhered to subscription, and was the inventor of the phrase ‘new light,’ which, in a criticism of John Abernethy, he applies to the position of the non-subscribers. It is observable, however, that he does not employ it in its present received sense, as denoting a new departure in theology. His point is that ‘a set of men, by preaching and printing, pretend to give new light to the world by putting personal persuasion in the room of a church government.’\nHe died at Dunmurry on 17 May 1729, and was buried there on 20 May. Reid speaks of him as ‘aged’ in 1720; but he must have been under seventy at the time of his death. He published: \n\n‘Personal Persuasion no Foundation for Religious Obedience … friendly Reflections on a Sermon … by … Abernethy,’ &c., Belfast, 1720,18mo.\n‘More Light … Remarks on the late Vindication … By a true lover of Presbyterian Principles,’ &c. [Belfast], 1721–2, 32mo (conjectured by Reid to be Malcome's).\n‘The Dangerous Principles … revived … by our Modern New Lights,’ &c., Belfast, 1726, 12mo. Letters by Malcome are printed in Thomas Gowan's ‘Power of Presbyters,’ 1711, 4to, and in. ‘Remarks on a Pamphlet … by … Tisdall,’ 1716, 4to, by Joseph Boyse\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Gordon, Alexander (1893). \"Malcome, John\".

        "content": "Andrew George Malcom (15 September 1782 – 12 January 1823) was an Irish Presbyterian minister and hymn-writer.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMalcom was born at Hill Hall House, co. Down, on 15 September 1782. He was the second son of James Malcolm (d. 3 October 1805), who was ordained minister of Drumbo, co. Down, on 24 December 1764, in succession to his uncle, Andrew Malcom (d. 2 March 1763). His mother was Fanny, third daughter of Andrew Kennedy, presbyterian minister of Mourne, co. Down. He was educated at Glasgow, where he graduated M.A. On 11 March 1807 he was ordained by Bangor presbytery as minister of Dunmurry, co. Antrim. He was not related to his predecessor at Dunmurry, John Malcome. He resigned Dunmurry on 11 September 1808, and was installed minister of first Newry, co. Down, on 14 March 1809. Through his mother he was the great-grandson of George Lang (d. 25 January 1702), the first presbyterian minister of Newry. His ministry at Newry was one of marked success, and his position as a leader of educational and charitable movements was highly influential. His theology was Arian, of an uncontroversial type. Early in 1820 he received the degree of D.D. from Glasgow. On 27 June 1820 he was elected moderator of the general synod of Ulster. On 28 June 1821 the general synod approved an exposition of the principles of presbyterianism from his pen, and ordered it to be prefixed as an introduction to their forthcoming code of discipline. This order was not carried out, the introduction being set aside in committee after Malcom's death. He died of fever at Newry on 12 January 1823. He married Eleanor Hunter, by whom he had five sons and two daughters. His children reverted to what they believed to be the original spelling of his surname—i.e. Malcolm. His eldest son, James Malcolm (b. 1811, d. 26 December 1855), was unitarian minister successively at Carrickfergus, co. Antrim; Billingshurst, Sussex; Boston, Lincolnshire; and Chester. His fourth son, Andrew George Malcolm, M.D. (b. 7 December 1818, d. 1857), was physician to the royal hospital, Belfast.\nHe published: \n\n‘A Collection of Psalms, Hymns, and Spiritual Songs,’ &c., Newry, 1811, 12mo. This contains 405 hymns, twenty-three of them being by Malcom himself, and was long the most considerable collection put forth in connection with Irish presbyterianism. It was in use at Newry till 1887, and at Dundalk for many years. Many of Malcom's own hymns are of real merit; six are retained in ‘Hymns for Christian Worship,’ 1886, the authorised hymnal of non-subscribing presbyterians; a large number remain unpublished.\n‘A Catechism … for … Young Persons,’ &c., Newry, 1812, 12mo.\n‘The Communicant's Catechism,’ &c., Newry, 1812, 12mo. Malcom was one of the founders (1813) of the ‘Newry Magazine,’ and for years a frequent contributor. He had some hand in the Newry edition of 1816, 12mo, of Towgood's ‘Dissent,’ probably writing the section ‘Of Church Government,’ &c., in the Irish appendix.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Gordon, Alexander (1893). \"Goudy, Alexander Porter\".

        "content": "John Streett (1762 – 1836/1837) was an American politician and military officer from Maryland. He served in the Maryland House of Delegates, representing Harford County from 1799 to 1800 and from 1805 to 1812. He served as a lieutenant colonel during the War of 1812.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nJohn Streett was born in 1762 at \"Streett's Hunting Ground\" near Rocks, Harford County, Maryland, to Elizabeth and Thomas Streett Jr. His father emigrated from England.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1799, Streett was commissioned as justice of the peace by Maryland's governor and council. Streett served as a member of the Maryland House of Delegates, representing Harford County, serving from 1799 to 1800 and from 1805 to 1812.\nOn February 13, 1812, Streett was commissioned as lieutenant colonel of the 7th cavalry regiment district, which comprised Baltimore County and Harford County. He commanded the Harford Horse, the Harford County cavalry regiment, at the Battle of North Point during the War of 1812. Major General Samuel Smith commended Streett for his \"bravery and efficiency in action\".\n\nAfter the war, Streett lived on his farm of more than 3,000 acres (1,200 ha) in Harford County. Other sources believe the farm may have been as large as 5,000 acres (2,000 ha). In 1812, he was named a trustee of the Harford County Academy.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nStreett married Martha St. Clair on December 11, 1786. They had seven sons and two daughters, James, John M., William, Shadrach, Thomas, St. Clair, Abraham, Mary and Charlotte. His grandson was Maryland politician Joseph M. Streett. His great-grandson was politician Harry Streett Baldwin.\n\nIn 1801, Streett built a brick, federal-style home that was later named the Col. John Streett House. Streett died in 1836 or 1837. He was buried at the family's cemetery. In 1998, his tombstone was replaced and dedicated.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe community of Street, Maryland, previously Highland, was named after Streett's family following the placement of a post office. It was named Street due to the large land holdings in the area by the Streett family.\nIn 1915, a portrait of Streett by painter Paul Hallwig was hung at the courthouse in Bel Air. In 1964, a Daughters of the American Revolution chapter was named \"Colonel John Streett Chapter\" in his honor.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to John Streett at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "Florida v. White, 526 U.S. 559 (1999), was a U.S. Supreme Court case involving the exclusionary rule of evidence under the Fourth Amendment.\n\n\n== Background ==\nFlorida law enforcement observed Tyvessel White use his car to deliver cocaine on three occasions between July and August 1993. Therefore, they found probable cause to subject his vehicle to forfeiture under the Florida Contraband Forfeiture Act. Two months later, White was arrested on unrelated charges, where officers seized his car without a warrant. A later inventory of the vehicle revealed two pieces of crack cocaine in the ashtray.\nDuring his trial for possessing controlled substances, White filed a motion to suppress the crack cocaine. Initially reserving their ruling, the trial court denied the motion after White was convicted by a jury. While the Florida First District Court of Appeal affirmed the conviction,  the Florida Supreme Court ruled that probable cause alone does not justify a warrantless seizure.\n\n\n== Opinion of the Court ==\nIn a 7–2 vote, the Court overturned the lower courts' decision and ruled that under Carroll v. United States and United States v. Watson, law enforcement exercises greater latitude in warrantless searches when in public places (as long as the officials possess probable cause).\n\n\n=== Souter's Concurrence ===\nJustice Souter concurred with the majority opinion; however, he advocated against the unregulated seizure of property whether it is viewed in public or not.\n\n\n=== Stevens' Dissent ===\nJustice Stevens objected to the fact that White was arrested on unrelated charges when law enforcement had the opportunity to arrest him for cocaine trafficking. Additionally, he became perplexed that a warrant was not issued during the two-month timespan. Stevens concludes that the circumstances leading up to White's arrest did not significantly threaten public safety in contrast to Watson.\n\n\n== Significance ==\nThis case grants law enforcement greater ability to seize vehicles without a warrant in public areas insofar that there is probable cause around the need to do so.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nText of Florida v. White, 526 U.S. 559 (1999) is available from: Cornell  Justia  Oyez (oral argument audio)",

It will have an extension of approximately 7.5 kilometers. It will connect with lines 3, 5 and 6 at the Saint Lucia station (in front of the High Specialty Medical Unit No. 23 of the Mexican Social Security Institute).\nOn 29 April 2022, the Government of the State of Nuevo León launched an international public tender for the construction of the line. Construction work is expected to begin on 31 August 2022 and end on 31 August 2027. The second phase of the construction of 13.5 kilometres of lines 4 and 6 is expected to be completed on 30 November 2024.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== First hints ===\nIn April 2014, the president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, announced, in his speech at the 70th assembly of the Chamber of the Transformation Industry of Nuevo León, said that resources had been given to Nuevo León for the construction of Metrorrey Lines 3 and 4. In addition to the possibility of a new line, extensions to lines 1 and 2 were considered. The first option was to expand the viaduct of Line 1, from the Exhibition station, in Guadalupe, to Juárez and Cadereyta, via the free road to Reynosa. The second option was to continue the work of Line 3, which at that time was under construction, from the Metropolitan Hospital, in San Nicolás, to the municipality of Apodaca, using the corridor of López Mateos Avenue. A third option envisaged building the Mederos unit of the Autonomous University of Nuevo León, starting from a terminal in front of the High Specialty Medical Unit No. 23 of the Mexican Social Security Institute in Felix U. Gómez and with a tour of Eugenio Garza Sada Avenue. Finally, the viaduct to the west of the metropolitan area was analyzed to build, in order to benefit the inhabitants of San Pedro Garza García, Santa Catarina, and García, but the outline of this option was not revealed by the state government.\n\n\n=== Current proposal ===\nIn late 2021, governor of Nuevo León Samuel García announced the construction of Metrorrey Lines 4 and 5, then reported through a video on his social networks the place where the new metro lines will pass. The first plan presented provided that line 4 would go from the center of the municipality of Santa Catarina to the center of Monterrey having an original extension of 13.6 kilometers. In the publication of the tender it was cut to 7.5 kilometers ending in the colony of San Jerónimo on the borders of Monterrey and San Pedro Garza García since the master plan and the plans for the Tren Suburbano de Monterrey was updated it will pass to the center of the municipality of Santa Catarina.\n\n\n=== Tendering process ===\nOn 9 September 2022, the technical openings were completed as part of the process of the international public tender, two consortia were registered to win the award of the construction of Lines 4, 5 and 6. One of the consortia is made up of the companies Mota-Engil Mexico and China Communications Construction Company, which also have the construction of a section of the Tren Maya. The other consortium consists of the companies Ferrovías del Bajío, Hércules Construcciones de Monterrey, Constructora Moyeda, Manufacturas Metálicas Ajax, Tordec, Inversiones Ferroviarias de México, Consega Diseño y Construcciones, and Vivienda y Construcciones.\nOn 15 September 2022 the economic proposals were submitted by both consortia and, in accordance with the timetable for the tender, on 23 September 2022 the final judgment was awarded to the winning consortium. During the presentation stage of economic proposals for construction, the Secretariat of Urban Mobility and Planning of Nuevo León rejected the proposal of the consortium composed of the Mexican companies Ferrovías del Bajío, Hércules Construcciones de Monterrey, Constructora Moyeda, Manufacturas Metálicas Ajax, Tordec, Inversiones Ferroviarias de México, Consega Diseño y Construcciones, and Vivienda y Construcciones. It was explained that in none of the above-mentioned contracts had the consortium built any light rail, metro, or monorail lines in the last 15 years. Similarly, they were made aware that braking traction systems and automatic driving systems have not been constructed or operated by any of the members of that consortium.\nOn 23 September 2022, the tender was awarded for the construction of lines 4, 5 and 6 of the Metro to the consortium formed by the Portuguese firm Mota-Engil de México and the Chinese CRRC Hong Kong. At a press conference, it was reported that CRRC will be the supplier of rolling stock, while Mota-Enegil will take care of the construction. The Secretary of Urban Mobility and Planning of Nuevo León Hernán Villarreal explained that the tender has two cost options and that both are profitable for the administration. If the 3 lines are raised, the amount will amount to 25.861 million pesos plus VAT. If line 5 is built at level, the cost would drop to 25.857 million pesos plus VAT. The consortium formed by Mota-Engil and CRRC will sign the contract on 26 September at 10:00, at the offices of the Legal Directorate of the Secretariat of Mobility and Urban Planning, located in the Administrative Tower. Regarding the possibility of building part of the transport system at the street level, during the reading of the failure of the SMPU-LPI-001-2022 tender it was specified that this topic will be defined in November 2024.\nThe construction process began on 30 September 2022 for lines 4 and 6 being monorail type. A popular consultation will be held in November 2024 to determine whether Metrorrey Line 5 will be an elevated monorail or a rapid transit line at ground level.\n\n\n=== Construcción ===\nOn 11 April 2023, work began between the Hospital de Gynecología (Santa Lucía) and Juárez (Pavilion M) stations. On May 4, it was announced that the work of these two stations is expected to be completed in May 2024, and then the work to the Miravalle area will continue.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMetrorrey\nMetrorrey Line 1\nMetrorrey Line 2\nMetrorrey Line 3\nEcovía\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Teatro Angelo Masini is an opera house located on Piazza Nenni in central Faenza, Italy.\nThe structure was built during 1780–1787 to replace the antecedent and smaller Teatro dell'Accademia dei Remoti which had been located in the Palazzo del Podestà. The Academy of the Remote had been originally been founded  in 1673 as a literary and erudite society. Meeting in the Palazzo del Podesta, in 1714 they decided to erect a small crowded theater in their meeting hall with three orders, designed by Carlo Cesare Scaletta and inaugurated on 21 June 1723. But the seating began to fall into ruin, and alternate plans were commissioned. The architect Giuseppe Pistocchi had suggested to build a new theater in the Podesta, but the location was moved to this courtyard-piazza for this theater. Much of the funding was provided by the municipality. The inaugural performances included two ballets and the opera Caio Ostilio by Francesco Bianchi. \nIn 1826, it underwent its first refurbishment under Filippo Antolini and Antonio Argnani. The refurbishment cleaned some of the soot created by the lamps, and modified the central balcony seats which had double height. Pasquale Saviotti in 1827 painted a new theater curtain (sipario). In 1850-1853 and 1869, other refurbishments were pursued. More recent refurbishment in the 1990s updated numerous safety features.\nIn 1903, the name of the theater was changed in honor of the famous tenor Angelo Masini.\nThe interior of the theater has a series of bas-reliefs in terracotta depicting events from classic mythology and Ancient Roman history. At the highest rgister are a series of statues also by Trentanove depicting individuals from the classic myths.\nAlong the facade was build a long gallery, still called the Galleria or the Ridotto dei Cento Pacific. The cento or hundred refers to an oligarchy of magnates and magistrates which pacified the town during the Guelf and Ghibelline conflicts. This congregation was abolished in 1797 by the Napoleonic government, fearing its opposition. The gallery links the theater and a wing of Palazzo Manfredi which runs along Corso Mazzini. The gallery was frescoed by Felice Giani and Serafino Barassi.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Henry Montgomery (16 January 1788 – 18 December 1865) was an Irish Presbyterian minister.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMontgomery was the founder of the remonstrant synod of Ulster, fifth son and youngest child of Archibald Montgomery, was born at Boltnaconnel House, in the parish of Killead, County Antrim, on 16 January 1788. His father had held a commission in the Irish volunteers of 1778 and was usually styled lieutenant. His mother was Sarah, daughter of William Campbell of Killeally, in the same parish. His brothers, William and John, being 'United Irishmen,' were engaged in the battle of Antrim, 7 June 1798. On 9 June a body of yeomanry, in search of the fugitives, plundered and burned his father's house. Henry received his schooling in 1799 from Alexander Greer, at Lyle Hill, co. Antrim, and in 1802 from Nathaniel Alexander (d. 7 April 1837), presbyterian minister of Crumlin, co. Antrim. In November 1804 he entered Glasgow College as a student for the ministry. He graduated M.A. in 1807, and after acting for a few months as tutor in the family of Thomas. Stewart of Seapark, Carrickfergus, returned to Glasgow for a year's study of divinity. He preached his first sermon at Killead on 8 January 1809, and on 5 February was licensed by Templepatrick presbytery. In May he preached as candidate at Donegore, co. Antrim, but was rejected on his refusal to subscribe the Westminster confession. His life-long antagonist, Henry Cooke, D.D., was ultimately the successful candidate. On 11 June he preached for the first time at Dunmurry, co. Antrim, within four miles of Belfast, received a call on 9 July, and was ordained by Bangor presbytery on 24 September as successor to Andrew George Malcom, D.D. In this pastoral charge he remained till his death.\nFrom the beginning of his settlement at Dunmurry, Montgomery engaged in tuition, and from 1815 boarded pupils in his house. On 3 October 1817 he was elected head-master, in succession to James Knowles of the English school in the Belfast Academical Institution, his congregation agreeing that he should reside there. He had just declined an invitation, made through Archibald Hamilton Rowan, to preach on trial at Killeleagh, co. Down, the charge to which Cooke was subsequently elected. He held the mastership till June 1839, and exercised much influence on the literary education of Ulster. Children of all Presbyterian ministers he taught without fee. His connection with the institution naturally led him to vehemently repel the attacks made upon it as a 'seminary of Arianism' by Cooke from 1822.\nMontgomery's first appearance as a debater in the general synod of Ulster was in June 1813, when he espoused the cause of William Steel Dickson, D.D., and helped to break the power of Robert Black, D.D., who, though a liberal in theology, had hitherto swayed the synod in the interests of political conservatism. In 1816 Montgomery was a candidate for the clerkship of synod, but withdrew in favour of William Porter (1774–1843), minister of Newtownlimavady, co. Deny. On 30 June 1818, at an unusually early age, he was elected moderator of the general synod.\nSince 1783, owing to the action of William Campbell, D.D., subscription had ceased to be in full force. Ten of the fourteen presbyteries composing the synod treated subscription as optional. The result was a considerable amount of undemonstrative heterodoxy. A code of discipline, which had been contemplated since 1810, was adopted by the general synod at Moneymore, co. Derry, in 1824. It provided that presbyteries should ascertain 'soundness in the faith,' either by subscription or by examination. This compromise, suggested by Samuel Hanna, D.D., was accepted by all parties. But Cooke persistently sought to render the discipline more stringent. To defeat Cooke's policy was the object to which Montgomery devoted the marvellous resources of his commanding eloquence. The resulting struggle is described by Classon Porter as 'almost entirely a duel' between the two leaders, who were exactly matched in age ; though, if Latimer be right in affirming that Cooke was the son of John McCooke, and born about 1783, he was some years the senior.\nAt Strabane in 1827 Cooke carried a proposal that members of synod should declare whether or no they believed the doctrine of the Trinity. Only two voted 'Not.' Montgomery, who proclaimed himself an Arian, withdrew with others before the roll-call. His speech on this occasion, in favour of religious liberty, made a deep impression ; it was circulated over Ireland, and a service of plate was presented to him (18 June 1828) by members of various denominations, including Roman Catholics. He had advocated catholic emancipation from 1813.\nAt Cookstown in 1828 James Morell, minister of Ballybay, co. Monaghan, carried a resolution for the appointment of a committee for the theological examination of all candidates for the ministry. This was meant to defeat the action of liberal presbyteries, and cut off the supply of Arian clergy. On 16 October 1828 Montgomery and his friends adopted a 'remonstrance' at a Presbyterian meeting in Belfast, attended by Cooke. The last of Montgomery's brilliant speeches in the general synod was delivered at Lurgan on 3 July 1829. The remonstrance was presented at a special meeting of synod, held at Cookstown on 18 August, and terms of separation were arranged at a conference on 8 September. The first meeting of the remonstrant synod was held on 25 May 1800 ; it consisted of three presbyteries containing seventeen congregations; it retained the 1824 code of discipline, and its ministers were secured in the possession of regium, donum.\nMeanwhile, Montgomery had visited the English Unitarians, and advocated catholic emancipation at public dinners in Manchester (December 1828) and London (January 1829). On his return he spoke in the same strain from the altar of St. Patrick's, Belfast, at a meeting (27 January 1829) presided over by William Crolly, D.D., then Roman catholic bishop of Down and Connor. To O'Connell's agitation for repeal of the union he was strongly opposed ; his letter to O'Connell (1 February 1831) was among the most powerful attacks upon the Liberator's position, and did much to alienate Irish liberals from his cause. He was in favour of Irish disestablishment, and gave evidence in this sense before parliamentary committees in 1832. He warmly supported the national system of education (established in 1831), which Cooke as warmly opposed. In 1833 he received the degree of LL.D. from Glasgow University. His last great personal encounter with Cooke was in connection with the management (1838–41) 'of the Belfast academical institution; his speech of 13 April 1841 was followed by the defeat of Cooke's endeavour to exclude Arian professors of theology from chairs in the faculty. In the struggle for the tenure of meeting-house properties and endowments by Unitarians, resulting in the Dissenters' Chapels Act of 1844, Montgomery took a very important and laborious part. His exertions brought on an illness in London (1844), when Peel, whose support of the measure Montgomery had secured, showed him much personal attention.\nIn 1835 was founded the association of Irish non-subscribing Presbyterians, a union, though not an amalgamation, of the remonstrant synod with the Antrim presbytery and the Munster synod. Montgomery, who had since 1832 given regular courses of lectures to non-subscribing divinity students, was on 10 July 1838 appointed the association's professor of ecclesiastical history and pastoral theology. The office was without salary, till in 1847 the government endowed the chair with 150l. per annum out of reyium donum. Many of the students became ministers to the English Unitarians. A controversy on the efficiency of the system of ministerial training arose in 1847. Montgomery founded in his synod in 1857 a revised code of discipline, which restricted the wide range already given to presbyteries in the matter of ministerial examination; but the new questions were withdrawn in 1863 in consequence of a legal decision in the Ballyclare case.\nMontgomery, who had suffered from calculus, died at the Glebe, Dunmurry, on 18 December 1865, and was buried in the ground attached to his meeting-house on 20 December. His funeral was attended by all ranks and classes, including his old opponent Cooke, with whom in later years he had been on terms of friendship, and the Bishop of Down, Connor, and Dromore. The funeral sermon was preached (24 December) by Charles James McAlester (1810–1891) of Holywood, co. Down. Montgomery married, on 6 April 1812, Elizabeth (d. 16 Jan. 1872, aged 78). fourth daughter of Hugh Swan of Summerhill, co. Antrim, by whom he had ten children, of whom four died under age. In person Montgomery was of commanding stature and handsome presence, with a voice of great sweetness, and fascinating manners. His portrait, painted in 1835 by John Prescott Knight, has been several times engraved. Classon Porter describes him as 'a born diplomatist;' his political influence with successive governments was undoubted. His politics in later life became more conservative. It has been alleged that his religious sentiments likewise underwent a change, but his theology neither advanced nor receded. He was much in controversy with later developments of Unitarian thought, which he viewed as equivalent to deism. On his deathbed he recommended to his successor, Thomas Hugh Marshall Scott, his 'Creed of an Arian' (1830), as containing his lifelong opinions. Having a remarkable memory, he rarely wrote either sermons or speeches. His first publication seems to have been an anonymous catechism (1811, 12mo); his best printed sermon is an anniversary discourse, 'We persuade men,' 1843, 8vo. His oratory was more polished than that of Cooke; in pathos and in sarcasm he was Cooke's equal, but he had not Cooke's mastery of the passions of a crowd. Some of his best speeches are reprinted in his 'Life,' others are to be sought in separate pamphlets and in the 'Northern Whig.' In 1830 he was one of the original editors of the 'Bible Christian,' with Fletcher Blakely and William Bruce. In 1846–7 he contributed to the 'Irish Unitarian Magazine' a valuable series of 'Outlines of the History of Presbyterianism in Ireland.'\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Gordon, Alexander (1894). \"Montgomery, Henry\".

        "content": "The Oratory of Eternal Wisdom (Italian: Oratorio dell'Eterna Sapienza) was a confraternity in Milan between 1500 and 1530. It was founded by Giovanni Antonio Bellotti of Ravenna, commendatory abbot of the Augustinian friars of Saint Antoine de Grenoble. Amidst the ongoing Italian Wars, he had been sent to Milan by Joan of France in order to foster spiritual renewal and peace. The confraternity practised the Forty Hours' Devotion.\nProminent members include three future popes, Giovanni de' Medici (Leo X), Giovanni Angelo de' Medici (Pius IV) and Michele Ghislieri (Pius V); the Cardinal Guillaume Briçonnet and his sons, Bishops Guillaume Briçonnet and Denis Briçonnet; and the Bishops Giacomo Simonetta and Francesco Landini. An important spiritual influence on the confraternity was the visionary Arcangela Panigarola, the Augustinian prioress of Santa Marta. Her death in 1525 and that of Bellotti in 1528 sparked a crisis in the oratory. The few remaining members, including Giacomo Antonio Morigia and Bartolomeo Ferrari, were soon joined by new blood from Cremona, including Antonio Maria Zaccaria, Battista da Crema and Ludovica Torelli.\n\n\n== See also ==\nOratory of Divine Love\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "A manteau and pants is a combination of a manteau (long coat or robe) and pants worn together. This ensemble became common in Iran following the Islamic Revolution, particularly due to the implementation of mandatory hijab. Manteau and pants come in various styles, including formal wear for parties, casual everyday wear, school uniforms, and office attire.\nCurrently, manteau and pants are primarily worn as standard attire in administrative and organizational settings in Iran, serving as a symbol of religious and political norms. However, following the death of Mahsa Amini and the subsequent Mahsa Amini protests, the wearing of manteau and pants has notably declined among Iranian women. This shift reflects a growing resistance to mandatory hijab and a broader movement towards personal expression and freedom of choice.\n\n\n== History ==\nFollowing the Islamic Revolution in 1979, a specific style of manteau was introduced to Iranian officials by French political intermediaries and subsequently adopted as an acceptable form of attire by the ruling authorities.\nInitially, women continued to work in government offices without mandatory hijab, even in the early years after the revolution. However, this changed in 1980 when a plan was enacted to ban unveiled women from entering government offices. While this decree did not mandate a specific uniform or manteau and pants combination, it did require women to wear modest, long-sleeved clothing with a headscarf. \nIn the early days of the manteau's adoption, long manteaus were typically worn with socks, and it was only later that manteaus began to be paired with pants.\nLater, during the presidency of Mohammad-Ali Rajai, the government issued a circular defining the required hijab for women entering government offices. The circular, which was accompanied by an illustration of two veiled women, outlined the following requirements:\n\nHijab should consist of an Islamic manteau and pants, with a headscarf as shown in the illustration.\nAll forms of makeup should be avoided.\nSupervisors of each unit are responsible for strictly enforcing hijab regulations within their units.\nIn recent years, various circulars have been issued mandating the use of manteaus and pants for employees in both the public and private sectors. \nManteau and pants have also been legally mandated as the primary attire for female students in Iranian schools.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nIn an effort to promote the chador as an alternative to the manteau for women, Iranian cultural authorities have introduced the \"National Chador\" design and have claimed that this garment, worn with trousers, is a model for Islamic women's attire.\nIn TV series and films broadcast on the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB), images of educated women wearing manteau-trousers and traditional women wearing chadors are broadcast. Manteaus, inspired by the traditional clothing of various ethnic groups, including Iranian Arabs, Kurds and Lurs, are also available in the market with a variety of designs and even decorated with verses of Iranian poets.\n\n\n== Guidance Patrol ==\n\nManteau and pants have played a significant role in Iran's Social Security Plan, particularly in enforcing mandatory hijab regulations. Women have been detained and even assaulted for wearing manteaus that are too short or pants that are deemed too tight or revealing. Businesses and manufacturing units found violating these regulations have been shut down and sealed. According to a directive issued by the Tehran Tailors' Union, the minimum length for a manteau to comply with the compulsory hijab law is 100 centimeters, and the production and sale of shorter manteaus are prohibited. However, this poses a challenge for tall women, as a 100-centimeter manteau may still be too short for their height.\nBased on the \"Ladies' Dress Code Guidelines\" and the emphasis of the Secretary of General Culture Council of Iran, the use of manteaus shorter than knee-length and open-front manteaus is prohibited. Additionally, the front of manteaus must overlap and have buttons.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) is a series of large language models developed by Google AI. Introduced in 2019, T5 models are trained on a massive dataset of text and code using a text-to-text framework. The T5 models are capable of performing the text-based tasks that they were pretrained for. They can also be finetuned to perform other tasks.They have been employed in various applications, including chatbots, machine translation systems, text summarization tools, code generation, and robotics.\nLike the original Transformer model, T5 models are encoder-decoder Transformers, where the encoder processes the input text, and the decoder generates the output text.\nIt was updated by T5X in 2022 to use JAX.\n\n\n== Training ==\nT5 models are pre-trained on the Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus (C4), containing text and code scraped from the internet. This pre-training process enables the models to learn general language understanding and generation abilities. T5 models can then be fine-tuned on specific downstream tasks, adapting their knowledge to perform well in various applications.\nThe T5 models were pretrained on many tasks, all in the format of <input text> -> <output text>.\nSome examples are:\n\nrestoring corrupted text: Thank you <X> me to your party <Y> week. -> <X> for inviting <Y> last <Z> where the <Z> means \"end of output\".\ntranslation: translate English to German: That is good. -> Das ist gut..\njudging the grammatical acceptability of a sentence (CoLA sentence): The course is jumping well. -> not acceptable .\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe T5 series encompasses several models with varying sizes and capabilities. These models are often distinguished by their parameter count, which indicates the complexity and potential capacity of the model. The original paper reported the following 5 models:\n\nIn the above table,\n\n# layers: Number of layers in the encoder; also, number of layers in the decoder.

        "content": "Brachys tessellatus is a species of a leaf-mining beetle, primarily distributed along the southeast coast of the United States. Its distribution corresponds with the turkey oak, its main host plant. Although B. tessellatus primarily feeds and mines on turkey oak leaves, its impact on the host species is limited, allowing for  the survival of both species.\nThe maturation of B. tessellatus spans approximately a year, starting from egg to adult emergence. Adults feed on buds in early March and ovipositing from mid-April to June. Oviposition preferences are hierarchical among oak species, influenced by factors like host abundance and light conditions. \nThe sex ratio of adults skews towards females, possibly due to male-killing bacteria, particularly the Btess Rickettsia bacterium. Parthenogenetic reproduction occurs at low levels, possibly due to male scarcity from male-killing bacteria. Btess Rickettsia is identified as the causal agent of sex ratio distortion, with antibiotic treatment increasing male survival rates.\nNatural enemies, including parasitoids and predators, significantly regulate B. tessellatus populations. Less than 40% of larvae survive into the fall, primarily due to parasitoids and predators. Cannibalism, host-plant interactions, and other mortality factors also impact B. tessellatus populations. B. tessellatus demonstrates a complex life cycle and reproductive behavior shaped by interactions with its environment and natural enemies.\n\n\n== Taxonomic ==\nKingdom: Animalia\nPhylum: Arthropoda \nClass: Insecta\nOrder: Coleoptera\nFamily: Buprestidae \n\n\n== Distribution ==\nB. tessellatus is confined to the southeast coast of the United States, occurring north to New Jersey, south to Florida, and west to Texas. It is also found in Indiana, Louisiana, and Mississippi. This distribution largely coincides with the turkey oak, which occupies the dry, deep, sandy soils of the region. B. tessellatus feeding and mining activities are found to be restricted to the leaves of turkey oak. Adult beetles may occur on leaves of other oak species in the area, but they do not feed and mine on these leaves .\n\n\n== Life cycle ==\n\n\n=== Adulthood ===\nFrom the egg stage to emerging from pupation as an adult takes about one year. Adult beetles emerge in early March, coinciding with or just before bud break in host trees. They start feeding on buds at the top of tree crowns and move downward as leaves expand, beginning at leaf margins and progressing inward, consuming all leaf layers.\n\n\n=== Egg ===\nEggs are distributed contagiously on leaves, indicating a non-random pattern. Most oviposition events are single, with leaf and mine dimensions limiting successful development to one individual per leaf. Eggs hatch from late April into May.\n\n\n=== Larval development and pupation ===\nLarvae have five instars, with the first instar starting in May. The fifth instar may last from late August until the winter when it will pupate. Larvae enter leaf parenchyma through the epidermis at the oviposition site, forming subepidermal mines. Mines widen through sweeps of the mine perimeter, gravitating basally toward the leaf petiole. Larvae undergo pupation and overwinter in leaf mines. Pupation occurs within leaf mines, with cold temperatures delaying onset but not necessary for development. Pupae can survive long exposures to cold, with successful adult emergence.\n\n\n== Reproduction ==\nMating occurs in early April, with females often continuing to feed while mating. Oviposition begins in mid-April and continues through June. Eggs are laid singly on the upper leaf surface, near veins or leaf margins, covered with a waxy secretion. Females use their abdominal sternite to place and smooth eggs. Eggs darken with age and hatch within two weeks. There's no significant difference in hatch success between eggs laid in exposed versus shaded positions. Beetle activities are not random regarding crown strata; they prefer thermally favored microclimates. Early-season feeding and oviposition primarily occur in the upper crown, shifting to more shaded areas as the season progresses.\n\n\n== Sex ratio distortion ==\n\nThe sex ratio of adults is skewed towards females, observed consistently across collections and dates. This skewing is evident even in larvae reared from late-season mines, and this may be due to Btess Rickettsia, a tick-associated bacteria. Inherited microorganisms can cause various reproductive alterations in their hosts, including male-killing. Inherited microorganisms are typically passed from mother to offspring through the egg cytoplasm, resulting in high maternal (female) inheritance. The asymmetrical inheritance pattern of inherited microorganisms is generally adaptive for them because it ensures their transmission to future generations through the female line. Selection therefore favors microorganisms that bias the sex ratio towards females, as females are the transmitting sex.\nA 2001 study identified a new Rickettsia associated with male-killing in B. tessellatus, Btess Rickettsia, as the causal agent of sex ratio distortion. Antibiotic treatment increased embryonic hatching rates and the proportion of surviving males, which aligns with the expectations that the bacterium selectively killed male embryos before hatching. Transmission of Rickettsia to other members of the same species through non-hereditary means may occur through competition for food, particularly in high-density populations where larvae compete for resources. The degree of sex ratio distortion varies across populations, suggesting variation in response to bacterial infection or transmission rates.\n\n\n== Inter-species interactions ==\n\nLeaves of turkey oak hosting living B. tessellatus larvae were observed to detach from trees earlier than those without larvae. This expedited leaf shedding, influenced by B. tessellatus activity, is likely attributed to alterations in leaf hormone levels triggered by larval feeding, a phenomenon observed in similar ecological systems. Increased leaf shedding of the turkey oak has fitness consequences for B. tessellatus larvae, such as growth and survivorship.\nA 2001 study reported that B. tessellatus larvae show developmental plasticity, allowing them to complete larval development successfully over a range of season lengths despite variations in leaf abscission phenology. The findings suggested that B. tessellatus has adapted to variations in leaf abscission phenology by evolving the ability to complete development over different season lengths within a localized area. The study also found that early leaf abscission had little effect on non-predator-mediated mortality.\n\n\n== Reproductive behavior ==\n\n\n=== Oviposition preference ===\nFor insects like B. tessellatus, whose offspring complete development at the site of oviposition, maternal oviposition preference plays a crucial role in determining offspring success. Preferences for oviposition sites are expected to evolve hierarchically based on the performance of larvae on different host plants. The choice is usually between different species of oak (Quercus marylandica, Q. laevis, Q. incana, Q. nigra, and Q. margaretta). Environmental factors such as host abundance and light conditions (sun versus shade effects) might influence oviposition site preferences observed in the wild. Host plant abundance and microhabitat conditions could also play a significant role in shaping oviposition preferences in natural settings.\n\n\n=== Parthenogenesis ===\nParthenogenetic reproduction, or asexual reproduction without fertilization, occurs at low levels (up to 10%), possibly as a selective consequence of the scarcity of males in the population due to high frequencies of male-killing bacteria in B. tessellatus. The system provides opportunities to explore evolutionary dynamics of genetic conflict over sex determination and alternative reproductive strategies.\n\n\n== Enemies ==\nThere are fourteen natural enemies of B. tessellatus, a beetle species. These enemies include:\n\nTwo Eulophid Egg Parasitoids: Parasitic wasps that lay their eggs inside the eggs of B. tessellatus.\nNine Eulophid Larval Parasitoids: Parasitic wasps that parasitize the larvae of B. tessellatus.\nTwo Chalcidid Pupal Parasitoids: Parasitic wasps that parasitize the pupae of B. tessellatus.\nOne Clerid Larval Predator: A beetle predator that preys on the larvae of B. tessellatus.\nThree Facultative Hyperparasitoids: These are parasitoids that parasitize other parasitoids, potentially including some of the previously mentioned eulophid parasitoids.\nUnidentified Egg and Larval Predators: These predators remove eggs and larvae from egg coats and larval mines, contributing to the natural control of B. tessellatus populations.\nAdditionally, there is a hyperparasite associated with the larval stage, which might function in a primary role, although it is not clearly identified.\nThese natural enemies play a crucial role in regulating the population of B. tessellatus. Less than 40% of larvae survive into the Fall, and even less survive until emergence into adults. Primary contributors to this larval and pupal morality are parasitoids and predators. Natural enemies of B. tessellatus ultimately contribute to the natural balance within its ecosystem.\n\n\n=== Other explanations of mortality ===\n\n\n==== Cannibalism ====\nCannibalism may occur when multiple larvae attempt development within a single leaf. However, such encounters are rare, and successful development of multiple larvae in a single leaf is generally unlikely due to limited space.\n\n\n==== Impact on Host Tree ====\nThe effects of B. tessellatus feeding and mining activities on Q. laevis (turkey oak) are limited. Leaf function in unmined areas was minimally impaired, with most reduction in photosynthetic surface occurring during the penultimate and ultimate larval stages when seasonal growth in the host was largely completed.\n\n\n==== Host-Parasite Interaction ====\nThe tolerance of turkey oak and minimal interference from B. tessellatus appear to reduce the impact of the host-parasite interaction, thereby enhancing the survival of both species.\n\n\n==== Overall Mortality and Survivorship ====\nIntrageneration developmental mortality is high (>99.1%), but survivorship is comparable to other natural insect populations studied. Fecundity likely compensates for these losses, with potential immigration balancing losses locally. However, the intergeneration impacts of various mortality agents can not be determined with available data.\n\n\n== Parasitism ==\nThe diversity of Brachys tessellatus beetles has been studied with increasing intensity over the years as a result of their relationship with blood-feeding bacteria known as Rickettsia. The bacteria is involved in reproductive manipulation and has been associated with male embryo mortality in Brachys tessellatus beetles. Researchers are continuing to understand this relationship but the parasitism of the bacterial lineage has been well documented in recent years. The exact mechanisms of vertebrate pathogenicity by way of Rickettsia towards Brachys tessellatus beetles are still unknown.\n\n\n== Microhabitat ==\nBrachys tessellatus exhibits selective preferences for microhabitats within its range. Factors such as light conditions, temperature gradients, and moisture levels influence the distribution and abundance of B. tessellatus populations. In particular, individuals show a preference for thermally favored microclimates, which may influence their activity patterns, feeding behavior, and reproductive activities.\n\n\n== Bionomics ==\nWith regards to the bionomics of Brachys tessellatus beetles, researchers have recently discovered that adult feeding in March and April naturally preceded oviposition from April into June. The eggs of Brachys tessellatus beetles were placed against the major veins of leaf margins and larval development was studied from May into September. It was discovered that Brachys tessellatus beetles have a skewed sex ratio of 1:0.24 (female to male). Parasitoids and predator attacks account for the majority of this skewed sex ratio (causes biased physical, genetic, and developmental tendencies).\n\n\n== Impact on Host Plants ==\nThe microhabitat preferences of B. tessellatus also have implications for its interactions with host plants. Leaves hosting B. tessellatus larvae have been observed to exhibit altered physiological responses, including accelerated leaf shedding [source 3]. This phenomenon, influenced by larval feeding activity, suggests a dynamic interplay between the beetle and its host plant.\n\n\n== References ==",

It was released on 3 April 2024 through Dale Play, along with \"Natanael Cano: Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 59\" as its surprise track.\n\n\n== Background and release ==\nFollowing Bizarrap's 58th session with Young Miko, he would announce his 59th music session where Natanael Cano would be featured; it was already speculated through Bizarrap congratulating Cano on his 23rd birthday and Cano sharing a photo with him on the same day. Before the session was officially released, both artists confirmed that another song would be released simultaneously. The music session was released on 3 April 2024, along with the confirmed surprise track \"Entre las de 20\"; both tracks were released as separate singles and were also formed as a 2-track EP.\n\n\n== Music video ==\nIts music video was released on the same day of the single's release, with it being split in two chapters; \"Endiamantado\" is the first chapter and the music session, while \"Entre las de 20\" is the second chapter and surprise track. In the second chapter, which features Argentinian actor Diego Cremonesi, it shows both artists riding horses, with Bizarrap getting shot by Cremonesi and Cano shooting back.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The geology of Triton encompasses the physical characteristics of the surface, internal structure, and geological history of Neptune's largest moon Triton. With a mean density of 2.061 g/cm3, Triton is roughly 15-35% water ice by mass; Triton is a differentiated body, with an icy solid crust atop a probable subsurface ocean and a rocky core. As a result, Triton's surface geology is largely driven by the dynamics of water ice and other volatiles such as nitrogen and methane. Triton's geology is vigorous, and has been and continues to be influenced by its unusual history of capture, high internal heat, and its thin but significant atmosphere.\nNearly nothing was known of Triton's geology until the Voyager 2 spacecraft flew by the Neptune system in 1989, marking the first and only up-close observations of the moon as of 2024. A number of proposals have been made to follow up on Voyager 2's discoveries, such as Trident and Triton Hopper.\n\n\n== Geological history ==\n\nTriton's retrograde, highly-inclined orbit around Neptune suggests that Triton is likely a captured dwarf planet from the Kuiper belt, being captured by Neptune possibly during an early era of giant planet migration. Upon capture, Triton likely would have had a highly eccentric orbit around Neptune, inducing extreme tidal heating in Triton's interior. This tidal heating would have likely fully melted Triton, rapidly differentiating it. As Triton's orbit circularized due to tidal damping, tidal heating from eccentricity disappeared. However, calculated heat flux values for Triton's surface far exceed what radiogenic heating alone could produce, requiring some additional external heat source. Triton may currently be experiencing tidal heating through obliquity tides, providing adequate heat alongside heat generated from radioactive decay in its core to maintain a subsurface ocean at present.\n\n\n== Surface ==\n\nTriton's surface is among the most youthful in the Solar System, with an estimated average surface age of 10-100 million years old, with some regions likely being even younger. Triton's surface is also unusually reflective, with a Bond albedo of 0.76. This points towards a long history of vigorous geological activity continuously renewing its surface. Though Triton's crust is expected to be primarily composed of water ice, roughly 55% of Triton's surface is covered in nitrogen ice, with another 10-20% covered by frozen CO2 ice. Triton's surface is quite flat, its topography never varying by more than a kilometer; calculating from the relaxation of Triton's surface features, Triton's surface heat flux is on the order of 10-100 mW/m2, comparable to Europa's estimated surface heat flux of ~50 mW/m2.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Polar caps ===\nAt the time of encounter by the Voyager 2 spacecraft, much of Triton's southern regions was covered by a highly-reflective polar cap of frozen nitrogen which is deposited by its atmosphere. The nitrogen in Triton's polar caps may be kept especially bright by regular phase changes between solid nitrogen's α- and β-phases, fracturing the nitrogen and increasing its reflectivity. Though not directly observed, a northern polar cap is expected to exist. A thinner transparent layer of seasonal nitrogen may be deposited on Triton's lower latitudes, having not yet fractured from the seasonal phase change. Modelling of Triton's seasonal cycles support the existence of a permanent northern polar cap with a thickness of at least several hundred meters, and that Triton's southern polar cap is likely to be over a kilometer thick at its maximum. Topography does not appear to strongly control the extent of Triton's volatile distribution (in strong contrast to Pluto's Sputnik Planitia ice sheet). However, the extent of Triton's polar caps may be significantly influenced by the internal heat flux from Triton's interior, with larger heat fluxes inducing greater asymmetry in the extent of the polar caps. \nBetween 1977 and the Voyager 2 flyby in 1989, Triton shifted from a reddish color, similar to Pluto, to a far paler hue, suggesting that lighter nitrogen frosts had covered older reddish material. The eruption of volatiles from Triton's equator and their subsequent migration and deposition to the poles may redistribute enough mass over 10,000 years to cause polar wander.\n\n\n==== South polar plumes ====\n\nTriton's southern polar cap is marked by numerous streaks of dark material tracing the direction of prevailing winds. Four active plumes stretching 8 km high and ejecting between 10 and 400 kg/s of material were observed by Voyager 2, two of which were designated as the Hili and Mahilani plumes.: 196  Each eruption of a Triton geyser may last up to a year, driven by the sublimation of about 100 million m3 (3.5 billion cu ft) of nitrogen ice over this interval; dust within the erupted material may be deposited more than 150 km downwind from the plume in dark streaks. Voyager 2's images of Triton's southern hemisphere show many such streaks of dark material. Though often described as geysers, the driving mechanism of the plumes remain debated and can be broadly divided between exogenic (geyser-like) and endogenic (cryovolcanic) models.\nThe solar heating model is centered around the observation that the visible geysers were located between 50° and 57°S; at the time of Voyager 2's flyby, Triton was near the peak of its southern summer. This suggests that solar heating, although very weak at Triton's great distance from the Sun, may play a crucial role in powering the plumes. It is thought that much of Triton's surface consists of a translucent layer of frozen nitrogen overlying a darker substrate, which could create a kind of \"solid greenhouse effect\". As solar radiation penetrates the translucent layer, it warms the darker substrate, sublimating frozen nitrogen into a gas. Once enough gas pressure builds up, the translucent crust is shattered and the plume erupts. A temperature increase of just 4 K above the ambient surface temperature of 37 K could drive eruptions to the heights observed.\nThe cryovolcanic and subglacial models propose internal heat drives the eruptions. If the plumes are cryovolcanic in origin, it is possible that they consist primarily of water as opposed to sublimated nitrogen. The high levels of cryovolcanic activity would lead to a young surface relatively rich in water ice, as well as an eruption rate independent from that of solar seasons at the pole. A cryovolcanic origin better explains the estimated output of Triton's plumes, which possibly exceeds 400 kilograms per second (880 lb/s). This is similar to that which is estimated for Enceladus's cryovolcanic plumes at 200 kg/s (440 lb/s); far greater than Mars' geysers at circa 0.2 kg/s (0.44 lb/s), which are largely agreed to be solar-driven. The main challenge for the cryovolcanic model is that all of the 120-odd dark streaks thought to be associated with the plumes were found on the southern ice cap.\nThe volatile ice sheet basal heating model is proposed to account for both the significant eruption flux and localization to the ice cap, with the caveat that this layer must be at least 100 metres (330 ft) thick. Internal heat from Triton drives melting and convection and possibly localized melting within the nitrogen ice at the pole. These 'hot spots' in the ice rise to the surface or move to the margins of the ice sheet, where they explosively sublimate once pressure is released.\n\n\n=== Dark maculae ===\nBordering Triton's southern polar cap east of Abatos Planum are a sequence of irregularly-shaped dark spots, or maculae, surrounded by a \"halo\" of bright material. These dark maculae form Zin Maculae, and are roughly 100 km across, with the halos extending a further 20 to 30 km from the maculae's edges. The dark material is most likely composed of organic materials in the form of tholins.\n\n\n=== Tectonic faults ===\nMuch of Triton's surface is crossed by large-scale faults and ridges, termed sulci, indicating widespread tectonism. Compared to Europa and Ganymede, tectonics appears to be a relatively minor component of Triton's geology. Several ridges, particularly those crossing the cantaloupe terrain regions, superficially resemble the faults on Enceladus and the double-ridged linea of Europa, though the ridges on Triton often suddenly terminate, split, or form up to five parallel segments. These differences from the features observed on Europa and Enceladus indicate that, though superficially similar, the ridges on Triton have slightly different morphologies.\nThe similarities of Triton's ridges and Europa's lineae have led to the hypothesis that, like Europa's linea, the ridges on Triton may form due to stresses built up in Triton's icy crust through diurnal tides, aided by an ice shell decoupled from its core due to a subsurface ocean. Triton's faults follow general trends; tectonic features trending north–south and east–west tend to be close to the equator, whereas northeast–southwest and northwest–southeast trending faults occur more at higher latitudes.\nA second class of faults are simple grabens, or fossae, and include narrow grabens 2-3 kilometers wide such as Yenisey Fossa, about 800 km long, and Jumna Fossae, a pair of valleys 300 km long. Wider grabens ~15 km across include Raz Fossae, a complex series of troughs within Cipango Planum.\n\n\n=== Cantaloupe terrain ===\nMuch of Triton's surface, mostly in Bubumbe Regio, is dominated by a unique and unusually textured terrain informally called cantaloupe terrain, due to its resemblance to the skin of a North American cantaloupe melon. The cantaloupe terrain appears to be dominated by intersecting folds or faults, with ovoid depressions roughly 30–40 km in diameter. The formation of Triton's cantaloupe terrain may have been driven by diapirism, though other hypotheses invoke collapse or cryovolcanic resurfacing. In contrast to the bright, reflective terrain that covers most of Triton's surface, large portions of the cantaloupe terrain are darkened. The cantaloupe terrain is nearly devoid of craters, with only three probable impact craters identified within cantaloupe terrain regions. Depending on the source of cratering on Triton, this may indicate that the cantaloupe terrain is less than 10 million years old. However, the cantaloupe terrain is stratigraphically younger than other features on Triton, having been partially flooded by cryovolcanic flows.\n\n\n=== Cipango Planum ===\nCipango Planum is a large, young, smooth cryovolcanic plain that appears to partially cover the older cantaloupe terrain. Cipango Planum hosts several large depressions, most significantly the ~80 km wide Leviathan Patera and the nearby Kibu Patera. Leviathan Patera in particular appears to be the central vent of Cipango Planum, and likewise may have evolved through multiple eruption stages. The first stage of Leviathan Patera's eruptive history may have been dominated by the eruption of very low-viscosity cryolava, explaining Cipango Planum's very shallow topography (especially when compared to terrestrial shield volcano analogs) and massive expanse. If Leviathan Patera is indeed the primary vent of Cipango Planum, Leviathan Patera would be one of the largest cryovolcanoes or volcanoes in the Solar System, with a total area of at least 490,000 km2, significantly larger than the area of Olympus Mons at 300,000 km2.\nParts of Cipango Planum are disrupted by faults, particularly nearby Leviathan Patera. In particular, Raz Fossae, Kraken Catena, and Set Catena are all oriented roughly radially from Leviathan Patera. Set Catena appears to be a part of a northward extension of Raz Fossae, and may have been the site of explosive cryovolcanic eruptions itself; alternatively, Set Catena and Kraken Catena may have formed as faults beneath Cipango Planum continued rifting, creating collapse craters. The close proximity of Set Catena and Kraken Catena could indicate that Leviathan Patera's eruptive activity has been closely tied to tectonism on Triton.\n\n\n=== Walled plains ===\n\nTriton's surface hosts at least four major walled plains between 80 and 390 km in diameter: Ruach Planitia, Tuonela Planitia, Ryugu Planitia, and Sipapu Planitia. The unusually flat floor of these walled plains, which embays all irregularities on the plain walls, suggest that the four walled plains may represent dormant cryolava lakes.: 202 \nRuach Planitia and Tuonela Planitia in particular cut into both the cantaloupe terrain and the material deposited by Cipango Planum. The center of the roughly circular Ruach Planitia appears to have been warped and hosts a central depression—Dilolo Patera— possibly representing a vent whence cryovolcanic material erupted from. Ruach Planitia's northern wall has also been breached by channels, possibly carved from flowing material; similar, smaller channels also cut across part of Tuonela Planitia's walls.\n\n\n=== Impact craters ===\nCorresponding with Triton's high rates of geological activity and resurfacing, few impact craters have been identified on its surface. Unusually, Triton experiences an extreme dichotomy in crater distribution: almost all of Triton's craters are on its leading hemisphere. The cause of such asymmetry is unclear, but may come from geological activity, the source impactor population, or both. If cratering is primarily from heliocentric objects (such as comets), either craters have been undercounted or a large region of Triton resurfaced and erased the craters, giving a surface age of 10-100 million years old. Alternatively, the cratering may be from debris which orbited Neptune, possibly from the disruption of one of its moons; in this case, Triton's average surface age would be younger than 10 million years old.\n\n\n== Internal structure ==\nThe intense tidal heating Triton would have experienced after its capture would have rapidly and thoroughly differentiated Triton, possibly to the point of leading to significant volatile loss. Though Voyager 2 never directly measured the interior structure of Triton, it has been generally inferred that Triton is divided into an outer crust primarily composed of water ice and a rocky-metallic core, separated by a putative subsurface ocean of liquid water and dissolved volatiles.\n\n\n=== Subsurface ocean ===\nTriton likely hosts a global subsurface ocean, and consequently may be habitable. As Triton's orbit is highly circular, the source of heat needed to maintain its liquid water ocean likely comes from a combination of radiogenic heating and heating from obliquity tidal heating. Assuming Triton's ice shell is entirely conductive, Triton's ocean may be 20–30 km beneath its surface.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of geological features on Triton\nGeology of Pluto – Geologic structure and composition of Pluto\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Robert Black (1752 – 4 December 1817) was an Irish Presbyterian minister.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBlack was born in 1752. He was the eldest son of Valentine Black, a farmer at Mullabrack, co. Armagh. In 1770 he entered the class of ethics under Dr. Thomas Reid at Glasgow. He was licensed by the Armagh presbytery, declined in 1776 a call to Keady, co. Armagh, and in the following year, on the death of Alexander Colville, M.D., the non-subscribing minister of Dromore, co. Down, he accepted the call of this congregation, which returned to the jurisdiction of the general synod of Ulster. Black was ordained at Dromore by the Armagh presbytery on 18 June 1777. On 15 February 1782 he attended the convention of Irish volunteers at Dungannon as captain, Robert Black, and seconded the resolution adopted in favour of catholic emancipation. Like other ministers of that date, he sometimes preached in regimentals, and with drumhead for bookrest. He attended also the second great Dungannon convention on 8 September 1783, when his eloquence attracted the attention of Frederick Augustus, earl of Bristol and bishop of Derry, and of Robert Moore of Molenan near Derry. Hence his call to First Derry, where he was installed by the Derry presbytery on 7 January 1784 as colleague to David Young. On 2 December 1788 he was elected synod agent for the regium donum, in succession to James Laing. He delivered an applauded oration at the centenary commemoration (7 Dec. 1788) of the closing of the gates of Derry. As agent for the royal bounty, he exerted himself to secure its augmentation; in 1792, by help of the Earl of Charlemont, Henry Grattan, and Colonel Stewart of Killymoon, the Irish parliament passed a favourable resolution, and 500l. a year was added to the grant, thus increasing the dividend from about 10l. to 32l. (Irish currency). In gratitude for his services the synod in 1793 presented Black with a piece of plate. The seditious tendencies now beginning to appear in the volunteer movement excited his alarm, and he delivered a solemn warning against them in a speech at a meeting of the parishioners of Templemore held in Derry Cathedral on 14 Jan. 1793 (see abstract in Belfast News-Letter, 25 Jan. 1793). He never, however, receded from the positions he had taken in favour of parliamentary reform and catholic emancipation. In the rebellion of 1798 he was strongly on the side of constituted authority, and had great influence as the friend and correspondent of Castlereagh. One form in which this influence was exercised was a further increase of the regium donum, which from 1804 was distributed in three classes (100l., 75l., and 50l.), the agent being henceforth appointed not by the synod but by the government. Black held this office till his death, and did not scruple to use the power it gave him. Opponents called him ‘the unmitred bishop’ and ‘chief consul of the general synod.’ In 1800 or 1801 the degree of D.D. was sent him by an American college. As a speaker he had no equal in his day. In theology he was strongly suspected of heresy, a view which is countenanced by the fact that in 1804 he endeavoured to secure as his colleague William Porter, whose Arianism was openly known. His local prestige was impaired by the circumstances of Castlereagh's defeat at the county Down election of 1805, but his influence at Dublin Castle was equally strong with all ministries. In 1809 the synod publicly thanked him for his exertions in procuring the act of parliament incorporating the widows’ fund. In 1813 his controversy with William Steele Dickson, D.D., one of the chief victims of the rebellion of 1798, was ended by a synodical resolution declaring that words in a previous resolution (1799), complained of by Dickson, had been ‘inaccurately used;’ but Black's influence was still powerful enough to cause the expulsion of an elder who, in the course of debate, had laid charges against him in connection with the bounty. Black was a strong opponent of the establishment of the Belfast Academical Institution (opened 1814); at the synod of 1815, in Black's absence from ill-health, a resolution was passed in its favour; in the same year government made the institution an annual grant of 1,500l. Next year the grant was withdrawn on political grounds, but Black vainly endeavoured, in two successive years, to procure the rescinding of the synod's resolution. His defeat was softened by a not very successful public dinner, given by his admirers in Belfast. Black was a man whose ambition could not brook repulses; his temperament alternated between geniality and gloom. Loss of leadership unhinged his spirit. He threw himself over the railing of Derry Bridge, and was drowned in the Foyle, on the evening of 4 December 1817. His body appears to have been filched from its grave.\nThere is a curious caricature engraving of Black in ‘The Patriotic Miscellany’ 1805, a collection of squibs relating to the Down election of that year. It represents him as a short corpulent man, with a. large head and strong profile. He had married his cousin, Margaret Black (who died in April 1824), and left three sons and two daughters. He published: 1. ‘A Catechism.’ 2. ‘Substance of Two Speeches delivered at the Meeting of Synod in 1812, with an Abstract of the Proceedings relative to the Rev. Dr. Dickson,’ Dublin. 1812.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Gordon, Alexander (1886). \"Black, Robert\". In Stephen, Leslie (ed.).

        "content": "With the Colours is a 1905 Australian stage drama by Edward Irham Cole set during the Second Boer War. It became one of the key plays in Cole's repertoire.\nCrowds during the initial season were excellent. The play was revived in 1906, 1908, 1911, 1912, 1913, 1914 and 1918.\n\n\n== Premise ==\n\"A captain of the forty second is under sentence  of death for supposed cowardice in action. He entrusts his all to the care of a brother officer, who however betrays his trust and robs the widow and orphan. A very exciting scene takes place at the end of the lirst act, where the captain is placed before a file of his own men and is just about to be shot, when the Boers attack the British camp. A hand to hand battle is fought and some very fine specimens of swordsmanship are shown, with the curtain falling on a British victory with Australians to the front.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"Gala y Dalí\" (English: Gala and Dalí) is a song performed by Canadian singer-songwriter Nelly Furtado and Colombian singer-songwriter Juanes. It was released on March 28, 2024 under Furtado's own record label Nelstar Entertainment with distribution by Universal Music Latino. It marked their fourth collaboration, following \"Fotografía\" (2002), Spanish version of \"Powerless (Say What You Want)\" (2004) and \"Te Busqué\" (2006).\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn August 2023, Nelly Furtado and Juanes recorded the track in Toronto and teased it on social media. Juanes said about the song: \"For me, it’s a profound delight to be with Nelly. It means a lot because we have shared a big part of our lives since ‘Fotografía’ until now.\" He explained that on the song, Furtado guided him and helped him tap into a new sounds. \"Nelly takes me to a place of joy and light. I could give myself an opportunity to break away from my sound, from what I play on the guitar, to go to a more Caribbean, so to speak, more danceable sound, which Nelly also wanted to have in this song.\" Furtado called it a \"very positive song, like a ray of sunshine,” and spoke about her connection to Juanes. \"We are crazy about music, that is why we are friends.\"\nAbout the origin of the song, Furtado said that Juanes had the song over 20 years ago but had previously lost it in a backpack and hadn't heard it since. \"A friend had his backpack sitting around at his house all these years and he finally gave it back to him. Inside the backpack was this brilliant song. It wasn't completed, so he asked me to record on it,\" she explains. After helping develop the song, the pair went into the studio to record. \"We recorded it in the same studio that we recorded 'Te Busque' as well, so it was a bit like a time warp,\" Furtado adds. \"There’s just so much nostalgia. We reference 'Fotografía' in the song, so we’re self-referencing, which I’m having so much fun with.\"\nThe title of the song make reference to Spanish artist Salvador Dalí and her wife Gala Dalí. Musically, the song fuses elements of bachata and pop. Lyrically, as Furtado states, the artists reference \"Fotografía\", the first song they recorded together. One part referencing the song is: \"Tengo esa fotografía, en mi corazón está guardada/Y desde 2002 quedé enamorada\", mentioning the title of the song and the year it was recorded. The other one is near the end of \"Gala y Dalí\", when Furtado sings: \"Cuando hay un abismo desnudo/Que se opone entre los dos\", referencing the first line of her verse in \"Fotografía\".\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nCredits adapted from Apple Music.\n\nNelly Furtado – vocals, songwriter\nJuanes – vocals, guitar, songwriter, producer\nAlexis Díaz Pimienta – songwriter\nAndrés Torres – guitar, keyboards, songwriter, producer, programming, recording engineer\nMauricio Rengifo – background vocals, keyboards, songwriter, producer, programming, recording engineer\nSebastian Krys – bass, producer\nFelipe Contreras – producer\nTom Norris – mixing engineer, mastering engineer\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Alexander Porter Goudy (February 1809 – 14 December 1858) was an Irish Presbyterian minister.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nGoudy was the son of the Rev. Andrew Goudy (presbyterian minister of Ballywalter, co. Down, from 1802 to 1818), by Matilda, daughter of the Rev. James Porter of Greyabbey (who was executed in 1798 for supposed complicity in the designs of the United Irishmen), was born near Ballywalter in February 1809, and, after attending school at the Belfast Academical Institution, entered its collegiate department in November 1823. He distinguished himself in several of the classes, and gained some reputation in the college debating society, where his chief rival was Thomas Hagan, afterwards Lord-chancellor O'Hagan. He was licensed by the presbytery of Bangor 29 December 1830, and ordained as assistant and successor to the Rev. James Sinclair of Glastry (not far from his birthplace), 20 September 1831. On 20 March 1833 he was installed in Strabane, where he continued minister till his death. In 1839 he became involved in a somewhat notable controversy on the merits of episcopacy. The Rev. Archibald Boyd, then curate in Derry Cathedral, subsequently dean of Exeter, had issued ‘Sermons on the Church’ in 1838, in which he attacked presbyterianism. In 1839 four ministers of the synod of Ulster, of whom Goudy was one, published a reply entitled ‘Presbyterianism Defended, and the Arguments of Modern Advocates of Prelacy examined and refuted.’ The other authors were the Revs. William Dool Killen of Raphoe, afterwards professor of church history in the assembly's college, Belfast, William McClure and James Denham, ministers in Londonderry. Boyd having replied in a book entitled ‘Episcopacy, Ordination, Lay Eldership, and Liturgies, in five letters,’ the four ministers published ‘The Plea of Presbytery,’ which soon became a standard work on the subject. This Boyd reviewed in ‘Misrepresentation Refuted,’ which called forth ‘Mene Tekel’ from the four ministers. The last work in the controversy was by Boyd, and was entitled ‘Episcopacy and Presbytery.’ Goudy's part in this battle of the books was very ably done. Shortly after he took a large share in the agitation caused by a decision of the House of Lords (elicited by an appeal from the Irish courts), which affirmed the invalidity of a marriage celebrated by a presbyterian minister, where one of the parties was an episcopalian, an agitation which was ended by the passing of the Marriages (Ireland) Act (7 & 8 Victoria, chap. 81), which legalises all such marriages. From this time Goudy took rank as one of the leading debaters in his church, and had a prominent part in all its business. In 1851 he received the degree of D.D. from Jefferson College, U.S. In 1857 he became moderator of the general assembly. He died unexpectedly in Dublin 14 December 1858. In addition to the works mentioned above he published several sermons and pamphlets.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Hamilton, Thomas (1890). \"Goudy, Alexander Porter\".

        "content": "The Langpih Incident occurred on 14 May 2010, when clashes broke out between Nepalese Ghorka and Khasi people, leading to shootings by Assam Police.\n\n\n== Background ==\nFor decades prior, Nepali migration into Meghalaya greatly alarmed the native Khasi and Garo peoples, setting off an insurgency and later ethnic cleansing. In November 2008, amidst the larger Assam-Meghalaya Border Conflict, a dispute over the ownership of the Langpih area (known as Rimuliang to the Khasi) intensified when the Meghalayan Government stated their intention to set up a police outpost on the outskirts of that region.\n\n\n== Event ==\nOn May 14, 2010, a dispute between the migrant Nepali people and the local Khasi and Garo peoples began after the Nepali people claimed the local \"hat\" (weekly) market in the area. The Assam Police were called in, firing on the Khasi, killing 4 and injuring 12 to 26.\n\n\n== Victims and Casualties ==\nNational media reported that four Khasi villagers died of gunshot wounds as a result of the firing:\n\nColumbus Hujon\nCharles Lyngkhoi\nDennis Nonsiej\nEkros Rani\nReports of the total number of injured varied between twelve and twenty-six.\nThe governments of Assam and Meghalaya each reported the death toll as two, with even the death toll becoming an object of political controversy, with authorities of each state moving the corpses around across state borders to manipulate the number of dead.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\n\n=== 2012 Hunger Strike ===\nRepercussions of the 2010 incident continued to be felt in 2012, when Pynskhemlang Nongshlong of neighbouring Rambrai village planned to lead a hunger strike in memory of the four slain men. Nongshlong and thirteen fellow activists took to a stage constructed by local people specially for their fast. Two hours after the fast began, the Assistant District Commissioner of Kamrup and 150 police of Assam State arrived at the site. However, Langpih villagers formed a human chain to deny access to police.\nAfter that, According to the directives issued by the Deputy Commissioner of Kamrup District in Assam, convoys of villagers belonging to the Rabha tribe and the Nepali community from Assam, escorted by Assam Police, arrived at the village and vandalized the Durbar Hall of Hima Raid Mynsaw. After this, the hall was forcibly seized by Assamese authorities and converted into quarters for Assam Police personnel, who still occupy the premises. After this, another conflict erupted when the locals tried to create a new community hall in the area. Mr. Swingly Samakha, the chief of Hima Raid Mynsaw, emphasized that there was no need to inform the Assam Government about the hall's construction as it was funded entirely by the villagers' generosity, without any government involvement.\nThe incident was brought to the attention of the Union Minister by the then Chief Minister of Meghalaya, Dr. Mukul Sangma, who expressed concern over the demolition of the Durbar hall by the Kamrup Administration.\nBy the eighth day of the fast, eight of the fasters had been retired to Shillong Civil Hospital due to ill health; Nongshlong and five others remained, but were clearly suffering from the effects of dehydration. As the fast neared its second week, Meghalaya Chief Minister Mukul Sangma appealed to Delhi for assistance.\nNongshlong declared an end to the fast on 13 July, giving the government a deadline of two months to fulfill a list of demands which the villagers would later announce. However, on 16 July Nongshlong and four women resumed their fast at Nongstoin. Around the same time, the Meghalaya People’s Human Rights Council sent a delegation to the 20th Session of the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland. MPHRC General Secretary Dino Dympep met with UN Special Rapporteur James Anaya regarding the 2010 killings, following which Anaya sent a communique to the Government of India. However, by the following month the GOI had failed to respond.\nA monument was constructed in memory of the dead villagers.\nIn March 2020, the conflict escalated after the Assam Police tried to set up a border outpost in Umwali village in Langpih, which caused tension amongst the local Khasi people. Following this, a BJP MLA from Meghalaya sought Union Home Minister Amit Shah's help in October 2020 to resolve the border dispute. As of 2023, negotiations on the issue were ongoing.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Motshodi or Mochudi was kgosi of the Kwena tribe. He was preceded by his father Kgabo II and succeeded by his grandson Motswasele I.\nMotshodi was the son of Kgabo II, kgosi of the Bakwena. Motshodi succeeded his father as kgosi, with historian Isaac Schapera saying this happened c. 1740. According to Schapera, Motshodi led the Bakwena to Odi (now the Kgatleng District), Mosweu, and Phuthadikobo. The Bangwaketse and Bangwato may have split from the Bakwena during Motshodi's reign. Schapera suggests that the Bangwaketse split while they were in Mosweu and the Bangwato split toward the end of Motshodi's reign. It is disputed as to whether Kgabo II or Motshodi led the Bakwena into present-day Botswana.\nMotshodi's son and heir, Legojane, died within Motshodi's lifetime. Motshodi reportedly lived well into old age, and Legojane's son Motswasele assisted Motshodi in his later years. According to Schapera, Motshodi died at Phuthadikobo c. 1770 and was buried under a mopipi tree, and the location was renamed from Puthadikobo to Motshodi in his honour. Motshodi was succeeded as kgosi by Motswasele.\nAccording to history professor Leonard Ngcongco, Kgabo and Motshodi lived in the seventeenth century rather than the eighteenth. Because Motshodi was succeeded by his grandson, some Motswana genealogies have confused Motshodi as the elder brother of Legojane rather than his father. Motshodi has also been written as Mochudi. According to Schapera, Motshodi was regarded by future generations as \"a good chief\".\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nNgcongco, Leonard D. (1979). \"Origins of the Tswana\".

        "content": "James Porter (1753 – 2 July 1798) was an Irish Presbyterian minister and satirist. He was executed in 1798.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nPorter was the author of ‘Billy Bluff.’ He was the son of Alexander Porter. He was born in 1753 at Tamna Wood, near Ballindrait, co. Donegal. His father was a farmer and owner of a flax-scutching mill. James was the eldest of eight children. On his father's death (about 1773) he gave up the farm and mill to a younger brother, and engaged himself as a schoolmaster at Dromore, co. Down. In 1780 he married, and removed to a school at Drogheda. Designing to enter the presbyterian ministry, he went to Glasgow as a divinity student (apparently in 1784); and, having finished a two years' course, was licensed, in 1786 or 1787, by Bangor presbytery. After being an unsuccessful candidate for the presbyterian congregation of Ballindrait, he received, through the good offices of Robert Black, D.D., a call to Greyabbey (local pronunciation, Gryba), co. Down, where he was ordained by Bangor presbytery on 31 July 1787. No subscription was required of him, and the test questions, drawn up by Andrew Craig, were Arian in complexion. His professional income did not exceed 60l.; hence he supplemented his resources by farming. Having mechanical tastes, he fitted up a workshop, and constructed models of improved farming implements. By this and other means he did much to promote the physical wellbeing of his flock, to whom he was in all respects an assiduous pastor. He is said to have been an Arian, but there seems no evidence of his attachment to a special school of theology.\nPorter had joined the volunteer movement which began in 1778, but took no prominent part in connection with it. He was not a United Irishman, nor was he publicly known as a politician till after the suppression of the volunteer movement by the Convention Act of 1793. One effect of this arbitrary measure was to throw into alliance with the secret society of United Irishmen those who, like Porter, were in favour of parliamentary reform and catholic emancipation, but were now debarred from the holding of open meetings for the agitation of constitutional reforms. Porter in 1794 became a contributor to the ‘Northern Star,’ founded in 1792 by Samuel Neilson. For this paper he wrote anonymously a number of patriotic songs, which were afterwards reprinted in ‘Paddy's Resource.’ In 1796 he contributed a famous series of seven letters by ‘A Presbyterian.’ The first, dated 21 May, was published in the number for 27–30 May. They were at once reprinted, with the title ‘Billy Bluff and Squire Firebrand,’ Belfast, 1796, 8vo (of numerous later editions the best is Belfast, 1816, 12mo, containing also the songs). This admirable satire deserves the popularity which it still enjoys in Ulster. The characters are broadly drawn, with a rollicking humour which is exceedingly effective without being malicious; the system of feudal tyranny and local espionage is drawn from the life. Witherow well says that ‘in these pages of a small pamphlet there is, on the whole, a truer picture of country life in Ireland in the last decade of the eighteenth century than in many volumes, each ten times its size.’ The good Witherow laments that the exigencies of realism compelled a divine to represent a County Down dialogue (of that date) as ‘interlarded with oaths,’ which fail to please ‘a grave and sober reader.’ The original of ‘Billy Bluff’ was William Lowry, bailiff on the Greyabbey estate; ‘Lord Mountmumble’ was Robert Stewart, then baron Stewart of Mountstewart, afterwards first marquis of Londonderry; ‘Squire Firebrand’ was Hugh Montgomery of Rosemount, proprietor of the Greyabbey estate (so, correctly, Classon Porter and Killen; Madden and Witherow erroneously identify ‘Squire Firebrand’ with John Cleland, rector (1789–1809) of Newtownards, co. Down, and agent of the Mountstewart estate).\nLater in 1796 Porter, whose name was now a household word in Ulster, went through the province on a lecturing tour. His subject was natural philosophy; he showed experiments with an electric battery and model balloons. He had previously given similar lectures in his own neighbourhood, and there is no reason for supposing that he now had any object in view apart from the advancement of popular culture, though the authorities suspected that his lectures were the pretext for a political mission. He had written for the ‘Northern Star’ with the signature ‘A Man of Ulster,’ and he began another series of letters on 23 December 1796, addressed, with the signature of ‘Sydney,’ to Arthur Hill, second marquis of Downshire. In these he attacked the policy of Pitt with extraordinary vehemence, and the publication of the paper was for some time suspended by the authorities. Meanwhile, on Thursday, 16 February, the government fast-day of thanksgiving for ‘the late providential storm which dispersed the French fleet off Bantry Bay,’ Porter preached at Greyabbey a sermon, which was published with the title ‘Wind and Weather,’ Belfast, 1797, 8vo. This, which was perhaps the most remarkable discourse ever printed by an Irish divine, is a sustained effort of irony, suggested by the text, ‘Ye walked according to … the prince of the power of the air’ (Eph. ii. 2). Its literary merit is considerable.\nOn the outbreak of the Irish Rebellion of 1798, Porter was a marked man; a large reward was offered for his apprehension. There is no evidence of any knowledge on his part of the plans of the insurgents; it is certain that he committed no overt act of rebellion, and all his published counsels were for peaceable measures of constitutional redress. He withdrew for safety to the house of Johnson of Ballydoonan, two miles from Greyabbey, and afterwards sought concealment in a cottage among the Mourne mountains, on the verge of his parish. Here he was arrested in June 1798, and taken to Belfast, but removed to Newtownards for trial by court-martial. The charge against him was that he had been present with a party of insurgents who, between 9 and 11 June, having intercepted the mail between Belfast and Saintfield, co. Down, had read a despatch from the commanding officer at Belfast to a subordinate at Portaferry, co. Down. The postboy from whom the despatch had been taken could not identify him; but a United Irishman, who had turned informer, swore to his guilt. Porter's cross-examination of this infamous witness was interrupted. He made an impressive appeal to the court, affirming his innocence, and referring to his own character as that of a man ‘who, in the course of a laborious and active life, never concealed his sentiments.’ He was sentenced to be hanged and quartered. His wife was told by the military authorities that Londonderry could suspend the execution. With her seven children, the youngest eight months old, she made her way to Mountstewart. Londonderry's daughters had attended Porter's scientific lectures; and one of them, Lady Elizabeth Mary (d. 1798), an invalid, who was expecting her own death, undertook to intercede with her father. Londonderry could not forgive the satire of ‘Lord Mountmumble.’ Tradition has it that Mrs. Porter waylaid his lordship's carriage, in a vain hope of prevailing by personal entreaty, but Londonderry bade the coachman ‘drive on.’ The sentence, however, was mitigated by remission of the order for quartering. ‘Then,’ said Porter to his wife, ‘I shall lie at home to-night.’ He was executed on 2 July 1798, on a green knoll, close to the road which led from his meeting-house to his dwelling, and in full view of both. At the gallows he sang the 35th Psalm and prayed; his wife was with him to the last. He was buried in the abbey churchyard at Greyabbey; a flat tombstone gives his age ‘45 years.’ He is described as one of the handsomest men of his time. Henry Montgomery, LL.D., who as a boy had seen him, speaks of him as ‘distinguished for an agreeable address.’ He was a collector of books, and his scientific apparatus was unrivalled in the north of Ireland in his day. He married, in 1780, Anna Knox of Dromore, who died in Belfast on 3 November 1823. Her right to an annuity from the widows' fund was for some time in doubt; it was paid (with arrears) from 1800. Of his five daughters, the eldest, Ellen Anne, married John Cochrane Wightman, presbyterian minister of Holywood, co. Down; the second, Matilda, married Andrew Goudy, presbyterian minister of Ballywalter, co. Down, and was the mother of Alexander Porter Goudy, D.D.; the fourth, Isabella, married James Templeton, presbyterian minister of Ballywalter; the fifth, Sophia, married William D. Henderson, esq., Belfast.\nPorter's eldest son, Alexander, is stated by a questionable local tradition to have carried a stand of colours at the battle of Ballynahinch (12 June 1798), being then fourteen years of age; and the story runs that he fled to Tamna Wood, and was there recognised (but not betrayed) by a soldier of the Armagh militia. He migrated to Louisiana, of which state he became a senator, and he died there on 13 January 1844. Another son, James, became attorney-general of Louisiana (see Appleton, Cyclop. of Amer. Biogr.)\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Gordon, Alexander (1896). \"Porter, James (1753-1798)\". In Lee, Sidney (ed.).
