        "content": "All Saints' Church is the parish church of Brandsby-cum-Stearsby, a village in North Yorkshire, in England.\nBrandsby was recorded in the Domesday Book as having a church.  The Mediaeval church was demolished in the 1760s, and replaced by a building on a new site.  It was commissioned by Frances Cholmeley of Brandsby Hall, and designed by Thomas Atkinson, who had previously designed the hall.  Work started in 1767, and the building was completed in 1770.  In 1905, the building was restored by Temple Moore, and in 1913, a baptistry, porch and vestry were added by H. Rutherford.  The church was grade II* listed in 1960.\nThe church is built of sandstone with a hipped stone slate roof, and consists of a nave and a chancel with three bays in one range, a south porch and a vestry.  Over the middle bay is a cupola with an oculus in the square base, eight round-arched openings with three-quarter columns, a Doric frieze, and a stone dome with a ball finial and a weathervane.  The windows on the sides of the church have round-arched heads, some with Gibbs surrounds, and at the east end is a Venetian window.  The glass in the west window is by Charles Eamer Kempe, while the oak pulpit and lectern are by Temple Moore.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGrade II* listed buildings in North Yorkshire\nListed buildings in Brandsby-cum-Stearsby\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Broken Vessel is an oil on canvas painting by French painter Jean-Baptiste Greuze, created c. 1771–1772. It is one of the most famous works by the artist. It is held in the Louvre, in Paris.\n\n\n== Description ==\nIn a vertical oval-shaped painting, the only character represented is a young girl dressed in a low-cut white dress with balloon sleeves. She is holding an armful of roses in one side of her apron, she also wears a ribbon with three flowers, and has a rose on her bodice. She carries the broken vessel, the object of the painting, on her right arm. On her left is the fountain where the young girl had to draw water. It has the appearance of an antropomorphic lion's head through which water flows.\nOn closer inspection, the girl doesn't appears to be so innocent. Her candor is a little exaggerated: her scarf is disturbed, almost revealing a breast, the roses she holds in her hands are a little unflowered and gathered at the level of her hips, while her gaze is hesitant. The fountain may be a symbol for a male relationship. We can also presume that the broken jug symbolizes her lost virginity. Greuze followed this symbolism in other paintings, like Broken Eggs and Young Girl Weeping over Her Dead Bird.\n\n\n== Provenance ==\nThe painting came from a revolutionary seizure to the Château de Louveciennes of the Countess du Barry, in 1794, who had originally commissioned the work. It is held since then in the Louvre. A second version of the work belonged to the marquis of Verri. A preliminary sketch of the painting is also at the Louvre.\nA copy of the painting in private hands was stolen by the Germans during World War II. It was entrusted to the Louvre Museum awaiting possible restitution.\n\n\n== Cultural references ==\nA sculpture inspired by this painting adorns the painter's tomb at the Montmartre Cemetery, in Paris.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Kerouac, Then and Now is a 1986 studio album by Mark Murphy.\nKerouac, Then and Now is the 25th recorded album by American jazz vocalist Mark Murphy. It was recorded when Murphy was 54 years old but not released by Muse in the United States until 1989 when Murphy was 57. The release is a tribute to Beat writer Jack Kerouac and bebop. Murphy reads excerpts from two of Kerouac's works, Big Sur (track 4) and On the Road (track 7) and performs a Lord Buckley comedic routine (track 8).\nMark Murphy recorded Kerouac, Then and Now in two days in November 1986 with producer and arranger Bill Mays. The album is a sequel to Bop for Kerouac from 1981. As with Bop for Kerouac, the album reflects Murphy's interest in the hip Beat Generation, Jack Kerouac, bebop, vocalese, mixing storytelling with music, ballads, and using the voice as a musical instrument for improvisation. Death is an also prominent theme throughout.  Both albums were met with critical acclaim and Murphy was at his peak. Murphy wrote original lyrics for \"November in the Snow\" (track 7). As was typical with his Muse releases, he was paid a flat fee upfront and received no royalties. Kerouac Then and Now was not released for two and a half years after recording, during a period when Murphy was grief-stricken over his dying life partner.\n\n\n== Background ==\nMurphy had previously successfully recorded bop and vocalese (words added to an instrumental soloist's improvisation) on the previous concept album dedicated to Jack Kerouac entitled Bop for Kerouac. Kerouac Then and Now was the planned sequel.\nIn his book, This is Hip: The Life of Mark Murphy, author Peter Jones writes that \"Death haunts the entire album\". The funereal \"Blood Count\" written by the dying Billy Strayhorn, an elegy for Eddie Jefferson, the other ballads, the near death Kerouac car ride, and even the comedic take on Julius Caesar's eulogy all use death as one of its themes.\nSpeaking about his favorite personal recordings with Ted Pankin years later in an interview for Jazziz magazine, Murphy said, \"We accomplished some rather remarkable things with Bop for Kerouac and the second Kerouac record. I was really responsible, I think, for bringing the Kerouac name back into the fore, because two years after my record came out, I noticed that the records started putting out Beat Generation stuff. Hmm! I was never given any credit for it, but anyway, that was my thought on it\".\nDan Ouellette, writing in a feature in DownBeat in 1997 singles out for praise Murphy's \"bold Kerouac projects\" in which Murphy \"unleashed a dazzling display of rambling, hip-daddy-o, stream-of-consciousness vocalese ... What started out as an experiment in capturing Kerouac’s spirit of wordplay turned into some of Murphy’s most organic, inspirational and spur-of-the- moment material\". Murphy told Quellette, \"Basically I was looking for another way to do a bebop album. I never met Jack, and I never expected I’d become a Kerouacian, but I am one of the lucky people still alive who did see Lord Buckley perform...What really turned me on about this guy [Kerouac] was that he wrote like an improvising musician...I really connected to him\".\n\n\n== Recording ==\nIn November 1986, Murphy and Bill Mays spent two days recording what they were calling Kerouac Revisited or Bop for Kerouac Part II  at Tony Bennett's son's house (Antonia Bennett) in his Hillside Sound studio in Englewood, New Jersey. Initially Mays and Murphy were accompanied by Steve LaSpina on bass and Adam Nussbaum on drums and later, on the second day, with John Goldsby on bass. The studio had a Bosendorfer concert grand piano and separate isolation booths for each performer. But there was no video set-up and Murphy was in the hallway with a microphone. Bill Mays recounts the experience as disconcerting. Tracks 5, 6 and 9 were completed on the first day.\nOn the second day Murphy's sister was present for her first experience at one of Mark's recording sessions. Also present was a writer from the fan club magazine Mark's Times, who wrote later that Murphy and his crew got a perfect take on Billy Strayhorn's final song, the \"exquisite\" \"Blood Count\", \"a ballad to end all ballads\". However, the engineer wasn't recording, so it had to be redone. Strayhorn had written the tune while dying in the hospital and Mark sang recently added lyrics by M.B. Stillman. Mays arranged the tune as a \"mini-epic\" with Murphy's vocals exuding \"a whiff of mortality\". Mays said, \"Mark wanted it to be like a funeral\". There were also technical problems getting a successful take on Murphy's spoken word \"San Francisco Ride\" reading from Kerouac over bass and drum accompaniment.\nRichie Cole wrote the elegy to Eddie Jefferson. Speaking about Murphy's recording of his song, he said, \"It's hard to sing, man, with really large intervals. Mark nailed it\". Bill Mays recounts how Murphy was inspired by \"September in the Rain\" to write \"November in the Snow\". Murphy wrote the lyrics first and then Mays composed the melody. Mays arranged it with overdubbed vibraphone in unison with piano to get \"The Shearing Sound\" (In his quintet of the 1950s and 1960s, George Shearing was known for a five voice piano technique with the top voice doubled by vibraphone and the bottom voice doubled by guitar, creating a signature sound), and then in the middle of the track Murphy reads a scene from On the Road in which the main characters are listening to George Shearing play at a Chicago nightclub.\n\nUnable to afford a string section, Bill Mays used a synthesizer to achieve the sound Murphy wanted in the final ballad medley, as well as in \"Blood Count\", \"Eddie Jefferson\", and \"Lazy Afternoon\". Murphy wrote the liner notes extolling Kerouac, the Beat Generation, and the pop and bop music of those times, explaining how his feelings and treatment of the music had changed over the decades and discussing the legacy of the Beat Generation. And he acknowledged Peggy Lee, one of his biggest musical influences, as the inspiration for the albums title.  Murphy wrote, \"That's why | call this record “KEROUAC, THEN AND NOW“, because, as Peggy Lee wrote— “then was then, but now is now...”. (Lee wrote the lyrics to the Cy Coleman tune \"Then Was Then (And Now Is Now)\"). Kerouac, Then and Now would not be released for another two and a half years. By that time Murphy was consumed with grief over his dying partner Eddie O'Sullivan.  \n\n\n== Reception ==\nOverall the critical reception to the album has been positive. Reviewers find the album to be a worthy sequel to Bop for Kerouac, one of Murphy's essential recordings. The album was another in Murphy's tradition as a bebop singer and further associated him with the Beat lifestyle and bebop music. Reviewers find the Kerouac readings to be expressively blended with their associated tunes, in a fashion similar to the analogous recordings on Bop for Kerouac. The ballads and the comedy are also praised uniformly.\nPublished reviews and discussions include the following:\nIn his book, A Biographical Guide to the Great Jazz and Pop Singers, author Will Friedwald says that the recording is \"a worthy sequel\" to Bop for Kerouac, \"Murphy's most successful concept album\" and finds the two sets \"constitute a moving meditation\" on literary and musical beatnikism. He singles out the ballads and prose recitations as high points. He finds \"The Night We Called It a Day\" and \"There's No You\" to be among the best moments. But he calls the very highest points the Kerouac recitations, and \"For supremely hip comedy, Murphy has memorized the most famous monologue by the greatest of all beat comics, the legendary Richard \"Lord\" Buckley, which translates Marc Antony's funeral oration from Julius Caesar into hep-cat lingo\". He says the Kerouac pieces are possibly the most moving things Murphy has ever recorded.\nThe AllMusic entry written by Sott Yanow gives the album 4.5 stars saying, \"It is Mark Murphy's narratives that make this set most unique and memorable\". Yanow also includes the album in his list of best individual Muse sets by Mark Murphy in his book The Jazz Singers: The Ultimate Guide.\nThe Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music rates the release as good (3/5, meaning by the artist's usual standards and therefore recommended). \nThe Penguin Guide to Jazz assigns 3 stars (meaning a good if middleweight set; one that lacks the stature or consistency of the finest records, but which is certainly rewarding on its own terms).\nJohn Swenson, in The Rolling Stone Jazz & Blues Album Guide, assigns the album 3.5 stars (good to excellent) and singles out the Lord Buckley comedic routine and the Kerouac readings.\nPhyl Garland writing a 1990 review of the album in Stereo Review calls the album \"superb,\" finding it to be a worthy successor to Bop for Kerouac. He says of \"Blood Count\", \"What makes Murphy's interpretation so unforgettable is his way of seizing, bending, and shaping the notes into haunting, shadowy forms\". He calls the performances \"rousing\", \"memorable\", and says, \"Torch songs don't come any better than these...When the tumult subsides, as it eventually must, Murphy will be considered one of the major artists of our age\".\nFred Bouchard, writing in DownBeat magazine in 1990, calls Murphy \"restless, brilliant, irreverent, fun\" playing \"fast and loose with the easy beat (read: bop) spirit that Kerouac personified\". He gives the album a 4.5 star rating, singling out the reading of Kerouac's mad cap car ride from Big Sur, and the Lord Buckley parody of Mark Antony's eulogy from Julius Caesar. Finding the ballads the most praiseworthy tracks, he calls the recordings of \"Blood Count\" and the Eddie Jefferson tribute \"heart-wrenching\". And finds the medley of \"The Night We Called it a Day\" and \"There's No You\" to be \"breathtaking\".\nAuthor, singer, musician, composer, and Murphy biographer Peter Jones writes, \"Murphy's second tribute to Jack Kerouac was one of his best ever albums\". He calls the second tribute to Kerouac \"perfectly realised and performed by all concerned, particularly Bill Mays\" and singles out \"Blood Count\" and the medley of \"The Night We Called It A Day\" and \"There's No You\".\nIn a 1990 Washington Post review, Mike Joyce wrote Murphy's \"handsome voice is a horn unto itself, limber and lively as you please. Some of Murphy's best moments, however, come when the mood and tempo downshifts for the wry, conversational lyric Ben Sidran composed for Thelonious Monk's \"Ask Me Now,\" or for the restless, rain-soaked version of \"Lazy Afternoon,\" or for Billy Strayhorn's gorgeous \"Blood Count.\" In the end, it's those performances, not the Beat-era recitations, that are most likely to keep you coming back to this record again and again.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"Blood Count\" (Billy Strayhorn, M.B.

Its representatives were placed among the semi-finalists (Top 10/12) twice; in 2018 and 2019.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2016, after Miss Grand Thailand began franchising the provincial competitions to individual organizers, who would name seventy-seven provincial titleholders to compete in the national pageant, the license for Surat Thani province was purchased by a local entrepreneur, Teeraphat Phungsiri, who organized the first contest of Miss Grand Surat Thani on 14 May 2016, in which a former Miss Grand Thailand 2014 and 2015 finalist, Natthakorn Kaew-Anan, was elected the winner.\nThe pageant was skipped once; in 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand, the national organizer was unable to organize the national event, and the country representative for the international tournament was appointed instead.\n\n\n== Editions ==\nThe following table details Miss Grand Surat Thani's annual editions since 2016.\n\nNotes\n\n\n== National competition ==\nThe following is a list of Surat Thani representatives who competed at the Miss Grand Thailand pageant.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Miss Grand Surat Thani at Wikimedia Commons\nMiss Grand Thailand official website",

        "title": "Hartmut Heller",
        "revision_id": 1219875644,
        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Hartmut Heller (died 5 June 2003), was a German indigenous rights and anarcho-primitivist activist. He was the founder and first chairman of the Friends of People Close to Nature (fPcN, German: Freunde der Naturvölker, FdN; since 2017: Rettet die Naturvölker, RdN) until his death in 2003.\n\n\n== Life ==\nHeller was from in Lauenburg and worked as a nuclear physicist at the GKSS research facility in Geesthacht. Heller died on 5 June 2003 in a German hospital, having been severely sick with multiple \"tropical illnesses\" and Malaria. He was buried in the cemetery of Lauenburg.\n\n\n=== Indigenous activism ===\nHeller originally worked for the German Development Service (DED) where he first came into contact with indigenous peoples. He reportedly experienced at the DED that development aid did not always have a positive impact on indigenous peoples and their cultures.\nFollowing his experiences at the DED, Heller became a member of the Society for Threatened Peoples but decided to form his own NGO which laid exclusive focus on the survival of \"people close to nature\" (German: Naturvölker) and their cultures. This new NGO, the Friends of People Close to Nature (FdN), would be founded by Heller and a small group of supporters on 1 October 1991 in Lauenburg. One of the starting signals for its formation was cited to be the humanitarian disaster experienced by the Aeta people following the Mount Pinatubo eruption in June 1991, about which the newly founded FdN helped spread awareness in Germany as well as making an effort to buy land for the Aetas to resettle to.\nBetween 1978 and 2000, Heller frequently visited the Hadzabe peoples, during the '90s almost every year. He worked closely with the Hadzabe to document and study their culture as well as trying to vehemently defend the Hadzabes' traditional lifestyle and ancestral lands. Upon the forceful relocation of Hadzabe children to boarding schools after the introduction of compulsory schooling in Tanzania during the 1980s, Heller would to reunite the children with their families; this would lead to Hadzabe children being exempt from compulsory schooling. Heller additionally worked on the documentary Hadzabe – Kein Bedarf nach Entwicklung, which was published in 2012, after Hellers death.\nHeller was especially interested in raising awareness for the Negrito peoples of southeast Asia, particularly in the Philippines.\nHeller was close friends with Bernd Wegener, the current chairman (since 2012) of the FdN, who Heller helped join the organization in 1995.\n\n\n=== Ideology ===\nHeller was a self-described anarchist and, at times, also called his organization anarchist. He rejected all forms of hierarchy and argued that primitive peoples lived an ideal and naturally anarchist lifestyle that he sought to emulate; \"polygamous and without clothes or money\". Like other anarcho-primitivists, Heller opposed civilization, and in particular its introduction to indigenous peoples; but recognized that he himself had to use its means in order to advance his goals.\nCommenting on values and morality, Heller said he had made an effort to remove himself from the western perception thereof and the society he had gown up in. Instead, he said, one \"has to choose one or the other, the values of the industrialized world, or those of the naturalistic peoples.\" as they could not be combined. He criticized that naturalistic humans around the world are \"brutalized\" under a \"european-occidental system\" (German: europäisch-abendländisches System) that takes humans their freedom to live in accordance with nature.\n\nAccording to a recounted conversation in which Heller was jokingly confronted: \"Hartmut, when I hear you talking like this, I sometimes start to think you would like to just bomb humanity back to the stone age.\", to which he was quoted as having replied:\"Yes, that's exactly what I want. That's exactly what it's all about! Our civilization is already dead; it is built only on money and oppression. There's nothing alive about it anymore. We have to go back to the life of the savages.\"In 1998, Heller commented on an experience he had made in Tanzania while visiting the Hadzabe peoples, who had just received a donation of used clothes. He was quoted as saying:\"When I got there I could hardly believe my eyes. At that time there were still people who wore the usual fur clothing that barely covered the body. But now they were walking around in ruffle nightwear, lace panties, and brassieres; a \"helpful\" donation was recently delivered. The sight that presented itself to me was grotesque and sad at the same time.\"In 2001, Heller traveled to Cambodia for research on the ancient Negrito peoples of the area but shifted the focus of his trip due to the regions being inaccessible because of remaining landmines. The new focus of his trip was thus shifted to educating himself about the former Khmer Rouge, which he concluded by sympathizing with the regime, saying: \"Pol Pot and the red Khmer had visions and goals very similar to mine. [...]\"; going on to elaborate that he saw in the Khmer Rouge a regime which sought to return to a society free from oppression, money, and industry. He praised, in a 7-point-list, supposed achievements of the Khmer Rouge which he viewed as positive, those being the following:\"1. They brought down the parasitic city juggernaut Pnom Phen by reducing the population from several hundred thousand to under 30,000.\n2. They achieved that people should only eat what they actually grew and produced themselves.\n3. They destroyed big industry.\n4. They finally abolished money so that fairer barter could take place again.\n5. They destroyed many of the monasteries, and imprisoned child monks for life.\n6. They let the road system deteriorate. In doing so, they prevented domination, even by themselves.\n\n7. They demolished the famous ancient temple complex Angkor Wat, symbol and evidence of a brutal, hierarchical and nature-contemptuous exploitative society.\"Heller strongly condemned the United States and its influences on the world, referring to it as the \"US-Killer Society\" (German: US-Killergesellschaft). Heller blamed the United States for the destruction of \"savage peoples\", the murder of children in Iraq, and the defamation of the \"mostly anarchistic way of life in Somalia\" as well as the politics of Fidel Castro. In the context of the Khmer Rouge, Heller criticized the apparent hypocrisy in the touristic and political instrumentation of the Killing-Fields, blaming the United States for atrocities that killed way more, particularly native, people. Heller saw at the core of both American liberal democracy and German \"Hitler-Democracy\" (German: Hitlerdemokratie) the values of progress and development, which he vehemently opposed.\nHeller strongly opposed missionary work, believing that Christianity harms the culture of indigenous peoples. In one instance, he is quoted as saying: \"They [the missionaries] are taking their culture and force their Jesus-faith onto them.\"\nOn racism, Heller described himself as a racist, saying that racism is natural and widely practiced by \"savage peoples\", leading him to criticize other anarchists for rejecting racism. Additionally he commented: \"We as Friends of People Close to Nature, anarchist peoples close to nature, should respect our friends in all their differences.\" Heller also criticized multiculturalism as \"global mishmash\" and viewed the idea that one could move and live wherever they wished, which he saw as being propagated by other anarchists, as dangerous to \"savage tribal peoples\" as he feared that it would bring them \"destructive democracy\", \"human rights of the civilized\", women's rights movements, and \"instructions in dealing with other peoples\"; saying: \"They are racists, they don't want mixing. [...] all primitive and savage peoples [...] only want one thing: their tribal territories.\" He also criticized condemnation over the usage of words such as \"Race\" and \"Nigger\" (German: Neger), which lead to his expulsion from an anarchist event.\nHeller was quoted as condemning homosexuality as a \"perversity\" and believing that \"[...] world Jewry presents a huge danger to the entire world.\"\nReportedly, Heller held contact to some esoteric groups in Germany, most notably ZEGG.\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\nNegritos – das leise Sterben der kleinen Menschen des Waldes, 1995\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Literature ==\nNordhausen, Frank and Garve, Roland.

        "content": "Pierre Cardin SA is a French luxury brand founded by namesake designer Pierre Cardin in 1950. Initially a prestigious fashion house, the brand extended successfully into perfumes and cosmetics in the 60s. From 1988 onwards the brand was licensed extensively, and appeared on \"wildly nonadjacent products such as baseball caps and cigarettes\". \n\n\n== History ==\nThe brand manages more than 8,000 stores in 170 countries. The number of employees who work on the creation of Pierre Cardin products is more than 20,000 people.\nAll products of the Pierre Cardin brand are produced at the Ahlers Group factory in Herford, Germany. \nA 2005 article in the Harvard Business Review commented that the extension into perfumes and cosmetics was successful as the premium nature of the Pierre Cardin brand transferred well into these new, adjacent categories, but that the owners of the brand mistakenly attributed this to the brand's strength rather than to its fit with the new product categories. The extensive licensing eroded the brand's credibility, but brought in much revenue; in 1986 Women's Wear Daily (WWD) estimated Cardin's annual income at over US$10 million.\nIn 1995, quotes from WWD included \"Pierre Cardin—he has sold his name for toilet paper. At what point do you lose your identity?\" and \"Cardin's cachet crashed when his name appeared on everything from key chains to pencil holders\". However, the Cardin name was still very profitable, although the indiscriminate licensing approach was considered a failure.\nIn 2011, Cardin tried to sell the business, valuing it at €1 billion, although the Wall Street Journal considered it to be worth about a fifth of that amount. Ultimately he did not sell the brand.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Pershore Town Hall is a municipal building in the High Street in Pershore, a town in Worcestershire, in England. Originally commissioned as a post office, it is now the headquarters of Pershore Town Council.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== The council offices ===\nA sanitary district was established in the Pershore area in 1875. In 1894, it was succeeded by Pershore Rural District Council, which initially met in the boardroom at the local workhouse in Station Road.In the mid-1930s, the council decided to acquire a three-storey private house, No. 37 High Street, to serve as its offices. The building had been designed in the neoclassical style, built in red brick with stone dressings and had been completed in the mid-18th century. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage of three bays facing onto the High Street. The central bay, which was slightly projected forward, featured a porch formed by a pair of Ionic order columns supporting an open pediment, with sash windows with voussoirs and keystones on the first and second floors. The outer bays were fenestrated by bay windows on the ground and first floors and by Diocletian windows on the second floor. At roof level, there was a modillioned cornice.No. 37 High Street was acquired by the council in 1937 and continued to serve as its offices for much of the 20th century, but ceased to be the local seat of government when Wychavon District Council was formed in 1974. It was subsequently converted for commercial use and is now occupied by a firm of solicitors, Thomson & Bancks.\n\n\n=== The current town hall ===\nThe current town hall was originally commissioned as a post office, replacing an earlier post office on the same site, and was erected facing the old council offices. It was designed by Henry Seccombe in the neoclassical style, built in red brick with stone finishings and was completed in 1932. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage of five bays facing onto the High Street. The end bays featured doorways with stone surrounds, voussoirs and keystones. The central three bays on the ground floor were fenestrated by round headed windows with architraves and keystones, while all the bays on the first floor were fenestrated by sash windows, and all the bays at attic level were fenestrated by dormer windows. A projecting clock, intended to commemorate the lives of local service personnel who died in the Second World War, was installed above the central window on the ground floor in October 1953. It was replaced as part of celebrations for the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II in 1977.In 1973, the post-office was recategorised as a sub-post office, and in the late 1990s, it moved into the town's Tesco supermarket. The building was subsequently purchased by Pershore Town Council, which conducted alterations and in 2002 reopened it as the town hall. A council chamber and a small council members' room, were established on the ground floor.  The Pershore Heritage Centre, which opened in 1995, moved to the first floor of the building in 2003. Its collection includes a series of folders documenting the events of the Second World War in the Vale, the acquisition of which were funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund.A memorial garden, intended to commemorate the lives of people who died during the COVID-19 pandemic, was established in the walkway to the south of the town hall in March 2021.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPershore Town Hall",

        "content": "The Mercedes-AMG F1 W15 E Performance, commonly referred to as the Mercedes W15, is a Formula One racing car designed and built by the Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One Team to compete in the 2024 Formula One World Championship. This is the first Mercedes Formula One car fully designed by British designer and engineer James Allison since he returned to his previous position as Technical Director of Mercedes-AMG F1, swapping jobs with Mike Elliott, who had taken his place earlier. The car is driven by returning drivers George Russell and 7-time FIA Formula One World Champion Lewis Hamilton, who is in his final season with the team.\n\n\n== Background and design ==\nMercedes endured a difficult 2023 season with the W14, where they finished second behind Red Bull with 451 points adrift, and barely able to keep second place ahead of Ferrari by 3 points.\nTeam Principal Toto Wolff stated that the team would change the concept for the W15, including the way they laid out the chassis, the weight, and the airflow. Wolff added that changing almost all components could be the best shot for the team to contend in front in 2024. Before heading into the off-season break, Hamilton stated the mood in Brackley and Brixworth camps were \"positive\", and he had an opportunity to check the progress of the W15's development in their wind tunnel, despite unable to pinpoint on where the team is with the new car. \nTechnical Director James Allison labelled the W15 project as \"ambitious\" and stated the team had made a lot of progress with the car over the winter. Allison later clarified that the late introduction of sidepods starting from the 2023 Monaco Grand Prix wasn't the main feature that sealed their shortcomings in 2023, and added that the W15 will look significantly different from its predecessors. Wolff recounted that the team's simulator driver, Anthony Davidson, tested the W15 in the simulator driving it in Melbourne and spoke favorably of the results, stating \"The car felt like a proper car in two years.\"\nIn February 2024, Hamilton announced that the 2024 season would be his last with Mercedes as he would depart to Ferrari in the following season, meaning that the W15 would be the last car he drove for the Silver Arrows.\nThe W15 was unveiled at Silverstone Circuit on 14 February and was livestreamed on the team's YouTube channel. The car sported a black livery with a silver nose with their sponsor, Petronas' turquoise color as its outline. From the technical side, the car had a different sidepod shape, and the team opted to make the switch from pull-rod suspension into push-rod suspension system. The team focused on resolving W14's unpredictable axle issue over the winter to make sure the same issue didn't happen on the W15. Another notable feature is that the team pushed the cockpit position a bit further back, something that Hamilton has been vocal about starting from their 2022 car. Hamilton and Russell made a brief 15km demo day in Silverstone with the first proper running will be held as part of their 200km filming day in Bahrain, before pre-season testing commenced.\n\n\n== Season summary ==\n\n\n=== Pre-season testing ===\nPre-season testing commenced on 21 February with Russell having the entire day for himself. Russell set the sixth fastest lap for the morning but would end up as the 12th fastest for the afternoon session. Russell stated \"The W15 felt nicer to drive compared to the W14. We will continue to maximize our time here to gather data to find the sweet spot.\"\nOn Day 2, Hamilton completed over 100 laps and clocked in the third fastest time as the session went to a close. After his testing duties, Hamilton confirmed his teammate's positive reception of the car and admitted that he enjoyed a productive day of testing.\nThe team ended their pre-season testing on a good note with Russell finishing second fastest. Both drivers found the car much more stable and more predictable compared to its predecessor. Trackside engineering chief Andrew Shovlin was encouraged by the strong showing during the pre-season testing. Shovlin stated \"The team has put in a lot of work to address the handling issues with the W14. So it's great to see that we have put these issues behind us.\"\n\n\n=== Opening rounds ===\nThe record-breaking season kicked off in Bahrain with the team setting a 1–2 in FP2. Mercedes had a mixed qualifying session as Russell qualified third while Hamilton was in distant ninth. However, the race itself wasn't any better as Russell ended up fifth after suffering a power unit heating issue which required him to lift and coast. Hamilton finished the race in seventh after suffering an issue with his seat. Wolff claimed the team was losing around 0.5 seconds per lap due to the engine issue, which also hampered their customer team, Williams.\nIn the FP2 of the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, Mercedes were fined €15.000 for failing to inform Hamilton of the incoming Logan Sargeant in the Williams, which resulted in a near miss between the two. Hamilton himself received a reprimand from the stewards. Russell and Hamilton locked up the fourth row with the former starting from seventh. Hamilton gambled by not pitting due to an early safety car, running as high as third at some point and defending the charging Oscar Piastri in the McLaren for 20 laps. Russell finished the race in sixth, 40 seconds behind winner Max Verstappen. Hamilton's seventh and ninth place finish marked his worst-ever start into the season since 2009. Hamilton stated, \"It's definitely not fun finishing ninth despite I'm pushing as hard as I could, but we were lacking in the high-speed sections.\"\nIn the Australian Grand Prix, Hamilton was knocked out of Q2 for the first time since its 2010 edition. Russell meanwhile qualified seventh, maintaining his Q3 appearance for the third consecutive race weekends. The race marked the first double DNF for the team since the 2018 Austrian Grand Prix. Hamilton retired early due to a power unit failure while Russell crashed out in a penultimate lap incident with Fernando Alonso. Their lackluster Melbourne showing made Wolff \"wanted to punch himself in the nose.\"\nIn Japan, Hamilton out-qualified Russell for the first time in 2024 with the former starting from seventh, while the latter from ninth. During the race Hamilton radioed his race engineer Peter Bonnington to ask whether he should let Russell by, which he promptly done so. The final classification was the reverse of the duo's starting grid.\nAt the sprint qualifying of the Chinese Grand Prix, Hamilton puts the W15 on the front row behind Lando Norris, while Russell were knocked out in Q2 and had to start from 11th. During the sprint race, Hamilton overtook Norris in the first corner and held the lead for a couple of laps before being overtaken by Verstappen. Hamilton finished the sprint in second place while Russell finished eighth — the last points-scoring position for the sprint. Hamilton was knocked out in Q1 for the main race after locking up on Turn 14 and would start from 18th. Russell had a better qualifying session and started the race from eighth on the grid.\n\n\n== Complete Formula One results ==\n(key)\n\n* Season still in progress.\n\n\n== References ==",

Leading a tech hub NHUB  which was founded in 2016 and that still thrives in the tech space, Daser has been a profound source of inspiration for emerging tech talents in Jos the capital of Plateau State.   \n\nThe proliferation of ethnic-fueled violence in many parts of Plateau State, multi-religious by dynamics has resulted into avoidable bloodbaths and reprisal attacks. For Daser, this unending cycle of terror can be and must be nipped in the bud. Speaking to journalists, Mr Daser said, We have worked ceaselessly for an industry fostered on commitment to country and young people. This new challenge offers an opportunity for further service to drive that vision that Nigeria indeed and Plateau state can become the bastion of a new economy. This is in line with the vision of Governor Simon Lalong who has never shied away from investing in peace efforts and development of young people. I believe this is an invitation to work for the advancement of Plateau State particularly among young people in the tech ecosystem.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Realtime motion graphics software is a relatively recent type of computer program that is a hybrid between Digital Signage, Motion Graphics and video game engine tools.  Like digital signage, these tools are designed to present or otherwise be reactive to live and dynamically changing data while also providing the creative design flexibility of motion graphics tools.  These tools are often used for theatrical production, live concerts and art installations, among others, where the visuals may need to be timed to human performers or react to humans in a museum exhibit. The user interface presented to the user in these tools tends to resemble a visual programming environment that allows the user to manipulate and transform data within many types such as pixel and geometry data, audio waveforms, MIDI, and data coming from various sensors.  In some cases, these tools will translate the visual programming into a very fast performance native code executable program with very little overhead, and can be distributed and used without dependency on the original software.\n\n\n== Origins ==\nRealtime visual tools have been around for decades for live television production. Silicon Graphics began producing hardware for mixing live video with real-time composited 3D visuals in the 1980's starting with the 4D Iris machines. SGI machines were often used for live sporting events and for live weather infographics.  \nIn the early 2000's, companies like Green Hippo started producing a turn-key hardware & software system called media server for live events. These systems could provide multiple video outs to multiple projectors, and using calibration tools, one could align the multiple projectors to appear as one large seemless image. Additionally, one could use these tools to calibrate images projected to non-flat or even moving surfaces and the software would, in realtime, pre-map visuals as needed, regardless of differences in venue requirements such as stage size and positioning of projectors.  \nTouchDesigner is one of the earliest tools directly in this category, originating as a side project of Houdini which has roots going back to the PRISMS software developed by Omnibus Computer graphics in the mid 1980's.  It \n\n\n== Usage cases ==\nWhile there are some commonalities of this class of software with tools within game engines like Unreal Engine and Unity, these tools tend to occupy a unique space somewhere real-time graphics engine and software like Adobe After Effects, as they may offer a timeline interface to sequence events at key moments like After Effects, while also providing the visual programming define dynamic interactions like physical simulations. An example might be a keyframed animation of a box with physically animated fluid inside or an aquarium exhibit with a pre-programmed presentation of different species of fish moving about in a glass aquarium with the motion of the fish procedurally defined and also reactive to tapping on the glass.\nThe demoscene that evolved from the 1980's home computer world to becoming world-wide art expo events has many commonalities and in fact some of the powerful tools that fall under this category initially started out as tools used to assist in producing demoscene productions, such as Tooll3 and Notch, to name just a few.  \n\n\n== Examples ==\nTouch Designer\nTooll3\nNotch (VFX Software)\n\n\n== See also ==\nMotion graphics\nMedia server\nDemoscene\n\n\n== References ==",

W. Bush appeared to be in trouble. His momentum had collapsed after falling short in a state he won in 1980, and his lead in new Hampshire had collapsed. However, the Bush campaign responded by running television commercials portraying Dole as a tax raiser, while Governor John H. Sununu stumped for Bush - enabling a victory by the incumbent Vice President.\nRegaining footing with his win in New Hampshire, Bush's organizational strength and fundraising lead were impossible for the other candidates to match as the primaries went into multiple states across the country. Bush was resoundingly elected as the Republican nominee, and went on to win the general election against Democrat Michael Dukakis. \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Marina Lipovac Tanasković (Serbian Cyrillic: Марина Липовац Танасковић; born 1978) is a Serbian politician. She served in the National Assembly of Serbia from 2022 to 2024 as a member of the People's Party (Narodna).\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nLipovac Tanasković was born in Belgrade, in what was then the Socialist Republic of Serbia in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. She was raised in the city and graduated from the University of Belgrade Faculty of Traffic Engineering. In 2002, she was declared the best student in the road and city department. She has worked as chief engineer on several large infrastructure projects, including the construction of a bypass around Belgrade, the Belgrade–Novi Sad highway, and the Pirot–Dimitrovgrad highway. She has also worked on numerous traffic projects in Western Australia. During her time in public office, she was employed as a technical director for the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport.\n\n\n== Politician ==\n\n\n=== City delegate (2018–23) ===\nThe People's Party participated in the 2018 Belgrade City Assembly election as part of Dragan Đilas's multi-party coalition. Lipovac Tanasković appeared in the twenty-seventh position on the coalition's electoral list and narrowly missed direct election to the City Assembly of Belgrade when the list won twenty-six seats. She received a mandate on 29 June 2018 as the replacement for another delegate. The Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) and its allies won a majority government, and Lipovac Tanasković served in opposition. \nThe People's Party established its own Belgrade assembly group in December 2020, and Lipovac Tanasković was chosen as its leader. She indicated that her party would work closely with the Party of Freedom and Justice (SSP), another prominent opposition group.\nFor the 2022 Belgrade election, the People's Party took part in the United for the Victory of Serbia (UZPS) coalition of opposition parties. Lipovac Tanasković received the eighth position on the coalition's list and was re-elected when it won twenty-six seats. The SNS won a plurality victory and ultimately retained power, while the UZPS parties served in opposition.\nThe city assembly was dissolved on 30 October 2023 in order to permit an early election, and Lipovac Tanasković's term came to an end at that time.\n\n\n=== Parliamentarian (2022–2024) ===\nLipovac Tanasković received the twenty-fourth position on the United for the Victory of Serbia electoral list in the 2022 Serbian parliamentary election and was elected when the list won thirty-eight seats. The SNS and its allies won the election, and Lipovac Tanasković served with the People's Party group in opposition. She was a member of the committee on spatial planning, transport, infrastructure, and telecommunications, a deputy member of the environmental protection committee and the committee on the rights of the child, and a member of the parliamentary friendship groups with Australia, Malta, Peru, South Africa, the countries of Southeast Asia, and the United Arab Emirates.\nIn a June 2023 interview, Lipovac Tanasković described the People's Party as a bridge between the \"national\" and \"civil\" camps in Serbia's political culture. She was quoted as saying, \"Right-wingers think that we are pro-European, and then if you ask some other MPs, they will say that we are too right-wing [...] We believe that we do not give enough attention to national interests, that Kosovo and Metohija is an inalienable part of Serbia, just as we believe that Serbia should strive for some European principles.\"\nThe People's Party experienced a serious split in August 2023, with several members joining the breakaway People's Movement of Serbia (NPS). Lipovac Tanasković remained with the People's Party. \nThe party fielded its own lists in both the 2023 Serbian parliamentary election and the concurrent 2023 Belgrade City Assembly election, and Lipovac Tanasković appeared in the fifth position for both campaigns. The party failed to cross the electoral threshold at either level. Her national assembly term ended when the new assembly convened in February 2024.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Waseca County Historical Society Museum, also known as the Waseca County History Center, is a local history museum located in Waseca, Minnesota and operated by the Waseca County Historical Society. Founded in 1938, the museum is dedicated to preserving and interpreting the rich history of Waseca County, established in 1857.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe inception of the Waseca County Historical Society dates back to 1938 when early artifact donations were showcased in a space within the basement of the Waseca County courthouse. As the demand for more space grew in the mid-fifties, the society had to relocate the cabin to the Waseca County fairgrounds, where it was housed in a cement block building known as Hodgson Hall. In 1962, local citizen Edgar Johnson and his family purchased the former Methodist Church building, which was later renovated and donated by the Johnson family to become the official Waseca County Museum in 1964.\n\n\n== Exhibits ==\nThe museum features a variety of exhibits on the main floor and balcony. The permanent exhibit, \"The Timeline of Unique Stories from Waseca County,\" showcases over 150 years of county history through panels and display cases. Visitors can explore the stories of the people who settled the area, the events that shaped the county, and the unique character of Waseca County.\n\n\n== Research Facilities and Collections ==\nIn addition to the museum exhibits, the Waseca County Historical Society also maintains the Bailey-Lewer Research Library. This library provides resources for those interested in researching their family history or learning more about Waseca County's past. The library collection includes photographs, an atlas, and even the original 1857 Waseca County Minutes. The Society maintains an archive that includes over 37,000 artifact records, 17,000 photographs, and 350,000 archived records. This collection encompasses historical documents, family histories, oral histories, and birth, death, and marriage records.\n\n\n== The P.C. Bailey House ==\nThe Waseca County Historical Society also manages the P.C. Bailey House, a historic home built in 1868 by Dayton Smith. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the Bailey House offers a glimpse into the lives of early Waseca County residents.\n\n\n== References ==",

In the same year, Flamininus was sent as an ambassador to Cotys IV, King of Thrace, to return the king's son, a Roman hostage, to the allied kingdom. In 153 BC, he served as praetor. In 150 BC, he was elected consul together with Manius Acilius Balbus as his colleague. Shortly after the consulship, Flamininus died.\n\n\n== References ==",

The tournament will take place at the Wunderino Arena, Kiel, Germany from 10 to 12 May 2024. It will feature a field of 48 players and £175,000 in prize money, with £30,000 going to the winner.\nDave Chisnall is the defending champion after defeating Luke Humphries 8–5 in the 2023 final.\n\n\n== Prize money ==\nThe prize fund remained at £175,000, with £30,000 to the winner:\n\nPre-qualified players from the Orders of Merit who lose in their first match of the event shall not be credited with prize money on any Order of Merit. A player who qualifies as a qualifier, but later becomes a seed due to the withdrawal of one or more other players shall be credited with their prize money on all Orders of Merit regardless of how far they progress in the event.\n\n\n== Qualification and format ==\nA massive overhaul in the qualification for the 2024 European Tour events was announced on 7 January.\nFor the first time, both the PDC Order of Merit and the PDC ProTour Order of Merit rankings were used to determine 32 of the 48 entrants for the event.\nThe top 16 on the PDC Order of Merit qualified, along with the highest 16 ranked players on the PDC ProTour Order of Merit (after the PDC Order of Merit players were removed). From those 32 players, the 16 highest ranked players on the PDC ProTour Order of Merit were seeded for the event.\nThe seedings were confirmed on 4 April.\nThe remaining 16 places went to players from four qualifying events – 10 from the Tour Card Holder Qualifier (held on 10 April), four from the Host Nation Qualifier (held on 18 February), one from the Nordic & Baltic Associate Nation Qualifier (held on the 5 April) and one from the East European Associate Member Qualifier (held on the 6 April).\nThe following players will take part in the tournament:\n\n\n== Draw ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2023–2024 PFF National Challenge Cup is the ongoing 30th edition of domestic cup competition in Pakistan. 27 departmental teams are participating in the competition, from 24 January 2023. The cup feature the 27 departmental teams across the country vying for the title, which will be defended by 2020 champions WAPDA. \nInitially scheduled to be held throughout 2023, the second knock-out phase will be held in May 2024 after almost 15 months of inactivity. \n\n\n== Background ==\nThe tournament took place after a gap of nearly three-and-a-half years because of the Pakistan Football Federation's suspension by FIFA due to a power struggle within the Pakistan Football Federation. FIFA lifted the ban imposed on PFF after the legitimate Normalization Committee body was restored.\nThe tournament was announced briefly after departmental sports in Pakistan were restored in August 2022 by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. Many of the departmental clubs were disbanded following the shutdown of departmental sports in Pakistan in September 2021. Departmental teams were then restricted to the PFF National Challenge Cup, following their controversial participation in the Pakistani domestic league setup in the previous years. A PFF official stated that from now on, there will be separate competitions for departments and clubs. When a domestic league is held, it will be solely for clubs.\nThe PFF Constitution stated that all departmental players need to be “affiliated with a club”, with some teams taking advantage of it such as POPO FC, which had their team playing the Challenge Cup under the department with the name of Mamsons Builders. Lyallpur FC competed under the name of Otto Cranes.\n\n\n== Format ==\nIn the first phase, teams, bracketed in seven groups, will compete on home and away basis. The leading two teams from each group and the two best third-placed sides will progress to the round of 16. The first phase was held at Karachi, Lahore, Bahawalpur, Faisalabad, Peshawar, Quetta, Chaman, Rawalpindi and Islamabad simultaneously. \nThe second phase, which will be knock-out, was set to be conducted from May 1 to 12 in 2023 at a centre yet to be decided. It was postponed to kick off on the 21st of October until 6 November 2023. After an uncertain inactivity almost 15 months after it began, the National Challenge Cup knockout stage was finally announced to reach its end in Lahore  from May 1 to 12 in 2024, starting with the round of 16.\n\n\n=== Grounds ===\nGroup A matches took place at the KPT Stadium. Group B matches primarily occurred at Ayub National Stadium in Quetta, with the opening match at Essa Khan Football Ground in Chaman. Group C matches were held at Gulzar Sadiq Stadium in Bahawalpur. Group D matches commenced at Panthers Ground in Faisalabad, with additional matches at Dhanola Ground and Agriculture University. Group E matches kicked off at Railway Stadium in Lahore, along with other venues like SA Garden Football Ground and Punjab University Ground. Group F matches started at KRL Stadium in Rawalpindi, with matches also taking place at Municipal Stadium, Army Stadium, and POF Ground. Group G's opening match was held at Tehmas Khan Stadium in Peshawar, with matches also at PAF Complex.\n\n\n== Teams ==\nThe 27 teams participating in the tournament are as below: \n\n\n== Group stage ==\n\n\n=== Group A ===\n\nGwadar Port Authority withdrew due to their internal issues.\n\n\n=== Group B ===\n\n\n=== Group C ===\n\n\n=== Group D ===\n\n\n=== Group E ===\n\n\n=== Group F ===\n\n\n=== Group G ===\n\n\n== Knockout round ==\n\n\n=== Round of 16 ===\n\n\n=== Quarter-finals ===\n\n\n=== Semi-finals ===\n\n\n=== Third position ===\n\n\n=== Finals ===\n\n\n=== Bracket ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n2023–2024 PFF National Challenge Cup | FootballPakistan.com",

        "content": "Suri Jagek, meaning \"observing the sun\" in the Kalasha language, is a traditional meteorological and astronomical knowledge system practiced by the Kalasha people in the Hindu Kush mountain range. It involves observing the sun, moon, stars, and shadows in relation to local topography. This system, based on empirically observed knowledge, helps predict the best times for sowing seeds, managing animal husbandry, and preparing for natural disasters. It also governs the Kalasha calendar, determining dates for social events, festivals, feasts, and religious ceremonies.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nSuri Jagek entails studying the  sun, moon, stars, and shadows in connection with the surrounding landscape. It relies on empirical observations to forecast optimal periods for planting seeds, overseeing livestock, and preparing for natural disasters. It also regulates the Kalasha calendar, establishing dates for social gatherings, festivals, feasts, and religious rituals.\nSuri Jagek reflects the Kalasha people's deep connection with their environment and the importance of their geographical context in sustaining their way of life. The knowledge is passed down through oral traditions, including folk stories, songs, proverbs, and rhetoric. Some aspects, like using shadow studies for cattle rearing, are being adapted for modern society. However, with the rise of digital technologies, there is a growing preference for more modern methods of weather prediction.\nThe observatories used for Suri Jagek, known as Suri Jagaekein, are situated in villages across the Mumuret (Bumburet), Biriu (Birir), and Rukmu (Rumbur) valleys in the Hindu Kush range. \n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Inclusion in UNESCO's 2018 Intangible Cultural Heritage list ===\nIn 2018, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) approved the inclusion of Suri Jagek in the year's list of Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH). The decision was made during the 13th session of UNESCO's Inter-governmental Committee for Safeguarding the Intangible Cultural Heritage in Port Louis, Mauritius. The committee accepted Pakistan's nomination, recognizing Suri Jagek as a vital component of the traditional luni-solar calendar.\n\n\n=== Threats ===\nDespite remaining an oral tradition, younger generations lack awareness of its cultural significance and practical benefits. Community members attribute this to the educational curriculum and pedagogy in schools, which they feel have alienated them from their own cultural heritage.\nDespite their cultural significance, the ancient observatories used for Suri Jagek face threats from increased construction within the Kalasha valleys, putting them at risk. For example, the Suri Jagaekein in Balanguru (Rumbur) and Guru (Birir) villages have been obstructed by structures and trees, making it difficult to observe the rising sun.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Intangible Cultural Heritage elements in Pakistan\nIndian national calendar\nHindu calendar\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Seascale Lifeboat Station is a former Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) lifeboat station, located in the village of Seascale, Cumberland, Cumbria.\nAlso known as Whitehaven No.2 Lifeboat Station, a lifeboat was first stationed here by the RNLI in 1875. After very few launches, and only one successful rescue, the station closed in 1895.\n\n\n== History ==\nFollowing suggestions that for some rescues and conditions, Seascale may be a better place to launch a lifeboat, than from Whitehaven, the village was visited on 29 Aug 1874 by Capt. John Ward, RN, Inspector of Lifeboats. \nHis recommendation was accepted at a meeting of the RNLI Committee of Management. An order for a lifeboat was placed with Forrestt of Limehouse, London. She would be a 32-foot self righting lifeboat with  10-oars and sails (known as a Pulling and Sailing Lifeboat), and cost £273-10s-0d. A carriage cost a further £112-8s-0d.\nA site for a lifeboat house was made available by a local man, A. B. Steward, of Newton Manor, Gosforth, which was located at what is now the entrance to the car-park. The building was constructed by a local builder, G. Torrentine,  and cost £265. The whole cost of the boat, carriage, equipment and station building, said to be £800, was met by the Tomlinson sisters, of The Biggins, Kirkby Lonsdale.\nOn Saturday, 5 June 1875, at a naming ceremony in front of the assembled crowd, many who had travelled down from Whitehaven, the boat was named William Tomlinson by the donors, in memory of their brother. Seascale lifeboat station was formally opened, and James McMinn was appointed Coxswain.\n\n\n== Notable Rescue ==\nAt 1:00 am on 26 October 1875, the Isabella ran aground. It would be dawn before the vessel was seen and the alarm raised, and it would be 8:00 am before a message to alert the lifeboat crew, normally Whitehaven men, and the Whitehaven rocket brigade, was received at Whitehaven.\nWhitehaven Volunteer Rocket Brigade, was formed in 1849. The volunteers would haul their equipment to the coast where a ship was in distress. Rockets attached to a line were fired over the vessel, and then a much heavier cable could be drawn across, allowing the use of a Breeches buoy system to rescue passengers and crew.\nA special train was hastily arranged to transport all the volunteers to Seascale, but along with the rocket brigade, only 5 lifeboat men turned up. Arriving in Seascale at 9:30 am, the Isabella was too far from shore for the Rocket Brigade, so they joined the 5 lifeboat men, and some of the train crew, to man the lifeboat. Arriving at the Isabella at 11:30 am, over 10 hours since she ran aground, the three crewmen were finally rescued, and brought back to shore. And so was completed, the only successful service of the Seascale Lifeboat.\n\n\n== Closure ==\nSeascale lifeboat was launched only three more times over the next twenty years, and nobody was ever rescued. A new lifeboat, Rescue (ON 77) was provided on trial in 1886, a larger 34-foot boat built by Woolfe of Shadwell, named by request of the donor, and became the station boat in 1887. However, with insufficient volunteers in Seascale, and raising and transporting a lifeboat crew from Whitehaven always proving difficult, often a rescue had been completed by the time the lifeboat was ready, on the few occasions it might have been required.\nThe new boat was only launched on service one time. In an ideal world, a lifeboat should never be needed, and that was the fate of the Seascale lifeboat. An RNLI Inspector visited in November 1894, to discover that no shipwrecks had occurred since the introduction of a lightship at Ravenglass. His decision was agreed by RNLI management, and the station was closed on 26 January 1895. The building was sold off for £30 in March 1895. Nothing is known of  what became of the Rescue (ON 77); she never served at any other lifeboat station.\n\n\n== Seascale lifeboats ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of RNLI stations\nList of former RNLI stations\nRoyal National Lifeboat Institution lifeboats\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRNLI station information",

The house has been held by the Bell family for c. 300 years, and since 2021 also hosts a sculpture park.  \n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1722/23 the member of parliament Ralph Bell bought the manor of Thirsk for the sum of £6,300 (equivalent to £1,054,411 in 2021) from the 10th Earl of Derby. At the time the hall was constructed it had two storeys and five bays. Bell lived in the then new-built home, Thirsk Hall, located on Kirkgate next to St Marys Church.  Following his death in 1733 Bell left his estate to his nephew Ralph Consett, who then changed his surname to Bell. Some years later a descendent, also named Ralph Bell, married Ann Conyers.  Conyers, who desired a dining room, financed an extension to the hall in 1770.  The Palladian architect John Carr was employed to add a third floor and two wings.  The house was furnished by Gillows, and the artist Thomas Gainsborough painted portraits of both Bell and Conyers. The ceiling of the ground floor room in the right wing, designed by Carr, has been described as \"very fine\". Thirsk Hall has 20 acres of grounds comprising gardens, parkland, and woodland. \nAs of 2022 the hall continues to be owned by the Bell family. Daisy Bell, eldest daughter of John Bell, inherited the property after being successful in a card game at aged 11, following her fathers eschewing of primogeniture.\n\n\n== Sculpture Park ==\nIn the summer of 2021 the Thirsk Hall Sculpture Park, set in the grounds, was opened to the public. It has showcased the work of both up and coming and established artists, including Michael Lyons and Zak Ové. The park had 3,000 visitors in its first year. In 2023 the park featured the work of stone sculptor Emily Young. An outbuilding of the hall, named Gallery One, features an indoor art gallery.\n\n\n== See also ==\nJohn Bell (Liberal politician) – British Liberal politician, born 1809\nYorkshire Sculpture Park – Art gallery in West Yorkshire, England\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Thirsk Hall at Wikimedia Commons\nwww.thirskhall.com",

        "content": "Any Other Way: The Jackie Shane Story is a Canadian documentary film, directed by Michael Mabbott and Lucah Rosenberg-Lee and released in 2024. The film is a portrait of Jackie Shane, the pioneering transgender singer who was a prominent figure in the Toronto music scene in the 1960s before virtually disappearing from public life after 1971.\nThe film was based in large part on telephone interviews that Mabbott conducted with Shane over the year before her death in 2019. As her death precluded the ability to videotape any new interviews in person, and very little video footage of Shane from the 1960s survives, the producers depict her in the film through the use of animation, generated by superimposing photos of Shane over rotoscoped footage of contemporary drag performer Makayla Couture.\nProduction on the film was announced in 2022.\nThe film premiered at the 2024 SXSW festival, and is slated to have its Canadian premiere at the 2024 Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival. It is also slated to screen as the closing film of the 2024 DOXA Documentary Film Festival.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAny Other Way: The Jackie Shane Story at IMDb",

It was launched in 2024 as part of the merger between the Credit Union National Association (CUNA) and the National Association of Federally-Insured Credit Unions (NAFCU). Once fully operational in 2025, America's Credit Unions will provide its member credit unions with trade association services, such as lobbying, regulatory advocacy, professional development, and professional services management. The organization is headquartered in Washington, D.C.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nOn August 1, 2023, the CUNA and NAFCU boards of directors announced their intent to merge, forming a new entity called America's Credit Unions. The merger was approved by CUNA and NAFCU members and became effective on January 1, 2024, when CUNA and longtime CUNA CEO Jim Nussle is the president and CEO of the new association.\nCUNA and NAFCU will continue to operate as distinct organizations under the America's Credit Unions brand while they combine their operations throughout 2024. In March 2024, the organization announced plans to lay off about a quarter of CUNA's Madison, Wisconsin-based workforce.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCredit Union National Association\nNational Association of Federal Credit Unions\nNational Credit Union Foundation\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Vysoká hole (German: Hohe Heide) is a mountain in the Hrubý Jeseník mountain range in the Czech Republic. It has an elevation of 1,465 m (4,806 ft) above sea level. It is located in the municipality of Malá Morávka, on the historical border between Silesia and Moravia.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe main path passing through the mountain has been known since around 1500. It was used in the past by hunters, shepherds, and later by the military. Already during the Austro-Prussian War in 1866, in July, a group of Austrian partisans led by Alfred von Vivenot hid on the mountain to evade the Prussians. From 1919 to 1922, a Czechoslovak military training area was located on the mountain. During World War II, the German Luftwaffe built a radar station on the mountain, as well as an aerodrome in the spring of 1944, which was left unfinished (traces visible from a bird's-eye view) for small reconnaissance aircraft. Until the 19th century, Vysoká hole was considered the highest peak in the Hrubý Jeseník chain. Only later, more precise height measurements showed the superiority of Praděd.\n\n\n=== Airplane crash ===\nOn 27 February 1950, at 7:31 GMT, a plane crash occurred involving a Czechoslovak Airlines' Douglas DC-3 passenger aircraft under the command of Captain Václav Soukup flying from Ostrava to Prague. On board were 4 crew members and 27 passengers. In difficult weather conditions (fog, drizzle, strong wind, and low temperature), the plane crashed into the mountain. Thanks to the rescue operation carried out by the Mountain Rescue Service of the Czech Republic in the Hrubý Jeseník mountains, founded in 1948 under the leadership of its founder Václav Myšák with the assistance of military paratroopers, during which the injured were transported to the Ovčárna mountain hut and hospitals in Bruntál and Rýmařov, 25 passengers and 1 crew member were rescued. The cause of the crash was determined to be pilot error: failure to comply with the recommended minimum flight altitude and deviation from the planned flight route due to navigation errors in difficult weather conditions.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nVysoká hole is the second highest mountain (after Praděd) in Czech Silesia, Moravia, and in the Hrubý Jeseník mountain range. It is a very extensive mountain with a flat and leveled mountaintop plateau (approximately 20 ha (49 acres)), located about 2.5 km (1.6 mi) south of Praděd, lying on its main ridge extending from the Červenohorské sedlo pass to the Skřítek pass. It is a massive mountain with an almost level-shaped summit area.\nThe mountain is bordered by the U Barborky pass and the valley of the Bílá Opava stream to the north, by a pass at an altitude of 1,018 m (3,340 ft) above sea level towards the Hradečná summit to the east, by the valley of the stream Bělokamenný potok and passes at altitudes of 1,206 m (3,957 ft) above sea level towards the Temná summit and 1,208 m (3,963 ft) above sea level towards the Ráztoka summit to the southeast, and by the Kamzičník summit and the valley of the Divoká Desná stream to the southwest. Numerous summits surround it: Petrovy kameny to the north, Ostrý vrch and Hradečná to the northeast, U pecí to the east, Temná and Ráztoká to the southeast, Kamzičník to the south, and Nad soutokem, Zámčisko to the southwest.\n\n\n=== Slopes ===\n\nGenerally, four main slopes of the mountain can be distinguished:\n\nwestern slope, extending from the summit plateau to the Nad soutokem mountain, bounded by two couloirs named Sviní žleb (from the north) and Medvědí důl (from the south), very steep with an average gradient reaching up to 45° over a 50-meter section;\nnortheastern slope, extending towards a pass located at an altitude of 1,018 m (3,340 ft) above sea level towards the Hradečná mountain, bounded by the valley of the Bílá Opava stream from the north;\neastern slope named Dlouhý vrch, the longest (approximately 4.8 km (3.0 mi)), extending towards the U pecí mountain, bounded by the valley of the Bělokamenný potok stream from the south;\nsoutheastern slope, extending towards a pass located at an altitude of 1,206 m (3,957 ft) above sea level towards the Temná mountain.\nOn some maps, an additional summit named Suť (1,224 m (4,016 ft) above sea level) appears on the northeastern slope of the mountain. However, due to the low differentiation and exposure of this summit compared to the slope, newer studies and measurements suggest assigning this name to a part of the slope\nThe slopes of the mountain display overgrown grassy craters (up to 10 m (33 ft) in diameter and 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) deep) from artillery exercises in 1919–1922 and possibly from bomb explosions during World War II. All slopes (except designated hiking trails) are covered by a network of roads (including Ovčárenská silnice, Jelení cesta) and paths. It is recommended to use detailed maps for navigation while traversing them.\nThe slopes have gentle, relatively uniform, and undifferentiated gradients. The average gradient of the slopes varies from 11° (western slope) to 8° (northeastern and eastern slopes). The overall average gradient of all slopes of the mountain (weighted average gradient) is approximately 9°. The maximum average gradient of the western slope near the Sviní žleb ravine over a 50-meter section does not exceed 45°.\nBelow an altitude of approximately 1,300–1,350 m (4,270–4,430 ft) above sea level, all slopes are predominantly forested with spruce trees. Above these altitudes, there are non-forested areas mostly covered by alpine meadows. In the cirque (Velký kotel basin), due to varied environmental conditions and a variable microclimate, alpine, subalpine, rocky, thermophilic, spring, and wetland vegetation coexist alongside various types of forest vegetation. Additionally, some slopes feature rocky outcrops (on the northeastern slope, near the Bílá Opava valley at altitudes around 1,095–1,140 m (3,593–3,740 ft) above sea level, and on the southeastern slope, near the Velký kotel basin at altitudes of 1,246–1,310 m (4,088–4,298 ft) above sea level).\n\n\n=== Main summit ===\n\nThere are no marked hiking trails leading to the main summit. It is located amidst a plateau covered with alpine grass. The highest point of the mountain, at an altitude of 1,464.8 m (4,806 ft) above sea level, has geographic coordinates 50°03′45.48″N 17°14′08.17″E. On maps, another location recognized as the summit of the mountain is indicated, namely the main triangulation station of the mountain, marked on geodetic maps with the number 35 at an altitude of 1,463.67 m (4,802.1 ft) above sea level and geographic coordinates 50°03′43.68″N 17°14′11.11″E, marked with concrete circles for better location (the poles next to it have been broken), located about 87 m (285 ft) southeast of the main summit. The summit plateau is a prominent scenic viewpoint offering far-reaching perspectives.\nThe approximate approach to the main summit is from the red hiking trail, from which an indistinct, unmarked overgrown path leads through the summit plateau. Towards the Petrovy kameny peak, there is a pass called Sedlo u Petrových kamenů, located at an altitude of 1,432 m (4,698 ft) above sea level.\n\n\n=== Secondary summit ===\nVysoká hole is a mountain with a double summit. At a distance of about 575 m (1,886 ft) southwest of the main summit, a secondary summit can be distinguished, designated as Vysoká hole–JZ, with the same height as the main summit – 1,465 m (4,806 ft) above sea level, prominence of 4 m (13 ft), and geographic coordinates 50°03′31.04″N 17°13′49.43″E. At this location, there is a secondary triangulation station marked on geodetic maps with the number 211, at an altitude of 1,464.66 m (4,805.3 ft) above sea level, with two steel poles mounted nearby, located about 150 m (490 ft) southwest of the wooden hut at the tourist stop called Vysoká hole.\nBoth summit plateaus are connected by a main path, along which the red hiking trail runs, and by the highest, but less prominent (4 meters), pass of the Hrubý Jeseník chain at an altitude of 1,461 m (4,793 ft) above sea level. The plateau of the secondary summit is an outstanding scenic viewpoint offering views of the surrounding peaks and mountain ranges.\n\n\n=== Geology ===\nFrom a geological perspective, Vysoká hole mountain belongs to a unit known as the Vrbno layers and is composed of:\n\nmetamorphic rocks, primarily blasto-mylonites, gneisses, phyllites, phyllonites (containing muscovite, biotite, and chlorite), greenschists;\nsedimentary rocks, primarily quartzites;\nigneous rocks, primarily meta-granitoids.\n\n\n=== Waters ===\nThe main ridge of the Praděd mountain, running from the Skřítek pass to the Červenohorské sedlo pass and further to the Ramzovské Sedlo pass, is part of the European watershed between the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea drainage basins.\nThe mountain lies on this boundary, with the Baltic Sea basin (Oder river basin) on its eastern, northeastern, and southeastern slopes, and the Black Sea basin (Danube river basin) on its western slope. On the southeastern slope of the mountain, the Moravice river has its source, while the Bělokamenný Potok stream originates on the eastern slope, and the Desná river on the western slope.\n\n\n== Nature preservation ==\n\nThe entire flattened mountain top and the upper parts of its slopes are surrounded by the Praděd National Nature Reserve, established in 1991 and covering an area of approximately 2,031 ha (5,020 acres). This reserve was formed by merging six separate reserves: Petrovy kameny, Velká kotlina, Malá kotlina, Vrchol Pradědu, Divoký důl, and Bílá Opava. It is part of the protected area called the Jeseníky Protected Landscape Area, created to protect rock formations, terrain, vegetation, and rare animal species. On the southeastern slope of the mountain lies the Velká kotlina nature reserve.\n\n\n=== Educational trails ===\nTo protect the unique ecosystem within the reserve, the Velká kotlina educational trail was established in 1971 along the blue hiking trail, with a length of 5.5 km (3.4 mi) from Karlov pod Pradědem to Nad Ovčárnou, with 7 observation posts along the route.\nAdditionally, another educational trail was marked along the main ridge in 2009, called Naučná stezka Po hřebenech – světem horských luk trail. It spans 12 km (7.5 mi) from Ovčárna to Skřítek and includes twelve observation points along the route.\n\n\n=== Velká kotlina valley ===\n\nThe Velká kotlina valley, which is part of the Praděd National Nature Reserve, formes the most valuable botanical clusters in the Sudetes, the Czech Republic, and even in Central Europe as a whole, with numerous rare plant species. On the southeastern slope of the mountain, there is a cirque characterized by steep walls, rocky outcrops, couloirs, and small streams cascading down, forming small waterfalls. The area is home to both mountain and lowland vegetation, including tundra plants, warm-loving plants, and spring vegetation, totaling around 450 species (some unique). Notable species include wolf's-bane, garden monkshood, Adenostyles alliariae, green spleenwort, alpine aster, alpine lady-fern, bistort, Calamagrostis arundinacea, Calamagrostis villosa, bearded bellflower, Buxbaum's sedge, stemless carline thistle, alpine sow-thistle, Conioselinum tataricum, common spotted orchid, alpine delphinium, fringed pink, yellow foxglove, Doronicum austriacum, round-leaved sundew, common cottongrass, Euphrasia picta, Festuca varia, spotted gentian, Omalotheca norvegica, fragrant orchid, alpine sainfoin, fox-and-cubs, Hypochaeris uniflora, Juncus trifidus, martagon lily, marsh grass of Parnassu, common butterwort, alpine meadow-grass, northern hollyfern, large-flowered selfheal, large white buttercup, golden root, Sedum alpestre, Thesium alpinum, round headed orchid, alpine bulrush, chickweed-wintergreen, Trollius altissimus, false helleborine or Viola lutea.\nGerman botanist of Polish origin, Henryk Emanuel Grabowski, made significant contributions to exploring the charm of the reserve. The reserve is also home to many valuable and protected animals, including chamois, which was introduced here from the Alps in 1913. Velká kotlina is an area where snow Avalanches may occur during snowy periods, and the snow cover can last until almost June.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nWithin the mountain itself, there are no mountain huts or hotels. A key tourist point on the mountain is the tourist crossroads located approximately 560 m (1,840 ft) northeast of the summit, called Nad Ovčárnou, with an indicated elevation of 1,368 m (4,488 ft). This crossroads serves as a junction for hiking trails and educational paths.\n\n\n=== Boundary marker ===\n\nVysoká hole is located on the historical border between Silesia and Moravia, marked by a sandstone boundary marker standing about 430 m (1,410 ft) southwest of the summit, dating back to 1681. This marker also marked the borders of three feudal estates that converged here: the Teutonic Order from Bruntál, the Velké Losiny estate, and the Janovice estate.\n\n\n=== Hunting huts ===\nTwo huts are located on the slopes of the mountain, but they do not have the character of typical mountain huts. They are classified as so-called hunting huts.\n\n\n=== Hiking trails ===\nThe Czech Tourist Club has established four hiking trails within the mountain on trails:\n\nRed trail: Červenohorské sedlo – Velký Klínovec mountain – Hřebenová pass – Výrovka summit – Sedlo pod Malým Jezerníkem pass – Malý Jezerník summit – Velký Jezerník mountain – Sedlo Velký Jezerník pass – Švýcárna mountain hut – Praděd mountain – U Barborky pass – Petrovy kameny mountain – Ovčárna – Sedlo u Petrových kamenů pass – Vysoká hole mountain – Vysoká hole–JZ summit – Kamzičník summit – Velký Máj mountain – Sedlo nad Malým kotlem pass – Jelení hřbet mountain – Jelení studánka – Sedlo pod Jelení studánkou pass – Jelenka mountain – Ostružná mountain – Rýmařov\nYellow trail: Karlova Studánka – Bílá Opava stream valley – Ostrý vrch mountain – waterfalls of Bílá Opava – Petrovy kameny mountain – Ovčárna – Vysoká hole mountain – Temná mountain – Kopřivná mountain – Karlov pod Pradědem – Malá Morávka\nGreen trail: Kouty nad Desnou – Hřbety mountain – Nad Petrovkou mountain – Kamzík – Velký Jezerník mountain – Sedlo Velký Jezerník pass – Švýcárna mountain hut – Praděd mountain – Petrovy kameny mountain – Ovčárna – Vysoká hole mountain – Hradečná mountain – Karlova Studánka\nBlue trail: Karlova Studánka – Bílá Opava valley – Ostrý vrch mountain – Barborka mountain hut – U Barborky pass – Petrovy kameny mountain – Ovčárna – Vysoká hole mountain – Velká kotlina – Moravice river valley – Karlov pod Pradědem – Malá Morávka\n\n\n=== Cycling routes ===\nA cycling route also passes through the northeastern slope of the mountain on the route:\n Červenohorské sedlo – Velký Klínovec mountain – Výrovka mountain – Kamzík – Velký Jezerník mountain – Sedlo Velký Jezerník pass – Švýcárna mountain hut – Praděd mountain – U Barborky pass – Petrovy kameny mountain – Ovčárna – Vysoká hole mountain – Hradečná mountain – Hvězda pass\n Hvězda pass – Praděd: (length: 9.1 km, altitude difference: 632 m, average ascent gradient: 6,9%)\n\n\n=== Cross-country skiing routes ===\nDuring snowy periods, three cross-country skiing routes set by the mountain can be used:\n Hvězda pass – Hradečná mountain – Vysoká hole mountain – Temná mountain – Jelení cesta\n Hvězda pass – Hradečná mountain – Vysoká hole mountain – Temná mountain – Kopřivná mountain – Karlov pod Pradědem – Malá Morávka\nIn addition, an educational trail (Czech: NS Po hřebenech - světem horských luk), the so-called Jesenická magistrála, runs along the main path.\nNear the Sedlo u Petrových kamenů pass, four pistes of varying degrees of difficulty are located with two platter lifts:\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBanaszkiewicz, Piotr; Parzewski, Jerzy (2019).

Snow melt caused freshets resulting in the Orsk Dam collapsing. In Russia, a federal emergency was declared. Hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated including 16,000 people in Kazakhstan. At least eight people died and hundreds of livestock have drowned in floods that are described to have inundated an area the size of western Europe.\n\n\n== Impact ==\n\n\n=== Kazakhstan ===\nThe Ministry of Emergency Situations said on 10 April that it had evacuated 96,472 people, including 31,640 children, affected by the floods, which struck the western and northern parts of the country, including the cities of Aktobe and Petropavlovsk, as well as the regions of Atyrau, Aktobe, Akmola, Kostanay, East Kazakhstan, Northern Kazakhstan and Pavlodar.\n\n\n=== Russia ===\nFlooding occurred in Orenburg, Tomsk, Tyumen and Kurgan Oblasts, which border Kazakhstan. The flooding was worsened by the collapse of a dam near Orsk on 5 April. Several major river systems have seen their water levels rise, including the Ural River, which flows through Russia and Kazakhstan before entering the Caspian Sea, and the Tobol and Ishim Rivers, both of which are tributaries of the Irtysh River.\nApart from the Orsk Dam, several other dams in the affected areas failed due to heavy rains and increased volumes of water, including one in Novotroitsk, Orenburg Oblast, and another along the Tom River near Tomsk.\nThe Russian government has not confirmed any fatalities. On 17 April, the Russian investigative news outlet iStories reported that seven people had died from the floods in Orenburg Oblast, citing relatives of the victims who also accused authorities of withholding the circumstances of their deaths to avoid making compensation payments.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Kansas City, Fort Scott and Memphis Railroad (“KCFS&M”) was a railway system which, at its maximum extent, operated across Kansas, Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama and Oklahoma, a total of over 881 miles (1,418 kilometres).  Its predecessor company started in 1865, and another railroad assumed ownership in 1928.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Kansas and Neosho Valley Railroad ===\nThe railway system began as the Kansas and Neosho Valley Railroad in March 1865.  The original ambitious plans called for the line to extend south from Kansas City along the Neosho Valley of eastern Kansas, through what was then Indian Territory (now Oklahoma), and continue to the Gulf of Mexico.  Trackage from Kansas City to Olathe, Kansas, a distance of 21 miles, was built by December 1868.\n\n\n=== Missouri River, Fort Scott & Gulf Railroad ===\nHowever, before the railroad even reached Olathe, its ownership had changed, and its name had become the Missouri River, Fort Scott & Gulf Railroad (“MRFS&G”).  Its objective did not change, and the railway built another 100 miles to Fort Scott, Kansas, arriving by December 1869.\nTo secure the right to cross Indian Territory, the MRFS&G was in a race to be the first railway to reach the Indian Territory border.  However, it made the decision to accept financial incentives from the town of Baxter Springs, Kansas to build to that location, arriving by May 1870.  The line at this point was about 160 miles in total length.  However, the detour cost the railroad the race to the border, and hence the dream of transiting Indian Territory to the Gulf.  Still, the railroad system did later make some minor inroads into Indian Territory, with the Kansas City, Fort Scott and Memphis Railroad building to Miami, Oklahoma in 1896, and the Kansas City, Fort Scott and Memphis Railway extending this line to Afton, Oklahoma in 1901.\n\n\n=== Kansas City, Fort Scott, and Gulf Railroad ===\nThe MRFS&G was reorganized in 1879.  It was combined with several minor branch lines and changed names to become the Kansas City, Fort Scott, and Gulf Railroad.  Its trains proceeded to reach Springfield, Missouri from Fort Scott, but did so via leased lines.\n\n\n=== Kansas City, Springfield and Memphis Railroad ===\nA subsidiary called the Kansas City, Springfield and Memphis Railroad, incorporated March 31, 1883, constructed a line from Springfield to the west bank of the Mississippi River across from Memphis, Tennessee, arriving in the 1883 timeframe.  However, without a bridge over the river to Memphis, train traffic had to be ferried into town.\n\n\n=== Kansas City, Memphis and Birmingham Railroad ===\nOn April 10, 1886, the system acquired the remnants of several failed attempts to construct a line from Memphis to Birmingham, Alabama, including actual construction from Memphis to Holly Springs, Mississippi.  These assets were added to its Kansas City, Memphis and Birmingham Railroad subsidiary.  That company got the line to Birmingham, and opened it for business on October 17, 1887.\n\n\n=== Consolidation into the KCFS&M ===\nThe Kansas City, Fort Scott and Memphis Railroad Company was incorporated in Kansas on April 20, 1888.  A subsidiary of the Kansas City, Fort Scott, and Gulf Railroad, it was a consolidation of The Kansas City, Fort Scott and Springfield Railroad together with the Kansas City, Springfield and Memphis Railroad.\nThe KCFS&M started construction on a grand bridge over the Mississippi to Memphis on November 7, 1888, and completed it on April 6, 1892.  Originally known as the Memphis Bridge, that bridge today is known as the Frisco Bridge and has been designated as a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark.\nAt this point, the main line of the KCFS&M extended from Kansas City through Fort Scott, Springfield, and the state of Arkansas to Memphis, and then through the state of Mississippi to Birmingham.  Ultimately, taking into account subsidiaries, the branch to Oklahoma, and other trackage, this railroad system came to own 881.19 miles (1,418.14 kilometres) of road.  The whole system came to be known as the “Memphis Route.”\n\n\n=== Kansas City, Fort Scott and Memphis Railway ===\nTechnically, the KCFS&M made one further corporate change, when on August 12, 1901, it was sold to the Kansas City, Fort Scott and Memphis Railway incorporated June 14, 1901.  The St. Louis-San Francisco Railway (known as the “Frisco”) had purchased a controlling interest that year, and on August 23, 1901, the whole system was leased to the Frisco.  But the Frisco did not assume formal ownership of the system until September 1, 1928.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of predecessors of the Kansas City, Fort Scott and Memphis Railway\n\n\n== References ==",

Later in 2017, Ninyakanon lost the franchise to another local organizer Nanmanat Wuttipattarapakorn (นันท์มนัส วุฒิภัทรปกรณ์), who organized the first Miss Grand Ranong competition on 13 May 2017, in which a Saint John's University's student, Lalita Hongsamat, was named the winner.The pageant was skipped once; in 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand, the national organizer was unable to organize the national event, and the country representative for the international tournament was appointed instead.\nWinner gallery\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Editions ==\nThe following table details Miss Grand Ranong's annual editions since 2016.\n\nNotes\n\n\n== National competition ==\nThe following is a list of Ranong representatives who competed at the Miss Grand Thailand pageant.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Miss Grand Ranong at Wikimedia Commons\nMiss Grand Thailand official website",

However, due to the lack of team competitions in the former Soviet Republics, several teams continued to participate in the league, most notably Lokomotiv Daugavpils of Latvia and the Rivne club of Ukraine.\nFrom 2017 only four teams have competed in the highest division of the championship.\nFrom 2022, the competition was somewhat isolated following the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme ban on Russian and Belarusian motorcycle riders, teams, officials, and competitions as a result of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\n== Past winners ==\n\n\n=== Soviet Union (1962-1992) ===\n\n\n=== Russia ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nSoviet Union national speedway team\nRussia national speedway team\nRussian Individual Speedway Championship\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "American rapper Azealia Banks has developed a reputation for disputes with several public figures on social media, particularly Twitter, with Complex noting that \"she gets more attention for her public feuds than she does for her music\".\nAzealia Banks has feuds with many people and organizations.\n\n\n== Feuds between celebrities ==\n\n\n=== Beyoncé ===\nFollowing the release of Beyoncé's visual album Lemonade in April 2016, Banks tweeted that she didn't enjoy the album, and criticized Beyoncé, saying \"She's purposefully strayed away from political discourse her entire career to make sure she didn't alienate white ppl. And now that black women's suffering is a national conversation, she wants to hop on it and make our suffering 'trendy'…she needs to stay under Jay-Z's foot where she belongs, and stay out of the creative woman's way.\"\nIn 2024, Banks criticized the cover and title of Beyoncé's then-upcoming album, Cowboy Carter. \"Wow we didn't even try to put even a little effort into a more artistic title?\" she wrote on Instagram. \"How u switch from baobab trees and black parade to this literal pick me stuff.\" She went on to accuse her of being in \"white woman cosplay\" and \"reinforcing the false rhetoric that country music is a post civil war white art form. And subsequently reinforcing the idea that there is no racism, segregation, slavery, violence, theft, massacres, plagues, manifest destiny craziness that form the bedrock of epithets like 'proud to be an American,' or 'god bless the usa.'\".\n\n\n=== Iggy Azalea ===\nIn 2013, Banks wrote on Twitter, \"Iggy Azalea on the XXL freshman list is all wrong. How can you endorse a white woman who calls herself a runaway slave master?! In any capacity *kanye shrug*.\" Azalea, said in response to Banks' statement, \"This is the thing. But this my day and it's my achievement. You have to work to have your own achievements, with all due respect. So, instead of worrying about who else is on there. You should just be happy I'm on there as a women, for women. And if you want to have an achievement, work, and earn your own achievements. I can't take what's meant for you and you can't take what's meant for me.\"\n\n\n=== Kreayshawn ===\nIn 2012, Banks lashed out on Kreayshawn for retweeting 212 from a pornographic website. Tweeting, \"You think you're funny? You're a dumb bitch. And you can't rap. I'll sit on your face... fall back slut.\" Kreayshawn replied \"Huh? What did I do to you? I've been listening to your music all month. Strange. Stranger!\" before deleting the tweet and tweeting \"Did I just get smashed on twitter because I was supporting a fellow female? I sure did... *confused*\"  \n\n\n=== Lana Del Rey ===\nIn 2018, Banks criticized Del Rey for her comments regarding Kanye West's 13th Amendment controversy. West posted a tweet last week that showed him appearing to be on a private plane while wearing a \"Make America Great Again\" cap and wrote, \"This represents good and America becoming whole again\" before launching into his thoughts about the amendment and slavery. Del Rey responded in the comments on West's official Instagram account. \"Trump becoming our president was a loss for the country but your support of him is a loss for the culture,\" she wrote. \"I can only assume you relate to his personality on some level. Delusions of Grandeur, extreme issues of narcissism – none of which would be a talking point if we weren't speaking about the man leading our country. Banks didn't appreciate Del Rey's comments and tweeted when asked about them. \"Wow okay Lana, this would be cute if you were consistent with your outrage and refused to collab with ASAP rocky who has physically assaulted women too,\" Banks tweeted. \"To me this just looks like the typical White woman taking using a weakened target to 'pretend' to be an ally.\"\n\n\n=== Marina Diamandis ===\nIn 2013, Banks got into a twitter feud with Welsh singer Marina Diamandis (known by her stage name at the time as Marina & the Diamonds, now known by the mononym Marina). Diamandis tweeted \"All your personality goes on Twitter. IRL you have nothing left to give.\" Though no names were mentioned, Banks quickly came onto twitter to address the tweet. She posted \"Lol I see this one thirsty singer from the UK sub-tweet about me all the time. \"She better shut up before I steal her look & sound.\" followed by \"Bitches think they’re clever and rude, but trust me, I’m ruder. I can’t stand a scared bitch.”\n\n\n=== Rihanna ===\nIn 2017, Banks posted about Rihanna on Instagram, calling into question the singer's immigration status and criticizing her tweets which criticized then-President Trump's executive order to ban citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S.\n\"As far as Rihanna (who isn't a citizen, and can't vote) and all the rest of the celebrities who are using their influence to stir the public, you lot really REALLY need to shut up and sit down,\" Banks wrote.\nRihanna subtly replied to Banks' attack. \"The face you make when you a immigrant,\" she wrote in the caption. The singer also referenced Banks' alleged sacrificing of live chickens using the hashtags #stayawayfromthechickens, #iheartnuggets and #saveourhens.\n\n\n=== RuPaul ===\nIn 2018, Banks fired at drag queen and TV personality RuPaul, accusing him of plagiarizing The Big Big Beat with the 2017 song \"Call Me Mother.\" Banks tweeted “You will not step on my little black girl toes bitch. You will take your razor bumps and pumps to the nearest laser hair removal clinic and seethe. @RuPaul BYE UGLY” before calming that she was filing claims against him. This altercation would cause his corresponding album American to be temporarily removed from Spotify.\n\n\n=== Skai Jackson ===\nIn 2016, Banks got into a spat with then 14 year old Skai Jackson after the actress tweeted out \"Azealia Banks needs to simmer down a little.\" in defense of Zayn Malik. Banks didn't take lightly to this, replying \"and you need to grow some hips and start ur menses. stay in a child's place.\" Banks would then reply, “LOL, says the Disney Channel Reject. … You know they don’t like girls your color. Enjoy while it lasts, ur mom’s been pimping you out to disney since you were a lil girl. lets see what you end up like at 21. bye !\" Jackson would end the feud, tweeting \"I had a career before Disney and I’m sure I will after! And I know I won’t turn out like you bitter and miserable! Fix ur life … and I’m sure my mom did a wayyy better job then yours did! You give black woman a bad name. I’ll be praying for you.\"\n\n\n=== Wendy Williams ===\nIn 2017, Banks' found herself embroiled in a feud with talk show host Wendy Williams after the host chimed in on the feud between Banks and Remy Ma. During the segment, Williams insinuated that Banks was doing prostitution to raise money for vaginal rejuvenation. \"Now we understand how she gets her money, she’s got no kids and she’s 26, with a vaginal rejuvenation? Wow. she works hard for her money.\" Banks made claims that these comments made her cry and accused Williams of bullying. \"Wendy Williams accuses Azealia Banks of prostituiton???????????????????? This is a whole new low.. I'm legitimately in tears. This hurt the type of shit that becomes acceptable to say to azealia banks is nuts.\"\nIn 2018, Williams would once again discuss Banks' antics on her show, this time talking about the Wild 'n Out situation. \"She seems to be smart, but angry. Her anger seems to be the problem, I'm not familiar with her music, I'm just familiar with her anger.\" Banks' would take to her Instagram story to make reference to Williams passing out on air in October of 2017. \"Omg can Wendy Williams have another stroke on TV and finally drop dead? I would love to see her die on air.\"\n\n\n=== Zayn Malik ===\nIn 2016, Banks was dropped as a headliner of the Born & Bred Festival in London after she tweeted about Zayn Malik and his newly released \"Like I Would\" video, which she claimed was similar to some of her previous videos and outfits. She started out playfully, tweeting, \"Damn Zayn be mood boarding the f— out of me… I'm not mad about this though. Zayn is a cutie pie.\" The trolling expanded to include the Capital Breakfast show in London, who Banks criticized for tweeting at her that they were playing Malik's music.\n\n\n== Feuds between organizations and companies ==\n\n\n=== Wild N Out Episode ===\nIn 2018, Banks appeared on Wild N Out and shortly after filming accused the cast of preplanning colorist jokes and making her cry. One July 15, 2018, Banks posted on instagram \"I did Wildin’ out today. There were tons of pre-planned colorist jokes and of course …. cry baby cried. Some little scrawny black Atlanta twink was prepared for me. They planned this – hit me on short notice, told me I didn’t have to participate in the coon ass freestyle battles, (not my style) and I was to sing my song and go home\".\nNick Cannon would make a cryptic post on instagram, saying \"Don’t you hate when you create your own storms but forget your umbrella??? @azealiabanks We are praying for you Queen #speedyrecovery #Healing. She #Wildnout for real #Karma,” He would later on claim the reaction was due to self-hatred and self-hurt, stating, \"She probably has had those problems and insecurities of being a darker complexion woman. And in her community, cause she often talks about dating white men and all that stuff, she’s probably not looked at as beautiful to her other peers.”\n\n\n== Against countries and nationalities ==\n\n\n=== Australia ===\nTowards the end of 2022, Banks cancelled a show in Brisbane just hours before she was due to go on stage, citing a past concert in the city where a member of the audience threw a bottle at her as \"the most racist, most demoralizing experience of my fucking life\". She has also vowed to never return to Australia on tour. \"This place makes me utterly miserable and I'm too black and beautiful to have a bunch of white people in my face playing with me over their WEAK ASS CURRENCY,\" she said.\nBanks claimed that \"the Australian music industry and Australian culture is so trash\" because of the country's \"historical post colonial obsession\" with \"trying to prove to England and the Monarchy\" that they \"were in fact a proper white/Anglo-saxon society\".\n\n\n=== Brazil ===\nIn 2017, Banks' Facebook account was suspended or deleted after she posted that the people of Brazil had to eat farofa, which translates to crumbs, which sparked outraged from Brazilians.\n\n\n=== Ireland ===\nIn 2019, Banks posted that Irish people should be quarantined and mocked the 19th-century Great Famine in Ireland. Writing to one follower, she said: \"'Don't you have a famine to go die in?\" In another post, she wrote \"You lot are a bunch of prideful inbred leprechauns who have ZERO global influence and ZERO white privilege.\"\n\n\n=== Israel ===\nIn 2018, Banks tweeted that she experienced widespread racism after performing in Israel and vowed to never return, unless \"it's for some real money.\" She said that from the time she boarded the El Al flight to Israel, people mistreated her due to racism.\n\n\n=== Russia ===\nIn 2020, Banks got into an altercation with Dasha Nekrasova, which escalated to her arguing with Russian twitter accounts. She tweeted \"Russian cuisine is some of the worst most barbaric peasant food I've ever seen. Please go eat some deer cheeks and beets and go wash your ass in the town well.\" She later doubled down, tweeting \"People in Russia experience hunger every 10-15 years. How can you say that I am poor, when lack of food is integral part of the Russian cuisine” followed by \"And before posting another racial comment, please, remember that the Russians practiced cannibalism less than a century ago. Please leave, while you still can\" \n\n\n== Lawsuits ==\n\n\n=== Elon Musk and Tesla ===\nAzealia Banks has been subpoenaed in a lawsuit against Tesla and Elon Musk. Banks confirmed to Business Insider that she was subpoenaed this week, after posting a photograph of the document on her Instagram. Banks is being subpoenaed by attorneys for plaintiffs in a class action lawsuit against Musk and Tesla. The lawsuit, filed by Tesla investors in 2018, alleges that Musk made false and misleading statements when he tweeted that funding was \"secured\" to take Tesla private at $420 a share in 2018.\n\n\n=== Bouncer asssault charge ===\nIn December 2015, Banks was charged with assault after an altercation at the Up & Down nightclub in New York. Banks allegedly cursed out a female bouncer who didn't recognize her, then punched and bit her when the woman removed her from the club.\nBanks pled guilty to third-degree assault in exchange for a deferred no-jail sentence in March 2017 over the incident.\n\n\n=== Royalties dispute with her ex–label CEO ===\nIn June 2020, she asked the actor and former N.W.A. member for help getting royalties she claimed were owed her by veteran entertainment executive Jeff Kwatinetz in his role as CEO of Prospect Park, the label and management company that released Banks' influential debut album, 2014's Broke With Expensive Taste. According to Kwatinetz, Banks started ranting against him and Prospect Park in June 2020 with \"blatantly false claims\" alleging he was withholding royalties. \"Banks' claims run the gamut of the absurd and could easily be ignored and written off as the rantings of a lunatic, but her recent rants took an ominous and dangerous turn,\" his complaint states.\n\n\n== Witchcraft and Zoosadism ==\n\n\n=== Sacrificed chickens ===\nBanks posted an Instagram story on Thursday showing her cleaning up what looks to be the mess that comes with keeping (and possibly sacrificing) chickens in the closet for magical purposes. Donning a face mask and equipped with a power sander, the rapper got to work removing a heavy coat of feathers and more. In the since-deleted Instagram clip, Banks can be seen wearing safety goggles and a bandanna as she prepares to clean her blood-stained kill closet.\n\n\n=== Cooking a dead cat ===\nBanks took to Instagram to share a video, which was quickly deleted, featuring her and an unknown person digging up the buried cat as she laughed in the background and made up a rap about it. According to Banks, the seemingly horrific act was akin to taxidermy. The 29-year-old rapper says she was actually cleaning the cat, whose name was \"Lucifer,\" to prepare to take him with her to Florida. She also plans to have his skull gilded. In subsequent posts, Banks compared the cleaning ritual to those found in Catholicism, Christianity and Judaism, before adding that she was \"heartbroken\" when the cat died.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Jeremy Hunt has served as Chancellor of the Exchequer of the United Kingdom since his appointment on 14 October 2022. His tenure has so far been dominated by the cost of living crisis, and the global energy crisis. Hunt has served under two prime ministers during his tenure, Liz Truss until 25 October, and Rishi Sunak from 25 October.\nHunt was appointed chancellor by prime minister Liz Truss, amid a government crisis, after Kwasi Kwarteng was dismissed as chancellor on 14 October, after 38 days in post. Within days, Hunt announced the reversal of the majority of Kwarteng's tax cuts in a televised statement. The announcement was described as \"the biggest U-turn in British economic history\". Following the resignation of Liz Truss on 25 October, Hunt remained chancellor after Rishi Sunak became prime minister.\nDuring his time as chancellor, Hunt has delivered two Autumn Statements, and two Budgets to the House of Commons.\n\n\n== Appointment ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\n\nLiz Truss became Prime Minister on 6 September 2022, following the resignation of Boris Johnson. Hunt ran in the leadership election to replace Johnson as Conservative party leader and prime minister, but was eliminated in the first round of voting on 13 July, receiving 18 votes. He endorsed Rishi Sunak after being eliminated. Truss chose Kwasi Kwarteng as Chancellor of the Exchequer, with Hunt having no cabinet position, and remaining in the backbenches.\nOn 23 September 2022, Kwarteng delivered the 2022 mini-budget, which contained a set of economic policies and tax cuts such as bringing forward the planned cut in the basic rate of income tax from 20% to 19%; abolishing the highest (45%) rate of income tax in England, Wales and Northern Ireland; reversing a plan announced in March 2021 to increase corporation tax from 19% to 25% from April 2023; reversing the April 2022 increase in National Insurance; and cancelling the proposed Health and Social Care Levy.\nFollowing the mini-budget, the pound sterling fell sharply in response to the government's planned spending increases and tax cuts, losing 3% against the US dollar and dropping below $1.09. It also fell 0.75% against the euro. On 26 September, sterling reached an all-time low against the dollar, dropping to $1.0327, its lowest since Decimal Day in 1971. On 13 October, Sky News reported that discussions were underway in Downing Street about reversing some of the measures announced in the mini-budget.\n\n\n=== Appointment as Chancellor ===\n\nOn 14 October 2022, Truss dismissed Kwarteng as chancellor after 38 days in office, having summoned him back to the UK from a meeting of finance ministers in Washington in order to fire him. Later that evening, she appointed Hunt as the new chancellor. Chris Philp was also replaced by Edward Argar as Chief Secretary to the Treasury.\nSean O'Grady of The Independent, suggested Hunt's appointment had effectively made him a de facto prime minister, a view echoed by the newspaper's chief political editor, John Rentoul. But Hunt insisted that Truss was still in charge of her government.\nOn 17 October, Hunt announced the reversal of the majority of Kwarteng's tax cuts in a televised statement, arguing that \"at a time when markets are rightly demanding commitment to sustainable public finances, it is not right to borrow to fund this tax cut\". The measures announced by Hunt would lead to an annual saving of £32bn. The only tax cuts from the mini-budget to remain were the cuts to national insurance contributions and the raising of the stamp duty threshold. Plans to scrap the Health and Social Levy would also go ahead because the legislation relating to that was already going through Parliament. Responding to the announcement, Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said \"An arsonist is still an arsonist, even if he runs back into a burning building with a bucket of water\". Faisal Islam described the announcement as \"the biggest U-turn in British economic history\".\n\nTruss announced her resignation as Conservative party leader and prime minister on 20 October, triggering a leadership election. Following Rishi Sunak's appointment as prime minister, it was confirmed that Hunt would continue as Chancellor.\n\n\n== Tenure ==\n\n\n=== Appointment of economic advisors ===\nOn the day of his appointment as chancellor, Hunt appointed four economic advisors to a panel to advise him: Karen Ward (a former top advisor to Philip Hammond), Rupert Harrison, Gertjan Vlieghe, and Sushil Wadhwani.\n\n\n=== Cost of living crisis ===\n\nThe cost of living crisis has dominated Hunt's time as chancellor, with him announcing many policies to help slow down the crisis, including a rise in the National Minimum Wage, and cuts in excise duty on fuel and alcohol.\n\n\n== Budgets ==\nAs of 2024, Hunt has delivered two budgets during his chancellorship, in March 2023, and in March 2024. He also delivered two autumn statements, the November 2022 statement, and the November 2023 statement.\n\n\n=== November 2022 autumn statement ===\n\nHunt's first Autumn Statement took place on 17 November 2022, after being delayed from 31 October, due to the handover of power from Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak. Hunt committed to maintaining scheduled public spending plans until 2025, but said that spending would slow after then. He also lowered the threshold at which earners become eligible to pay the top rate of income tax, and announced an increase in the National Minimum Wage, as well as increases for pensions and benefits in line with inflation. The Energy Price Guarantee was extended to April 2023, but raised from £2,500 to £3,000.\n\n\n=== March 2023 budget ===\n\nHunt's first budget was delivered on 15 March 2023. Hunt set out plans to remove barriers to employment (with measures such as an increase in the amount of free childcare), encourage business investment (with measures including a programme of tax cuts for business worth £27bn), and address labour shortages in some industries (such as the construction sector). Government help for families facing financial pressure was also extended, with the Energy Price Guarantee extended for a further three months. The cap on the lifetime allowance for tax-free pensions contributions was also abolished in an attempt to encourage workers such as NHS doctors and consultants to remain in employment longer.\n\n\n=== November 2023 autumn statement ===\n\nHunt's second Autumn Statement took place on 22 November 2022. Measures announced in the statement included reducing the amount of National Insurance contributions from 12% to 10%, making permanent a tax-break scheme for businesses purchasing equipment, a rise in the minimum wage, known as the National Living Wage, changes to benefits criteria, and investment in manufacturing and artificial intelligence.\n\n\n=== March 2024 budget ===\n\nHunt's second budget was delivered on 6 March 2024. Hunt abolished the non-dom tax status, reduced employee's national insurance by 2%, froze alcohol and fuel duties, increased tobacco and vapes duties, extended the oil and gas windfall tax, increased the child benefit threshold, announced further energy measures, announced further levelling-up funding, reduced capital gains tax by 4%, extended the Household Support Fund and increased the VAT threshold to £90,000 for small businesses, and kept income tax personal allowances at the same level (fiscal drag) \n\n\n== See also ==\nPremiership of Liz Truss\nPremiership of Rishi Sunak\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Theta is the tenth studio album by Nigerian singer Brymo, independently released on May 27, 2022. The album comprises ten tracks and was recorded entirely in Nigerian Pidgin. Labeled a folk,  sentimental ballad, and quiet storm record, Theta explores themes of survival, prudence, sexual violence, abuse, hypocrisy, communal violence, and love. The album's production was handled by Bigfoot, who single-handedly produced Brymo's Libel and 9: Harmattan & Winter projects in their entirety.\nBrymo announced the album's track list in a Twitter post and described the record as a \"study of humanity's struggles—and a view into what it might have been\". Theta received positive critical acclaim from music critics, who called it \"simplistic\" and praised Brymo's songwriting.\n\n\n== Background ==\nTheta was released on May 27, 2022, along with Brymo's third book The Bad Tooth. Ten tracks comprise the album, which was recorded entirely in Nigerian Pidgin. Brymo announced the album's track list in a Twitter post; he described it as a \"study of humanity's struggles—and a view into what it might have been\". Producer Bigfoot, who previously oversaw the production of Brymo's Harmattan & Winter and Libel projects, single-handedly mixed, mastered, and produced all of the album's tracks.\n\n\n== Music and lyrics ==\nTheta is a mixture of sentimental ballad, quiet storm and folk music. It deals with themes of survival, prudence, sexual violence, abuse, hypocrisy, communal violence, and love. All of the album's songs feature rhythmic percussion, piano chord, violin chords, and choral chants. Although Theta has tracks with percussion and upbeat tempos, its chord progression is mostly dark and melancholic.\n\n\n=== Tracks 1–5 ===\n\"Illusions\", the album's opening track, has a somber and contemplative tone. On the record, Brymo analyzes the horrific realities of the transatlantic slave trade while taking a sarcastic jab at the seeming lack of resistance shown by African slaves against their Western masters. Afrocritik writer Chinonso Ihekire wrote that while Brymo's position may be considered \"politically incorrect\", the singer \"tackles the subject, creating vivid imageries\" that are reminiscent of Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained (2012). The mellow track \"Pim Pim\" is driven by piano chords, shekere, and slow drums. In \"Pim Pim\", Brymo explores various paradigms that are people-centric and promotes the resurgence of a populace that is prosperous as a result of respectable work. Ihekire notes the record is \"reminiscent of Brymo’s own personal struggles\" and that the singer is \"unashamed of his humble beginnings\".\nIn the Afrobeats-themed \"Dem No Born Us Together\", Brymo makes a statement about the bandwagon mentality that permeates every aspect of human existence, and advises his audience to consider their decisions; the song features an upbeat Fela Kuti-esque instrumental. In \"Love Na Drug\", Brymo describes a love that is stronger than hard drugs and talks in parables about those who hold grudges against him. Pulse Nigeria's Motolani Alake praised Brymo for being \"unrepentantly human\" and said the song \"portrays the singer as one who doesn’t look like he wants to have all the answers, but one who simply says how he honestly feels\". \"Money Good\", the album's fifth track, has been described as a \"slow-burn ode\". According to Alake, the song conveys Brymo's own take on the subjects it covers.\n\n\n=== Tracks 6–10 ===\nThe slow tempo track \"Life Dey Go On\" is composed of jazz-esque keys and violins. Music critic Bomi Anifowose characterized the song as a \"nihilistic cry about how life keeps on pacing regardless of anybody's circumstance\". The seventh track, \"Tomorrow\", explores afro jazz. Anifowose called the song \"bubbly, happy and groovy\" and said it could make listeners feel like they're in the \"1980s funky vibe era\". In the metal track \"Oga\", Brymo looks back on his 2021 rape allegations, which surfaced on Twitter and was previously addressed on Libel. \"Oga\" depicts a male character who has sexually assaulted a woman and is on the verge of meeting his waterloo; Brymo suggests that he wants the same punishment for anyone who gets caught in a similar situation, including himself. Alake said the track \"leans more towards pain, consequences, and retribution\" and is an \"outlier\" on the album.\n\"Market Square\", the ninth track, parodies humanity's incapacity to recognize jokes associated with karma. Alake said the song is \"curated with symbolism and is generally symptomatic of Brymo's simpler brand songwriting\". The ballad \"For You\" ends the album's sonic journey and folksy narrative.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nTheta received positive critical acclaim from music critics. Pulse Nigeria's Motolani Alake awarded the album 8.2 out of 10, calling it simplistic and noting it \"feels like an anthological series about society, humanity and our plight, delivered via a collection of mostly personal perspectives, feelings and musings, from the heart of a great songwriter\". Alake also commended Brymo for not \"forcing his opinions, thoughts and views down anybody's throat\". Writing for the media platform DigiMillennials, Bomi Anifowose characterized Theta as a \"symbolic oeuvre of a poetic messiah\".\nAfrocritik's Chinonso Ihekire granted the album a rating of 8.0 out of 10, saying it \"provides a reassuring feel of genius\" and that its only noticeable imperfection is \"its status as the work of a human mind eternally condemned to imperfection\". Ihekire also characterized the album as \"a complex masterpiece\" and said it thrives on \"simplicity\". In a review for The Cable Lifestyle, Fareedat Taofeeq rated the album 7/10, calling it \"a great piece\" and praising the singer for embracing the literal meaning of each song.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Fragheto massacre (Italian: Eccidio di Fragheto or Strage di Fragheto) was the massacre of 30 Italian civilians and 15 partisans in Fragheto, a frazione of Casteldelci in central-northern Italy, on 7 April 1944, during World War II, by soldiers of the German 356th Infantry Division. After partisans belonging to the Eighth Garibaldi Brigade ambushed troops approaching the hamlet, fourteen soldiers of the Sturmbattaillon OB Sudwest conducted house-to-house searches and summarily killed civilians. Representing 40% of the hamlet's population, many of the victims were elderly people, women, or children. A further seven partisans and one civilian were shot the next day at Ponte Carrattoni, at the confluence of the Senatello and Marecchia.\nThe Fragheto massacre was among the first massacres perpetrated by the Wehrmacht and collaborating Italian fascists in central-northern Italy. For years after the massacre, some local opinion held partisans responsible for the massacre, accusing them of attempting an impossible ambush and leaving the hamlet's residents open to reprisal.\nAn initial investigation into the massacre was archived in the 1960s, the files being lost in the Armadio della vergogna. In 2013, a trial in abstentia acquitted the only two surviving German soldiers, who had been charged with multiple homicide aggravated by trivial reasons.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn early 1944, partisans active in central-northern Italy were disrupting the construction of the Gothic Line. On 2 April 1944, five detachments of the Eighth Garibaldi Brigade, who were partisans aligned with the Italian Communist Party, occupied Sant'Agata Feltria. They captured forty-two soldiers of the Italian Social Republic, carabinieri, and policemen.\nWith supporting Italian fascist forces, a German detachment was sent to round up partisans in the area between Monte Fumaiolo and Casteldelci. On 6 April, troops belonging to the Sturmbattaillon OB Sudwest of the 356th Infantry Division passed through Capanne di Verghereto. At an infirmary in the town, they killed three wounded partisans, and captured eight young people as prisoners, of whom seven were partisans and one was a civilian. The prisoners, who were seriously ill, were forced to carry cases of ammunition.\nTo escape encirclement, partisans in the area began to flee along the valley of the Senatello stream. On the night of 6–7 April, the first company of the partisan brigade, led by Alberto Bardi, sheltered in the hamlet of Fragheto. In the morning, they decided to engage the German troops approaching the hamlet, thereby delaying their advance and allowing other companies time to escape. The company climbed the hills near Calanco and ambushed the Germans. The ambush killed three partisans and several Germans.\nThe partisans retreated from their positions at approximately 13:00, ending the ambush. In the houses at Calanco di Sotto, the Germans killed six partisans aged between 21 and 24. The German forces continued towards the Senatello, stopping to search houses for partisans. Being warned of an imminent incursion by partisans, the young men of Fragheto fled the hamlet, while the women and children stayed, believing the Germans would only target men of military age. By attacking the hills, the partisans hoped the hamlet would be spared any reprisal.\n\n\n== Massacre ==\nArriving in Fragheto at 17:30 that afternoon, fourteen soldiers of the Sturmbattaillon OB Sudwest raided the hamlet, conducting house-to-house searches and summarily killing civilians inside. The soldiers believed that the hamlet was a partisan base: according to German testimonies, they had found a wounded partisan in the first house they searched, while in another, an Italian civilian opened fire on two soldiers.\nOf the hamlet's 71 inhabitants, 30 were killed, including 15 women, one of whom was pregnant, seven children, six elderly people, and two young adults. Three people were injured. 15 partisans were also killed, including five partisans who had been captured in previous days. The hamlet's houses and church rectory were set alight. For unknown reasons, one house in the hamlet was spared: 29 residents sheltered in that house.\nAll the while, the Sturmbattalion was transporting the eight prisoners they had captured in Capanne. Though the Germans wanted to transfer them to Germany as prisoners, the Italian command demanded their death. After spending the night of 7–8 April at the confluence of the Senatello and Marecchia, a soldier of the Venezia-Giulia Battalion of the National Republican Guard executed the prisoners using a machine gun. Before their deaths, their heads were ritually shaved in humiliation by bayonet. Thirty minutes after the execution, one of the prisoners resurfaced, kissed his comrades, and begged the German soldiers not to be executed. Handed over to the Italians, he was again shot by machine gun, and grenades were launched on the victims' corpses.\nOne of the residents who survived the massacre, 21-year-old Leone Cresti, hid in a cave 100 metres (330 ft) from the hamlet. Among the first to return to the hamlet, Cresti helped to collect the bodies and dig the mass grave in which they were buried.\n\n\n== Investigations and trial ==\nA trial for the Fragheto massacre opened in 1947. In the 1960s, it was archived after a preliminary investigation, and the files were lost in the Armadio della vergogna, which was rediscovered in 1994. On 10 March 1950, Perugia's Court of Assizes suspended the prosecution of three Italians suspected of having collaborated in the massacre \"because the crimes have been extinguished by virtue of amnesty\".\nWhile the two soldiers responsible for the execution of the eight prisoners at the confluence were initially sentenced to imprisonment for thirty years, their sentences were later overturned.\nIn 2006, following the identification of German soldiers involved in the massacres by Interpol, the military prosecutor's office of La Spezia reopened the case. The case passed to the office of Verona following the suppression of the La Spezia office. From 20 January 2012, the only three surviving German officers were tried in abstentia on grounds of multiple homicide aggravated by trivial reasons. On 7 February 2013, the military court of Verona acquitted two defendants and did not return a verdict on the third, who had passed away during the trial. The ruling was upheld in 2014 at Rome's military court of appeal.\n\n\n== Commemoration ==\nSome local opinion placed responsibility for the massacre on the partisans, accusing them of attempting an impossible ambush and leaving the hamlet open to reprisals. Adolfo Bernardi, the parish priest, popularised blame for the partisans; Bernardi himself was spared from the massacre, along with an altar-server, because they had been blessing houses for Easter. Florestano Vancini's 1980 documentary Fragheto, una strage: perché? (transl. Fragheto, a Massacre: Why?) interviewed survivors, attempting to reconcile their memories.\nThe massacre is remembered annually at an event organised each 7 April by Casteldelci's municipal council. A plaque in Fragheto commemorates the massacre, as well as a monument in the hamlet's cemetery. A section of the memorial plaque to the war dead in Pesaro's Piazzale Collenuccio is dedicated to the massacre, and a street in the city is named \"Martyrs of Fragheto\" (Via Martiri di Fragheto). A local history walk includes signposted plaques at various notable points of the massacre. The bridge at the confluence of the Senatello and Marecchia, at the time named Ponte Carrattoni, was renamed the Bridge of the Eight Martyrs (Ponte degli Otto Martiri).\nBy presidential decree, on 9 April 2003, the municipality of Casteldelci was awarded the Silver Medal for Civil Valour (Medaglia d’argento al merito civile), with the motivation:\n\nA small town, during the last world war, having provided temporary hospitality to a group of partisans, was subjected to a ferocious and blind reprisal by German troops, who massacred thirty of its citizens, mostly elderly people, women and children, and destroyed the entire town.\nThe Fragheto massacre inspired the foundation of two local civic associations: Casa Fragheto in Fragheto in 2000 and Il Borgo della Pace in Novafeltria in 2003. In 2017, Il Borgo della Pace sponsored a short film by Roberta Corsi and Fabio Imola that retold the story of the massacre. Museums in Fragheto and Casteldelci collects survivors' testimonies. On 21 August 2022, a plaque in Fragheto was unveiled to Maria and Candido Gabrielli, who raised awareness of the massacre during their lives; Candido was the only survivor of his family. An elementary school in Casteldelci is named after another Maria Gabrielli who died in the massacre.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAxis war crimes in Italy\nList of massacres in the Italian Social Republic\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Irving Oil Home Office is the corporate head office of Irving Oil. Designed by architect Alex Novell and architectural firm B+H Architects, the 11-storey building is located at 10 King Square South by King's Square in Saint John, New Brunswick. It sits next door to the Imperial Theatre, and was constructed on one of their employee parking lots. Construction began on June 6, 2016, and it officially opened in the fall of 2019. The home office has an area of 18,581 m2 (200,000 sq ft). Its fifth floor has an outdoor terrace and the 11th floor has a roof skylight. The building is LEED certified.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Irving Oil Home Office sits on 10 King Square South, located next to King's Square in Saint John, New Brunswick. Measuring at a height of 11 storeys, it was built on one of their employee parking lots, with an area of 18,581 m2 (200,000 sq ft), and a height of approximately 56.6 m (186 ft). The home office has an outdoor terrace on the fifth floor, and a roof skylight on the 11th. The building also has a LEED Silver certification.\n\n\n== Construction ==\nThis was not the first time Irving Oil had planned to build a headquarters in Saint John. Previously, the company intended to build a $30 million headquarters on Saint John's Long Wharf but cancelled these plans in 2010. On October 21, 2015, it was officially announced that the Irving Oil Home Office would be constructed on one of their employee parking lots next to the Imperial Theatre. Landscape architect Alex Novell and the architectural firm B+H Architects was hired by Irving Oil to design the building, with the aim being to relocate approximately 1,000 Irving Oil employees from five separate offices into one large office building. Construction was scheduled to begin in April 2016, but plans were delayed due to an appeal regarding the proposed building site's location within Saint John's heritage conservation area, which imposed specific building limitations. The city council revised the heritage rules with respect to the proposed site to facilitate the project's continuation. Construction began on the morning of June 6, 2016, with an expected completion date between 18 and 24 months from then.On February 6, 2018, a 33-year-old construction worker died in the hospital after receiving a head injury from a fall in the construction site the previous day. WorkSafeNB launched an investigation to determine if the death had violated the Occupational Health and Safety Act.In March 2019, employees began relocating to the home office, and it officially opened in the fall of the same year. In 2020, Service New Brunswick assessed the building's value for taxes at $56.8 million, significantly lower than the estimated construction cost of $88 million.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nIrving Oil website",

        "content": "Le chanteur is the third album by French singer Daniel Balavoine, released in June 1978 under Riviera-LM, a subsidiary of Barclay. The album was commercially successful, selling over 800 thousand copies.\n\n\n== Background and recording ==\nPrior to Le chanteur, Balavoine had released two albums, De vous à elle en passant par moi and Les aventures de Simon et Gunther..., both of which had sold very poorly. Barclay founder Eddie Barclay expressed concerns over the future success of Balavoine; however, Léo Missir, the artistic director at Barclay, defended Balavoine and kept him at the label. Balavoine also decided that if he sold fewer than 30 thousand copies of his next album and fewer than 100 thousand copies of his next single, he would quit music.\nThanks to Missir, Balavoine returned to the studio in April 1978 to record his third album. However, after several weeks, Missir visited the studio to listed to what had been produced, but found that a sufficiently strong enough song to mark the album was missing. Later, whilst playing a melody, which would become \"Le chanteur\", in the studio, one of the musicians played a harmony on the keyboard which was then recorded by mistake. These notes then inspired Balavoine to rewrite the introduction, giving the song its distinctive opening. Subsequently, one time whilst the rest of the musicians were at a restaurant next door to the studio, Balavoine stayed behind and wrote the lyrics to \"Le chanteur\" in an hour. The lyrics recount the life and career of a fictional singer and the song was initially titled \"J'voudrais bien réussir ma vie\", in reference to the song \"Je m'voyais déjà\" by Charles Aznavour, but was later changed to \"Le chanteur\".\n\n\n== Release ==\nLe chanteur was released at the beginning of June 1978. For the release of the album's first single, Barclay's sales team produced a promotional single with \"Le chanteur\" as the B-side and \"Si je suis fou\" as the A-side with the record company seeing \"Si je suis fou\" as being the more potentially successful. However, when the radio stations played \"Le chanteur\", the record company were surprised and were forced to place it as the A-side for the commercial release of the single.\nWhilst both the album and the first single were released in June 1978, neither garnered success until after the release of album Starmania in September 1978, a cast recording for the rock opera of the same name in which Balavoine stars and sings. This album was hugely successful and went on to be certified diamond by the SNEP.\nThe second single from Le chanteur was \"Lucie\" and was released in 1979. It featured the song \"SOS d'un terrien en détresse\" from Starmania as the B-side.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nDaniel Balavoine – vocals, acoustic guitar, keyboards\nBernard Serré – bass, backing vocals\nPatrick Dulphy – guitar\nColin Swinburne – guitar\nJean-Paul Batailley – drums, percussion\nRoger Secco – drums, backing vocals\nHervé Limeretz – keyboard\nPatrick Bourgoin – wind instruments\nGuy Balavoine – backing vocals\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Sadar River is a tributary of the Elorz River, which rises in the Aranguren and Tajonar mountain ranges, running in a westerly direction, between the Eocene marls of the Cuenca de Pamplona. It is 19 km long and drains a basin of some 70 km2. The average rainfall it receives, 700 mm, gives it an estimated annual flow of 12 hm³.\nThe Zolina reservoir, a former artificial leachate deposit from the disappeared potash mines, belongs to the Sadar basin, although, due to the concentration of salts, its waters and sludge are kept confined within its containment dike. Although of artificial origin, the reservoir is being colonised by species typical of halophilic environments, which make it of environmental interest. The Góngora Waste Treatment Centre also belongs to the Sadar basin. In this case, its waters have been channelled and are taken directly to the Arazuri treatment plant.\nThe Sadar is a small river, with a low flow, which is very well embedded in the terrain and hardly presents any flooding problems. Its course, including its banks, has an average width of some 6–8 metres.\nIn Pamplona, where it runs for approximately 3.7 km, it crosses the campuses of the Public University of Navarre and the University of Navarre and flows into the River Elorz.\n\n\n== Projects of interest ==\nThe Sadar River is one of the watercourses integrated within the Pamplona River Park. It is popularly known as the River in reverse, perhaps because it carries more water at the beginning than at the end, or perhaps because it flows in an east–west direction, which is the opposite of what is usual in the rest of the rivers in the Mediterranean Basin.\nThis river has also been the target of projects such as \"Sadar Conecta\" or \"Equilibrium, preservation and conservation of the natural environment of the Pamplona campus\" (\"Equilibrio, preservación y conservación del entorno natural del campus de Pamplona\"), in which various organisations have participated with the aim of preserving the nature around the river.\nIn 2019, the Public University of Navarre carried out a project to preserve the environment of this river, installing information panels on the fauna and flora that surrounds it as it passes through the Arrosadía university campus in Pamplona, as well as carrying out a clean-up of the river banks.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"En pamplona.es Río Sadar\" (in Spanish).",

        "content": "Rachel Crandall Crocker (born 1958) is an American psychotherapist and transgender activist. She founded the community organization Transgender Michigan to improve transgender lives in Michigan in 1997. In 2009 she founded the International Transgender Day of Visibility (TDOV) as a counterpoint to the only other holiday for transgender people, the Transgender Day of Remembrance.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nCrandall Crocker was born in 1958, in Michigan to a middle-class family. She knew that something was different since childhood, but growing up in the 1960s didn't come out until 38 years later.In 1985, she graduated from Michigan State University with a master's degree in social work.She came out in 1997 as a transgender woman and lost her first marriage, her home and was fired from her job at the hospital she was working at.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAfter coming out in 1997, she co-founded the community organization Transgender Michigan with her now wife, Susan Crocker, where she serves as executive director.\nThrough her organization, she provides advocacy, support and education for the transgender community in Michigan.In addition to her advocacy work, she is working as a licensed psychotherapist specializing in transgender issues since 1985. She is also a member of the National Association of Social Workers and provides training and education to therapists on transgender care.In 2009, Crandall Crocker wanted a reason to celebrate the transgender community and founded the International Transgender Day of Visibility on March 31 as a \"day to focus on the living\" as a counterpoint to the Transgender Day of Remembrance. Since the founding of TDOV, it has been recognized in countries around the world, including the US by President Joe Biden and celebrated its 15th anniversary in 2024. In an interview essay with Them magazine in 2021, she reflected on the founding of TDOV and how visibility can be a double-edged sword as visibility can also bring the risks of attacks.\n\n\n== Honors and awards ==\nIn September 2008, Crandall Crocker received the Liberty Bell Award to \"honor outstanding citizens within the local community\" by the State Bar of Michigan honoring her service to the community. She was the first transgender person to receive the award.In June 2023, Crandall Crocker was recognized as a Pride Month Game Changers honoree by the Detroit Red Wings and Detroit Tigers for her advocacy work.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nCrandall Crocker identifies as a transgender woman and uses she/her pronouns.

He was named after Robert E. Lee.\n\n\n== Early life and family ==\nRobert E. Lee Van Winkle was born July 17, 1862, to Peter Van Winkle and his wife Temperance Miller in Benton County, Arkansas. Peter Van Winkle was born in 1814 in New York City into a Dutch family that immigrated to New Amsterdam in 1619. He later moved to Arkansas, and built a lumber mill and plantaion style home in Benton County and owned at least 12 slaves. A supporter of the Confederacy, Peter named his children Jefferson Davis Van Winkle, after Jefferson Davis, and Robert E. Lee Van Winkle, after Robert E. Lee.\nRobert Van Winkle's family fled to Bowie County, Texas when their estate was razed during the American Civil War. After the war his family returned and by the 1870s the lumber mill dominated the regional market. \n\n\n== Mayor of Oklahoma City ==\nVan Winkle moved to Oklahoma City in 1899 and formed the Oklahoma Sash and Door Company, and was an influential member of the city's lumber industry. He served his first term as Mayor of Oklahoma City between April 10, 1899, and April 8, 1901. He served his second term between April 13, 1903, and April 10, 1905. During his second term he worked with the Oklahoma City Council to pass over 120 ordinances. He died on January 4, 1928. \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Nikolai Fedorovich Katanov (6 [18] May 1862, Izyum (Uzyum) near the village of Askiz – 9 March 1922, Kazan) was a Russian Turkologist, professor at the Imperial Kazan University and the Kazan Theological Academy, doctor of comparative linguistics, ethnographer, folklorist and social activist. Katanov is widely regarded as the first Khakass scientist and was an Active State Councillor in 1915.\nHe was born into the family of an ulus clerk. From 1876 to 1884, he studied at Krasnoyarsk gymnasium, graduating with a gold medal. He then attended the Faculty of Oriental Languages at St. Petersburg University from 1884 to 1888. On the recommendation of Vasily Radlov, he was sent on an ethnographic-linguistic expedition to Siberia and East Turkestan to study the languages and lifestyles of Turkic tribes. From 1889 to 1892, he studied the peoples of Khakassia, Tuva, Zhetysu, Tarbagatai, and Xinjiang. In 1894, Katanov moved to Kazan after being unsuccessful in securing a place at the University of St. Petersburg. He worked in Kazan for 28 years until his death. In 1903, he defended his master's thesis titled 'The Experience of the Study of the Uriankhai Language'. In 1907, he earned his Doctorate in Comparative Linguistics based on his extensive body of work. From 1911 to 1917, he primarily taught at the Kazan Theological Academy, where he held the position of Ordinary Professor. In 1919, he was elected as a professor at Kazan University through the All-Russian competition, which was approved by Narkompros in 1921.\nN.F. Katanov was a member of two foreign societies. The author was a member of several scientific societies, including the Société des sciences et lettres in Leuven, the Ungarische ethnographische Gesellschaft in Budapest, and the Finno-Ugrian Society in Helsingfors. He was also a full member of the Imperial Russian Geographic Society, the Imperial Russian Archaeological Society since 1894, and the Society of Devotees of Natural Science, Anthropology, and Ethnography. Additionally, he was a member of the Turkestan circle of lovers of archeology in the city of Tashkent, and a full member of the Kazan and Semipalatinsk statistical committees. From 1898 to 1914, N.F. Katanov chaired the Society of Archaeology, History and Ethnography at Kazan University. He resumed his position as chairman in 1919. In addition to his academic pursuits, Katanov was actively involved in public life, especially in the field of sobriety propaganda. His scientific works continue to be published and republished in the 21st century.\n\n\n== Background ==\nNikolai Fyodorovich Katanov was born on May 6 (18), 1862, in Turakovsky ulus, a steppe area located 16km from the village of Askiz on the left bank of the Abakan River. At birth, he was given the Khakass name Porā, son of Khyzyl (Khakas: Пора Хызыл оғлы). His name means \"Grey\" in Khakass. In his 1897 autobiography for S.A. Vengerov's dictionary, Katanov wrote: \n\nMy father was a Tatar of the Sagai tribe and my mother was a Tatar of the Kash tribe of the Pyurut tribe; my father was an ulus scribe of his tribe by profession. Both my parents and I are Orthodox Christians. My parents and all my ancestors practised Christianity, which was introduced to the Abakan valley in the 18th century, and at the same time they openly practised shamanistic rites: they took part in sacrifices to the spirits of the mountains, water, fire and sky and prayed to these spirits as protectors of cattle and people.\nThe Katanov family belonged to the Khakass seok (clan, literally 'bones') purut (pyuryut), which was part of the Sagai people. According to various sources, Nikolai Fedorovich's mother had the surname Chaptykova or Kizekova, and her name was Maria (Chamakh in Khakas). She belonged to the Khaskha (Kash) seok and Shaloshin clan, meaning she was a Kachintsy (Haas). Katanov's parents adhered to both traditional shamanic beliefs and Orthodoxy, but they were not married in a church. As a result, Nikolai was listed as illegitimate on the metric certificate. Nikolai's elder brother, also named Nikolai (1858–1892), later became a priest at the Ust-Yes church in the Minusinsk district. The family also had a daughter named Maria. As with all Khakas people, the family led a semi-nomadic lifestyle, spending the warm half of the year at a summer camp in the Sagai steppe and the cold season on the bank of the Abakan River near Lake Sarkagel.\nThe State Archives of Krasnoyarsk Krai contain metric books in fond 824, 'Minusinsk spiritual board', which include a record of Nikolai Katanov's baptism under No. 90. This record confirms his birth date as 6 May old style, with his baptism taking place on 15 (27) May. It was rare for exact dates of birth to be given for the 'Inorodtsy population' during this time. However, according to Alexei Nilogov, an exception was made in this case, as the father of the baptised was an uyezd clerk. The record confirms that Katanov's mother had the surname Kizekova and was Fyodor Semyonovich Katanov's 'illegitimate wife'. In 1876, a note was added to the record stating that a certificate of petition was dated 13 August, likely for admission to the Krasnoyarsk Gymnasium.\n\n\n== Education (1869-1884) ==\n\nIn 1869, Nikolai Katanov enrolled in a one-class rural school that had just opened in Askiz. His uncle, Efim Semyonovich, taught at the school and held various positions such as a letter-writer of the steppe council, church headman, and shopkeeper. The school was not conducive to serious education. However, the Krasnoyarsk goldsmith P.I. Kuznetsov, who had a library and aimed to educate the local 'Inorodtsy', kept a house and a transshipment base in Askiz. Nikolai attended the school in Kuznetsov's house and used books for self-education.\nKatanov was influenced by I. I. Karatanov, an employee of Kuznetsov, who had a small collection of books on the peoples of Siberia and became his first teacher. Karatanov instilled in Nikolai a deep interest in the culture and history of Turkic peoples. After the death of his father in 1874, Nikolai worked as a shepherd in the summer and came under the care of his uncle, who arranged for him to be a clerk in the Askizsk steppe duma. During his two years of service, Katanov learned Russian literacy and calligraphy. In 1876, Nikolai decided to continue his education and enrolled in the Krasnoyarsk Gymnasium with the help of P.I. Kuznetsov, who was the mayor of Krasnoyarsk at the time. He secured a recommendation from I.I. Karatanov and travelled to the city by boat along the Abakan and Yenisey.\nIn Krasnoyarsk, Katanov faced severe financial difficulties, which persisted throughout his life. Despite receiving 100 roubles from his father, it was not enough to alleviate his struggles. Although he was the top student for all 8 years of his studies, Katanov had to work as a tutor and sometimes as a summer labourer for more successful friends' families. Among his tutoring charges were the children of merchants - Arseny Yarilov and Vera Emelyanova. Katanov, a gymnasium student, was known for his diligence and aptitude for learning, receiving praise in the second, fourth, and seventh grades. Throughout his eight years of study, he never arrived late or violated any disciplinary rules. However, in the eighth grade, he caused alarm by missing a lesson. The principal sent the gymnasium supervisor to Katanov's flat. It turned out the conscientious student decided to skip class at least once in his life.\nN.F. Katanov began to develop as a scientist while in the gymnasium. In his contributions to S.A. Vengerov's dictionary materials, he wrote:\n\nSince 1880, i.e. from the IV class of the gymnasium, under the influence of the history and geography teacher A.K. Zavadsky-Krasnopolsky, a full member of the East Siberian branch of the Geographical Society, I have been engaged in writing down Sagai texts and describing the customs of my tribe. K. Zavadsky-Krasnopolsky, a full member of the East Siberian Branch of the Geographical Society, I was engaged in writing Saga texts and describing the customs of my tribe. Thanks to the acquaintance with the works of scientists V.V. Radlov, M.A. Kastren and N.A. Kostrov, I considerably completed my notes and later printed them in several editions.\nIn 1883, Grigory Potanin published Katanov's article 'Description of the Shaman's Tambourine and Costume' in his book 'Sketches of North-Western Mongolia'. In 1884, Nikolai Fedorovich submitted the manuscript of the Sagai language grammar to the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences, where it was reviewed by Nikolay Ilminsky. According to modern researchers, including G.I. Iskhakov and G.S. Amirov, this unpublished work already contained the rudiments of a comparative-historical approach to the study of Turkic languages, which is characteristic of Katanov's mature work. However, Ilminsky undeservedly criticised the work, although he did note Katanov's talent as an ethnographer and linguist.\nIn 1884, Katanov graduated from Krasnoyarsk gymnasium with a gold medal and intended to receive a Turkological education to become a scientist. Initially, he considered entering the Kazan Theological Academy, perhaps under the influence of his priest brother. However, upon arriving in Kazan, Katanov discovered that the teaching of Oriental languages had almost ceased at both the academy and the university. Following the advice of N. I.Ilminsky and V.V. Radlov, who corresponded with the talented 'Inorodets', Nikolai Fyodorovich decided to travel to St. Petersburg.\n\n\n== Saint Petersburg period (1884-1893) ==\n\n\n=== Faculty of Oriental Studies ===\n\nKatanov enrolled in the division of Arabic-Persian-Turkish-Tatar literature at the University of St. Petersburg on 15 August 1884. He received a comprehensive education, including a broad range of humanities and specialist orientalist disciplines. Having previously mastered French and German at the gymnasium, at the University Katanov studied Arabic, Persian, Ottoman, Tatar, Bashkir, and Kazakh languages, as well as the Chagatai language, history, and literature of Turkic peoples, the history of the East, and Muslim law. Furthermore, Katanov privately studied the phonetics of Turkic languages with V.V. Radlov at home. Radlov had recently moved to St. Petersburg from Kazan and found in Katanov a diligent and attentive student. Katanov was exceptionally accurate and industrious as a student, attending and stenographing all lectures without exception, according to memories. He learned the comparative-historical method for studying Turkic languages from Radlov, which piqued his interest even while in gymnasium.\nThe same as in the gymnasium, Nikolai Fyodorovich experienced poverty in St. Petersburg. He applied for a state scholarship, which was granted to him in 1885 after a lengthy trial. However, the scholarship was only 8 roubles a month, which made it impossible for him to live a normal life. As a result, Katanov returned to tutoring. According to V.A. Gordlevsky's memories, Katanov wrote memorials for illiterate women on the church porch for 2 kopecks. He lived a very restricted life, only dining on Sundays. Unfortunately, his semi-starvation led to tuberculosis. However, he was able to recover from the disease thanks to expeditions to East Turkestan.\nOn 5 December 1884, N.F. Katanov was elected as a fellow member of the Society of Archaeology, History, and Ethnography at Kazan University. From 1885, Katanov began to publish actively in Russian and German. His works included studies of the epic of the Minusinsk Turks, collation of materials from M.A. Castren's dictionaries, and a review of Chagatai topographical nomenclature. He also published an article on Russian loanwords in the Sagai dialect.\nKatanov became a member of N.M. Yadrintsev's circle in 1886 after meeting him in the 'Society for Assistance to Siberians Studying in St. Petersburg'. They met on Thursdays at Yadrintsev's, where Katanov's interest in the languages and ethnography of Siberia's indigenous inhabitants grew even stronger. Yadrintsev's newspaper Vostochnoe Obozrenie published several articles by Nikolai Fedorovich. The circle was made up of former political exiles and came under police investigation. As a result, Katanov was forced to sign a receipt on 21 August 1887, promising not to join any secret societies or participate in any financial subscriptions or legal social organizations without permission from his superiors during his time at the university. It seems that this was the only instance in Katanov's life when law enforcement agencies took an interest in him. Throughout his life, he was consistently upright and apolitical.\n\n\n=== Travelling to Siberia and Turkestan ===\n\nNikolai Katanov completed his course of study in 1888, receiving only one 'good' grade - in Russian history (all of the other marks were 'excellent'). On 30 May, the University Council awarded him the degree of Candidate of Literature. At the same time, I.N. Berezin's proposal was accepted, and Katanov became a professorial fellow of the Eastern Faculty, receiving a stipend of 600 roubles per year for two years.\nIn 1887, V.V. Radlov submitted a 'Note' to the Russian Geographical Society, justifying the need for an ethnographic-linguistic expedition to study the 'remnants of Turkic tribes' in Siberia and East Turkestan. On 11 December 1887, the Department of Ethnography considered the proposal, and Radlov suggested sending N. Katanov as a 'prepared and capable person'. Radlov petitioned for the allocation of 1000 rubles to Katanov. The Dean of the Faculty of Oriental Studies, V.P. Vasiliev, supported his petition. By Imperial decree of 22 December 1888, candidate N.F. Katanov was sent to Siberia and China for scientific purposes. On 8 December of the same year, the Ministry of Internal Affairs issued Katanov an open sheet, instructing subordinate persons and institutions of the Ministry of Internal Affairs to provide him with all possible support. Nikolai Fyodorovich was also officially listed as an employee of St. Petersburg University.\nIn early 1889, Katanov left St. Petersburg and returned via Omsk, Tomsk, and Krasnoyarsk, to his native Askiz, where he established the primary base for his field research. On March 7, 1889, he embarked on a journey to Tuva, which he referred to as the Uryankhai land. The trip to Tuva lasted for 5½ months, from March 15 to August 28. The total distance covered during his excursions was approximately 700 versts. N.F. Katanov primarily resided in Russian trading factories, where he interacted with Tuvinians who had direct connections to the Russians. He visited a total of 14 factories, and it was during this time that Katanov's talent as an ethnographer became evident. To avoid arousing suspicion, he posed as an interpreter from a border outpost or a scribe in the merchant's service. He compensated his informants with thread, brick tea, tobacco, paper, pencils, and other small goods. As a result, he collected a substantial amount of field material, including 1122 songs, 160 riddles, 15 fairy tales, and 35 myths. The informants allowed him to record their names and ages, which no previous researcher had been able to do.\nAfter returning to Askiz, Katanov worked on field materials until January 1890. This resulted in two works: 'Sketches of the Uryankhai Land' (published in 2011) and a large manuscript on the grammar of the Tuvan language (published in 1903). According to a letter to V.V. Radlov, Katanov worked at his desk from 8 am to 8-9 pm. The difficulties experienced by the traveller were enormous, and N.I. Veselovsky wrote:\n\nN.F. Katanov undertakes his journey with such meagre material means, with which rarely any of the scholarly travellers, who are generally not spoiled in this respect, undertake journeys to the distant East. All the more do we have to appreciate those interesting materials, which are abundantly supplied to us by the young traveller...In February and March 1890, Katanov travelled to the Kansk taiga to study the Tofalars. Following this, he began preparing for a trip to China. However, his first trip to Xinjiang was unsuccessful as the Chinese authorities in Ürümqi did not allow him to proceed further without official permission from Beijing. Katanov returned to the Russian border and continued processing field materials in Bakhty. He also requested assistance from the Russian consulates in Tacheng and Yining to rectify the permit. In the summer of 1891, Nikolai Fyodorovich spent time in the border town of Tacheng, studying the folklore of the Kyrgyz and Sart. He finally received a passport in Russian, Chinese, and Manchurian languages at the end of 1891, which allowed him to travel throughout China. Katanov reached Hami via Ürümqi and began studying little-known Turkic dialects in March 1892. He returned to Askiz in April 1892 after spending approximately 18 months in Chinese territory. He also conducted several additional excursions within the Minusinsk district between April and October.\nAccording to K.I. Sultanbaeva, in the published and unpublished materials of Katanov's travels in Siberia and Turkestan, the following lines of research can be distinguished:\n\nLanguage, its various manifestations as spoken by those belonging to Turkic nationalities;\nFolklore, its genres: fairytales, legends, fables, tales, songs, riddles, proverbs, popular omens, sayings;\nReligion, philosophical views of the Turkic tribes; attitudes towards Orthodoxy;\nMaterial culture, daily life, domestic objects; cult objects;\nThe tribes' socio-cultural, commodity and monetary relations;\nSocial structure of the tribes, governance, their kinship, tribal relations;\nElements of the psychology of peoples, of interpersonal and inter-ethnic relations.\n\n\n=== Return ===\n\nOn 14 October 1892, N.F. Katanov married Alexandra Ivanovna Tikhonova (1875–1942) at the Peter and Paul Church in Askiz. Alexandra was the adopted daughter of his uncle, Efim Semyonovich. Although the church books in Askiz have not been preserved, a written act called a 'marriage search' was conducted to establish the absence of obstacles to the marriage, such as closely related marriages. This document includes metric and biographical information about the bridegroom. Marriage searches are usually less well-preserved than other such documents. The wedding was attended by a large number of guests, including Innokenty and Ivan, the two sons of goldsmith Pyotr Ivanovich Kuznetsov, who were friends and supporters of the young Katanov. Also in attendance was N.M. Martyanov, the director of the Minusinsk Museum. Alexandra Ivanovna, who graduated from the Minusinsk gymnasium and had a talent for music, played the piano. For 30 years, she assisted her husband with translations and extracts. The couple had a daughter named Anna (1901–1980), who later became a teacher. Katanov also raised his sister Maria's son, Nikolai Gavrilovich Tyunesteev, and gave him his surname. Nikolai Katanov was arrested and executed in 1938.\nAfter completing the programme outlined by the Academy of Sciences and the Russian Geographical Society, N.F. Katanov and his wife returned to St. Petersburg on December 22, 1892. He brought with him several volumes of diaries prepared for printing, as well as a vast amount of data on which he later based all of his scientific works. Numerous materials were initially introduced into scientific circulation, including dictionaries and grammars of the Tuvan and Tofalar languages. Katanov was a pioneer in studying the Uyghur dialects of the Turfan and Khami oases. However, the majority of his linguistic and ethnographic materials remain unpublished, even as of 2017.\nUpon returning to St. Petersburg, Katanov had hoped to secure a position as a lecturer of the Tatar language at the Faculty of Oriental Studies. However, he discovered that the position had already been given to a relative of I.N. Berezin. In his letters to V.V. Radlov, Katanov frequently expressed his dissatisfaction with his financial situation, having been forced to sell his travelling coats and a gold gymnasium medal. P.O. Rykin states that Katanov briefly lost interest in scientific and teaching activities. This led him to request the Ministry of Public Education to appoint him as an inspector of schools in Orenburg province, Siberia, or the Turkestan region. After a year of uncertainty, on 9 November 1893, Nikolai Fyodorovich received a position as a lecturer at Kazan University with the rank of professor extraordinaire, with the assistance of V.V. Radlov and V.R. Rosen. To take this position, Katanov passed the examinations for the degree of Master of Turkish-Tatar literature on 10 and 21 December 1893 and promptly left for Kazan.\n\n\n== Kazan period (1894-1922) ==\n\n\n=== Creative flourish: social activity (1894-1908) ===\n\nOn 12 January 1894, the Katanovs arrived in Kazan, where the researcher was to live for 28 years - until his death. At that time, the teaching of Oriental languages at the university had declined, and Nikolai Fyodorovich was to restore this direction of educational and scientific activity. However, as an extraordinary professor, Katanov only taught elective courses. Despite this, his courses quickly gained popularity among students. During the 1894/1895 academic year, N.F. Katanov taught a variety of courses at the Faculty of History and Philology, showcasing his broad and diverse range of interests:\n\nThe language of the Kazan Tatars (grammar and reading);\nReview of Turkish-Tatar tribes (history of old and new Turkic states, life of tribes, foreigners' reports about Turks);\nHistory of Turkish-Tatar literature (Ottoman, Chagatai, Common Turkic);\nComparative grammar of Turkic languages.\nDuring the 1895/1896 academic year, N.F. Katanov expanded his course offerings to include Arabic and Persian languages, as well as the grammar of Altaic languages, Kazakh and Kyrgyz languages. He also taught a special course on 'Inscriptions on the coins of the Golden Horde and tombstones of the Kazan and Bulgar Khanates'.\nNikolai Fedorovich Katanov was elected Secretary of the Society of Archaeology, History and Ethnography - OAIE - at the university less than two months after his arrival in Kazan on 8 April 1894. Katanov was involved in various activities, including organizing the Society's library, editing its Izvestiya, and publishing the Society's reports and meeting minutes for the first time. In 1897, due to the difficulty of balancing his teaching responsibilities with his work for the Society, Katanov requested to be relieved of his duties as secretary. However, in 1898 he was elected as the chairman of the OAIE. On 19 March 1900, he wrote to V.V. Radlov expressing his frustration with the difficult relationships he sometimes had with his colleagues in the Society:\n\nThe Council of the Society of Archaeology, History and Ethnography has decided by a majority vote not to print any Oriental texts in Izvestia, because the texts are useless. <...> Moreover, local scientists and quasi-scientists, historians by profession, do not know Islam at all and, to save money, do not follow foreign literature at all, and often not even Russian. <...> In view of the refusal of the Council to print Oriental texts, I resigned the title of chairman and member, but the General Assembly invited me back and yesterday elected me chairman again for the years 1900-1902.Burdened with a mass of worries at the university and at the OAIE, Katanov took on any work that fell within the scope of his interests. He immediately became involved in the activities of the translation commission of the Brotherhood of St Gury for the translation of the New Testament into the \"languages of the Siberian Inorodtsy\". From 1907 he became chairman of the translation commission of the Kazan educational district and a member of the committee on press affairs. During this period, Katanov was summoned several times to St. Petersburg for meetings on the education of Inorodtsy. Additionally, he attended meetings of teachers of Inorodtsy schools in Orenburg from 1907 onwards. Katanov was also a member of the council of the Kazan City Museum from 1905 until 1917. During this time, he headed its historical and ethnographic department. He also served as chairman of the museum council from 1906 to 1912 and 1914–1917. The scholar sometimes felt burdened by his numerous duties. In a letter to A.N. Samoilovich, he expressed his dissatisfaction:\nI am a permanent expert on the affairs of the Muslim press at the district court, where I get no rest, no time ... and no money. The education authorities are completely powerless to relieve me of my civil duties.\n\nN.F. Katanov was an active participant in the temperance movement. He held various positions in the Kazan Society of Sobriety, including member-competitor (since 4 September 1896), full member (since 14 June 1897), honorary member, and life member. He also served as a member of its Committee and secretary. Furthermore, he was the headman of the All-Merciful Saviour church, which was affiliated with the Society. He published works with an anti-alcohol and historical focus in the magazine Deyatel, which he co-edited for a long time. He was the right-hand man of the permanent head of the Society of Sobriety, A.T. Solovyov.\nAfter the Kazan Society of Sobriety was transformed into the Kazan department of the 'Russian Assembly' (KORS), N.F. Katanov joined the activities of this right-monarchical organization. He was elected as the comrade (deputy) of the Chairman of the KORS Council A.T. Solovyov on 4 (17) February 1909, replacing the renowned Russian soil scientist R.V. Rizpolozhensky.\nAs a critic of socialist theories and new religious doctrines, he frequently denounced their advocates and theorists. This included the well-known Tatar poet Gabdulla Tuqay (Abdulla Tuqayev), who sympathised with the socialist-revolutionaries, and Sardar Vaisov, the founder of the 'Vaisov movement' (which N. F. Katanov classified as a 'Muslim sect').\nN.F. Katanov made a significant contribution to the development of the Orthodox mission in the Volga-Kama region. He served as the head of the editorial board of the Inorodcheskoye Obozreniye (a supplement to the journal Pravoslavniy Sobesednik), which was the printed organ of the missionary department of the Kazan Theological Academy. The publication, which began in late 1912, was dedicated to describing the 'modern life' and religion of foreigners in European and Asian Russia.\nDespite his heavy workload in education, organization, and social work, Nikolai Fyodorovich still managed to find time for scientific research. Between 1898 and 1908, he published 145 scientific papers, excluding reviews and abstracts. In 1896 and 1899, he conducted expeditions to the Minusinsky district to study the Beltyr and Sagai people. During this time, he observed shamanic kamlanie. From May to August 1897, he conducted field research among the Teptyars and Kryashens. In May–August 1898, he travelled to the Ufa province to study the Bashkirs, Mishar Tatars, and again the Teptyars and Kryashens. Detailed reports were published in Izvestiya OAIE. In February 1909, the scientist was unanimously made an honorary member of the Society of Archaeology, History and Ethnography. In 1900, the scientist visited Belgium and France. In the summer of 1909, Katanov made his final trip to his hometown of Askiz.\nBy 1904, N.F. Katanov had become a member of the Societe des sciences et lettres in Louven, the Ungarische ethnographische Gesellschaft in Budapest, and the Finno-Ugrian Society in Helsingfors, thanks to publications in French and German.\n\n\n=== The experience of the Study of the Uryankhai language ===\nN.F. Katanov's work, The Experience of the Study of the Uriankhai Language with the Indication of the Main Related Relationships to Other Languages of Turkic Root, is notable for its extensive volume of approximately 600 pages. According to Katanov's biographer S.N. Ivanov, this work was defining for Katanov's career as a Turkicologist. Katanov's dissertation, published in parts between 1899 and 1903 in the Academic Notes of Kazan University, provided the first comprehensive description of the Tuvan language. The Experience has a structure that resembles traditional descriptive grammars of the 19th century. However, it is distinguished by the inclusion of a chrestomathy and a dictionary. The grammar of the Tuvan language demonstrates the author's extensive knowledge, as materials from 5 ancient and 42 modern Turkic languages from Katanov's card catalogues were used to compare 'sounds and forms'. The comparative study served Katanov solely to prove the Turkic origin of the Tuvan language. In contemporary science, ideas about the Samoyedic or Yenisei origin of Tuvinians were prevalent, even in the case of V.V. Radlov and N.M. Yadrintsev. Although the problems raised are important, the work received severe criticism from A.N. Samoilovich. The author was reproached for weak development of Tuvan syntax, to the detriment of morphology, and poor acquaintance with modern linguistics, particularly phonetics. P.O. Rykin states that Katanov showed little interest in theoretical issues. However, he demonstrated mastery of all the necessary terminology and presentation when formulating the research goal.\nThe Experience of the Study of the Uriankhai Language was submitted by Katanov as a master's thesis for public defence at the Faculty of Oriental Languages of St. Petersburg University on 7 December 1903. The official opponents were V.D. Smirnov and P.M. Melioransky. After the defence, Nikolai Fyodorovich was awarded the degree of Master of Turkish-Tatar literature. On 26 November 1907, the Council of Kazan University granted the Faculty of History and Philology's petition to award N.F. Katanov an honorary Doctor of Comparative Linguistics degree. On 15 December, Nikolai Fyodorovich was confirmed as holding the doctoral rank by the Minister of Public Education.\n\n\n=== Katanov and the museums of Kazan ===\nAfter relocating to Kazan, N.F. Katanov promptly immersed himself in the management of the university and city museums. His initial focus was on the University Museum of History, where he contributed several Siberian shamanic artefacts to the collection, which are now housed in the university's Museum of Ethnography. Subsequently, he was commissioned by the OAIE to catalogue a collection of Russian copper coins dispatched by the Cheboksary and Tetyush district governors. In 1896, Nikolai Fedorovich published a separate edition describing I.A. Iznoskov's numismatic collection as defined by the Society. He was later drawn to the collection of the Kazan merchant V.I. Zausailov, which by 1907 contained a larger number of Bronze Age objects from the Volga-Kama region than all Russian museums combined. The collection included 5,282 Stone Age artifacts, 1,292 Bronze Age artifacts, 1,417 Iron Age artifacts, and 1,639 pieces of ceramics and glass. In 1897, Katanov took over as the head of the OAIE museum, which had critical collections due to lack of space. The collections were placed in an unsuitable corridor of the former university dormitory. In 1906, N. Katanov played an active role in creating the treasury of the Church Historical and Archaeological Society of the Kazan diocese.\nOn 26 September 1905, N.F. Katanov was elected to the Council of the City Museum during a meeting of the Kazan City Duma. He headed its historical and ethnographic department from January 1906 to the end of 1917 and held the position of treasurer while also serving as the head of the Museum Council twice (in 1906-1912 and 1914–1917). He continued to pursue his collecting aspirations and began a purposeful collection of Tatar shamail. He acquired many items at his own expense and donated them to the museum's fund. N.F. Katanov organised the historical and ethnographic museum of the Kazan Theological Academy in 1912, drawing on his experience gained at the university and Kazan City Museums. He personally acquired many items and arranged lectures on the history and ethnography of Finno-Ugric and Turkic peoples at the museum. As the museum's funds were located in the library, N. Katanov aimed to transfer the most valuable exhibits to the Kazan City Museum. In 1918, Professor Katanov took charge of the university numismatic cabinet and organized the collections, including those that had not been accessed for decades.\n\n\n=== Creative decline (1909-1917) ===\n\nMost biographers of N.F. Katanov have observed a decline in his scientific activity by the end of the first decade of the 20th century. This was due to the unfavourable socio-psychological conditions at Kazan University and the OAIE. According to the memoirs of A. N. Katanova, the daughter of the scientist, in 1894, many university professors were dissatisfied with the appearance of a 'foreigner' in their environment. Some even expressed extreme opinions, such as 'they will soon send savages to us'.\nIvan Barashkov-Epcheley, the first Khakass journalist and public figure, recounts further anecdotal stories in his memoirs. Once Nikolai Fyodorovich and his family were about to board a steamboat to Astrakhan. On the day of departure, he disembarked after settling his wife and daughter in the cabin. At the wharf, a high-ranking official from the Governor-General's office mistook him for a porter and offered him fifty kopeck to carry his suitcases. The scientist did not object. At dinner, N.F. Katanov wore a professor's vizmundir adorned with all his awards. When the official recognized him, he inquired about his rank and title. Katanov then listed a long series of his regalia. The official apologised and requested the return of the fifty kopeck. The reply was, 'Why, Your Excellency, why should I? After all, I earned it through honest labour.' Nikolai Fyodorovich attempted to ignore such incidents, but he could not fully isolate himself from them.\nAccording to his biographer S.N. Ivanov, Katanov's position in Kazan can be described as follows:\n\nThe only representative of Oriental Studies at Kazan University, Katanov was deprived of a professional academic sphere, his research interests were alien to the professors surrounding him at the Faculty of History and Philology. A recognised scholar, Katanov was forced to confine himself to reading optional courses, and his position as a \"teacher with the rank of extraordinary professor\" did not correspond to his scientific weight and authority.\nKatanov was compelled to move to Kazan as there was no place for him at the University of St. Petersburg. His resentment towards the events of 1893 persisted throughout his life. In 1904, he candidly wrote to E.K. Pekarsky, 'In St. Petersburg I did not find a shelter thanks to the diligent intrigues of some Orientalists.' His relationship with his colleagues in the capital deteriorated to the extent that N.F. Katanov pledged not to publish anything in St. Petersburg and kept his word. In the end, the scientist found himself isolated from the main centre of Russian orientalism and was indifferent to the West. Nevertheless, in 1907, V.V. Radlov published two volumes of Katanov's materials in the 9th edition of 'Samples of Folk Literature of Turkic Tribes' in St. Petersburg. The volumes contained the original language and Nikolai Fedorovich's translation. The book included 1410 titles of folklore from Tuvinians, 1159 titles from Khakasses, and 203 titles from Karagas.\n\nAfter 1908, Katanov gradually lost interest in scientific research, believing it to be useless and unnecessary. In 1913, his attempts to establish himself at the university ended with the University Council's refusal to establish permanent residencies at the departments of Turkish-Tatar and Finno-Ugric linguistics. This would have allowed Katanov to have a permanent student body. As a deeply religious man, Nikolai Fyodorovich tried to solve his crisis in church. In 1906, he joined the Church Historical and Archaeological Society of the Kazan diocese, and in 1909, he became a full member of the Tauride Academic Archival Commission. In May 1911, he decided to compete for the vacant chair of ethnography and history at the Kazan Theological Academy. The chair was specially designed for the study of Turkic languages and missionary activity among the Tatars, Chuvash, Mari, Kazakhs, and other peoples. Nikolai Fyodorovich received the majority of votes in the election but faced opposition from the former head, E. Malov. Malov accused Fyodorovich of having an 'objective and indifferent' attitude towards Orthodoxy. On October 7, 1911, the Most Holy Synod cancelled the competition results and approved Malov's protégé, A. Mikhailov, as the new head. However, after his refusal \"for family reasons\", by synodal decree of 30 November Katanov was still appointed head of the department, but with the rank of associate professor, not professor.\nAt the Theological Academy N. F. Katanov taught courses on the history of Christianity in the Volga region during the Golden Horde period and the history of Nestorianism in Central Asia and Mongolia from the 5th to the 11th centuries. He also instructed students in the Tatar language. Katanov published a 'Concise Tatar-Russian Dictionary' and a Tatar chrestomathy for students' needs. He also led the academy's museum and edited the Inorodicheskoye Obozrenie. There is the following testimony about Katanov's activities at the academy:\n\nThe lessons were given in the form of a lively oral conversation, illustrated with facts and references from personal observations of foreigners and their language - living and dead, new and old, vernacular and bookish.\nDespite his merits, Katanov was denied the title of Ordinary Professor of the academy in 1913. He did not receive it until 1915.\nBetween 1909 and 1916, N.F. Katanov's productivity sharply declined. He only published 11 works during this period, mostly consisting of notes on the Tatar language. Additionally, he neglected his duties at the OAIE, missing meetings and delaying the publication of 'Izvestiya'. He also withdrew from several commissions. The elections held on 19 March 1914 ended in scandal when Nikolai Fyodorovich was accused of embezzling the Society's financial resources and was subsequently voted out of office. Although the accusations were soon revealed to be baseless, Katanov was so offended that he severed all ties with the Society. He later sold his extensive library, which contained 7,325 volumes in 22 languages, to the Turkish Prime Minister Hilmi Pasha for 3,000 gold liras.\nThe sale of the library had a significant impact on Nikolai Fyodorovich's mental state. Following the outbreak of World War I, his focus shifted to teaching at the academy and, to a lesser extent, the university. He was in the process of preparing a chrestomathy of Gospel texts 'in various Inorodtsy languages' for third-year students at the Theological Academy. However, this work was interrupted by the revolutionary events of 1917.\n\n\n=== Life and work in Soviet Russia. Death (1918-1922) ===\nAccording to contemporaries and close associates, N.F. Katanov was far from politics and refrained from publicly announcing his views. The events of 1917 did not affect Katanov directly, but they did lead to an expansion of his professional duties. In October of that year, the North-Eastern Archaeological and Ethnographic Institute was established in Kazan, with a democratic structure that included an elected rector and student participation in management. The teachers were affiliated with the university and classes were held in the evening.\nNikolai Fyodorovich was elected as the dean of the archeological department. He delivered lectures on the history of the Golden Horde, source studies of the Volga region, Oriental numismatics, and Oriental chronology. The Oriental Department was established at the Institute in May 1919, with Katanov as its head. After the institute was transformed into the Oriental Academy in 1921, Katanov continued to work there. It was only after the proclamation of Soviet power that Katanov was able to fully utilise his skills and talents without facing opposition from nationalists and ill-wishers. In addition to teaching at the Archaeological Institute, he also taught at the Higher Institute of Public Education and the Chuvash Pedagogical Courses. Furthermore, he lectured at the Higher Eastern Music School on the topic of 'the songwriting of the Turkish-Tatar peoples'.\nOn 15 February 1919, N.F. Katanov was elected as a professor at Kazan University through an All-Russian competition. On 1 August 1921, he was officially approved for this title by the People's Commissariat for Education. On 17 January 1919, at the first meeting of the renewed Society of Archaeology, History and Ethnography, Katanov was re-elected as its chairman and also became a member of the council. On 31 January 1919, Nikolai Fyodorovich led the commission for organizing the Oriental Department at the Faculty of History and Philology at the university. Additionally, since 1918, he had been in charge of the numismatic cabinet and successfully retrieved the gold and silver coins confiscated by the Cheka. His teaching load was up to 47 hours a week, which was necessary to provide for his family during the famine years of the Civil War.\nS.N. Ivanov notes that after 1918, 'Katanov regained a taste for scientific research.' Despite the challenging conditions of devastation and civil war, he managed to publish a significant amount of material in just three years (1918–1921), equivalent to that of his previous eight years of work. Notably, he produced a 240-page work titled 'Eastern Chronology', which was based on a lecture course at the Archaeological Institute. In 1920–1921, Kazan hosted the 'Exhibition of the Culture of the Peoples of the East'. Katanov was part of the commission responsible for its organization, and he compiled a brief description of oriental coins. One of Katanov's students at the Faculty of History and Philology was Militsa Nechkina, who left evidence of her time with him in her diary and correspondence.\n\nKatanov could not avoid the hardships of Soviet life - cutting firewood and standing in queues for hours. Additionally, like many other employees of Kazan institutions, Nikolai Fyodorovich also worked on his vegetable garden. Despite his outward optimism, he began considering a move to a more prosperous location by 1921. He received offers from universities in Baku, Tashkent, Vladivostok, and Krasnoyarsk. During autumn, the scientist's body was unable to withstand the physical strain and hard work anymore, which resulted in Katanov becoming paralysed. By the start of the new year in 1922, he began to recover gradually, but then fell ill with purulent pleurisy. Despite being bedridden, Katanov wrote to the Council of the Saransk Local History Society on 11 February 1922, outlining a comprehensive research programme. In early March, N.F. Katanov's health sharply deteriorated due to tuberculosis. He was transferred to Shamov Hospital and underwent an urgent operation, but it was too late. N.F. Katanov died on the night of March 10, 1922 at the age of 59.\nThe death certificate indicates that the scientist was buried in the fence of the Spaso-Preobrazhensky Monastery within the Kazan Kremlin. In 1928, the executive committee of the city permitted the remains to be transferred to the Arskoe cemetery, where they were interred near the grave of N.I. Ilminsky, one of N.F. Katanov's first teachers. There is, however, a version that in the Arskoe cemetery, there is only a cenotaph built for the 110th anniversary of the scientist in 1972, and the actual location of his burial has been lost for some time. In 2023, A. S. Nilogov published an official record on the death of N. F. Katanov (No. 335 of 9 March 1922), which is kept in the State Archive of the Republic of Tatarstan. The record confirms that Professor Katanov died on 9 March and was buried in the Arskoe cemetery. A. S. Nilogov suggests that to determine if the current tombstone is a cenotaph, exhumation, forensic medical examination, and genetic analysis of the direct male line of the Katanov family are necessary.\n\n\n== Personality ==\n\n\n=== Character and behavioural style ===\nN. F. Katanov's character and behaviour were shaped during his time in gymnasium, and the trials he faced during that period had a lasting impact on his life. According to his contemporaries, Nikolai Fyodorovich was consistently calm, balanced, and patient. As a scientist and teacher, he was known for his pedantry and strictness, which sometimes bordered on rigidity. For all his outward reticence, Katanov, judging by the memoirs of A.A. Yarilov, was 'secretly kind inside, looking for a warm attitude to himself.' He was frugal, meticulously recording even the smallest expenses in his notebooks and diaries, but was always willing to selflessly assist colleagues who asked for his help. His contemporaries also observed his light-heartedness in everyday communication and his subtle sense of humour.\nThe diligence and abilities of N.F. Katanov are evident from the data cited by M. Pinegin regarding his work in the Provisional Committee for Press Affairs (censorship). Katanov became a censor in 1906 on Pinegin's recommendation and reviewed at least 500 manuscripts annually for approval by Tatar publishers. This is in addition to the daily documents received from the governor's office, the gendarme department, and court presences, which amounted to at least 60 pages of texts in Arabic, Persian, Chagatai, Sartan, and other Oriental languages. M. Pinegin stated that Katanov was proficient in working with 50 Western and Eastern languages. However, some memoirs and publications suggest that he was familiar with up to 114 languages. Katanov was relieved of his duties as censor in 1916.\nNikolai Fyodorovich demonstrated minimal interest in literature and art. His personal library contained no works of fiction, and he did not attend theatre or concerts. He primarily read specialized literature and historical sources in the languages that he knew. Starting in 1888, he began collecting and regularly visited antique and junk dealers in Kazan. N. Katanov collected various artefacts related to the history, ethnography, and archaeology of Turkic peoples. However, he donated almost everything he had accumulated to museums. For instance, the Kazan University Museum possesses a collection of ritual accessories used in the Siberian shamanic cult, such as knives and tambourines. Nikolai Fedorovich was an outstanding expert in oriental numismatics, and his contemporaries believed that many collections in Kazan museums could be attributed solely to him. According to I.R. Gazizullin's calculations, the modern National Museum of the Republic of Tatarstan holds 1,790 items that were transferred by N.F. Katanov.\nIn this context, the participation of N. F. Katanov in the study of the \"Historical and Archaeological Museum\" of the famous Kazan collector, Professor N. F. Vysotsky, is particularly noteworthy. \"I consider it a pleasant duty,\" wrote N.F. Vysotsky in 1908, \"to express here my heartfelt gratitude to Professor N.F. Katanov for his enlightened assistance in sorting and describing my collection.\nKatanov was also characterised by an unwillingness to take part in any kind of discussion, whether political or purely scientific. According to the memoirs of K.V. Kharlampovich:\n\nHe never engaged in polemics, either literary or verbal. In case of attacks on him, he either kept silent or gave way, ready to abandon the position where the trouble arose.\n\n\n=== Enlightenment and pedagogical views ===\nK.I. Sultanbaeva published a number of articles specifically considering the pedagogical views of N.F. Katanov. According to the researcher, Katanov's views on education for Inorodtsy were inseparable from his personal experience and socio-cultural background. His views on the Inorodtsy question were not only influenced by his origin, but also by the environment in which he grew up and was formed. As a supporter of Russification, he believed it was beneficial for Turkic peoples. He dedicated his life to assisting Inorodtsy in their introduction to European culture and civilization. In his educational activities, Katanov consistently adhered to the ideas of missionary pedagogy. This approach emphasised the importance of studying the peculiarities of the languages, ethnography, history, and psychology of the peoples. To achieve a comprehensive understanding of different peoples, an integrated approach was necessary, taking into account their historical and cultural relationships and mutual influences. Katanov believed that the personality of the teacher played a central role in the education of Inorodtsy. Missionaries with only elementary parochial school education should not be considered as suitable teachers. The teacher should be scientifically trained and fluent in the language to present the school material both orally and in writing based on scientific principles. It is important to avoid arbitrary interpretations of the teaching material.\nFrom the outset of his pedagogical career, N.F. Katanov had a dual objective: to conduct scientific research in Turkology and to provide specialized training to Russian Turkologists. The novice teacher, Katanov, had limited experience in rehearsing classmates at the gymnasium and university. However, he had a unique approach to pedagogy, incorporating a range of archaeological, historical, ethnographic, and folklore information. This information was not only obtained from literary sources but also from his first-hand experiences during his travels. Until 1915, N.F. Katanov was an associate professor, meaning attendance at his courses was optional. This required him to engage students with varying levels of motivation and preparedness. Several contemporaries' memoirs contain testimonies about N. F. Katanov's teaching methodology. For instance, N. A. Vasiliev attested:\n\nN.F. Katanov's lectures were attended by an insignificant number of orientalist Turkologists. In my first year I heard from fellow lawyers Kozhevnikov and Ivanovsky that they had decided to attend N.F. Katanov's lectures; they confessed that, having accidentally got to his hours, they sat in his sparsely populated auditorium with the liveliest interest. They were struck by the simplicity, depth of presentation and clarity of thought on every topic in Nikolai Fedorovich's programme. He was not embarrassed by the listeners' questions either. Easily using lexical material from everyday life, he gave examples of vocabulary parallels, and the culture of the word, the greatest factor of human life, from Sanskrit roots to folk expressions of the Moscow suburbs, was really revealed.\nLectures were held in a small auditorium where the scholar had collected blocks of stone with Arabic script. N.F. Katanov did not like the pretentiousness of the language, which was characteristic of the leading teachers of the time, but according to the students' memories: '...his speech flowed freely, beautifully, with such a wide and exciting wave, like a silky waddle in the steppes where his childhood was spent.' According to N.V. Chekhov (referring to Katanov himself), Nikolai Fedorovich would ask students if they were Russian and then inform them that they already knew 25 Tatar words.   For instance, he would take a Tatar word that has entered the Russian language, such as 'bashlyk', and explain that 'bash' means head and the suffix 'lyk' means an object in which something is put. K. I. Sultanbaeva identified several important didactic principles in his teaching activity:\nAccording to N.V. Chekhov (referring to Katanov himself), Nikolai Fedorovich \"would turn to the students and ask: 'Are you Russian?'  After receiving an affirmative answer, he would say: 'So you already know 25 Tatar words.' For example, I take a Tatar word that has entered the Russian language, such as \"bashlyk\", and start to analyse it, saying that \"bash\" means head, and the suffix \"lyk\" means an object into which something is put\". According to K.I. Sultanbaeva, the most important didactic principles of his teaching were:\n\nthe principle of synthesising and analysing the linguistic unit to facilitate understanding and assimilation;\nthe principle of relying on the native language of the listener;\nthe principle of developing the learner's linguistic sensitivity;\nthe principle of learning through accessible, real-life examples;\nthe principle of respect for native speakers and belief in a positive outcome;\nthe principle of integrating material from related fields of knowledge.\n\n\n== Scientific Heritage. Historiography ==\n\nDespite the breadth of Katanov's scientific interests, his main areas of focus were always ethnography, folklore studies, and the comparative study of Turkic languages. N.F. Katanov and V.V. Radlov are considered by specialists to be the pioneers of comparative-historical studies, particularly in linguistic research. Katanov's 'Short Sagai-Russian Dictionary', compiled during his gymnasium years, contains 3090 commonly used lexical units. Its materials served as the basis for the Khakass-Russian dictionaries of the 1953 and 2006 editions. Katanov, a linguist, combined the study of Oriental languages with the collection of folklore from the Khakass, Tuvinians, Karagas, Sarts, Uyghurs, and other peoples of Southern Siberia and Eastern Turkestan. He accurately documented each message.\nIn 1921, N. F. Katanov listed his published works, which comprised approximately 380 bibliographic units. However, A. Karimullin's calculations suggest that this number should also encompass approximately 900 annotations, abstracts, and reviews written by Katanov. Additionally, the catalogues and indexes compiled by Katanov include at least 7000 titles of books in various European and Asian languages. Katanov's manuscript heritage has not been fully published and only partially uncovered. His personal collection, housed in the National Archive of the Republic of Tatarstan, contains 551 files, including correspondence, newspaper clippings, and other items. Additionally, the collection includes 471 items from his library, consisting mostly of educational literature and dictionaries in Arabic, Persian, and Turkish. The scholar's extensive and multifaceted activities are documented in various locations throughout Russia and abroad.\nG.F. Blagova states that Katanov was a capable student of V. V. Radlov. However, he only continued his teacher's Turkological work in collecting materials on the language, folk literature, and ethnography of Turkic peoples who lived during his time. Following N.F. Katanov's death, his legacy was analysed in the central and Kazan press. Substantial obituaries were published by V.A. Gordlevsky, A.N. Samoilovich, N.M. Pokrovsky, K. V. Kharlampovich and others. These publications are characterised not only by the description of many remarkable facts of his biography, but also by the characterisation of the scholar's pedagogical and scientific activity, as well as various aspects of Nikolai Fyodorovich's Turkological legacy. V.A. Gordlevsky in his obituary \"In memory of N.F. Katanov\" was very critical of his legacy:\n\nKatanov only adopted what others had written, but he lacked the creative element. He laid unpolished stones for the building of Turkology, but, as the Ottomans say, \"every stone has its place\". The historian of Oriental studies will be able to appreciate the work, long and selfless, which contributed a wealth of good quality material on the languages that were little studied before Katanov.Following N.F. Katanov's death, the authorities began to view his name and scientific and public achievements negatively, due to their counter-revolutionary connotation from the perspective of Bolshevik ideology. In 1924, Tatar OGPU initiated a case against K.V. Kharlampovich, I.I. Satrapinsky, S.P. Shestakov, V.F. Smolin, S.I. Porfiriev, N.V. Nikolsky and I.M. Pokrovsky in connection with the received information about the grouping of the Black Hundred element in the Society of Archaeology, History and Ethnography. The article (obituary) by I.M. Pokrovsky on N.F. Katanov was called in the \"Final Act\" \"a characteristic example of the missionary tendencies which play a predominant role in the activities of the Council of the Society\". The name of N.F. Katanov, already deceased, was used as \"a well-known prominent missionary\" to prove the counter-revolutionary character of the orientation of the \"Proceedings of the Society of Archaeology, History and Ethnography at the University of Kazan\" and of the Society itself.\nNevertheless, objective assessments of N.F. Katanov's activities were actively used in numerous publications in the following years. The situation changed dramatically in the 1930s-1950s, when the number of publications about N.F. Katanov decreased many times over, and in the periodical press there were insults such as \"a scholarly villein of the old regime\" (the newspaper \"Krasnaya Tataria\", 1933) or \"a reactionary in science\" (\"Scientific Notes of the Khakass Research Institute of Language, Literature and History\", 1951). The scientific rehabilitation of Katanov began in 1958, when the posthumous article of S.E. Katanov appeared in the \"Bulletin of the Academy of Sciences of the Kazakh SSR\". Е. Malov's posthumous article was published in Abakan (the material dates back to 1922), and a collection of memories about the scientist, including his daughter's Anna Nikolaevna, was published. On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of Katanov's birth the famous Turkologist S.N. Ivanov wrote his biography, which was republished in 1973. Khakass scholars continued to work actively on the development of the heritage of their distinguished compatriot; in 1997 his \"autobiography\" (up to 1894) was published, compiled for use in the Vengerov dictionary.\nSince 2000, there has been a renewed interest in Katanov's heritage following the publication of a trilingual collection of his selected articles on Sayan Turks in Ankara, written in Khakass, Russian, and Turkish. In 2003, poet A. Prelovskii published a two-volume work titled 'Folklore of the Sayan Turks of the 19th Century', which was based entirely on Katanov's materials published in 'Samples of Folk Literature of Turkic Tribes'. The first volume contained Prelovsky's poetic arrangements, while the second volume included unprocessed prose materials.\nIn 2004, the Khakass State University, named after N.F. Katanov, compiled the collection 'Selected Works on Khakassia and Adjacent Territories' (edited by S.A. Ugdyzhekov). The collection includes the main works of the Turkicologist on Khakass ethnography.\nThe diaries of a trip to Tuva in 1889 were only published in 2011. The manuscript, which was prepared by the author for printing, had been kept in the archives of the Peter the Great Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography (Kunstkamera).\nIn 2005, an international seminar titled 'The Legacy of N. F. Katanov: History and Culture of Turkic Peoples of Eurasia' was held in Kazan by R. M. Valeev and V. N. Tuguzhekova from the Khakass Research Institute of Language and Literature. The seminar resulted in the publication of a collection of works (2006) and a collective scientific biography titled 'N. F. Katanov and Humanities at the Turn of the Century'. During the latter half of the 2000s, Kazan published several books and articles by historian I. E. Alekseev, which focused on the Sobriety Society's activities. The researcher highlighted the irrationality of labelling Katanov's political views as 'liberal' ('inherent in an enlightened inorodets'). On the contrary, numerous facts indicate the scientist's conservative beliefs.\nIn the 1920s, Karl Menges was granted full access to the East Turkestan text archive collected by N. Katanov, which consisted of 2,384 manuscript pages. From this collection, the researcher chose several texts that were later published by the Prussian Academy of Sciences. In 1933, Menges published 33 folklore texts. However, due to his emigration from the Third Reich, the work was delayed. In 1936, the second edition, which included Menges' bibliography, was announced under the editorship of György Khazai. In 1943, an edition of only 100 copies published another 56 texts, which became extremely rare. The edition did not mention Menges' name, but it named Katanov as the author of the work done in the preface. In 1954, Menges published a dictionary for both volumes of folklore texts. In 1976, the Institute of Ancient History and Archaeology of the GDR undertook a phototypical reprint of both Volkskundliche Texte aus Ost-Türkistan aus dem Nachlass von N. Th. Katanov.\nIn Western historiography, N.F. Katanov's work has gained renewed attention in the 2000s. R. Geraci's monograph portrays Katanov's experience as both unique and typical in the context of Russification. At the same time, there was a mixture of personal and professional identification. Acknowledging him as a supporter of Russification and Christianisation of \"Inorodtsy\" the researcher quoted Katanov's words quoted in Zaki Validi's memoirs:\n\nOf the Mongolians and Eastern Turks, three people - Dorzhi Banzarov, Chokan Valikhanov and myself - took the path of Orientalism. Each of us devoted himself entirely to Russian literature. I renounced shamanism and became a Christian in order to serve their science. Chokan and Dorzhi died of vodka before the age of 35, because our Russian colleagues taught us nothing but to drink. You will be the fourth person in this environment, but be careful. The cultural environment in which I was born and raised is not as powerful as Islam, the existence of our people is deplorable, and in the Russian environment we remained strangers.\nAgnes Nilufer Kefili's monograph provides examples of N. F. Katanov's censorship of textbooks for New-Methodist madrasas in 1910. Katanov criticized fragments of texts by Maksudi and Karimi, which claimed that Adam and Eve lived in the vicinity of Mecca, Adam was buried in India, and Judas, not Jesus, was crucified. Katanov also objected to the recommendations on washing the genitals in preparation for namaz. It was decided to use these manuals only for older students who had already received a course in European sciences in Russian and had developed 'critical thinking'.\n\n\n== Memorialisation ==\n\nOn 28 September 1987, on the basis of the museum of the Askiz secondary school, the Askiz public museum of local history named after N.F. Katanov (now - the Askizsk district museum of local history named after N.F. Katanov) was established. On 10 August 1994, by the decision of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet and the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Khakassia, the name of N.F. Katanov was given to the Khakassian State University (KhSU). In the same year, the Supreme Council of the Republic established the State Prize named after N.F. Katanov, which is awarded to the most outstanding scientists. Since then, the traditional 'Katanov Readings' have been held at N.F. Katanov KhSU.\nIn 1996, the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Khakassia issued surrogate money in the denomination of 5000 rubles, commonly referred to as 'katanovki' due to the portrait of the scientist on the reverse of the banknote.\nIn 2005, Shkolny Lane in Kazan, where N.F. Katanov resided, was officially renamed Katanovsky Lane. Prior to the revolution, it had already been informally referred to by this name. The International Independent Association of Sobriety has also suggested erecting a monument to Katanov in the city, restoring his house, and establishing a 'Museum of Sobriety' there. On 26 October 2007, a monument to N.F. Katanov was erected in Abakan on Lenin Avenue, next to the N.F. Katanov KhSU park. The monument, created by Krasnoyarsk sculptor Konstantin Zinich, depicts the scientist in full height, holding a book in his hand. The opening of the monument was part of the last anniversary block, the Days of Khakass writing and culture.\nOn 9 August 2011, the Government of the Republic of Khakassia adopted Resolution No. 507 \"On the proclamation of 2012 as the Year of N.F. Katanov in the Republic of Khakassia\", which, in particular, \"notes the great importance of the personality and scientific activity of the orientalist-turkologist Nikolai Fedorovich Katanov for the development of culture and science in the Republic of Khakassia\". The same resolution approved the \"Action plan for the year of N.F. Katanov in 2012 in the Republic of Khakassia\". On 20 May 2022, a monument to N.F. Katanov was unveiled in the village of Askiz, on the banks of the river of the same name, opposite the local administration building.\n\n\n== Main works of Nikolai Katanov ==\nОтчет о поездке в Восточную Сибирь, Монголию и северный Китай в 1890 и 1891 гг. // Живая старина. — St. Petersburg, 1892. — pp. 111–122, 134–137.\nСагайские татары Минусинского округа Енисейской губернии // Живая старина. — 1893. — Iss. 4, part III. — pp. 559–570.\nПисьма из Сибири и Восточного Туркестана / Предисловие Радлова В.

        "content": "Norman Dilworth (1931-2023) was an English artist, born in Wigan, Lancashire. His work is systematic, constructivist and concrete. It is mainly exhibited and appreciated in continental Europe, where it is held in many national collections.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nNorman Dilworth was born on 12 January 1931 in Wigan, Lancashire, where he attended Wigan Art School from 1949 to 1952. From 1952 to 1956 he studied at the Slade School of Fine Art, where he won the Tonks Prize in 1955. The following year he was awarded the Drawing Prize by the Sunday Times and a French Government scholarship to study in Paris from 1956 to 1957, where he befriended Alberto Giacometti. His work at this time took the form of paintings and drawings in black and white, using geometric forms that played with the viewer's perception. \nDuring the fifties, Dilworth was an important figure in contemporary art, exhibiting in the Young Contemporaries Exhibitions in 1953, 1954 and 1955 and the John Moores Exhibition in 1959. Dilworth's work became associated with Kinetic art and in 1966 he took part in an exhibition alongside Bridget Riley and Michael Kidner at the Herbert Art Gallery, Coventry. \nSince the 1960s, Dilworth had lived in England, teaching in several colleges. In 1971 the British Arts Council awarded him first prize for his sculpture entitled Haverfordwest. Later that year he decided to move to Amsterdam after a successful solo exhibition in The Hague. By now, his work had moved from Kinetic to Constructivist art.  \nIn 1973, Dilworth took part in 4 English Systematic Artists, the second group exhibition of the Systems Group. Although he chose not to become a member of the group, his work has a strong affinity with the group. In 1974 he won first prize for Fountain for Cardiff  by the Welsh Arts Council. \nIn 1980, Dilworth assisted Gerhard von Graevenitz in curating the exhibition Pier+Ocean, in which Dilworth's own work was included together with other Constructionist and Systems Group artists. This \"ambitious and, as it turned out, controversial\" group exhibition explored the relationship between Constructivist art and Land Art, Arte Povera, Minimalism and Conceptualism.\nWhen Dilworth moved to Lille in France from Amsterdam in 2002, the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam staged a farewell exhibition.\nDilworth's first retrospective in France took place between 8 July and 30 September 2007 at the Museé Matisse in Le Cateau-Cambrésis.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nBefore 1982, Dilworth lived in London. After 1982 he lived in Amsterdam, moving to Lille in 2002.\nDilworth was married in 1958 to Mary Webber. The marriage was dissolved in 1976. He remarried in 1982 to Christine Cadin. Dilworth died in Lille on 25 January 2023, leaving two daughters and a son from the first marriage, and two sons from the second.\n\n\n== Tributes ==\nThe commune of Paris-Plage, which hosted the works of Dilworth, paid homage to him by laying a plaque, with the artist's signature and handprints, on the ground of the Garden of Arts.\n\n\n== Solo exhibitions ==\nRedmark Gallery (London) 1968\nGalerie Nouvelles Image (The Hague) 1970\nLucy Milton Gallery (London) 1973\nGalleria Primo Peano (with Peter Lowe) (Rome) 1975\nArt Affairs, Amsterdam (Netherlands) 1995\nDurhammer Gallery, Frankfurt (Germany) 1995\nArt Affairs, Amsterdam (Netherlands) 1997\nMagnus Aklundh Gallery, Lund (Sweden) 1998\nContemporary art space, Demigny (France) 1998\nArtist in residence, Guernsey (Channel Islands) 1999\nArt Affairs, Amsterdam (Netherlands) 2000\nMuseum Het Mondriaanhuis, Amersfoort (Netherlands) 2001\nContemporary art space, Demigny (France) 2001\nStedelijk Museum, Amsterdam (Netherlands) 2002\nHet Glasen Huis, Amsterdam (Netherlands) 2003\nMuseum of Fine Arts and Lace, Calais (France) 2005\nEspace Lumière, Hénin-Beaumont (France) 2005\nOniris Gallery, Rennes (France) 2006\nBouvet Ladubay Saumur Contemporary Art Center (France) 2006\nGalerie Frontière$, Hellemmes (France) 2006\nSculpture / Art|Paris tour at the Grand-Palais, Oniris stand 2007 and 2008\nRetrospective at the Matisse Museum / Cateau-Cambrésis 2007\n\n\n== Group exhibitions ==\n1972: 4 Artists Galerie Nouvelle Image, The Hague\n1973: 4 English Systematic Artists, Amsterdam\n1974: British Painting '74, Hayward, London\n1980: Pier + Ocean: construction in the art of the seventies, Hayward, London/Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo.\n\n\n== Art collections ==\nVilla Datris Foundation for Contemporary Sculpture, L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue, France\nNational Contemporary Art Fund, La Défense, France\nMatisse Museum, Cateau-Cambrésis, France\nGrenoble Museum, France\nMontbéliard Museum, France\nCity of Valenciennes, France\nTate Gallery, London\nThe British Council, UK\nArt Council of Great Britain\nManchester City Art Gallery, UK\nNational Collection, Warsaw, Poland\nStzuki Museum.

        "content": "Sudhabala was an Indian actress from the silent era of Hindi films. She is often credited of giving break to Prithviraj Kapoor, the patriarch of the Kapoor family of the Hindi film industry. She along with Patience Cooper, Ruby Myers and Sita Devi is credited as a leading \"star\" of the 1920s-30s who had more mass appeal than their male counterparts.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nSudhabala was born as Ermelinda Cardozo or simply Ermeline to Paulo Faustino Cardoso and Maria Joaquina de Souza in the Goan island of Divar on 7 May 1908. Suffering from financial constraints from early days of her life, she never really had any formal education as her parents brought her to Bombay in search of work. She was an illiterate.\nShe got married to Saib Rocha, a leading Tiatr artist of that time. The most popular tiatr in which she acted was Lusitanian Dramatic Company's Alma Vetat Sorgar on 17 October 1932.\n\n\n== Career ==\nErmeline started off her career with the film Bhishma Pitamah under the banner of Star Films in 1922. The film starred actor Madanrai Vakil opposite her. Being the first actress of a Goan descent, she went on to feature in around sixty odd films and was fondly called as \"Mary Pickford of India\".  She along with Sulochana, went on to be one of the earliest sex symbols of Indian cinema since they were overly sexualized.\nErmeline is also credited as one of the earliest film artists who took stand against sexual harassment at workplace. A news item, “Film Star’s Story; Incidents at Hill Station,” which appeared in the Times of India on 15 September 1927, reported that she went to court, charging the director and chairman of the Shri Krishna Cinema Company with indecent assault. During the shoot of Burkhawali at Matheran, she went to the superintendent of Police that cameraman Chaturbhai Patel and film director Kanjibhai Rathod had entered her hotel room and outraged her modesty. The first magistrate who tried the case “found that the complaints were false and ordered her to pay Rs. 100. A second judge reversed this judgment because he found the first magistrate to have been biased by the fact that Ermeline was an untutored woman of loose morals and bad association.\nErmeline is often credited of giving Prithviraj Kapoor his first big break in Hindi cinema. It so happened that the actor who was originally cast as the male lead failed to appear for the shooting of the film. This sent the filmmaker into frenzy and he asked Ermeline to pick the leading man from the throng of people who came there to see her. She handpicked Prithviraj, who by then has acted in a few bit roles. This film was Cinema Girl which released in 1930. The advent of talkies posed a threat to Ermeline's career as she was not well versed with the Hindustani language. She was then restricted to play the role of vamps and eventually faded away from the film scene.\nHer most important film role was that of Draupadi in the 1931 mythological costume drama of the same name. Her other films include Zalim Jawani, Sarovar Ki Sundari, Swapna Sundari and Sharif Badmash to name a few.\n\n\n== Last days and death ==\nNot much is known about how Ermeline died. When film historian Bhagwan Garga wrote a column appealing for financial help for the actress who has turned pauper, she got him fired from his job. While some sources claim that she died broke, others believe she died in an accident on the sets of a film.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n== References ==",

A Republican, Ehrhardt represented the town of North Kingstown, Rhode Island in the Rhode Island House of Representatives from 2005 until 2013.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nEhrahrdt was born on May 20, 1940. He attended Yale University in 1961 where he received a Bachelor of Arts. Ehrahrdt went on to attend Harvard University where he graduated with a Master of Business Administration. Ehrhardt served in the U.S. Navy until 1970, achieving the rank of lieutenant.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nEhrhardt first ran for a seat in the Rhode Island House of Representatives in 2002, challenging incumbent representative Melvoid Benson. Ehrhardt lost in the general election by 35 votes.\nIn 2004, Ehrhardt ran again for the Rhode Island House of Representatives, this time winning the election and defeating Democratic opponent David W. Ashley with just over 71 votes. Ehrhardt was re-elected in the 2006 general election, defeating Democratic opponent Richard A. Welch with 248 votes. Ehrhardt was again re-elected in 2008, defeating Democratic opponent Mark A. Plympton in the general election with 579 votes. In the 2010 general election, Ehrhardt again faced Welch and was overwhelmingly victorious, receiving 3,537 votes (61.1%) to Welch's 2,256 votes (38.9%).\nIn 2012, Ehrhardt narrowly managed to defeat fellow Republican Sharon L. Gamba in the Republican Party primaries, winning with just 18 votes. In the general election, Ehrhardt was defeated by Democratic opponent Robert E. Craven Sr., receiving only 3,440 votes (45.7%) to Craven's 4,067 votes (54.0%).\nIn the 2014 Sharon L. Gamba received the Republican Party nomination for the 32nd House District. In response, Ehrhardt endorsed Craven for his re-election, stating that the newly elected Speaker of the Rhode Island House of Representatives, Nicholas Mattiello, was \"leading the House in the right direction\", and personally opposed both Gamba and her political mentor, House Minority Leader Brian Newberry.\n\n\n== References ==",

One third of seats on Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council are up for election. The 2024 West Midlands mayoral election will be held concurrently.\n\n\n== Background ==\nSandwell is a consistently Labour council, with Labour having held majorities in every election since its creation in 1973, apart from 1978 when the Conservatives gained the council. From 2018 to 2021, Sandwell was one of the few councils to be comprised fully of one party, with Labour in control of all 72 wards. In the most recent election in 2023 election both Labour and the Conservatives gained two seats each, the councillors on these seats having either switched to the Liberal Democrats or gone independent after the 2022 election. \nBoth of the parties have lost councillors over the last year. The majority of these have not had the reasons behind publicly revealed. However, it is known that Councillor Jay Anandou left the Conservatives over the rest of his party failing to back his campaign to stop development on the former Brandhall Golf Club. Additionally, two councillors switched from Conservative to Labour, citing a lack of faith in the Conservatives ability to govern.\n\n\n== Election results ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The New British Broadcasting Station or NBBS was a covert German propaganda radio station, but largely purporting to be of a British origin.\n\n\n== History ==\nOn 30 October 1939, a meeting of the Germans decided to have propaganda radio stations. The station was set up by Adolf Raskin, who later was killed in the 1940 Deutsche Lufthansa Ju 90 crash. Prof Adolf Mahr took part in some broadcasting, for Irish broadcasts.\nThe station began at Soorstrasse 33 in Berlin. Erich Metzler (15 January 1910 - ) moved to London in 1929 to study at the LSE, returning to Germany in May 1930. He took over the running of the station.\nIt also monitored the BBC, and broadcast propaganda by native English speakers, being where some British collaborators worked. The station invented stories, which the BBC believed at times; the BBC was required to have two sources for each story.\nThe station was featured in the 'Nazi Propaganda' episode of Secrets of War. Although the NBBS never typically descended into rudeness or coarse language, being largely unerringly polite until the end, the content of the broadcasts was not as pleasant as the delivery.\n\n\n== Broadcasting ==\nThe station went on air on the evening of Sunday 25 February 1940 on 50.63 metres wavelength. The station was discussed in the House of Commons on Wednesday 3 April 1940. Programmes opened with Auld Lang Syne, or similar, not unlike the later Radio 4 UK Theme.\nThere were ninety minutes daily, and the station concluded broadcast with God Save the King; it was an intentional parody of the BBC Home Service.\nIn 1942 the station tried to imply that RAF raids were ineffective, and the RAF should 'only be for close support of the army'.\n\n\n== Effect on British people ==\nEnglish regional newspapers sniggered at the many geographical and cultural faux-pas of the material being portrayed as from the UK.\n\n\n== Convictions ==\nOnce the war had finished, anyone that was found to have willingly broadcast for the NBBS would face severe punishment under the Defence Regulations, and lengthy prison sentences. Many of these people tried the excuse of 'I didn't know what I was doing', but the prosecutors merely saw this as nothing more than attempted further lying, or obvious subterfuge. Given the widespread feelings at the time, these collaborators were fortunate not to have been simply executed.\n\nLance Corporal Ronald Spillman, aged 24, of Mare Street in east London, captured at Crete, from February 1943, he read four news items a day for the NBBS; at his court martial at Chelsea Barracks, he received seven years.\nLeonard Banning, aged 37 he was prosecuted in court by Gerald Howard, receiving ten years\nCharles Gilbert, born March 1917, he claimed to be a Dutchman working for the UN until caught by an intelligence officer, aged 29 he received nine months\nJohn Lingshaw, at his trial on 1 March 1946, he was sentenced to five years\n\n\n== See also ==\nRadio and telecommunication in Berlin\nList of English-language broadcasters for Nazi Germany\nList of Allied traitors during World War II\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAn example broadcast",

He previously played for the Charleston Cougars.\n\n\n== Early life and Junior National Team career ==\nSmith grew up in Ulverstone, Tasmania and attended Australia's Centre of Excellence at the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) in Canberra. He played for the Australian U-17 National Team in the 2019 FIBA Under-17 Oceania Championship, winning first place.

On November 14, 2022, he tied Charleston's single game three-point record with 8 in an overtime game against Richmond, also scoring a career-high 29 points. Smith's personal 14–0 run against Towson in the CAA Tournament Semifinals was instrumental in the team's eventual Championship victory against UNC Wilmington. He finished the regular season with a turnover percentage of 5.8, good for the sixth best in Division I basketball that year. Overall Smith averaged 10.8 points, 1.3 assists, and 2.0 rebounds in 35 games.

That same evening Smith set a new school record for the most three's in a single game, scoring nine, and he later broke both records by scoring 32 points on 10 three's against Campbell on February 29, 2024. He recorded his 1,000th career point against UNC Wilmington on February 1 and finished the season with 294 career-three's, the second most in school history. His 112 made-three's were the ninth most made by a player in Division I that season. He was named to the postseason All-CAA Second Team after averaging 12.8 points, 1.7 assists, and 2.1 rebounds in 35 games.\nSmith earned the title of CAA Tournament MVP and a spot on the All-Tournament team after leading the 2023–24 Charleston Cougars through the postseason. His 16 points in the semifinals against Towson led the Cougars to a championship matchup against Stony Brook, where Smith's 23 points and last second steal brought the game into overtime. In the final five minutes, Smith went on a personal 6–3 run ensuring victory against the Seawolves. He scored 13 points against Final Four team Alabama in the first round of the 2024 NCAA Tournament.\n\n\n=== Senior Year ===\nSmith announced on March 30, 2024, that he would be following Charleston's head coach Pat Kelsey to the Louisville Cardinals for the 2024–25 season.\n\n\n== Career statistics ==\n\n\n=== College ===\n\nSource\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCollege of Charleston Cougars bio",

        "content": "Ilinca Manolache (born 1 August 1985) is a Romanian actress.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nManolache was born in Bucharest to actress Rodica Negrea and actor Dinu Manolache. In 2008, she graduated from the I. L. Caragiale National University of Theatre and Film.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAfter graduation, Manolache worked at Teatrul Mic in Bucharest.\nManolache is a frequent collaborator of director Radu Jude. She first appeared in his 2018 feature I Do Not Care If We Go Down in History as Barbarians, followed in 2021 by Bad Luck Banging or Loony Porn and the short film Caricaturana.\nIn 2021, Manolache created the character of Bobita, a misogynist with a penchant for foul language and a distinctive appearance achieved using a Snapchat filter. While her Instagram videos as Bobita were initially poorly received among her theater world contemporaries, the character was incorporated into her next collaboration with Jude, the 2023 comedy Do Not Expect Too Much from the End of the World.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nManolache identifies as a feminist, creating the character of Bobita in response to sexist influencers like Andrew Tate and her frustration with the conservative theater world in Romania. She spoke out against the mistreatment of actresses when I. L. Caragiale National University of Theatre and Film professor Șerban Puiu was accused of harassing his acting students. \n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nIlinca Manolache at IMDb",

        "content": "Lally Horstmann (née Léonie Lizzie Fanny Helene von Schwabach; 17 March 1898 – 10 August 1954) was a German writer and salonnière. She had a privileged upbringing as member of the Berliner Jewish bourgeoisie. During her childhood, her family was elevated to the Prussian nobility by Wilhelm II. She married a German diplomat and art collector and became involved in literary and political salons. She authored two memoirs, Kein Grund für Tränen and Unendlich viel ist uns geblieben, which documented her life in Nazi Germany during World War II. Following her husband's death in a Soviet Gulag she fled to Brazil, where she died in 1954.\n\n\n== Early life and family ==\nHorstmann was born Léonie Lizzie Fanny Helene Schwabach on 17 March 1898 in Berlin. She was the daughter of Paul von Schwabach, a banker and historian, and Eleanor Schröder, the daughter of a Hamburg banker. She was the granddaughter of the banker and diplomat Julius Leopold Schwabach and a first cousin of the writer and publisher Erik-Ernst Schwabach. The Schwabach family was Jewish, but her father converted to Lutheranism. \nHorstmann grew up in the cosmopolitan, cultivated milieu of the Jewish financial bourgeoisie in Berlin and on the Schwabach family's country estate in Kerzendorf, near Ludwigsfelde. In 1907, her father was raised to the hereditary Prussian nobility by Emperor Wilhelm II, at which point the family surname took on the nobiliary particle von (descending from). Horstmann's father was a member of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society and one of the hundred wealthiest people in the Kingdom of Prussia. Her sister, Vera, married Baron Eduard von der Heydt.\n\n\n== Adult life ==\nHorstmann married the diplomat and art collector Alfred Horstmann, who was of Jewish descent, in 1919. The couple moved to Oslo in 1920, where her husband was stationed as a diplomat, and returned to Berlin the following year. Back in Germany, they lived in a mansion in Berlin, where she managed the household. \nHorstmann hosted literary, political, and cultural salons at her country estate. She authored a variety of historical and non-fiction works, including Kein Grund für Tränen and Unendlich viel ist uns geblieben, which documented life during the war. \nThe British painter John Augustus Edwin painted a portrait of Horstmann around 1922 or 1923. It was auctioned in London at Sotheby's in January 2007. She had previously been painted, in 1921, by the Norwegian artit Edvard Munch. The Berlin City Museum Foundation owns an expressionist portrait bust of Horstmann, created by the sculptor Fritz Huf.\nHer husband was considered a \"half-Jew\" under Nazi Germany's racial laws, and survived World War II under difficult circumstances. Following the fall of the Nazi regime, the Horstmanns faced persecution and harassment by the Soviets. Following her husband's death in a Gulag in 1947, Horstmann fled to Brazil. As a widow, she was involved with the British barrister Anthony Marreco, the former husband of Lady Ursula Manners. She died in São Paulo in 1954, leaving part of her fortune to Marreco. Her gravesite was later destroyed due to construction on a road.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Project Africa was a successful attempt by British endurance athlete Russ Cook to be the first person to run the entire length of continental Africa. from the southernmost point to the northernmost point.  \nStarting from Cape Agulhas, South Africa in February 2023, it took Cook 352 days and approximately 10190 miles (16,400 km) to reach the most northerly point of Africa in Bizerte, Tunisia on 7 April 2024. Although initially planning to complete the feat in 240 days, complications with visas, injury, armed robbery, and kidnapping led to the attempt taking over three months longer. As of April 2024, Cook is the only known person to have ever run the entire length of Africa from the continent's southernmost to northernmost point.\nThe project was fundraising for two charities, The Running Charity and Sandblast, and had raised 90% of its £1,000,000 goal on 11 April 2024.\n\n\n== Route ==\nStarting from Cape Agulhas, South Africa, Cook traveled approximately  10190 miles (16,400 km) through 16 countries along the western coast of Africa to reach the most northerly point in Bizerte, Tunisia. \nThe full list of countries Cook traversed (in order of first entry) is as follows: \n\nSouth Africa\nNamibia\nAngola\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)\nRepublic of the Congo\nCameroon\nNigeria\nBenin\nTogo\nGhana\nIvory Coast\nGuinea\nSenegal\nMauritania\nAlgeria\nTunisia\nThe route included an extended stint through an extremely rural section of the Saharan desert in Mauritania along unpaved roads.  During this segment Cook was forced to run at night to avoid the excessive heat of the desert.  He was also subjected to several sandstorms and a snowstorm in Algeria. \nCook had originally planned to run from Tunisia to South Africa, however, due to Algerian visa issues he was forced to invert the route and travel from south to north. \n\n\n== Challenges ==\n\n\n=== Armed robbery ===\nOn 24 June 2023, 64 days into the attempt, Cook and his support crew were robbed at gunpoint in Angola of cameras, money, and passports containing visas for many of the remaining countries. \nFollowing the incident, in which nobody was hurt, the team received a police escort for the remainder of their time in Angola.  \n\n\n=== Health issues ===\nDuring the attempt Cook suffered from multiple bouts of food poisoning as well as catching the flu.  \nThe first bout of food poisoning occurred less than 30 days into the attempt which he ran through. Two weeks later, he began to urinate blood and protein for no clear cause forcing him to reduce his mileage for two days until it was confirmed the issue was not serious.  \nCook also suffered from several injuries during the attempt. By around day 200, Cook experienced severe back pain, forcing him to take a two day rest period during which he received treatment in a hospital in Nigeria.  \n\n\n=== Visa complications ===\nVisa complications were a regular issue, especially after the loss of passports and visas in the robbery. These issues forced Cook to pause the attempt for an extended period whilst visiting various embassies where he attempted to obtain new visas. \nThe Algeria–Mauritania border presented particular difficulties. Cook originally planned to run from north to south, however, due to a lack of an Algerian visa he reversed the route at the last minute.  Despite this, by day 278 Cook’s team had still been unable to obtain an Algerian visa. However following a post to his online following on social media which garnered large amounts of traction, he was granted a courtesy visa by the Algerian embassy in London five days later. \n\n\n=== Kidnapping ===\nOn day 102 of the run Cook was separated from his support crew in rural DRC. During this time he entered a small rural settlement where7 he was apprehended by men armed with machetes who demanded payment. He was later taken to another village seven hours further into the jungle where he was held in a hut for several days until his team were able to reach him and pay off his captors.   Following this, Cook modified his route and travelled through Cabinda rather than continuing through the DRC. Cook later described this experience as the “scariest moment” of the project and stated that “Probably for about one minute (I) thought about quitting, and then I realised I couldn't, so that was about as close as it got”. \n\n\n== Controversy ==\nHaving completed the challenge, the claim Cook was the first to run the full length of Africa was disputed by the World Runners Association (WRA) and Nicholas Bourne. The disputes center on differing routes and semantics.  The WRA agreed Cook is the first to run from Africa's southernmost to northernmost point but claims WRA member Jesper Olsen is the first to run the full length in 2010, running from Taba, Egypt to the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa as part of a world run, while Nicholas Bourne's 1998 run, starting in Cape Town, South Africa and finishing in Cairo, Egypt, was certified by the Guinness World Records in 2000. According to The Independent, \"Mr Bourne said disputes often arise around ultra-running records because there was no governing body to oversee and set criteria for long-distance challenges\". According to Guinness World Records they have no official record for the first man to have run the length of Africa because \"there is no recognised standard for the route, distance or time taken\".\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Sacred Night (La nuit sacrée) is a novel by Tahar Ben Jelloun published in 1987. It won the 1987 Goncourt Prize. This novel is a sequel The Sand Child published in 1985 .\nAn English translation was published in 2000.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe initial title of the novel was La Nuit du destin, however the publisher Jean-Marc Roberts insisted on changing it. Tahar Ben Jelloun was regularly nominated for the Goncourt Prize and won thanks to the support inside the Académie Goncourt from Edmonde Charles-Roux and outside, from Jean-Marc Roberts.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nAfter burying her father, the narrator leaves her family and decides to travel through Morocco to discover her identity as a woman. She first meets a prince, who kidnaps her on his horse and takes her to an enchanted land. She begins to discover it, but the tale is interrupted and she has to flee. Dreamlike passages, imbued with the world of the story, are frequent in this novel. After leaving the prince, the return to real life is abrupt for the narrator: she has a bad encounter in a wood, and is raped.\nShe then arrives in Agadir. While going to the hammam, she meets Assise, the woman who runs the reception. She takes pity on her and invites her to come and live with her. She asks her to keep company with her brother, the Consul, who lost his sight when he was a child. It quickly becomes apparent that they are a strange couple, with an almost incestuous relationship. The Consul and the narrator begin a relationship. As Assisi cannot bear it, she decides to take revenge on the young girl, and finds her uncle, who comes to Agadir to accuse her of lying and theft of the family inheritance. The narrator violently kills him.\nShe is sent to prison, but does not show the slightest regret for her murder, considering that she only repaired the injustice of Moroccan society. With a blindfold over her eyes, she practices living like a blind person. She escapes from her prison through her daydreams, where she becomes a princess or a saint. However, she is also attacked by her sisters: they found her, and still blame her for having played the easy role of the boy in their family. During a particularly barbaric scene, they sew her vagina shut. The last pages of the book constitute an allegorical end to the plot: the narrator is freed and goes to the sea. There, she enters a white house, which has appeared in the mist.\n\n\n== Analysis ==\nIn The Sand Child, published in 1985, Tahar Ben Jelloun gave voice to a storyteller, to tell the story of Ahmed, a young Moroccan girl whom her father had passed off as a man throughout her life, so as not to experience the dishonor of not having male heirs. In this complementary novel, Ahmed speaks again, becomes a storyteller of herself: after the death of her father, during the \"sacred night\" (the 27th night of Ramadan), she resumes her feminine identity, and decides to leave her bad memories behind. Although these two novels are complementary, they can be read independently.\nCombining real facts and magic, Tahar Ben Jelloun develops in his novel an unprecedented portrait of Morocco. The harshest features of Moroccan society are represented there: the difficult situation of women, subject to rape and male domination, the problem of begging, state crimes.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Robert R Williams was the City of Miami's 18th Mayor serving from May 13, 1937 until his successful recall on March 2, 1939.\nWilliams entered Miami politics in the late 1920s as a justice of the peace for Miami-Dade County and held that office until his district was eliminated by the county commission during redistricting. In May 1935, he was elected to the Miami City Commission. In 1937, the commission elected him Mayor of Miami. After he was charged and acquitted of bribery in 1938, a successful recall election removed him from office in 1939. Although he promised a political comeback, Williams did not return to office and died in 1966.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nWilliams was a native of Ocala, but moved to Miami in the 1910s. He worked as a grocery clerk before opening his own grocery store. He later entered the real estate business. \n\n\n== Miami politics ==\nIn 1928, Williams ran unopposed for the 9th justice of the peace district in Miami-Dade County. In November 1931, the 8th district was combined with his district after the resignation of A. E. Moore. Although reelected in 1932, the county commission eliminated his district and a state court ruled his district had ceased to exist in January 1933. He ran for the Miami City Commission in May 1935, placing third in the May 7 primary and advancing to the top six runoff a week later. He was elected to the Miami City Commission on May 14, 1935, alongside Orville H. Rigby and Alexander Orr Jr. with the most votes of any candidate. \n\n\n=== Mayor of Miami and recall ===\nHe was elected Mayor of Miami on May 13, 1937. Williams and two other city commissioners, John W. DuBose and Ralph B. Ferguson, were charged with soliciting a bribe from Florida Power & Light. All three were acquitted after a few minutes of jury deliberations on November 18, 1938. A recall election against Williams, DuBose, and Ferguson succeeded on March 2, 1939. The trio were known locally as the \"termite administration.\" During the recall election he appointed his secretary, Anna Perry, as the first woman to serve on the Miami City Commission.\n\n\n== Later life and death ==\nIn 1939, he opened a tire shop and promised a political \"comeback.\" He died on July 18, 1966.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of mayors of Miami\nGovernment of Miami\nHistory of Miami\nTimeline of Miami\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2024 Burnley Borough Council election is scheduled to be held on Thursday 2 May 2024, alongside the other local elections in the United Kingdom being held on the same day. One-third of the 45 members of Burnley Borough Council in Lancashire will be elected.\n\n\n== Background ==\nBurnley was historically a strong council for Labour. Labour held a majority on the council from its creation in 1973 until 2000, before winning the council back in 2002. The BNP became the second largest party on the council in 2003 (winning the popular vote), and Labour lost their majority the following year. The Liberal Democrats won their first majority on the council in 2010, but the council fell back into no overall control in 2011. Labour retook Burnley in 2012, and maintained control until 2019; opposition groups formed a coalition, but Labour formed a minority administration after its collapse.\nIn the 2023 election, Labour won 8 seats (up 2) with 42.2% of the vote, the Conservatives won 2 (up 1) with 22.5%, the Green Party won 2 (up 1) with 16.7%, the Liberal Democrats won 2 (down 1) with 13.5%, the Burnley and Padiham Independent Party won 1 (down 2) with 4.3%, and UKIP did not defend their seat up for election. Following the election, Labour formed a minority administration. However, in October 2023 11 councillors left the Labour Party over the party's stance on the Israel–Hamas war. These 11 independents joined with the Green Party and Liberal Democrats to form a majority coalition.\nThe seats up for election in 2024 were last contested in 2021; because of the delay of all local elections due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the seats are up for election after 3 years rather than the usual 4. In that election, Labour won 5 seats with 34.5% of the vote, the Conservatives won 4 with 32.4%, the Green Party won 3 with 16.8%, the Liberal Democrats won 2 with 9.2%, and the Burnley and Padiham Independent Party won 1 with 6.8%.\n\n\n== Previous council composition ==\n\nChanges:\n\nAugust 2023: BAPIP dissolved - Charlie Briggs, Neil Mottershead and Mark Payne sit as independents\nSeptember 2023: Charlie Briggs (independent) joins Labour; Andy Fewings (Green) resigns - by-election held October 2023\nOctober 2023: Afrasiab Anwar, Saeed Chaudhary, Shah Hussain, Mohammed Ishtiaq, Nussrat Kazmi, Syeda Kazmi, Arif Khan, Lubna Khan, Sehrish Lone, Asif Raja, and Christine Sollis leave Labour to sit as independents; Alexander Hall (Green) wins by-election\nFebruary 2024: Neil Mottershead (independent) joins Conservatives\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n== Ward results ==\nThe Statement of Persons Nominated, which details the candidates standing in each ward, was released by Burnley Borough Council following the close of nominations.

Motivations for the creation of 7amleh include arbitrary arrest by Palestinian and Israeli authorities.\n\n\n== Actions ==\nIn 2018, 7amleh estimated that 300 Palestinians had been arrested by Israeli authorities based on the monitoring of the Palestinians' Facebook and Twitter usage, using \"forecasting police\" to identify people who might carry out attacks against Israel.\nIn August 2020, 7amleh published an analysis of fake news in Palestine, with the aim of encouraging public debate about fake news and media literacy. The study, motivated by COVID-19 misinformation, was based on focus groups, a survey with 515 participants, and interviews with five experts in the monitoring of fake news. The study made recommendations for civil society and governmental organisations and for researchers based on its findings.\nIn September 2020, 7amleh argued that Emi Palmor, a former Israeli Ministry of Justice director general who became a member of Facebook's Oversight Board, was involved in censorship of Palestinian journalism and human rights defenders. 7amleh used the hashtags #FacebookCensorsPalestine and #DropEmiPalmor to attract online attention and to Facebook staff.\n\n\n== Awards ==\n7amleh was given the Index on Censorship 2020 award for digital activism.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Rapid Support Forces (RSF) occupation of the Khartoum International Airport is an ongoing military occupation of Sudan's most important airport, the Khartoum International Airport, by the Rapid Support Forces during the War in Sudan as part of the Battle of Khartoum.\nThe RSF forces managed to capture the airport in the early hours of the attacks on Khartoum, the airport itself was the place of the first official attack of the entire conflict. The attack also killed two people.\nThe occupation of the airport caused the destruction of between 10 and 20 civilian aircraft from several countries. Attacks on it continued across the occupation, destroying the airport.\n\n\n== Background ==\nKhartoum International Airport is located in the city of Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, and it is the largest airport in Sudan. It is considered the headquarters and operations center of Sudan Airways and Badr Airlines. The current location of the airport is considered a threat to air safety and urban security standards, and the Sudanese government decided to close the current airport after completing the construction of  the new Khartoum Airport, which is being built 40 km from the center of Khartoum.\nThe airport was established following World War II in 1947, and was expanded to accommodate air traffic in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\n\n== First attack and takeover ==\nIn the early hours of the morning of 15 April 2023, the Rapid Support Forces initiated a series of assaults on key installations in Khartoum, including the Khartoum International Airport. During the attack on the airport, the RSF reportedly fired on a Saudia airliner which was arriving at the airport, but no casualties were reported among the aircraft's passengers and crew. The RSF also captured the presidential palace, the residence of former Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir, and attacked a military base. In the fighting at the Khartoum airport, two civilians were killed. Hemedti claimed that the RSF controlled most of the city's government buildings, but this was disputed by Burhan.\nThe same day, several aerial attacks against the RSF targets were conducted by the SAF. Users on Facebook Live and Twitter documented the Sudanese Air Force (SAF) flying above the city and striking the RSF targets. On 17 April, the Sudanese government announced the closure of Sudan's airspace, initially limited solely to that of Khartoum. A ceasefire was declared on 18 April at 18:00 local time, leading to a reduction in fighting in the vicinity of the airport.\n\n\n== Destruction of aircraft ==\nOn 15 April 2023, the first day of war. It was shown according to Flightradar24, several aircraft belonging to Saudia, Badr Airlines, and SkyUp Airlines were damaged. Later, Saudia confirmed that one of its planes was targeted before takeoff, leading to the evacuation of all passengers, crew, and staff to the Saudi Embassy.\nLater on 17 April 2023, it was shown by an analysis made by the New York Times via satellite, from both Maxar and Planet Labs, that showed that around 20 planes were destroyed during the attacks at the airport.\nAs of 21 April, the following destroyed or damaged aircraft were reported in Khartoum:\n\n Saudia Airbus A330-300, registration HZ-AQ30\n SkyUp Airlines Boeing 737-86Q, registration UR-SQH\n Badr Airlines Boeing 737-8AL, registration 4L-MWA\n Asia Cargo Airlines Boeing 737-300F, registration PK-YGW\n Belcanto Airlines Ilyushin IL-76, registration EW-576TH\n One Ilyushin IL-62, registration ST-PRA (owned by the Government of Sudan)\nThree Ilyushin-76M\nTwo AN-74\nOne AN-12\nFollowing the conflict and destruction at Khartoum International Airport, flights on several airlines to and from Sudan were promptly cancelled. The ongoing fighting in the vicinity of the airport and the destruction of civilian aircraft posed significant challenges for evacuating foreigners from the area. As a result, many individuals had no choice but to undertake long journeys by car to Port Sudan, approximately 650 km northeast of Khartoum.\nFurthermore, the destruction of the World Food Programme's aircraft severely impacted the organization's capacity to transport staff and deliver assistance to people across the country.\nOn 28 April, a Turkish evacuation plane came under fire at the Wadi Saida airbase. The aircraft's fuselage sustained damage, particularly to the fuel system, requiring major repairs.\n\n\n== August explosion and clashes at the airport ==\nOn 26 August 2023, an explosion made near the Khartoum International Airport caused damage across the city of Khartoum. Sudanese Armed Forces later said that the explosion occurred due to a fire caused by an aviation fuel depot inside the airport. The SAF also carried out attacks against the RSF forces in the airport.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Willem Vleertman (1 August 1658 – 23 April 1742) was a prominent Dutch military officer, courier, and engineer who played an important role in various conflicts in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. He notably participated in the Battle of Blenheim, where his reconnaissance efforts proved instrumental in securing victory. Beyond his military exploits, Vleertman contributed to engineering projects, including the establishment of postal services and infrastructure improvements, and in 1717 saved Amsterdam from a flood.\n\n\n== Early military career ==\nWillem Vleertman was born in Oldenzaal, the son of Frans Vleertman, who served as a rider under Captain C. Völler, and Metta van Randen or van Grande. At the age of 14, he enlisted in the military as a cadet under General Kurt Christoph von Königsmarck. In 1673, he participated in the Siege of Naarden and the Siege of Bonn in November of the same year. On 2 August 1674, he was appointed ensign and took part in the Battle of Seneffe, subsequently being promoted to lieutenant in 1676.\nFollowing the Treaty of Nijmegen in 1678, his regiment was disbanded, and he settled as an apprentice sugar baker in Amsterdam. In 1679, he declined a captaincy offered by the Dutch West India Company, opting instead to join the foot soldiers recruited by the company to combat pirates on the Guinea coast. On 31 August 1681, he married Rebecca Beuns Mathysdr. in Amsterdam.\nIn 1686, the Duke of Brunswick summoned him to Hamburg to dismantle the fortifications erected there when King Christian V of Denmark threatened the city.\n\n\n== Nine Years' War ==\nIn 1688, he accompanied William III during the Glorious Revolution and subsequently, on the orders of the king, introduced an improved postal service between the Dutch Republic and Vienna. In 1689, he carried dispatches to Obdam, the Dutch envoy in Münster. Upon his return to England, he witnessed the Williamite War in Ireland and, after the Battle of the Boyne, served as a courier for William III to convey news of the victory.\nIn 1691, he established a postal service from Maastricht to Brussels, through Aachen to Cologne, and in the same year served as a captain in the Dutch army in Brigadier Hol's regiment in Brabant. Here, he thwarted a French plot by pretending to collaborate with the French, for which he negotiated a sum of 400,000 lire from Marshal Duras. The scheme failed when he relayed all the French plans to William III and Everhard van Weede Dijkvelt. \nIn 1692, he resigned as captain and received a concession on 11 March from Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine, for himself and his heirs to operate stagecoaches from Düsseldorf to Düren, Urdingen, and Venlo, from Cologne to Frankfurt and Augsburg, and also from Cologne to Brussels, Xanten, and Nijmegen. However, the following year, this postal service ceased due to competition. In July 1692, he once again acted as a courier for William III, announcing to the Viennese court and the Porte that His Majesty and the States-General were offering their mediation to end the war between the two countries. In 1695, he participated in the siege and capture of Namur.\nDuring the years 1697 and 1698, he accompanied a son of François de Vicq, mayor of Amsterdam, on a journey through the southern states of Europe. On 13 April 1700, in the service of Frederick IV, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, he participated in the siege of the fortress of Tönningen. On 20 January 1701, he was appointed lock keeper of the Oude Kolkssluis by the Mayor of Amsterdam. In the same year, under the famous military engineer Menno van Coehoorn, he was tasked with overseeing the cutting of the Waal near Pannerden.\n\n\n== War of the Spanish Succession ==\n\n\n=== 1701–1703 ===\nOn 16 April 1702, he served under the Prince of Nassau-Saarbrücken at the Siege of Kaiserswerth. At Coehoorn's request, he was now appointed Commissioner of the Approaches in Flanders. Sent as a courier in June to the Earl of Athlone, he learned upon arrival in Breda that Nijmegen had been overrun by the French. However, the rumor turned out to be false, and he safely reached the city. Here, he was accused by the people of being a French spy. The military council acquitted him, and the main instigators of the riot were sentenced to publish in newspapers and on the streets that all the rumors they had spread about Vleertman were slanderous. He also witnessed the conquest of Middelburg, Venlo, Stevensweerd, Roermond, and Liège, where on 14 October, with 25 volunteers, he was the first to breach the defenses, while also participating in the capture of the Castle (23) and the Carthusian Monastery (30 October). In March 1703, he was with the Dutch troops near Venlo, and later that year, at the Siege of Bonn. Here, General François Nicolas Fagel tasked him with cutting off the water supply to the city, which he succeeded in doing, and he was put in charge of the artillery and siege works on the left flank. An attempt to bribe him failed, for which he received a gift of 25 ducats from the Elector Palatine. On 8 May, he narrowly escaped injury in an explosion of gunpowder at an ammunition depot near Bonn, which killed 17 men. In August, he participated in the Siege of Huy. In September, at the Siege of Limbourg, his cool-headedness extinguished a fire in the arsenal.\n\n\n=== 1704 ===\nIn February 1704, he declined an appointment as quartermaster-general of the English troops on the Danube. Shortly thereafter, he was tasked with inspecting the war depots in Huy, Liège, and other places. In May, he joined the army under Marlborough and was present at the Battle of Schellenberg. Marlborough joined up with Prince Eugene at the plain near Blindheim and Höchstädt to face the French army which had taken up a strong position there. \nVleertman had an argument early in the morning of 13 August with two local nobles in the presence of the Duke of Marlborough and Prince Eugene. The nobles disputed with Vleertman that it was impossible for the army to pass through the marshy areas that lay before it. Vleertman maintained the opposite. A heated argument ensued. To settle the dispute, Vleertman mounted his horse and rode through those areas to the stream that ran in front of the enemy's army. Seeing him and thinking he was a deserter, the enemy signaled to him to go to a certain water mill to cross the stream. Vleertman turned his horse back to his camp, and realizing they were deceived, the enemies fired at him, but he escaped the danger due to the speed of his horse. His advice was decisive and led to the Battle of Blenheim that ended in a great victory. \nLater that campaign he was present at the Siege of Landau. Vleertman conveyed the joyful news of the campaign to The Hague and was rewarded with a gold chain. In November, he also reported the surrender of Landau to The Hague, and in December, the conquest of Trarbach.\n\n\n=== 1705–1713 ===\nIn 1705, Vleertman was once again with the Dutch army, witnessing the second Allied siege of Huy in July and participating in actions at Gheete, Diest, and Aarschot. He followed the headquarters to Ohain and Wavre in July, and in September, was at ZoutLeeuw and shortly thereafter at Aarschot. In October, he witnessed the siege and capture of Zandvliet, after which he accompanied the army to Turnhout. By January 1706, he was already in the field again, at Maastricht; on 26 May, he brought news of the victory at Ramillies to The Hague, and on 1 June, he went to Düsseldorf on the orders ofDaniël van Dopff to report. In July, he participated in the Siege of Ostend and in August, brought the joyous news to The Hague that Menen had been taken, and in September, the conquest of Dendermonde, after which he attended the Siege of Ath.\nShortly thereafter, he resumed his duties as a lock-keeper and remained in Amsterdam in 1707. The following year, he was back in the field and in July, he was the messenger of the joyful news of the victory at Oudenaarde. In July, he went on a reconnaissance mission to Picardy under Brigadier Dewits. In August, under his supervision, the trenches were dug at the Siege of Lille, where he narrowly escaped death when a mine collapsed. In October, he was once again tasked with building bridges over the moats at the siege of Aire. In 1709, he was with the Allied army at the Siege of Tournai, the Battle of Malplaquet and played an active role in the Siege of Mons.\nIn 1710, the Burgomasters of Amsterdam allowed him to undertake another \"Field Expedition,\" and he proved his skills as a capable engineer during the sieges of Douai, Béthune, St. Venant, and Aire. In April 1711, he was with Marlborough at Bouchain, and in June, he provided ammunition to Menen and Kortrijk, where he was captured by the French, but only for a short time: soon after, by constructing a road through a marsh near Marchiennes, he saved the army from encirclement by the French. He then devoted himself again to improving the postal service, including that between Nijmegen and Cologne.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nAfter the Peace of Utrecht, he traveled to England in the retinue of the Princess of Wales. In 1714, he served King Frederick William I of Prussia and in 1715, during the Siege of Stralsund, he was in charge of supplying the besieging artillery and building a bridge of gabions over the moat. After enduring a severe illness, carefully nursed by the king's personal physician, he returned to Amsterdam in 1716.\nBy capturing the renowned Georg Heinrich von Görtz, minister of Charles XII of Sweden, on 20 February 1717 in Arnhem, he once again demonstrated his promptness, while in December 1717, he prevented Amsterdam from flooding by installing a cistern on the Haarlemmerdijk when it was threatened by the surging seawater. In 1718, he conducted an inspection with the surveyor Maurits Walraven of the sea gates at Texel, Eierland, and Vlieland. In 1721, he again acted as a courier, delivering a portrait of George I of England to Arnhem, which the king offered to the city government as thanks for arresting Görtz. In 1728, he greatly served Dutch trade by preventing the establishment of a competing East India Company in Altona, Hamburg.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nBlok, P.J.; Molhuysen, P.C.

His family on his mother's side is from South Africa. In 2016, his father accepted the role of head master at Mount Saint Patrick College and the family subsequently relocated 20km south of the Queensland-New South Wales border to the Northern Rivers region. Clohesy then began playing football for the Coolangatta Blues in the junior Gold Coast league and shortly after joined the Gold Coast Suns Academy for the following three years. His stint on the Gold Coast entailed multiple representative honours, which included representing the Suns at the U16 Academy Championships as well as Queensland at the U16 National Championships alongside future AFL teammate Alex Davies. \nA year later he returned to Victoria with his family and began playing for the Calder Cannons in the Talent League in an attempt to further his chances of being drafted into the AFL. Clohesy went undrafted in 2020-21 and subsequently signed to play for Werribee in the VFL. He played a starring role in Werribee's run to the 2023 VFL Grand Final and was awarded the Fothergill–Round–Mitchell Medal for his outstanding season which culminated in Clohesy being rookie drafted by the Gold Coast Suns in November 2023.\nHis brother Ted Clohesy plays for Geelong in the AFL.\n\n\n== AFL career ==\nClohesy made his AFL debut for the Suns  in round 4 of the 2024 season against the Greater Western Sydney Giants.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSam Clohesy's profile on the official website of the Gold Coast Football Club\nSam Clohesy at AustralianFootball.com \nSam Clohesy's playing statistics from AFL Tables",

        "content": "Idun is a future Swedish icebreaker. The ship was built in 2006 as Polar Pevek and stationed at the De-Kastri terminal in the Russian Far East. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the vessel's Norwegian owner withdrew from Russia and renamed it Polar Circle. In 2024, the Swedish Maritime Administration decided to acquire the ship.\n\n\n== Design ==\nIdun is 74.36 metres (244 ft) long overall and 64.45 metres (211 ft) between perpendiculars, and has a beam of 17 metres (56 ft) and draft of 6.135 metres (20 ft). The vessel is classified as an icebreaker with DNV's ice class ICE-10. The vessel is equipped with a towing winch in both bow and stern, fire-fighting equipment for extinguishing fires onboard other ships, a 300-square-metre (3,200 sq ft) cargo deck, and accommodation for 18 persons.\nIdun has a diesel-electric power plant with four nine-cylinder Bergen C25:33L9A medium-speed main diesel generators rated at 2,505 kilowatts (3,359 hp) each, two 1,440-kilowatt (1,930 hp) Cummins QSK60-M auxiliary diesel generators, and a 310-kilowatt (420 hp) Cummins QSM11 emergency diesel generator. The icebreaker is propelled by two 5-megawatt (6,700 hp) ABB Azipod azimuth thrusters that produce a bollard pull of 115 tonnes-force (127 short tons-force; 1,130 kN) in ahead and 95 tonnes-force (105 short tons-force; 930 kN) in astern direction, and enable the vessel to break up to 1.5 metres (4.9 ft) thick ice. In addition, Idun has a 700-kilowatt (940 hp) bow thruster for maneuvering. The icebreaker's service speed in ice-free waters is 12 knots (22 km/h; 14 mph).\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Development and construction ===\nThe icebreaker is based on the MM65 ICE design developed by the Norwegian ship designer Multi Maritime. One of the ship's designers described the vessel having the most complicated hull form they had ever made.\nThe hull was built by Aker Tulcea SA in Tulcea, Romania and towed to Aker Yards AS Langsten in Tomrefjord, Norway for outfitting. The keel of the ship was laid on 16 March 2005 and the vessel was launched on 18 October 2005. The ship was given the name Polar Pevek (Russian: Полар Певек) on 2 June 2006 with Joanne Marie Harley as its sponsor. The ship was delivered to the 50/50 joint venture between GC Rieber Shipping and Primorsk Shipping Corporation on 27 June 2006.\n\n\n=== Polar Pevek (2006–2022) ===\nFew months after delivery, Polar Pevek was reflagged to Russia and stationed at the De-Kastri terminal where the icebreaker's primary task was to assist shuttle tankers transporting oil from the Sakhalin-I project.\nIn 2015, Primorsk Shipping Corporation sold its 50% ownership share of the vessel to Maas Capital Offshore, a wholly-owned investment fund of the Netherlands-based ABN AMRO Bank N.V..\nIn September 2021, Polar Pevek's original 15-year charter with Exxon Neftegas was extended by two years until September 2023.\nShortly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, GC Rieber Shipping started the process of exiting its business in Russia. In June 2022, the company terminated Polar Pevek's charter ahead of schedule and the vessel departed Russia. \n\n\n=== Polar Circle (2022–2024) ===\nAfter having been reflagged to Cyprus and given a new name, Polar Circle sailed from the Russian Far East through the Panama Canal and, during the second half of 2022, visited various cities along the Atlantic coast of the United States and Canada. Afterwards, the vessel headed to Norway for lay-up.\nIn February 2023, GC Rieber Shipping acquired the full ownership of Polar Circle after entering into an agreement with the joint venture partner, Maas Capital Offshore, to purchase its 50% share of the vessel.\n\n\n=== Idun (2024 onwards) ===\nIn December 2023, the Swedish Maritime Administration issued a request for tender for the acquisition of an existing icebreaker from the second-hand market to provide relief to the oldest and smallest Swedish state-owned icebreaker, the 1973-built Ale, which typically accumulates the most operating hours during the Baltic Sea winter navigating season. Following the selection of Polar Circle as the winner, the icebreaker was brought to the Bothnian Bay for icebreaking trials in early March after which the Swedish Maritime Administration decided to purchase the vessel. The vessel will be drydocked before the next icebreaking season and fitted with a towing notch in the stern.\nIn April 2024, the Swedish Maritime Administration announced that the new icebreaker would be named Idun after Iðunn, the goddess associated with apples and youth in the Norse mythology. The new name would continue the tradition of naming Swedish icebreakers after the Norse gods and reflect how the 2006-built vessel, much younger than the other Swedish icebreakers, would begin rejuvenating the Swedish Maritime Administration's fleet. It is also the first Swedish icebreaker to receive a female name. As of April 2024, the name of the ship has not yet been changed.\n\n\n== References ==",

These systems play a crucial role in facilitating efficient and sustainable transportation, alleviating traffic congestion, and enhancing connectivity within urban areas. The rapid transit networks in Turkey consist primarily of metro, light rail, and tram systems, with ongoing expansions and developments aimed at meeting the growing transportation needs of its urban population.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe history of rapid transit in Turkey dates back to the late 20th century when the first metro systems were introduced in Istanbul and Ankara. The Istanbul Metro, which opened its first line in 1989, marked the beginning of rapid transit development in Turkey. Over the years, various cities across the country have initiated their own rapid transit projects to address the increasing demand for efficient public transportation.\n\n\n== Current Systems ==\n\n\n== Under construction ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nTransportation in Turkey\nList of metro systems\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== System references ===\n\n\n=== Ridership references ===\n\n\n=== Under construction system references ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nUrban rail systems in Turkey",

        "content": "The environmental damage of Gaza caused by the Israel–Hamas war is extensive and likely to be long lasting. Due to a combination of destruction of agricultural land, displacement of people, bombing and the Israeli blockade, the Gaza Strip is experiencing famine with most of the population at imminent risk of starvation. By March 2024, 38–48% of tree cover and farmland had been destroyed by Israeli forces by using bulldozers and dropping tens of thousands of bombs.\nIsraeli bombardment and the blockade has led to a total collapse of Gaza's civil infrastructure, including sewage treatment, waste disposal, water management, fuel supplies. Water has been polluted by 100,000 cubic metres of sewage being discharged into the sea every day due to Israel cutting off fuel supplies. Groundwater has been contaminated by toxins and munitions and air has been polluted by smoke and particulates from bombing. Soils have been degraded by uprooting trees and contaminated by toxins, munitions, heavy bombing and demolitions. Bombing by the Israeli army has created 22.9 million tonnes of debris and hazardous material, much of which contains human remains.\nThe size and lasting impact of the destruction have led to calls for the Israeli Government to be investigated for the war crime for ecocide under the Rome Statute for “widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment”.\n\n\n== Pollution ==\nBetween 7 October 2023 and April 2024 the Israeli military has dropped 10,000s of bombs on Gaza, with 50% to 62% of all buildings damaged or destroyed by January 2024. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) estimates that the bombing by Israel has created 22.9 million tonnes of debris and hazardous material, much of which contains human remains. UNEP has found that heavy bombardment of populated areas like the Gaza strip contaminates soils and groundwater for the long term. This is caused through the munitions themselves and when damaged and destroyed buildings release hazardous materials including asbestos, fuel and industrial chemicals into the air, soil and groundwater. UNEP state:\n\nThis is an extremely large amount of debris, especially for such a small area... components of the debris and rubble can contain harmful substances like asbestos, heavy metals, fire contaminants, unexploded ordnance, and hazardous chemicals.\nThe siege has resulted in the total collapse of Gaza's civil infrastructure; sewage treatment, waste disposal, water management, fuel supplies have all broken down. In the 150 days since 7 October, 70,000 tonnes of solid waste had accumulated in Gaza with 60 informal waste dumps being created in central and southern Gaza. On 7 October 2023 Israel cut off Gaza's fuel supplies, the resulting power cuts meant that wastewater could not be pumped to the treatment plants. This has led to 100,000 cubic metres of sewage being discharged into the sea every day. Groundwater has been contaminated by toxins and munitions. Soils have been degraded by uprooting trees and contaminated by toxins, munitions, heavy bombing and demolitions. The air in Gaza has been polluted by smoke and particulates from bombing.\n\n\n== Destruction ==\n\n\n=== Overview ===\nBy March 2024 38–48% of tree cover and farmland had been destroyed by Israeli forces by using bulldozers and bombing. Investigative journalists Bellingcat have found that 1,740 hectares (4,300 acres) of land has been cleared in the area south of Gaza City for Israeli forces to build a new road, Route 749, which runs across the entire width of the Gaza Strip. Palestinian Environmental NGOs Network “The Israeli occupation has completely damaged all elements of life and all environmental elements in Gaza – they completely destroyed the agriculture and wildlife\". Reuters has described the damage done to Gaza by Israeli as turning it into a 'wasteland'.\n\n\n=== Destruction of farmland, orchards and forests ===\nBefore 7 October 2023, around 170 km2 (65 sq miles) of the Gaza strip was farms and orchards, 47% of Gaza's total land area. By the end of February 2024 satellite data showed that the Israeli military had destroyed more than 65 km2 of farms and orchards (38% of the total). Tractors, tanks and vehicles were used by Israli forces to uproot the orchards and fields of crops. In total 2,000 agricultural sites, including farms and greenhouses had destroyed and have often been replaced with Israeli military earthworks. Of the 7,500 greenhouses around a third have been entirely destroyed, 90% have been destroyed by Israli troops in the north of Gaza and around 40% in Khan Younis.\nBetween 7 October and 21 March 48% of Gaza's tree cover has been lost or damaged by the Israeli military and by people trapped in Gaza cutting wood for cooking and heating due to the fuel blockade.\nResearch by the University of London research group Forensic Architecture found that since 2014, Palestinian farms bordering Gaza's perimeter have had crops sprayed by airborne herbicides and have been regularly bulldozed. Farmers have been fired at by Israeli occupation forces snipers. Israel has indicated it wants to create a permanent 'buffer zone' around Gaza, where much of the agricultural land was located. Research by Forensic Architecture found that “along that engineered ‘border,’ sophisticated systems of fences and surveillance reinforce a military buffer zone”.\n\n\n== Impact on human health ==\n\n\n=== Famine ===\n\nDue to a combination of destruction of agricultural land, displacement of people, boming and the Israeli blockade, the Gaza Strip is experiencing famine with most of the population there at imminent risk of starvation.\n\n\n=== Long term impact ===\nThe Dutch peace organisation PAX has stated: “War generally collapses everything. In Gaza, it’s making people exposed to additional risks from pollution, from polluted groundwater. It’s the destruction of anything the civilian population depends on.”\nUniversity of London research group Forensic Architecture have described the destruction as systematic and that the Israeli military are intentional targeting of the Gaza's agriculture, stating “What’s left is devastation... an area that is no longer livable”. They said:\n\nThe targeted farms and greenhouses are fundamental to local food production for a population already under a decades-long siege.... the effects of this systematic agricultural destruction are exacerbated by other deliberate acts of deprivation of critical resources for Palestinian survival in Gaza.\n\n\n== Ecocide ==\n\nThe size and lasting impact of the destruction have led to calls for the Israeli Government to be investigated for the war crime for ecocide under the Rome Statute for “widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment”.\nUniversity of London research group Forensic Architecture research project \"No Traces of Life, Ecocide in Gaza 2023 – 2024\" found that “The destruction of agricultural land and infrastructure in Gaza is a deliberate act of ecocide... the targeted farms and greenhouses are fundamental to local food production for a population already under a decades-long siege. The effects of this systematic agricultural destruction are exacerbated by other deliberate acts of deprivation of critical resources for Palestinian survival in Gaza”.\nSaeed Bagheri, Reading University lecturer in international law stated \"there are enough grounds to investigate the damage done to Gaza’s environment\".\nThe Palestinian Environmental NGOs Network has stated \"What is happening is, for sure, ecocide... [It] is completely damaging the environment in Gaza for the long term, not only for the short term.\n\n\n== References ==",

High temperature transesterification of this with stearyl alcohol gives the final product.\n\n\n== Applications ==\nOctadecyl 3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate is significantly less volatile than simpler phenolic antioxidants such as butylhydroxytoluene (BHT). This makes it more suitable to stabilising plastics, as it is not driven out by the high temperatures experienced during plastic extrusion and moulding, when they are heated to 150-320 °C (300–600 °F). It is widely used in the commodity plastics, particularly in polyethylenes and polypropylene. It has approval for use in food contact materials, such as plastic food packaging in the EU and US, amongst others.\nIt is one of the most common polymer antioxidants, in part because of its comparatively low price. The stearyl tail reduces volatility and gives good chemical compatibility with plastics but contributes nothing to antioxidant performance. When higher performance is needed pentaerythritol tetrakis(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamate) a common alternative.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Tilpi-Dhosa is an archaeological site of Indian state of West Bengal. The archaeological site is situated on the right bank of Piyali River, which spans both Tilpi and Dhosa villages. Exploration and limited archaeological excavations in both these villages have uncovered 2,200-year-old artefacts and Gupta-era Buddhist stupa.\nExcavations have been conducted at various times at the site. Artifacts found during the excavations prove the antiquity and archaeological importance of Tilpi-Dhosa. Major part of the artifacts are preserved in the State Archaeological Museum of West Bengal. Chinese Buddhist monk Fa-Hien mentioned visiting a large mound in the vicinity of Tilpi-Dhosa, which roughly corresponds to the location of the village of Dhosa; a large number of terracotta bricks have been found here, which is evidence of the presence of a large well-built structure.\n\n\n== Archaeology ==\nResidents of Tilpi and Dhosa villages have recovered ancient terracotta bricks and idols at different times, so they are aware of the ancient settlement. However, there are no mounds in the two villages, which are mostly formed from the ruins of ancient settlements. Survey exploration and excavation by the Archeology Department of the Government of West Bengal in two villages yielded evidence of ancient settlements. Excavations were carried out between 2005 AD and 2007 AD, which extending the human settlement at both villages to 200 BC. According to archaeologists, this place was connected by waterway to Chandraketugarh through Piyali and Bidyadhari rivers.\nArchaeologists claim that the first cultural phase of the site spanned from the 2nd to the 1st century BC. However, most of the Gupta period artefacts have been found from the site. No urban features or presence of forts were found in the two villages, which indicating a rural and agricultural settlement at the site. According to artefacts from the village of Tilpi, the fire occurred in the 3rd century AD, and the village is no longer inhabited, but it was re-inhabited in the 16th–17th centuries. An ancient building-structure has been identified in the village of Dhosa, which archaeologists have referred to as a Buddhist stupa and identified as the Buddhist stupa mentioned in Fa-hien's description.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nJha, D.N.

        "content": "The Late Shang, also known as the Anyang period, is the earliest known literate civilization in China, spanning the reigns of the last nine kings of the Shang dynasty, beginning with Wu Ding in the second half of 13th century BC and ending with the overthrow of the Shang by the Zhou in the mid-11th century BC.\nThe state is known from artifacts recovered from its capital at a site near Anyang now known as Yinxu and other sites across the North China Plain.\nOne of the richest finds was the Tomb of Fu Hao at Yinxu, thought to belong to a consort of Wu Ding mentioned in Shang inscriptions.\nMost Shang writing takes the form of incriptions on oracle bones used for divinations on behalf of the king.\nShang ritual focussed on offerings to ancestors, enabling modern investigators to deduce a king list that largely matches that of the traditional histories of Sima Qian and the Bamboo Annals.\nThe inscriptions also give insight into royal concerns such as weather, the harvest, warfare with neighbouring polities, and mobilizing workers for warfare or agricultural work.\nThe Late Shang shared many features of the earlier Erlitou and Erligang cultures, including the rammed earth technique for foundations of rectangular walled compounds.\nBronze casting reached new heights of decoration and a volume unmatched elsewhere in the world at that time.\nWorkshops in the capital produced ceramics and carved stone and bone for a variety of ceremonial, decorative or utilitarian purposes.\nBesides writing, new features of the Late Shang included horse-drawn chariots, massive royal tombs and human sacrifice on an unprecedented scale, both in divination rituals and in royal burials.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\nIn 1898, the scholar Wang Yirong realized that the markings on ancient bones being sold by Chinese pharmacists were an early form of Chinese characters.\nBy 1908, Luo Zhenyu had traced the bones to the village of Xiaotun on the northwest outskirts of Anyang in modern Henan province.\n\n\n=== Excavations at Anyang ===\n\nThe area was quickly recognized as the last capital of the Shang dynasty and named Yinxu 'ruins of Yin' from the name Yīn (殷) used by the Han historian Sima Qian for the Shang dynasty and by the Bamboo Annals for the dynasty and its last capital.\nHowever, the name does not appear in the oracle bones, which refer to the state as Shāng (商), and its ritual centre as Dàyì Shāng (大邑商 'Great Settlement Shang').\nIn 1928, Dong Zuobin located the pits from which the oracle bones had been dug.\nThe Academia Sinica undertook archaeological excavation of the site until the Japanese invasion in 1937, resuming in 1950.\nA permanent work station was established on the site in 1959.\nThe city covered an area of some 25 km2 (9.7 sq mi), focussed on a complex of palaces and temples on a rise surrounded by the Huan River on its north and east, and with an artificial pond on its western side.\nFurther caches of oracle bones were discovered nearby.\nThe area immediately to the south of the palace district contained craft workshops and the residences and cemeteries of the Shang elite.\nThe rest of the city consisted of lineage-based settlements or neighbourhoods, with graves close by residential areas.\nMore workshops, handling bronze, pottery, jade and bone, were concentrated in at least three production zones: south of the palace district, east of it across the river, and in the west of the city.\nThe Anyang site had no city wall, and a canal or moat around the central district became blocked in the later reigns, suggesting that the Shang felt no danger of invasion.\nOn the other side of the river, 2.5 km (1.6 mi) to the northwest, a royal cemetery was found on the Xibeigang ridge. Shang kings were buried in large ramped tombs with extensive human and animal sacrifices.\nThe royal tombs had been systematically looted, but in 1976 an undisturbed medium-sized tomb was discovered in the southwest part of the palace district.\nMany of the grave goods recovered were inscribed with the name of Fu Hao, a military leader and consort of Wu Ding known from the oracle bone inscriptions.\nThe Tomb of Fu Hao yielded some 1,600 kg (3,500 lb) of bronze vessels, weapons and tools, as well as hundreds of jades and other worked stones, bone carvings and pottery.\nIn 1999, the remains of a walled city of about 470 ha (1,200 acres) were discovered across the Huan River from the well-explored Yinxu site.\nThe city, now known as Huanbei, contains a palace-temple compound, in which the foundations of two compounds have been excavated.\nHuanbei was apparently occupied for less than a century and deliberately destroyed by fire around the time of the construction of the Yinxu complex.\n\n\n=== Precursors ===\n\nPostwar excavations uncovered earlier urban centres in the area just south of the east-west stretch of the Yellow River.\nErlitou, in the valley of the Luo River, flourished in the early part of the 2nd millennium BC.\nIt was succeeded in the middle part of the millennium by the Erligang culture, centred on a large walled city at Zhengzhou and expanding across an area stretching as far south as the Yangtze River.\nAround 1300 BC, for reasons that are still unclear, most of the Erligang walled settlements were abandoned and new regional developments from the culture arose.\nBy this time, the sophisticated bronze casting techniques developed by Erlitou and Erligang had spread to, and been further developed by, a string of local cultures along the Yangtze river, from Sanxingdui in the Sichuan basin to Feijiahe near Dongting Lake and Wucheng in the Gan River valley.\nIn the north, intermediate pottery types from before the rise of the Late Shang have been found at sites such as Xiaoshuangqiao and Huanbei.\n\nSeveral features of Late Shang material culture were already present at Erlitou and further developed during the Erligang period.\nThese include the rammed earth construction technique for walls and foundations, which had been used since the neolithic Longshan culture, and rectangular walled compounds containing pillared halls around a courtyard.\nCasting of bronze vessels began on a limited scale at Erlitou.\nDuring the Erligang period, casters developed a technique of stepwise casting that permitted shapes of arbitrary complexity.\nHuman sacrifice was also practised in the Erlitou and Erligang cultures, though on a much smaller scale than seen at Anyang.\nOther inherited features included the use of jade, the dagger-axe as a standard weapon, burial practices, and pyromancy using tortoise plastrons and ox scapulae.\nThe most prominent innovations of the Late Shang – writing, horse-drawn chariots, massive tombs and human sacrifice on an unprecedented scale – all appeared at about the same time, in the reign of king Wu Ding.\nThe Shang script is believed to be an indigenous development.\nIn contrast, the sudden appearance of horses and chariots similar in form to those used across the Eurasian steppe, with all the associated technology, is thought to represent an import from the northwest.\nIn a band of highlands stretching from the edge of the Tibetan plateau, through the Ordos Plateau and on to the northeast lay a series of cultures that transitioned in the early second millennium BC from an agricultural economy to a mixed agropastoral or fully pastoral economy.\nThese cultures served as an interface between the plains cultures and those of the Eurasian steppe, and had been the vector through which bronze metallurgy reached the North China Plain in the early second millennium BC.\nOther novel features of the Late Shang include bronze mirrors and animal-headed bronze knives derived from these northern-zone cultures.\n\n\n== Writing ==\n\nThe earliest attestation of the Chinese language dates from the Late Shang period.\nThe vast majority of surviving Shang texts are divinatory inscriptions on oracle bones, with a smaller number of bronze inscriptions and carvings on other materials.\nSome of the pictographs suggest that the Shang also employed brush writing on bamboo and wooden slips like those known from later periods, but none of these materials have survived.\nThe oracle bone script consists of an early form of Chinese characters, with each graph representing a word of early Old Chinese.\nOver 4,000 graphs have been catalogued, though the exact number depends on which are considered graphic variants.\nA little over 1,200 words have been identified with certainty, but this set includes the core of the Chinese lexicon.\nA further 1,000 characters consist of identifiable components, but have no agreed interpretation.\nMost of the unknown characters are thought to represent proper names.\nThe grammar of the language is broadly similar to that of Western Zhou bronze inscriptions and received texts.\nAs in later forms of Chinese, the basic word order is subject–object–verb, with adjectives and adjectival phrases preceding the nouns they modify.\nThe script provides little information on the sounds of the language, but several cases in which a character is borrowed or modified to write a different word are consistent with current theories on the sounds of Western Zhou Chinese.\n\n\n== Chronology ==\nShang notions of time were based on the rhythms of the agricultural lifestyle, overlain with the ritual schedules they created.\nDivinations were concerned with the immediate past and present.\nThe longest unit of time used was the lunar month, until the reigns of the last two kings, when ritual cycles roughly a year long were counted.\nTherefore modern scholars have had to painstakingly assemble larger-scale Shang chronology from tens of thousands of inscriptions.\n\n\n=== Measurement of time ===\nThe most common terms for parts of the day were based of the motions of the sun or on social events: míng (明 'brightness', i.e. dawn), dàcǎi (大采, around 8 a.m.), xiǎoshí (小食 'small meal'), zhōngrì (中日 'midday'), zè (昃 'afternoon'), dàshí (大食 'large meal'), xiǎocǎi (小采, around 6 p.m.) and zhuó (斲 'cleaving'), the point during the night when the next day began.\nIn the inscriptions, these terms are almost always associated with past events, with future events usually discussed in terms of days.\nThere is some evidence that the Shang houses had torches to illuminate the night hours.\n\nThe Shang named each day with a pair of terms (later known as Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches) representing the position of the day in concurrently running cycles of 10 and 12 days respectively, yielding a 60-day cycle.\nFor example, yǐwèi (乙未) was day 2 of the 10-day cycle and day 8 of the 12-day cycle, and thus day 32 of the 60-day cycle.\nThe 60-day cycle seems to have been widely used among elites in northern China during the Late Shang period, and most scholars assume that it continued uninterrupted through the succeeding Western Zhou period into the Springs and Autumns period, when a correspondence with Julian days is secure.\nA 10-day period (xún 旬) also functioned as an early Chinese week in expressions such as 'three xún and one day', meaning 31 days.\n(Shang day counts tended to include both the start and end days of an interval.)\nThe incantation xún wáng huò (旬亡禍) '[in the next] ten days [there will be] no disasters' was commonly divined on the last day of each ten-day period.\nThere was no corresponding term for a 12-day period.\nDiviners regularly recorded the appearance of a new moon, often assigning it a number.\nMost scholars believe that the first moon for ritual purposes was the first after the winter solstice.\nThe ritual schedule became increasingly elaborate.\nBy the last two reigns, a full cycle of the five rituals took 36 or 37 xún, approximating the length of a solar year.\nAt around this time, diviners also began to record dates in terms of the number of ritual cycles in the current reign and the current position in the latest cycle.\n\n\n=== King list ===\nThe oracle bones record sacrifices to previous kings and the ancestors of the current king, as in this inscription from the reign of Wu Ding:\n\n己未卜禱雨自上甲大乙大丁大甲大庚大戊中丁祖乙祖辛祖丁十示率羝Crack-making jǐwèi (day 56). Praying for rain to (the ancestors) from Shàng Jiǎ (to) Dà Yǐ, Dà Dīng, Dà Jiǎ, Dà Gēng, Dà Wù, Zhōng Dīng, Zǔ Yǐ, Zǔ Xīn, and Zǔ Dīng, the ten ancestors, (we will) lead-in-sacrifice (?) a ram.\nFrom such evidence, scholars have assembled the implied sequence of kings and their genealogy, finding that it is in substantial agreement with the later accounts, especially for later kings.\nAccording to this implied king list, Wu Ding was the twenty-first Shang king.\nRitual records name a deceased Shang king (or other personage) using one of the day-names of the 10-day Shang week, with a distinguishing prefix.\nThe prefix used depended on the relationship to the current king, with near predecessors denoted by kinship terms such as 兄 Xiōng (elder brother) or 父 Fù (father).\nThe names of more distant predecessors employed prefixes such as 大 Dà (greater), 中 Zhōng (middle), 小 Xiǎo (lesser), 卜 Bǔ (outer), 祖 Zǔ (male ancestor), 武 Wǔ (martial) and a few more obscure names.\nHowever, the day-name assigned to an individual remained fixed.\nThere is no consensus on how these day-names were assigned, but their unbalanced distribution makes it unlikely that they reflect days of birth or death.\nDue to the fall of Shang, no such rituals are recorded for the last king, and there is a single record that might refer to the second-last king, so they are conventionally referred to by the names they were given in later accounts, such as Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian.\nThe prefix 帝 Dì (emperor) in these names is thus anachronistic.\n\nThe oracle bones also identify six pre-dynastic ancestors: 上甲 Shàng Jiǎ, 報乙 Bào Yǐ, 報丙 Bào Bǐng, 報丁 Bào Dīng, 示壬 Shì Rén and 示癸 Shì Guǐ.\n\n\n=== Relative chronology ===\nUsing ten different criteria, including epigraphy, prose style, diviner names and bone preparation, Dong Zuobin assigned oracle bone inscriptions to five periods I–V corresponding to rulers.\nLater workers have subdivided some of his periods to refer to the reigns of individual kings.\nIt has also become common to assign pieces to groups of diviners, who were active at different times.\nArchaeologists have defined four layers I–IV based on studies of stratigraphy and pottery types at various locations in the Yinxu site.\nPart of Yinxu I precedes the oracle bone records, but the other three periods can be related to Dong's five inscription periods.\n\nThe dating information from periods I to IV is too limited to assign inscriptions to a particular year of a king's reign.\nIn contrast, the standardized ritual schedule and recording of cycle counts in period V permits estimates of the lengths of the last two reigns, though these have ranged between 20 and 33 years.\n\n\n=== Absolute chronology ===\n\nThe earliest securely dated event in Chinese history is the start of the Gonghe Regency in 841 BC, early in the Zhou dynasty, a date first established by the Han dynasty historian Sima Qian. Attempts to establish earlier dates have been plagued by doubts about the origin and transmission of traditional texts and the difficulties in their interpretation. More recent attempts, including by the Xia–Shang–Zhou Chronology Project have compared the traditional histories with archaeological and astronomical data.\nAt least 44 dates for the Zhou conquest of the Shang have been proposed, ranging from 1130 BC to 1018 BC.\nMost recent authors propose dates between 1050 and 1040 BC.\nDavid Pankenier, by attempting to identify astronomical events mentioned in Zhou texts, dated the conquest at 1046 BC.\nThe XSZ Project arrived at the same date, based on a combination of the astronomical evidence considered by Pankenier and radiocarbon dating of archaeological layers at Yinxu and proto-Zhou sites.\nUsing this date and counting year-long ritual cycles in the last two reigns, the XSZ project assigned accession dates to the last two Shang kings of 1101 BC and 1075 BC.\nOracle bones from the Bīn diviner group (late in Wu Ding's reign and early in that of his successor Zu Geng) mention five lunar eclipses, including the following:\n\n七日己未斲庚申月又食On the seventh day jǐwèi (day 56) cleaving into gēngshēn (day 57), the moon was eaten.\nMost scholars identify this eclipse with one that astronomers have calculated to have occurred on the evening of 27 December 1192 BC.\nSome of the identifications vary, but most scholars identify these five records with eclipses spanning the period from 1201 to 1180 BC.\nThis interval implies an approximate end date for Wu Ding's reign.\nEstimating an average reign length of about 20 years (based on securely dated Zhou rulers), Keightley proposed a start date around 1200 BC or earlier.\nUsing the statement in the \"Against Luxurious Ease\" chapter of the Book of Documents that his reign lasted 59 years, the XSZ Project estimated its start date at 1250 BC.\nKen-ichi Takashima dates the earliest oracle bone inscriptions to around 1230 BC.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe oracle bones describe the Shang world in terms of three concentric regions.\nAt the centre was the capital and ritual centre Dàyì Shāng (大邑商 'Great Settlement Shang').\nShang control or influence extended to four tǔ (土 'lands') named after the cardinal directions.\nMany divinations were concerned with harvests or weather in named tǔ, or smaller areas within them.\nThe extent of Shang control, based on shifting alliances and fluctuating military power, is difficult to delineate, and probably varied over time.\nThe term fāng (方 'sides, regions') was used in a metaphysical sense, to refer to the four directions and associated supernatural powers.\nIt was also used for specific neighbouring groups that might be subordinate polities, allies or enemies, in some cases changing their status over time.\nAt least 40 different fāng are mentioned in inscriptions.\nShima Kunio attempted to map their positions based on travel time between divinations.\n\n\n=== North China Plain ===\n\nThe core area of the Late Shang state lay in the eastern foothills of the Taihang Mountains, stretching from around 200 km (120 mi) north of Anyang to a similar distance to the south.\nIn the immediate surroundings of the capital, the Huan River valley experienced a substantial increase in population and growth of regional centres during the Huanbei and Late Shang periods.\nMany Shang sites have been found in the areas of Hebei the north, especially around the modern city of Shijiazhuang.\nTaixi (in Gaocheng) seems to have been a strategic outpost near the northern frontier.\nIn its Upper phase, the Erligang culture had expanded into Shandong, displacing the Yueshi culture.\nThis expansion continued during the Late Shang period, confining the indigenous Zhenzhumen culture to the eastern part of the Jiaodong peninsula.\nA large concentration of settlements occurred along the Ji River and the adjacent shores of the Bohai, which were centres of salt production and harvesting of pearls and shells, as well as mining of copper and lead.\nAnother concentration occurred to the west of the Taishan massif, in the valley of the Si River.\nThese areas also feature aristocratic graves, some of them ramped tombs with human sacrifices like elite tombs at Xibeigang.\nThe site at Subutun features a four-ramped tomb, the only one found outside Anyang, where they were reserved for royal burials.\nThis is interpreted by some archaeologists as indicating a local rival, while others believe the occupant was a favourite of a Shang king.\nAnother cluster of sites is found in western Shandong and eastern Henan around the Anqiu site, which had been inhabited since the Longshan period.\nThe cemetery at Tianhu, north of the Dabie Mountains, is one of the southernmost sites with Late Shang features.\nThe site also shares features with the many distinct local cultures surrounding it, and may be the lineage cemetery of a local Shang lord.\n\n\n=== Western highlands ===\n\nOf the polities located by Shima Kunio, the most frequently mentioned are to the northwest of Anyang, in the upper Fen River valley and the east bank of the Yellow River to the west.\nThe Qiāng 羌, who are often captured and sacrificed in Shang rituals, are believed to have lived in this area.\nIn Wu Ding's time, the Zhou, possibly at that time residing in the Fen valley, were mentioned as an ally, but in later inscriptions are referred to as Zhōufāng 周方, indicating that they had become more independent or even hostile.\nSeveral other northwestern allies are mentioned in the Wu Ding period, but disappear from the record in later reigns.\n\nExcavations from the northwestern zone present a mix of cultures.\nThe Jingjie site in the Fen River valley consists of three elite burials with a mix of Shang and Northern Zone artifacts.\nMany of the bronzes bear an emblem that has been interpreted as Bǐng 丙, a name mentioned as an ally in oracle bones from the reign of Wu Ding.\nThe Qiaobei site further down the Fen river also appears to have been allied to the Shang.\nThe Lijiaya culture on the north-south stretch of the Yellow River shows a mix of Shang and Northern Zone features.\nPeople of the nearby Ordos Plateau and adjacent areas of the Loess Plateau in western Shanxi had exploited horses since Paleolithic times.\nThis area may have been the source of Shang horses and chariots, perhaps as tribute gifts.\nThe name Mǎfāng (馬方 'horse fang') mentioned in the oracle bones may have referred to a polity in this area.\nLaoniupo in the Wei valley dominated the route from the Wei valley to the Dan River, which flows into the Han River to the south.\nThe nearby Qinling mountains held extensive copper deposits.\nThe site had been an outpost of the Erligang state, and became a powerful state during the Late Shang period, with close connections to Yinxu.\nDuring Yinxu Phase IV, Laoniupo possessed the only known bronze foundry outside of Yinxu producing Shang-style vessels.\nThe site features elite burials similar to those at Yinxu, with many human sacrifices.\nHowever, its pottery and other burials show local styles.\nLaoniupo seems to have become more independent of the Shang core over time, but then declined suddenly, possibly due to the rise of the Zhou, at this time residing further west in the Wei valley, who went on to conquer the Shang.\n\n\n== Warfare ==\n\nBeyond their central domains, Shang kings maintained their networks of subordinates and allies through a series of military campaigns.\nCampaigns and raids also supplied captives to be sacrificed in Shang rituals.\nThe bronze foundries at the capital produced a variety of chariot fittings and weapons. The Shang dagger-axe was designed for hand-to-hand fighting on foot.\nSome 980 bronze arrowheads have been found, compared with 20,400 fashioned from bone.\nThe Shang bow had a range of 60 to 70 m (200 to 230 ft).\nSome weapons were based on imported designs, such as the máo spearhead, which first appeared at Yinxu in period II and appears to have been developed in the Yangtze region, while daggers with animal-head pommels and some dagger-axes have precursors in Northern zone cultures.\n\n\n=== Mobilization ===\n\nAlthough the Shang probably had a small standing army, typical campaigns required levies of three or five thousand men, usually provided and led by lineage leaders.\nSeveral inscriptions mention troops raised and led by Wu Ding's consort Fu Hao.\nThe most common number of troops was 3,000, who would be organized into right, centre and left units:\n\n丁酉貞: 王作三師右中左On dīngyǒu (day 34) divined: the king will form three armies, right, centre and left.\nEach body of 1,000 footsoldiers would typically be accompanied by 100 archers and 100 chariots.\nEach chariot carried a driver, an archer and a spearman, all presumably specially trained and drawn from the petty elite class.\nThe king might lead the army in person, or send one of his generals.\nSometimes the Shang would attack together with allies.\nDivinatory inscriptions concerning planned military campaigns use the verb 'order' (令 líng) for local leaders under the direct control of the king and a different verb 'join with' or '(cause to) follow' for more distant allies.\n\n\n=== Military history ===\nInscriptions from the reign of Wu Ding speak of successful major campaigns against the Tǔfāng 土方 and Gōngfāng 工方 west of the Taihang Mountains.\nAllied states are often mentioned in inscriptions from the Wu Ding period, but not those of later reigns.\nUnder Wu Ding's successor Zu Geng, less successful campaigns against the Shàofāng 召方 and Gōngfāng led to a loss of influence in the west.\nLimited strikes into enemy territory, often against the Qiāng 羌, are noted in periods III and IV.\nBy period V (the last two kings), the Shang had established stable control over a smaller area, and no inscriptions refer to outside attacks, or to the loss of troops.\nIncriptions of this period also contain fewer references to allied groups.\nRoyal forays were more limited, with the exception of Di Xin's campaign against the Rénfāng 人方 in the Huai River valley to the southeast, which may have lasted at least seven months.\n\n\n== Religion ==\n\nThe main source of information about Shang religious belief and practice is the oracle bones, supplemented by archaeological finds of ritual vessels and sacrifices.\nBy its nature, this evidence focusses on the concerns of the royal lineage and other elites.\n\n\n=== Powers ===\nThe head of the Shang pantheon was Dì 帝, the High God, who commanded the weather and various successes or disasters that might befall the Shang.\nMany divinations describe seeking Di's approval of or assistance with some endeavour.\nThere are numerous theories regarding the origin of Dì, including an early ancestor, the north celestial pole, or as a generic term for the other powers.\nThe Shang also sought the approval of nature powers such as the Earth Power Tǔ 土, the River Power Hé 河 (the Yellow River) and the Mountain Power Yuè 岳.\nSome scholars identify the latter with Mount Song, 220 km (140 mi) to the south of Anyang.\nAnother group, called the \"High Ancestors\" in the inscriptions and the \"Former Lords\" in modern scholarship, includes figures such as Kuí 夔 (or Náo 夒) and Wáng-hài 王亥, a name that occurs in some texts from the Warring States period. Modern scholars have attempted to identify these with pre-dynastic figures in traditional histories.\nAnother of these figures is Yi Yin, who is named in the traditional histories as a minister of the first Shang king.\nThe ancestors of the king were central to Shang ritual, as a source of power uniquely related to him, and as a reminder of the many generations of kings that had culminated in his rule.\nPerforming the proper sacrifices to each ancestor was a key obligation, and the ancestors were viewed as having influence with Dì and the nature powers.\nThe pre-dynastic ancestors were viewed as the most powerful, able to affect weather and crops.\nAll of them were able to affect the king and those around him.\nParticular significance was attached to kings on the main line of descent to the current king.\nRoyal women were also venerated, particularly consorts of main-line kings and mothers of kings.\nMost divinations regarding Dì date from the reign of Wu Ding, after which the ancestors play a greater role.\nBy period V, Dì and the nature powers are hardly mentioned at all.\nOver the same period, worship of the main-line ancestors became more systematized.\n\n\n=== Ritual ===\n\nThe ritual centre was a complex of temples and palaces on a hill flanked to the north and south by the Huan River.\nArchaeologists have mapped the rammed-earth foundations of these buildings, but the density and poor preservation of the foundations makes it difficult to produce a definitive layout.\nIt appears that construction and refurbishment continued throughout the Late Shang period.\nThe general consensus is that the northern part of the complex consisted of royal residences, the central part was the main locus of ritual sacrifice, and the southern part consisted of smaller ritual buildings.\nInscriptions refer to temples (zōng 宗) of particular ancestors.\nThe glyph used suggests a temple housing a spirit tablet or the altar stand on which it was placed, though no archaeological remains of such tablets have been uncontroversially identified.\nInscriptions also mention architectural terms such as táng (堂 'elevated hall'), tíng (庭 'courtyard') and mén (門 'gate').\nMany divinations look forward to the coming day, suggesting that Shang ceremonies were performed at sunrise.\nUsually, the king hosted and offered sacrifices to one of his ancestors or ancestresses on each day, moving through them in sequence.\nHowever, when the king was away from the capital, he never divined about sacrifices to ancestors, suggesting that they were thought to remain at the ritual centre.\nSacrificial offerings involved millet ale, grain, and large numbers of animal and human victims.\nOne divination refers to sacrificing 1000 cattle in one ceremony, and several others refer to rituals involving hundreds of animals.\nThe oracle bones refer to at least 14,197 human sacrificial victims, including 7,426 Qiang.\nThe number killed at a time varied from 3 to 300, but was most commonly between 5 and 10.\nIn the temple-palace district, archaeologists have discovered pits containing the skeletons of these victims, many decapitated and otherwise mutilated.\n\nThe kings consulted their ancestors and other powers using pyromantic divination, sometimes asking binary questions, but more often seeking approval for a proposed course of action.\nThis involved carefully-prepared animal bones, usually the scapulae of oxen or turtle plastons, both of which provided convenient flat surfaces.\nWorkers also drilled lines of hollows in the back of each piece.\nDuring divination, hot pokers were applied to these hollows, causing cracks in the front surface, which were interpreted as a response.\nThere is no consensus on how cracks were read.\nThe used pieces were then given to scribes, who recorded the charge and the interpretation of the cracks.\nIn some cases, the scribes also later recorded the outcome of the matter divined about.\nFor example,\n\n甲申卜殼貞婦好娩嘉王占曰其惟丁娩嘉其惟庚娩引吉三旬又一日甲寅娩不嘉惟女Crack-making on jiǎshēn (day 21), Que divined: Fu Hao's delivery will be good. The king interpreted: if a dīng day birth, it will be good, if a gēng day, it will be extremely auspicious. On the 31st day, jiǎyín (day 51), she gave birth. It was unlucky, a girl.\nBased on an interpretation of certain characters in the oracle bone script, Kwang-chih Chang proposed that Shang kings interceded with the spirit world as shamans.\nHowever, the carefully ordered nature of Shang ritual seems inconsistent with the states of trance or ecstacy that normally characterize shamanism.\n\n\n=== Burials ===\n\nAcross the Huan River lies the Xibeigang cemetery, with eight large tombs each consisting of a square shaft some 12 m (39 ft) deep approached by four ramps dug into the earth and approximately aligned with the cardinal directions.\nThese eight tombs, together with an unfinished shaft in their midst, match the nine kings of the Late Shang state, and are generally considered royal tombs.\nSmaller tombs, two with single ramps (from the south) and three with two ramps (north and south) each, are thought to hold elites of lower status.\nThe only other four-ramp tomb of the period, found at Subutun, is variously interpreted as belonging to a favourite of the Shang king or a rival.\nAnyang tombs differ from those of Erlitou and Erligang in the introduction of ramps, more elaborate structures, an increase in the number of grave goods, and a greater contrast between the largest tombs and the rest.\nThe effort invested in their tombs shows that the Shang believed that their deceased rulers needed to be provided for in the afterlife, from where they could exert influence over the living.\nThe body of the king was placed in a supine position, oriented north-south, within a wooden chamber constructed at the bottom of the central shaft.\nRammed-earth ledges surrounding this chamber held the king's attendants who had followed him in death, equipped with weapons or vessels with which to serve the king and often accompanied by dogs.\nThe excavated areas were filled with earth and 100 or more beheaded sacrificial victims, mostly young men, buried in a prone position.\n\nThe royal tombs have long been looted, but a hint of the treasures they once contained is given by the much smaller tomb of Fu Hao, which was discovered intact just southwest of the temple-palace zone. This medium-sized tomb, with 16 human victims and a dog, also contained 1,600 kg (3,500 lb) of bronze, 755 jades, 110 pieces of worked stone, 564 objects of carved bone, two ivory cups inlaid with turquoise, 6,880 cowrie shells and 11 pots. The lower part of the tomb had been damaged by water, so little remained of the occupant and the nested lacquered coffins that excavators believe encased the body.\nTombs in the West Zone of the Yinxu site are believed to have belonged to petty elite lineages.\nThey mirror the pits and ledges of the royal tombs, but at much smaller scale.\nThe grave goods include a few bronze vessels, but more commonly ceramics including ceramic wine-pouring vessels corresponding to the bronze vessels of elite tombs.\nMany of them were buried with weapons, possibly indicating warriors.\nTen graves had a ramp and surrounding graves, which are interpreted as attendants who followed a minor lord in death.\nSmaller graves with modest goods are found adjacent to lineage settlements across the Yinxu site.\nAway from the capital, non-elite burials rarely featured grave goods.\n\n\n== Society ==\n\nDivination inscriptions refer to various patrilineal lineages (zú 族) or lineage groups, some of which also appear on contemporaneous bronze vessels.\nShang society was organized as a socially differentiated hierarchy of such lineage groups, all ultimately bound to the king in various ways.\n\n\n=== Elites ===\nThe kingly lineage, centred on the king (wáng 王), occupied the political and ritual pinnacle of Shang society.\nSome sons also formed their own princely (zi 子) lineages.\nA cache of oracle bones found at the Huayuanzhang East site, southeast of the palace-temple area, contains divinations performed on behalf of one of these princes during the reign of Wu Ding.\nOther lineages were more distantly related to the king, forming an extended royal lineage group at the core of the Shang state.\nThe term fù (婦 'lady') is not completely understood, but is generally thought to denote women of high status, including the king's consorts and those of his sons.\nDeceased ancestresses received sacrifices under names consisting of Bǐ (妣 'ancestress') and a day name, e.g. Fu Hao was referred to by the posthumous name Bǐ Xīn 妣辛.\nThe inscriptions mention various titles, for which several interpretations have been proposed.\nThe titles hóu 侯, diàn 甸 and (less commonly) bó 伯 were often appended to place names, suggesting local lords affiliated with the Shang.\nThe inscription on the Western Zhou Da Yu ding, dated 58 years after the fall of the Shang, speaks of hóu 侯 and diàn 甸 lords on the periphery of the Shang domain.\n\n\n=== Officers ===\nDivination inscriptions recording numbers of men mobilized, enemies killed or captured, booty taken, animals killed in hunts and quantities of sacrifices must have been supported by a system of record keeping. The organization of armies, the supply of ores and management of bronze-casting imply some level of hierarchical control.\nThe inscriptions mention various kinds of officers in particular roles such as the 'many horses' (Duō Mǎ 多馬), 'many dogs' (Duō Quǎn 多犬), 'many archers' (Duō Shè 多射), 'many artisans' (Duō Gōng 多工) or 'many officers' (Duō Yà 多亞).\nThere were also 'junior servitors' (Xiǎo Chén 小臣) responsible for such things as mobilizing workers or cultivation.\nHowever, the Shang government was not yet a bureaucratic structure with clearly-differentiated roles and relationships.\nMost officials of the Shang state were relatives of the king, by blood or by marriage.\n\n\n=== Common people ===\nMany inscriptions refer to mobilizing the population for warfare, opening new land to agriculture and various other tasks.\nThe terms used, rén (人 'people'), zhòng (眾 'multitude') or the combination zhòngrén (人眾), have been much debated, and there is no consensus on whether or how these terms were distinguished by the Shang.\nScholars such as Guo Moruo and Chen Mengjia proposed that the Shang represented the \"slave society\" phase prescribed by Marxian historical materialism.\nThey interpreted such terms as chén (臣 'servitor'), pú (僕 'servant, follower, groom') and yǔ (圉 'prisoners', mostly in period I inscriptions) as denoting slaves.\nHowever, there is no mention of people being bought or sold, and no indication that the large numbers of prisoners sacrificed had been used as slave labour.\n\n\n== Climate and agriculture ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nMore than 7% of bone inscriptions were concerned with the weather, with many mentions of winds, rain and thunderstorms.\nSummers in modern Anyang feature torrential bursts of rainfall, especially in July, triggered when the East Asian Monsoon collides with cold air from the Loess Plateau on the eastern slopes of the Taihang Mountains.\nFrom late April to early June the region is buffeted by unpredictable and occasionally damaging winds.\nDuring the Late Shang period, summers in the Anyang area were only about 1 °C (1.8 °F) warmer than at present, and might be expected to have had similar weather.\nIn contrast, Late Shang winters were 4–5 °C (7–9 °F) warmer than at present, and thus milder and wetter than in modern times.\nThis is confirmed by several inscriptions referring to rain and even thunderstorms in the winter months.\nIt is likely that the growing season was longer in Late Shang times, beginning as early as January or February.\nDivinations relating to planting are recorded between late December and mid-February, and a few dated appeals to the powers for rain (crucial for newly planted and sprouting crops) occur early in the year.\nThe Yellow River plain to the east and south of Anyang may have received even more rain than the area of the capital.\n\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n\nThe staple crop was millet, which had been widely cultivated in northern China since Neolithic times.\nThe main varieties were foxtail millet and broomcorn millet.\nThe planting, care and harvesting of the crop was a major concern in divinations.\nMillet was also fermented to make a drink usually described as \"wine\", but technically an ale.\nHemp was grown and woven for textiles.\nThe Shang also cultivated mulberries and practised sericulture.\nAt that time, most of northern China was covered with deciduous broadleaf forests, in which large animals such as elephants, rhinoceros and tigers roamed.\nInscriptions refer to organizing labour to clear lands for farming.\nKings often combined their frequent hunts with surveying and clearing new lands to be opened.\nThe connection is reflected in the extension of the noun tián 田 'field' to a verb 'hunt' (take to the field) in inscriptions from period III.\nMost farming tools were made of wood or stone, including wooden ploughs, shovels of stone, shell or bone, and sickles of shell or stone.\nA small number of bronze tools have been found, with picks more common than axes.\nBoth animal and human waste were used to fertilize the fields.\nAlthough the Shang built a system of drainage ditches around the ritual centre at Xiaotun, there is no evidence of large-scale use of irrigation for agriculture.\nThe inscriptions focus of sufficient rainfall for the crops, while also expressing a fear of flooding.\nThe Shang kept cattle, sheep, pigs, dogs and horses. Many inscriptions describe sacrifices of large numbers of cattle, sheep, pigs and dogs, which were presumably consumed in ritual feasts by the Shang elite.\nHorses were used to draw chariots for royal hunts and as command vehicles on military expeditions.\nMany royal burials at Anyang feature sacrificial horses, often together with chariots.\n\n\n== Workshops ==\n\nAs well as a political and ritual centre, Yinxu was also a centre of craft production.\nArtisans were clustered in highly specialized production zones in different parts of the site.\nTheir lodgings appear to have been of better quality than those of the common people, suggesting a higher status.\nSome workshops, particularly those producing bronze or worked jade, appear to have been under direct royal control.\n\n\n=== Bronze ===\n\nThe best-known craft of the Shang was the production of bronze objects.\nBronze and the piece-mould process were used from the Erlitou culture, and continued with increasing sophistication and volume of production up to the Late Shang period.\nThe main items produced were ritual vessels, weapons, tools and chariot fittings.\n\nMany types of ritual vessel were produced, the most common being the gū wine goblet and the jué pouring vessel, which were often found paired.\nNext most numerous were various kinds of dǐng cauldron.\nThese vessels were decorated with intricate motifs, requiring extensive labour from a variety of highly skilled artisans.\nTowards the end of the peiod (Yinxu IV), artisans tended to focus on a smaller number of vessel types and decorative styles.\nVessels produced at Yinxu have been found in elite burials within Yinxu and also across the North China Plain and the adjacent regions to the west.\nMany of these vessels bear brief inscriptions, often just clan insignia.\nLonger inscriptions tend to come from the Yinxu IV period.\n\nA wide variety of bronze weapons were produced by the Yinxu foundries, many of whose designs were influenced by Yangtze cultures or northern cultures.\nElaborately decorated weapons often signified status within Shang society.\nSome graves featured axes that were too heavy for use in combat and probably awarded as a mark of military command.\nA small proportion of bronze implements were tools, usually lacking decoration and used for woodworking rather than farming.\nThe foundries also produced various fittings for the chariots used by the elite for hunting and as military command vehicles.\nHandheld bronze bells, 7–21 cm (2.8–8.3 in) in height, have also been found, sometimes in sets of three with matching decoration but random pitch relationship.\nSix bronze foundries have been found at Yinxu, though they may not all have been operating at the same time.\nOne of these, located 700 m (2,300 ft) south of the temple-palace complex, operated throughout the period.\nThe largest centre of bronze production consisted of two foundries 200 m (660 ft) apart in the West Zone of the Yinxu site, which operated in the second half of the period.\nThe volume of bronze production under the Late Shang was many times greater that at Zhengzhou and without parallel elsewhere in the ancient world.\nFor example, the mid-sized tomb of Fu Hao contained 1,625 kg (3,583 lb) of bronze objects, and it seems likely that the looted royal tombs originally contained many times as much bronze, exemplified by isolated finds such as the 875 kg (1,929 lb) Houmuwu Ding.\nThe sheer volume of production implies considerable mobilization of labour and specialization.\nThe huge amount of metals required were obtained from other regions, especially the middle Yangtze, with some from distant northeastern Yunnan.\n\n\n=== Ceramics ===\n\nLarge amounts of grey-ware pottery, produced from local clays, were used for a variety of purposes at all levels of society.\nVessel designs and decoration were directly descended from Erlitou and Erligang pottery, with some elements traceable back to the Henan Longshan culture.\nThese vessels were produced across the North China Plain and regions to the west, with variations in each area.\nThe most common type was the lì, a tripod cooking pot.\nShang workshops also produced much smaller amounts of luxury white pottery, richly decorated with motifs similar to those found on bronze and other artifacts.\nThin stoneware vessels, some glazed, have been found around Anyang, but were probably traded from the middle Yangtze region, where over 30 kilns producing such wares have been found.\nThe pottery workshops also produced the moulds and crucibles used for casting bronze.\n\n\n=== Bone and ivory ===\n\nChinese use of worked bone objects peaked in the Late Shang period.\nExtensive bone working took place both in households and in large specialized workshops.\nOne workshop, in the eastern part of the settlement, has been systematically excavated, with a single trench on the site yielding 34 t (37 short tons) of worked and unworked bones.\nThe most common products were decorative pins, awls and arrowheads.\nMore than 20 times more arrowheads of bone have been found than those of bronze.\nOther items include flat plates, tubes, ocarinas and handles.\nMany elite tombs feature fine objects carved from the ivory of elephants and boars.\n\n\n=== Stone working ===\n\nVarious kinds of stone were available from the foothills of the Taihang Mountains just to the west of Anyang.\nThe most common stone products were knives and sickles.\nA workshop excavated in Xiaotun yielded thousands of slate sickles, some unfinished, suggesting mass production organized by the state.\nStone axes and shovels were also common.\nMany workshops produced finely-carved decorative and ritual objects of marble and jade.\nA small workshop within the temple-palace complex produced a variety of sculpted jade objects.\nSculptures featured human figures and both real and mythical animals.\nAll known examples of marble sculpture were found in royal tombs.\nMany jade objects were found in the tomb of Fu Hao.\nDecorated limestone sounding stones have been recovered from several tombs.\n\n\n== Relation to traditional accounts ==\nThe traditional account of the Shang dynasty is given by the \"Basic Annals of Yin\", chapter 3 of the Historical Records compiled by the Han dynasty historian Sima Qian.\nThis chapter has the form of a list of pre-dynastic ancestors and kings, extended with didactic anecdotes about some kings drawn from the Classic of Poetry, the Book of Documents and other sources.\nSome elements of these anecdotes are clearly mythical.\nOn the other hand, Sima Qian's king list largely matches that reconstructed from the ritual schedule, especially for later kings, though there are significant differences.\nSima Qian records several re-locations of the Shang capital, culminating in a return to the original Shang capital south of the Yellow River by Wu Ding's uncle Pan Geng, followed by a move back north of the river by Wu Yi (or the preceding king Geng Ding according to chapter 13).\nSima Qian's account, like other early chapters of the Records, is coloured with the values, concepts and governmental structures of the Han period.\nSima Qian's account places the Shang in a history conceived as a succession of ruling dynasties, but archaeological discoveries have revealed a much more complex picture, with other regional powers such Sanxingdui and the Wucheng culture.\nSima Qian and authors of the Warring States period seem unaware of the human sacrifice that was central to Shang ritual and is amply attested in archaeological finds. Western Zhou authors reproach the last Shang kings for drunkenness and licentiousness, but do not mention human sacrifice.\nIn contrast, the concept of royal virtue is absent from Shang inscriptions.\nAnother account of the Shang dynasty is found in chapter 4 of the Bamboo Annals. Both accounts call the state and its capital Yīn (殷) rather than Shāng (商). The theory that the dynasty was called Shāng up to Pan Geng's relocation of the capital and Yīn afterwards first appeared in the Diwang shiji by Huangfu Mi (3rd century AD). They also feature later usages not found in the oracle bones, such as calling the rulers 'emperor' (dì 帝) rather than 'king' (wáng 王), and using nián (年) for 'year' rather than sì (祀).\nNeither account uses the date forms found on the oracle bones.\nThey also do not mention the royal consorts, who feature prominently in the rituals recorded on the oracle bones.\nBoth accounts describe a preceding Xia dynasty, which is not mentioned in Shang inscriptions.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Works cited ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==",

He was appointed by the government in lieu of a kgosi after the abdication of Neale Sechele.\nBonewamang Padi Sechele was born in 1926 to Padi, who died in 1929. Bonewamang was the grandson of kgosi Sechele II of the Kwena tribe. Bonewamang attended the Tiger Kloof Educational Institute, but he did not do well academically. He was underage after his uncle kgosi Sebele II was deposed without an heir in 1931, so he was not considered as a possible successor and Kgari Sechele II became kgosi. When Kgari floated the idea of retirement, he named Bonewamang as his preferred successor. Bonewamang served 15.5 months in prison after he was convicted of theft by conversion in 1957, and he was charged with the crime again in 1962.\nBonewamang was a headman in Letlhakeng. Upon the death of Kgari, Bonewamang was considered one of two possible successors, alongside Sebele's son Moruakgomo. Bonewamang's supporters argued that Moruakgamo was ineligible because his parents had not completed certain marriage rites, and many opposed Moruakgomo because his mother was Coloured. Bonewamang's opponents argued that an heir could not be chosen from someone senior of the previous kgosi, although this had occurred before. The issue went to the court, and it was decided that Neale Sechele would be appointed kgosi as a compromise.\nBonewamang was appointed as the district's African Tribal Authority after Neale was pressured into abdicating in 1970. The following February, Bonewamang was accused of stock theft and the district commissioner negotiated to prevent his prosecution. Bonewamang died in a car accident in 1978. His underage son Kgari Sechele III succeeded him as kgosi, and Mack Sechele became regent as the African Tribal Authority.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nMbuya, Titus (1999). \"Legitimacy and Succession in Tswana States: The Case of BaKwena, 1930-1963\".

        "content": "Ukrainians in Hong Kong refer to people of Ukrainian nationality or with Ukrainian citizenship who live temporarily or permanently in Hong Kong. To unite the community and preserve the cultural heritage, an appropriate organization was created, which interacts with the consular corps of Ukraine in China. There is currently no Ukrainian embassy in Hong Kong, the closest consulate of Ukraine is in Guangzhou.\n\n\n== History ==\nFor a long time, there was no proof that a significant number of Ukrainians have lived in Hong Kong. However, after the destruction of the Ukrainian community in Manchuria by the Red Army, a number of them fled and settled in Hong Kong as a temporary refuge before furtherly moving to the countries of Latin America or Australia.\nThe growth of interest and interest in Hong Kong appeared after Ukraine gained independence, as well as following the handover of Hong Kong in 1997 to the People's Republic of China. In the late 1990s, travelers, travelers, and the first Ukrainian businessmen stayed there. However, the emergence of the Ukrainian community as such dates back to the early 2000s.\nThere are currently around 100 to 200 Ukrainians living in Hong Kong. It is difficult to count the exact number of them since many are temporarily working or studying in Hong Kong.\nMost Ukrainians in Hong Kong are from Crimea, Kyiv, Dnipro, Kharkiv, and Vinnytsia, from Western and Eastern Ukraine, and are part of the diasporas of Australia and Canada.\nUkrainians in Hong Kong work as IT specialists, artists, singers, models, lawyers, accountants, pilots and other airline employees, scientists, doctors, beauty salon workers, diving trainers, and private entrepreneurs. There are two Ukrainian restaurants in Hong Kong, the more famous of which is Ivan The Kozak in Central which opened in 2001. The restaurant gained more popularity since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. In 2024, local television ViuTV interviewed the owner of Ivan The Kozak, Victoria in a New Year program, sharing the fusion of both Ukrainian and Hong Kong cuisine and her story especially after the start of the full-scale invasion of her country by Russia.\n\n\n== Organisations ==\nFor a considerable period in Hong Kong, there were separate initiative groups that were not united in a society or association. The events of Euromaidan, the Revolution of Dignity, and the onslaught of the Russo-Ukrainian War beginning with the Russian annexation of Crimea and the war in Donbas raised self-awareness and created one organization. In 2014, the Ukrainian Society of Hong Kong was created and officially registered. Its members are about 100 people. The most proactive members are Kateryna Kardash and Oksana Smoliichuk.\nThe society organises joint celebrations of state and religious Ukrainian holidays. In addition, cultural events, literary readings, and screenings of Ukrainian films are regularly organised. The Ukrainian Film Nights project — a monthly screening of Ukrainian films in Hong Kong has been launched. This film event is aimed at popularising Ukrainian culture, identities, history, and Ukraine in general in Hong Kong.\nUkrainians in Hong Kong joined worldwide demonstrations against the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Cooperation has been established with volunteer organizations in Ukraine that help ATO soldiers, by collecting necessary items for them.\nThe Ukrainian Society of Hong Kong community was created on Facebook to inform about the donation back to Ukraine, which was joined by Ukrainians from Macau, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen.\n\n\n== See also ==\nUkrainians in China\nUkrainians in Manchuria\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nУкраїнці Гонконгу: як живуть, ким працюють і чому не повертаються\nЯк українці Гонконгу святкували Різдво\nThe Ukrainian Society of Hong Kong\nВідкрити Україну для Гонконгу: кіноініціатива українських активістів\nЖиття Гонконгу: українська громада допомагає талановитим школярам\nУкраїнська діаспора Гонконгу передала бійцям АТО 1 тис. комплектів термобілизни",

        "content": "Zuvintas Biosphere Reserve (Lithuanian: Žuvinto biosferos rezervatas) is a strict nature reserve located in the southeast of Lithuania, about 30 km east of Alytus. Its nature protection status dates back to 1937, it is the oldest nature protection area in Lithuania.\n“Zuvintas Visitor Center” requires tickets that cost 2 euros each (2024). However, the trails and the entire area is free of charge of everyone.\n\n\n== Nature ==\nŽuvintas Biosphere Reserve is inhabited by more than 4,200 species of animals, plants, fungi and insects, 137 of which are endangered or protected species.\nAround 2000 species are various insects.\nIn 2023, the combined bird population in this nature reserve totalled nearly 40 thousand.\nThe area covers almost 20 000 hectares of wetlands, lakes, mires, peatbogs, and pine tree stands. There are three big lakes in the area – Žuvintas, Žaltytis, and Amalvas.\nThe area lies in an intensive farming region with productive agricultural soil. It is populated, but sparsely, accommodating around 11 thousand people. Less than 10% (about one thousand) live within the buffer zone.\n\n\n== Protection history ==\nZuvintas Biosphere Reserve consists of strict nature reserves (IUCN category I), nature reserves (IUCN category IV) and is inscribed in national law under a specific protection category.\n\nIn 1937, this nature reserve became the first nature protection area in Lithuania, on the initiative of zoologist Tadas Ivanauskas.\nIn 1940, Soviet Union occupied Lithuania and removed protection status for the area. During Soviet occupation of Lithuania, this was a popular bird and mammal hunting spot for Soviet nomenklatura.\nIn 1993, Zuvintas Biosphere Reserve became a Ramsar site. Ramsar identifies wetlands of international importance.\nIn 2002, national legislation made it a designated biosphere reserve, the first of its kind in Lithuania.\nIn 2004, this biosphere reserve was included in the Natura 2000.\nSince 2004, Žuvintas Biosphere Reserve has the status of Important Bird Area (IBA) and Site of Community Importance (SAC).\nIn 2011, UNESCO added Zuvintas Biosphere Reserve to the Man and the Biosphere Programme.\n\n\n== In society ==\nIn 2013, Zuvintas Biosphere Reserve was featured on Lithuanian postal stamps.\nIn 2021, Lithuania's central bank released a commemorative euro coin dedicated to Zuvintas Biosphere Reserve. Half a million such coins were issued.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nIn 2016, Irish RTÉ Radio 1 won Rose D'Or for The Dawn Chorus programme, featuring bird song from Zuvintas Biosphere Reserve.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website \n\n\n== See also ==\nList of national parks of Lithuania\nList of protected areas of Lithuania\nBiosphere reserve",

        "content": "Erica Fontes (born 14 May 1991 in Lisbon), is a Portuguese pornographic actress. In 2013, aged just 21, Erica Fontes became the first and only Portuguese woman to win an XBIZ Award in the Foreign Female Performer of the Year category. She speaks Portuguese, in its European and Brazilian variants, English and Castilian. The fictitious surname Fontes was chosen by her and her partner Ângelo Ferro, porno actor and footballer, when on their way to their first porno film shoot, filmed in a dental clinic in Benfica, Lisbon. \nIn her book \"De corpo e alma : dos filmes à vida real. As confissões da estrela de filmes para adultos que conquistou o mundo\" (\"De Corpo e Alma. From films to real life. The confessions of the adult film star who conquered the world\") (Alfragide, Edições Asa, 2013), she confided that \"even today I always feel a sense of relief when the scene is over\". According to historian António Araújo, the relief felt by Erica at the end of each scene ends up corroborating, at least in part, the chilling passages that the famous and gigantic Meese Report, with more than 1,960 pages, devoted to characterising performers of explicit sexual content: broken family backgrounds, drug use, exploitation on and off the stage, etc. (Attorney General's Commission on Pornography - Final Report, July 1986).\nShe has participated in many porno films, of which the following can be highlighted: Maria's Sexual Diary, her 2009 masterpiece; the comedy Bimbi, The Sex Machine, the world's first 3D porn film; Red Sofa 1 and Red Sofa 3; Erica in the Mansion of Orgies or, finally, Tavares, the Barrel-Breaking Architect, inspired by the life of Tomás Taveira, all produced by the Hot Gold company.\nPorn actress Erica Fontes, the \"Casa dos Segredos\" reality show, the sports club Benfica and the recipe for chocolate cake were the words most searched for by the Portuguese in 2013. In that year in Portugal, Erica Fontes was the most searched celebrity, ahead of US \"socialite\" Kim Kardashian and beating Portuguese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo into third place.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The history of education in Spain is marked by political struggles and the progress of modern societies. It began in the late Middle Ages, very close to the clergy and the nobility, and during the Renaissance it passed into the domain of a thriving bourgeois class that led an incipient enlightenment in the so-called Age of Enlightenment. The Constitution of 1812 and the drive of the liberals originated the contemporary education.\n\n\n== Ancient Age ==\nThe Romanization of Hispania led to the creation of educational institutions. The sources record the foundation by Sertorius, around 80 BC, of a peculiar \"academy\" in Osca (Huesca) where the children of the local elites were educated.But it was the children that won them over the most. For the noblest of the people were gathered in Osca, an important city, and brought teachers of Greek and Roman teachings and, in fact, he used them as hostages, but in words he educated them to make them participants, when they were men, of the government and power.\nPlutarch, Parallel Lives.Archaeological remains have been preserved of the so-called \"House of Hippolytus\" at Complutum (Alcalá de Henares), dating from the 3rd and 4th centuries, a school for young people linked to the Anios family, with recreational and educational uses.\nLate Antiquity did not entail a total break with the Roman tradition, although in educational institutions the most important effect was its restriction to the Christian religious sphere, particularly the monastic one. The possible existence of a palatine school in Visigothic Toledo, which could be attended by high nobles, including some women, has been pointed out.\n\n\n== Middle Ages ==\n\nThe presence in medieval Spain of the three monotheistic religions (Jews, Christians and Muslims) also meant the existence of different educational institutions.\nFrom ancient times, the dioceses used to have schools attached to the cathedral, the cathedral schools, whose initial purpose was to teach future priests, but as they were the only centre of education, they gradually admitted secular individuals as well. In the 13th century, King Alfonso VIII of Castile elevated the Palencia school to the rank of Estudio General (1212). Probably, the King of León, Alfonso IX, founded the Estudio General de Salamanca (1218), which would be called \"University\" by Alfonso X the Wise, at such an early date (1253) that it probably implies that it would have been the first to bear that title.\nTeaching in these institutions took place in the cathedral premises and in rented buildings, but colleges were also founded to prepare for the university exams, and even earlier. In Salamanca, the first was the Colegio de Santa María de la Vega, of the Order of Canons Regular of Saint Augustine, founded in 1166 (prior to the foundation of the Estudio General) and in 1222 the Colegio de San Esteban. In 1401, Bishop Diego de Anaya founded the first Colegio Mayor, that of San Bartolomé, for poor students, endowing it with sufficient income to provide scholarships. Anaya took as his model the Royal College of Spain in Bologna, founded in 1364 by Cardinal Gil de Albornoz. Successively, other schools, both menor and mayor, were established, almost all with the same orientationː to provide education for poor and capable students.\nSubsequently, other Estudios Generales and Universities were created.\nIn these establishments, the degrees of Bachelor, Licentiate, Master (or Magister, what is now called master's degree) and Doctor were successively awarded. Their organisation was quite democratic: it was headed by the rector, who was elected for one year in elections in which the students participated, and who could also accede to the post, although it was a nominal post, something like the head of a modern state, who does not govern and is an almost decorative figure. He presided over the ceremonies, awarded the degrees... But their importance within the university was such that, in academic ceremonies, only the king could occupy a higher place on the podium. The real government of the university was exercised by the Master-scholar, who had his own police force and even a prison, since the students enjoyed a privilege that prevented the local authorities from taking action against them.\n\n\n== Modern Age ==\n\nIt covers the period between the 16th and 17th centuries, with an important inflection point at the end of the 16th century. If until then the university was a relatively meritocratic institution (as has been said, many of the mayor and mejor colleges were intended for poor students), the prestige that came with studying at certain universities, especially the major colleges, meant that these, and the university itself, were dominated by noble students. They made use of various tricks, such as the democratic system in the functioning of the Colleges or in the election of the rector and even demanded cleanliness of blood, something that only those with family records, that is, the nobles, could prove.\nSpanish education in the late 15th and early 16th centuries was influenced by humanism, which was promoted by the Catholic Monarchs. They influenced members of the court to devote themselves to the study of letters and to behave in a manner befitting their class.\n\n\n=== Humanism ===\n\n\n==== Nobility ====\n\nThe princes and infantes, together with some children from important families, studied in the royal classroom with the most renowned humanists. Numerous treatises were written for them with the aim of educating future rulers. Their preparation was based on physical education, since the princes had to be agile and leaders of armies, they trained in jumping, javelin, self-defence, use of the sword and lance, horseback riding and hunting; in the study of classical authors and history. But although they read classical authors, they were instilled with admiration and respect for saints, Christian figures and God. They were also taught manners, such as courtesy for diplomacy or proper behaviour at ceremonies. The sons of the nobles studied at the palatine school run by Peter Martyr d'Anghiera, to later study at the universities and gain access to bureaucratic and administrative positions.\nWomen gained particular attention, as the importance of their education as preservers of religion and morals was recognised, and this was reflected in the writing of various treatises. Juan Luis Vives wrote in 1523 one of the most renowned treatises: On the Instruction of Christian women (De la Instrucción de la mujer cristiana), in which religious reading acquires a relevant role in women's education.\n\n\n==== Bourgeoisie ====\n\nIn the Modern Age, the first-born sons inherited their parents' wealth, so the children who followed them had to dedicate themselves to the arts, and so they entered colleges or universities. The lower nobility, made up of the hidalgos (people with noble titles but no money), also attended them. It was a time when university education gave people the opportunity to move up the social ladder and acquire prestige, since their services and knowledge were required by kings. The most important universities were those of Salamanca, Alcalá de Henares and Valladolid. The degrees studied were theology, jurisprudence and medicine. Latin and the liberal arts were also taught, which coexisted with the medieval scholastic tradition.\nHowever, over the course of the 17th century, humanist ideas lost strength.\n\n\n==== Society ====\n\nFrom the Middle Ages in Spain, there was a concern to harness the talents of those with intelligence. In 1401, Bishop Diego de Anaya founded the Colegio Mayor de San Bartolomé in Salamanca for poor boys, providing them with a \"scholarship\" that included tuition, board and lodging. Other patrons created schools for the same purpose, including the Colegio de la Concepción de Huérfanos created by Francisco de Solís Quiñones y Montenegro, a doctor, bishop and personal secretary to Pope Paul III, himself an orphan, who was able to study thanks to the protection of a lady of the Maldonado family. Given the prestige of studying at these colleges, throughout the 17th century, they were occupied by students of higher rank, displacing their natural occupants, the poor.\nAs for the rest of the population, most of them were illiterate because their acquisition of knowledge was mainly by oral or visual transmission by the Catholic Church, through preaching, confession, spectacles and images. However, there were practices that allowed for an increase in the literacy of the Spanish population throughout the 16th century. The schools of first letters were promoted by religious orders and by municipalities, which provided the teaching of reading, writing, numbers and catechism. In the corporations, children and young people were accepted to serve the artisans in exchange for being taught reading, writing and a trade. On the other hand, there were also teachers (clerics or university students) who lived in the pupil's house.\nAlthough it is considered that in the 17th century there was a stagnation in education due to disorganisation and lack of state administration, it was the century in which teachers began to receive a salary from the town council, their work and timetable were regulated and they began to use manuals and alphabets. At the same time, a teachers' corporation was formed in which admission was controlled and the interests defended by the corporation were not always oriented towards the benefit of the students. As for the children, there was no state plan for their education, so they attended the parishes, where the priests (who were not exclusively teachers, because they also carried out other activities) taught them to read, until they were gradually displaced by the Jesuits. The economic situation of many children forced them to leave school in order to work and support the family economy, although many of them received an education and learned to read in the corporations they joined.\n\n\n==== Society of Jesus ====\n\nA religious order founded by Ignatius of Loyola in 1534. Its activities began, with no intention of teaching, as residences for young people attending university. They began to teach theology and philosophy gradually and informally, with a humanist tendency. The College of Gandía was the first of the order, from its foundation, to be a residence, to give classes and to admit external students; from then on and throughout the 16th century, colleges began to be founded for this purpose. Its theology and philosophy courses were attended by the children of wealthy families, but because the classes were free, humble young people also attended to learn to read.\n\n\n==== Piarists ====\nThe Order of the Pious Schools (Piarists), founded by Saint Joseph Calasanz (1557–1648), an Aragonese priest and educator, introduced in 17th century Catholic Europe (Italy, Austria, Poland, Slovakia...) and later in Spain, the free popular school open to all, especially the poorest. The first foundations of the Piarists were in Barbastro (1677), Benabarre (1681) and Moyá (1683). In the 18th century, 12 schools were founded in Spain. But the demand for schooling made to the Pious Schools during this 18th century was overwhelming. There are documented more than a hundred requests for the foundation of Piarist schools that were not met due to lack of Piarist personnel or because the governments of the time did not authorise them. The pedagogical style of Calasanz, who created his first school in Rome in 1597, sought the primary attention to the poorest, the efficiency, the innovation, the graduation of teaching and the synthesis between \"Piety and Letters\", his motto would be translated today as \"Culture and Faith\". After him, hundreds of male and female religious congregations appeared in the Catholic Church and in Spain, especially dedicated to education: La Salle, Marists, Salesians....\n\n\n=== Illustration ===\n\nThe arrival of the Bourbons to the crown of the Spanish Monarchy brought with it enlightened policies, but these had little effect on education throughout the 18th century. Until the government of Charles III there were no educational reforms. His policy consisted mainly of the expulsion of the Jesuits, the reform of universities and colleges and the secularisation of education. The novatores were a group of thinkers and scientists in the late 17th and early 18th centuries whose ideas influenced philosophy and science, which preceded the Enlightenment.\n\n\n==== First Letters ====\n\nWhen the 18th century realised that illiteracy was evident and detrimental to development, the state took measures to prepare teachers and schools. In 1780, the Colegio Académico del Noble Arte de Primeras Letras was created to prepare teachers. At the same time, texts, speeches and study plans were written by figures such as Pedro Rodríguez de Campomanes, José de Olavide y Jaúregui and Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos, who spoke about progress, forms of instruction, methods, teaching and education focused on students and denounced the ineffectiveness of public schools and the education system. Juan Picornell rescues a quote that highlights the importance of the State taking care of education:...if by chance the Republic is increased, it can be said that it grows in men, but not in strength. No State, then, will ever be wise, rich or powerful without education.\n\n\n==== University ====\nSpanish universities remained on the fringes of philosophical and scientific changes, which resulted in their backwardness in science studies and curricula because they were considered contrary to Catholic doctrine and their traditional, medieval scholastic method. They were considered obsolete because it was believed that their ceremonies and discussions corresponded little to Spanish reality and because of the corruption and complexity of their administration. For this reason, the crown carried out a university reform through the creation of the Plan of Studies of the University of Salamanca in 1771, which contained administrative and academic modifications. However, the reforms were not as successful as expected because the university students resisted the modification of their political and social practices. Moreover, the professors did not have the necessary preparation to comply with the new plan.\nAfter the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1767, the Reales Estudios de San Isidro de Madrid were founded, dedicated to secondary education, whose teachers would be chosen by competition instead of by the religious orders. In these, Fine Arts, Mathematics, Physics, Natural and Human Law, Greek and Hebrew were taught. The Plan of 1771, also known as the Plan of Aranda, was created to regulate university education. In primary education, an attempt was made to fill the vacuum left by the Jesuits with public schools that taught First Letters, Latin and Rhetoric. The Seminary of Nobles in Madrid (1725), the College of Medicine and Surgery in Cadiz (1748), the Naval Observatory (1753), the Royal Academy of the Three Noble Arts (1757) and the Royal College of Surgery (1760) were also founded.\n\n\n== Contemporary Age ==\n\n\n=== Cortes of Cadiz ===\nThe Constitution of 1812 devoted the six articles of Title IX to \"public instruction\", including the article on freedom of the press. It provides for the establishment of \"schools of first letters\" throughout the territory, as well as \"other establishments of instruction\", and a \"competent number of universities\". It retained the power of the Cortes to enact \"special plans and statutes\", entrusting the Government with the \"inspection of public education\" through a \"general directorate of studies\". The simple curriculum established for primary schools (\"to read, write and count, and the catechism of the Catholic religion\") is transcendental for the political objective of creating an electoral body of citizens, to which a deadline is set: although for the moment elections were held by universal suffrage (male and indirect), according to Article 25 \"From the year one thousand eight hundred and thirty, those who once again enter into the exercise of the rights of citizens must know how to read and write\". The influence of Condorcet' s writings and the French revolutionary constitutions of 1791, 1793 and 1795 on the Cádiz text has been pointed out, with the exception of what concerns the universities.\nIn the same year, 1812, a Board of Public Instruction was set up and commissioned to report on the general reform of national education. In 1813, the poet and politician Manuel José Quintana drafted the so-called Quintana Report, which was subsequently transformed into law during the Liberal Triennium.\n\n\n=== Ferdinand VII ===\nThe return of Ferdinand VII produced an absolutist reaction which, among other consequences, meant that the Catholic Church was given the preponderant role in education that it had previously enjoyed and a return to the 1771 plan. For the universities, a new Board of Public Instruction was created to draw up a programme more in line with the principles of absolutism.\n\nDuring the second absolutist restoration in Spain (1823–1833), private education (understood to be secular, since that of the religious orders was never considered private) was suppressed because it \"mocks the zeal of authority and poisons the youth\" ―it was also reproached that French and English were taught in its schools because all that could be read in those languages were impiety and obscenities aimed at \"provoking the most unbridled lasciviousness\"―. As for the university, the professors were purged ―in Santiago some thirty were \"impurified\", in Valencia half of them― and the teaching was \"re-Christianised\" and regulated by the \"Calomarde plan\", named after the Secretary of the Office of Grace and Justice, Francisco Tadeo Calomarde, in whose elaboration notable religious and lay people had participated. The study of modern science, of \"the Cartesios and Neutones\", was eliminated because, as the professors of the University of Cervera stated, \"far from us the dangerous novelty of discourse\" ―\"it has set us back a century\", a student from La Laguna would say―. Students enrolling for the first time had to present a certificate of \"good political and religious conduct\" signed by their parish priest and the civil authority, and to receive an academic degree they had to swear an oath to defend the sovereignty of the king, the doctrine of the Council of Constance on regicide and the Immaculate Conception. At the University of La Laguna there was a \"tribunal of censorship\" that monitored the conduct of the students.\nPrimary education was regulated by the Plan and general regulations of 16 February 1825, also the work of Calomarde and his ecclesiastical advisors. In the primary schools, boys were to be taught Christian doctrine, reading and writing, spelling and elementary arithmetic, but girls were to be taught only Christian doctrine and \"to read, at least in the catechisms, and to write moderately\" and above all they were to be taught \"the work proper to their sex, namely: knitting, cutting and sewing common clothes, embroidery and lace making\". In addition, the devotions they were to perform were established, such as \"Blessed and praised be\" when entering and leaving and praying the rosary every day. Teachers were required to provide \"information on the cleanliness of their blood\".\nTo avoid revolutionary disorders, the universities were closed on 12 October 1830, and the closure was extended for the following academic year, not being allowed to open again until 18 October 1832. Paradoxically, in the same year, 1830, the Bullfighting School in Seville had opened.\n\n\n=== Isabella II ===\nThe universities, like society, did not find peace in the turbulent 19th century, because economic and political conditions failed to stabilise. Successive governments issued different educational legislation. The Moderate Decade (1844–1854) was characterised by continuous reforms to the Pidal Plan. In 1850, a Royal Decree of 28 August 1850 referred for the first time to District Universities. In 1851 it was ordered that the universities should report monthly to the Directorate General of Public Instruction. In 1852 and 1853 other partial reforms were made.\nThe plans to found a Central University in Madrid, which had begun during the Liberal Triennium, did not materialise until 1836, when the studies of the Complutense University of Alcalá de Henares were transferred to the capital.\n\n\n==== Pidal Plan of 1845 ====\nPromoted by the Minister of the Interior, Pedro José Pidal, it was drafted mainly by Antonio Gil de Zárate, whose pedagogical principles have been summarised as \"freedom, gratuity, centralisation, inspection and uniformity\". It had little significance; and being a simple ministerial-level decree, it could be subject to modification and repeal, which occurred in 1847 and 1850.\n\n\n==== Concordat of 1851 ====\nArticle 2 of the Concordat of 1851 stated that \"instruction in universities, colleges, seminaries and public and public schools of all kinds shall be in conformity with the doctrine of the Catholic religion itself\".\n\n\n==== Moyano Law of 1857 ====\nThe first comprehensive and rational educational law in Spain was the Public Instruction Law of 1857, known as the Moyano Law. It attempted to solve the serious problem of illiteracy the country was suffering from.\nWhen the Progressives came to power (Progressive Biennium, 1854–1856), it was already clear that there was a need for a law with the status of a law to regulate the complex web of national education. Progressives and moderates now converged on the issue of education, agreeing on the broad outlines of the liberal educational system. Although the ideological division would reappear later with the alternating parties of Cánovas and Sagasta, it seems that by this time the differences between them were not so great as far as education was concerned. This explains why a good part of Alonso Martínez' s project ― the only thing that made time in the Progressive Biennium― was incorporated into the Public Instruction Law of 9 September 1857, known as the Moyano Law.\nThus, the moderates managed to consolidate the liberal education system by means of a law with a vocation for permanence ―the law would remain in force for more than a hundred years―. Its architect, Claudio Moyano, would resort to the formulation of a basic law which, by setting out the fundamental principles of the system, would thus avoid parliamentary debate on delicate and complex issues. Although this approach had previously been adopted by other ministers without achieving positive results, the political moment was now right for a speedy procedure and a successful achievement of the proposed objectives. Moreover, there were two fundamental reasons for obtaining the approval of the Cortes:\n\nThe need for a general law establishing the education system built up over almost fifty years.\nThe existence of a fairly broad consensus on the educational institutions that the different regulations had been implementing.\nFor all these reasons, it can be said that the Moyano Law was not an innovative law, but rather a regulation that enshrined an educational system whose fundamental bases were already to be found in the Regulations of 1821, in the Plan of the Duke of Rivas of 1836 and in the Pidal Plan of 1845.\nThis can be seen not only in the organisation of education into three grades but also in the regulation of each academic level. Thus, in primary education, the traditional criterion of the existence of two stages of education ―elementary and higher― is taken up, and the principle of relative gratuity is also established ―only for children whose parents could not pay for it― as well as the criteria already known about its financing, the selection of teachers and the regulation of teacher training colleges. With regard to secondary education, which now acquires its own substance and full autonomy from higher education, the division into two types of studies ―general and applied―, the definitive establishment of the institutes and their financing from the provincial budgets are established. Finally, university education was regulated by means of the well-known distinction between Faculty Studies, Technical Education and Professional Education, reaffirming the principle of the Pidal Plan that only studies carried out in public establishments would be academically valid.\nWith the Moyano Law, therefore, the great principles of historical moderantism were definitively implemented:\n\nrelative gratuity for primary education (5)\ncentralisation\nuniformity\nsecularization and\nlimited freedom of education.\nWith regard to the requirements for obtaining authorisation for private schools, the law maintains the criterion of graduating the requirements. Thus, for primary education, it is sufficient to be twenty years old and hold a teacher's qualification; for secondary education, on the other hand, the requirements are increased, with the need for the teaching staff to hold the corresponding qualification, a deposit to be made and the internal regulations of the establishment to be subject to the provisions dictated by the Government. If, on the other hand, the public school wished to obtain the benefit of incorporation, that is to say, the academic validity of the studies taken, the requirements would be greater, with special emphasis on the qualification ―the one required for Institute Professors― subject to the same programmes as in public centres and annual examination in the Institutes to which the schools are incorporated (art. 51).\nUnderstandably, the main feature of this Law was the absolute and direct control of the institutions established in Madrid, with the central government owning and managing them through the Royal Council of Public Instruction. It is also understandable that within its characteristics, the uniformity for which the Government was betting on when it came to implementing this Law, being secular, free during the first stage of education and being paid in the second stage.\nWhat cannot be avoided is the biased nature of that law with regard to women, as they occupied a passive role in which their education was not common, so that exclusive means were used for women, creating specific subjects for women in education, with the teaching profession as the only qualification suitable for women.\nThe structure of the education system was basically as follows;\n\nFirst Education, provided in schools and free of charge.\nSecondary Education, taught in secondary schools, which gave the right to take examinations to obtain the degree of Bachelor of Arts (essential to begin optional education and recommended to opt for higher education).\nFaculty Studies (initially Philosophy, Law, Science, Medicine, Pharmacy and Theology), which were taught in Universities, gave access to the degree of Bachelor, Licentiate of Science and, if continued, Doctor;\nHigher Education, taught in the Higher Schools for degrees in engineering, Fine Arts (Architecture, Painting and Sculpture, Music...), Diplomacy and Notary;\nProfessional Education, which was taught in specific centres for the degrees of Primary School Teacher, Veterinarian, Commercial Teacher, Nautical Teacher, and Master Builder/Surveyor/Surveyor.\n\n\n==== University protests and the Night of St. Daniel (1865) ====\nThe last years of the reign of Isabella II were characterised by an increase in political repression, especially at the university level. The government demanded that the rector of the Central University, Juan Manuel Montalbán, dismiss Professor of History Emilio Castelar. When the rector refused, the Minister of Public Works, Antonio Alcalá Galiano, dismissed Montalbán and stripped Castelar of his professorship. Several professors (among them Nicolás Salmerón and Miguel Morayta) resigned out of solidarity, and student protests were organised, which were harshly repressed on the so-called Night of St. Daniel (10 April 1865), causing fourteen deaths and one hundred and ninety-three injured.\n\n\n=== Democratic Sexennium ===\n\nAfter the Revolution of 1868, the \"Manifesto\" of the provisional government (25 October 1868) dealt extensively with education, particularly academic freedom. In the Decree of 21 October 1868, it was developed legislatively. It was intended to deprive the State of its ability to organise teaching methods, textbooks and curricula, which became the responsibility of teachers. Both public and private schools were to submit pupils to the same examinations in the same courts. The Decree of 25 October 1868 reorganised secondary education, reducing the weight of Latin and increasing that of the Castilian language, and introducing subjects such as psychology, art, Spanish history, fundamental principles of law, agriculture and commerce. Article 24 of the 1869 Constitution established the most absolute freedom to found and manage educational establishments, the only function of the inspectorate being to control \"hygiene\" and \"morality\".\n\n\n=== Restoration ===\n\n\n==== Orovio's Circular and the Institución Libre de Enseñanza ====\nJust at the beginning of the Restoration, the Minister of Public Works, the Marquis of Orovio, imposed an ideological purge on the teaching staff by means of the so-called \"Orovio Circular\" (1875), which obliged teachers to swear an oath not to teach doctrines contrary to Catholicism. This was refused by the most prominent Krausists, who left the university and founded the Institución Libre de Enseñanza (1876), a transcendental pedagogical reform movement headed by Francisco Giner de los Ríos.\n\n\n==== Decrees of Romanones ====\nFormulated on 17 August 1901, this Decree organised Secondary Education in Spain under the prism of modernity, developing a project of curricular agglutination through \"General and Technical Institutes\", destined to become macro centres of Secondary Education with at least seven possible academic offerings. An ambitious project of seven subjects per year and a basic revalidation for the awarding of the degree, which failed because it was provocative in the face of complaints from the press, families, politicians and teachers of the time.\n\n\n===== 1901 Secondary Education Decree =====\nIn August 1901, the Minister of Public Instruction, Count de Romanones, issued a Royal Decree that reformed the de facto Secondary Education system. Its introduction states that \"the arduous problem of national education cannot be solved with partial reforms\". The Decree came to change the Spanish education system from top to bottom.\nArticle 1 renamed the Provincial Institutes of Secondary Education as General and Technical Institutes, and established their teachings:\n\n1.° General studies of the degree of Bachelor.\n2.° Elementary and higher studies of the Magisterio de Primera Enseñanza.\n3.° Elementary studies in agriculture.\n4.° Elementary studies in Industry.\n5.° Elementary studies in commerce.\n6.° Elementary studies in Fine Arts.\n7.° Evening classes for workers.\nArticle 2 established the curriculum for obtaining the bachelor's degree. Divided into six years, students would study seven subjects per year, except in the 3rd and 6th years, when they would have to pass eight subjects. Article 3 stipulated that classes were to last one hour, and at most one and a half hours. The cloisters were responsible for determining the general timetable of the school. Article 4 limited the number of pupils per class to 150. If the number of pupils exceeded this figure, the classes would be divided into two sections and would be taught by the same professor, who would count the class hours as double. When the number of students exceeded 300, there would be two sections under the responsibility of the professor and one under the responsibility of the corresponding assistant. The professor who had to explain for more than eighteen hours a week would receive, by reason of accumulation, a bonus of 1000 pesetas.\nArticle 5 established that all subjects in this plan were compulsory in order to obtain the degree of Bachelor, except for Religion, in which it was optional to enrol, and the fourth, fifth and sixth years of Drawing, which only students who had obtained a certificate of aptitude to continue their studies from the teacher (hence the catchphrase of the two Marías) had to attend. Article 6 stipulated that the examinations for the course test and the exercises for the degree would be carried out in strict compliance with the provisions of the examination regulations of 10 May 1901.\nArticle 7 prohibited the charging of examination fees by the professors and teachers of the Institutes. The payment of these fees was to be made on State payment paper. To compensate for this, the scale of professors was created in the following way:\n\n50 full professors, at 8,000 pesetas.\n50 ídem for fourth promotion, at 7,500 pesetas.\n50 ídem for third promotion, at 7.000 pesetas.\n100 ídem for second promotion, at 6,000 pesetas.\n100 ídem for first promotion, at 5,000 pesetas.\nThe rest of the entrance fee, at 4,000 pesetas.\nThe professors of the Institutes of Madrid will also enjoy a salary increase of 1,000 pesetas for residence. Once this reform was implemented, a scale of special secondary school teachers was formed, which included French Language, English or German Language and Drawing, taking into account the amount of the salaries currently enjoyed, by reason of seniority, by existing teachers.\nArticles 8 and 9 provided for the inspection of official and private schools and established that the Government could provisionally appoint inspectors in each university district with more than 5 years' experience in the teaching profession, or be or have been a Councillor for Public Instruction or University Professor, even if they had not served five years. The budget shall include a sum calculated to be sufficient for the payment of the allowances of the Inspectors.\nArticle 10 provided for the staffing of all the Institutes:\n\n1 Professor of Latin.\n1 Professor of Spanish Language and Literature, who would be the current Professor of Literary History and Preceptive.\n1 Professor of Commercial and Statistical Geography and Cosmography.\n1 of Arithmetic and Geometry.\n1 of Algebra and Trigonometry.\n1 of General Descriptive Geography of Europe and Spain, History of Spain and Universal History.\n1 of Psychology, Logic, Ethics and Rudiments of Law.\n1 of Physics and Chemistry.\n1 of Natural History, Physiology and Hygiene.\n1 of Agriculture and Agricultural and Industrial Technique.\n1 of French Language.\n1 of English or German Language.\n1 teacher of Geometrical and Artistic Drawing and Gymnastics and 1 teacher of Calligraphy in the Provincial Institutes.\n1 Chaplain.\n1 numerary assistant of Letters.\n1 idem id. for Science.\n1 idem id. for Languages.\n2 idem id. for Drawing.\nIn the Institutes of Madrid, there would be two Assistants of Letters and two of Sciences.\n1 Teacher of Pedagogy and School Law in the Provincial Institutes.\n1 Assistant Teacher in the Provincial Institutes.\n1 Teacher of Topography and Surveying in the Provincial Institutes.\n1 Teacher of Construction, Mechanics and Electrical Engineering in the Provincial Institutes.\n1 Teacher of Arithmetic, Commercial Calculations and Bookkeeping in the Institutes where Commerce Studies are offered.\n1 Teacher of Figure, Ornamental and Architectural Drawing and Decorative Composition, where there are elementary studies in Fine Arts.\n1 Teacher of Modelling and Casting in Provincial Institutes.\n1 Workshop teacher in the provincial institutes.\n1 Workshop assistant in the provincial institutes.\n\n\n===== 1901 First Education Decree =====\nThere was a presentation with a reflection on the importance of the decree:I offered as an example worthy of imitation the conduct of those Crown Councillors who, by their persistence in determining as the only possible solution to the problem of primary education the solution proposed today, as shown by the Royal Decree of 30 April 1886, countersigned by Mr. Montero Ríos, and the Royal Decree of 7 December 1888, countersigned by Mr. Canalejas, left the direction that the liberal party was to follow regarding the payment by the State of the teachers' salaries.\nThis feeling was corroborated by the unanimous opinion of all those in Spain who are dedicated to this teaching function, and in response to the urgent demands of public opinion, this reform was born in the heat of a national aspiration, which could not be ignored with reprehensible indifference, nor should it be disregarded with punishable neglect.\nIt is not for the undersigned Minister to judge what his own work may deserve; but it must be lawful for him on the present occasion to declare with all sincerity that he has never believed that he has better fulfilled the duties of his office, his duties to the Nation and his duties to Your Majesty, than at the present moment, by submitting the following draft decree to your Royal sanction.\n\nCount of Romanones.\n\n\n==== Board for the Extension of Studies and the Student Residence ====\nWithin the regenerationist cultural environment, the Board for the Extension of Studies and Scientific Research (Junta para Ampliación de Estudios e Investigaciones Científicas) was created in 1907, and in 1910 the Student Residence (Residencia de Estudiantes) was established within it.\n\n\n=== Second Republic ===\nThe first educational measures promoted by the Second Republic were:\n\nBilingualism: defended or demanded from Catalonia. It was expressed in a Decree of 1931 in which the existence of different languages was recognised. The Decree states that, in the case of Catalan, teaching will be in the mother tongue up to the age of 8 at school, either Spanish or Catalan.\nReorganisation of the Council of Public Instruction, whose president was Miguel de Unamuno (rector).\nReligious education: this issue will take shape with the publication of a decree on religious congregations and confessions. This decree regulates and abolishes the compulsory teaching of religion, based on religious freedom and freedom of conscience for children and teachers.\nCreation of the Pedagogical Missions. This was a continuation of the idea of the ILE called \"university extension\" and the aim was to extend general culture or teaching modernisation, education in villages, towns and places that needed it, fundamentally in rural areas, and civic education.\nAttention to primary school, as it was thought to be the cornerstone of education. They proposed the construction of 27,000 schools (the most important challenge) to provide schooling for the one million children who did not attend school, as there were none at the time. This was to be done through a \"five-year plan\", whereby 7,000 schools would be built in the first year and 5,000 schools in each of the following four years.\nThe problem was that they needed financing, about 400 million pesetas through public debt. At this that there was an economic recession (the crash of '29). In the end, the schools that were planned were not built.\nAn attempt was made to endow an educational law in accordance with the thinking of the Second Republic, and Lorenzo Luzuriaga was the one who drew up the document with the following basic principles:\n\nPublic education should be an essential function of the State. However, it could be delegated to the region, to the municipality... provided that these entities could justify their economic and cultural solvency. The existence of private education is accepted as long as it does not pursue political or partisan ends.\nPublic education must be secular. Schools should only provide information on the history of religions as another subject, with special reference to the Catholic religion. If parents request it, the State should provide the means to provide this religious education, but always outside the school.\nEducation should be free of charge, especially at primary level. For the university, 25% free tuition should be reserved.\nEducation must have an active and creative character, also on a permanent basis, by providing further training courses for teachers.\nPublic education should have a social character, the school should be integrated into society and therefore, there should be a greater connection between parents and the educational community.\nThey defend coeducation, i.e. the non-separation of the sexes or, in other words, mixed education, where boys and girls should be educated together according to the same curriculum, and this idea would be applicable to all levels of education.\nPublic education is a unitary whole, made up of three levels with communication between them:\nPrimary. It would have two modalities: voluntary (4–6 years) and basic (6–12 years).\nSecondary. It would consist of two cycles: extension of primary education (12–15 years) and preparation for university courses (15–18 years).\nHigher or university level\nTeachers. Teachers need to be convinced of the pedagogical programme so that it does not fail, and so teachers need to be adequately prepared and aware of it.\nDuring the Second Republic there were two distinct periods: the progressive biennium (1931–1933) and the conservative biennium (1934–1936).\n\n\n==== First Biennium (1931-1933) ====\n\nDuring the progressive biennium, profound educational transformations took place. In 1931, adult education was regulated by the Decree of the Patronage of Pedagogical Missions (Decreto de Patronato de Misiones Pedagógicas), which was a precedent for socio-cultural animation. The target groups were the most remote, neglected or depressed areas of Spain. They had an educational and cultural focus, but not an instructive one, as the aim was to stimulate motivation and cultural enjoyment rather than to emphasise content or literacy in the strict sense of the term. Their aim was to disseminate general culture, educational guidance and citizenship education in villages, towns and places with a special focus on the rural population. The activities carried out were varied and served a variety of purposes:\n\nCultural: popular libraries, public readings, conferences on various topics (health, agriculture), cinema sessions, etc.\nSocial: meetings with those responsible for the missions, conferences on political issues, etc.\nSocio-educational: activities directly connected with elements of formal and regulated education, such as refresher courses for teachers in the area, etc.\nIn 1932, the Pedagogy section was created in the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters at the University of Madrid. During the same year, the Decree on the Inspection of Primary Education (Decreto sobre la Inspección de la Primera Enseñanza) was approved, which formulated inspectors with a technical-pedagogical profile, as facilitators of learning who could and should guide teachers. This decree was a revolution. The General Inspectorate of Secondary Education (Inspección General de Segunda Enseñanza) was also created, following the same general guidelines as that of Primary Education. The Decree on the Immovability of Inspectors (Decreto de Inamovilidad de los Inspectores) was also approved, in order to avoid the interference of political power in their work. It allowed them to work with independence, autonomy and stability in the exercise of their profession and was considered a very important measure. At the same time, the Boards of Inspectors were created to facilitate coordination and communication between them.\nIn 1933, the Law on Religious Denominations and Congregations (Ley de Confesiones y Congregaciones Religiosas) was passed, which deprived the ecclesiastical establishment of teaching functions. To avoid the problems caused by their withdrawal, the Substitution Board (Junta de Sustituciones) was created, which meant that when a professor was unable to attend his classes, another teacher would take his place.\nA minor reform of the university was approved, where, among other measures, students' complaints were noted and examinations in each subject were eliminated. The Santander International Summer University was created.\n\n\n==== Second Biennium (1934-1936) ====\nThe 1933 elections give power to Gil Robles' CEDA coalition, a right-wing party. There was a shift in Republican policy which had a decisive influence on education and which became known as the \"educational counter-reform\":\n\nDecrease in the number of pupils\nProhibition of coeducation in primary schools, which meant that boys and girls had to study separately.\nAbolition of the Central Inspectorate of Education, citing lack of money.\nAbolition of the Decree on the Immovability of Inspectors.\nAt the university, student representation in governing bodies was abolished.\nFiliberto Villalobos took up the creation of schools. He was also responsible for the creation of the seven baccalaureate courses.\n\n\n=== Francoism ===\n\n\n==== Law for the Reform of Secondary Education of 1938 ====\nIn the midst of the civil war, the Law for the Reform of Secondary Education (Ley de Reforma de la Enseñanza Media de 1938) was passed, promoted by the ministry of Pedro Sáinz Rodríguez.\n\n\n==== Law on the Organisation of the Spanish University of 1943. ====\n\nIn the post-war period, the Law on the Organisation of Spanish Universities (Ley de Ordenación de la Universidad Española, July 29, 1943) was passed, promoted by the ministry of Pedro Sainz Rodríguez.\n\n\n==== Law on Primary Education of 1945 ====\nIn the post-war period, the Law on Primary Education of 1945 was passed (Ley sobre Educación Primaria de 1945), promoted by the ministry of José Ibáñez Martín. This law only affected primary education and was supplemented, belatedly, by a Decree of 1967. It reflected the ideology of Franco's regime, considering education as a right of the family, the Church and the State, which meant that it was marked by national-Catholic thinking. Therefore, primary education had a confessional, patriotic, social, intellectual, physical and professional character. It was compulsory, free of charge, and the separation of the sexes, as well as the compulsory use of the Spanish language throughout the national territory.\nPrimary education ranged from six to twelve years of age and was provided in various types of schools: national, Church, patronage and private. The curriculum was centralised and organised in a cyclical manner, grouping knowledge into three types: instrumental, formative and complementary.\nThis law established the rights and duties of teachers and determined their training and the system for admission by competitive examination to the (Cuerpo del Magisterio Nacional Primario).\n\n\n==== Law on the Organisation of Secondary Education of 1953 ====\nThe Law on the Organisation of Secondary Education of 1953 (Ley de Ordenación de la Enseñanza Media de 1953) was promoted during the ministry of Joaquín Ruiz Jiménez. This law, homologous to the previous one, regulated secondary education and was also reformed in 1967. It was a confessional and ideological law. Access to secondary education was by means of an entrance examination. The regulations established general and special baccalaureate programmes. The general baccalaureate consisted of a four-year elementary baccalaureate, a revalidation for access to the higher baccalaureate of two more years and another revalidation. In addition, there was a preparatory course for university, called Preuniversitario (PREU). The baccaulaurate of special plan, labour baccalaureate, consisted of five courses and two further revalida.\n\n\n==== General Education Act of 1970 ====\nThe General Education Law of 1970 was promoted by the ministry of José Luis Villar Palasí, the true architect of the law.\nThe need for change in the 1970s was evident in Spain at the social, political and educational levels. A law covering the whole of the national education system was necessary. It was intended to provide the country with an education system that was fairer, more efficient and more in line with the needs of the Spanish people. The basic criteria for this law were unity, covering the different educational levels, interrelation between them, and flexibility.\nThe structure of the education system was established as follows:\n\nNursery education, from two to four years of age. It was voluntary and was mainly provided in private schools and nursery schools.\nPre-school education, from four to six years. It was voluntary and was provided in public and private schools by specialist pre-school teachers. The curriculum was limited to maturational aspects and preparation for instrumental subjects: pre-reading, pre-writing and pre-calculus.\nGeneral Basic Education (Educación General Básica, EGB), from six to fourteen years of age. It was compulsory and free of charge. The eight grades were divided into two stages (First Stage for the first five grades and Second Stage for the remaining three) and three cycles.\nThe Initial Cycle, from six to eight years of age, comprised the first two years.\nThe Intermediate Cycle, from eight to eleven years of age, comprised the third, fourth and fifth years.\nThe Superior Cycle, from twelve to fourteen years of age, comprised the last three years.\nStudents could obtain one of two diplomas:\nHigh School Diploma (Graduado Escolar), when the objectives of the eight years of EGB were successfully passed. It allowed pupils to continue their studies in Baccalaurate or Vocational Training.\nCompletion Certificate for Compulsory Education (Certificado de Escolaridad), which accredited having completed the eight years of schooling but did not provide information on their achievement. It only gave access to Vocational Training or to leaving the education system.\nThe internal structure of subjects was established in the New Pedagogical Orientations (Nuevas Orientaciones Pedagógicas, 1970). The teaching staff in this Law included the former Primary School Teachers homologated with those coming from the Reform which for the first time included them in the University with the rank of University Graduates and titles of teachers of Basic General Education.\nUnified Polyvalent Baccalaureate (Bachillerato Unificado Polivalente, BUP). It consisted of three courses, from fourteen to seventeen years of age. There were common subjects in the first year and a moderate diversification thereafter depending on the specialisation (arts, sciences, and a mixture of both). At the end of the course, if the pupils were successful, they were awarded the title of Bachelor. In order to enter university, it was necessary to take the University Orientation Course (Curso de Orientación Universitaria, COU), which began with the aim of guiding students in their choice of career and ended up being a fourth year of the Baccalaurate, intended, if possible, to pass the Selectividad exam.\nProfessional Education (Formación Profesional), intended for students who did not obtain the High School Diploma (Graduado Escolar) or for those who were interested in a professional qualification for the world of work. It had two levels: First Grade Vocational Training, which lasted two years and at the end of which the title of Auxiliary Technician was obtained if the studies were passed (or the Completion Certificate for Compulsory Education if they did not passed); and Second Grade Vocational Training, which lasted three years and allowed the title of Specialist Technician to be obtained. Professional Education was provided by Professional Education Institutes.\nSchools of Applied Arts and Artistic Trades (Escuelas de Artes Aplicadas y Oficios Artísticos, AAyOA).\nSpecial Education was strongly boosted by this law, as was Adult Education and Distance Education, with the creation of CENEBAD (National Centre for Basic Distance Education), INBAD (National Institute for Distance Baccalaureate) and UNED (National University of Distance Education).\nHigher Education was provided at the Universities, which were accessed after completing the COU or FP2. It had three levels:\nDiplomatura or first cycle, lasting three years. It was taken at the University Schools and it was not necessary to pass the Selectividad. At the end of the course, the Diploma was awarded.\nBachelor's Degree, Engineering or Architecture, of five years' duration. It was taken at the University Faculties after passing the Selectividad.\nDoctorate, the highest university degree. It required the completion of certain credits spread over two years and ended with the presentation of the doctoral thesis.\nThe teaching model followed in this Law was technocratic, along behaviourist lines. In general terms, it followed a process-product approach to learning. The teacher model was consequently technical and competent, designing good programmes with clear and measurable objectives.\nThe General Education Act gave a strong boost to Spanish education by strengthening and unifying the education system and introducing curricular, organisational and technological innovations. Among the most progressive and advanced measures of the LGE are the following:\n\nIt is the first time in Spain, after the Moyano Law, that a law is enacted to regulate the entire education system, from pre-school to university education.\nCreation of a common core, General Basic Education, lasting eight years.\nIntroduction of Professional Formation in the ordinary education system and its connection with the university.\nDignification and elevation of the teaching career to university status.\nEstablishment of a scholarship system to achieve equal opportunities among students.\nInstitutionalisation of school, personal and professional guidance.\nAchieved, for the first time, full schooling of Spaniards at compulsory levels, avoiding premature selection.\nRecommendation of active, individual, original and creative methods.\nIntroduction of the concept of continuous assessment.\n\n\n=== Democracy ===\n\n\n==== Constitution of 1978 ====\n\nArticle 27 of the Constitution was devoted to the right to education and freedom of education, establishing compulsory and free basic education and university autonomy, as well as the general programming of education and educational inspection by the public authorities. It allows for the creation of educational establishments both by private initiative and by the public authorities (properly speaking, by the autonomous communities, given that it is they who will acquire competences in education); providing that both can receive public funding, which results in the establishment of three types of establishments: public, subsidised and private.\nReligious education, as well as the course of religion, were guaranteed both in the constitutional text (through the expression \"the right of parents for their children to receive the religious and moral education that is in accordance with their own convictions\") and in the 1979 Agreements between the Spanish State and the Holy See, which were being negotiated at the same time. In practice, the confessional subject of \"Catholic Religion\", which had been compulsory since the Franco regime, became an optional subject for students (who can substitute it for another subject called \"Ethics\", which was subsequently treated differently) and which schools must offer as compulsory, taught by teachers appointed by the ecclesiastical authorities and paid for by the public authorities.\n\n\n==== Organic Law regulating the Statute of Educational Establishments (LOECE) 1980 ====\nThe Ley Orgánica por la que se regula el Estatuto de Centros Escolares (LOECE) 1980, promoted by the ministry of José Manuel Otero (UCD government). It was appealed before the Constitutional Court, which partially upheld the appeal, eliminating several points of the law.\n\n\n==== Law on University Act (LRU) 1983 ====\nThe University Reform Law, promoted by the ministry of José María Maravall (PSOE government) was the first renewal of legislation in this field since the Franco regime, since the Organic Law of University Autonomy (LAU), passed between 1980 and 1982 (UCD governments) was never approved.\n\n\n==== Organic Law regulating the Right to Education (LODE) of July 3, 1985 ====\nPromoted by the ministry of José María Maravall (PSOE government). Known by its acronym LODE (Ley Orgánica reguladora de Derecho a la Educación de 3 de julio de 1985), it is not a law that affects the structure of the educational system, but rather regulates the duality of educational centres, the participation of the educational community in teaching, the right to education and determines democratic management, as opposed to the previous technocratic one. Its more specific development in the aforementioned areas is contained in Royal Decree 2376/1985. This Decree has been partially modified by the Organic Regulations of Infant and Primary Schools and Secondary Schools and by the Order of 29 June 1994 approving the instructions regulating the organisation and operation of Infant and Primary Schools. It has been almost entirely reformed by the LOPEG (Organic Law 9/1995 of 20 November 1995) on the evaluation, participation and governance of schools.\n\n\n==== Organic Law on the General Organisation of the Spanish Education System (LOGSE) of 1990 ====\nPromoted by the ministry of Javier Solana Madariaga (PSOE government), the Organic Law on the General Organisation of the Spanish Education System of 1990 (Ley Orgánica de Ordenación General del Sistema Educativo de España de 1990, LOGSE) insisted on pedagogical concepts such as comprehensiveness, integration and attention to diversity, adaptation to students with special educational needs (Alumnos con Necesidades Específicas de Apoyo Educativo, ACNEAE), differentiation of educational content into conceptual, procedural and attitudinal, transversality, education in values or preference for active and participatory methodologies.\nIt extended compulsory education from the age of six to 16 (previously set at 14), preceded by non-compulsory pre-school education. The compulsory courses are six years of Primary Education and four years of Compulsory Secondary Education (Educación Secundaria Obligatoria (ESO), which replaces the last two years of the former EGB and the first two years of the former BUP), followed by post-compulsory secondary education: a two-year Baccalaureate or the \"Grado Medio\" of the new Professional Education structure.\nHowever, the objective of compulsory schooling for all fifteen- and sixteen-year-olds was not achieved until 1999, given the long implementation periods.\n\n\n==== Organic Law on the Quality of Education (LOCE) of 2002 ====\nPromoted by the Ministry of Pilar del Castillo (PP government). The Organic Law on the Quality of Education (Ley Orgánica de la Educación de 2002, LOCE) published in 2002, its implementation deadlines did not allow it to be implemented for the most part, since after the 2004 elections the parliamentary majority and the government changed.\n\n\n==== Organic Law on Education (LOE) of 2006 ====\nThe Organic Law on Education (Ley Orgánica de Educación de 2006, LOE) was promoted by the ministries of María Jesús San Segundo and Mercedes Cabrera (PSOE government).\n\n\n==== Organic Law for the Improvement of the Quality of Education (LOMCE) of 2013 ====\nThe Organic Law for the Improvement of the Quality of Education (Ley Orgánica para la Mejora de la Calidad Educativa de 2013, LOMCE) was promoted by the ministry of José Ignacio Wert (PP government).\n\n\n==== Organic Law for the Modification of the LOE (LOMLOE) of 2020 ====\nThe Organic Law for the Modification of the LOE (Ley Orgánica de Modificación de la LOE de 2020, LOMLOE) was promoted by the ministry of Isabel Celaá (PSOE-UP coalition government), it is still in force (2024).\n\n\n== See also ==\nEducation in Spain\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"La enésima reforma del sistema educativo\".

        "content": "Cytonuclear discordance describes the discrepancy in phylogenetic relationships using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) versus nuclear genes (or nuclear DNA, nDNA). In other words, mitochondrial and nuclear gene sequences may lead to different, if not contradictory conclusions with respect to the relationships among species. In theory, nuclear DNA and mt DNA sequences should lead to similar phylogenetic relationships among species but this is often not the case.\nAn example are Australian rock-wallabies (Petrogale) in which several species form a monophyletic group with nDNA genes, but not with mtDNA. This cytonuclear discordance involves at least four operational taxonomic units (OTUs) across four species.\nMany other taxonomic groups display cytonuclear discordance, e.g. Burmese pythons or vipers of the genus Cerastes.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Mounir Akbache (born 14 March 1986) is a French middle-distance runner. After achieving modest success on the national level, he became a pacemaker for the Diamond League. As a rabbit, Akbache has paced several middle-distance world records in athletics, including for the indoor 3000 metres and outdoor 2000 metres. \n\n\n== Athletics career ==\nAkbache's individual career started as early as 2006, and he raced at several French Athletics Championships with a best placing of 4th at the 2015 indoor edition in the 1500 metres. Despite national-level successes, he was not able to qualify for the highest level of international competition, so he became a pacemaker.\n\n\n== Pacing career ==\nAkbache paced his first world record at the 2023 Meeting Hauts-de-France Pas-de-Calais, leading Lamecha Girma to break a 25-year-old record in the indoor 3000 metres. Speaking in French after the race, Akbache said, \"I could feel that [Girma] was hyper-confident. He'd done some crazy sessions in training, he knew he had the world record in his legs\".\nAkbache is one of Jakob Ingebrigtsen's favorite pacemakers, and he helped Ingebrigtsen break the 2000 metres world record at the 2023 Memorial Van Damme. At the 2023 Bislett Games, Akbache paced Ingebrigtsen through the first lap in 55.47 seconds, leading Track & Field News to state \"the pacing couldn’t have been better\". Ingebrigtsen would set a best of 3:27.95 in that race, a national record.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nAkbache is a member of the Club athlétique de Montreuil 93 athletics club in France. He studied at the Institut national des sciences appliquées de Lyon, and he is also an engineer at the Roads Testing and Materials Department for the Centre Expérimental de Recherches et d'Etudes du Bâtiment et des Travaux Publics.\n\n\n== Statistics ==\n\n\n=== Personal best progression ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMounir Akbache at World Athletics",

Later in 2017, Ninyakanon lost the franchise to another local organizer Montri Siriwatanavarakorn (มนตรี ศิริวัฒนาวรากร), who organized the first Miss Grand Chumphon competition on 6 May 2017, in which an airline business management student from the University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce, Techini Kalong, was named the winner.The pageant was skipped once; in 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand, the national organizer was unable to organize the national event, and the country representative for the international tournament was appointed instead.\nWinner gallery\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Editions ==\nThe following table details Miss Grand Chumphon's annual editions since 2016.\n\nNotes\n\n\n== National competition ==\nThe following is a list of Chumphon representatives who competed at the Miss Grand Thailand pageant.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Miss Grand Chumphon at Wikimedia Commons\nMiss Grand Thailand official website",

Distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing, it was released theatrically in Spain on 11 September 2015.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nMirito Torreiro of Fotogramas rated the film 3 out of 5 stars deeming it to be a product \"a product with a certain suicidal vocation\", which \"hardly pays attention to any commerciality\".\nSergio F. Pinilla of Cinemanía rated the film 4 out of 5 stars writing that the triangle developed between the characters played by Clemente, Palacios, and Medina (\"the latter two magnificent, the former overacted\") \"is beautiful\".\nJordi Costa of El País considered that while \"the film is not rounded and at times comes across as crude and somewhat sloppy\", it \"manages to take its premise to its most unbreathable extremes\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Spanish films of 2015\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Hacking at Leaves is a 2024 Austrian documentary film directed and written by Johannes Grenzfurthner. It explores various themes including the United States' colonial past, Navajo tribal history, and the hacker movement, through the lens of the story of a hackerspace in Durango, Colorado, during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. The film was produced by monochrom.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nHacking at Leaves features Austrian artist and filmmaker Johannes Grenzfurthner as both host and director, blending documentary and fiction to delve into themes of optimism, freedom, settler colonialism, pandemics, and societal collapse within the American context.\nThe film introduces a fictional element to convey its message. Grenzfurthner, clad in a yellow radiation suit, sits in a 1970s-style control room (which he refers to as his \"flat\"), contemplating whether he should create a documentary about a makerspace in Durango, Colorado. This makerspace played a pivotal role in the global response to COVID-19 by producing medical equipment for the hard-hit Navajo Nation. However, Grenzfurthner is deterred by the thought that the content might be too depressing, and he doubts his ability to sell it to Netflix. Uncle Sam (performed by Max Grodénchik) appears, demanding that Grenzfurthner create an 'invigorating tale' about the 'spirit of freedom, the endless beauty of the American Southwest, and a forceful statement against collapse.' He seeks a 'true American story.'\nReluctantly, Grenzfurthner agrees to make the documentary, albeit with the intention of educating the audience about the downsides of the \"American story\" and colonialism. He navigates the complexities of these subjects, incorporating perspectives from activists, artists, and tech enthusiasts. The film draws connections between the Navajo community, hacker culture, and the DIY movement, suggesting that alternative approaches could facilitate societal transformation: \"This is a story about communities. It narrates not only the history of the Navajo Community and its struggles but also the history of hacking and hackerspaces and how such communities function within mainstream culture.\"\nIn an article in the Austrian magazine Profil, Grenzfurthner addresses the importance of the Overton window in discussing the contents of his documentary.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\nJohannes Grenzfurthner as Himself\nMax Grodénchik as Uncle Sam\nMorningstar Angeline as an anonymous anarcho-syndicalist Navajo hacker\nChase Masterson as two anonymous medical professionals\nInterviewees include Ryan Finnigan, Sunny Dooley, Stefan Yazzie, Jello Biafra, Cory Doctorow, Janene Yazzie, Karletta Chief, Erik Davis, Michael J. Epstein, Mitch Altman, Jason Scott, and many others.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\nGrenzfurthner began working on the film in March 2020 and managed to collect all the interviews before the end of 2020. Due to the travel ban preventing Europeans from entering the United States, the director oversaw the shooting and interviewing processes remotely from his office in Vienna. He later began assembling the footage received from various collaborators with editor Sebastian Schreiner. \nGrenzfurthner worked with Navajo cultural advisors like Manuelito Wheeler of the Navajo Nation Museum.\nThe framing story was filmed in the winter of 2020/2021 at the Zwentendorf Nuclear Power Plant and in No Name City, a former Western theme park in Wöllersdorf-Steinabrückl.\nBefore the film's release but after completing principal photography, Grenzfurthner hosted an exhibition in Anger, Styria in May 2021 to showcase parts of his research.\nThe film was supported by the Austrian Ministry of Culture as part of its program to support innovative film.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nThe film's world premiere took place at the Diagonale Film Festival in Graz, Austria, on April 6, 2024.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nBradley Gibson of Film Threat gave the film 8/10 and summarizes that the film \"explores the corruption eating away at the core of American social and political structures and provides yet another example of capitalism's dismal failures.\" Journalist and media researcher Philipp Stadelmaier states, \"This is not just about creating a 'movie,' but a toolkit that inspires DIY action. Anyone who wants to avert the apocalypse must let themselves be introduced to the technique of leaf hacking by Grenzfurthner, which aims to finally uproot a system that has been rotten for a long time.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nHacking at Leaves at IMDb",

She was educated in Fine Art in Boston and in London and she lectured at the University of Bahrain.\n\n\n== Life ==\nShe was born in about 1977. Her mother is Sheika Mai bint Mohammed Al Khalifa. She began learning about art when she was ten. Her mother encouraged her talents hiring an art tutor for her. She studied at Boston's Tufts University graduating in 1999 and she achieved a master's degree at the Slade School of Fine Art in London in 2002. She taught art at the University of Bahrain.\nIn 2008 she became the head of education at the Museum of Islamic Art in Doha. Her work in Doha was disrupted when the diplomatic crisis with Qatar happened, but the Fire Station Artist in Residence project which she had begun in 2015 continued. Her own art works have been bought by Doha's Mathaf Museum, the Jordan National Gallery of Fine Arts in Amman, Bahrain's National Museum and the Saudi Art Council.\nShe became Bahrain's Director General of the Culture and Arts and she was a colleague of her mother. Her mother mentored her and she led the Bahrain Authority for Culture and Antiquities. Her mother was sacked by Royal decree in 2022 and replaced by Khalifa bin Ahmed bin Abdulla Al Khalifa. Her mother had been known for her disregard for some government ministers, but the reason was said to be that she showed disrespect for an Israeli envoy when both were being hosted by the American ambassador.\n\n\n== Private life ==\nShe has two sons.\n\n\n== References ==",

In the forest complex is the ancient settlement of Horvat Danaila.\nIn the forest there is a short circular path and a free parking lot. The initiator of the planting of the forest was  chairman of the Jewish National Fund Board of Directors, Moshe Rivlin. Originally, the forest was supposed to be planted in the Negev, between Beersheba and Yatir area. The project's aim was to strengthen the relationship between the children of Israel and the children of the diaspora. Thousands of children from Israel and the Diaspora took part in the planting. Each child planted two trees: one for him and one for a child who perished in the Holocaust.\nTo comomorate the occasion of the forest planting, in December 1977, a series of stamps with a issued in the value of 1 shekel. It was the first Jewish National Fund stamp on which the value \"shekel\" appeared (the shekel coin came into use only later), and it was sold for 7.5 lei.\n\n\n== Reffernces ==",

        "content": "Grand Ecore is an unincorporated community in Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana, United States. It is located on LA-6, north of the city of Natchitoches on the Red River of the South. \nThe community is part of the Natchitoches Micropolitan Statistical Area.\nThe US Army Corps of Engineers operates a visitor center at Grand Ecore with panamoramic views from the bluff 80 feet above the Red River.  The location was site of a Civil War site. The area is known for its colonial history, civil war sites, hiking and fishing tournaments.\n\n\n== History ==\nSince time immemorial, the Caddo Indians settled the lands around Grand Ecore.  In 1718, the Brossart brothers brought out a colony from Lyons, France to settle the area. The first to receive land grants and to settle among the Natchitoches Indians (a Caddoan tribe) were Louis Latham, who settled near Las Tres Llonas, and Pierre and Julian Beson who settled at Grand Ecore. Over the next 70 years, the French then the Spanish colonial governments issued land grants to Bossier, Grappe, Prudehomme, Brevelle, and Metoyer.  These families operated vast plantations along the Red River and Cane River.  By the turn of the century, Dr. Sibley bought Grand Ecore and 500 acres on the opposing bank of the Red River. Fort Selden on Bayou Pierre, above Grand Ecore, was established in 1820 by companies of the 7th Infantry from Arkansas. They were Arkansas troops, commanded by Lieut. Colonel Zachary Taylor. The 7th Infantry was withdrawn in 1822 from that position to a new site, subsequently known as Fort Jesup.\n\n\n== References ==",

The historic stone house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 10, 1983, for its significance in architecture. It was listed as part of the Early Stone Houses of Bergen County Multiple Property Submission (MPS).\nAccording to the nomination form, the house was built before the American Revolutionary War based on a map by Robert Erskine. Cornelius Cornelius Haring lived here. His sons served in the British army. After the Baylor Massacre, the house was confiscated and sold to Henry Wisner. Garret Blauvelt bought it around 1783 or 1784. John J. Demarest purchased the house in 1853.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Bergen County, New Jersey\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Live on the Queen Mary is an album by the American musician Professor Longhair, released in 1978. He was allegedly upset about its release, as he claimed not to know that his performance was recorded.\nThe album is a favorite of Hugh Laurie, who, in tribute, filmed a special, Live on the Queen Mary, to promote his album Didn't It Rain.\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe album was produced by Tom Wilson. It was recorded during a 1975 party aboard the RMS Queen Mary, hosted by Paul McCartney to mark the end of the recording sessions for Venus and Mars. \"Stagger Lee\" is a version of the Lloyd Price song. \"I'm Movin' On\" is a cover of the Hank Snow tune. \"Cry to Me\" is a version of the song made famous by Solomon Burke. \"Gone So Long\" and \"Mess Around\" are performed as instrumentals. The liner notes are by John Broven, taken from his book Walking to New Orleans.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nThe Globe and Mail wrote that Professor Longhair \"gives an outstanding piano performance (about the only sound that comes through clearly) and a vocal show which hints that on a better day he could tear the joint down.\" In a subsequent article, the paper opined that Professor Longhair's piano playing is \"originality tantamount to the first time Lester Young or Charlie Parker did the first funny thing on the saxophone.\" The Liverpool Daily Post noted Professor Longhair's \"curious squeaky voice\" and \"rough-edged city blues.\" The Morning Call labeled Live on the Queen Mary \"a minor classic.\"\nNewsday praised his \"unique syncopation and earthy vocals.\" The Daily Breeze called Professor Longhair \"unquestionably one of the greatest talents ever to play a piano.\" Robert Christgau praised the uncredited backing musicians. The Kansas City Times opined that Professor Longhair's \"voice is surprisingly melodious.\" The New York Times deemed the album \"rollicking, exuberant piano blues with an undercurrent of deep feeling.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Eritrean diaspora comprises about half of population living in the country, becoming the most diasporic nation. In addition, one third Eritreans live aboard. In 2022, 37,357 Eritreans fled to Sudan, Egypt and Libya for seeking asylum, estimated around 1% of its population. Since 2001, 700,000 people have left the country as a result of political repression under Isais Afwerki. In 2015, approximately 40,000 Eritrean arrived via Mediterranean, becoming small country with large refugees in Africa.\n\n\n== History ==\nMost Eritreans scattered during the Eritrean War of Independence (1961–1991). In the mid-1950s, one-third of Eritreans lived aboard and emigration has increased largely due to political instability. Emperor Haile Selassie decreed Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church to be a state religion, which excluded Eritrean Muslims, leading up to the formation of the Eritrean Liberation Movement (ELM) in 1958. In 1961, those exiled Muslims established the Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF) in Cairo. Gradually, the Eritrean People’s Liberation Front (EPLF) established itself as a rival of the ELF, which dissolved in 1982 during the Ethiopian Civil War. During the era, the Derg government used strategic bombing in Eritrea that caused an exodus to Sudan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and other countries in the Arab world. Many were Eritrean Muslims, while Eritrean Christians, whose number increased in the 1980s, tried to claim asylum in Europe and North America.Between approximately 20,000 and 30,000 Eritrean Muslims left the country during the British Military Administration from 1941 to 1952 and the Ethiopian-Eritrean federation from 1952 to 1962. The population increased from half a million in the 1960s to one million in the 1970s. In Sudan, 600,000 Eritreans were registered in 1994 while excluding citizens living urban areas supported by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR). Following Eritrean independence in 1993, under President Isaias Afwerki and the People’s Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ), the Eritrean population turned diasporic due to constant conflicts and civil war. Although emigration decreased in the early years of the independence struggle, a mass exodus began in 2002 shortly after the Eritrean-Ethiopian War (1998–2000).The Eritrean diaspora comprises one third of Eritrean nationals with one million fleeing to foreign countries during the independence struggle. In the 1970s, the EPLF formed a transnational organization absorbing Eritrean exiles to mass organizations to aid them during the civil war. One third of Eritreans live in exile because of government coercion, intimidation, and manipulation of patriotism to maintain financial flows from the diaspora through a rehabilitation tax and by delegating welfare responsibilities to its citizens abroad. Over one million Eritreans live in the Arab states and in Europe, where they do not reside as a result of political asylum, but instead work for contracts to become permanent residents. About 150,000 Eritreans are located in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States as labor migrants, as the Arab countries support the ELF to fight against Ethiopia.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDemographics of Eritrea\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Kurdish political violence refers to politically motivated acts of violence committed by Kurds with the motive of achieving improved rights, self-determination, recognition, freedom of prisoners, autonomy, independence, or other goals. While Kurdish political violence mostly occurred in Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syria, it later spread internationally.\nKurdish groups that have been involved in politically motivated violence include the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), Kurdish Hezbollah, Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), Democratic Union Party (PYD), Kurdistan Free Life Party (PJAK), Kurdistan Freedom Party (PAK), KDPI, Komala, Khabat, Kurdistan Islamic Movement, Kurdistan Justice Group, AAIK, White Flags, and the Kurdistan Freedom Hawks. Many of these groups are designated terrorist groups in many countries.\n\n\n== Previous revolts ==\nThe first modern politically motivated Kurdish nationalist rebellion was led by Sheikh Ubeydullah, who was unsatisfied with the division of Kurds between the Ottoman Empire and Qajar dynasty, leading him to mobilise insurgents and rebel from 1879 to 1881 for an independent Kurdish state which he himself would rule, free from any interference from Ottomans or Qajars.\nIn May 1919, Mahmud Barzanji led a revolt against Iraqi authorities in the newly created British Mesopotamia and later the British Mandate in Iraq. Barzanji was imprisoned and eventually exiled to India for a one-year period in 1919. When returning, he was appointed a governor, but revolted again and declared an independent Kingdom of Kurdistan. The Kingdom of Kurdistan lasted from September 1922 until July 1924 before being recaptured by the British for Iraq.\nIn summer 1918, Simko Shikak had established rule over Kurdish regions west of Lake Urmia. In 1919, he mobilised an army of 20,000 Kurds and managed to achieve a self-governed area in northwestern Iran, centered in the city of Urmia. His forces had been reinforced with several hundred soldiers and mercenaries, including Kurdish nationalists from the Ottoman Empire who left the Ottoman army. Kurdish insurgents led by Simko Shekak massacred thousands of Assyrian civilians. They captured many cities in a short period of time. After repetitive fails by Reza Shah to counter the Kurdish expansion, the government in Tehran attempted to reach an agreement with Simko on limited Kurdish autonomy. Simko had rapidly increased the size of his Kurdish army, which grew stronger. He continued to expand the areas of western Iran under his control. By 1922, the cities of Baneh and Sardasht were under his administration. In 1922, the Iranian Army managed to push Simko and many of his soldiers out of Iran and recapture the land.\nIn March 1921, the Koçgiri tribe from the present-day eastern Sivas Province started a revolt against Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. The rebellion was initially Alevi, but it succeeded in uniting nearby Kurdish Sunni tribes. The revolt leaders were close with the Society for the Rise of Kurdistan (SAK). The rebellion was defeated in June 1921.\nCaused by frustration by the abolition of the caliphate and increasing Turkish nationalism, the first Kurdish rebellion in the modern Republic of Turkey was the Beytussebab rebellion. The revolt was led by Halid Beg Cibran of the Cibran tribe. Others who had a big role were Ihsan Nuri and Yusuf Ziya Bey. The rebellion began in August 1924, and ended in December 1924.\nA revolt led by Sheikh Said erupted in 1925 with support of the Azadî against the newly founded Turkish Republic. The rebellion dominated by Zaza Kurds, but also gained support among Kurmanji Kurds.\nIn 1927, the Kurds led by Ihsan Nuri revolted and created the Republic of Ararat, defending it for 3 years until losing it in 1931 to Turkish forces under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.\nIn 1937, a revolt led by Seyid Riza Riza erupted in Tunceli. The revolt led to the Dersim massacre. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan apologised for the massacre in November 2011.\nKurdish and Azerbaijani separatism in increased shortly after Second World War when the Soviet Union refused to give up occupied North Western Iranian territory. The Iran crisis of 1946 included a separatist revolt of KDP-I and communist groups to establish a Soviet puppet government, and declare the Republic of Mahabad. It happened alongside the Azerbaijan People's Government, another Soviet puppet state. The state itself encompassed a very small territory, including Mahabad and the adjacent cities, unable to incorporate southern Iranian Kurdistan, and unable to attract the tribes outside Mahabad itself to the nationalist cause led by Qazi Muhammad. When the Soviets withdrew from Iran in December 1946, government forces were able to enter Mahabad and recapture it.\nFollowing a hiatus after the defeat of Mahmud Barzanji, a series of revolts led by Mullah Mustafa Barzani against Iraq eventually erupted into a full war. It lasted from 1961 until 1970. Iraq deployed 80% of its army during the war. The war ended with the Autonomy Agreement, and between 75,000 to 105,000 casualties.\nIn 1966, Kurdish rebels led by KDPI and smaller Marxist factions revolted against Pahlavi Iran, although the revolt was aimed at federalising Iran and achieving Kurdish autonomy. The revolt was quelled in 1968.\nA second war broke out between Kurds and Iraqi forces in 1974, in which the Iraqi government finally controlled Iraqi Kurdistan after fifteen years, and, in order to prevent another revolt, started an Arabization program by moving Arabs to the vicinity of oil fields in northern Iraq, particularly the ones around Kirkuk. The Iraqi government convinced Iran to cease its support for Kurdish militants, and more failed Kurdish insurgencies broke out in 1975.\nIn 1983, the KDP, the PUK, and Islamist Kurds jointly revolted and captured major cities in Iraqi Kurdistan. This specific revolt led to the Anfal campaign, which led to bigger and more successful revolts.\nIn 1978, the PKK was formed and the Kurdistan Workers' Party insurgency began. The insurgency is ongoing, against the Republic of Turkey. The PKK began as a Marxist group aiming for Kurdish independence, although it later shifted to democratic confederalism, and, in accordance with democratic confederalism, abandoning independence and instead calling for autonomy and decentralisation.\nIn 1979, more Kurdish revolts broke out in Iran, although they were overshadowed by the Iran–Iraq War and did not achieve anything.\nDuring the 1991 Iraqi uprisings, Kurds successfully regained autonomy. The autonomous region was made official in 1992. The Iraqi government recognized the autonomy of the Kurdistan Region in 2005.\n\n\n== Political violence ==\nOn 22 October 1988, when Esat Oktay Yıldıran was on a bus with his wife and two children, he was shot dead by a gunman who screamed \"Laz Kemal sends his greetings\". The PKK boasted about the assassination and the killer escaped and was never caught.\nAlso in the 1980s, Islamist Kurds began attacking any establishment belonging to the Iraqi Ba'athist government following the declaration of war by Osman Abdulaziz. They captured significant land. Ali Bapir had also publicly executed his own brother for working with the Ba'athists.\nOn February 17, 1999, after the arrest of Abdullah Öcalan in Kenya by MİT with alleged help from the CIA and Mossad, a group of 55 to 200 PKK supporters armed with iron bars attempted to raid the Israeli consulate in Berlin. The protesters overpowered German police, and entered the consulate building, where Israeli security shot at them, killing 3 and injuring 14. German police arrested 30 PKK supporters and blocked off all access to the area as helicopters began circling over the consulate building. In many other European countries, PKK protestors attacked Greek, Kenyan and Turkish diplomatic missions.  In Istanbul, PKK protesters torched vehicles and threw a petrol bomb at a bus belonging to Bülent Ecevit's DSP. PKK protestors seized Greek diplomatic missions in Australia, Italy, Netherlands, France, Russia, Austria, UK, US, and Canada. Hundreds of Kurds were arrested in Greece due to violent protests. They looted the National Bank of Greece in Montreal, and attacked the Turkish embassy in Ottawa, hurling rocks and ice at the building, smashing several windows, and injuring 9 Canadian policemen in the process. The US took extensive measures to protect Greek, Kenyan, and Turkish diplomats.\nOn January 24, 2001, the Kurdish Hezbollah ambushed and killed 6 Turkish police officers, including the chief, Gaffar Okkan, as possible revenge for the killing of Hüseyin Velioğlu.\nDuring the 2004 Qamishli riots, which originated from a football match that escalated into a riot, a wave of violence hit northeastern Syria. Provoked by the Arab supporters of the rival team, the Kurds began attacking the Arabs, and eventually pushed Syrian authorities out of the city briefly, although they returned with tanks and helicopters and reclaimed the city. 30 people died and 160 were wounded. Mashouq al-Khaznawi became active as a result of this incident, and his torture and death was part of many events which sparked more Kurdish political violence that led to the establishment of the AANES during the Syrian civil war.\nAlso in 2004, the newly founded PJAK began an intermittent armed struggle against the Iranian regime, seeking self-determination through some degree of autonomy for Kurds in Iran. The clashes further intensified in 2016 before calming down.\nIn late 2017, following the Iraqi recapture of Kirkuk, a group known as the White Flags began a wave of violence against civilians, politicians, Iraqi authorities, and PMF militias, and terrorised much of the disputed territories of northern Iraq for months, referring to themself as the \"Kurdish resistance\". The violence continued until 2018 when Iraq provided further security in the region and relations with the KRG eased. The Peshmerga claimed that they had nothing to do with the White Flags. The White Flags ambushed Iraqi soldiers and PMF militants, utilised IEDs, and used mortars and rockets. They also attacked oil wells and main roads, and committed arson on the houses of many politicians, people from certain political factions, and people who they accused of supporting the Iraqi recapture of Kirkuk.\nOn Newroz 2023, Kurdish nationalists who were angered by the presence of Turkish leftists and the LGBT community at Newroz festivals in Diyarbakır began attacking and beating the leftists and LGBT community and were even armed with knives and chased them out.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nOlson, Robert W.

Mount Banoy is 960 meters above sea level, or 799 meters above the surrounding terrain. Its foothills are about 23.6 kilometers wide.\n\n\n== Details ==\nThe mountain is located between the boundary of Batangas City, and Lobo. It is one of the mountains in Lobo along with Mount Lobo (Mt. Bangkalan and Nagpatong Peak), Mt. Naguiling, Mt. Daguldol, and Mount Tibig. It also played a major role on giving Lobo its name. Some people believed that the municipality got its name from a lobo (balloon) that flied into Mt. Banoy while Batangas City was celebrating their fiesta.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "William Jefferson Martin (September 28, 1861 – June 30, 1941) was an American businessman and politician. A member of the Republican Party, he served in the California State Assembly from the 48th district between 1917 and 1921. He also served as the postmaster of Salinas, California, between 1920 and 1933.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nWilliam Jefferson Martin was born on September 28, 1861, in Monterey, California. He was the second of six children born to Daniel C. Martin, a Great Plains native who moved to California during the Gold Rush, and Jane Nestor, an Irishwoman.\n\n\n== Business career ==\nMartin became employed at the Western Union Telegraph Company at the age of 14. He served as the company's manager until he retired to become the business manager of The Morning Call in 1898.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nFor the 1916 election for California's 48th State Assembly district, Martin received the nominations of the Republican, Democratic, and Progressive parties. In response, Martin stated that although he did not wish to hold office, he would \"do [his] best to get elected.\" Martin was unopposed in the general election. He was re-elected in 1918 and ran unopposed in both elections.\nOn one of his first days in office, Martin introduced two bills, one that would adopt mandatory military training in California and another that would require the flag of the United States to fly over school buildings in California. In 1919, Martin introduced resolutions urging the United States government to support an establishment of the League of Nations. Later during the year, a bill of his that would extend the boundaries of Monterey was signed into law by governor William Stephens.\nWhile serving in the Assembly, Martin was nominated by Woodrow Wilson to become the postmaster of Salinas, California. At the request of James Farley, the United States Postmaster General, Martin resigned in 1933.\n\n\n== Personal life and death ==\nMartin first married Mary Hamilton. Hamilton was the sister of Olive Steinbeck, the mother of American author John Steinbeck. She died in 1915. Martin's second and last marriage was to Bertha Marten. They had two children together, William and Mildred; the former was born on September 5, 1921, in Salinas. Marten died in 1936.\nOn June 30, 1941, Martin died at his home in Salinas. His funeral was held three days later on July 3.\n\n\n== References ==",

The play is semi-autobiographical and based on Behrman's memoirs originally published in The New Yorker and his book The Worcester Account that was published in 1954.\n\n\n== Production history ==\nThe play had an out of town tryout at the Locust Theatre in Philadelphia. The play then opened on Broadway at the Morosco Theatre on December 8, 1958, and closed on March 21, 1959, running a total of 120 performances. The play was directed by Harold Clurman. For her performance, Maureen Stapleton was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play.\nThe New York Times said in their review \"If there was a little more time at the moment, it would be possible to express gratitude to all the actors and everyone else concerned, they deserve it. The Cold Wind And The Warm is a cameo carefully designed and executed by expert craftsman.\"\n\n\n== Original cast and characters ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n​The Cold Wind And The Warm​ at the Internet Broadway Database",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Yilbung (c.1815 – 6 November 1846), also known as Millbong Jemmy, was an Indigenous Australian of the Turrbal people who was a major figure in resisting British colonisation during the 1840s around what is now the city of Brisbane.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nLittle is know of Yilbung's early years. He was probably born around the year 1815 and it is unclear which specific Aboriginal group he belonged to, although it is regarded he was most closely associated with the Turrbal people. He later formed strong kinship bonds with both the Nunukul people of Stradbroke Island and the Undanbi of Pumicestone Passage.\nHis name of Millbong or Yilbung is a reference to the fact that he had only one functional eye, the other suffering a destructive burn injury when he was a child. In multiple Aboriginal dialects mil or yil means eye, with bung or bong meaning broken or dead.\n\n\n== Involvement in colonial resistance ==\nAccording to the local colonial press, Yilbung began violent resistance to British colonisation of his lands while still a teenager. In 1832, he was allegedly part of a group of Aboriginal men who attacked and severely injured two members of a boat crew near the Moreton Bay penal settlement but further evidence for this is scant. \nClearer documentation shows that he later became involved with the Zion Hill Mission established by German missionaries at Nundah in 1838. He was initially enthusiastic on knowing the ways of the Europeans, learning Biblical passages presumably in both English and German. However, he soon obtained a reputation for theft both at the mission and at the nearby newly opened up British settlement of Brisbane.\nAround 1840 Yilbung committed several robberies upon the The Old Windmill, stealing bags of cornmeal. Eventually, the acting senior constable of Brisbane, Constable Thompson, was called to the mill to arrest Yilbung. In the struggle to capture him, Yilbung attempted to stab the policeman with an old knife. Thompson disabled him by hitting him on the shins with his baton and he was then tightly handcuffed and tied up with rope. A dozen British soldiers were then called to the mill, who marched Yilbung off to the gaol on what is now Queen Street. He was sentenced to 25 or 50 lashes which he received while being tied to the triangles. He was released a day later.\nIn March 1842, Yilbung robbed the German mission of its supplies of corn, sugar and rice and feasted on this for several days with his band of followers. Later that month, he brought news to the mission of the deliberate mass poisonings of Aboriginal Australians at Mount Kilcoy which killed around 40 people. Possibly as a result of this mass killing, he became increasingly recalcitrant towards the Europeans. He openly mocked and intimidated the missionaries, challenging one of them to a fight. Finally in 1843, he and followers abandoned the missionaries altogether and became associated with the local Indigenous people who were living a more traditional lifestyle in the bush, often in conflict with the colonists.\n\n\n== The Gregor killings of 1846 ==\nAs the British expanded out of Brisbane in the 1840s, various colonists took up land to the north of the settlement in traditional Undanbi country. One of these was Andrew Gregor who established the Forgie pastoral station around Upper Caboolture. In October 1846, around thirty or so Aboriginal men attacked the Forgie run, killing Andrew Gregor and his pregnant servant Mary Shannon. They afterwards ransacked the property. Child witnesses implicated Yilbung and several other Aboriginal men as being involved in the raid. \nOfficial and unofficial rewards of £10 to £25 were promised to those who would 'bring justice' upon the accused. In early November, Yilbung was spotted amongst a group of Aboriginal people near Breakfast Creek. Armed settlers chased the group who fled across the Brisbane River into the safety of the scrubland at Bulimba Creek.\n\n\n== Death ==\nOn 6 November 1846, three sawyers cutting timber in the Bulimba Creek vicinity lured Yilbung to their camp. In the struggle to seize him, Yilbung was shot in the head by one of the sawyers, Richard Bickerton. Finding him still alive, they shot Yilbung twice more, which also failed to kill him. The sawyers then threw Yilbung in a cart to transport him into Brisbane. Yilbung died around two hours later while being transported to the settlement. \nSoon after Yilbung's corpse was brought to Brisbane, police magistrate John Clements Wickham announced that his death was 'justifiable homicide' and Bickerton received a £10 reward for killing Yilbung. Yilbung's body remained with the authorities and was taken to the hospital where his head was removed and boiled down to remove the flesh. A cast was then made of his skull.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Indigenous Australian historical figures\nDundalli\n\n\n== References ==",

Its highest peak, Petrov crast, stands at 1205.6 meters. The mountain is surrounded by the Nišava River to the north and Mala Mountain to the east, with Dragoman marsh and Ponor Mountain to the south. The Dragoman–Godech road demarcates it from the west.\nClose to the town of Dragoman, it is also near the Kalotina–Dimitrovgrad border checkpoint, linking Bulgaria with Serbia via the international road E80 and a railway line.\n\n\n== Flora ==\nIn 2014, a study identified 344 species of medicinal plants, which belong to 237 genera and 83 families.\n\n\n== Archaeology ==\nA Thracian sanctuary dedicated to the worship either Sabazios, the Thracian horseman, or possibly both, was located on Mount Chepan. An altar dating back to the early decades of the 3rd century AD was discovered in this sanctuary. Presently, it is on display at the Archaeological Institute and Museum in Sofia.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Hurvat sumakah, is an archaeological site with ruins of one of the three largest Jewish settlements south of Mount Carmel, during the Roman and Byzantine periods. It is part of the Mount Carmel National Park, south of Daliyat al-Karmel, at an altitude of 350 meters above sea level.\nRemains of a synagogue, residences, workshops and agricultural facilities and rock-cut tombs were found near the ruins, including one with the Seven Branched Menorah. The origin of the name may be from the Tanner's Sumach, which is called sumac in Arabic. Visiting the site is limited, because it is on the edge of the IDF's fire zone.\n\n\n== History ==\nRemains from the Roman and Byzantine periods (2nd - 7th centuries AD), and a few remains from the Crusader and Mamluk periods were found on the site. The place was abandoned after the Mamluk period.\nThe ancient site covers an area of 25 dunams. It was already discovered in the 19th century by researchers, including Lawrence Oliphant who lived in nearby Daliyat al-Karmel. A limited excavation was conducted at the site by Heinrich Kohl and Carl Wetzinger, as part of their comprehensive study of synagogues in the Galilee (1905, 1907). However, some of the findings described in the initial surveys were not discovered later, since the site was used as a source for building materials for the nearby Arab settlement Umm al-Zinat (today in the Eliakim area). Remains from the Roman and Byzantine periods (2nd - 7th centuries AD), and a few remains from the Crusader and Mamluk periods were found on the site. The place was abandoned after the Mamluk period.\n\n\n== Synagogue ==\nThe synagogue was located as a basilica-shaped structure, which includes an entrance hall in the east, three openings and a gathering hall. Notched columns and other architectural remains were found at the site. The size of the synagogue building: 19 meters by 15 meters. In the excavations conducted at the site in 1905, a synagogue doorframe was found, on which there is a relief depicting two lions facing each other.\nAccording to the reconstruction, the initial building was destroyed during the 4th century during an unknown event (possibly the Samaritan revolt that happened at that time). After that, the synagogue was rebuilt, until it was abandoned during the 7th century.\n\n\n== Notched pillars ==\nA large number (several dozen) of long and notched stone pillars are found on the site. Columns of this type were not found anywhere else, except in the Umm Daraj ruin (about 2 km to the south), where several such columns were also found), but today the use made of the columns is unknown, and this is considered a mystery. Several columns of this type were used to restore the synagogue after its first destruction.\n\n\n== Rock-cut tombs ==\n\nRock-cut tombs were found on the site. The most impressive of them is called the \"Cave of the Lamps\" after the Temple Menorah was found engraved on both sides of the entrance arch. Another cave found on the site, known as the \"Cave of the Bull and the Lion\" due to the relief of animals, probably a bull and a lion, in the cave's lintel.\n\n\n== Agriculture ==\n\nTo the north of the synagogue, a large oil press was uncovered, which includes vertical rock pillars that were used to fix the beam of the oil press. Between the columns is a juicing surface as well as of two huge weights - each with an approximate weight of a ton. Oil storage basins and a plastered pools were also found.\nThere are no springs in the area near the site, and the supply of drinking water and irrigation was based on cisterns. To the east of the oil press, remains of spacious residential buildings were found, each with a cistern. In addition, a central water reservoir, which is still used by shepherds, is in the center of the site. In the opening of the pit, there are notched marks of a rope, indicating its use in the past.\nNear the site, 200 meters northwest of its center of the site, is an area of winepresses that is one of the largest uncovered in Israel. The system includes rock surfaces on which the grapes were trodden, hewn basins for sedimentation and filter openings through which the juice passed into a large storage pool, with a volume of 10 Cubic metre. Near the winepress is a pit, which was used as a winery.\n\n\n== Industrial buildings ==\nBesides ancient agricultural remains: oil press and huts, facilities that may be industrial were also found there. Zohar Amar's proposal is that there was a tannery industry here alongside a textile dyeing industry, which was based on local plants as raw materials, such as the Tanner's Sumach.\nNorth-east of the synagogue is a building of a large workshop, with an area of 250 square meters, the floor is plastered and there are square ponds in it. Small water basins, like troughs, and round pillars with grooves running through them are also visible. Its juices are used for processing leather.It is possible that this workshop, and others like it scattered in the area, were also engaged in the production of dyes such as yellow dye from local flowers. Another industrial facility in the vicinity is a square reservoir, measuring 4 meters by 4 meters and 3 meters deep. In the corner of the pool is a basin for sedimentation and in its ceiling an opening for pumping. Today, it is used by shepherds.\n\n\n== Salamandra ==\nDuring the rainy days, the pits are filled with water and animals can be found in them. One of them is one of the well-known tailed amphibians in Israel: in Carmel and the Galilee. In addition, there is the orange salamander: black, lizard-like, with yellow dots on it. During the summer it is hidden because it needs moisture. In the winter, the salamander goes to the water pools where it spawns and returns to land again. The phenomenon according to which she disappears and returns with children, led to the fact that the Druze from the surrounding area mistake her for the natives of thunder and lightning. They call the offsprings \"Kalb-el-Moya\" - the water dogs, and the salamander \"Abu Raflin\" - the father of the puddles. After all, she appears suddenly in puddles. The salamander is a protected animal and hunting is prohibited.\n\n\n== References ==",

The club's most notable achievement as a junior club was twice reaching the final of the Perthshire Consolation Cup for clubs eliminated from the Perthshire Cup before the final.  In 1906–07 (the club's first season in both competitions) it lost to Tulloch 2–0 in a replay, after drawing the original final at Crieff – a plan to play extra-time was scuppered by the Allanvale side needing to catch trains back to Blackford.  It also lost 2–1 to Stanley in the final in 1909–10, played at Perth, having taken the lead after M'Feat scored from a corner, but conceded twice in the second half.\nThe club played twice in the Scottish Qualifying Cup, losing 6–1 to Crieff Morrisonians in the first round in 1911–12, and 3–2 at home to Huntingtower in the first round in 1912–13.  The club also entered the West Perthshire League in 1911–12, but the competition was never finished - fortunately for Allanvale as it had lost all of its four matches.\nThe club appears to have ceased operations before the First World War, resigning its Scottish FA membership in August 1913, but the name continued as a juvenile football club in the 1920s, winning the Crieff and District Juvenile Cup in 1921.\n\n\n=== Colours ===\nThe club wore green jerseys.\n\n\n=== Ground ===\nThe club played on a public park in Blackford.\n\n\n== Annan F.C. (1896) ==\n\n\n=== History ===\n\nAnnan F.C. was an association football club from Annan, Dumfries and Galloway, active in the late 19th century.  It was the second club of that name, and was founded in the wake of the dissolving of the previous Annan, under the name Rose of Annan F.C., as a junior club.  Its earliest recorded match is a 10–0 victory over the 34th Regiment of Carlisle in November 1896.\nIn 1898, the club changed its name to Annan and joined the Scottish Football Association, and also had the advantage of gaining some players from rival junior club Border Annan which had \"gone to the wall\".  The club entered the Scottish Qualifying Cup for the first time that season, and beat Nithsdale of Dumfries in the first round, but lost at home to Wigtown in the second.  The club also entered the Southern Counties Cup for the first time, losing 7–3 at home to Newton Stewart Athletic in the semi-final.\nThe club was further strengthened in 1899 by the collapse of Carlisle City AFC, and recruited Young, Burgess, Russell, and Graham from the defunct English side,  and caused something of a shock in the Qualifying Cup, beating Dumfries Hibernians 3–0 in the first round, contrary to all expectations; the club lost at Dumfries in the second, putting up a strong fight before the home side's superior fitness told. Hibs gained revenge with a 5–0 win in the second round of the County competition.\nWith a second club in the town (Annan United) having ambitions on seniority, Annan was humiliated 12–1 by Douglas Wanderers in the first round of the 1900–01 Qualifying Cup, albeit it did beat Thornhill in the Southern Counties, enough to put the club in the semi-final.  In the last four Annan again conceded seven, but this time scoring four, in its tie against the 6th Galloway Volunteer side.\nAnnan's position in the local district was put into perspective by its appearances in the Dumfries & Galloway Cup – it lost every tie it played in its three entries from 1898 to 1900.  The club did not play football in the 1901–02 season and was struck from the Scottish FA roll of members in August 1902.\n\n\n=== Colours ===\nThe club originally wore light blue jerseys, changing in 1902 to crimson and primrose.\n\n\n=== Ground ===\nThe club originally played at Caledonian Park.  The club planned to move to Seaforth Park in 1899, but instead moved to Mill Park.\n\n\n== Annan United F.C. ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nThe club, from Annan, Dumfriesshire, was founded in 1896 as a junior side, with matches reported from 1897.\nUnited soon became one of the strongest junior sides in the area, winning its first 8 matches of the 1899–1900 season,  The club successfully applied to join the Scottish Football Association in June 1901, which meant it could play in the three senior competitions open to it - the Scottish Qualifying Cup, Southern Counties Cup, and Dumfries & Galloway Cup – for the first time in 1901–02.\nUnited played in each competition for three seasons, but only won four ties - two in the 1902–03 Dumfries & Galloway Cup, and one each in the other competitions.  Its biggest win was 5–1 against Barholm Rovers in the first round of the 1901–02 Qualifying Cup.\nThe club's last appearance in senior football was in the Qualifying Cup draw for 1904–05; United \"failed to get up a team\" for its tie with Thornhill and, not having played all season, the club was struck from the Scottish FA roll in August 1905.\n\n\n=== Colours ===\nThe club played in black and white.\n\n\n=== Ground ===\nUnited's ground was Caledonian Park, the former home of Annan F.C. (1896).\n\n\n== Benburb F.C. (Loanhead) ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nThe club was founded in Loanhead, Midlothian, in 1896.  Its first recorded match was a 3–1 defeat at home to Bonnyrigg Rose.  The club's name and colours show that it was founded in the interests of Irish diaspora workers, but the club did not have an exclusionary policy of selection - many of its players had \"Scots\" names such as Torrance, Cunningham, Gordon, and Porteous.\nBenburb joined the Scottish Football Association in August 1896.  It entered four senior competitions that season, namely the Scottish Qualifying Cup, East of Scotland Shield, King Cup, and Midlothian League.  The Bens lost in the first round in each knockout tournament; lost 7–0 to Cowdenbeath in the Qualifying, and 4–1 and 6–0 to Penicuik Athletic in the Shield and King Cup respectively.\nBenburb was at least a little unfortunate that the Qualifying Cup tie clashed with a home game for the established Loanhead side Polton Vale, so the Benburb committee accepted an offer of half of the gate, plus 15 rail fares, to switch the match to Cowdenbeath.  One early note of concern was that, even without the Vale playing in opposition, Benburb could only attract a meagre crowd for its Shield tie; Benburb's Edward Green received his marching orders in the tie, along with Athletic's Alexander White, for fighting.\nBenburb however did win twice in the Shield's Consolation Cup, thereby reaching the semi-final, although again its tie with Trinity had a disappointing attendance; but lost again to Penicuik at that stage.\nThese two victories were the club's only wins in competitive football.  It lost all of its four games in the Midlothian League, only scoring one goal.\nAlthough Benburb renewed its memberships for 1897–98, it scratched from the Qualifying Cup and East of Scotland Shield, and did not enter the King Cup.  After a season without playing it was struck from the relevant membership rolls.\n\n\n=== Colours ===\nThe club wore green shirts and blue knickers.\n\n\n=== Ground ===\nThe club's ground was the former Polton Vale ground at Ramsay Square; under Benburb's tenancy, it was simply known as the Benburb Football Park.\n\n\n== Berwick United F.C. ==\n\n\n=== History ===\n\nSimilarly to Berwick Rangers, Berwick United was an association football team from Berwick-upon-Tweed, in England, but which played its football in Scotland.  The club was founded in 1919, at a time when it was uncertain if Rangers would re-start after the First World War;  A. A. Crisp, who was a player with the Thursday Rangers side, which in turn had lost players to the new Spittal Hearts side, proposed at a meeting of \"those interested\" that the Berwick Rangers assets (mostly cash in the bank) be handed over to the Hearts, with a view to amalgamating the Berwick sides as a new Berwick United club.  It was eventually decided that the Berwick Comrades club should take over the assets and the Rangers name, so Crisp and the Spittal Hearts resolved to turn senior as Berwick United.\nThe club duly joined the Scottish Football Association in August 1919, and it warmed up for its first competitive tie (in the East of Scotland Shield qualifying cup) with a 3–0 win over the K.O.S.B.  The club duly won 2–1 at Coldstream in the Shield tie, two goals from Fenby turning the tie around, but its debut in the Scottish Qualifying Cup at Vale of Leithen showed the gap to close, United missing a penalty when 1–0 down, and ultimately going down 5–0.  Before September was out, the club was also eliminated from the Shield, thanks to missing two penalties in a 2–1 home defeat to Gala Fairydean.\nColdstream gained a revenge in the first round of the King Cup with a 2–1 home win, United twice hitting the woodwork, and the key goal scored after goalkeeper Weatherburn dropped a shot at the feet of Melrose.\nThe first meeting between United and Berwick Rangers took place at Shielfield Park just before Christmas, in the Border League, and United won 5–1.  However, with Rangers bottom of the League and United with a mediocre record, the tide turned towards an amalgamation of the two sides.  The clubs were drawn together in the first round of the Border Cup and drew 3–3 at Union Park; United won the replay 1–0.  A win over Coldstream put United in the final, against Peebles Rovers at Innerleithen, in front of 1,100 spectators, and Purves gave United the lead with a volley from the right wing.  However luck went against United in the second half, an injury to Abbot in the United goal - who was having a \"great\" game - interrupting the club's rhythm, Purves hitting the bar with a cross-shot, and Rovers equalised in the 76th minute, winning the game thanks to a penalty six minutes later after Johnston \"fell on the ball with his arm\".\nThe club was at least prominent enough to attract Newcastle United to a friendly towards the end of the season (albeit Berwick went down 9–1), but it suffered a blow when centre-forward Maxwell - awarded the Military Medal during the season, for escaping a prisoner of war camp in 1914 - was signed up by Hibernian.\nHowever the club suffered a more serious blow in July, when Berwick Rangers announced it had secured Union Park for the following season, and the United players and committee therefore threw in their lot with Rangers, United being struck off the Scottish FA roll in August 1920.\n\n\n=== Colours ===\nThe club played in blue, with a white change shirt.\n\n\n=== Ground ===\nUnited played at Union Park, let to the club by Jack Robertson of Mill Farm, Tweedmouth.\n\n\n== Bon Accord F.C. (1890) ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nThe Aberdeen club was founded in September 1890 as Junior Bon-Accord. As the name suggests it was a Junior club, unrelated to the senior.  Its greatest honour as a junior club was winning the Figaro Cup (for junior and senior reserve clubs) two years in succession (1893–94 and 1894–95).\nIn 1903, the club joined the Scottish Football Association, at the same time as the three existing senior clubs in Aberdeen (Aberdeen (1881), Victoria United, and Orion), merged as Aberdeen F.C.  Unlike Aberdeen, the Bon Accord senior side was mostly amateur.  The club however had recruited six of the former Victoria United players and it had apparently won over the Victoria support, with fans shouting \"Play up Vics!\" at early matches.\nThe club was lucky with a bye in the first round of the Scottish Qualifying Cup, and its first senior match was a 2–1 win over  Lochgelly United – who had also received a bye - on the date the other fixtures took place.  The Bons lost 5–1 to Aberdeen in the second round, Aberdeen not getting out of second gear.  After the match the club lost left-back William Brabner to Aberdeen via transfer, and another player, James Robertson, approached Aberdeen after the match seeking one for himself; Bon Accord complained that Aberdeen had set up an \"A\" side for the sole purpose of denuding the club of its players, but the Scottish FA ordered the transfer, as the Bons had promised him a free should another club be interested.\nThe Bons had the chance of revenge in the final of the Aberdeenshire Cup, which it had entered for the first time, and beat Aberdeen University and Peterhead in its two preceding ties.  2,000 people turned out at Pittodrie for the final, but Aberdeen dominated the first half, gaining a 2–0 lead; Ferries pulled a goal back, but M'Bean in goal rushed out to clear a long ball and missed his kick entirely, M'Aulay putting the Bons 3–1 down.  Milne scored a consolation near the end.\nThe club only lasted a single season as a senior club, being struck from the Scottish FA roll (albeit to some surprise) in August 1904 as having \"come to the conclusion that it is no use trying to fight the combine.\"  It continued playing over the next couple of seasons, its last recorded match being a defeat at Aberdeen \"A\" in the first round of the Aberdeen & District Cup in 1905–06.\n\n\n=== Colours ===\nThe club wore blue jerseys.  For its final matches the club changed to black and white.\n\n\n=== Ground ===\nThe club originally played at the Links, but as a senior club its ground was Central Park, also the ground of Aberdeen.\n\n\n== Broxburn St John's F.C. ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nThe club had its origins in a Juvenile church side, founded in 1921, and affiliated to St John's Cantius Roman Catholic church in Broxburn.  The club morphed into the Broxburn St John's C.Y.M.S. and won the first Scottish C.Y.M.S. Cup in 1932, beating Blantyre St Joseph's 1–0 on the ground of Parkhead Juniors thanks to a winner by Taylor in the 65th minute.\nThe club turned senior by joining the Scottish Football Association before the 1933–34 season, its first match as a senior club being an 8–4 defeat at Rosyth Recreation in the Edinburgh & District League.  It entered the Scottish Qualifying Cup for the only time, getting a bye into the second round, and walked over Edinburgh University in the second; the club lost 7–1 at home to Vale of Leithen in the third after keeping the game tight in the first half but falling apart in the second, and the Vale gained entry to the Scottish Cup proper as a result of the win.\n1933–34 was the club's only senior season.  It finished fourth from bottom of the Edinburgh & District League, with 4 wins from 17 matches, and reached the semi-finals of the King Cup.  In the first round, goals from Boyle, Armit, and Byrne getting the team from 2–0 down in the first round against Selkirk to win 3–2, and the club walked over Chirnside United which was unable to travel to a second replay at Selkirk; St John's lost 3–0 at eventual winners Clerwood Amateurs in the last four, Clerwood winning the toss being crucial, as St John's had to play into a strong wind in the first half and tired out too much to fight back in the second.\nThe club continued into 1934–35, but its only competitive football was a first round replay defeat in the East of Scotland Shield qualifying competition to Coldstream, the club having joined the association too late the previous year to play in the competition.  Broxburn should have had home advantage for the original tie, but switched it to Coldstream, and came away with a 5–5 draw, but making the journey twice was too much for the side.\n\n\n=== Colours ===\nThe club's first choice colours as a senior club were green, with a change strip of blue.\n\n\n=== Ground ===\nThe club played at Broxburn's Sports Park; season tickets for 1933–34 cost 5 shillings, reduced to 1s for boys between 14 and 16, and 6d for those below.\n\n\n== Carron Amateurs F.C. ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nThe Stenhousemuir club was founded out of a cricket club, the Pate brothers being prominent in both sides.  The first references to it playing football are from the 1904–05 season.\nThe club joined the Scottish Amateur Football League for the 1905–06 season, and the Scottish Football Association in May 1906, which entitled the club to play in the Scottish Qualifying Cup and the Stirlingshire Cup in 1906–07.\nThe club's first season as a senior club saw heavy defeats in its first round fixtures; in 1906–07, it lost 6–0 to East Stirlingshire in the Qualifying and  5–0 to King's Park in the Stirlingshire, albeit the \"swanky, go-ahead\" Amateurs were handicapped by an injury to the goalkeeper after half-an-hour of the latter match, with the game still scoreless.  In 1907–08, Carron only lost 2–1 to Clackmannan in the Qualifying, even taking the lead through a long shot from Shearer, and the Clacks needed an 88th-minute penalty to win the game.  However the club scratched from the Stirlingshire.\nIts Amateur League campaigns were not much more successful, its debut season being one of mid-table mediocrity, but finishing in the bottom three (of ten clubs) in 1907–08.\nThe Amateurs gave up on football after the 1907–08 season, resigning from the Amateur League and, not having a private ground, not seeking to retain its Scottish FA membership, although it continued to play cricket.  The name was later used by the Carron Works Recreation Club company side.\n\n\n=== Colours ===\nThe club wore maroon and gold.\n\n\n=== Ground ===\nThe club played at Ochilview, relying on Stenhousemuir F.C. not having a home fixture in order to play home games.\n\n\n== Clydebank F.C. (1899) ==\n\n\n=== History ===\n\nThe third senior club with the name Clydebank, but the second from Clydebank itself, was founded in 1899.  The ambition of the club was demonstrated by it inviting Dumbarton and Rangers to be the club's first opponents in August that year; the Bankers surprisingly beat Dumbarton 3–1 in the club's first-ever match.\nThe club's promising start continued as it held neighbours Vale of Leven to a draw in the first round of the 1899–1900 Scottish Qualifying Cup, although it lost in the replay.  Clydebank's protest that the Vale's colours were too similar to Clydebank's, which, combined with the \"laziness\" of the referee, led to a \"grand fiasco\", was dismissed, with the Scottish FA retaining the deposit; the referee explaining that the Vale had changed to light blue jerseys and white pants, which contrasted nicely with Clydebank's all dark blue.\nIt was also one of the four entrants to the Dumbartonshire Cup that season, played to a league format, and remarkably all four clubs finished with 6 points from 6 games, all from 2 wins, draws, and defeats each.  Unfortunately for the club the biggest score in the competition was its 7–1 defeat at the Vale - the club's final fixture in the competition, when even a draw would have guaranteed it a place in the final - and the club's goal average meant it finished bottom.\nAlmost as soon as the club had started however it had run out of money.  It lost the use of Hamilton Park to the Scottish Junior Football Association side Yoker Athletic at the end of the season, and scratched to Linthouse (also moribund) in the 1900–01 Qualifying Cup, the withdrawal being evidence of its \"retiral from warfare\".  Someone had evidently paid the small subscription to the Scottish Football Association for the 1901–02 season however as it made one more entry to the Qualifying Cup, presumably in the hope of an attractive tie, but when matched with the Cameronians military side - a side guaranteed not to bring significant support - the club withdrew once more.\n\n\n=== Colours ===\nThe club wore dark blue.\n\n\n=== Ground ===\nThe club played at Hamilton Park, as the previous Clydebank had done.\n\n\n=== Notable player ===\nMalcolm McVean, formerly of Liverpool and Burnley, who joined the club after its first two matches\n\n\n== Clydebank United F.C. ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nA Junior club called Clydebank United was founded in the 1886–87 season, but there is little record of the club before 1894.  In August 1895, United, aiming to become a senior club, took over the remnants of Dalmuir Thistle; Dumbarton agreed to play in the new club's first fixture.  The club joined the Scottish Football Association in October 1895, too late to enter the Scottish Qualifying Cup that season, but the club did enter the Dumbartonshire Cup, losing 3–1 to Helensburgh Union in its only tie.\nOminously, for its first competitive match, United could not raise a full-strength side; the match proved to be the club's only competitive match.  United did enter the Qualifying Cup in 1896–97, but scratched when drawn to face Vale of Leven in the first round, leaving the Vale to play a friendly with Arthurlie instead.  The next news of United was its being struck off at the season's end for non-payment of subscription.\n\n\n=== Colours ===\nThe club wore blue shirts and white knickers.\n\n\n=== Ground ===\nThe club played at the Castle Grounds, notable for having a hedge and tree along its touchlines. It was previously the home of Dalmuir Thistle.\n\n\n== Comrie F.C. ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nThe first reference to the club,from the village of Comrie, Perth and Kinross, in is in its entry to the Perthshire Cup in 1885–86; it entered the competition as a junior club intermittently until 1895, usually losing its first match each season heavily.\nDespite this, in 1895 the club joined the Scottish Football Association, and entered the Scottish Qualifying Cup for 1895–96, bolstered by a number of new arrivals from Glasgow who nearly brought off a shock, holding Dunblane to a one-goal victory in the Perthshire Cup.  Comrie only lasted one season as a senior club, scratching to Fair City Athletic in the first round of the Qualifying Cup, and not renewing its Scottish FA subscription in 1896.  This may also have been influenced by a protest from Dunblane after a Perthshire Cup tie that Gowanlea was a public park, rather than a private ground, and therefore against Scottish FA regulations - Dunblane's particular complaint was that the \"passing the hat around\" resulted in no proper accounting for its share of the gate.\nIndeed, Comrie also left the Perthshire FA at this time, only re-joining in 1898.  The only success the club had was reaching the semi-final of the Perthshire Cup in 1912–13, and that was only after quarter-final opponent St Johnstone scratched, having been one goal up in the original tie when it was called off due to darkness.  In the semi-final Comrie lost 3–1 at Breadalbane in a replay, after throwing away a 2–0 lead at home, albeit Breadalbane had to play the first half with 10 men after centre-forward Dakers' transport to Comrie broke down.\nThe club continued after the First World War, but never entered the Perthshire Cup again; in 1923 the club started a second XI on the basis that local players had been squeezed out by \"imported\" players.  However within a couple of years the club seems to have petered out, with Comrie Rovers taking over as the town's representative club.\n\n\n=== Colours ===\nThe club played in blue and white.\n\n\n=== Ground ===\nThe club originally played at Gowanlea to the south of the village, in Dalginross.   From 1898 it played at Station Park.\n\n\n=== Nickname ===\nThe club's nickname of the Earthquakers derives from the village's distinction of being the most earthquake-affected habitation in Britain, with Earthquake House, a building for the study of earthquakes, being put up near the village in 1874.\n\n\n== Dunkeld & Birnam F.C. (1891) ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nThe Dunkeld, Perthshire club was founded as Dunkeld & Birnam United in 1891 (dropping the United by 1893) and was admitted to the Perthshire Football Association that September.  It entered the Perthshire Cup from 1891–92 to 1895–96, losing in the first round every time.\nDespite this lack of success, the club turned senior and entered the Scottish Qualifying Cup qualifying stages in 1895–96, but scratched to Rob Roy before playing.  By September 1896 the club had run out of money, unable to pay its liabilities, so it was wound up.  Its last game was its Qualifying Cup debut - a 4–2 defeat to Huntingtower.\n\n\n=== Colours ===\nThe club wore white shirts and blue knickers.\n\n\n=== Ground ===\nThe club played at the Recreation Grounds in Dunkeld.\n\n\n== East Benhar Rangers F.C. ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nThe club, from Fauldhouse in West Lothian, was formed in 1900 to provide senior football for the area, and signed up a number of former professional players for its first season.  At the time the village was part of Lanarkshire.\nThe club was admitted to the Scottish Football Association in October 1900, too late to enter the Scottish Qualifying Cup that season.  However its entry to the Lanarkshire Association in November 1900 was in time to play in the Lanarkshire Cup in 1900–01.\nThe club's first match was a 3–0 home defeat to Carfin Emmett in October 1900, but it gained its first win in its third match, 2–0 against Bathgate.  It was however unlucky with its Lanarkshire Cup draw, having to face Motherwell at Fir Park, and was beaten 11–2, the home side even having goals disallowed.\nThe Rangers' first, and only, Qualifying Cup tie was a home derby against Dykehead, spiced up by both sides recruiting from the same pool of talent, and the visitors won 4–2; Pat Slavin had moved from Benhar to Dykehead, proved the difference.  Another heavy defeat in the first round of the Lanarkshire - 9–1 at Carfin Emmett - seems to have convinced the club committee that senior football in the village was not feasible, and it disbanded in August 1902.\n\n\n=== Colours ===\nThe club played in light blue.\n\n\n=== Ground ===\nThe club's first match was played at Braehead Park.  For its third game it had secured a private ground known simply as the Sports Field.\n\n\n=== Notable players ===\nThe club's initial recruitment included:\n\nMartin Hughes, goalkeeper, from Middlesbrough\nThomas Cherry, wing-half, from Grimsby Town\nRobert Murray, centre-half, from Nottingham Forest\n\n\n== Glasgow Normal Athletic F.C. ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nA \"Normal Athletic\", playing at Keppochill, had been active from the 1880s until 1893 and was revived in 1900.  The club was for those teaching and studying at the Normal School for the Training of Teachers, set up in 1837.\nThe club promptly joined the Glasgow Association, entitling it to take part in the Scottish Qualifying Cup and Glasgow Cup in 1900–01; the club is not listed as having joined the Scottish Football Association separately.\nThe Students were naturally outgunned; it lost its only ties in the Qualifying Cup and Glasgow Cup from 1900–01 to 1902–03 and scratched from its first round tie in the Qualifying Cup in 1903–04, not bothering to try in the Glasgow.\nIt had more relevant competition in the Scottish Amateur Football League, of which it was a founder member in 1901.  In the League's first season, the Students were ranked second in the final table of six clubs, four points behind leaders Paisley Academical, although Ayr Parkhouse was one point behind with games in hand.  However, as the title required a play-off, the league section was left unfinished, and Paisley Academical went on to take the title.  The club however only played one more season in the League, resigning before the 1903–04 season.\nAlthough the club ceased operations as a regular side in 1904, being struck from Scottish FA membership in August, it did play at least one match afterwards, a 2–1 win at Kilmacolm in 1908.\n\n\n=== Colours ===\nThe club played in black and gold.\n\n\n=== Ground ===\nThe club's ground, Nithsdale Park, was between Pollokshields and Maxwell Park stations.\n\n\n== Glenarnott Athletic F.C. ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nThe first reference to the club is from 1897, losing 5–2 to Newton Stewart Athletic in the final of the Wigtownshire Cup; the club did not have to play a fixture before the final, Stranraer scratching to the club in the semi-final.  Glenarnott had taken a two-goal lead in the final, but that was with the benefit of a considerable wind, and in the second half Newton Stewart overwhelmed it.\nGlenarnott was also from the village of Newton Stewart, but despite that - and the club's second secretary S. C. Maxwell living in the same street as his Newton Stewart Athletic counterpart - the Scottish Football Association considered the club a Kirkcudbrightshire concern.\nThe club joined the Scottish FA in May 1897, and its first act under the SFA's auspices was to scratch from its first round tie in the Scottish Qualifying Cup against Tarff Rovers, which was one of the causative factors in the Scottish FA setting up a committee to find out why so many teams ceded ties before playing.  The club in fact did not play at all in the 1897–98 season, with it being bruited that the club had amalgamated with Newton Stewart Athletic.  Despite this, the club still entered the 1898–99 Qualifying Cup, but it was believed the entry had been falsified, and it was struck from the Scottish FA's roll in 1899.\n\n\n=== Colours ===\nThe club wore myrtle green.\n\n\n=== Ground ===\nThe club only ever seems to have played two matches in its existence, namely the Wigtownshire Cup final against Newton Stewart and an 8–2 defeat to Dalbeattie Star in August 1898, and there is no record of it having a home ground.\n\n\n== Hamilton Garrison F.C. ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nThe club was made up of soldiers stationed at the garrison in Hamilton, Lanarkshire, and its first reported match took place in 1888 against the \"Boy Jags\" of Hamilton Thistle.  It entered the Lanarkshire Cup in two separate runs, from 1901–02 to 1909–10, and from 1921–22 to 1927–28.  The club also joined the Scottish Football Association in 1919 and entered the Scottish Qualifying Cup from 1919–20 to 1927–28.  It lost every match it played in the two tournaments.  It walked over in the first round of the 1922–23 Qualifying Cup after opponent Renton scratched but lost 3–0 at Galston in the second.\nThe club had a little more success in the Scottish Amateur Cup, reaching the third round in 1920–21 and 1921–22.  The last recorded match for the club was a 6–1 home defeat to Greenhill Thistle in November 1930.\n\n\n=== Colours ===\nThe club wore scarlet and black until 1925, and changed to a combination of blue, black, and green from then until its demise.\n\n\n=== Ground ===\nThe club played its home matches in the Barracks, but it was unable to use it for Cup ties as it was not up to the proper Scottish FA standard, so had to play each of its senior ties away from home.\n\n\n== Jamestown F.C. (1898) ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nThe club was the second senior club from the village of Jamestown, in the Vale of Leven area of West Dunbartonshire, after the previous club which had entered Scottish Cup from 1878 to 1890.  It also had a Junior club affiliated with it, called Jamestown Athletic, which shared colours and secretary with the senior.\nThis second attempt club was founded in 1898 and had not played a match before joining the Scottish Football Association in August. It recruited a number of veteran players, including Mills, M'Coll, Smith, Gillies, and Graham, and was fancied for its first competitive match, against Renton in the first round of the 1898–99 Scottish Qualifying Cup.\nJamestown warmed up with a 0–0 draw against Cartvale, and secured another goalless draw with Renton in their tie; Renton won the replay 3–0.\nJamestown was also drawn against Renton in the Dumbartonshire Cup, but this time lost more heavily, 7–0 in a two-legged tie.\nThe club scratched to Kilbarchan in the Qualifying Cup second round in 1899–1900, after getting through the first round on a bye, and was suspended from the Scottish FA in September 1899 for not paying a required gate share to Johnstone.  After a season without playing the club was desultorily struck from the membership roll in April 1900.\n\n\n=== Colours ===\nThe club wore black and yellow.\n\n\n=== Ground ===\nLike the previous side from the village, Jamestown played at Balloch Park.\n\n\n== Lennox Amateurs F.C. ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nThe Dumbarton club was founded in 1907; its earliest recorded fixture for the club is a 1–1 draw at Barrhead Amateurs on October.  In 1908 it joined the Scottish Football Association, entitling it to take part in senior competitions, and also entered the Scottish Amateur Football League.\nThe attempt to run an amateur side in an area where professional football had been reduced to a rump was always quixotic, and the club was almost entirely without any success.  It played in the Dumbartonshire Cup in 1908–09 and 1909–10, which was run to a league system, but finished bottom in both seasons, with 2 wins in 14 matches; it should at least have won a third, a match at Renton being abandoned with the Amateurs 2–0 up after a Renton player threw the ball at the referee and the crowd invaded the pitch to support him, and the match was never replayed.\nThe club's initial Amateur League was a little more successful, the club heading for a mid-table position when the competition fizzled out because of the costs of travelling.  Its second Amateur League campaign - the competition now split geographically - could scarcely have been worse, the club losing its first six matches, with no sign that it played its remaining four.\nIt also played three ties in the Scottish Qualifying Cup, all heavy defeats - 8–0 at home to Port Glasgow Athletic in 1908–09 and 6–0 to Dumbarton Harp in the next two seasons.  The club played in the first Scottish Amateur Cup in 1910–11, and beat Queen's Park's Hampden XI in the first round, which made Lennox favourites for the competition; however the club was decisively beaten in the semi-final by the John Neilston FPs.\nThe semi-final defeat seems to have taken the heart out of the club, as in August 1910 it resigned from the Scottish FA, and the club never played again.\n\n\n=== Colours ===\nThe club played in black and white, probably in honour of Queen's Park.  Whether advertent or not, the colours were also those of the previous Lennox club from the town.\n\n\n=== Ground ===\nThe club originally played at Boghead Park, Dumbarton's home ground.  In 1908 it moved to St James' Park, which had been used by clubs such as Dumbarton Athletic the previous century.\n\n\n=== Notable players ===\nWilliam Clark, who signed for Dumbarton for the 1910–11 season\n\n\n== Lumphinnans F.C. ==\n\n\n=== History ===\n\nThe club, from the village of the same name in Fifeshire, was formed in May 1914 to provide senior football in the village.  The club's administrative officers were from Cowdenbeath, and the club resolved to play its home matches when Cowdenbeath was not also at home.\nThe club kept its ambitions in check for the 1914–15 season, deciding not to join a league, but to ease into football by playing in Cup competitions alone.  However the club's timing could scarcely have been worse, with the First World War starting within a fortnight.  There are only two recorded matches for the club; a 5–0 home defeat to Cowdenbeath to open its ground, and a 3–0 defeat to Lochgelly United in the 1914–15 Scottish Qualifying Cup, only goalkeeper Robertson saving the club from further humiliation after a \"feeble\" show.\nThereafter, the club failed to fulfil its fixtures, as so many of its players had joined the armed forces.  Indeed, one player, A. Wilkie, was censured for turning out for Inverness Caledonian when registered to Lumphinnans, but having been sent to Inverness for military purposes.  Lumphinnans therefore scratched from the Fife Cup, its sister competition the Wemyss Cup, and the Penman Cup.  The club therefore went into a hiatus for the War, which became permanent.\n\n\n=== Colours ===\nThe club played in maroon.\n\n\n=== Ground ===\nThe club's ground, which was behind Main Street, was called Zetland Park in honour of the Earl of Zetland, the proprietor of the estate.\n\n\n== Newbie Engineers F.C. ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nThe club was the works side of the Cochran & Co shipbuilding company in Annan, Dumfries and Galloway, and is first recorded as a football side in 1899, losing 12–0 to Shaddongate United.  The club finished the season as runner-up to Annan United in a local competition, and in August 1900 took the hugely ambitious step of joining the Scottish Football Association.\nThe club did beat Barholm Rovers in the first round of the 1900–01 Scottish Qualifying Cup, but it lost in the second round to the 6th G.R.V., and lost its only matches in the Southern Counties Cup and Annandale Cup.  The last record of the club is a 2–0 defeat at Annan in May 1901.\n\n\n=== Colours ===\nThe club played in navy blue.\n\n\n=== Ground ===\nThe club's ground was Highcroft Park.\n\n\n== Paisley Grammar School Former Pupils F.C. ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nThe club was founded for ex-pupils of Paisley Grammar School by William Walker in August 1906, with the aim of playing in the Glasgow & District Former Pupils' League.  Despite the existence of Paisley Academical, which was also open to former pupils of the school, the F.P. also joined the Scottish Football Association and Renfrewshire Association in 1912, and the two sides often played in the same Scottish Qualifying Cup.\nThe club entered the Scottish Qualifying Cup and Renfrewshire Cup from 1912–13 to 1933–34, but only ever won one match; a semi-final game in the Renfrewshire Victoria Cup (a consolation cup for those eliminated from the main competition) in 1929–30 over John Neilston F.P.s, but lost 2–1 in the final to Greenock High School F.P.s at Cappielow Park, the match being stopped with 10 minutes remaining because of bad light.  The only Qualifying Cup tie which did not end in defeat was a surprising 3–3 draw at Royal Albert in 1929–30, the Royalists winning the replay 5–2.\nThe club continued playing until at least 1952, against other former pupil clubs, but the club ceased operating on a nationally competitive level when it withdrew from the Scottish Amateur Football Association in May 1935.\n\n\n=== Colours ===\nThe club originally wore blue and gold.  In 1925 it changed to navy, sky, and yellow.\n\n\n=== Ground ===\nThe club played at Greenlaw, the ground of Paisley Academical.\n\n\n== Peterhead Hibernians F.C. ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nThe club was formed in 1906 as a rift from the more established Peterhead club; with too many players for one XI, many of the \"idle\" list formed their own club, under the coaching of George Steele.  Originally the club had some senior players, such as George Ross and Aiton Buchan (formerly of St Bernards) and Cadger (formerly of East Stirlingshire), and had a successful first season.\nHowever it could never live up to that early promise.  Its first match in the Aberdeenshire Cup was a 3–2 defeat to Peterhead in November 1908.\nThe Hibernians were admitted as members of the Aberdeenshire FA in May 1909 and the Scottish Football Association three months later.  This entitled the club to enter the Scottish Qualifying Cup; the Hibernians drew 2–2 at fellow Irish diaspora club Aberdeen Harp in the first round, squandering a 2-goal lead by conceding a last-second equalizer. Hibs lost 6–2 in the replay at Haudagain Park in Woodside, hindered by losing a player through injury when 3–2 down.  This put the club into the Consolation Cup, where it was drawn to play Aberdeen University.  The sides failed to agree a time and place for the match; the Scottish FA's response to a request for an extension to the deadline was to disqualify both clubs.\nThe club was one of the first entrants to the Scottish Amateur Cup in 1910, and beat Leith Amateurs 2–1 in the first round; the run ended against Queen's Park Strollers in the quarter-final.\nIts run in senior football was suffused with heavy defeats.  Its first competitive win was a 3–0 triumph over the obscure Maud United in the 1910–11 Aberdeenshire Cup.  Its second and last was 3–2 over Ellon United in the first round of the same competition the following season.\nThe club was however on borrowed time.  A Scottish FA delegation checked on the status of Balmoor Park (the club's stated ground for 1911–12) and reported that they had found \"no goal posts, pitch marks, or any appurtenances of the game...the ground no evidence that football had been played there for a long time.\"  The Hibs blamed building work encroaching on the ground area and the situation was temporary.  The matter was adjourned until the end of the season, but the club was struck from the Scottish FA roll in April 1912.\nIts last Qualifying Cup tie had been its most ignominous - a 12–1 defeat to Fraserburgh.  Such was the apathy by now that Hibs did not protest that Fraserburgh fielded two players who were under suspension; the point was only noticed when the Broch beat Peterhead in the second round, and the Blue Toon successfully protested.\n\n\n=== Colours ===\nIn common with many Irish diaspora sides, the club wore green.\n\n\n=== Ground ===\nThe club played variously at Balmoor Park and at the Recreation Park on the Peterhead Links.\n\n\n== Portpatrick Artillery F.C. ==\nThe club, formed from the volunteer corps in Portpatrick, Wigtownshire, had a brief existence that left almost no traces; its only recorded matches came in the Wigtownshire Cup in 1899–1900 and 1900–01 and the Scottish Qualifying Cup in the latter season.\nThe club joined the Scottish Football Association in 1900, despite some doubts whether the club had a private ground, and there is no trace on maps of the town of any permanent installation.\nIn the Qualifying Cup, the club walked over Tarff Rovers and in the second round lost 11–1 to Newton Stewart to so little interest nobody informed the media in time for Monday's press.  That seems to have been the end for the club, interest in Portpatrick lying dormant until the formation of a new club in August 1903.\n\n\n== Royal Garrison Artillery F.C. ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nThe Royal Garrison Artillery, as with most of the British Army stations, formed its own association football sides; in the 1904–05 Army Cup sides from the Shoeburyness, Sheerness, and Leith battalions all entered.  The Leith garrison took matters a stage further by joining the East of Scotland Football Association in 1905 and, in 1906, the Scottish Football Association, which brought with it entry to the Scottish Qualifying Cup, as well as other senior competitions held locally.\nThe Garrison duly entered the East of Scotland Shield Qualifying Cup from 1905–06 to 1907–08; at the time, reaching the final entitled a team to play in the City Cup, against two of the Edinburgh teams in the Scottish League who played off in the East of Scotland Shield.  The Garrison never won a tie in the competition, which put the club in the Consolation Cup, and in 1906–07 a win over Berwick Rangers (thanks to a Willie Hope own-goal) put the club in the semi-final, where it lost to Broxburn Athletic.\nThe club also entered the Qualifying Cup in 1906–07 and 1907–08, winning one tie - its first against Selkirk.\nIronically outgunned at senior level, the club allowed its Scottish FA membership to lapse in August 1908, and it returned to army football, playing until at least 1913.\n\n\n=== Colours ===\nThe club played in blue.\n\n\n=== Ground ===\nThe club played at Leith Fort.\n\n\n== Rumford Rovers F.C. ==\n\n\n=== History ===\n\nThe club, from Polmont in Stirlingshire, was formed in 1887, and its early years were marked by heavy defeats in the Stirlingshire Cup; its first match in the competition was a 15–2 defeat by Slamannan and its best performance was a 7–6 defeat to Vale of Endrick in 1891–92.\nThe Rovers were almost inactive in 1893 and 1894, playing only friendly or 5-a-side matches, and it was announced as defunct by the end of 1894.  However, the club was revived in the summer of 1895, re-admitted to the Stirlingshire Association, and admitted for the first time to the Scottish Football Association.\nThe club duly entered the Scottish Qualifying Cup for 1895–96, but lost 2–1 at Denny Athletic in the first round.  It was the club's only tie in the competition, as it did not renew its membership at the end of the season.\nIts Stirlingshire Cup appearances repeated the lack of success of its first runs in the competition; it never won a tie, even its two draws in the competition - against Stenhousemuir in 1896–97 and Dunipace in 1897–98, both seasons in which the competition was played over two legs - were followed by heavy defeats in the away legs, Stenhousemuir winning 15–4 on aggregate, despite Rovers taking the lead in the second leg.\nRumford's last appearance was a 2–0 defeat to Falkirk Amateurs in the first leg of the 1897–98 Consolation Cup semi-final (which Rovers had made by default) - the club did not turn up for the second, the local FA ordering Rovers to reimburse the Amateurs for £1 2/6 in expenses.\nThere was a curious aftermath, as in August 1898 the club re-joined the Scottish Football Association.  However it scratched from its Scottish Qualifying Cup tie against Stenhousemuir and within the month the Stirlingshire Association suspended the club sine die on the basis that it was, by now, a bogus club, and no representative could be found. It was strongly suspected that it had long ceased to exist, and had been entered into cup competitions for 1898–99 in order to make a profit by scratching from its ties for a financial consideration; the media sceptically referred to the club as \"Rummy Rovers\" as a consequence.\nThe club therefore had a shadow existence, as a member purporting to represent the club had attended a Scottish FA meeting, but the named secretary of the club - John Pender - denied any knowledge of the club at all when Stenhousemuir queried the non-payment of its expenses for the aborted Cup tie.  There was no answer when the Stirlingshire FA later wrote to Pender and a Mr Baillie (who had attended a Stirlingshire FA meeting in 1898 as a Rovers representative) to explain what was happening.   The club was formally struck off the Scottish FA roll in April 1899 for non-payment of subscription, by which time \"nobody knows anything about this club, neither where it hails from, who represents it now, [or] who paid its subscription [at the start of the season]\", and suspended once more from the Stirlingshire.\nThe name was occasionally resurrected, the first time in September 1899 for a one-off five-a-side team.\n\n\n=== Colours ===\nThe club played in red and white vertically striped shirts, and \"dark\" knickers (almost certainly serge blue).  On its 1898 revival, the club registered white shirts as its colours.\n\n\n=== Ground ===\nThe club played at Wallacelea Park.\n\n\n== Star of Atholl F.C. ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nThe club was founded on 11 October 1905 in order to provide football for the young men of Blair Atholl, under the patronage of the Duke of Atholl, and the club's honorary president, the Marquess of Tullibardine, opened its first meeting with some tips as to how to run a successful club.  The Marquess kicked off the club's first match, at home to Dunkeld & Birnam the following Saturday, and the Stars came from 2–0 down to win 3–2.\nThe club took its name from a nickname of Baledmund House, a Georgian-era baronial home prominent as a landmark.\nThe club was promptly admitted to the new Perthshire League as a founder member in November; with 10 clubs entered for the competition, the Perthshire FA split the competition into two, and Star of Atholl was placed with Dunkeld, Breadalbane, and Vale of Atholl into the Atholl League, and the Marquess agreed to become League president.\nThe Stars also played in the Atholl Cup from 1904–05 to 1906–07.  Its run in both competitions was unsuccessful - in three years of league football, the Stars only won once (3–2 over Vale of Atholl in 1906, all the goals coming in the first half, and the Stars being reduced to 10 for the second through injury), and won two ties in the Atholl Cup.  Its best performance was drawing twice with  Our Boys of Blairgowrie in the 1905–06 semi-final.\nIn 1905, the club joined the Perthshire Association, entitling it to play in the Perthshire Cup and Scottish Qualifying Cup, and it entered both competitions in 1905–06 and 1906–07.  The only tie in either competition it won was in the first round of the 1905–06 Qualifying Cup, beating Dunkeld & Birnam 2–0.  In the second round the Stars lost 8–0 in front of 1,500 spectators at Arbroath, having sold home advantage for £12; the highlight was Horne saving a penalty when the Stars were six down.\nThe club managed to complete the 1906–07 season, finishing off with a 2–1 defeat by a side from the Scots Greys on 3 June, but it did not renew its Perthshire FA membership and was \"scored off the roll\".\nThe name has been revived on occasion, the first time in 1949, for a club which played in a similar gold and black kit.\n\n\n=== Colours ===\nThe club wore the colours of the house of Athole, namely yellow and black, \"without the star\".\n\n\n=== Ground ===\nThe club played at a ground owned by a Mr MacDonald, and named Tullibardine Park in honour of its patron.\n\n\n== Strathallan F.C. ==\n\n\n=== History ===\n\nThe club was originally the reserve side of the Dunblane F.C., and, as was common in the Victorian era, had a different name to the parent club, under the full name of Strathallan XI.  The first record of the name being used is from 1898.\nIn 1901, after friction broke out between the parent club and the reserve side, the Strathallan XI transferred allegiance to Auchterarder Thistle.  The XI returned to Dunblane for a friendly match in May 1902, which Dunblane won 5–0.  Despite this defeat, the XI - which was still playing in Dunblane - resolved two months later to split from Auchterarder to form its own separate senior side, with entries planned for the Perthshire Cup and Scottish Qualifying Cup.  The club duly entered the Perthshire FA in September under the simpler name Strathallan, but lost its first Cup tie at Auchterarder Thistle.\nStrathallan entered the Scottish Football Association in August 1903; in contrast to Dunblane, Strathallan remained a purely amateur side, made up purely of Dunblane men.  Its first Qualifying Cup tie in 1903–04 was an 8–1 hammering of Morrisonians, but it lost 2–0 at home to the Vale of Teith in the second.\nIt had a longer run in the Perthshire Cup, reaching the semi-final, where the club was drawn to face Dunblane at Duckburn Park; despite strengthening the side with players from the amateur ranks of Scottish football, the Strath went down 3–1.  The club also played league football in the season, although the competition - the Central League - only had three teams in it (Dunblane and King's Park being the others) after Vale of Teith withdrew, and Strathallan only picked up one point from the three matches it played, Dunblane winning the title without needing to play Strathallan a second time.\nDespite the promising second season, the club's third was its last.  It scratched from the Qualifying Cup to Auchterarder and lost in the first round of the Perthshire Cup to the Morrisonians at Turret Bridge Park, in part because a lot of its players were away from Dunblane, and during the season a number of its players were found in the Dunblane ranks.  It  did not renew its Scottish FA membership for 1905–06, and dissolved.\n\n\n=== Colours ===\nThe club described its colours as blue and white when starting out as a senior club, and black and white for its last season; the arrangement was probably in hoops, as when the club was a second XI it wore similar jerseys to Queen's Park.\n\n\n=== Ground ===\nThe club's ground was opposite to Dunblane's Duckburn Park.\n\n\n=== Notable players ===\nWilliam Eadie, who kept goal for the club in its final season\n\n\n== Trinity F.C. (Edinburgh) ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nThe Edinburgh club turned senior in 1896, after a run as a Junior side; the earliest recorded match for the club was against the Adventurers' second XI in October 1893.  The club was effectively a replacement of Edinburgh Casuals, another amateur club which had tried senior football, and which had last played in October 1895. \nIt was a purely amateur outfit, declaring that \"the wealth of a Barney Barnato would not be sufficient\" to turn it professional.  Early recruits to the senior side included goalkeeper Ruxton from St Bernards and the Hay brothers, both members of the Edinburgh Harriers athletics club.\nThe club entered two local competitions, the East of Scotland Shield and the King Cup, in its first senior season.  It won its first round tie in the Shield against Muirhouse Rovers – the clubs forced to play each other, as both had entered after other first round ties had been played - by 5 goals to 1, at Davidson's Mains.  In the second round, against St Bernards at Logie Green, the club caused a sensation by taking the lead.  However, in the second half, two of the Trinity players refused to play on, owing to the adverse weather conditions, and the Saints came back to win 3–1.\nTrinity also won its first round King Cup tie, 2–1 at Vale of Leithen, and then drew a bye in the second round, which put it in the quarter-final; in the last 8, Trinity was drawn to visit Penicuik Athletic.  However, the club's amateurism was shown up by it only turning up at Penicuik with seven players.  Facing a certain defeat, Trinity scratched from the competition, and played out a friendly, eventually recruiting two substitutes.  The friendly ended 4–3 to Penicuik, although the home side \"played to the gallery\" when 4–1 up.\nIt joined the Scottish Football Association in November 1896, by which time it had 70 members; it was too late to play in the Scottish Qualifying Cup in 1896–97, so the club's first entry to the competition was 1897–98.  It walked over a scratching Loanhead Benburb in the first round.   Before the second round tie was to be played, the club lost 4–0 at home to Penicuik Athletic in the first round of the Shield, despite being boosted by the recruitment of forward Coltherd from St Bernards.  The club scratched from its second round Qualifying Cup tie with Bathgate on the day of the match itself, due to the players \"losing the train\"; such metaphorical (as well as literal) amateurism seems to have finished the club off as there is no record of it playing again.  The club notionally existed until the end of the season, despite not playing, as one player (forward C. Nicklin) was claiming membership of \"Trinity FC\" when competing in athletics.\n\n\n=== Colours ===\nThe club wore red and white striped shirts and blue knickers.\n\n\n=== Ground ===\nThe club played at a number of home grounds; given its amateur status it did not have a geographical constituency and appears to have hired grounds on an ad hoc basis.  In 1893 for instance it played at Ferry Road, in 1894 at Hawkhill, and in 1895 at both Ferry Road and Hawkhill.  It also played a match against the Scots Guards in 1896 at Easter Road. Its last recorded home match was at Logie Green, the same ground as St Bernards.\n\n\n== Vale of Carrick F.C. ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nThe club, from Maybole in Ayrshire, was founded in 1905, and admitted to the Scottish Football Association that August; the original name proposed was St Crispin but Vale of Carrick was chosen instead.  The selecting committee did not restrict themselves to choosing local players, who were playing for the long-established Maybole F.C., but included a number of Glaswegians.\nThe club's first match was a 3–0 home victory over the Third Lanark \"A\" side, but the club's ambitions received a reality check, when fellow new bugs Ayr Academicals beat the Vale 4–0 in the first round of the Scottish Qualifying Cup – injury added to insult when John Dunlop, sent off for kicking the Acas' Ferguson, received a 2-month suspension.\nThe Vale had better fortune in the North Ayrshire League, beating Girvan 6–1 in its first match, and holding Maybole to a draw.  However the Vale lost the return match at Ladywell Park 7–1 and also lost 8–0 at Kilwinning Eglinton.\nIt had become apparent that the experiment of transplanting Glaswegians to Maybole had failed, and the club scratched from the Ayrshire Cup first round tie against Annbank in March 1906, not having played since losing 3–1 at home to Beith just before Christmas 1905.  Somehow the club was entered into the 1906–07 Qualifying Cup, and was drawn to play Hurlford, but the Hurlford secretary Goldie had no answer to his correspondence with regard to the tie's arrangements.\n\n\n=== Colours ===\nThe club played in black and white.\n\n\n=== Ground ===\nThe Vale played at Carrick Park.\n\n\n== West End F.C. (Dundee) (1894) ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nThe first West End club had been wound up in the mid-1880s, and on 17 November 1890 a second club with the name was founded, with J. A. Turnbull as captain. The club however never got off the ground, and was revived at a meeting in the Albion Hotel on 19 January 1894 as a purely amateur club in Dundee, attracting a large number of promised members.  It applied to join the Scottish Football Association the next month, by which time it had \"forty to fifty members\" (considered cast-offs from the merged Johnstone Wanderers and Strathmore seeking re-instatement as amateurs), but was having problems in securing a private ground due to local objections.  The application was duly adjourned to August, when the club was admitted, despite having \"to give up their recently acquired ground\", but having first option on the old Strathmore ground, which a tennis club was occupying.\nThe club's senior status however was short-lived.  It scratched from the first round of the Scottish Qualifying Cup when drawn to face Forfar Athletic, amid dark rumours that the club did not exist, other than to make up the 10 members required for the Forfarshire FA to have a representative on the Scottish FA board.  The club proved that technically incorrect by managing to play some games, but its true status in the game was shown up in an 8–0 friendly defeat to the obscure Caenlochan from Broughty Ferry the next month.  Very obviously overmatched, the club did not enter any of the local senior competitions, and turned to Junior football from 1895.  Even at that level the club struggled, never getting past the third round of the Scottish Junior Cup, and usually finishing near the bottom of the Dundee & District Junior League before finally giving up after the 1923–24 season.\n\n\n=== Colours ===\nThe club wore light blue jerseys and white knickers.\n\n\n=== Ground ===\nThe club played at Esplanade Park.\n\n\n== West End F.C. (Oban) ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nThe club, from Oban in Argyllshire, was officially called West End, but usually referred to as West End (Oban) or Oban West End to avoid confusion with other clubs of the same name.\nThe club was active from the 1889–90 season and won the Oban and District Junior Cup three times in a row, from 1890–91 to 1892–93, beating Mossfield Thistle and Fort William (twice).  It joined the Scottish Football Association in 1895, after the other clubs in the county had dissolved.  It entered the Scottish Qualifying Cup three times, but lost the two ties it played - 5–4 to Duncrub Park (when included in the Perthshire section) in 1895–96 and 9–0 at Vale of Leven in 1897–98 - either side of scratching to Newtown Thistle, by which time Argyllshire had been shifted to Dunbartonshire.\nThe geographically isolated club had sold its home advantage for its last tie, only just managing to scrape a team together (with rumours suggesting that the club would scratch), and resigned from the Scottish FA in June 1898.  The club went into abeyance for a period, before continuing at a junior level until 1904, its final game being a 3–1 defeat to sailors from the HMS Isis at Mossfield in July.\n\n\n=== Colours ===\nThe club wore \"pure white\" jerseys and blue knickers, which it adopted at the start of 1890.\n\n\n=== Ground ===\nThe club played at Mossfield.\n\n\n=== Notable players ===\nAt least one of the club's players played for a club in both the Scottish Football League and the Southern League; Duncan Cameron, who played for Clyde and Brighton & Hove Albion.\n\n\n== Whifflet Rovers F.C. ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nThe club was originally an junior club from the village of Gartcosh called Gartcosh Rovers, active from the 1923–24 season.  The club played in the Scottish Amateur Football League from the late 1920s, and won the Second Division B section in 1929–30, gaining promotion to the First Division.  The club finished as runner-up in 1931–32.\nBefore the 1933–34 season, the club looked to turn senior, but, knowing the Scottish Football Association would rule the club's ground as being inadequate, rented Meadow Park in Coatbridge.  The SFA accepted the club as a member so long as, given the distance between Gartcosh and Coatbridge, it changed its name; it duly did so to Whifflet Rovers.  It left the Scottish Amateur League to join the Coatbridge & District equivalent.  The club beat Moorpark in the first round of the 1933–34 Scottish Qualifying Cup, but lost its next fixture in the competition at Vale Ocoba, and the club's move proved to be a mistake, as it did not survive the season.  Indeed, it may not have seen out the year; the last recorded match for the club is a 4–2 loss to East Kilbride in the second round of the West of Scotland Amateur Cup in November.\n\n\n== Wick F.C. ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nThe club was the second from the town of Wick in Caithness to join the Scottish Football Association, doing so soon after its creation in 1904.\nIt was in essence an ad-hoc club made up of players from the four town clubs, so they could take part in national competition.  As with predecessor club Wick Rovers, its geographical isolation - and having to play football while the fishing season was still in full swing - proved too much of a handicap to overcome.  It entered the Scottish Qualifying Cup in 1904–05 and 1905–06, but lost in the first round both times; 5–1 at home to Inverness Caledonian in the former year (with a starting XI which had not even trained together before the match), and 3–2 at home to the Black Watch in the latter.\nMore to the point, the Cup matches were not a financial success - the game against Caledonian only drew a gate of £7 but the cost of the guarantee and train fares for the opponents pushed the cost of hosting to £15.  The Black Watch match was also a financial failure, with a gate of £4 15s. against expenditure of just under £15, although the blame was put on the weather; the rain fell so hard that the players had to leave the field for a while.\nIn the face of such financial disasters, the Wick association stopped entering the Qualifying Cup, although it still chose representative sides for occasional matches.\n\n\n=== Colours ===\nThe club listed its colour as red.\n\n\n=== Ground ===\nThe club played at Harrow Park, as Wick Rovers had done.\n\n\n== External links ==\nScottish Cup results by team\nAberdeenshire Cup\nAyrshire Cup\nChurchill Cup\nDumbartonshire Cup\nEdinburgh/East of Scotland Shield\nForfarshire Cup\nGlasgow Cup\nPerthshire Cup\nPerthshire League\nRenfrewshire Cup\nSouthern Counties Cup\nStirlingshire Cup\nWest of Scotland Cup\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Baron Koyata Iwasaki was a Japanese industrialist who served as the fourth and last president of the unified Mitsubishi. He was the last person to hold the office before the Allied Occupation Forces ordered the dissolusion of all major zaibatsu.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nKoyata was born in 1879 in Tokyo as the eldest son of Yanosuke Iwasaki, the second president of Mitsubishi, and Sanae Iwasaki, the daughter of Shojiro Goto. \nHe attended the First Higher School, then matriculated at Tokyo Imperial University. He later matriculated at Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he read history, geography, and sociology. He started working for Mitsubishi in 1906. In 1906, he married Takako (岩崎孝子), the daughter of Baron Uzuhiko Shimazu. Upon his father's death in 1908, he inherited the barony.\n\n\n== As President of Mitsubishi ==\nHe succeeded his cousin Kyuya as the President of Mitsubishi in 1916, during the First World War. He held the office for 29 years, a period during which he significantly expanded the group. He spun off each department into a subsidiary, covering sectors such as mining, shipbuilding, banking, trading, and real estate. Under his leadership, Mitsubishi enjoyed de facto monopolies or oligopolies in many of these sectors. To further expand the group, he sold nearly half of the shares of these subsidiaries to the public, while Mitsubishi headquarters, led by him, owned the rest. In 1917, he also privately funded the establishment of an optics company and became the majority shareholder, which later became Nikon.\nAfter the loss of the Second World War in 1945, the Allied Occupation Forces ordered all major zaibatsu to be split into smaller companies, and all members of the founding families were forced to sell all the shares they held. Koyata was strongly opposed to this order but died in December of the same year. The site of his house in Roppongi is now occupied by the International House of Japan. Although the building was rebuilt in 1955, the garden remains largely as it was when Koyata commissioned it in 1930.\n\n\n== References ==",

In 2011, La Gazzetta dello Sport, an Italian sports newspaper, named her as the most beautiful Formula One wife of all time.\nMore recently, Rindt has been described as a \"secret\", \"underrated\", and \"forgotten\" style icon, and as \"... kind of too cool for words.\" Additionally, the now-classic  Universal Genève Compax model chronograph, an example of which she used to wear trackside, has come to be nicknamed the 'Nina Rindt watch' in her honour.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Nina Rindt at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "George \"Coach Mac\" McMillion was an American former All-American competition swimmer for Southern Methodist University, and a Hall of Fame collegiate swim coach who directed the Southern Methodist swim team for seventeen years from 1971–1988, after serving as Assistant Coach for fourteen years.  McMillion led the Mustangs to eight Southwestern Conference Championships and an NCAA second-place finish in 1983.\nBorn in 1932 in Coffeyville, Kansas, to Dr. John D. & Mattie McMillion, he swam for Coffeyville's Field Kinley High School under Coach Johnny Charlesworth, where he graduated in 1950.  Charlesworth's F. Kinley High School team, sometimes referred to as Coffeyville High School, were state champions in McMillion's Junior and Senior years and McMillion co-captained the team in his Senior year, when he swam a 2:22.7 in the 220-yard freestyle in state record time.  By February 1950, McMillion's Field Kinley High School had 28 consecutive dual meet victories.  On July 30, 1949, he placed third and qualified in the 100-meter backstroke for the widely attended Sooner Open Swim Meet.\n\n\n== Swimming for SMU ==\nMcMillion, who swam for SMU prior to serving as coach, was team captain in 1954. During his years on the team, he captured seven Southwest Conference individual championships and was undefeated in the backstroke event during the three years he lettered. He held conference records in the 100 and 200-yard backstroke.  Swimming for Coffeyville Swim Club during a summer break on June 29, 1952, McMillion scored 25 points helping his team win the Men's Division at the annual Sooner State Swim Meet. \nAs a highpoint during his SMU swimming career, at the Southwestern Conference Championships on March 22, 1952, at College Station, he set two conference records, including one in the 100-yard backstroke of 1:02.3.    He was also the individual high scorer at the meet.\nAfter college, he served as a lieutenant in the U.S. Army Air Force for two years and taught in the Dallas Public School system before coming to SMU as an Assistant Coach in 1957.\n\n\n== Coaching ==\nMcMillion was SMU Head Coach from 1971 to 1988, before acting as Assistant Coach from 1957 to 1971 under renowned SMU Coach Red Barr. One of McMillion's Assistant coaches from 1971 through 1975 was former SMU swimmer Richard Quick, who would become a Hall of Fame Coach himself.  McMillion mentored 78 All-Americans and 15 NCAA Champions, leading his teams to 14 NCAA top-10 finishes.   He served as Meet Director of the 1972 and 1974 National AAU Swimming Championships.\nIn one of McMillion's best years, his SMU swim team had an undefeated season of 16-0 in 1979. Demonstrating consistent performance in their conference, McMillion's teams had eight consecutive Southwestern Conference Championships between 1971-1979.\nHe was a U.S. National Team coach in 1978, 1982 and 1983.\nMcMillion coached NCAA champions Steve Lundquist, Jerry Heidenreich, Ron Mills, Ricardo Prado, and Mook Rhodenbaugh.  Ron Mills was a 1968 Olympic medalist, Jerry Heidenreich was a 1972 Olympian and medalist, while Steve Lundquist, Ricardo Prado, and Richard Saeger were 1984 Olympic medalists.\n\n\n== Honors ==\nHe was the recipient of the Southwest Conference “Coach of the Year” honors in 1972, 1976, 1977 and 1984, and was named NCAA District Six “Coach of the Year” in 1973.  In 1978, he received the “Big D” Award from the Dallas All-Sports Association. In 1971, he was a recipient of the prestigious Collegiate and Scholastic Swimming Trophy, presented to a Coach who in the belief of his peers in the swimming community, \"has contributed in an outstanding way to swimming as a competitive sport and healthful recreational activity.\"  He became a member of the SMU Athletics Hall of Fame in 2011, the Southwest Conference Hall of Fame in 2014 and the Texas Swimming and Diving Hall of Fame in 2009.\nMcMillion died surrounded by family in Richardson, Texas on November 7, 2017. He was survived by his wife Jean McMillion, and his three children: Stan McMillion, Robin McMillion Eiland & husband Bill, and Jan McMillion Mansfield and husband Mark. He had 9 grandchildren.\n\n\n== External links ==\nTexas Swimming and Diving Hall of Fame, George McMillion\nAmerican Swimming Coaches Association Hall of Fame\nDallas Morning News Obituary, George McMillion\n\n\n== References ==",

DoubleGrazing (talk) 07:54, 13 April 2024 (UTC)\n\nŠtore was Slovenian producer of  tractors with headquarters in Štore, Slovenia (then: Yugoslavia)\nThe construction began in 1974, in 1972 the cooperation contract was signed with Italian company\nFiat. Its most popular product was Štore 402 tractor. The company was officialy opened on 21st June 1977. One of the speakers on the day of opening was the president of Fiat company Riccardo Chivino.\nDuring its operation, the factory faced great opposition from the then largest tractor manufacturer IMT Beograd, which, together with the crisis in the world market, led to its closure. During the crisis, FIAT reduced the purchase of tractors in Štore, which caused major financial problems and resulted in the cease of production and shutdown of the factory on 31st dec 1985.\nDuring the period of operation, 35,938 tractors were manufactured, of which 13,812 were exported. At its peak, the tractor factory employed 320 people.\n\n\n== Products ==\nŠtore 402\nŠtore 404\nŠtore 502\nŠtore 504\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Mohamad Tony Harjono (born 4 October 1971) is an Indonesian air force officer who became the 24th air force chief of staff, serving since 5 April 2024. He graduated from the air force academy in 1992 and commanded several airbases and regional commands before being entrusted to lead the air force. He was a confidant of President Joko Widodo, having served as his aide-de-camp from 2014 until 2016 and military secretary from 2020 until 2022. Military observers identified him as part of the Solo Gang, a group of military and police officers whose career rose swiftly after serving in Surakarta, the hometown of Joko Widodo.\n\n\n== Military career ==\n\n\n=== Fighter pilot and instructor ===\nHarjono was born on 4 October 1971 in Jakarta. Harjono began his service upon graduating from the air force academy in 1993. He started his career as a flight officer in the 3rd squadron, headquartered in the Iswahjudi Air Force Base. His career gradually rose in the squadron and consequently became the chief of navigation and chief of personnel.Harjono attended the air force's aviator school in 1996 and a course on flying the F-16 Fighting Falcon fighter jet the next year. He was assigned to the Adisumarmo Airbase as flight instructor. Harjono received certification to flew the KAI KT-1 Woongbi turboprop in 2005 and the Sukhoi Su-27 in 2008. He was given the callsign Racoon.Harjono graduated from the Air Force Command School in 2002 and returned to the 3rd Squadron as a fighter pilot. On 3 July 2003, the squadron was detached by the sNational Air Defence Command in a standoff against the US Navy F-18 Hornets over Bawean Island. Harjono, who was a captain at that time, piloted one of the two F-16s detached in the standoff.\n\n\n=== Squadron, airbase commander, and aide-de-camp ===\nHarjono's career in the airforce began to rose quickly after the incident. He was assigned to the Hasanuddin Airbase in Makassar, where he became the chief of operations and the commander of the 11th squadron. He was briefly sent to Timika in Central Papua as the commander of the local airbase before returning to Makassar as wing commander.\nAt the end of his tenure as wing commander in 2014, Harjono was selected by president-elect at that time, Joko Widodo, as his aide-de-camp from the air force until 2016. Afterwards, in October 2016 he was sent to command the Adisumarmo Airbase in Surakarta, Joko Widodo's hometown, making him part of the Solo Gang.During his tenure as airbase commander, an incident occurred in which an air force training aircraft skidded off the runway. Both the instructor and the pilot were unharmed, and Harjono later clarified that the aircraft suffered minor damage.Aside from his daily duty in Surakarta, Harjono also studied management at the nearby Gajayana University in Malang. He received a degree in 2018.After less than two years serving as the commander of the Adisumarmo Airbase, in February 2018 Harjono was assigned to command the Halim Perdanakusumah Airbase, the air force's largest airbase. Harjono was installed on 26 February 2018 and received a promotion to the rank of first air marshal (air commodore) on 8 April. Harjono issued a call for residents nearby to stop flying balloons in order to prevent flight accidents. He also oversaw the opening of the Halim Park for the public in 2019.\n\n\n=== Military secretary and commander ===\nHarjono received his second star shortly after being appointed as Joko Widodo's military secretary. He was installed for the position on 11 November 2020 and was promoted to air vice-marshal a week later. In April 2022, Harjono was appointed as the commissioner for the Pelita Air Service company, representing the air force interests.Less than two years later, on 13 July 2022, Harjono became the Commander of the Air Force Doctrine, Education and Training Leadership Command, and received his third star as air marshal on 29 July. Harjono continued to held the position of military secretary until 24 August.Harjono's stint in the Air Force Doctrine, Education and Training Leadership Command lasted for less than six months, as on 6 December 2022 he became the commander of the newly-formed National Air Operations Command. A year later, on 13 December 2023, Harjono was made as the Commander of the Second Joint Territorial Defense Command. On both occasions, Harjono replaced Andyawan Martono Putra, who was five years more senior than him.\n\n\n== Chief of Staff of the Air Force ==\nAs early as December 2022, Harjono had already been projected to become the air force chief of staff, as he was the only three-star marshal in his class of 1993. In March 2024, as air force chief of staff Fadjar Prasetyo was nearing his retirement age, three names became the main candidates to replace him. Harjono, Samsul Rizal (Commander of the Armed Force Command and Staff College), and Tedi Rizalhadi (Commander of the Second Joint Territorial Defense Command), were all nominees to the position. Andyawan, the-then deputy chief of staff of the air force, was not nominated, as he was also nearing his retirement age. Out of all the candidates, Tonny was the most junior and longest to retire, having five years and seven months of active service before entering retirement. Tonny's previous position as Joko Widodo's aide-de-camp and military secretary made him the strongest candidate out of them all. Harjono was eventually confirmed as the new chief of staff through a presidential decree on 25 March 2024.Harjono was installed as the new air force chief of staff on 5 April 2024 at the state place by President Joko Widodo. He was promoted on the same occasion as a four-start air chief marshal. A handover ceremony from Fadjar to Harjono was held at the Halim Perdanakusumah Airbase on the same day, attended by cabinet and air force officials. Several hundred air force soldiers were deployed for the handover ceremony, including a flypast of six F-16s in the midst of flag passing ceremony. On his inauguration speech, armed forces commander General Agus Subiyanto urged the air force to adapt in light of the upcoming new planes. Coordinating Minister for Politics, Law, and Security Hadi Tjahjanto encouraged Harjono to continue Fadjar's program, ensure that defense equipment functions well, secure airspace and borders, and prepare weather modification technology to anticipate forest and land fires. Harjono stated his readiness to lead the air force despite the seniority of most of his subordinates, such as his deputy, Andyawan.Harjono was endorsed by politicians inside the People's Representative Council. MP Bobby Rizaldi stated that Harjono was the most feasible candidate for the air force chief of staff due to his age and experience with the president. Another MP, TB Hasanuddin, stated his support for Harjono's appointment due to his good track record. Meutya Hafid, the chairman of the first commission—handling armed forces—inside the People's Representative Council, expressed her support for Harjono's nomination due to his experience in handling various aerial problems.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nHarjono is married to Isa Apriliani and has two children.Shortly after Harjono's confirmation as the air force chief of staff, the secretary general of the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle Hasto Kristiyanto stated that Harjono was related to first lady Iriana Widodo. A hoax later spread on Facebook that Harjono was the brother-in-law of Iriana. Independent investigation later disproved this claim, showing that Harjono was related neither to Joko Widodo nor Iriana.\n\n\n== Dates of rank ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Road to Hell Is Paved with Good Intentions is a studio album by British electronic musician Vegyn, released on 5 April 2024. It has received positive reviews by critics.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIn a profile for Alternative Press, Dale W. Eisinger called this release \"a smart record\" that \"brings a sense of promise through its 13 tracks\". Writing at Clash Music, Jay Fullarton scored this album an 8 out of 10, ending \"this record doesn’t sound like a hellscape though, it somehow chases the ecstasy high his debut set and exceeds it in the process\".The Observer's Damien Morris scored this release 3 out of 5 stars, placing this in the middle of Vegyn's catalogue in terms of quality and ended, \"if you enjoy its combination of fractured storytelling and long instrumental passages, you’ll appreciate the consistent quality of the simpler songs around it\".\nWriting for Pitchfork Media, Dash Lewis scored this release a 7.1 out of 10 and called this \"[Joseph] Thornalley’s most crowd-pleasing project to date, even if it isn’t his most cohesive\". Ted Davis of Paste scored this album a 7.2 out of 10, praising the music's range as it \"casually flips between the heady and accessible sides of the Vegyn coin\". A feature on Vegyn for Rolling Stone included Sam Davies calling this album \"45 minutes of lovely electronic music that will soothe your ears in much the way a good meme can soothe the eyes after a few minutes of reading the news\". In Spin, Margaret Farrell gave this album an A, writing that it is \"both melancholic and euphoric\" with music that spans \"from jazzy and transcendental to glitchy and trip-hop symphonic\" Variety's Jem Aswad considered The Road to Hell Is Paved with Good Intentions \"heavenly electro-pop\" and compared to Vegyn's previous work, older material has \"never been quite as focused or finely honed as it is here\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"A Dream Goes On Forever\" – 4:39\n\"Another 9 Days\" – 3:06\n\"Turn Me Inside\" – 2:54\n\"Halo Flip\" – 6:55\n\"Everything Is the Same\" – 2:22\n\"The Path Less Traveled\" – 3:44\n\"Makeshift Tourniquet\" – 5:17\n\"Time Well Spent\" – 3:00\n\"In the Front\" – 3:47\n\"Trust\" – 2:11\n\"Stress Test\" – 2:07\n\"Last Night I Dreamt I Was Alone\" – 3:26\n\"Unlucky for Some...\" – 1:17\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nVegyn – instrumentation, mixing, production\nLauren Auder – music on \"Halo Flip\"\nEthan P.

        "content": "Eastbound (originally released in 2012 as Tangente vers l'est) is a book by French author Maylis de Kerangal, published in translation in 2023 by Archipelago Books. The novel tells the story of Aliocha, a 20 year old Russian conscript who is attempting desertion from the army as he travels on a trans-Siberian train heading east. On board the train he meets Helene, a passenger in first class. Helene is a 35 year old French woman who is leaving her Russian lover. Helene does not speak Russian and the two communicate with hand gestures and other non-verbal cues. Helene assists Aliocha in evading capture from his Sergeant as he attempts to flee.\nThe novel was named one of the best books of 2023 by The New York Times and The New Yorker.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nWriting in the New York Times, author Ken Kalfus believed that the book's setting, on board a speeding train in the vastness of Siberia, complemented the characters' relationship elegantly. Halfus stated: \"Siberia’s immensity dwarfs human perspective. The insecurity of existence across this vastness and on board the train emphasizes the significance of human connection. In a time of war, this connection may bring liberation and salvation.\" Writing for The New Yorker, Lauren Oyler stated that de Kerangal vividly portrayed urgency and the fleeting passage of time as the protagonists try to escape, stating: \"It takes immense skill, patience, and clarity to paint time, to render the melee of past and present, symbolic and real. Language may not be what allows us to see it, but in the right hands we can get close.\" Writing for The Wall Street Journal, Sam Sacks stated: \"Eastbound briskly unfolds the events of this crazy but thrilling little Mission: Impossible, allowing itself speedy diversions into the backgrounds of both Aliocha and his accomplice\", while further stating: \"The crisp cascading sentences; the delicious mixture of fear and romance; the harmonious balance of story and language: these are characteristics of each of Ms. de Kerangal's books.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Second Act (French: Le Deuxième Acte) is an upcoming 2024 French comedy film written, shot, edited and directed by Quentin Dupieux. It stars Léa Seydoux, Vincent Lindon, Louis Garrel and Raphaël Quenard. The plot follows a young woman who brings her boyfriend to meet her father. It is a meta-comedy about actors in a doomed film production.The film is set to have its world premiere as the opening film at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival on 14 May 2024 and will be released theatrically in France on the same day by Diaphana Distribution.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nFlorence wants to introduce David, the man she is madly in love with, to her father Guillaume. But David is not attracted to Florence and wants to get rid of her by throwing her into the arms of his friend Willy. The four characters meet in a restaurant in the middle of nowhere.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nLéa Seydoux as Florence\nVincent Lindon as Guillaume\nLouis Garrel as David\nRaphaël Quenard as Willy\nManuel Guillot\n\n\n== Production ==\nIn January 2024, Léa Seydoux revealed in an interview with Télérama that she had recently completed two weeks of filming for an unannounced new film by Quentin Dupieux, then titled À notre beau métier ('To Our Beautiful Profession'), which would also star Vincent Lindon, Louis Garrel and Raphaël Quenard. Seydoux read the script in one sitting and quickly accepted the role out of admiration for Dupieux who she described as an \"extraordinary filmmaker\" whose style of humour \"hides an increasingly social depth, through imperfect and clumsy characters.\" She described the film as a mise en abyme about \"actors who play in a lousy film\" and confront their characters and lines, and as \"crazy\" and \"very, very funny\".The Second Act was filmed entirely in the Dordogne department and more precisely in Périgord noir region, from 4 December to 22 December 2023. It was shot primarily at the aerodrome of Condat-sur-Vézère, a small private airfield still in operation. The existing airfield building, a former restaurant which has long been used for weddings, was converted over the course of a month by artisan craftsmen. The Atelier des fac-similés du Périgord (AFSP) in Montignac-Lascaux was involved in construction of the sets. The aerodrome's landing strip was disguised to give it the appearance of a lost highway. The production also filmed near the AFSP in Montignac-Lascaux. Thierry Bordes of Ciné Passion en Périgord, an association which supports film productions in Dordogne, claims that Dupieux has made \"the longest tracking shot in the history of cinema\" in The Second Act.Production for the film was kept fully secret from beginning to end. The owner of the aereodrome, Roland Boissière, described the production as having the \"greatest secrecy\" and did not even know Vincent Lindon had come to film on his property. Hugo Sélignac produced the film through his company Chi-Fou-Mi Productions.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe Second Act was selected to be the opening film at the 77th Cannes Film Festival, where it will have its world premiere out-of-competition on 14 May 2024. It will be released theatrically in France on the same day by Diaphana Distribution.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Second Act at IMDb",

Ամբերդեցի, ruled 1206–1230), was an Armenian prince, and a Court official of the Kingdom of Georgia holding the offices of Msakhurtukhutsesi (Majordomo), founder of the Vachutian dynasty, themselves vassals to the Zakarid dynasty of Zakarid Armenia.He was married to Mamakhatun, daughter of Abuserh.Vache I Vachutian is known for the foundation of various monastic buildings in historical Armenia. He built the churches of the Saghmosavank Monastery (1215) and Hovhannavank Monastery (1216–1221), while his son Kurt built the zhamatuns attached to them, in 1250 for Hovhannavank and 1255 for Saghmosavank. Vache Vachutian also built the church of Tegher Monastery (1213), and the vestibule (gavit) of St. Astvatsatsin Church in Sanahin Monastery (1211), which is evidenced by the inscription preserved on the south wall inside the vestibule. He is also known for building a mausoleum at Horomos Monastery in 1229. The mausoleum is a square space of about 8x8 meters, lined with blind arcades supporting a huge \"stone tent\" structure of the type of the stalactite vaults. The \"stone tent\" would have reached a height of about 6 meters, giving a total of 9 meters for the mausoleum. Photographs from the 19th century show the wall and the beginning of the stone tent structure. This type of \"stalactite tent\" is also seen in other monuments, such as the gavit of the Church of the Holy Apostles at Ani. A dedicatory inscription appears on the tympanum:\n\nBy the grace of Christ, I, Vacë, son of Sargis, and my wife Mamaxatun, daughter of Abuserh, we built this hall of relics in this monastery of Horomos, under the prelature of Ter Barsel, son of Amir Erkat', and we gave in present at the library the vineyard that we had bought in Awsakan, for the office and for the relic. And we also gave to the church... in gold and two silver flabellum. In exchange, the monks of this chapter granted us the mass of the first Sunday after Easter in the churches of this place. And we gave further the vineyard of Pasakan hol, and the one who will ensure regularly our masses will have free disposal of wine. Therefore, those who execute this writing will be blessed by God, but if any of us or strangers... hinder our will, may it be accountable for our sins before God!\n\n\n== References ==",

About eight species are predominantly European, with A. muticus (Linnaeus, 1758) previously considered a species group of the genus Baetis (which was subsequently recognised as polyphyletic). The latter is sometimes called the \"iron blue\", although this name is used by anglers to include at least two species in the related genus Nigrobaetis and has a widespread distribution, including the British Isles.\n\n\n== Species ==\nThe Global Biodiversity Information Facility includes:\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Data related to Alainites at Wikispecies",

She is the 2023 Canadian 5000 m champion and represented Canada at the 2023 World Athletics Championships.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBorn and raised in Vancouver, British Columbia, Scott attended West Point Grey Academy before enrolling at McGill University in 2008. While at McGill, she competed for the McGill Martlets women's volleyball team.\nAfter a long hiatus from sports, Scott took up running in 2018. Initially running half-marathons, she quickly improved, running a time of 1:18:21 in June 2019. \nIn 2020, without many races due to the ongoing pandemic, Scott turned to time trials. She ran 4:44 over the mile and later that summer, she improved her time to 4:39.\nIn 2021, Scott began training with the BC Endurance Project and quickly improved her times on the track. On May 29, she ran a time of 15:46.75 over 5000 m at Swangard Stadium in Burnaby. On June 18, she finished second to Malindi Elmore at the Canadian 10,000 m Championships, with a personal best of 33:14.99.\nAfter a year off from competitive running due to the birth of her and her husband Derek's first child, Bennie in 2022, Scott returned to the track in 2023. In her second race of the season on May 6, she set a personal best of 15:40.58 in the 5000 m. The next month, she shaved 15 seconds off that time with a mark of 15:25.77 at the Portland Track Festival. On July 14, she ran another 5000 m, this time taking the win at the Harry Jerome Track Classic in 15:19.51. On July 27, competing at the Canadian Championships, Scott won her first national title, winning the 5000 m in 15:46.72.\nLater that summer, Scott was selected to represent Canada at the 2023 World Athletics Championships in Budapest, Hungary. She ran 15:42.56 in her 5000 m heat. \nIn November, Scott competed at the Pan American Games in Santiago, Chile, placing 7th in the 5000 m.\n\n\n== Competition record ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Goldenberg Mansion is a historic residence built in the 1870s by the Eugsters, a Spanish merchant family. Later, it was revamped in a Moorish Revival style by Jose Moreno Lacalle, a Spanish colonial official and writer, using materials such as Philippine hardwood, pre-fabricated steel from Belgium, Italian marble, and bricks and tiles from Spain.\nNamed after its subsequent owner, Michael Goldenberg, an American businessman who established the Goldenberg Department Store in Escolta. Following Goldenberg's death in 1963, the property was acquired by First Lady Imelda Marcos from his heirs. Subsequently, it became the offices of the Marcos Foundation and served as a guest house after undergoing extensive restoration by National Artist for Architecture Leandro Locsin.\nSince the People Power Revolution of 1986, the mansion has been under the ownership of the Government of the Philippines but remained inaccessible to the public. In 2023, First Lady Liza Araneta Marcos oversaw renovations, and the mansion has now reopened to the public as a cultural center and events space.\n\n\n== Historical background ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe Goldenberg Mansion boasts a rich historical background, dating back to its construction in the 1870s by the Spanish merchant family, the Eugsters, who owned the trading company Eugster, Labhart y Cia. It was later purchased by Jose Moreno Lacalle, a Spanish lawyer, writer, and colonial official who had previously served as the auditor of the Real Audiencia of Manila. Lacalle infused elements of his native region of Granada, heavily incorporating Moorish Revival into the design. The mansion showcases windows from capiz shells, an arcaded veranda, a paved courtyard, and a splashing fountain. It was constructed using indigenous materials such as Philippine hardwood, alongside European materials including pre-fabricated steel from Belgium, marble from Italy, and bricks and tiles from Spain.\n\nOver the course of the next fifty-three years, the house underwent several changes in ownership, being leased to various government and military offices. Between 1897 and 1898, it was rented to the Spanish Navy, serving as the residence for its commanding officer, Admiral Patricio Montojo, and housing the Spanish Navy Club's headquarters. After Admiral Montojo's defeat at the Battle of Manila Bay and the surrender of Manila to the Americans under U.S. Navy Commodore George Dewey, it became the residence of battalion commander General Arthur MacArthur Jr. until his appointment as Military Governor of the Philippines in 1900. In 1901, Governor MacArthur Jr., who was responsible for maintaining public order of the city of Manila, established the Metropolitan Police Force of Manila, with himself as its inaugural chief. The police force was initially stationed on the mansion's grounds.\nFurthermore, it was the inaugural location of the Philippine School of Commerce (now the Polytechnic University of the Philippines) in 1908 and hosted the first session of the Senate of the Philippines in 1916. In 1903, it functioned as the office of the Philippine Preliminary Exposition to the International Exposition in St. Louis, exhibiting artifacts before their transfer to the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in 1904, marking the mansion's initial role as a museum.\nBy 1915, the property was acquired by Ricardo Esteban Barretto, whose family established the San Miguel Brewery. During World War II, it served as the residence of a Japanese general, and post-war, it was converted into a restaurant-nightclub for American troops known as the Ye Olde Mansion.\n\n\n=== Michael Goldenberg and his estate: 1950-1966 ===\nIn 1950, the mansion was acquired by Michael Goldenberg (1889–1963), an American businessman of French-Jewish descent and philanthropist who initially arrived in the Philippines as a young boy in 1896. Goldenberg amassed his wealth in retail, founding the Goldenberg Department Store situated in Escolta and holding exclusive distribution rights in the Philippines for distributing Helene Curtis beauty products.\nGoldenberg was also a keen stamp collector and a trailblazer in organised philately in the Philippines. He amassed a collection of over 4000 books, journals, maps, old photographs, pamphlets, and other ephemera on the Philippines. Subsequently, he established the Goldenberg Filipiniana Library, a private institution dedicated to the study of Philippine history and culture. Consequently, the mansion came to be known as the Goldenberg Mansion.\n\n\n=== Imelda Marcos: 1966-1986 ===\nIn 1966, the Goldenberg Mansion was acquired by the First Lady of the Philippines, Imelda Marcos, from the heirs of Michael Goldenberg. Subsequently, the Philippine architect Leandro Locsin was commissioned to undertake an extensive restoration and renovation of the interiors. The mansion was later renamed Ang Maharlika and served as the office and guest house of the Marcos Foundation.\nIn addition to the Goldenberg Mansion's library, the mansion showcased Imelda Marcos's extensive art collection. It housed a significant collection of oriental ceramics and artefacts, including Chinese jade furniture, excavated porcelain and pottery, and Ban Chiang pottery from Thailand.\nThe living room featured wood filigree arches and chandeliers. Its interiors showcased tapestries depicting Diana the Huntress and a \"Della Robbia\" style mirror, once belonging to Catherine de Medici, while Persian rugs adorned the floors. Several paintings by the American artist Grandma Moses and a 16th-century European devotional altar adorned with ivory figures depicting the life and martyrdom of Catherine of Alexandria.\nAfter the fall of the Marcos dictatorship in 1986, ownership of the Goldenberg Mansion and other properties within the Malacañang Palace complex transferred to the Philippine Government, with restricted public access. In 2019, the Sandiganbayan forfeited the collection of Grandma Moses paintings that were found at the Goldenberg Mansion in favour of the Government.\n\n\n== Reopened as the Goldenberg Mansion Cultural Center ==\nOn May 12, 2023, President Bongbong Marcos issued Executive Order No. 26 to conserve and protect cultural heritage sites around Malacañang Palace, including the Teus Mansion and the Goldenberg Mansion. The supervision of these properties was transferred to the Social Secretary's Office from the former Office of the Deputy Executive Secretary for General Administration.\nFollowing the initiative of First Lady Liza Araneta Marcos, the Goldenberg Mansion underwent renovation to be made into a cultural center and events space from 2022 to 2023. In addition, a glass house was added on the grounds of the Goldenberg Mansion which was designed and conceptualized by interior designer Jonathan G. Matti.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMalacañang Heritage Mansions – The Goldenberg Mansion",

Elections were held for the metropolitan municipal mayor of Bursa, as well as district mayors and councillors of Bursa's 17 districts.\nThe governing People's Alliance, formed by the Justice and Development Party (AK Party) and the smaller Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), nominated incumbent Mayor Alinur Aktaş for re-election. The opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) nominated Mustafa Bozbey, who had also been their candidate for the 2019 local elections but had narrowly lost to Aktaş.\nThe result was a victory for Bozbey, who won 47.6% of the vote compared to Aktaş's 38.4%. The CHP also doubled their number of district municipalities from three to six, while the AK Party lost three municipalities. This was the first time the AK Party lost control of Bursa since their first ever local elections in 2004.\n\n\n== Opinion polls ==\n\n\n== References ==",

It remained inactive for two years since its formation. The PHA was not fully functional due to lack of required regulations including business rules, service rules, and certificate mark regulation etc., which prevented Pakistan from tapping the huge potential of the international halal market. It took one and a half years for the DG of PHA to open the bank account of PHA.\n\n\n== References ==",

It includes the singles \"I Go\", \"(It Goes Like) Nanana\", \"I Believe in Love Again\" with Lenny Kravitz, and \"1+1=11\". The album will also include a collaboration with Villano Antillano.\n\n\n== Background and themes ==\nGou called I Hear You \"more than just [her] debut album\" as she felt it \"embodies countless hours of dedication in [her] journey to create something timeless\". The album was influenced by 1990s house music.Gou released \"1+1=11\" as a single alongside the album's announcement in April 2024, which is intended to represent the album's running theme of \"togetherness\". Gou collaborated with Icelandic–Danish artist Olafur Eliasson on the video for \"1+1=11\", and he also designed the angled mirrors she wears around her ears on the cover art, and contributed his poem \"Your Planet Seen from Within\" to the first track, \"Your Art\".\n\n\n== Singles ==\nThe album includes Gou's 2021 single \"I Go\", as well as her most successful track, 2023's \"(It Goes Like) Nanana\". In addition to also including her collaboration with Lenny Kravitz, \"I Believe in Love Again\", Gou issued the intended lead single, \"1+1=11\", in April 2024.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Eddie Billimoria (1900 – 18 February 1981) was an Indian actor and music director.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nEddie Billimoria was born in 1900 at Kirkee, a cantonment area near Poona. His father worked at an ordinance factory. During his initial days, he worked as a projectionist in a cinema hall and installed projection equipments in around a thousand cinema halls all over the country.

Soon enough, Eddie started playing bit-parts in a few silent films.\n\n\n== Career ==\nEddie's first film had his brother  playing the lead role. Playing a side character, Billimoria started off his journey in Hindi cinema with Punjab Mail.\nThe coming of talkies proved to be a turning point in his career and propelled it forward. Films from Imperial had him being paired with Sulochana, Sultana and Ermeline. Chandulal Shah's Ranjit Studios saw him pairing with Miss Gohar, Bibbo and Madhuri. Some of his films at Ranjit are Baghdad Ka Badmash, Rough of Rajasthan and Toofani Taruni.

        "content": "Essays on Empathy is a 2021 video game compilation by Spanish independent developer Deconstructeam and published by Devolver Digital. The game contains ten short \"interactive stories\", including one new title, De Tres al Cuarto, developed specifically for the compilation. Following the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, which negatively impacted the development team, the compilation was created as a side project to provide greater focus for the studio's previous shorter titles, many created for game jams. Upon release, Essays on Empathy received generally favorable reviews, with critics praising the game's ambitious narrative approach, treatment of complex themes, and additional making-of features, whilst critiquing the short duration of games and the absence of bugfixes and quality of life features.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nEssays on Empathy is an anthology of ten games developed and released by Deconstructeam, with the exception of one title, De Tres Al Cuarto, being a new work created for the game. Games are presented in a menu, with each being playable in any order. Selecting a game allows players to access a submenu that contains the game and an accompanying soundtrack, production sketches and documentary outlining the creation of the game.\n\n\n=== List of games ===\n\n\n== Development ==\nEssays on Empathy was developed by Valencia studio Deconstructeam, a trio of writer and designer Jordi de Paco, artist Marina González and musician Paula Ruiz. The compilation, containing titles developed between 2015 and 2021, had the stated aim of giving the studio's short games a wider audience, as they had received less attention. The compilation was assembled as a side project and \"therapeutic\" exercise during a creative hiatus for the studio, who had paused work on a larger title, The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood due to the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, which had a negative psychological impact on the developers. The title of the compilation was set to reflect the \"different characters\" depicted in the various games and the overarching design process of the studio, with de Paco discussing that the team began purposefully developing games with a \"heavy\" narrative focus over time to explore complex situations or questions that require the player to \"put themselves into the game\". Most of the games for Essays on Empathy were previously developed and released for short-term game jams including the Ludum Dare, with the games largely presented as they were originally released in terms of content. The compilation was announced on 30 April 2021 with the release of an announcement trailer for release on May 18.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nEssays on Empathy received \"generally favorable\" reviews upon release, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Critics generally praised the narrative and themes of the various games in the compilation. Laura Luna of MeriStation considered the narrative design to be the \"strong point\" of the game in its sensitive and natural treatment of \"social and intimate themes\", considering them to explore diverse perspectives from \"an enriching and authentic perspective\". Harvard Liu of Digitally Downloaded discussed the compilation's games to each explore a narrative of \"coping\" and balance a tone of humor and poignancy. Marina Delgreco of Game Rant considered the games to be \"poignant\" and also confronting due to the \"heavy subject matter\", providing players with a chance to \"step into the shoes of people different from them and understand them a bit better than before\". Eurogamer found the games to explore \"terribly real\" themes in a \"raw and truthful\" manner, although finding the concepts were not fully matured due to the short length and development periods of the individual titles. Similarly, many critics acknowledged that the games, developed during game jams, were limited in their scope as short experiences, with Amy Campbell of The Escapist considering the games to improve in the order of chronological release and some to be \"a tad too simple\".\nDe Tres Al Cuarto received specific praise as a standalone release and highlight of the compilation. Describing the game as a \"fresh, original interactive story\", PC Gamer UK commended the game's \"mature\" depiction of an established gay relationship and its \"vividly drawn\" and \"believable\" characters. However, the magazine also found the comedy sections to be less effective due to the sound design and poor distinction between the successful and unsuccessful jokes. Harvard Liu of Digitally Downloaded considered the deckbuilding mechanic to effectively \"communicate aspiration rather than strategy\", with the game's diminishing returns on its strategy mechanics over time conveying deeper \"questions of value and self-worth\". Laura Luna of MeriStation assessed that De Tres Al Cuarto was the \"most refined\" work of the compilation, describing the game's depiction of the couple's intimate moments as a \"very human\" romantic dilemma. Manu Delgado of Vandal wrote that the game demonstrated the \"mastery\" of the studio in \"giving life to unique characters interacting in credible situations narrated from the familiarity of more or less everyday scenes\".\nThe game's behind-the-scenes additions were also generally praised. Harvard Liu of Digitally Downloaded found the collection \"shines a light on craft and deepens the connection between player and developer\". Laura Luna of MeriStation stated that the features providing \"interesting\" context for the player to understand \"certain artistic decisions and the reason for experimenting with certain mechanics\". Manu Delgado of Vandal strongly praised the content as demonstrating \"unusual\" levels of \"honesty\" and \"transparency\" in the studio's creative approach \"rarely seen\" in documentaries about video games. However, Delgado also considered the presentation of the features to lack accessibility due to the \"poorly readable\" menu text and lack of playback controls on videos.\nSeveral reviewers identified that the game had bugs and quality of life issues due to the games being presented in the state they were at upon release. Checkpoint Gaming noted that all games lacked menus, save states and pause functions, although considered these issues to be of \"little consequence\" and assisted in making players to commit to the gameplay experience. Harvard Liu of Digitally Downloaded speculated the game's technical issues reflected their packaging \"exactly as they were at the end of their respective game jams, with UI quirks and typos left in\". Non-English sources also lamented the game did not include localistation.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

It is published by Tokuma Shoten under the Chara Bunko imprint, with Rikako Kasai providing the illustrations. Following the novels' initial releases, Nagira continued the series, which is serialized in the bimonthly magazine Shosetsu Chara beginning with the magazine's vol. 41 released on November 22, 2019.\nIn a 2021 interview with Da Vinci, Nagira stated that she and her editors had expected My Beautiful Man to end in only one volume. Nagira expressed surprise at how well-received Hira was as a character because of his \"creepy\" personality, as she had assumed readers of the boys' love genre preferred characters and settings that \"reflected their desires.\" Nagira also stated that because of how well-received Hira was to her audience, she was able to subvert other boys' love tropes, particularly with how Kiyoi gains 20 kg. for a movie role in the third volume. While Hira was written to be \"creepy\", Nagira felt that the readers of the BL genre were able to sympathize with him because they understood the feeling of supporting idols.\nTokyopop licensed the novels for English-language distribution in North America as part of their LoveLove imprint.\n\n\n=== Audio drama ===\nGinger Records released a series of audio dramas on CD adapting each volume of the novel. The CD drama stars Yūki Ono as Kazunari Hira, Soma Saito as Sou Kiyoi, Yu Miyazaki as Shirota, Shun Horie as Kazuki Koyama, Toshiyuki Morikawa as Hiromi Noguchi, Shinichiro Miki as Hideki Ueda. The first volume was released on June 28, 2019. The second volume was released on July 23, 2021. A special version of the CD included a bonus CD adapting the chapter \"Moon Age 14.\" The third volume was released on April 21, 2023, and peaked at no. 34 on the Oricon Weekly Albums Chart on its first week of release.\nFor their roles, Ono wanted to express Hira with \"delicacy and detail\", stating that he consulted the sound director about Hira's stuttering. Saito described that there was a \"gap\" between how Hira views Kiyoi and Kiyoi's true self, so he took care to portray the balance between them. Horie stated he paid attention in portraying Koyama's \"human side\", particularly in the scene where he cries because he is in love with Hira.\n\n\n=== Television drama ===\nOn October 12, 2021, a live-action television drama series adaptation was announced. The series was broadcast for 6 episodes from November 19, 2021, to June 15, 2023, on MBS on their programming block Drama Tokku.

Nagira praised the cast in a 2021 interview, stating that she was initially concerned as she felt the success of the drama adaptation depended on the actor cast for Kiyoi. She also speculated that the \"deciding factor\" for Riku Hagiwara being cast as Hira may have been his eyes. Hagiwara focused on conveying his feelings through his eyes and facial expressions, and Yagi consciously tried to focus on having \"beautiful\" behavior, finding it difficult to portray the change in Kiyoi after meeting Hira.\nThe supporting cast includes Akira Takano as Kazuki Koyama, Yuto Tsubone as Shirota, Kento Sakurai as Miki, Momoka as Momo, Aya Marsh as Shima, and Shuri Nakamura as Kurata.

On March 1, 2023, Kentaro Maeda was added to the cast as Kiriya Kiritani, and Dai Ikeda was added to the cast as Koda. The opening theme song is \"Bitter\" by Rosu, and the ending theme song is \"Kinmokusei\" by Mosawo.

        "content": "Bad for Me is the debut studio album by American country music singer Chayce Beckham. It was released on April 5, 2024, via Wheelhouse. \"23\" was issued in January 2023 as the lead single, and became Beckham's first number one hit on the Billboard Country Airplay chart.\n\n\n== Background ==\nBart Butler produced the album, with the exception of \"23\", which Ross Copperman produced. Beckham wrote or co-wrote nine of the album's 13 tracks, citing influence from the likes of Townes Van Zandt, Blaze Foley, George Strait, and George Jones. He described his goal with the album: \"Hopefully somebody who needs to hear one of these songs gets to hear it. If it just gets to one person who needs to hear one of these songs to feel better or get them through whatever they're going through, that's always been my mission and my end goal with music. It’s helped me out so much and made me feel so much better when I was having a hard time. I just hope that it can get out to the people who need it and it can change people’s lives like it changed mine. That's all I can ask for.\"\n\"23\" was released as the lead single. It reached number one on the Billboard Country Airplay chart dated April 6, 2024, making it the first country number one to be written solely by the artist who performed it since Taylor Swift's \"Ours\" in March 2012.\n\"Everything I Need\" will be released as the second single on April 29, 2024.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Caterina Vozzi is an Italian physicist, Professor and Director of the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche Istituto di Fotonica e Nanotecnologie. Her research considers the ultrafast dynamics of molecules and solids. She holds a European Research Council grant to develop spectroscopic probes for complex molecules. She was awarded the Millie Dresselhaus Professorship in 2020.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nVozzi was an undergraduate student and graduate researcher at the University of Milan. She joined the National Research Council, where she spent four years as a postdoctoral researcher. She worked alongside Paul Corkum at the National Research Council Canada Steacie Institute for Molecular Sciences.\n\n\n== Research and career ==\nIn 2005 Vozzi was made Professor of Physics at the University of Milan. She joined the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche Istituto di Fotonica e Nanotecnologie in 2009, where she was made Professor in 2012. She develops ultrafast techniques (X-ray and Terahertz time-domain spectorscopy) to understand biomolecules and materials. Based on table-top harmonic generation, she has created new sources for ultrashort (attosecond) pulses for transient absorption spectroscopy that are in the soft X-ray range. She uses table-top high harmonic generation. Measurements with these pulses give temporal and spatial information about dynamic processes, and are sensitive to specific oxidation/spin states or elements. X-ray measurements near specific absorption edges (e.g. the Carbon K-edge) provides information of the structural and electronic environment of atoms within the sample.\nSingle-cycle coherent terahertz pulses can be generated using nonlinear crystals and infrared laser pulses. THz pulses are detected (amplitude, phase) using electro-optic systems and the Pockels effect. These measurements provide information about the dielectric response (real and imaginary), uncovering physical and chemical information.\nVozzi has used optical parametric amplification to create high energy mid-IR light sources for attosecond science. These provide mJ energy, pulse durations equivalent to a few optical cycles and carrier–envelope phase stability, making them ideal for high harmonic generation. She has exploited high harmonic generation to create bright XUV sources. She showed that high harmonic generation tomography and laser-induced electron diffraction to perform time-resolved dynamic imaging of complex molecular materials. Single attosecond pulses in the few hundred eV spectral region) can be generated by manipulating the laser polarisation.\n\n\n== Select publications ==\nG. Sansone; E. Benedetti; F. Calegari; et al.

        "content": "James McKay Redmond (September 14, 1901 – December 21, 1944) was an American painter, muralist, and printmaker active in Los Angeles in the 1920s and 1930s. His prismatic colors and sinuous lines were admired by the critics of his day and his New Deal-era murals are considered particularly fine exemplars of the genre. A leader in the local art community, he succeeded his mentor Stanton MacDonald-Wright as a director of the progressive and influential Art Students League of Los Angeles and steered the organization through the Great Depression. During World War II, he enlisted in the U.S. Army, and landed at Omaha Beach in Normandy, France on D-Day with his battalion of combat engineers. Redmond was killed in action four days before Christmas 1944 during the German counteroffensive into the Ardennes Forest known as the Battle of the Bulge.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nRedmond was born in 1901 in Grand Rapids, a city in western Michigan. He was the firstborn of four children of William Redmond, a printer, and his wife Carrie McKay. Redmond moved to Southern California in 1912. He completed two years of high school education. By 1920 Redmond lived in Redondo Beach in the South Bay region of greater Los Angeles.\n\n\n=== Art career ===\nRedmond started studying with Staunton Macdonald-Wright at the Art Students League of Los Angeles by 1926. He was considered \"one of the most talented of Macdonald-Wright's disciples\". Herman Cherry later recalled the era in an article for Arts magazine:\n\nThe school Stanton MacDonald Wright organized in the 1920s, the Art Students League of Los Angeles, located in downtown Los Angeles, was the closest thing in L. A. history to [a central] meeting ground. Wright returned from Europe in the 1920s, bringing with him some of the fire of battle from the avant-garde wars of Paris, and although later he was to reject it and retire into a cloister of orientalism, for a time he was an important force for artists in the area. Classes at his school met on Tuesday and Thursday evenings; he taught a form of synchromy, as well as sketching from the model, and he gave analyses and lectures on the art of the past. Out of these came the Saturday night get-togethers with one member or another cooking the meal. Somewhat like the New York \"artists' club,\" it attracted people from the allied arts, writers, singers, actors, composers and others who had something interesting to contribute. Collectors like Frank Stevens or Jack Wells, who were buying Wright's and Morgan Russell's paintings at that time, were also beginning to buy the works of such younger painters as James Redmond, Al King, and Fred Sexton.\nBy 1928 or 1929, Redmond was doing scenery painting for the Santa Monica Theater Guild alongside Macdonald-Wright and Art Students League members Carl Winter and Albert King. Redmond and King were the co-founders of what was called the Younger Artists Group that exhibited together between 1928 and 1932, at Barnsdall Park Art Center, the Los Angeles Museum, Santa Monica Public Library, and the Hollywood Library. The Younger Artists described themselves as \"young in a sense of growth\" but exhibited \"advanced and mature\" artworks.\n\nAfter Macdonald-Wright resigned as president of the Art Students' League of Los Angeles, Redmond took over, maintaining the group's studio on Spring Street above the Lyceum Theater between Second and Third, and adeptly administering the organization. Beginning in June 1932, Redmond scheduled classes and models, and collected fees, and even lived in the studio for a time, no doubt to keep his personal expenses down during the financial doldrums of the Great Depression. Around this time the art critic for the Los Angeles Times wrote, \"Starting with the style of his teacher, S. Macdonald-Wright, Redmond has developed something of his own...Redmond begins to seem more essentially a painter than does his master...Redmond grows in esteem as his works are repeatedly studied\". \nUnder Macdonald-Wright's influence, Redmond began studying Asian art styles, history, and philosophy. Redmond \"maintained close friendships with Asian American artists\" and became fluent in both Japanese and Chinese. One of the ways he attempted to increase enrollment was by advertising in the local Japanese-language newspaper Kashū Mainichi. Circa 1935 he began working on prints with lithographer Lynton Kistler.\n\nIn addition to exhibiting widely in California, Redmond had pieces shown at the Carl Fischer Art Gallery in New York, when he was featured in the Ten Pacific Coast Painters exhibit along with Macdonald-Wright, Nick Brigante, Conrad Buff, Thomas Craig, Charles H. David, Barse Miller, Phyllis Shields, and Vivian Stringfield.\nRedmond painted a wide array of subjects, including landscapes, portraits and figures, still lifes, and botanicals, but he particularly drew compliment from Los Angeles Times art critic Arthur Millier (and others) for his pictures of cats. Millier later called Siamese Cat the \"finest canvas\" at Redmond's memorial show, with \"sheerly beautiful composition\" and \"strong color harmony\". He also noted a watercolor called Turtle and Narcissus, and a picture of a nude figure lying in a \"rich-colored landscape\". \n\n\n==== New Deal projects ====\nRedmond was hired for several New Deal art projects in California, including the early Public Works of Art Project and the Treasury Department's Section of Painting and Sculpture. Redmond's work (likely an easel painting or lithograph) was included in the Public Works of Art Project exhibitions at the Los Angeles Museum, the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, D.C., and at the Whitney in New York. \nIn 1938 Redmond was hired by the Federal Art Project's Community Art Center program to teach art and serve as director of the Butte Art Center in Montana. He worked there for a \"few months\" before returning to California.   \nRedmond also produced artworks for Phineas Banning Junior High School, in Wilmington, California, San Pedro High School, and a 600 sq ft (56 m2) triptych mural on the history of science for Manual Arts High School that was exhibited, prior to installation, at the Los Angeles county museum in Exposition Park in 1939. According to Artists in California, 1786–1940 by Edan Milton Hughes, other Redmond commissions during New Deal were done for the Compton post office in Los Angeles County, the Santa Paula post office in Ventura County, and the San Diego Art Museum.\n\n\n==== Early California ====\n\nRedmond is probably best known today for the mural Early California that he painted for the U.S. post office building in downtown Compton, California, opposite the Compton station of the A Line (Los Angeles Metro) light rail, which at the time of painting in 1936 would have been a station of Pacific Electric's Long Beach Line streetcars. Chaffey College art history professor Orville Clarke wrote in 1998 that \"One of the most beautiful sets of mural panels executed under government sponsorship during the depression is James Redmond's panels for the Compton Post Office. Unfortunately, because of their location, they are also one of the least visited sites, which is a pity since they are so captivating in person\". The curators of a 2008 exhibit on the Art Students League wrote that Early California \"clearly shows the resonance of the League...employs an Asian-influenced landscape by way of his study at the League, and uses flat, brilliant color patterns that evince his careful study of modernism\".\nRedmond was assisted in his painting which primarily occurred at the League building, by Donald Totten and Valentine Costello. The piece covers all four walls of the lobby, including a 55-foot (17-meter)-long main panel opposite the front door. The subject matter is the \"history of early California, particularly the Los Angeles area\" including portraits of Spanish colonial explorers and missionaries, Fermín de Lasuén, Gaspar de Portolá, Junípero Serra, and Juan Bautista de Anza. Redmond was conscious of Compton's history, including its history as part of Rancho San Pedro, did extensive research for the mural, writing program administrators that \"I am using every source of reference procurable in early pictures, museums and histories of the period to furnish data for authentic details of racial types, clothing and equipment, such as saddles, bridles, etc.\" California travel writer Brad Nixon comments that Redmond's conscientious approach is evident in the final product: \"Those people have 'weight.' They look like they're standing, kneeling on the ground or sitting in the saddle; they're not floating. And they're working, pointing, posed convincingly. I don't doubt that Mr. Redmond researched the clothing, tools and horse-drawn vehicles\".\nEarly California is also recognized for Redmond's skillful design and use of color: a \"high key palette that turns the room into a kaleidoscope of colors\" as \"the eye is carried around by a complex pattern of diagonals. He holds the entire painting together by his use of greens of various hues. Redmond takes a complex arrangement and makes it look deceptively simple. It is through this masterful handling of color and form that Redmond is able to unify the entire room and capture our attention.\" Federal art program administrator Bernard Roufberg was also complimentary of Redmond's work: \"Unlike many mural painters, Redmond makes a rough sketch of his design and color, and then works on his mural making changes as he progresses, rather than making a finely finished design and then 'blowing it up' to size as he puts it. His mural is one of the handsomest things I have ever seen and to me it looked like a jewel\".\n\n\n=== World War II ===\nBy the 1940s, Redmond was considered a notable Los Angeles \"artist of the modern school\". When the United States entered World War II, Redmond enlisted in the U.S. Army in November 1942, even though \"he was nearing the age limit of 41\". Having refused an assignment as an interpreter, Redmond was attached to the 299th Combat Engineer Battalion. He was serving as a corporal at the Desert Training Center when his son was born in Newhall in spring 1943.  \nRedmond was part of a unit that landed on Omaha Beach on D-Day. An interview with Staff Sergeant Redmond is one of the primary sources for the description of the assault on Fox Green sector in the U.S. Army's history of the combat engineers in the European Theater:\n\nTeam 15 touched down at 0640, just as the tide began rising rapidly, and lost several men to machine gun fire before they left the LCM. In a now common occurrence, they sustained more casualties when a shell found the rubber boat with its volatile load. The survivors nevertheless attacked the Belgian gates farthest from shore and fixed charges to several. The fusillade from shore cut away fuses as rapidly as the engineers could rig them. One burst of fragments carried away a fuseman's carefully set mechanism—and all of his fingers. With no choice but to make for shore, they ran, only four of their original 40 uninjured, to the low shingle bank on Fox Green, where they collapsed, \"soaking wet, unable to move, and suffering from cramps. It was cold and there was no sun.\" [Interv, S/Sgt James M. Redmond, Team 15, Notes and Data, Neptune.]\nAfter successfully overwhelming the German defenders at Normandy, Redmond and the rest of the 299th continued moving through Fortress Europe for the next six months, clearing junk, salvaging vehicles, and building bridges over assorted rivers on the road to Hitler's headquarters in Germany. Redmond fought with his unit for six months after D-Day before he was killed in the vicinity of Witry, outside Martelange, Belgium, in the early morning hours of December 21, 1944. Amidst the German counteroffensive along the Belgium–Luxembourg border near the Sauer River, Redmond's group had been tasked with recapturing the town of Martelange. According to the regimental history of the 299th in World War II, \"Captain Manion planned to attack Martelange at dawn, and a patrol had been sent out to contact Lieutenant Jenkins' force. Food, medical supplies, and a radio set with operators from the 127th Engineer Combat Battalion were sent forward with an officer from that organization. Contact was made only twice with these men. All personnel sent forward at that time were later reported missing in action. It was later confirmed that these men never reached the Witry [command post].\" When the 299th was finally relieved and reunited on December 26, a count found that 41 of their number had gone missing during the action in southeastern Belgium. Redmond was reported missing in his local newspaper, the Saugus Signal of Santa Clarita Valley, on January 15, 1945.\nRedmond's body was not identified until March 1945, at which time his widow was notified that he had been killed in action. Confirmation of his death was made public in June 1945. In July 1945, Albert King, who had been a part of the Art Students' League of Los Angeles, organized a memorial art show featuring 27 of Redmond's artworks. In 1946, Redmond's name was included on the World War II honor roll of the American Legion post in Saugus, California.\nRedmond is buried at Ardennes American Cemetery near Neupré, Belgium, in plot D, row 6. His decorations include a Bronze Star and the French Croix de Guerre.\n\n\n== Additional images ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of United States post office murals § California\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nHall, Robert H.

        "content": "Operation Gunung Gede (Indonesian: Operasi Gunung Gede Pangrango) was an Indonesian marines and KKO-AL military operation to hunt down and repel the DI/TII Kartosuwiryo gang hiding in Gunung Gede Pangrango in 1957. After Operation Indra in the Indramayu, West Java area in March 1953, namely in an effort to help the local Unity to defeat the DI/TII gangs Kartosuwiryo from the sea. So for the second time the KKO-AL unit has taken part in the same security operation. The operation codenamed \"Operasi Gunung gede \", this operation took place from March 19, 1957, to March 24, 1957. The operation was carried out based on verbal orders from the KSAL which was then followed by a telegram KSAL 18-13 -30 March 1957/079, namely to second 2 Platoons of KKO-AL Troops to the 8-TT Infantry Regiment III, in the context of Security Operations.\n\n\n== Preparation ==\nFor assignments in this Security Operation, a KKO-AL Combat Organization has been prepared with a strength of 2 reinforced platoons (1 Company), with the Company Commander Captain KKO Boy Abidin Nrp.546/P. Meanwhile, the platoon composition is as follows: 1st Platoon under the leadership of Lt.KKO. Pratowo Soedibyo Nrp.698/P and Platoon II under the leadership of Lt.KKO Soegijo Nrp.755/P. and target areas have been determined\naround Mount Gede Pangrango, West Java.\n\n\n== Tasks ==\nIn accordance with the Navy KKO Commander's Order No.079/SP/KKO/57, dated March 18, 1957, the duties of the Navy KKO Troops are as follows:\n\nAssist the 8-TT.III Infantry Regiment Unit in its efforts to destroy the power of the DI/TII gang Kartosuwiryo.\nCarry out clean-up operations against gang units that are separated from their parent.\n\n\n== Implementation ==\nThe Gunung Gede operation was carried out based on the Regimental Operations Order dated 19 March 1957, in just a few days, namely from 19 March 1957 to 24 March 1957. In short, the implementation of this operation was because the Mission (Task) assigned to the KKO-AL Troops had been can be achieved where gang activities around Mount Pangrango can be suppressed and neutralized. On March 19, 1957, KKO-AL troops arrived in Sukabumi and then immediately reported to the Commander of the 8.TT.III Infantry Regiment and to the 311th Army Battalion which at that time was carrying out operational duties. After reporting themselves, the KKOAL troops continued their movement to Cipanas and to Cibodas, in Cibodas this was the new Lt.KKO. Prawoto Soedibjo as Danton I explained to the members the purpose\nthan his arrival in the area. March 20, 1957 KKO-AL Troops together with a CI Bn. 311 began moving to the high areas around Cibodas with the intention of looking for gang nests according to information obtained from local officers, but apparently during this movement no gangs were found at all, only former gang huts were found.\nonly, which had just been abandoned by the mob, then the troops rested (overnight) on the slopes of Mount Pangrango and Mount Gede. The next day, March 21, 1957, the troops continued their movement to the top of Mount Pangrango, the journey continued to approach with closed terrain and the air was constantly foggy with very cold air. Then the gang ran away, leaving behind several victims. During the battle, important documents were seized which were then handed over to the 8th Infantry Regiment in Sukabumi.\nThe success of this attack was due to a sudden ambush carried out by the KKO-AL Unit where the gang had no idea that an attack would occur. This was proven when the KKOAL troops approached the gang's nest to a distance of 15 meters, and this was the opportunity for an intensive attack, so that in such a situation, the mob panicked and was devastated and left behind victims and others who were not able to run away. Furthermore, KKO-AL troops continued to pursue the remains\nThe hordes fled to Pasir Datar and finally the troops were able to reach Ciheuleng Waterfall. And it was here on March 23, 1957, that a second battle occurred with the DI/TII Kartosuwiryo gang, the battle lasted approximately 10 minutes. With a quick and sure movement the mob was finally repulsed. The horde retreated to the north where there were many mountains and wild forests. With the completion of the battle at Curug Ciheuleng, the troops moved south to Pasir Datar and it turned out that during this last movement there was no armed contact. In accordance with the order issued by the 8.TT III Siliwangi Infantry Regiment, the movement of the Navy KKO Troops ended here at 20.00\nevening the troops returned to Sukabumi. From Sukabumi that same night at 22.00 the troops continued to return to Jakarta carried by 7 TNI AD trucks. And finally arrived in Jakarta safely at 03.00 in the morning (24 March 1957).\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nKKO-AL succeeded in killing several members of the DI/TII gang and confiscating documents during two battles.\nKKO-AL has gained new experience in carrying out operations in inland and mountainous areas with densely forested terrain and quite cold weather. The weather in this operational area is always filled with thick fog and this means that the troops have to be careful in carrying out their movements apart from losing sight of the front and surroundings, also because the road taken by the troops has to climb and descend, the road itself has never been crossed by humans. However, the KKO-AL troops who carried out the operation were still able to carry out their duties and obligations both day and night and did not know the hard work and difficulty of the journey they had to make during the movement from Cibodas to Pasir Datar, so that the enemy (the gang) did not suspect anything at all. that KKO-AL troops would arrive at their place and attack their defenses. This proves that KKO-AL troops are not only capable of carrying out landing operations in coastal areas, but even in security operations in inland and mountainous areas with bad forest and weather conditions, KKO-AL is capable and able to do it well.\n\n\n== References ==",

The tumulus was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 2001.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Ainoshima Stone Tumuli consist of total of 254 stone mounds made entirely of basalt gravel are distributed in the northeastern part of Ainoshima, along a coastline extending approximately 500 meters from north-to-south. It was discovered in 1992. This group of stone mounds are mainly small circular or rectangular tombs with a diameter of about three to five meters, but there are also some that are two-tiered with a side of 12 meters, and others that have their main parts dug directly into the ground. No grave markers or border marks the site, and it is unknown how much of the original site remains. The main internal features include a vertical stone burial chambers containing a box-type sarcophagus, or a side-pit type stone burial chamber. Most were constructed from the first half of the 5th century to the middle of the 6th century, but the earliest construction can definitely be traced back to the early Kofun period. On the opposite shore in the northeast direction from this site, is the Munakata area, where many burial mounds from the same period are concentrated, and it is possible to assume that there is a connection there, as well as connections with the Korean Peninsula.\nA variety of artifacts have been unearthed, including numerous grave goods, iron products, and human bones. It is theorized that the tombs belong to the Kaijin tribe, who lived mainly lived in the coastal areas of Chikuzen Province and Hizen Province (as well as the southern coast of the Korean Peninsula]] during the Yayoi period. The Kaijin, whom some researchers theorize migrated to this area from southeastern China or the South Pacific in prehistoric times, practiced rice cultivation, used bronze tools, and are presumed to have excellent navigation and fishing skills. They became powerful through maritime transportation from the 4th century onwards, and were eventually assimilated into Japanese, but much about them remains unknown.\nIt is also said that the stones used in the stone chambers of the Tsuyazaki Kofun Cluster in Fukutsu, Fukuoka, and Munakata City, which were built during the same period, were transported from here.\nThe site is approximately a 30-minute walk from the Ainoshima Ferry Terminal.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Fukuoka)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Ainoshima Stone Tumuli at Wikimedia Commons\n\nCultural Properties of Fukuoka(in Japanese)\nFukuoka Tourism Web(in Japanese)\nShingi Town home page(in Japanese)",

        "content": "Local elections took place in İzmir, the third largest city of Turkey, on 31 March 2024, as part of nationwide local elections. A metropolitan municipal mayor was elected alongside mayors and councillors for the districts of İzmir.\nThe governing People's Alliance, formed of the Justice and Development Party (AK Party) and the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), fielded AK Party Member of Parliament Hamza Dağ as their candidate. Incumbent Mayor Tunç Soyer, from the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), was not nominated to stand for re-election. Soyer claimed that the decision was politically motivated as he had backed Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu for CHP party leader instead of the eventual winner Özgür Özel during the party's leadership convention in November 2023. The CHP, which was not part of any electoral alliance, instead nominated Cemil Tugay, the District Mayor of Karşıyaka, one of İzmir's most populous and central districts.\nThe result was a landslide victory for the Republican People's Party (CHP), for which İzmir has traditionally been seen as a stronghold. Tugay was elected with 49% of the vote compared to Dağ's 37%. Throughout İzmir's districts, the CHP won all but two mayoralties, with the AK Party and MHP each winning one.\n\n\n== Opinion polls ==\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n=== Metropolitan municipality mayoral election ===\n\n\n==== Overall result ====\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Xu Shiheng (simplified Chinese: 许世亨; traditional Chinese: 許世亨; pinyin: Xǔ Shìhēng; Wade–Giles: Hsü Shih-heng; ?–1789) was a general in the Qing dynasty.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early career ===\nXu, a Hui Muslim from Xindu, Chengdu, took part in the Imperial martial art exams and later served in the wars in Tibet and Taiwan. Originally served as a mounted cavalry soldier, he was awarded to the position of Bazong (7th rank General) of the Green Standard Army, before getting promoted to the position of Shoubei (5th rank General) a few years later. In 1771, the second Jinchuan campaigns took place as the Qing sought to suppress the ethnic rebellion in the territory; Xu Shiheng was dispatched to the frontline, where he gained fame with his military achievements, thus promoted him to the Peacock rank (3rd General) of Lieutenant-General. After Jinchuan was pacified in 1776, Xu won promotion to the rank of 2nd General in Tengyue in Yunnan before becoming the General of Weining in Guizhou.\n\nIn 1787, a major rebellion broke out in Taiwan. Xu Shiheng was sent to the island to capture the rebels' leader, Lin Shuangwen. His military merit was further enhanced by his ferocious conquest and ability to convince the local population to join his rank against the rebels. During the conquest, he managed to capture another rebels' leader, Zhuang Datian, in a combined effort using the navy and the land force. After the rebellion was ended in 1788, Emperor Qianlong wrote his essay, praising Xu Shiheng for his contribution and awarded him the title \"Jianyong Baturu\". He was later appointed Governor of Guangxi before being appointed for the job as the Governor of Zhejiang.\n\n\n=== Death ===\nBefore he could take up the rank as Zhejiang Governor, however, news broke out that the Tây Sơn rebellion reached northern Vietnam and toppled the Later Lê dynasty. Maximising from the ongoing chaos in Đại Việt and pleas from the last King of the dynasty, Lê Chiêu Thống, Qianlong authorised an expedition to Vietnam, in which Xu obliged to follow under the lead of Sun Shiyi. This decision proved to be costly for his life, as in the Chinese New Year of 1789 (25 January), Nguyễn Huệ suddenly launched a major assault. There, the Qing army suffered a massive military loss and frantically escaped from the Vietnamese capital to the north, during which Xu Shiheng decided to make his last stand at the Red River to allow his superior to escape, ultimately died in the battlefield. Xu Shiheng himself had warned Sun Shiyi about the deception trap by the Tây Sơn army earlier but was not heard.\nShocked by the death of Xu, Emperor Qianlong posthumously awarded Xu the third-class heroic earl and gave the title of \"Zhaoyi\" to him and had his portrait carried to the Zhaozhong Temple's altar to worship.\nHis son, Xu Wenmo, also gained fame with his bravery and had once worked as Governor of Guangdong. His descendants would later spread in the country and still living today, one of which would be the general Xu Shiyou (simplified Chinese: 许世友; traditional Chinese: 許世友), one of the founders of the People's Liberation Army who also personally took part in the Chinese invasion of Vietnam in 1979.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Francisco García-Escámez e Iniesta, 1st Marquess of Somosierra (Cádiz, 1 March 1893 – Santa Cruz de Tenerife, 12 June 1951) was a Spanish military officer who participated in the coup d'état against the government of the Second Republic, which was followed by the Civil War.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nAs an infantry soldier, he obtained the Laureate Cross of Saint Ferdinand for his actions in the Rif War. Stationed in Navarre, with the rank of colonel, he collaborated with General Emilio Mola in the preparation of the uprising.\n\n\n=== Civil War ===\nOnce the Civil War began in July 1936, he commanded a Nationalist column composed of about a thousand men, mostly Falangist and Requeté volunteers, with which he left Pamplona in the direction of Madrid, overcoming strong Republican resistance in Alfaro; with his column he came to occupy Logroño on 20 July, arresting General Víctor Carrasco Amilibia, military commander, accusing him of indecision. The next day he passed through Soria and reached the outskirts of Guadalajara without taking it. On 23 July he arrived in Aranda de Duero, taking command of all the forces in the area and forming two groups – one of them commanded by Colonel Bartolomé Rada. (For a few months this group was called \"Division of Soria\", receiving the number 53 to later become 72nd and now, definitively, 73rd.) On 10 October he conquered Sigüenza, and subsequently commanded troops on the Somosierra fronts, and in the Battle of Jarama in February 1937, as well as later in the Battle of the Ebro. He was promoted to brigadier general in 1938. As a general, in the Aragon Offensive he commanded one of the four divisions of the Moroccan Army Corps under Yagüe, occupying Caspe on 17 March.\n\n\n=== Military governor of Barcelona ===\nHe was military governor of Barcelona after the Civil War. On 13 April 1942, he was appointed military governor of Seville. At that time he was major general.\n\n\n== Captain General of the Canaries ==\nSubsequently, on 2 March 1943, he was appointed Captain General of the Canary Islands, As military commander of the Canary Islands, he carried out certain work of economic, social and cultural development that allowed overcoming the precarious conditions imposed by the isolation of the archipelago, caused by the Civil War and World War II.\n\n\n== Recognitions ==\n\nOn 30 September 1943, he was awarded the Grand Cross (with White Decoration) of Military Merit. After his death, Francisco Franco granted him the title of Marquess of Somosierra. Currently, García-Escámez is buried in the Church of San Fernando Rey, in the García Escámez neighborhood of the city of Santa Cruz de Tenerife.\n\n\n== References ==",

The formation of both groups was inspired by the need to mentor and support women entrepreneurs and in senior roles in organisations, and those to aspire to either. The CEW wanted to get a fairer deal for women in Australia, and to provide a network for sharing experiences with each other.WCEI asked Barbara Cail AO, then the publisher of Portfolio Magazine, to set up a branch in New South Wales, which she did by selecting a group of 18 women. Cail became founding president, and widened the scope of the FCEM objectives, suggesting awareness-raising of women's business capabilities, which at that point were barely acknowledged, partly by organising lunches with male business leaders.  Wendy McCarthy AO and Bonnie Boezeman AO were founding members.By 1991 the group was active and energetic and felt the need to expand. During the first ten years, one of the most impactful objectives and achievements was to provide an annual scholarship to aspiring women leaders, usually to undertake a Master of Business Administration. Lunches were held with captains of industry such as Bob Joss.In the mid-1990s CEW made a submission to the Karpin Inquiry (Industry Taskforce on Leadership and Management Skills, Enterprising Nation: Renewing Australia's Managers to Meet the Challenge of the Asia-Pacific Century, Canberra: AGPS, 1995) on women and diversity in management and leadership in the next century.In 2023, the independent creative agency Now We Collide began a partnership with CEW. Now We Collide is engaged to rebrand the annual CEW leadership summit, with the 2023 event called \"Agenda 2033\", to signal what must be done to hasten the current slow pace of change to fast-track the movement towards equality for women. Speakers at the 2023 summit included Taryn Brumfitt (2023 Australian of the Year), along with other influential leaders such as Macquarie Group CEO Shemara Wikramanayake, Coles CEO Leah Weckert, and Aboriginal engagement leader Kaylee Anderson, Victorian director of the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Women's Alliance.\n\n\n== Description ==\nCEW supports women entrepreneurs and those in leadership positions and those aspiring to be senior executives. It provides a network of women in these positions, as well as funding leadership scholarships. CEW encompasses all sectors of employment, including corporate, public service, academic, and not-for-profit. It is \"an exclusive organisation by choice\", in which members are bound to contribute to the overall advancement of women leaders. As of 2024 there are more than 1000 members.\n\n\n=== People and governance ===\nThe organisation has six full-time employees and eight part-time employees. It has been registered as a charity by the ACNC since 2015. As of March 2024, Marie Festa is CEO of CEW.Susan Lloyd-Hurwitz was appointed 19th president of CEW at the AGM in November 2022, and remains president as of April 2024.Past presidents include:\n\n\n== Programs and functions ==\nThe main functions and operations are focused on the CEW Scholarships and CEW Leaders Programs.In 2021, the ARA CEW Women Leaders in Retail Scholarship Program was established, in collaboration with the Australian Retailers Association (ARA). The program was announced at the annual ARA International Women's Day lunch by ARA CEO Paul Zahra. This provides the opportunity for women working in a mid to senior executive role in the retail sector to study at the Harvard Business School in Boston, Massachusetts, in the US. The inaugural winner of the scholarship in 2022 was Wesfarmers finance general manager Virginia Lead, with Coles GM of non-food business unit Debra Galle winning it in 2023.In 2022 CEW partnered with Jane Hansen AO to create two new scholarships for women who lead in the arts community: the Hansen Executive Leader CEW Scholarship and the Hansen CEW Leaders Program for the Arts Scholarships. The former is for one recipient, to study a leadership course of their choice anywhere in the world, while the latter offers five recipients to participate in the CEW Leaders Program.CEW also analyses data created by the federal government's Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA) each year, and makes submissions to parliament on the gender pay gap and related issues.In recent years it has put the spotlight on the untapped resources in migrant women, calling on leaders to examine their organisations' cultural and racial diversity and stressing the value of having diverse teams. It also committed to increasing its own data-gathering within its membership, and setting meaningful targets.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nIn July 2023 CEW published a report called Unlocking Leadership: Conversations on Gender and Race in Corporate Australia 2023.\n\n\n== See also ==\nC-suite\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "A-Town Down Under is a villainous professional wrestling tag team consisting of Austin Theory and Grayson Waller. The team is currently performing in WWE on the SmackDown brand, where they are the current WWE Tag Team Champions in their first reign.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation and alliance with Logan Paul (2023–2024) ===\nOn the September 22, 2023 episode of SmackDown, Theory and Waller teamed up to defeat The Brawling Brutes (Butch and Ridge Holland) in a match. On the October 13 episode of SmackDown, Theory and Waller challenged Cody Rhodes and Jey Uso for the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship in a losing effort. On the November 10 episode of SmackDown, Waller and Theory provoked the newest member of the SmackDown roster Kevin Owens, resulting in Owens attacking both of them and being kayfabe suspended by the WWE. On the December 15 episode of SmackDown, both Waller and Theory lost in the first rounds of the United States Championship #1 Contender Tournament to Carmelo Hayes and Owens respectively.\nOn the January 12, 2024 episode of SmackDown, Theory faced Hayes, but their match ended in a shoot no-contest after both of them landed on their heads from the top rope. WWE later announced that they only suffered face contusions and Theory proceeded to defeat Hayes in their rematch on the January 26 episode of SmackDown after interference from Waller. At Royal Rumble on January 27, Theory and Waller helped Logan Paul retain the United States Championship against Owens after handing him brass knuckles. Later that night, Waller and Theory participated in the men's Royal Rumble match, but were eliminated by Hayes and eventual winner Cody Rhodes respectively.\n\n\n=== Tag Team Champions (2024–present) ===\nOn February 24 at Elimination Chamber: Perth, Theory and Waller co-hosted The Grayson Waller Effect featuring Cody Rhodes and World Heavyweight Champion Seth Rollins. After imitating The Rock, Rhodes and Rollins attacked Theory while Waller did not get involved, teasing the dissolution of A-Town Down Under. Nevertheless, Theory and Waller entered a tag team tournament, defeating The O.C. (Karl Anderson and Luke Gallows) on the March 22 episode of SmackDown and The Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford) in the finals a week later to qualify for the six-pack ladder match for the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship at WrestleMania XL. At Night 1 of WrestleMania XL, Waller retrieved the SmackDown Tag Team Championship for A-Town Down Under to become the new champions, although they failed to win the Raw Tag Team Championship as that was won by The Awesome Truth (R-Truth and The Miz). On the April 19 episode of SmackDown, the SmackDown Tag Team Championship was renamed as the WWE Tag Team Championship and the team was presented with new title belts by Triple H. \n\n\n== Championships and accomplishments ==\nPro Wrestling Illustrated\nRanked Theory No. 45 of the top 500 singles wrestlers in the PWI 500 in 2023\nWWE\nWWE SmackDown/WWE Tag Team Championship (1 time, current)\nWrestleMania XL Six-Pack Ladder Match SmackDown Qualifier Tournament (2024)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAustin Theory on WWE.com\nGrayson Waller on WWE.com\nA-Town Down Under's profile at Cagematch.net",

        "content": "Tōnobaru pagoda ruins (塔原塔跡, Tōnobaru tō ato) is an archeological site  with the ruins of a Asuka period Buddhist temple located in the city of Chikushino, Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. It was designated as a National Historic Site in 1939.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Tōnobaru pagoda ruins are located near the Tōnobaru intersection on Fukuoka Prefectural Route 31. It consists of a granite stone, approximately 1.8 meters on each side and approximately 60 centimeters thick, which has is a circular tenon in the center with a diameter of 98  and a depth of 11 centimeters. In the center there is a two-tier small rectangular hole in which a reliquary can be stored. This stone is the foundation for the central supporting pillar of a Japanese pagoda and is one of the oldest in Japan. The name and history of the temple are unknown, and it does not appear in any historical documentation. In an Edo period history of Chikuzen Province (Chikuzen no Kuni Zoku Fudoki), it is stated that this stone is the origin of the place name \"Tōnobaru\".\nAn Archaeological excavation in 1966 have unearthed roof tiles that are identical to tiles found at Yamada-dera in Asuka, Nara.  Yamada-dera was associated with the Soga clan and was the personal temple of Soga no Ishikawamaro, so it is believed that this temple had an association with the Soga clan.In the biography of Prince Shotoku (Jōgu Shōtoku Hōō Teishō), it is stated that the prince ordered the construction of a temple called Hannya-ji in the Chikushino area in 654 AD to pray for the repose of the soul of Emperor Kōtoku, it as the date of the site corresponds, is it possible that this pagoda ruin was part of that temple.\nAbout 500 meters northwest is the Sugituka temple ruins, with a few foundation stones remaining. Some of the excavated items are displayed at the Chikushino City History Museum. The site is approximately a 12-minute walk from Futsukaichi Station on the JR Kyushu Kagoshima Main Line.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Fukuoka)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nChikushino city home page(in Japanese)\nFukuoka Tourism Web(in Japanese)",

        "content": "The Christchurch Sirens are a defunct New Zealand professional basketball team based in Christchurch, New Zealand. The Sirens competed for the 2007–08 season in the Women's National Basketball League (WNBL) and folded after one season due to financial pressures. They were the first and to date only New Zealand team to compete in the WNBL. Their home stadium was initially the Westpac Arena before relocating to Cowles Stadium in November 2007 following venue upgrades. The Sirens finished eighth in their only season, with a record of 9 wins and 15 losses.\nThe WNBL decided in October 2006 to add the Sirens along with the Bendigo Spirit to the league for the 2007–08 season. The Sirens were intended to serve as a pathway towards the Tall Ferns. Their name was inspired by the mythological sirens and their red and black colours were regionally associated with Christchurch and Canterbury.\nAfter one season, the Sirens were unable to secure sponsors to raise the estimated NZD$600,000 required to stay in the league. The team had to pay travel equalisation alongside all 10 WNBL teams, a new entrant team levy, and a special fee as a New Zealand team in the Australian league. Basketball New Zealand decided against bailing the team out as they were short on reserves and couldn't justify the risk. In spite of the team's collapse, Basketball New Zealand still had to pay NZD$250,000 to Basketball Australia in accordance with terms of its five-year licence agreement, including an annual AUD$50,000 entry fee for 4 years.\n\n\n== Roster ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nChristchurch Sirens at Australiabasket.com",

        "content": "Magnetic Mountain, or Magnitnaya Mountain (obsolete name Atach, in Bashkir Әtәs), is a mountain on the eastern slope of the Southern Urals on the left (Asian) bank of the Ural River. It is administratively located in the city of Magnitogorsk, Chelyabinsk Oblast.\nThe mountain was used as a source of raw materials (Magnitogorsk deposit of brown ironstone). Most of the mountain is now excavated. Its height is 616 m.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1740, the foreman of Kubelyakskaya volost of the Nogaiskaya road, tarkhan Baim Kidraev, showed the foreman Markov and the interpreter Roman Urazlin a deposit of iron ore on the Atach mountain on the left bank of the Yaik river. The Bashkirs called the mountain \"Atach\" (in Bashkir Әtәs); its ore had been in use for a long time. The test gave an excellent result: from 100 pounds of ore (\"magnetic stones\") they got 75 pounds of iron. After that the mountain, named Magnitnaya, became famous during the Soviet period.\nNear the mountain there was a Cossack village Magnitnaya, founded in 1743 as a fortress — a stronghold of the border and defense line of the Orenburg region. Magnitnaya was a stronghold of the border and defense line of the Orenburg region. During the Soviet period, Magnitogorsk was the site of a large metallurgical plant and the city of Magnitogorsk.\n\n\n== Orography ==\nMagnitnaya Mountain is a group of mountains: Atach, Dalnyaya, Uzyanka (the Magnetic itself), Ezhovka and Beryozovaya. The area is approximately 25 km2.\nMagnitnaya is located in the band of sedimentary (limestones, sandstones) and effusive strata of Lower Carboniferous age, broken by granite, diabases and other eruptive rocks. A large magnetite deposit was formed at the contact of sedimentary and igneous rocks.\n\n\n== Researches ==\nIn 1747, ore explorers of the industrialist I. B. Tverdyshev carried out a pitting on Magnetic Mountain to determine whether there was enough ore to build an ironworks nearby.\nThe first professional explorers of Magnetic Mountain were E. Hoffman and G. Helmersen. (1828–29).\n1854–1855. Engineers A. I. Antipov and N. G. Meglitsky made a photograph of Magnetic Mountain. The first geological map of the region was made. The map remained in manuscript form.\n1875. Magnetic Mountain was studied by geologist H. A. Trautschold. The results of the study were published in a German magazine in an article \"Letters from the Urals\".\nIn 1884, the academician A. P. Karpinsky prepared and published the \"Geographical Map of the Eastern Slope of the Urals\", including Magnetic Mountain, based on his researches and observations of mining engineers A. A. Lesh, F. Y. Gebauer, F. P. Brusnitsyn and others. It gives a more complete picture of the geological features of Magnetic Mountain and its surroundings.\nIn 1895 Professor A. A. Shtukenberg, the author of \"Geological Research in the Southern Urals\" (Izvestiya Geologicheskogo Komiteta, vol. 15), visited the mountain. He wrote that it \"represents a remarkable deposit of magnetic ironstone...\"\nIn 1899, on the order of the Ministry of Finance the Urals was surveyed by a government commission headed by Professor D. I. Mendeleev. Mendeleev, who could not come to the Magnetic Mountain due to illness. Professor P. A. Zemyatchensky, members of the scientific commission K. N. Yegorov, S. P. Vukolov visited Magnetic Mountain. They wrote articles about Magnetic Mountain, which were published in the collection \"Ural iron industry in 1899\", edited by D. I. Mendeleev. Mendeleev. He also proposed several directions for the construction of a railway from Magnitnaya along the Urals to the center of Russia and Siberia. A member of the Mendeleev Commission, Professor of Mineralogy P. A. Zamyatchensky made calculations according to which even the minimum estimated reserves of ores in Magnitnaya are 1 billion poods. This was the first attempt to \"weigh\" the mountain.\nIn 1900, geologist J. A. Morozevich, together with mining engineer and topographer N. G. Mikheev, explored the Magnetic Mountain, determined ore reserves, its origin, impurities, etc. Morozevich's work \"Magnetic Mountain and its immediate surroundings\" was published in 1901 (Proceedings of the Geological Committee, vol. 18). Summarizing the results of the survey, I. Morozevich wrote: \"The probable minimum of ore wealth of Magnetic Mountain is expressed by a round number of three billion poods.\" The exact number is 3146 million poods.\nIn 1901–1902, Magnetic Mountain and its surroundings were explored by topographers Captain Roslyakov, Lieutenant N. G. Mikheev and geologist D. V. Nikolaev.\nIn 1912, after drilling the first 11 boreholes and conducting new research, Professor A. N. Zavaritsky discovered 87 million tons of high quality ore.\nIn 1914, the mountain was explored by the engineer K. Trushkov. Extensive material about Magnitnaya is published in the book \"Russia. Complete Geographical Description of our Fatherland\", Volume 5, edited by P. P. Semyonov-Tianshansky, St. Petersburg, 1914.\nIn 1917–1918 Professors V. I. Bauman and I. M. Bakhurin carried out a magnetometer survey of the deposit, which allowed to revise the ore reserves of the Magnetic Mountain to 6-7 and even 10 billion poods.\n\n\n== Iron ore mining ==\nUntil the 1730s, iron mining on Magnetic Mountain was carried out by Bashkirs:\"...Until the last great rebellion, the Bashkirs used to extract iron from this mountain in a very simple way, and especially excellent steel. But at the outbreak of the rebellion, in 1735, they were forbidden to go on with it...\".On December 24, 1747, in the Chancery of Orenburg Governorate, the factory worker I. B. Tverdyshev announced that he had found mines \"near the Yaika River at a distance of eight versts from it, as well as from the mouth of the Upper Kizilu River at eight versts in the mountain called Atachi in three places\".\nIvan Borisovich Tvyordyshev and his son-in-law and companion Ivan Semyonovich Myasnikov, relying on the provisions of the Collegium of Mining of 1719–1734 and taking advantage of the fact that the Magnetic Mountain is not registered as the property of anyone, became the first official claimants to the ore reserves of the mountain. Their \"humble request\" was to have the ore deposit secured for them \"for all eternity\".\nOn October 27, 1752, the Chancery of the Orenburg Governorate issued a document granting Tverdyshev and Myasnikov the right to mine ores and build factories on the Avzyan and Tirlyan rivers. Ore from the Magnetic Mountain was brought here, to the future Beloretsk Iron and Steel Works.\nOn November 30, 1753, by the order of the governor of Orenburg I. I. Neplyuev, the commander of the engineering corps Fyodor Menz assigned three places on the Atach mountain to Tverdyshev. Surveyors of the Orenburg province under the direction of the ensign I. D. Krasilnikov made a geographical map of the province, on which the Magnetic Fortress was marked.\nIn 1759 the first import of ore from the Magnetic Mountain for the Beloretsk plant, built on the Tirlyan River, began. In the summer the ore was collected on the surface and piled up in heaps, in the winter it was exported by a sledge route through the Verkhneyaitskaya fortress (now Verkhneuralsk).\n\n\n== Memory ==\nOn May 15, 1971, the monument \"40th Anniversary of the Mine\" was opened on the summit of Magnetic (Uzyanka) Mountain to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the day when the first ton of ore (450 million tons) was extracted from the Magnitogorsk mine. A real artifact forms part of this monument: the bucket of the excavator with a block of Magnitogorsk ore is placed on a high rectangular pedestal welded from sheet iron. On the front side of the pedestal the plaque was reinforced, now it is missing. On the back of the pedestal there is an inscription: 40 years 1971. At the base of the monument there are two blocks of iron ore.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMagnetic Mountains's legends. (temporaly unavailable link)",

This group included Marcello Malphigi and Carlo Fracassati. They dissected bodies and made vivisection experiments on animals.

        "content": "Antisemitism studies is an academic discipline centered on the study of antisemitism and anti-Jewish prejudice. Antisemitism studies is interdisciplinary and combines aspects of Jewish studies, social sciences, history, public policy, psychology, and law.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early academic study through the Holocaust ===\nIn the decades after  German journalist Wilhelm Marr coined the term \"antisemitism\" in 1879, antisemitism was a little-studied phenomenon. While antisemitism became a subject of university research and teaching in the early 20th century, social scientists did not develop an exceptional interest in the phenomenon of antisemitism before the Holocaust.\nIn the 1920s, Swedish historian Hugo Valentin \"staked out a new approach to the topic of antisemitism, in which Jewish characteristics and the so-called Jewish question, while not completely absent, were placed within parentheses. Instead, he presented antisemitism and individual antisemites as problems in their own right....\"\nAs persecution of the Jews in Nazi Germany increased and boiled into the Holocaust, scholars began to decode the logic of antisemitism that led to the massive violence against European Jews. Philosophers and social scientists such as Sigmund Freud (1939), Talcott Parsons (1942), Jean Paul Sartre (1945), Ernst Simmel (1946), Max Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno (1947) were the main protagonists of this early wave of antisemitism research. While Freud, Sartre, and Simmels focused mainly on psycho-analytical assumptions, Parsons and Horkheimer and Adorno embedded their psychological studies within comprehensive theories of society.\n\n\n=== Post-Holocaust ===\nIn the 1960s, the study of antisemitic attitudes in the United States was advanced significantly with the Five-Year Study of Anti-Semitism, also called the \"Patterns of American Prejudice\" and more commonly known as The Berkeley Studies, commissioned by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL). The Berkeley Studies developed a scale of antisemitic beliefs used by the field well into the 21st century.\nAntisemitic attitudes in the U.S. were examined in depth, after the 1980s, when the ADL and the American Jewish Committee (AJC) released a series of competing studies on American antisemitism. The AJC studies positioned attitudes toward Jews within a context of intergroup relationship, while the ADL studies focus on attitudes toward Jews specifically. There were five sets of studies about antisemitism in the 1990s and 2000s: the University of Chicago's National Opinion Research Center (NORC) General Social Survey commissioned by AJC in 1990; 1992, 1998, 2002, and 2009 surveys of American attitudes toward Jews conducted for the ADL, a 1992 intergroup relations study of New York City done by the Roper Organization for AJC, a 1993 ADL survey on racial attitudes in America, and a 1994 study by the NORC confirming and synthesizing the finding of previous studies.\nBy the 1980s, some universities had established Holocaust research centers around the world, which also served to foster research on antisemitism.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nThe study of antisemitism reemerged in the early 21st century, focusing on the concept of New Antisemitism, fueled by an increase in antisemitic activity in Europe and Israelophobia. In 2009, Steven K. Baum and Neal E. Rosenberg founded the Journal for the Study of Antisemitism as the first English-language academic journal solely devoted to the study of antisemitism. According to scholar Kenneth Marcus, antisemitism was not considered a particularly popular or politically correct area of academic focus, particularly on the political left, because so much of contemporary antisemitism arises from Arab and Muslim countries.\nThe first journal's issue was released in June 2009 with Professor Michael Berenbaum as founding editor.\nIn Europe, the number of research items dealing with antisemitism more than doubled between the 1990s and 2010s, with antisemitism taking up an increasingly large proportion of research holdings since 1990. The European Union Strategy on Combatting Antisemitism and Fostering Jewish Life, published on 5 October 2021, recommended the formation of a European research hub to coordinate academic research on antisemitism and Jewish life across Europe and foster and fund multidisciplinary research. A 2023 study by the European Commission noted that the core group of academic researchers of antisemitism numbered approximately 60; however, antisemitism was not the primary focus of study for the majority.\nIn 2009, Birkbeck, University of London and the Pears Foundation launched the Pears Institute for the Study of Antisemitism, the first academic institute in Britain solely studying antisemitism.\nIn the aftermath of the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel and subsequent rise in global antisemitism, several universities announced the formation of academic research institutes and programs specifically focusing on antisemitism, including the University of Michigan, New York University and the University of Toronto (UofT). The Lab for the Study of Global Antisemitism at UofT was the first antisemitism research institute in Canada. Gratz College debuted a master's degree in antisemitism studies in February 2024, the first-of-its-kind interdisciplinary graduate program in the United States.\n\n\n== Interdisciplinary study ==\nBesides extensive historical research, there has been in-depth research on antisemitism in psychology. The sociology of antisemitism can be traced back to Jewish scholars of early sociology, including Franz Boas, Arthur Ruppin, Georg Simmel,  and includes Talcott Parsons 1942 pioneering article, \"The Sociology of Modern Anti-Semitism,\" and other studies in the post-War era.\n\n\n== Research institutes ==\n\n\n=== United States ===\n\n\n==== New York University ====\nIn November 2023, New York University announced The Center for the Study of Antisemitism to open in the fall of 2024. The center would convene scholars from a range of academic disciplines, including social sciences, Judaic studies, history, social work, public policy, psychology, and law, and would produce research on both \"classicial\" antisemitism and New Antisemitism and its links to anti-Zionism. The center would work closely with NYU's Skirball Department of Hebrew and Judaic Studies. Scholar Avinoam Patt was named as the center's first director.\n\n\n=== University of Michigan ===\nAmidst a rise of antisemitism after the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel, the University of Michigan established the Raoul Wallenberg Institute in December 2023. The center, named for Raoul Wallenberg, would use research and scholarship on antisemitism to combat the phenomenon. The institute is housed within the university's College of Literature, Science and the Arts.\n\n\n=== University of Pennsylvania ===\nThe University of Pennsylvania established the Fund for the Study of Antisemitism within the Herbert D. Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies in October 2023. The fund would support research and advance public understanding, according to scholar Steven Weitzman.\n\n\n=== Canada ===\n\n\n==== University of Toronto ====\nAfter the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel, Anna Shternshis, director of the Anne Tanenbaum Centre for Jewish Studies, and Ron Levi, Distinguished Professor of Global Justice at the Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy, launched the Lab for the Study of Global Antisemitism at the University of Toronto in February 2024. The lab's focuses are to conduct high-level academic research, designing academic courses about antisemitism, and policy and communications. The lab was the first antisemitism research institute in Canada.\n\n\n=== Germany ===\nThe Center for Research on Antisemitism (Zentrum für Antisemitismusforschung, ZfA) at the Technical University of Berlin is a research centre dedicated to researching antisemitism. It was founded in 1982.\n\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n\n\n==== Birkbeck, University of London ====\nPears Institute for the Study of Antisemitism, the first academic institute in Britain solely studying antisemitism, was established in November 2009 at Birkbeck, University of London with support from the Pears Foundation. Professor David Feldman was named as the institute's first director in April 2010.\n\n\n== Academic journals ==\n\n\n=== Journal for the Study of Antisemitism ===\nIn 2009, Steven K. Baum and Neal E. Rosenberg founded the Journal for the Study of Antisemitism as the first English-language academic journal solely devoted to the study of antisemitism.\nThe first issue was released in June 2009 with Professor Michael Berenbaum as founding editor.\n\n\n=== Journal of Contemporary Antisemitism ===\n\nThe Journal of Contemporary Antisemitism (JCA) is a biannual peer-reviewed journal founded in 2017.\n\n\n== See also ==\nUniversities and antisemitism\nJewish studies\nHolocaust studies\n\n\n== References ==",

Former BLMP MP Doris Blackburn became the PLP's president after its formation.\nBlackburn contested the division of Wills at the 1951 federal election. She was unsuccessful, coming in third place with 17.6% of the vote.\nMutton was the only candidate endorsed by the PLP at the 1952 Victorian state election. He was re-elected despite a 4.4% swing against him.\nThe PLP won a second representative when it successfully contested a by-election for Campbellfield Riding on Broadmeadows Shire Council in July 1954, with Robert Warnock defeating Labor after the resignation of councillor B. Foulsham.\nOne month later at the statewide local government elections in August 1954, Mutton's son, Jack Mutton, was also elected to Campbellfield Riding. The seat had formerly been held by his father before his retirement from local government in 1953.\nMutton contested the 1955 state election for the PLP, and was again re-elected. However, the party faded away by the end of the year.\n\n\n== Elected representatives ==\n\n\n=== Victorian Legislative Assembly ===\nCharlie Mutton (1950−1955)\n\n\n=== Broadmeadows Shire Council ===\nRobert Warnock (1954−1955)\nJack Mutton (1954−1955)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Girl With Two Husbands is a Greek fairy tale translated and published by Richard MacGillivray Dawkins in Modern Greek Folktales. The tale is part of the more general cycle of the Animal as Bridegroom, and is classified in the Aarne–Thompson–Uther Index as tale type ATU 433B, \"King Lindworm\", a type that deals with maidens disenchanting serpentine husbands. In the Greek variants of the tale type, however, the story continues with the adventures of the banished heroine, who meets a man at a graveyard, rescues and marries him, and eventually is found by her first husband, the snake prince whom she disenchanted before.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nAccording to Dawkins, the tale originates from Thrace with the translated title The Girl thrice accursed.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nA king and queen have a daughter who is taught by a female teacher. The woman has wicked intentions and plans to marry the king by getting rid of the queen, and manipulates the princess to reach her goals: she treats the princess with kindness, gives her sweets and makes her bed with twelve pillows to sway her to her side. Now finally under her thrall, the female teacher asks the princess which she would rather see dead: the queen, her mother, or the teacher. The girl answers she would rather the teacher lives, thus the woman plots with the princess how to kill the queen: the princess is to ask for walnuts, which are in a lid, but only if the queen gives her some, then she is to close off the lid on the queen's head.\nThe princess does as the teacher instructed and closes the lid on the queen, killing her. After a period of mourning, the female teacher dotes on the girl even more and convinces her to ask the now widowed king to find a new wife, and mention her name. The king hears his daughter's suggestion, but denies her request and sets a test: he hangs a pair of iron shoes on an iron chain and declares he will only marry the teacher if the iron shoes fall from the chain. The female teacher advises the girl to speed up the process by dousing the chain with stinking water and rotten lemons. The chain rusts and releases the iron shoes, which the king perceives as a portent to marry the female teacher as his new wife. The king relents and gives in to his daughter's suggestion, but warns the princess not to complain if his new stepmother mistreats her. After the marriage, the stepmother, who once treated her kindly, mistreats her. The princess locks herself in her room and cries.\nMeanwhile, in another country, a queen goes for a walk in the mountains, sights a snake and sighs that she has no children, for even a snake has its young. Thus, she prays to God to have a son, even in the shape of a snake. Thus, a snake son is born to her, but he cannot be born, since he bites any midwife that approaches him. Back to the princess's stepmother, she hears of this situation and decides to send her stepdaughter to help in the second queen's delivery. Fearing for her life, the princess goes to a priest to confess, and admits to her mother's murder. The priest chastises her and orders her to seek forgiveness and advice on her mother's tomb. The princess goes to her mother's grave and, in tears, asks for her forgiveness. Her mother's ghost's voice says she will help her, despite her death by her hands: the princess is to wear iron gloves and place a cauldron of boiling milk under the queen; the snake will sense the milk and exit his mother's body, then the princess is to take the snake with the iron gloves and tend to him.\nThe princess follows her mother's spirit's advice and delivers the snake prince. Next, the snake son's father bring wet nurses to suckle the prince, but he bites them all to death. The princess's stepmother sends the princess again to die, but she is advised on the queen's grave to use the iron gloves to suckle him. The third time, the snake son is ready to learn his letters, but he kills every tutor that his father has sent to teach him. The stepmother sends the princess to teach the snake son, since she was the one who helped in his delivery and in his feeding. The princess goes to her mother's grave in search of advice, and the queen's ghost tells her to use an iron rod to keep the snake at bay during her lessons.\nTime passes, and the snake son keeps slithering and hissing about the palace, wanting to be married. His father the king arrangees marriages for him with beautiful princesses, but each time he devours them during the night only their bones remain. In time, the king issues a proclamation to find one brave enough to marry the snake prince. The stepmother queen sends her stepdaughter, the princess, again, on the pretext that, since she helped in his delivery, suckled him and taught him letters, she shall be his bride. The princess goes to her mother's grave for advice, and her mother's ghost advises her to prepare a fire in his room, then order the prince to remove one of his shirts, which are each time to be tossed in the fire; if the prince orders the princess to undress, the girl is to reply he must do it first. The princess does as instructed and orders the snake prince to remove each of his shirts, while she removes her after his turn. When the snake takes off his seventh shirt, he becomes a handsome human prince and marries the girl in human form.\nLater, the stepmother learns of her stepdaughter's successful marriage, then consults with wizards for a way to get rid of her. Finally she finds the right opportunity when the now human snake prince departs for war and leaves his wife under his mother's care, warning that, if anything happens to her, he will not return home. The stepmother writes a series of false letters with a command to expel the princess from the palace and cast her out into the world. The snake prince's mother receives the false letters and decides to hide them from the princess, whom they love. However, the princess suspects something is amiss and discovers heaps of letters supposedly sent by her husband. She confronts her parents-in-law and decides to leave the palace herself, since they would rather disobey her son's command.\nThe princess leaves on her own and finds work with some shepherds. One night, she stops to rest by a midden and watches as four fairies come and resurrect a dead prince from a midden, then bring him back to be buried in the midden. The princess meets the dead prince when he is revived and, nine months later, is heavy with his child. The dead prince, awake at this point, sends his wife to another land for protection and she must search for the palace of Riga, be welcomes in his name, and reveals how they can save their son: by banishing every black rooster from the city. The pregnant princess journeys on until she finds the palace of Riga and is welcomed by the prince's mother, and given lodge to have her baby. The princess gives birth to her baby and lulls her child with a song, saying in verse that, if the queen knew that baby was Riga's, she would place him in a silver cradle with swaddlings of gold. One night, the queen overhears the song and questions the girl how they can save prince Riga: the girl answers that no black rooster must crow in the kingdom and beyond. So the queen orders the roosters to be killed as they wait for the prince's liberation: the fairies revive prince Riga from the tomb and, when dawn comes, they cannot hear the crowing of any rooster. Defeated, the fairies fly away, and Riga is free to be with his lover and son.\nBack to the now human snake prince, he return from war and learns of the false letters, then wanders off until he reaches the city of prince Riga, sighting his wife inside the palace with a child in her arms. He talks to her and tries to convince her to go back with him, but she tells she has a son now. Riga and the snake prince dispute over her, and the case is brought to a judge. The judge prepares a test: give the girl a sleeping drug so she sleeps for a while, and when she wakes up, the first one to offer her a glass of water shall have her as his wife. His orders are carried out, and the two princes lie in a long vigil. One night, the princess wakes up, laments her dilemma in some verses, and dies, torn for having to choose over two men she loved. The two princes awake and, on seeing the dead princess, also die by her side.\n\n\n== Analysis ==\n\n\n=== Tale type ===\nThe first part of the Greek tale type corresponds, in the international Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index, to tale type ATU 433B, \"King Lindworm\": a serpent (snake, or dragon) son is born to a king and queen (either from a birthing implement or due to a wish); years later, the serpent prince wishes to marry, but he kills every bride they bring him; a girl is brought to him as a prospective bride, and wears several layers of cloth to parallel the serpent's skins; she disenchants him. Tale type ATU 433B, \"King Lindworm\", is part of the cycle of the Animal as Bridegroom, stories that involve a human maiden marrying a prince in animal form and disenchanting him.\nRichard MacGillivray Dawkins noted that the Greek tale formed a two-part narrative: the first part wherein a heroine marries an enchanted prince in animal form, and a (rarer) second part about the heroine finding a second lover and having to choose between them. Similarly, Anna Angelopoulou and Aigle Broskou, editors to the Greek Folktale Catalogue, and Michael Merakles noted that, in Greek variants, the heroine kills her mother on another woman's convincing and the woman becomes her stepmother; later, the woman sends the heroine to die at the hands of the snake prince (Ophis), but she survives with her mother's spirit's advice and disenchants the prince. In the second part of the tale, the heroine is either exiled due to falsified letters and revives a dead man who becomes her lover, or she rescues a man from the fairies, becomes pregnant and bears his son in his mother's castle (tale type AaTh 425E). At the end of both narrative sequences, she has to choose between both men.\nGreek folklorist Georgios A. Megas considered that the Greek variants showed a contamination between tale type 433B and subtype ATU 425E, \"Enchanted Husband Sings Lullaby\", wherein the pregnant heroine is sent by her lover, kidnapped by the fairies (\"neraides\", in the Greek tales), to his mother's castle, where she can give birth in safety.\n\n\n=== Motifs ===\n\n\n==== The snake prince ====\nScholar Jan-Öjvind Swahn, in his work about Cupid and Psyche and other Animal as Bridegroom tales, described that the King Lindworm tales are \"usually characterized\" by the motifs of \"release by bathing\" and \"7 shifts and 7 skins\". Similarly, according to Birgit Olsen, \"in most versions\" the heroine is advised by her mother's spirit to wear many shifts for her wedding night with the lindworm prince.\n\n\n==== The heroine's dilemma ====\nSwedish scholar Waldemar Liungman noted that the heroine, in the second part of the tale, is torn between a first and second husbands, and chooses the first - a dilemma that occurs \"both in the Nordic as well as in variants from Eastern and Southeastern Europe\". As for the nature of the second husband, he is a man cursed to be dead in the latter, while in the former region he is a prince in bird form or a man who has a contract with the Devil.\n\n\n== Variants ==\n\n\n=== Distribution ===\nFolklorist Stith Thompson noted that tale type 433B's continuation, with the heroine's adventures, occurs in the Near East. According to researcher Birgit Olsen and Greek scholars Anna Angelopoulou, Aigle Broskou and Michael Meraklis, the two-part narrative forms an East Mediterranean oikotype, popular in both Greece and Asia Minor.\n\n\n=== Greece ===\nThe Greek Folktale Catalogue names tale type 433B as \"Ο Όφις που έγινε βασιλόπουλο ή Η κόρη με τους δυο συζύγου\" (\"The Snake who Became a Prince, or The Girl with Two Husbands\"), and registers 23 variants.\n\n\n==== Tsyrógles ====\nIn a Greek tale titled Tsyrógles or Chyrogles, a girl convinces her father to marry a woman with a daughter. Her new step-family is cruel to her and mistreat the girl. The step-mother sends her with basketfuls of clothes to wash in the river. She is approached by an old beggar who asks for food and water. She gives her crust of bread and shares a bit of her jug of water. She also delouses the beggar and is blessed with golden hair and the ability to turn her clothes into gold. The step-mother, jealous of the step-daughter's good fortune, sends her own daughter to the beggar. She insults the man and receives a blessing of horns and prickles. Meanwhile, the childless royal couple prays to God for a son, even if it is a snake - which is exactly what they are expecting. The snake son (called Ophis) needs to be suckled, so the step-mother sends her step-daughter to do it. The girl weeps on her mother's grave, and her spirit gives her advice on how to do it. Later, the snake son decides to marry, and the step-mother suggests that the girl who suckled the snake prince should marry it. The girl once again seeks counsel with her mother's spirit, who says she must prepare seven garments and seven ovens, and ask the snake husband to undress each layer of snakeskin first as she takes off each garment. The girl disenchants her husband by throwing his seven layers of snakeskin in the ovens. She gives birth to a son and Ophis, now human, goes to war. The girl's step-mother falsifies a letter with an order to expel the girl with her son from the palace. On her wanderings, she enters a church and meets a being named Tsyrógles. She later disenchants him into human form and marries him. Ophis returns from war and, seeing his wife is not there, discovers she is now married to Tsyrógles in another kingdom. Torn between her love for Ophis and her love for Tsyrógles, she dies of a broken heart. Dawkins, in his book Modern Greek Folktales, sourced this version as from Skyros and remarked that the Greek name of the hero, Τσίρογλéσ, corresponded to Turkish Köroglu, which may hint at an Eastern origin for the tale.\n\n\n==== Snake-Child ====\nAustrian consul Johann Georg von Hahn collected a Greek tale from Wisiani, Epirus, with the title Schlangenkind (\"Snake-Child\"). In this tale, a woman wishes for a son, even if it is a snake, thus she gives birth to one. One day, the snake asks his mother to find him a wife. She goes to church and announces her request. The churchgoers laugh at her, but a stepmother promises to send her step-daughter to be the snake's wife. The step-daughter goes to her mother's grave to cry over her sad situation, but she has a dream about her mother telling her to burn her husband's snakeskin. The girl tells her mother-in-law to prepare an oven, then hang the snakeskin inside it after her son removes it. As the snakeskin burns, the snake son, in human form, smells the burning, but his wife dismisses it. The next day, the snake so cannot return to his snakeskin, and becomes human. In time, he and his wife have a son, but he is summoned to war, leaving his wife and son at home. The girl's stepmother, envious of her stepdaughter's good luck, whom the snake son married instead of her own daughter, creeps into her room at night and absconds her to the desert, then places her own daughter in her place. Back to the snake son's real wife, she realizes she is in a desert, and laments her fate. Her tears fall to the ground and water the earth, resurrecting a man named Kyrikos, who was buried underground. Kyrikos and the girl become lovers, and eventualle she gives birth to his son. The pair return to his homeland and Kyrikos's mother celebrates her son's return after decades. Back to the human snake son, he returns home and notices his wife is not there, but his sister-in-law. Some time later, he travels to Kyrikos's land and reunites with his wife, but also learns she has a second husband. Thus, he takes the matter to court and the judge establishes a test for the girl to choose her husband: the girl is to stay on the ground, while both are to climb a mountain; whoever races down the mountain and reaches the girl first shall be declared her only husband. The now human snake son beats the challenge and stays with his wife, while Kyrikos says his goodbyes. The reunited couple returns home and he executes his sisters-in-law for her deceit.\nVon Hahn collected another variant from Zagori: the first part is largely the same, but in the second part, after the snake son goes to war, his stepmother-in-law writes a letter with a false command to kill her and bottle her blood. The snake son's mother thinks it a strange command, but spares the girl and only cuts off her finger, banishing her to a desert. The girl eventually meets a man named Kirigli, stolen by the neraides. The girl becomes pregnant and goes to Kirigli's house to give birth, where his own wife welcomes the wandering girl. She gives birth to a boy and rocks her baby with a song, telling him he is Kirigli's child and, if his family knew it, they would cover him in silver gauze and put him in a silver cradle. Kirigli's wife take notice of the lullaby's verses and questions the stranger: she met Kirigli, stolen by the neraides, and he can be rescued if she brings cakes of honey bread to the neraidas, and demand him back. With the girl's advice, Kirigli's wife rescues him and brings him back to their house, and they let the girl live with them. Back to the human snake son, he returns from war and questions his mother about his wife's absence. He learns of the false letters and decides to search for her. He reaches Kirigli's house and finds his wife there playing with a child. Kirigli meets the snake son and both agree to let her have the last say in the matter: they give her three days to think over her decision, then if she shouts for \"bread\", it means she will choose her first husband; if she shouts \"water\", it means she will choose Kirigli. After three days, she shouts \"bread, bread\", marking her choice for her first husband.\n\n\n==== The Teacher ====\nProfessor Michael Merakles published a Greek tale with the German title Die Lehrerin (\"The Teacher\"). In this tale, a shoemaker has a wife and a daughter. At school, the girl loves her female teacher so much she asks her to be her new mother. The female teacher then plot with the girl: she is to ask her mother for sugary treats from inside a chest and close off the lid on her head. It happens thus and the shoemaker's wife dies. The teacher becomes the girl's stepmother and begins to mistreat her, forcing her to do chores. Meanwhile, a local queen is having difficulties with giving birth to her snake son, for every midwife has died during the delivery. The stepmother sends her stepdaughter to be the prince's midwife, but she pays a visit to her mother's grave. Her mother's spirit advises her to bring a cauldron of milk and another of honey to draw the snake out of the queen's body. It happens thus. However, feeding the snake son still poses a problem, since he bites his wet nurses to death every time. Again, the girl is sent by her stepmother to die, and again she is advised by her mother's spirit: prepare a bag of milk and place it on her breast. The third time, the snake prince wishes to marry, but he bits his brides to death. The girl is sent to be the snake's bride, but, following her mother's advice, she takes the snakeskin and tosses it in a fireplace to burn it, which disenchants the prince. The shoemaker's daughter marries the prince. Later, war erupts, and the now human snake prince departs. The shoemaker's wife writes a series of false letters that cause her stepdaughter to be banishe from the palace. She wanders off until she reaches another kingdom, whose prince has fallen into a long and deep sleep for twenty years, and can only be awakened after a maiden holds a vigil for forty days. The girl takes up the task, but on the fortieth day, an old woman appears and finishes the vigil, awakening the prince. The prince and the old woman marry, while his true saviour becomes a servant. The girl asks the prince for a butcher's knife, a hanged man's rope and the stone of patience. The prince brings the gifts without noticing their true meaning: a suicidal person's request. The prince stops the girl from killing herself, and executes the old woman. Later, the now human snake prince returns from war, discovers the false letters and goes in search for his wife. The human snake prince reaches the second prince's kingdom and recognizes his wife by her golden teeth. A judge is summoned to solve the dispute: they are to eat very salty food, and whomever she asks for water shall be considered her husband. However, the girl cannot choose between them, and dies of thirst.\n\n\n==== Mother's Curse ====\nIn a tale published by Greek folklorist Georgios A. Megas with the title H κατάρα της μάνας (\"Mother's Curse\"), a king and a queen have a daughter named Maria, who goes to school. Maria likes her female school teacher so much she wants her to be her mother, and the teacher hatches a plan: Maria is to ask her mother to fetch some nuts from a marble box, and close the lid on her mother. Maria kills her mother, but the queen says her daughter will have to mourn on her grave for advice, and may God and the Virgin Mary forgive her. The queen is buried with pomp, and the girl convinces her father to marry her female teacher to give her a new mother. It happens thus, and the female teacher becomes Maria's stepmother. One day, after the king departs for war, a woman near the palace's verandah asks God to give her a snake for a child. When the woman is ready to be in labour, the new queen offers Maria to be her midwife, although the unborn snake's mother fears for her. Maria is forced to go, but goes to her mother's grave for advice; her mother's ghost admonishes her for the killing, but advises her to prepare a pot of honey and a bowl of milk, entice the snake with the food and toss him into a large box. It happens thus, and the snake child is born. Later, the snake son, called Όφις (\"Ophis\"), asks his human mother to be taught to read and write, suggesting Maria shall do it. Princess Maria goes to her mother's grave again and again receives advice: prepare iron rods to beat the snake son if he tries to bite her when learning the alphabet. The third time, Ophis asks his mother to find him a bride, and he suggests Maria. Maria goes to her mother's grave again and her mother's ghost simply tells her to be extremely careful. On the wedding night, Ophis asks Maria to close the door, then he removes his snakeskin to become a handsome prince, warning Maria not to tell anyone about his secret, lest she has to wear down three pairs of iron shoes in search for him. Maria and Ophis spend the night together, and he returns to his snakeskin in the morning. Eventually Maria betrays Ophis and reveals his secret, causing him to disappear. She dons the iron shoes and goes to her mother's grave, her spirit warning her her journey will be long, through mountains and valleys. Maria walks until she finds a grave; she enters the grave and further inside she finds a youth trapped to a chair. He explains he is prince Giorgios and the fairies (\"neraides\") kidnapped him from his father's palace and force him to dance every night. Giorgios turns Maria into aN orange to protect her from the fairies, and eventually she becomes pregnant. Giorgios sends her to his mother's castle so she can gie birth to their child. Maria is welcomes into Georgios's mother's castle and gives birth to a son. She rocks the baby with a song, saying that if they knew he is Giorgios's son, the baby would be dressed in gold and silver. The queen, Giorgios's mother, overhears the song and Maria explains everything, then a retinue go to the grave to rescue the prince: they light up incenses and toss them inside the grave to distract the fairies, then take Giorgios with them. Later, Ophis goes to Giorgios's castle, asks for some water and drops his ring in a jug. Maria learns her first husband Ophis is there, and both men begin to dispute whom she should be with. A priest suggests they place Maria atop a hill with each man on one side of her, Ophis with water and Giorgios holding nuts and her baby. Maria asks Ophis for water, but dies, fulfilling her mother's curse.\n\n\n== See also ==\nThe Dragon-Prince and the Stepmother (Turkish tale)\nChampavati (Indian tale)\nThe Enchanted Snake (Italian tale)\nThe King of the Snakes\nThe Story of the Hamadryad\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Faculty of Law of Charles University (Czech: Právnická fakulta Univerzity Karlovy) is one of the original four faculties of Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic. Founded in 1348 by Charles IV on the basis of a bull of Pope Clement VI, it is the oldest law school in the Czech Republic and Central Europe.\n\n\n== History and notable people ==\nIn 1372, the faculty separated into an independent university of law, which was dissolved at the beginning of the Hussite Wars. The law school was not reestablished until 1624. The present law school derives its form from the division of the entire university into Czech and German parts in 1882.\nAmong the school's notable academics, scholars and graduates are Alois von Brinz, Joseph Unger, Eduard Herbst, Emil Sax, Leopold Hasner von Artha, Hans Kelsen, Josef Kaizl, Alois Rašín, presidents of Czechoslovakia Edvard Beneš and Emil Hácha, Milada Horáková, prime ministers of the Czech Republic Petr Pithart and Stanislav Gross, Vice-President of the European Commission Věra Jourová, presidents of the Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic and Czechoslovakia Karel Baxa, Pavel Rychetský and Josef Baxa. Honorary members of the lawyers' association based on the faculty include Václav Klaus, former president of the Czech Republic, and Sir Roger Scruton.\n\n\n== Organization of study ==\n\nThe school offers a five-year magister degree program in law, which is completed by a state examination and the defense of a thesis. Teaching takes the form of lectures, seminars, moot courts and internships. After passing the state rigorous examination, which includes the defense of the rigorous thesis, the graduates can receive the academic degree Doctor of Law (JUDr.). Students can continue their studies in the four-year doctoral program, graduates of which receive the doctorate (Ph.D.).\nThe school also offers postgraduate specialized Master of Laws (LL.M.) courses for both Czech and foreign lawyers, including five specializations in English: The Law and Business in the Czech Republic and Central Europe, International Human Rights Law and Protection of Environment, Health and Law, International Disputes Settlement and Competition Law.\nAs of 2024, the school is ranked 1st in the Czech Republic and 176–200 in the world by Times Higher Education.\n\n\n== International cooperations ==\nThe school cooperates with dozens of law schools and universities in student and academic exchanges. In addition to Erasmus Programme and European universities, the school has cooperation agreements with Tel Aviv University, Bar Ilan University, National University of Singapore, Soochow University, University of San Francisco, Nova Southeastern University and South Texas College of Law, among others.\n\n\n== Faculty building ==\n\nThe law school is housed in a listed Neoclassical building constructed between 1924 and 1931 on the bank of the Vltava River, a significant architectural landmark designed by Jan Kotěra. \nIts marble main hall has become a popular location for domestic and foreign filmmakers. The building served as headquarters of the Nazi authorities in a couple of films and was actually the headquarters of the Waffen-SS during World War II. It has appeared in scenes featuring Karel Čapek's lectures and Joseph Goebbels' speeches.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

It was created as a guarantee company so that both MPs could keep describing themselves as \"Independent Labor\" after the Australian Labor Party attempted to restrict the use of the word \"Labor\".\nMutton was re-elected in Coburg for the BMLP in 1947 and 1950.\nAt the 1949 federal election, Bourke was abolished as a seat and Blackburn contested the new division of Wills. She had 20.6% of the vote, but was unsuccessful.\nDaniel Healy contested the 1949 Brunswick state by-election for the party, receiving 19.8% of the vote.\nIn October 1950, the party merged into the new Progressive Labor Party.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 38th Mississippi Infantry Regiment, later redesignated as the 38th Mississippi Mounted Infantry, was a unit of the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. The regiment fought in numerous battles across Mississippi as an infantry unit, and in 1864 was reorganized as a mounted infantry regiment. As the 38th was assigned to a cavalry brigade after 1864, it is sometimes inaccurately referred to as the 38th Mississippi Cavalry, although this designation was never official.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe volunteer companies of the 38th Regiment were organized in the spring of 1862 and assembled at Jackson.  The Regiment was sent to Corinth and arrived at the end of the siege a few days before the Confederate garrison  was evacuated to Tupelo. The 38th was then assigned to Colonel John D. Martin's brigade and was present at the Battle of Iuka, where commanding officer Colonel Fleming W. Adams was wounded and command of the Regiment passed to Lieutenant Colonel Preston Brent.\n\nAt the battle of Corinth, the regiment was sent to attack the defensive works, taking heavy fire, and the brigade commander Colonel John D. Martin was killed. The regiment was then sent to the defensive lines of Vicksburg, arriving in February 1863. Several men of the 38th were killed or wounded during the siege of Vicksburg, coming under fire from sharpshooters or hit by explosions when Union forces set off mines under the fortifications. The 38th fended off major attacks on the defensive lines on May 19, May 22, and June 25. Lieutenant Colonel Preston Brent was wounded in the trenches at Vicksburg and command of the Regiment passed to Major R.C. Mccay. On July 4, 1863, the Vicksburg garrison surrendered and the 38th regiment was paroled until it could be exchanged. Many of the men deserted after Vicksburg and evaded attempts to return them to service.\nIn January 1864, the regiment was reorganized as the 38th Mounted Infantry. As a mounted infantry regiment, the 38th was expected to ride with cavalry regiments, and dismount from their horses for infantry combat. The 38th joined other cavalry units as part of H.P. Mabry's brigade, tasked with opposing Federal raids across Mississippi. After skirmishes with Union troops during the Yazoo expedition, Mabry's brigade was assigned to General Nathan Bedford Forrest's command. During the Battle of Tupelo on July 14, commanding officer of the regiment Major R.C. McCay was killed, and all but one of the other regimental officers of the 38th were killed or wounded.\nThe remainder of the Regiment under Mabry's command took part in various skirmishes with Union cavalry in late 1864, before being reassigned to Wirt Adam's brigade and consolidated into a combined regiment with the 14th Mississippi Cavalry and 3rd Mississippi State Troops. This combined unit fought a final skirmish at the Sipsey River on April 6, 1865, before surrendering under General Richard Taylor on May 4.\n\n\n== Commanders ==\nCommanding officers of the 38th Mississippi Infantry:\n\nCol. Fleming W. Adams, wounded at Iuka, resigned 1862.\nCol. Preston Brent, wounded at Vicksburg.\nLt. Col. Walter L. Keirn, wounded at Corinth, resigned 1864.\nLt. Col. James H. Jones\nMaj. R.C. McCay, killed at Tupelo.\n\n\n== Organization ==\nCompanies of the 38th Mississippi Infantry:\n\nCo. A, \"Holmes County Volunteers\"\nCo. B, \"Van Dorn Guards\" of Claiborne County\nCo.

        "content": "Atsızism (Turkish: Atsızcılık) is a far-right ideology based on the thoughts of Nihal Atsız, a Turkish ultranationalist writer and ideologue.\n\n\n== History ==\nAtsızism is known for its hardcore Turkish nationalism, Pan-Turkism, Turanism, and racism. Atsız viewed Turkish nationalism as being empty if Pan-Turkism and Turanism were not included in it. Although the term \"Turanism\" refers to the unity of all Ural-Altaic peoples (including Turkic peoples), Atsız used \"Turanism\" as a mere synonym of \"Pan-Turkism\", he had the goal of uniting only the Turkic peoples and did not care about other Ural-Altaic peoples. A famous quote of Atsız was \"a Turk has no friend except for another Turk.\" He also stated \"we are not Europeans, we are Asians and we are cold as ice, and above all, we are Turks.\"\nAtsız was also a fierce critic of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and much of his policies, although his negative views on Atatürk calmed after the 1960 coup. He claimed that Kemalism had too much foreign elements. He described Atatürk's \"Peace at Home, Peace in the World\", as \"extinguishing the spiritual energy of the nation\" and stated that \"nations are obliged to make invasions and prospections in order to spread their own lineage and dominate the earth.\"\nAtsız was a staunch anti-communist during his entire career, and had referred to it as \"a very harmful ideology to us.\" He hated İsmet İnönü and his government due to their cooperation with communists. Atsız was openly and proudly racist, although according to him, racism was \"not about measuring heads, analysing blood, or counting seven ancestors as a couple of phony zanies claimed\", and during the Racism-Turanism trials, he stated that he considers mixed Turks as Turks as long as they serve Turkishness and don't have any loyalty to their other race.\nAtsız considered all Turkic peoples worldwide of having the same blood, and therefore being equally Turks, although \"alien people\" living in Turkey are not Turks even if they speak fluent Turkish and feel culturally Turkish.\nAtsız harshly condemned Kemalism, the founding ideology of the Republic of Turkey. He also perceived Kemalism as lacking Turanism and Pan-Turkism, and therefore unqualified to be considered a Turkish nationalist ideology. According to Atatürk's nationalism during the Early Republican Period (1923–50), every citizen of Turkey is a Turk, and that ethnic and religious origins do not matter as long as they feel like Turks and identify as Turkish. Atsızism was described as being based entirely on race and lineage. Atsız also criticised the nationalism of Ziya Gökalp and Hamdullah Suphi Tanrıöver because he perceived it as not being nationalist enough.\nAtsız was extremely Antisemitic, referring to Jews as being among \"the internal enemies\" of Turks, although he admired how Jews revived their dead language and \"retook the land they lost 2,000 years ago\", which he viewed as an example of what a strong sense of nationalism can achieve. He also referred to Jews as being \"the secret enemies of all nations.\"\nAtsız believed that Turks and non-Turks should not intermarry under any circumstance, and that nationalism was much more important than love. He also believed that nationalism was superior than any religion, especially Islam, which is against nationalism.\nInitially, Atsız referred to Islam as the \"national religion\" of Turks, although he became a staunch critic of Islam later. Atsız claimed that Arabs had created Islam as a way to form a union, due to their lack of unity before Islam. Atsız even described Islam as \"a religion created by Arabs, for Arabs\". He denied the existence of Allah, and claimed that the Quran was entirely made up and written by Muhammad himself and falsely attributed to Allah. Atsız advocated for Turks to return to theur Pre-Islamic beliefs. He was among the first to use \"Tanrı\" to refer to God, instead of \"Allah\" which was the common term for God during his time used even by non-Muslims. Atsız especially hated Pan-Islamism, and claimed that Turks were a great nation before they accepted Islam, and that they only need unity with other Turkic people rather than other Muslims. Atsız believed that a Turkic union needed war to be achieved.\nAtsız also favored Nazi Germany during their war with the Soviet Union, and was even accused of being inspired by Adolf Hitler, although he denied these claims as he already started forming Atsızism before Hitler rose to popularity in Turkey.\nAtsız especially and namely hated Arabs, Armenians, Kurds, Greeks, Persians, Han Chinese, Bulgarians, Serbs, Croats, Bosniaks, Romanians, Europeans, Blacks, Japanese, Jews, Pashtuns, Americans, Circassians, Chechens, Abazins, Albanians, Pomaks, Laz, Lezgins, and Georgians.\nAtsızism influenced a type of Turkish nationalism known as Idealism, which was later associated with Alparslan Türkeş, who agreed with the nationalism of Atsızism, but not the hatred of Islam. Idealism was designed to pick nationalism whenever nationalism and Islam contradict. Atsız believed that Turkish nationalism and Islamism are incompatible, and that Türkeş was desperately trying to force two contradictory ideologies together, and he had criticised him multiple times for it. Muhsin Yazıcıoğlu further divided Idealism on the topic of what to choose when nationalism and Islam contradict each other.   \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Tren Suburbano de Monterrey is a future commuter rail line in Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico. The cost of the project will be 12 billion pesos, Phase 1, of which 3 billion come from the federal government of Mexico, via Fonadin, another 3 billion via Banobras and 6 billion from the private initiative, under a private-public association scheme. Samuel García clarified that in 2022 they intend to start with the technical studies of the project themselves that will cost up to 500 million pesos.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2005, José Eduardo Siller Aguirre, CEO of the company Ferromuro Integral Internacional, began making proposals for a suburban train in Monterrey.\nIn 2010, the suburban train project was submitted to the state administration, which showed interest and at its request deepened the relevant studies to prototype and design even more.\nIn 2019, the federal government and the government of Nuevo León signed an agreement to strengthen the mobility of the state by building 100 kilometers of tracks for the García-Airport Suburban Train.\nThe agreement involves releasing 172 kilometers of railroad tracks from freight trains, enabling the construction of a light passenger train that, in its first stage, would go from Monterrey International Airport to the municipality of García, whose investment would be at 13 billion pesos.\nThis route would have a route of 62 kilometers and will cross the municipalities of Apodaca, Monterrey, San Nicolás de los Garza, San Pedro Garza García, Santa Catarina and García. This project was originally planned with 22 intermediate stations, two terminals and three intermodal stations. It would connect with the Ecovía and Metrorrey Lines 1 and 2.\nAccording to the Secretariat of Communications and Transport (SCT), it could serve 850,000 passengers and would serve part of the 11 million that use Monterrey airport each year.\nA year later, in March 2020, the suburban train project was presented to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property (IMPI) making requests for an administrative declaration of trade infringement against the Governor of Nuevo León, the Secretary of Sustainable Development of the State of Nuevo León and the Director General of the Metrorrey Collective Transport System.\nOn November 20, 2021, the new Governor of Nuevo León, Samuel García, cut the project of the suburban train, arguing that it would only be a first stage that would be in Monterrey; however, he argued that it would not be expanded to García because \"this was an occurrence of El Bronco, because it is not sufficiently populated to give the capacity\".Although the project to build the suburban train was approved by the Federal Government by President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, in the last months of 2021, from 2022 the plans to build the project changed by the State Government. In April 2022, the state administration announced its interest in reviving the construction of the Tren Suburbano, although the original project, signed in 2019, had a route of 62 kilometers and the one that was announced in 2022 was only 29 kilometers.\nInitially, it was envisaged that the Tren Suburbano would reach Apodaca, but the governor of Nuevo León, Samuel García, said that the necessary adjustments were made to achieve the extension to the municipality of Pesquería and thus benefit those who come to work at industrial plants in the region.\n\n\n== References ==",

The main characters are the slightly eccentric investigator and accomplice to the robbery of the century, Prokop Král (Matěj Hádek), who is released after 15 years in hiding, and the capable and successful lawyer Lenka Braunová (Tereza Hofová). Together they form an opposite and sparkling couple, which, however, works very well. Under the baton of office chief Rudolf Černý (Miroslav Donutil) and with the help of novice lawyer Jiří Mladý (Jan Cina), they investigate various cases and help people who cannot or do not want to go to the police. No crime, no mystery is unsolvable for them. They are not police officers, so they have to solve clients' cases without a criminal background - with wit, a surprising action, a new, unexpected view of the crime or its perpetrator.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nMatěj Hádek as Prokop Král – private investigator and accomplice to the robbery of the century\nTereza Hofová as JUDr. Lenka Braunová – barrister\nMiroslav Donutil as JUDr. Rudolf Černý – barrister\nJan Cina as Mgr.

The country currently imports nearly all date products from Iran, Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and other South Asian and Middle Eastern countries.\nAfghan date farming exists in the provinces of Nangarhar, Kandahar, Helmand, Nimruz, Farah and a few others. Various types of dates are produced in the country. In the past, Afghans have been establishing date farms in neighboring Iran and Pakistan. The quality of Afghan dates has yet to be tested but preliminary reports indicate that Afghanistan's climate is very suitable for producing good quality dates. A confirmation of this would naturally make the product reach consumers in China, countries of Central Asia, Russia, and beyond. This is especially so after the completion of the new dams in the country.\n\n\n== See also ==\nEconomy of Afghanistan\nMinistry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "Sakha Omuk (Yakut: Саха Омук, lit. 'Sakha people' or 'Sakha nation') was a political party active in the Yakut Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic and the Sakha Republic during the dissolution of the Soviet Union and early post-Soviet Russia. Ideologically supportive of Yakut autonomy and nationalism, it brought about the Yakut ASSR's declaration of sovereignty during the parade of sovereignties.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe founding congress of Sakha Omuk took place during June 1990. The president of Sakha Omuk was Andrei Borisov, a popular theatre director and a member of the Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union. Sakha Omuk was named after a Yakut anti-Soviet organisation of the same name, which had existed from 1920 to 1928.\nSakha Omuk's founding came during a period of growing national consciousness among Yakuts. The de jure autonomy of the Yakut Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic had been eroded by successive Soviet governments to the point where the region was de facto part of Russia. Further, the arrival of thousands of Slavic labour migrants to work in Yakutia's mining industry had caused a massive demographic shift, with Yakuts dropping from 90% of the population in 1920 to 33.4% by 1989. 99% of the income from these industries was taken by the central Soviet government, leaving the regional population, particularly ethnic Yakut, in destitute living conditions. As a result of these factors, popular anger at the Soviet system reached a boiling point among Yakuts in the later half of the 1980s, with riots in the regional capital of Yakutsk in 1986.\nSakha Omuk, working alongside fellow nationally minded groups Sakha Keskile and Kut-Sür, brought together intellectual voices in an effort to promote Yakut autonomy. The party found early victories in electing reform-minded deputies to various legislatures, electing Mikhail Nikolayev (de jure a member of the party, though he later had strained relations with them), and passing the Yakut declaration of sovereignty amidst the parade of sovereignties.\nFollowing the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Sakha Omuk advocated for greater interconnectedness between the Yakut and the Turkic peoples within the Commonwealth of Independent States. On the other hand, the party, particularly members of the radical wing led by the party's vice-president Vladimir Nikolayev resisted Slavic labour migration, seeking to deny citizenship to temporary workers and promote the voluntary emigration of non-Yakut. In April 1992, the party protested against President Nikolayev, calling on him to pass the constitution, which proclaimed Yakutia as sovereign and having the right to self-determination.\nEven after President Nikolayev began to distance himself from Sakha Omuk, the party continued to retain significant stature within the government, and despite its self-proclaimed status as \"constructive opposition\", its members held multiple ministries. It was also closely connected to the Democratic Party of Russia.\nSakha Omuk managed only a minor showing in the 1993 election to the State Assembly of the Sakha Republic, owing to waning popularity and many Yakuts' distrust for political parties after the Soviet period. The party ultimately dissolved in 1994, and its members continued to focus on strengthening Yakut influence in the region, particularly in the Assembly.\n\n\n== Electoral results ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Beacon Light was a lighthouse in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada. It was located in the Saint John Harbour's entrance and sat atop a wooden pier in the harbour. It was first erected in 1828 and rebuilt in 1868 after being destroyed by fire the year prior. It was discontinued in 1913 and burned.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Beacon Light was first erected in 1828, located in the Saint John Harbour in Saint John, New Brunswick. It sat atop a wooden pier in the harbour and was the second lighthouse in New Brunswick at the time, with a construction cost of £672 3s 3d. One of the earliest keepers, William Gold, was appointed in April 1830 and served until his death in April the following year. On the morning of January 7, 1867, the lighthouse was destroyed by fire while the keeper was absent, leaving the harbour completely reliant on Partridge Island's lighthouse. The keeper's two sons, who were present during the fire, managed to save four reflectors before escaping. The Colonial Government took notice of the Beacon Light's temporary discontinuation due to the fire.\n\n\n=== Second lighthouse ===\nIn 1868, John McLachlan rebuilt the lighthouse and pier at a cost of $2,300. During October 4–5 the following year, a tropical cyclone dubbed the \"Saxby Gale\" produced large waves throughout the Bay of Fundy region. The Beacon Light received extensive damage, including the tearing off of shingles, boards, and part of the pier, resulting in repair costs totalling $898. Over the next few years, the station underwent multiple installations, including a large fog bell for the lighthouse in 1871, a bell tower on the pier in 1875, and additional machinery. Maintenance repairs were frequently needed for the pier due to being in the open harbour waters.In 1913, the Beacon Light was discontinued, when on August 20, 1913, it was set to be removed as part of a plan to widen the entrance of the harbour. The lighthouse was set to be drenched with oil and set ablaze \"on the first night when the wind blows seaward.\" It was replaced by a combined gas and whistling buoy.\n\n\n== List of keepers ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of lighthouses in New Brunswick\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Venetian slave trade refers to the slave trade conducted by the Republic of Venice, primarily from the early to the late Middle Ages.  The slave trade was a contributing factor to the early prosperity of the young Republic of Venice as a major trading empire in the Mediterranean Sea. \nThe Venetian slave trade were divided in to several separe trading routes. In the Balkan slave trade, Venetian merchants bought Pagan war captives and then sold them to Southern Europe or to the Middle East via the Aegean Islands. \nIn the later Black Sea slave trade, the Venetians established colonies in the Crimea, and aquired slaves of various religions to sell to Southern Europe via Crete and the Baleares, or to the Middle East directly via the Black Sea. \nThe Venetians met competition in the slave trade by the Republic of Genoa. \nBoth slave routes were closed of to Venice due to the conquests of the Ottoman Empire in the 15th-century and integrated in to the Ottoman slave trade. This ended the old import routes of slaves to Europe, which contributed to the development of the Atlantic slave trade to provide the European colonies in America with slave labor. \n\n\n== Background ==\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, informal slave zones were formed alongside religious borders. Both Christians and Muslims banned the enslavement of people of their own faith, but both approved of the enslavement of people of a different faith.\nThe slave trade thus organized alongside religious principles. While Christians did not enslave Christians, and Muslims did not enslave Muslims, both did allow the enslavement of people they regarded to be heretics, which allowed Catholic Christians to enslave Orthodox Christians, and Sunni Muslims to enslave Shia Muslims.\nThere was still a market for slavery in medieval Europe in the early middle ages, but it gradually started to be phased out in favor of serfdom. However, there was a major market for slavery in the Muslim Middle East, and European slaves were referred to in the Muslim world as saqaliba. The Republic of Venice was one of the early supplyers of saqaliba slaves to the Muslim world. \nSlavery died out in Western Europe after the 12th-century, but the demand for laborers after the Black Death resulted in a revival of slavery in Southern Europe in Italy and in Spain, as well as an increase in the demand for captives to slavery in Egypt.\n\n\n== Supply ==\n\nSlave trade in the Republic of Venice was in fact divided in two major separate slave trades. Both of them provided primarily Pagan slaves to Southern Europe and, to a larger extent, the Muslim world. The two major routes were the Balkan slave trade and the Black Sea slave trade. \n\n\n=== Balkan slave trade ===\n\nThe Balkan slave trade went by route from the Balkans via Venetian slave traders across the Adriatic and the Aegean Seas to the Islamic Middle East, from the 7th-century until the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans in the 15th-century.\nUntil the 6th- and 7th-century, the Balkans belonged to the Byzantine Empire, but was split by invasions of the Avars, Slavic tribes and other peoples. The new peoples populating the Balkans did not initially create any centralized state, which created a situation of permanent political instability on the Balkans. The various tribes conducted warfare against each other and took war captives. Due to the lack of a centralized state to negotiate for ransom, a habit formed in which war captives from the tribal wars on the Balkans were often sold to merchants from the Republic of Venice at the Adriatic coast. \nThis developed in to a major slave trade in which Venetians bought captives from the Balkans whom they sold to the Byzantine Empire and the Islamic Middle East, which contributed to the growth of Venice as a major commercial empire by the 11th-century.\nThe slaves bought by the Venetians at the Adriatic coast were transported by the Venetians to the slave market at the Aegean Islands were the majority continued to Egypt.\n\n\n=== Black Sea slave trade ===\n\nItalian merchants, particularly the Genoese and Venetians, who had a large web of contacts as traders in the Mediterranean Sea, early established themselves in the Black Sea slave trade. Initially they did so as travelling merchants, but eventually they managed to acquire their own trading colonies in the Crimea.\nIn the 13th-century Byzantine control in the Crimea weakened by the fall of Constantinople 1204, and Italian trade colonies took control over the Black Sea slave trade, with the Republic of Venice establishing in Sudak in the Crimea in 1206 and later in Tana, and the Republic of Genoa in Caffa in 1266.\nThe majority of the slaves in the Italian Black Sea slave trade came to be enslaved via three main methods; as war captives during warfare, such as the Mongol invasions, the wars between the Golden Horde and the Ilkhanate, and the conquests of Timur Lenk; via slave raids; or through parents selling their own children or relatives to slavery, which occurred because of poverty and was a regular and common occurrence especially after the Black Death, when the demand for slaves was high in both Southern Europe and the Middle East.\nCommon targets of slavery were Pagan Finno-Ugric and Turkish people.\nIn parallel with the establishment of the Italian colonies in the Crimea, the Mongol Empire conquered Russia, and the Italian Black Sea slave trade expanded in parallel with the Mongol warfare, with the Mongols encouraging the trade, using it to dispose of particularly Russian slaves; up until the Russian Uprising of 1262, for example, the Mongols sold Russian peasants who were unable to pay tribute to the Italian slave traders in the Crimea.\n\n\n== Slave market ==\n\nThe slave market were divided in two. South Europe were supplyed with male slaves for hard labor or female slaves for domestic house work as enslaved maidservants. \nThe Islamic market of the Middle East requested female slaves as domestic house slaves or for sexual slavery as harem concubines; castrated male slaves for eunuchs or intact male slaves for military slavery as slave soldiers. \nThe Balkan slave trade was, alongside the Black Sea slave trade, one of the two main slave supply sources of future Mamluk soldiers to the Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt. A smaller number of slaves were sold in Italy and Spain as enslaved domestic servants, called ancillae.\nThe Italian Black Sea slave trade had two main routes; from the Crimea to Byzantine Constantiople, and via Crete and the Balearic Islands to Italy and Spain; or to the Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt, which received the majority of the slaves.\nFrom at least 1382 onward, the majority of the mamluks of the Egyptian Mamluk sultanate with slave origin came from the Black Sea slave trade; around a hundred Circassian males intended for mamluks were being trafficked via the Black Sea slave trade until the nineteenth-century.\nThe majority of the slaves trafficked to South Europe (Italy and Spain) were girls, since they were intended to become ancillae maid servants, while the majority of the slaves, around 2,000 annually, were trafficked to the Egyptian Mamluk Sultanate, in that case most of them boys, since the Mamluk sultanate needed slave soldiers.\n\n\n== End of the slave trade ==\nThe Venetian slave trade from the Balkans gradually ended in parallel with the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans during the 15th century. The slave trade from the Balkans was ended as a separate slave trade and was overtaken by the Ottomans and incorporated into the Ottoman slave trade, which in the Balkans was connected to the Crimean slave trade. \nVenetian slave traders were not able to compete with Ottoman-Crimean competition. After this, they acquired a smaller number of slaves from Ottoman slave traders via the Trans-Saharan slave trade. The Venetian slave trade was however soon supplanted in Europe by the Atlantic slave trade of the 16th century.\nAfter the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, the Ottomans closed the trade between the Crimea and the West. The slave trade gradually diminished, and in 1472, only 300 slaves are registered to have been trafficked from Caffa.\nFrom the 1440s, Spain and Portugal started to import their slaves from first the Canary Islands, and then from Africa; initially via the Trans-Saharan slave trade from Libya, and then by starting the Transatlantic slave trade.\nThe Ottoman Empire and the Crimean Khanate conquered the Italian cities in the Crimea in 1475, and the slave trade was then taken over by Muslim slave traders.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSlavery in Egypt\nGenoese slave trade\nSlavery in the Abbasid Caliphate\n\n\n== References ==",

It was produced by Mario Luciano, Leo Son, and Boi Yanel.\n\n\n== Composition ==\nThe track sees Joyner Lucas delving into the complexities of fame and the challenges of dealing with criticism and betrayal. Reflecting on his personal struggles, he raps, \"I've seen my whole family stab my back, I should have known / They say sticks and stones will break your bones, I'm sticks and stones\". Conway the Machine's verse features his own reflections on overcoming adversity.\n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe single's release was accompanied by a music video. Directed by Trevor Finney, it shows clips of Lucas and Conway the Machine in New York City, traversing the streets with their crews in Times Square.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",
