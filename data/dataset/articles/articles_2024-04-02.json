        "content": "The 2025 FIVB Volleyball Men's U21 World Championship will be the 23rd edition of the FIVB Volleyball Men's U21 World Championship, contested by the men's national teams under the age of 21 of the members of the Fédération Internationale de Volleyball (FIVB), the sport's global governing body. It will be held in August–September 2025 in a host nation to be determined.\nStarting with this edition, the tournament will be expanded to include 24 teams instead of the 16 teams of previous editions, following the decision adopted by FIVB in June 2023.\nIran are the defending champions.\n\n\n== Competition formula changes ==\nIn June 2023 during a three-day meeting in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, the FIVB Board of Administration approved the proposal made by its Volleyball Council to increase the number of participating teams to 24 in its Age Group World Championships (U19 and U21 in both genders). Consequently, the distribution of quotas by confederation for the Women's U21 World Championship was modified regarding previous editions, ensuring one automatic quota for the defending champion and assigning two quotas based on the corresponding FIVB Age Group World Ranking.\nThe new competition formula was in line with the one adopted for the 2023 FIVB Volleyball Boys' U19 World Championship, which was also contested by 24 teams.\n\n\n== Host selection ==\nOn 28 March 2024, FIVB opened the bidding process for member associations whose countries were interested in hosting one of the four Age Group World Championships in 2025 (i.e., U19 Boys' and Girls' World Championships and U21 Men's and Women's World Championships). The expression of interest of the member associations had to be submitted to FIVB by 30 April 2024, 18:00 CEST (UTC+2).\n\n\n== Qualification ==\nA total of 24 national teams will qualify for the final tournament. In addition to the host team and the defending champions who qualified automatically, 20 other teams will qualify through five separate continental competitions which were required to be held no later than 31 December 2024. Two remaining teams will enter the tournament via the Men's U21 FIVB World Ranking (as of 31 December 2024) among the teams not yet qualified.\nThe slot allocation per confederation was set as follows:\n\nDefending champion (China): 1\nAVC (Asia & Oceania): 4\nCAVB (Africa): 3\nCEV (Europe): 6\nCSV (South America): 3\nNORCECA (North, Central America and Caribbean): 4\nHost: 1\nTop teams not yet qualified as per Women's U21 FIVB World Ranking: 2\n\n\n== See also ==\n2025 FIVB Volleyball Women's U21 World Championship\n\n\n== References ==",

It runs for around 0.56 miles (0.90 km), from Monument Way, in Monument Square, in the southwest to Mountfort Street, at the foot of Munjoy Hill, in the northeast. Its middle section was wiped out by the widening of Franklin Street in 1967.\nIt forms the southern boundaries of both Lincoln Park (established in 1866) and Eastern Cemetery (1668). Both are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nUpon its completion in 2023, 201 Federal Street became the tallest building without a steeple in Maine, at 204.5 feet (62.3 m), surpassing Franklin Towers. It is the third-tallest building in the state overall, behind the Agora Grand Event Center in Lewiston. \n\n\n== Intersections ==\nThe following major streets intersect with Federal Street (from southwest to northeast):\n\nMonument Square\nTemple Street\nExchange Street\nMarket Street\nPearl Street\nIndia Street\nMountfort Street\n\n\n== Notable addresses ==\nNortheast to southwest:\n\nJohn Parrs House (c. 1847), 16 Federal Street\n56–58 Federal Street\nSt. Peter Parish Church (1929), 72 Federal Street\n75 Federal Street\n96 Federal Street (1867) and 100 Federal Street (1900), included in the India Street Historic District upon its formation\nCumberland County Courthouse (1910), main entrance formerly on Federal Street, now on Newbury Street\nEdward T. Gignoux United States Courthouse (1908), 156 Federal Street (listed on the National Register of Historic Places). It was the first federal courthouse in Maine\nPrinters' Exchange Block (1866), southeastern corner of Exchange Street and Federal Street\nPress Herald Building (1923), northeastern corner of Exchange Street and Federal Street\n201 Federal Street, tallest building in Portland\nThe 1866 fire of Portland resulted in the loss of the Quaker Meeting House (built in 1796) and First Baptist Church (built in 1811).\nThe United States Hotel (built in 1803) formerly stood at the southwestern end of Federal Street, at Market Square (now Monument Square), behind the original city hall.\nWhen the Cumberland County Courthouse was built in 1910, the Charles F. Jones Block, the Goodwin House and the Kennard House were demolished.\nThe previous construction at 201–205 Federal Street was owned by F. S. Waldron Realty Company.\nThe construction of Portland's Central Fire Station, on Congress Street, in 1925, resulted in the demolition of several Federal Street homes and businesses.\n\n\n== References ==",

On September 28, 1961, the Big Eight Conference ruled that Colorado would have to forfeit all of their conference wins since Colorado player Wilky Gilmore played in organized summer league outside of college in the summer of 1960. The ruling vacated six of Colorado's conference wins, revising the Buffaloes' conference record from 7–7 to 1–13. This caused Colorado to drop from a fifth-place conference standing to last.\n^B.  Joe Harrington coached the first 14 games of the season, going 5–9 and 0–3 in conference play before resigning. Ricardo Patton was named interim coach and went 7–20 and 3–13 in conference for the remainder of the season.\n\n\n== References ==",

The new system uses LED message boards at the start-finish line and lighting systems around the speedway to alert drivers and spectators of important on-track happenings, like green, yellow and red flags. This new feature will remove the flagman from trackside, keeping them out of harms' way.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Latrine is a poem by the German poet Günter Eich. It was published in the journal Der Ruf in 1946 and included in Eich's first post-war poetry collection, Remote Farmsteads, in 1948. The poem was written during or shortly after the Second World War, as a result of which Eich, a soldier in the Wehrmacht, became a prisoner of war of the United States.\nEich depicts what happens in a makeshift latrine, contrasting the beautiful spiritual contemplation with the excrement. He quotes the poem Andenken (Remembrance) by Friedrich Hölderlin, a poet who was particularly revered during the Nazi era, and contrasts it with a present marked by illness and death. The rhyming of \"Hölderlin\" with \"urine\" had a particularly shocking effect on contemporary reception. However, it was also seen as a break with outdated conventions and a signal for a new beginning in German literature after the Second World War. Latrine is considered a typical work of the genre called \"clear-cutting literature\" (German: Kahlschlagliteratur) and is one of Günter Eich's best-known poems.\n\n\n== Content ==\nThe poem begins with the verses:\n\nAs the lyrical subject wanders into the distance, perceiving wooded shores, gardens, and a stranded boat, the sound of excrement is heard.\n\nThe clouds are reflected in the urine in the snow. The ego recalls verses from Hölderlin's poem Andenken: \"But now go and greet / The beautiful Garonne\". The view downwards shows:\n\n\n== Background and origin ==\n\nThe genesis of Latrine has often been attributed to Eich's time as an American prisoner of war, where he was interned as a former soldier of the German Armed Forces in the \"Golden Mile\" camp near Sinzig and Remagen from April to the summer of 1945. Some of the poems from this period, such as Inventur, Lazarett, or Camp 16, are summarized under the term \"camp poems. When Eich's Collected Works was published in 1991, however, Axel Vieregg suggested that Latrine might have been written during Eich's basic training as a recruit in France in 1940, a period to which Vieregg also ascribed the poems Training Ground and Puy de Dôme, which have similar motifs. Latrine was first published in the seventh issue of the young journal Der Ruf by Alfred Andersch and Hans Werner Richter on November 15, 1946. In 1948, Eich included the poem in his poetry collection Remote Farmsteads, published by Georg Kurt Schauer with four woodcuts by Karl Rössing. It was not until 20 years after the first edition that Eich, who had become critical of many of his early poems, agreed to a new edition of this volume by Edition suhrkamp.\nA surviving first version of the poem Latrine consists of only two stanzas, which roughly correspond to the first and third stanzas of the later published version. There, Hölderlin's fevered verses still rhyme: \"In the reflection of the latrine / the whitest clouds drift.\" Robert Savage identifies three key semantic differences in the later final version: the change of rhyme from Hölderlin to urine, Hölderlin's verses no longer sounding \"in fever\" but \"crazy\" and the added \"purity\" of the clouds. He attributes this development to Eich's changed perspective in the post-war period, in which he was no longer only concerned with the contrast between dirt and poetry, but also with their historical entanglement. For example, while the distortion of Hölderlin's verses in the first version was still due to the narrator's fever, the  \"crazy\" of the final version allows for the expanded possibility of a general misdirection or aberration of Hölderlin's poetry under National Socialism.\nThe poem Andenken, which Eich quotes at the beginning of the last verse, is one of Friedrich Hölderlin's late poems. Most interpreters assume that it was written in 1803. Hölderlin had spent several months in Bordeaux the previous year before returning to Stuttgart, where he arrived in June 1802 in a confused state after a long walk. The subject of the poem is Hölderlin's recollection of his sensual experiences in the South of France and their transformation into poetry. The last verse of the hymn is particularly well-known and often parodied: \"But what remains, the poets create.\" Kurt Binneberg suggests that Eich's reference to Hölderlin's poem may have resulted from a parallel life situation, the exodus to France, and its failure. Before he was drafted into the Second World War, Eich had memorized numerous poems as literary provisions, and the image of \"Hölderlin in the knapsack\" was also a symbol of the \"spiritual strengthening\" that was to be achieved among German soldiers. For example, the Hölderlin Society, founded under the patronage of Joseph Goebbels, saw it as its task to \"give every German student a Hölderlin booklet to take with him into the field\" using so-called field post editions. The Hölderlin Field Selection, co-published by the NSDAP Central Cultural Office, appeared in a print run of 100,000 copies and also included the poem Andenken.\n\n\n== Form and text analysis ==\nLatrine consists of four stanzas of four verses each, which form a heterogeneous cross rhyme. For Bruno Hillebrand, this fixed structure \"could formally be understood as a parody. And Dieter Breuer also describes \"the smooth, conventional versification is reduced to absurdity by the completely non-standard statement\". For Herbert Heckmann, the language remains limited to the essential, sober, and laconic. Eich does not interpret, he merely registers, without any rhetorical or aesthetic commitment. The verses are strung together as if in shorthand, with only the rhyme connecting the unrelated observations through a common rhythm. In the rhyme pattern as well as in the metrical structure, Werner Weber sees an alternation of stability and instability, order and disorder: every other verse ends without rhyme or unison: \"ditch\", \"flies\", \"shore\", \"decay\". In between are fixed, non-oscillating rhymes.\nFor Gerhard Kaiser, the metrics of the poem are derived entirely from Hölderlin's quoted verse, \"But now go and greet\" whose three liftings determine the entire poem. This, together with the meaningful rhymes, seems like a rigid grid compared to Hölderlin's free rhythms. Only Hölderlin's second stanza, \"the beautiful Garonne,\" stands out for its bi-locularity. Sound-wise, the beginning of the poem is dominated by an I-vowel, which carries the defensive sound of disgust, before the sound mood changes to euphony with the Ö-sound in Hölderlin and the Ü-rhyme. There is a similar development from discordant to melodious sound in the accumulations and alliterations of consonants: The cacophony \"claps [...] feces\" at the beginning turns into the euphony \"swaying [...] the clouds float\" at the end. For Kaiser, the \"glittering flies\" also convey a \"beauty of the disgusting.\nAccording to Kurt Binneberg, the poem's formal devices illustrate the radical contrast between latrine reality and imagined poetry, between beauty and ugliness. The first half of the poem presents an \"aesthetics of ugliness,\" whose images of disgust are heightened in the eighth stanza to an acoustic effect - the excrement \"claps. At the beginning of the third verse, a second acoustic effect responds: Hölderlin's verses, quoted in the second half of the poem, \"resound.\" In the middle of the poem, two completely different spheres collide: excrement and poetry. According to Binneberg, the fusion of opposites in the two contrasting halves of the poem is illustrated by the rhyme and sound connections as well as the semantic references, which suggest a parallelism between the first and third as well as the second and fourth stanzas. For example, the verses \" digging\" and \"echoing\" as well as \"flies\" and \"reflecting\" form an assonance, semantically the visual impression of the \" glittering\" flies is repeated in the reflecting clouds and the \"paper full of blood and urine\" corresponds with the verses recorded on paper. In the contrast between feces and poetry, the double rhyming word \"urine\" has a special meaning, which is set against \"Hölderlin\" the second time, which Binneberg calls \"a shocking rhyme\".\n\n\n== Interpretation ==\n\n\n=== Initial situation ===\n\nAccording to Gerhard Kaiser, the abrupt beginning must first reveal the initial situation of a prisoner of war caught between hardship, agony, and humiliation. From the fossilized excrement of constipation to the blood of an intestinal infection, to the \"mud of decay,\" all signs point to illness and death. In the embryonic posture of the squatting man, thrown back on mere metabolism, only the gaze roaming through nature remains free, but even this is trapped in a stranded boat. Peter Horst Neumann sees the stranded boat as a parody of Hölderlin's \"Good Voyage\" and at the same time as a symbol of failure, both for the individual and the German nation as a whole. The beauties of nature remain inaccessible to the ego, behind bars. His gaze is directed downward, where he can only perceive the purity of the clouds through the mirror of urine.\nFor Kaiser, the inversion of above and below in the image of the reflecting clouds symbolizes a world out of joint. In the poem, vertical movement prevails over horizontal, the \"below\" of the last movement responding to the \"above\" of the beginning. Like the prisoner's body, his mind is also dysfunctional, hallucinating \"erroneous\" Hölderlin verses, quoting Hölderlin's mental illness and transferring it to a lost, mad present. For Herbert Heckmann, the lyrical ego withdraws into mere observation in the face of a world that has gone off the rails. It describes a moment of his perception without passion, pathos, or sentimentality, and seeks salvation from its fear in a relentless vigilance that registers everything. Hans Dieter Schäfer refers to the conditions in prisoner-of-war camps, where tree trunks were used as latrines over trenches in the barbed wire fence. The prisoners often sought a mental escape from this reality in a remembered culture or natural phenomena. Like the poem, however, nature in Latrine remains inaccessible, limited to the function of a quotation.\n\n\n=== Contrast between reality and poetry ===\nFor Neumann, the latrine derives its tension, which reaches the limits of the bearable, from the contrast between distance from civilization and culture. On the one hand, public defecation means breaking one of the strongest taboos of civilization and a deep cultural humiliation. On the other hand, Hölderlin and his poem Andenken represent the world of poetry, serenity, humanity, and beauty, which seems so alien in the presence of the prisoner that it is only possible as a quotation. The \"crazy\" rhyme Hölderlin/Urin takes the combination of opposites to the extreme. According to Neumann, the simultaneity of two irreconcilable principles \"has probably never been so frighteningly captured in rhyme in German poetry as here.\nFor Kaiser, on the other hand, the opposites combine to manifest the human longing for beauty in excrement, despair, and madness. In the image of the clouds reflected in the urine, the purity of the clouds and the impurity of the urine, happiness and pain, illusion and disillusionment come together. A \"poetic reconstruction of the world\" is created in the latrine. Although the creation of the world through poetry is born out of humiliation, it ultimately proclaims the triumph of imagination and inspiration. By demonstrating the power of poetry to inspire hope in the face of the abyss, Latrine's poem confirms the last verse of Hölderlin's quoted Andenken: \"But what remains is created by the poets.\"\n\n\n=== Reference to Hölderlin ===\n\nMichael Kohlenbach reads the poem as a confrontation with Hölderlin, to whom Eich repeatedly referred in his later texts, for example in his prose poems Maulwürfe. Latrine is a veritable antithesis to Hölderlin's Andenken. Hölderlin's \"lulling airs\" become a \"stinking ditch,\" the ships of which Hölderlin says they \"bring together / the beauty of the earth\" are contrasted with a \"stranded boat\" in Eich's work, and while in Hölderlin, despite \"mortal / thoughts,\" what remains in the end is what the poets create, in Latrine decay takes hold. Gerhard Kaiser emphasizes the similar starting point of the two poems. Hölderlin's Andenken is also the expression of a longing to escape from the confines of the home into an ideal landscape. Ultimately, the poet was broken by the fact that he could no longer make sense of a history of salvation in the world. Eich goes one step further, in that in his hopelessly confused world, Hölderlin's creation of a spiritual landscape from a historical-philosophical context is only possible as a quotation.\nAccording to Kohlenbach, the spiritual reference to Hölderlin is still evident in Eich's contradiction to Hölderlin. In his translation of Hölderlin's verses into the present and their simultaneous alienation, Eich's poem should therefore also be understood as a \"poetic reparation\" to the author, who was ideologically exploited during the National Socialist era and thus became almost unreadable in 1945. While Martin Heidegger, for example, in 1943 drew from Hölderlin's Andenken the interpretation of the \"remaining in one's own\" of the German essence, the same poem in Eich's work proves its transience and becomes the measure of a historically conditioned alienation. Herbert Heckmann ultimately sees Hölderlin's rhyme with urine as a correction of the blatant distance between high style and reality that was created by the Third Reich's veneration of Hölderlin. Eich focuses on real things without exaggerating them through interpretation. Latrine is an attempt to relearn the falsified language out of shame.\nHans Dieter Schäfer refers to Eich's friend Martin Raschke, a writer who also wrote Nazi propaganda during the Third Reich. He introduced his collection Deutscher Gesang, published in 1940, which included Hölderlin's hymn Andenken with the words: \"Not written so that you forget yours when you read it, but so that you use it like a weapon.\" And in a front-line report two years later, he built a bridge from soldiers reading poetry by torchlight and a quote from Hölderlin's Andenken to the question: \"Wasn't the war [...] also fought for the global position of our language?\" For Schäfer, Eich satirizes his friend's attitude. By quoting Hölderlin's hymn, he contrasts \"a piece of misused cultural heritage\" with the truth forced upon us by defeat, thus dismantling the intention of war propaganda to \"authenticate the murder of the German classics.\n\n\n=== Perspective ===\nFor Kurt Binneberg, Latrine expresses the \"spiritual and existential disorientation\" of post-war Germany. The humanism in Hölderlin's verses turned out to be a utopia. They are as unreal as the clouds, which are now perceived only as reflections and can no longer be made part of the reality of the person for whom they float away beneath one's feet. What remains in the end is \"the empty urine mirror. Gerhard Kaiser, on the other hand, emphasizes that the clouds do not simply float away, but that they also carry with them the movement of the river, the Garonne, and thus the desires and hopes of those who remain physically trapped. The floating clouds evoke fantasies of flight, and their impulse to move is repeated in the swaying of the feet, reminiscent of numerous wanderers in German intellectual history, from Hölderlin himself to Büchner's Lenz, wandering through the countryside, simultaneously exhausted and yearning.\nPeter von Matt admires the fact that the speaker of the poem stands upright on \"wobbly feet. At a time when words seem impossible, he speaks of the brown cesspool of history that lies behind and beneath him. By confronting the unbearable, he helps to prevent forgetting. This is not only about general cultural criticism but also about Günter Eich's biography, who himself had written system-supporting radio plays with echoes of the blood-and-soil ideology of National Socialism during the Third Reich. In this respect, the poem does not herald a \"new beginning for an innocent generation,\" but rather Eich's work documents the entire \"literary process\" that has taken place in Germany since his first poems in 1927.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nAccording to von Matt, contemporary reception understood Latrine as a literary program that stood for clear-cutting and the zero hour. The poem was stylized as the birth of German literature after 1945, and Eich was celebrated as a pioneer by other writers, such as those in Group 47. In particular, the rhyming of \"Hölderlin\" with \"urine\" was a beacon for a radical new beginning, but it also caused shock and scandal among the public. Bruno Hillebrand also spoke of a \"cultural shock\" caused by the poem. In Norbert Rath's retrospective, when Latrine was first published, there was \"a certain excitement among some of Hölderlin's protectors,\" according to whom \"German culture had come to an end\" with this rhyme. For Gerhard Kaiser, Latrine heralded \"a modernity unprecedented in Germany\" at the time it was written.\nBenno von Wiese warned the reader in 1959 that Latrine \"is in no way suited to please you. But this is not its intention at all, for in its view of reality and its breaking of a taboo, it is much more likely to snub and shock the reader, but certainly not to enchant him. Six years later, Manfred Seidler criticized the \"pretentiousness [...], the deliberate exaggeration\" in the Urin-Hölderlin rhyme, for example, which he considered significant \"out of sheer insecurity toward such poetry. As late as 1972, Ludwig Büttner found the soldier's reality \"decidedly distorted\" and criticized it: \"What we dislike is the disgusting scene and the tasteless rhyme, which are presented in an artistic form to cause a stir and astonishment. [...] The deliberate shock effect distracts from the real and serious subject. [...] Through the latrine-like coarsening, however, the theme is turned into the serious and ridiculous, and the veneration of Hölderlin is belittled or ironized\". Werner Weber, on the other hand, asked in 1967: \"Is the poem disgusting, is it not moral?\" His answer was: \"The morality of the material is called form. Accordingly: A poem with a disgusting motif has become a beautiful poem, a moral poem, through fulfilled art.\" In 2007, Michael Braun spoke only of \"poetically well-dosed shocks, administered here in casually rhyming folk song verses.\nHeinz Ludwig Arnold saw Latrine as a \"necessary break with convention\" in which Eich did not destroy the literary canon but rather placed it in a new relationship. Poems like Latrine or Inventur are \"clear signals of the changed consciousness of a changed world. Eich wrote few such programmatic texts after the Second World War and soon turned to modern nature poetry. On the occasion of Eich's 100th birthday, Wulf Segebrecht noted that the poet's public recognition was based on only a handful of poems. Of these, Latrine \"attracted lasting attention,\" not least because of the scandal it caused. Joachim Scholl and Barbara Sichtermann summed up: \"The author never escaped the fame of these notorious verses for the rest of his life.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWerner Weber: Die Moral des Stoffs heißt Form.

It is specifically aimed at individuals who have demonstrated outstanding research or innovation that has the potential to advance medical science, particularly in areas related to diabetes, endocrinology, and biopharmaceutical science. The prize is administered by the Novo Nordisk Foundation, an independent Danish enterprise foundation.\n\n\n== Background ==\nEstablished by the Novo Nordisk Foundation, the prize reflects the Foundation's commitment to support health, scientific, and humanitarian efforts through research. The Foundation holds a controlling interest in the Danish pharmaceutical firm Novo Nordisk.\n\n\n=== History of the Novo Nordisk Prize ===\nThe prize, originally DKK 50,000 (approx $7,200), was first awarded on 16 February 1963. Since then, the amount awarded has gradually increased. The prize was called the Novo Prize from 1963 until 1989, when it was renamed the Novo Nordisk Prize. Until 2020 the Prize was given for a Danish contribution. In 2020, it has been decided to change the geographical scope of the prize and from 2021 the prize will be awarded for a European contribution. \n\n\n== Award ==\nThe Novo Nordisk Prize includes a monetary award, the amount of which can vary from year to year. Alongside the financial component, recipients are also awarded a medal and a diploma in recognition of their contributions. The prize is designed not only to honour exceptional scientific work but also to support the continued research efforts of the recipients.\n\n\n== Recipients of the Novo Nordisk Prize ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Marie Danielle Selvon, also known as Danielle Selvon, is a Mauritian politician and barrister. She has been actively involved in advocating for various social and political issues in Mauritius. Selvon had served as an Independent Member of Parliament and has been vocal about the need for transparency, accountability, and national unity in addressing key challenges faced by the country.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nIn 2014, Marie Danielle Selvon was elected as a Member of Parliament for Constituency No 1, representing the Alliance Lepep (MSM). During her tenure, she advocated for civil liberties, constitutional integrity, and the sovereignty of Mauritius over the Chagos Archipelago. Selvon has been a voice in the campaign for justice for the Chagossian people and has called for concerted actions to address the historical injustice perpetrated by the British colonial power.\n\n\n=== Resignation from MSM ===\nIn December 2015, Selvon resigned from her position in the MSM. The “highly controversial \"Good Governance and Integrity Reporting Bill,\" which would amend the Constitution and grant extrajudicial authority to a politically appointed agency under the Ministry of Good Governance to handle \"unexplained wealth,\" was the impetus behind this resignation.\n\n\n== New Political Party ==\nIn 2019, Selvon contested elections under the Reform Party but was not elected.\n\n\n== Advocacy and activism ==\nOutside of her political endeavors, Marie Danielle Selvon is a barrister with a focus on legal advocacy and activism. Marie Danielle Selvon has been an advocate for Mauritius' sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago. She has emphasized the importance of national unity and concerted actions in reclaiming Mauritius' sovereignty over the illegally excised territory. Selvon has called for collaboration with international bodies, including seeking arbitration from the International Court of Justice, to address the Chagos issue.\nMarie Danielle Selvon participated in a joint press conference held by the leaders of Linion Pep Morisien and Rassemblement Mauricien. During the conference, Nando Bodha announced plans for a peaceful demonstration in front of Newton Tower. The demonstration happened the following Monday and demanded the resignation or dismissal of Maneesh Gobin in the wake of the Stag Party affair. Selvon, along with other new members, including lawyer Mahen Saulick and Ashwin Dookun, President of the Pharmaceutical Association of Mauritius, joined the platform in support of this initiative. Jean-Claude Barbier, a member of Linion Pep Morisien (LPM), raised concerns about the situation in Agalega during the press conference. Barbier emphasized the importance of transparency and accountability regarding reports of a military base on the island, as highlighted by the Indian media. He urged the Prime Minister to provide clarity on the situation in Agalega, stating that the people of Mauritius have a right to know about developments on the island.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nSelvon resides on Royal Road in Grand-Gaube and remains actively engaged in both political and legal spheres, advocating for social justice and the rule of law.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The siege of Ascalon was launched by the Ayyubid sultan, As-Salih Ayyub, against the Hospitaller garrison of Ascalon. The Ayyubids managed to take control of Ascalon.\n\n\n== Background ==\nShortly after the Barons' Crusade of Theobald I of Navarre, Ascalon walls were repaired, and after the Battle of Forbie, some of the crusaders escaped to Ascalon. Shortly after a civil war between As-Salih Ayyub and Al-Salih Ismail, which ended in Ayyub's victory and the consolidation of Damascus under his control, Ayyub now gave his attention to the Crusaders. On June 17, 1247, Tiberias was captured, and soon afterwards, Mount Tabor and Belvoir fell to the Ayyubids. The Muslims then marched towards Ascalon.\n\n\n== Siege ==\nThe Ascalon fortifications were in good position and had a strong garrison of knights Hospitallers. The Hospitallers called for aid from Cyprus and Acre. Henry I of Cyprus sent a fleet of 8 galleys and 100 knights and went to Acre, where they joined the navy assembled at Acre and headed towards Ascalon. The Ayyubid assembled a fleet of 21 galleys who were blockading Ascalon, sailed to meet the Crusader navy, but before any engagement happens, a storm ran into the fleet and wrecked many of the Muslim ships. The survivors sailed back to Egypt.\nThe Crusader navy managed to reach Ascalon unharmed and supply the garrison with men and food. However, the bad weather forced the Crusader navy to set sail for Acre, leaving Ascalon to its fate. The Ayyubids had no siege equipment, but the wreckage of their fleet provided them with wood to construct siege weapons. They built a battering ram and forced its way to the walls. On October 15, they managed to enter the castle using a tunnel. The Crusaders were taken by surprise. The majority of the crusaders were killed, and the rest were taken prisoners.\n\n\n== Aftetmath ==\nAyyub ordered Ascalon to be demolished and left desolate. Ayyub chose not to follow up with his victory. He went to Jerusalem, repaired its walls, and headed to Damascus to spend the winter there.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nSteven Runciman (1954), A History Of The Crusades Vol-III.[2]\nGeorge Hill (2010), A History of Cyprus Vol-II.[3]\nMichael S.

        "content": "Leviathan Patera is a major cryovolcanic caldera on Neptune's largest moon Triton. Approximately 80 kilometers in diameter, Leviathan Patera is located in Monad Regio and within Cipango Planum's western regions. Leviathan Patera may be the center of one of the largest cryovolcanic or volcanic edifices in the Solar System.\n\n\n== Naming ==\nLeviathan Patera, first viewed by the Voyager 2 spacecraft on its flyby of the Neptune system in 1989, is named after the biblical Hebrew sea serpent, the Leviathan. The name was officially approved by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 1991.\n\n\n== Geology ==\nLeviathan Patera is a large, steep-sided depression with a number of arcuate scarps; its general structure strongly resembles that of terrestrial collapse calderas on Earth. The northern half of Leviathan Patera's floor ~450 m deep and largely flat, though an irregular plateau interrupts the flat floor. In contrast, the southern half of Leviathan Patera is occupied by a broad dome ~400 m high, nearly level with the surrounding plains.  Leviathan Patera is surrounded by a region of very smooth terrain. Leviathan Patera sits near two major tectonic features, Kraken Catena and Set Catena, likely indicating that Leviathan Patera's formation and activity is closely linked to rifting at its site.\nLeviathan Patera appears to be the central vent of a massive, geologically young plateau of cryovolcanic material, Cipango Planum. Assuming Cipango Planum is a part of Leviathan Patera's cryovolcanic edifice, Leviathan Patera is the largest known cryovolcano on Triton and one of the largest volcanic features in the Solar System. The eruptive history of Leviathan Patera may have occurred in several stages, first erupting low-viscosity cryolava which resurfaced the surrounding plains (possibly accounting for Cipango Planum's very shallow relief), eventually transitioning to explosive eruptions before finally transitioning to erupting higher-viscosity material constructing domes within the caldera.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGeology of Triton – Geologic structure and composition of Triton\nDoom Mons – Mountain on Titan\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Sessions House, formerly the Shire Hall, is a courthouse in Lynn Road, Ely, Cambridgeshire, England. The building, which is now used as the meeting place of City of Ely Council, is a Grade II* listed building.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe building was commissioned by the justices to replace an earlier sessions house in the Market Place. The site they selected, on the east side of Lynn Road, was owned by the Rev. John Bringhurst and the Dean and Chapter of Ely. The building was designed by Charles Humphrey in the Palladian style, built in buff brick with stone facings at a cost of £6,000 and was opened as the Shire Hall in June 1821.The design involved an asymmetrical main frontage of nine bays facing Lynn Road with the end bays projected forward as pavilions. The central section of four bays formed a full-height tetrastyle portico with four fluted Doric order columns supporting an frieze with triglyphs and a pediment with the Royal coat of arms in the tympanum. At the back of the portico was a central double door. The other bays on the ground floor and all the bays on the first floor were fenestrated by sash windows with architraves. The north end block was fenestrated by a round headed window, while the south end block was fenestrated by two cell-type windows. Both end blocks were faced with corner pilasters and balustraded at roof level. Internally, the principal room was the main courtroom which was at the centre of the building.In 1828, the Shire Hall was the venue for the trial and conviction of the poacher, John Rolfe, who was accused of murdering his poaching companion at Littleport. Rolfe was subsequently executed by hanging. A house of correction with 35 cells was erected behind the building in 1843. At the same time a chapel in the south end block was converted for use by the local police.The building was initially used solely for judicial purposes but in 1850, it also became the meeting place of the local board, which met for the first time under the chairmanship of the dean of Ely Cathedral, George Peacock, on 11 October 1850. In 1894, the local board was succeeded by Ely Urban District Council, which also used the Shire Hall as its meeting place.In the early 20th century, the 6th Cambridgeshire Rifle Volunteer Corps used the north end block as an armoury. After the Second World War, the council converted the old fire station at 6 Lynn Road to become its offices and meeting place, and relocated there.The Shire Hall, which gradually became known as the Sessions House,  remained in judicial use until 2011 when it closed, as part of central government measures to close 93 magistrates' courts across England and Wales. The building was subsequently acquired by City of Ely Council in 2013 to serve as its offices and meeting place. A scene from the comedy film, Harvey Greenfield Is Running Late, starring Annette Badland, was shot in the building in 2022.\n\n\n== See also ==\nListed buildings in Ely, Cambridgeshire\nGrade II* listed buildings in East Cambridgeshire\n\n\n== References ==",

The current building is 18th century, and is depicted on a map of 1791.  It was heightened, probably in the 19th century.  The mill operated until about 1900, after which the ground floor was converted into a cattle shed.  By the 1930s the mill's two ponds had been filled in.  The building was grade II listed in 1966, and in 2010, it was converted for residential use.\nThe two-storey building is constructed of millstone grit, with quoins, and roofs of stone slabs.  The main block has five bays, with a two-bay extension to the northeast, an enclosed wheelhouse, and a later extension to the southeast.  The openings include doorways, windows, one of which has three lights and mullions, cart entries and vents.\n\n\n== See also ==\nListed buildings in Bradley, North Yorkshire\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Thomas Sherley, or Shirley, (1638 – 5 August 1678) was an English physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nSherley was the son of Sir Thomas Sherley of Wiston, Sussex, by his wife Anne, daughter of Sir George Blundell of Cardington, Bedfordshire. He was born in the parish of St. Margaret's, Westminster, and baptised on 15 October 1638. Sir Thomas Shirley, the adventurer, was his grandfather. He lived with his father in Magdalen College while Oxford was garrisoned by the king's troops, and was educated at Magdalen school. He afterwards went to France, studied physic, and obtained the degree of M.D. On his return he acquired a good practice, and was appointed physician in ordinary to Charles II. He was heir to his father's estate at Wiston, worth nearly 3,000l. a year; but it had been granted during the civil war to Sir John Fagg, 1st Baronet, and, although Sherley had recourse to law, the case was decided against him in chancery. He appealed to the House of Lords, but, Sir John Fagge being the member for Steyning in the House of Commons, the house maintained that he was entitled to exemption from lawsuits during session, and Sherley was ordered into the custody of the serjeant-at-arms on 12 May 1675 for bringing an appeal in the lords against a member of the lower house. The matter occasioned a dispute between the two houses, who were already embroiled over the case of Skinner and the East India Company. The difference was only terminated by the king proroguing parliament (Journals of House of Lords, vols. xii., xiii. passim; Journals of House of Commons, ix. 337 &c.). Disappointed by his ill success, Sherley sank into a morbid condition, and died on 5 August 1678. He was buried in the vault of St. Bride's, Fleet Street, London.\nHe was twice married: first to Hannah, daughter of John Harfleet of Fleet in Kent, by whom he had two daughters, Anne and Margaret. He married, secondly, Elizabeth, daughter of Captain Richard Baskett of Apps, Isle of Wight, on 5 June 1667, by whom he had Thomas, Richard, and Elizabeth (Chester, London Marriage Licenses, ed. Foster, p. 1219).\nHe was the author of ‘A Philosophical Essay, declaring the probable cause whence stones are produced in the outer world,’ 1672, 12mo; and of the following translations: \n\nMolimbrochius's ‘Cochlearia Curiosa,’ 1676, 8vo.\n‘A Treatise of the Gout’ by Mayerne Turquet, 1676, 8vo.\n‘Medicinal Councels’ by Mayerne Turquet, 1677, 8vo.\n‘The Curious Distillatory,’ from the Latin of Johann Sigismund Elsholtz, 1677, 8vo.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Carlyle, Edward Irving (1886). \"Sherley, Thomas\".

        "content": "(Hebrew: פלורנטין) is an Israeli television drama series created by Eytan Fox and Gal Uchovsky, which aired on Channel 2 from 1997 to 2000, lasting three seasons. The ensemble cast includes Ayelet Zurer, Karin Ophir, Uri Banai, Sami Huri, Dana Modan, Ami Smolartchik, Nir Friedman and Avshalom Pollak. The show revolves around childhood friends living in Florentin, a neighborhood in the southern part of Tel Aviv.\nThe show was the first in the country to feature gay characters in main roles. It also featured the first-ever same sex kiss on Israeli television, between two male characters. In 2000 it featured the first-ever lesbian kiss on Israeli television between Shira (Zurer) and Nicole (Ronit Elkabetz). \n\n\n== Premise ==\nThe series follows the eventful lives of childhood friends from Jerusalem that relocate to Tel Aviv in their 20s.\n\n\n== Plot summary ==\nThe series mainly follows three characters who live in a shared apartment in Florentine: Tuti (Ofir), an innocent young woman who loves chocolate, Iggy (Banai), a gay man working as a baker, and their new flatmate, Tomer (Pollak), a film student who moved to Tel Aviv from Jerusalem and struggles with his sexual orientation. The series also follows the lives of their neighbors and friends living next door. Most episode focus on the story of one character and his or relationships, professional life and the course of their life, trying to find self-determination, love and happiness. The Florentine neighborhood quickly becomes a symbol of a life of indeterminacy and endless youth, serving as both a point of refuge and a hopeless situation for the complicated characters.\n\n\n== Cast and characters ==\nAyelet Zurer as Shira Steinberg\nKarin Ophir as Tuti, an innocent young woman that lives with Iggy and Tomer\nUri Banai as Iggy, an eccentric gay baker that lives with Tuti and Tomer\nAvshalom Pollak as Tomer, a film student from Jerusalem that moves in with Tuti and Iggy. He is gay and struggles with his sexual orientation.\nSami Huri as Koby\nDana Modan as Gali\nAmi Smolartchik as Hanan\nNir Friedman as Tzemer\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIt is regarded as one of the most pioneering shows in the history of Israeli television and was a ratings success. According to The Advocate, the show \"opened eyes with its groundbreaking gay characters.\" Mako also praised the portrayal of the main gay characters: \"Iggy, the eccentric baker played by Uri Banai and surely the introverted Tomer played by Avshalom Pollak, also provided a different angle to the image of the Israeli gay, more flattering and humane than ever. \"Florentine\" made a real revolution in the representation of gays on the small screen.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nIsraeli television\nCulture of Israel\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nIMDB",

        "content": "The history of Palestinian journalism dates back to the early 20th century. After the lifting of press censorship in the Ottoman Empire in 1908, Arabic-language newspapers in Palestine began to appear, which from its early days, voiced Arab aspirations, opposed Zionism and began to increasingly use \"Palestine\" and \"Palestinians\". This was notably reflected by the establishment of Al-Karmil in 1908 and Falastin in 1911, both published by Arab Christians. However, the emerging press was soon suppressed after the outbreak of World War I in 1914.\nWhen Palestine became a British Mandate in 1920, its press became more diverse, as  over 250 Arabic newspapers and 65 in other languages were circulating in Mandatory Palestine by the mid-1930s. The British began to introduce restrictive measures after 1929, and suspended many major publications during the 1936–1939 Arab revolt. Following the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the British authorities closed almost all the newspapers, with the exception of Falastin and Al-Difa', whose rivalry marked the mandate period.\nThe 1948 Palestine war forced Falastin and Al-Difa to move from Jaffa to East Jerusalem, which became along with Al-Jihad, Jordan's press for many years. Jordan issued a new press law in early 1967 that forced merger of newspapers, leaving only East Jerusalem-based Al-Quds. Israel's occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip following the Six Day War in 1967 brought the Palestinian press under Israeli military censorship, which would continue until the establishment of the Palestinian Authority in 1993. The three main newspapers circulating in the Palestinian territories today include  Al-Quds; and Ramallah-based Al-Hayat Al-Jadida and  Al-Ayyam. \nPalestinian journalists reporting from the occupied territories have witnessed restrictions and risks, especially during the First and Second Intifadas which started in 1987 and 2000 respectively, and the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. The year 2023 saw record numbers of Palestinian journalists arrested and killed by the Israeli military. The rise of the internet in the 1990s gave Palestinians a new platform to share their narrative, such as the creation of Palestine Chronicle and The Electronic Intifada English websites, and Quds News Network and Shehab News Agency. Since then print newspapers have been challenged by the rise of such digital and citizen journalism, which has been faced with a \"systematic censorship\" campaign by some social media sites.\n\n\n== Print journalism ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\n\nThere are several factors behind the late onset of Arab and Palestinian journalism. One of the main obstacles was the Ottoman Empire's banning of the printing press from its invention in the 15th century until the mid-1700s, and the banning of its public use until the mid-1800s. In Palestine, the printing press began to be used by Christian institutions to produce religious texts, first by Jerusalem's Franciscan Church in 1846, and followed afterwards by the Armenian and Greek Churches. The first daily privately-published Arabic-language newspapers in the Ottoman Empire's Arab provinces, which enjoyed varying degrees of autonomy, appeared in Beirut in 1873 and in Cairo in 1875. By the year 1908 Egypt boasted 627 publications with a circulation of around 100,000.\nThe only newspaper published in Palestine was a gazette called Al-Quds Al-Sharif in 1876, written in Arabic and Ottoman Turkish and edited by Sheikh Ali Rimawi and ‘Abd al-Salam Kamal respectively. It closed shortly after and reopened in 1903. Arabic periodicals only appeared in Palestine following the 1908 Young Turk Revolution, which lifted press censorship in the empire. About fifteen publications emerged in that year, and another twenty were published before the onset of World War I in 1914.  Nearly another 180 were published during the British Mandate for Palestine (1920–1948). However, launching newspapers was easier than sustaining them, as most of these periodicals lasted for a short period of time, especially considering the competition with high quality periodicals from Beirut and Cairo, such as the Egyptian Al-Ahram (The Pyramids).\n\n\n=== Ottoman period (1908–1916) ===\nThree of Palestine's leading newspapers of the pre-World War I era were Al-Quds (Jerusalem) established by Jurji Habib Hanania in Jerusalem in September 1908; Al-Karmil (Carmel after Mount Carmel) in Haifa by Najib Nassar in December 1908; and Falastin (Palestine) by the cousins Issa El-Issa and Yousef El-Issa in Jaffa in January 1911. These three newspapers voiced Arab aspirations and were all published by Palestinian Christians, showing the early role they played in Arab nationalism. In particular, Al-Karmil and Falastin were opposed to Zionism. It was in this early period that the terms \"Palestine\" and \"Palestinians\" were being increasingly used by the press. \n\nThese early Arab Palestinian newspapers saw Ottoman Jews as loyal subjects to the empire, but condemned Zionism, and grew fearful of it due to the waves of European Jewish immigrants to Palestine, who built settlements relying on Jewish labor and excluded Arab ones. Thus, Arab editors began a public awareness campaign, warning that once the Zionist project was fulfilled, the Arab majority and their lands in Palestine would be lost. A common theme in the press of this early period is a criticism directed towards the European Jewish immigrants who failed to integrate, or bother learning Arabic. The Arab editors preferred to raise the issue the public's attention rather than the Ottoman authorities, so that the public can be active in preventing land sales to Jews, which caused Arab peasants’ eviction, and their subsequent loss of work.\n\nThe readership of the newspapers in this early period was limited, but it had been expanding. Literacy rates were relatively low; however, social centers where created, such as libraries, the town cafe and the village guesthouse, where men would read aloud articles from newspapers and engage in political discussions. \"Newspaper breaks\" used to take place in some factories. There was also recorded instances of newspapers sending a copy of their newspaper to villages in the surrounding areas, namely Falastin. Articles from Falastin and Al-Karmil were often reprinted in other local papers and national ones in Beirut, Damascus, and Cairo.\n\n\n=== Mandate period (1917–1948) ===\nThe Palestinian press was suppressed due to the outbreak of World War I in 1914, and only two main newspapers from the Ottoman period were reopened during the British Mandate, Al-Karmil and Falastin. During the mandate period, the press became more diverse than in the Ottoman period, and reflected different political factions and national consciousness. According to one survey in the mid-1930s, over 250 Arabic newspapers and 65 in other languages were circulating in Mandatory Palestine. The British had adopted the Ottoman Press Law that had mandated for newspapers the licensing of their franchises and the submission of translations of their work to authorities; however, the British did not interfere in the press until the 1929 Palestine riots between Arabs and Jews. The events of that year led to a radicalization of Arab newspapers, and the British changed their initially tolerant position to a more restrictive approach. \n\nMost of these publications appeared weekly and the number of copies distributed increased gradually. While most newspapers distributed hundreds of copies each during the Ottoman period, this figure increased to 1,000-1,500 during the Mandate period in the 1920s. Falastin, which was the most popular Palestinian newspaper, sold towards the end of the 1920s around 3,000 copies per issue. In Jerusalem, twenty newspapers were established, mainly Mir'at al-Sharq (Mirror of the East) by Boulos Shehadeh, a Palestinian Christian, in September 1919; and Al-Jami'a Al-'Arabiya (The Arab Union), which was the voice of Palestine's Supreme Muslim Council, by Munif Husseini in December 1927. Around six newspapers were established in Jaffa, in addition to Falastin; twelve in Haifa; and some others in Bethlehem, Gaza and Tulkarem.\nFalastin became the first Palestinian newspaper to succeed in establishing itself as a daily in October 1929, a month after it had started publishing a weekly English-language edition. And the establishment of Al-Difa in April 1934 was considered an important event in the history of Palestinian journalism during the mandate period, as it managed to attract professional journalists from several Arab countries. A rivalry developed between these two largest dailies, Falastin and Al-Difa, which saw improvements in their quality. Al-Difa expanded its readership to the rural and Muslim communities, portraying itself a counterweight to the Christian-owned Falastin. While Falastin aimed to show that it served the whole nation by highlighting how uneducated people enjoyed reading their paper, in an implied criticism towards Al-Difa which had come to rely on intellectuals with a complex writing style. Many weeklies found it difficult to compete with these two dailies.\n\nIn the 1930s, two outspoken newspapers were established in Jaffa: Al-Jami'a Al-Islamiya (The Islamic Union) in 1932; and Al-Difa' (The Defense) in 1934, which was associated with Hizb Al-Istiqlal (The Independence Party). Al-Liwaa (The Banner) was published in Jerusalem in 1934 by Jamal al-Husayni, who was the leader of the Palestine Arab Party. Many of the editors and owners of newspapers were similarly members of political organizations, and used their publications for mobilizing the public. \n\nThe British authorities issued a new Publications Law and other regulations in 1933 that gave them the authority to suspend newspapers and punish journalists, which restricted freedom of the press. As a result, the use of colloquial writing style by the press intensified, especially during the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine. Many major publications were suspended for extended periods between 1937 and 1938, including Falastin, Al-Difa, and Al-Liwa. After the outbreak of World War II in 1939, emergency laws were enacted and the British closed almost all the newspapers, except Falastin and Al-Difa, due to the publishing of censored news and the adoption of more moderate positions.\n\n\n=== Jordanian period (1948–1967) ===\nThe 1948 Palestine war forced Falastin and Al-Difa to move from Jaffa to East Jerusalem, which along with the West Bank, was annexed by Jordan in 1950. Another newspaper called Al-Jihad was established in East Jerusalem in 1953. Thus these three East Jerusalem-based newspapers became Jordan's press for many years.\n\nIn the 1950s, a number of newspapers were established as affiliates of political parties that were being created in Jordan, including: Al-Raya (The Banner) affiliated with Hizb ut-Tahrir (Liberation Party) in 1953, which was suspended after 13 issues; and Al-Ba'th (The Renaissance) affiliated with the Jordanian Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party, which lasted from 1949 to 1954. An anti-communist law issued in 1953 banned leftist publications by the Jordanian Communist Party. Furthermore, the prevalent anti-Jordanian propaganda in Egyptian newspaper in the 1950s led to its ban in Jordan.\nThe Jordanian government of Wasfi Tal issued a new Press and Publications Law in early 1967 that forced the merger of Al-Difa and Al-Jihad to produce Jerusalem-based Al-Quds (not to be confused with the newspaper of the same name 1908–1914); and the merger of Falastin and Al-Manar to produce Amman-based Ad-Dustour (The Constitution); both of these newspapers are still published to this day. Ad-Dustour and Al-Difa' newspapers were both briefly suspended during Black September in 1970 after having published a Palestine Liberation Organization statement that cast blame on Jordan's government for the conflict. As a result of the events of Black September and low wages paid to journalists, many professionals of Palestinian origin moved to Arab Gulf states.\n\n\n=== Current period (1967-present) ===\nThe 1967 Six Day War saw Israel occupying the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Under Israeli occupation, Palestinian newspapers fell under Israeli military censorship, and suffered financial hardships. Between 1967 and 1987, 22 newspapers and 20 magazines were published in the territories, which gave priority to issues resulting from the Israeli occupation over cultural, social, and artistic topics. The outbreak of the First Intifada against the occupation in 1987, saw international media interest for extended periods, leading to them hiring aspiring Palestinian journalists. Private Arabic newspapers also began appearing in Nazareth by Palestinian citizens of Israel, including Al-Sinnarah (The Hook) and Kul al-Arab (All the Arabs) and in 1983 and 1987 respectively.\n\nIn the wake of the peace process, namely the 1993 Oslo Accords, the Palestinian National Authority was established that year, bringing an end to Israeli military censorship, when a Palestinian Press Law replaced the Israeli military regulations. Subsequently, many newspapers were established such as the Ramallah-based Al-Hayat Al-Jadida (The New Life) in 1994 and  Al-Ayyam (The Days) in 1995. The new newspapers covered topics to include discussions about women's rights, honor crimes, and criticisms of social customs. The lifting of Israeli military censorship also allowed Palestinians to increasingly demand for their right of return.\nAl-Quds, Al-Hayat Al-Jadida, and Al-Ayyam are the three main newspapers circulating in the Palestinian territories today. While Al-Quds is privately-owned, it is still associated with the Palestinian Authority (PA), and both Al-Ayyam and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida are fully affiliated with the PA. In the Gaza Strip, which is controlled by Hamas, there are two newspapers published there, Felesteen (Palestine) established in 2006 and Al-Resalah (The Letter). Other groups such as the Palestinian Islamic Jihad publishes its own Al-Istiqlal (The Independence), while the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine publishes Al-Masar (The Path).\nAs of 2021, there are more than 50 online and print newspapers circulating in Palestine. Journalism in Palestine today suffers from restrictions imposed by the Palestinian Authority's Cyber Crimes Law enacted in 2017.\n\n\n=== Archives ===\n\nAl-Aqsa Library located in the Old City of East Jerusalem in the Israeli-occupied West Bank has more than seventy Arabic newspapers, magazines, and journals published in Palestine, in addition to ones that were published in other Arab countries and by Arab communities in Europe, and South and North America. The library in some instances holds the only copy available in the region. The National Library of Israel's Jarayed collection of Arabic newspapers in the Ottoman and British periods is available online.\n\n\n=== Historiography ===\nPalestinian-American historian Rashid Khalidi wrote in his book titled The Hundred Years' War on Palestine:\n\nOne crucial window into Palestinians’ perceptions of themselves and their understanding of events between the wars is the Palestinian press. Two newspapers, Issa El-Issa’s Jaffa publication, Falastin, and Al-Karmil, published in Haifa by Najib Nassar, were bastions of local patriotism, and critics of the Zionist-British entente and the danger that it posed to the Arab majority in Palestine. They were among the most influential beacons of the idea of Palestinian identity.\n\n\n== Digital and citizen journalism ==\nPrint newspapers have been challenged by the rise of digital and citizen journalism. The rise of the internet in the 1990s gave Palestinians a new platform to share their narrative digitally, which they thought was being ignored by mainstream media. In 1999, the Palestine Chronicle website was founded by Ramzy Baroud, a Palestinian-American. A year later after the outbreak of the Second Intifada, Ali Abunimah, another Palestinian-American, and others founded the Chicago-based The Electronic Intifada English website, targeting western audiences. While locally, Shehab News Agency was established in 2007 and Quds News Network in 2013, providing Arabic, and sometimes English, content for young and global audiences on social media, drawing millions of followers. \nPalestinian young citizens have been filming, creating and distributing videos showing Israeli settler violence, Israeli military violations, and the realities of living under Israeli occupation. Human Rights Watch has documented a \"systematic censorship\" campaign by social media companies like Meta Platforms, which owns Facebook and Instagram, which has targeted accounts of Palestinian activists, including journalists, through bans and limiting their content's reach.\nThe ongoing Israel-Hamas war, which started on 7 October 2023, saw a steep increase in the social media following of Palestinian journalists based in the Gaza Strip, including Motaz Azaiza and Plestia Alaqad, whose accounts, particularly on Instagram, have swelled to millions of followers due to their documentation of the war as very few foreign journalists were allowed into the strip.\n\n\n== Broadcast journalism ==\n\nThe British authorities established the region's first radio station named Palestine Broadcasting Service (PBS) in 1936 to compete with the politicized print journalism. PBS' studios were located in Jerusalem, while the tower and transmitter were located in Ramallah. It aired broadcasts in Arabic, English and Hebrew. The studios in Jerusalem were taken over by Zionist militias during the 1948 Palestine war, while the tower and transmitter in Ramallah were taken over by Jordan, which added a studio and launched the Hashemite Broadcasting Service (HBS) until 1967.\nAfter Israel occupied the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in 1967, it banned broadcasting in the occupied territories, which remained without a national television or radio station until the 1990s. The signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993 allowed for the first time the then newly established Palestinian Authority to access ten FM frequencies, and led to the establishment of Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation (PBC) that year, including PBC's Voice of Palestine radio station. Hamas' victory in the 2006 Palestinian legislative election led to the establishment of Al Aqsa TV and its radio station Sawt Al-Aqsa.\n\n\n== Safety of journalists ==\n\nThe period of the Second Intifada between 2000 and 2005 put Palestinian journalists and camera operators at heightened risks, including military closures, confiscation of equipment, prevention from reporting on certain incidents and locations, curfews, and arrests. The Committee to Protect Journalists documented that nine Palestinian journalists were killed by the Israeli military between 2000 and 2009, some of them were described as targeted attacks, which Israel denies. The killing of Palestinian-American journalist and Al Jazeera reporter by the Israeli military, Shireen Abu Akleh, in 2022 gained widespread coverage globally; she is widely considered an icon of Palestinian journalism.\n2023 saw record numbers of arrests of Palestinian journalists by the Israeli military in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where journalists face risk of assault by the Israeli and Palestinian law enforcements and from attacks by Israeli settlers. The Gaza Strip meanwhile, which has been under Israeli blockade since 2007, is considered to be one of the \"most perilous places\" to be a journalist, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war, which broke out on 7 October 2023, many dozens of Palestinian journalists have been killed by Israel; 70% of journalists killed worldwide in 2023 have been Palestinian. Many of the deaths have been caused by Israeli airstrikes.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistory of Middle Eastern newspaper publishing\nList of journalists killed during the Israeli-Palestinian conflict\nList of journalists killed in the Israel–Hamas war\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBritish Library's Endangered Archives Programme containing many Palestinian newspapers\nNational Library of Israel's Jrayed collection of Palestinian newspapers",

        "content": "An ordinary bubble can serve as an optofluidic laser. These bubble lasers have been made of dye-doped soap solutions and smectic liquid crystal. In a bubble laser, the bubble itself serves as the optical resonator. Uniquely, bubble lasers exhibit hundreds of regularly spaced resonant frequencies called whispering gallery modes, named for the Whispering Gallery in St. Paul's Cathedral in London. Researchers have found that the emission spectrum of a bubble laser is highly dependent on the bubble's environment; changing ambient air pressure or electric fields changes the size of the bubble (the optical resonator), and therefore the wavelengths of laser emission.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nBubble lasers have been made from soap solutions to which a few drops of fluorescent laser dye have been added. The fluorescent dye acts as the gain medium. When a pump laser is shone onto the bubble, the dye molecules are excited. The excited dye molecules emit photons. The light propagates along the surface of the soap bubble, leading to wave interference that generates distinct, evenly-spaced optical resonances of the bubble (called whispering gallery modes). When photons, by chance, of the right frequencies are emitted into the whispering gallery modes, it stimulates other molecules to emit more matching photons, amplifying the light.\nA soap bubble's thickness is constantly changing due to freely flowing water inside the bubble. This results in an unstable lasing spectrum. More stable results were achieved when the bubbles were made of smectic liquid crystal, which is made entirely of organic liquid-crystal molecules. These bubbles do not contain water, can be very thin, and can survive almost indefinitely.\n\n\n== Applications ==\nThe spacing of whispering gallery modes is directly related to the bubble's circumference. This means that bubble lasers may be used as pressure sensors. Bubble lasers have measured pressure changes as high as 100 bar (10,000 kPA) and as low as 1.5 Pa, an \"exceptionally large\" dynamic range, far outperforming other pressure sensors of comparable size.\nIn the future, bubble lasers may be used to study thin films and phenomena such as Cavity optomechanics.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of laser articles\nSonoluminescence, emission of light from imploding bubbles\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Prospero Provana of his own coat of arms (born around 1520, died on 20 September 1584 in Kraków) was an Italian nobleman from Piedmont, a merchant, and banker in Kraków. He served as the first postmaster of the royal post in Poland (1558–1562), royal secretary to Sigismund Augustus (1570), non-castle starosta of Będzin, and żupnik in Kraków (1577–1580).\nHe arrived in Poland either with his brother Traiano or later, at his brother's urging. He engaged in trade of fabrics, wine, and salt, and obtained Polish indygenat. Sigismund Augustus entrusted him with the organization and management of the royal post, as well as, for a certain time, intermediation in the transfer of interest on Neapolitan sums. By the grant of Stephen Báthory, he administered Żupy krakowskie, amassed considerable landed wealth, and owned several tenements in Kraków, leading the local Italian colony. Associated with supporters of the Reformation (possibly leaving Piedmont for religious reasons), he was a Calvinist and maintained close contacts with antitrinitarians, hosting Fausto Sozzini, among others. However, towards the end of his life, he converted to Catholicism.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\n\n=== Origins and arrival in Poland ===\nHe came from a noble family from Piedmont, and he was the son of Guglielmo Provana or Nicola Provana del Sabbione. He was born perhaps in Collegno, probably in the early 1520s. The exact date is not known. Carignano or Caragnano is also mentioned as another possible place of origin for his family.\nHe probably came to Poland together with his older brother Traiano or later, at his urging, in the early 1550s, when persecution of supporters of the Reformation was taking place in Piedmont, ordered by Duke Emmanuel Philibert. A fragment from the travel diary of the nuncio Ippolito Aldobrandini, who visited one of the Provana estates, points to such a background and time of arrival. Presumably, he initially remained in the service of Queen Bona. He quickly acclimated, and substantial financial resources facilitated the development of his interests, mainly in the trade of fabrics and wine, as well as banking. In 1557, together with his brother, he received Polish indygenat, which may indicate his rapid adaptation in the new country. He was probably inclined to stay in Poland for a long time.\n\n\n=== Postmaster of the royal post ===\nWith his intelligence and entrepreneurial spirit, he attracted the attention of King Sigismund Augustus, and, like his brother, was associated with the royal chancellery (Prospero was mentioned as a royal secretary in the Royal Metrica, in a document dated 4 September 1570). The monarch, while striving to secure his inheritance from his mother, needed regular contact with Italy. Therefore, it was necessary to organize a regular postal connection between Kraków and Venice, and the monarch appointed Provana as its postmaster, according to the privilege Ordinatio postae Cracovia Venetias praeficitur from 18 October 1558. The post was to run using relay horses. The document provided that all costs (equipment, personnel, postal facilities, and stations along the route) were to be borne by the king, and the revenues from fees for private shipments were to be returned to the royal treasury. Additionally, Provana was obliged to submit accounts for expenses incurred in running the postal service. However, the privilege did not specify his remuneration. Most likely, a separate instruction from the monarch addressed this issue, whereby Prospero received an annual salary of 300 Polish złotys. Couriers departed from one of his Kraków tenements (on Floriańska Street or in the Main Square). According to Jan Ptaśnik, the brief content of the privilege and the small amount of detailed information resulted from a lack of a clear concept of postal operations.\nProvana managed the postal service for four years, until 1562. There are no details available about his activities in this role, and the lack of postal revenues may indicate that he did not fare well. The ultimate reason for revoking the privilege granted to Provana is said to have been his conflict with the Thurn-Taxis family, which controlled postal connections in Austria, Hungary, and Italy. However, in 1564, this did not prevent him from most likely instructing a well-known Kraków merchant, Pietro Maffon from Brescia (died 1575), as the new postmaster, who obtained a privilege entrusting him with this task for 5 years, with an annual salary of 1500 thalers. Correspondence was to be transported on the Vilnius–Kraków–Venice route. Most likely, Maffon did not manage to organize the efficient functioning of the enterprise, and at the request of the monarch, even before the contract expired, he transferred the tasks to Sebastiano Montelupi (the latter received a privilege for this activity in November 1568).\n\n\n=== Merchant activities ===\nAnother task entrusted to him by Sigismund Augustus was also related to Italian affairs. According to a document from 23 November 1569, Provana, with the assistance of Venetian Antonio de Angelis and other Italian bankers and royal agents in Naples, was to mediate in the collection and transfer of interest from Neapolitan sums. The wide commercial contacts and constant relations with Italian banks were likely factors that influenced the assignment of these duties to him. It is not known how long he engaged in this activity or whether he received additional compensation for it, apart from an annual pension of 200 scudi from Neapolitan sums, granted on 22 August 1570. In the 1560s, he became involved in efforts to obtain weapons in Venice for the army of John Zápolya, the ruler of the Principality of Transylvania, during his conflict with Emperor Maximilian II.\nProvana developed intense commercial activity in the trade of wine and fabrics, involving his brother as well. He often conducted business with the Venetian merchant Jakob Gastgebem, as well as with Italians settled in Kraków, with whom he also had disputes (for example, in 1574 with Lodovikio de Pello and Alessandro Baldi).\n\n\n=== Salt business and Żupy krakowskie ===\nHe also became involved in the salt trade, which eventually dominated his commercial activities. Already during the reign of Sigismund Augustus, he co-organized a salt-making company, which received a privilege from the king (subsequently confirmed by Henryk III). It was one of the first companies of this kind in Poland, but it is not known whether it actually started its operations or whether the Italian withdrew from it.\nOn a larger scale, he began to engage in salt mining and trading during the reign of Stephen Báthory, who was favorably disposed towards him, also thanks to the patronage of his friends – Stanisław Cikowski and Giorgio Biandrata. In such a favorable situation, he was granted a lease of the Żupy krakowskie for a period of 3 years on 2 March 1577, with the obligation to pay an annual sum of 56,000 Polish złotys (and settle the debts for salt supplies left by his predecessor, Hieronim Bużeński). Holding the office of żupnik brought him substantial income, with his profit reportedly reaching 24,000 złotys in the first year alone. He also attempted to modernize the mines by announcing that he would give half of the income to anyone who introduced improvements in salt extraction. An Italian, Rocco Marconi, responded to this offer by inventing a device that facilitated the extraction of salt blocks. Żupnik obtained the monarch's approval for this project, but it is not known whether it was eventually implemented.\nOn 20 August 1578, the king concluded a new agreement with Provana, hoping for greater revenue. According to this agreement, żupnik was to receive 2000 złotys annually and be allowed to participate in profits if he paid an additional 80,000 złotys into the royal treasury, after deducting the costs of his salary and repairs. To encourage him to fulfill his duties conscientiously, it was stipulated that in the first year, his profit could amount to half of the additional income, and in subsequent years, one-tenth of the amount. However, the royal expectations remained unfulfilled, as the revenues from the mines (for the period from 18 September 1578 to 18 March 1580) only reached half of the expected amount. In March 1580, Provana resigned from the administration of the salt mines. The reasons for his departure, halfway through the three-year lease, remain unknown.\nAssessments of Provana's tenure as żupnik remain divergent. His critics accused him of running the saltworks in a predatory manner, which may be confirmed by the review of their condition at the end of 1580, indicating a dire situation. Adolf Pawiński, in his work Skarbowość w Polsce i jej dzieje za Stefana Batorego, states that the Italian's mismanagement led to a striking decline in salt mine revenues. The most significant drop in profits allegedly occurred after the change in management format in 1578, which the king agreed to, encouraged by the previous good balance. Jan Ptaśnik, however, viewed the situation differently. According to him, Provana took over the mines after a weak, less energetic predecessor, showing energy in their modernization efforts, and the recorded decline in income during his tenure still exceeded the revenues from Bużeński's tenure. Upon his resignation, Provana also received thanks from the king and a certificate of good performance of his duties. Jerzy Wyrozumski also portrayed his activities positively, highlighting his evident entrepreneurship and efficiency, as well as his steps to combat illegal saltworks, which undermined the mine's income. Similarly, the Italian historian Lucio Biasiori attributed to him transparent management and the demonstration of the qualities of an excellent administrator.\nDuring his tenure as żupnik, Provana also engaged in private initiatives related to salt extraction, in which his position assisted him. Most likely, under the first contract, he obtained the rights to develop such activities, as evidenced by the nearly twofold increase in salt mine revenues during the first year. It is known that he was very active in the intense movement of establishing new saltworks, located far from the Kraków salt mines at the time. On 11 April 1577, his company, with the participation of Cikowski and Florian Morsztyn, the Bergmeister of Wieliczka, obtained a privilege to build a new shaft in Wieliczka for the extraction of rock salt. It was completed at great cost and opened on September 9 of the same year. It is not known whether the Italian established a saltworks for which this shaft would serve as the raw material base. Perhaps both he and his partners were satisfied with the opportunity to trade in various types of salt, which were extracted together with rock salt, as envisaged by the royal privilege as compensation for the costs incurred.\nIn addition, he established saltworks in Stężyca Nadwieprzańska, in Będzin (together with the elder of the Kraków Jewish community, Joachim Ezdrasz), and in Bydgoszcz (with Jakub Rokossowski and Szymon Ługowski, the prelate of Miechów). The first of these was established in late summer 1577, the second in September of the same year, and the third as part of a partnership in mid-September 1579. Also, in connection with these ventures, Provana acted against illegal saltworks.\nParticularly significant for him was the saltworks in Będzin, located on an important salt trade route connecting the salt mines with Silesia, facilitating both sales and the transport of raw materials. This enterprise had the characteristics of a private interest, with Provana not presenting any accounts of it to the state treasury. Although it was to remain in his hands only while he was żupnik, there was no provision for its takeover by the state or his successor in office. The supplied raw material remained exempt from any duties, with Provana paying only a calculated price on-site in the salt mine. This may have been due to the fact that at that time, principles for the state's share in the pure profits of saltworks had not yet been developed (which occurred in 1580 when its amount was set at one-quarter).\nThe Będzin enterprise presumably operated well, and after resigning from the position of żupnik, the Italian continued to run it, perhaps until a certain specified time. He accumulated significant amounts of rock salt there, presumably in accordance with an unrecorded agreement, under which he was specifically given time to export the raw material. He sold (or subleased) the saltworks, along with the Będzin starostwo, to Gian Battista Cettis, a relative and friend. The further functioning of the enterprise, which also attracted many merchants from Silesia, now undermined the interests of Żupy krakowskie and provoked a reaction from żupnik Sebastian Lubomirski. As a result of his intervention, on 12 March 1581, the royal chancellery issued letters to Provana and Cettis, aimed at terminating its activities. However, the profitable saltworks, which also absorbed significant investments, was eventually relocated to the not-too-distant Ujejsce in the Duchy of Siewierz, which enjoyed autonomy from the rest of the state, so the authority and influence of żupnik did not extend there. This happened thanks to Provana, either in 1581 or in the 1590s, already after his death.\nAs for the other saltworks, he owned the one established in Stężyca until 22 October 1580. The Bydgoszcz enterprise ceased its operations in the same year, although the partnership agreement that established it was to remain in force for four years. This was due to Rokossowski's death, one of the partners, and Provana's resignation from the position of żupnik, which hindered the development of the saltworks, to which rock salt was to flow from Żupy krakowskie. Perhaps the Italian withdrew from this partnership at that time. Ultimately, the saltworks was purchased by Stanisław Lubomirski and Stefan Grudziński, the castellan of Nakło.\n\n\n=== Assets and social standing ===\n\nHis activities across various fields, despite numerous difficulties, brought him significant financial benefits. Provana amassed a considerable landed estate in Lesser Poland, mainly through investing funds from trade and providing loans to the gentry against the pledge of villages, from which he derived income or took ownership. One of his largest debtors was Stanisław Szafraniec of Pieskowa Skała – shortly after 1560, he pledged the village of Rogów to Provana, but over the following years, the debt grew. Therefore, in 1582, Provana received from him the assignment of Rogów and (located nearby) Wyszogród, Kobylanki, Chrostowicza, and Wola. Among other borrowers from the 1570s are: King Henryk III (over 6000 Polih złotys), Castellan of Podlaskie Maciej Sowicki (a sum of 5000 Polih złotys), Castellan of Sączów Jan Cikowski (3000 Polih złotys), starosta of Sandomierz Andrzej Firlej (5000 Polih złotys). Additionally, he obtained the villages of Kokoszewo in the Kraków region (from Hieronim and Andrzej Morski), Nadzów (from Joachim Glinicz), Budziejowice and Piotrkowice (from Mikołaj Dłuski for 17,000 Polih złotys), and in 1579, he acquired Pamięcice, Pałecznica, and the empty village of Biedzina from Abraham and Jan Lasocki.\nHe also leased the non-urban starostwo of Będzin from 11 March 1570, when the sons and nephews of the Kraków Castellan Marcin Zborowski assigned this estate to him. He sold or subleased it to Cettis at the end of 1579 or the beginning of 1580. Already in the following year, he regained the starostwo, which Cettis reassigned on 6 March 1581, and remained in the hands of Prospero Provana until his death. According to the tax register from 1581, Provana owned six villages in the Proszowice County, and eight years later, his heirs divided among themselves the villages of Bolów, Ilkowice, Sudołek, Budziejowice, Lasów (Łaszów), Nadzów, Piotrkowice, Rogów, and a part of Pamięcice.\nIn Kraków, he used or owned several tenements, often as collateral – one on Wiślna Street (1565), three on the Main Square (1562–1568), one on Sławkowska Street (1571), two on the Main Square (acquired from Mikołaj Tarnowski and Jan Myśliszewski), one on Szewska Street (acquired from Kacper Maciejowski in 1578), and one on Floriańska Street.\nProvana served as the patron and leader of the Italian community in Kraków, mediating disputes, overseeing the execution of wills, and caring for orphans and their estates. In comparison to his brother, he appeared to display greater dynamism in business and consistency in taking on new challenges. His extensive banking activities contributed to strengthening his position and gaining influence beyond the Italian community. The purchases of tenements, and especially landed estates, indicate his good understanding of the local value system and a willingness to fully assimilate.\n\n\n=== Religious affairs ===\nHe converted to Calvinism, probably in the early 1550s, although his departure from Piedmont was likely connected to the Reformation. In 1558, he participated in the Calvinist synod in Książ Wielki, where he, along with his brother, requested a private minister. He also took part in the synod of Pińczów on 7 August 1559. From 1560 onwards, he maintained close contact with Stanisław Budziński, the first historian of the Reformation movement in Poland, who lived in his house for a while. Being friends with Blandrata, Provana became a guardian of antitrinitarian supporters, hosting them in Krakow or Rogów – Gian Paolo Alciati (1561), Giovanni Valentin Gentile (1561?), and Bernardino Ochino (1564; a year later he executed his will). He also served as an intermediary between Blandrata, after his departure to the Principality of Transylvania, and the Lesser Poland antitrinitarian community. In the 1570s and 1580s, his guests also included Andrzej Dudycz, Niccolò Buccella, Gianmichele Bruto, Fausto Sozzini, Giovanni Bernardino Bonifacio, and Francesco Pucci. However, it is difficult to determine whether he fully shared their religious views. In 1580, a famous religious dispute between antitrinitarians, Calvinists, and Catholics, with the participation of Piotr Skarga, was to take place in his house.\nHe also played a certain role as a patron of humanistic works. Antonio Maria Nigrisoli dedicated to him the second edition of his translation of Georgics, published in Venice in 1552. Prospero also influenced the creation of Polonicae grammatices institutio by Pierre Statorius (1568), considered the first grammar of the Polish language. In the dedication addressed to Dudycz, the author wrote: I have made every effort (...) and, at the urging of friends, especially Prospero Provana, the most illustrious man who has deserved much from me (...). \nStanisław Hosius observed with concern Provana's affiliation with the camp of non-conformists, suspecting him of intercepting his correspondence. However, over time, the Italian began to show a tendency to renounce his support for the Reformation and his previous religious views, perhaps due to fatigue and concern over constant religious disputes and chaos among the Protestants, as well as pressure from Catholics, mainly Jesuits. In 1581, the papal nuncio Giovanni Andrea Caligari made efforts to obtain the right to grant him absolution, but Provana hesitated, reportedly under the influence of his wife, a zealous Calvinist. According to the account of the nuncio Alberto Bolognetti from 1583, frequent meetings on theological and other issues were held in his house, and he was also respected among the \"Italian heretics\", who often visited him, maintaining correspondence with him as well. However, he intended to send his sons to study in Italy to be raised as Catholics. Eventually, he converted, which was confirmed in June 1584 by Antonio Possevino, reporting to Rome that Provana's withdrawal from his previous beliefs and his profession of the Catholic faith occurred in the presence of another Jesuit, Stanisław Warszewicki.\n\n\n=== Death and burial ===\n\nIn his later years, Provana contemplated the idea of going to Italy and settling in Venice. From 1583 onwards, he suffered from persistent health problems. He passed away on 20 September 1584. He was laid to rest in the chapel of St. Joseph in the Dominican church in Kraków. The executors of his will – the Kraków żupnik Mikołaj Koryciński and his relative Gian Battista Cettis – erected a grand, mannerist tomb for him, made of sandstone and marble, with a sculpture of the deceased depicted in a Sansovinian pose.\n\n\n=== Marriage and offspring ===\nHe married Elżbieta, the daughter of Jan Irzykowicz, the owner of Baciki and the starosta of Mielnik, with whom he had four children:\n\nOktawian (died 1591), starosta of Będzin;\nSamuel (died 1591);\nBarbara, who married Samuel Andrzej Dembiński, the castellan of Biecz, in December 1590. From their marriage, she had seven daughters. She and her husband leased the starostwo of Będzin from 1584 to 1591, after the death of her brother and parents. On 14 May 1593, she received confirmation of lifelong possession of the estate for herself and Samuel. She also inherited a tenement on Floriańska Street. She passed away in 1621;\nBona.\n\n\n== Commemoration in 2008 ==\nIn 2008, the 450th anniversary of the Polish Post was celebrated. On this occasion, a special miniature sheet of three stamps, designed by Maciej Jędrysik, was issued. It featured historical panoramas of Kraków and Venice from the modern era, as well as portraits of King Sigismund Augustus, Prospero Provana, and Sebastian Montelupi. A reproduction of Provana's privilege was also included on the stamp with the monarch's likeness, as well as on the first day of issue envelope. The commemorative stamps, each with a face value of 1.45 PLN and a circulation of 500,000 pieces, were put into circulation on 15 September 2008.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nAdamczewski, Jan (2003).

        "content": "Thomas Barrett-Lennard, 17th Baron Dacre (20 April 1717 – 12 January 1786) was an English aristocrat.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nThomas Barrett was born on 20 April 1717. He was the son of Richard Barrett and Anne Lennard, later 16th Baroness Dacre. After his father's death in 1716, his mother married Henry Roper, 8th Baron Teynham, in c. March 1717. After Lord Teynham's death from a self inflicted gunshot in 1723, she married Irish MP, the Hon. Robert Moore (younger son of the 3rd Earl of Drogheda), in 1725.\nHis paternal grandparents were Dacre Barrett and the former Lady Jane Chichester (eldest daughter of the 2nd Earl of Donegall). His maternal grandparents were Thomas Lennard, 1st Earl of Sussex and Lady Anne Fitzroy (the illegitimate daughter of King Charles II and Barbara Villiers, Duchess of Cleveland).\nHe was educated at Harrow School.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\nBarrett-Lennard succeeded as the 17th Baron Dacre upon the death of his mother on 26 June 1755. His mother had become suo jure Baroness Dacre in 1741 after the death of her elder sister, Lady Barbara Skelton (née Lennard), when the abeyance of her father's barony was terminated in her favor. Their father's earldom, however, had become extinct upon his death in 1715.\nAfter their daughter died in 1749, Thomas and Anna went on the \"Grand Tour as a distraction during their recovery. After visiting Naples, Florence, Venice and other Italian cities, the couple arrived in Rome around 1750, where they met painter Pompeo Batoni.\" In 1745, his wife had her portrait painted the prominent English portrait-painter Isaac Whood.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nOn 15 May 1739, Thomas married Anna Maria Pratt in London. Anna was the daughter of Elizabeth Wilson and Sir John Pratt, an MP for Midhurst who served as Lord Chief Justice of England between 1712 and 1725. Her elder brother was Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden. Together, they were the parents of: \n\nHon. Anne Barbara Barrett-Lennard (1740–1749), who \"died of a sudden fever when she was only nine years old.\"\nWith Elizabeth FitzThomas, Lord Dacre had two illegitimate children, who were brought up by Lord and Lady Dacre as if they were their own. Of the two children, the son, Thomas Barrett-Lennard (1762–1857), became an MP for Essex South and was created a baronet of Belhus in 1801.\nLord Dacre died on 12 January 1786 in London without legitimate male issue. The barony passed to his nephew, Trevor Charles Roper (1745–1794), the son of his younger half-brother. His widow died on 11 August 1806.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThomas Barrett-Lennard (1717–1786), Later 17th Lord Dacre, with his Wife, Anna Maria Pratt (d.1806), and their Daughter, Barbara Anne at ArtUK",

        "content": "In the year 1220, the Ayyubid fleet launched a sea raid against the port of Limassol in Cyprus. The raid ended in success for the Ayyubid fleet.\nAfter the capture of Damietta by the Crusaders in 1219, the Ayyubid sultan, Al-Kamil, soon recovered from this setback. He managed to put the war on hold for months. Using this, he began repairing his navy at the city of Rosetta. The Crusaders controlled the eastern branch of the Nile, while the western branch remained unguarded, which allowed the navy to outflank the Crusaders from behind.\nOn summer 1220, the Ayyubid navy launched a sea raid against the port of Limassol, which was under the Crusader kingdom of Cyprus, as it was advantageous to the Crusaders. The supply line between Limassol and Damietta were poorly guarded. At Limassol, the Crusader navy was supplying in the port before heading to join the Crusaders in Egypt. The Ayyubid fleet consisted of 20 Galleys. Sailing among the Christian ships, they managed to achieve a surprise attack. The Crusader navy was unprepared for any defense.\nThe Ayyubids managed to burn and capture all the Crusader fleet, killing and enslaving over 13,000 Crusaders, although this number is indeed exaggeration. When news of the raid reached, the Crusader blamed Pelagio Galvani and Pelagius was dismayed upon learning this. He had already been informed of this raid before; however, he neglected these reports as insignificant. Pelagius soon dispatched a Venetian navy to intercept the Ayyubids, but it was too late as the Ayyubid fleet reached safety with their loot.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nGil Fishhof, Judith Bronstein, & Vardit R.

        "content": "The Tearsmith (Italian: Fabbricante di lacrime) is a 2024 Italian teen romance film directed by Alessandro Genovesi, based on the novel of the same name by Erin Doom. It was released on Netflix on 4 April 2024.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nA young girl, Nica, is left orphaned after her parents die in a car accident. She is taken to the oppressive Sunnycreek Orphanage, where she befriends a girl named Adeline. Years later, Nica, now a teenager, is adopted by Anna and Norman Milligan. The couple also adopts Rigel, a moody teenager who is the pride and joy of the headmistress, Margaret. At their new home, Rigel is hostile toward Nica. Flashbacks reveal that at Sunnycreek, all of the children except Rigel were physically and emotionally abused by Margaret.\nOn their first day of school, Rigel gets into a fight with another student. The students participate in Garden Day, whereby each student gives a rose anonymously to another student. Nica receives a black rose, signifying a tormented and obsessive love. Rigel denies being the one to give it to her. A student named Lionel asks Nica out on a date; Rigel later gets into a fistfight with him. Nica admonishes Rigel for his behavior and he has a seizure, leaving her to care for him. The two share a romantic moment. Flashbacks reveal that on one occasion that Nica was about to be punished by Margaret, Rigel cut his own hand to disrupt her.\nAdeline visits the Milligan home and tells Nica that she wants to press charges against Margaret, and needs Nica's testimony. Nica declines, unable to face her own past. That night, Nica and Rigel are about to kiss when Lionel interrupts. He suspects the two have feelings for one another, and tells her that people would not approve of their relationship. Rigel tells her that he is too broken for her and she deserves a normal boyfriend. He also tells Anna that he is rejecting their adoption and leaves the house. \nDuring the school dance, Lionel attempts to sexually assault Nica in a classroom; Rigel intervenes. Nica and Rigel kiss and have sex in the classroom. After leaving, a furious Lionel tries to run them over with his car. They escape by jumping off a bridge into a river. Nica wakes up in the hospital; Rigel's body broke her fall and he is in a coma, further complicated by the brain neuromas he suffers from. He is now under custody of Margaret, having rejected the Milligans' adoption. Margaret blames Nica for his coma and says that she will keep her away from him forever. Nica, now defiant, agrees to testify against Margaret. \nAfterward, Nica tells Rigel in the hospital that they won the case and Margaret will never be able to hurt them again. Rigel finally wakes up from the coma. In the future, Nica and Rigel are happily married and have a daughter.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nSimone Baldasseroni as Rigel Wilde\nCaterina Ferioli as Nica Dover\nSabrina Paravicini as Margaret Stoker, the headmistress of Sunnycreek Orphanage\nAlessandro Bedetti as Lionel, Nica's admirer\nRoberta Rovelli as Anna Milligan, Rigel and Nica's adoptive mother\nOrlando Cinque as Norman Milligan, Rigel and Nica's adoptive father\nEco Andriolo as Adeline, Nica's childhood friend\nNicky Passarella as Billie, Nica's friend\nSveva Romana Candelletta as Miki, Nica's friend\nJuju Di Domenico as Asia\nStefano Massari as Peter Corrin\nLaura Baldi as Dalma\nEugenio Krauss as Dalma's husband\nAntonio Ghisleri as Phelps\nAron Tewelde as Mr. Kirill\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe Tearsmith was published by Magazzini Salani in 2021 and became the best-selling novel of 2022 in Italy. Following its success, Colorado Film acquired the rights to a film adaptation in mid-2022. Filming took place in Rome, Pescara, and Ravenna from February to June 2023.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nSongs featured in the film include \"Budapest\" by George Ezra, \"Vampire\" by Olivia Rodrigo, and \"I Love You\" by Billie Eilish.\n\n\n== Release ==\nNetflix acquired distribution rights to the film in September 2023. A teaser trailer for the film was released on 20 February 2024, and the official trailer was released on 14 March 2024.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nAurora Amidon of Paste called the film \"predictable\", but \"entertaining in its own wild and unexpected ways\". She praised the performances of Ferioli and Baldasseroni as well as the film's production design. Johnny Loftus of Decider wrote, \"Chemistry-wise, Caterina Ferioli and Simone Baldasseroni have their moments, as far as frustrated lovers trying to find their purpose together certainly can. It is quite possible to root for them. But the setting as it's portrayed in the film took us way, way out of the immediate story, and especially impedes the romance.\"\nLivia Paccarié of The Hollywood Reporter Roma called the film \"a confusing mix of clichés halfway between Oliver Twist and Twilight\". Marianna Ciarlante of Today echoed these sentiments, calling the film a \"disappointment\" and \"a strange mix of clichés, toxic love, and platitudes\". Lorenza Negri of Wired Italia called the film \"objectively bad\" and \"mostly ridiculous\", but commended the subject material's message of kindness \"towards the anesthetized, insensitive and disinterested generations who fall within the target of [Doom's] work.\" Simona Tavola of Cinefilos.it rated the film two-and-a-half out of five stars, calling it a film \"designed only for Gen Z audiences\", but \"an above-average package [...] of the young adult genre\".\nOn 7 April 2024, after three days of its release, the film ranked first on the Neflix global charts.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Tearsmith on Netflix\nThe Tearsmith on IMDb",

He was the eldest son of Peter Roe, a banker, and a cousin of George Roe, a distiller in Dublin. He began his medical studies somewhat late in life, after his marriage in 1817, and was admitted to the degree of M.D. in Edinburgh on 1 August 1821, his inaugural thesis being ‘De respiratione.’ He then proceeded to Paris, returning later to London, where he was admitted a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians on 25 June 1823. He was still pursuing his studies at Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated as B.A., M.A., M.B., and M.D., the last degree being conferred upon him in 1827. He was incorporated upon this degree at Oxford in 1828, being at that time a member of Magdalen Hall, afterwards Hertford College. He was admitted a candidate of the Royal College of Physicians of London on 13 April 1835, and a fellow on 25 June 1836.\nHe was appointed a physician to the Westminster Hospital in 1825, and, after serving for some time as a lecturer on medicine, he resigned in 1854. He was also a physician to the Hospital for Consumption and Diseases of the Chest, Brompton, to which he attached himself upon its foundation in 1841. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society in 1835, and served upon its council during 1841–2. He was Harveian orator at the Royal College of Physicians in 1856, and consiliarius in 1864, 1865, and 1866. He died on 13 April 1873, and was buried in the Brompton cemetery. His son, William Gason Roe, was a medical practitioner at Westminster.\nDr. Roe was an intelligent, well-informed, and practical physician. His decided manner won for him the confidence of his patients, but his private practice was small. He early gained the disapprobation of the members of his own profession by the promiscuous manner in which he gave advice gratuitously to those who could well afford to pay for it. He belonged to the Christian apostolic church.\nHe was the author of ‘A Treatise on the Hooping Cough and its complications, with Hints on the Management of Children,’ 8vo, London, 1836. The publication of this book gave rise to a fierce controversy between himself and Dr. Augustus Bozzi Granville, who charged him with gross plagiarism.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Power, D'Arcy (1897). \"Roe, George Hamilton\".

It is a biography about the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIn the Journal of the History of Philosophy, James Snow and Dale E. Snow wrote that Safranski manages to portray Schopenhauer's brusque and hostile character, as well as the suffering and insecurities his behaviour concealed. The critics wrote that the book is at its best when it describes scenes from Schopenhauer's life, but is too sweeping when it portrays his intellectual milieu, and commits outright errors by omitting subjects such as the pantheism controversy and the impacts of Baruch Spinoza, Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi and Gottlob Ernst Schulze. Snow and Snow compared the book unfavourably to Arthur Hübscher's Schopenhauer biography Thinker Against the Tide.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHanser",

        "content": "The Children of Edward is an oil on canvas painting by French painter Paul Delaroche, created in 1830. It is held in the Louvre, in Paris.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1827, Delaroche traveled to London, where he visited the Tower of London. He was very interested about the story of the Princes in the Tower, and decided to create an historical painting inspired by the subject. He did a detailed research on the decorations and objects of the 15th century for the current painting. The canvas was first shown at the Salon of 1831. At the time, it was defined as a very moving painting, a \"tearjerker\", similarly to another later painting by the same painter, The Execution of Lady Jane Grey (1833).\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe painting focuses on the theme of the Princes in the Tower, namely Edward V of England and Richard of Shrewsbury, imprisoned in the Tower of London at the behest of the regency council, after the death of their father Edward IV. The two princes were declared illegitimate through the act known as Titulus Regius, so the council of safety decreed their uncle, who became Richard III, as successor. This depiction shows the two children huddling together, sensing their murderous fate. Their murder is usually believed to have been ordered by Richard III, even if there isn't historical evidence of that. The dramatic tension of the scene is highlighted by the small dog in alert, at the left, the light that enters under the door and the anxious gaze of one of the children; all these details suggest an imminent entrance and accentuate the drama of the scene.\nThe episode of the princes in the Tower also appears at the end of an act of the play Richard III, by William Shakespeare, which knew a wide diffusion in France at the time. Several elements of the canvas give a late medieval atmosphere: one of the children holds a book where there is a miniature of the Annunciation of Mary; the medallion with a goldsmith's work; and the decoration of the bed. Several English references shown are the royal emblems at the foot of the bed and the ribbon of the Order of the Garter on the leg of one of children..\n\n\n== Provenance ==\nIn 1831 it was bought by the French state for 6000 francs and placed in the Luxembourg Museum. In 1878 it entered the Louvre, in Paris.\n\n\n== References ==",

The gun was created by the main protagonist Megamind, who uses this weapon to disable his enemies.\nThe dehydration gun has the ability to turn any matter (living and inanimate) into small, blue cubes. If a living being is shot by the dehydration gun, they do not die when transformed into a cube but rather stay dormant until the effect is reversed. The effect is easily reversed by applying water to the cube, which will return the matter back into it's previous form. \nThe gun later went on to feature in the spin-off movie Megamind vs. the Doom Syndicate, which saw the dehydration gun gain popularity on the internet through a video created by Schaffrillas Productions, a popular youtuber, in which he pointed out the obvious when Megamind could have easily disabled the Doom Syndicate if he used the dehydration gun on the team members, like he did to another smaller group of villains, but if done so would have rendered the spin-off movie obsolete due to the lack of any threat. Schaffrillas' continued annoyance with the lack of common sense when referring to the writing of the movie led to the quote \"shoot them with the dehydration gun\" when rhetorically asking how Megamind could possibly stop the doom syndicate, the obvious anger portrayed through his shouting spawned a small variety of internet memes when discussing this film, even leading to the creation of this Wikipedia page.",

In the first public performance in 1960, three naked models on stage were painted with International Klein Blue body paint during the performance, and left imprints of their bodies on canvas.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n4' 33\", a 1952 piece of music with extended silence by John Cage",

        "content": "It's Me is an album by jazz vocalist Abbey Lincoln. It was recorded during November 25–27, 2002, at Sear Sound in New York City, and was released in 2003 by Verve Records and Gitanes Jazz Productions. On the album, Lincoln is joined by saxophonist and flutist James Spaulding, saxophonist Julien Lourau, pianist Kenny Barron, double bassist Ray Drummond, and drummer Jaz Sawyer. Seven tracks also feature an orchestra, the recordings of which were overdubbed on February 10, 2003, at Right Track Studios in New York City. The music on the orchestral tracks was arranged and conducted by Alan Broadbent and Laurent Cugny.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nIn a review for AllMusic, Robert L. Doerschuk wrote: \"Whether working with or without strings, [Lincoln] maintains a sophisticated and intimate tunefulness; her adherence to melody, and to subtle phrasing as an alternative to showy improvisation, has always earned comparisons to the work of Billie Holiday, though in this case Lincoln more than matches and arguably surpasses much of the legendary singer's work.\"\nA reviewer for All About Jazz stated: \"Lincoln continues to produce timeless recordings... It's Me is as strong as any entry in her half-century discography... Lincoln shows us again that she excels in being both a most memorable interpreter and an original singer/songwriter.\"\nThe authors of The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings praised the title track and Cedar Walton's \"The Maestro,\" where Barron's \"genius shines out alongside Abbey's gift as a lyricist.\" However, they noted that \"one increasingly feels that Lincoln has now settled into a reliably grand manner which will see her through.\"\nMark Anthony Neal of PopMatters commented: \"so much of Lincoln's verve is about her voice — those once disparaged flat tones — and the myriad of colors that Lincoln summons within those tones... it's Lincoln's loyal fans and new converts who most benefit, as we've been able to witness 'A Woman at Her Peak'... in the autumn of her life.\"\nA writer for Billboard remarked: \"When Abbey Lincoln sings, people listen, especially aspiring—as well as established—female vocalists... [she] vocalizes with authority; her husky, dark-tinged voice is drenched in melancholy, buoyant with joy and steeped in wisdom.\"\nCMJ New Music Report's Tad Hendrickson wrote: \"Through a myriad of colors, moods, emotions and her singular... vocal range... Lincoln comes closer to the spirit of Billie Holiday's music than any of her peers... [she] puts forth yet another strong effort... the album's highlight is the gospel-flavored title cut - the voice and piano arrangement is solid with exceptional performances by Lincoln and pianist Kenny Barron.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"Skylark\" (Hoagy Carmichael, Johnny Mercer) – 5:25\n\"Love Is Made\" (Abbey Lincoln) – 4:02\n\"Chateaux de Joux\" (Abbey Lincoln) – 4:38\n\"It's Me, O' Lord (Standin' in the Need of Prayer)\" (Abbey Lincoln, traditional) – 3:42\n\"They Call It Jazz\" (Abbey Lincoln) – 5:14\n\"Through the Years\" (Abbey Lincoln) – 4:30\n\"Runnin' Wild\" (Arthur Gibbs, Joe Grey, Leo Wood) – 3:52\n\"The Maestro\" (Cedar Walton) – 5:25\n\"The Search\" (Robert Wooldridge) – 5:31\n\"Yellow Bird\" (Irving Burgie) – 4:45\n\"Can You Dig It\" (Abbey Lincoln) – 5:39\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nAbbey Lincoln – vocals\nJames Spaulding – alto saxophone, flute\nJulien Lourau – tenor saxophone, soprano saxophone\nKenny Barron – piano\nRay Drummond – double bass\nJaz Sawyer – drums\nOrchestra (tracks 1–3, 5–6, 9–10)\nAlan Broadbent – conductor, arranger (tracks 2, 5, 9)\nLaurent Cugny – conductor, arranger (tracks 1, 3, 6, 10)\nSusan Niedel-Palma, Susan Rotholv – flute\nSteve Hartman, Shari Hoffman – clarinet\nBob Carlisle, Dan Culpepper, Jeff Lang, Stewart Rose – French horn\nSanford Allen, Jonathan Dinklege, Joyce Hammann, Ashley Horn, Regis Iandiorio, Pauline Kim, Belinda Whitney, Kristof Witek, Robin Zeh – violin\nTed Ackerman, Akua Dixon Turre, David Heiss, Ariane Lallemand, Richard Locker, Alexandra McKenzie, Kermit Moore – cello\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ernest Frederick Cambridge Lane, CMG, JP (11 November 1882 – 6 January 1958) was a British-South African official who served as the private secretary of Jan Smuts. He was nicknamed 'Long Lane'.\nThe eldest son of Frederick George Alexander Lane, Ernest Lane went to South Africa, where he became private secretary to Jan Smuts in 1904, in addition to serving as his aide-de-camp during the South West Africa campaign.\nLane then served with the South African Heavy Artillery, but was recalled to France to serve as principal private secretary to Smuts, who was then a member of the British war cabinet. Lane subsequently became head of the prime minister's department when Smuts became prime minister of the Union. He accompanied Smuts to the signature of the Paris Peace Treaty, and was appointed a CMG in 1920.\nIn 1929, Lane went to Northern Rhodesia as the local representative of the British South Africa Company.\nHe retired to Dorset, where his family had its roots, in 1934. He was a member of the Dorset County Council from 1936 to 1955. He served as Sheriff of Dorsetshire in 1943.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Francis Riollay (1748–1797) was a French physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nRiollay was the son of Christopher Riollay of Guingamp, France. He was born in Brittany. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, and there graduated B.A., devoting himself mainly to classical studies. He published at Oxford in 1776 a student's edition of the text with Reitzius's Latin version of Lucian's πῶς δεῖ ἱστορίαν συγγράφειν, dedicated to his friend, Thomas Winstanley. He was incorporated at Oxford on 13 January 1777, proceeded M.A. on 29 April 1780, and began to practice medicine at Newbury. He published in 1778 in London ‘A Letter to Dr. Hardy on the Hints he has given concerning the Origin of Gout,’ in which he makes the ingenious suggestion that gout is a disease of the nervous system, but fails to support it by any anatomical evidence. Dr. Hardy published a reply in 1780. Riollay graduated M.B. at Oxford in March 1782, and M.D. on 13 July 1784. He moved to London, where he lived in Hart Street, Bloomsbury, and in 1783 published ‘The Doctrines and Practice of Hippocrates in Surgery and Physic,’ an abstract of the Hippocratic writings, with a complete translation of the aphorisms. He became a candidate or member of the Royal College of Physicians on 9 August 1784, and was elected a fellow on 15 August 1785. In 1787 he delivered the Gulstonian lectures, three in number, on fever. They were published, with a Latin preface, in 1788, and contain a clear account of the classical, mediæval, and then existing doctrines as to fever, without any clinical illustrations or personal observations. He also gave the Harveian oration in 1787, and was Croonian lecturer in 1788, 1789, and 1790. He went to live at Margate in 1791, and there died in 1791.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Moore, Norman (1896). \"Riollay, Francis\".

These series are mostly adapted from web fictions and are released on new media platforms such as TikTok (抖音 in China). Each episode is very short, lasting only around one minute. To facilitate viewing on mobile devices, Duanju are directly produced in a vertical screen.

        "content": "Sir John Watt Reid  (25 February 1823 – 24 February 1909) was a Scottish medical director-general of the Royal Navy.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nReid was born in Edinburgh on 25 February 1823. He was the younger son of John Watt Reid, surgeon in the navy by his wife Jane, daughter of James Henderson, an Edinburgh merchant. Educated at Edinburgh Academy, at the university there, and at the extramural medical school, he qualified L.R.C.S. Edinburgh in 1844. He entered the navy as an assistant surgeon on 6 February 1845, and after serving a commission on board the Rodney in the Channel was appointed in March 1849 to the naval hospital, Plymouth, and received the approval of the Admiralty for his services there during the cholera epidemic of that year. In January 1852 he was appointed as acting surgeon to the Inflexible, sloop, in the Mediterranean; on 12 September 1854 he was promoted to surgeon, and in June 1855 appointed to the London, line-of-battle ship, on the same station. In these two ships he served in the Black Sea until the fall of Sevastopol, and received the Crimean and Turkish medals with the Sevastopol clasp, and was also thanked by the commander-in-chief James Whitley Deans Dundas for his services to the crew of the flagship when stricken with cholera in 1854. In 1856 he took the degree of M.D. at Aberdeen; and, after serving for a short time in the flagship at Devonport, was appointed in April 1857 to the Belleisle, hospital ship, on board which he continued during the China war of 1857–9, for which he received the medal. In January 1860 he was appointed to the Nile, of 90 guns, and served in her for four years on the North American station, after which he went to Haslar hospital until promoted to staff surgeon on 6 September 1866. After a year's further service in the Mediterranean, he was in June 1870 placed in charge of the naval hospital at Haulbowline, where he remained till 1873. During the concluding months of the Third Anglo-Ashanti War he served on board the Nebraska, hospital ship, at Cape Coast Castle, for which he was mentioned in despatches, received the medal and, on 31 March 1874, was promoted to deputy inspector-general. In that rank he had charge of the medical establishments at Bermuda from 1875 to 1878, when he was appointed to Haslar hospital. On 25 February 1880 he was promoted to be inspector-general and was appointed medical director-general of the navy. This post he held till his retirement eight years later, when the board of admiralty recorded their high opinion of his zeal and efficiency. He became an honorary physician to Queen Victoria in Feb. 1881 and to King Edward VII in 1901, was awarded the K.C.B. (military) on 24 November 1882, and had the honorary degree of LL.D. conferred upon him by Edinburgh University at its tercentenary in 1884. A medical good service pension was awarded him in July 1888.\nReid died in London on 24 February 1909, and was buried at Bramshaw, Hampshire. He married, on 6 July 1863, Georgina, daughter of C. J. Hill of Halifax, Nova Scotia.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, Leonard George Carr (1912). \"Reid, John Watt\".

        "content": "Scottish Permissive Bill and Temperance Association was a British citizen organisation entirely outside of political parties. It was established in Glasgow, October 1, 1858. Its membership included persons of all types of political opinion. The \"Father\" of the Scottish Permissive Bill itself was Sir Wilfrid Lawson, 2nd Baronet, of Brayton.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIt was formed to assist in procuring the entire suppression of the Liquor Traffic by the power of the national will, and through the form of a legislative enactment. Up to that time the temperance movement in Scotland had been conducted largely on moral suasion lines, but the founders of this Association, while fully recognising the principle of Total Abstinence carried out into consistent practice, as the only certain remedy for intemperance, were convinced by long and painful experience that it was next to impossible to secure anything like a general reception of and fidelity to its principles while the licensed temptations of the Drink Traffic existed, and that its suppression was only possible through the united efforts of moral reformers, whether abstainers or not. They resolved, therefore, to endeavour to unite the power and influence of the Scottish abstainers with that of all who saw the necessity for the suppression of the Liquor Traffic in the best interests of the Commonwealth.\nThe Scottish Permissive Bill and Temperance Association worked in full harmony with the United Kingdom Alliance, especially in promoting the Permissive Bill of Sir Wilfrid Lawson, Bart., M. P. It was for a number of years cooperated with Peter McLagan, Esq., M.P., who introduced into the House of Commons the Local Veto (Scotland) Bill, which provided that the ratepayers, in any area or district, may, by their direct votes, suppress all licenses for the sale of intoxicating liquors in such area or district, should they desire to do so. This Bill was brought forward session after session by Mr. McLagant. Its principle was adopted in the separate Veto Bills for England, Wales, and Ireland.\nThe Association carried on the agitation by means of public meetings, lectures, conferences, the promotion of electoral organisation, letters to the public press, the interviewing of all candidates for Parliamentary honours, and the distribution of literature. The Social Reformer, a monthly journal, was started in 1866 and carried on until 1885, when it was merged in the Reformer, a weekly newspaper of eight pages, which circulated as The Scottish Reformer all over Scotland.\nThe Association had six agents, resident in various Districts of the Country, and four general and financial agents. It also employed several occasional agents, besides receiving valuable help from many volunteer advocates. The income of the Association during the first year of its existence was £202.0.5; for the year ending September 30, 1892, the amount was £4353.9.3. The list of subscribers in 1859 numbered 207, while in 1892, it was 7,857.\nThe first President and chairman of Executive was James Torrens, Esq., J.P., Glasgow, who occupied the latter position. until his death in 1884. The President in 1893 was John Wilson, Esq., M.P., and the chairman of Executive James L. Selkirk, Esq., J.P., one of the founders of the Association. Mary Cranston Mason was a foundation member of the Ladies' Auxiliary of the Association, and after serving in different capacities, was president of that Auxiliary from 1903.\nWhile the Association gave its best help to every measure brought forward in the interests of true Temperance, it never swerved from its belief in the inherent evil of the Drink Traffic.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Scottish Permissive Bill and Temperance Association at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "Ann Watt Milne (1856 – no earlier than 1928) was a Scotch temperance leader who served as president of the British Women's Temperance Association (BWTA).\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nAnn Watt was born at Watermill Farm, Fraserburgh, Scotland, July 20, 1856.\nShe was educated in the Young Ladies School at Fraserburgh and at St. Leonard's Boarding School, Banff.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAs a young woman she became interested in the temperance cause, organizing a Women's Society for Temperance and other social reform. She was made president of the Society, which grew in power and influence until its membership reached 1,000, and took an active part in its work, also writing tracts and pamphlets in its interest. She was active in opposing the granting of new licenses in Fraserburgh and the renewal of licenses whose owners had violated the law. Her local temperance activities led to her appointment on the Agency Staff of the Scottish Permissive Bill and Temperance Association in Glasgow. She organized a Ladies’ Auxiliary to the Association, which has ever since proved a helpful adjunct to the ordinary work of that organization. After four years of active service with the Association she resigned because of her marriage to the Rev. G. C. Milne, after which she removed to Aberdeen.\nMilne became associated with the temperance organizations of Aberdeen, and was a leader in the local branches of the BWTA. On the formation of the Aberdeen District Union, including the counties of Aberdeen and Banff, she was elected its first president. She also took a prominent part in the work of the National Temperance Council of Scotland. In 1901, Milne was appointed Parliamentary superintendent of the BWTA's, Scottish Christian Union (SCU) for Scotland, which office she still held in 1928. She thus rendered helpful service in connection with the enactment of the Temperance (Scotland) Act (1913).\nIn 1906, she was elected vice-president of the BWTA, serving until 1923, when she became president of the Association, and she was reelected in 1924. During many years, she rendered valuable service to the Association as one of its most gifted and acceptable speakers. She frequently represented that body at national and international temperance gatherings. She was also a member of the executive of the Scottish Temperance Alliance, and addressed meetings throughout England, Scotland, and Ireland. Representing Scotland, she served on the General Council and the executive committee of the World League Against Alcoholism.\nDuring World War I, Milne was active in patriotic work. She was president of the Aberdeen Women's Patriotic Society for the wives of soldiers and sailors. She was the leader in organizing a great National Memorial with a quarter of a million signatures, asking the Prime Minister and the Government to prohibit the liquor traffic during the period of the War and six months thereafter, and she was one of the members of the committee that presented it to the Prime Minister, through the Secretary for Scotland.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nShe was twice married: (1) to Dr. J. L. Henderson (died soon after marriage); (2) in 1898, to the Rev. George Coates Milne, of Aberdeen. Rev. Milne served as President of the Congregational Union of Scotland.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "UraMin is a Canadian company involved in uranium mining exploration, listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange since December 2006, and acquired by the French multinational Areva (now Orano) on June 15, 2007, for 1.8 billion euros, to secure its uranium supply.\nIn 2006, the price of nuclear fuel rose sharply. Over the winter, Uramin buys uranium deposits in Africa, but in 2008 these proved to be inoperable. This contributed to Areva's difficulties, as it found itself short of fuel for its customers, especially as the price of uranium finally fell in 2011, causing Uramin to lose all its value.\nAreva's 2007 takeover bid for Uramin marked the beginning of the \"UraMin affair\". The press revealed this politico-financial scandal involving French, Canadian, and African entrepreneurs and politicians in the early 2010s. The intelligence services, the French National Assembly, the Cour des Comptes, and the French justice system investigated various aspects of the case. Gradually, revelations of espionage, corruption, fraud, and conflicts of interest accumulated in the press.\nIncluding losses, Uramin cost Areva over 3 billion euros. Areva CEO Anne Lauvergeon was dismissed in 2011.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2005: Creation of Uramin Inc. ===\nOn December 20, 2004, the French company \"Cogema Développement 1\" was created, to become the holding company Uramin Holding.\nOn February 25, 2005, Uramin Inc. was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands (a UK tax haven). Uramin was created by Stephen Dattels and James Mellon, owners of uranium deposits in Africa listed on the London and Toronto markets. Stephen Dattels is one of the founders of mining company Barrick Gold. The Quebec newspaper La Presse traced him to two other stock market operations that went awry. James Mellon, co-founder of Uramin, had already been prosecuted by financial prosecutors in South Korea.\nIn May 2005, Stephen Dattels and his associates secured the rights to Trekkopje by purchasing Gulf Western Trading Namibia from businessman George Christodoulou for $4.365 million. Thousands of American investors, including stars Elvis Presley, Johnny Carson and Alice Cooper, believe they were cheated in an allegedly fraudulent project by Christodoulou in Namibia in the late 1970s.\nIn October 2005, Stephen Dattels acquired 6,000 ha around the Ryst Kuil deposit in South Africa for $1 million.\n\n\n=== 2006: IPO and speculation ===\nUramin was floated on the high-risk London Stock Exchange in April 2006.\nIn May 2006, Uramin acquired three new mining licenses for $27 million a few kilometers north of Bakouma in the Central African Republic.\nIn 2006, Olivier Fric, a consultant specializing in energy issues and Anne Lauvergeon's husband, passed on the curriculum vitae of Belgian financier Daniel Wouters, who was subsequently hired in April by Areva as head of development and acquisitions for its mining division to act as an intermediary in the takeover of Canadian company UraMin. According to the daily newspaper Libération, Daniel Wouters is financially linked to Uramin shareholders Mellon and Dattels.\nEstimates of Uramin's deposits were initially carried out by SRK Consulting, a consulting firm commissioned by UraMin to audit its reserves.\nOn October 17, 2006, Uramin proposed to Areva CEO Anne Lauvergeon that it be bought out for $471 million. However, Mrs. Lauvergeon did not immediately respond to this offer. At the end of October, Mrs. Lauvergeon received a letter from Samuel Jonah, chairman of the Board of Directors of UraMin, putting an end to the discussions and suggesting that she contact him again in early 2007.\nOn October 22, 2006, in Canada, the Cigar Lake mine (the world's second-largest uranium mine, 37% owned by Areva) flooded for the second time in a row, for the same reasons that the McArthur uranium mine13 had been blocked for six months in April 2003: the artificial protective ice wall was not enough to block the moisture coming from underground. Uranium prices soared.\nIn December 2006, eight months after listing on the London Stock Exchange, Uramin was listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange.\n\n\n=== 2007: acquisition of UraMin ===\n\nFollowing the IPO in December 2006, Uramin's share price was the subject of intense speculation in the spring of 2007. The reason for this was a flurry of promises and declarations by the two owners. In just a few months, the share price tripled.\nIn 2007, the spot price of uranium hit an all-time high ($135 per pound) due to a \"uranium shortage that could hit nuclear power plants in the next thirty to forty years\", but quickly fell below $100 after the acquisition of UraMin in the summer of 2007, then below $50 following the Fukushima nuclear accident in March 2011.\nUraMin, a young Canadian start-up in 2007, had never mined uranium before. Its assets consisted of projects, many of which had been identified by French entities (CEA, Cogema, etc.) that were gradually merged into Areva.\nUraMin's properties are located in 5 African countries:\n\nNamibia (Trekkopje uranium mine, UraMin's main deposit, whose uranium content was initially estimated at 90,000 tonnes, then revised downwards to 45,000 tonnes, then 26,000 tonnes);\nin the Central African Republic (Bakouma uranium deposit); the Bakouma deposit was initially discovered in 1947 by the French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA), when the Central African Republic was a French colony within the federation of French Equatorial Africa;\nSouth Africa: Ryst Kuil project, 30 km southeast of Beaufort West.\nSenegal (Saraya), 80 km northwest of Faléa (Mali)\nin Niger (Kamas, 75 km north of Arlit, and Dabala, 40 km northeast of Maradi).\nThese projects had been abandoned by their inventors, who considered them unprofitable. URAMIN was able to add these assets to its portfolio at a very low cost. However, the company was acquired by the Areva group in the summer of 2007 at a very high price.\nIn March 2007, Areva first announced the purchase of 5.5% of Uramin's capital, causing the share price to soar, before buying the entire company three months later for $2.5 billion.\nOn May 2, 2007, between the two rounds of the 2007 presidential election, Areva executives reached an agreement in London with the sellers of Uramin to set the timetable for the takeover bid. The decision was taken under the authority of Anne Lauvergeon, with the a priori approval of the Agence des participations de l'État (APE, which holds 87% of Areva's capital), and at a time when Luc Oursel (future Chairman of Areva) was already present (since March 2007) on the (Areva) Management Board, which he joined in January 2007. On June 15, Areva announced that the purchase had been completed for $2.5 billion (€1.8 billion).\nAreva had been prevented from acquiring the Australian giant Olympic Dam and had been unable to acquire Summit Resources, but the deal went ahead. It was carried out with relative urgency, Areva arguing that \"UraMin has set May 31, 2007 as the deadline for a transaction to purchase its shares\"; on June 15, 2007, \"Areva announced a tender offer for Uramin based on a price of US$7.7 per share, representing an attractive premium excluding dividends of 21% over the 20-day weighted average share price as of June 8, 2007. Areva's press release states that UraMin's Board of Directors considered the offer \"to be in the best interests of [its] shareholders\". The price paid by Areva was therefore around ten times higher than UraMin's share price six months earlier.\nOn January 2, 2008, Sébastien de Montessus became Chairman of Uramin Holding, a société par actions simplifiée (simplified joint-stock company) based on rue La Fayette (Paris), as well as Director of the Areva Group's Mining Business Unit.\n\n\n=== 2008: Areva's first difficulties ===\nIn 2008, Areva's partner China Guangdong Nuclear Power Company (CGNPC) was due to buy 49% of UraMin, but this never happened. However, CGNPC is said to have made direct access to uranium supplies a condition of the purchase of the EPR reactors (Taishan nuclear power plant).\nUntil March 2008, no Areva employees were allowed to visit Uramin sites in the Central African Republic, which was contesting the acquisition of Uramin's local subsidiary, Uramin CAR. The Central African Republic demanded 250 million euros from Areva for access to the deposit. This is why, in April 2008, Belgian entrepreneur George Forrest and Patrick Balkany, deputy mayor (UMP) of Levallois-Perret (Hauts-de-Seine), acted as intermediaries in Areva's purchase of UraMin's Central African uranium mines. On August 1, 2008, Anne Lauvergeon signed an amendment to the Bakouma mining concession contract, committing the company to pay forty million dollars to the Central African state.\n\n\n=== 2009: French secret service investigation ===\nAccording to geopolitical expert Vincent Crouzet, the Direction Centrale du Renseignement Intérieur (DCI) began investigating the Uramin case as early as 2009, interviewing Pakistani businessman Saïfee Durbar, who had been asked by Central African President François Bozizé to look into the Uramin affair.\nOn October 28, 2009, Vincent Crouzet met with Saïfee Durbar at his home in London (Ilchester Place, near Holland Park) and spoke at length with him about the Uramin affair.\n\n\n=== 2010: launch of a government audit ===\nIn February 2010, Admiral Thierry d'Arbonneau, Areva's Director of Safety, recruited Marc Eichinger, a business intelligence expert with the consulting firm Assistance Petroleum International Capital (APIC), to investigate the Uramin takeover. The investigation report was delivered on April 10, 2010, to the office of Areva's safety director, and concluded that the deal was \"highly dubious and potentially fraudulent\".\nIn April 2010, the French state shareholder was alarmed and appointed René Ricol (a chartered accountant) to chair the audit committee of Areva's supervisory board, and to clarify accounts deemed lacking in transparency, notably concerning the recent acquisition of UraMin. He \"made provisions of 426 million euros in 2010 for UraMin uranium quantities, and included a paragraph in the notes to the annual financial statements referring to chemical tests that were not very good\".\nOn April 16, 2010, Anne Lauvergeon and Hage Geingob, Minister of Trade and Industry of the Republic of Namibia, inaugurated Namibia's first seawater desalination plant, located near the Trekkopje site. Designed to supply water to Areva's future mine, the plant cost $250 million to build.\n\n\n=== 2011: French parliamentary audit and suspension of projects in Africa ===\nOn February 2, 2011, Sébastien de Montessus met with Swiss detective Mario Brero at the Kempinski Hotel in Geneva to commission him to investigate the Uramin takeover, and in particular Anne Lauvergeon and her husband Olivier Fric.\nOn April 23, 2011, Paris Match revealed that \"the African deposits of subsidiary UraMin have still not produced a single gram of uranium\".\nOn June 21, 2011, the French National Assembly launched a financial audit of EDF and Areva, to examine the terms of the Uramin takeover. Member of Parliament Marc Goua expressed surprise that Areva had not detected the overvaluation of resources announced by UraMin. He was astonished that \"the Agence des participations de l'État, which was initially very cautious about the dossier, considered it a great victory in July 2007\", but a few months later, Areva had to make provisions of 2.36 billion in its budget to settle its debts. The audit found no trace of illegal interest-taking, but based on the names of UraMin shareholders (confidential), it was considered possible that they were trust companies operating in the tax haven where UraMin was based.\nAt the end of October 2011, Sébastien de Montessus, then head of mining at Areva, travelled to Bangui to inform Central African President François Bozizé that the Bakouma uranium mine project had been frozen.\nOn December 13, 2011, Areva announced that it was suspending its investments in uranium mining projects at Ryst Kuil in South Africa and the Trekkopje uranium mine in Namibia. After investing 1 billion euros in the Trekkopje mine's infrastructure - including a seawater desalination plant - Areva announces the mine's closure due to lack of economic profitability. Areva's supervisory board also announced that it had launched an internal investigation into the UraMin takeover \"to examine the conditions under which UraMin was acquired and operated, and to draw lessons for the Group\"; the investigation will be conducted by three \"independent\" members of the board, aiming for a conclusion by early 2012.\nAt the end of 2011, Areva's takeover of Uramin was the subject of controversy, before proving to be a source of heavy financial losses. A further 80% write-down of the mining company's value took place because the deposit turned out to be less rich in uranium than announced, and due to a drop in uranium prices, particularly after the Fukushima nuclear accident.\nAt the same time, Luc Oursel, newly appointed Chairman of Areva's management board in June 2011, commissioned lawyer Jean Reinhart to produce a report on the UraMin fiasco.\n\n\n=== Secret wars and Swiss spies ===\nIn December 2011, several French media outlets revealed that Anne Lauvergeon had filed a complaint for \"complicity and concealment in the violation of professional secrecy\".\nSébastien de Montessus, head of the group's mining division, and a number of Areva executives had allegedly commissioned an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the Uramin transaction, and in particular the murky role played by Anne Lauvergeon's husband, Olivier Fric. The investigation resulted in a 15-page report entitled \"Pomerol 4\", which was delivered \"by an anonymous hand\" to Anne Lauvergeon, who then discovered its existence.\nAnne Lauvergeon files a complaint in Paris against the Swiss investigation company, its director Mario Brero and Sébastien de Montessus46. She believes she is the victim of a plot to destabilize her, orchestrated by a handful of executives - chief among them Areva's Mining Director, Sébastien de Montessus - to oust her.\nAccording to information on the \"Pomerol 4\" report published in the press, the telephone numbers dialed by Olivier Fric \"include that of a banker working for Liechtenstein Global Trust (LGT) and those of other banks, Clariden Leu and Crédit Suisse. Not enough to support suspicions of illicit enrichment through the purchase of Uramin, but enough to \"suggest that Mr. Fric holds assets hidden illegally in Switzerland\".\n\n\n== 2012: South Africa revelations and spy scandal ==\n\n\n=== Areva and the corruption of the South African regime ===\nUramin's main shareholder - he holds 26% - is Samuel Esson Jonas. This Ghanaian businessman, knighted by the Queen of England, sits on some boards, including that of Vodafone, where he met Anne Lauvergeon.\nA well-documented article, the Mail On Guardian, a reference in the South African press, details how the clan of South African President Thabo Mbeki had been largely fuelled by the sale of Uramin. At the time of the Uramin sale, the President of South Africa was dangling a huge nuclear power plant construction contract worth over 100 billion euros in front of Areva. A surprising detail is that Areva's Anne Lauvergeon and Uramin's Ghanaian Sam Jonah sat together on the International Investment Council, the body appointed by Thabo Mbeki to steer South Africa's economic policy.\nAt the time, Areva was battling fiercely against Toshiba-Westinghouse to sell Pretoria 2 nuclear reactors (3,500 MW), while additional reactors of up to 20,000 MW were being discussed.\nAccording to an anonymous Uramin witness quoted in the South African newspaper:\n\n\"The deal was for Areva to buy Uramin and win the tender in return. Areva was paying too much for Uramin - which was worth half as much. But the French group was going to win contracts for reactors and an enrichment plant, worth ten times as much.\"\n\n\n=== Evacuation of the Bakouma site ===\nAt the end of June 2012, the Lord's Resistance Army attacked Areva's Bakouma site in the Central African Republic. On September 21, 2012, Areva definitively evacuated the Bakouma site and 150 workers were laid off.\n\n\n=== 2013: sale of the South African deposit ===\nIn December 2013, Areva sold its mining rights at Ryst Kuil to Australian company Peninsula Energy Ltd for $5 million.\n\n\n=== 2014: new disclosures ===\nOn April 4, 2014, writer Vincent Crouzet published a Roman à clef entitled Radioactive, in which he recounts a story similar to Areva's purchase of Uramin, during which kickbacks were obtained by the imaginary company Murena (Areva).\nOn April 10, 2014, journalists Gérard Davet and Fabrice Lhomme published an article in the daily Le Monde revealing that the financial prosecutor's office had opened an investigation into Anne Lauvergeon's suspicious purchase of UraMin.\nIn May 2014, a pre-report by the French Cour des Comptes on Areva's management under Anne Lauvergeon highlighted \"the concentration of real power in the hands of the CEO\".\nOn May 16, 2014, Mario Brero and Sébastien de Montessus were summoned to appear before the 17th Chamber of the Correctional Court to explain themselves. At the end of a day of theatrical hearings, Sébastien de Montessus is acquitted in full, while Mario Brero is acquitted of all charges.\nOn June 3, 2014, as part of an investigation into the takeover of Uramin, police officers carried out a dozen searches at Areva and the home of its former president Anne Lauvergeon. Vincent Crouzet was also questioned for seven hours by the Paris financial brigade, as a witness. He is \"firmly convinced that this affair was set up to distribute considerable sums of money to high-level personalities, both African and French\". According to him, Uramin was used to \"pay commissions linked to the development of EPR programs around the world, and particularly in South Africa\".\nOn November 2, 2014, the Republic of Central Africa referred to the National Financial Prosecutor's Office a request for a judicial investigation into Patrick Balkany, suspected of having been one of the beneficiaries of the payment of kickbacks in the Uramin affair.\nIn December 2014, the newspaper Mediapart revealed that, before the purchase of Uramin, several Areva employees had tried in vain to alert government departments.\n\n\n=== 2015: corruption investigation against Patrick Balkany ===\nAt the end of 2014, the Central African Republic complained with the French National Financial Prosecutor's Office. According to the complaint, Patrick Balkany was involved in alleged embezzlement during the purchase of Uramin in 2007. In 2015, the Paris financial prosecutor's office opened an investigation into Patrick Balkany for bribery of a foreign public official.\nThe UMP deputy mayor of Levallois is suspected of having acted as an intermediary in settling a dispute between Areva and the previous Central African government.\nAccording to Saifee Durbar, a Pakistani businessman and advisor to Central African President François Bozizé, Balkany was working alongside George Forrest as early as 2007 to represent Areva's interests in the Central African Republic. Patrick Balkany is said to have received $8 million, paid into an account in Singapore, which he denies.\nOn May 28, 2015, the French justice system, relying on the 2014 preliminary report by the Cour des Comptes, announced the opening of two judicial inquiries against X. The first, which concerns the conditions and circumstances of the Uramin purchase, is open for \"fraud, misuse of corporate assets, corruption of a foreign public official\". The second was opened for \"dissemination of false information to the markets, presentation of inaccurate accounts, abuse of power, forgery and use of forgeries\".\n\n\n=== 2016: new revelations of corruption ===\nOn February 16, 2016, South Africa's Tokyo Sexwale was accused of taking around $200 million in bribes on the sidelines of Areva's 2007 takeover of mining company Uramin, to open up the South African market for the construction of several EPR reactors.\nOn March 30, 2016, Olivier Fric was indicted for \"insider trading\" and \"money laundering\" in the Uramin affair. The affair was revealed in August 2015 by journalists Hervé Gattegno and Philippe Vasset of Vanity Fair magazine, whose main source is Mario Bréro, the head of Swiss investigative firm Alp Services, a specialist in the Uramin affair.\nIn May 2016, Anne Lauvergeon was indicted as part of the investigation into the acquisition of UraMin for \"presenting and publishing inaccurate accounts and disseminating false information\". She has been placed under assisted witness status.\nOn May 4, 2016, Vincent Crouzet revealed that businessman Stephen Dattels, who sold UraMin to Areva, is one of the biggest donors to US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's Clinton Foundation.\nOn October 12, Reuters revealed, from a judicial source, that \"Areva's former CFO, Alain-Pierre Raynaud, has been indicted in the investigation into the valuation of the mining company Uramin.\" The charges relate to \"the presentation and publication of inaccurate accounts and the dissemination of false information.\"\nAt the end of 2016, the US justice system asked the FBI to investigate Areva's takeover of Uramin.\n\n\n== 2017 - 2018: legal proceedings ==\nThe Uramin affair is at the heart of two judicial inquiries: one into accounting, the other into fraud.\n\n\n=== Inaccurate accounting ===\nAnne Lauvergeon, President of the Areva Group (now Orano) from 2001 to 2011, and two other former executives are under investigation in an accounting case. They are suspected by the National Financial Prosecutor's Office of having concealed in their accounts the loss in value of the Uramin company following its takeover by Areva in 2007. Indeed, Areva's 2010 balance sheet shows only 426 million euros in provisions for Uramin's assets, whereas a few months later, at the end of June 2011 after Anne Lauvergeon's departure, 1.456 billion euros were finally provisioned. This investigation follows on from that of 2016.\nIn January 2017, the investigating judges summoned Pascal Colin, Areva's auditor at Deloitte. He was placed under assisted witness status. Then it was the former chairman of Areva's audit committee, René Ricol, who was summoned by judges Renaud Van Ruymbeke, Claire Thépaut and Charlotte Bilger. On November 28, Areva's head office in La Défense was searched in connection with the affair.\nOn May 5, 2017, the national financial prosecutor's office requested the indictment of Anne Lauvergeon, Gérald Arbola, Alain-Pierre Raynaud, Thierry Noircler (former audit director), Sébastien de Montessus and Nicolas Nouveau (former Areva CFO) for obstructing the statutory auditors' mission. In addition, the public prosecutor's office is requesting that Sébastien de Montessus and Nicolas Nouveau be charged with complicity in the presentation of inaccurate annual accounts and the dissemination of misleading information. When the examining magistrates refused to proceed with these new indictments, the public prosecutor's office applied to the Paris Court of Appeal, which upheld this request in October 2018.\n\n\n=== Fraud section ===\nAn investigation has been opened into suspicions of embezzlement. In particular, the investigation concerns two contracts in 2009 and 2010 representing an expenditure of $6.9 million in favor of the Namibian mining group United Africa Group (UAG), and monthly payments of $10,000 in 2008 and 2009 to Hage Geingob, then Namibian Minister of Trade and Industry.\nIn addition, Olivier Fric, Anne Lauvergeon's husband, is under investigation for insider trading in connection with the Uramin takeover.\nFinally, Sébastien de Montessus is also suspected of corruption. He was allegedly paid 750,000 euros for acting as an intermediary in the sale of a yacht.\n\n\n== Timeline ==\nApril 2006: Uramin listed on the London Stock Exchange's High-Risk Market.\nApril 2006: Daniel Wouters, a Belgian, is appointed Head of Development and Mining Acquisitions at Areva.\nMay 2006: Uramin acquires three new mining permits for $27 million in the Central African Republic.\nOctober 17, 2006: Anne Lauvergeon did not respond to Uramin's offer to be bought for $471 million.\nOctober 17, 2006: failure to open the world's second-largest uranium mine, 37% owned by Areva.

The top 4 teams in the South, Central, and Mountain divisions qualified for the playoffs based on highest point total earned in the season.\nDespite tying in points percentage, the Maine Mariners qualified over the Worcester Railers due to holding the tiebreaker of a higher regulation win percentage. The Kansas City Mavericks, who won the Brabham Cup as regular season champions, were the first to clinch a playoff spot with a 7–4 win over Tulsa. \nThe first two rounds of the playoffs are held within the division with the first seed facing the fourth seed and the second seed facing the third. The division champions then play each other in a conference championship. The Kelly Cup finals pits the Eastern Conference champion against the Western Conference champion. All four rounds are a best-of-seven format. The Kansas City Mavericks, as Brabham Cup winners, are scheduled to have home ice advantage for all the rounds they advance in.\n10 out of the 16 teams in this year's playoffs were participants in the previous Kelly Cup playoffs.\n\n\n== Playoff seeds ==\nAfter the regular season, 16 teams qualified for the playoffs.\nFinal seeds and points:\n\n\n== Playoff bracket ==\nSource:\n\n\n== Division semifinals ==\nNote: All times listed are in EDT (UTC−4).\n\n\n=== North Division ===\n\n\n==== (1) Adirondack Thunder vs. (4) Maine Mariners ====\n\n\n==== (2) Norfolk Admirals vs. (3) Trois-Rivières Lions ====\n\n\n=== South Division ===\n\n\n==== (1) Greenville Swamp Rabbits vs. (4) Orlando Solar Bears ====\n\n\n==== (2) Jacksonville Icemen vs. (3) Florida Everblades ====\n\n\n=== Central Division ===\n\n\n==== (1) Toledo Walleye vs. (4) Kalamazoo Wings ====\n\n\n==== (2) Indy Fuel vs. (3) Wheeling Nailers ====\n\n\n=== Mountain Division ===\n\n\n==== (1) Kansas City Mavericks vs. (4) Tulsa Oilers ====\n\n\n==== (2) Idaho Steelheads vs. (3) Allen Americans ====\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Another Crab's Treasure is an upcoming soulslike action-adventure video game developed and published by Aggro Crab. The game is scheduled to be released for PlayStation 5, Windows, Nintendo Switch and Xbox Series X/S on April 25, 2024.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nAnother Crab's Treasure is a soulslike action-adventure video game played from a third-person perspective. The player controls Kril, a crab stripped of his protective shell. Shells function as Kril's armor, granting defensive capabilities, statistics, and even unique abilities. By scouring the seabed, Kril can transform discarded trash into functional tools for survival. A rusty can becomes a defensive powerhouse, while a chipped bottle transforms into a ranged weapon. Combat is deliberate and slow-paced, demanding players to dodge enemy attacks, identify openings, and leverage their shell's abilities to survive. Microplastics, remnants of a polluted world, become Kril's currency for upgrades and resources. Unlike most soul-like games, Another Crab's Treasure allows players to change the difficulty at any time.\nThe underwater world is a web of interconnected environments. As Kril navigates these treacherous landscapes, he encounters environmental puzzles and gradually unveils the story of the polluted ocean and its history. Similar to the Soulsborne series that inspired it, Another Crab's Treasure offers a challenging experience. Enemies inflict significant damage, death comes with a penalty, and victory hinges on learning enemy patterns and strategizing one's approach. The world itself is designed for exploration, with shortcuts and hidden areas waiting to be discovered. Newfound abilities grant access to previously unreachable locations, encouraging players to revisit areas and delve deeper. Environmental storytelling is emphasized by Aggro Crab, integrating the narrative into the world design, item descriptions, and cryptic messages from fellow inhabitants.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nAnother Crab's Treasure unfolds beneath the ocean's surface, where once-thriving aquatic domains now grapple with an ominous curse. Underwater landscapes have succumbed to the weight of environmental degradation and mysterious afflictions. Pollution threatens the delicate balance of marine life, rendering survival a precarious endeavor. Amidst this turmoil, players traverse coral reefs, kelp forests, and submerged cities, each locale serving as a backdrop to the protagonist's journey.\nThe central character, Kril, is a resilient hermit crab whose tranquil existence is abruptly disrupted when his cherished shell, the epitome of his identity, is pilfered by a cunning adversary. A thief presents Kril with a daunting proposition: recover a fabled treasure, and his stolen shell shall be returned. Undeterred by his newfound shell-less state, Kril embarks on an audacious quest, fashioning makeshift shells from the debris scattered across the ocean floor. Armed with determination, Kril navigates the depths, with each discarded item serving as a testament to his resilience and resourcefulness on his quest to reclaim his lost home.\n\n\n== Development ==\nAnother Crab's Treasure was announced during a Nintendo Indie World presentation in 2022. Aggro Crab showcased the game's soulslike concept. Following the announcement, details about the game emerged throughout 2023. Information regarding the core mechanics like the \"Shell System\" – where discarded trash becomes Kril's customizable armor – and the emphasis on exploration and environmental storytelling were revealed. Additionally, the developers confirmed the game's release platforms, including Nintendo Switch, PC, and Xbox One and Series X/S. The confirmation of Xbox availability, including its inclusion on Game Pass on launch day, came in June 2023. Aggro Crab announced that the game will be released on April 25, 2024.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "The Canadian Anti-Vivisection Society was a Canadian anti-vivisection organization that gained support in the early 20th-century. The Society aimed to eliminate the \"practice of cutting, burning or crushing any living man, bird or beast for experimental purposes\". The Society was the first anti-vivisection organization in Canada.\nThe Society was formed in July 1921 by Marguerite Mackay and Agnes Stanley in Toronto. By the second month, the Society reported that they had 40 members. Theosophist Flora MacDonald Denison and her son were present at the first meeting. Denison's sister was Agnes Stanley. The Society had strong links to the Toronto Humane Society, Theosophical Society and the anti-vaccination movement.  Most of the Society's members were women who supported the suffrage movement. Notable male members were cartoonist John Wilson Bengough and Toronto physician John B. Fraser. Bengough was a vice-president of the Toronto Humane Society.\nThe Society's first president was Agnes Stanley. John B. Fraser, an anti-vaccinationist and germ theory denialist was the second president of the Society in the 1920s. Fraser stated that the object of the Society was to prevent cruelty to animals in any way possible and that as a physician he did not know of any benefits that vivisection of animals had given humans. The Society denounced not only animal experimentation but the practice of vaccination as cruel to the animals from whom the serums were taken. In 1923, British anti-vivisectionist Walter Hadwen lectured at Forester's Hall, Toronto for the Society.\nDora Kitto (1873–1949), Honorary Secretary founded a separate branch of the Society in Victoria, British Columbia. Kitto's branch was renamed the Humane Education and Anti-Vivisection Society, the Anti-Vivisection Society of British Columbia in 1930 and the Animal Defence and Anti-Vivisection Society of British Columbia in 1946. After Kitto's death the Society was dissolved.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAmerican Anti-Vivisection Society\n\n\n== References ==",

Connacht and Ulster each contain two teams, so their championships are played as a single match.\nIn Leinster and Munster, there are four teams in the provincial championships. They play each other in a round-robin phase, with two teams progressing to the final.\n\n\n=== Group stage ===\nThe 12 teams are drawn into four groups of three teams; seeding is based on performance in the provincial championships. Each team plays each other team in its group once, earning three points for a win and one for a draw.\n\n\n=== Tiebreakers for group ranking ===\nIf two teams are level on points, the tie-break is:\n\nwinners of the head-to-head game are ranked ahead\nif the head-to-head match was a draw, then whichever team scored more points in the game is ranked ahead (e.g. 1-15 beats 2–12)\nif the head-to-head match was an exact draw, ranking is determined by the points difference (i.e. total scored minus total conceded in all games)\nif the points difference is equal, ranking is determined by the total scored\nIf three teams are level on league points, rankings are determined solely by points difference.\n\n\n=== Relegation ===\nThe last-placed teams in the groups play off to decide which team is relegated to the All-Ireland Intermediate Ladies' Football Championship.\n\n\n=== Knockout stage ===\nThe top two in each group progress to the All-Ireland quarter-finals. Quarter-finals and semi-finals are \"results on the day,\" with 20 minutes' extra time being played in the event of a draw, and a free-kick shootout being taken from a 30 m (33 yd) distance in the event of a draw after extra time. If the All-Ireland final is a draw, the game is replayed.\n\n\n== Fixtures ==\n\n\n=== Connacht Championship ===\n\n\n=== Leinster Championship ===\n\n\n==== Group stage ====\n\n\n==== Final ====\n\n\n=== Munster Championship ===\n\n\n==== Group stage ====\n\n\n==== Final ====\n\n\n=== Ulster Championship ===\n\n\n=== Group stage ===\nGroup games take place 8–22 June 2024.\n\n\n==== Group A ====\n\n\n==== Group B ====\n\n\n==== Group C ====\n\n\n==== Group D ====\n\n\n=== Relegation playoffs ===\n\n\n=== Finals ===\n\n\n== See also ==\n2024 All-Ireland Intermediate Ladies' Football Championship\n2024 All-Ireland Junior Ladies' Football Championship\n2024 Ladies' National Football League\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMaster fixture plan",

        "content": "Arthur Horatio Todd (7 July 1854 – 21 May 1945) was an association footballer and barrister who played in the 1877 FA Cup final for Oxford University.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nTodd was born in Marylebone, the 5th son of John Todd, a London merchant.\nHe entered Eton College in 1868, and enjoyed a distinguished sporting career at the college.  He was part of the rowing eights in 1872, played in the Wall Game for the Oppidans in 1871 and 1872, was Keeper of the Mixed Wall side in the latter year, and played in the Field XI in the same two years.  He was President of the Eton Society in the 1872–73 school year.\nIn 1873, he went up to University College, Oxford, and took his Bachelor of Arts in 1878.\n\n\n== Football career ==\nTodd's first recorded football match against a non-Eton side was against the Gitanos club (which featured many Old Etonians) in November 1872, and which was played to the Field Game rules.  Having gone up to  the University of Oxford, he played for the Oxford Etonians against his old school in November 1873 in another Field Game match, and finally started playing the association game in November 1875, his first such match being for University College against the university side.\nHe did not play for the university under association laws until 13 December 1876, but the match was a memorable one, as the university beat the Wanderers 1–0 at the Kennington Oval.  The next day he made his FA Cup debut for the university in a 6–1 win over the 105th Regiment at the same venue, scoring the second goal \"after a short run\".\nHe only played one more tie (the last-5 stage win over Upton Park) before the final, against the Wanderers, and the university went down in extra-time, despite Todd's \"brilliant runs\".  Before the Upton Park tie, he picked up his Blue in the Varsity match against Cambridge University, which Oxford won 1–0, despite being down to ten men after one of Todd's fellow forwards was injured just before half-time.\nThe Cup final appears to have been Todd's final match; he did not appear in the 1877–78 FA Cup and did not join another club after graduating.\n\n\n== Post-football career ==\nTodd was called to the Bar in 1880 as a tenant of the Inner Temple.  He worked on the South-Eastern circuit, and also became known as an editor of legal textbooks, his works including A Digest of Criminal Law Cases and later editions of On Parliamentary Government in England.\nHe married Catherine (née Ashworth), the daughter of the rector of Didcot in Wallingford in 1883 and the couple had one son, Arthur Henry Ashworth born on 6 August 1884; Catherine however died 21 days afterwards and Todd never remarried.\nHe died at his home in Kasauli, in India, on 21 May 1945.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Joseph M. Schwarz (10 October 1880 – 10 November 1926) was a Russian-born German baritone. He pursued a performance career against the wishes of his parents, running away from home as a teenager to join a band of traveling minstrels. He later trained at the Vienna Conservatory and had an active international performance career in operas and concerts during the first quarter of the twentieth century.\nAfter making his professional opera debut as Amonasro in Verdi's Aida at the Linz State Theatre in 1900, Schwarz worked as a resident artist at first the Rigaer Stadttheater and then the Graz Opera and Mariinsky Theatre. In 1906 he returned to Vienna to join the roster of artists at the Vienna Volksoper before being committed to the Vienna State Opera from 1909 to 1915. From 1915 to 1921 he was a principal artist at the Berlin State Opera, and from 1921 to 1925 he sang with the Chicago Opera Association and its predecessor the Chicago Civic Opera. He also appeared as a guest artist with several opera houses, including the Paris Opera, the San Francisco Opera, and the Royal Opera House in London.\nAlcoholism impacted Schwarz's voice during the latter part of his career and he died in Berlin in 1926. His voice is preserved on several recordings made during the first two decades of the twentieth century for a variety of record labels, including Zonophone, Pathé Records, and Deutsche Grammophon. He should not be confused with bass Joseph E. Schwarz who had a career at the Prague State Opera.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJoseph M. Schwarz was born in Riga on 10 October 1880 in what was then part of the Russian Empire and is today Latvia. His initial studies and performances in music were as a pianist in Riga. He grew up in poverty and had nine siblings. Part of a Jewish family, he attended services at Riga's Great Choral Synagogue on Gogol Street where the singing of cantor Baruch Leib Rosowsky had a profound impact on his decision to pursue a career as a vocalist. He joined the choir at that synagogue and had his initial vocal instruction in that ensemble.\nSchwarz's father was a tailor and his parents wanted Joseph to pursue this profession as well. Unhappy with the life planned for him by his family, he ran away from home and joined a band of traveling minstrels with whom he toured the Baltic provinces. Still a teenager, he was able to pursue formal education as a singer through the aid of a wealthy Russian nobleman. He studied singing in Berlin with baritone Alexander Heinemann (1873–1919) before entering the Vienna Conservatory. While studying in Vienna he performed with soprano Olga von Türk-Rohn in the very first professional concert featuring music composed by Robert Winterberg at Ehrbar Saal (English: Ehrbar Hall) inside the Palais Ehrbar.\n\n\n== Later life and singing career ==\nSchwarz made his professional opera debut in 1900 in Verdi's Aida at the Linz State Theatre. He then returned to Riga where he was a principal artist at the Rigaer Stadttheater (precursor to the Latvian National Opera) for two seasons. This was followed by two seasons with the Graz Opera. He then spent time performing with the Imperial Russian Opera at the Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg.\n\nAfter leaving St. Petersburg, Schwarz returned to Vienna where he was a leading baritone at the Vienna Volksoper from 1906 to 1909. He married Hannah Radon in 1907, divorcing her in 1908. He then worked as a principal artist at the Vienna State Opera (VSO) from 1909 to 1915; making his debut with the company as the Conte di Luna in Verdi's Il trovatore. His repertoire at the VSO included Le Comte de Nevers in Meyerbeer's Les Huguenots which he performed under the baton of Gustav Mahler. Some of the other roles in his repertoire included Germont in La traviata, Iago in Otello, Scarpia in Puccini's Tosca, Tonio in Leoncavallo's Pagliacci, Wolfram in Wagner's Tannhäuser, and the title role in Rigoletto.\nIn 1915 Schwarz left the VSO to become a resident artist at the Berlin State Opera where he remained committed until 1921. In Berlin he starred in the world premieres of Leo Blech's Rappelkopf (1917) and Franz Schmidt's Notre Dame (1918, as the Archdeacon). He also appeared as a guest artist with the Paris Opera and the Royal Swedish Opera, and performed in operas in Milan under conductor Arturo Toscanini.\n\nSchwarz left Germany for the United States where he was a principal artist with first the Chicago Opera Association and then its predecessor, the Chicago Civic Opera from 1921 to 1925. In 1922 he married Clara Sielcken in New York City; she was a German-born widow who had previously been married to the \"coffee king\" millionaire Hermann Sielcken. Clara was the daughter of sugar manufacturer Paul Isenberg. In 1924 he performed the role of Rigoletto at the Royal Opera House in London. In 1925 he gave a recital at the Salzburg Festival. On 12 January 1926, he starred as Hou in the United States premiere of Joseph Redding's Fay Yen Fah at the San Francisco Opera. His last performance was in the role of Rigoletto which he portrayed in Berlin shortly before his death in 1926.\nSchwarz battled alcoholism in his later career and his voice began to decline while working in Chicago. He developed a medical problem with his kidneys which required surgery in 1926. He died during that surgery in Berlin on 10 November 1926.\n\n\n== Recordings ==\nSchwarz made several recordings during his career, the first of which were released in 1906 by Zonophone. He made several phonograph cylinder recordings in 1907 in Vienna. In 1910–1911 he made several recordings released by Pathé Records. He also made records with Parlophone in Vienna in 1911 and in Berlin in 1913. From 1916 to 1919 he made several recordings with the Deutsche Grammophon label. A planned Christmas record for Vox Records was supposed to be recorded in 1926, the year of Schwarz's death, but never happened.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Anne Vétillard (1963 – 1 April 2024) was a French role-playing game creator and translator.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBorn in 1963, Vétillard was part of the first generation of role-players and publications on French role-playing games. She discovered one of the first role-playing games, Dungeons & Dragons, in 1977, the year it was first published, when the game had yet to be published or marketed in France. In 1986, she created the game Premières légendes : Légendes de la Table Ronde, a simplified version of Légendes. She also translated an expansion of the game Torg. She contributed to the magazine Casus Belli, where she wrote as an expert on J. R. R. Tolkien and live action role-playing games. She published many games throughout her career and translated the likes of Bushido, Conspiracy X, and Fading Suns into French.\nVétillard is best known for her works La Dame noire, Premières Légendes: Légendes de la Table Ronde, and the latter's supplement, Accessoires pour la Table Ronde. She was best known in the French- and English-speaking worlds for her games. She worked relentlessly to establish the role-playing game industry in France and was one of its first female personalities. She was one of the world's first women to write role-playing games. Her work on Tolkien focused on in-depth expansions of his ideas on Middle Earth while remaining true to Lord of the Rings canon. Additionally, she covered life-size role-playing games for Casus Belli, including Soirées Enquêtes (sorts of murder mystery games) and paintball.\nVétillard died on 1 April 2024.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nLa Dame Noire (1985)\nLégendes de la Table Ronde (1ères Légendes) (1986)\nThe GodNet (1991)\n\"Le Jeu de rôle Grandeur Nature\" (1992)\n\"Les Baronnies Rouges\" (1999)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Avalon assemblage was the first of the three Late Ediacaran biotic assemblages, spanning from c. 575 Ma to c. 560 Ma. It was followed by the White Sea assemblage, although temporal overlaps have been noted between the biotic assemblages. While earlier macroscopic fossils, mostly of algal origin, are known from the Lantian Formation, Avalon-type localities provide the first evidence of putative metazoan ancestors, as part of the Ediacaran biota.\n\n\n== Research history ==\nThe division of the Ediacaran biota in three separate assemblages was first postulated by Ben Waggoner in 2003.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nMost Avalonian fossil sites are known from the central United Kingdom and eastern Newfoundland, historically connected as part of the Avalonia microcontinent. Outside of Avalonia proper, other sites have been identified as part of the Avalon assemblage, such as the Olenek Uplift in Siberia, and Sekwi Brooke in the Northwest Territories of Canada.\n\n\n== Biota ==\nDeep-water rangeomorphs, and to a lesser extent arboreomorphs, dominated the Avalonian biota, although other macrofossil taxa are known. Certain clades typical of the Ediacaran biota, such as dipleurozoans, are not known from Avalon assemblage sites, but only appear in the more recent shallow-water White Sea assemblage. Nonetheless, the Avalon biota has been described as occupying the full range of morphologies that would later be present in the following assemblages.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Nama assemblage was the last of the Ediacaran biotic assemblages, following the Avalon and White Sea assemblages, and spanning from c. 550 Ma to c. 539 Ma. The assemblage was characterized by a faunal turnover, with the decline of the preexisting White Sea biota. The drop of diversity has been compared to the mass extinctions of the Phanerozoic. A second drop of diversity occurred at the Ediacaran–Cambrian boundary, concluding the Nama assemblages with the end-Ediacaran extinction.\n\n\n== Etymology and definition ==\nThe Nama assemblage is named after the Nama Group in Namibia, preserving a Late Ediacaran record of soft-bodied fossils. While the earliest fossils in the Nama Group, known from the Tsaus Mountains environment, date back to before 550.5 Ma, they represent holdover taxa from the earlier Avalon and White Sea assemblages. A proposed definition of the Nama assemblage's lower boundary by Wood et al. refers to the oldest appearance of Cloudina in the fossil record, placing the boundary at 550 Ma.\n\n\n== Paleohistory ==\nThe Nama assemblage is bounded from the earlier White Sea assemblage and later Cambrian period by two major episodes of faunal turnover, considered to be pulses of the end-Ediacaran extinction. Another decline in diversity has been also proposed around c. 545 Ma.\n\n\n== References ==",

Its studbook was created in 1906 and accepted numerous crosses from the beginning. Motorized farming threatened to exterminate the breed in the 1970s.\n\nHaving dwindled to 25 in 2015, it is considered a rare and endangered breed. Its preservation is the subject of publications and initiatives in Germany. The studbook still accepts crosses with other draft horse breeds, and a horse resulting from such a cross may be considered a Pfalz-ardener if it meets the breeding guidelines and one of its two parents is a Pfalz-ardener.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Pfalz-Ardenner is a relatively young breed, derived from the Ardennais, as its name suggests. In the DAD-IS database, this breed is listed as Pfalz-Ardenner Kaltblut.\nWhile the origins of the Ardennais can be traced back to the 17th century, the German breed is more specifically derived from various crosses between French and Belgian draft horses, undertaken at the beginning of the 20th century in southwest Germany.\nFrench Ardennais horses were the most important influence, but some Comtois were also crossed with Rhineland and Bavarian draft horses. Then, in 1896, a breeding cooperative was formed and ten years later, in 1906, a studbook was established based on imports of Ardennais horses from Alsace and Lorraine in France, with a small contribution of Bavarian horses.\nThe Pfalz-Ardenner studbook has always been very open, accepting a large number of horses in crossbreeding. With the motorization of farming, the breed was threatened with extinction in the 1970s.\nUntil the 2010s, the Pfalz-ardenner was never considered a breed in its own right. Since then, a handful of breeders in the Rhineland-Palatinate-Saarland region have dedicated themselves to its preservation.\n\n\n== Description ==\nCAB International and the Delachaux guide indicate an average height of 1.52 m to 1.62 m, which is according to the breed's studbook regulations. DAD-IS gives an average height of 1.57 m for females and 1.60 m for males. The weight is between 700 and 800 kg, making it a medium draught horse. However, this weight can increase to 1,000 kg. Life expectancy is about 25 years.\n\n\n=== Morphology and coat ===\n\nThe head is rather small, with a broad forehead and short ears. The chest is broad and the croup is muscular. The body should be of medium thickness for a draft horse, with a deep girth. The feet should be sturdy.\nAll colors are permitted, but the most common, according to the Delachaux guide, are bay, chestnut, black, gray, and roan. However, roan is not listed among the coats found in the breed's studbook (2015).\n\n\n=== Selection ===\nSince 2008, the studbook has officially accepted Ardennais, Breton, Comtois, South German, Rhineland, and Swedish Ardennais horses for crossbreeding, provided the other parent is a registered Pfalz-Ardenner.\nIf the crossbreed horse meets the breeding objectives, then it is registered in the studbook of its breed. The goal is to maintain the selection of a versatile, medium-weight draft horse. Subjects must be able to work in all three gaits and are tested for pulling ability, among other things.\nSelection is based on character, favoring horses that are gentle, versatile, well-balanced, and suitable for recreational activities.\nStallions can be approved for breeding at the age of three, subject to evaluation. The same applies to mares. Horses belonging to the breed have a suffix to their name that is specific to the breeding farm of origin.\n\n\n== Uses ==\nIn the past, the breed was valued for its versatility. The breed was originally intended for use in agriculture and as a skidding horse, but motorization has greatly reduced these activities.\nCombined driving, skidding (and other agricultural and forestry work), and pleasure riding are the uses of the Pfalz-ardenner today. It can still be used in heavy traction work, but it is also bred for meat production.\n\n\n== Breeding dissemination ==\nThe Pfalz-Ardenner is bred primarily in southwestern Germany, in the Rhineland-Palatinate.\nIn 2015, the registered population was extremely small, with 25 animals, including 22 mares and 3 stallions.\nThe breed is listed as endangered by DAD-IS (2018) and it is on the Red List of endangered indigenous breeds in Germany (Rote Liste der bedrohten einheimischen Nutztierrassen). Locally it is classified as an \"endangered population\" (Phänotypische Erhaltungspopulation: vom Aussterben bedroht) because there are less than 50 individuals.\nDespite these very low numbers, the situation of the Pfalz-Ardenner is actively monitored in Germany, with H. Haring stating in 2005 that \"the conservation of this breed group (German draft horses) can be considered secured\".\nTaking into account crossbreeds, the Pfalz-Ardenner breeding population in the cradle of breeding in 2015 was about 60 mares and 8 stallions. This breed is also eligible for financial aid for the preservation of endangered breeds (2015).\nSo, the breeding context for draft horses is generally moving towards a recovery in numbers.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nHerold, Peter; Jung, Jutta; Scharnhölz, Reinhard (2009).

At sixteen he left Dedham school to study anatomy and surgery under Philip Meadows Martineau of Norwich, and removed in 1800 to the university of Edinburgh. There he attended the lectures of Dugald Stewart on moral philosophy, of John Robison on natural philosophy, of James Gregory on medicine, of Thomas Charles Hope on chemistry. He associated with Henry Brougham, Francis Horner, and Sydney Smith; was elected in November 1802 a member of the Speculative Society, of which they were the moving spirits; and contributed to early numbers of the ‘Edinburgh Review’ articles on ‘Population’ and on Pinel's ‘Treatment of the Insane.’ He was president of the Royal Medical Society in 1802–3, graduating M.D. in the latter year, for which occasion he wrote a thesis entitled ‘De Animalibus in hyeme sopitis.’\nRemoving to London to continue his studies, he frequented the house of Anna Laetitia Barbauld and Dr. John Aikin, formed a friendship with Sir Humphry Davy, met Sir Joseph Banks, Isaac D'Israeli, and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. In conjunction with Dr. Thomas Bateman, he founded, in 1805, the ‘Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal,’ to which he sent frequent communications. In 1805 he started on a foreign tour, spent some months at Neuchâtel, traversed Switzerland, and ventured, with an American passport, on French territory at Geneva. Reaching Vienna on 30 September, he was there an eye-witness of the scenes that followed Austerlitz (5 December), saw Napoleon at Schönbrunn, heard Girolamo Crescentini sing, had an interview with Joseph Haydn, and was present when Beethoven, ‘a small, dark, young-looking man,’ directed a performance of ‘Fidelio.’ At Berlin, moreover, in the spring of 1806, he became acquainted with Martin Heinrich Klaproth and Alexander von Humboldt, and was among the auditors of Johann Gottlieb Fichte.\nShortly after his return to England he settled at Norwich, and pursued his profession with energy and success. He was admitted, on 12 February 1807, an extra-licentiate of the College of Physicians, and was elected physician to the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital, and to the lunatic asylum. But an obscure disease cut short his promising career. He died at his father's house at Hadleigh on 27 September 1814, aged 34. A tablet inscribed to his memory was placed by his widow in the Octagon Chapel at Norwich. A paper by him on ‘Cretinism’ was read before the Royal Society on 11 February 1808 (Phil. Trans. xcviii. 111), and he published at London in 1809 an essay ‘On the Torpidity of Animals.’ His ‘Journal of a Residence at Vienna and Berlin in the eventful Winter 1805–6’ was published by his son in 1877. The journal of his preceding Swiss tour remains in manuscript.\nHe married, in 1807, Susan, eldest daughter of John Taylor of Norwich, one of that family by whom, according to the Duke of Sussex, the saying was invented that ‘it takes nine tailors to make a man.’ Mrs. Reeve was a sister of Sarah Austin, and died in 1864, having survived her husband fifty years. Of his three children two died in infancy; the third, Henry, is separately noticed.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Clerke, Agnes Mary (1896). \"Reeve, Henry (1780-1814)\".

        "content": "St Michael and All Angels’ Church, Stanton-by-Dale is a Grade II* listed parish church in the Church of England in Stanton by Dale, Derbyshire.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe church was in early days given to Dale Abbey and served by the Canons of Dale.\nThe church was rebuilt or perhaps considerably restored circa 1320 in the decorated gothic style of architecture. The three light east window of the chancel and the three light south chancel window date from this period. The tower dates from perhaps 1475 or slightly later.\nIt is mentioned in the Valor Ecclesiasticus of 1552 which records Stanton juxta Dale Jo Cadman clerke j chalys of silver parcell guylt ij bells in the steple j hand belle j sacryng bell iij vestments whereof j of blew silk ij of whyte crule iij albes ij alter clothez ij towells ij cruets pewter j byble j boke of mynystracon.After the dissolution of the monasteries, most of the property of Dale Abbey was granted to the Babingtons and it was later purchased by Michael Willoughby of Risley during the second half of the sixteenth century.\nIn 1652 Sir Henry Willoughby Baronet gave all the hay tithe of Stanton by Dale to the church which enabled the ministers to be regarded as Vicars. In 1702 the great tithes were restored to the church and the ministers then were given the title of Rector.\nIn 1872-73 the church was restored and repaired at a cost of £1,600. The chancel was lengthened by 3 feet (0.91 m) and the north aisle widened and lengthened by about 3 feet (0.91 m). The roofs were replaced and the exterior walls were all rebuilt.\n\n\n== Organ ==\nThe church contains an 2 manual and pedal 15 stop pipe organ by Brindley & Foster of the 1880s. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.\n\n\n== Bells ==\nThe church has 8 bells equipped for change ringing. The lowest five bells date from 1872 and are by John Taylor and Co of Loughborough. The 3rd is by the same firm but dates from 1900. The treble and 2nd bell date from 1972 and were cast at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGrade II* listed buildings in Erewash\nListed buildings in Stanton by Dale\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The ANT case (also AST case) was a resonance criminal case in early 1990s  about an alleged attempt of smuggling of T-72 tanks abroad by the cooperative ANT (Russian: \"АНТ\": Автоматика, Наука, Технология, translated as AST: \"Automation. Science. Technology\"). On January 11, 1990, the tarpaulin-covered tanks on twelve platforms were found on the access railroads at the Novorossiysk station declared as tractors in the accompanying documents. The cooperative was set up under the patronage of KGB. The investigations quickly sizzled. There were rumors and some evidence about involvement of high KGB officials: ANT was given significant rights for import and export without any licensing. The chairman of ANT, Vladimir Ryashentsev, escaped to the United States, where he engaged in commerce. In 1993 the investigation was discontinued and apologies were issued to Ryashentsev, but he did not return.\nOn October 15, 1991, Russian TV aired two interviews: one with the investigators, another one was with Ryahentsev in his Budapest office of Rossiysky Dom (\"Russian House\") set up after the closure of ANT. There Ryashentsev presented the documents about the order for the refurbishment of tanks as tractors, but somehow they were shipped with no work done. However the investigators claimed (and provided proofs) that Ryashentsev knew that they were actual tanks. Later Ryahentsev suggested that it was a provocation targeting reforms of Ryzhkov and Gorbachev. The latter claim (anti-Gorbachev's reforms conspiracy) was also voiced by other media.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Stockly is a French software company that provides a shared inventory management platform for e-commerce companies. Founded in 2018 by Eliott Jabès and Oscar Walter, the company is headquartered in Paris.\n\n\n== History ==\nEliott Jabès and Oscar Walter met while studying at the Henri IV prep school in Paris. They decided to create Stockly with the aim of making inventory a commodity by building a stock-exchange that allows e-commerce players to sell products they do not physically own.\nIn 2018, Stockly secured its first round of funding, raising 1 million euros. The same year, the company was selected to participate in the accelerator programs of Plug&Play and Techstars.\nIn May 2019, Stockly won the SCOPS trophies of the Distribution and Customer Relationship Master of Paris Dauphine.\nIn October 2020, Stockly was selected among the startups in the \"Retail and Customer Experience\" cohort of the SAP.iO Foundry Paris acceleration program by SAP. The company also appeared on the \"100 Companies to Invest in 2020\" selection by Challenges magazine.\nIn March 2021, Stockly raised 5.1 million euros in a seed round, primarily from Eurazeo and Daphni funds. The following month, co-founders Oscar Walter and Eliott Jabès were awarded a place on the \"30 under 30\" list by Forbes.\nIn September 2022, Stockly raised an additional 12 million euros, mainly from Eurazeo and Daphni. The same year, the company announced that it had reached 100 million products managed in its virtual warehouse.\n\n\n== Functioning ==\nStockly's platform connects online inventories, enabling e-commerce merchants to continue selling even when they are out of stock by having the product shipped by another seller within the network. The network consists of several partners, including brands, retailers, multi-brand stores, and distribution networks, who send the missing product under white-label packaging. For the end consumer, the process is seamless, as they place an order on the website where they intend to purchase the item. In the background, Stockly monitors available product inventories and matches them with products before a stockout occurs.\n\n\n== Partnerships ==\nStockly has established partnerships with several companies in the retail and commerce field, including Yoox, Worten, C Discount, Inno.be, Conforama, Miravia, Worten, Galeries Lafayette, Carrefour, Alltricks, and Jonak.\n\n\n== References ==",

One of ten officers in 1957, he underwent military training abroad while pursuing studies in Italy, alongside figures like General Aideed and Abdullahi Yusuf, all of whom would later play significant roles in the country's history.\nLeading the Hiraan front, he commanded a unit of the Somali National Army in Ethiopia during the 1964 Ethiopian-Somali border conflict, ultimately receiving the highest military decorations for his service in defence of the nation. Notably, his actions in capturing and eliminating over 200 Ethiopian soldiers during the war drew the attention of Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie. He later participated in the Ogaden War, commanding the Godey front and playing a pivotal role in the JigJiga theater.\nHe was also known for openly challenging then-President Mohammed Siad Barre, tensions between the two escalated during a meeting summoned by Barre in the midst of the Ogaden conflict, where Elmi's refusal to comply with Barre's directives led to a contentious exchange. Following Elmi's muttered comment of 'What a brutal dictator,' Barre demanded he retract his statement, eventually ordering Elmi to “go take yourself to prison”.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nCategory:Somalian military personnel",

        "content": "Eddie Lawrence Sinnott (February 24, 1954 – February 20, 2024) was an American All-American competition swimmer for Southern Methodist University, who coached the Southern Methodist swim team for thirty years from 1989 to 2019, leading them to 16 league crowns and 11 top NCAA Division 1 finishes.\nSinnott was born in Greenwich, CT on February 24, 1954, to Anita and Lawrence Sinnott, one of eight siblings.  Along with several of his siblings, he attended St. Mary's High School in Greenwich.  He held many state and local swimming records during his High School years but competed for the Stamford, Connecticut Swim Club.  He excelled in swimming and could compete in all four strokes, but played other sports as well.\n\n\n== Early sports and swimming ==\nAt the Connecticut Long Course Junior Swimming Championship in New London on July 15, 1971, swimming for the Stamford, Connecticut Dolphins Swim Club, Sinnott demonstrated diverse stroke skills, swimming a 1:07.9 for the Boys' 110-yard backstroke, and a 2:28.0 in the 220-yard medley in the 15-17 age group.   By 1972, he had distinguished himself as a High School All American, placing third in the 200 freestyle at the AAU Metropolitan Championships in Roslyn, Long Island in July, 1972.  In the summer Sinnott played softball, and was a very capable hitter, knocking in 17 runs while hitting three home runs as a sixteen year old in the Saugerties Softball League playoffs.\nHelping his Stamford Dolphins Swim Club win the meet on points, Sinnott won both the 400 freestyle and the 200 Individual Medley at the Region 1 AAU Long Course Swimming Championships in Princeton, New Jersey on July 21, 1970.  By winning the regional meet, the Dolphins and Sinnott advanced to the Eastern Championships.  Again swimming for the Dolphin Swim Club of Stamford, Connecticut, Sinnott placed third in the 400-meter individual medley at the Eastern USA Swimming Championships on August 7, 1971.\n\n\n== Swimming for SMU ==\nSwimming at SMU from 1972 to 1976, he earned All-America honors in 1973 and 1974, was a four-time letter winner, and in 1973 captured the Southwest Conference Championship in the 400 IM.  Sinnott graduated SMU in 1979 with a degree in Physical Education.  \nBy his Junior year, Sinnott was an All-American specializing in backstroke but missed much of the 1975 season recovering from an appendicitis.  On July 9, 1974, swimming for the Dolphin Swim Club in an AAU meet in New London, Connecticut that summer while away from SMU, Sinnott placed third in the 220-yard freestyle, and the 100-yard backstroke, and third again in the 110-yard butterfly, though swimmers from Yale dominated the meet.  By 1975, Sinnott's Junior year, SMU, then an established power, had won 18 straight Southwest Conference Titles,  won the SWC and Houston Invitationals, defeated Oklahoma, Texas Christian, the University of Miami, and were favored to beat the University of Texas.  The team had an exceptional record under Coach George McMillion that year.  Sinnott's ability to compete in multiple strokes including the individual medley made him more valuable to some future employers as a potential swim coach.\n\n\n== Coaching ==\nGaining valuable experience, Sinnott was an Assistant Coach at SMU from around 1980 to 1985 while the team finished in the top ten in the NCAA tournament in each of the years he was a staff member.  In a very early coaching position, he assistant coached both the Men's and Women's swim teams at Louisiana State University from 1985 to 1988.  In 1988, he coached LSU when they were winners of the Southeastern Conference Title.  Sinnott replaced Bob Groseth as Head Coach at Iowa State in May 1988, but did not hold the position for long. \nTaking the position as Head Coach at SMU the following year, from 1989 to 2019, his teams won 16 conference championships, consisting of four WAC Championships from 1997 to 2000, five in the NIC conference from 2001 to 2005, and seven in Conference-USA from 2006 to 2010, and 2012 to 2013.  He had 16 Coach of the year honors including 3 with the Southwestern Conference, 3 with the Western Athletic Conference, 3 with the NIC conference, 6 with Conference-USA, and 1 with the Big 8 Conference.\nThe 1990s were the peak of SMU swimming performance for Sinnott, as the Mustangs finished in the top 10 at the NCAAs every year from 1991 through 1998.\nIn his most distinctive honor, Sinnott was a recipient of the 2019 National Collegiate Scholastic Trophy in 2019 by a vote of his swimming community peers. Presented by the CSCAA and the National Interscholastic Swimming Coaches Association (NISCA), the trophy is awarded to the coach \"who has made the greatest contribution to swimming as a competitive sport, and as a healthful, recreational activity in the province of undergraduate and scholastic education\".\n\n\n=== Olympic swimmers coached ===\nSinnott coached 11 Olympic athletes at 7 Olympic Games.\nIn 1996, Sinnott coached SMU swimmer Ryan Berube to a gold medal as a team member of the U.S.A. 4×200 free relay team. In the summer of 2000, Lars Frolander became the fourth SMU swimmer to capture a gold medal at the Olympic Games, winning the 100 butterfly in Sydney, Australia. During Sinnott's coaching tenure, both Berube and Frolander were recipients of the NCAA Swimmer of the Year award within two years, with Berube receiving the award in 1996, and Frolander in 1998.  Sinnott also coached Slovakian swimmer Martina Moravcová at SMU, who competed for Slovakia in five consecutive summer Olympics from 1992 to 2008 and won the Honda Sports Award as the nation's top female swimmer in 1999.\n\n\n=== Swimming community ===\nSinnott served as head coach of the U.S. National Team in 1987 during its European Tour, and was the U.S. Olympic Team assistant manager during the 2008 Olympics. In addition to working as a U.S. Coach, Sinnott worked for the Olympic International Organizing Committee from 1984 to 1992. He was the head coach for Haiti at the 1996 Olympic Games and was Assistant Coach for Colombia, Denmark and South Africa at the World Short Course Championships.  Sinnott also helped raise funds for the new Robson & Lindley Aquatics Center at SMU and the Barr-McMillion Natatorium.\nAfter coaching retirement, Eddie and wife Sioux relocated to Stover, Missouri to spend more time with family. The couple gravitated toward The Dale Hollow Winery, gaining a greater sense of community and friendship. Eddie expanded his friendships, volunteered, and found new hobbies in his retirement. He fought melanoma skin cancer in his final years, and died on February 20, 2024, in Stover among friends and family. He was a few days shy of his 70th birthday.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Private schools are a type of K-12 educational institution in the Canadian province of Alberta, which are overseen and funded by the Government of Alberta. Tuition limits are not set by the government, and private schools do not receive funding for transportation or optional charges such as uniform and specialized curriculum activities.\nIn the 2023–24 school year, approximately 45,477 students attended a private school, or around 5.68 per cent of the total student population.\nAs of April 2024, there are 166 private school authorities in Alberta who operate a total of 222 schools.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1946, the Social Credit Party government under the leadership of Ernest Manning recognized the creation of private schools with legislative changes to the provincial Education Act. Lobbied heavily by religious and conservative groups - primarily Dutch neo-Calvinists in the Christian Action Foundation, the Societies for Christian Education, and the Association of Private Schools and Colleges in Alberta (APSCA) - the Government of Alberta began providing public funding to private schools in 1967, starting at $100 per student. Further changes in 1974-76 under Peter Lougheed's Progressive Conservative government increased per-student funding to 33 per cent of what public schools received, then 40 per cent.\nFollowing the election of Ralph Klein in 1992, a notable difference in messaging and justification for private school funding emerged which centred on \"parent choice\". Klein's government soon introduced charter schools legislation, and in April 1997 a private member bill sponsored by PC MLA Carol Louise Haley and supported by then-provincial treasurer Stockwell Day, seeking a $14 million increase to annual funding of private schools, was brought forward. Per-student funding was increased to 60 per cent of what public schools received by 1998, while the public school system saw wages cut for teachers, funding cuts, repealed education regulations, the centralization of school boards, and the elimination of taxation powers for schools to raise revenue on their own.\nThis situation was detested by workers in the education system and the public in general and pressure built gradually in the following years, eventually culminating in the 2002 Alberta teachers' strike. At its peak, 22,000 teachers out of a total 32,000 were on strike by February, affecting around 357,000 students out of a total 550,000.\nFollowing unsuccessful back to work orders in February, Minister of Learning and Education Lyle Oberg declared a public emergency. The Klein government in collusion with the Alberta School Boards' Association agreed to pass Bill 12, the Education Services Settlement Act (ESSA) on March 14, 2002, in response to the strike, which was widely seen as a betrayal to teachers and an illegal and draconian piece of legislation. The ESSA imposed a wage settlement arbitration process on teachers and made it nearly impossible to appeal this process or its results in court; gave the government permission to remove the right to strike or lockout; forbade teachers from engaging in slowdowns or diminishing their job duties; broadened the term 'strike' to include two or more teachers acting together to refuse to perform assigned responsibilities; and established severe penalties for any non-compliance. Larry Booi, the Alberta Teachers' Association (ATA) President, responded to the legislation by stating \"This is a black day for public education and for democracy in Alberta. This government has made a terrible decision, and we all shall have to live with the consequences\".\nThough the strike ended, the private school system has grown in size and in funding under Progressive Conservative governments, which formed the provincial government continuously between 1971 and 2015. At the initiative of Ed Stelmach's government in 2008, per-student funding rose to 70 per cent of that received by public schools (equivalent to around $5,200 per student), and remains at this rate today.\n\n\n== Private schools and private school authorities in Alberta ==\nThese are classified by the Government into 3 different types and 2 special designations:\n\nRegistered private schools: registered under Section 29(1) of the Education Act; must meet requirements outlined by the Act and in sections (2), (3), (4), (5), and (21) in the Private Schools Regulation. They are ineligible for government funding and although not required to use certificated teachers or teach the Alberta curriculum, are required to maintain a list of subjects, skills, and knowledge areas.\nAccredited private schools (non funded): registered under Section 29(2) of the Education Act; must meet the requirements of a registered private school and the additional Private Schools Regulation requirements under sections (6), (8), (9), and (10). They must use certificated teachers, but are not required to teach the Alberta curriculum.\nAccredited funded private schools: funded by the government through the Education Grants Regulation; must meet additional Private Schools Regulation requirements under sections (7), (12), (13), (14), (15), (16), (17), (18), (19), and (20). They are required to use certificated teachers, must teach the Alberta curriculum, and must have a principal who is also a certificated teacher.\nDesignated special education private schools: funded by the government; given special approval and funding by the Minister of Education for the purpose of serving students identifying with mild, moderate, or severe disabilities, and must meet the additional requirements under section (11) of the Private Schools Regulation.\nHeritage language schools: offers approved language and culture courses outside of regular school hours to students who already have basic education needs met at another school authority; if funding is granted, a principal must be a certificated teacher and audited financial statements are required.\nAs of April 2024, there are 166 private school authorities operating 222 schools in Alberta: \n\n\n== References ==",

A critic from News18 gave the film the same rating and wrote that \"Silence 2 definitely deserves a watch if you like murder mysteries. And as always, Manoj Bajpayee is at his finest. It’s worth a watch despite the flaws\". A critic from TimesNow gave the film the same rating and wrote that \"there was real potential and promise in Silence 2: The Night Owl Bar Shootout to build something interesting. But the red herrings grow tiresome and the final reveal, in which the antagonist basically reveal all their intentions, drags the story and the film by a good 20 minutes or so\".\nA critic from Pinkvilla rated the film two out of five stars and wrote that \"Silence 2 is a long and tiring watch that simply fails to connect. The performances also fail to match the level of a no-nonsense investigative-thriller\". A critic from Outlook rated the film one-and-a-half out of five stars and wrote that \"The only good part about Silence 2: The Night Owl Bar Shootout is the camera work. The camera work is smooth, and it keeps your attention in this poorly written whodunit\".\nIn a review for India Today, Zinia Bandyopadhyay wrote that, in particular because of its dialogues, the film \"fails to impress as a crime thriller despite its potential\". Arjun Agarwal, of Medium, stated, \"The film throws some twists and turns your way, some predictable, some genuinely surprising. There’s a sense of wanting to be constantly surprised, but a few reveals lack the punch needed to leave you gasping.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSilence 2: The Night Owl Bar Shootout at IMDb \nSilence 2 official page",

        "content": "Richard Reece (1775 – 26 September 1831) was an English physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nReece was born in 1775. He was the third and youngest son of William Reece (died 1781), vicar of Bosbury, rector of Coddington, and curate of Colwall in Herefordshire, by Elizabeth Anna Mackafee, lady of the manor of Battleborough, Somerset. Early devoting himself to the profession of medicine, Richard was at the age of twenty resident surgeon at the Hereford Infirmary. He became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England in 1796, and from 1797 to 1808 he practised in Chepstow and Cardiff. The Royal Humane Society in 1799 bestowed its silver medal upon him ‘for his medical services in the cause of humanity vitam ob restitutam’ (sic), and he afterwards entered its service as a medical assistant. He was living in London in 1812, and he subsequently graduated M.D., but it is not known from what university. He secured considerable practice in London, and was consulted by Joanna Southcott, who was then aged 64, as to the possibility of her supernatural pregnancy. He seems to have given a guarded diagnosis, which he had an opportunity of converting into a certain one, for he assisted at her autopsy when she died on 27 December 1814.\nReece led an active life, and, in addition to his practice, interested himself in therapeutic and chemical pursuits at a time when these studies were but little considered. His knowledge of the medicinal properties of plants enabled him to introduce several new drugs into general use. He died on 26 September 1831, and is buried in St. George's burial-ground, Bayswater Road, London. He married Kitty Blackborow, a daughter of Judge Blackborow.\nReece published: \n\n‘The Medical Guide, for the use of the Clergy, Heads of Families, and Practitioners in Medicine and Surgery,’ &c., London, 8vo; 1st ed. 1802, 17th ed. 1850; an attempt to place before the public the rational treatment of disease when far removed from skilled assistance, and the steps to be taken in cases of accidents, emergency, and sudden illness.\n‘Observations on the Anti-Phthisical Properties of Lichen Islandicus, or Iceland Moss,’ London, 8vo, 1803.\n‘Practical Observations on Radix Rhataniæ,’ London, 8vo, 1808.\n‘A Practical Dictionary of Domestic Medicine,’ &c., London, 8vo, 1808.\n‘Letters addressed to Mic. G. Prendergast on the present State of Medicine in great Britain,’ &c., London, 8vo, 1810.\n‘The Reecean Pandect of Medicine,’ &c., London, royal 8vo, 1812.\n‘The Chemical Guide,’ London, 8vo, 1814.\n‘Statement of the last Illness and Death of Mrs. [Joanna] Southcott, with the Appearances on Dissection,’ &c., 8vo, London, 1815.\n‘A Practical Treatise on the Beneficial Effect of the Gratiola Officinalis in Nervous and Organic Diseases of the Lungs,’ &c., London, 8vo, 1818.\n‘A Practical Treatise on Diseases of the Genital System, the Rectum … with an Account of the Diosma Crenata or Buchu Leaves,’ &c., London, 8vo, 1825.\n‘A Practical Dissertation on the Means of obviating and treating the Varieties of Costiveness,’ &c., London, 8vo, 1826; 2nd edit. 1827.\n‘The Lady's Medical Guide,’ &c., 16mo, 1833.\n‘A Practical Treatise on the Anti-Asthmatic Properties of the Bladder-podded Lobelia … to which is added an Account of the Chirayito Herb,’ London; 2nd edit. 1830. Reece also edited the ‘Monthly Gazette of Practical Medicine,’ 1816–31, and the ‘Medical Annual.’\nA miniature in oils, by R. Bull, belonged to Dr. A. J. Richardson of West Brighton. It was engraved.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Power, D'Arcy (1896). \"Reece, Richard\". In Lee, Sidney (ed.).

        "content": "Zarakh Iliev (Russian: Зарах Бинсионович Илиев, born 8 September 1966) is a Russian–Azerbaijani billionaire property developer and co-owner of the Kievskaya Ploshchad. As of early March 2024, Forbes estimated his fortune to be $3.3 billion. Iliev is one of the wealthiest people in Russia and ranks 1027th in the ranking of the wealthiest people on the planet.\nIn 1992 Zarakh Iliev and his compatriot God Nisanov founded the Kievskaya Ploshchad Group of Companies. As of 2024, Kievskaya Ploshchad owns commercial, office, warehouse, and hotel real estate in Moscow, and Flotilla Radisson Royal on the Moskva River. Among its largest assets are the Sadovod market, the agricultural cluster Food City, Hotel Ukraina, the food court Depo, and the Olympic Stadium. According to Forbes and RBK, Kievskaya Ploshchad ranks among Russia's 100 largest private companies. It is also the most significant player in the Russian commercial property market. \nZarakh Iliev is known for his close connections with the Russian and Azerbaijani political elite. Ilham Rahimov, a former fellow student of Vladimir Putin, holds shares in many of Kievskaya Ploshchad's projects. \nFollowing the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the USA, the UK, and Ukraine placed Iliev on the sanction lists.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nZarakh Iliev was born on 8 September 1966 in the village of Krasnaya Sloboda in the Azerbaijan SSR. The place is also known as the \"Caucasian Jerusalem\" as it is the only settlement  of Mountain Jews in the post-Soviet space. They even have a unique language, Judeo-Tat, that is distinct to their community. Iliev's father, Binsion Iliev, was a shoemaker, while the mother was a housewife. Besides Zarakh, the family also had five other children – three sons and two daughters. From childhood, Binsion Iliev had been teaching them the craft of shoemaking. In his youth years, Zarakh Iliev created a small business in his native village Krasnaya Sloboda, making headgear and selling it in the neighboring city of Quba.\nAt the age of 17 Iliev moved to Moscow. There, together with his compatriot God Nisanov, he started wholesaling at the Cherkizovsky Market. In 1992 Iliev and Nisanov founded the Kievskaya Ploshchad Group of Companies, which focused on property development. Iliev's friendship with the market owner Telman Ismailov only facilitated the business.\n\n\n== Kievskaya Ploshchad ==\nAmong Kievskaya Ploshchad's first projects were the shopping centers Elektronny Ray, Panorama, Grand, as well as the auto center Moskva. In 2005, the company made a significant acquisition by obtaining one of the Stalinist skyscrapers known as the Hotel Ukraina, which was later renamed Radisson Collection after undergoing reconstruction.\n2009 marked the closure of the Cherkizovsky Market,  where Iliev and Nisanov were junior partners of Telman Ismailov. However, their business only flourished since they began actively developing their project — the largest goods market in Moscow, Sadovod, which Iliev and Nisanov have owned since 2003.  In the same year of 2009, Kievskaya Ploshchad opened the 8-story shopping and entertainment center Evropeyskiy, located near with the Moscow Kiyevsky railway station. Additionally,  Iliev and Nisanov launched the Radisson Royal flotilla on the Moskva River.\nIn 2014 the agrocluster Food City,  covering more than 120 hectares, was opened. In 2015, the Moskvarium, an Oceanography and Marine Biology Center, was opened at the Exhibition of Achievements of National Economy, becoming the largest educational center with an aquarium in Europe.\nIn 2017 the company purchased the Olympic Stadium from the Alliance Group.\nIn the spring of 2019 Kievskaya Ploshchad opened the food court Depo near the Belorusskaya metro station.\nIn September 2021 Kievskaya Ploshchad acquired a 9.8% stake in Samolet, one of the largest mass housing developers in Russia. In 2023, Samolet announced it would develop 28.4 hectares of residential and commercial real estate in the Vostochnoe Biryulevo area. That land previously belonged to the Emeral market, also owned by Kievskaya Ploshchad.\nKievskaya Ploshchad is among the top hundred in Forbes' ranking of the \"200 largest private companies in Russia,\" ranking 65th in the latest 2021 list. It reported a revenue of 160 billion rubles (more than $2 billion). In 2024, Kievskaya Ploshchad claimed the top position in the Forbes ranking of \"Kings of Russian Real Estate,\" with a reported rental income of $1.7 billion.\nThe Sadovod market and the agrocluster Food City are widely known for their large-scale illegal cash turnover. Sadovod has long been the most significant center in Moscow for cryptocurrency transactions. The stability of Kievskaya Ploshchad's business is manifested through close ties with high-ranking Russian officials, including Sergey Naryshkin, the director of the Foreign Intelligence Service, Dmitry Rogozin, the former head of Roscosmos, and Sergey Sobyanin, the Mayor of Moscow. Iliev and Nisanov's key partner is Ilham Rahimov, who is also Vladimir Putin's former classmate.\n\n\n== Fortune ==\nZarakh Iliev has been one of the wealthiest people in Russia for two decades, ranking 71st in the list of the richest people in 2005 with an estimated fortune of $400 million. In the 2023 ranking, he held the 43rd position with a fortune of $2.7 billion. As of March 2024, global Forbes estimated his fortune to be $3.3 billion.\n\n\n== Sanctions ==\nOn 26 September 2022, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Iliev was added to the UK's sanction lists. This action was taken in response to the Russian regime's conduct of 'fake referendums,' indicating Iliev's support or benefit from the Russian government. It was noted that \"Putin continues to rely on a clique of oligarchs and selected representatives of the elite to finance his war.\" \nOn 19 October 2022 Iliev was included in Ukraine's sanctions list on the ground of \"providing a significant source of income for the government of Russia, which initiated military actions and genocide against the civilian population in Ukraine.\" On 12 December 2023, he was included in the US sanctions list. Iliev was seen as \"providing a significant source of income for the government of Russia, which initiated military actions and genocide against the civilian population in Ukraine.\" The U.S. sanctions affected Kievskaya Ploshchad and all the affiliated organizations in which the parent structure, Iliev, or Nisanov, directly or indirectly own a stake of 50% or more.\n\n\n== Philanthropy and public activities ==\nIliev donated to several charity organizations, including Liniya Zhizni (Russian: Линия Жизни), Podari Zhizn (Russian: Подари Жизнь), Bumagniy Guravlik (Russian: Бумажный Журавлик), Kray Dobra (Russian: Край Добра), and Oxana Fedorova's charity foundation. Iliev's donations have funded the renovation of the interior of the temple at the artistic and production enterprise Sofrino. He has also made charitable contributions to the Dynamo Sports Club, renovated the cafeteria at Moscow State University, and facilities at the Petrovskaya Academy of Sciences and Arts. Together with Nisanov, they funded the construction of a sports complex for students of the Saint Petersburg State Marine Technical University.\nZarakh Iliev is a prominent figure in the Russian Jewish community and the mountain Jewish diaspora in Moscow. In 2014, together with God Nisanov, they invested in the construction of the Jewish school Cheder Menahem in Moscow. They also initiated the opening of the Community Center for the Association of Mountain Jews of Moscow in 2019. Iliev and Nisanov also provide assistance to their native village of Krasnaya Sloboda. In 2020, they contributed to the opening of the world's first Museum of Mountain Jews in the village.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nIn 2015 Iliev's contribution was recognized with the Skripach na Kryshe award by the Federation of Jewish Communities of Russia in the category of \"Charity.\" Additionally, in the same year, Iliev was awarded the title of Honorary Builder of Russia.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nZarakh Iliev is married and has two sons: Ben-Zion and Vadim. \nIliev purchased \"golden passports\" from the Dominican Republic to bypass Western sanctions for himself, his sons, and three other relatives. According to Al Jazeera, in 2018, Iliev could have obtained a \"golden passport\" from Cyprus as well.\nIliev is interested in painting and also enjoys fishing. Along with the Hotel Ukraina, Iliev and Nisanov acquired a collection of 1,200 socialist realism paintings. These paintings were part of the acquisition, and included the works by Aleksandr Deyneka, Aristarkh Lentulov, Dmitry Nalbandyan, Nikolai Romadin, Mikhail Suzdaltsev, the collective of Kukryniksy, and other artists. These paintings were restored with the entrepreneurs' personal funds. Iliev's personal office is also located at the Hotel Ukraina. \nIliev also holds several patents for inventions, including a patent for the rotating logo of the shopping and entertainment center Evropeyskiy.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nZarakh Iliev profile, Forbes",

        "content": "The Workers' Party (PT), named the Independent Democratic Workers' Party (POID) until 2023, is a French far-left political party led by Daniel Gluckstein. It was founded in 2015 following a split with the Independent Workers' Party (POI).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Democratic Independent Workers' Party (POID) emerged from a split  from the Independent Workers' Party (POI) in 2015. This was after disagreeing with the majority decisions of its current executive. After having announced that he wanted to create a trend supported by more than 700 members of the Internationalist Communist Current (CCI) and entitled \"Return to a policy of party building\", Daniel Gluckstein was suspended from the POI, as well as the other members of the leadership national who supported him. The national office removed Gluckstein as well as Gérard Schivardi and Jean Markun from their mandates as national secretaries.\nAt the end of two separate congresses held on 21 and 22 November 2015, the movement launched by Daniel Gluckstein decided to form itself as a new party named the \"Independent Democratic Workers' Party\". Gérard Schivardi, Daniel Gluckstein and Jean Markun, the three national secretaries of the POI (Claude Jenet having died at the time of the split), became its national secretaries.\nThe POID declares itself internationalist and gives its motto \"For socialism, the Republic and democracy\". The party claimed nearly 2,900 members in 2022. Its weekly newspaper is La Tribune des Travailleurs, which aims to be a \"free forum for the class struggle\". It claims nearly 7,000 subscribers in June 2023.\n\nThe POID aims to continue the activity of the original POI. The party platform indicates:\"The Independent Workers' Party was founded in 2008. Its acronym was confiscated by a fraction of its national office which, in 2015, decided both to give up building it as a party and to expel all of its secretaries nationals, half of the national office. Its continuity today is that of the Independent Democratic Workers' Party\"The party platform also stands for:\n\"For socialism\", because it aims to put an end to the regime of private ownership of the major means of production and exchange and to replace it with their socialization.\n\"For the Republic\" one, indivisible and secular, heir to the French Revolution, founded on the existence of more than 36,750 communes and departments and on the separation of Church and State.\n\"For democracy\", because the emancipation of workers requires the right to free trade union and political organization, the foundation of democracy. This political democracy relies on elected officials, representatives of the people and mandated by them.\nWithin the party there is a \"Trotskyist\" current of the Fourth International (ICR).\nThe POID is part of the International Workers' Committee, whose last world conference in October 2022 brought together representatives from 43 countries.\nIn December 2023, the POID changed its name to the Workers' Party, in order to distinguish itself from the POI which had campaigned for La France insoumise in 2022. It took the name of the party which preceded the POI, founded in 1991.\n\n\n== Political positions ==\n\nThe POID participated in the organization of a movement titled \"For the lifting of the state of emergency\", on Saturday January 23, 2016. It intends to bring together 1,500 participants at a meeting during which many political and union leaders spoke and organised.\nThe POID organized a meeting on 28 May 2016 in support of Brexit in the runup to the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, with the participation of workers from different European countries.\nThe POID organized a demonstration \"Macron, one year is enough!\" on 13 May  2018 in Paris, bringing together 4,000 participants.\nFrom March 2020, the party launched a campaign for the restitution of the 343 billion euros (unanimous vote in the National Assembly on this subject) devoted by the Macron government to aid to businesses, so that they could be used for hospitals, increasing wages and education.\nOn 5 December 2020, the party participated in the Parisian demonstration entitled \"For freedom of the press and the defence of social rights.\nIn the context of the war in Ukraine, the POID is mobilizing \"against the war and against the defence budget of Emmanuel Macron\". The party calls for \"an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in Ukraine including the withdrawal of all foreign troops outside the countries they occupy.\nIn 2022, the party is leading a campaign in support of Afghan women under the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.\n\n\n== Elections ==\nWhen it was founded, the POID had elected officials (former POI elected officials) in a certain number of municipalities: mayors, deputies or councillors.\nThe POID presented 64 candidates in the 2017 legislative elections but none were elected.\nThe party also stood candidates in the 2021 departmental elections.\nIn 2022, while the POI joins the Popular Union formed by La France insoumise to tackle the presidential election, then on the occasion of the legislative elections the New Ecological and Social Popular Union (NUPES) supported by his party the POID remained uncommitted. Noting for his part that if he claims power, \"at the same time, Jean-Luc Mélenchon undertakes to respect the institutions of the Fifth Republic by cohabiting with Macron (which amounts to \"governing\" under his control)\". The POID stood around a hundred candidates in the elections but achieved weak results.\nIn 2024, the Workers' Party presents a list for the 2024 European Parliament election in France named \"For bread, peace, freedom\". It is led by Camille Adoue, a 23-year-old editor.\n\n\n== Trade Unionism ==\nLike the POI, the POID is present in the trade union movement, particularly within the Workers' Force confederation due to the presence of its activists in particular. The two parties are now in conflict within FO since the ousting of Pascal Pavageau, the short-lived successor to Jean-Claude Mailly in 2018. However, the POID's line of conduct is the independence of the party vis-à-vis the unions, and conversely the independence of the unions vis-à-vis the party.\n\n\n== Legal cases ==\nOn 17 February 2023, the Paris administrative court rendered a decision favourable to the Independent Democratic Workers' Party, condemning the former Paris Police Prefect Didier Lallement, who had banned a demonstration of this party on June 5, 2021.\n\n\n== References ==",

She was imprisoned for her faith and died during her imprisonment on 27 May 1839, in Seoul, Joseon. She is one of the Martyrs of Korea canonized on 6 May 1984 by Pope John Paul II.\n\n\n== Martyrdom ==\nBarbara was put in prison for her faith. She suffered from typhoid fever in the prison. This disease caused excruciating pain and was very easily transmitted in prisons because of the unhealthy environment in crowded and cramped prison cells. Barbara suffered for one week, and died in prison in Seoul on 27 May 1839, at the age of 15.\n\n\n== Canonisation ==\nSaint Barbara was venerated by Pope Pius XI (decree of martyrdom) on 9 May 1925, Beatified on 5 July 1925 by Pope Pius XI and canonised on 6 May 1984 by Pope John Paul II.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Jaxon Nelson (born March 30, 2000), is an American professional ice hockey forward currently playing for the Providence Bruins of the American Hockey League (AHL) as a prospect to the Boston Bruins of the National Hockey League (NHL). He played college ice hockey for the Minnesota Golden Gophers men's ice hockey team.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\n\n\n=== Collegiate ===\nNelson committed to play for the Minnesota Golden Gophers starting in the 2019–20 season, in his freshman year of high school. At the time of his commitment, Nelson was seen as one of the best high school prospects in Minnesota, even though he was only a freshman.\nAs a freshmen, Nelson played in 33 games for the Golden Gophers. In those 33 games, he scored two goals and four assists for six total points. After helping Minnesota advance to the semifinals of the 2020 Big Ten Tournament over Notre Dame, Nelson and the Golden Gophers were set to play top seeded Penn State. However, their season would abruptly end after the Big Ten cancelled the tournament due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Later, the NCAA cancelled the rest of the season due to the pandemic as well.\nReturning to action for the 2020–21 season, Nelson saw an uptick in his role and production with the Golden Gophers. In 31 games, Nelson scored five goals and ten assists for 15 points. He would then help the Golden Gophers win the 2021 Big Ten tournament, scoring a goal in the championship against the Wisconsin Badgers. The tournament victory gave Minnesota an automatic bid to the 2021 NCAA tournament. After a decisive 7–2 victory over Omaha in the first round, Nelson and the Golden Gophers would get shutout 4–0 by the Minnesota State Mavericks in the following round, ending their season.\nNelson missed 13 games of his junior season due to injury. However, despite this, he still posted solid numbers in his limited action, scoring six goals and four assists. He would once again help the Golden Gophers reach the finals 2022 Big Ten tournament, but the ending wasn't happy this time, as they fell 4–3 to the Michigan Wolverines. They would still secure an at-large bid to the 2022 NCAA tournament, and they would make the most of it. After defeating the defending champion UMass in the first round, a game in which Nelson would assist on the game-winning overtime winner, they then proceeded to shutout Western Michigan to proceed to the Frozen Four. Unfortunately, the Mavericks would once again end the Golden Gophers season, defeating them 5–1.\nNelson was named a captain of the Golden Gophers for his senior year. As a senior, he posted career highs in all categories, scoring 10 goals and 17 assists for 27 points in 40 games. Nelson once again led his team to the final round of the 2023 Big Ten tournament, Minnesota's third straight appearance in the finals. However, for the second consecutive season, the Golden Gophers would lose out on the Big Ten Championship to the Wolverines, losing 4–3. Despite this, the Golden Gophers once again made a deep run in the 2023 NCAA tournament, making it all the way to the championship round. They would dominate Canisius in the first round, beating them 9–2, then beat in-state rival St. Cloud State 4–1 before another dominating 6–2 win over Boston University in the Frozen Four to reach the final. In the final against Quinnipiac, Minnesota could not hold an early 2–0 lead and would fall 3–2 in overtime. In the run, Nelson had a point in every game in the tournament, with two goals and three assists, including a goal in the championship round.\nNelson announced that he would return to the Golden Gophers for a fifth and final season. Nelson was once again named a captain of the team for the 2023–24 season. Nelson would continue his statistical success with the Golden Gophers, scoring a career high 19 goals, and adding 12 assists for 31 total points in 39 games. However, déjà vu struck the Golden Gophers once again, as they would be eliminated by none other than the Wolverines in the semifinals of the 2024 Big Ten tournament, the third straight year such had happened. However, they would receive an at-large bid to the 2024 NCAA tournament for a third straight year as well, although this time, there wouldn't be a long run like the previous year. After a close 3–2 victory over Omaha which saw Nelson score two goals, including the game-tying and game-winning goals in the third period, Boston University would get their revenge on Nelson and the Golden Gophers in the following round, beating them 6-3 and ending their season. Nelson scored one goal in the loss, which would be his final collegiate game.\n\n\n=== Professional ===\nOn April 2, 2024, just three days after his collegiate career had ending, it was announced that Nelson had signed a one-year, $870,000 entry-level contract with the Boston Bruins. He would report to the Bruins AHL affiliate, the Providence Bruins, on a amateur tryout contract for the remainder of the 2023–24 season.\n\n\n== Career statistics ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBiographical information and career statistics from Eliteprospects.com, or The Internet Hockey Database",

Some smaller shotgun houses were built, but most are larger, middle-class dwellings which have ornamental gingerbread and other elaborate trim.\nThe district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Robert Nesbitt, or Nisbet, FRS (died 27 May 1761) was an English physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nNesbitt was the son of John Nesbitt, a dissenting minister. He was born in London. On 1 September 1718 he entered as a medical student at Leyden, where he attended the lectures of Herman Boerhaave and the elder Albinus, and graduated M.D. on 25 April 1721. After his return to England he practised in London as a physician. He became licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians on 25 June 1726, was created M.D. at Cambridge on 15 June 1728, and was admitted a fellow on 30 September 1729, having been ‘candidate’ at the same date in the preceding year. He filled the office of censor in 1733, 1738, 1742, 1745, and 1748, became ‘elect’ on 22 August 1748, and conciliarius in 1750, 1754, and 1758. He was appointed Lumleian lecturer for five years on 23 March 1741. Nesbitt had been elected F.R.S. as early as 22 April 1725, and two years later contributed to the ‘Transactions’ a paper ‘On a Subterraneous Fire observed in the County of Kent’ (Phil. Trans. Abridg. vii. 195). He died in London on 27 May 1761.\nNesbitt published, besides ‘Disputatio de Partu difficili’ (his Leyden thesis), ‘Human Osteogeny explained in two Lectures read in the Anatomical Theatre of the Surgeons of London, anno 1731, illustrated with Figures drawn from Life,’ 1736, 8vo. A German translation by Johann Ernst Greding appeared at Altenberg in 1753. Albrecht von Haller in his ‘Bibliotheca Anatomica’ gives a short description of the work, and calls the author ‘bonus in universum auctor.’\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: le Grys Norgate, Gerald (1894). \"Nesbitt, Robert\".

One-third of the 51 members of Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council in Lancashire will be elected.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Labour Party have governed Blackburn with Darwen for most of its history. They controlled the council from its creation in 1997 as a unitary authority to 2007, and again from 2011 to the present, with a period of no overall control between. In the previous election, Labour won 14 seats (up 2) with 63.0% of the vote, the Conservatives won 3 (down 1) with 30.3%, and the Liberal Democrats lost the seat they were defending with 5.1%.\nThe seats up for election in 2024 were last contested in 2021; because of the delay of all local elections due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the seats are up for election after 3 years rather than the usual 4. In that election, Labour won 11 seats with 55.4%, the Conservatives won 6 with 38.8%, and the Liberal Democrats won 0 with 5.0%.\n\n\n== Previous council composition ==\n\nChanges:\n\nOctober 2023: Saj Ali, Mustafa Desai, Samim Desai, Suleman Khonat, Adbul Patel, Salma Patel, and Salim Sidat leave Labour to sit as independents; Mohammed Irfan suspended from Labour; Altaf \"Tiger\" Patel leaves Conservatives to sit as an independent\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Walter Speggiorin (born December 16, 1952, in Camisano Vicentino) is a retired Italian professional football player who played as a forward.\n\n\n== Club career ==\nSpeggiorin began his football career with local teams before moving to L.R. Vicenza main team in 1968.\nIn the 1969–1970 season, he transferred to Genoa, in Serie B, where he debuted at the age of seventeen, scoring 2 goals in 5 matches before being sidelined by a serious injury. He remained with Genoa for the next two seasons, including a stint in Serie C in the 1970–1971 season, before returning in the summer of 1972 to Lanerossi Vicenza, where he made his Serie A debut on September 24 against Torino. \nAcquired by Fiorentina in the summer of 1973, he spent three seasons in Tuscany, showing his offensive qualities but also inconsistency, which prevented him from establishing himself as a regular starter. With Fiorentina, he won the Coppa Italia in 1975 and a Anglo-Italian League Cup where he scored the winning goal in the return leg against West Ham Utd.\nIn 1976, he moved to Napoli where he had a relatively anonymous season in the league, but stood out in continental competitions. In the Cup Winners' Cup, he scored 3 goals, helping Napoli reach the semifinals. However, he was involved in a controversial incident during the semifinal, scoring a goal against Anderlecht that was disallowed by English referee Bob Matthewson. He also performed well in the Anglo-Italian League Cup, scoring a brace against Southampton in the return leg to secure the trophy for Napoli.\nTransferred to AC Perugia, he arguably played his best two seasons there. Under coach Ilario Castagner, he played as a left winger alongside young talent Salvatore Bagni, supporting striker Gianfranco Casarsa. Speggiorin began to score with a consistency he had not shown before—17 goals in 44 appearances over two seasons, finishing as the top scorer for Perugia both times. He played a significant role in the notable achievements of the so-called \"Perugia of miracles,\" including a second-place finish in the 1978-1979 Serie A season and a record-breaking unbeaten run.\nIn the summer of 1978, Perugia also won the Karl Rappan Cup, their first international trophy, with Speggiorin contributing 4 goals.\nThroughout his career, Speggiorin amassed a total of 167 appearances and 33 goals in Serie A, and 49 matches and 7 goals in Serie B.\n\n\n== National Team ==\nIn 1973, he scored a goal in his only appearance for the Italy Under-21 team against France in Paris.\n\n\n== Honours ==\n\n\n=== Club ===\nACF Fiorentina\nCoppa Italia: 1974–75\n\n\n== References ==",

He matriculated at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, on 20 May 1642, and afterwards became postmaster or portionist of Merton College. He graduated B.A. on 2 April 1647. After enjoying, according to Wood, 'some petit employment' during the civil wars and the Commonwealth, Munday was elected head-master of the free grammar school in his native town in 1656. To his work as a teacher he added the practice of medicine, and the school suffered in consequence. His death saved him from the disgrace of dismissal. He died from a fall from his horse as he was returning home from a visit to John, third baron Lovelace, at Hurley, on 28 June 1682, and was buried in the north chancel of Henley Church. His estate was administered for 'Alicia and Marie Mundy, minors.'\nHe published: 'Βιοχρηστολογία seu Commentarii de Aere Vitali, de Esculeutis, de Potulentis, cum Corollario de Parergis in Victu,' Oxford, 1680, 1685; London, 1681; Frankfort, 1685; Leipzig, 1685; Leyden, 1615.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Porter, Bertha (1894). \"Munday, Henry\".

It was published in English in 1958, translated by Michael Bullock.\n\n\n== Plot ==\n\nIn 1938, a group of people attempt to leave a coastal village in Germany and cross the Baltic Sea to Sweden. There is a boy whose father has died at sea, a Jewess named Judith whose mother committed suicide to help her flee, and a self-doubting communist named Gregor. There is also the expressionist sculpture Studying Monk by Ernst Barlach, which a pastor wishes to smuggle into safety. A fisherman named Knutsen is approached but does not want to be involved in the enterprise. Eventually, Gregor forces Knutsen to bring the sculpture, the boy and Judith with him on his boat, but at the expense of Gregor who is left behind.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nKirkus Reviews called the book oblique and elusive, and wrote that despite an excellent English translation, it will only appeal to niche readers.\n\n\n== Adaptations ==\nFlight to Afar has been adapted for cinema twice. First as Sansibar (1961), directed by Rainer Wolffhardt, and then as Sansibar oder der letzte Grund (1987), directed by Bernhard Wicki.\nIt is the basis for the opera Sansibar with libretto by Wolfgang Willaschek and music by Eckehard Mayer. The opera premiered in 1994.\n\n\n== References ==",

During his time as university president, SGU became the first tribal university in the United States, and became the first tribal higher learning institution to achieve both bachelor's and master's degree accreditation.\nBordeaux also helped found or served as a boardmember of several organizations, including the American Indian Higher Education Consortium, American Indian College Fund, Native American Rights Fund, and Phelps Stokes Fund.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nLionel Raphael Bordeaux was born on February 9, 1940, in Mellette County, South Dakota, to Ella Bordeaux. He was raised by his grandparents, Alex Jr. and Mary (née Jordan) Bordeaux. He attended several schools in his childhood, including Horse Creek Day School, St. Mary's School in Winner, and other public schools in White River, South Dakota, and Lincoln, Nebraska. He later returned to Rosebud, where he graduated from St. Francis Indian School.\nBordeaux initially began attending classes at Black Hills State University (BHSU; then known as the Black Hills Teachers College). During that time, both his grandfather and brother passed away, and his mother gave up her beauty business in Sioux Falls. Due to the emotional toll, Bordeaux returned home to White River, where he shared a small house with his grandmother, mother, and adopted sister. He eventually returned to his studies with the support of his family.\nBordeaux graduated from BHSU in 1964 with a BA in composite history and social science and a minor in psychology.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Bureau of Indian Affairs ===\nAfter graduation, he took with the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) as a counselor on the Jicarilla Apache reservation in Dulce, New Mexico. He initially planned to pursue his BIA career indefinitely. In 1966, the BIA's management training program took him to Washington, D.C., and then to Dallas, Texas, between 1967 and 1969, where he became a vocational counselor. During this time, he took classes at Adams State College and George Washington University. Bordeaux later credited his time in Dallas with teaching him about the struggles of Native Americans who had been relocated by the federal government to large cities under the Indian Relocation Act of 1956.\nIn 1969, Bordeaux returned to South Dakota, settling in Pine Ridge, where he began acting as a guidance counselor and instructor at several area schools. He also enrolled at the University of South Dakota. There, he earned a master's degree in guidance and counseling and then prepared to apply as area director for the BIA.\n\n\n=== Sinte Gleska University president ===\nBetween 1971 and 1973, Bordeaux pursued a PhD in educational administration at the University of Minnesota. He completed his studies, but before he could finish his dissertation, he was approached by Stanley Red Bird Sr., founder of Sinte Gleska University (SGU), who asked Bordeaux to leave his studies and become the university's president. Tribal leadership wanted Bordeaux to lead the college, due to his knowledge and respect of Sicangu language and culture. Bordeaux accepted, resigned from the BIA, and was inugurated on February 3, 1973, by 12 medicine men.\nBordeaux pushed a focus on preserving Lakota culture in the college's curriculum. Under his leadership, SGU became the first tribal college to become a tribal university. SGU also became the first tribal college to become accredited at both the bachelor's and master's degree levels. Its first master's degree program was offered in elementary education.\n\n\n=== Educational advocacy ===\nBordeaux was also an advocate for Native American rights, particularly in access to education. He was a founder of the American Indian Higher Education Consortium (AIHEC), World Indigenous Nations Higher Education Consortium (WINHEC), American Indian College Fund (AICF), and Tribal College Journal. He served as president of AIHEC and the National Indian Education Association. He was a boardmember of several organizations, including AICF, the Native American Rights Fund, the National Indian Education Association, the Phelps Stokes Fund, the South Dakota Indian Education Association, the South Dakota State Education and Planning Commission, and Americans for Indian Opportunity. He was also regent of the Haskell Indian Junior College in Lawrence, Kansas.\nDuring his career, Bordeaux was appointed to two presidential committees on Native American education: the National Advisory Council on Indian Education and the advisory board of the White House Initiative on Tribal Colleges and Universities. He was also appointed co-chair of the White House Conference on Indian Education in 1991.\nBordeaux also served as a tribal leader on councils for the Rosebux Sioux Tribe and its reservation for 14 years, including as chair of the tribal education committee and board. He also assisted the formation of tribal colleges at the Lower Brule Indian Reservation and Yankton Indian Reservation.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nBordeaux married Barbara Colombe and had four children with her.\n\n\n== Death ==\nBordeaux died on November 16, 2022. He is buried in St. Ignatius Catholic Cemetery in White River. At the time of his death, he was still president of SGU, and at that time he was the longest-serving college or university president in the United States.\nOn December 2, 2022, U.S. Representative for South Dakota Dusty Johnson entered into the record a memoriam speech in Bordeaux's honor. The 2023 South Dakota Legislature issued House Commemoration 8002 to celebrate his life.\n\n\n== Accolades ==\nBordeaux received several honors and awards during his lifetime, including:\n\n1983: Outstanding Educator of the Year, National Congress of American Indians\n1988: Outstanding Indian Educator, National Indian Education Association\n1993: Inducted into the South Dakota Hall of Fame\n2018: Inducted into the National Native American Hall of Fame\nOutstanding Administrator of the Year and Alumni/Special Achievement Award, Black Hills State University\nAlumni/Distinguished Achievement Award, University of South Dakota\nOutstanding Educator of the Year and Human and Civil Rights Award, South Dakota Indian Education Association\nFirst Lifetime Achievement Award, National Indian Education Association\nAmerican Indian Distinguished Achievement Award, American Indian Resource Institute\nJ.E.K.

Black Hills State University named him among their top 25 graduates.\nRosebud Indian Reservation observes a Lionel R. Bordeaux Day on his birthday, February 9. In 2018, South Dakota Governor Dennis Daugaard issued a proclamation that February 9, 2018, be celebrated statewide as Lionel R. Bordeaux Day.\nBlack Hills State University named one of their residence halls, Lionel R. Bordeaux Residence Hall, in his honor on October 10, 2017.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Al Rahbi Park (Arabic: حديقة الرحبي) is a park located in the Adhamiyah district of Baghdad, Iraq. The park is known for containing the tomb of the famous Muslim scholar, Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari (839–923 CE), the author of the Tarikh al-Tabari historical chronicle and the famed Tafsir al-Tabari exegesis of the Qur'an.\n\n\n== Tomb of Al-Tabari ==\nThe tomb of the famous Muslim jurist and scholar, Al-Tabari, is located at a far corner of Al Rahbi Park. The tomb, which had been forgotten for years, was rediscovered in 2002 when several old houses were demolished to expand the area of the park. Archaeologists and historians including Imad Abd al-Salam Rauf subsequently identified the tomb as belonging to Al-Tabari, and the place was made into a heritage site.\nIn late 2017, locals reported that the tomb was in a state of neglect and filthy, with rubbish being dumped on it. Subsequent pictures showed the grave in a dilapidated and filthy condition, with litter strewn everywhere. Locals were unsatisfied with the condition of the tomb, and went online to voice the matter of the government's lack of interest in preserving the tomb.\nIn 2018, the Sunni Endowment Office announced that a new mausoleum structure, or shrine, would be built around the pre-existing grave of Al-Tabari, headed by Abdul Latif Hamim under the supervision of Saad Mahmoud Al Qaisi, the current Director General of the Department of Religious Shrines.\n\n\n=== Gallery ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nGarden of Ridván, Baghdad\nSami Abdulrahman Park\n\n\n== References ==",

With the intention of exhausting the Ottomans, and preventing them from renewing their strength or catching their breaths; Until the body of the Ottoman Empire became easily divided between countries fighting to devour it.\n\n\n=== Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca ===\n\nThe Ottoman Empire entered into a fierce war that lasted for six years with Russia (1768 - 1774), in which the Ottoman Empire suffered painful defeats, forcing it to conclude a shameful treaty on July 21, 1774, which is known as the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca, in which the Russians’ hopes that the Black Sea would be transformed from a purely Ottoman lake into an Ottoman-Russian lake were fulfilled, and Russian navigation now enjoyed freedom of movement in the Black Sea without restrictions or conditions. The treaty included that the Ottoman Empire would pay a fine to Russia amounting to 15,000 bags of gold, and that the Russians would obtain the right to care for the Orthodox population in the Ottoman lands. This clause would have meant that Russia would intervene in the affairs of the Ottoman Empire on an ongoing basis.\n\n\n=== Meeting of the Russian Tsar and the English Ambassador ===\nRussia was not satisfied with the gains it gained from the Ottoman Empire, but its sights extended to tearing the state apart and distributing its property. It raised its voice by waging wars against it, and its politicians were astonished at the failure of European countries to participate with Russia in its war against the Ottomans. The conversation between Nicholas I, Tsar of all Russia, and Sir Hamilton Seymour, the British ambassador to Constantinople, reveals Russia's expansionist policy.\nThe Tsar described the Ottoman Empire as a country that was collapsing, and that it was a very \"sick man\" who might die suddenly, and it was necessary to agree on how to dispose of his lands before he died. He indicated that the matter would be settled between England and Russia without a war breaking out between them, and he frankly explained his desire for the independence of the Balkan countries under the protection of Russia, and to seize the Ottoman capital, and in exchange for that, Britain would seize Egypt, but this project was not successful or found a response from Britain, which was rejecting Russia's access to the straits.\n\n\n=== Spark of war ===\n\nThe Ottoman Empire continued to maintain a balance between the Roman Catholics and the Orthodox in their respective rights to manage the places of pilgrimage in Jerusalem, especially the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem. The dispute between them was simple, but it gained its importance from the Russian Tsar's support for Orthodox demands, while Napoleon III, Emperor of the French, supported the demands of the Catholic Church regarding the Holy Places, and France considered itself a protector of Christians in the East since the time of the Crusades. This conflict ended with Sultan Abdulmejid issuing a decree in favor of the Catholic Church in 1852.\nThis decision greatly angered the Tsar, so he ordered a Russian army to be mobilized and sent to the Prut River, and at the same time he sent an arrogant delegation to Constantinople headed by Prince Alexander Sergeyevich Menshikov, not to ask for urgent satisfaction regarding the holy places, but to demand the conclusion of a treaty between the two countries, which is more unfair to the rights of the Ottoman Empire than all previous treaties with Russia; It guaranteed the Tsar the right to protect all Orthodox subjects living under the Ottoman Empire. The Sultan rejected these demands.\n\n\n== The Egyptian army in Crimea ==\nRussian armies crossed the Prut River in 1853, occupying Wallachia and Moldavia (now Romania). Peaceful efforts failed to resolve the precarious situation; So Sultan Abdulmejid I sent a request for help from Egypt, and Abbas Pasha I, the wāli of Egypt, complied and ordered the preparation of a fleet of twelve ships, equipped with about 6,850 naval soldiers and 642 cannons under the command of Admiral Hassan Pasha al-Iskandarani, in addition to a land army led by Selim Fathi Pasha. It includes about 20,000 soldiers and 72 cannons, equipped with machinery and weapons.\n\nThe Egyptian historian Prince Omar Toussoun recorded the news of this relief in full detail in his valuable book: “The Egyptian Army in the Russian War Known as the Crimean War.”\n\n\n=== Battle of Sinop ===\n\nThe Ottoman Empire declared war on Russia on Muharram 1, 1270 AH / October 4, 1853 AD, and sent a section of its naval fleet alongside the Egyptian vessels Damiat and Pervaz-i Bahri to the port of Sinop on the Black Sea. It consisted of thirteen naval vessels led by Osman Pasha, and then arrived at the port. On Muharram 18, 1270 AH / October 21, 1853 AD, some Russian naval vessels were led by Pavel Nakhimov, commander of the Russian fleet, to uncover the locations of the Ottoman fleet and know the extent of its strength. They remained stationed outside the port, besieging the Ottoman ships. Nakhimov sent to his country requesting to supply him with more vessels. The Navy arrived, and when it arrived, he placed four of his warships outside the port; to cut off the Ottoman ships' line of return if they tried to escape.\nWhen Osman Pasha expected the treachery of the Russian fleet, he ordered his commanders and soldiers to be prepared and patient when fighting, despite the pledge of Nicholas I, Tsar of Russia, and his promise not to attack the Ottoman forces unless they started fighting, but the Tsar broke his promise. The Russian ships opened fire on the Ottoman and Egyptian naval ships, which were few in number and small in size when compared to the Russian ships, on the 28th of Safar 1270 AH / 30 November 1853 AD.\nThe Egyptian frigate Damiat, which had 56 cannons and 500 Egyptian sailors on board, began firing at the Russian ships amidst the shouting of the Egyptian sailors. The Egyptian frigate Damiat was the fourth largest ship on the Ottoman side, so it was spotted by the Russian ships.\nWhile the battle was underway and outside the Gulf of Sinop, the second Egyptian frigate, Pervaz-i Bahri, its captain was the al-Saghul Agassi Saleh Qabdan, was coming from Constantinople to the Sinop Gulf, and its crew did not know that a battle was taking place in the first place. A huge Russian steamship named Vladimir spotted the Egyptian steamship, Pervaz-i Bahri.\n\nThe Russian crew implemented a smart plan, so that they raised the Ottoman flag on the Russian ship. The Egyptian crew on Pervaz-i Bahri thought that the ship was an ally, and they allowed the Russian steamship Vladimir to approach them. As soon as it approached the Egyptian ship, the Egyptian crew noticed that there was something strange going on. The Russian steamship, Vladimir, began a direct attack on Pervaz-i Bahri, thus beginning the first action between steamships in history. They hit her steam engines, so Pervaz-i Bahri was unable to move regularly. Although it was a direct hit that prevented any ship from continuing the battle, Pervaz-i Bahri and its Egyptian crew refused to surrender.\nThe Egyptian steamship, Pervaz-i Bahri, spent 3 hours fighting the Russian steamship, Vladimir, to the point that one of the Egyptian shells killed five of the command crew, including Vice Admiral, Lieutenant Gezaiselznov, in addition to wounding the Russian Admiral himself, Vladimir Alexeyevich Kornilov.\nAfter a violent Russian bombardment, the death of 19 members of the Egyptian crew, including a Yuzbashi, two lieutenants, and sixteen sailors, and the wounding of 21 others, the crew of the Pervaz-i Bahri surrendered, and the Russian fleet towed the ship to the port of Sevastopol, and its Egyptian crew was treated as prisoners of war with respect due for their honorable fighting.\nThe Russians subsequently repaired the ship, Pervaz-i Bahri, and changed its name to Admiral Kornilov, Chief of Staff of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, who led the Battle against Pervaz-i Bahri.\nThe battle between Pervaz-i Bahri and Vladimir is considered the first battle between two steamships in history, and the Russians celebrate it every year as one of the Days of Military Honour.\nIn the heart of the Gulf of Sinop, the Egyptian sailors found that most of the Ottoman ships were sunk and destroyed, other than the sinking of the Egyptian frigate and the martyrdom of its Egyptian crew in the middle of a prolonged scene. And not only that, they found that the rest of the Ottoman ships were fleeing the battlefield and heading to anchor on the beaches. There was nothing left beside the Egyptian ship Damiat except one Ottoman ship called Taif, which also escaped in the direction of Constantinople (and the truth is not known whether it escaped at the time of the sinking of Damiat or before that). The Egyptian sailors knew that their fate was inevitable, but out of faith and that they were representing the Egyptian nation in a strange war and in a strange land to their country, they continued the battle with all valor.\nThe entire Russian ships were attacking the Damiat frigate alone, which was defending the port of Sinop with all valor. In the end, as is known, abundance prevails over courage.\nThe Damiat frigate was hit in devastating places, which led to its sinking becoming a matter of time. The Egyptian sailors began to prepare themselves, and the heroic frigate Damiat sank, and 500 Egyptian sailors were martyred in an epic scene learned by the Egyptian Navy and the Russian Navy. The Egyptian frigate Damiat received great respect from the Russians to this day.\n\nPrince Omar Toussoun says about the Battle of Sinop:“The Turkish and Egyptian naval ships, despite their small size and the huge size of the Russian ships, were fighting with all valor and courage, but this was to no avail, as the strength of the Russian navy was much greater than the strength of the Turkish and Egyptian navy, and the aforementioned war resulted in the destruction of the ships of this navy and the killing of most of its sailors.”He says again:“The Egyptians raised their status in the eyes of the world through their courage, bravery, and the intensity of their struggle against the Russians.”This action angered France and England, so they decided to enter into a war against the Russian Tsar on the side of the Ottoman Sultan. It lasted about two years, a war known as the Crimean War.\nIn late 1853, the Egyptian ground forces participated in some of the fiercest battles on the Danube River, while the Egyptian fleet proceeded to maneuver on the coast of the Crimea, with the flags of the Ottoman Empire on its masts, waiting for the fighting to begin. Less than 6 months later, France and Britain joined Turkey against the Russians, and the Crimean War began. In particular, the occupation of the city of Sevastopol, which was besieged by the coalition starting in September 1854 for an entire year, until they captured it and regained it from a Russian occupation that lasted 80 years.\nPrince Toussoun mentioned that the Ottoman coalition forces, including the Turks, Egyptians, British, and French in particular, defeated the Russian army in 1854, which was led by General Alexander Sergeyevich Menshikov, in one of the most famous battlefields, which was the Battle of Alma, after which the Egyptian fleet returned on October, 31 of that year to Istanbul. During its return, two Egyptian battleships sank in the Black Sea due to storms, and the Egyptian Navy lost 1,920 sailors including the fleet commander Hassan Pasha al-Iskandarani, and only 130 survived.\nThe news of the tragedy that befell the Egyptian Navy was published in an issue of the magazine The Illustrated London News published on December 2 of that year.\n\n\n=== Siege of Silistria (11 May – 23 June 1854) ===\n\nThe Egyptian ground forces were the first and most important division led by Isma'il Pasha Haqqi. It participated in the defense of the city of Silistria in northeastern Bulgaria from May 11 to June 23, 1854, and repelled the Russian attacks on it, killing 2,000 of them on the night of May 28 alone.\nSustained Ottoman-Egyptian resistance had allowed French and British troops to build up a significant army in nearby Varna. Under additional pressure from Austria, the Russian command, which was about to launch a final assault on the fortress town, was ordered to lift the siege and retreat from the area, thus ending the Danubian phase of the Crimean War.\n\n\n=== Battle of the Alma (5 April – 25 June 1854) ===\n\nThe 13th G and 14th G-Alai Bayada of the Egyptian 3rd Brigade, commanded by Suleiman Pasha al-Arnauti, contributed to this battle. The Russians were defeated there under the leadership of their general, Alexander Sergeyevich Menshikov.\n\nHere is what was reported in The Illustrated London News in its issue dated October 14, 1854, regarding the participation of Egyptian soldiers in that battle:“In the Alma incident, 7,000 Egyptian soldiers were marching on the shore of the salt sea under the command of Suleiman Pasha al-Arnaouti.”\n\n\n=== Siege of Sevastopol (17 October 1854 – 11 September 1855) ===\n\nThe rest of the ground forces proceeded to Crimea, and its artillery division constituted more than half of the Ottoman coalition forces consisting of 23,000 soldiers. In a few days, the Egyptians were able to occupy the famous city of Yevpatoria on 9 February 1855, an important strategic port for those who intended to occupy it.\nThe Egyptians who were transferred to it consisted of 9 Ji and 10 Ji Alai (regiment) Bayada (infantry), consisting of the First Brigade, led by Ismail Pasha Abu Jabal, and 13 Ji and 14 Ji Bayada, consisting of the Third Brigade, led by Suleiman Pasha al-Arnaouti. As for the second brigade of Egyptian soldiers, consisting of 11G and 12G-Alai Bayada, under the command of Ali Pasha Shukri, it remained in Rum-Ali on the Danube River. Naturally, the head of these commanders, Major General Selim Fathi Pasha, moved to Yevpatoria with most of them. When the Turkish and Egyptian armies arrived, the flames of war broke out. On February 11, the Russian army, which was stationed in front of Yevpatoria, began an offensive movement, initially seizing a Tatar cemetery located east of the city, but it was expelled from it as a result of a severe attack by the Turks and Egyptians.\nTherefore, the Russians responded on February 16 and 17, 1855, with a reluctant attack. Surprisingly, 19,000 soldiers, equipped with the latest weapons, the most important of which were 108 cannons, participated in it to retake the city.\nThe Egyptians repelled them with fierce fighting, described as one of the fiercest in the Crimean War. The Russians were forced to withdraw irregularly. In that battle alone, 400 Egyptians fell, who were buried in the city's Islamic cemetery. The commander of the Egyptian ground forces, Selim Pasha Fathi, also fell there, and they buried him next to a mosque in Yevpatoria  which is the oldest and most famous Juma-Jami Mosque in the city. The Emir of Alai, Mahammad Rustum Bey, and the Emir of Alai, Ali Bey, commanders of 9G and 14G Alai Bayada, also fell.\nIt was mentioned in the book \"The History of the War in Russia and Turkey\" that Lord Raglan, Commander-in-Chief of the British Army, said in his report that when the Russians attacked in the battle of Eupatoria, the Egyptians responded to that attack with amazing fortitude, and that this indicates that the fame that the Egyptian armies gained on the Danube River was only earned by merit and entitlement. This fame has remained constant for them without the slightest change.\nWhen the obituary of Selim Fathi Pasha came to Egypt, Sa'id of Egypt appointed Lieutenant General Ahmad Pasha al-Munkali in his place as Commander-in-Chief of the Egyptian armies in Turkey. He accompanied him with Emir al-Alai Ali Bey Mubarak, to be one of his pillars of war, and the two traveled to the battlefield.\nIn early 1855, Egyptian land rescue soldiers were mobilized, which Sa'id Pasha ordered to be sent to assist in this war. They sailed from Alexandria to Istanbul and then traveled on April 4 of the aforementioned year to the battlefield.\n\nThe Illustrated London News, in its issue dated April 14, 1855, published the news of the arrival of 8,000 Egyptian soldiers to Opatoria to reinforce the Ottoman army of Serdar Ikram Omar Pasha there. Here is what the aforementioned newspaper said in this regard:\"Omar Pasha's army in Opatoria was strengthened by the arrival of 8,000 Egyptian soldiers.\"It happened that when this help arrived, the Allied armies felt severe bothered due to the lack of combat soldiers. Marshal Kenrobert, commander of the Egyptian armies, proposed requesting supplies from Egyptian soldiers to support the Allied armies in this war. This is undoubtedly something that gives Egypt the greatest honor. This strange coincidence was mentioned by Mr. Fortescue in his book History of the British Army.\n\n\n== References ==",

SRS RSK) was the branch in Croatia of the Serbian Radical Party.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe SRS RSK was founded on 13 May 1992 at the assembly in Vukovar. Local committees for the party were soon established in Slavonia, Baranja, Dalmatia, Lika, Kordun, and Banovina. On 15 November, the board for the Serbian Radical Party for the Serbian region of Western Slavonia was founded in Okučani.\nIn the parliamentary elections held in the Republic of Serbian Krajina, the SRS RSK won 16 out of the 85 seats in the Serbian Krajina National Assembly. The SRS RSK has publicly supported the Serb Democratic Party. During the general elections, the party continuously supported the SDS's candidate, Milan Babić. Rade Leskovac ran in the election but only got 26,523 votes in the first round.\nOn 4 February 1995, the parties president, Rade Leskovac, was removed as the president by the executive board of the Serbian Radical Party in the Republic of Srpska Krajina and was also removed from the Serbian Radical Party for attempting to separate sections within it. Branko Vojnica was made the new president.\nThe party was dissolved in 1997, and after the reintegration of the Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia into Croatia in 1998, another party by the name of the Party of Danube Serbs was established by Rade Leskovac on 27 February 1998. The Party was erased from Register of political parties sometime between 2012 and 2015.\n\n\n== Electoral result ==\n\n\n=== Presidential elections ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nParty of Danube Serbs\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Nirṇayāmṛta, also transliterated as Nirnayamrita, is a 14th-16th century Sanskrit-language text by Allāḍanātha, on determining auspicious times for Hindu religious ceremonies. It comprises four chapters (prakaraṇas): vrata-nirṇaya, tithi-nirṇaya, śrāddha-nirṇaya, and āśauca-nirnaya.\nR. G. Bhandarkar classifies Nirṇayāmṛta among the dharma-śāstra texts. David Pingree's Census of the Exact Sciences in Sanskrit records 24 manuscripts of the text, which have several variations.\n\n\n== Date and place ==\nSources that quote the Nirṇayāmṛta include Raghunandana (16th century), Nirnaya-sindhu (which also quotes Raghunandana), and Bhattoji Dikshita's Tithi-nirnaya (17th century). Alladanatha names one of his sources as Parijata: if this is same as the Madana-pārijāta (c. 1375 CE), Alladanatha must have lived sometime during the 14th-16th century.\nAllāḍa-nātha was a son of Lakshmana (Lakṣmaṇa) Siddha, and wrote the book for a king named Sūryasena. Some manuscripts of the book attribute its authorship to Sūryasena, or to Gopi-narayana.\nNirṇayāmṛta describes Alladanatha's patron Sūryasena as the king of Ekachakra and a member of the family of Chvahuvana (possibly Chahuvana, that is Chauhan). The text provides the following genealogy of the king: Sarupa belonged to the famous race of Chahuvanas, and destroyed all his enemies. His son was Karna-deva, whose son Uddharana performed military exploits at Delhi and wounded the elephants of the \"Lord of the Shakas\". Uddharana settled in the city of Ekachakra, located on the banks of the \"daughter of the son\" (the Yamuna River). His son Chandra-sena had two sons: Surya-sena the elder, and Pratapa-sena the younger. Surya-sena had a son named Deva-sena. No other source mentions this dynasty. The genealogy does not match with that of the Sena dynasty of Bengal. Alexander Cunningham identified Ekachakra with Arrah in present-day Bihar, but that place is not located on the banks of the Yamuna River.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nAlladanatha states that he consulted the following sources to compose his treatise:\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nManuscript of Nirnayamrita\nनिर्णयामृतम् (धर्मशास्त्रनिबन्धः), Sanskrit text published by Khemraj Shrikrishnadas Shri Venkateshwar Press",

Bilgo graduated from the ESCP Business School in Paris, France. He gained prominence for his pro-government poetry and statements supporting the Burkina Faso Armed Forces and Volunteers for the Defense of the Homeland (VDP) during the Jihadist insurgency in Burkina Faso. Bilgo is also the head of the African Golden Association for African Renewal, where he hosts debates with Burkinabe and Malian politicians such as Abdoulaye Ly, Mélégué Traoré, and Aminata Traoré Bagayoko.\nBilgo was appointed as the Minister of National Education on March 5, 2022, following the January 2022 Burkina Faso coup d'état. During his time as the Minister of Education, he also served as a government spokesman.

When he was in ninth grade he memorized Rami Klinstein's score: \"(...) I realized that you could find a familiar song and learn to play it yourself. It literally changed everything I knew.\" Klinstein He was also the one who, in a chance meeting with Blum, convinced him to audition for a military band.\nThe nickname Yoshi was created in his youth by his friends from the dance group in which he danced as a teenager, but according to him it is also related to the Japanese culture to which he connects (where there is a fictional character named Yoshi, in English: Yoshi, in Japanese: Yosshi (ヨッシー).Yoshi lives in Tel Aviv.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAfter completing his military service in the IDF Youth and Educational Corps Band, Blum began working professionally in the field of music.

        "content": "Sir Robert Tabor, or Talbor, (1642? – November 1681) was an English physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nTabor born in Cambridgeshire in 1642 or 1643. He was the son of John Tabor, registrar to the bishop of Ely and grandson of James Tabor, registrar of Cambridge University. In early life he was apprenticed to a Cambridge apothecary named Dent. In this position he devoted his attention to improving the methods of administering quinine or jesuits’ bark as a cure for fever. At that time the after-effects of the drug rendered it an extremely dangerous remedy. To study its operation better Tabor removed to a marshy district in Essex, where fevers were prevalent. There he perfected his method of cure. Though he shrouded his remedy in considerable mystery, and disguised its nature by mixing it with other drugs, the merit of his system lay in the fact that he administered the quinine in smaller quantities and at more frequent intervals than had been customary. He published the results of his researches in a work entitled ‘Πυρετολογία, a Rational Account of the Cause and Cure of Agues; whereunto is added a Short Account of the Cause and Cure of Feavers,’ London, 1672, 8vo. Notwithstanding opposition from rival practitioners, his remedy soon became famous. According to Edward Sheffield, marquis of Normanby, Tabor was happy enough to save Charles II’s life when it was threatened by a dangerous ague. Richard Lower (1631–1691) refused to sanction the trial of the remedy, but, on the intervention of Thomas Short (1635-1685), Tabor was permitted to make the experiment, and was completely successful (Evelyn, Diary, 29 Nov. 1695). In consequence he was appointed one of the king’s physicians in ordinary, and was knighted at Whitehall on 27 July 1678. About this time he proceeded to France by order of Charles and cured the dauphin of an ague. His remedy was known there as ‘the Englishman’s cure.’ Louis XIV treated him with great consideration, invited him to settle in France, and, when he declined, purchased the secret of his treatment from him. In 1679 he proceeded to Spain to attend the queen, Louisa Maria (Lettres de Mme. de Sevigné, 1738, iv. 272). He died in November 1681, and was buried on the 17th in Trinity Church, Cambridge, in the north chapel, where a monument was erected to him. On 17 February 1678–9 he married Elizabeth Aylet of Rivenhall, Essex, at St. Matthew’s, Friday Street, London. By her he had a son, an officer in the army, known as ‘Handsome Tabor.’\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Carlyle, Edward Irving (1898). \"Tabor, Robert\".

        "content": "Work for Curaçao (Dutch: Werk voor Curaçao, Papiamento: Trabou pa Kòrsou, abbreviated as TPK) is a political party in Curaçao. The party was founded in October 2020 as a splinter from various parties, running candidates who were formerly from the National People's Party, Partido Inovashon Nashonal, Workers' Liberation Front, and People's Crusade Labour Party, by former police officer and member of the Parliament of Curaçao, Rennox Calmes.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2019, during Rennox Calmes' tenure as a member of Parliament, demands were made by fellow Parliament member Miro Amparo dos Santos to investigate Calmes' political activities. The demands were made after Calmes was sent to visit The Netherlands for a working visit on behalf of the Parliament of Curaçao, but instead traveled to London. The party became the subject of controversy after rumors had circulated that Calmes had threatened to break away from the party and serve as an independent in parliament. Both the party and Calmes denied these allegations.\nThe party ran in the 2021 Curaçao general election, initially fielding twenty-nine candidates; however, one candidate, Almeir Godett, was shot and killed during a familial dispute. Despite this, Godett was not removed from the list of candidates, and it was possible to vote for him during the race. Godett received 427 votes. The Supreme Electoral Council of Curaçao declared that the votes for Godett would be transferred to the party itself, not to him. During the election, TPK received 4,411 votes, or 5.20% of the votes for Parliament, resulting in one seat being won by the party.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "John Taunton (1769 – 5 March 1821) was an English surgeon.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nTaunton was the son of Charles Taunton. He was born at Pye Mill in Paxford, a hamlet of Blockley in Worcestershire. He was baptised on 21 May 1769 in the parish church of Chipping Campden, and was brought up as a farmer; but a study of anatomy drew him to London. He knew nobody there, and, asking at a shop in Holborn for the most reputed surgeon and best anatomical instructor, was directed to Dr. Andrew Marshal of Thavies Inn. He immediately waited upon him, but did not attend his classes, and he eventually became a pupil of Henry Cline at St. Thomas's Hospital. This was about 1798. In 1801 Taunton was appointed demonstrator of anatomy at Guy's Hospital, in temporary charge during the illness of John Cunningham Saunders, and he subsequently became principal lecturer at the London Anatomical Society. He was surgeon to the city dispensary in 1801, at a time when the charity was almost bankrupt; but under his able guidance it soon became a flourishing establishment. His position as surgeon to the city dispensary led him to treat large numbers of poor weavers in Spitalfields who suffered from prolapsus ani, hernia, and other diseases incident to their occupation, for the cure of which expensive mechanical appliances were required. This led to the establishment of the City of London Truss Society in 1807, when Taunton, with the assistance of a young bell-hanger, began to manufacture trusses for distribution among the poor of the neighbourhood. Taunton became attached to the Finsbury dispensary as its surgeon about the beginning of the century, and reformed its whole constitution. He also took an active part at the Medical Society of London, which he nearly wrecked in 1812 by proposing as secretary, and carrying against all opposition, Thomas Joseph Pettigrew, a former apprentice, then newly admitted a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, instead of Dr. George Birkbeck, whose position as a senior member of the profession should have secured him from such a contest. Taunton had a very large dispensary practice of a kind which is now extinct. It was his duty to visit the sick poor at their own homes, which were distributed over large areas. He performed this duty most conscientiously, yet he found time to carry out innumerable post-mortem examinations and made many pathological preparations. He also established a private school, at which he sought to supplement the very deficient training then given to the medical students at the various hospitals in London. He died at his house in Hatton Garden on Monday morning, 5 March 1821, leaving a widow and three sons.\nAn unsigned three-quarter length portrait in oils of John Taunton was placed in the secretary's office at the Truss Society's rooms in Finsbury Square, E.C.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Power, D'Arcy (1898). \"Taunton, John\".

        "content": "Acteon traskii is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Acteonidae.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe length of the shell varies between 5 mm and 18 mm.\n(Original description) The small shell is conical above, rounded below, rather solid and glossy. It is sculptured by numerous fine impressed lines or grooves which become wider toward the base of the body whorl, making the sculpture of this part of the shell lirate . The lirae are sometimes slightly grooved. Otherwise they are sculptured by sharp, close set incremental threads, these are subordinate to the spiral sculpture.\nThe color of the shell is dull cream-white with two obscure rufous bands on the body whorl.\nThe spire is short and obtusely conical. The shell contains six whorls. The sutures are distinct and are narrowly channelled. The aperture measures about two-thirds of the length of the shell. It is sharply angulated above, rounded and effuse below, finely lirate and glossy within,\nwith a thin glazing on the body whorl. The outer lip is simple. The columella is short, with a fold curving around to and thickening the edge of the lip below, which is moderately produced.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nThis marine species occurs in the Pacific Ocean from Santa Barbara, California to Colombia and Peru.; depths: 3–100 m, rarely to 305 m.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nRamírez, R.; Paredes, C.; Arenas, J.

        "content": "This is a list of singles that peaked in the top 10 of the Canadian Hot 100, an all-genre singles chart, during 2012. Flo Rida's \"Good Feeling\", and Maroon 5's \"Payphone\" were the longest-running top-ten singles of the year, spending twenty weeks in the tier. The former peaked at number two on the week ending January 28, 2012, and the latter peaked at number one for eight weeks beginning on the week ending June 2, 2012, becoming the longest-running number one song of the year. Following her death on February 11, 2012, singer Whitney Houston's \"I Will Always Love You\" charted in the top ten on the week ending March 3, 2012 at number six. Such re-entries of catalog songs are rare as Billboard maintains a policy deeming songs ineligible to chart due to moving to the recurrent list after twenty weeks if ranking below number fifty. After Houston's death, however, an adjustment in this policy allowed catalog songs to re-enter the chart's upper half if sales and airplay activity merit inclusion, as was the case with \"I Will Always Love You\", which surged after the singer's death in digital sales and airplay.\n\n\n== Top-ten singles ==\nKey\n ↑  – indicates single's top 10 entry was also its Canadian Hot 100 debut\n †  – indicates best performing song of the year\n(#) – 2012 year-end top 10 single position and rank\n\n\n=== 2011 peaks ===\n\n\n=== 2013 peaks ===\n\n\n== Notes ==\nA The single re-entered the top ten on the week ending January 7, 2012.\nB The single re-entered the top ten on the week ending January 14, 2012.\nC The single re-entered the top ten on the week ending February 11, 2012.\nD The single re-entered the top ten on the week ending February 25, 2012.\nE The single re-entered the top ten on the week ending March 10, 2012.\nF The single re-entered the top ten on the week ending March 17, 2012.\nG The single re-entered the top ten on the week ending March 24, 2012.\nH The single re-entered the top ten on the week ending April 21, 2012.\nI The single re-entered the top ten on the week ending May 12, 2012.\nJ The single re-entered the top ten on the week ending June 16, 2012.\nK The single re-entered the top ten on the week ending June 30, 2012.\nL The single re-entered the top ten on the week ending July 14, 2012.\nM The single re-entered the top ten on the week ending August 11, 2012.\nN The single re-entered the top ten on the week ending September 1, 2012.\nO The single re-entered the top ten on the week ending September 8, 2012.\nP The single re-entered the top ten on the week ending October 27, 2012.\nQ The single re-entered the top ten on the week ending November 10, 2012.\nR The single re-entered the top ten on the week ending November 17, 2012.\nS The single re-entered the top ten on the week ending December 15, 2012.\nT The single re-entered the top ten on the week ending December 29, 2012.\n\n\n== See also ==\n2012 in Canadian music\nList of Canadian Hot 100 number-one singles of 2012\nList of Canadian Hot 100 top-ten singles\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBillboard.com\nThe Canadian Hot 100",

        "content": "Laxman Singh is an Indian social activist and water conservationist from Lapodiya village in Jaipur, Rajasthan, known for his work in water conservation and developing water conservation techniques such as Chauka, which has helped improve the livelihoods of villagers in Rajasthan.  He is the founder of non-profit organisation Gram Vikas Nav Yuvak Mandal Lapodiya (GVNML). The Government of India awarded him the Padma Shri for his work in conserving water and protecting the environment.\n\n\n== Life and work ==\nLaxman Singh hails from a farming background. He has dedicated over four decades of his life to water conservation efforts. In 1977, at the age of 18, his journey began when he witnessed water scarcity in his village. He started restoring the village's old ponds through voluntary efforts when he saw his villagers forced to draw water from deep wells and witnessed others leaving the village for better opportunities in urban areas. Singh went on to construct numerous ponds in the village using a technique he invented known as the 'chauka system,' which helps conserve rainwater.\nThe Chauka system involves creating mud ridges to slow down water flow and enable percolation into the ground. The water then accumulates in interconnected ponds, allowing overflow to move to the next one. This method has made his village Laporia drought-proof. Singh has since spread the idea to over 200 other villages which has benefited more than 3.5 Lakh people.\nLaxman Singh founded the Gram Vikas Nav Yuvak Mandal, an NGO to engage youth in community development. He inspired about 80 youngsters to build ponds in the village and encouraged neighbouring villages to do the same.\nSingh established schools in approximately 50 villages, providing free education regardless of socio-economic status. He managed these schools from 1980 to 2006, ultimately closing them when government schools were established in these areas.\nHe also holds a bachelor's degree in Social Work from Rajasthan University.\n\n\n== Awards and recognition ==\nLaxman Singh was awarded the Loknayak Jaiprakash Award in Delhi on October 11, 2022. In 2023, he was conferred with the Padma Shri, the fourth highest civilian honor of India, in recognition of his contributions to social work.\nIn 1991, he was honored with the Nehru Youth Award by the Nehru Yuva Kendra (NYK) Sangathan, under the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, India. In 1994, he received the Indira Priyadarshini Vriksha Mitra Award from the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India. In 1998, he was elected as an Ashoka Fellow.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe 2021 documentary film, Lakshmanrekha, directed by Nandan Saxena and Kavita Bahl and produced by Public Service Broadcasting Trust and Films Division, portrays the life and work of Laxman Singh.\n\n\n== See also ==\nChauka\nGVNML\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Notophyllum foliosum is a species of annelid in the family Phyllodocidae. The species is found in the Mediterranean Sea, around the island of Madeira, and off the coasts of Scandinavia. Its habitat is the seafloor in shallow areas of 20–125 metres (66–410 ft) among gravel and stones, and occasionally near the coral Lophelia pertusa. The specific epithet \"foliosum\" comes from the Latin \"foliosus\" which refers to something leaf-like.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe species was originally described under the name Phyllodoce foliosa by Michael Sars in 1835. In 2010, the species was redefined and split in two. Previously, two color morphs of Notophyllum foliosum were known, with one found in deep water among coral, and the other in shallower areas of the seabed. The shallow form retained the name N. foliosum, but the deeper form was split off and given the new name Notophyllum crypticum. Also in 2010, an analysis of molecular phylogenetics determined that N. foliosum is closely related to Polygordius lacteus and Paramphinome jeffreysii.\n\n\n== Description ==\nNotophyllum foliosum is approximately 12 millimeters long, and has many bristly segments followed by a pygidium. It has wide dorsal cirri that overlap one another like scales. Like Nereis pelagica, the species' palps are located further back on the body than the paired antennae. At the end of its pharynx is a ring of simple papillae.\nNotophyllum foliosum has one pair of eyes attached directly to the brain. Its is similar to those of Phyllodoce species and Paranaitis wahlbergi. However, it does not possess ganglia at the bottom of its central antenna, and its front four ganglia are much smaller. The nuchal organs take the form of outgrowths called \"epaulettes\" and the nuchal ganglia are similar in structure along the length of its body. The positioning of these nuchal ganglia are similar to those of Eulalia. Each nuchal organ has four joints, which on the top side are dispersed into the front ganglion and on the bottom side into the rear ganglion.\n\n\n== Behavior and ecology ==\nFemale Notophyllum foliosum incubate their eggs underneath lamellae that are towards their rear. The eggs form a yellow gelatinous mass that are joined together to create a long ribbon-like structure, which wraps around the rear end of the annelid.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nNygren, Arne; Eklöf, Jenny; Pleijel, Fredrik (2010). \"Cryptic species of Notophyllum (Polychaeta: Phyllodocidae) in Scandinavian waters\" (PDF).

        "content": "On 28 October 2002, a school shooting occurred at the Sigma School (in Portuguese, Escola Sigma) in Salvador, capital of Bahia, Brazil. The perpetrator, a 17-year-old student only known by his initials E. R., shot two of his classmates before being turned over to authorities. \nThe episode has been remembered as one of the first cases of school shootings in Brazil. \n\n\n== Background ==\nThe private school served two hundred and fifty students in total, attending primary and secondary education.\nE. R., according to his colleagues, had been publicly ridiculed for about a month by his peers, Vanessa Carvalho Batista and Natasha Silva Ferreira (both fifteen years old) after losing points during a gymkhana at Escola Sigma, a private school in a middle-class neighborhood in Bahia. From then on, his relationship with both of them deteriorated. According to different testimonies, he was indignant because the girls gave him a low score during the sports event, and proceeded to threaten to kill them both.\n\n\n== Shooting ==\nOn the morning of Monday, October 28, E. R. arrived late at school, where classes started at 7:15 AM. When his mathematics teacher told him to present a homework assignment, he responded that he had brought his homework and then took a 38-caliber revolver from his backpack, which had been stolen from a relative in the Brazilian police force. In another report, the boy \"was given an exercise to do in the classroom\".\nAt 7:30 am, he fired four shots. One of them hit Vanessa Batista, who died instantly. After that, the minor walked six meters towards the other girl, Natasha Ferreira, and then shot her three time. Ferreira was seriously injured and was later rescued. The teenager then went to the school playground, where he remained until the arrival of the Military Police; while at the playground, he was described as being very nervous and threatening to kill himself. The Military Police asked his 21-year-old brother to negotiate his surrender, and they were able to arrest him.\n\n\n== Legal proceedings ==\nE. R., after being detained, was taken by the military police to the Adolescent Offender Police Station (DAI) for a preliminary statement in which the teenager did not reveal the reasons for his action. He was then sent to the Children's Prosecutor's Office and Youth, where it was available to the Court, which, within a maximum period of 45 days, should define the punitive measure. Due to his status as a minor at the time, his legal punishment was not revealed to the public.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nOn the day of the shooting, the school issued a note announcing the expulsion of the shooter and the suspension of afternoon classes so that students and teachers could attend the burial of student Vanessa Batista. Batista, after having her corneas donated to the Transplant Center, was buried later that day at the Jardim da Saudade Cemetery.\nFerreira, who had been shot in the head, lung and neck, was taken in serious condition to the Roberto Santos Hospital where, due to the lack of a neurologist, she was transferred to the State General Hospital where she died on the same day, at 1:30 pm. In another report, she was taken to São Rafael Hospital, where she died. \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "On 2 April 2024, a fire broke out at the Masquerade Club, in the Gayrettepe neighborhood of Beşiktaş, Istanbul, Turkey, killing at least 29 people.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe club, which was located on Gonenoglu Street, a busy area of the Gayrettepe neighbourhood, first received its operating license in 1987 and was last renewed in 2018. At the time of the fire, the club was closed for a month long renovation coinciding with Ramadan, and was scheduled to reopen on 10 April. It was located in the basement and ground level below a 16-story residential building. The building's manager said that the venue of the club was originally designed as a cinema. The club, which had a capacity of 4,000, ran a mixture of deep house and hip hop nights with live music and multiple stages.\n\n\n== Fire ==\nAccording to the city governor's office, the fire began at 12:47 (09:47 GMT) with the blaze extinguished in the late afternoon after it had reached the building's third floor. At least 29 people died in the fire, while at least eight people were injured, seven seriously. Most of the victims were construction workers doing the renovations, as well as a club DJ and a cook. Turkish media said that the lay-out of the renovated area was similar to a \"labyrinth\", which hampered escape efforts.Authorities sealed off the vicinity of the building, while around 20 fire trucks and ambulances were dispatched to the area. Electricity and gas supplies to the neighborhood were also shut off as a precaution.\n\n\n== Investigation ==\nFive people were detained after the fire, including managers of the club and one of the individuals in charge of the renovations. The Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya reported that an investigation had been opened into the fire shortly after it was extinguished. The Mayor of Istanbul, Ekrem İmamoğlu, said that the club had not applied for the proper construction permit. On 3 April, Yeni Şafak, citing fire department officials, reported that the fire was believed to have been caused by sparks from a welding machine used to install sound insulation and decoration material, which then caused an explosion that set other construction materials ablaze.\n\n\n== Reactions ==\nİmamoğlu expressed condolences to the victims of the fire. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was also briefed on the incident over a phone call by Ali Yerlikaya.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Hurtsboro Historic District is a historic district in Hurtsboro, Alabama.  Hurtsboro was founded as Hurtsville in 1858 by Joel Hurt after the Mobile and Girard Railroad was built through western Russell County.  The commercial core is centered along the railroad tracks; although all of the early frame commercial buildings were demolished by the 1960s, several 1890s–1920s buildings, including the 1890s Gin and Mill building and the circa 1910 Owens Mercantile block remain.  The Greek Revival style Joel Hurt House is the oldest house in town.  Although many of Hurtsboro's historic houses were destroyed in a 1981 tornado, a core of Greek Revival, Victorian, Bungalow, and Minimal Traditional houses remain.\nThe district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Pelomedusa galeata, commonly known as the South African helmeted terrapin and the cape terrapin, is a species of side-necked terrapin in the family Pelomedusidae. It is endemic to South Africa, Eswatini and southern Mozambique.\n\n\n== Range ==\nThe cape terrapin is found in all South African provinces, Eswatini and southern Mozambique. It is absent from the Bushmanland bioregion in the Northern Cape.\n\n\n== Description ==\nAdults average 26 cm (10 in) in straight carapace length; and up to 32.5 cm (12.8 in) in exceptional cases.\n\n\n== Habitat ==\nThe cape terrapin is found in fresh and stagnant water bodies, but not in mountainous or forested terrain.\n\n\n== Reproduction ==\nMating of the cape terrapin occurs during spring. Nesting occurs from late spring to autumn. Up to 30 eggs are laid in an 18 by 9 cm (7.1 by 3.5 in) chamber close to the water. Incubation is roughly three months.\n\n\n== Conservation status ==\nAs of 2017, the cape terrapin has been assessed as least concern due to its widespread occurrence. The population group in western South Africa could be a candidate species.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Pelomedusa galeata at Wikimedia Commons",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Morph is a fictional superhero appearing in the animated superhero series X-Men: The Animated Series—which aired on Fox Kids from 1992 to 1997—and its revival X-Men '97, which has been streaming on Disney+ since March 2024. Introduced as a member of the X-Men, Morph sacrificed himself to save Wolverine from a Sentinel in the show's premiere. The second-season premiere would reveal that Mister Sinister found Morph's body, resurrecting and experimenting on him, turning him into his minion. By the season's finale, the X-Men help free him from Sinister's control, and take him to Muir Island to recuperate. He briefly rejoins the team in season 4, and although he succeeds in saving his teammates, realizing that he is still suffering from the mental trauma he experiences, Morph decides to leave them once more. Following the conclusion of the original series, Morph rejoined the X-Men on a permanent basis in X-Men '97, becoming part of the show's core cast. X-Men '97 sees the character dealing with the trauma of Sinister's experimentations, and trying to figure out his place on the X-Men, as well as his identity, being portrayed as non-binary.\nMorph was loosely based on the Marvel Comics character Changeling, created by Roy Thomas and Werner Roth; a minor character who had joined the X-Men and sacrificed himself in the 1960s. During development of The Animated Series, the showrunners wanted to have an X-Men member die in the premiere to set the show's serious tone, seeking out a minor X-Men member that had died in the comics. Initially, this position was to be filled by Thunderbird, but upon realizing the racist implications of killing-off their only Native American character, he was omitted early during development. Thunderbird was replaced with Changeling, who was one of the few other X-Men that had died a heroic death in the comics. Due to disputes over the DC Comics character Beast Boy, who also used the codename Changeling, the character's name was changed to Morph for the cartoon.\nInitially, Morph's death in The Animated Series' premiere was supposed to be permanent. However, due to the character's popularity with audiences—particularly with focus groups—he was resurrected and brought up in season 2. Morph's storylines in later seasons proved somewhat difficult for the writers to come up with, as his limited appearances in X-Men comics meant there were no storylines involving the character that they could adapt. X-Men '97 depicts Morph as trying to move past his trauma and discover his identity as core aspects of his character arc. The character is also depicted as non-binary, which is a decision that crew members of the original series described as aligning with their vision of the character.\nDespite his minimal appearances in The Animated Series, Morph became a fan favorite among viewers; being what led to his resurrection. Many discussions regarding the character have focused on his death in the premiere as unprecedented for a children's program of the time. Critics responded positively to Morph's storylines following his resurrection, particularly his role as a brainwashed thrall of Mister Sinister, and the depiction of his mental trauma from these events. The progression of his character in X-Men '97, particularly his depiction as non-binary, has also achieved praise from critics.\n\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n\n=== In X-Men: The Animated Series ===\nMorph was introduced in the premiere as one of the X-Men's members, using his shapeshifting abilities to act as comic relief, and having a close relationship with teammate Wolverine, who described Morph as the only one that could make him laugh. In the second part of the show's premiere, Morph gets killed while the X-Men are on a mission, sacrificing himself to save Wolverine from a Sentinel's laser blast.\nIn the second-season premiere, it was revealed that shortly after his death at the hands of the Sentinels, Morph's body was recovered by Mister Sinister, who revived and brainwashed him by placing mind control implant in his brain. Following his resurrection and due to Sinister's influence, Morph antagonizes the X-Men, blaming them for his death and abandoning him, using his shapeshifting abilities to wreak havoc. At the end of the season, thanks to Professor X's psychic assistance, Morph is able to break free from Sinister's mind control, turning a laser that was meant to kill Cyclops on Sinister instead. Following these events, Morph was taken back to the X-Mansion, where he had the implant removed from his brain. Due to the trauma he had experienced, Morph was taken to Muir Island and get therapy by Moira MacTaggert, which limited his appearances throughout the remained of the series.\nMorph briefly rejoined the X-Men in a season 4 episode, having a significant role. Despite Moira's belief he needs more time to recover, Morph goes back to the X-Mansion, where shortly after his arrival, he and Wolverine go to investigate a factory robbery; unbeknownst to them that it manufactures Sentinels. After returning at the mansion, the team is attacked by Sentinels, causing Morph to freeze up and inadvertently let Professor X be captured. Hoping to make up for his mistake, Morph flies to the location of Professor X, helping his teammates, and destroying Master Mold. Despite overcoming his fears, realizing he's not ready to permanently rejoin them, Morph leaves the X-Men once more.\nMorph makes a final appearance in the series' finale, impersonating Professor X, who had been attacked and was dying. During these events, Morph permanently rejoins the X-Men.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\n\n=== Creation and progression in X-Men: The Animated Series ===\nAccording to executive story editors Eric and Julia Lewald, during the development of X-Men: The Animated Series, the crew wanted an X-Men member to die in the pilot, in order to show that \"there were stakes to their struggle\". Series director and producer Larry Houston similarly described how early in the show's development, they wanted to kill off a character to \"do something different [and] unique\" from other animated programmes of the period, and to show that \"there are ramifications for things going on in [X-Men: The Animated Series]\". Head writer Mark Edward Edens also stated that the show's writers \"really wanted to kill somebody\", describing it as \"what animation writers always dream of\"; concerning the decision to kill off a character early on, Edens further clarified that the crew \"want[ed] there to be real danger and nothing is more real than that [killing a character off]\", which also helps \"ramp up the emotions\".\nInitially, this position was to be filled by John Proudstar / Thunderbird, who had joined the X-Men in Giant-Size X-Men (1975) but died shortly thereafter in Uncanny X-Men #95 (1975). However, before the pilot's second draft, it was decided that killing off their only Native American character would have negative implications, so it was decided to replace him with another character. According to the Lewalds, they specifically looked for a \"minor character\" that \"had actually died helping the X-Men\". Searching through the comics for any X-Men members that had died, Eric Lewald describes how there were \"only like, three or four\" such characters, with Changeling being one of the few. Upon discovering Changeling, they opted to use him as the X-Men member that dies. It has been noted that the show's interpretation of the character was loosely based on his comic book counterpart, with Variety writer Jordan Moreau even describing him as \"an original character, based partly on the comic-book hero Changeling\".\nChangeling first appeared in Uncanny X-Men #35 (1967), by Roy Thomas and Werner Roth, as an adversary of the X-Men and member of Factor Three. In Uncanny X-Men #65 (1970) it was revealed that Changeling, suffering from a terminal illness and wanting to make amends for his past actions, had joined the X-Men under the guise of Professor X, in order to allow the latter to prepare for the Z'nox Invasion. This retcon established that Changeling had died in the form of Professor X in 1968, making him the first X-Men member to die in the line of duty, Unlike other character from the X-Men franchise, Changeling has remained dead, only making sporadic appearances as a ghost or zombie.\nAccording to Houston, the character's name was changed from Changeling to Morph due to the DC Comics character Beast Boy, who also has shape-shifting abilities. At the time of the show's development, Beast Boy had been a core member of The New Teen Titans under the codename Changeling, resulting in Marvel lawyers demanding that their character's codename being altered; eventually settling on Morph.\nRegarding the use of Changeling / Morph as the X-Man that dies in the premiere of The Animated Series, Comic Book Resources writer Ryan Bradley argued that owing to the character's death more than 30 years prior to the show's premiere, using him as the sacrificial X-Men member ensured that he could be killed off \"without upsetting the hardcore fans\", while fellow CBR writer Brandon Zachary recognized that his minor role in the comics made him \"more or less a blank slate [for the writers] to play with\".\nMorph's death in the show's premiere was supposed to be permanent, but due to his popularity with audiences, Fox Kids demanded that the character be brought back. Specifically, according to a focus group that had viewed the first season, Morph was described as the younger viewers' favorite character, and they lamented that he had been \"killed him off early in episode two\". Eric and Julia Lewald has stated that due to Morph's death initially being permanent, with his resurrection occurring due to the network's demands, they \"may not have been thinking of him as much for stories\" in comparison to other X-Men characters. They further stated that due to the character's minor role in the comics, with none of the major story arcs featuring him, it was difficult to find any stories to adapt that featured him.\n\n\n=== Evolution in X-Men '97 ===\nMorph's involvement in the revival series X-Men '97 was revealed at the San Diego Comic-Con (SDCC) in July 2022. At the panel, it was revealed by creator Beau DeMayo that Morph would be depicted as non-binary and use they/them pronouns, as well as sporting an altered appearance. Morph now has light gray skin, a bald head, white eyes, and no nose, based on the appearance of his counterpart from the Exiles universe. At SDDC 2023, it was confirmed that Morph would officially rejoin the X-Men and be part of the show's main cast. DeMayo, a fan of The Animated Series, described Morph's death as \"really set[ting] the stakes\" and acknowledged the character having a \"very interesting relationship with the team because of trauma\". DeMayo described the show's depiction of Morph as being a \"lighter take on the character\" compared to the original series, as well as having an \"interesting buddy relationship with Wolverine\".\nFor X-Men '97, J. P. Karliak replaces Rubin as Morph's voice actor. Regarding Morph's position among the X-Men and his role at the beginning of the series, Karliak described the character as trying to figure out his relationship to the rest of his teammates, as well as himself, following all the trauma he has endured. Karliak acknowledged that Morph as a character that has experienced much trauma, both physical and psychological, which he tries to mask with humour. Concerning his performance, Karliak stated that he didn't try to sound too familiar to Rubin; knowing during casting that Morph would be non-binary, he opted to use his own voice, in order to ground the character closer to reality.\nAlthough Morph is depicted as non-binary within X-Men '97, he is not identified as such on-screen, due to the series being set in the 1990s when the term \"non-binary\" wasn't very well known. Moreover, Morph continues to use he/him pronouns within the series. Regarding Morph's development in the series as a non-binary individual, director Jake Castorena described this approach to the character as \"mak[ing] sense\", given his shapeshifting abilities. Castorena also described Morph's altered physical appearance in the series as representing his attempt to move past the trauma he endured at the hands of Mister Sinister, and that his \"identity is to have multiple identities\". Concerning Morph's depiction as non-binary, both Houston and Eric Lewald have stated that this portrayal aligns with their original intentions for the character.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== X-Men: The Animated Series ===\nMorph has often been acknowledged for being a \"fan-favorite\" character from X-Men: The Animated Series, being described as such by Nick Nafpliotis of AIPT Comics, as well as Variety's Jordan Moreau, who recognized that Morph's popularity with audiences is what led to his resurrection; Moreau also described his death in the premiere as a \"shocking twist\". James Whitbrook of Gizmodo described Morph's death in the series' premiere as helping him achieve popularity. Screen Rant's Shaurya Thapa notes that despite his brief tenure, Morph \"emerged as one the most popular characters of X-Men: The Animated Series\", primarily for his sense of humor and shapeshifting abilities, which made him popular with audiences. Writing for SlashFilm, Ethan Anderton, who grew up watching the cartoon, states that Morph was a popular character among fellow viewers of the series. Prior to the premiere of the revival series X-Men '97, Robert Curran of CBR hoped that Morph would return, stating that it would \"be a shame if Morph was completely persona non grata\". GameRant writer Joshua Kristian McCoy similarly hoped Morph would have a role in X-Men '97, praising his presence as comic relief and friendship with Wolverine.\nThapa also praised Morph role as Mister Sinister's thrall during the show's second season, arguing that his more morally gray personality helped make him a more layered character, in contrast to his earlier humorous demeanor. Nafpliotis similarly recognized that Morph's death and resurrection under Sinister's control was a \"dark\" storyline. Concerning his storyline with Sinister, Polygon writer Carli Velocci noted that Morph had a \"surprisingly complex arc throughout later seasons\" following his resurrection, giving particular praise to his role in season 4, which displays the mental trauma he has experienced after his encounter with the Sentinels; Velocci describes it as a \"pretty sensitive portrayal of trauma, especially for a 1990s kids' cartoon\". CBR's Renaldo Matadeen similarly commended Morph's \"mental health arc\", especially his dealing with PTSD in season 4, describing it as one that \"many fans related to and sympathized with\".\n\n\n=== X-Men '97 ===\nPolgyon's Velocci described the depiction of Morph as non-binary in X-Men '97 as logical, acknowledging that shapeshifters in fiction often change into various genders. While Gizmodo' Whitbrook was somewhat critical of the decision to make Morph non-binary, the character with \"a visible mutation\", instead of another more human-presenting character, did praise the inclusion of openly queer character within the cast of the series. Bill Desowitch of IndieWire responded positively to this development, praising the series' \"greater celebration of queer diversity\".\nMorph's status as non-binary caused some controversy prior to X-Men '97's premiere, being decried as \"woke\" by some comic-centric websites and YouTube channels, alongside posts on social media. Many X-Men fans defended the decision, arguing that the franchise and mutants have often been used as metaphors the Civil rights movement and other social issues. Screen Rant's Kai Young described the criticism aimed at Morph being non-binary as \"ridiculous\", given that various X-Men characters are openly queer, and the X-Men have been used as allegories for LGBT issues.\n\n\n=== Merchandise ===\nAs part of the Marvel Legends imprint \"VHS/'90s X-Men Animated Series\", Hasbro released a figure of Morph in 2022. The figure came packaged with two separate heads, to portray both his good and evil counterparts.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "West Coast House Party is an album by the American musician Kid Ramos, released in 2000. It was nominated for a W. C. Handy Award for best contemporary blues album. Ramos's third solo album, West Coast House Party was released through Evidence Music. Ramos supported it with a North American tour.\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe album was recorded over two days in February 2000. Junior Watson, Clarence \"Gatemouth\" Brown, Duke Robillard, and Charlie Baty were among the many guest musicians who contributed to the recording sessions. Stephen Hodges played drums. Janiva Magness contributed backing vocals; her husband wrote \"Happy Hour\". Kim Wilson sang and played harmonica on \"Real Gone Lover\". \"Love Don't Love Nobody\" is a cover of the Roy Brown song. \"House Party\" was written by Amos Milburn. Ramos included a short history of jump blues in the album liner notes.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nThe Pittsburgh Post-Gazette praised the \"swinging, danceable tracks that infuse new life into a classic blues style.\" The Austin Chronicle concluded that \"everyone seems to be having a good time, playing and singing enthusiastically, and they're technically competent artists, but only the 76-year-old Brown is an original stylist.\" The Fort Worth Star-Telegram labeled the songs \"danceable delights,\" and advised to \"forget the new Brian Setzer and buy this instead.\" The Philadelphia Inquirer deemed the album \"a delicious slab of greasy, horn-drenched jump-blues and R&B.\" The Times noted the return to \"jump blues and boogies.\" The Virginian-Pilot said, \"although no virtuoso, the Kid is adept at all styles, playing throughout the session with taste, economy and verve.\"\nAllMusic called the album \"a consistently exciting and joyously well-performed disc of upbeat jump blues, played with a one-take intensity that's contagious.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

It is white with two alternating broad ashy or brown zones. The outer lip and the columellar folds are whitish. The shell contains five convex whorls, separated by impressed and narrowly channelled sutures. The surface is sculptured throughout with spiral equidistant conspicuously punctate grooves, the raised intervals smooth except for a fine engraved line along the middle of each. There are about 26 grooves on the body whorl. The aperture measures two-fifths to two-thirds of the length of the shell. The ovate columella is strongly twisted with a spiral fold above and is obliquely truncated at base. The base of the shell is rounded.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nThis  species occurs in the Pacific Ocean off the western coasts of Canada, US and Mexico; also in the Atlantic Ocean off Brazil.\nFossils have been found in Pliocene strata in San Diego Bay.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nTurgeon, D., Quinn, J.

        "content": "You Can't Name Your Own Tune is an album by drummer Barry Altschul. His first release as a leader, it was recorded on February 8 and 9, 1977, at Rosebud Studio in New York City, and was issued later that year by Muse Records. On the album, Altschul is joined by saxophonist and flutist Sam Rivers, trombonist George Lewis, pianist Muhal Richard Abrams, and double bassist and cellist Dave Holland.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nIn a review for AllMusic, Scott Yanow wrote: \"the highlights of this excellent album are the... selections that feature interplay between Sam Rivers... and trombonist George Lewis. Lewis in particular has rarely been heard in this type of relatively straightforward (if still adventurous) setting and really excels.\"\nSteve Holtje, co-editor of MusicHound Jazz, stated: \"this record shows how Altschul's best music combines characteristics from across jazz history while sounding thoroughly modern, and his writing and the players' solos are both at a very high level here. Abrams plays some of the best piano of his distinguished career, in fact.\"\nPianist and composer Ethan Iverson called the album \"an incredibly listenable session of the finest exponents of this rather hectic style,\" and commented: \"This is a one-off quintet, but everyone brings their A-game. In some ways it could pair with the early Tony Williams quintet session Spring, also with Sam Rivers. In both cases the drummer decides which directions an 'out' date should take, with notably stylish results.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"You Can't Name Your Own Tune\" (Barry Altschul) – 7:52\n\"For Those Who Care\" (Barry Altschul) – 4:53\n\"Natal Chart\" (Barry Altschul) – 3:42\n\"Cmbeh\" (Muhal Richard Abrams) – 6:13\n\"Hey Toots!\" (Barry Altschul) – 5:07\n\"King Korn\" (Carla Bley) – 4:40\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nBarry Altschul – drums, percussion, gong, waterphone\nSam Rivers – tenor saxophone, soprano saxophone, flute\nGeorge Lewis – trombone\nMuhal Richard Abrams – piano\nDave Holland – double bass, cello\n\n\n== References ==",

The Valley is known for it's large number of caves and rock structures. Settlements along the river include Kemulta, where the Keshelta merges into the Patsa, Kotano, Sokhta and Nazigini, where the Saritata River merges into the Patsa. The river then continues to Bakhuta, Siukata, Ugardanta, Shikhanturi and  Fatsa before it merges into the Liakhvi River at Didi Gupta. \n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1892 a German engineer surveyed the Patsa river valley as a route for a imperial railroad, although the route was ultimately never constructed.\nIn 1991 an earthquake caused a landslide in the Patsa River Valley which resulted in the Patsa being dammed for 10 years. The degrading barrier lake eventually naturally transitioned into an alluvial barrier basin by 2001 allowing the free flow of the river again.\nThe bridge across the Patsa at Didi Gupta is one of the most important pieces of infrastructure in South Ossetia, as it is the only connection from Java to Tskhinvali. As such, during both the 1991 and 2008 wars, the Georgian army targeted the bridge, since it was the only route for the Russian army to reach Tskhinvali and the rest of Georgia from South Ossetia.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Talib bin Haji Hamzah (c. 1953 – 28 January 1977) was a Malaysian-born soto seller and member of a notorious armed robbery gang who was responsible for at least two firearm robberies between September and December 1974. Talib, who fled to Malaysia along with his five other gang members, was arrested during the same month he committed the second robbery, and he was extradited back to Singapore for trial. Talib was charged under the Arms Offences Act for being an accomplice in a firearm offence, which warranted the death penalty if found guilty. Although Talib claimed that he was threatened by his leader (who committed suicide in 1974) into joining and committing the robberies, Talib's defence was rejected and he was therefore found guilty and sentenced to death on 1 October 1975. Talib, who was executed by hanging on 28 January 1977, was the first person to be handed the death penalty for being an accomplice of a firearm offence under the Arms Offences Act in Singapore's legal history.\n\n\n== Background and criminal conduct ==\nTalib bin Haji Hamzah was born in Malaya (present-day Malaysia) sometime in 1953, and his hometown was located in Batu Pahat within the Malaysian state of Johor. During his adulthood, Talib worked as a soto seller.\nAt one point after reaching adulthood, Talib became a member of the \"Botak\" gang, a notorious gang of six armed robbers who were behind a spate of firearm robberies that happened in Singapore between March and December 1974. The gang was led by an infamous fugitive and Malaysian gunman named Jamaluddin bin Abu Bakar. Jamaluddin, who was previously jailed for seven years at Changi Prison, was wanted by the Singaporean authorities for the murder of a shopkeeper at a Geylang goldsmith shop on 23 January 1974. Jamaluddin, who was one of the two killers behind the case, fled to Malaysia and therefore established his gang of robbers, in which Talib became a member. The first crime committed by the gang was at Tanglin Road in March 1974, when the robbers reaped a loot worth S$150,000 from the Tanglin jewellery shop they targeted.\nOn 17 September 1974, Talib and his four gang members robbed a jewellery shop Nam Yick Jewellers at North Bridge Road and held the owner Poon Cheok Meng on gunpoint, and made off with over valuables worth S$30,000 on a hijacked taxi. On 9 December 1974, Talib and his gang once again committed firearm robbery at Arab Street, where they robbed another jewellery shop Mandarin Jewellers and made off with a loot of jewellery worth S$118,539 in total. Each time after the robbery attempt, Talib and his accomplices escaped to Malaysia and went into hiding at Johor Bahru in spite of the extensive manhunts conducted by the Singaporean police, before they sneaked back into Singapore to commit another crime. During the second robbery attempt, one of Talib's accomplices had also fired seven shots at a Cisco guard, and all missed the guard.\n\n\n== Arrest and charges ==\nAfter committing the second firearm robbery, Talib bin Haji Hamzah and the rest of the Botak gang evaded the Singaporean authorities and once again successfully fled to Malaysia. However, merely two days later, the law caught up with them.\nOn 11 December 1974, the Royal Malaysia Police managed to trace the Botak gang to their hiding place in the Lumba Kuda flats at Johor Bahru. The Malaysian police, coupled with officers of the Singapore Police Force, arrived at the flats, where Talib, the Botak gang headman Jamaluddin and their other four fellow gang members (whose identities remain unknown) were hiding, and they ordered the gang to surrender. However, a gunfight ensued between the officers and Jamaluddin, who refused to surrender even after tear gas had been fired into the flats. Eventually, Jamaluddin was trapped inside the area but before the police could arrest him, 27-year-old Jamaluddin bin Abu Bakar turned his Browning automatic pistol on himself and died from a sole gunshot wound to the left temple. Jamaluddin was found with his pistol in one hand and a grenade on the other hand when the police recovered his corpse.\nSoon after the death of Jamaluddin, Talib and two Botak gang members surrendered themselves to the police while the final two members managed to evade the authorities and escaped. The last two members were eventually arrested within the following week, and over S$100,000 worth of jewellery were recovered by the police.\nFollowing arrangements between the Malaysian and Singaporean authorities, in January 1975, Talib was extradited back to Singapore to be investigated for his involvement in the gang robberies committed by the Botak gang. Talib was charged with two counts of being an accomplice of firearm robbery, an offence which mandated the death sentence under the Arms Offences Act if found guilty. Talib was, to date, the sole member of the Botak gang to be extradited and face trial in Singapore for the crimes they committed in the city-state. At the time of Talib's indictment, the Arms Offences Act was enacted for only two years and it was implemented to impose harsh punishments (including death) to curb the escalating rate of gun violence rate in Singapore back in the 1970s.\n\n\n== Death penalty trial ==\nOn 20 August 1975, 22-year-old Talib bin Haji Hamzah claimed trial at the High Court for two counts of being an accomplice of firearm robbery under the Arms Offences Act. Talib, who pleaded not guilty to both charges, was represented by state-assigned lawyer Abdul Rashid while the prosecution was led by Loh Lin Kok, and the trial was presided by two trial judges - Justice Dennis Cosmos D'Cotta (D C D'Cotta) and Justice Thilliampalam Kulasekaram (T Kulasekaram). Another two charges of firearm robbery tendered against Talib for his other offences were temporarily stood down during the trial proceedings.\nDuring the trial itself, the prosecution called upon witnesses, mainly those who were victims of the two robberies, to testify about the crimes that happened at the respective shops. In the first case, Poon Wai Kong, the son of Poon Cheok Meng, who was the owner of Nam Yick Jewellers (the same shop where the first robbery happened), appeared as a witness, and he testified that on the afternoon of 17 September 1974, when he was behind the showcase, he heard gunshots and he saw five men barging in the shop to commit robbery, and one of them acted as look-out while the rest went to grab the jewellery. Poon said that when his 61-year-old father appeared, one of the robbers aimed the gun at his father's head and fired twice, but fortunately for the old man, no bullets came out, and so, the robbers fled after Poon's father raised an alarm, and they left in a taxi.\nAs for the second case, 37-year-old Leow Han Chuah, the managing director of Mandarin Jewellers (the same shop where the second robbery took place), also appeared as a witness and he testified that at the time, he was present in the shop with six other employees when at least four robbers (including Talib) had entered the shop, threatened them on gunpoint and took the jewelry. Leow also testified that he heard gunshots coming from outside his shop. Other facts revealed that these gunshots were made during the robbers' escape attempt; the first was when one of them fired the gun at a taxi driver, ordering him to drive them to another area while hijacking the taxi, and the other two were fired when Cisco guard Idros bin Abu Bakar, who heard the first gunshot, arrived to witness the gang hijacking the taxi and it led to one of the robbers discharging the gun at Idros, who was not hurt from the shoot-out. Two police inspectors, Quek Kah Pok and Joseph Lau Cher Thiam, also testified that they found spent catridges from a gun when inspecting both the crime scenes in September and December 1974 respectively.\nHowever, during the course of the trial, Talib alleged that his statement was not fully made out of voluntariness, as he was allegedly told by the Inspector Joseph Lau that he better make a statement before the magistrate in exchange for a lighter sentence. It was further revealed in court that Inspector Lau had only two years of experience as a police inspector, but the prosecution did not agree with Talib's contention even though they said the inspector actually informed Talib that he would record a statement. Subsequently, after a trial within a trial, the statement given by Talib was ruled inadmissible as evidence in court, but it did not affect the strength of the prosecution's case, and the trial court ruled that there was a case for Talib to answer, urging Talib to put up his defence.\nAt the close of the prosecution's case, Talib elected to not give his defence under oath, and instead, he chose to give an unsworn statement from the dock. In his unsworn testimony, Talib recounted that he did not voluntarily took part in the two robberies. Talib claimed that it was Jamaluddin who lured him into committing the first robbery, and it was agreed during a meeting that the guns could only be used to fire warning shots instead of causing injury to anyone, and Jamaluddin also threatened Talib to join in the second robbery, claiming that he would be killed if he did not help them commit the crime. Talib also testified that he was never armed in both instances of robbery. The defence also argued that Talib was not a hardcore criminal and he was incapable of making any reasonable steps to prevent the use of firearms based on his state of mind at the material time, but the prosecution refuted Talib's account as improbable and highly unsatisfactory, stating that it was clear that there was premeditation to use the guns to commit robbery and furthermore, to cause hurt if necessary, and there was a plan and intent to rob the jewelers in these two cases, and it was not possible for Talib to be enticed to join the first robbery bid on promises of wealth on one hand while joining the second robbery attempt for fear of his life on the other hand.\nOn 1 October 1975, after a trial lasting eight days, Justice T Kulasekaram and Justice D C D'Cotta delivered their verdict, with Justice Kulasekaram pronouncing their joint decision in court. Justice Kulasekaram stated that after careful consideration of the facts, he and Justice D'Cotta unanimously determined that Talib had not raised a reasonable doubt over the prosecution's case, and they found there was sufficient evidence to prove that Talib was a willing accomplice to the firearm robberies, in which guns were used to commit robbery and fired with intent to cause harm, and thus rejected Talib's account. Therefore, 22-year-old Talib bin Haji Hamzah was found guilty of two counts of being an accomplice of a firearm robbery under Section 5 of the Arms Offences Act, and sentenced to death by hanging. Talib was the first person to be handed the death penalty for being an accomplice of a firearm offence under the Arms Offences Act.\nTalib's sentencing came merely a month after the sentencing trial of Sha Bakar Dawood, an infamous gunman who became the overall first criminal to be convicted under the Arms Offences Act. Sha Bakar, who went by the alias Bakar Negro, was sentenced to death for shooting at three people during an armed hold-up at a brothel near Thiam Siew Avenue in 1975. Sha Bakar, who later lost his appeals, was eventually hanged at dawn on 3 September 1976, therefore becoming the first person to be hanged under the Arms Offences Act since 1973.\n\n\n== Appeals ==\nBy February 1976, Talib bin Haji Hamzah filed a notice of appeal against his conviction and sentence. In April 1976, the appeal was heard before the Court of Appeal, with veteran lawyer and opposition politician David Saul Marshall arguing that Talib should not be held liable to the charges preferred against him under the Arms Offences Act due to the minor role he played and he was not responsible for the injuries caused or attempted during the shoot-out, and that the trial court did not make correct findings on whether Talib had reasonable knowledge that firearms would be used during the commission of robbery in both cases he was tried for. This was rebutted by the prosecutor Loh Lin Kok, who said that Talib's association with the gunmen should also lead to the inference that he reasonably expected the potential use of firearms during the robbery bids pulled off by his gang.\nOn 18 May 1976, after reserving judgement for about a month, the appellate court's three judges - Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin and two Supreme Court judges Frederick Arthur Chua (F A Chua) and Choor Singh - dismissed Talib's appeal and upheld his two death sentences and double conviction under the Arms Offences Act, after they rejected the defence's submissions and found that there was premeditation and planning through the decision to bring firearms to commit robbery and it was reasonable to infer that Talib had the knowledge that the guns would be used during the robberies, and he thus should be held responsible for the role he played in these cases.\nIn October 1976, Talib filed a motion to seek special leave to appeal to the Privy Council in London for a review of his conviction and sentence. However, the Privy Council rejected Talib's appeal and therefore confirmed the death penalty in Talib's case.\n\n\n== Execution ==\nAt the age of 23, Talib bin Haji Hamzah was hanged in Changi Prison on the Friday morning of 28 January 1977. On the same date of Talib's execution, a convicted murderer named Nadarajah Govindasamy was put to death for the cold-blooded murder of his daughter's fiancé Mohamed Azad Mohamed Hussein back in November 1974. Nadarajah, a Hindu devotee who disapproved of his daughter's engagement with Mohamed Azad (due to the victim being a Muslim), was sentenced to hang in August 1975 for the crime and like Talib, he also lost his appeals to the Court of Appeal and Privy Council prior to his execution.\nAt the time of his execution, Talib was the second person to be executed under the Arms Offences Act since 1973, and this status was confirmed in 1979 when three gunmen - Lee Keng Guan, Wong Loke Fatt and Ho Joo Huat - were hanged on 11 May of that same year for a firearm robbery back in 1974.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSha Bakar Dawood\nArms Offences Act\nCapital punishment in Singapore\nList of major crimes in Singapore\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"Natanael Cano: Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 59\" (also titled as \"Endiamantado\") is a song by Argentine DJ Bizarrap and Mexican singer Natanael Cano. It was released on 3 April 2023 through Dale Play, as part of the former's \"Bzrp Music Sessions\" series. The session was released along with another song titled \"Entre las de 20\".\n\n\n== Background and release ==\nIn 2021, prior to the release of his 47th music session with Spanish rapper Morad, Bizarrap said in an interview with Billboard that he wanted to collaborate with Natanael Cano on a music session and had already spoken to him. After both of them met, they began recording the music session in 2021, but it had multiple changes by 2022 and therefore was not released after. During an Instagram live video, Bizarrap said that there were \"a thousand\" versions of the session, where some lyrics had to be changed.\nFollowing his 58th session with Young Miko, as well as several leaks, he would announce his 59th music session where Natanael Cano would be featured. Prior to the announcement, it was speculated that both would collaborate since Bizarrap congratulated Cano on his 23rd birthday and Cano shared a photo with him on the same day.  The session was released on 3 April 2024, along with a surprise track titled \"Entre las de 20\"; both tracks were released as separate singles, and were also formed as a 2-track EP.\n\n\n== Composition ==\nThe music session is a Latin trap song, with elements of acoustic guitar. Lyrically, Cano calls out the Mexican government for the criticism of corridos tumbados, saying that if they have a problem, he would \"leave in his jet.\" Cano also makes references to Mexican drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero. The song also contains vocals by Alexis Fierro, a songwriter in the genre well known as El Chachito, who also co-wrote the music session.\n\n\n== Music video ==\nIts music video was released on the same day of the single's release. The video is split in two chapters; \"Endiamantado\" is the music session and \"Entre las de 20\" is a surprise track.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Microglyphis perconica is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Ringiculidae.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe length of the shell attains 5 mm, its diameter 3 mm.\n(Original description) The shell is pear-shaped or conic. Its spire is rather acute, polished ivory white. It contains four whorls beside the protoconch. The transverse sculpture consists of incremental lines. The spiral sculpture consists of three to five close-set, sharp, punctate grooves in front of the suture, more distant anteriorly, and a similar but more numerous and uniformly spaced series just behind the columella, behind which again are four or five widely separated similar grooves, the posterior near the periphery. Between them and near the periphery, as well as behind it, are no grooves or but faint spiral obsolete striae. The suture is distinct but not channelled. The body whorl is much the largest. The outer lip is straight, simple and slightly thickened. The body of the shell has a moderate deposit of callus. The columella is as in Microglyphis curtula (Dall, 1890), but is less strongly twisted and with the plait and recurved margin subequal. Although the margin is continuous, there is a rather deep sulcus behind the anterior end of the columella, corresponding to a groove, which bounds the columella callus.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nThis marine species occurs off the Galápagos Islands.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

It has a perimeter of 836.8 meters and walls that stand 12 meters tall. The construction materials used in the fort include mud bricks, burnt bricks, mud mortar, and cheroli, a type of lime plaster.\nThe main entrance of the fort features a four-centered arch, which leads to four chambers that were likely used by guards. The fort also has 12 bastions distributed along its walls.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "The Koli rebellion (Hindi: कोली विद्रोह) (Gujarati: કોળી વિપ્લવ) (also called as Koli revolt, Koli rising, Koli uprising, Koli Insurrection and Koli mutiny) was war of resistance against British government , Maratha and Mughal empires in India. Koli is a caste of India and Pakistan which is mostly found in the Indian States of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Himachal Pradesh and Sindh province of Pakistan. Here are a series of revolts of Koli caste in inhabited areas.\n\n\n== British Indian Empire ==\n\n\n=== Kheda of Gujarat ===\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century, Kolis posed a serious \"law and order\" problem for the new government of East India Company, British officials to declare that kolis are one of the most \"turbulent, predatory tribes in India\". Many Kolis resided in villages outside the EIC's territorial jurisdiction but viewed the imposition of new legislation and colonization in the territory as a direct challenge to established local customs.\nKoli chieftains and their peasant supporters were threatened by the British government settling the agricultural plains and establishing new modes of governance in the area. In protest, some Koli zamidars filed petitions in the Court (Adalat) in Kheda, stating that, according to local custom, the government had no authority over Kolis. Other chieftains simply ignored the authority of the EIC and organized peasant raids into towns and villages in British territory, claiming a customary right to plunder villages as a form of their own tax collection, or a levy called giras. The district magistrate responded by stating such actions were \"evil\" and perpetuated by Koli chieftains.\nBy 1808, Koli chieftains had begun organizing raids into towns and villages in the territory controlled by the EIC, to steal crops and other possessions. The town of Dholka and its neighboring villages became favorite targets. Dholka was in the northern borderlands of British territory, adjacent to land controlled by the chieftains. Groups of armed kolis, numbering between fifty and a hundred Kolis, easily entered Dholka and returned to their respective villages without difficulty. British officials lacked the manpower and local knowledge of the terrain to capture these men. However, there were instances when a chieftain was arrested and jailed for leading attacks on Dholka, as in the case of Bachur Khokani. On 20 February 1808, within a few days of Khokani's capture, a group of fifty Kolis stormed the jail and released their leader. Policemen were killed and six were wounded in the battle, and apparently, on the very same night, Khokani and his men organized another raid on the town.\nIn an attempt to prevent further raids on Dholka, Kheda's magistrate, R. Holford, coordinated a plan that required local elites within the EIC's control to capture the raiders. Holford recognized the limitations of the EIC's power to arrest individuals residing outside its control, but he believed that British officials could force the elites who had villages within their legal jurisdiction to cooperate. The outcome of the official strategy had some success: in 1810, large numbers of Kolis had been arrested and convicted of crimes against the East India Company. Judge H. W. Diggle recommended that the prisoners to be transported to the British colony the Prince of Wales Island (formerly called Penang), or to a distant jail, for a minimum of seven years. It was argued that such an extreme measure would \"overawe\" and \"check the daring and ferocious nature\" of Kolis while simultaneously serving as a deterrent for others. However, as in the case of Bachur Khokani, a group of four hundred to five hundred armed men descended upon the jail at Kheda and released the imprisoned Kolis. Most of the prisoners dispersed into areas outside of British jurisdiction and were saved just days before being transported to the Prince of Wales Island. The raids continued in Dholka, and colonial officials urged the EIC to increase the size of the police force in Kheda. In addition, officials requested the support of soldiers from neighboring Baroda State, who were supposed to have local intelligence networks in the borderlands that could be used for recapturing the convicted Kolis and their accomplices. But the outcome of using greater force had a minimal impact on what had developed into a serious law and order problem for the EIC. Colonial officials were not able to prevent Koli rebels. Earlier attempts to press chieftains to cooperate in preventing attacks on government towns and villages had limited results.\nIn 1824, A. Crawford, the district collector of neighboring Ahmedabad, suggested that a new strategy be adopted, including forcibly taking the possessions of Koli chieftains suspected of participating in the attacks or simply having any information about them. In addition, Crawford introduced the idea of using the military to destroy villages where Koli chieftains were hiding. This strategy marked an important departure from the policy of not entering areas that lay outside the jurisdiction of the EIC with the intention of using military force to capture chieftains or other raiders. However, the idea of completely destroying villages as a way to create \"future peaceable conduct\" did not prevent Kolis from challenging the authority and legitimacy of the EIC, and certainly it did not eliminate the armed excursions into British-controlled territory. In fact, it further intensified the demands of those Kolis who had been claiming that their customs and privileges were being violated by colonial officials.\nThe raids continued through the 1830s with some regularity. Crawford to British officials, \"Some special regulations should be made about the Kolis. No measures of ordinary severity have any effect. We never hear of a reformed Koli, or of one whose mode of life places him beyond suspicion. All seem alike, rich and poor, those whose necessities afford them an excuse for crime and those whose condition places them out of the reach of distress, are alike ready on the first opportunity to plunder. But by the 1840s, the application of colonial policies and the use of military force led to the subsidence of Koli attacks in British-controlled territory. Officials argued that the character of all Kolis-chieftains and peasants had improved, as many kolis had taken up settled agriculture and become hardworking and peaceable. Despite this acknowledgment of the transformation among the Kolis, the early-nineteenth-century encounters continued to influence the implementation of official policies in the district. In begin of 1857 and 1858, the government imposed regulations restricting Kolis from carrying weapons in Kheda district but kolis again raised.\n\n\n=== Khanpur of Gujarat ===\nIn July 1857, the Kolis of Maliwad clan in Khanpur of Lunavada State challenged the British rule under their leader Surajmal after death of surajmal, kolis again raised and attacked the British troops under new koli chieftain Jivabhai Thakor of Khanpur.\nIn December 1857, Captain Buckle attacked the Khanpur and captured some of the rebels and rest escaped to nearby hills and forests. They gathered again and attacked the British troops with more vigour. Lt. Morey, Jamadar Nurmohmad, Sheikh Cheda and Emamuddin pursued the Kolis and killed some of them. Then the Kolis fled to the bushes and ravines of the river. The two kolis were shot by the order of Buckle but British army also lost three horsemen. The koli prisoners of Khanpur were transported to life, while non-koli prisoners of Khanpur were released after they witnessed the execution of their koli chieftain.\nThe Kolis paid a huge price for their resistance to British rule. They were not only defeated in battle and punished for having dared to resist. but, in the aftermath, these communities were marginalized by the rest of society as outlaws. Being arms-bearing community, they too were disarmed in early 1858 and also forced to practise agriculture. A majority of kolis were unable to adapt the lifestyle and norms of settled agriculture and were forced to give way to agriculturalist communities like Kanbi or Patidar in the latter half of the nineteenth century.\n\n\n=== Chandap of Gujarat ===\nIn September 1857, Kolis of Chandap (Chandup) raised against British rule under Koli chieftain Nathaji who led the 2000 kolis of Angar, Dubbora and Pratabpur in Mahi Kantha. the Nathaji and Yamaji was Koli brothers, rulers of Chandap and were tributary to Gaikwad of Baroda and Rao of Idar.\nOn 16 September 1857, the Maharaja Gaekwad of Baroda State issued a proclamation not to rise to the people of Chandap under the Mahikantha agency and posted the 10 horsemen but Nathaji resisted the posting of horsemen so the kolis assembled together instant and attacked the Thana of that place in which a sowar of the Gaekwad Government was killed and two wounded and property plundered. The rising of Kolis affected the law and order situation in Vijapur, Kheralu and Vadnagar Taluqas of Baroda. At the end of year, koli rebellion was crushed by the combined forces of Baroda State and British troops who destroyed the Chandap village. The kolis with stiff attitude under Nathaji continued their resistance from the hills.\n\n\n=== Peth or Peint of Maharashtra ===\nIn December 1857, Nashik district was affected by the Indian independence movement and the Peint Jagir became centre of rebellious activities. The rebel Kolis plundered the Harsol market on the sixth of December and captured the Mamlatdar. From there they attacked Peint where Koli rebels numbering about 2,000 captured the Lieutenant Glasspool and his 30 officers. The Koli Raja Bhagvantrao was suspected and arrested by British government. He was also a \"correspondent\" of Nanasaheb Peshwa. After a trial, koli king and fifteen officials were sentenced and hanged on 28 December 1857. In response, the kolis attacked at the court in Peint and then went to the Raja to pay their respects to him. Kolis plundered the treasury of Dharampur State, a comrade state of British rule. The Thane police then seized two of the leading men in the gang who plundered the treasury in the Dharampoor Raja's territory. there was resistance and one of the policemen was shot by an arrow through the chest and one of the insurgents received a bayonet-wound in the stomach. British official Mr. Boswell started disarming the kolis and suggested that a strong party of police be posted at Peint to guard the treasury and prevent the further disturbances. Later it came out that the rising of the Kolis was planned five or six weeks ago by the late Raja and the Dewan of Peint and the Rani who lived in Nashik. Kolis disliked the Disarming Act and resisted the government. On the hearing that the troops were approaching to peint, kolis withdrew to the jungle in the neighbourhood. On Thursday, the Lieutenant Glasspool arrived with troops and started operations against the insurgents. But his troops being too weak to go out and attack the Kolis in the jungle and at the same time to defend the court and the town, Lieutenant Glasspool could not take any step for nearly a week. But the glasspool was joined by Captain Nuttall's forces coming from Trimbak. On the arrival of this new force, Kolis retreated to the south. They played hide and seek for a few days. Occasional fights took place. the Kolis lacked of weapons so they dispersed and hid themselves in different villages. They were gradually traced out and caught. Many of them had migrated to the State of Dharampur where the Raja's forces caught them and handed them over to the Government officials. All the insurgents having been apprehended the rising was ultimately put down. The property of the late Raja was ordered to be annexed in British India and the revenue of his villages was ordered to be collected for Government.\n\n\n=== Surat of Gujarat ===\nDuring the Quit India Movement of Mahatma Gandhi in 1942, A large number of 3,000 Koli cultivators from Matwad, Karadi, Machhad and Kothmadi in Surat District fought against British soldiers at Matwad with lathis and dharias on 21 August 1942. In this fight, four persons including one policeman died. The kolis also snatched away four police muskets and two bayonets. Kolis smashed up the Jalalpore Railway Station, removed the Rails and burnt down the post office. After this, situation in the neighbouring villages of Borsad, Anand and Thasra taluqas became so aggravated that British troops was marched through the villages between 22 and 24 August 1942.\n\n\n== Mughal Empire ==\nThe rebellion was the imposition of land tax (Jaziya) by Sultan Aurangzeb. The Koli Zamidars had taken up arms against the Sultan Aurangzeb under the leadership of Khemirao Sarnaik, as well as with the sympathy of Shivaji as it was a great benefit to Shivaji. Khemrao assembled all the Koli naiks and promised that he would get rid of Mughal rule in a single rise. Aurangzeb sent the Mughal army from the hilly areas to suppress the Koli rebellion, but the battle was very fierce in which thousands of Kolis were killed and the Mughal soldiers also. The Koli rebellion shook Aurangzeb. Sarnaik applied for help from Shivaji but shivaji was unable to help kolis because of their political matters and sarnaik was refused. The Khemirao Sarnaik fighting in this battle was killed by mughal commander nerrulaa, but the Koli rebellion was so intense that Aurangzeb got compelled to think. after the rebellion was crushed, the kolis were treated with kindness by Aurangzeb and than kolis achieve the high reputation under Peshwa for their daring and taking hill forts such as Kanhoji Angre and Tanaji Malusare.\n\n\n=== Mughal Gujarat ===\nIn 1535, When Humayun was Governor of Gujarat, he encamped near Cambay (Khambhat). Humayun and his army was robbed and plundered by Kolis of Gujarat.\nIn 1613, Jahangir issued a sanguinary order for the extirpation of the race of the Kolis who were notorious robbers and plunders living in the most inaccessible parts of Gujarat. A large number of them Koli chiefs slaughtered and the rest hunted to their mountains and deserts. 169 heads of such Koli chiefs killed in battle by Nurulla Ibrahim, commander of 'Bollodo'.\nThe Kolis of Gujarat were most rebellious under the rule of Shah Jahan. In 1622, Shah Jahan sent Raja Vikramjit who was Governor of Gujarat to subdue the Kolis of Ahmedabad. Between 1632 and 1635, four viceroys were appointed due to they could not manage the Koli activities well. Kolis of Kankrej in North Gujarat committed excesses and the Jam of Nawanagar did not paid the tribute. Soon Azam Khan was appointed who put the province in order by subduing the Kolis. Azam Khan marched against Koli rebels, When Ázam Khán reached Sidhpur, the merchants complained bitterly of the outrages of one Kánji, a Chunvalia Koli, who had been especially daring in plundering merchandise and committing highway robberies. Ázam Khán, anxious to start with a show of vigour, before proceeding to Áhmedábád, marched against Kánji, who fled to the village of Bhádar near Kheralu, sixty miles north-east of Áhmedábád. Ázam Khán pursued him so hotly that Kánji surrendered, handed over his plunder, and gave security not only that he would not again commit robberies, but that he would pay an annual tribute of Rupees 10,000. Ázam Khán then built two fortified posts in the Koli country, naming one Ázamábád after himself, and the other Khalílábád after his son and He also made the Jam of Nawanagar surrender. The next viceroy Ísa Tarkhán carried out financial reforms. In 1644, the Mughal prince Aurangzeb was appointed as the viceroy who was engaged in religious disputes for destroying a Jain temple in Ahmedabad. Due to his disputes, he was replaced by Shaista Khan who failed to subdue Kolis. So the prince Murad Bakhsh was appointed as the viceroy in 1654. He restored the disorder soon and defeated the Koli rebels.\nIn 1719, Kolis of Mahi River were most rebellious against Mughal rule and plundering the villages, Mihir Ali Khan who was acting as Viceroy of Gujarat at the place of Ajit Singh of Marwar, marched against Koli rebels of Mahi who were committing piracy against Muslims and subdued them.\nIn 1721, Kasim Ali Khan who was an officer in Mughal Empire under Muuhammad Shah employed against the Kolis of Kheda district to collect the fine but they refused to pay and there was a battle in Pethapur between Kolis and Mughal army under Kasim Ali Khan. Kasim Ali Khan was killed by Kolis and Mughal army was defeated and retreat to base.\nIn 1722, Muhammad Bahadur, son of Salabat Khan Babi, was placed in charge of Sadra and Virpur, with the title of Sher Khan. Shortly after his arrival the viceroy marched against and subdued the rebellious Kolis of the Chunval but was wounded deeply. After that Kolis of Modhera opposed the Muhammad Shah but Modhera village was burnt down.\nIn 1729, Mughal Viceroy of Sultan Muhammad Shah faced the challenge of anti-Muslim activities of Kolis of Sorath, viceroy marches against Kolis of sorath and destroying them taken to Ahmednagar. after this, Jawan Mard Khan Babi who was Governor of Petlad ordered against rebellious Kolis of Balor, probably Bhátod about fifteen miles east of Bharuch, but Jawan Marad Khan was killed by a man of Koli tribe, and in revenge for his death the town of Balor was plundered. On the death of Jawán Mard Khan, at the request of Salabat Muhammad Khan Babi, his eldest son Kamal-ud-din Khan Babi received the districts of Sami and Munjpur and the title of Jawan Mard Khan.\nIn 1738, Sher Khan Babi was of Junagadh was appointed as governor of sorath, Babi was obliged to march against a Koli chieftain Kanji Chunvalia of Chhaniar in Chunval because Kanji opposed and resisted the mughal authority but Sher Khan Babi was bravely resisted by Kolis so Momin Khan was called with large force and Chhaniar was burned down by mughal army.\nIn 1739, Koli chieftan Jamaji of Thara, raised the Kolis of Kankrej against sultan and continually plundered the mughal territory. Jawan Marad Khan was ordered to march against the Koli chieftain but he was unable to maintain order so he requested the Fida-ud-din Khan to subdue the Kolis. After defeating the Koli chieftain, the Koli country was plundered by mughal troops.\nIn 1740, Kolis of Atarsumba, challenged the Mughal authority and refused to pay any form of tax to mughal sultan. Jawan marad khan along with his brother Zorawar Khan Babi Marched against Kolis of Atarsumba but they were strongly resisted and there was a battle but mughals defeated the Kolis and make them to pay tax. But it was not for long time, after some time, Kolis again refused to pay tax and mughal troops were sent under Abdul Hussain Khan and Vajeram burnt the three Koli villages.\nIn 1747, Rangoji a Maratha military leader returned to Áhmedábád, and Jawán Mard Khán had an interview with him a few miles from the city. Shortly after this the Kolis of Mehmudabad and Mahudha rebelled, but the revolt was speedily crushed by Sháhbáz Rohilla.\n\n\n== Maratha Empire ==\nIn 1760, the peace of Peshwa government was broken by a rising of Kolis under their Naik Javji Bamble. Javji with drew to the hills and organised a series of gang robberies, causing widespread terror and misery throughout the country. For twenty years he held out bravely, defeating and killing the generals the Peshwa's Government sent against him. At last he was so hotly pursued that, on the advice of Dhondo Gopal, the Peshwa's governor at Nasik, he surrendered all his forts to Tukoji Holkar and, through Holkar's influence, was pardoned and placed in military and police charge of a district of sixty villages with powers of life and death outlaws. In 1798, a fresh disturbance took place among the Kolis. The leader of this outbreak was Ramji Naik Bhangria, who was an abler and more daring man than his prede cessors, and succeeded in baffling all the efforts of the Government officers to seize him. As force seemed hopeless, the Government offered Ramji a pardon and gave him an important police post.\nIn 1763, the Peshwa Raghunathrao had appointed Abha Purandare who was an anti koli as Sarnaik, due to which the Chivhe Kolis revolted against the Peshwa and captured Purandar and Sinhagad forts because the Kolis did not like Abha Purandare, so Abha removed the Kolis from the fortification and posted new Kiledars, due to which the Kolis attacked and captured the forts on 7 May 1764. Five days later, Rudramal fort was also captured and presented a challenge to the Prime Minister of the Maratha Empire, Peshwa Raghunathrao. A few days later the Peshwa came to the fort to worship the deity inside the Purandar fort but the Peshwa got caught up by the Kolis. The Kolis looted all the belongings and weapons of the Peshwa and took him prisoner but released after some time. After this the Kolis started collecting revenue from the surrounding area. After this, the chief of the Kolis, Kondaji Chivhe, sent a letter to the Peshwa, in which it was written 'What now sir, what is the condition, how is the government doing, be in fun'. After reading this letter, the Peshwa felt a bit humiliated and in a fit of rage ordered the Maratha army to attack but the army could not do anything because the Kolis himselves were Subedar and had fortified the forts well and the Peshwa faced failure.  the humiliated Peshwa started taking the Kolis of Chivhe clan as captive. All those Chivhe kolis who were living in the territory of Peshwa were declared as rebels and started making captives. After this the Chivhe Kolis sent a letter to Madhavrao and explained whole matter, after this the Kolis handed over the forts to Madhavrao and the Chivahe Kolis were again handed over the fortifications.\nIn the year 1776, a large number of the Shelkande Kolis of Otur village, raised against Peshwa because of their hereditary land rights and as the Peshwa refused to do them.  Kolis assembled a revolutionary army of Shelkande and Kokate Kolis and commenced plundering the surrounding villages and doing other violent activities in the hope of obtaining redress.  In response, The Peshwa sent Maratha troops from Pune against rebel kolis and surprised them, killed and wounded many of them. The Koli leaders were consequently forced to disperse the rebels.  The government officers learned that Sattu Shelkande, chief of the insurgents, was hiding in the neighboring jungle.  The better to ensure this, they obliged him to enter into the Sunkli zamin or chain security (one Patil going security for two or three cultivators, another Patil for five or six poorer Patils, and a Deshmukh for a number of the Patils).  Hearing of the measures the government officers were adopting, moved off to another place;  this was partly for their own safety, and partly to save their friends from being harassed and punished for not fulfilling their promise of apprehending them.  After the troops retired from the jungles, the Kolis recommenced their operations.  Several seasons were passed in this way;  however when Javji Bamble was appointed as Mansabdar of Rajur he was ordered by Peshwa to prevent the rebellious activities by rebels.  Kolis did not wish to fight with Bumble because he was also a Koli by caste.  Kolis remained quiet for of four years but Kolis went again to the jungles because his hereditary rights have not been fulfilled.  The troops employed against the Shelkande Kolis and again forced them to disperse and the chiefs went to Aurangabad.  Kolis had taken an oath that they would cut off the head of Patil of Otur, unless Peshwa afforded them redress.  Nana Phadnavis who was minister in Maratha Empire declared that he would not pardon the Kolis again, as they were such a turbulent race and as no faith could be reposed in them. Nana Fadnavis detached few Brahmins disguised as Gusai, who gained information of the hiding place of Kolis and a detachment that marched to apprehend them was so fortunate as to bring them all prisoners to Junnar, where the five Kolis were executed.  Balwantrao, brother-in-law to Nana Fadnavis, was subedar of the district at the time, and it is asserted Balwantrao became very unhappy after the execution of these kolis.  Therefore, in the hope of reestablishing the happiness that he had enjoyed, he erected a temple near river in Junnar, in which was placed as the object of worship a Punah Lingh, or five stones representing the five Kolis who were executed.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===",

        "content": "The Battle of Machghara occurred on December 15, 1217, as part of the Fifth Crusade. In it, an army led by a Hungarian nobleman was ambushed and defeated in Machghara.\n\n\n== Background ==\nShortly after the failed siege of Mount Tabor, a handful of adventurous crusaders, mainly Hungarians, decided to launch a raid against the castle of Beaufort. The Hungarian leader, a certain rich nobleman named Dionysus, led a force of 500 cavalry. Arab sources claim that they were led by the Nephew of the Hungarian king, Andrew.\n\n\n== Battle ==\nThe Balian of Sidon tried to warn the Hungarians of the difficulties in the mountainous region, inhabited by mountaineers who harassed the Crusader territory of Sidon but paid no attention to it. The Hungarians set out and arrived in Machghara, located between the mountains, whose seat is approximately halfway between Sidon and Damascus. The inhabitants learned of the upcoming raid and evacuated the town. The Hungarians rested there for three days. On December 15, the Muslims attacked the Hungarians, who were taken by surprise, killing and capturing a large number of men and horses. Their leader fell prisoner.\nThose who escaped the massacre retreated towards Sidon. During the battle, the Hungarians captured a Muslim prisoner called al-Jamus, and he guided them to a safe route in exchange for his freedom, to which they agreed. However, the Crusaders entered a deep ravine, where they were chased by Muslims and slaughtered. The Hungarians executed the Muslim prisoner for his treachery. Few of the Crusaders survived the massacre. According to Abu Shama, only 3 out of 500 Crusaders survived and reached Sidon. The prisoners were then taken to Damascus.\nThe battle marked the end of the Hungarian Crusade. King Andrew began preparations to return home.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nLászló Veszprémy, The Crusade of Andrew II, King of Hungary, 1217–1218.[1]\nKenneth Setton, A History of the Crusades, Volume II: The Later Crusades, 1189–1311.[2]\nReinhold Röhricht, History of the Kingdom of Jerusalem (1100–1291) (in German).[3]\nJózsef Bánlaky: Military history of the Hungarian nation (MEK-OSZK), 0014/1149.

In the peripheral nervous system, the Remak Schwann cells are more numerous than the myelinating Schwann cells.\nThey provide metabolic support to neurons, among other functions, but as no specific genetic markers have been detailed (at least as of 2017), there is still a large gap in understanding their biology in separation of other Schwann cells.\n\n\n== Terminal Schwann cells ==\nTerminal Schwann cells (tSCs), also called  perisynaptic Schwann cells,” and “teloglia\", are nonmyelinating Schwann cells present at neuromuscular junctions. It is suggested that they might play a role in forming and maintaining synapses or modulating synaptic signalling.\n\n\n== References ==",

It won the 2018 Susan Smith Blackburn Prize.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe play follows three women, Carol, Anna and Bonnie, who, through the course of the play, are revealed to be mother, daughter, and granddaughter. The three women's stories play out simultaneously, while each exists in her own timeline. At the start of the play, Carol has just been released from the hospital after trying to commit suicide, Anna is a heroin addict, and Bonnie is a doctor. Carol and Anna are treated with electroconvulsive therapy. Carol commits suicide offstage. Anna electrocutes herself in the bath, while her infant daughter, Bonnie, sleeps in the next room. At the end of the play, Bonnie sells the family home.\n\n\n== Production history ==\nAnatomy of a Suicide premiered in 2017 at the Royal Court Theatre in London under the direction of Katie Mitchell and designed by Chloe Lamford. It starred Kate O’Flynn (Anna), Hattie Morahan (Carol), and Adelle Leonce (Bonnie). The premiere ran from June 3 to July 8.\nIn 2019, a German production, Anatomie eines Suizids, translated by Corinna Brocher, played at the Deutsches Schauspielhaus in Hamburg. Also in 2019, the play had its Australian premiere at the Old Fitz. Lileana Blain-Cruz directed Anatomy of a Suicide in its US-premiere in 2020 at the Atlantic Theater Company. This production starred Carla Gugino (Carol), Celeste Arias (Anna), and granddaughter Gabby Beans (Bonnie).\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\nBirch won the 2018 Susan Smith Blackburn Prize for Anatomy of a Suicide.\n\n\n== Analysis ==\nAnatomy of a Suicide raises questions about the inheritance of suicide.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Symmetry in Science and Art is a book by A.V. Shubnikov and V.A. Koptsik published by Plenum Press in 1974. The book is a translation of Simmetrija v nauke i iskusstve (Russian: Симметрия в науке и искусстве) published by Nauka in 1972. The book was notable because it gave English-language speakers access to Russian work in the fields of  dichromatic and polychromatic symmetry.\n\n\n== Structure and topics ==\nThe book is divided into two parts. The first part is an updated version of A.V. Shubnikov's 1940 book Symmetry: laws of symmetry and their application in science, technology and applied arts (Russian: Симметрия : законы симметрии и их применение в науке, технике и прикладном искусстве). The following types of classical (one-color) and dichromatic (two-color) symmetries are covered in the first part of the book: one-sided rosettes, figures with a singular point, one-sided bands, two-sided bands, rods, network patterns, layers and space groups.\nThe second part consists of three new chapters written by V.A. Koptsik covering the following subjects: group theory, crystallographic groups, antisymmetry, colored symmetry, symmetry in science and art, and conservation laws.\n\n\n== Audience ==\nThe book is written for crystallographers, mathematicians and physicists who are interested in the application of color symmetry to crystal structure analysis and physics experiments involving magnetic or ferroelectric materials. Werner Nowacki in his review of the book for Science stated: \"This is an extraordinary book, dealing with symmetry in all its aspects and written for the nonspecialist as well as the specialist (crystallographer and physicist) in this domain of natural sciences.\"\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe book had a mixed reception from contemporary reviewers.  Marc H. Bornstein in a review for Leonardo praised the book: \"Shubnikov and Koptsik, I find, should stand beside Weyl's classic treatise, Symmetry\". Werner Nowacki wrote a positive review: \"This clearly written, beautifully illustrated book will become a standard work for all who are interested in unifying branches of natural sciences and of art, and we must be grateful to the translator, the editor, and the publisher for having produced such a precious publication.\"\nHowever, Herbert Callen in American Scientist, criticised the book:\"The book remains as it was in its original edition - an exhaustive classification of symmetry groups for systems with particular types of symmetry operations, now updated by Koptsik. The larger philosophical and aesthetic extensions, however, do not meet Western standards of critical accuracy, rigour, or precision of statement; they are not pursued in any depth, and they draw on no currents of thought outside the Soviet Union.\"\n\n\n== Influence ==\nTony Crilly, when reviewing Jaswon and Rose's Crystal symmetry, theory of colour crystallography in The Mathematical Gazette in 1984 commented: \"The beginning student would find Symmetry in Science and Art (by A. V. Shubnikov and V. A. Koptsick, 1974) a stimulating introduction to the ideas worked out in technical detail by Jaswon and Rose.\" István and Magdolna Hargittai in the preface to their book Symmetry through the eyes of a chemist remarked: \"We would like especially to note here two classics in the literature of symmetry which have strongly influenced us: Weyl's Symmetry and Shubnikov and Koptsik's Symmetry in Science and Art\".\nIn later reviews of the literature by R.L.E. Schwarzenberger and by Branko Grünbaum and G.C. Shephard in their book Tilings and patterns the work of the Russian color symmetry school led by A.V. Shubnikov and N.V. Belov was put into its proper historical context. Schwarzenberger, and Grünbaum and Shephard, give credit to Shubnikov and Belov for relaunching the field of color symmetry after the work of Heinrich Heesch and H.J. Woods in the 1930s was largely ignored. However, they criticise Shubnikov and Koptsik for taking a crystallographic rather than a group-theoretic approach, and for continuing to use their own confusing notation rather than adopting the international standard Hermann–Mauguin notation for crystallographic symmetry elements.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Symmetry in Science and Art\". at the Internet Archive",

        "content": "Julienne Niat Ngoumou (1927 in Bana, West Region, Cameroon – 2009) was a Cameroonian politician. She was the president of the first national movement of Cameroonian women (Assofecam) in 1950 and the first woman to run for legislative elections in Cameroon in November 1951.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Childhood and Beginnings ===\nJulienne Niat was born in 1927 in Bana. She belonged to the royal court of Bana and was involved in the management of the kingdom at a very young age, where she gained great experience in political life. She was a teacher by training, graduating from the first class of the Yaoundé  higher school.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nIn the early 1950s, she was the president of Assofecam, the first national movement of Cameroonian women and president of the Youth Council of Cameroon, a movement affiliated with the World Assembly of Youth. In November 1951, she ran for elections to the territorial assembly of French Cameroon (Atcam). She was nominated as a candidate for the Representative Assembly by ESOCAM (Social Evolution of Cameroon, a party created in 1949). She is the first woman in all of the Trust Territories of Africa to run as a candidate. She was single and several months pregnant when she began her electoral campaign. When the baby was born, she placed her baby's cradle in her country van and took it everywhere with her.\nShe suffered two electoral defeats between 1951 and 1952, defeats attributed to the shenanigans of her male opponents who did not support the candidacy of a single woman. In 1951, the right to vote was granted only to women with at least two children. In 1952, Julienne Niat brought together women from different professions and social classes and founded the Union of Cameroonian Women (UFC) with Marie Irene Ngapeth and Marthe Moumie, also teachers and wives of nationalist executives. Through this feminist movement, the women of the UFC demanded \"the right to vote, improvement in the social, health and economic conditions of women, gender equality, but also equality between white women living in Cameroon and black women\".\nIn December 1956, she stood for the second time as a candidate in the legislative elections constituting the Legislative Assembly of Cameroon (Alcam). Julienne Niat, who became Julienne Ngoumou after her marriage, is nicknamed the Joan of Arc of Cameroon. She was once again the only female candidate in this election but did not win a seat in the new assembly. It was finally Julienne Keutcha in 1960 who became the first female elected deputy of Cameroon.\n\n\n== Private life ==\nJulienne Niat was the mother of Margaret Sanga Ngassa, with Félix Ngoumou as the father. Margaret Sanga was a Cameroonian doctor and philanthropist, a pioneer in the fight against AIDS in Cameroon and one of the founders of the NGO SWAA Littoral, a branch of Society for Women and Aids in Africa (SWAA).\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Borumba Dam Pumped Hydro Power Station is a proposed 2,000 MW pumped hydro energy storage system at Lake Borumba, located in Imbil, south-west of Gympie in Queensland, Australia. First power is expected in 2030. A state-owned entity called Queensland Hydro is coordinating the project.\nThe land for the pumped hydro scheme was purchased by the Bjelke-Petersen state government following a Cabinet decision in August 1985. Plans for the scheme were announced in September 2022. The project is expected to cost $14.2 billion.  Borumba Dam will be expanded for the project. A new dam wall is to be constructed downstream. A second reservoir is needed to be constructed.  It will be built at a higher altitude than Borumba Dam.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of pumped-storage hydroelectric power stations\nRenewable energy in Australia\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Marcelino de Ulibarri y Eguilaz (1880–1951) was a Spanish politician and civil servant. He is best known as head of repressive institutions of early Francoism: Delegación Nacional de Asuntos Especiales (1937–1938), Delegación del Estado para Recuperación de Documentos (1938–1944) and Tribunal Especial para la Represión de la Masonería y el Comunismo (1940–1941). Politically he was a longtime supporter of the Carlist cause. He briefly presided over the regional Aragón party branch (1933) and was member of the Navarrese regional executive (1936–1937), but during the Civil War he assumed a Francoist stand. During 4 terms he was member of the Falange Española Tradicionalista executive, Consejo Nacional (1939–1951), and during 3 terms he served in the Francoist Cortes (1943–1951).\n\n\n== Family and youth ==\n\nThe Basque family of Ulibarri (spelled also Ullibarri, Ulíbarri or Uribarri) was first recorded in the Medieval era; across the centuries it got very branched, also in America, and produced a number of recognized personalities. Marcelino's forefathers formed part of the Navarrese hidalguia; his most distant ancestor identified was the great-grandfather Domingo, recorded in the late 18th century. His son and Marcelino's grandfather, Juan Ciriaco de Ulibarri Mélida (died 1883), was noted as \"rico propietario\" in Muez, a hamlet in the central Navarrese zone known as Tierra Estella. His son and the father of Marcelino, Ignacio de Ulibarri Hita (died after 1916), served as the mayor of Muez in the mid-1880s. In sources he was also named \"rico propietario de Muez\" and mentioned in relation to a multi-faceted agricultural business, though in 1915 the press referred to him also as \"comerciante\". The Ulibarri house in Muez, named \"la casa de la Parra\", was considered to have been \"la principal del pueblo\".\nAt unspecified time, though probably in the 1870s, Ulibarri Hita married Hilaria Eguiláz Pérez (died after 1909), a girl from the nearby village of Guirguillano. The couple had at least 7 children, almost all boys, with Marcelino born as the third oldest son. It is not clear what language was spoken at home, as at the time Muez was at the borders of the Basque-speaking zone, yet it is known that all siblings were raised in very pious way. None of the sources consulted provides information on education of the young Marcelino, though some later episodes suggest he frequented a Piarist college, most likely in Pamplona. It is neither clear whether and if yes when and where he pursued an academic career, especially given very complex specialized, administrative, and bureaucratic tasks he would perform in the future; some press notes from his early 20s mention him in relation to Zaragoza and some suggest a juridical background.\n\nIn historiography Ulibarri is referred to as a somewhat mysterious individual with merely few details from his biography known; this refers also to beginnings of his professional career, which remain entirely unclear except that they were related to Zaragoza. It is known he was somehow associated with agriculture, though as an official or a finance clerk rather than as a landholder. At some stage, yet no later than in the early 1920s, he joined La Equitativa, a Spanish subsidiary of the US insurance company, and worked in its Zaragoza branch, growing to mid-range management positions in the mid-1920s. In 1908 Ulibarri married Petra Castiella Pérez (died 1964), a girl from Tafalla; she was daughter to Domingo Castiella Cuadrado from a locally distinguished family of the Navarrese Ribera. The couple settled in Zaragoza, though at later stages they lived in Tafalla, Salamanca and again in Tafalla; they had no children. Ulibarri's best known relative is his nephew, Pedro Ruiz de Ulibarri, who until the early 1980s held various important posts in Spanish archival structures, including Sección Guerra Civil del Archivo Histórico Nacional.\n\n\n== Early political engagements ==\n\nThe Ulibarris are described as \"una familia ya acendradamente carlista en la primera guerra\", i.e. Carlist since the First Carlist War in the 1830s. In the 1860s they subscribed to various Traditionalist initiatives. During the Third Carlist War in the 1870s the family house in Muez hosted the claimant Carlos VII and his wife, who spent few nights there in wake of the Abárzuza battle; Marcelino's mother would later for decades keep recollecting this episode. First information on Marcelino's engagements are related to his early 20s; in 1904 he presided over a Carlist committee organizing a local Traditionalist event in Zaragoza, and in 1905 he was within a group which set up Juventud Carlista in the Aragonese capital. By the end of the decade Ulibarri was already in touch with major local personalities of the party. In 1907 he took part in electoral campaign of the Navarrese heavyweight Conde Rodezno, who competed for the Cortes ticket from Aoiz.\n\nIn the 1910s Ulibarri emerged among publicly recognizable politicians of the Aragonese branch of Carlism. In 1910 he represented jefé regional, Pascual Comín, in the local Junta de Censo, apparently when protesting alleged electoral irregularities; the same year he was among organizers and major speakers during rallies against secular schools, called by right-wing Catholic groupings. He started to appear also beyond Aragón, e.g. during a 1911 banquet in Madrid, intended to honor Carlist and Integrist deputies to the Cortes. Though in his early 30s, at the time he was still related to Juventud Carlista, e.g. in 1912 he featured in its Comision Organizadora during preparations to a local rally. In the early 1910s his formal role was this of secretario of Junta Regional, still presided by Comín.\nIn the mid-1910s Carlism was increasingly plagued by a conflict between the key Traditionalist theorist, Juan Vázquez de Mella, and the claimant Don Jaime. Ulibarri is not listed among the protagonists. When in 1919 the controversy escalated to full-scale showdown and produced secession of the Mellistas, Ulibarri remained loyal to his king. However, he assumed somewhat challenging stance when in 1920 he co-signed an open letter to Don Jaime. In polite yet bold terms the signatories demanded destitution of the key party Francophone Francisco Melgar, appointment of new editor of the Carlist mouthpiece El Correo Español, and setting up a collegial nationwide party executive. By the end of the decade Ulibarri's position in Zaragoza was already firm, also beyond politics. In the press he was noted as \"inspector\" and acknowledged on societè columns. In 1918 he took part in a meeting organized by Diputación Provincial, inspired by Junta de la Defensa del Agricultor and intended to tackle agricultural problems; it is not clear what institution he represented.\n\n\n== Dictatorship and Republic ==\n\nIn the 1920s Ulibarri was barely noted as engaged in political or meta-political activities, especially that in 1923 dictatorship of Primo de Rivera effectively suspended activity of political parties. During the decade Ulibarri was recorded mostly as taking part in various Catholic initiatives, e.g. in 1923 he co-organized a local Zaragoza campaign against blasphemy, and in 1929 he was active in the male Christian brotherhood of Caballeros del Pilar; both his family and scholars claimed later that he has always been very religious. His activity in Federación Católico-Social Navarra was more about economy than religion, as in wake of the overproduction crisis he represented the Navarrese agricultural syndicate in a joint inter-provincial \"Comité de defensa de los intereses trigueros\". Numerous authors claim that in the late 1920s Ulibarri befriended Francisco Franco, a young general who in 1928 became head of the newly established Academia General Militar in Zaragoza. There is never a source provided to support these claims and it is not clear in what circumstances a nationwide known general might have interfaced with a local Carlist.\nAccording to some sources already in 1931 Ulibarri ascended to “jefe de Comunión Tradicionalista en Aragón”, the position he reportedly held until 1933. However, in 1932 in the press he was noted merely as “señor” and a CT organigram from early 1932 does not list him as a leader either on regional or provincial level; the regional Aragón organisation was led by Carlos Ram de Víu Aréval and the provincial Zaragoza one by Manuel de Ardid. It is only in 1933 that Ulibarri started to appear as “delegado regional” and represent Junta Regional in Spanish party executive, though he did not feature among nationwide important Carlist protagonists. However, his tenure as the regional Aragon leader was rather brief. In March 1934 he was noted merely as treasurer of Junta Regional de Aragón, presided by Jesús Comín, and in 1935 the press noted him as “ex jefe regional”; he would not assume any role in either Aragonese or Navarrese Carlist structures until outbreak of the civil war.\n\nSince early months of the Second Republic Ulibarri took park in labors intended to unite local right-wing opposition; in December 1931 he was noted as co-signatory of a manifesto, which launched Unión de Derechas; this provincial Zaragoza alliance was supposed to group the Carlists from Comunión Tradicionalista and politicians from Acción Nacional. In 1932 he was present during a meeting in Centro de Acción, with Gil-Robles as the key speaker, and prior to 1933 elections he co-signed an electoral manifesto of the local Unión de Derechas. In the mid-1930s he co-operated closely with Ramón Serrano Suñer, not only supporting his CEDA candidacy from Zaragoza during the 1936 elections, but reportedly also as a person who inspired Serrano to run for the Cortes. For reasons which are not clear, having spent 25 years in Zaragoza in late 1934 Ulibarri moved to Tafalla, even though seasonally he used to live in the Aragonese capital.\n\n\n== Civil War, early months ==\n\nUlibarri was involved in conspiracy talks leading to Carlist taking part in the July Coup; the national leader Manuel Fal Conde counted him among the faction who did not believe in a standalone insurrection, but who advocated a joint Carlist-military action instead. Some sources credit his effort as \"responsable carlista de transportes\", which enabled \"participación masiva\" of Navarrese volunteers in the rising. Others find it surprising that as a person who had spent 25 years beyond Navarre, Ulibarri entered Junta Central Carlista de Guerra de Navarra (JCCGN), a wartime Carlist regional executive. In the Junta he represented the merindad of Tafalla and formed part of Delegación de Intendencia y Transporte of JCCGN. Though in some sources Ulibarri is referred to as \"militar navarro de tendencia carlista\" \"militar carlí\", \"requeté Marcelino Ulibarri\", \"Navarre Carlist officer Marcelino Ulibarri\", or \"a Carlist professional soldier\" there is no evidence he has ever served either in military or paramilitary structures.\nThere is almost no information on Ulibarri's JCCGN engagements during the remainder of 1936, except that in December together with few Carlist Navarrese heavyweights he visited Franco in his headquarters in Salamanca. One purpose was to discuss a prisoner exchange, engineered by the Navarrese which Franco disapproved of. Another was the question of the Carlist leader Manuel Fal Conde having been exiled on trumped-up charges of disloyalty. During the meeting Ulibarri tried to arrange Fal's return to Nationalist zone, though he also criticised Junta Nacional Carlista de Guerra, the central Carlist wartime executive, for not having co-ordinated its initiatives with the military. In daily dealings he also advocated close alignment with the army; in January 1937, when discussing would-be revenge measures in response to Republican killings of Traditionalist pundits in Bilbao prisons, he supported retaliation but in framework of official military justice, as \"one can not ignore law when willing to do justice\" and in order not to \"follow the rules implemented by the reds\".\n\nWhen Carlists faced the threat of would-be forced amalgamation into a new state party, Ulibarri was in favor of complying with the military dictate. In late March he was within a delegation sent by JCCGN to Saint-Jean-de-Luz to convince the regent-claimant, Don Javier. In Franco's headquarters he was viewed as one of the tractable Carlists. In early April he was among 4 leaders invited to Salamanca, where generalísimo briefed them on terms of the forthcoming unification. When discussing personalities with Rodezno, Franco suggested that Ulibarri be among 3 Carlists to enter the 10-member executive of Falange Española Tradicionalista, just about to be launched. However, Rodezno responded that too many Navarros in Junta Política would not make a good impression, and eventually Ulibarri was replaced by Carlists from La Rioja and from Madrid. He later declared himself a fervent supporter of the unification, yet some scholars claim that Ulibarri was not on good terms with the Falangist sector of the regime.\n\n\n== DNAE and SRD ==\n\nIn April 1937 Nicolás Franco, head of Secretaría General del Jefe de Estado, set up Oficina de Investigación y Propaganda Anti-Comunista (OIPA); its principal task was to comb newly seized territories for documents produced by Communist structures. Some authors claim that it was Ulibarri who “planted in the mind of his powerful friend” (i.e. Franco) the idea of creating an investigative body, which materialized as OIPA, and some even maintain that he was heading the Office, but other scholars do not mention him as related. Historiographic works do not agree on further fate of the institution, though from scholarly narratives it appears that it was soon either merged with or amalgamated into other similar bodies.\nIn May 1937 Franco's Secretaría Particular set up Delegación Nacional de Asuntos Especiales (DNAE), affiliated to Secretaría General; its task was to recover and collect all documents related to masonic activity, especially on newly seized territories. Ulibarri as Delegado Nacional was nominated head of the institution. Some sources claim that he was also nominated director of another investigative body, Servicio de Recuperación de Documentos (SRD), set up in June 1937 as branch of Cuartel General; this one was entrusted with similar task, but related to Communist activity. Other sources do not mention such an institution.\nMany scholars discuss Ulibarri's nomination against the background of his alleged friendship with Franco, reportedly dating back to the 1928–1931 years in Zaragoza, and their common anti-masonic obsession. Others prefer rather to underline his close familiarity with Serrano Suñer, who has just emerged as Franco's key advisor and architect of the new regime; reportedly he was responsible for Ulibarri's nomination. Some mention Ulibarri's alleged propaganda role in JCCGN as a key motive behind the appointment. His manifested distance towards the intransigent Carlist stand of Fal Conde has also gained him trust in Franco's headquarters. None of the sources consulted discusses Ulibarri's record in La Equitativa, which has provided him with experience and competence in terms of investigation, document circulation and database management.\n\nIt is not clear how numerous the DNAE staff was; the institution was based in what used to be Seminario Mayor in Salamanca. Its first major task was related to the Nationalist conquest of Biscay in June 1937, though it is not clear whether Ulibarri personally travelled to Bilbao. It is known that as part of his duties he was involved in compiling a list of Catholic priests, engaged in Basque Nationalist propaganda; reportedly 6 of them have later been persecuted. As the Nationalist offensive in the northern enclave progressed, in August Ulibarri and his men travelled to freshly seized Santander to comb out Republican documentation left behind. Documents were packed and transported to Salamanca, where an increasingly large makeshift archive started to emerge in the DNAE premises.\n\n\n== DERD ==\n\nIn April 1938 the provisional ministry of interior, headed by Serrano Suñer, issued a decree which established Delegación del Estado para Recuperación de Documentos (DERD). Affiliated to Ministerio de la Gobernación though partially supervised by the military, it was to recover, collect, catalogue and store all official documents produced by the Republicans, not only these related to freemasonry or Communist propaganda. Most scholars claim that DERD replaced all previously existing similar bodies, including DNAE and SRD (some claim also OIPA), which were merged within the new structure. In May Ulibarri as Delegado de Estado was nominated the head of DERD, to be moved from Seminario Mayor to Colegio San Ambrosio in Salamanca.\nFollowing Nationalist takeover of Castellón in June 1938 Ulibarri did not go to the Mediterranean coast himself, but nominated his deputies to run the search for documents. At the time he was busy building the team and working out related admin and logistics routine. He was also overwhelmed by massive growth of the archive and tried to arrange new premises as its permanent location, in Salamanca or elsewhere; he was increasingly anxious about would-be fire or sabotage. In December 1938 he claimed having collected 5m documents, and in a letter to Franco declared 15.000 individual files on freemasons on the shelves. In January and February 1939 Ulibarri led a team of 80 DERD staff who combed Barcelona. They later returned to Salamanca with 3,500 bags, 160 tons of paper and 1.800 documentary units, though in April he had to move to Madrid to organize similar search in the capital. The experience rendered him \"a genuine expert in purging the offices\". Throughout the process he was frequently involved in conflict with other services, e.g. the Falange intelligence unit, DGS, and SIPM, apart from clashes with Juan Tusquets, who was reluctant to hand over documentation he had earlier collected. Ulibarri's relations with other institutions remained tense; he was very restrictive as to sharing the documents, even though was forced to transfer some collections elsewhere.\n\nAfter the war Ulibarri tried to move the archive to El Escorial under the changed name of \"Archivos Documentales de la Cruzada de España\", the efforts which proved unsuccessful; he would attempt to find a new site for the ever-growing archive until 1941, with a few various locations suggested. He also recommended that DERD engages in education – which in few years produced opening of an internal Museo de la Masonería - and restructuring the institution, with one of its sections assuming a juridical role. Another of his proposals featured issuing \"certificado de antecedentes\", a document summarizing previous activity of given individual. However, in the early 1940s Ulibarri was decreasingly interested in DERD. Since 1942 frequently absent on sick leave in Tafalla, the same year he formally asked to be released. His request was granted in 1944, when DERD was transformed into Delegación Nacional de Servicios Documentales (DNSD), the body operational until 1977. When he was leaving, the institution held 3m individual files.\n\n\n== TERMC ==\n\nAlready in 1939 Ulibarri suggested in his memorandum that DERD as a restructured institution should assume juridical functions. It is not clear whether his proposals contributed to further developments, of which the first step was Ley para la Represión de la Masonería y el Comunismo, published in March 1940. It declared membership in masonic or Communist organizations a crime, and in one of its paragraphs envisioned setup of a \"tribunal especial\", to deal with such offences in case of civilians. The tribunal in question materialized in June 1940 as Tribunal Especial para la Represión de la Masonería y el Comunismo (TERMC), one of 25 special tribunals set up by the early Francoist regime. Composed of 6 members, it was to be presided by Ulibarri. Like in case of other institutions, scholars speculate that the appointment might have been related to Ulibarri's friendship either with Franco or with Serrano and his zealous anti-masonic and anti-Communist views, apart from his successful record in DERD.\nDuring the second half of 1940 Ulibarri was busy working on both legal groundwork and internal rules of the Tribunal. In case of the former he turned to academic experts in penal law like Isaías Sánchez Tejerina from the University of Salamanca, asking them for advice as to legal framework of the persecution. In case of the latter he tried to devise the modus operandi himself, guided by the principle that the anti-masonic and anti-Communist justice should be dispensed fast and with few formalities. He underlined that \"excesiva preocupación legalista\" should be avoided; he also opted for non-public proceedings performed in absence of the person investigated and with no assistance on part of professionals in law. Like in case of other special tribunals, there was no appeal envisioned.\n\nBefore the Tribunal had its first sitting, in early 1941 Ulibarri resigned from the presidency; reasons are not known. A new decree, issued in March 1941, nominated members of the tribunal anew; the presidency went to general Andres Saliquet, and Ulibarri was merely one of 6 members. TERMC started to operate in April 1941, and its first sentences were delivered in September against numerous Republican personalities, all of them on exile, Diego Martínez Barrio having been the first one. Later the Tribunal sentenced also defunct politicians, like Andreu Nín. Ulibarri was not within the Tribunal jury which delivered first sentences, yet some scholars claim that he \"was in charge of drafting the sentences during his first year\". TERMC launched 64.000 investigations during 25 years of its existence, but t is not clear in how many proceedings Ulibarri did take part before in 1942 he quoted health reasons and asked to be released. It is not known when his request was granted. Last known case of Ulibarri forming part of the tribunal is dated 1945 and refers to Elías Ahúja Andría, who was declared not guilty.\n\n\n== Dignitary ==\n\nThough in April 1937 Franco intended to nominate Ulibarri to Junta Política of Falange Española Tradicionalista and abandoned the idea only upon the advice of Rodezno, in October 1937 he neither nominated Ulibarri to Consejo Nacional, another and somewhat less empowered executive body of FET. Its 2-year-term was about to expire in the autumn of 1939 and in September Franco nominated members of the II. Consejo. This time Ulibarri was included, positioned as the last one on the list of 90 nominees. In the mammoth body which provided its members with little decision-making power, but mattered in terms of prestige and position within the regime, he featured as one of 14 Carlists. In November 1942 the III. Consejo Nacional was appointed; this time Ulibarri was listed as 59th on the list of 95 nominees, 12 of them Carlists.\nIn early 1943 the Francoist regime underwent one of its final formal re-definitions when Cortes Españolas, a quasi-parliament, has been established; some view it as a measure of fascization of the regime, others see it rather as a first step towards de-fascization. By default all members of the FET Consejo Nacional became so-called procuradores in the chamber, which referred also to Ulibarri. This sequence of events was repeated 3 times. In May 1946 Franco appointed Ulibarri to IV. FET Consejo Nacional (on position 24 out of 50), which the same month translated to his mandate into the II. Cortes. In May 1949 he was appointed to the V. FET Consejo Nacional (on position 23 out of 49), which the same month was acknowledged by a mandate to the III. Cortes; Ulibarri held it until his death.\n\nHaving resigned his positions in DERD and TERMC Ulibarri had no real power, be it in political or other terms, even though the press reported him as engaged in various legislative works and some sources suggest some influence on personal appointments in Francoist administration, e.g. in 1940–1941 in Valencia. However, seats in Consejo Nacional and Cortes ensured his position within the titular elite of the regime. In 1944 he was awarded 2 prestigious honors, Orden de Cisneros and Gran Cruz de la Orden del Mérito Civil. He terminated any links to mainstream Carlism, either on the regional Navarrese or the national level, and though featuring among best-known so-called carlo-franquistas, he also counted among “conocidos disidentes tradicionalistas”. In his final years in the late 1940s and early 1950s and reportedly due to health reasons he withdrew to privacy; his death was noted in the press with moderate and not necessarily accurate acknowledgements.\n\n\n== In historiography ==\n\nUntil the mid-1930s and during most of his lifetime Ulibarri remained a private figure, apart from local Navarrese and Aragonese Carlist circles mentioned only in societé column of Pamplona and Zaragoza newspapers. His rather specific 1937–1942 role first in DNAE and then in DERD was not subject to media focus. Neither his brief term in TERMC received more than perfunctory media coverage, and in the 1940s his name appeared in papers rather in long-winded lists of Consejo Nacional appointees. His death has passed almost unacknowledged, and afterwards his name has gone into almost complete oblivion. If appearing in history books, e.g. in Joaquín Arrarás’ work on Republic and war (1968) or in Eduardo Alvárez Puga’s history of Falange (1969) he appeared very briefly in relation to Carlism and Unification.\nThings took a sharp turn after the fall of the regime. Mushrooming works on Francoist repression, terror, its anti-democratic character, its victims, its oppressive structures etc. started to mention Ulibarri, and until today he is present in scores of books, usually noted only en passant. He is listed among personalities responsible for buildup of the criminal Francoist system and his work is dubbed \"key element in the information system underpinning the New State’s judicial structure\". If dedicated few sentences, he is presented as a somewhat psychopathic personality, marked by numerous obsessions: about Freemasonry (\"obsessive anti-Freemasonry that Ulibarri shared with Franco\"), about secrecy (\"el secretismo y la seguridad, que se requería para trabajar en el mismo, en periodo de guerra, y que, a Marcelino de Ulibarri, tanto obsesionaba\") or about sabotage (\"siempre lo obsesionó la idea que ‘su’ Archivo sufriera algún acto de sabotaje, en forma de incendio provocado\"). Some suggest he was managing sort of a secular Francoist Inquisition.\nSo far no author has attempted to scrutinize Ulibarri's work in terms of professional competence as the manager of DNAE and DERD, be it when it comes to archival tasks (e.g. database architecture, cataloguing systems, document storage, data proliferation patterns) or to the investigative dimension (documentation recovery, data analysis, research methodologies). In some works he is referred to as \"un personaje misterioso y con una biografía desconocida\" and presented as sort of grey eminence, counted among \"personalidades más grises y desconocidas\". His 25-year spell in Zaragoza remains barely known, especially in terms of his professional engagements. Numerous studies replicate information which is either erroneous (e.g. about his alleged career of a professional military man) or not sourced (e.g. about his alleged friendship with Franco during the Zaragoza days of 1928–1931). There are two works, both PhD dissertations, where he was paid more attention: the one on DERD archive mentioned him 118 times and in the one on anti-masonic measures against females he was dedicated a separate sub-chapter.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCarlo-francoism\nCarlism\nWhite Terror (Spain)\nFrancoist Spain\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nMaría José Turrión García, La represión de la masonería femenina en el Tribunal de Represión de la Masoneríá y el Comunismo (1940–1963) [PhD thesis Universidad de Salamanca], Salamanca 2020\nJosé Tomás Velasco Sánchez, El archivo que perdía los papeles.

        "content": "Joaquim João \"Jaju\" Fernandes (29 September 1960 – 11 April 2023), also mononymously known as Jaju or Dada, was an Indian actor and singer known for his work in Konkani films and tiatr productions.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nJoaquim João Fernandes was born on 29 September 1960 in the village of Benaulim, Goa, which was part of Portuguese India during the Portuguese Empire, to carpenter Joaquim Mariano Fernandes and homemaker Maria Remediana Edoenca Fernandes, who hailed from Colva, into a Goan Catholic family.  Fernandes originated from a village known for its tradition of tiatrists.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1980, Fernandes commenced his career in the Konkani theatrical domain by participating in the non-stop tiatr production titled Thapott (Slap), orchestrated by his brother Roseferns. This marked the inception of his association with the Roseferns Dramatic Troupe. Thapott achieved success, entertaining audiences for more than a century with its performances. Throughout his career, Fernandes left a mark with his memorable portrayals, garnering acclaim not only for his villainous roles but also for his adeptness in comedic characters. He donned multiple hats, embodying diverse roles, be it that of a father figure, antagonist, or law enforcement officer. In 2010, Fernandes joined forces with fellow tiatrist Comedian Agostinho's troupe for the theatrical production of Advogad (Advocate), which led to a series of popular tiatrs including Interview, Police, Public, and Fight for Right. Fernandes subsequently rejoined his brother Roseferns' troupe, lending his talent to their 98th production, Atam Yeyat (Now Come), followed by the 99th production, Jevnnant Fator (Stone in food), the 100th production, Amche Modem Jiyeta (Dwelling within us), and finally, the 101st production, Ek Nam Ek Dis (One day or the another). Consequently, Fernandes made a firm commitment to further assist his brother in their future projects in the tiatr production industry.\nFernandes was a multifaceted artist known for his contributions as both an actor and a singer. He showcased his vocal prowess in several audio albums produced by Konkani artists such as Roseferns, Pascoal, Saby de Divar, and others. Within the realm of acting, Fernandes made an impact by starring in a variety of Konkani films, including works like Ek Vat Mennachi, Vankddo Tinkddo Mog, Old Age Home, and Public, among others. Furthermore, Fernandes ventured into the realm of production, releasing the Konkani CD Xim, where he demonstrated his skills in different venues in India, including Goa, Mumbai, and Pune, as well as internationally in Kuwait, Bahrain, Muscat, Qatar, Dubai, and the United Kingdom. Known for his versatility, Fernandes embraced a diverse range of roles, portraying characters that spanned the spectrum from negative to positive, with a particular flair for paternal figures and comedic portrayals. His performances were characterized by a distinctive style and dynamic presence, infusing the stage with an infectious energy. Throughout his career, Fernandes actively collaborated with a multitude of directors and showcased his talents in theatrical productions spanning the Gulf region, London, and Europe. He was regarded for his constructive suggestions to fellow actors and his warm, inviting demeanor.\nOn 10 April 2023, Fernandes participated in the 102nd production by Roseferns titled Hem Oxench Choltolem? (Will this work?) at Arambol, marking his final performance. In this production, Fernandes demonstrated his versatility by playing two different characters - a driver and the chairman of the Educational Board. Meena Goes, a member of the troupe, praised Fernandes for his strong presence on stage during the entire show. Following the conclusion of the performance, the troupe headed back home at approximately 1:30 am. Fernandes's contributions extended beyond his role as a tiatrist. He held positions as an executive member and former assistant secretary of the Goa Football Association (GFA) and was a founding member of the Konkani Non-Stop Tiatristanchi Sonstha (KNTS). Fernandes had a lengthy tenure as a member of the GFA, having initially been elected to the organization in 1993. He actively participated in the organization's operations, particularly in managing leagues and tournaments catering to different age groups. Fernandes's artistic journey encompassed a body of work, including more than 125 tiatrs/khell-tiatrs. He collaborated with Konkani directors such as Roseferns, Comedian Agostinho, and Tony Dias.\nFernandes gained acclaim for his performances in tiatrs, a form of traditional Goan theater, including productions such as Dhovo Kanvllo (White Crow), Ghantt (Ghat), Government of God, Police, and Mahanand. Recognizing his son's talent ahead of others, Fernandes played a pivotal role in shaping Brandon's career, ultimately establishing him as one of India national football team's midfielders. In a period where options for international training were limited, Fernandes chose to send Brandon to the ASD Football Academy in South Africa. This decision gave Brandon a special opportunity to demonstrate his abilities to Premier League clubs like Leicester City, Reading F.C., and Sunderland A.F.C. during trial sessions. In addition to his contributions to his son's career, Fernandes served as the chairman of the GFA (Goa Football Association) futsal committee, further demonstrating his commitment to the sport. His knowledge and negotiation skills even led him to assume the role of a football agent, overseeing the contractual affairs of Brandon during the early stages of his professional journey.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nFernandes's elder brother, Roseferns, is also active on the Konkani stage as a theatre director and actor. On 15 September 1982, Fernandes had a civil marriage registration with homemaker Antoneta Goes (later Antonieta Goes) in Margao.   They have four children: three boys – Brandon, an association football player who plays for FC Goa; Beckham (born 2002); and Sydney (born 1984), who is based in the UK – and a daughter, Anisia. Aside from his involvement in tiatrs, Fernandes demonstrated a keen interest in football and actively contributed to the advancement of the sport in Goa.\n\n\n== Death ==\nAt 7:30 pm of 10 April, Fernandes, after his participation in a theatrical production called Hem Oxench Choltolem?, returned home around 1:30 am along with his brother and their troupe. An eyewitness from the troupe, Meena, observed that Fernandes appeared to be in good health. Later during the night, Fernandes made a phone call to his son Sydney, who resides in the United Kingdom. In the early hours of 11 April, Fernandes' brother, Roseferns, was informed that Fernandes was having trouble breathing and had a sleepless night. He was immediately taken to South Goa District Hospital in Margao but unfortunately suffered a fatal heart attack on the way and died at around 8:00 am. \nCharles D'Souza, a writer for The Goan Everyday, stated that Fernandes was admitted to the hospital for breathing issues, which ultimately resulted in his death. However, Fernandes' death certificate indicates that he died at his residence in Vasvaddo, Benaulim.  His funeral took place two days later, on 13 April, at the Holy Trinity Church in Benaulim. The ceremony was attended by a number of individuals, including members of the Konkani tiatr community, politicians, sports personalities, friends, and well-wishers.\n\n\n== References ==",

He was well recognized for his portrayal of the role Saiful, which he did with actress Kilafairy under the direction of Emi Maziah. His acting abilities were subsequently demonstrated in movies like Kapoww, Evolution of KL Drift 2, and Kanang anak Langkau: The Iban Warrior.Aidil has also taken an active part in a number of dramas, some of which have achieved considerable acclaim. Akademi Polis (2009), Nilapura (2011), Trilogi Cinta 2 (2012), Saiful Nita (2012), Hujan (2013), Asmara Luna (2013), Romi Cinta Julia (2014), Tabir Zulaikha (2015), Hati Perempuan (2015), Lara Terindah (2016), Kamar Kamariah (2018), Cinta Lemon Madu (2018) and Vila Ghazara (2018) are a few of these works.Following his controversy in 2016, Aidil's debut drama is Vila Ghazara, directed by Feroz Kader. According to him, he learned a lot from the incident, particularly about how to evaluate friendships in situations when it is sufficient for him to keep positive relationships with Allah and his family. Nevertheless, he said that his growing workload with theater acts compelled him to temporarily halt his business Kingmangifera.\n\n\n== Controversy ==\nAidil and two of his friends appeared before the Kuala Lumpur High Court on 7 October 2016, charged with violating Section 39B of the Dangerous Drug Deed of 1952 by distributing marijuana drugs weighing 465.61 grams (16.424 oz).

        "content": "NGC 3448 is an irregular galaxy in the constellation Ursa Major. The galaxy lies about 75 million light years away from Earth, which means, given its apparent dimensions, that NGC 3448 is approximately 125,000 light years across. It was discovered by William Herschel on April 17, 1789.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nThe galaxy is seen edge-on and is categorised as an amorphous galaxy with material ejected from nucleus in the Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies. The galaxy interacts with UGC 6016, a dwarf barred spiral galaxy with low surface brightenss which appears pertubated. UGC 6016 lies 3.9 arcminutes away from NGC 3448. There is material between the two galaxies, probably tidal debris, and a tidal plume emanates from the side of NGC 3448 opposite of UGC 6016. Noreau and Kronberg in 1986 found there is non-continuous hydrogen bridge between the two galaxies though. The bridge is also visible in near ultraviolet.\nThe galaxy has a central dust lane that lies at an angle of 20° with respect to the rest of the galaxy. A series of radio sources lie along the dust lane that could be supernova remnants, indicating the galaxy is undergoing intense star formation fueled by the tidal interaction. The total star formation rate is estimated to be 1.371+0.065−0.047 M☉ per year. A spiral arm is visible in radiowaves, with one more possibly present in the other side of the nucleus. The dynamics of NGC 3448 are pertubated due to tidal interaction and material is reintergrating to the galaxy, obscuring parts of the galaxy in visible light. The galaxy has a warped hydrogen disk that extends beyond the visual one, along with the tidal plumes.\n\n\n== Supernova ==\nOne supernova has been observed in NGC 3448, SN 2014G. The supernova was discovered on 14 January 2014 by Koichi Itagaki, when it had an apparent magnitude of 15.6. The spectrum of the supernova indicates it was a type II supernova, with initial spectra indicating a type IIn while during its light curve post maximum indicates it was a type II-L.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nNGC 3448 on WikiSky: DSS2, SDSS, GALEX, IRAS, Hydrogen α, X-Ray, Astrophoto, Sky Map, Articles and images",

        "content": "Arsenic blende or Arsenblende (German: Arsenblende, arsenik-blende) — a trivial name that has partially fallen out of scientific use, used by mineralogists, as well as representatives of mining and craft professions in relation to at least two similar ore minerals — orpiment and realgar,: 135, 239, 438  in composition — arsenic sulfides.\n\n\n== History of the term ==\nBoth of these minerals, realgar and orpiment, have been mined for a very long time, for thousands of years. They were mined as natural dyes, as medicinal agents, and as preparations that were important in alchemical practice. Their use as pigments was very significant, both in pure form and in mixed form; for example, orpiment was constantly required to make up the green dye that was used to dye wool in the Middle Ages in Western Europe. Arsenic blende was used even more widely in medicine; for example, in Hebrew (orpiment) and ancient Greek medicine (realgar and orpiment). This use is entirely preserved in the folk medicine of some tribes in Asia (Caucasus, Japan, China) and Europe (Russia). In China and Japan, realgar served as a raw material for jewelry crafts at the beginning of the 20th century, despite its toxicity.: 210 \nInitially, the phrase ″arsenic blende″ was mostly used to refer to orpiment. This name was given to a natural mineral with a high arsenic content, as well as a bright golden or lemon-yellow paint based on it. This pigment was highly valued for its color and was called \"royal yellow\"; it was widely used in fresco painting and icon painting, despite its strong toxicity and chemical instability.: 21 \nThe purity and brightness of color, rare for nature, combined with the diamond lustre of the mineral, often deceived ignorant people. From a distance, the orpiment could in fact be mistaken for native gold, not distinguished by such brilliance. In addition, well-formed realgar crystals look impressive and often give the impression of red gemstones: rubyes or garnets. For this, realgar also earned two other trivial names: ″ruby sulphur″ and ″ruby of arsenic″.\nIn the scientific literature, until the first half of the 19th century, both of these minerals were more often called \"arsenic blende\" (red or yellow). As minerals that are old, bright and widespread, realgar (″sandarac″) and orpiment are very often cited as the most famous examples of the group of blendes.: 105 \nUntil the second half of the 19th century, ″arsenic blende″ remained a conventionally accepted scientific mineralogical term. Used in its pure form, without additional definition, as a rule, it meant orpiment or, more generally, arsenic sulfide in the form of a mineral. However, more often in the texts there was still a color clarification that made it possible to avoid confusion: red arsenic blende was called realgar, and yellow arsenic blende was called orpiment. However, such a distinction often seems more than arbitrary, since realgar and orpiment are very often found together in close fusions or associations.: 203–204  In addition, realgar as a mineral is unstable, it gradually oxidizes in the light, and often directly turns into orpiment, as a result of which the red color gradually fades and turns into orange or yellow.: 210 \nIn the 20th century, there was an almost complete displacement of arsenic blende as a term from the scientific glossary — into the colloquial language of geologists, miners, engineers, metallurgists, mineral collectors and other categories of amateurs. Nevertheless, the phrase has remained alive and relevant to this day in the study of the history of mineralogy, and also as one of the striking examples of minerals included in the group of blendes.: 93 \n\n\n== Essential Minerals ==\nArsenic blende,: 239  orpiment, also yellow arsenic blende: 48  — arsenic sulfide, ore mineral of the composition As2S3. It has a bright color from lemon yellow to golden orange.\nArsenic blende,: 239  realgar, also red arsenic blende: 48  or sandarac — arsenic sulfide, ore mineral with the composition AsS. It also has a bright color ranging from fiery red to orange-yellow.\nIn addition, another widely known ore mineral, which in its chemical composition belongs to a different group, has a similar trivial name:\n\nArsenical silver blende: 48  or arsenic-silver blende,: 239  proustite: 21  — silver thioarsenide, an ore mineral with the composition Ag3AsS3, forms dark purplish-red crystals with a lead-gray tint.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nBlende (disambiguation)\nArsenic (disambiguation)",

        "content": "On 2 April 2024, a shooting occurred at the Viertola school, Jokiranta site in Vantaa, Finland. The gunman, who was a 12-year-old student, shot three other 12-year-old students. One of the victims died and two were seriously injured.\n\n\n== Background ==\nGun ownership in Finland is closely linked to hunting and target practice being a popular hobby. According to the Finnish Interior Ministry, there are more than 1.5 million licensed firearms in Finland and about 430,000 licensed gun owners, equivalent to about 8% of Finland's population. Finnish law provides no limit to the number of guns that can be owned, but also requires certain ”highly dangerous”, such as semi-automatic pistols with a large magazine, or if the amount of firearms exceeds five to be \"locked in such a way that the handgun cannot be easily stolen\". The minimum age to attain a gun licence is 18, while minors over 15 can also have licenses to use other people's firearms. However, the minimum age to receive a license for a revolver, which was used in the attack, is 20.\nPrevious school shootings in 2007 and 2008 that killed people led to the raising of the minimum age for gun ownership and increased background checks for prospective gun owners and prompted the establishment of a \"system of pre-emptive measures\" allowing police to intervene if they received information on a \"person's intent to stage an attack\". An aptitude test for all gun licence applicants was also introduced in 2010.\nBullying in Finland is regarded as being widespread, with studies showing that 8.6% of children between the ages of 10–11 experience it on a weekly basis.\n\n\n== Shooting ==\nThe police received a call about the shooting at 09:07 UTC+2, which occurred in a sixth-grade classroom in Viertola school's Jokiranta campus serving grades three to six, during which a 12-year-old boy wearing a mask and noise-cancelling headphones shot three of his classmates and fled the scene. Police arrived in the school at 09:17. A lockdown was implemented inside the school and in neighboring educational institutions. \nImmediately after the shooting, a teacher from another classroom went to the scene and convinced the suspect to leave the classroom. After leaving the school on foot, the suspect also threatened three students of the neighbouring Siltamäki elementary school with his weapon while they were en route to their school. Later, the police found the suspect in the North Helsinki neighborhood of Siltamäki and took him into custody at 09:58. Police recovered the weapon used in the attack from the suspect.\nOf the three victims, one was a boy and the other two were girls. The boy died immediately after being shot. One of the girls had dual citizenship of Finland and Kosovo, the other only Finnish citizenship. One of the victims was discharged from a hospital on 11 April.\n\n\n== Investigation ==\nThe police are investigating the incident as one murder and two attempted murders, as well as one illegal threat. The legal owner of the handgun used by the shooter is being investigated for a firearms offence.\nThe handgun used was licensed to a close relative. The police stated that the motive of the perpetrator was bullying. Yle reported that the suspect had confessed to the police, and had a history of being bullied at school. The suspect had transferred to the school at the start of the year. Due to him being a minor, the suspect will not face criminal charges and was instead placed in the care of social services. National Police Commissioner Seppo Kolehmainen said that law enforcement had not received intelligence regarding plans for the attack.\n\n\n== Reactions ==\n\nFollowing the shooting, calls emerged from some politicians to lower the minimum age of criminal responsibility from 15 years.\nThe Viertola school reopened on 3 April on reduced hours, with crisis counselling sessions on offer. On the same day, a national day of mourning was held, during which Flags of Finland were placed on half-mast and flowers and candles were laid at the site of the attack. Official discussions about the shooting were held in schools across Vantaa. School officials later said that the students who were in the classroom where the shooting took place would be taught in other buildings of the school. \nPrime Minister Petteri Orpo described the shooting as \"deeply upsetting\" and said that mental health issues of the youth must be tackled sooner. President Alexander Stubb also expressed shock at the fact of the shooting and offered condolences to the families of the victims while wishing for the recovery of them. Education Minister Anna-Maja Henriksson tearfully described the shooting as a \"great tragedy\" and said that her thoughts were with the \"12-year-old who will never come home from school again\". Interior Minister Mari Rantanen wrote on Twitter (X) that she \"can only imagine the pain and worry that many families are experiencing at the moment.\" Deputy Prime Minister Riikka Purra, referring to the shooting, said that \"these kinds of incidents should never happen.\" Leader of the Left Alliance and former Education Minister Li Andersson also described the incident as a major shock to her.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFirearms regulation in Finland\nRaumanmeri school shooting\nJokela school shooting\nKauhajoki school shooting\nKuopio school stabbing\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Wladimir Klitschko vs. Samuel Peter, billed as \"Boardwalk Brawls\", was a professional boxing match contested on 24 September 2005.\n\n\n== Background ==\nSince his upset stoppage loss at the hands of Lamon Brewster, Wladimir Klitschko had secured two stoppage victories, first a split technical decision over DaVarryl Williamson and the second a 4th-round TKO over Eliseo Castillo. Despite this, many observers continued to question both Wladimir's chin and his stamina, as a result of the nature of his three losses to Ross Puritty, Corrie Sanders and Brewster.\nMeanwhile, Samuel Peter was rising quickly through the heavyweight ranks, being ranked inside the top 10 by all the major sanctioning bodies, with his build and punching power drawing comparisons to Mike Tyson. Indeed, when he interviewed by ESPN in June 2005, shortly before his final fight against Kevin McBride, Tyson would name Peter as one of his favourite fighters from the newest crop of heavyweights. However, his record was criticised for the lack of notable opposition, and he had been described as slow, sloppy and predictable.\nOn the 3 August 2005 the match up between Klitschko and Peter was confirmed. It would be an eliminator for the IBF and WBO belts held by Chris Byrd and Brewster (both former Klitschko opponents), in addition Peter's NABF and the vacant NABO titles were on the line. Speaking at the New York press conference on 10 August, Peter told the assembled reporters, \"I’m coming to do what I do. I’m a specialist. I’m a knockout specialist.\" Klitschko's trainer, Emanuel Steward predicted that his man would be the one to finish the fight early, \"I predict he will knock out Sam Peter between the third and seventh round, he’s a seasoned professional fighter against an aggressive green fighter.\" Veteran trainer Angelo Dundee predicted an early Peter knockout, saying \"You can't train a chin\". It had been reported that many within the Klitschko camp didn't want to take the fight, but that Wladimir insisted that he wanted to face Peter.\nMost expected the bout to end in a knockout, given the question marks over Klitschko's stamina and the feeling that Peter would be unable to outbox Wladimir. Peter was a 7 to 5 favourite entering the ring.\n\n\n== The fights ==\n\n\n=== Cotto vs. Torres ===\nIn the chief support Miguel Cotto defended his WBO Light Welterweight belt against Ricardo Torres, who was a late minute replacement for Gianluca Branco.\nCotto knocked down Torres with a left hook in the first round, before being hurt himself with a right hand later in the round. Cotto was knocked down for first time in his career the second round. In the fourth round, Torres took a knee following a body shot, but he would hurt Cotto with a right-left combination in the next round. Cotto dropped Torres against with a right hand toward the end of the sixth, before connecting with a right-left combination in the seventh which ended the bout, giving Cotto a KO victory.\n\n\n=== Main Event ===\nKlitschko spent much of the fight working behind jab, landing the occasional right hand and moving away from the advancing Peter. Klitschko would initiate a number of clinches, to keep Peter from finding a rhythm. In the fifth round a clubbing right hand to the back of Klitschko's head sent him down, he beat the count but was down again 30 seconds later from a half punch half push that referee Randy Neumann ruled a knockdown. Klitschko would survive the round and over the next few round would his use jab and straight right to attempt to slow the oncoming Peter, who continued to search for a knockout punch. A solid right hand, rocked Klitschko in the eight, and in the tenth a right hook sent him staggering across the ring before a straight right hand sent him down for the third time. Klitschko again beat the count and withstood Peter's follow up attacks until the end of round. Peter, his eyes swelling, wobbled Klitschko with a wild left hand early in the final round but a left hook from Wladimir hurt Peter. The fight went to the judges, all three of whom would score the bout 114–111 in favour of Klitschko. HBO's unofficial scorer Harold Lederman also had it 114-111 for Klitschko.\nAccording to CompuBox Klitschko landed 204 punches with 39% accuracy, against Peter's 100 punches with 23% accuracy.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nSpeaking after the bout Klitschko said \"I have put my losses behind me, Boxing is a lot of fun, simple as that. I am ready to fight anyone. Peter was a very strong opponent, but he kept hitting me in the back of the head. It's wonderful to be back in the heavyweight picture. Hopefully, I convinced some of the critics that I have the stamina to go 12 rounds.\" Meanwhile, Peter said \"I took his best punch and knocked him down three times, I came to win but he did his best and he beat me. He beat me today, but maybe on my best day I can beat him. I learned from the experience of being in with a top opponent for the first time.\"\nKlitschko received praised for his performance, showing both heart and stamina to overcome being knocked down three times. Despite the loss Peter exhibited a strong chin, and despite appearing somewhat fatigated late on, he was nevertheless able to last the full 12 rounds (having only gone 10 rounds previously). He was however criticised for appearing to be somewhat one-dimensional.\nThe following February it was confirmed that Klitschko would challenge Byrd for the IBF title in April. He would stop him in the 7th to become a heavyweight champion. Peter would bounce back with wins over Robert Hawkins and Julius Long before he would face James Toney in a WBC title eliminator in September 2006.\nThis would be Wladimir's last bout without a world title on the line.\n\n\n== Undercard ==\nConfirmed bouts:\n\n\n== Broadcasting ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "William Bowyer (died 1628) was an English soldier, administrator, and Captain of the garrison at Berwick-upon-Tweed.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\nAfter the Union of the Crowns in 1603, James VI and I scaled down the garrisons on the Anglo-Scottish border. There were to be 100 men at Berwick, and William Bowyer was appointed Captain. He took charge of the remaining artillery from John Crane, the former Comptroller of Berwick. The poet John Taylor described Bowyer as a \"worthy old soldier and ancient knight\". Bowyer acquired a knighthood, but also continued to be known as \"Captain Bowyer\", the soldier's rank he had held since July 1593.\nHe was described as \"Master Bowyer\" when he was considered for the Comptroller's place in 1594, and John Carey wrote that he was well-travelled and more skilled at fortification works than John Crane. Bowyer was \"ready with his pen and knowledge, to make a pound go as far as any\". Sir Robert Cecil considered him for Comptroller in 1594, writing to his father William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley that \"Bowier\" was \"a skillful man in work there\", and echoing Carey's assessment that he was more skilled than Crane. However, Crane was preferred by the Lord Chamberlain, Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon.\nBowyer wrote to Lord Cecil in July 1604, requesting that the remaining artillery should not be taken from Berwick in case the deserted fortifications became an encouragement to \"turbulent spirits\". He wanted to retain at least 15 cannon and the Berwick townspeople requested the use of cannon removed from Wark Castle. In November 1605, Bowyer put Berwick and Holy Island on alert after the Gunpowder Plot, watchful for Thomas Percy who was thought to have fled to Scotland.\nBowyer was involved in planning the rebuilding of Berwick Bridge in 1607. Bowyer's letters reveal a distrust of the previous administration of works at Berwick, which he characterised as \"that old shameful thievery\". Subsequently, Bowyer was paid for five years as overseer of the bridge works when he was Mayor of Berwick, (between 1620 and 1625).\nBowyer was involved in the transportation of members of the Graham family in July 1606. The Commissioners of the Middle Shires requested the use of 12 armed horsemen from the Berwick garrison. The Grahams were shipped from Workington and Ravenglass to Ireland.\nIn July 1608, Bowyer visited the silver mine at mine at Hilderstone in West Lothian, which was managed for James VI and I. He discussed the mines with the Earl of Dunbar and met William Godolphin in August. Bowyer was shown a piece of natural silver like a hank of silver wire or thread. Bowyer made efforts to obtain building stone for the Earl of Salisbury from quarries near Berwick.\nBowyer forwarded a letter from the Earl of Salisbury for the Master of Gray at Foulis Castle in October 1608, and made arrangements for letter carrying.\nIn June 1611, Bowyer and the Mayor of Berwick, Leonard Fairley, interviewed John Bright, master of the Thomas of Lynn. Arbella Stuart and her disguised companions had attempted to charter the Thomas to take them to France. Bright said that one of women wore a black riding safeguard and a black hat, reminding him of Moll Cutpurse.\nBowyer died in 1628. His wife was Alice Bowyer, and they had a son, George Bowyer. He acted as his father's lieutenant and was sent to the royal court in December 1606, where he reported on artillery at Norham Castle, Wark, and Lindisfarne.\n\n\n== References ==",

The arena has a capacity of 4,703 (expandable to 5,001 people) in the basketball configuration and up to 7,500 for concerts.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe arena broke ground in April 2000. At the time, Basket Rimini was still playing in Serie A1, the highest-tier level of the Italian basketball league system. Nevertheless, the organizing body of the league (Lega Basket) was planning to remove the exemption that allowed clubs to play in sports halls with a capacity of less than 5,000 seats: this was one of the reasons that led to the construction of a new sports hall.\nIt was inaugurated on December 14, 2002, with a concert by Biagio Antonacci. The first ever basketball game played in the facility was a friendly match between Basket Rimini Crabs and Montepaschi Siena on January 23, 2003, whereas the first official game was a victory against Scafati Basket on the following February 2. In those years the team was playing in the second-tier of the Italian league pyramid, having been relegated at the end of the 2000–01 season.\nIn April 2010, 105 Stadium hosted the Italian Women's Volleyball Cup Final Four.\nAfter the 2010–11 season, Basket Rimini Crabs was unable to participate in the second-tier of the Italian basketball league due to debts, moving to the fourth-tier. At the same time, the team left the 105 Stadium moving back to the old Palasport Flaminio.\nAlthough no longer being the home venue of the Crabs, 105 Stadium sporadically hosted basketball events such as the 2011 Tassoni Trophy, an international tournament between the national teams of Italy, Greece, Poland and Bosnia and Herzegovina, or the 2012 Italian Basketball Supercup. In February 2013, Italy women's national tennis team eliminated United States in the quarterfinals of the 2013 Fed Cup.\nSporting events thus became rarer, but the arena continued to host concerts by national and international artists, as well as conferences and conventions of important companies.\nIn August 2017, it was announced that the naming rights to the 105 Stadium (which had until then belonged to Radio 105) had been acquired by a different Italian radio station, Radio Dimensione Suono, renaming it RDS Stadium.\nIn April 2021, RDS Stadium hosted the 2021 Final Eight of the domestic cup competition of Italian futsal. In February 2023, the arena was the venue of the domestic cup competition of both men's and women's Italian handball.\nIn April 2022, it was announced that RDS Stadium would become the first Italian federal center for dancesport. The last concert took place on December 15, 2023: it was the last event organized here under the twenty-year management by the Stadium S.r.l. company, which organized a total of 1,400 events of various kinds. Conversion work began less than a month later.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of indoor arenas in Italy\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "C9N is a Paraguayan over-the-air news network owned by Remigio Ángel González's Albavisión conglomerate. It was an independent station from 2013 to 2017 and before, an affiliate of SNT with selected local programming.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe station started broadcasting in 1980 as an affiliate of SNT. Until 2013, thanks to an agreement, the it and Sur Televisora Itapúa relayed much of the network's schedule, yet were affiliates in their own right, producing their own local programming for up to six hours each day.\nIn early August 2013, the two SNT affiliates were to be converted into two new national television channels, Televisora del Este (channel 8, Presidente Franco) and Televisora Itapúa SA (channel 7, Encarnación). Marcelo Fleitas, president of SNT, claimed that the two stations were unable to expand their coverage due to technical considerations. Moreover, SNT decided not to have affiliates outside of Asunción, unifying the capital's feed with the rest of the country, under the grounds that when the decision was taken, only Ciudad del Este was still considered a strategic location for Paraguay's economy. The president of the network, raising concerns over Albavisión controlling four television channels in Paraguay, said that SNT, Paravisión, PTV and Sur were independent channels, and that \"it's wrong to say that the owner of Channel 9 now has four channels\". The test broadcasts initially consisted of color bars, and the activation of the signals caused surprise among locals.\nOn August 6, 2013, SNT Televisora del Este pronounced itself about the conversion to a national channel, confirming industry rumors.\nConcerns were being rased at Conatel over the legality of these licenses mere days after the decision was taken. The issue lied in the relays the three stations wanted to build in each other's coverage areas, which did not appear in the 2011 regulations, whose primary intention was to give incentives for the installation of digital terrestrial television signals in the country. A modification was accepted to Catelpar in 2012, after a rejected petition in 2011, under the grounds that the guidelines suggested only new relay stations and not new licenses. In September, members of the Chamber of Deputees demanded an inquiry to the situation. SNT was granted channel 9 in Presidente Franco and channel 8 in Encarnación (adjacent to the existent channels), PTV was granted channel 12 in Fernando de la Mora, channel 9 in Encarnación and channel 13 in the Ybytyruzú Hills, and Sur TV, channel 10 in Fernando de la Mora, channel 7 in Presidente Franco and channel 11 in the Ybytyruzú Hills.\nThe channel took the name Paraná TV in September 2013, when regular test broadcasts started. The logo used by the channel was a modified version of the one used by Peru's ATV reading PTV, which is also owned by the Albavisión conglomerate.\nThe channel's launch was made official on November 12, 2013, with a ceremony held at the station's headquarters in Presidente Franco.\nSpeaking at the 2017 edition of the La TV Que se Viene conference on March 20, 2017, Marcelo Fleitas announced the conversion of PTV into an all-news channel, C9N. The channel would continue broadcasting from its facilities in Presidente Franco, but would change its format.\nOn April 18, 2017, PTV was renamed C9N.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2025 FIVB Volleyball Women's U21 World Championship will be the 23rd edition of the FIVB Volleyball Women's U21 World Championship, contested by the women's national teams under the age of 21 of the members of the Fédération Internationale de Volleyball (FIVB), the sport's global governing body. It will be held in August–September 2024 in a host nation to be determined.\nStarting with this edition, the tournament will be expanded to include 24 teams instead of the 16 teams of previous editions following the decision adopted by FIVB in June 2023.\nChina are the defending champions.\n\n\n== Competition formula changes ==\nIn June 2023 during a three-day meeting in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, the FIVB Board of Administration approved the proposal made by its Volleyball Council to increase the number of participating teams to 24 in its Age Group World Championships (U19 and U21 in both genders). Consequently, the distribution of quotas by confederation for the Women's U21 World Championship was modified regarding previous editions, ensuring one automatic quota for the defending champion and assigning two quotas based on the corresponding FIVB Age Group World Ranking.\nThe new competition formula was in line with the one adopted for the 2023 FIVB Volleyball Boys' U19 World Championship, which was also contested by 24 teams.\n\n\n== Host selection ==\nOn 28 March 2024, FIVB opened the bidding process for member associations whose countries were interested in hosting one of the four Age Group World Championships in 2025 (i.e., U19 Boys' and Girls' World Championships and U21 Men's and Women's World Championships). The expression of interest of the member associations had to be submitted to FIVB by 30 April 2024, 18:00 CEST (UTC+2).\n\n\n== Qualification ==\nA total of 24 national teams will qualify for the final tournament. In addition to the host team and the defending champions who qualified automatically, 21 other teams will qualify through five separate continental competitions which were required to be held no later than 31 December 2024. Two remaining teams will enter the tournament via the Women's U21 FIVB World Ranking (as of 31 December 2024) among the teams not yet qualified.\nThe slot allocation per confederation was set as follows:\n\nDefending champion (China): 1\nAVC (Asia & Oceania): 4\nCAVB (Africa): 3\nCEV (Europe): 6\nCSV (South America): 3\nNORCECA (North, Central America and Caribbean): 4\nHost: 1\nTop teams not yet qualified as per Women's U21 FIVB World Ranking: 2\n\n\n== See also ==\n2025 FIVB Volleyball Girls' U19 World Championship\n2025 FIVB Volleyball Boys' U19 World Championship\n2025 FIVB Volleyball Men's U21 World Championship\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ramathnia (Arabic: ﺍﻟﺭﻣﻨﻨﻴﻪ, \"camel pasture\") is an abandoned village in the center of the Golan Heights, about 10 kilometers east of Katzrin.\nThe village was inhabited alternately in different periods, and from the 19th century the members of the Circassian people lived there, until their departure during the Six Day War. At the end of the 19th century, one of the first modern attempts of Jewish settlement in the Golan Heights was made there.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe village is located on a dome that is 831 meters above sea level, and its houses are built of basalt stones. To the south of it is another dome at a height of 826 m, called Tel a-Ramatnia, and is included in the village lands. There are 11 water sources in the area of the village, but two of them were used by the residents of the village: Birkat A-Ramatania at its foot in the east and the Ein A-Ramatania spring to the north of it.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1885, the \"Beit Yehuda Society\" association, in which personalities such as Moshe Felixon and Shmuel Shulman were active, purchased 15 thousand dunams of the village's lands, and about 35 Jewish families moved to the village and settled in some of its houses. In the winter of 1885, the settlers sowed the land together with the farmers from the village, but only a small number of men remained in the village to work the land, due to the lack of residential buildings. Sometime later it turned out that the land purchase transaction was illegal, it was canceled before it was completed, and the settlers left the place in 1887.\nSome of them were among the founders of the Bnei Yehuda settlement in Bir a-Shakum in the southern Golan. The memory of the Jewish settlers of Ramathania is commemorated today in the name of Mount Bnei Safed in the Bashanit ridge, about 3 km northeast of the village, and of the Bnei Safet Reservoir, about a kilometer east of the village.\n\n\n== Archeology ==\nAbout half a kilometer southeast of the village, many archaeological remains associated with the Roman and Byzantine periods were discovered. Some of the village houses even survived in their place since the Byzantine period, and one of them was probably used as a church. Among the finds: an inscription with the number 850 in Roman numerals, which according to the Anno Domini refers to the year 538 AD [1]; Greek inscriptions, crosses and animal figures. Apparently, the Byzantine settlement was abandoned with the Muslim conquest of the area in 636, since then the settlement has been inhabited and abandoned alternately mainly by nomadic Bedouin tribes. At some point before the end of the 19th century, the village was inhabited by Circassians.\n\n\n== References ==",

Third-placed club Football Center Brest initially confirmed their intentions to get promoted, but in February withdrew their application due to apparent conflict between club's owner and ABFF.

        "content": "Shining Solo (Korean: 빛 나는 Solo) is a South Korean reality television show in the format of a dating show revolved around the members of K-pop boy band Treasure and a cast of female individuals. It was broadcast on SBS on March 3, 2024, and is simultaneously aired on OTT platforms in Japan, Taiwan, and Thailand. It is also available for streaming on Wavve in South Korea and on Viki and YouTube in selected regions.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nShining Solo adds to the list of self-produced content created by YG Entertainment and K-pop boy band Treasure, paired with South Korean broadcasting channel SBS. It embodies the format of a dating show, wherein members of the band split into two groups of five and appeal their charms to the female participants over the course of four days amidst their stay at the \"Treasure Castle\". At midnight, the members are evaluated by the female cast through jewels and voice recorders to earn the title \"Mr. Treasure\", a term for the most popular member.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n=== Part 1 ===\n\n\n=== Part 2 ===\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nWith the rarity of idol-produced content including the opposite gender due to K-pop fans placing themselves into parasocial relationships with the idols they support, Shining Solo sparked displeasure from such fans in Korea prior to its airing, expressing: \"It makes no sense for an idol to appear on a dating show\" and \"I don't necessarily wish to see an idol with someone of the opposite gender\". Its first episode earned a rating of 0.5% (based on Nielsen Korea) due to its late time slot and the domestic fandoms' reaction; however, its virality in Korean community sites piqued favorable reviews from the public recording a viewership of 1% by the sixth episode.Shining Solo was commended for breaking walls within the industry and setting an exemplary method to display boundaries in idol fandoms. It attained positive response from both domestic and international audience. Its success in Japan allowed the series to expand on eight additional streaming platforms, including Amazon Prime Video.\n\n\n=== Viewership ===\nShining Solo ranked first on Lemino following its premiere and received warm reception, quickly spreading by word of mouth. It recorded the highest daily viewed content amidst all K-pop variety productions in its history, and soon ranked first for four consecutive weeks, maintaining a high amount of views on the platform. In Korea, the show received attention on social media after it aired, and found success in Taiwan and Thailand competing against local content. Shining Solo ranked first on Thai OTT platform OneD's entertainment category for four consecutive weeks, and seventh in its overall category by the third week. In Taiwan, the series placed first on friDay Video's entertainment category.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Pam Taylor ARBS (1929–2014) was a Welsh sculptor. She created many bronze sculptures by commission, including several memorials relating to the Royal Air Force.\n\n\n== Life ==\nTaylor was born in Pontypridd in Wales, and studied from 1947 to 1950 at the Sir John Cass College of Art in London, where teachers included Edward Bainbridge Copnall. She exhibited works at many galleries. She became a member of the Society of Portrait Sculptors in 1975, and an associate member of the Royal British Society of Sculptors in 1980.\n\n\n== Works ==\nTaylor's works include the following:\nA bust of William Shakespeare, by the Deutsche Oper Berlin in Charlottenburg, Berlin, Germany, was presented by the City of London Corporation in 1987, on the occasion of the 750th anniversary of Berlin. Opernplatz (\"Opera Place\"), where the bust is sited, was renamed Shakespeareplatz. Another bust of Shakespeare was commissioned by the City of London Corporation for the restored Globe Theatre in London.A memorial to the RAF Commonwealth and Allied Air Forces who served in World War II was unveiled in 1989 on Plymouth Hoe in Devon. A bronze statue, \"The Unknown Airman\", is on a plinth of Cornish granite.A bronze statue of an airman, on a stone plinth, was unveiled in 1999 in Pier Gardens in Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire. It commemorates the members of RAF North Coates Strike Wing who served in World War II.Statues made in 2001 of Bob Dylan and Woody Guthrie, commissioned by Felix Dennis, are in the Garden of Heroes and Villains nea Dorsington, Warwickshire.\"The Long March\", in the Royal Air Force Museum London, was unveiled in 2003 by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. It is a memorial to RAF prisoners of war who died during a march westward in early 1945 from their prisoner-of-war camps, enforced in order to prevent their being liberated by advancing Russian forces. The bronze sculpture shows a PoW dragging a makeshift sled containing his possessions. The Royal Air Force Museum also contains bronze busts made by Taylor in 1978 of Sir Douglas Bader and Sir Arthur Harris.\"Canvey Old and New\", in Labworth Park, Canvey Island in Essex, was commissioned by Essex County Council and unveiled in 2005. A competition was organised by Essex Youth Service, and the winning design by Vicky Moore was sculpted by Taylor. A hand rising from the water holds a representation of Canvey Island.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Pam Taylor at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "José Rafael Marcano Santelli is a Venezuelan engineer and videogame developer.\n\n\n== First years and education ==\nJosé Rafael discovered programming at the age of eleven and has stated that by that time he decided that it was the profession he wanted to pursue. His first video game console was an Atari 2600 in the late 1970s. He began studying with specialized books and magazines, as well as learning English, and started saving part of his allowance to buy a computer. His parents decided to make up the rest of the price to buy an 8-bit Sinclair. Later he was able to acquire a 16k memory computer and with them he learned to program in BASIC.\nHe began studying systems engineering at the Universidad Metropolitana in Caracas, culminating his studies at the International Computing School, in the Chacao municipality.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1995 he founded the Mediatech videogame studio with three partners, a project he had always wanted to carry out, and in 1996 he launched the educational videogame series \"Las aventuras de Umi\", which included the 1999 title \"Umi en la selva\". At the time, Mediatech was one of only two or three video game developers in Latin America, and Las aventuras de Umi sold more than 350,000 copies, a very successful release. The studio also worked with the Children's Museum of Caracas, for which more than ten advergames were developed. The first exhibit worked on was Biomes, for the Ecology area of the Museum. According to Marcano, Mediatech's contact with the Museum was kept between 1994 and 2014, and the company developed at least 80% of the interactive kiosks in the institution.\nIn 1999, José Rafael obtained authorization to develop Mazinger Z video games on PCs from Gō Nagai, the creator of the franchise, during a visit of the mangaka to Caracas. After the authorization, the videogames \"Mazinger versus Big Mazinger\", in 2001, and \"Mazinger Z saves Venezuela\", in 2004, were released.\nIn 2015, José Rafael migrated with his family to Bogotá, Colombia.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Entrevista Globovision 1997 con \"Las Aventuras de Umi\"\".

He was Oiva Kallio's brother and worked with his brother.\nKallio's parents were the vicar, county reverend Pietari Antero Kallio (formerly Öst), and Lydia Charlotta Durchman. He graduated from the Vaasa Lyceum in 1896, and he graduated as an architect from the Polytechnic Institute in 1900. He initially worked in the office of architect Gustaf Nyström and in the architectural office of Nyström-Petrelius-Penttilä until he founded a joint office in 1903 with architect Werner von Essen and construction master E. Ikäläinen . This office designed several residential buildings in Helsinki. Kallio founded his own office in 1913, and his first significant work was the Tampere Theater, completed in the same year.\nKallio participated with his brother Oiva Kallio in several architectural competitions in the 1910s and 1920s, and based on their competition proposals, they designed, among other things, the facades of the Imatra power plant. Kauno S. Kallio also designed ten Kansallis-Osake-Bank branch office buildings between 1920 and 1937. Kallio then specialized in the design of church buildings, and in addition to new buildings, he also designed repairs and restorations of churches.\n\n\n== Selected works ==\nHartman's house, Vaasa Market Square (1913) \nTampere Theater (1913) \nAlavu Church (1914)\nJyväskylä rectory (1928)\nRepair of Vihti Church (1928–1929)\nJämsä Church (1929)\nTaivalkoski Church (1932)\nExtension of Selini's house, Tampere (1934)\nKuopio Art Museum\nPohjaslahti Church, Mänttä-Vilppula\nHiiden tribe burial monument \nKitinoja village church, Seinäjoki (1952)\nEno's Bell Tower, Joensuu (1957) \n\n\n== References ==",

Kallio.\n\nThe shape of the Alavus church is a long church covered by a high aum roof. The altarpiece painted by Oskari Paatela shows the taking of Jesus from the cross. The church's current organ was acquired in 1970 and renovated in 2006–2007. \nThe most significant renovation to the church was made in 1992, when the back part of the church was converted into a vestibule. At the same time, a nursery room, a bridal couple's room, and a separate space for sound reproduction and television broadcasts were built. \nThe church also functions as a road church in the summer.\nAlavus Church and the Chapel of Memories, located on the site of Alavus's first church, are classified as Finland's nationally significant built cultural environments \n\n\n== Previous parts ==\nAt the site of the Alavus church, there was first a pulpit, which was completed in 1674. The belfry was completed in 1734. The next church was completed in 1746, and it was probably designed by Henrik Katila from Vöyri. It was replaced in 1825 by a church, which was largely based on the drawings of the Vimpeli church. Juho Kohlström designed the new belfry and completed it at the same time. This third church burned down in 1912, but the church remained. The three candlesticks in the central aisle were also saved, and they are in use in the current church. The oldest candle crown dates from 1828.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Nipper Winmarti also recorded as Nipper Winmati (c. 1920 – 1993) was a Pitjantjatjara man who worked as an Aboriginal tracker at the Uluṟu-Kata Tjuṯa National Park where he was also recognised as a Traditional Owner. Winmarti worked as a tracker following the death of Azaria Chamberlain in 1980 and believed that baby Azaria had been taken by a dingo; he was the only Aboriginal tracker to give evidence at the first inquest.Winmarti was present at the hand back of Uluṟu to Traditional Owners in 1985 and is featured in many images captured that day alongside Sir Ninian Stephen.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nFew early records exist but Winmarti was likely born in Areyonga and he later married Barbara Winmarti (also known as Tjukadoo/Tjikadu) with whom he had four children. He also spent much of his life in Curtin Springs and Docker River (Kaltukatjara) with frequent travel made to Uluṟu.During World War II Winmarti was employed on a 'Native labour gang' near Darwin and was likely there during the Bombing of Darwin.In August 1980 Winmarti was brought in as one of five trackers following the death of Azaria Chamberlain and became that only tracker to give evidence at the first inquest and clearly stated that the baby had been taken by a dingo. He told the Commission \"[i]t was the baby the dingo was carrying and as he was trying to climb up the rise of the sand-hill it was really hard for him to climb up\" and assured them that he had seen the tracks with [his] own eyes. They had gone and come out [of the tent]\". This testimony was widely shared by the media. At the same inquest he also stated that he believed Lindy Chamberlain was a \"poor harmless woman\".Many doubted his claims and, during a later TV interview with Channel 10 (Australia), he told the TV audience that he was a Christian and he did not tell lies.Winmarti's wife Barbara also worked as a tracker during this incident and agreed with her husband about the presence of a dingo. It is also recorded that, on the night Azaria was taken, Winmarti and Barbara where very distressed and that they \"repeated their story several times to anyone who would listen and were both quite upset. They insisted something was very, very wrong\".His testimony being taken so lightly has been seen by many as a failure of the justice system because his evidence as an expert was devalued while flawed forensic evidence was accepted. This was likely due, in part, to that Winmarti gave his evidence in the Pitjantjatjara language and the difficulty of translating this into English. He was not called to give evidence at any further inquests or trial of Lindy or Michael Chamberlain.On 18 August 1983 Winmarti also worked as a tracker looking for Douglas Crabbe after he drove his truck into the crowded bar of the Inland Motel near Uluṟu.In 1985 Winmarti was present at the hand back of Uluṟu to Traditional Owners and accepted ownership of it from the then Governor-General of Australia Sir Ninan Stephen and, as a part of this ceremony Winmarti handed the ownership to his grandson Kiatipi to symbolise ancestral links. In coverage around this event Winmarti stated that he wanted to ensure it was called Uluṟu and not Ayers Rock and that Maggie Springs become known as Mutitjulu Waterhole. He had been a key witness in the land claim.Winmarti died in 1993 and his death was discussed in Northern Territory Legislative Assembly where Neil Bell spoke about the many times that they had met and all that Winmarti had taught him of Pitjantjara culture. Bell said:\nIn the last year or so, Nipper became very aware of his increasing frailty. His dignity never diminished during that time. It was as solid as the Rock which defined him and his place in the order of things. In some ways, death loses a little of its sting with the demise of holders of such an ancient and proud tradition. His presence will be felt whenever we look at the Rock and trace with the eye the tracks of the Mala men carved out over centuries.\nBell had also, in 1977, donated recordings of songs and speech in Pitjantjatjara by Winmarti to AIATSIS.Gary Cartwright also spoke of Winmarti, who he had met in 1968, in Parliament. He spoke of him with great regard and said of him:\nNipper Winmarti was a great man in both western and Aboriginal ways. He was a symbol of Uluru, as Uluru is a symbol of Australia.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Phantom Parrot is a 2023 documentary film that documents the ordeal of Muhammad Rabbani when he is arrested at the UK border. It was directed by Kate Stonehill.\nPhantom Parrot tells the story of Muhammad Rabbani, a human rights activist who works with people who have been subject to torture and other human rights violations. Rabbani is stopped at the border and asked for the passwords of his electronic devices. Rabbani refuses to give up his passwords and so is arrested under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000.  Rabbani is the director of CAGE (organisation), who fight against mass surveillance in the wake of the War on Terror. During the film, we learn that Rabbani's stop may have been targeted, as he had documents on his devices relating to individuals who had been tortured and mistreated by the American government. The film explores how individuals can be arrested and imprisoned simply for protecting data that relates to human rights violations.\nThe title Phantom Parrot refers to a government programme called Phantom Parrot, that was first discovered in a leaked document by Edward Snowden. The policy allows for targeted  stopping of people at the border, under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act, in order to download data from their devices.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "NGC 2832 is an elliptical galaxy in the constellation Lynx. The galaxy lies about 290 million light years away from Earth, which means, given its apparent dimensions, that NGC 2832 is approximately 250,000 light years across. It was discovered by William Herschel on December 7, 1785.\nNGC 2832 is a type-cD galaxy and is the brightest member of Abell 779 galaxy cluster. NGC 2832 appears to interact tidally with NGC 2831, which lies about 25 arcseconds away and shares the same halo with NGC 2832.

        "content": "Gennadi Milinevsky is a Ukrainian atmosphere scientist and a professor of Physics and Mathematics at Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv (KNU). He is a professor at the International Center for Future Science within the College of Physics at Jilin University (JLU) and holds a position as Principal Scientist at the Main Astronomical Observatory of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine (NAS).Milinevsky's primary research interest lies in atmospheric studies, particularly focusing on climate change processes and their effects on ecosystems. He has participated in Antarctic expeditions and contributed to Antarctic scientific research, researching the effects of ozone hole dynamics on the Antarctic ecosystem and the impact of radioactive contamination on the environment. He has published over 100 papers in scientific journals, including Climate Dynamics, Journal of Southern Hemisphere Earth Systems Science, and Antarctic Science. He is the recipient of Fedorov Award from the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine and Medals \"For Service\" II Stage and III Stage from the Government of Ukraine.Milinevsky has been a Member of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) since 1990 and the European Geosciences Union (EGU) since 2012. He holds the position of Executive Editor for the Ukrainian Antarctic Journal and Associate Editor for the Frontiers in Remote Sensing.\n\n\n== Education and early career ==\nMilinevsky earned his M.S. degree in astronomy and astrophysics from Kyiv State University in 1974, followed by a Ph.D. in geophysics from the Institute of Geophysics in 1980. He held the role of Senior Researcher at the Space Physics Laboratory of KNU from 1974 to 1990. During this period, he obtained a Doctor of Science degree in geophysics from KNU while engaging in space experiments on plasma formations in the ionosphere and atmospheric clouds via rocket launches from the USSR's Kapustin Yar. He conducted scientific voyages aboard ocean vessels launching meteorological missiles across diverse oceanic regions and served as the Base Commander and Geophysicist during the First Ukrainian Antarctic Expedition at the Vernadsky Station. At Vernadsky Station, his team recorded vital observations for a decade with a focus on meteorology, ionospheric sounding, ozone hole studies, and magnetic measurements.\n\n\n== Career ==\nMilinevsky was involved in the transfer of the Faraday Antarctic Base of British Antarctic Survey, UK, to Ukraine and held the position of deputy director of Sciences at the National Antarctic Scientific Center of Ukraine (NANC) from 1999 to 2006. In 2006, he took the position of Head for the Department of Space Physics at KNU, followed by his tenure as the Head of the Space Physics Laboratory until 2021. Concurrently, he held the positions of Principal Scientist of NANC from 2006 to 2023 and participated as a collaborator on the CCMVal Project 42. He was the Principal Investigator for the CRDF project UKG2-2969-KV-09 focusing on atmospheric aerosols and led international AERONET sites as well as contributing to the Maritime Aerosol Network (MAN) study, which utilized Microtops II sunphotometers. His contributions expanded with him serving as an Adviser to the Ukraine Delegation on Commission Conservation Marina Living Resources and participating in five Ukrainian Antarctic Season Expeditions leading the 6th, 7th, and 10th Expeditions. Since 2001, he has served as the Program Coordinator in Ukraine for the University of South Carolina Chornobyl Research Initiative and holds the position of Professor at JLU. Furthermore, he has been serving as the co-chair for Polar Atmospheric Chemistry at the Tropopause action group of SCAR and Program Coordinator of the Ukraine satellite mission Aerosol-UA within the Space Program of NAS since 2014.\n\n\n== Research ==\nMilinevsky has directed his research towards the stratosphere, tropopause, ozone layer, ozone depletion, aerosols, planetary waves, and sudden stratospheric warmings, alongside exploring space-based techniques and methods for remote sensing of aerosols. His research interests include microwave/millimeter-wave technique used for atmosphere research, climate change processes, and their impact on the ecosystem.\n\n\n=== Atmospheric aerosol ===\nMilinevsky led the coordination of the Aerosol-UA project in collaboration with the Main Astronomical Observatory which involved installing a polarimeter on a satellite to measure aerosol parameters, including their microphysical and chemical properties in the atmosphere, thereby accurately identifying the location, quantity, and composition of aerosols. Through a collaborative effort, he contributed to a study that provided an overview of polarimetric observations and their application in characterizing atmospheric aerosols addressing the challenges and achievements in deriving aerosol properties from polarimetric data. Furthermore, he investigated the inadvertent cooling effect of the ozone hole formation on inner Antarctica, showcasing how subsequent recovery, vital for ozone restoration, posed challenges by potentially altering atmospheric greenhouse gas dynamics and critical ultraviolet radiation levels essential for life's evolution.\n\n\n=== Environmental research ===\nMilinevsky as a member of team led by Timothy Mousseau from South Carolina University, has conducted research investigating the effects of radiation exposure within the Chernobyl-contaminated area. Their research on Chernobyl-exposed barn swallows revealed reduced reproduction and survival rates, suggesting significant negative impacts of radioactive contamination on migratory passerines. The later work also revealed that chronic low-dose radiation reduced breeding success in Myodes glareolus near Chernobyl, with no threshold, and food supplementation benefited only populations in low-radioactive areas, indicating broader ecosystem instability post-nuclear accidents.In his Antarctic ecology research, Milinevsky examined climate change's effects on Antarctic krill and ecosystems, highlighting the threat posed by environmental stressors like sea ice decline and ocean warming, emphasizing the need for urgent research and precautionary measures by CCAMLR. Additionally, his study on the changes in plant populations on the Argentine Islands centered on two indigenous flowering plants, Deschampsia antarctica and Colobanthus quitensis, revealing a plateau in their populations due to habitat limitations and a slowdown in local climate warming.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n1998 – Medal for Service III Stage, President of Ukraine\n2016 – Special Contribution Award, Akademik Vernadsky Station\n2021 – Fedorov Award, National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine\n2021 – Medal for Service II Stage, Government of Ukraine\n2023 – Academic, Engineering Academy of Ukraine\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Selected books ===\nContributions to understanding climate interactions: stratospheric ozone (2022) ISBN 978-9663604718\n\n\n=== Selected articles ===\nSmirnov, A., Holben, B.

        "content": "Cecil Green (September 13, 1924 in Riverside, California - December 3, 1994 in Lakeport, California) was an American politician from California and a member of the Democratic Party.\nGreen started his public service in 1971 when was appointed to the Norwalk planning commission. In 1974 he was elected to Norwalk city council and was reelected in 1978, 1982 and 1986.\nIn 1987, Green ran in a special election for the California State Senate seat left open after incumbent Paul B. Carpenter (D-Cerritos) resigned to join the California State Board of Equalization. In an upset, he defeated assemblyman Wayne Grisham (R-La Mirada) by more than 9 points, a wider than expected margin. In fact, Grisham's loss was such that Democrats saw it as a sign of weakness and went on to oust him from his assembly seat the following year.\nIn 1988 Green faced a tough reelection for a full term against Republican Cerritos city councilman Don Knabe (who had originally planned to run in the special election but deferred to Grisham). After an expensive battle, Green defeated Knabe by just over 1%.\nGreen did not seek reelection in 1992 and retired from elective office. He died December 3, 1994, at the age of 70.\n\n\n== Electoral history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2024 Moscow City Duma election will take place on 8 September 2024, on common election day. All 45 seats in the City Duma will be up for reelection.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe 2019 Moscow City Duma election was marked by mass protests in the city, sparked by the disqualification of several candidates allied to Aleksey Navalny, Dmitry Gudkov, Yabloko or local citizen movements. The subsequent backlash and Smart Voting tactic, proposed by Navalny's Team, resulted in Mayor Sergey Sobyanin-backed Independents winning a slim majority of just 25 seats in the 45-member Moscow City Duma and losing the popular vote to CPRF (although in at least three constituencies Mayoral Office backed Communist candidates). Pro-government forces in the City Duma established two factions – United Russia (19 members) and My Moscow (5 members), while opposition was represented by Communist Party (13 members), Yabloko (4 members) and A Just Russia (3 members).\nThe first change in the Duma composition occurred in August 2020, when Communist Vice Speaker Nikolay Gubenko from District 37 died after struggling with illness. In October 2020 another Communist member, Oleg Sheremetyev of District 19, left the chamber as he was expelled after being found guilty of fraud. Both vacant seats were filled in the 2021 by-elections: pediatrician and municipal deputy Yelena Kats flipped District 19 for United Russia, and former State Duma member Vladimir Ryzhkov – District 37 for Yabloko. Ryzhkov, however, left Russia in summer 2022 and officially resigned from the Duma in late January 2024, leaving his seat vacant until the next convocation.\nIn March 2021 deputies Yelena Shuvalova (District 44) and Dmitry Loktev (District 2) were expelled from the CPRF faction in the City Duma for \"systematically discrediting the faction\". Shuvalova was previously expelled from the party in June 2020 for regular insubordination, including failure to pay party fees, challenging faction leader Nikolay Zubrilin, and collaboration with liberal opposition, while Loktev was removed in February 2021 for voting against city budget. A third Communist deputy, Yevgeny Stupin (District 20), was expelled from the party in March 2023, a month later he was sacked from the faction and later left Russia. Three Moscow City Duma members were also declared foreign agents by the Ministry of Justice: Darya Besedina (Yabloko) in January 2023, Yevgeny Stupin (CPRF) and Mikhail Timonov (A Just Russia) in June 2023.\nWith the last Moscow redistricting occurring in 2014, a new Moscow City Duma map should be enacted for the 2024 election. In late December 2023 a new district map was proposed and later enacted by the Moscow City Duma. The new map was heavily criticised as gerrymandered by the deputies themselves, especially considering that under the enacted map districts of Sergey Mitrokhin, Mikhail Timonov, Yekaterina Yengalycheva and Lyubov Nikitina were virtually eliminated.\n\n\n== Electoral system ==\nUnder current election laws, the City Duma is elected for a term of five years by first-past-the-post voting in 45 constituencies. Currently Moscow is the only federal subject of Russia using full majoritarian system to elect members of the regional legislature.\n\n\n== Candidates ==\n45 single-mandate constituencies were formed in Moscow. To register candidates in single-mandate constituencies need to collect 3% of signatures of registered voters in the constituency.\nThe following parties were relieved from the necessity to collect signatures:\n\nUnited Russia\nCommunist Party of the Russian Federation\nA Just Russia — Patriots — For Truth\nLiberal Democratic Party of Russia\nNew People\n\n\n=== Declared candidates with

        "content": "The World Central Kitchen drone strikes occurred on 1 April 2024, when Israeli drones targeted a three-car convoy belonging to the World Central Kitchen (WCK) in the Gaza Strip, killing seven aid workers. The attack occurred despite the WCK having coordinated their route with the Israeli military, which both parties have acknowledged. The workers had been overseeing the transfer of a shipment of food from a makeshift pier to a warehouse some distance away in the northern Gaza Strip, which has been pushed close to famine by Israel's invasion and blockade during the Israel–Hamas war.\nThe attack occurred three days after a unanimous ICJ ruling in the ongoing Genocide Convention case that ordered Israel to ensure the unhindered flow of aid into Gaza. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) acknowledged that their drone operators fired three missiles in five minutes at three of the WCK's cars, with some survivors of the first strike boarding the second car, which was then hit by a second missile, and some survivors of the second strike boarding the third car, which was in turn struck by a third missile. All seven aid workers were killed, and their bodies were sent to Shuhada al-Aqsa Hospital. They held Australian, British, Palestinian, Polish, and dual American-Canadian citizenships.\nIsrael claimed responsibility for the killings, and its military launched an investigation into the incident, which led to the dismissal of two officers. The investigation was rejected as lacking credibility by the WCK, which stated that the IDF cannot investigate its own wrongdoings. WCK founder, Spanish chef José Andrés, has said Israel attacked the convoy \"systematically\" and \"deliberately\". WCK called for an independent, third-party investigation into the attacks including whether they were carried out intentionally or otherwise violated international law.\nThe attack drew widespread international condemnation, including by Australia, Qatar, Ireland, Egypt, Poland, China, the Holy See, the European Union, and the United States. The attack led the World Central Kitchen to pause its operations in the Gaza Strip, along with other humanitarian and aid organizations operating there. Statements made by the Israeli ambassador in Poland on the incident led to a diplomatic spat between the two countries. The event led to widespread allegations from political scientists, commentators, and genocide scholars that Israel is deliberately using starvation as a weapon of war, which is a war crime.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn 27 October 2023 Israel invaded the Gaza Strip in response to the 7 October attacks by Hamas. A severe humanitarian crisis has developed since the start of the invasion with healthcare in a state of collapse and shortages of food, clean water, medicine and fuel caused by the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip. The Gaza Strip has had limited humanitarian aid allowed through Israeli controlled checkpoints which has exacerbated the crisis. The drone strikes came hours after the WCK charity, which  was also delivering food services in Israel  after 7 October, brought a shipload of 100 tonnes of food from Cyprus to the northern Gaza Strip.\nIn March 2024, experts, such as the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, warned that Gaza might already be experiencing famine; while Jeremy Konyndyk, the president of Refugees International, stated that \"large-scale famine mortality\" would soon begin. Widespread civilian deaths in Gaza and the initial 7 October attack have led to accusations of war crimes against Israel and Hamas. There have been a number of reported attacks on civilian aid seekers and workers, with more than 173 UNRWA staff killed by Israeli forces during the Israel–Hamas war.\nThere has been rhetoric by Israeli politicians against the distribution of aid in Gaza. Giora Eiland, a retired Major General, wrote that: \"In order to make the siege effective, we have to prevent others from giving assistance to Gaza.\" His words were quoted by the South African delegation at the ICJ.\nThree days before the killings the International Court of Justice (ICJ) had ruled unanimously, in response to a second South African request for additional provisional measures in the ongoing Genocide Convention case, that Israel must enable the unhindered flow of aid into Gaza and act \"without delay\" to allow the \"provision... of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance\".. In the ruling the ICJ said Gaza was \"no longer facing only a risk of famine\" but \"famine is setting in\" and that, according to UN observers, 31 people, including 27 children, had already died of malnutrition and dehydration.\nTwo days before the drone strikes, a car of the WCK was hit by an IDF sniper. The WCK filed a complaint with Israel over this incident and demanded guaranteeing safety of their workers.\n\n\n== Incident ==\nOn 1 April 2024, targeted Israeli drone strikes killed seven WCK aid workers, who were travelling in three of the WCK's cars in the Gaza Strip. Sky News estimates that the strikes occurred between 10.30 and 11 pm. Since the wreckages of the cars were around 2.5 km (1.6 mi) apart, The Washington Post reported that this indicated that some of the cars were able to continue driving after the attack began, and Financial Times concluded that the cars were \"hit separately\".\nWorld Central Kitchen said that it had coordinated its movements with the Israeli Defense Force when the convoy was hit. WCK said the strike occurred in spite of vehicle logos and \"coordinating movements\" with Israeli forces in the \"deconflicted zone\". \nHaaretz, citing Israeli defense sources, described that after a drone missile hit one World Central Kitchen car, some of this car's passengers boarded another World Central Kitchen car, which \"continued to drive and even notified the people responsible that they were attacked, but, seconds later\", this car was also hit by a drone missile; finally the third car picked up some of the wounded from the second car, then a third drone missile struck the third car.\n\n\n== Victims ==\nSeven people were killed; they were recovered by the Palestine Red Crescent Society in a \"challenging operation\" and taken to Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah. The victims were seen wearing protective gear showing the charity's logo. They were taken to Abu Yousef al-Najjar Hospital in southern Gaza to be evacuated to Egypt. \nAmong the seven World Central Kitchen aid workers were confirmed British, Australian, Polish, Palestinian and dual American-Canadian nationals. The three British victims worked for Solace Global, a security company based in Poole, Dorset, England.\nThe casualties included: \n\nSaif Abu Taha (Saifeddin Issam Ayad Abutaha), a 26-year-old Palestinian local from Rafah, who had worked as a driver for WCK since the start of the year.\nDamian Soból, a 35-year-old Polish national from Przemyśl. Soból had worked with the WCK since 2022, engaging in relief efforts in Russian-invaded Ukraine. In February 2023, he traveled to earthquake-stricken Elbistan in Turkey with aid. In September 2023, he helped earthquake victims in Morocco. He then helped Gaza refugees in Egypt and later in Gaza itself.\nLalzawmi \"Zomi\" Frankcom, a 43-year-old Australian national.\nJames Henderson, a 33-year-old British national who had served in the Royal Marines, he was a private security contractor with Solace Global.\nJohn Antony Chapman, a 57-year-old British national who had served in the Royal Marines, he was a private security contractor with Solace Global.\nJames Kirby, a 47-year-old British national. He was a former soldier and a private security contractor with Solace Global.\nJacob Flickinger, a 33-year-old dual Canadian-American citizen from Quebec. He was a former soldier in the Canadian Armed Forces as an infantryman in the Royal 22nd Regiment.\n\n\n== IDF dismissals ==\nTwo Israeli soldiers were fired for their participation in the killings. The most senior of the two is commander Nochi Mandel, a West Bank settler and \"religious nationalist\". In January 2024, Mandel, along with 130 other IDF reserve officers, signed an open letter imploring that Gaza be deprived of humanitarian aid and that \"humanitarian supplies and the operation of hospitals inside Gaza City\" not be allowed.\nLeading UK barrister Michael Mansfield reckoned the letter \"is plainly relevant to a particular state of mind\" of those behind the bombings, indicating that \"the target of the Israeli army is [not] primarily Hamas but Gaza as a whole by weaponising aid under siege conditions.\"\n\n\n== Investigations ==\nIn its initial response, the IDF did not confirm whether it conducted the airstrike, and instead said it would open an investigation. Several hours later, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged that the Israeli military had killed the seven \"innocent\" aid workers, saying it was \"unintentional\".\nOn 5 April, edited footage of the attack was shown to reporters, but it did not show the moment the convoy was struck. The complete video has not been released publicly.\nBellingcat analyzed the car wreckage and concluded that the vehicles bore \"the hallmarks of a precision strike by inert or low-yield missiles\", thus confirming that an \"Israeli airstrike\" was responsible as \"only the IDF has the capability to conduct\" precision strikes in the local area. The first targeted car was geolocated at 31.4118, 34.3231; while the second was geolocated 800 meters (0.5 mi) away at 31.4168, 34.3290; and the third at 31.4005, 34.3115 around 1,600 meters (1.0 mi) away from the first vehicle. The first two locations of the vehicles were on a road identified by the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) as being an \"Accessible Road for Humanitarian Aid,\" while the third was in a field immediately next to this road. Bellingcat further concluded that it was \"likely\" that the World Central Kitchen markings on at least one of the car roofs \"would have been visible from above when the strike was carried out\" depending on the imaging capabilities of the system used.\nAl-Jazeera Sanad analyzed \"open-source information, witness testimonies, and images from the site\", concluding that the Israeli Defense Forces' attacks were \"intentional\", having \"targeted three vehicles belonging to WCK, one at a time\", with the damage to the second and third cars \"suggesting that the cars were targeted from the air\". The WCK markings on the cars led Al-Jazeera Sanad to conclude that WCK \"were in compliance and there had been prior coordination between WCK and the Israeli army about the movements\". An eyewitness to the first strike, Hasan al-Shorbagi, said that the injured from the first strike were transferred to a second armoured car to continue travelling.\nThe BBC cited two weapons experts analyzing the car wreckages to conclude that the cars were likely struck by drone missiles. The BBC's own analysis of the distance between the three vehicles indicated that multiple strikes occurred.\nCNN reported that the Israeli attack \"appears to have consisted of multiple precision strikes\", citing a weapons researcher stating that the result \"seems consistent with munitions deployed\" by drones.\nHaaretz quoted one Israeli defense source as saying that \"the units in the field decide to launch attacks without any preparation, in cases that have nothing to do with protecting our forces.\" Further citing Israeli defense sources, Haaretz reported that the destroyed cars \"were clearly marked on the roof and sides\" as belonging to the World Central Kitchen, and had \"travelled along a route preapproved and coordinated with the IDF\", but \"the war room of the unit responsible for security of the route ordered the drone operators to attack\", due to \"suspicion that a terrorist was travelling with the convoy\"; the supposed terrorist was \"an armed man\" in the aid truck being escorted by the cars to a food warehouse in Deir al-Balah; the cars had left the aid truck behind at the warehouse, and the \"armed man did not leave the warehouse\", but Israeli strikes from an Elbit Hermes 450 drone were still ordered on the cars.\n\n\n=== IDF investigation ===\nThe IDF investigation was led by Major General (ret.) Yoav Har-Even, president and CEO of Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, and on 4 April 2024 reported their initial investigatory findings regarding the incident. The IDF admitted that the WCK did coordinate their plans for the night with the IDF, but claimed that internally within the IDF, these plans were not communicated to the IDF's operational forces. The IDF claimed that before the incident, the WCK cars had escorted an aid truck that had a gunman on its roof that fired a gun. A BBC reporter said IDF's evidence for this claim was a \"blurry\" video that it had not released publicly. The IDF then claimed they tried to contact the WCK but were unable to; BBC News commented that in the Gaza Strip, phone communication is \"patchy\" and the IDF itself has prohibited aid agencies from using radios. A second gunman was spotted at the warehouse joining the first gunman, leading to the drone operators assuming that they were of Hamas, claimed the IDF. As a result, according to the IDF, the IDF drone operators believed that the WCK cars were being used by Hamas militants, and further suspected that they saw a person entering a WCK car with \"a rifle but at the end of the day it was a bag\", in a \"misclassification\". The IDF claimed that the drone operators believed that the WCK aid workers had remained at the warehouse with the aid truck, instead of leaving in the cars. The IDF additionally claimed that the drone operators could not see the WCK cars' markings at night, with BBC News commenting that the \"drone footage also appears to confirm that\". This assessment was based on \"somewhat blurry\" video footage shown at a press briefing but not released to the public.\nHence, according to the IDF, its drone operators fired three missiles at the WCK's cars, destroying the cars one by one between 23:09 to 23:13, despite two surviving aid workers of the first strike boarding the second car, which was then hit by a second missile, and some survivors of the second strike boarding the third car, which was in turn struck by a third missile; with the result being that all seven aid workers were killed by the IDF strikes. The IDF claimed that an IDF colonel and an IDF major approved the order for a drone attack with no military lawyer present, but the second strike was done with no updated approval. The IDF investigatory result was that while \"there was no information on gunmen in the second and third vehicles, they too were attacked, within minutes of each other, for no real reason ... The attack on the three vehicles was carried out in serious violation of the relevant orders and instructions.\" The IDF has dismissed a major who led the fire support team, as well as a colonel who was a brigade chief of staff. The IDF also reprimanded the Southern Command divisional commander, brigade commander and general in charge.\n\n\n==== Response to IDF investigation ====\nWCK rejected the IDF's investigation as lacking credibility, with the WCK's founder, José Andrés, saying in a statement that: \"The IDF cannot credibly investigate its own failure in Gaza. It's not enough to simply try to avoid further humanitarian deaths, which have now approached close to 200. All civilians need to be protected, and all innocent people in Gaza need to be fed and safe. And all hostages must be released.\" Andrés in an interview with ABC News contested the IDF's claim of poor vision, insisting that the brightly colored logos on their white cars could be seen by those drones even in the dark of night.\nThe Telegraph wrote that the investigation sparked \"claims of bias\": it was led by \"president and CEO of Rafael Advanced Defense Systems\" and \"the IDF is one of Rafael's biggest buyers\". The Guardian reported that the investigation was hurriedly completed and that it had failed to answer important questions including why Israeli commanders violated their military's operational rules, and why the soldiers were unaware that humanitarian cars were operating in the area with Israeli permission. It further added that the investigation's findings will likely renew skepticism over the Israeli military's decision-making processes, as aid groups, human rights organisations and Palestinians have repeatedly accused Israel of reckless firing, which Israel denies. Speaking to Politico, an unnamed U.S. official stated Israel will \"do and say whatever is necessary to maintain the status quo and I have little hope their investigation will be transparent or honest\".\nInternational law scholar Douglas Guilfoyle  writes that the attack \"was almost certainly a war crime. Indeed, I struggle to see how any other conclusion is possible.\"\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\n\n=== Effects on humanitarian efforts in Gaza ===\nHumanitarian and aid organizations operating in the Gaza Strip suspended their operations after the attack. Among them are Anera and Project Hope with Anera's media relations officer Steve Fake stating that \"The blatant nature of the attack on WCK's convoy has proven that aid workers are currently under attack,\". Due to the strike, WCK aid ships going to Gaza carrying 240 tons of aid have returned to Cyprus, citing safety concerns.\n\n\n=== Reaction from the bereaved families ===\nThe family of Zomi Frankcom has called for an investigation and possible charges of war crimes. The parents of Jacob Flickinger called his death a \"crime\", they rejected Israel's apology, requested an independent investigation and for the US to cease providing military aid to Israel while they use \"food as a weapon\". James Henderson's brother said that the killings of people on a humanitarian mission was \"inexcusable\". \"Accountability is the only hope of justice I have\", he said. \"I don't believe our government will hold the correct people to account, but I guarantee that our government will sell weapons to Israel, which may in turn be used to kill our fellow citizens. It's hard to comprehend that.\"\n\n\n=== Diplomatic fallout ===\nIsrael's ambassador to Poland Yacov Livne, a few hours after the strikes on the WCK convoy, made several posts on social media, rejecting accusations of committing a war crime made by Deputy Speaker of the Polish Sejm Krzysztof Bosak. He also recalled an incident in the Polish Sejm when Bosak's party MP Grzegorz Braun extinguished a Hanukkah menorah with a fire extinguisher. The ambassador wrote that the \"extreme right and left in Poland\" were accusing Israel of \"intentional murder in the attack.\" He ended his statement by saying that anti-Semites will always remain anti-Semites. The ambassador's statement sparked outrage. Polish President Andrzej Duda described it as \"not very fortunate and, in short, outrageous,\" while Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said he did not approve of the way the ambassador spoke about the strikes on the convoy and that he expected words of apology. The ambassador was summoned to the Polish Foreign Ministry on 5 April 2024, where he met with Deputy Minister Andrzej Szejna. According to the deputy minister, Ambassador Livne apologized for the incident.\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Foreign Minister Penny Wong spoke with their equivalents in Israel following the attack. Albanese told Netanyahu that Australians were outraged by the death of an Australian citizen in the attack. Albanese later stated that he regarded Netanyahu's description of the attack as being \"unintentional\" and \"something that happens in war\" as unsatisfactory.  On 5 April the Australian Government stated that the Israeli government \"hasn't yet satisfied\" its expectations for an investigation, and that it would appoint a special adviser with responsibility for ensuring that the investigation meets Australia's expectations. The Australian Government has also stated that all evidence relating to the attack must be preserved. On 6 April Wong stated that she and Minister for Defence Richard Marles had written to their Israeli equivalents calling for further action to be taken against the individuals responsible for the attack.\n\n\n== Reactions ==\n\n\n=== World Central Kitchen ===\n\nJosé Andrés, the founder of the World Central Kitchen charity, wrote that: \"I am heartbroken and grieving for their families and friends and our whole WCK family. These are people … angels … I served alongside in Ukraine, Gaza, Turkey, Morocco, Bahamas, Indonesia. They are not faceless … they are not nameless.\" He called on Israel to stop \"indiscriminate killing,\" continuing that \"It needs to stop restricting humanitarian aid, stop killing civilians and aid workers, and stop using food as a weapon.\" \nIn a separate statement Andrés said: \"The air strikes on our convoy were not just some unfortunate mistake in the fog of war. It was a direct attack on clearly marked vehicles whose movements were known by the IDF.\" Andrés made another video statement in which he accused the IDF of systematically and deliberately targeting aid workers with the intention of killing every one in the convoy. He demanded a neutral entity above the IDF conduct the investigation.\nWCK chief executive Erin Gore said in a statement: \"This is not only an attack against WCK, this is an attack on humanitarian organizations showing up in the most dire of situations where food is being used as a weapon of war. This is unforgivable.\" Gore continued: \"We — World Central Kitchen and the world — lost beautiful lives today because of a targeted attack by the IDF.\"\n\n\n=== Israel ===\nAn Israeli military source told army radio that the attack was \"the worst Israel has seen in the war.\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the attack as a tragic incident where Israeli forces unintentionally hit innocent people. The IDF said in a statement that it is \"conducting a thorough review at the highest levels to understand the circumstances of this tragic incident.\" The IDF eventually took responsibility and apologized, saying that the Israeli attack was \"a mistake that followed a misidentification, at night\".\n\n\n=== Hamas ===\nHamas condemned the drone strikes in a statement and urged the international community to take action: \"This crime once again confirms that the occupation continues its policy of deliberate killing of innocent civilians, international relief teams, and humanitarian organizations, in its efforts to terrorize those working in them and prevent them from carrying out their humanitarian duties.\"\n\nCountries, officials and organizations that denounced the attack include: the European Commission, Iran, Jordan, the United Nations's emergency relief chief Martin Griffiths, Norwegian Refugee Council, Open Arms, who were delivering food with WCK, Scotland, WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and World Food Programme Chief Cindy McCain.\n\n\n=== International ===\n Australia − Prime Minister Anthony Albanese described the death of Australian national Zomi Frankcom as \"completely unacceptable\", and that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) had requested an explanation from the Israeli ambassador. DFAT stated that it was seeking from the Israeli government \"a thorough and expeditious review\".\n Belgium − Foreign Minister Hadja Lahbib stated that \"Aid workers do essential work and must be protected, just like civilians,\" also adding that \"too many of them are victims of the conflict in Gaza\".\n Brazil − In a press release, Brazil's Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed its' deep dismay by the attack, while also deploring \"the deaths of Palestinian civilians and health workers and the damage caused by military action in recent weeks,\" specifically mentioning the destruction of Al-Shifa Hospital. The ministry also called for compliance with the UN Security Council resolution adopted on 25 March calling for a ceasefire in the conflict, and recalled \"the binding nature of provisional measures\" indicated by an order by the International Court of Justice on 26 January, calling on Israel to take steps to prevent genocide in the conflict.\n Canada − Foreign minister Mélanie Joly called for a full investigation into the attack.\n China − China said it was \"shocked\" and denounced the Israeli attack; Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin stated that \"China opposes all acts that harm civilians, damage civilian facilities, and violate international law,\"\n Colombia − In a press release, Colombia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed solidarity with the victims' families and the WCK, while urging Israel to \"guarantee the protection of NGO:s present\" in the Gaza Strip, as well as to follow international humanitarian law. The ministry also called for an \"exhaustive and independent\" investigation into the aerial attack, and reiterated the importance of guaranteeing access to humanitarian aid in the Gaza Strip.\n Cyprus − Cyprus' Ministry of Foreign Affairs called for a \"swift and conclusive\" investigation and said that international and humanitarian law is \"absolute,\" adding that \"[h]umanitarian aid workers must always be respected and protected.\"\n Egypt − The Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the killings were \"blatant\" violations of international law and called for a full investigation into the attack.\n France – Speaking at a press conference following talks with his US counterpart Antony Blinken in Paris, French Foreign Minister Stéphane Séjourné \"strongly condemned\" the Israeli airstrike, adding: \"The protection of humanitarian personnel is a moral and legal imperative that everyone must adhere to.\"\n Germany – German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock called for a swift investigation by the Israeli government into the attack, which she described as a \"terrible incident.\" She also expressed her sympathies to the victims' families.\n Ireland − Foreign and Defense Minister Micheál Martin said that he was \"[a]ppalled by the deaths of humanitarian workers in an Israeli strike, killed providing life-saving aid to the people of Gaza.\"\n Mexico − During a press conference, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador expressed his condolences to friends and families of the victims of the attack, while recalling the humanitarian work done by the WCK in Mexico during Hurricane Otis. López Obrador also joined calls for a ceasefire in what he referred to as \"this inhuman war.\"\n Poland − President Andrzej Duda expressed his feelings of deep sorrow over the death of the volunteers, and also stated that \"this tragedy should never have happened and must be investigated.\" Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski expressed condolences for the Polish citizen's death, and said that he personally asked for \"urgent explanations\" from Israel's ambassador to Poland. The Israeli ambassador was summoned to the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs for a series of controversial responses against the accusations of the drone strikes. (See #Diplomatic fallout section.) The Polish side demanded the ambassador to participate in the Przemyśl district prosecutor's office for the investigation, full access to information, and the payment of compensation to Soból's family. Poland also called for respect for the March 25 UN Security Council resolution, which calls for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and for humanitarian convoys to Gaza not to be blocked.\n Qatar − Qatar's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement that it \"strongly condemns\" the attack and considers it as a \"shocking crime, in violation of international and humanitarian laws.\"\n Spain − Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said he was \"expecting and demanding an explanation from the Israeli government\" for the deaths of the seven aid workers. Prior to that, he tweeted he was \"horrified\" by the attacks. After the explanations given by the IDF and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Sánchez deemed them \"completely unacceptable and insufficient.\"\n United Arab Emirates − The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the United Arab Emirates condemned the deaths of the seven people, held Israel responsible and called for an investigation into the attack. The UAE also paused their aid to Gaza after the attack.\n United Kingdom − Foreign Secretary David Cameron called on Israel to provide a transparent explanation for the attack, while Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he was \"shocked and saddened\" by the killing of at least one British volunteer during the attack. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office summoned the Israeli ambassador.\n Scotland − First Minister Humza Yousaf called for an immediate end to arms sales from the UK to Israel, saying: \"The civilian death toll is intolerable, as is the killing of humanitarian workers who deliver vital aid to Palestinians facing starvation and violence at the hands of this Israeli government. By not stopping arms sales to Israel, the UK is in danger of being complicit in the killing of innocent civilians.\"\n United States − President Joe Biden condemned the attack, saying that he was \"outraged and heartbroken\", criticizing Israel for having \"not done enough to protect aid workers trying to deliver desperately needed help to civilians\", while stating that the \"United States has repeatedly urged Israel to deconflict their military operations against Hamas with humanitarian operations, in order to avoid civilian casualties\".\n Vatican City − Pope Francis condemned the attack by Israel and called for peace in Gaza and Ukraine.\n\n\n=== Supranational ===\n European Union − EU Foreign Policy Chief Josep Borrell said: \"I condemn the attack and urge an investigation. Despite all the demands to protect civilians and humanitarian workers, we see new innocent casualties.\" He continued: \"This shows that the [UN Security Council] resolution asking for an immediate ceasefire, full humanitarian access and a reinforced protection of civilians must be immediately implemented.\" Janez Lenarčič, the European Commissioner for Crisis Management, tweeted: \"I condemn yet another deadly attack on humanitarian workers in #Gaza. This must stop. Now. #ceasefire\"\n NATO − During a press conference held in Brussels, NATO General Secretary Jens Stoltenberg stated: \"What we see now in Gaza now is a humanitarian catastrophe. We see suffering, we see that civilians are killed, and we also saw the strike against aid workers and I condemn the strike.\" Stoltenberg also said he was grateful for Israel taking steps to investigate what happened.\n United Nations − Secretary-General António Guterres described the Israeli airstrikes as \"unconscionable,\" while highlighting the number of aid workers killed in the ongoing conflict. He also reiterated that the UN Security Council resolution passed on 25 March calling for a ceasefire \"must be implemented without delay.\" UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths said he was \"outraged\" by the attack, calling the actions of those responsible \"indefensible.\"\n\n\n=== Others ===\nIslamic Relief − The humanitarian group condemned the attack and said that it is \"outraged by yet another deadly attack on humanitarian workers.\"\nNorwegian Refugee Council − Secretary-General Jan Egeland shared his condolences over the killings, stating that \"[n]owhere else are so many aid workers killed.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nGaza Strip famine\nGaza humanitarian crisis (2023–present)\nHumanitarian aid during the Israel–Hamas war\nKilling of health workers in the Israel–Hamas war\nAttacks on health facilities during the Israel–Hamas war\nAttacks on humanitarian workers\nFlour massacre\nIsraeli war crimes\n\n\n== Notes ==\nGeolocations\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The fourth series of Race Across the World began airing on 10 April 2024. Each two-person team was required to complete the 15,000 kilometres (9,300 mi) route from Japan to Indonesia without using air travel, and was given a budget equal to the cost of the air fare. Contestants were provided with only a map, travel guide and GPS tracker.\nOn 27 March 2024, the BBC announced that the fourth series of Race Across the World would begin airing on 10 April. The five pairs of competitors are Brydie and Sharon, Alfie and Owen, Stephen and Viv, Eugenie and Isabel and Betty and James.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe fourth series of Race Across the World is a race over 15,000 kilometres (9,300 mi) that takes place entirely in Eastern Asia, commencing in Sapporo on the island of Hokkaido in Japan and finishing on the island of Lombok in the Indonesian archipelago of Lesser Sunda.\nThe race had seven checkpoints with enforced rest periods, with contestants only finding out the next destination on departure from a checkpoint. The first team to arrive at the final checkpoint wins £20,000.\nTeams were given a budget of £1,390 per person – the equivalent air fare for travelling the race route. Contestants were not permitted to subsidise their budgets, but short-term opportunities allowed them to work for money or bed and board. Contestants were not given access to telephones or internet.\n\n\n== Contestants ==\n\n\n== Results summary ==\nColour key:\n\n  – Team withdrawn\n  – Team eliminated\n  – Series winners\n\n\n== Route ==\nThe checkpoints in the fourth series were:\n\n\n== Race summary ==\n\n\n=== Leg 1: Sapporo, Japan → Nara, Japan ===\n\nHaving checked in at the Gokoku shrine the race started in earnest at 2 pm from Odori Park in the city of Sapporo on the northernmost Japanese island of Hokkaido, with the first leg finishing 1,600 kilometres (990 mi) south in the old imperial capital, Nara, on the main island of Honshu.\nIn an added twist to the usual rules, the teams were not permitted to use any Shinkansen (bullet) trains whilst in Japan.\nThree teams took a train to the nearby port of Tomakomai. Eugenie & Isabel managed to catch an overnight ferry across the Tsugaru Strait to Sendai, whilst both Brydie & Sharon and Betty & James took the last ferry of the night to Hachinohe. The next day, Brydie & Sharon headed towards Tōnō en route to Tokyo, while Betty & James caught a train to Sendai, on the east coast of Honshu. Already in Sendai, Eugenie & Isabel decided to avoid Tokyo, the only team to do so, fearing the capital to be very expensive, and so took a bus to Niigata on the west coast. Betty & James took an excursion to Matsushima Bay before heading to Tokyo to work cleaning rickshaws. \nAlfie & Owen were the first pair to reach the capital having arrived by bus where they witnessed a baby crying contest at the Naki Sumo festival before continuing to Mount Fuji by bus. There, on day 4, they undertook work cleaning at the campsite they had pitched their tents at. Having lost their map and stranded in the countryside, the pair backtracked to Tokyo before heading to Kyoto the next morning by bus.\nMeanwhile Stephen & Viv visited an Onsen in Aomori before heading to Tokyo and onward to a job harvesting wasabi at a farm in Hotaka in exchange for bed and board. One of the farmers then dropped the pair at Matsumoto station where the pair caught a train to Kashihara, just south of Nara. In Tokyo, Brydie & Sharon took a train to Toba to wait on tables at a restaurant run by the local Ama women, whilst Betty & James proceeded directly to Osaka. \nEugenie & Isabel took a ferry to the small island of Sado in the Sea of Japan to visit the Myosenji Buddhist temple. Once back on Honshu they caught a bus to Kanazawa and then a train to Nara. Once the teams had arrived in Nara, they had to find their way to the Gango-ji temple before receiving instructions to the checkpoint which was at the Nara hotel. Finding themselves in a foot race with Alfie & Owen, Eugenie & Isabel beat them by a matter of minutes.\n\n\n=== Leg 2: Nara, Japan → Sokcho, South Korea ===\n\nThe race restarted on day 7 to Sokcho in South Korea, a country which could only be reached by taking a ferry across the Korea Strait, from Hakata on the Japanese island of Kyushu to the port city of Busan. \nBetty & James were the only team to cross onto the island of Shikoku (via the Great Naruto Bridge), where they helped trim some Japanese Acers to be used as garnish on Japanese food. They then caught a bus onward to Tokushima station where they just missed the only train of the day to Okayama delaying them for twenty-four hours. Brydie & Sharon had gone directly to Okayama to work aboard a fishing boat on the Seto Inland Sea but were also stranded for a day due to the lack of trains.  \nAlfie & Owen made their way to Kobe where the latter wanted to sample the famous Kobe beef despite Alfie’s concerns about the impact it would have on their budget. Much to Alfie’s relief and joy, the proprietor of the restaurant comped the meal. Afterwards the pair checked into a capsule hotel for the night. The next day they were repeatedly advised by the locals that reservations onward to Hakata should be made online. Stymied without internet access, a good samaritan eventually made the reservations on their behalf. \nStephen & Viv headed to northern Kansai in search of work repairing a thatched roof in exchange for bed and board. However, poor weather meant they were unable to repay their hosts hospitality due to safety concerns, so they insisted on cleaning the shrine instead. Afterwards the pair backtracked to Osaka and caught an overnight bus to Hiroshima. Already in Hiroshima, in search of a job opportunity as they had depleted almost a third of their entire race budget, were Eugenie & Isabel. There they paid their respects at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park after which they did a one hour shift in an Okonomiyaki restaurant, but instead of cooking, the duo found themselves washing dishes to due their late arrival.\nOn day 8, Alfie & Owen found themselves on the same ferry crossing as Eugenie & Isabel. On their arrival at the Hakata ferry port, Stephen & Viv were disappointed to learn that they had missed the only two daily crossings and would now have to wait until the next day, when they were caught up by both Brydie & Sharon and Betty & James. \nOn arrival in South Korea, Alfie & Owen immediately commenced traversing up the Korean peninsula by buses hugging the eastern seaboard, whereas Eugenie & Isabel replenished funds by working at the Jagalchi Fish Market alongside the Ajummas (old lady vendors). When the other three teams finally made it to Busan, Betty & James caught the last bus to Seoul but Brydie & Sharon opted to spend a night in the city before making their way to Daejeon the next day to work collecting chestnuts. Stephen & Viv meanwhile headed across the peninsula to Jeonju Hanok Village to work a shift dishwashing at a restaurant that specialised in Bibimbap. \nOn day 11 Eugenie & Isabel finally headed to Sokcho on a direct bus service, whilst Alfie & Owen were killing time by visiting Haesindang Park in Samcheok. In Sokcho the teams were advised to take a taxi to the Seokbong Ceramics Museum of Art. From there it was onto the Cheongchojeong and finally to the checkpoint. Alfie & Owen opted to walk in a bid to conserve funds and found themselves finishing four hours behind Eugenie & Isabel. When the other three teams finally arrived the overall positions had not changed, however the time differential between first and last place had grown massively. \n\n\n=== Leg 3: Hanoi, Vietnam → Phnom Penh, Cambodia ===\n\nThe race continued from Hanoi in Vietnam with the third leg finishing in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRace Across the World (series 4) at BBC Online",

He competes part-time in the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series, driving the No. 20 Chevrolet for Young's Motorsports. He also competes in the eNASCAR Coca-Cola iRacing Series, and won the 2023 championship in the Contender Series.\n\n\n== Racing career ==\nIn 2011, Salas started his racing career by racing karts at local tracks in California. By the time he was 15, he had moved up to shifter karts and started competing at a national level. His career was temporarily halted by the COVID-19 lockdown, where he switched over to the eNASCAR Coca-Cola iRacing Series, and saw some success with a dominating win in the 2021 race at Richmond Raceway, where he led every single lap of the race.\nSalas began competing in late model racing in 2022 in the CARS Tour, which was his first time racing a real-life car. A fourth-place finish in his first race convinced team owner Justin Carroll to give him a full-time ride in the series for the 2023 season. On March 18, 2024, it was announced that he would make his NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series debut in the race at Circuit of the Americas driving the No. 20 truck for Young's Motorsports. He started 31st, but his day ended early with his truck having transmission issues and he finished 34th.\n\n\n== Motorsports career results ==\n\n\n=== NASCAR ===\n(key) (Bold – Pole position awarded by qualifying time.

The game uses a 3D technology in reproducing what it's like to fish real lakes in competition.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nAaron Curtiss from the Los Angeles Times said \"Not my cup of tea, but I can see how die-hard fishermen might enjoy having it loaded on their PC at work for a few casts during conference calls.\"\nRoy Bassave from the The Miami Herald said \"Bass Masters Classic's best feature is the Force-Feedback support that allows anglers to feel a jerk on the joystick when a fish bites.

        "content": "The Furutsuki Cave Tomb Cluster (古月横穴, Furutsuki yokoana) is an archaeological site containing a Kofun period Corridor-type kofun (横穴式石室, yokoana-shiki sekishitsu)  located in the town of Kurate, Fukuoka, Kurate District, Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. It was granted protection as a National Historic Site in 1932, with the area under protection expanded in 1986.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Furutsuki Cave Tomb Cluster is a group of horizontal cave tombs located on the slope of a hill on the west bank of the Nishi River, which flows into the Onga River. Discovered in 1926, tombs were designated as a National Historic Site in 1932, and subsequent archaeological excavations confirmed a total 41 tombs on three slopes, east, west, and south slopes of the hill, including the original 13.  The cave-shaped tombs are carved into the hard rock of a hill, and are thought to have been built over a period of about 100 years from the late 6th century to the late 7th century as the tombs for an important local clan. The Furutsuki site is unusual among horizontal tombs, in that it has decorative patterns on the walls inside the tombs; Tomb No. 9 has a pattern of diagonal and horizontal lines is drawn in red, and No. 9 has a diagonal lattice pattern painted in vermilion. It can be assumed that there were trends in construction methods depending on the era, such as the entrance to the side cave having an eave stone, and the size of the tomb chambers varying in size. Grave goods such as Haji ware, Sue ware, iron swords, horse harnesses, and earrings were unearthed from almost all of the graves. The site has now been maintained as a public park, and relics are displayed and preserved at the Kurate Town History and Folklore Museum. \nThe site is approximately 4.3 kilometers west of Kurate Station on the JR Kyushu Chikuhō Main Line.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Fukuoka)\nDecorated kofun\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKurate town home page (in Japanese)\nFukuoka Tourism Web (in Japanese)\nCultural Properties of Fukuoka Prefecture (in Japanese)",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Kgari Kealeboga Sechele II (1904–19 September 1962) was a kgosi of the Kwena tribe in the Bechuanaland Protectorate (modern day Botswana) from 1931 until his death in 1962. He was appointed to the position by the British colonial administration after it deposed his elder brother Sebele II, and his rule was contested by the tribe. He was succeeded by his younger brother Neale Sechele.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nKgari Kealeboga Sechele was born in 1904. As a child, Kgari was taken under the guardianship of his uncle Moitelasilo who had taught him about tribal politics at the kgotla. Kgari was seen fondly by the British colonial administration, and they considered him a better candidate than his brothers to be kgosi. Assistant Resident Commissioner A. G. Stigand acquired a bursary for Kgari in 1929, and Kgari went to South Africa to study at St. Mathews College.\n\n\n== Kgosi of the Bakwena ==\n\n\n=== Appointment ===\nIn 1931, while Kgari was in South Africa, the colonial administration deposed his brother Sebele II as kgosi of the Bakwena. Kgari's older brother Mosarwa was not interested in becoming kgosi, and the administration considered him too irresponsible to rule, so Kgari was chosen by the administration to be the next kgosi. He was installed in June 1931. The administration crafted a public narrative that he was chosen by the populace. During the ceremony anointing him kgosi, the audience stood. This may have been in acceptance or in dissent of Kgari's rule; the administration insisted that it was a positive gesture. There was also an incident in which a village elder, Kgosimang, demanded the return to Sebele II to cheers from the crowd, despite a rule against mentioning Sebele. The appointment saw protest from the Bakwena and from other Tswana dikgosi. \nThe administration decided that Kgari should be kgosi instead of merely a regent or an acting ruler, even though he was not the next in line. A ceremony was held to name him kgosi on 1 September 1931. During the ceremony, his uncles draped a leopard skin upon his shoulders—an honour typically reserved only for the heir—which offended the village and increased backlash against his rule.\n\n\n=== Reign ===\nThroughout the 1930s, the Bakwena held no allegiance to Kgari, and his orders were often disregarded. His refusal to address Sebele's exile solidified the opposition against him. As he did not have popular support, Kgari became a strict ruler to consolidate his power. He appointed his supporters as advisors after becoming kgosi, but they reduced in number over the following years until Kgari ruled unilaterally. Teachers, religious figures, local leaders, and anyone else who opposed him lost their positions and were sometimes fined or jailed. To increase Kgari's authority over the tribe, Charles Rey, the resident commissioner, used funds from the Bakwena Tribal Fund to build a home for Kgari between the two Kwena factions around Molepolole: the faction in Ntsweng and the faction in Borakalalo. He hoped it would cause them to merge around Kgari, but it only left Kgari isolated from both factions.\nOn 6 March 1933, the people of Molepolole submitted the Great Petition to protest the administration's appointment of Kgari, which was signed by almost every family head, totalling over 1,400 signatures. This was an unprecedented rebuttal, with petitions against Sebele II never going above 25 signatures.\nWhen Kgari moved the Bakwena capital from Ntsweng in the late 1930s, he called upon the colonial police to move the Kwena people by force. Kgari was loyal to the administration, as he was dependent on it to stay in power. Resident Commissioner Rey felt that Kgari's frequent requests for the administration to solve problems further weakened him in the eyes of the people. Kgari also faced accusations of sexual misconduct, including the rape of Angelina Mmopi in 1936 and the seduction of Eurice Kraai in 1940. When Sebele II offered to formally abdicate in exchange for an end to his exile in 1938, Kgari refused, fearing what Sebele's presence would do to his authority.\nKgari became more popular at the end of the 1930s, especially after the death of Sebele II in 1939, which ended the most serious challenge to Kgari's legitimacy. He gained further approval in 1941 when he joined the African Auxiliary Pioneer Corps to fight in World War II, fulfilling a tradition of the kgosi going to war to prove his strength. Stories circulated about his performance in combat, and he became a war hero among the Tswana peoples. One such story tells that an enemy squad bombarded a tent he was sleeping in, only for him to walk away unscathed. Kgari attempted to have his headmen call him home to demonstrate that his rule was essential for the tribe, but this did not occur and he served in the war until 1945. Even though opposition against his rule was reduced, he continued to rule through authoritarianism. Kgari attended the coronation of Elizabeth II in 1952, where he represented the Bechuanaland Protectorate. He engaged in a rare dispute with the colonial administration the same year as he sheltered refugees from South Africa.\nKgari oversaw construction of several major buildings throughout his reign, including a church hospital in 1931, the Bakwena National School in 1938, a council chamber in 1945, and a secondary school in 1959. He also saw to the renovation of the London Missionary Society church in 1957. Conversely, had the village in Ntsweng almost entirely destroyed, leaving only the Bakwena National Office building standing.\n\n\n== Death and succession ==\nIn 1949, Kgari indicated that he may retire, suggesting that he be succeeded by his nephew Bonewamang Padi Sechele, but the tribe insisted that he should not. He floated retirement and succession to Bonewamang a second time in 1954 when he was having marital problems. He considered retirement more seriously in 1962 as formal political parties began to develop within the Bechuanaland Protectorate. He travelled to Swaziland, where he was said to be purchasing a farm. It was here that Kgari died suddenly on 19 September 1962.\nThroughout Kgari's life, he speculated that he would be the last kgosi of the Bakwena. His death triggered a succession crisis, as he had no children. Claims were made by two members of the family: Moruakgomo, who was Sebele II's son, and Bonewamang, who was the son of Sebele II and Kgari's older brother Padi. Kenalekgosi served as acting kgosi while the dispute was resolved. The court determined that Kgari's younger brother Neale Sechle would become kgosi despite not being in the immediate line of succession, and he was installed in 1963.\n\n\n== Explanatory notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Works cited ==\nMbuya, Titus (1999). \"Legitimacy and Succession in Tswana States: The Case of BaKwena, 1930-1963\".

The election was held on a nonpartisan basis.\nIncumbent Commissioner Brad Avakian was re-elected unopposed in the May primary. Because he received over 50% of the vote, the general election scheduled for November was not held.\n\n\n== Primary election ==\nA nonpartisan primary election was held alongside partisan primary elections on May 20, 2014. Conservative Christian groups, unhappy over Avakian's enforcement action against a bakery that refused to bake a cake for a lesbian couple's wedding, attempted to recruit a challenger, but were unsuccessful. Avakian was unopposed in the election and essentially declared victory on the filing deadline.\n\n\n=== Candidates ===\nBrad Avakian, incumbent Labor Commissioner\nWhile the position of Labor Commissioner is nonpartisan, Avakian is a Democrat.\n\n\n=== Results ===\n\n\n== See also ==\n2014 Oregon gubernatorial election\n2014 Oregon state elections\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Acrotriche serrulata, commonly known as honey pots, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae, and is endemic to south-eastern Australia. It is a low-lying, mat-forming shrub with lance-shaped to linear leaves, pale green to whitish, cylindrical flowers and greyish-green fruit.\n\n\n== Description ==\nAcrotriche serrulata is a low-lying, matt-forming shrub that typically spreads to about 1 m (3 ft 3 in) wide, with ascending branches up to 15–60 cm (5.9–23.6 in) high. The leaves are lance-shaped to linear, 3.5–13.0 mm (0.14–0.51 in) long and 0.5–2.0 mm (0.020–0.079 in) wide on a petiole 0.3–0.7 mm (0.012–0.028 in) long with finely toothed edges and shallow groovs on the lower surface. The flowers are borne in spikes of 5 to 10 with bracteoles 1.0–1.5 mm (0.039–0.059 in) long at the base. The sepals are 1.4–2.8 mm (0.055–0.110 in) long and the petal are pale green or whitish and joined at the base, forming tube 4.0–4.7 mm (0.16–0.19 in) long with lobes 1.5–2.0 mm (0.059–0.079 in) long. Flowering occurs from August to September and the fruit is a flattened spherical capsule 2.5–4.5 mm (0.098–0.177 in) long and greyish-green.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nAcrotriche serrulata was first formally described in 1810 by Robert Brown  in his Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. The specific epithet (serrulata) means \"like a small saw\".\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nHoney pots is widely distributed in New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, Victoria and Tasmania, where it grows in woodland, forest, coastal heath and mallee shrubland.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Roula Pispirigou (Greek: Ρούλα Πισπιρίγκου; born 1988 or 1989) is a Greek convicted murderer and suspected serial killer. Accused of killing her three daughters in Patras, she was arrested and remanded in custody for the premeditated murder of her eldest one Georgina Daskalaki, after administering ketamine. The murder case has also attracted international attention.\nIn March 2024, Pispirigou was sentenced to life imprisonment by a jury in Athens, who unanimously found her guilty of murdering her first-born daughter, Georgina.\n\n\n== Murders ==\nOn 13 April 2019, 3.5-year-old Malena Daskalaki died at the Children's Hospital while she was admitted with leukemia at an early stage and with the doctors considering the condition completely curable. A few days later, her sister, Georgina Daskalaki, was admitted for the first time. On 21 March 2021, their sister Irida Daskalaki was found dead in her crib with a bloody cloth on top of her. In July 2021, the forensic report was completed and sent by medical examiner Angeliki Tsiola. A genetic test followed, which was completed on 30 March 2022, with a negative result for the existence of a genetic problem.\nOn 11 April 2021, Georgina Daskalaki was admitted to Karamandanio Hospital in Patras. She underwent CPR for over 50 minutes and recovered; however she had suffered hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. On 29 January 2022, the quadriplegic Georgina died in the hospital in Rio. On 9 February, the Patras prosecutor's office ordered a preliminary investigation into the three girls. On 30 March, an arrest warrant was issued for Pispirigou, who apologized to an investigator in Athens on 4 April. With the concurrence of the investigator and the prosecutor, she was remanded in custody and taken to Korydallos Prison.\n\n\n== Conviction ==\nIn July 2022, Pispirigou was charged with serial murder of all three of her children. She pleaded not guilty, while her lawyer, Alexis Kougias, claimed that \"it is the biggest judicial scandal since I have been a lawyer\". Pispirigou's innocence was defended by her mother, her sister and stepfather.\nFinally, on 29 March 2024, Pispirigou was sentenced to life imprisonment by a mixed jury in Athens, which unanimously found her guilty of murdering her first-born daughter, Georgina. The court adopted the prosecutor's proposal to impose a life sentence.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Heidemarie Schmidt is a professor at the Leibniz Institute of Photonic Technology. Her research considers quantum detection and the development of new detector systems that can characterise systems at the quantum limit. She has contributed to the field of neuromorphic computing, and proposed new computing architectures based on memristive devices.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nSchmidt was born in Germany. She studied physics at the Technical University Leipzig, where she developed strategies to measure the bandwidths of ultrathin III-V semiconductors. She remained in Leipzig for her postdoc, where she worked on spintronics using ZnO.\n\n\n== Research and career ==\nIn 2003 Schmidt established a research group on nano-spintronics at Leipzig University. She moved to the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf in 2007, where she spent five years. In 2012 the German Research Foundation awarded Schmidt a Fraunhoffer Attract fellowship, which she held at the Chemnitz University of Technology. Here she started working on memresistive devices for edge analytics and secure electronics. She demonstrated an anlogue memristor based on BiFeO3 and a digital memristor based on YMnO3.\nShe joined the Leibniz Institute of Photonic Technology in 2017. Schmidt develops new detectors for understanding quantum phenomena. She works on both cooled and uncooled spatial and temporal sensors that can detect in the Terahertz and Infrared region. To achieve this sensing, Schmidt uses micro- and nanotechnologies.  She has developed memristors for use in cryogenic environments, such as those found in quantum technologies, and for space missions. Her memristors are modelled on neural circuitry, and can certifiably (transparently, repeatably and honestly) perform calculations – and store the results. In 2023 she founded MemLog, which provides new electronic components for neuromorphic computing architecture.\n\n\n== Select publications ==\nQingyu Xu; Heidemarie Schmidt; Shengqiang Zhou; et al.

        "content": "The 1846 New Hampshire gubernatorial election was held on 10 March 1846 in order to elect the Governor of New Hampshire. Whig nominee Anthony Colby defeated Democratic nominee and former member of the U.S. House of Representatives from New Hampshire's At-large district (Seat 3) Jared W. Williams and Free Soil Party nominee and former member of the New Hampshire Senate Nathaniel S. Berry. Since no candidate received a majority in the popular vote, Colby was elected by the New Hampshire General Court per the state constitution, despite placing second in the popular vote.\n\n\n== General election ==\nOn election day, 10 March 1846, Democratic nominee Jared W. Williams won the popular vote by a margin of 9,003 votes against his foremost opponent Whig nominee Anthony Colby. But because no candidate received a majority of the popular vote, a separate election was held by the New Hampshire General Court, which chose Whig nominee Anthony Colby as the winner, despite Colby having only received 31.99% of the vote and having placed second. Colby thereby gained Whig control over the office of Governor, he was sworn in as the 20th Governor of New Hampshire on 4 June 1846.\n\n\n=== Results ===\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "John Robert O'Toole is an Australian teacher, academic and author.\nO'Toole is most known for his works on drama education and applied theatre, all with an emphasis on collaborative learning, curriculum development, culture, politics, and education. His most influential publication is his 1992 book The Process of Drama. Among other notable works are his publications in academic journals, including Teaching Education as well as books such as Educational Research: Creative Thinking and Doing and plays titled The Beekeeper's Boy and Twilight Valley Blues. Moreover, he is the recipient of the 2001 Judith Kase-Cooper Honorary Research Award from the American Alliance for Theater and Education.\n\n\n== Education ==\nO'Toole earned his B.A. in English from Cambridge University in 1962, followed by an M.A. from the same university in 1965. He received an Advanced Diploma in Drama Education from Durham University in 1971, and an MEd from the University of Newcastle upon Tyne in 1977. Later, he obtained a PHD from the University of Queensland in 1991.\n\n\n== Career ==\nO'Toole commenced his academic journey teaching English at state schools across England from 1963-1975. Following this, he moved to Australia as lecturer in drama at N. Brisbane College of Advanced Education from 1976 to 1979, where he was also co-founder of the Queensland and National Associations for Drama in Education (now Drama Queensland and Drama Australia). Between 1981 and 1985, he served as a lecturer in drama at Brisbane CAE, and from 1985 to 1991 as Head of Primary Expressive Arts. Following the amalgamation of Brisbane CAE and Griffith University in 1991, he held the position of associate professor in drama at Griffith University, subsequently becoming a professor of drama and applied theatre at the same institution from 2002 to 2005. In 2005 he became the foundation chair of arts education at the University of Melbourne, a post he held until 2010. Since 2010, he has held the title of honorary professorial fellow at the University of Melbourne, and from 2012-2019 the title of honorary, then adjunct professor at Griffith University.\nIn 1971, O'Toole co-founded Durham Theatre in Education and worked there until 1975. He co-produced and wrote the inaugural theatre in education program for Peter O'Connor's New Zealand Everyday Theatre (2006), titled replay@timeout. In 1980 he was Education Officer at Tynewear Theatre, Newcastle, during a year back in the UK. In 2004-5 he founded and wrote the initial programs for Griffith University Flying Drama School theatre in education company. He was a founder-member of IDEA, the International Association for Drama and Education, in 1992, and co-convened the 1995 IDEA World Congress of Drama/Theatre and Education in Brisbane, then assumed the role of director of publications for IDEA from 1996 to 2004. His most substantial educational contribution was from 2009-2013, as Lead Writer for the Arts and for Drama in the Australian National Curriculum. Later, he chaired the board of the Queensland Flying Arts Alliance from 2015 to 2020.\n\n\n== Works ==\nO'Toole has authored publications including school textbooks, research works, plays and articles throughout his career. In 1977, after a year's fellowship at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, he published the book Theatre in Education: New Objectives for Theatre, New Techniques in Education. This book is an examination of a growing sector within education, offering an exploration of theatre in education, its origins, and its evolution alongside shifts in both theatrical practices and educational methodologies. Later in 1987, he collaborated with Brad Haseman in Dramawise: An Introduction to the Elements of Drama, (now revised by the authors in 2017 as Dramawise Reimagined). The book is a guide for teaching drama in middle secondary school. It is directly addressed to students, emphasizing the creation of fictional worlds through application of the basic elements of drama by role-plays and improvisations, and also providing examples from well-known playscripts to develop themes and prepare for performances. His theoretical and philosophical underpinning of Dramawise became a book as The Process of Drama, published in 1992. In 1996, he co-edited Drama, Culture and Empowerment with Kate Donelan, wherein he argued for valuing global diversity in drama and education, highlighting that while practitioners face common challenges, culturally distinct approaches are valid and enriching in their specific contexts. The book was reviewed by Joe Winston, who said \"The book embodies a philosophy which embraces this cultural diversity, encouraging us to recognise that what is happening in our field elsewhere may be different from what we as individuals do but is nonetheless right for that elsewhere. It becomes a platform for our global community of drama educators to share one another's elsewhere, to celebrate what unites us and to understand what makes each of us particular.\"\nO'Toole's role in the 1997–2006 international DRACON research study focused on conflict resolution in schools, arguing that drama can effectively give students the skills to manage conflict situations, by letting them explore, explain, replay, and rework conflicts in safe settings. As a major outcome of this research, he co-authored a book with Bruce Burton titled Cooling Conflicts in 2005, wherein they outlined an approach for managing conflict and bullying in schools by combining theoretical insights with practical drama-based strategies and large-scale peer-teaching, to empower students and foster a positive school environment.\nIn 2009, O'Toole led the writing of a study of the history and development of Australian drama in schools: Drama and Curriculum: The giant at the door; and also co-wrote (with Neryl Jeanneret and Chris Sinclair, and other colleagues) a teacher's handbook for teaching the arts in schools: Education in the Arts: teaching and learning in the contemporary curriculum. In the same year, he published a paper wherein he critically examined the development, production, and implementation of Everyday Theatre's replay@timeout program within the context of theatre in education, process drama, and applied theatre. The study detailed its aesthetic, pedagogical, and logistical decisions, as well as its strengths, weaknesses, and the negotiation process involved in realizing its essential principles.\nO'Toole's 2010 collaborative book with David Beckett Educational Research: Creative Thinking and Doing is a guide to research for teachers and teacher education students. It covers basic principles, theoretical approaches, and practical processes of conducting research in educational contexts, including the concept of creativity as an important aspect of some educational research. The book also covers issues in policy, schools, and classrooms while also highlighting contemporary trends like mixed methodology and collaborative research. His 2011 book titled Performing Research: Tensions, Triumphs and Trade-Offs of Ethnodrama, with Judith Ackroyd, explored the complexities and challenges of using ethnodrama as a method of research engagement and dissemination, providing case studies and critical examination of projects in fields such as education, health, and community studies. His 2019 co-authored book Researching Conflict, Drama and Learning explored how educational drama, as employed in his earlier research project DRACON, contributes to conflict management and transformation among school students and many other age-groups and communities world-wide, detailing its principles, methodologies, successes, challenges, and global influences. In his 2021 retrospective article \"The basic principles of a socially just arts curriculum, and the place of drama\", he provided an analysis of the development of the Australian Curriculum for the Arts, emphasizing its commitment to equity and excellence, and explored how these principles were embodied in the Drama curriculum to foster empathy and inquiry among students. More recently, in 2020, he and Julie Dunn co-wrote Stand Up For Literature, a text-book for teaching English literature through drama. Moreover, in 2022, he co-authored Insights in Applied Theatre: The Early Days and Onwards, an exploration of the development, practices, and key themes in applied theatre, featuring influential articles curated around topics such as power dynamics, partnerships, and giving voice to marginalized communities.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n2000 – Life Member, Drama Queensland\n2001 – Judith Kase-Cooper Honorary Research Award, American Alliance for Theater and Education\n2003 – President's Award, Drama Australia\n2013 – Life Member, National Drama UK\n2014 – Member of the Order of Australia (AM)\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Books ===\nTheatre in Education: New Objectives for Theatre, New Techniques in Education (1976) ISBN 9780340206171\nDramawise: An introduction to the elements of drama (1987) ISBN 0858594110\nThe Process of drama: Negotiating art and meaning.

        "content": "The Kelly Hunters is a 1954 Australian book by Frank Clune about the hunt for bushranger Ned Kelly.The book sold very well.The Sun Herald said \"Indefatigable researcher and skilled storyteller, Clune presents Ned Kelly neither as the persecuted\nhero of one legend nor the bloodthirsty ruffian of another,\nbut as an intelligible and highly intelligent human being.\"The Sydney Morning Herald said \"the main points of the Kelly story have been brought out more clearly than ever before.\"The Advertiser said \"All this is good, robust stuff, bright and bustling history well seasoned with drama and a touch of moralising. Clune, in fact, has made of the Kelly story a picturesque novel grafted with the sombre inevitability of a Greek tragedy. As history, it must have some value, and as an epic yarn it has a great deal.\"The Bulletin called it \"by far the fullest account of the Kellys yet pubished, fascinating if poorly written in its detail, and contains a mass of rough-and-ready research... But it is too obviously and naively partisan to be accepted anywhere as reliable.\"Clune adapted his book into 1962's Ned Kelly's Last Stand and 1981's Frank Clune's Ned Kelly.\n\n\n== References ==",

A historic structure renovated in modern times, it contains the tomb of the last Abbasid Caliph, al-Musta'sim. It was also known as Mashhad al-Wu'ud, before it became a mosque.\n\n\n== History ==\nOriginally, the site was the location of a shrine known as Mashhad al-Wu'ud, built over the grave of Ahmad al-Sabti, who was the son of the Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid and a Sufi mystic. The Abbasid Caliph, al-Musta'sim was killed by the Ilkhanate in the 1258 Siege of Baghdad, his remains were transferred here and reburied. His daughter (or granddaughter) Rabi'ah was also buried here later on, and a shrine was built for her too, hence the name of the mosque was the Abu Rabi'ah Mosque.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nIn 1993, and archaeological excavation was conducted at the mosque. The historian Imad Abd al-Salam Rauf, who was involved in the excavations, was able to find the tombstone of the deceased Caliph. The mosque and the attached tomb were renovated in 2005. It was almost completely rebuilt with modern architecture. A room for the Imam and other necessities were added to the mosque's structure.\n\n\n== Specifications ==\nThe building has an area of 1000 m2 and can accommodate 200 worshippers. Almost no trace of the original mosque remain, having being replaced by a modern structure. A small dome still remains over the tomb of Caliph al-Musta'sim, and all other historic features of the tomb have disappeared.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of mosques in Iraq\nList of mosques in Baghdad\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "New Tretyakov Gallery is the second building of the Tretyakov Gallery, located in Moscow in Krymsky Val in the Museon Park. It was built in 1983 according to the project of architects Yuri Sheverdyaev and Nikolai Sukoyan in Soviet modernism style. The first exhibitions were opened in 1986, the museum presents art trends of XX and XXI centuries: Russian avant-garde, socialist realism, art of the \"austere style\", underground and the newest trends. The museum has a creative workshop for children.\nThe building of the New Tretyakovka will be closed for reconstruction from 2023 to 2027-2028.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Location background ===\nThe first plans to develop the location on the bank of the Moscow River near the Krymsky Bridge appeared in the 1920s. At that time it was planned to create a system of parks with a permanent agricultural exhibition on the territory. The project failed for bureaucratic reasons, and in 1930 the Government of Moscow discussed the possibility of building a Palace of Arts on the site. In 1936, a large scientific center was needed after the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Unionmoved to Moscow. In the same year an architectural competition was held, and the project of Alexey Shchusev won. Construction began in 1939, but due to the outbreak of the Great Patriotic War the work was suspended, and in the post-war years the construction site was moved to Vorobyovy Gory.\nIn the 1950s, the architect Ivan Zholtovsky proposed to build a new House of the Unions on the site. At the same time, the government began to discuss the construction of a new building for the 100th anniversary of the Tretyakov Gallery. The location near the Krymsky Bridge seemed to be the most suitable: in addition to the fact that the area was large enough to accommodate a multifunctional building, the founder of the gallery, Pavel Tretyakov, was born nearby —in Golutvinsky Lane— in 1832. However, due to internal disagreements in the management of the gallery, the project was not realized. In 1959, the city authorities decided to transfer the property to the State Art Gallery of the USSR.\n\n\n=== Building construction ===\nThe building was designed by the Ivan Zholtovsky Architectural Workshop according to the sketches of Yuri Sheverdyaev and Nikolai Sukoyan in the style of early Soviet modernism. The architects decided to give the building the form of a park pavilion oriented to the embankment of the Moskva River. According to the project, the building should be consistent with the ensemble of Neskuchny Garden and Gorky Park and be a large low pavilion with a continuous colonnade around the first floor perimeter. The total area of the exhibition halls was 12,000 square meters. In 1962 it was decided to construct a building for two objects: the State Picture Gallery and the Central House of Artists.\n\nConstruction began in 1965. In 1977, the part of the building that belonged to the Artists' Union was partly finished. Two years later, the Central House of Artists was opened there. The building was completed in 1985.\n\n\n=== Inauguration of the New Tretyakov Gallery ===\nIn 1986, the State Picture Gallery of the USSR was merged with the Tretyakov Gallery to form the All-Union Museum Association, which also included the Museum-Apartment of Appolinariy Vasnetsov, the House-Museum of Viktor Vasnetsov, the Museum-Museum of Anna Golubkina, the House-Museum of Pavel Korin with his studio, the Church of St. Nicholas in Tolmachi, and the Memorial Estate of Pavel Tretyakov.\n\nThe first temporary exhibitions were opened to the public in 1986: \"40 Years of Victory over Fascism\", \"The Youth of the Country\" and \"Stages of the Great Patriotic War\". At the same time the main building of the Tretyakov Gallery in Lavrushinsky Lane was closed for restoration and a part of the works of painting, graphics, sculpture, theater and decorative art of the XX century was transferred to the building on Krymsky Val. After the restoration of the main building was completed in 1996, the works of art of the 20th century were moved to the building in Krymsky Val, where the first permanent exhibition was organized.\n\n\n== Exposition ==\nBy 2018, it had over 5,000 20th and 21st century artworks. One of the largest collections consists of paintings by the Russian avant-garde of the 1900-1920s, represented by the following artists: Kazimir Malevich, Wassily Kandinsky, Marc Chagall, Pavel Filonov, and Lyubov Popova. The works of major painters and sculptors of socialist realism are widely represented in the exposition. In the permanent exposition of halls 15–20, 24 and 25, entitled \"The Art of the Soviet Era. 1920-1950s\", there are the paintings New Moscow (painting) (1937) by Yuri Pimenov, Stalin and Voroshilov in the Kremlin (1938) by Aleksandr Gerasimov, Spring (1954) and Haymaking (1945) by Arkady Plastov. In Halls 26–30, 33, 35 and 36, united in the section \"Art of the Soviet Era. 1950s-1980s\", the work of Dmitry Zhilinsky is well represented, especially the paintings A Family on the Seaside (1964) and Sunday Day (1973).\n\nThe collection of contemporary painting began to take shape in the 1990s thanks to acquisitions by the Ministry of Culture and gifts from artists and their heirs. Thus, in the early 2000s, the collection of the Department of Contemporary Art of the Tsaritsyno Museum-Reserve, assembled by Andrei Yerofeev, was transferred to the Museum.\nIn 2007, the museum management changed the concept of exhibition organization. According to the innovations, the viewing of paintings begins with the art of 1900, and the paintings are arranged thematically — the works of one artist can be presented in several halls at the same time. In the halls were also displayed decorative and applied art objects and photographs acquired by Vera Mukhina.\nIn 2014, the museum received a large collection of contemporary art by Leonid Talochkin, donated to the Tretyakov Gallery by the collector's widow with the support of the Ministry of Culture. In 2016, a new permanent exhibition, \"Contemporary Art: 1960-2000. Reset.\" All works are grouped according to directions and thematic sections: \"Abstraction\", \"Kinetic and Optical Art\", \"Mystics and Surrealists\", \"New Realism\", \"Pop Art\", \"Minimalism and Post-Painterly Abstraction\", \"Sots Art\", \"Conceptualism — Image in the Head\", \"Poetry and Writing\", \"Performance Art\", \"Machines of Understanding\", \"Neo-Expressionism\", \"Conceptualism — New Generation\", \"Archaeology of Postmodernism\", \"Actionism of the 1990s\", and \"Project: Art of the 2000s\". In 2018, the Vinzavod Foundation for the Support of Contemporary Art donated ten works by young artists of the 1990s and 2000s to the museum.\n\nTretyakov Gallery director Zelfira Tregulova said:We missed the great works of that period, and now we won't be able to buy them when they come on the market because they cost a huge amount of money, not comparable to what was paid in the 90s and 2000s, so we don't want to repeat the mistakes of previous generations. We will start to collect contemporary art now.\n\nIn September 2019, the museum opened a hall in honor of the collector George Costakis, who, before his departure abroad, donated more than 800 works to the Tretyakov Gallery — a collection of the Russian avant-garde consisting of 142 paintings and 692 graphic works. Among them are such world-class masterpieces as \"Portrait of Matyushin\" by Kazimir Malevich, \"Shostakovich's Symphony\" by Pavel Filonov, \"Red Square\" by Wassily Kandinsky, \"Pictorial Architectonics. Black, Red, Gray\" by Lyubov Popova, \"Running Landscape\" by Ivan Kliun. The exposition of the nominal hall, which presents more than 50 paintings and graphic works, will be changed mainly for the sake of preservation of graphic works, which cannot be exhibited for more than three months.\n\n\n== Current time ==\n\n\n=== Modernization and reconstruction ===\n\nIn 2008 it became known that the city authorities planned to demolish the building of the Central House of Artists on Krymsky Val and to build in its place a new building of the Tretyakov Gallery — a round exhibition center \"Orange\" designed by Norman Foster, which would also include apartments, offices and shops. The decision of the gallery management caused a great public outcry, so the plans were abandoned.\nA change in the image of the museum was announced by the management of the Tretyakov Gallery in 2015. To avoid being confused with other branches of the Tretyakov Gallery, the building on Krymsky Val, developed by the Zoloto Group, was called \"New Tretyakovka\". The navigation was also changed: the space was divided into letter sectors, following the example of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and a café, lecture hall and souvenir shop were opened. In 2015, the architectural firm Rem Koolhaas undertook the reconstruction of the building. In 2016, after the renovation, a 4,000 m2 courtyard with a fountain and amphitheater was opened for events: educational lectures, music programs, and other events.\nSince 2017, a part of the Central House of Artists, which was vacated by the International Conference of Artists' Unions by the decision of the Supreme Court of Russia, was transferred to the Tretyakov Gallery at the request of Vladimir Medinsky. In October 2018, it became known that early next year the Central House of Artists will move its events to Manezh and Gostiny Dvor, and the building on Krymsky Val will be fully transferred to the New Tretyakovka.\nIn February 2018, the Rem Koolhaas bureau presented a concept for the next renovation, according to which the building will be divided into four sectors: a repository, an education center, an exhibition space, and an assembly hall. According to the architects' plan, the windows on the facades of the building will be enlarged, and the walls framing the atrium from the inside will be dismantled, making the building completely transparent. Instead of the existing enfilade of rooms, a large exhibition area with a view of Gorky Park will be created, and the staircases will be replaced by colored escalators.\nIn August 2019, the museum management announced that the New Tretyakovka building will be completely closed for reconstruction from 2023 to 2027 or 2028. Part of the exposition will be sent to storage, and the other part will be displayed in a new building on the Kadashyovskaya Embankment.\n\n\n=== Some permanent exhibits ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Major exhibitions of the last few years ===\n2016\n\nAn exhibition of paintings by Valentin Serov from state and private collections. The event received widespread media coverage, with long queues outside the New Tretyakovka building causing the museum to work for 15 hours a day, and the Ministry of Emergency Situations organizing field kitchens to keep visitors warm. In total, more than 485,000 people visited the exhibition.\n2017\n\nAn exhibition of paintings by Ivan Aivazovsky, organized for the 200th anniversary of the artist's birth.\nIn honor of the Centenary of the Revolution, an exhibition entitled \"Someone in 1917\" was held, featuring works created mostly in 1917.

It is one of Clune's best known works.\nThe Sydney Morning Herald called it \"one of Mr Clune's best books\" although he felt \"the actual building of the O.T. becomes rather tedious in print and he must have realised it when he got into his book.\"\nThe Daily Telegraph called it \"one of Clune's better books\".\nThe Bulletin said the book was \"so closely fastened to a  piece of our essential folklore that one cannot but welcome it, cannot but recommend it—and cannot but wish it were infinitely better.\"\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1939 it was announced Clune had written a script called Overland Telegraph which he had sold to Cinesound Productions. The story focused on Sir Charles Todd and his team who had to construct the telegraph. It was to be \"Australia's first epic film\". However Cinesound soon stopped feature filmmaking due to the war and no movie resulted. Clune later turned the material into a book.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Joel Ferri is a French Stomatologist, Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeon, academic and author. He is the chairman and head of the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at the Lille Medical School.Ferri is most known for his contributions to stomatology and maxillofacial surgery outcomes, with a special involvement in bone surgery (orthognathic surgery, bone reconstruction, TMJ prosthesis). Among his notable works are his publications in academic journals, including the American Journal of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics and Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery as well as an edited book titled Preprosthetic and Maxillofacial Surgery : Biomaterials, Bone Grafting and Tissue Engineering.\n\n\n== Education ==\nFerri earned his medical degree from Nantes University in 1990. Additionally, he acquired a Specialized Diploma in Stomatology and Maxillofacial Surgery, along with a diploma in Facial and Neck Surgery. Subsequently, in 1996, he successfully completed his Ph.D.\n\n\n== Career ==\nFerri was appointed as a professor in the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at the University of Lille in 1997. From 2004 to 2008, he served as the president of the International Bone Research Association and as the president of the French Society of Stomatology and Maxillofacial Surgery in 2011. In 2022 as a result of his involvement of the head and neck malformations he was admitted as a member of the Undiagnosed Disease Network International (UDNI). He was admitted as a member of the European Society of TMJ Surgeons (ESTMJS) and was appointed president of this society in 2017. Moreover, he has been serving as the chairman and head of the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at the Lille medical school since 1997.\n\n\n== Research ==\nFerri's early research was focused on the bone of the maxillo-facial area. He conducted a retrospective study comparing the advantages and disadvantages of mandibular reconstruction using a fibula free flap versus other techniques. The study found that while the fibula flap offers benefits like bone length and low donor site morbidity, it may not be suitable for large soft tissue defects, with the conclusion that it is satisfactory for defects over 20 cm in size. While investigating the relationship between the fiber-type composition of the masseter muscle and different bite patterns in individuals undergoing surgical correction of malocclusion, his 2005 research revealed significant associations between muscle composition and vertical bite characteristics, particularly in Class III subjects. In the same year, through his research, he presented a surgical protocol utilizing bimaxillary advancement and adjunctive procedures for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in patients affected by facial or mandible retrusion, demonstrating a high success rate in reducing the apnea/hypopnea index and improving patient outcomes.Ferri's 2010 work examined the impact of orthognathic surgery on temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders, finding that while the surgery significantly reduces TMJ symptoms in patients with pre-operative symptoms, there is a risk of new onset of TMJ symptoms post-surgery, albeit with a low occurrence rate. In 2011, he co-edited the book titled Reprosthetic and Maxillofacial Surgery: Biomaterials, Bone Grafting and Tissue Engineering, wherein he provided a comprehensive overview of preprosthetic and maxillofacial surgery, focusing on bone grafting, reconstructive surgery, and tissue engineering to enhance dental implant success and patient rehabilitation. His 2014 work with Andreas Neff and others evaluated treatment strategies for mandibular condylar fractures, finding a growing consensus among experts favouring open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF) as the gold standard, especially for displaced fractures, with considerations for endoscopic approaches and pediatric cases. In 2016, he reported a case of osteochimionecrosis on a fibula flap transferred for mandibular reconstruction, demonstrating that the transferred bone behaved similarly to the original one, thereby proving that environmental factors dictate bone behavior and pathophysiology regardless of its original nature. His 2017 work was a retrospective study comparing recurrence rates of ameloblastoma following conservative and radical treatments, revealing a significantly higher recurrence rate in the conservative treatment group, suggesting treatment should be tailored based on tumor characteristics and patient factors. More recently in 2022, he explored the regeneration potential of bone substitutes using a rabbit model with two different types of critical-sized defects, validating the model for calvaria defects but not for mandibular defects, and suggesting further research to improve mandibular defect design.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Books ===\nPreprosthetic and Maxillofacial Surgery: Biomaterials, Bone Grafting and Tissue Engineering (2011) ISBN 9780852745670\n\n\n=== Selected articles ===\nFerri, J., Piot, B., Ruhin, B., & Mercier, J.

Sanders (6 September 1924 – 25 October 2011), known as Sandy Sanders, was an English rugby union administrator and international player.\nBorn in Fulham, Sanders was a junior product of Ipswich YMCA. He played his senior rugby with Harlequins and was capped nine times as a prop by England, debuting against Wales at Twickenham in the 1954 Five Nations. He captained the Eastern Counties side that played against the 1954 touring All Blacks.\nSanders received career-ending injuries in a motorcycle accident while holidays in Yugoslavia in 1956. The accident claimed the life of his friend, with whom he was riding pillion on the motorcycle. Scotland international Micky Grant was also on the trip and is credited for saving the life of Sanders by transporting him to a Rijeka hospital. He lost eight pints of blood in the accident and had his leg fractured in three places.\nSanders served as England chairman of selectors in the 1970s and was later president of the Rugby Football Union.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of England national rugby union players\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSandy Sanders at ESPNscrum\nSandy Sanders at England Rugby",

        "revision_id": 1219723583,
        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Copyright can be used to enact censorship. Critics of copyright argue that copyright has been abused to suppress free speech, as well as criticism, business competition, academic research, investigative reporting (and freedom of press) and artistic expression.\nThe most common form of censorship by copyright concerns the abuse of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) either by copyright holders or by the service providers. The DMCA forces web hosts to be overly sensitive to claims of copyright infringement and act as de facto gatekeepers, infringing upon fair use as well as facilitating abuse in the form of bogus copyright claims.\n\n\n== Reasons ==\n\n\n=== Strong-arm deterrence tactic ===\nThe use of censorship of copyright has been described as a legal \"strong-arm\" tactic (guerrilla litigation) aimed at creating deterrents for future copyright infringement by educating the public about the copyright. This tactic does not require a trial, as the threat of litigation against financially vulnerable violators can often be sufficient. Sometimes such activities are called strategic lawsuits against public participation (SLAPP). This has also led to chilling effect, self-censorship or abuse from copyright trolls.\n\n\n=== Censorship ===\nThe lack of consequences for perjury in DMCA claims encourages censorship. This has caused temporary takedowns of legitimate content that can be financially damaging to the legitimate copyright holder, who has no recourse for reimbursement. As a consequence, DMCA has enabled copyright owners to \"censor academic discussions and online criticism\". It has also been used by businesses to censor competition. It has also been used to censor investigative reporting, and suppress political speech. This includes the use of it by parties in non-democratic states, which use international law to remove content from international (Western) platforms like YouTube. Modern copyright has been described as \"an attractive weapon to chill speech\". \nIn the context of American legislation, censorship by copyright has been said to violate the First Amendment; such abuse of copyright is supposed to be limited by fair use, but fair use has been found to be difficult to enforce due to chilling effects of copyright litigation and disparity of power between copyright holders and those seeking permission to use a work. In particular, protections related to satirical use are seen as inadequate.\nCensorship by copyright has also been linked to reducing innovation, creativity, and limiting artistic expression. A study involving visual artists and professionals in the visual arts sector revealed that one-third have either avoided or ceased work in their domain due to worries about copyright infringement. Additionally, over half of the editors and publishers surveyed have dropped or reduced the scope of their projects because of these worries. A 2005 survey of documentary makers in Canada found that 85% of them said copyright is more harmful than beneficial for their field and that it threatens their ability to produce content. Such concerns have also hindered museums and libraries from digitizing and sharing cultural and scientific materials, including works for whom no living copyright holder could be identified but which are protected by the law by default (orphan works).\n\n\n== Technology and laws that facilitate censorship ==\n\n\n=== Abuse of law ===\nMost common form of censorship by copyright concerns abuse of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). That legislation forces web hosts to be overly sensitive to claims of copyright infringement, infringing upon fair use as well as facilitating abuse in the form of bogus copyright claims.\nOther laws that have been criticized for similar problems include the European Union's Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market (Copyright Directive), and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the concept of the right to be forgotten. \n\n\n=== Automated copyright enforcement ===\nThe increasing prevalence of online media has led to content hosting companies developing automated solutions for copyright enforcement to help copyright holders remove alleged infringement from their services. Such solutions, however, are overprotective due to difficulties related to defining legal uses such as quotations or fair use, as well as the lack of authoritative information about who is a legitimate rights holder for which copyrighted work. They are also designed from the perspective of assumption of guilt, as any claim made by copyright holders is automatically accepted, results in the takedown of allegedly offending material, and requires the accused to prove their innocence.  \nMoreover, the risks associated with making a false accusation are low: the person accused must first submit a counterclaim to establish their copyright ownership and then take private legal action to demonstrate actual harm. They must locate the other party in order to enforce any financial compensation awarded by the judiciary.\nConsequentially, automated copyright detection systems built for and used by online video hosting services like Google's Content ID have been used by governments, companies and individuals to block critical reporting. In some cases, individuals have been known to play copyrighted music to disrupt streaming, recording or other activities with the intent of getting other users' videos taken down by automated systems.\nTools used in content moderation have been subject to similar criticism.\n\n\n== History and notable examples ==\nEarliest examples of the use of copyright law to enforce censorship relate to the British government invoking the monopoly of the Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers to suppress texts it deemed problematic, such as anti-Cromwellian and anti-Caroline satirical writings in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. To circumvent the Stationers' monopoly on print, contemporary activists used a handwriting (scribed) method of publication.\nIt has been argued that censorship by copyright is becoming increasingly more common in the Digital Age. It has also been called a major element of censorship found in democratic societies, otherwise critical of the concept of censorship. Hannibal Travis wrote that \"copyright largely determines the accessibility and cost of information in a democratic society, and that it grants rights holders substantial powers of censorship through the threat of prosecution for infringement.\" Modern copyright laws and associated technologies developed to enforce it have been described as \"wielded by powerful government and business officials as a weapon to censor independent news media and deter investigative reporting\". Said laws and technologies have been generally developed in the Global North, and are abused there as well, but are even more commonly abused in the Global South, where traditions and protections of free speech are weaker.\nIncidents described as censorship by copyright include:\n\n1998: Canadian documentary The Kid Who Couldn't Miss was withdrawn from distribution in 1998 by the National Film Board of Canada due to concerns that it would not generate enough revenue to pay for the renewal rights for its archival footage, which was required by copyright laws. Kirwan Cox  called this ironic as \"the public lost access to this film not because of political censorship [the documentary has been criticized by a number of Canadian politicians], but because of copyright censorship.\"\n2001: In 2001, American computer scientist Edward Felten was threatened by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), which invoked DMCA, threatening to sue Felten if he went through with his planned academic conference presentation on bypassing digital watermarks protecting media files; Felten withdrew his presentation.\n2007: A YouTube video from Brian Sapient from the \"Rational Response Squad\"  contained a segment from a NOVA program called \"Secrets of the Psychics\" which challenged the performance techniques of Uri Geller, an illusionist and self-proclaimed psychic. Geller demanded that YouTube take the video down, even though he claimed to own only three seconds of footage out of the entire thirteen-minute video. YouTube nonetheless removed Sapient's video and suspended his account and all videos associated with it. Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) represented Sapient and claimed that Geller's abused the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and eventually negotiated a settlement.\n2007: New York City activist Savitri Durkee created UnionSquarePartnershipSucks.org, a website parodying the official website of Union Square Partnership (USP), a group backing extensive redevelopment of the Union Square area. In response, USP sent Durkee's Internet service provider a notice pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) improperly asserting that her parody site infringed USP's copyright, leading to the shutdown of the site. USP also filed a copyright lawsuit against Durkee and later filed a claim with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) seeking to take control of the parody site's domain name. Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) filed a response to USP's complaint on Durkee's behalf, pointing out that Durkee's parody is protected under the First Amendment and fair use doctrine. The website and domain were ultimately restored.\n2007: The destruction of a recreation of the School of Magic and Wizardry from the J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter franchise during the Durga Puja in Kolkata; the festival organizers were sued by Penguin Books, the publisher of the book series. The Calcutta High Court ordered the structure demolished after the festival.\n2007: As part of its campaign to raise awareness about the treatment of animals at rodeos, nonprofit group Showing Animals Respect and Kindness (SHARK) posted a series of videos of rodeo events to YouTube. In response, the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) filed takedown demands for 13 of the videos under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), claiming the videos infringed their copyrights – despite the fact that the PRCA has no copyright claim in live rodeo events. Initially, SHARK's entire YouTube account was disabled, but the account was reinstated after SHARK, supported by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, sued, eventually obtaining a settlement from the PRCA.\n2008: During the 2008 United States presidential election season, the McCain campaign posted a satirical video that included a clip of CBS News anchor Katie Couric commenting on sexism in the campaign. CBS News issued a DMCA takedown notice and had the video removed from YouTube.\n2009: In September 2009, \"Photoshop Disasters\"—a blog covering egregious photo editing missteps—published a photo of a Polo Ralph Lauren ad in which the model's body was grotesquely smaller than her head. Internet culture blog Boing Boing noticed the oddity and reposted the picture, with some additional commentary. The company sent a DMCA threat to Boing Boing's web host as well as Photoshop Disaster's ISP, demanding that the image be removed. Photoshop Disaster's ISP apparently took the image down, but Boing Boing's web host forwarded the threat to Boing Boing staff, who asserted its fair use rights in its response.\n2010–2011: Legislation such as the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) and Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), which have led to large scale protests by activists, have been discussed in the context of enabling censorship by copyright.\n2011 and 2015: Universal Music Group (UMG) suppressed political speech and ignored fair use by submitting Content ID claims and a DMCA takedown notice against a YouTube channel that included a speech by then-candidate Barack Obama. Obama's campaign frequently used Stevie Wonder's \"Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours\" and the YouTube video included a 34-second clip of the song that is copyrighted by UMG. The videos were taken down from YouTube.\n2013: In 2013, journalist Oliver Hotham published an interview on his blog with Straight Pride UK, a group that expressed support for Russian anti-LGBT law. Shortly afterward, Straight Pride UK attempted to have the interview removed from Hotham's hosting platform, WordPress.com, claiming that they hold the copyright to their responses and had not agreed to the publication. Hotham, with support from the blog's hosting platform, successfully challenged Straight Pride UK in court; however, he was unable to collect the financial compensation awarded to him, as the other party has disappeared.\n2014: EFF claimed that a Spanish firm abuses DMCA to silence critics of Ecuador's government.\n2014: In February 2014 several people involved with the AIDS denialism film House of Numbers: Anatomy of an Epidemic filed DMCA notices against a YouTube science blogger Myles Power, who had made a video series debunking claims made in the film. Power argued that the film was fair use as criticism and education. Several commentators described the notices as attempted censorship. The videos were restored several days later.\n2020: Turkish Erdoğan administration has been using state-owned television channel TRT's status as a large rightsholder, which gives it access to YouTube's ContentID filtering system, to silence critical reporting on the government issuing false copyright claims to the Content ID system.\n2021: Police officers in the United States played copyrighted music to disrupt recording and streaming of their actions by activists, intending to trigger automatic takedown of recorded content by automated copyright detection systems of online video hosting services.\n2024: Badabun, a Mexican media company, registered and managed to remove a video from multiple internet pages for copyright reasons. It showed Jorge Máynez, a candidate for the 2024 Mexican presidential election, and Samuel García, the governor of Nuevo León, drinking alcoholic beverages at a soccer match and insulting the National Electoral Institute and opposition politicians.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCopyfraud\nCopyright misuse\nCriticism of capitalism\nDefective by Design\nLost sales\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nElectronic Frontier Foundation's Takedown Hall of Shame\nViktoria Kraetzig (University of Frankfurt), Copyright as censorship right, Kluwer Copyright Blog. 11 January 2023\nJim Gibson (University of Richmond School of Law) Copyright as Censorship, Part 1, Part 2.

However, their next 11 games saw a return of only 8 points, leaving the club in relegation peril. This came amidst the background of increasing financial woes, which culminated in four key players leaving on March's transfer deadline day, most notably top scorer Onandi Lowe. Manager Brian Talbot had already departed to take over at Oldham Athletic, leaving Barry Hunter to take over as player-manager. Ernie Tippett took over as permanent manager with 3 games left of the season, but lost all 3, condemning the club to an immediate return to the fourth tier.\n\n\n== Kit ==\nRushden & Diamonds switched kit manufacturers to Errea.

Huang Ding (Chinese: 黄鼎), courtesy name Zuoting (Chinese: 佐廷) or Tso-tsing, was a Chinese translator and scholar.\nTheodore Wong's father, Kong Chai Wong (黃光彩; 黄光彩; Huáng Guāngcǎi), originated from Xiamen, Fujian, while Theodore Wong himself was born in Shanghai; Kong Chai began living in Shanghai in 1845. He attended St. John's College in Shanghai, then Episcopal High School in 1892–1894, and then University of Virginia in 1894–1896 as the first Chinese student. He did not receive a degree from UVA; at the time the majority of students studied to get certifications instead of bachelor's degrees. He returned to China in January 1897 and began teaching courses at St. John's. He and Yan Huiqing (W. W. Yen) cofounded the Shanghai YMCA. Theodore Wong married Julia Sih (Xue Pa, 薛葩) in 1898. They had four children who survived to adulthood, all female, while one daughter and two sons died before adulthood.\nHe joined the Shansi University Translation Department, and he, with Zhang Zaixin (張在新; 张在新; Zhāng Zàixīn), translated 23 books. Theodore Wong and Zhang Zaixin translated six Sherlock Holmes works in 1901. Theodore Wong rendered Holmes's name as 福而摩司, which would be read as Fú'érmósī in Modern Standard Mandarin. Subsequent publishers began rendering Holmes's name differently, as 福爾摩斯 in Traditional Chinese, which would be 福尔摩斯 in Simplified Chinese and Fú'ěrmósī in Modern Standard Mandarin; this version became the common way of rendering \"Holmes\" in Chinese languages.\nTheodore Wong became Jinshi in 1909. He began supervising the Shanghai-Nanjing Railroad in 1909. In 1911 he became the Chinese Educational Mission's manager, and so began living in Washington, D.C. In 1919, he was killed with two other Chinese men. He died of blunt force trauma and gunshot wounds. A man was prosecuted for the killing, but the courts overturned his sentence in the case Ziang Sung Wan v. United States.\nDue to preservatives, his body was taken back to China on February 14, 1920, and an open-casket funeral was held on March 7 of that year at Church of Our Savior in Shanghai.\n\n\n== References ==",

Their debut album, Retrovision, was released in June 2023.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2021-2022: Formation, \"Miss Me\", \"Distracted\" and \"Ride\" ===\nHoney Revenge were first formed in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic when a video of vocalist Papadol was spreading online and Lloyd got in contact asking if they knew of any bands that had vacancies for a guitarist. Lloyd, who was moving from Georgia to Los Angeles would later join the band after sending an audition video.\nThe band's debut single, \"Miss Me\", which was originally written for a previous band project by Papadol, was released in November 2021 and was shortly followed by their second single, \"Distracted\" which was accompanied by their second music video. These tracks would get the duo signed to Thriller Records in mid-2022, their first track with the label being \"Ride\", which was described by Kerrang! as a \"hugely infectious, summery new single\". November 2022 would bring the second single from their upcoming album, \"Rerun\", which was written about \"living the same day over and over again with no payoff\" which Papadol says is likely due to the pandemic.\n\n\n=== 2023-present: Retrovision ===\n\"Are You Impressed?\" would shortly follow behind their string of singles in February 2023, describing \"dealing with a need to constantly be productive and well liked in a world where everything we do is documented and put online,\" supported by a music video. This single would be followed by the announcement of their debut, 12-track album, Retrovision, for release in June. \"Airhead\" would also be released alongside the announcement as a further single from the album, a \"self-sabotage anthem\". The duo would also be announced to support Arrows in Action on the US leg of their tour. The final two singles from the album would be \"Worst Apology\" and \"Favorite Song.\" The album would go on to receive positive reviews from Kerrang! and Distorted Sound Magazine. A music video for \"Habitual\" would also be released and the pair's first show in the UK would be announced. In October 2023, they were set to be supporting Meet Me at the Altar on their \"Say It To My Face\" North American Tour, as well as announcing a UK tour in early 2024.\n\n\n== Artistry ==\nPapadol says she's mostly inspired by \"Disney-rock\", with artists like Demi Lovato, but also \"edgier pop\" of P!nk and Katy Perry, as well as the influence from the \"metalcore scene\" with bands like Paramore, who she actually got to sing on-stage with when she was younger. Guitarist Lloyd takes inspiration from the likes of You Me at Six and Pierce The Veil.\n\n\n== Members ==\nBand members\n\nDevin Papadol – lead vocals (2021–present)\nDonovan Lloyd – guitar (2021–present)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Levofloxacin, sold under the brand name Levaquin among others, is an antibiotic medication. It is used to treat a number of bacterial infections including acute bacterial sinusitis, pneumonia, H. pylori (in combination with other medications), urinary tract infections, chronic prostatitis, and some types of gastroenteritis. Along with other antibiotics it may be used to treat tuberculosis, meningitis, or pelvic inflammatory disease. Use is generally recommended only when other options are not available. It is available by mouth, intravenously, and in eye drop form.\nCommon side effects include nausea, diarrhea, and trouble sleeping. Serious side effects may include tendon rupture, tendon inflammation, seizures, psychosis, and potentially permanent peripheral nerve damage. Tendon damage may appear months after treatment is completed. People may also sunburn more easily. In people with myasthenia gravis, muscle weakness and breathing problems may worsen. While use during pregnancy is not recommended, risk appears to be low. The use of other medications in this class appear to be safe while breastfeeding; however, the safety of levofloxacin is unclear. Levofloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic of the fluoroquinolone drug class. It usually results in death of the bacteria. It is the left-handed isomer of the medication ofloxacin.\nLevofloxacin was patented in 1985 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1996. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2021, it was the 223rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions.\n\n\n== Medical uses ==\nLevofloxacin is used to treat infections including: respiratory tract infections, cellulitis, urinary tract infections, prostatitis, anthrax, endocarditis, meningitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, traveler's diarrhea, tuberculosis, and plague and is available by mouth, intravenously, and in eye drop form.\nAs of 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended that \"serious side effects associated with fluoroquinolone antibacterial drugs generally outweigh the benefits for patients with acute sinusitis, acute bronchitis, and uncomplicated urinary tract infections who have other treatment options. For patients with these conditions, fluoroquinolones should be reserved for those who do not have alternative treatment options.\"\nLevofloxacin is used for the treatment of pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and abdominal infections.  As of 2007 the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) and the American Thoracic Society recommended levofloxacin and other respiratory fluoroquinolines as first line treatment for community acquired pneumonia when co-morbidities such as heart, lung, or liver disease are present or when in-patient treatment is required. Levofloxacin also plays an important role in recommended treatment regimens for ventilator-associated and healthcare-associated pneumonia.\nAs of 2010 it was recommended by the IDSA as a first-line treatment option for catheter-associated urinary tract infections in adults. In combination with metronidazole it is recommended as one of several first-line treatment options for adult patients with community-acquired intra-abdominal infections of mild-to-moderate severity. The IDSA also recommends it in combination with rifampicin as a first-line treatment for prosthetic joint infections. The American Urological Association recommends levofloxacin as a first-line treatment to prevent bacterial prostatitis when the prostate is biopsied. and as of 2004 it was recommended to treat bacterial prostatitis by the NIH research network studying the condition.\nLevofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones have also been widely used for the treatment of uncomplicated community-acquired respiratory and urinary tract infections, indications for which major medical societies generally recommend the use of older, narrower spectrum drugs to avoid fluoroquinolone resistance development. Due to its widespread use, common pathogens such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae have developed resistance. In many countries as of 2013, resistance rates among healthcare-associated infections with these pathogens exceeded 20%.\nLevofloxacin is also used as antibiotic eye drops to prevent bacterial infection. Usage of levofloxacin eye drops, along with an antibiotic injection of cefuroxime or penicillin during cataract surgery, has been found to lower the chance of developing endophthalmitis, compared to eye drops or injections alone.\n\n\n=== Pregnancy and breastfeeding ===\nAccording to the FDA approved prescribing information, levofloxacin is pregnancy category C. This designation indicates that animal reproduction studies have shown adverse effects on the fetus and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans, but the potential benefit to the mother may in some cases outweigh the risk to the fetus. Available data point to a low risk for the unborn child. Exposure to quinolones, including levofloxacin, during the first-trimester is not associated with an increased risk of stillbirths, premature births, birth defects, or low birth weight.\nLevofloxacin does penetrate into breastmilk, though the concentration of levofloxacin in the breastfeeding infant is expected to be low. Due to potential risks to the baby, the manufacturer does not recommend that nursing mothers take levofloxacin. However, the risk appears to be very low, and levofloxacin can be used in breastfeeding mothers with proper monitoring of the infant, combined with delaying breastfeeding for 4–6 hours after taking levofloxacin.\n\n\n=== Children ===\nLevofloxacin is not approved in most countries for the treatment of children except in unique and life-threatening infections because it is associated with an elevated risk of musculoskeletal injury in this population, a property it shares with other fluoroquinolones.\nIn the United States levofloxacin is approved for the treatment of anthrax and plague in children over six months of age.\nLevofloxacin is recommended by the Pediatric Infectious Disease Society and the Infectious Disease Society of America as a first-line treatment for pediatric pneumonia caused by penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and as a second-line agent for the treatment of penicillin-sensitive cases.\nIn one study, 1534 juvenile patients (age 6 months to 16 years) treated with levofloxacin as part of three efficacy trials were followed up to assess all musculoskeletal events occurring up to 12 months post-treatment. At 12 months follow-up the cumulative incidence of musculoskeletal adverse events was 3.4%, compared to 1.8% among 893 patients treated with other antibiotics.  In the levafloxacin-treated group, approximately two-thirds of these musculoskeletal adverse events occurred in the first 60 days, 86% were mild, 17% were moderate, and all resolved without long-term sequelae.\n\n\n=== Spectrum of activity ===\nLevofloxacin and later generation fluoroquinolones are collectively referred to as \"respiratory quinolones\" to distinguish them from earlier fluoroquinolones which exhibited modest activity toward the important respiratory pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae.\nThe drug exhibits enhanced activity against the important respiratory pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae relative to earlier fluoroquinolone derivatives like ciprofloxacin.  For this reason, it is considered a \"respiratory fluoroquinolone\" along with more recently developed fluoroquinolones such as moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin.  It is less active than ciprofloxacin against Gram-negative bacteria, especially Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and lacks the anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) activity of moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin. Levofloxacin has shown moderate activity against anaerobes, and is about twice as potent as ofloxacin against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and other mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium avium complex.\nIts spectrum of activity includes most strains of bacterial pathogens responsible for respiratory, urinary tract, gastrointestinal, and abdominal infections, including Gram negative (Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Moraxella catarrhalis, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), Gram positive (methicillin-sensitive but not methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes), and atypical bacterial pathogens (Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae).  Compared to earlier antibiotics of the fluoroquinoline class such as ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin exhibits greater activity towards Gram-positive bacteria but lesser activity toward Gram-negative bacteria, especially Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\n\n\n=== Resistance ===\nResistance to fluoroquinolones is common in staphylococcus and pseudomonas. Resistance occurs in multiple ways. One mechanism is by an alteration in topoisomerase IV enzyme. A double mutant form of S. pneumoniae Gyr A + Par C bearing Ser-81-->Phe and Ser-79-->Phe mutations were eight to sixteen times less responsive to ciprofloxacin.\n\n\n== Contraindications and interactions ==\nPackage inserts mention that levofloxacin is to be avoided in patients with a known hypersensitivity to levofloxacin or other quinolone drugs.\nLike all fluoroquinolines, levofloxacin is contraindicated in patients with epilepsy or other seizure disorders, and in patients who have a history of quinolone-associated tendon rupture.\nLevofloxacin may prolong the QT interval in some people, especially the elderly, and levofloxacin should not be used for people with a family history of Long QT syndrome, or who have long QT, chronic low potassium, it should not be prescribed with other drugs that prolong the QT interval.\nUnlike ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin does not appear to deactivate the drug metabolizing enzyme CYP1A2. Therefore, drugs that use that enzyme, like theophylline, do not interact with levofloxacin. It is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C9, suggesting potential to block the breakdown of warfarin and phenprocoumon. This can result in more action of drugs like warfarin, leading to more potential side effects, such as bleeding.\nThe use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in combination with high dose fluoroquinolone therapy may lead to seizures.\nWhen levofloxacin is taken with anti-acids containing magnesium hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide, the two combine to form insoluble salts that are difficult to absorb from the intestines. Peak serum concentrations of levofloxacin may be reduced by 90% or more, which can prevent the levofloxacin from working. Similar results have been reported when levofloxacin is taken with iron supplements and multi-vitamins containing zinc.\nA 2011 review examining musculoskeletal complications of fluoroquinolones proposed guidelines with respect to administration to athletes, that called for avoiding all use of fluoroquinolone antibiotics if possible, and if they are used: ensure there is informed consent about the musculoskeletal risks, and inform coaching staff; do not use any corticosteroids if fluoroquinolones are used; consider dietary supplements of magnesium and antioxidants during treatment; reduce training until the course of antibiotic is finished and then carefully increase back to normal; and monitor for six months after the course is finished, and stop all athletic activity if symptoms emerge.\n\n\n== Adverse effects ==\nAdverse effects are typically mild to moderate. However, severe, disabling, and potentially irreversible adverse effects sometimes occur, and for this reason it is recommended that use of fluoroquinolones be limited.\nProminent among these are adverse effects that became the subject of a black box warning by the FDA in 2016. The FDA wrote: \"An FDA safety review has shown that fluoroquinolones when used systemically (i.e. tablets, capsules, and injectable) are associated with disabling and potentially permanent serious adverse effects that can occur together. These adverse effects can involve the tendons, muscles, joints, nerves, and central nervous system.\" Rarely, tendinitis or tendon rupture may occur due to fluoroquinolone antibiotics, including levofloxacin. Such injuries, including tendon rupture, has been observed up to 6 months after cessation of treatment; higher doses of fluoroquinolones, being elderly, transplant patients, and those with a current or historical corticosteroid use are at elevated risk. The U.S. label for levofloxacin also contains a black box warning for the exacerbation of the symptoms of the neurological disease myasthenia gravis. Similarly, the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency recommendations warn of rare but disabling and potentially irreversible adverse effects, and to recommend limiting use of these drugs. Increasing age and corticosteroid use appears to increase the risk of musculoskeletal complications.\nA wide variety of other uncommon but serious adverse events have been associated with fluoroquinolone use, with varying degrees of evidence supporting causation. These include anaphylaxis, hepatotoxicity, central nervous system effects including seizures and psychiatric effects, prolongation of the QT interval, blood glucose disturbances, and photosensitivity, among others. Levofloxacin may produce fewer of these rare serious adverse effects than other fluoroquinolones.\nThere is some disagreement in the medical literature regarding whether and to what extent levofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones produce serious adverse effects more frequently than other broad spectrum antibacterial drugs.\nWith regard to more usual adverse effects, in pooled results from 7537 patients exposed to levofloxacin in 29 clinical trials, 4.3% discontinued treatment due to adverse drug reactions.  The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were gastrointestinal, including nausea, vomiting, and constipation. Overall, 7% of patients experienced nausea, 6% headache, 5% diarrhea, 4% insomnia, along with other adverse reactions experienced at lower rates.\nAdministration of levofloxacin or other broad spectrum antibiotics is associated with Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea which may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Fluoroquinoline administration may be associated with the acquisition and outgrowth of a particularly virulent Clostridium strain.\nMore research is needed to determine the best dose and length of treatment.\n\n\n== Overdose ==\nOverdosing experiments in animals showed loss of body control and drooping, difficulty breathing, tremors, and convulsions. Doses in excess of 1500 mg/kg orally and 250 mg/kg IV produced significant mortality in rodents.\nIn the event of an acute overdosage, authorities recommend unspecific standard procedures such as emptying the stomach, observing the patient and maintaining appropriate hydration. Levofloxacin is not efficiently removed by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.\n\n\n== Pharmacology ==\n\n\n=== Mechanism of action ===\nLevofloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Like all quinolones, it functions by inhibiting the DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, two bacterial type IIA topoisomerases. Topoisomerase IV is necessary to separate DNA that has been replicated (doubled) prior to bacterial cell division. With the DNA not being separated, the process is stopped, and the bacterium cannot divide. DNA gyrase, on the other hand, is responsible for supercoiling the DNA, so that it will fit in the newly formed cells. Both mechanisms amount to killing the bacterium. Levofloxacin acts as a bactericide.\nAs of 2011, the mechanism of action for the drug's musculoskeletal complications were not clear.\n\n\n=== Pharmacokinetics ===\nLevofloxacin is rapidly and essentially completely absorbed after oral administration, with a plasma concentration profile over time that is essentially identical to that obtained from intravenous administration of the same amount over 60 minutes.  As such, the intravenous and oral formulations of levofloxacin are considered interchangeable. Levofloxacin's ability to bind to proteins in the body ranges from 24 to 38%.\nThe drug undergoes widespread distribution into body tissues.  Peak levels in skin are achieved 3 hours after administration and exceed those in plasma by a factor of 2. Similarly, lung tissue concentrations range from two-fold to five-fold higher than plasma concentrations in the 24 hours after a single dose.\nThe mean terminal plasma elimination half-life of levofloxacin ranges from approximately 6 to 8 hours following single or multiple doses of levofloxacin given orally or intravenously. Elimination occurs mainly via excretion of unmetabolized drug in the urine.  Following oral administration, 87% of an administered dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged drug within 2 days.  Less than 5% was recovered in the urine as the desmethyl and N-oxide metabolites, the only metabolites identified in humans.\n\n\n== Chemistry ==\nLike all fluoroquinolones, levofloxacin is a fluorinated quinolone carboxylic acid. It is a chiral molecule and the pure (−)-(S)-enantiomer of the racemic drug ofloxacin. This enantiomer binds more effectively to the DNA gyrase enzyme and to topoisomerase IV than its (+)-(R)-counterpart. Levofloxacin is referred to as a chiral switch: These are chiral drugs that have already been patent claimed, approved and marketed as racemates (or as mixtures of diastereomers but have since been redeveloped as pure enantiomers. Distinct functional groups on this molecules include a hydroxyl group, carbonyl group, and an aromatic ring.\nThe substance is used as the hemihydrate, which has the empirical formula C18H20FN3O4 · 1⁄2 H2O and a molecular mass of 370.38 g/mol. Levofloxacin is a light-yellowish-white to yellow-white crystal or crystalline powder. A major issue in the synthesis of levofloxacin is identifying correct entries into the benzoxazine core in order to produce the correct chiral form.\n\n\n== History ==\nLevofloxacin is a third-generation fluoroquinolone, being one of the isomers of ofloxacin, which was a broader-spectrum conformationally locked analog of norfloxacin; both ofloxacin and levofloxaxin were synthesized and developed by scientists at Daiichi Seiyaku. The Daiichi scientists knew that ofloxacin was racemic, but tried unsuccessfully to separate the two isomers; in 1985 they succeeded in separately synthesizing the pure levo form and showed that it was less toxic and more potent than the other form.\nIt was first approved for marketing in Japan in 1993, for oral administration, and Daiichi marketed it there under the brand name Cravit. Daiichi, working with Johnson & Johnson as it had with ofloxacin, obtained FDA approval in 1996 under the brand name Levaquin to treat bacterial sinusitus, bacterial exacerbations of bronchitis, community-acquired pneumonia, uncomplicated skin infections, complicated urinary tract infections, and acute pyelonephritis.\nLevofloxacin is marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under a license agreement signed with Daiichi in 1993, under the brand name \"Tavanic\".\nLevofloxacin had reached blockbuster status by this time; combined worldwide sales of levofloxacin and ofloxacin for J&J alone were US$1.6 billion in 2009.\nThe term of the levofloxacin United States patent was extended by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office 810 days under the provisions of the Hatch Waxman Amendment so that the patent would expire in 2010 instead of 2008. This extension was challenged by generic drug manufacturer Lupin Pharmaceuticals, which did not challenge the validity of the patent, but only the validity of the patent extension, arguing that the patent did not cover a \"product\" and so Hatch-Waxman was not available for extensions. The federal patent court ruled in favor of J&J and Daiichi, and generic versions of levofloxacin did not enter the U.S. market until 2009.\n\n\n== Society and culture ==\n\n\n=== Availability ===\n\nLevofloxacin is available in tablet form, injection, and oral solution.\n\n\n=== Usage ===\nThe FDA estimated that in 2011, over 23 million outpatient prescriptions for fluoroquinolones, of which levofloxacin made up 28%, were filled in the United States.\n\n\n=== Litigation ===\nAs of 2012, Johnson and Johnson was facing around 3400 state and federal lawsuits filed by people who claimed tendon damage from levofloxacin; about 1900 pending in a class action at the United States District Court in Minnesota and about 1500 pending at a district court in New Jersey.\nIn October 2012, J&J settled 845 cases in the Minnesota action, after Johnson and Johnson prevailed in three of the first four cases to go to trial.  By May 2014, all but 363 cases had been settled or adjudicated.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "During World War I, the term Dioscuri was used to refer to the OHL duo of Erich Ludendorff and Paul von Hindenburg, after the Dioscuri of Greek mythology. These two soldiers, emboldened by their success against the Russians, exercised full military power in the Reich from 1916. The dismissal of Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg on July 19, 1917, marked a milestone in the rise of the two soldiers, who gradually imposed their vision of managing the conflict on Kaiser Wilhelm II, forcing him to establish a military dictatorship disguised by the institutions of the Reich.\n\n\n== Circumstances surrounding the duo's creation ==\n\n\n=== Success on the Eastern Front ===\nBy the end of 1915, the two leaders of the Eastern Front had emerged as credible successors to Erich von Falkenhayn as Chief of the General Staff of the Kaiserliche Heer. Indeed, their victories in 1914 gave them the prestige of \"saviors of the nation\".\nHowever, the relationship between Hindenburg and Ludendorff, who was then in charge of the Eastern Front, and the Chief of the General Staff, Erich von Falkenhayn, soon soured. The two commanders of the Eastern Front saw it as the main front of conflict for the Central Powers, but Falkenhayn believed that German victory could only come from a decision to confront France. Applying his ideas to the personnel on the field, he allocated to the Eastern Front only what was strictly necessary to hold the positions he won.\n\n\n=== Allied offensive, summer 1916 ===\nThe Allies planned concerted offensives against the Central Powers in Galicia, France, and Italy at the Chantilly Conference in late 1915. The first, launched on the Eastern Front on June 4, 1916, produced significant results against Austro-Hungarian troops, who were quickly overwhelmed, but it was halted at the edge of the Carpathian Mountains for lack of sufficient air power.\nThis offensive was followed by the Franco-British push on the Somme, launched on a German front weakened by the retreats from the Eastern Front and on the verge of being torn apart. This gigantic battle of attrition robbed the German army of its most experienced cadres.\nThese two offensives were supported by an Italian attack on Asiago, launched on August 6, 1916, which broke through the Austro-Hungarian front on August 9, but failed in its exploitation phase, failing to turn the pursuit of the Austro-Hungarian units into a rout.\n\n\n=== The reaction of the central powers ===\nIn the face of this concerted offensive, the German military reiterated its desire for a reorganization of command on the Eastern front. On July 26, 1916, the Northern Front was placed under the responsibility of Hindenburg, assisted by Ludendorff, and the Southern Front was nominally entrusted to the Austro-Hungarian Crown Prince Charles.\n\n\n=== Nomination ===\nErich von Falkenhayn's position became increasingly precarious with the worrisome military situation of the Central Powers in midsummer 1916. His strategic decisions were questioned, and his advocacy of social measures for industrial workers led industrialists to criticize his munitions policy. These grievances led the emperor to question the position of his Chief of Staff and to focus on the two German leaders of the Eastern Front: Paul von Hindenburg and his second-in-command, Erich Ludendorff.\nOn August 29, 1916, Wilhelm II asked them to come to Pless, which was then the headquarters of the General Staff. Erich von Falkenhayn, who had not been informed of this invitation by his sovereign, felt disgraced and, drawing the consequences, asked to be relieved of his duties.\n\n\n== Action during the conflict ==\nImmediately after their appointment, the two soldiers set to work and quickly became the top commanders of the Quadruplice for Wilhelm II.\n\n\n=== People responsible for OHL ===\nWilhelm II appointed Hindenburg Chief of the General Staff and Ludendorff First Quartermaster General, a title created for the occasion, due to their popularity with the German people.\n\n\n=== The coordination of offensive actions by the central powers ===\nAs soon as they were appointed, the Dioscuri began negotiations with the civilian and military leaders of the Austro-Hungarian, Bulgarian, and Ottoman Empires to gain effective command of the armies of the Quadruplice.\nThus, on September 6, 1916, Wilhelm II was appointed commander-in-chief of the German and Austro-Hungarian armies under an agreement ratified by Franz Joseph in consultation with the Austro-Hungarian Chief of Staff, Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf. However, this military agreement was not met with enthusiasm, as Conrad, supported by Crown Prince Charles, expressed his reservations, about the language barrier and the contempt the Germans had for the troops of the Dual Monarchy. These reservations enabled him to negotiate the place of the Austro-Hungarian Armeeoberkommando in the planning and execution of the Quadruplice Offensive.\nShortly thereafter, the provisions of this agreement were extended to Bulgarian units campaigning in the Balkans and to Ottoman armies fighting the Russians, Serbs, French, and British.\n\n\n=== The political role of the Reich and its allies ===\nQuickly becoming indispensable to the Empire, the two military men forming the Dioscuri pair became increasingly influential in German politics.\nTheir appointment led to a decline in the emperor's influence in imperial politics. Already sidelined from the military management of the conflict, Wilhelm II tried to influence the policy of the warring Reich. However, he was briefed daily on military developments by the Dioscuri, both of whom were respectful to the emperor but limited to the role of figuration and validation of decisions already made.\nNot content with imposing their decisions on the emperor, Hindenburg, and Ludendorff constituted a significant pole of influence in the political life of the Reich. This influence was first evident in their choice of ministers. On November 28, 1916, shortly after their appointment, Ludendorff obtained from Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg the dismissal of the Prussian Minister of War, Adolf Wild von Hohenborn, a little-known but essential player in the management of the war in the Reich during the first two years of the conflict.\n\n\n== The dissolution of the association ==\n\n\n=== The defeat in 1918 ===\nOn September 28, 1918, with the military situation of the Reich and its allies of the Quadruplice deteriorating by the hour, the Dioscuri met and concluded that the Reich needed to enter into negotiations with the Allies as soon as possible to cease hostilities.\nOnce this decision was made, it was imposed on the Reich's political leaders, who met with the military the next day. The Spa Conference was supposed to result in implementing a clear political line for a rapid end to the conflict. It was mainly an opportunity to impose the civilian government's demand for an armistice on a defeated Reich.\n\n\n=== The resignation of Ludendorff ===\nLudendorff multiplied his false accusations against government members once the idea of an armistice with the Allies and the principle of reforming the political organization of the Reich had been accepted.\nFirst, he blamed the Bulgarians who, by withdrawing from the conflict, had forced the Germans to urgently build up an army in Serbia to stop the Allied armies.\nSecond, he attacked the supporters of a compromise peace with the Allies-the Socialists, Catholics, and Progressives who had formed a parliamentary coalition with a majority in the Reichstag since 1917.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nBogdan, Henry (2014).

        "content": "Norteño-sax or norteño with sax is a subgenre of regional Mexican music. \n\nIt incorporates the use of the alto saxophone as the main instrument, as well as traditional instruments such as vocals, button accordion, bajo sexto, electric bass, and drums.\n\n\n== History ==\nNorteño with sax originated in Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico, in the 1940s. Over the years, its popularity had spread to several other regions of Mexico; mainly in the country's landlocked states. It would also gain popularity among the Mexican community in the United States from said Mexican region.\nEven though norteño-sax had its origins in Nuevo León, as did traditional accordion-led norteño, the former eventually became more culturally associated with states such as  Chihuahua, Coahuila, Durango, Zacatecas, and San Luis Potosí; in part due to it being more popular there than its native region.\nThe term \"norteño-sax\" or \"norteño with sax\" did not become widely used until the 2010s. Prior to that, it was known simply as \"norteño\" music. The genre eventually received its own name in order for it to be distinguishable from other styles of norteño music.\nMore recent norteño-sax artists have incorporated modern elements into their music in terms of instruments and lyrics without abandoning their traditional roots.\n\n\n== Artists ==\nSome famous norteño-sax acts include Lorenzo de Monteclaro, Conjunto Primavera, Los Rieleros del Norte, Polo Urías y su Máquina Norteña, Kikín y Los Astros, La Maquinaria Norteña, La Fiera de Ojinaga, La Energía Norteña, Los Pescadores del Río Conchos,  La Zenda Norteña, among others.\n\n\n== Repertoire ==\nStyles of songs performed in norteño-sax include rancheras, corridos, cumbias, boleros, huapangos, ballads, charangas, polkas,\nwaltzes, chotís, mazurkas, and redowas.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Mohamad Ikhtiarudin bin Naina Mohamad (born 30 May 1984), better known by his stage name Mamak Puteh, is a Malaysian actor and comedian of Indian descent.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Cooking career ===\nSince he was young, Mamak had dreamed of being an expert in athletics, but he ultimately decided to follow his dreams in the food sector after seeing chances there. His proficiency in preparing conventional Indian cuisine is well-known. Due to his proficiency and knowledge in this area, he has significantly enhanced Malaysian cuisine. Subsequently, he was able to grow the company by establishing branches in a number of Malaysian cities. The Malaysian Food Association has given him the Malaysian Culinary Expertise Award three times in a row.\nMamak witnessed support from the people for his Teluk Bahang, Penang-based company, Round Island Café. The café opened its doors on 30 August 2020, and serves a variety of foods. As it was easier to deal with, he specifically invited Malaysian people to work in his first cafe. Later on, he acknowledges that he opened the food concept in an effort to support himself and his family by attempting different professions and raising his income.\n\n\n=== Acting career ===\nMamak quickly became well known for his humorous speech patterns and captivating onstage persona. Additionally, he has been in a number of well-known dramas, comedies, and television programs. Along with Ali Puteh, who won the 2015 Color Comedy Project, he is a part of the Puteh ensemble. They participated in Maharaja Lawak Mega 2016 and made it to the finals, where they finished in third place.\nThe Puteh group tried their luck for four years to become champions and become part of Maharaja Lawak Mega. They welcomed a new participant during the Maharaja Lawak Mega 2019, the fourth year of the show, Man Raja Lawak, the winner of Raja Lawak season 5. They were eventually named champions for the first time because of their efforts.

        "content": "Jake Shane, also known online as Octopusslover8, is an American influencer and comedian. In 2023, his TikTok videos featuring humorous reenactments of historical events went viral. Also in 2023, he was nominated for a Streamy Award and appeared on TikTok's inaugural LGBTQ+ Pride Visionary Voices List and on the Forbes 30 Under 30 list.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nJake Shane was born and raised in New York. His mother, Helaine Olen, is an author and columnist for The Washington Post. He has described himself as \"a closeted kid\". He has stated that he did acting as a child, performing in his school's production of Thoroughly Modern Millie in sixth grade, but quit due to his insecurities after switching schools. He also took improv lessons at the Gotham Comedy Club while attending high school in Washington Heights. He attended the University of Southern California, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts and Science degree in public relations in 2022.\n\n\n== Career ==\nShane started his social media career in 2021 as an Instagram food critic of octopus, using the handle @passthepuss. In February 2023, Shane became known for his TikTok videos, in which he humorously reenacted historical events per requests in his comments, starting with the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal, which gained him 100,000 followers within one week of its posting. Other reenactments included dinosaurs seeing a comet, the Last Supper, John Hancock signing the United States Declaration of Independence, Moses parting the Red Sea, and a President who did not make it onto Mount Rushmore. He signed with WME in March 2023; by then, his account had gained over one and a half million followers.\nShane was nominated for the Streamy Award for Breakout Creator at the 13th Streamy Awards in 2023, though the award was won by Dylan Mulvaney. He was also included on TikTok's inaugural LGBTQ+ Pride Visionary Voices List in May 2023. In September 2023, he signed with United Talent Agency for representation in all areas. He was featured on the 2024 Forbes 30 Under 30 list and had more than two and a half million followers on TikTok by December 2023.\nShane's podcast, Therapuss with Jake Shane, in which Shane responds to listener questions in the style of a therapy session alongside a different co-host each episode, launched in January 2024.\n\n\n== Personal life and public image ==\nShane frequently posts on social media about his mental health, specifically regarding his experiences with anxiety and obsessive–compulsive disorder, which he has stated he has struggled with since age seven and was diagnosed with as a teenager. He also often posts videos about his being a Swiftie.\nGeoff Weiss of Business Insider wrote in 2023 that \"no TikToker [had] reached mass consciousness\" like Shane since fellow influencer Alix Earle became popular on the platform the year prior. For Variety, Julia MacCary wrote, \"Perhaps no one better embodies the app's ability to quickly catapult someone into stardom than Jake Shane.\" Queerty's Carson Mlnarik described him as a \"short and sassy queer content-creator\" who \"skyrocketed to viral fame\" in 2023.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Tavern (Hebrew: מרזח) is a ceremony meal and feast an ancient ritual that was customary in the cultures of the Levant, as Apparently the Veneration of the dead, mainly among the the Canaanites and the ancient Israelites. This meal was sometimes held in the family burial cave, with the skeletons of the family's ancestors, in plantations and granaries, or in taverns designated for ceremonies dead In the cultures of Mesopotamia there was a similar ceremony called Hispo.\n\n\n== Epigraphic findings ==\nEpigraphical evidence of a tavern was found in many cultures in the Levant.\n\n\n=== In Ugaritic ===\nAmong the tablets of Ugaritic poetry is a tablet dealing with El who sacrifices in his house from Side and invites to a feast (which is apparently a mourning feast) Additional gods, while calling to drink to their fill. Meat, bread, must and wine are served at the meal. Yarikh, who was not among those called, is welcomed by El since he knew him, but another figure (whose name is not mentioned) whom El did not know was struck by him, and it seems that Anat and Astarte help him and prepare weapons for him. Al is described as \"yetib in a tavern\" (sitting because of his tavern, because of 'but' and ) and drinks himself until he is drunk. The elf 'Havi' mocks him for his uncontrollable secretions. From here the tablet is interrupted and it is not clear what happened next. Al is depicted getting drunk in a tavern in a tavern also in the plaque from the Baal Cycle, but the plaque is very damaged and it is not possible to update information about the customs of the tavern.\nIn the Tale of Aqhat, after the death of Akhat, comes a series of tablets called \"The Ghost Tablets\". are described The Ghosts (related to the world of the dead) as invited to the feast by \"El Merzaei\" (he is the conductor of the tavern ceremony, and the meaning of his name is probably \"El Merzahi, the god of the tavern\"), which may be Danel himself, the home and palace of El Merzai. After a week, the ghosts arrive at Granat and Danal's orchards, and he offers them various summer fruits. The ghosts and Daniel sacrifice a lamb, and perhaps additional sacrifices. The mourning ceremony was held for Baal, apparently to help him after a defeat in one of his wars. The ghosts were invited due to their power to demand from the dead and see fortunes, and Anat is also present at the ceremony and holds Danal's hand, even though she murdered his son Akhat. Akhat is conjured up by the ghosts, and they hint that Danal will not be abandoned this time. The ghosts, described as \"Ezram\" (Izuzim, war heroes), are asked to bless Shem El, and sacrifice champions, sheep, oxen, rams, calves and goats. Then came the phrase \"as money to the Hebrews, this was a coin to the Hebrews when\", which is sometimes interpreted as \"because silver to the Hebrews is an olive, hard to the Hebrews - indeed shesha\" - Hebrews are ghosts, they deserve for the country. The ghosts get drunk with Danal for seven days, and on the seventh day Baal apparently appears, and hence the tablets are damaged and unreadable. 629–645. Throughout the description, the characteristics of the tavern are reflected, including feasting and inviting guests, sacrifice, getting drunk and dealing with the dead.\nEvidence of the Ugaritic marzah also exists in Ugaritic texts outside of the poetry tablets: in the tablets written in Akkadian the word ma-ar-zi-ḫi or mar-za-i-ma, a transliteration of marzeh, was found; In the documents it is said that King Nekampeh ben Nekmed gave the people of Merzah a house, King Amshtamar ben Nekampeh transferred a tavern for the worship of the god Shatern to other owners, and the previous owners were compensated with other property, and also that Kerem ʿAṯtar divided between two Tavern owners from two different cities. Evidence was also found in the tablets written in Ugaritic alphabet: one contract reads \"Dakani Tavern Shamnan B Batu and Sheth Ibsen\", That is, \"the tavern that established a fat man (given name) in his house and there was a manger in it\", indicating that a private citizen could also found his own tavern; In one particularly damaged tablet the word \"tavern\" appears several times, apparently in the context of properties. The word \"tavern\" is also mentioned in a damaged tablet documenting privately owned fields.\nDennis Pardee questions the popular opinion linking the tavern to the cult of the dead, and believes that the epigraphic and material findings do not support such a connection.\n\n\n=== Other epigraphic findings ===\n\n\n==== In Canaanite languages ====\n\nAmong the Athenian Greek-Phoenician inscriptions is the Merzah inscription, dedicated to a donation that one of the members of the community made to a religious institution \"on the 4th day of the Merzeh in the year 14 of the people of Sidon\". Phoenician: \"In the sea 𐤛𐤖 to the tavern of Basheth 𐤗𐤛𐤖 for the people of Zadan\". In a Phoenician inscription from the Temple of Baal-Tzom Marseille, which deals with sacrificial rates, a \"god tavern\" is mentioned, And it is possible that this is a holiday similar to Adonia that started with crying and ended with joy, or a day of remembrance for the gods for their death or resurrection.\nOn a Phoenician ostracon from the great Phoenician archive from Adil it is written: \"give Astarte and Melkart in the tavern eat s/r |\", meaning \"give Ashtaret and Melkerat food in the tavern s/sr 1\" - a commandment for a person to give the gods Ashtaret and Melkerat who are in the tavern a type of food, \"sp\" or \" one sir It seems that the government provided the food for the ceremony, but it is not clear what the role of the gods was in it, nor is it known whether the ceremony took place in Adil or Bakhti, the capital of the kingdom, where the worship of Ashtarte and Melkart is well known.\nIn an inscription on a papyrus from Moab, which some doubt its reliability, it is written: \"Thus they said to them, 'Legra, go, the tavern, and the incense, and the house, and go away from them.' And Melcha. The third.\" , that is, \"This is what God said to Gera: Yours is the manger and Rahim and the house, and Isaiah (first name) will stay away from (possession of) them, and the king will be a third party (who is faithful to the dispute)\". The inscription mentions the ownership of a tavern, and it is possible that the \"house\" mentioned in it is the tavern.\nThe Merzach ceremony is also mentioned in the Tanakh, in words of rebuke in Jeremiah 16:5-8: \"For thus said God, Do not come to the house of Merzach \"And do not go to worship and do not wave at them, for I have gathered my peace from this people, says the Lord, the grace and the mercy: and his death, great and small, in this land will not be received And they shall not mourn for them, nor shall it gather, nor shall it be bald for them: nor shall they spread for them a mourning to console him for the dead, nor shall they water them. A cup of consolation for his father and for his mother: And a house of feasting shall not come to gather them together to eat and drink: Recharge\". And in the words of Amos: \"Therefore now they will be found at the head of the exiles and Sir \"'Merzach'\" Saruchim\". The writers of the Bible opposed this custom, probably due to the idolatrous worship of the dead that was in it, and the prohibition of asking the dead. Also, the connection to the dead, which is considered the father of impurity, is considered a negative thing and because of this the proximity of priests to him was prohibited. In the Septuagint Translation, the term \"inn\" in Jeremiah is translated as θιαξον or θίασον, which means \"supper of mourners\", while the term \"merzach serochim\" from Amos is translated as χρεμετισμὸς, which means \"cheering of horses\", because that is how the debauchery of the drunkards was heard.\n\n\n==== In Aramaic ====\nIn the inscription from Tadmur, \"the sons of Merzaha\", which are interpreted as members of an association or a religious class, are mentioned, similar to the biblical \"sons of the prophets\" or \"the sons of Shirta\" (sons of poetry in Aramaic) from another inscription. The head of the tavern is called \"Rabbana Merzahut\" or \"Rabbana Merzahuta\", and the head of the tavern is called in Greek συμποσιαρχος.\nThe tavern is mentioned in various contexts in the Nabataean inscriptions. The completion of a large agricultural enterprise in the days of Rabal II is celebrated in the \"Merzakh Elha\" - a feast for the Dushrah God of the Gay. Negev.  In other inscriptions the marzah is mentioned in the context of mourning, burial and donations to finance the marzah, in which the names of the priests as well as the name of the worshiped god are mentioned. 856. In one of the inscriptions it is written: \"Dakhiru Abidu bar ... and his friend Marzah Abdat Elha\", meaning \"They remember Abidu son [...] and his friends. Merzah Elohi Abdat\". The certificates also mention \"Rab Merzaha\", the conductor of the tavern, similar to \"Il Marzaei\" from the Ugarit letters.\nAmong the 12 letters is an Aramaic ostracon in which the head of the Undertaker's Association asks the recipient of the letter to pay his share to the tavern.\nIn the Madaba Map, the settlement ΒΗΤΟΜΑΡΣΕΑ Η ΚΑΙ ΜΑΙΟΥΜΑΣ near the Dead Sea is mentioned, which is undoubtedly identified with \"Beit Marzah\" (ΒΗΤΟΜΑΡΣΕΑ is a Greek transliteration of \"Beit Marzah\" in the drop of the guttural 8). There are interpretations that the place is Baal Pa'or mentioned in the Torah, identified as the god of death.\n\n\n== Material findings ==\n\nThe dead in the ancient Levant were greatly respected and worshiped, as evidenced by the dolmen and the slotted skulls found in the area, the preparation of which required a lot of investment. Researchers speculate that the skulls were used for ancestor worship.\nIn the royal palace in the city of Qatna, a royal burial cave was found in an open burial (the bodies of the dead were not covered with dirt or a coffin lid), the findings of which were not looted. A side entrance in the entrance hall of the palace led to the stairs at the end of a sloping corridor, at the end of which was a five-meter-deep shaft tomb, which was apparently descended with a ladder. At the bottom of the shaft was a door, on both sides of which were identical statues of ancient ancestors sitting on a throne and holding a small urn in their left. The entrance led to a main room, from which there were entrances to three secondary rooms. The main function of the main room was the feasts, where most of the burials and ceremonies took place. Hundreds of beads gold and glass in the graves indicate that the bodies were buried decorated, and on the bones were found remains of several layers of fabrics, painted in different colors, as well as belts of gold. Dozens of jugs and bowls were found along one of the walls of the room - the food and drink eaten from the bowls were probably stored in the jugs. Empty benches were found in the room, finds that were used for sitting at the tavern, and under them were found bones of animals that were thrown there during the feasts. In the largest side room, which is the room opposite the entrance to the shaft, no human bones were found, but there was a wooden bench on the wall far from its entrance, and at its feet were found symbolic serving bowls, which were apparently presented to the dead king. The main burial will be done in the right side room. Nowadays, there was a stone bench on which lay the only skeleton in the entire cave that remained complete and anatomically correct, probably the most recently buried, the only one they had time to move. The left room was the secondary burial room, where the bones from the other rooms came to rest forever. Human and animal bones were found in the room, as well as offering bowls, which indicates that even the earliest remains of the dead received offerings. From findings discovered in Qatna it appears that the foods served to the dead family ancestors included: milk, beer, lamb and beef.\nAlso in the burial caves from the Iron Age in the Kingdom of Judah, burial offerings were uncovered that mainly included candles, bowls, goblets, bottles, spoons and jugs, and in smaller numbers also jugs, pits, cooking pots and cauldrons; pottery were probably placed full of food, drinks, perfumes and lubricating oils. Also found on the deceased were jewelry, pendants, talismans, stamps and clothing details, and brooches that were found They also show that the deceased were buried (in an open burial - without any covering) clothed. The concept of the continuity of the existence of the dead required a visit to the graves and a regular and continuous supply of food and drink by family members. The food and fresh meat provided to the deceased are called \"dead sacrifices\", some of which was eaten by the living in honor of the dead, and some of which was served to the dead. These customs are similar to the customs practiced throughout the ancient Middle East.\n\n\n== See also ==\nVeneration of the dead\nCanaanite religion\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nAhitov, Shmuel (1999). \"The Law of God - Legal papyrus from the 7th century BCE\".

        "content": "Abraham H. Salkowitz (known professionally as A.H. Salkowitz) was an American architect, best known for his work throughout the New York metropolitan area – specifically in Queens in New York City, and in Nassau and Suffolk Counties on Long Island. He is credited as being one of the key architectural figures in the suburbanization of Long Island.\n\n\n== Biography and career ==\nAbraham Harold Salkowitz was born in the Bronx, New York, on November 17, 1908. He attended the Hebrew Technical Institute and the New York Building School, as well as City College of New York. Salkowitz also studied architecture at New York University, but he dropped out of the school before finishing his degree. He soon thereafter began working for a Queens architect, Joseph Unger, before opening his practice in 1936.Salkowitz primarily worked on residential architectural projects in Queens up until about 1950. It was about this time when he began also designing commercial buildings, shopping centers, and synagogues – and expanding into Nassau and Suffolk Counties.In the early 1950s, Salkowitz designed the houses for the 150-home Westwood at Roslyn development in East Hills, New York, located on land previously occupied by the Schumaker Farm; he would eventually move into one of those homes: 151 Westwood Circle. In 1952, he designed 515 homes for the 120-acre (49 ha) Southwood-at-Syosset housing development, off South Oyster Bay Road in Syosset, New York.In 1953, Salkowitz designed the 20-acre (8.1 ha) Lake Success Shopping Center in North New Hyde Park, New York; it was completed in 1956.In the mid-1950s Salkowitz designed the houses in the Cherrywood Homes development in Manhasset Hills, New York. This development was built on a 24-acre (9.7 ha) tract by Barney and Martin Spiegel, consisting of 88 split-level houses, and was constructed on one of the last remaining major, undeveloped tracts of land available in Manhasset Hills.Salkowitz, along with his partner, Carl Heimberger, designed the North Shore Towers in Glen Oaks, Queens, in 1971.In 1988, Salkowitz closed his firm. Heimberger continued working as an architect, eventually founding Heimberger & Seidman.\n\n\n=== Death ===\nSalkowitz died on January 7, 1998, aged 89.\n\n\n=== Personal life ===\nSalkowitz was Jewish and was a member of Temple Beth Sholom in East Hills, New York, which he designed. He was married to his wife, Fae, who predeceased him. They had four children and several grandchildren. For many years, they lived at 151 Westwood Circle in East Hills – a home which he designed as part of the Westwood at Roslyn development.\n\n\n== Notable works ==\nLake Success Shopping Center – North New Hyde Park, New York (1953)\nNorth Shore Towers – Queens, New York (1971)\n\n\n== See also ==\nManoug Exerjian\nFrank Genese\nHenry Johanson\nStanley H.

        "content": "Warlord of Kayan is a documentary film directed by Jeff B. Harmon in 1989, focusing Sayed Jafar Naderi, also known as Jeff Naderi. Sayed Jafar is the elder son of Sayed Mansur Naderi, an Ismaili leader in Afghanistan. The film delves into Sayed Jafar's life journey from a former hippie motorcycle gang member and heavy metal drummer in the United States to a political and military figure in Afghanistan.The film won the Golden Gate Award at the San Francisco International Film Festival.\nThe documentary Warlord of Kayan discusses Sayed Jafar Naderi's early years, particularly his transition from a youth in Allentown, Pennsylvania, to a military and political figure in Afghanistan. The documentary includes anecdotes about Naderi’s time in Allentown, from his involvement with local motorcycle gangs to his musical preferences. These details provide insight into the factors that influenced Sayed Jafar Naderi's return to Afghanistan, including cultural, familial, and geopolitical elements. By the age of 24, Naderi had become governor of the Baghlan province and the leader of an opposition force.\nIt was featured in the Sunday Times magazine, including a photograph of Sayed Jafar Naderi taken by Jeff B. Harmon during one of the filmmaking scenes, had gone on the magazine's front cover.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe documentary examines the role of Sayed Jafar in Afghanistan. He commanded over 13,000 armed forces in Kayan, where he focused on safeguarding the interests of the Ismaili community against various groups, including government forces and Mujahideen factions. The film portrays Sayed Jafar’s leadership and his efforts in managing the challenges of Afghan politics and societal issues. It highlights his dedication to the welfare and progress of the Ismaili people.\nSet against the backdrop of the Soviet era, the Mujahideen, and the Afghan civil war, Warlord of Kayan a look into the challenges and responsibilities of leadership within a conflict zone. It also explores the broader theme of identity and transformation, illustrating how individuals can play multifaceted roles within their communities and in the wider geopolitical landscape.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nKayan, positioned in northeastern Afghanistan's Baghlan Province within the Kayan valley and about 30 kilometers west of Dushi, is predominantly inhabited by individuals from the Sadat and Hazara tribes. These residents are devoted followers of Sayed Kayan, who represents Aga Khan in Afghanistan. The community embraces Isma'ili Islam, highlighting its unique spiritual and cultural identity. Additionally, Kayan is commonly described as a center for Afghanistan's Ismaili community througout the history. It has traditionally acted as a base for a military contingent, which included over 13,000 Ismaili personnel. \n\n\n== The subject ==\nSayed Jafar Naderi's early life in Allentown, where he was colloquially known as 'Jeff,' included typical teenage activities before he emerged as a prominent figure in Afghanistan. His early employment at McDonald's and involvement in the local rock and motorcycle culture transitioned to significant leadership roles in his homeland. His tenure as a leader during and after the Soviet-Afghan conflict, positions him as both a pivotal and sometimes controversial figure within Afghan politics. His statements regarding the future of Afghanistan after the withdrawal of American forces express significant concern for the nation's stability and highlight the persistent challenges within the region. \n\n\n== The director ==\nJeff B. Harmon is a filmmaker and war correspondent known for documentaries on various international conflicts, including the Nazi underground in Paraguay and the civil war in El Salvador, and the regimes of Central African Emperor Bokassa and Uganda's Idi Amin. Among his notable projects are \"Jihad,\" \"Afgan,\" and \"Warlord of Kayan,\" which collectively provide perspectives on the Soviet-Afghan war from the mujahideen, Soviet forces, and an independent Afghan warlord. Harmon directed \"Saddam’s Iraq\" ahead of Operation Desert Storm and \"Isle of Lesbos,\" a feature film.

        "content": "Gerboise Verte (French pronunciation: [ʒɛʁbwaz vɛʁt]; lit. 'Green Jerboa') is the codename for a French nuclear test conducted on 25 April 1961. The test took place at the Centre Saharien d'Expérimentations Militaires (CSEM), 50 km south of Reggane, Algeria, then a French department, and was designed as an atmospheric test. This was the fourth French nuclear atmospheric test, after Gerboise Bleue, Gerboise Blanche and Gerboise Rouge.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1957, the French government decided to create experimental nuclear testing facilities in the Sahara. To this end, 108 000 square kilometers of land were allocated to the French Ministry of Defense for the first French nuclear experiments. The Centre Saharien d'Expérimentations Militaires (CSEM) for atmospheric testing was set up in Hamoudia some 50 km south of Reggane, an oasis in the south of the Grand Erg Occidental, 700 km from Colomb Béchar. The Centre d'Expérimentations Militaires des Oasis (CEMO) was later built in the Hoggar Mountains, near In Ekker, 150 km north of Tamanrasset, to carry out underground nuclear tests. Between 1960 and 1966, France carried out 4 atmospheric tests and 13 underground tests in the Sahara.\n\nFrom 13 February 1960 to 25 April 1961, France carried out 4 atmospheric tests, Gerboise Bleue, Gerboise Blanche, Gerboise Rouge and Gerboise Verte, at the CSEM. For these tests, with the exception of the Gerboise Blanche, the explosive device to be tested was placed in a shelter at the top of a tower. For the Gerboise Blanche, the low-power explosive device was placed on a platform at ground level.\nThe French government hastily ordered the detonation of Gerboise Verte on 25 April 1961 immediately following the generals' putsch, so that the nuclear device could not fall into the hands of the generals putschists.\nGerboise Verte was tested at 26°19′18″N 0°04′24″W. From a technical point of view, Gerboise Verte was a failure. Installed on a 50-meter tower, the bomb was designed with an estimated yield between 6 and 18 kilotons, but only had a yield of around 1 kiloton in the test. Yves Rocard recounts that meteorological precautions were not taken, so much so that the bomb was tested in a sandstorm whose intensity masked even the light of the explosion.\nLike Gerboise Rouge, a joint exercise in the contaminated area, codenamed Garigliano was conducted to see how infantrymen and armored vehicles could protect themselves and then operate after the explosion. Conscripts from the contingent played the role of guinea pigs. Shortly after the test, they were sent to a contaminated zone to shelter in manholes 800 meters from the point of impact or in 4 × 4 trucks.\nAn urban legend holds that the bomb was transported from a warehouse in the port of Algiers to Reggane in a 2CV (1,500 km). According to witnesses, only the plutonium charge traveled in a 2CV between Reggane and the CSEM the night preceding the explosion.\n\n\n== Popular culture ==\nThe novelist Christophe Bataille published a story in January 2015 based on this nuclear test: L'Expérience (Grasset).\nThe event is represented in episode 6 of season 2 of the series A Very Secret Service.\nThis is the subject of the short film L'Aventure atomique directed by Loïc Barché in 2019.\n\n\n== See also ==\nReggane series, French nuclear tests\nList of nuclear weapons tests of France\nNuclear weapons and France\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nTertrais, Bruno (2013).

He returned to Florence where in 1787, he was commissioned by the Russian Tsar (via his Tuscan minister the Conte Mocenigo), to create the ephemeral celebratory machines to celebrate the marriage of Maria Theresa of Austria, eldest daughter of then-Duke Peter Leopold of Tuscany, to Anthony, electoral prince of Saxony. In Pistoia, he worked on the restoration of the Teatro dei Risvegliati and designed in 1812 the original, ambitious designs for the Famedio or Pantheon of illustrious men, completed in reduced form by 1827. He was knighted into the Tuscan Order of Saint Stephen. He helped design the Villa Puccini a Scornio, near Pistoia. With the ascension of Cavaliere Puccini as director of the Florentine Gallery, Rossi Melocchi was named as vice-president of the Academy of Fine Arts of Florence.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Empire in Flames is a supplement published by Games Workshop in 1989 as the final installment of The Enemy Within Campaign created for the fantasy role-playing game Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay. Many players found this product disappointing, and in a later edition of the campaign, it was heavily revised.\n\n\n== Description ==\nEmpire in Flames is the sixth and final part of The Enemy Within campaign, and picks up where the previous supplement, Something Rotten in Kislev, ends. The player characters return to the city of Middenheim and discover a civil war has broken out. The player characters must travel into the dangerous Black Fire Mountains to recover Ghal-maraz, the lost hammer of Sigmar in order to restore order to the empire. \n\n\n== Publication history ==\nThe six-part campaign The Enemy Within, designed for the fantasy role-playing game Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay, was published between 1986 and 1989. The sixth installment, Empire in Flames, was a 152-page hardcover book written by Carl Sargent . Cover art was by John Blanche, interior art was by Tony Ackland, Paul Bonner,  Gary Chalk, Colin Howard, Martin McKenna, Russ Nicholson, Adrian Smith, Stephen Tappin, and Bill Thornhill, and cartography was by Charles Elliot. It was released in 1989.\nIn 1995, Hogshead Publishing acquired the license to Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay and published an updated version of the series as six hardcover books.\nIn 2017, Cubicle 7 acquired the license for Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay, and in 2019, began publishing a Director's Cut of the campaign for the fourth edition of the game. There had been complaints that Empire in Flames was disappointing,  and Cubicle 7 heavily revised it, releasing it as the retitled Empire in Ruins (2021), created by Graeme Davis, with contributions by Dave Allen, John Foody, TS Luikart, Pádraig Murphy, Clive Oldfield, Dylan Owen, Anthony Ragan, KC Shi, and Simon Wileman.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIn his 2023 book Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground, RPG historian Stu Horvath noted that Empire in Flames was \"a disappointing climax [to the Enemy Within campaign] ... It is worth noting that Cubicle 7's lush, 10-volume modernization of the camapign (2020-2022) dramatically overhauls Empire, which is a welcome course correction.\" Nonetheless, Horvath suggested that this product as well as its predecessor, Something Rotten in Kislev, were both unneeded, and that the Enemy Within campaign should have ended with the fourth installment, Power Behind the Throne. \nIn Issue 10 of Warpstone, John Foody suggested that players avoid Empire in Flames and instead wait for a revised product to be published.   \nBeasts of War reviewed the Cubicle 7 revision to this product, Empire in Ruins, and commented, \"The new books have been well laid out, packed with details, stunning artwork and some nice nods to the editions of old. They really are a love letter to The Old World and Warhammer Fantasy Role-Play, a perfect way to dive into this grimdark setting.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

After graduating from Jesse Jackson Academy at 16, Bullock began to focus on her music career. In 2010, she released \"Call Me for That Good\" (#89 R&B), which gained attention from record label Cash Money Records. A second single by Bullock, \"Slumber Party\", peaked at No. 82 R&B. In 2011, her third single, \"Color\", peaked at No. 82 R&B. In that same year, she released an EP, Not Just a Pretty Face. In 2013, she released two mixtapes, titled Queen of H-Town. A song from the first version of the mixtape, \"Slow Bangin'\", gained attention and was in rotation on radio. In 2014, she released a CD, Something Different, and appeared in an interview with Houston-based magazine, Houston Trend Magazine, to talk about her career. In 2015, after Rihanna's song, \"Bitch Better Have My Money\" came out, Bullock and fans accused Rihanna plagiarising Bullock's 2014 song, titled \"Better Have My Money\", from Something Different. Bullock later deleted her tweet on her response of the allegations. In 2016, her debut studio album, Stripped, was released. In 2017, she appeared on the VH1 television series, Signed, and worked with Rick Ross on the show, who signed her to his label, Maybach Music Group. On July 31, 2017, her second studio album, Brittany Houston, was released, appearing on ITunes, which she described as \"unexpected\". In 2018, she joined the supporting cast of Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta for Season 7.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums and EPs ===\nNot Just a Pretty Face (2011, Cash Money)\nQueen of H-Town (2013, The Narrators)\nStripped (2016, Just Brittany)\nBrittany Houston (2017, Just Brittany)\nI'm Not a Rapper (2018, Just Brittany)\nThe Gemini in Me (2022, Just Brittany)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nList of charting singles\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Jairo Jorge da Silva (born 9 May 1963) is a Brazilian journalist and politician who was elected mayor of the city of Canoas, in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, in 2020. He was removed from the position by judicial authorities from 31 March 2022 to 28 March 2023 due to an investigation into funds diverted away from the city's health department. During this time period, his vice-mayor, Nedy Vargas, became mayor.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nIn 1985, at 22 years old, Silva became a candidate to be the mayor of Canoas for the Workers’ Party (PT), reaching third place and, with his next run for office, was the most voted for councilman in his city and in the interior of the state of Rio Grande do Sul for that year. He also worked for Tarso Genro during his time as mayor of Porto Alegre in 2001, and was the interim state minister of Education in 2004. In 2006, he assumed the position of pro-rector at the Lutheran University of Brazil (ULBRA), coming into the position a little before a crisis hit the university to become a candidate for mayor.\nSilva was elected mayor of Canoas on 26 October 2008 with 52.63% of the vote. He won in the second round against Jurandir Maciel, who was at that point the vice-mayor. Silva was the first mayor from the PT in the city's history. He was reelected in 2012 with 71.27% of the vote, compared to just 15.47% for the second place candidate, Gisele Uequed. It was the largest vote share of a candidate in the city's history. During his second term, Silva was rated in opinion polls as the mayor with the highest approval rating among the largest cities of Rio Grande do Sul. He had a 77.8% approval rating among the city's residents and the city's management had a 59.9% approval rating.\nIn 2016, not being able to rerun for reelection, pointed towards his vice-mayor Beth Colombo to succeed him. Colombo, who was then a member of the Progressistas (PP), joined the Republicanos to run. The PT, the party Silva formerly associated with, indicated Mário Cardoso as their vice-mayoral candidate.  Colombo led the polls and was predicted to win in the first round, but instead received 45.79%, against 37.3% for Luiz Carlos Busato (PTB). In the 2nd round, Busato won the election for mayor, with 51.25% to Colombo's 48.75%.\nAfter Colombo was not elected, Silva announced his disaffiliation with the PT. He was heavily criticized for, during the elections, not defending the PT's candidate in the municipality. That same year, he became affiliated with the Democratic Labour Party (PDT). The party announced Silva as their pre-candidate for the governor's race in Rio Grande do Sul in 2018. After initially leaving the mayor's office in Canoas, he began a series of visits to cities throughout Rio Grande do Sul during his pre-candidacy as governor of the state.\nSilva restarted his journalism career in 2017, hosting the Domínio Público program on Sunday nights at TV Urbana. In the program, he interviews various public figures and hosts debates about education, innovation, and the future of Rio Grande do Sul.\nSilva was cited by Alexandrino Oliveira, the former director of Odebrecht, in the middle of Operation Car Wash, as having received R$450,000 via a caixa 2 during his campaigns in 2008 and 2012. The Public Prosecutor's Office (MPF) in Rio Grande do Sul, requested that the Federal Police open an inquiry on the allegation. In his defense, Silva said that all of the funds were received legally by the national directory of the PT and constituted installment payments in those respective years. He also mentioned that of the 835 projects completed during his time as mayor, none were executed by Odebrecht.\nIn 2019, Silva announced that he had left the PDT, on the pretext that the PDT became part of the coalition of Busato's mayoralty. Afterwards, he announced he would run again for mayor in 2020. As a member of the Social Democratic Party (PSD), he won the election against Busato on 29 November 2020, with Nedy Vargas as vice-mayor. Silva returned to the mayoralty four years after being barred from his position. His main priority was addressing the crisis faced by the city in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOn 31 March 2022, he was barred agained by judicial decision by the 4th Criminal Court of the TJRS. He was also sentenced to 3 months of detention with substitution for allegedly illegally using resources from the city's National Health funds, and from the Hospital de Pronto Socorro's funds in particular, to pay for a traffic ticket. After a year, he returned to the mayoralty.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Boober Fraggle is a fictional puppet character from the television series Fraggle Rock. He was created by Jim Henson. He is performed and voiced by Dave Goelz in both the original series and its 2022 reboot Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock, with Frank Meschkuleit providing the puppetry in the latter. In the animated series, he was voiced by Rob Paulsen. In both iterations of the show, Boober is one of the five main characters, alongside Gobo, Wembley, Mokey, and Red.\nBoober is a misanthropic, depressed, and superstitious Fraggle. He lives alone in a small cave, and spends much of his time worrying about death and disease. His occupation is doing laundry for all the Fraggles in Fraggle Rock, and he also enjoys cooking, particularly with radishes. He has an alter ego named Sidebottom, who represents the more extroverted side of Boober's personality. In Back to the Rock, it is revealed that Boober's baloobius (the tip of his tail) glows when he feels most at ease with himself, something that happens to other Fraggles as well. \n\n\n== Development ==\nBoober Fraggle was designed by Michael K. Frith, and built by Leslee Asch. Allegedly, his name came from an angry cow encountered by one of Jim Henson's daughters in Devon.  According to an interview included in the Fraggle Rock: The Complete First Season DVD box set, Jerry Nelson originally wanted to play Boober, but Henson instead wanted Nelson to play Gobo, a role he would end up taking. The role of Boober went to Dave Goelz, who has played him ever since. Boober stemmed from something Goelz had said while working on the first season of The Muppet Show, that he was so busy on the show that the only things he had time to worry about were death and laundry.\n\n\n== Behind the scenes ==\nBoober is a rod puppet, meaning that his arms are controlled by rods attached to the puppet's hands, which the puppeteer controls with his left hand while moving the puppet's mouth with his right.\nFor the 2020 short-form series Fraggle Rock: Rock On! on Apple TV+, Goelz reprised his role of Boober vocally, as well as his other role of Uncle Traveling Matt, while Boober was physically performed by John Tartaglia. On the ongoing reboot series Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock, Boober is performed by Frank Meschkuleit (who also voices Pa Gorg on the new series), with Goelz providing the voice.\n\n\n== References ==",

He is a one time cruiserweight world title challenger.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nThompson was born in Manchester but has recently moved to London. He is the son of five time martial arts world champion Geoff Thompson and used to play tennis in his youth.\n\n\n== Professional career ==\nThompson began his pro career in 2015 without having any amateur experience. After 13 fairly easy victories Thompson fought his first real test against former IBO Crruiserweight challenger Vasil Ducar. Despite getting knocked down in the last round Thompson did enough to win on points. Thompson then faced British rival Luke Watkins for his next fight in his first defence of his IBF European cruiserweight title. Despite taking a lot of punishment Thompson dropped Watkins twice in the sixth rounds before the ref waved it off. Thompson then challenged Australian  Jai Opetaia for the IBF world title at the Wembley Arena. Opetaia showed the difference in class and easily stopped Thompson in the fourth dropping him twice in the process.\n\n\n== Professional boxing record ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Jordan Thompson\".

        "content": "\"Buenos Aires\" (stylized in all lowercase) is a song by Argentine singer Tini and the sixth track of her fifth studio album, Un Mechón de Pelo (2024). She wrote the song along with its producers Andrés Torres and Mauricio Rengifo. It was released on 9 April 2024 as the third single from the album through 5020 Records, Sony Music Latin and Hollywood Records. An accompanying music video was released simultaneously.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn March 2024, Tini blanked out her social media accounts and removed her profile picture hinting at an announcement. On 26 March, she announced her fifth full-length album, Un Mechón de Pelo, while revealing its title and release date, 11 April 2024. On the following day, she shared the cover artwork of the album and its track listing, in which \"Buenos Aires\" appears as the sixth song. On 31 March, the artist confirmed the release of \"Pa\", the opening track dedicated to her father, as the lead single from the record. \"Posta\" followed as the second single on 4 April, a song with lyrics about the criticism she has received for her appearance and her private life.\nOn 8 April, a countdown of the official video for \"Buenos Aires\" was launched on Tini's YouTube channel. She later confirmed the release of the song as the third single on social media. In a statement about \"Buenos Aires\", while she thanked her fans for the support she received with the previous songs, Tini confirmed that it was one of her favorites on the album, but one of the ones that hurt her the most to verbalize. The song was promoted with a fragment of the video clip in which a man is heard saying: \"Calm down, my love. Give yourself time,\" while caressing her.\n\n\n== Composition ==\n\"Buenos Aires\" was labeled by Infobae as a \"melancholic ballad\". According to TN, on the song, Tini \"opens her heart and shows her most vulnerable side, referring to the complex stages of depression she went through\" with connections to her breakup with Argentine footballer Rodrigo De Paul. The lyrics of the song, in which she brings up her psychological problems, including fears, crisis and heartbreak, are \"on the surface\"; it expresses: \"Closing and opening wounds / That's what life is about / That love exists after love / Even though it hurts you\". \"Today Buenos Aires hurts,\" says Tini in the song, after she \"always referred to how much she loves the city and how good it made her to be in it\", after months of touring with Argentine telenovela Violetta or in her solo career.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nEl Canal de la Musica for Crónica TV claimed that on the song, Tini \"continues to demonstrate her versatility and talent as an artist, conquering hearts [...] and leaving an indelible mark in the music industry\".\n\n\n== Music video ==\nA music video for \"Buenos Aires\" was released in parallel to the song. It features her dressed in a hoodie and a cap, looking at the city, Buenos Aires, from a dome. Below, the singer appears in a more confident attitude. It sees a comparison between Tini and Martina (her birth name), as the \"person behind her\", following the concept of her previous video, for the song \"Posta\", released five days earlier.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"Posta\" (stylized in all lowercase) is a song by Argentine singer Tini and the second track of her fifth studio album, Un Mechón de Pelo (2024). It was released on 4 April 2024, through 5020 Records, Sony Music Latin and Hollywood Records, as the second single from the album. Tini wrote the song with its producers Andrés Torres and Mauricio Rengifo. An accompanying music video was released simultaneously.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 2023, Tini had given some signs of the song and the album, revealing some parts of its production. In the platform X (formerly Twitter), she shared a part of the song's lyrics in response to a fan.\nAfter blanking out her social media accounts and removing her profile picture, Tini announced her fifth full-length album, Un Mechón de Pelo on 26 March 2024; she revealed its title and release date, 11 April 2024. On 27 March, she shared the cover artwork of the album and its track listing, in which \"Posta\" appears as the second song. The singer confirmed the release of \"Posta\" as a single on 3 April 2024, one day before its release. Parallel to the announcement, she stated: \"After a long time, when I realized that I had believed many labels and comments about myself, I was already completely drowned. I started to talk about them and recognize them, I didn't want them to be part of my life anymore\".\n\n\n== Composition and theme ==\nThe self-referential song addresses topics such as the \"cost of fame\" and the criticism that those who work in the entertainment industry are exposed to, and the criticism she receives through social networks. According to La Voz del Interior newspaper, the singer \"invites [the listeners] to reflect on the media pressure and social expectations that surround certain artists\".\n\n\n== Music video ==\nA music video for \"Posta\" was released alongside the song on 4 April 2024. It features a comparison between Tini, the singer, and Martina (her birth name), as the \"person behind her\". She is seen walking across a bridge, which symbolizes the passage from one stage to another, while spiritually the fact of being able to cross a bridge symbolizes \"will and determination to achieve a final goal\".\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"Pa\" (stylized in all lowercase) is a song by Argentine singer Tini and the opening track of her fifth studio album, Un Mechón de Pelo (2024). It was released on 1 April 2024, through 5020 Records, Sony Music Latin and Hollywood Records, as the lead single from the album. Tini wrote the song along with Elena Rose and its producers Andrés Torres and Mauricio Rengifo. Lyrically, the song is dedicated to her father, who was in serious health in 2023. A music video accompanied the song's release. \"Pa\" marked her first solo musical release in over a year, after her fourth album, Cupido (2023).\n\n\n== Background ==\nAfter blanking out her social media accounts and removing her profile picture, on 27 March 2024, Tini announced her fifth studio album, entitled Un Mechón de Pelo, and shared its release date, 11 April 2024. She described it as a personal and introspective album where the singer talks about her mental health and personal struggles. On the following day, she announced the cover artwork and the track listing, in which \"Pa\" appears as the first track of  Un Mechón de Pelo.  \nThe singer also announced that there would be more pre-release singles from the album. On 31 March, she revealed the release date of the song, 1 April, along with a promotional video, while also confirming \"Pa\" was the lead single from the album. While releasing the song, the singer stated: \"It is out, first song on this album, from the depths of my heart\".\n\n\n== Composition ==\n\"Pa\" is a song dedicated to her father, Alejandro Stoessel, who was in serious health in 2023; he had to be transferred to intensive care in serious condition after a complication he had due to a surgery scheduled in 2022 at the La Trinidad Sanatorium in the Buenos Aires neighborhood of Palermo.  Tini was focused on accompanying her father and her family at this time which led to postponing her Tini Tour, which was originally planned for March 2022, until the end of May. \"Pa\" was described as a thrilling and emotional ballad by Los 40 and La Nación, respectively.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nCristina Zavala from Los 40 stated that \"there are no metaphorical letters to which we must find the symbology and hidden meaning. On the contrary, she has opted for the most direct simplicity that leaves a record of what she has felt and experienced in a raw and direct way\". Writers from Quiero Música said that \"it's clear that it was born from a deeply personal experience [...] And that this single is also a testament to Tini's continuous evolution, revealing a new facet of her art and opening the doors of her world to listeners\".  Infobae described it as \"moving and heartbreaking\".\n\n\n== Music video ==\nA preview of the music video for \"Pa\" was shared by Tini on 31 March 2024, while announcing the release of the song as a single. Directed by Bàrbara Farré and produced by Canada, it was released alongside the track. It was filmed in Madrid, and the creative direction was in charge of Terrivle. Upon its release, the music video reached the first position of trends on YouTube in various Latin American countries. \nThe video is recorded in a hospital waiting room in a false sequence shot, where she sees her life go by accompanied by her father. They are shown from her childhood, professional beginnings and important moments in their life. Meanwhile, she says: \"I'm not going to be able to, I'm not going to be able to do the shows, I'm not going to be able to get on stage. Yes, the shows will have to be suspended, thank you\". It also contains references to the Argentine telenovela Violetta, broadcast from 2012 to 2015, starring Tini, and to the singer's last concert before her father get sicken.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

In Longreach, wards were initially used but replaced in 2012, and in Townsville, the undivided structure was replaced in 2012.\nAs of 2024, 54 of Queensland's 77 LGAs are undivided.\n\n\n=== Victoria ===\nAs a result of the Local Government Act 2020, all rural-based councils in Victoria now have the option to become undivided or have equal-sized multi-member wards. From the 2024 local elections onwards, the City of Melbourne will be the only metropolitan local government area in Victoria using an undivided structure.\n\n\n== Electoral systems ==\nIn New South Wales and Victoria, undivided councils use forms of proportional representation. In Queensland, plurality block voting (also referred to as first-past-the-post by the Electoral Commission) is used.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Greek Women of Souli Running to Their Death is an oil painting created by female French painter Constance Blanchard.  Blanchard was born in Paris and she was active in the early part of the 19th century between 1820 and 1840.  She created a painting entitled Jesus Christ in 1822 but also painted the full-length Portrait of Mademoiselle G (Portrait en Pied de Mme de G.) that same year.  Two years later she won second place in an art competition and painted The Virgin Our Lady of Good Help (Une Vierge. Notre Dame de Bon Secours), a full-length Portrait of Madame la Marquise de la V. (Portrait en Pied de Mme la Marquise de la V) and she also painted additional portraits that same year.  By 1831, she completed a work entitled Assumption of the Virgin (Une Assomption) and even more portraits.  In 1835, she completed another version with the same theme of the Assumption of the Virgin (Une Assomption) and by 1838 she finished the Greek Women of Souli Running to Their Death.  King Charles X of France presented one of her paintings with the Savior and the sister's Mary and Martha to the Sisters of the Visitation of the Georgetown Visitation Monastery in Washington, D.C.\nDance of Zalongo was a tragic event that occurred as a result of the Souliote War. As legend has it, sixty women and children escaped capture and fled to the mountain of Zalongo where they were trapped. Instead of surrendering which would have led to lifelong enslavement, torture, and rape the women decided to throw their children off a cliff and tragically followed them falling to their death on the rocks while singing and dancing.  Countless European and American articles were written about the event and artists began to commemorate the theme.  Ary Scheffer painted Les Femmes Souliotes in 1827, Filippo Agricola painted Young Albanian being chased by a Turk in 1833, Dance of Zalongo was another work created by Claude Pinet in 1855,  Alphonse Marie de Neuville painted Courage des femmes Souliotes around the same period and Theophilos Hatzimihail painted Dance of Zalongo in 1929. The French Ministry of Interior purchased Blanchard's Greek Women of Souli Running to Their Death on September 20, 1838, at the request of Caze, deputy for Haute-Garonne.  An identical unsigned painting was completed around the same period which is now in Nicosia, Cyprus at the Archbishop Makarios III Foundation Cultural Center. Blanchard's painting is on display at the Musée des Augustins in Toulouse, France.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe work of art was created using oil paint and canvas and the height of the massive painting is: 343 cm (11.2 ft) and the width is 400 cm (13.1 ft).  Delacroix popularized the Greek War for Independence (1821–1829) with a series of paintings and many French painters were eager to continue the theme.  The work marks the end of romanticism and the dawn of realism.  Women of all ages appear and young children are scattered around the crowd of women.  The woman's lavish costumes denote the traditional attire of Northern Greece around that period.  The haunted expressions and frightful gazes build the anxiety of that moment.  To the far left, behind the cross in the smoke, the silhouette of soldiers appears as they are approaching.  The smoke from their fire darkens the sky.  The children appear restless and some women embrace their small children clasped to their bosoms.  One woman to our left embraces the cross, another woman prays to the cross with her right arm elevated.  The female statuesque figures are wearing elaborate jewelry.  A young mother wearing a turban, red scarf, and white dress clutches a little girl in a yellow dress to her breast as the young girl's back is turned to the sea.  The mother staunchly climbs the cliff and drags a little boy in a white fustanella wearing a blue jacket and pants embroidered with white.  He supports himself on his feet and refuses to fall from the cliff into the sea below onto the distant rocky coast.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nAthanassoglou-Kallmyer, Nina M.

        "content": "Sebastiano Caboto was a vessel of the Italian Regia Marina (\"Royal Navy\") in commission from 1913 to 1943. She operated as a river gunboat — some sources describe her as an \"oceanic gunboat\" or \"colonial-service gunboat\" — from 1913 to 1938, then as a submarine tender. She was named in honor of the Italian explorer Sebastian Cabot.\n\n\n== Design and construction ==\nBy the early 1900s, Italian traders and entrepreneurs were managing commercial activities in China, especially along the Yangtze. Italians had built  textile factories in China and were managing other commercial interests; for example, the importation of coral, which was processed in Italy mainly by artisan companies in Naples and then exported again to East Asia, had become an important activity. For economic reasons, the Italian Regia Marina (\"Royal Navy\") could no longer afford to station warships in East Asia, and in any event the Regia Marina′s ships were too large to operate without difficulty upstream of  Woosung (now Wusong) or Hankow (now Hankou) on the Yangtze. For years, France had assumed the responsibility for the protection of Italian communities in China. After the ambassador of the Kingdom of Italy in Peking (now Beijing) contacted him about a need for Italian protection of Italian communities along Chinese rivers, and in particular those on the upper Yangtze and the Peiho, the Italian minister of foreign affairs requested that the Regia Marina take steps to address the issue. The Regia Marina decided to build two river gunboats for service in China.\nThe Regia Marina ordered the first gunboat, Sebastiano Caboto, in 1910. Colonnello del Genio Navale (\"Colonel of the Naval Engineers\") Ettore Berghinz designed her, and she was laid down in March 1911. Sources agree that Cantieri Navali Riuniti (\"United Shipyards\") of Genoa built the ship, but disagree on whether construction took place at the company's shipyard at Genoa or Palermo. Launched on 20 July 1913, she was completed in November 1913.\nAt 1,000 displacement tons, Sebastiano Caboto was large for a river gunboat, making her capable of crossing the open ocean, but a precise distribution of weight gave her a very shallow draft which, combined with her good maneuverability, allowed her to navigate rivers easily. According to some sources, Berghinz designed Sebastiano Caboto to operate on rivers in South America, in particular the Amazon River, to protect Italian colonists there. As built, she was equipped with a circular saw that could be mounted on her bow almost at the waterline, allowing her to extricate herself from the roots of mangroves along rivers such as the Amazon, as well as to break through barriers of logs carried by the current. With the situation calm in South America, Sebastiano Caboto instead was allocated to duty in China, and the saw was landed.\nSebastiano Caboto′s armament consisted of six 76/40 mm Armstrong/Vickers guns and four 6.5/80 mm Maxim machine guns One of the 76 mm guns was located on the bow, a second on the stern, two on the port side, and two on the starboard side. Two of the machine guns were located on the bow and two on the stern. According to one source, the crew consisted of six officers (the commanding officer, two ship's officers, an engineer, a commissary, and a doctor) and 117 petty officers and sailors, although another source places her total crew at 107.\nSebastiano Caboto′s propulsion system consisted of two triple-expansion reciprocating steam engines powered by two coal-burning low-pressure cylindrical boilers operating at 12.6 kilograms per square centimeter (179.21 psi). The engines produced a combined 1,000 horsepower (746 kW), allowing a maximum speed of 13.2 knots (24.4 km/h; 15.2 mph). At an economical cruising speed of 9 knots (17 km/h; 10 mph) and with the maximum amount of coal she could bring aboard (100 or 190 tons, according to different sources) the ship could travel 3,600 nautical miles (6,670 km; 4,140 mi), enough to cross the Atlantic Ocean. She also had a substantial sailing rig: Her mainmast had two yards and could carry a square sail, a mainsail, and a counter mainsail, while her mizzenmast, with only one yard, could carry a mainsail and a counter mainsail.\nIn her operations, Sebastiano Caboto revealed excellent nautical qualities, proving to be manoeuvrable, easy to handle, sufficiently powerful, and capable of economical long-range operations: On 100 tons of coal she could steam 1,356 nautical miles (2,511 km; 1,560 mi). One flaw was her tendency to roll, so her crew often used her sails to better stabilize her as well as slightly increase her speed.\n\n\n== Operational history ==\n\n\n=== 1913–1915 ===\nAfter entering service on 23 November 1913, Sebastiano Caboto moved from Palermo to Naples for her fitting out. After its completion, she departed Naples on 11 December 1913 bound for Shanghai. She made the approximately 10,000-nautical-mile (18,500 km; 11,500 mi) voyage in 110 days, 51 of which were spent at sea and 59 in port. After leaving Naples she called at Port Said, Massawa, Rakmat, Aden, Karachi, Bombay, Colombo, Singapore, and Saigon before arriving in March 1914 in Hong Kong, where she met the armored cruiser Marco Polo, which was about to return to Italy. Departing Hong Kong on 29 March 1914, Sebastiano Caboto made stops at Canton (now Guangzhou) and Macau before arriving at Shanghai on 2 April 1914.\nAs soon as a reorganization, which lasted for almost a month after her arrival, was complete, Sebastiano Caboto began operations, departing Shanghai on 28 April 1914 and steaming up the rivers to the limit of their navigability, in particular up the Yangtze. Although her draft prevented her from operating on the upper Yangtze between Yichang and Suifu (now Yibin), she could navigate the middle and lower Yangtze from is mouth to Yichang. She steamed up the Yangtze to Chungking (now Chongqing), negotiating a very torturous stretch of the river: In the stretch between Yichang and Chungking there were, in addition to numerous whirlpools and countercurrents, about 70 rapids, the level of which could vary, and numerous canyons, varying in length from 5 to 25 miles (8 to 40 km) and in width from 50 to 150 metres (55 to 164 yd), surrounded by hills and mountains whose altitude varied from 100 to 1,000 metres (330 to 3,300 ft), and with a difference in altitude of 100 metres (328 ft) in 86 miles (138 km). In May 1914 Sebastiano Caboto was in Hankow (now Hankou), went up the Yangtze to Cheling, crossed Lake Tung-Ting (now Dongting Lake), and then went up the Xiang River, a tributary of the Yangtze, reaching Changsha in Hunan Province, 950 miles (1,529 km) from the sea. Religious missions, who now found themselves protected from attacks by pirates, stragglers, and the armed forces of Chinese warlords and continuously warring Chinese factions, greeted her with great enthusiasm. Despite the many difficulties and dangers she encountered, she never needed to use her weapons, as her mere presence acted as a deterrent without her having to open fire. During the voyage from Italy to China, she had consumed all of the warranted fire hours for her boilers and operating hours for her steam engines, so after operating on the Chinese rivers for a month, she entered dry dock for end-of-warranty work.\nAfter completion of her drydock work, Sebastiano Caboto resumed operations on Chinese rivers. In July 1914 she was in Nanking (now Nanjing) and later in Tientsin (now Tianjin). During this period, she sometimes became involved in armed conflict and had to use her weapons. At the beginning of August 1914, as World War I broke out in Europe, she went to Tsingtao (now Qingdao).\n\n\n=== World War I ===\nAfter Italy entered World War I on the side of the Allies in May 1915, the Republic of China remained neutral and Sebastiano Caboto risked internment by Chinese authorities, but she avoided this by ignoring Chinese demands that she submit to internment, cutting her moorings, and quickly departing for Nagasaki, Japan, where she remained for 18 months. When China also entered the war on the side of the Allies in December 1917, Sebastiano Caboto returned to her patrol duties on Chinese rivers. In 1918, a group of prisoners of war of Italian ethnicity captured by Russian forces while serving in the Austro-Hungarian Army and sent from the Russian Empire to Tientsin, where Italian authorities had promised them repatriation to Italy, grew tired of waiting for repatriation and rebelled. They were arrested, and on 10 June 1918 Sebastiano Caboto embarked about a hundred of them. After spending a night on the ship, the former prisoners of war were taken to the Si-Juan concentration camp in Peking.\n\n\n=== 1919–1934 ===\nWorld War I ended in November 1918. In 1921 a second Regia Marina gunboat, the smaller Ermanno Carlotto, whose construction had been interrupted by World War I, joined Sebastiano Caboto in China. Between January and March 1923, Sebastiano Caboto was in Hong Kong. On 6 April 1924, Lieutenant Commander Angelo Iachino, a future admiral, assumed command of Ermanno Carlotto and, noting the worsening of internal conflicts in China, expressed hope for the sending of an expeditionary force that could carry out international police duties: As a result, the Naval Division was established in East Asia. During the summer of 1924, Sebastiano Caboto conducted a cruise in the waters of Siberia, stopping at Vladivostok and a number of smaller ports.\nDuring these years, Sebastiano Caboto and Ermanno Carloto had the task of protecting Italian missions in China, which, as had occurred prior to World War I, often came under threat of looting by river pirates and the forces of Chinese warlords. The two gunboats also policed shipping on Chinese rivers. Italian standards for the ownership and crewing of Italian-flagged vessels required that shipping companies that owned them have corporate capital that was majority Italian and that the ships themselves have an Italian captain and a crew that was at least two-thirds Italian, even if the crew's composition otherwise was in compliance with regulations in China. Many of the Italian-flagged ships Italian-Chinese shipping companies owned had come under the control of Chinese captains who used them to smuggle weapons. Although Italian agreements with China prohibited Chinese authorities from stopping and inspecting Italian-flagged ships — something viewed as intolerable for the credibility and prestige of the Italian shipping companies and, by extension, of Italy itself — Chinese authorities made several attempts to inspect Italian-flagged ships for illegal activities.  Sebastiano Caboto and Ermanno Carloto therefore monitored Italian-flagged ships belonging to Italian-Chinese shipping companies for compliance with Italian requirements and to detect any illegal activities, and they reported ships which did not comply with legal and regulatory requirements to Italian consulate authorities, who could withdraw authorization to use of the Italian flag.\nDuring the first half of the 1920s, Sebastiano Caboto and Ermanno Carloto, reinforced at different times by the protected cruiser Libia, the torpedo boat Calabria, and the armored cruiser San Giorgio, found the task of protecting Italian communities and interests in China complicated by Chinese civil conflicts. Sebastiano Caboto often visited Chinese \"treaty ports\" and steamed up the Yangtze to Hankow, remaining mainly in the lower reaches of the river because of her draft.\nDuring the second half of the 1920s and the early 1930s, the destroyer Muggia alternated on duties in China, joining Sebastiano Caboto, Ermanno Carloto, and Libia in forming the Italian naval squadron there. The transport Volta, the heavy cruiser Trento. and the destroyer Espero also made deployments to China. In March 1925 the Far East Naval Command included Libia, Sebastiano Caboto, Ermanno Carlotto, and San Giorgio. In 1926 Sebastiano Caboto deployed to Shanghai to protect Italian interests in the city, but in the following years, except for regular visits to Shanghai and Hankow, she was mainly based at Tientsin. In 1932, following the 1931 Japanese invasion of Manchuria and problems that resulted from it, the Far Eastern Naval Division was reconstituted under the command of Admiral Domenico Cavagnari and consisted of Trento (Cavagnari's flagship), Libia, Espero, Sebastiano Caboto,  and Ermanno Carlotto. Later the protected cruiser Quarto replaced Trento, Libia, and Espero in East Asia.\nBy 1934, after 20 years of service on Chinese rivers, Sebatiano Caboto was worn out and losing operational efficiency: Her hull had become worn and her propulsion system no longer could develop sufficient speed to counteract river currents. The modern minelayer Lepanto arrived in China to replace her, and on 7 August 1934 Sebastiano Caboto left the mouth of the Yangtze to return to Italy. During her five-and-a-half-month voyage, she stopped at almost all the same ports she had visited during her voyage to China 20 years earlier.\n\n\n=== 1935–1940 ===\nDuring her voyage to Italy, Sebastiano Caboto received orders to place herself under the command of the Italian East Africa Naval Command at Massawa; sources disagree on whether she received the orders on 19 January 1935 while in port at Aden or after she already had reached Massawa. She subsequently  returned to the Mediterranean and deployed to Rhodes for duty under the Aegean Naval Command In 1938 she was reclassified as a submarine tender.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\nWith its invasion of France on 10 June 1940, Italy entered World War II on the side of the Axis powers. At the time, Sebastiano Caboto was part of the Auxiliary Ships Group of the Aegean Sea Naval Command, based at Rhodes. During the war, she continued to operate as a submarine tender, always based at Rhodes. She often participated with her shipboard armament in the anti-aircraft defense of the island from frequent, but usually unsuccessful, British air attacks. The crew often took the opportunity to enrich their meals with fish, particularly mullet, killed by explosions during the air raids.\nOn 25 May 1941, during the preparation of a convoy that would land an Italian expeditionary force in Crete to take part in the German invasion of the island, Aldo Cocchia, the commander of the convoy, requested that Sebastiano Caboto take part in the operation. Higher command rejected the request on the grounds that Sebastiano Caboto, although small and old, was registered in the naval register as a cruiser and it was undesirable to give the Allies an opportunity to announce the sinking of a cruiser if she were lost during the operation.\nThe Kingdom of Italy proclaimed an armistice with the Allies on 8 September 1943, and Nazi Germany immediately began the Dodecanese campaign to seize control of the Italian islands in the Aegean, including Rhodes. Sebastiano Caboto was still at Rhodes, under the orders of Lieutenant Commander Corradini. The ship was in no condition to either participate in the Battle of Rhodes or flee the island, so Corradini disembarked weapons and supplies to reinforce the Italian defenses ashore. According to one source, the ship was scuttled in shallow water at Rhodes on 9 September 1943 to prevent her capture intact by the Germans. According to other sources, Sebastiano Caboto was moored in port with her engines stopped and only a small crew aboard — most of her crew having disembarked without Corradini's consent so as to avoid having to fight the Germans — when armed German soldiers boarded the ship on 11 September 1943. Sources agree that German forces captured her on 12 September 1943 when Corradini and the remaining crew, after destroying documents and archives, disembarked, bringing with them the ship's battle flag, after receiving the salute from German sentries. However, the ship's Italian flag was not lowered until 17 September 1943.\nAfter capturing Sebastiano Caboto, the Germans refloated her, but her time under Kriegsmarine control was short. Sources provide differeng accounts of her fate. Some sources claim she was sunk in an Allied air attack in September 1943, perhaps on 15 September 1943 while repairs were underway, sinking in the same place where she had scuttled herself. According to some sources, however, she suffered damage at Rhodes in an Allied air raid on 19 September 1943, hit near the forecastle. Some sources claim she was sunk in an Allied air raid in October 1943.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPhoto of Sebastiano Caboto on Italian Wikipedia\nPhoto of Sebastiano Caboto on Italian Wikipedia\nPhoto of Sebastiano Caboto on Italian Wikipedia\nPhoto of Sebastiano Caboto on Italian Wikipedia\n\"La Regia Cannoniera Oceanica Sebastiano Canoto\".

        "content": "A first home savings account (FHSA, French: Compte d'épargne libre d'impôt pour l'achat d'une première propriété, CELIAPP) is a financial account offered in Canada since 2023, intended to help first-time homeowners afford a down payment. It has an annual contribution limit of $8000 CAD, up to a total limit of $40,000. Money placed in the account is tax-deductable, comparable to a registered retirement savings plan (RRSP). Money earned in the account through investments is also tax-free, comparable to a tax-free savings account (TFSA). If the money in the account is not used to buy a home within fifteen years, the funds must either be transferred to an RRSP or withdrawn.\n\n\n== Background ==\nA previous federal program for first-time homeowners in Canada was the first-time homebuyer incentive, which was offered from 2019 to 2024. The government would provide a loan of up to ten percent on a property that would need to be repaid within 25 years and was a shared equity program with household income thresholds. It was criticized as a \"convoluted program that was poorly thought out\". The introduction of the first home savings account was received more favourably. \nAnother federal program used to incentivize first-time homeownership is the home buyers' plan, which allows for a $60,000 CAD withdrawal from an RRSP without financial penalties. The withdrawn funds must be replaced within fifteen years. The home buyer's plan can be used in conjuction with the first home savings account.\n\n\n== Eligibility ==\nTo open a first home savings account, one must be a Canadian adult that is between the ages of 18 and 71. The Government of Canada has a specific definition of a \"first time homebuyer\". While a first home savings account cannot be used to buy a second home, people who have previously jointly owned property may qualify under certain circumstances.  Couples can have their own individual first home savings accounts and use the combined total in these accounts when buying a home.\n\n\n== History ==\nWhile the first home savings account was officially available on April 1, 2023, no major Canadian financial institution offered these accounts upon its release. All Big Six banks eventually made these accounts available to their customers by November 2023, with CIBC being the last to do so. The Canadian Revenue Agency had technical issues processing 2023 tax returns in which individuals held a first home savings account.\n\n\n== References ==",

The house is Category B listed.\n\n\n== History ==\nMeadowbank house was built circa 1690 for the gentry family, the Maconochies of Meadowbank under James Maconochie of Meadowbank who was restored with funds and favour following the Glorious Revolution.\nAllan Maconochie, Lord Meadowbank was a Scottish advocate who inherited the house from his father Alexander Maconochie. After Allan, 1st Lord Meadowbank died in 1816, the house passed to his son, Alexander Maconochie, Lord Meadowbank, the 2nd Lord Meadowbank. Around 1835, the 2nd Lord Meadowbank paid for the house to be heavily redesigned in the Scottish baronial style by the architect William Henry Playfair, a prominent 19th-century Scottish architect. An additional story was added in 1870. On his death in 1861, the house passed to Alexander's son, Allan Alexander Maconochie.\n\n\n== Other buildings and graveyard ==\n\nThere is a private cemetery and graveyard at the south-western edge of the estate that contains the graves of many former residents of the house, including the Lords Meadowbank.\nThe stables and estate builds are still extant and used as an events venue.\nThere is an inhabited crenelated gatehouse on the north side of the estate adjacent to Kirknewtown village. The gatehouse served for a time as a pub, the Huntingtower Inn.\n\n\n== References ==",
