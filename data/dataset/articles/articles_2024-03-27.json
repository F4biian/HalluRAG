        "content": "Manuel Gallego Suárez-Somonte (22 June 1894 – 24 December 1965) was a Spanish soldier, lieutenant general of the Air Force, and the 15th president of Atlético Madrid between 1941 and 1945. Under his leadership the team won its second league title, returned to the Metropolitano and the club grew both economically and financially.\n\n\n== Military career ==\n\n\n=== Early career ===\nManuel Gallego was born on 22 June 1894 in the Badajoz town of Mérida, later settling in the capital of Spain, where in 1914, at the age of 20, he entered in the Toledo Infantry Academy as a student, and in 1917 he graduated as a 2nd lieutenant and was assigned to the 52nd Infantry Regiment. In 1919 he was assigned to the Arapiles Hunters Battalion No. 9 and later that year, he was promoted to lieutenant. On 23 September, he was assigned to the Group of Regular Indigenous Forces of Ceuta No. 3, participating in different war actions.\nIn December 1921, his connection with the aeronautical world began at the Cuatro Vientos aerodrome when he entered the airplane observer course as a student. In 1922, Gallego went to Africa as a volunteer, being part of the 1st Breguet XIV Squadron. On 26 April, in a bombing action, his aircraft was hit by rifle shots and he had to land in bad conditions where he was injured. In July he was assigned to the Melilla hydroplane base and later volunteered in the land squadron, combining his services between the hydroplane squadron and the 1st Rolls Squadron. In August he was called upon to take the airplane pilot course, participating in the following weeks in different war actions such as bombings and photographic observation.\n\n\n=== Continous promotions ===\nOn 22 July 1922, Gallego obtained the title of airplane observer. In January 1923, the Military Medal was awarded to the Rolls Group of which he was part. On 6 June 1923, he went to Getafe to attend the airplane pilot course, completing his 2nd category pilot tests on 25 August and being thus awarded the airplane pilot title of the International Aeronautical Federation with the number 365 card. In September of that year, he obtained the 1st category after passing the appropriate tests. In April 1924 he joined the Breguet XIV Squadron Group in Melilla under the command of Commander Gallarza. On 19 September, he was attached to the 1st Bristol Squadron commanded by Captain Fuentes, marching to Tetuán.\nIn July 1926, Gallego was classified on the Aviation Service scale with the category of Squadron Leader. After the Morocco Campaign he went through various destinations, such as in the Military Aviation Service until the end of February 1931; in the Military Aviation Material and Instruction Services until the end of December 1931; in the Aviation Headquarters until the end of August 1934, and in the Aviation Weapon Instruction and Material Services until July 1936.\n\n\n=== Civil War ===\nGallego was in Madrid when the Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936, and having been caught by surprise, Gallego, in order to save his life, took refuge in the French embassy until 22 June 1937, from where he left disguised and with false documentation, towards the French country, later joining to the national side on the 27th of the same month.\nIn July 1937 and by order of the Air Command, Gallego was assigned to the El Copero airfield to carry out aeronautical retraining, and in August he was granted the job of Infantry Commander. Until the end of the year, he was ordered to attend a flight course without visibility and at night, carried out night bombing services, and was assigned to several positions of responsibility in the aerodromes of Olmedo, Zaragoza, and León. Throughout 1938, Gallego carried out war services with the León unit under his command on different battle fronts. He continued flying in war actions until he joined his post as Automobile Inspector in the 6th Section of the Spanish Air Force, holding this position until the end of the war. Gallego ended the campaign with 269 war services, including 103 with strong enemy anti-aircraft attacks.\n\n\n=== Later career ===\nIn 1940, with the rank of Commander, he was appointed Governor of the Air Ministry. In February he was discharged from the Infantry Arm and then from the Air Force at the beginning of March. On 11 November 1940, he was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel of the air rank, being assigned in April 1941 as head of the 2nd section of the Spanish Air Force. Later and throughout his professional career he would reach the ranks of Brigadier General in 1947, Division General in 1954, and Lieutenant General in 1958.\nAs an observer and later as an airplane pilot, Gallego earned a large number of other decorations both for valor and for the time of operations spent in Morocco, among which two María Cristina Crosses. During the Asturias campaign, he was awarded the collective Military Medal awarded to the Aviation Squadron No. 1. In the Civil War and despite being hidden for a year in the French embassy, once he joined the national side as a pilot, he continued to earn decorations, but the post-war period was perhaps the most successful in terms of medals and crosses, mostly of foreign origin.\n\n\n== Sporting career ==\nOn 14 September 1939, when the merger between Atlético Madrid and Club Aviación Nacional was completed, Gallego joined as a director of the club, known from that moment on, until December 1946, as Atlético Aviación.\nOn 1 March 1941, the then Aviación president Luis Navarro was sent to Rome as a military attaché at the Spanish Embassy, so Gallego, who then held the position of lieutenant colonel, was appointed as the 15th president of Atlético Madrid, then known as Atlético Aviación, becoming the fourth military man to do so after José Maria Fernández, Francisco Vives, and Navarro. Under his leadership, the club, still coached by Ricardo Zamora, won its second league title in 1940–41, returned to the Metropolitano, and the club grew both economically and financially.\nOn 27 December 1945, upon being appointed head of the Moroccan Air Zone, he presented his resignation as president, being replaced a few days later by Juan Touzón. In addition to the Moroccan Air Zone, he was also the head of the Levante Air Region. As the head of the later, Gallego promoted the idea of the \"50th Gran Trofeo Valencia\", a regatta between the boats of the Snipe class on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Real Club Náutico de Valencia in 1953.\n\n\n== Death ==\nGalíndez died in Madrid on the Christmas Eve of 1965, at the age of 71, a year after retiring with the rank of lieutenant general.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Conocybe affinis is a species of mushroom-producing fungus in the family Bolbitiaceae.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIt was described in 1969 by Rolf Singer who classified it as Conocybe affinis.\n\n\n== Description ==\nCap: (5) 7-12 (20)mm wide, semiglobose to convex or campanulate. The surface is uniformly light brown or tan but fades with age leaving the cap centre and margins slightly darker brown but as it is hygrophanous the colours can become darker after remoistening. It is smooth and without striations when young with distinct or indistinct striations with age. Stem: 2.8-6.5 cm long and 1-2 (2.5)mm thick with or without a slightly bulbous 1.3-3mm base. The surface is white-orange to dull pale orange when young and becomes darker with age with a fine pruinose coating all over which is almost floccose above the base when young. Gills: Adnate, close and darker brown than the cap and stem. Spores: (9) 10–12.5 (13.5) x (5.5) 6-7 (7.5) μm. Ellipsoid and smooth with a double wall of around 0.5 μm thick and a broad 1.8μm germ pore. Yellow in water turning reddish or rusty brown in KOH with a reddish tint to the wall in both water and KOH. Basidia: 17-22 x 9.7-11 μm. 4 spored.\n\n\n== Habitat and distribution ==\nIn open habitats such as meadows and road sides often with sandy or gravelly soil and also found on South facing slopes up to 300m in altitude. Found in May and June in Central Europe with collections from Argentina in parks and gardens during January and November.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Numa Broc, born on 26 January 1934, in Versailles and died in Perpignan on 12 March 2017, was a French geographer, specialising in the history and epistemology of geography.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nFrom a family of civil servants, Numa Broc attended secondary school at the Lycée de Perpignan (1945–1951) before studying at the University of Clermont-Ferrand (1951–1955). After obtaining the CAPES in 1956, he became an agrégé in geography in 1960.\nHe taught at the Lycée de Beauvais in 1956–1957, then in Algeria from 1957 to 1959, in Constantine and Algiers. With a doctorate in literature, he met François de Dainville in 1964, who directed him towards the history of geography and explorers. He thus defended his third cycle thesis in Montpellier in 1966 on the mountains in the Age of Enlightenment, then his doctoral thesis in 1971 titled La Géographie des philosophes.\nHe married Marie-Louise Rouzaud, who supported him throughout his life in his research.\nAs an assistant and then associate professor at the University of Montpellier, Broc was appointed professor of geography at the University of Perpignan in the early 1980s. A member of the ERA team (Epistemology of the History of Geography) at the French National Centre for Scientific Research, he authored numerous articles in geographical and academic journals as well as several books. He ended his career as emeritus Professor at the University of Perpignan.\nDespite his visual impairment, which affected him in the latter part of his professional career, with the help of his wife Marie Louise and a friend, he wrote and published his last work in 2 volumes: Une histoire de la géographie physique en France (XIXe – XXe siècles) in 2010 at the age of 76.\nBroc was also president of the Perpignan Alpine Club.\nHe passed away in Perpignan on 12 March 2017. He bequeathed a portion of his prestigious library and documents to the University of Perpignan and the municipality of Perpignan. He was buried in the Vieux Cimetière of Thuir.\n\n\n== Works ==\nLes montagnes vues par les géographes et les naturalistes de langue française au XVIIIe siècle, Bibliothèque nationale, 1969.\nLa géographie des philosophes, géographes et voyageurs français au XVIIIe siècle, Presses Universitaires de Strasbourg, 1975.\nLa géographie de la renaissance / 1420-1620, CTHS, Paris, 1986.\nL'Hydraulique agricole en Roussillon, in Bulletin de la Société Languedocienne de Géographie, tome 4, Fascicules 2 et 3, 1980.\nLes grandes missions scientifiques françaises au XIXe siècle (Morée, Algérie, Mexique) et leurs travaux géographiques, 1981.\nQuelle est la plus ancienne carte moderne de France ?, Armand Colin, 1983.\nLa cartographie reflet de l'histoire by François de Dainville (scientific director), Slatkine, 1986.\nAutour du monde 1767-1771, Voyage de François de Pagès par terre et par mer, Imprimerie nationale, 1991.\nAthanase et le Mont Ophir (foreword), Edisud, 1992.\nDe l'eau et des hommes en terre catalane, with Michel Brunet, Sylvie Caucanas, Bertrand Desailly, and Jean-Pierre Vigneau, Trabucaire, 1993.\nUne histoire de la géographie physique en France (XIXe – XXe siècles), Presses Universitaires de Perpignan, 1993.\nRegards sur la géographie française de la renaissance à nos jours, Presses Universitaires de Perpignan, 1994.\nMontagnes au siècle des lumières, perception et représentation, CTHS, 1995.\nDictionnaire illustré des explorateurs et grands voyageurs français du XIXe siècle, vol. 1, Afrique, Cths, 1988.\nDictionnaire illustré des explorateurs et grands voyageurs français du XIXe siècle, vol. 2, Asie, Cths, 1999.\nDictionnaire illustré des explorateurs et grands voyageurs français du XIXe siècle, vol. 3, Amérique, Cths, 1999.\nDictionnaire illustré des explorateurs et grands voyageurs français du XIXe siècle, vol. 4, Océanie, Cths, 2003.\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nRobert Cornevin, Numa Broc et les explorations africaines, in Dictionnaire illustré des explorateurs et grands voyageurs français du XIXe siècle, vol. 1, Afrique, CTHS, 1988, pp. 11–14.\nAline Rousselle, Le Paysage rural et ses acteurs, 1998, p. 11\nRobert P.

The tour will consist of one Women's Test match, three Women's One Day International (WODI) and three Women's Twenty20 International (WT20I) matches. In March 2024, the Cricket Australia (CA) confirmed the fixtures for the series, as a part of Australia's 2024–25 home international season.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Ashes series will be played in a separate season to the men's edition for the first time since the points-based system came into use. The series will be held in points system, where four points will be awarded for a Test win, two points if it is drawn and two points for each win in the limited-overs matches. The four-day Test match will be played as a day/night match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) to mark the 90th anniversary of the first women's Test series. It will be the first-ever day/night Test match at the MCG. The game will also be the first women's Test played at the MCG since 1949, and the second day-night Test between Australia and England.\n\n\n== ODI series ==\n\n\n=== 1st ODI ===\n\n\n=== 2nd ODI ===\n\n\n=== 3rd ODI ===\n\n\n== T20I series ==\n\n\n=== 1st T20I ===\n\n\n=== 2nd T20I ===\n\n\n=== 3rd T20I ===\n\n\n== Only Test ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSeries home at ESPNcricinfo",

        "content": "A Just World (Russian: Справедливый мир, romanized: Spravedlivyy mir, or A Just Peace) is a Russian left-wing opposition political coalition established in 2024.\n\n\n== History ==\nA Just World coalition was established in anticipation of the 2024 Russian presidential election. The coalition included people and organizations holding anti-war, democratic, socialist and communist views. One of the co-founders of the coalition, left-wing blogger and founder of the Union of Marxists Andrey Rudoy, believes that “the coalition should have appeared two years ago, but the elections became a kind of catalyst that somewhat accelerated all processes. A left-wing non-systemic anti-war camp has already taken shape with a more or less common understanding of the transition program and tactics.\"The coalition called for people to come to the polls on the last day, March 17, at 12:00 and spoil their ballot. A Just World coalition believes that the “Noon against Putin” action could become a starting point for uniting the left and for consolidating anti-war and democratic-minded citizens around them.\n\n\n== Ideology ==\nAccording to the coalition, despite different opinions, it is ready to “tactically cooperate” with the liberal opposition.The coalition advocates for the right of nations to self-determination, and for fair referendums on the status of Crimea and the annexed regions of Ukraine, after their demilitarization.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Organizations ===\nSocialists Against War coalition\nRussian Socialist Movement\nSocialist Tendency\n\n\n=== Journals/blogs ===\nVestnik Buri\nAllo, Macron\nNevoyna\nBlack Book of Capitalism\nNew Deal\nSentyabr\n\n\n=== People ===\nYevgeny Stupin\nMariya Menshikova (RSD member)\nMikhail Lobanov\nVitaly Bovar (Yabloko member)\nSergey Tsukasov\nPavel Kudyukin (Democracy and Socialism group member)\nElmar Rustamov (Labour Russia member)\nSasha Talaver (FAS and RSD member)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Tiger Tjalkalyirri also known as Tiger Tjalkaljeri (c. 1906 - 2 June 1985) was a Pitjantjatjara man who was a guide, elder and land-rights campaigner for his people; especially in relation to Uluṟu-Kata Tjuṯa National Park.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nTjalkalyirri was born at Wintawata, near Amata, in the Aṉangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands. He was the second of three sons born to Kutunari and his second wife Antumara. His totem was the Nyintaka (Perentie).\nIn the early 1920s Tjalkalyirri migrated, with several family members, to Watarrka Country in the Northern Territory, where he had strong connections. In the mid-1920s he moved again to become a stockman on Henbury Station; here he learned to ride horses and camels and became noted for his tracking abilities. Based on these skills he was chosen as a guide for missionaries Ernest Eugene Kramer and John Henry Sexton on their 6000 km camel trek to take a census of Aboriginal people in the region. Tjalkalyirri's knowledge of Uluṟu prompted Kramer to observe that it was the ‘most sacred spot in all the country around’. This was some of the earliest recognitions of its significance to the Aṉangu people.\nDuring a severe drought, between 1925 and 1932 Tjalkalyirri went to Hermannsburg Mission and it was here he first acquired the nickname 'Tiger'. Although he respected Christianity he did not adopt the faith as other members of his family, like his younger brother Pastor Peter Bulla, did. While there he worked as a stockman and also as a cameleer and dogger (dingo hunter). While at Hermannsburg Tjalkalyirri also helped linguists and anthropologists to understand Aṉangu culture and was respected for his knowledge of songs, dances and artefact manufacture.\nHe also played a significant role in tourism at Hermannsburg and Uluṟu and was remembered for greeting coach drivers to the mission and being a friendly face to greet visitors. He would dress in army surplus clothing, to which he added \"ever-increasing badges and insignia\".\nTjalkalyirri acted as an early guide and climbing partner to early visitors to Uluṟu including Arthur Groom in 1947; Groom referred to him as Talkajyerie. He is quoted in Groom's subsequent book saying:\n\nThis is one good country all the time. I live here - runabout - when little boy. Good country all together, Reedy Creek we call Lilly. Bagotty Spring we call Wynmurra. All good country. My country - go all the way across Lake Amadeus and Oolra and Kuttatuta. I take you and show you. Tomorrow we go 'cross desert? We take them ol' camella - plenty water canteen - we got good tucker - good! We go three, maybe four day, that away - right up lake country - right up Ayers Rock, we go!\nHe is considered one of the first climbing guides of the rock and is thought to have actively encouraged people to climb; this was used by some as evidence against the closure of the Uluṟu climb.\nTjalkalyirri played an active role in the 1960 centenary celebrations of John McDouall Stuart's first expedition and 'discovery' of Central Australia and, in 1967 participated in the Hermannsburg Choir tour led by Doug and Olga Radke.  In the 1970s he also participated in the Yuendumu Games, at Yuendumu, which are sometimes referred to as the 'Aboriginal Olympics'.\nIn his later years Tjalkalyirri lived at Uluṟu where he demonstrated his spiritual responsibility for the lands surrounding it. He was present when, in November 1983, Prime Minister Bob Hawke promised that Uluṟu would be handed back to its traditional owners. He was a principal informant in the Uluru and Lake Amadeus Land Claims.\nHe died on 2 June 1985 in Alice Springs and was buried at Hermannsburg.\n\n\n== Resources about ==\nAn oral history interview by Tjalkalyirri, recorded in 1975, is available through the National Library of Australia.\nHe is also recorded in various recordings available through AIATSIS in recordings made by anthropologist Robert Layton in 1977.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 1848 Shrivenham rail collision was a rail accident that occurred in England on May 10, 1848, resulting in at least six deaths and 13 injuries.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn May 10, 1848, at around 3:17 p.m., George Pargetter (the station signalman), left his post with the signal reading that the tracks were clear. When he left his post, he failed to inform the other staff members that a train from Exeter was running late. A merchandise train was already occupying the line as it was being unloaded at the station.The merchandise train was parked between a turntable and a train shed. A portion of the train was still on the main line as the Exeter express made its approach.The express from Exeter was running 23 minutes late because it had to pick up an additional two-passenger coaches at Bristol. Engineer \"Bob\" Roscoe was instructed not to make up the lost time and proceeded to the station at 55 mph (88 kph).\n\n\n== Collision ==\nAs the Exeter express approached, it was too late. Roscoe first saw the obstacle on the track with only 150 yards to spare. The passenger train began to sideswipe the goods train, shattering a horsebox and sending debris flying.Behind the horsebox was a cattle car which struck the luggage car, got jammed between the platform, and then proceeded to crush the following passenger cars containing around 30 passengers. Also injured in the collision was one of the station porters who had been struck by flying debris.When the scene finally settled, the dead and injured were carried from the train cars and moved to a tavern to recover. Four passengers died on the scene, and four more died in the following days, with the last one dying eight days after the impact.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nFollowing the disaster, a trial was held to determine blame for the accident. A jury would not put the blame on George Pargetter, despite his failure to inform the other staff of the delayed train. Instead, the other two on-duty station porters were charged and found guilty of manslaughter.\n\n\n=== 1936 Collision ===\nOn January 15, 1936, the Shrivenham railway station was the site of another accident, again involving a passenger express crashing into a goods train. Again, the cause would be error caused by the signalman. 2 people would die in the collision and a further 28 would be injured.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSouthall rail crash - A train collision and derailment that occurred in a similar, the collision also being caught on CCTV.\n\n\n== Notes ==",

        "content": "Conocybe subxerophytica is a species of mushroom-producing fungus in the family Bolbitiaceae.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIt was described in 1992 by Rolf Singer and Anton Hausknecht who classified it as Conocybe subxerophytica.\n\n\n== Description ==\nCap: 4-12 (15)mm wide and semiglobate to slightly campanulate or convex. When young the surface is rusty brown or light sienna brown becoming lighter and brighter with age to develop a tan colour with yellowish margins whilst the centre remains darker brown. Smooth and hygrophanous with only slight striations. Stem: 2–3.5 cm long and 0.8-1.5mm thick with a slightly bulbous 1-2mm base. The surface is light yellowish white when young and more yellow in the middle but matures to ochre or rusty yellow all over. The entire surface has a farinose-pruinose coating sometimes with slight striations running up the length of the stem. Gills: Adnate, subdistant, starting light yellow but maturing to rusty brown. Spores: (8) 9.5-12 (14) x (5.5) 6.3-7.5 (9) x (4) 5-5-7 (7.5) μm. Lentiform and smooth with a wall that is around 0.5 μm thick and a broad 1.2-2 μm germ pore. Yellow in water turning chestnut or rusty brown in KOH with a reddish tint to the wall in both water and KOH. Basidia: 15-22 x 8.5-11.5 μm. 4 spored.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe specific epithet subxerophytica is named for the xerophytic environment in which the species is found.\n\n\n== Habitat and distribution ==\nIn dry grassland in open spaces and on South facing slopes with sandy, gravelly or loess soil. From May to June or sometimes until September. The specimens studied by Singer and Hausknecht were found in Austria and Greece.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "John Duff (born March 3, 1988) is an American singer, songwriter, actor, director, dancer, choreographer, and social media influencer. Duff came to prominence on social media and rose to greater prominence following the release of several viral hit singles, including \"Girly\", \"Rich\", and \"Hokie Pokie\".\n\n\n== Early life ==\nJohn Duff was born and raised in Howard County, Maryland, the youngest of two sisters and one brother. During his childhood, Duff recalls being musically influenced by his older sisters' music choices, including artists like Mariah Carey. He was also a fan of Janet Jackson, Britney Spears, and Michael Jackson. He became interested in public speaking and engaged in talent shows and local musical productions. His first musical role as a child was Conrad Birdie in a local production of Bye Bye Birdie. Duff states that he was bullied as early as age 8 for being perceived as gay. The bullying continued through middle school, to the point that he contemplated suicide. Duff recalled not having friends until his junior year of high school. After graduating from high school, he attended Syracuse University, graduating with a BFA in musical theater.\n\n\n== Career in musical theater ==\nIn 2011, at age 21, Duff auditioned for the first season of the reality television contest X-Factor, but was negatively received by the judges, with judge Simon Cowell allegedly implying Duff was transgender for his feminine mannerisms, while judge Paula Abdul described him as \"strange\", which Duff interpreted as a commentary on his sexual orientation. Feeling that the judges were commenting on his persona rather than his abilities, he described the experience as \"the most degrading and humiliating experience of his life.\" Landing a job in a stage musical adaptation of Saved by the Bell (Bayside! The Musical!, an unauthorized parody of the show) helped rebuild his confidence afterward, and he continued to work in musical theater in New York for six years. After working in the musical for three years, in 2016, he directed the off-Broadway production of Katdashians! Break the Musical!, an unauthorized parody of both Keeping Up with the Kardashians and Cats. The musical extended its initial run, but was later forced to close following litigation from Andrew Lloyd Webber.\n\n\n== Music career ==\n\n\n=== Debut singles and internet fame ===\nFinding musical theater to be creatively limiting as an actor, and following encouragement from Perez Hilton while working together in a different production in Toronto, he moved to West Hollywood to pursue his music career, eventually moving to Los Angeles in 2017. Before releasing his first single, Duff cultivated a significant online presence, posting videos address LGBTQ political issues, messages of positivity to the LGBTQ community, showcasing his life, and his ability to sing. His online popularity and imminent music career led Instinct Magazine to describe him as \"[maybe] the most important gay pop star today, and he is yet to release his first single!\"In August 2018, he released his debut single, \"Girly\", with an accompanying video on Youtube. The video is an homage to the music video for Mariah Carey's 1999 single \"Heartbreaker\", as well as other female pop singers' music videos from the late-90s and 2000s, like Christina Aguilera, Madonna, and Britney Spears. The video also featured drag queens Bianca Del Rio, Willam Belli, and Mariah Paris Balenciaga, all friends of Duff's. Duff spoke extensively about the desire to challenge criticisms of embracing femininity, especially as a gay artist, ones that he had received both before and throughout his career. The video was well received, with Out Magazine describing Duff as \"poised to become the next big gay pop star.\" As of 2021, the video received 800,000 views on Youtube, along with hundreds of thousands of streams on streaming services, with write ups on outlets such as OUT Magazine, HuffPost, and Instinct, among others.\"Girly\" was followed up by his next single, the hip-hop mid-tempo song \"Rich\", made with producer Alex Delicata, released in September 2018. The song and its accompanying video provide \"commentary on pop culture’s love-hate obsession with the rich and famous.\" In 2019, he made his film debut in the gay coming-of-age movie Cubby, written and directed by Mark Blane and Ben Mankoff.He released several more singles through the following year, including \"Hokie Pokie\" in September 2020. The single, described as \"straddling the line between hip hop and house\" and \"scorchingly provocative\", is about cunnilingus, and Duff's writing received positive reviews from various outlets, who also interpreted it as a song about anilingus. The video was directed by Brad Hammer, and drew comparisons with Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion's 2020 single \"WAP\", a comparison that disappointed Duff, as he felt it misconstrued \"Hokie Pokie\" as a parody, despite the video being shot a week before \"WAP\" debuted.His next single was \"Give a Fuck\", which was also produced in collaboration with Delicata. The track was described as blending Duff's Broadway sensibilities with R&B and \"feel-good pop rhythms\". Reviewers noted inspiration for the music video from artists like Liberace and TLC, and describing it as \"perfect love song for the age of the pandemic.\" Following the release of \"Give a Fuck\", Duff indicated that he was set to release an EP in 2021. He continued to release singles in early 2021, including \"Do It\", \"I Hate LA\", and  \"100% Baby\".\n\n\n=== Homo•Sapien EP (2021) - present ===\nDuff released his debut EP Homo•Sapien in June 2021, produced by Koil PreAmple. Stephen Daw of Billboard praised the album, calling it a \"fabulous new project\" and noting the tracks' themes of queer masculinity and religious discrimination. Duff described the EP as \"a collection of songs that I wrote without consideration of rules\", writing them about \"everything [he] was told he shouldn’t do in life.\" A portion of the EP's sales also contributed to The Future Perfect Project, an organization dedicated to promoting performances of original work by queer youth.The EP's debut single was \"High Heels\", a track that included vocals from Tony Award-winning Broadway singer Lillias White. Writing for PopWrapped, Rebecca Haslam described the debut single as having \"lush orchestrations and breathtaking vocals\" from Duff and White. In his review of the album, Stephen Daw noted \"High Heels\" as the highlight of Homo•Sapien, calling it the \"musical pinnacle equivalent to a confetti cannon exploding.\" The accompanying music video was directed by Duff and Shawn Adeli. The second single off the EP was \"Is It A Sin\", released in 2022, with remix collaborations with Eric Kupper.Duff also co-wrote two of Kylie Sonique Love's singles: \"Complete Me\" and \"Do It Like Dolly\", while also providing creative direction for the latter's accompanying music video.In 2023, Duff released four independent singles: \"Cruise Control\", \"House on Fire\", \"Somebody's Daughter\", and \"Gravity\". \"House on Fire\", released in June, was written about feelings Duff had upon going on a first date with someone who he believed was \"the one\". Its accompanying music video explored the dark side of obsession and social media. The track was described as a \"nostalgic and groovy\" \"breezy throwback\". Duff wrote the track with Eren Cannata, with additional collaboration with Delicata and Luke Moellman. Xavier Hamel directed the video, with creative direction by Adrian Gilliland and Duff. In the video, Duff portrays an aspiring social media influencer whose social media depicts positivity, while behind the scenes, Duff is keeping a woman captive while torturing her and obsessing over his image. Duff's TikTok dance routine was choreographed by Duff himself, and was recreated on the social media platform by Paula Abdul.\"Somebody's Daughter\" was released in September 2023, along with its music video. The video came to attention by several outlets for Duff's nearly nude scenes, where he portrayed a gay man pretending to be heterosexual for his viewing audience. The nude scenes with Duff and video co-star Nellie Salisbury—who debuted in Duff's video for \"House on Fire\"—came about after the video's costumer disappeared during shooting, leaving them in a lurch. Duff then shopped at various stripper costuming stores to fit the scenes and they opted instead to shoot some scenes in the nude, something the crew was unaware of until they walked onto set. The video satirizes the trend of straight artists being accused of \"queer-baiting\" for attention, in what Duff and outlets referred to as \"straight-baiting\". In reference to the misogynistic lyrical content of the song and double standards in the industry, Duff said, “I’ve been told over and over that the themes of my music aren’t ‘for everyone,’ so I wrote a super misogynistic song that now ‘everyone’ can enjoy.” He also commented on frustration with the \"queer-baiting\" phenomenon as one in which gay artists failed to get attention from LGBT audiences, while straight artists pandering to queer interests were celebrated. In a PRIDE interview, Duff reflected, \"I had been making songs that were explicitly gay and they were to my detriment, which is really hard to take when you're watching every other mainstream artist pretend to be gay.\"Duff released his fourth new single, \"Gravity\" in November 2023.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 2020, Duff described his sexuality as a complex journey of rediscovery. \"I’m on a journey...I’ve been really curious about my sexuality lately. Really confused, but not any sort of crisis. I’m at peace with it...So, I’m not gay. I’m not bi. I’m not straight. I’m not asexual. I don’t even know anymore. I’m just living. Boxes are stupid.\" He stated being open to attraction to women as well, something he felt he had rejected after internalizing being called gay by antagonizers since his childhood. As of 2023, Duff was romantically linked with actor Rafael de la Fuente.Duff has also been open with his journey to sobriety. Duff describes his 20s as a period of struggle with his mental health and addiction, which he worked through, including abstaining from alcohol consumption. He had attempted sobriety several times, but as of 2023, has been over 3 years sober.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Remixes ===\n\n\n=== EPs ===\n\n\n== References ==",

It was described again in 1980 by the Scottish mycologist Roy Watling who classified it as Conocybe mesospora.\n\n\n== Description ==\nCap: 0.9-2.5 cm wide and semiglobate to convex or sometimes campanulate with a slight umbo. When young the centre is rust brown to chestnut brown with a lighter orange brown colour towards the margins and becoming lighter with age. It is smooth and hygrophanous with striations that are more distinct when moist. Stem: 2–6.5 cm long and 1–2.5mm or at most 4m thick with a small, distinct bulbous base that is 1.3-3mm or 6mm at most. The surface is pale yellow when young with a slightly darker base and it matures to an orangy yellow with a dirty coloured base. The entire surface has a pruinose coating. Gills: Close to distant, rusty yellow to light rusty brown. Spores: (6.5) 7.5-10 (11) x (4) 4.5-5.7 (6.5) μm. Smooth and thick walled with a broad germ pore. Yellow in water and rusty brown in KOH. Basidia: 19-27 x 8.5-10.5 μm. 2 to 4 spored.\n\n\n== Habitat and distribution ==\nFound in woods, meadows and fields especially along paths in ditches and on the margins of fields and also found in dry places amongst grass and shrubs. May until October in Austria with a peak during September.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Mercer's Fort was a temporary fort built by Colonel Hugh Mercer during the winter of 1758–1759, to secure the \"forks of the Ohio,\" at the confluence of the Monongahela River and the Allegheny River, where Mercer was preparing to build Fort Pitt.: 7–14  At the time it was loosely known as \"the fort at Pittsburgh,\" and when work on Fort Pitt had progressed, it was sometimes referred to as \"the first Fort Pitt.\" Only later did people call it \"Mercer's Fort,\" leading to confusion with Fort Mercer in New Jersey. The fort initially served to defend the site, but as Fort Pitt neared completion, it was used mostly to lodge workers and to store supplies. In mid-1760 it was partially dismantled, with some buildings converted into a hospital.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn January 1754 Major George Washington, returning from a meeting with the French commander at Fort Le Boeuf, observed the land at the confluence of the Allegheny River and the Ohio River, and felt it would be an ideal location for a fort, which would then serve to monitor river traffic heading west into the Ohio Country. As the French had already started building a chain of forts south of Lake Erie, it seemed likely that they would build a fort at this spot, therefore Governor James Hamilton attempted to get funding from the Pennsylvania Provincial Council for an English fort, without success.: 538–39  The Ohio Company of Virginia was willing to fund the fort's construction, however, and in February Virginia Governor Robert Dinwiddie sent William Trent and a small number of Virginia militia to start construction of what was later named Fort Prince George. By April, the land had been cleared and a storehouse built, but the French discovered the project and sent a large force of infantry and artillery to capture it. They built Fort Duquesne at the same site, and maintained control over Ohio River traffic until the Forbes Expedition threatened to take the fort. On November 24, 1758, the French burned Fort Duquesne and retreated. Within two weeks, Colonel Hugh Mercer had started construction on a temporary fort, to serve as lodging, storage and defense during the building of the much larger Fort Pitt.\n\n\n== Construction ==\nThe temporary fortification was built just south of what later became the Flag Bastion, now located in Point State Park. It was located on the north bank of the Monongahela at the south end of what, later, was West street in the city of Pittsburgh, and between West street and Liberty Avenue, about 200 yards east of the ruins of Fort Duquesne. It was a small stockade with bastions, designed to accommodate a garrison of 200 men, built between December 1758 and early January 1759.: 266  It was intended only for temporary use, to defend against French or Native American attacks while the main fort was under construction. Colonel Hugh Mercer was placed in command, and the rest of the army marched back to the settlements.\nMercer's Fort was a square stockade with the walls formed by the backs of the interior buildings. Mercer chose not to build an outer wall, but instead constructed three barracks, the commandant's house, and a storeroom facing the gate, with four diamond-shaped bastions between them, at each corner.: 119  Smaller separate houses for the officers and the bombardiers were located in the northern bastions. The southern bastions held the gunpowder magazine and the hospital. The fort was purposely built on the Monongahela riverbank, so that the troops could escape by boat downriver in the event of an overwhelming assault.: 140 \nOutside the fort Mercer had a \"council house\" built, for meetings with Native Americans, as he knew that maintaining good diplomatic relations with them was a key part of the fort's defense.: 113  This was the venue for a number of important conferences, the first of which took place on July 4, 1759, and included George Croghan, Colonel Mercer, William Trent, Andrew Montour, interpreter, Lenape chief King Beaver, and Seneca war leader Guyasuta.: 172 \nDue to the severe cold, construction was painfully slow, as the frozen soil was difficult to dig and felled trees had to dragged across the icebound river. On December 19, Mercer wrote to his commander, Colonel Henry Bouquet: \"I expect in four Days to have the Place made capable of a tolerable Defence, and am fully determined to maintain the Post, or at least, make it as dear a Purchase to the Enemy as possible.\" Engineer Harry Gordon was sent to advise Mercer on construction. On January 3, Mercer wrote to Bouquet that \"Nine Hundred and Fifty men may be contained in the Fort by building Barracks opposite the storehouses, and hutts might be raised in the front within the Intrenchments you have Directed to be made, to lodge 100 more.\" On January 19 Mercer wrote, \"I am glad to have Mr. Gordon's Directions and shall conform to them...Another Row of Barracks are now raising, opposite the Stores.\" An additional row of barracks was built along the shore, to house the hundreds of men needed to construct the massive Fort Pitt.: 148 \nIn April 1759, General Henry Bouquet asked Mercer to relocate the fort to higher ground, and sent another British engineer James Robertson to assist him. The engineer recommended a hilltop in what is now Chartiers Township, Pennsylvania, which Mercer agreed was \"strong, convenient, heathfull, and pleasant,\" but noted that they would need long chains \"for drawing up water, wood, etc. either by Cranes or Windlasses.\": 152 \n\n\n== Garrison ==\nOn January 8, 1759, Colonel Mercer reported to Governor William Denny that he had a garrison of about 280 men, and that the \"works\" were capable of some defense. On March 17, 1759, the garrison totaled 428 men: 10 commissioned officers, 18 non-commissioned officers, 3 drummers, 346 rank and file, fit for duty, 79 sick, and three unaccounted for. Twelve had died since the 1st of January. Separate units included: Royal Artillery, 8; Royal Americans, 20; Highlanders, 80; Virginia Regiment, 99; First Pennsylvania Battalion, 136; Second Pennsylvania Battalion, 85. By December 1759, the garrison consisted of 300 Pennsylvania and Virginia militia and 400 Pennsylvania infantry, plus 21 officers.\n\n\n== Military history ==\nThe fort was never attacked, but in June 1759 Colonel Mercer learned that a French force of 700 troops, 800 Native American warriors, and some artillery was advancing with plans to attack Mercer's Fort and Fort Ligonier.: 67, 190  The French were only a day's march from Pittsburgh when the attack was aborted, as the French forces were diverted when British troops arrived to attack Fort Niagara, in what would become the Battle of Fort Niagara.: 14 \n\n\n== Dismantling, 1760 ==\nAs fighting diminished towards the end of the French and Indian War, Mercer's Fort was used less for defense and more as housing for workers and to store supplies until mid-1760, when work on Fort Pitt had progressed to the point where the older fort was no longer necessary. It was dismantled, with the wood recycled for use in other construction. In October 1762, Indian trader James Kenny noted the changes as the older outbuildings were razed or converted: \"Where two years ago I had seen all ye Houses that were without ye Little Fort they had then, thrown down, only one [the Indian conference house] which stands yet, also two that was within that little fort...being ye Hospital now.\": 28 \n\n\n== See also ==\nFort Pitt (Pennsylvania)\nFort Prince George\nFrench and Indian War\nHugh Mercer\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nArtist's rendition of Mercer's Fort soon after its completion, p. 15.

        "content": "On March 27, 2024, four people were killed and seven others were injured in a mass stabbing in Rockford, Illinois, with the fatalities entailing two men, a woman, and a 15-year-old girl. A suspect, 22-year-old Christian Ivan Soto, of Rockford, was taken into custody and charged with several counts of first-degree murder and home invasion.\n\n\n== Attacks ==\nDuring an interview following his arrest, Soto told police that he was friends with one of the victims, a 23-year-old man named Jacob D. Schupbach, and that he had gone to Schupbach's house to smoke marijuana. According to Soto, he became paranoid that the drugs Schupbach gave him were laced with an unknown narcotic, after which he retrieved a knife from the kitchen and fatally stabbed Schupbach, along with his 63-year-old mother, Ramona. Witnesses also reported seeing Soto enter a vehicle and run over Jacob Schupbach before following him back into the house.\nAfter exiting the home, Soto fatally stabbed Jay P. Larson, a 49-year-old postal worker, whom Soto also ran over as he fled in his pickup truck. He then injured three people at another residence, all of whom were released after being treated for non-life-threatening injuries.\nSoto then entered the unlocked back door of another residence, where three girls had been watching movies in the basement. After asking the girls \"where the gun was\", Soto attacked all three of them with a softball bat he had retrieved from the kitchen. One of the girls, 15-year-old Jenna A. Newcomb, was fatally injured before Soto eventually fled the home. According to Newcomb's mother, she died protecting her sister and friend from further harm.\nThe attacks continued in another part of Winnebago County, where Soto allegedly broke into a woman's home and attacked her, as well as a man who had been driving by and stopped to intervene, with a knife. As Soto began attacking the man, police arrived and took him into custody.\n\n\n== Victims ==\nFour people, including a 15-year-old girl and a postal worker, were killed in the attacks, while seven others were injured. The victims were identified as 23-year-old Jacob D. Schupbach, 63-year-old Ramona L. Schupbach, 49-year-old Jay P. Larson, and 15-year-old Jenna A. Newcomb.\n\n\n== Accused ==\nThe suspect in the attacks, 22-year-old Christian Ivan Soto, had several traffic violations, with one incident in 2022 resulting in Soto receiving a sentence of six months of supervision. Soto was also charged with damage to property in September 2022.\nFollowing the attacks, Soto was charged with four counts of first-degree murder, seven counts of attempted first-degree murder, and two counts of home invasion. Soto faces up to 60 years in prison on each count of first-degree murder and attempted first-degree murder, as well as up to 30 years in prison for each count of home invasion.\nDuring a court hearing on April 2, Soto disrupted the proceedings with a verbal outburst in which he loudly exclaimed \"Only God can judge me\" and called those present \"puppets\" and \"serpents\".\n\n\n== Reactions ==\nIn a statement released the day after the attacks, President Joe Biden stated that he and first lady Jill Biden were \"horrified to learn of the brutal attack carried out in Rockford last night.\" Biden further stated that they were \"praying for the families of those who lost loved ones, and hoping that all those injured make a full recovery\", expressed gratitude \"for the heroic actions of local law enforcement, who confronted the suspect and prevented the loss of more innocent life\", and pledged that his administration \"will do everything in its power to help the people of Rockford and the broader community recover from this traumatic event.\"\nU.S. representative Eric Sorensen, whose district covers Rockford, stated in a Twitter post that he was \"grateful for quick actions of our police who were able to catch the suspect and prevent additional harm to our neighbors in Rockford.\"\nRockford's mayor, Tom McNamara, described the attacks as a \"random and senseless act of violence\" and stated that his heart was \"breaking for those who have lost their lives, their families and our community\".\n\n\n== References ==",

AVA events have also been held in Holland, Great Britain, and India.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe festival was founded in 2015 by Sarah McBriar, brother of Matthew McBriar of Bicep, who following attending the Glastonbury Festival had wanted to bring a similar event to Belfast. The name AVA was derived as an acronym for Audio, Visual, and Arts.  While the inaugural event was in Belfast in 2015, the festival has also been held in Mumbai, Amsterdam, Glasgow and London. The initial event had c. 1,500 attendees for a one-day event, which by 2022 had increased in time-span to be a weekend event with c. 16,000 attendees.  In 2018 the event was held in an \"old B&Q warehouse\", the 2020 event was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2021 the event was held at the Boucher Road Playing Fields in Belfast, and in 2022 AVA was held at the Titanic Slipway also in Belfast.The event typically has performances from electronic dance music acts, which include both local \"homegrown\" and more internationally recognised musicians. Artists that have played at AVA include Holly Lester, Larry Heard, LSDXOXO, Orbital, and Bicep. The festival also includes talk and lectures. AVA has been described in the music press as \"one of the world's most exciting electronic festivals\", and has been credited as creating a \"second age of rave\" in Northern Ireland.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of electronic music festivals\n\n\n== External links ==\navafestival.com",

He perhaps wrote in pre-Hellenistic times.\nThe writer Servius the Grammarian in his commentaries on Virgil's Aeneid confuses this Artemon with the engineer of the same name. This confusion persists to the present day, and many writers still refer to the Spartan engineer as \"Artemon of Clazomenae\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Schmitz, Leonhard (1870). \"Artemon (2)\".

        "content": "The Assault on Osu (Danish: Angrebet på Orsu) was an assault on the coastal village of Osu Castle by the Kingdom of Akwamu against local Accrans, who received support from the Danes at Fort Christiansborg. The assault resulted in military failure for the Akwamu, mainly due to Danish artillery, and the Akwamu were forced to retreat.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe Akwamu State began its formation of an empire in the latter half of the seventeenth century. The empire's primary expansion route was eastwards, which made it come into confrontations with various local tribes, in witch most cases got obsorbed or subjegated by the Akwamu. It seems clear that the Akwamu State had extended its dominion to the area of modern-day Akwapim by the middle of the seventeenth century.\nAt the arrival of the Europeans, Great Accra was the strongest power in the region. This is examplified in the 1670s, when King Okaikoi was able to summon a nine thousand strong army, which no European fortification could pose a challenge against. This meant that if any European nation came in conflict with the Great Accra, it would diverse the lucrative Atlantic slave trade to the other European nations also present in the area. Such threat posed by the Great Accra, led to constant attempts by the Europeans to befriend the African Kingdom.\n\n\n=== Weakening of Accra ===\n\nAkwamu naturally turned its attention to the he lucrative trade market between Accra and the Europeans. The initial Akwamu policy appears to be, to achieving control of the trade routes leading from the interior to the coast, which would guarantee a substantial amount of money from tolls.\nIn 1646, Accra attacked Larteh. In response, Akwamu blockaded Accra and the trading routes controlled by Akwamu were sealed. This led to serious damage on the Accran economy. This, together with an ongoing civil war, would guarantee the ultimate collapse of Accra, yet this would only be shown sound 30 years later.\nAkwamu launched it's major offensive against Accra in 1677, under king Ansa Sasraku II. The initial offensive was directed at Great Accra, the capital city. The Accra king, Okaikoi I, offered resistance, but was captured and beheaded with his eldest son. Additionally, Great Accra was sacked and burned.\n\n\n== Assault ==\n\n\n=== Ofori I's strategy ===\nAccran resistance was not over with the loss of their capital, however. A young son of Okaikoi named Ofori, had escaped the sack of Great Accra, moving the state capital to Little Accra and assumed leadership succeeding his beheaded father. Ofori sought the assistance of the Danes, Dutch and English in holding back further Akwanu expansion on the coast. By this time Accran towns had already started to grow around each of the European forts. These towns must have received a sizeable number of refugees from Great Accra. It is likely that Akwamu hesitated to launch attacks upon the Accran coastal towns.\nOne of these Accran towns which got attacked, were Osu, which was located in close proximity to the Danish fort and capital of the Danish Gold Coast, Christiansborg. In 1678, the Akwamu State's warrior army launched an attack on Osu as a part of their campaign against Accra. The close and compacted warriors must have been an easy target for the cannons at Christiansborg Castle. In any case, the Akwamu army was forced to retreat because of the heavy fire dealt by the Danish artillery, and abandon their attack on Osu.\nSince the Danes had forced the Akwamu armies to retreat from Osu, it may be supposed that as long as the Danes at Christiansborg and the Accrans at Osu, could pose and constitute a Hostile left flank for the Akwamu, for as long would the Akwamu not make any significant threat of a frontal attack on Small Accra itself. This became reality when King Ansa Sasraku, the following year, directed a part of his war force to conqour the Kingdom of Ladoku.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\nIn the same year as the conquest of Ladoku, the Danish garrison at Fort Christiansborg was discontented in a revolt, led by Pieter Bolt. He mutanied and seized the fort, quickly selling it to the Portuguese governor of St. Tomé, Julião de Campos Barreto.\nNo actual evidence supports the involvement of Akwamu in the mutiny at Fort Christiansborg, yet they certainly welcomed the regime change. The Portuguese takeover led Ansa Sasraku to once more turn his attention to Little Accra. Some sources say that the war between the Akwamu and Accras continued, now taking place near the European fortifications. This resulted in the burning of Little Accra, and Ofori I fled for the second time, now to Afutu, where he was welcomed by the king, Ahen Panyin Ashríve as king-in-exile. Furthermore, the Danes now had their headquarters in Afutu at Fort Frederiksborg. The Danish governor, Magnus Prang, and Ofori both had interests in regaining their Accran possessions, and agreed to afford each other every assistance.\nIn 1682 the Portuguese garrison revolted and imprisoned Julião de Campos, and the following year the king of Portugal, Afonso VI, ordered the evacuation of the fort. The Danes in response, reoccupied the fort, and withdrew their alliance with Ofori in order not to further antagonize the Akwamu.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSagbadre War – 1784 Danish punitive expedition in Gold Coast\nDano-Dutch War – War between the Dutch and Danish, 1661–1665\nKing Okaikoi – King OkaiKoi was a warrior king who formed the Akwashong,supreme military command,which provided the basis of renewal of Ga-Dangme military powerPages displaying wikidata descriptions as a fallback\nAshanti Empire – Former Akan empire centred on present-day Ghana\nSiege of Dansborg (1644) – Siege in Tranquebar, India 1644\n\n\n== Notelist ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Krisean Lopez (born 2 November 1998) is a Belizean association footballer who currently plays for Premier League of Belize club Verdes FC and the Belize national team.\n\n\n== Club career ==\nFollowing the 2017–18 Opening Season, Lopez was named the league's best new young player as part of Wagiya FC. Prior to the start of the Closing Season, he moved to league rivals Verdes FC.\nLopez traveled to the United States to spend pre-season with Indy Eleven of the USL Championship. In April 2021, he returned to the country to trial with EFA Metro of the United Premier Soccer League despite being under contract with Verdes FC until June 2022. Although he went with the approval of the club and the club would support a transfer beneficial to Lopez's development, Verdes FC was unhappy about how former national team head coach Richard Orlowski contacted the players directly. In December of that year, Lopez won the league's most valuable player award as the league's joint top goal scorer.\nLopez went out on loan from Verdes FC in December 2022, joining C.D. Platense of El Salvador's Primera División. Platense became interested in the player after the club played Verdes in the 2022 CONCACAF League. Lopez made his debut for Platense in a pre-season friendly against Juventud Independiente in early January 2023. In total, he played six pre-season matches for the club and missed another through injury. He would miss the opening match of the Clausura 2023 because his transfer paperwork was delayed. Lopez was eventually cleared to play in the club's second match. He went on to make his official league debut on 3 February 2023 against C.D. Luis Ángel Firpo. He scored his first goal for the club in a 3–2 victory over Atlético Marte on 26 February.\n\n\n== International career ==\nLopez made his senior international debut on 3 June 2018 in a 0–0 draw away to Barbados.\n\n\n=== International goals ===\nScores and results list Belize's goal tally first.\n\n\n=== International career statistics ===\nAs of match played 24 March 2024.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKrisean Lopez at National-Football-Teams.com\nKrisean Lopez at Soccerway\nKrisean Lopez at Global Sports Archive",

The revenue split is 60% commercial and 40% military.\nServices offered by the division include aircraft maintenance, converting aircraft to freighters, parts distribution, and developing technology. However, despite the company's financial success, it has also faced frustration from customers in its parts business in response to long lead times and increased prices for parts.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "The Wheelchair State Challenge is an annual wheelchair rugby league fixture between the Australian state representative sides of New South Wales and Queensland. First played in 2015 as the Wheelchair Interstate Challenge, the competition was rebranded as the Wheelchair State of Origin in 2019, and as the Wheelchair State Challenge in 2023.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Establishment of wheelchair rugby league ===\nWheelchair rugby league was developed in France in 2000 and introduced to Australia by a touring French team in 2004. Interest in the sport increased when the first World Cup was held in Sydney in November 2008 and in December 2009 it was announced that a wheelchair rugby league competition would be launched in New South Wales. The sport continued to develop in the Sydney area and the Australian Wheelchair Rugby League had grown to eight teams by 2014 when exhibition matches and events were first held in Queensland as part of an effort to expand the game within Australia.\n\n\n=== Wheelchair Interstate Challenge (2015–2018) ===\nThe inaugural interstate competition took place at the Eagles Sports Complex, Mansfield, on 2 July 2015 with New South Wales winning 49–4 in a one-off match. It was proposed that the competition could be expanded into a three-match series. In 2016, the challenge was played as a two-match series at the Sleeman Sports Complex in Brisbane on the weekend before Game II of the 2016 State of Origin series. New South Wales won 84–0 and 90–6 for a 2–0 series win. The same venue and format was used in June 2017 as New South Wales remained unbeaten to retain their title. In 2018, the challenge reverted to a single-match format and was won 54–18 by New South Wales. It was played at the Quaycentre, Sydney Olympic Park, on the same day as Game II of the 2018 State of Origin series at the nearby ANZ Stadium.\n\n\n=== Wheelchair State of Origin (2019–2022) ===\nIn 2019, the match was played under the State of Origin name. On 6 July, New South Wales won 52–4 in front of an estimated crowd of 1,000 at the Quaycentre. The competition was cancelled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the June 2021 fixture was postponed until January 2022 when it was played without spectators at the Whitlam Centre, Liverpool. Queensland claimed the title for the first time with a 50–30 win. In July 2022, Queensland retained the title with a 49–24 win at the Townsville Stadium.\n\n\n=== Wheelchair State Challenge (2023–present) ===\nThe competition was rebranded as the Wheelchair State Challenge in 2023. The 2023 match was scheduled to take place at the Quaycentre but this was changed in June when the venue became unavailable. On 8 July, Queensland won their third successive title with a 42–26 victory at the Whitlam Leisure Centre.\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNRL Wheelchair\nNRL",

As a result, theoretically a maximum of 68 teams could enter the tournament – although this level has never been reached.\nFor the 2024–25 CAF Champions League, the CAF uses the 2019–2023 CAF 5-Year Ranking, which calculates points for each entrant association based on their clubs’ performance over those 5 years in the CAF Champions League and CAF Confederation Cup. The criteria for points are the following:\n\nThe points are multiplied by a coefficient according to the year as follows:\n\n2023–24: × 5\n2022–23: × 4\n2021–22: × 3\n2020–21: × 2\n2019–20: × 1\n\n\n== Teams ==\nThe following 66 teams from 54 associations entered the competition.\n\nTeams in\nBold received a bye to the second round.\nThe other teams entered the first round.\nAssociations are shown according to their 2018–2023 CAF 5-Year Ranking – those with a ranking score have their rank and score (in parentheses) indicated.\n\n\n== Schedule ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n2024–25 CAF Confederation Cup\n2025 CAF Super Cup\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCAFonline.com",

        "content": "Sholan (died 1654) (also known as Nashawhonan, Nashoonan, Shawanon, and Showanon) was the leader (sachem) of the Nashaway tribe who lived on small hill between the two Waushacum Lakes in what is now Sterling, Massachusetts.Bypassing Willard's trading post in Concord, Sholan often visited Thomas King's trading post at Watertown to sell pelts, and developed a friendship with King. In 1641 or 1642 Sholan recommended that King move to the Nashua Valley, likely to make it easier for the Nashaway to transport goods and to protect the Nashaway's position from encroachment by others. In 1643 Sholan sold King and others in the Nashway Company an eighty-mile square tract of land, which became the towns of Lancaster, Berlin, Boylston, Bolton, Sterling, Clinton, and Harvard.\nSholan and several other Nashaway were also remembered for escorting John Eliot on one of his journeys in 1648 Eliot wrote a letter to Edward Winslow stating:\"Shawanon the great Sachym of Nashawog doth embrace the Gospel, and pray unto God. I have been foure times there this Summer, and there be more people by far, then be amongst us; and sundry of them do gladly hear the word of God, but it is neer 40 miles off, and I can but seldom goe to them; where at they are troubled, and desire I should come oftner, and stay longer when I come.\"  Sholan died in October 1654 and was succeeded in office by his nephew Matthew who was chosen after the tribe was advised to do so by John Eliot as encouraged by the Massachusetts authorities, instead of a rival (possibly Shoshanin) who was prone to intoxication. Prior to 1675 Matthew died and was succeeded by Shoshanin who supported Metacomet, also known as King Philip. Sholan was also survived by a nephew, George Tahanto, who deeded further land grants to settlers in the area in 1701.Sholan's name is remembered various local landmarks including Sholan Park on Lake Waushacum in Sterling, Sholan Circle in Harvard, and Sholan Farms in Leominster\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Interreligious studies, sometimes called interfaith studies, is an interdisciplinary academic field that researches and teaches about interfaith dialogue and encounters between religions. It often involves religious scholars in interfaith activism. This concept has injected itself as not entirely interfaith dialogue; which is more often religious than academic in nature. The field emerged in the 1980s and 1990s, as a result of the collective efforts of theologians and interfaith practitioners (partly from scholars), during a period of interfaith activism, especially in the North America.\n\n\n== History of the field ==\nThe academic field emerged from pioneering scholarship on religious diversity. In 1991, Harvard ProfessorDiana L. Eck started engaging students in research, which later became the Pluralism Project at Harvard University. Robert Wuthnow and Robert D. Putnam were among the scholars who investigated religious diversity and interactions. In 2013, there were several academic initiatives, including the founding of the Interfaith and Interreligious Studies Group at the American Academy of Religion, Office of Religion and Global Affairs at the United States Department of State, and a call for an interfaith studies field was published by Eboo Patel, founder of Interfaith Youth Core, who subsequently helped the funding of academic programs at U.S. universities. \nBy 2018, institutional growth of the field included 20 undergraduate programs with majors, minors, or certificates; four universities or seminaries with tenure track faculty positions; and 22 centers with an interfaith focus. Academic journals include the Journal of Interreligious Studies and Interreligious Studies and Intercultural Theology. In 2017, Jennifer Howe Peace founded the Association for Interreligious / Interfaith Studies (AIIS), which convened annual meetings through 2023 and collaborated with the European Society for Intercultural Theology and Interreligious Studies (ESITIS). In 2021, the Center for the Study of Religious and Interreligious Dynamics was launched by the Israeli Tel Aviv University and the German Goethe-Institut.\nBy 2023, at least 47 empirical studies had been conducted on interfaith initiatives. Twenty-seven studies were from the U.S. and eight from Europe. A review of this research found that  \"interfaith initiatives can positively impact participants’ knowledge about other worldviews, communication skills and appreciation for other worldviews. At the same time, it can be challenging for interfaith initiatives to positively impact participants’ knowledge of socio-political challenges, awareness of power imbalance and privilege and behaviour as interfaith leaders.\"\n\n\n== Definition ==\n Heidelberg University said, \"Interreligious Studies addresses the increasing societal and economic need for interreligious competence. Courses provide students with a comprehensive appreciation of issues which impact or inhibit the peaceful co-existence of varied religions, and equip students with an understanding of how interreligious understanding might be achieved.\"\n\n\n== Historical precursors ==\nInterreligious studies was grounded on a century long shift in theology and religious activities. As a prelude to pluralism; for example when Christian missionaries formulated the belief that Christianity could help \"fulfill\" Islam, and thus, later led to a broader ecumenical approach. Another step were the multi-faith dialogues in such events as the Parliament of the World's Religions, first held in 1893.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nAs an academic field, interreligious studies has been criticized about the involvement of practitioners and advocates of interfaith dialogue. Some scholars say there is insufficient \"skeptical detachment\" from religiosity and, as noted in a 2016 New York Times article, \"Many professors of religious studies bridle at the new field’s orientation toward real-world application rather than pure scholarship.\" \nA notable practitioner, Alon Goshen-Gottstein, acknowledged that academic work in interreligious studies may reveal \"the interests of those who engage in it by studying and appreciating, but more importantly, advancing the field of interreligious dialogue through relevant studies.\" He mentioned connections to the more faith-based endeavors of Comparative theology and Theology of religions.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==",

        "content": "Darius Jauniškis (born 14 January 1968) is a Lithuanian officer, serving as Director General of the State Security Department of Lithuania since 2015.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nJauniškis was born in Vilnius, Lithuania. He graduated from Vilnius Pedagogical Institute in 2005 with a degree in economics, and then studied at the Baltic Defence College in Tartu in 2006 before studying at the United States Army War College in Pennsylvania, USA. He then received a master's degree in strategic studies from the University of Washington.\nBetween 1990 and 1993, Jauniškis worked in the security department of the Supreme Council – Reconstituent Seimas, and worked in several ministries between 1993 and 1995 before serving in the special purpose service of the Special Operations Forces. Between 1997 and 2006 he was the deputy commander of the SPS, and later commander between 2006 and 2008. He was then promoted to commander of the SOF between 2008 and 2015. During his time as a soldier, he participated in several missions in Afghanistan.\nOn 13 April 2015, he was appointed as the Director of the State Security Department of Lithuania, and was appointed for the role again in 2020. Jauniškis has taken preventative measures against Russian espionage and activity in the country since 2015, being extremely public with statements calling for civilians to be more aware of Russian espionage attempts in the country. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Jauniškis was ranked as one of the most influential figures in Lithuania. In 2023, Jauniškis stated that Belarusian espionage in Lithuania was at \"an all-time high\". He cited the intensification in espionage was due to Russia's frustration with a longer war in Ukraine and high number of Belarusian immigrants.\nIn March 2024, Jauniškis accused Russia of targeting Russian dissident Leonid Volkov, who was attacked in Lithuania. Later that month, Jauniškis was implicated in a scandal after reports emerged of the State Security Department spying on President Gitanas Nausėda's voter base, possibly assisting him in his campaign for election.\n\n\n== References ==",

He had already staged a number of operas at the prestigious Teatro di San Carlo including Margherita d'Aragona (1844) with the soprano Fanny Goldberg, the tenor Gaetano Fraschini and the baritone Filippo Coletti. His opera  Rosvina de la Forest (1845) was commissioned by La Scala in Milan.\n\nTo a libretto in Italian by Domenico Bolognese (1919–1891) he composed the score for Ermelinda (1851), which in turn was based on Hugo's 1831 novel The Hunchback of Notre-Dame.\nThe opera opened as Esmeralda at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane on 30 June 1856 under the musical direction of J.

He became a success on Australian radio, with over 60 singles being credited to him, and was \"spotted\" by Ray Martin after Martin heard him sing on a demo disc - Martin did not like the song, but did like the voice.  Therefore, Parkinson moved to Britain in September 1955, and landed a deal with Columbia Records, with his first single - \"All At Once\" - being released in November.\nHe had three hit singles, all coming in 1956, the biggest of them being his cover of \"The Great Pretender\", which made the top ten in two of the three national charts at the time (New Musical Express, Melody Maker, and Record Mirror).\nHe returned to Australia in 1957, and became a presenter, hosting Your Hit Parade on the 9 Network from 1957 to 1959, and The Jimmy Parkinson Show on Sydney television station ATN-7 in 1958.  His television career continued into the 1960s.\nParkinson died in Eastlakes, New South Wales, in 2019, survived by his son Jason.\n\n\n== Charting singles ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Goodenia daviesii, commonly known as hairy velleia, is a species of flowering plant in the Goodeniaceae family and is endemic to inland areas of Western Australia. It is an annual herb with lyre-shaped, pinnatifid leaves and lilac to white flowers.\n\n\n== Description ==\nGoodenia daviesii is a softly-hairy, yellowish annual herb. The leaves are lance-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, lyre-shaped pinnatifid, and up to 20–70 mm (0.79–2.76 in) long and 10–30 mm (0.39–1.18 in) wide. The flowers are borne on an erect flowering stem 200–400 mm (7.9–15.7 in) high with leaf-like bracteoles, the lower ones up to 40 mm (1.6 in) long. The sepals are joined at the base to form a short tube, the lower lobes up to 10 mm (0.39 in) long. The petals are lilac to white, up to 20 mm (0.79 in) long. Flowering mainly occurs from August to December and the capsule is oval and contains more or less speherical seeds about 4 mm (0.16 in) in diameter.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThis species was first formally described in 1876 by Ferdinand von Mueller who gave it the name Velleia daviesii in his Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae, from a specimen collected by Jess Young \"near Ularing\". In 2020, Kelly Anne Shepherd and others transferred it to the genus Goodenia, based on  nuclear, chloroplast and mitochondrial data. The specific epithet (daviesii) honours Charles Davies.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nGoodenia daviesii grows in scrub and steppe grassland in the Coolgardie, Great Sandy Desert and Murchison bioregions of inland Western Australia.\n\n\n== Conservation status ==\nHairy velleia is listed as \"not threatened\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Cabinet of Todor Burmov is the First government of the Principality of Bulgaria, appointed by Alexander I of Battenberg. Burmov was a close associate of Alexander of Bulgaria and so was chosen as the Prime Minister of the newly independent country on 5 July 1879 despite the relatively weak position of the Conservative party. The cabinet was tasked with organizing and holding elections for the First National Assembly of Bulgaria, which took place in September 1879. \nThe fall of the cabinet was due to the narrow social base of the Conservative party and to some unpopular financial measures, including: raising the salt tax, dropping the exchange rate of the silver ruble and others.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nBurmov's cabinet comleted the structuring of the central and local administration bodies inherited from the Provisional Russian Government. Contrary to the stipulations of the Berlin Treaty, it continued its efforts to create a regular army instead of armed militia. The cabinet established customs on the southern border, however all goods with areas of origin in Eastern Rumelia or Macedonia were exempted from custom duties. The Foreign ministry saw the establishment of diplomatic relations with neighbouring countries and the Great powers.\nThe government of Burmov was under strong Russian influence. It was put together by Alexander I on the orders of the Russian diplomatic representative in Sofia. After the elections for National Assembly in October, all decisions on the matter of domestic pollitic were dictated by the opinion of Tsar Alexander II. However the Cabinet did not succumb to the lobbying of Russian bankers and military circles to turn the Bulgarian National Bank into a joint stock company and to run a railway line from Sofia to the Danube instead of running it from Sofia to Vienna.\nJustice Minister Dimitar Grekov set up joint commissions to resolve property disputes between returning Turkish expatriates and Bulgarians who occupied the vacated lands, but the issue has not been resolved during the short term of the cabinet. Domestically, the government was forced to contend with the Turkish bands that lingered long after the end of the Russo-Turkish war in the regions of Eski Cuma and Osman Pazar. The Cabinet's main political oponnent was the Liberal Party, which won the National election in September 1879 and overthrew Burmov and his ministers after successful vote of no confidence in November 1879.\n\n\n== Cabinet ==\nThe cabinet was made up of members of the Conservative Party, which reflected the interests of a small stratum of the merchant-bourgeoisie, and a Russian general at the head of the War Ministry. The Conservative party's leadership core includes political figures with a European upbringing and culture.\n\nThe Council of Ministers is formed by 4 ministers and one Prime Minister\n\n\n=== 26th of July 1879 ===\n\n\n== Events ==\n10 July 1879 – The government imposes martial law in Varna and parts of the neighbouring provinces to deal with Turkish unrest.\n19 July 1879 – The first Bulgarian diplomatic agents are appointed. They are accredited in Serbia, Romania and the Ottoman Empire.\nAugust 1879 – The Telegraph-Postal and Road-Building Departments of the Ministry of the Interior are established.\n14 August 1879 – the political office of Knyaz Alexander Battenberg was established, Konstantin Stoilov was appointed political secretary.\nSeptember 1879 – national elections for the 1st National Assembly, won by the Liberal party.\n24 November 1879 – The Bulgarian Knyaz dissolves the National Assembly and appoints a  new conservative cabinet headed by Bishop Kliment of Tarnovo.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The battle of Areich Hind, also known as the Battle of Raz el-Ma, took place between September 17 and 19, 2010, during the Islamist insurgency in the Sahel. Mauritanian forces launched an offensive against a group of AQIM jihadists in Malian territory on September 17.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn the months prior to the battle of Areich Hind, jihadists from Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb had been expanding into Mali's desolate Tombouctou Region. Mauritanian and Malian forces had launched a raid into the region in July 2010, near the town of Akla, to eliminate an AQIM camp. The raid destroyed the camp, but AQIM militants executed the French hostage Michel Germaneau shortly afterward.\n\n\n== Battle ==\nOn September 17, Mauritanian forces ambushed a convoy of around twenty AQIM vehicles headed towards the Malian border. The AQIM vehicles belonged to Djamel Okacha's katiba, and consisted of around 150 men. A confrontation broke out between the two forces in Raz El Ma and Areich Hind, near Hassisidi. The fighting continued until the morning of September 18. AQIM claimed in a press release that a small number of French forces fought alongside the Mauritanians, but French authorities denied the allegations.\nOn September 18, the Mauritanian Army stated six soldiers and twelve jihadists were killed. In the days that followed, two Mauritanian soldiers died of their wounds. A Mauritanian security source also stated that six suspected AQIM members were taken prisoner. \nMauritanian planes bombed AQIM vehicles in the area of Areich Hind on September 19. However, a woman and a girl were killed, and three to four other civilians were injured. AQIM claimed the victims of the bombings were civilians, while the Mauritanian army stated that several jihadists were killed in the raid. The Mauritanian government acknowledged the death of the woman, but claimed she was a jihadist.\nAQIM also claimed the deaths of nineteen Mauritanian soldiers, and that AQIM inflicted a \"crushing defeat\" on the soldiers. They also claimed dozens of soldiers were injured, several vehicles destroyed and captured, and only one jihadist killed. An Algerian security source stated fifteen Mauritanian soldiers were killed in the battle.\n\n\n== References ==",

I hope history has an answer for that.\"\n\n\n=== Meeting with Ahmad Montazeri ===\nAs a member of the Azadi Front, he published a photo of his meeting with Ahmad Montazeri on his Instagram page and addressed Ayatollah Montazeri's efforts to welcome the leader of Iran and said:\"In the year 2000, that is, three years after the harsh speech of the 13th of Rajab, which led to harsh actions against them, the leadership decided to come to Qom.! At the same time when Iraq was under severe pressure from the international community, Mr. Montazeri said that he wanted to meet Mr. Khamenei... The arrival of Mr. Khamenei in Qom is very important and the world powers are watching this meeting. If they find out that the leadership isn't approved by the authority community, they will make sinister plans for Islamic Iran and its disintegration. When they came to the Iraq war with all their strength, the analysis of Iran was definitely on their agenda, and to thwart their plans, Setting aside differences. And he went to meet him so that he Knows that despite all the differences and criticisms, he has a place among the people and authorities, and if an evil eye falls on this revolution, We will set aside differences and stand together.\"\n\n\n== Artistic activity ==\n\nIn 2021, Loghman Madayen officially turned to Write art, and cinematographic articles and poetry as a critic, and His work was were quickly reflected in Ensaf News, Rokna, IRNA, Ilna, Salam Cinema and Etemad and Keyhan newspapers.\nHis reviews include a thorough analysis of the film's content Besides strict belief In each of the parameters of form and technique.

It has only one meaning, that is, the shrine of Razavi is ignorant in taking possession of these religious facades.\n\n\n=== The Case is Open Movie ===\nLoghman Madayen  considered the last work of Kiumars Pourahmad to be very weak and wrote it : \"Pourahmad introduces the judicial system as the flag bearer of the campaign against execution, talks about the weakness of the law in equal rights of men and women and domestic violence...\"\n\n\n=== Expediency Movie ===\nMadayen said in a conversation with Etemad newspaper:\"Film came to say that it is possible to oppress in the Islamic Republic like Savak, Film came to complain about those who are willing to kill innocent people to hide their weakness, Film came to say that it is possible to obtain a fake death certificate from an official level so that the cause of death is not revealed.\"\n\n\n=== Alafzar Movie ===\nIn a conversation with Insaf News Agency, Loghman Madayen criticized the ruthless censorship of the film and said:\"The film has suffered a lot because of the critics, but it still has its firmness , On the one hand, it depicts the attempt of some politicians to influence the judicial system, on the other hand, it exposes the corruption of some in the judiciary, Just like what happened in recent years, from the judge and prosecutor to the deputy and director general in the department were arrested, The film deals with the buying and selling of children...\"\n\n\n=== No Choice Movie ===\nIn a conversation with Ensaf News Agency, Madayenconsidered the hero of the film to be similar to Nasrin Sotoudeh and said:\"Sara's white shawl reminds us of Azadeh's lawyer with her always white shawl, namely Nasrin Sotoudeh, who expressed her dignity as a lawyer, \"When they do not allow me to defend the rights of my clients, I Prefer to try with them\", Finally, he Was capture, Golbahar fingered Sarah's attorney document at the very beginning and We saw the human rights book of Mohammad Ja'far Pouyandeh, And

Madayen called the film the final chapter on Mohsen Rezaee and said:\"It was reported that they were the leadership of the president and they were surprised to hear the news of Mir Hossein Mousavi becoming the prime minister on the two o'clock news, They complained without controversy, some elders went to Ayatollah Khomeini and said that you should not have allowed Mousavi to become the prime minister, It is the president's right to choose her prime minister, And Ayatollah Khomeini makes a deep speech there and says: \"They came from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and said that if Mousavi does not become the prime minister, The war is over\", Or they are right the war will fail, which we should not let, Or it is a threat and they harm the war, which is not good, This is a naked narrative that, if it is true, depicts the depth of Mohsen Rezaee's power display..\"\n\n\n=== Killer Spider Movie ===\nIn a conversation with Ensaf News Agency, Madayen considered the film very important and said: \"Spider\" should be seen both by religious fanatics and those who have lost their religion:\"The traditional religious spectrum should watch to understand what the consequences of the rulings they promote on the pulpits without any support can bring about, By the way, Mr. Sayyid Ahmad Alamolhoda should watch the movie carefully and not prevent it from showing in Mashhad, Apostates like Masih Alinejad should also watch this work to understand that early cultural development in the country is not possible and all members of the society should develop uniformly, Iran has been a prisoner of cultural dogmatism for centuries and it will take a long time for everyone to turn to wisdom, Otherwise, if the cultural distance increases, people will kill for the reward of others.\"\n\n\n=== World War III Movie ===\nIn a conversation with Etemad newspaper, Loghman Madayen said that this film reflects the anger of defenseless people:\"Who incites violence, how an explosion turns people's loved ones who had a lot of love in their hearts into ashes, and those who caused the explosion, instead of responding by abusing their power, do not bear the burden of responsibility, the suffering people who The authorities don't want to hear their voices and they deal with them however they want, the film deals with mutual violence, from a justice system that doesn't exist, from a Dadi who is not allowed to cry out.\"\n\n\n=== Leila's Brothers Movie ===\nIn a conversation with Etemad newspaper, Madayen considered the film very important for the inflamed society and said:\"The film revolves around a father whose character is a symbol of tyranny, exclusivity, totalitarianism, and dictatorship. He is full of selfishness in the family, and his strength is the blessing of the silence of the family members who let this rotten traditional thinking decide for them as it wants.\"\n\n\n== Poems ==\nSince 2018, Loghman Madayen published his literary, romantic, mystical and political poems and texts.

        "content": "George W. Munroe (1857 – January 29, 1932) was an American actor and comedian who specialized in female impersonation. He was actively performing in American theaters from the 1880s into the early 1920s. He performed in both Broadway shows and in vaudeville. He was best known for his comic portrayals of gossipy old Irish women.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nGeorge W. Munroe was born in Philadelphia and began his career in that city as a member of the Wheatley Dramatic Association. He joined the touring theater company of actor George S. Knight (1850–1892), making his debut as Bridget, an Irish woman, in Over the Garden Wall at the Chestnut Street Opera House (built 1870 as Fox's American Theatre) on September 1, 1884. The production then went on tour eventually arriving at Broadway's Union Square Theatre in January 1885. Munroe was still in the cast when it moved to the Fifth Avenue Theatre in March 1885.\n\nIn placing Munroe's career within the context of the broader history of drag during the 19th century, Laurence Senelick, writing in The Cambridge Guide to American Theatre, stated thatPuritans had attacked as 'sodomitical' the Elizabethan convention of boys playing girls, and it disappeared with the Restoration; but the accompanying tradition of the \"dame\" role – an elderly woman impersonated by a male comedian – survived on the American stage, carried on by Neil Burgess as the Widow Bedotte, George W. Munroe as various Irish biddies, Gilbert Sarony as Giddy Gusher, and the Russell Brothers as clumsy Irish maids.\nMunroe developed a partnership with comedian and fellow Philadelphian John C. Rice; an actor who had also had a comic role in Over the Garden Wall. They capitalized on the success of Munroe's Irish female character from that play, and repurposed it into a new play written by Scott Marble entitled My Aunt Bridget with Munroe as the title character. It premiered in Kansas City, Missouri, in 1886. Munroe and Rice toured this play throughout the United States in vaudeville theaters in the latter half of the 1880s. A second play followed this work, Aunt Bridget's Baby, which debuted at the Park Theatre in Boston in January 1891. The actor Andrew Mack became part of the Munroe and Rice team, and they continued to perform plays led by Munroe as Bridget through 1898; marking a 12-year-long span for the Munroe and Rice vaudeville team.\n\n\n== Later career as a Broadway star and death ==\nIn the first two decades of the twentieth century Munroe starred in several Broadway musicals. His roles on the New York stage included the title role in The Doings of Mrs. Dooley at the Grand Opera House in 1902; Aurora Borealis in Anne Caldwell's The Top o' th' World at the Majestic Theatre in 1907–1908; Miss Tiny Daley in The Mimic World of 1908; Pansy Burns in Raymond Hubbell and Glen MacDonough's The Midnight Sons (1909, Broadway Theatre); Patricia Flynn in A. Baldwin Sloane's The Never Homes (1911, Broadway Theatre); and Mrs. Honoria O'Day in Lew Fields' production of The Sun Dodgers (1912, Broadway Theatre).\nMunroe also starred in the musical revue The Passing Show in 1914 and 1915. He performed regularly in both Broadway and regional theaters owned by the Shubert family from 1911 until his retirement from the stage in 1922.\nMunroe died at Atlantic Shores Hospital in Somers Point, New Jersey, on January 29, 1932. He was survived by his wife, the actress Anna Sedgewick.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGeorge W. Munroe at the Internet Broadway Database",

        "content": "Reprise Please Baby: The Warner Bros. Years is a 2002 box set of songs by American country musician Dwight Yoakam, highlighting his career on Reprise Records and Warner Bros. Records, along with his initial 1981 demos and two new tracks. It has received positive reviews from critics.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nWriting for The A. V. Club, Stephen Thompson stated that this compilation \"has more than settled any arguments about Yoakam's rightful place in modern country's canon\" by including material from his \"fine\" 1980s releases as well as the musician's \"immensely satisfying but lesser-known '90s catalog\". Editors at AllMusic rated this album 5 out of 5 stars, with critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine writing that \"on Rhino's excellent four-disc box set\" Yoakam's inluence on country music is display with \"a superb chronicling of his time at Reprise/Warner Records\" that \"doesn't focus simply on the hits\", adding up to music that is \"all necessary to understanding Yoakam's music and his influence\". Jim Caligiuri of The Austin Chronicle also rated this box set 5 out of 5 stars, characterizing it as \"a testament to a talent unmatched in many ways\" and \"a marvelous first chapter in a career that shows no signs of slowing down\". In a brief overview of box sets released at the end of 2002, Neil Strauss stated that the best part of Reprise Please Baby: The Warner Bros. Years was the fourth disc of previously unreleased studio and live material and continued that \"in this set, one can hear [Yoakam']s stubborn traditionalism and his innate eclecticism intertwine as two decades roll by\". No Depression's review stated that \"so many good points jump out of the speakers here\", displaying that \"Yoakam is equally at home with all forms of country from the second half of the 20th century\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nAll songs written by Dwight Yoakam, except where noted.\nDisc 1\n\n\"Honky Tonk Man\" (Tillman Franks, Howard Hausey, and Johnny Horton) – 2:48\n\"Guitars, Cadillacs\" – 3:05\n\"It Won’t Hurt\" – 3:05\n\"Miner’s Prayer\" – 2:19\n\"Little Sister\" (Doc Pomus and Mort Shuman) – 3:03\n\"Little Ways\" – 3:21\n\"Please, Please Baby\" – 3:35\n\"Always Late with Your Kisses\" (Blackie Crawford and Lefty Frizzell) – 2:11\n\"This Drinkin’ Will Kill Me\" – 2:34\n\"Streets of Bakersfield\" (Homer Joy) – 2:50\n\"I Sang Dixie\" – 3:49\n\"I Got You\" – 3:29\n\"I Hear You Knockin’\" (Dave Bartholomew, Pearl King, and J.

        "content": "Hunting is a significant regulated subsistence and recreational activity in Spain with a long-recorded history. The country is widely considered one of the most relevant hunting destinations in the world, backed by the variety of its species, climates, terrains as well as sheer size and relatively low density of human population. With almost 1 million licenses in 2017, it is the second country with most hunters in Europe. Internationally, it is also the second country that imports most big-game hunting trophies from overseas after the United States.Hunting is regulated and administered by the Ministry of Agriculture, which oversees its correct functioning. The Junta Nacional de Homologación de Trofeos de Caza is the governing body for the control and assessment of trophy hunting, in charge of measuring them and granting gold, silver or bronze medals to the more exceptional harvested animals, broadly in line with the CIC guidelines.\nSpain offers a variety of different big-game species, most commonly the Spanish red deer, fallow, roe, Iberian ibex and its four subspecies, mouflon, arrui, Pyrenean and Cantabrian chamois and boc. Cantabrian brown bears and Iberian lynxes have been protected since the 1970s after almost becoming extinct, and more recently the Socialist government of Pedro Sánchez oversaw the protection of the Iberian wolf, whose hunting north of the Douro river was legal until 2021.  Some of the most popular small-game species include the red-legged partridge, duck, hare, rabbit, woodcock, pheasant and the red fox. The iconic Cantabrian grouse was protected in the second half of the 20th century.\nThe two most common modalities of hunting are monterías (big-game) which take place from mid October until end of February, and regular stalking (both big and small-game) which can be practiced regularly throughout the year, with some exceptions such as the month of March.Almost 85% of Spain is officially declared as 'hunting grounds', and in 2020 there were 32,187 hunting grounds (both public and private) in which 17 million animals were harvested. The total spending in hunting in Spain was €5.5 billion in 2016, equivalent to €6.5 billion when calculated as gross domestic product (0.3% of the total Spanish GDP for that year) with a tax revenue generation of €614 million and supporting almost 200,000 full-time equivalent jobs.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the Neolithic, and with the discovery of agriculture, humans became sedentary and a significant change occurred in their way of hunting. Where previously humans had only hunted for food, they were now hunting to protect their cattle and crops from other predators.\nIn the Middle Ages, hunting became a privilege as it was an activity enjoyed by kings and nobility, and this continued even well into the arrival of the industrialization in the 19th century. \n\nIn the 20th century, the decades of the 1940s and 1950s saw big-game hunting continuing to be somewhat elitist, while small-game was abundant across all sectors of society. With the devastation of the country after the Spanish Civil War, hunting allowed thousands of families to feed themselves and survive the terrible conditions of poverty and famine. Although in 1946 only 140,000 hunting licenses had been issued, hunting was socially well regarded even if conducted in absence of a licence. \nIn the 1960s and 1970s, big game-hunting began to grow at an abnormal rate on the back of increasing incomes and hunting demand. Hunting was beginning to be seen as an activity that served as a fund to foster human, political and financial relations. In these decades the infrastructure began to be improved and the first fenced fincas (estates) and even the first partridge farms appeared. In 1970 the ambitious \"Ley de Caza\" (hunting law) was introduced. With the establishment of this law, more hunting reserves were created, stricter calendar seasons implemented and allowed species and numbers limited. The \"Ley de Conservación de Espacios Naturales y Flora y Fauna Silvestre\" (Law on the Conservation of Natural Spaces and Wild Flora and Fauna) was published in 1989 and the autonomous communities acquired the powers for enacting their own hunting laws.\n\n\n== Modalities ==\n\n\n=== Big-game hunting ===\nThe game species that fall under the umbrella of the term \"big-game\" sometimes differ from one country to another. In Spain, the benchmark is for species that in the adult state are larger than a fox (foxes are not included): wild boar, red deer, roe deer, Iberian ibex, Pyrenean and Cantabrian chamois, Fallow deer, mouflon, arrui and boc.\n\n\n==== Montería ====\n\nOf this modality of driven-hunt with over 300 years of history, there are two variants practiced in Spain.\nIn the best-known variant, \"montería española\", practiced in almost the entire peninsula, the hunters (called \"monteros\") are placed in pegs surrounding a \"mancha\" (area of more or less thick forest where the animals take refuge) arranged in lines (called \"armadas\") that surround the perimeter. Once all the hunters are positioned, a series of \"rehalas\" (packs of around 20 dogs) begin to move the hunt through the \"mancha\" to force the game into the positions of the hunters so these may shoot them.In this variant, the different \"aramdas\" in which the pegs are positioned are given the following names depending on their position:\n\nCierre (closure): it is a line of pegs that closes the hunting area to prevent the game from escaping without a chance of being shot.\nTraviesa: it is a line of pegs that crosses through the interior of the hunting area.In the other variant, the \"montería norteña\", more typical of northern Spain, before placing the pegs, the animal beds are searched with leashed dogs (mainly houndss). Knowing the location of the animals to be hunted, the pegs are placed based on the assumed escape routes etc.\nOnce the hunt is over, the so-called \"junta de carnes\" (literally \"meat gathering\") is held, and here the \"arrieros\" (porters) will display the animals harvested during the montería so that the hunters can observe the general result of the event and take some pictures.\n\n\n==== Rececho ====\nKnown in English as stalking, it consists of approaching a previously selected animal. It is the modality that requires the most physical effort from the hunter, since he must be travel some distances to locate the animal and reach an optimal shooting range, without the animal perceiving his presence. This modality is characterized by being the most selective of all. From the beginning, the hunter knows with certainty the animal he is looking for, as well as its sex and approximate age.\n\n\n==== Espera ====\nThe hunter awaits in silence in a stand or position with clear visibility and shooting range to an area frequented by the animals. These may be lured using bait or different methods of attraction.\n\n\n=== Small-game hunting ===\nSmall-game animals are those that are smaller than a fox (including) in their adulthood, most of which are birds, rabbits, hares and mustelidae.\n\n\n==== Caza en mano ====\nThe small-game equivalent of a \"rececho\" or stalking, hunting 'in-hand' contemplates the hunter walking in search of the animal, nomrally accompanied by one or several dogs to help locate the game.\n\n\n==== Ojeo ====\nThe small-game equivalent of a montería, it is a type of driven-hunt where beaters and dogs will move birds into the pegs so that these may be shot by the hunters. Similar to the pheasant hunts in England and the rest of Europe.\nRed-legged partridges are the most common species hunted at \"ojeos\". The elevated prices and large amounts of shot birds (over 2,000 at times) that have become customary at \"ojeos\" in Spain are subject to some controversy. In 1959, dictator Francisco Franco and a group of hunting enthusiasts shot a record 4,608 partridges in one morning at Santa Cruz de Mudela.\n\n\n==== Reclamo ====\nThis type of hunting, known in English as decoy hunting, involves the use of birdcalling and other techniques in order to lure the animal close enough to be shot.\n\n\n==== Cetrería ====\n\nThe hunt involving a bird of prey. Spain is known for its peregrine falcons, which are the most sought-after bird of prey.\n\n\n== Finca ==\n\nA \"finca\" is the term used for estates in Spain, and typically one with a sporting lodge, farmhouse or estate building present, and often adjacent to a woodland or plantation.Due to its extensive size, Spain has thousands of private fincas, many over 1,000 hectares. The largest finca in Spain is \"Valdepuercas\" (18,000 hectares), and belongs to José María Aristrain, who was the owner of Arcelor prior to its merger with Mittal. Other very large renowned hunting fincas include the \"La Garganta\" of the Duke of Westminster (15,000 hectares), \"Las Lomas\" of the Mora-Figueroa family (12,000 hectares) or \"El Castañar\" of the Duke of Pastrana (11,500 hectares).Prices of fincas have gone up significantly over time. In 2016, Sheikh Mansour acquired the finca \"Los Quintos de San Martín\", a 8,000-hectare falconry haven near Valencia de las Torres, Extremadura, for €55 million.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBig-game hunting\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nAnderson, Robert S.

        "content": "Damo Justin Baro, also known as Justin Damo Barro, is a Burkinabe economist and politician who served as Minister of Finance between 1983 and 1986 under Thomas Sankara. During that time, he was President of ECOWAS' Council of Ministers. In the 1990s, he served in the World Bank, and later helped create the West African Economic and Monetary Union.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBaro was born on December 31, 1952, in Toussiana, Houet Province, French Upper Volta (now Burkina Faso), and spent most of his youth in Bobo-Dioulasso. Baro obtained a master's degree in business law at the University of Poitiers in 1975, a diploma in treasury inspection at the National Treasury School, and a degree in development economics from the Paris Nanterre University in 1993. Baro returned to Upper Volta in 1978, entering a career as a bureaucrat.\n\n\n== Career ==\nBaro began his career in Burkina Faso in 1978 as the head of the studies and regulations department of the Treasury and Public Accounting sector of Upper Volta's Ministry of the Economy. He then became Director General of the Budget of the Treasury in 1979. After the 1983 Upper Voltan coup d'état, Baro became Minister of Finance between 1983 and 1986, and held several economy-related positions during Thomas Sankara's administration. At that same time, Baro was President of the ECOWAS Council of Ministers and President of the Board of Directors of the ECOWAS fund between 1985 and 1986. In 1985, Baro was appointed as a financial analyst of the World Bank's Africa division, a position he held until 1994.\nBaro was appointed economic advisor to the Burkinabe president in 1994, and also went on to help found the West African Economic and Monetary Union. He worked at the WAEMU as commissioner of the economic policies department until 1996, when he was appointed as vice-governor of the Central Bank of West African States (CBWAS), replacing Kadre Desire Ouedraogo. Baro's role as vice-governor of CBWAS was renewed twice; in 1998 and in 2003. He was appointed acting governor on December 23, 2005, following Charles Konan Banny's accession as Prime Minister of Ivory Coast. In 2008 Philippe-Henri Dacoury-Tabley was appointed to governor, instigating Baro's departue. After this, Baro was suspected to be appointed by Blaise Compaoré as Burkinabe ambassador to Paris. In December 2010, Baro was appointed as chairman of the board of directors of the International Bank of Burkina, a subsidiary of the United Bank for Africa.\nFollowing the 2014 Burkina Faso uprising, Justin Damo Baro left his position as special advisor to Honoré Traoré in December 2014. In February 2020, Baro spoke at a conference regarding Burkina Faso's transition away from CFA franc, speaking in favor of keeping the CFA franc. In February 2024, Baro advised economists at the International Forum for Stock Market Investment in Ouagadougou.\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBurkina Faso at the Eye of a West African Storm, 1986\n\n\n== References ==",

She was one of the first women admitted to Kyiv Polytechnic Institute, and graduated  from the school's agronomy program in 1911.\n\n\n== Career ==\nKosach worked in the viticulture industry in Kyshyniv; after 1917 she taught and researched plant physiology in Kyiv, and worked as a translator of French literature. She was convicted of \"counter-revolutionary agitation\" in 1937, and spent two years in a labor camp, and at Lukianivska Prison in Kyiv. She left Ukraine with her daughter and her sister Olha in 1944 after she was imprisoned by the Gestapo. She spent time in refugee camps, and moved to the United States in 1949. \nKosach-Borysova wrote memoirs. She and her sister, journalist Olha Kosach-Kryvyniuk, worked with Ukrainian Academy of Arts and Sciences (UVAN) to publish their sister's works on the occasion of Lesya Ukrainka's centenary. She was an honorary member of the Union of Ukrainian Women of America. \n\n\n== Personal life ==\nKosach married Yuri Hryhorovych Borysov in 1912. They had a daughter, Olga. Her husband died in a Siberian prison in 1941. She died in 1980, at the age of 92, in Piscataway, New Jersey. In 1989, she was posthumously \"rehabilitated\" by the Supreme Soviet, and soon after her daughter transferred her papers to a Ukrainian archive. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAudio based on an interview with Kosach-Borysova, for a radio broadcast; online at the Ukrainian History and Education Center website",

        "content": "John Macpherson (1817 – 17 March 1890) was a Scottish physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMacpherson was the younger brother of Samuel Charters Macpherson, and son of Hugh Macpherson, professor of Greek in the university of Aberdeen, was born at Old Aberdeen in 1817, and after education at the grammar school, entered the university, and graduated M.A., and was created an honorary M.D. He studied medicine at St. George's Hospital in London, and at a school in Kinnerton Street, from 1835 to 1838. He then went abroad, to Bonn, Vienna, and Berlin, for a year. In October 1839 he became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. While and in India he published 'Statistics of Dysentery,' 1850; 'Insanity among Europeans' 1853 'Report on Native Lunatic Asylums,' 1855; 'On Antiperiodics,' 1856; and on his return 'Cholera in its Home,' 1866; 'Our Baths and Wells of Europe,' 1871; 'Annals of Cholera up to 1817,' 1884; and a privately printed 'Essay on Celtic Names.' He believed that no drug had any effect upon cholera, and he differed from many writers in holding that cholera was observed in India as early as 1503. He travelled much in the British islands and on the continent, making the observations recorded in his books on 'Baths and Wells.' His last Journey was in 1859 to the south of Spain. He knew French and German well, but not Gaelic, although he was much interested in Celtic studies. His kindly disposition was manifest in his face, his conversation was learned, and, like his manners, simple and unaffected. He lived in London, in Curzon Street, and there died after a long illness, 17 March 1890.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Moore, Norman (1893). \"Macpherson, John (1817-1890)\".

        "content": "SS Healdton was an oil tanker that was launched in Scotland in 1908 as Purelight. In 1916 the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey acquired her and renamed her Healdton, after the city of Healdton, Oklahoma.\nIn March 1917 two explosions sank her off the Dutch coast in the North Sea. 21 of her crew were killed, including seven US citizens. Survivors reported seeing a submarine surface just after they abandoned ship. This is one of several sinkings of US merchant ships that helped to provoke the US to declare war on Germany.\n\n\n== Building ==\nThe Greenock & Grangemouth Dockyard Company built the ship as yard number 307 at Cartsdyke in Greenock on the Firth of Clyde. She was launched on 1 July 1908 as Purelight, and completed that August. Her registered length was 369.0 ft (112.5 m), her beam was 50.9 ft (15.5 m) and her depth was 27.3 ft (8.3 m). Her tonnages were 4,489 GRT and 2,723 NRT. She had a single screw, driven by a three-cylinder triple-expansion engine made by John G. Kincaid & Company of Greenock. It was rated at 472 NHP and gave her a speed of 11+1⁄2 knots (21 km/h).\n\n\n== Ownership and identification ==\nPurelight's first owner was the Purelight Steam Ship Company, Ltd, which seems to have been a one-ship company created to own her. She was registered in Hamburg, and her code letters were RPWJ. By 1911 her ownership had been transferred to the Pure Oil Company, GmbH. At the same time, the Pure Oil Co became the owner of Pennoil, which had belonged to the Pennsylvania Trading Company, AG. Pennoil was a sister ship of Purelight that Greenock & Grangemouth had built in 1903.\nBy 1914 Purelight was equipped with submarine signalling and wireless telegraphy. When the First World War began in August 1914, Purelight was in Hamburg.\nIn 1916 the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey acquired her, renamed her Healdton, and registered her in New York. Her US official number was 213893 and her code letters were LFRM.\n\n\n== Loss ==\nIn Standard Oil service, the ship had \"HEALDTON – U.S.A.\" painted in white capital letters several feet high, amidships on either side of her black hull. At night the letters were illuminated.\nOn 26 January 1917 she left Philadelphia with a cargo of 6,200 tons of kerosene for Rotterdam. She contacted Halifax, Nova Scotia, by wireless on 9 February, and left Halifax on 9 March. She was in Bergen in Norway from 17 to 20 March. From Bergen she set course for Rotterdam along a safe channel that the Imperial German Navy had prescribed for neutral ships in the North Sea.\nAt 20:15 hrs on 21 March she was 23 nautical miles (43 km) north by east of the Terschelling lightship off the Dutch coast, making 10 knots (19 km/h), when an explosion hit her port side amidships. It wrecked her engine room and put her electric generator out of action, so all her lights went out. Then a second explosion hit her bunkers farther aft and started a fire. The ship listed to port and settled by her stern. At least two crewmen were killed by being trapped below decks.\nHer crew prepared her lifeboats for lowering. Number 1 boat capsized shortly after being launched, killing all but one of its occupants. Her Master, Captain Charles Christopher, said that the boat was \"cut from the tow line prematurely\". 12 men abandoned ship with Captain Christopher in Number 2 boat. Seven abandoned ship with the Chief Officer in a third boat. Healdton sank at position 53°53′N 04°28′E about 20 minutes after the explosions. Captain Christopher saw a submarine surface 100 feet (30 m) away, and then dive again. He did not see any identification markings on the submarine. However, he was certain that the two explosions were torpedoes, presumably fired by the submarine that he saw.\nThe weather was freezing, with hail and snow. None of the men in the open boats was fully clothed. Two members of the engine room were naked, their clothes having been blown or burnt off them. Some others were in their underwear, or had no footwear. Some were suffering from burns. They rigged the sails in the boats and rowed toward Terschelling lightship. The boats became separated in the dark.\nDutch fishing trawlers saw the light from Healdton burning, but mistook it for the Aurora Borealis. However, at 08:00 hrs the next morning the steam trawler Java sighted the sail of Number 2 boat, and went to investigate. The survivors were too hypothermic to maneuver the boat, so Java came alongside, and Dutch trawlermen jumped aboard the lifeboat to keep the two boats together and transfer survivors to Java.The survivors were landed at Terschelling.\n\nAt about 14:00 hrs on 22 March the Royal Netherlands Navy torpedo boat Hr.Ms. G-13 found the third boat, and landed survivors at Terschelling. Two of the men in the third boat were naked. One had died of hypothermia before the rescue; the other was brought ashore but died in hospital.\nLater, the Dutch steam trawler Ocean found Number 1 boat. It had capsized, but one Norwegian crewman had righted it and climbed aboard. His arms and legs were frozen, but he was alive. Ocean landed him at IJmuiden.\nA total of 21 Healdton's crew were lost. 13 were US citizens, including the second officer, third officer, and third engineer. The other eight were Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Swedish. The US Government had insured Healdton for $499,000 under the War Risk Insurance Act. Her sinking was the War Risk Bureau's biggest single loss to date.\n\n\n== Context and consequences ==\nIn the Netherlands, Germany was blamed for sinking Healdton. Algemeen Handelsblad said \"The unreliability of the German assurances regarding the so-called safe zone is shown by the reports of the crew of the Healdton and the crews of fishing boats\". Het Nieuws van de Dag said that if the incident led to war between the US and Germany, it would be Germany's fault.\nThe New York Times claimed that a newspaper called the Cologne Gazette blamed US President Woodrow Wilson: \"President Wilson's advisers know that American ships can enjoy no preferential treatment in the barred zone. It is therefore a wanton game that Mr. Wilson plays.\" There was no newspaper of that name at that time. However, British and US newspapers sometimes called the Kölnische Zeitung the \"Cologne Gazette\".\nGermany denied sinking Healdton, and declared that she was in a British prohibited zone when she was sunk. Imperial German Navy records do not show any U-boat in the vicinity when Healdton was sunk, whereas Royal Navy records show that the minelayers HMS Angora, Princess Margaret, and Wahine laid a minefield in that part of the North Sea on the night of 18–19 March. However, that does not explain Captain Christopher's statement that he saw a submarine. It is possible for one ship to hit two mines, but it should be borne in mind that the first explosion was amidships and the second was in the after part of the ship.\nHealdton left Philadelphia on 26 January, before Germany announced on 1 February that it was resuming unrestricted submarine warfare. She was in Halifax when the United States Senate was debating the Armed Ships Bill, and Progressive Republicans led by Robert M. La Follette filibustered it. She was crossing the North Atlantic from Halifax to Bergen when President Wilson ordered the defensive arming of US merchant ships after the bill had been talked out. In the US there were some who took Healdton's sinking as further justification for the policy to arm merchant ships. It did not change President Wilson's decision, but he added it to the list of incidents to present to the special session of Congress that he had called for 2 April.\nHealdton joined a growing list of US merchant ships that had been sunk since 1 February 1917. And the 21 fatalities among her crew joined 15 who were killed when the cargo ship Vigilancia was sunk on 16 March. The next US ship to be sunk was the cargo ship Aztec on 1 April, in which 28 of her complement were killed. Aztec was the first US merchant ship to be defensively armed.\nOn 2 April, President Wilson asked Congress to declare war against Germany. The news of Aztec's sinking came during the course of the debate. On 6 April, Congress passed the motion by an overwhelming majority, and the US declared war on Germany.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBureau of Navigation (1917).

        "content": "Ugolino di Vieri (1438 – 10 May 1516), also known as Verino, was an Italian notary and poet in the Republic of Florence, best remembered for his Latin dactylic hexameter. Born in Florence to a noble family of magistrates, he was trained under Cristoforo Landino, and served as a court poet to Lorenzo de' Medici. He was a humanist and humanities teacher to Pope Leo X, Francesco Pitti, and Crinitus. He was also given patronage by Girolamo Savonarola and the Piagnoni. He died in Florence.His major poetical work, Flametta, was dedicated to Cosimo I de' Medici (1463) and then rededicated to Lorenzo de' Medici (1464). His Paradisus (1468–1469) was written in memory of Cosimo. Between 1469 and 1480, he composed an epic on Charlemagne entitled De gestis Magni Caroli, better known as Carlias. After a religious conversion, he dedicated his Carmen de christiana religione ac vitae monasticae felicitate (1491) to Savonarola and rejected secular poetry.Ugolino's son, Michele di Vieri, known for his letters, predeceased his father at the age of eighteen.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nVerino, Ugolino.

        "content": "Nova civitas (New city), today's Gryfice, was granted town privileges in 1262 by Duke Wartislaw III of the House of Griffin. The city was established under Lübeck law on the left bank of the lower Rega river. From 1262 to 1648, it belonged to the lands of the Pomeranian dukes, from the House of Griffin. From 1648 to 1701, it was part of Brandenburg-Prussia. From 1701 to 1918, it belonged to the Kingdom of Prussia (since 1871, part of the German Empire), and from 1918 to the state of Prussia within the German Reich. From 1919 to 1933, Gryfice belonged to the Weimar Republic, while from 1933 to 1945, it was part of Nazi Germany. From 1945 to 1952, Gryfice belonged to Rzeczpospolita, from 1952 to 1989 to the Polish People's Republic, and since 1989 to Rzeczpospolita.\nDespite armed attacks from numerous robber barons, wartime devastation, and frequent fires, Gryfice developed quite dynamically. They reached their economic peak between the 14th and the mid-16th centuries. Later, even after World War II, they did not lose their significance in the region. The city plays an important role in the political, economic, and social life of the local community.\n\n\n== Traces of pre-locational and locational settlement of the city ==\nResearch conducted by German and Polish archaeologists indicates that the Gryfice land was inhabited during the Neolithic period. Evidence of material culture from this period has been found in Bielikowo, Gąbino, Gosław, Pruszcz, and Strzykocin, which has been confirmed in later periods. Additionally, settlement in these areas was confirmed in later periods (the Bronze Age), including in Kołomąć, Kępa, Mojszewko, Rewal, Smolęcin, Wyszków, Cerkwica, Niedźwiedziska, Rogozina, Niedysz, Chomętowo, Skrobotowo, Rzęskowo, Wołczyn, Witno, and Trzebusz.\nStudies based on sources indicate that these areas were inhabited by Germanic peoples in the 2nd century AD. Ptolemy's treatise – Geography (Greek) Γεωγραφικὴ Ὑφήγησις (2nd century AD) – lists among these peoples those who inhabited the areas of today's Western Pomerania and Gdańsk. Contemporary studies on the treatise (D. Stichtenoth) indicate that the areas from the Szczecin Lagoon to the east to the Wieprza river were inhabited by the Sidini. Their western neighbors were the Farodinians, and their eastern neighbors were the Rutiklians.\nArchaeological research has not confirmed the continuity of settlement in these areas, reaching Gryfice back to the V period of the Bronze Age (Hallstatt period) – the Lusatian culture, or the later period – the Jastorf culture. Some researchers, based on traces indicating a developing early medieval settlement in this area between the 5th and 7th/8th centuries, speculated that the beginning of the town was given by three hamlets from around the 10th century, one of which (possibly a gord) could have formed the basis for the future location. The location of the town in an area developed before the 13th century was confirmed by contemporary archaeological research. Archaeologist Marek Dworaczyk excavated and described the remains of a settlement (hearths and artifacts) with strong influences of the Hallstatt culture (Bronze Age period, i.e., 10th–8th centuries BC) in the area of the present-day Treasury Office in Gryfice on Niepodległości Street. The settlement extended northeast towards the current Victory Square.\nIt is also not known what the nature and type of the settlement were at that time. However, it is known that it was inhabited by people of the Lusatian culture and temporarily penetrated by inhabitants of the nearby Lubieszewo. In the Old Town, surface surveys were conducted in the 1960s, and specialized archaeological research has been carried out for about 20 years. They were carried out during investment works (infrastructure retrofitting). Historical sources from the late Middle Ages were excavated in several parts of the Old Town. Right next to Wałowa Street, in its southern part (S), relicts of the city wall were excavated, and the sediment level of the moat was registered. Fragments of city fortifications were also excavated on Klasztorna Street. Further discoveries recorded cultural layers on Niepodległości Street (14th–15th century), while on Ruta Street, surveys and linear excavations revealed fragments of wooden pavement, which was made of planks and beams. According to archaeologists, they constituted part of the street and fragments of residential and economic buildings (13th–14th century).\n\nMarek Dworaczyk, after analyzing the existing archaeological research, summarized the knowledge about the beginnings of Nova civitas as follows:In the light of the data available today (...) Gryfice arose on the so-called \"raw root,\" in a relatively sparsely populated area. It seems that the primary intention of founding the town in this area was both settlement and economic intensification in this part of Pomerania.\n\n\n== Middle ages ==\nIn the early Middle Ages, the territories of the Gryfice land were inhabited by the tribes of the Western Pomeranians. These were circles of influence, according to newer research – the Wolinians, Prissani, and Brzeżans (deriving from Lechitic tribes, the same as the Veleti), and later, until the mid-13th century, the Kashubians, and not, as previously erroneously suggested, the Severians. Remnants of early medieval settlements are hillforts in Lubin, Prusinowo, Trzygłów, and Witno.\nDuring the times of Mieszko I and Bolesław I the Brave, these lands were briefly annexed to the Polish state. In 1121 (or 1119), the Battle of Niekładz (Latin: Naclam) took place in the Gryfice land, in which Bolesław III Wrymouth defeated the forces of Western Pomerania led by the dukes Wartislaw I and Swietopelk I. In the spring of 1124, at the behest of Duke Bolesław Wrymouth, a mission of Bishop Otto of Bamberg arrived at the lower Rega. In the nearby Clodonie (Latin) (probably today's Kłodkowo), the Wends (Slavs) from the area were baptized without any resistance. Folklore also states that the teachings of the new faith were carried out in a place called \"Apostołów\", land lying between today's Gryfice and Trzygłów.\n\nIn the mid-13th century, the rulers of Pomerania were the princes from the Pomeranian House of Griffin, Barnim I and Wartislaw III, who encouraged settlement in these areas to strengthen their power. Barnim I, the Duke of Szczecin, ruling the eastern areas, settled mainly German population here, while Wartislaw III, the Duke of Demmin, ruling the western areas, encouraged Dutch and Danish settlers to settle. From 1234, Barnim I and Wartislaw III competed with each other in founding cities. Wartislaw founded Greifswald, Demmin, and Kołobrzeg. In 1262, he issued a town charter based on Lübeck law, in which the settlement (composed of three villages) received town privileges and 100 lans of land in the vicinity of the lower Rega river. The town charter designated the city's name as Nova civitas supra Regam (New city above the Rega). Lokator of the city, Jakob von Trebetow, received 20 lans of land and the task of founding the city. After the death of Wartislaw III, the owner of his lands became Barnim I, who confirmed the grants of location and rights. From his time comes the name of the city – Civitat Griphemberch super Regam (Gryfia Góra – city above the Rega) from 21 September 1264. The locality received customs rights, forest clearance, navigation on the Redze river and coastal waters, temporary tax exemption (for 10 years), enabling it to become significantly wealthier.\nIn the course of the 13th century, the significance of the center increased. After the town's founding, a rural gmina was established in Gryfice (an important administrative link), which took over the former functions of the pre-location settlement. The dukes of Szczecin entrusted the city with a significant portion of taxes, courts, and jura regalia. The center was subordinate to the castellania of Kamień Pomorski. The first merchants, settlers in Gryfice, were residents of Gryfia (today's Greifswald in Germany). The influx of Germans was gradual and did not cause drastic changes in local governing spheres. Merchants organized the purchase of profitable products, including grains, wax, hides, resin, hemp, meat, and honey. Goods were exported to counterparties in Lübeck, and from there to further European recipients. However, the basis for the city's development was native trade and the development of local craftsmanship. Numerous sołectwos, mills, and taverns were established. Gryfice's export goods were associated with annual markets held in the city. The largest of these included St. Gawel's Fair (October 10), honey markets (September 30), and poultry markets.\n\nAt the end of the 13th century, the construction of the brick St. Mary's church with three naves began, and in 1300, the construction of defensive walls surrounding the city. Their total length reached 650 meters with a span of 200–350 meters. The city fortifications were enriched with 3 gates (High Gate with a foregate, Stone Gate, and Rega Gate with a barbican), 3 shooting towers (Powder Tower, Bridge Tower, and Mill Tower), numerous bastions, and a moat. The municipal council consisted of 9 to 12 councilors. Every year on St. Michael's Day (September 29), 1/3 of the council was changed. The authorities took over lower judiciary functions. In 1316 and 1357, the city entered into alliances against robbers who conducted raids, plundered, and attacked neighboring villages. These alliances restored the normalization of life and economic development.\nAt the turn of the 13th and 14th centuries, Gryfice had about 500 inhabitants. In the city center, near the main market square, a massive Gothic town hall was erected, which served various functions. The first mention of the mayor of Gryfice dates back to 1398. It was Hinze Slede, who served in this capacity until 1419. The town hall housed cloth halls and the seat of the lay court. In the basement of this building was the municipal prison with a dungeon, carcer subterranensis. Since 1327, the city had the right to impose punishment (gallows, stake, sword, and executioner's axe). Next to the town hall was the \"weigh house\", where butchers and bakers paid taxes. Religious life flourished. In the 13th century, a Franciscan monastery was established here, along with an adjoining church (on Bracka and Klasztorna streets). In the following century, the city already had 5 churches with almshouses and hospitals.\nIn one of the documents from 1386, a Latin school in Gryfice was mentioned, commonly referred to as the oldest \"Latin\" school in Pomerania. The position of this school was not high. The rector (rector scolarium), Johannes Parsow, was denied the title dominus and was only referred to as \"master\". His students were called \"apprentices of the teaching art\". They formed the church choir and were obliged to participate in three consecutive services, funerals, and assistance to the sick. The school operated under the patronage of the St. Mary's church. According to H. Berghaus, such a school in Gryfice was only established in 1426.\nNext to the splendid houses of the patricians and knights, buildings made of wood and clay, covered with reeds or straw, were erected. Gryfice had two guilds – merchants and brewers. Craftsmanship was represented by numerous guild organizations. Craftsmen were responsible for transporting supplies for the princely court, maintaining fortification equipment, cleaning moats, and providing armed protection for the city. Besides merchants and craftsmen, the city was inhabited by a large number of commoners, engaged in the heaviest work related to construction, transportation, and navigation. They were also employed in herding municipal and private cattle herds. The wealth of the merchants determined their position in the city and strengthened the power of this group in Gryfice's social life.\n\nMaritime trade and navigation on the Rega river developed. Probably in the mid-14th century, Gryfice became an associate member of the Hanseatic League (1365), although for evading regulations regarding fish markets in Scania, the city was expelled from the league for three years (1366). Membership was restored for participating in the war between the league and the Danish king (1368–1370). In the years 1394–1401, the city provided two ships with an 80-man crew to combat pirates, known as the \"Victual Brothers\".\nIn the 15th century, Gryfice three times joined the alliances of Pomeranian cities (1427, 1471, and 1481). The city provided assistance, especially financial, to the ruling dukes in disputes over succession and in suppressing noble revolts. In the struggle for the primacy of the burghers in the city's political life, Gryfice contributed to the weakening of the nobility.\nIn 1464, Otto III granted Gryfice the privilege of minting its own currency, which the city never utilized. It was one of the last documents issued by the Duke of Szczecin before his death.\n\nIn the 15th century, there were several disputes over fishing rights and trade with Trzebiatów, located north of Gryfice, which attempted to impose tariffs on Gryfice ships traversing the Rega (similarly to what happened with the Norbertine monastery in Białoboki in the 14th century). In 1449, Trzebiatów attempted to block the river for all ships coming from the south, leading to an escalation of the conflict. Bogislaw X clarified the situation, ending the forty-year period of conflict between the two cities along the lower Rega (1488).\nThe latter half of the 15th century brought organizational changes to the Gryfice school. In the founding document of 1477, the duties of the rector of the Latin high school (German: Lateinschulen), Leonardus, were formulated. The city council referred to the rector as \"our city servant\" (German: unserer Stadt Denere). From then on, the school became a municipal institution. The teacher's salary was 90 grzywnas (half of the teacher's income was covered by the students). By the end of the 15th century, the school employed two teachers – the rector and the cantor.\n\n\n== Early modern period ==\n\nIn the early 16th century, the population of Gryfice exceeded 2,000 inhabitants. The Low German name of the city, Griphemberch, gradually transformed into Griffenberge. In 1534, the parish church became the property of the Lutheran church. This was a result of the gradual introduction of the new religion to the Pomeranian territories. The residents of Gryfice leaned towards the Reformation, initiated by Martin Luther in 1517. There were many reasons for this – disputes with the Norbertines of Białoboki, close contacts with the center of Protestant thought in Trzebiatów, resentment towards the papacy caused by a papal court ruling from 1450 (related to the conflict with the Norbertines of Białoboki over free navigation and trade on the Rega river), competition from monks in trade, crafts, and agriculture, as well as strong influences from supporters of the new church. In 1525, the city council seized the church treasury, and ten years later, it took over all the assets and properties of the monasteries. Over the course of a hundred years, the city experienced a second wave of Germanization, which, in addition to important offices, also affected the church.\nAfter 1534, following the Reformation, changes occurred in education. A new curriculum was introduced in the municipal school, where German, Latin, and Greek were taught. It envisaged the establishment of three classes and the employment of three teachers: a rector, a sub-rector, and a cantor. In 1580, a school for girls was opened there.\nIn the 16th century, ethnic movements took place. A wave of German settlers arrived in place of peasants fleeing to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.\nIn 1538 and 1554, there was a renewed escalation of conflict with Trzebiatów. It was caused by Gryfice residents not delivering the undersupply for the renovation of breakwaters and the construction of ships, which were too large compared to the lock capacity. The conflict ended in 1589. The passage of Brunswick troops through Gryfice in the 1560s (during the Northern Seven Years' War) caused extensive damage and losses in the city's economy. As a result, there was an economic regression lasting until the second half of the 17th century. In 1595 and 1620, there were rebellions by dissatisfied craftsmen who demanded a share in governing the city. Their aspirations were not realized. In the 16th and 17th centuries, many witch trials took place in Pomerania, including Gryfice. Women accused of practicing black magic and spreading superstitions were charged. The shooting guild began its activities in 1603.\n\nIn 1618, the Thirty Years' War began, disrupting the development of the city. On 4 December 1627, formations of Albrecht von Wallenstein entered Gryfice. Three companies of the imperial cuirassier regiment were quartered there. In addition to the expenses for maintaining the garrison, the people of Gryfice suffered enormous losses due to looting and arson. Numerous murders and rapes terrorized the local population. The occupiers seized weapons and ammunition from the local arsenal. After imposing a new contribution of 1200 guilders on the city in 1629, a complaint was filed at the imperial court, as a result of which the cuirassiers left the city. Repression was also avoided the following year when Italian mercenary troops were stationed in Gryfice. Due to the spreading plague, the population decreased by about 75%. The decrease in the city's population was also caused by numerous residents fleeing from the occupier and oppressive taxation. Imperial troops plundered surrounding villages and the city until the arrival of Swedish troops in August 1630. The Swedes acted as official allies of the Duke of Szczecin. Gryfice experienced another period of disasters and destruction. At that time, 7,000 Swedish, Irish, and Scottish soldiers were quartered in the city and its surroundings.\nIn 1637, the last Griffin, Bogislaw XIV, died. There were concerns about the annexation of the country to Brandenburg-Prussia. Annexation was guaranteed by succession agreements from 1493 and 1571. Due to the \"hard law of war\", the troops demanded increasingly new supplies of foodstuffs, which severely strained the productive capabilities of the population. From 1643, partisan activity began under Colonel Matthias von Krockow (a fanatical enemy of the Swedes). The population of nearby villages felt this most acutely. For a significant sum of money, the city bought itself out of further raids. The last years of the Thirty Years' War led to visible impoverishment of the city. It no longer resembled a thriving center of trade and production from the Middle Ages. The wealthiest fortunes collapsed (including the guild of clothiers). By the Peace of Westphalia in Osnabrück in 1648, the city was incorporated into Brandenburg-Prussia. The new authorities sought to win over the Pomeranians. A Pomeranian collegiate parliament was established, which also included representatives from Gryfice. One of them was given the honorary title of landrat. In the mid-17th century, the reconstruction of the city began, which was interrupted by the new Second Northern War, also known as the \"Swedish Deluge\" (1655–1660).\nIn 1657, cavalry units under Stefan Czarniecki approached Gryfice in pursuit of the Swedes. Numerous bandit raids accompanied the imposed contributions. Despite the losses caused by military actions, the city's situation improved after Frederick William switched sides to the anti-Swedish coalition. Trade routes with Polish and Brandenburgian lands were revived. The city suffered immense losses due to fires and epidemics. The biggest fire occurred in 1658, consuming the entire southwest part of the city. Among the buildings destroyed was the St. Mary's Church. Another fire in 1668 once again devastated most of the city. Commemorating these events was the annual ceremony called the \"Festival of Fire\", which was observed in Gryfice until the 18th century. In the 17th century, the city expanded with the addition of suburbs, Kamień Pomorski and Trzygłów, allowing the residents to diversify their sources of income. Gryfice was known as a city associated with overseas trade, but the production of linen textiles played a more significant role, for which Gryfice was also renowned.\n\nIn 1699, the distinguished historian Friedrich von Dreger was born in Gryfice. He published over 3,200 publications and documents related to the history of Pomerania, which were collected in a collection called Codex Pomeraniae Diplomaticus, commonly known as the Dreger Codex. The publisher died early, in 1750.\nAfter 30 years of peace in Gryfice, Russian soldiers appeared. Along with the troops of Peter the Great, Polish and Saxon soldiers of Augustus II the Strong passed through Gryfice. This 9-year period of warfare led to the re-devastation of the city. The municipal system was reformed in 1713, with many aspects of city life subordinated to military commissariats. In 1723, the Gryfice County was established. It was one of 19 counties directly subordinate to the Military Chamber and Royal Domains. As part of the administrative reform, there was a slight change in the city's name from Griffenberge to Greiffenberg.\nIn the second half of the 18th century (during the Seven Years' War), the city was occupied three times by the forces of Empress Elizabeth of Russia. In 1761, there was a concentration of Prussian forces (about 12,000 soldiers) between Gryfice and Karlino. They were confronted by a Russian corps (about 35,000 soldiers). The battle took place under the walls of the city of Gryfice. Artillery bombardment destroyed numerous fortifications and caused fires in the city itself. After the surrender of the Prussian garrison, the city was occupied by the Imperial Russian Army until 1762.\nIn the 18th century, there was an economic revival. The city had 2 mills, 2 inns, and derived income from 1000 lans of land, 10 villages, and 5 folwarks. In 1790, a brickworks was built. The cause of the revival was government patents granted to foreign craftsmen (mid-18th century), which encouraged settlement in the Gryfice area and the city itself. Immigrants were granted all municipal and guild rights, free plots for building houses, building materials, hereditary property rights, tax exemptions, interest-free loans, and eventually high earnings. After the establishment of a garrison here in 1714, the officer corps gradually assumed the role of the local patriciate. Woolen fabric weaving factories continued to operate in the city.\n\n\n== Modern period ==\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, the city once again found itself in the midst of military actions, this time by Napoleonic France. The Gryfice Landrat von Wrichen began conscripting recruits. This action was interrupted by the appearance of a French detachment, which occupied the city on 8 November 1806. After receiving supplies for the army, the Napoleonic forces left the city and headed eastward. Gryfice then saw the arrival of Ferdinand von Schill's partisan units, who brutally suppressed popular uprisings against the Prussians and conducted terrorist actions. F. von Schill fortified and militarized the city, formed squadrons of \"black dragoons\", and stationed infantry in Gryfice's fortifications. General Jan Dąbrowski ordered Colonel Franciszek Garczyński to \"scatter the rebels\", as he referred to Schill's formations. Open conflict only arose when F. von Schill was defeated near Nowogard and when the French-Italian corps of General Pietro Teulié arrived in Gryfice, relieving the Poles. F. von Schill withdrew because he was unable to repel the enemy's overwhelming force. The French committed numerous acts of plunder, robbery, and rape. French troops, numbering 7,000, remained in the city until 14 November 1808.\nFrom the beginning of the 19th century, the population increased to around 3,000 inhabitants. This led to the expansion of the city, giving rise to a new district – Gryfice's New Town. Since 1816, as a result of administrative reforms (1815–1818), the city became the seat of a powiat in the Region of Stettin of the Province of Pomerania. The city was renamed Greifenberg in Pommern. In contrast to the former municipium in Gryfice, a municipal self-government was established. Its body was the magisterial college, elected by municipal deputies. The mayor headed the magistrate, assisted by aldermen. The magisterial college dealt with the city's property, regulatory, and patronage matters. Medieval privileges were abolished, and the old guild system and monopolies disappeared. Opportunities for further economic development of the city were created. Trade was revived, and inns and taverns experienced their \"golden days\". However, the development of productive forces progressed very slowly.\nFrom 1830, the expansion of the school network began. Schools were attended by youth from merchant and artisan families. In addition to the gymnasium established in Gryfice in 1852, named after Frederick William I, two elementary schools operated within the city (the first mention of them dates back to 1811). The first was the Public City School (German: Allgemeine Stadtschule), consisting of 4 boys' and 4 girls' classes, with over 500 children attending. The school was led by a rector with university education, who was also a preacher at the St. Mary's Church. The second elementary school was the \"free school\" (German: Freischule), with 2 mixed-sex classes, attended by an average of over 150 children.\n\nThe cultural life gained momentum through the emergence of associations formed there. In the mid-19th century, the first Gryfice newspapers appeared. In 1843, the Greifenberger Kreisdrucken (published three times a week), in 1867, the Greifenberger Zeitung, and in 1869, the Greifenberger Kreis-Blatt. During the Springtime of Nations, the city and the region seethed with revolutionary events. Alongside the activities of reactionary elements in the Gryfice County, there were also factors supporting the revolution. Economic slogans were raised, and demonstrations were organized to support them. Under Prussian rule, the city descended into the role of a small provincial center. Agricultural economy in the vicinity of Gryfice was also neglected.\nIn 1862, the city celebrated the 600th anniversary of its municipal rights. Hermann Riemann outlined the monograph of the city, History of the City of Gryfice (German: Geschichte der Stadt Greifenberg in Pommern). There was increased interest in archaeology, leading to the discovery of a \"treasure\" – large coins buried during the pre-Colonial period of the city. In the 1870s, graves from the Lusatian culture period were discovered near Polesin. Historical artifacts and former city fortifications were saved from demolition. The city's architecture still features half-timbered buildings. Only a few residents built their villas on the outskirts of the city. In the latter half of the 19th century, a synagogue and a half-timbered church of St. John (German: St. Johanniskirche) were built. The church was demolished decades later. A new neo-Gothic brick church was built on its site (today, Nowy Świat Street) between 1911 and 1913.\n\nOnly the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries brought further economic development to the city. Within its territory, a sugar refinery, a ceramic and furnace products factory, a starch factory, and a marmalade factory were built. In 1882, Gryfice gained rail connection with the construction of the Dąbie–Kołobrzeg line, significantly facilitating the transport of agricultural products to larger cities and ports. In 1896, the construction of the first narrow-gauge railway line through Popiele to Niechorze was completed. Two years later, the line to Dargosław via Tąpadły was opened. In 1901, a newly built line connected Gryfice with Golczewo, and in 1913, a railway to Kołomąć was launched. Both lines had a track gauge of 750 mm, which was changed to 1000 mm in 1900. In 1911, a reinforced concrete bridge was put into use, connecting the city center with the right bank of the city.\nThe early 20th century was marked by the discovery of princely kurgans in nearby Lubieszewo (from 1908 to 1925), classified as part of the so-called princely graves of the Lubieszewo group from the 1st century BCE to the 2nd century CE (Gustow group).\n\nDespite the intensified emigration of Gryfice's population to overseas countries and more developed centers, the city continued to develop economically in the period preceding the outbreak of World War I. In 1913, the population exceeded 7,300. Workers flowed into Gryfice, finding employment in the local sugar refinery and surrounding estates. Their number reached several hundred. During World War I, the city was attributed with economic growth. Sparse data from those years do not allow to determine the extent and areas of social life in which this growth occurred; however, historiography suggests that it was primarily in the agricultural sector.\n\n\n== Interwar period ==\n\nIn the years 1919–1920, authorities became concerned about revolutionary movements among the urban and rural proletariat. A two-day strike in Trzebiatów in June 1919 resonated widely in Gryfice. Acts of terror, murders, and rapes occurred in surrounding villages. After the suppression of the revolution, a new period of Prussian rule ensued, represented by the Junker class.\nIn 1932, a new Catholic church was built in Gryfice, on today's Nowy Świat Street. The painting of Our Lady of Częstochowa, consecrated there on 16 November 1932, was a gift from Polish seasonal workers. Permits for seasonal work for Polish workers were gradually restricted. In their defense, a Polish union of agricultural workers was established there in 1933.\nAfter Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany and the Nazi Party won local government elections, Nazi Party members occupied leadership positions in the Gryfice administration. The so-called Kreisleitung of the Nazi Party (district leadership) in Gryfice consisted of 25 units managing district affairs. The headquarters were located in Trzebiatów. Gryfice lost its role as the district seat. At the head of the bureaucratic machinery in Gryfice was Landrat von Holstein (subordinate to Kreisleiter F. Ohm).\nThe actions of the Nazi Party were directed against the Jewish population living in the city. In 1933, there were only 68 Jews in Gryfice. Their number had been gradually decreasing since the mid-1920s. Individuals of Jewish faith were harassed through police surveillance of Jewish organizations and individuals. In 1935, they were deprived of their civil and public rights.\nIntensification of agriculture and expansion of military facilities began. The Nazis established labor service formations (Reichsarbeitsdienst) and a district peasant association (Kreisbauernschaft), and credit facilities were launched. Efforts were made to counteract the so-called \"flight from the East\" of peasants and workers. The party's revisionism was directed against employed Poles. On one hand, there were fears of \"Slavs\" seasonally employed in the city and its surroundings, but on the other, the necessity of economic development led to changes in attitude towards this issue. However, numerous repressive actions against local Polish activists and employees of the Polish consulate who visited the city were noted in Gryfice itself.\nThe 1930s brought significant changes to the media market. Newspapers that had been published up to that point collapsed. The developing propaganda of the Nazi Party began extensive cooperation with the Kreiszeitung für den Kreis Greifenberg (from 1935 onwards), which served as the propaganda mouthpiece of the local Nazi Party.\nDuring the interwar period, there were two major industrial plants here – a potato flake factory and a sugar refinery. There was also a factory for fruit processing and a cement plant, and the textile industry center was developing. As a result of industrial development, the city simultaneously increased its population. During the last German census, Gryfice had 10,805 inhabitants. In 1938, as a result of administrative changes related to the incorporation into the new administrative region of Pomerania in Piła, Gryfice was annexed to the Region of Köslin. This situation lasted until 1945.\nIn 1938, the liquidation of Jewish property intensified, known as \"Aryanization\". The synagogue on Poetensteig Street (now 3 Maja Street) was taken over by the Nazi Party during the so-called Kristallnacht.{{efn|From the topography of the city of Gryfice in 1930. At the same time, the Jewish cemetery located on Turnerstraße Street (now Sportowa Street) was destroyed and liquidated. After November 1938, the Nazi authorities began the forced purchase of Jewish properties and shares in companies, which, according to the law, passed into non-Jewish hands or became state property.\nAs part of the preparations for war, food reserves were organized in Gryfice, intensifying agriculture to the limit of its capabilities. In the eve of the war, units of the Wehrmacht were concentrated here, forming part of Army Group North, commanded by General Field Marshal Fedor von Bock.\n\n\n== World War II and the capture of the city ==\nOn 1 September 1939, World War II began, once again changing the face of the city. After the end of the September Campaign, a greater number of prisoners were brought to Gryfice and employed in the city and its surroundings. Following them, larger numbers of inhabitants from the General Government began to arrive along the Rega river, seized in street roundups and forcibly recruited from the Kielce and Lublin regions. They were employed on the rural estates near Gryfice and in the industry within the city.\nFrom mid-1943 onwards, residents from areas threatened by air raids began to arrive in Gryfice. The city was not a target of such attacks as it was located in a purely agricultural area and had no strategic significance. From January 1945 onwards, massive migrations of the German population began. Gryfice lay on one of the three main routes used by organized evacuation convoys and groups of disoriented refugees from the east.\nOn 1 March 1945, as part of the East Pomeranian offensive, Soviet troops from the 1st Belorussian Front began to attack the German Army Group Vistula, which defended Pomerania. The alarm in Gryfice was only announced on the night of March 4–5, 1945. In the midst of great confusion, mass evacuation from the city began. Not everyone managed to leave the city. Although the escape had been ongoing since March 2, all narrow-gauge trains and military vehicles were overcrowded. About 6,000 people remained in Gryfice, hiding in their homes. The decision was made to surrender the city without a fight, although the Military City Commandant reported preparations for defense.\nOn March 5, around 3:00 PM, the first units of the 5th Independent Guard Motorcycle Regiment (commanded by Lt. Col. Anatol Muraczew) began to appear. There were no regular battles at that time because German units were leaving the city in panic, and the remaining inhabitants of Gryfice were afraid for their lives. On that day, the Soviets executed about 30–40 people. Battles with German units only occurred on March 7 when German soldiers attacked the city from the direction of Smolęcin. They fought on the eastern outskirts, then in the area of the sugar refinery and barracks, towards Trzebiatów.\nGerman troops (commanded by Colonel Joachim Hesse and Major Fritz Sann) were completely driven out of the city in the afternoon. The 30 Soviet soldiers and 13 Polish soldiers killed in the fighting were buried in two graves in the Gryfice market square. Civilian population also took part in the fighting and was shot by Soviet troops alongside the prisoners.\nOn March 8, around 7:00 PM, soldiers from the 1st Independent Warsaw Cavalry Brigade appeared in Gryfice. As Polish units entered Gryfice, the city was still burning. The fires were started by the Russians (including throwing grenades into buildings, pouring gasoline and oil on tenements), and at that time the entire Old Town was on fire, and 318 objects were burnt down. During the occupation of the city, soldiers committed numerous rapes, murders, and robberies against the civilian population. As a result of the fighting, the city was 40% destroyed.\nFrom March 9 to April 9, 1945, Gryfice was the headquarters of the First Polish Army. From here, battles of Polish units for Kołobrzeg were directed, among other operations. The military command of the Soviet Union took over power.\n\n\n== Polish Gryfice ==\n\n\n=== Between 1945 and 1950 ===\n\nSoviet military commandant Major Łukin, a few days after the city was captured, began to organize Polish administration using local Poles who were brought back to Gryfice from forced labor or returning from Germany. Mieczysław Tacher was appointed mayor. After his resignation on 1 April 1945, Wacław Brustmen was nominated, but the mayor's authority was limited. The poor security situation prompted the commandant to establish a Polish municipal militia. The final abolition of the Soviet military command in Gryfice occurred on 12 July 1945, which, in turn, led to a deterioration in public security (improvement occurred a few months later, with the establishment of the District Public Security Bureau in September 1945). From June 1945 to June 1946, Polish authorities temporarily used the name Zagórze for the city.\nDespite the lack of an international decision regarding the lands beyond the Oder river and the Baltic Sea, the Government Plenipotentiary Office for the Western Pomerania Region formed an administrative operational group for the Zagórze district. Kazimierz Borzęcki was appointed as the government plenipotentiary (starosta). The group arrived in Gryfice on 18 May 1945. A few days later, the provincial command of the Citizens' Militia sent 10 officers to the city. According to the starosta's report, there were about 4,000 Germans and 150 Poles in the city, mainly from Mogilno. Three months after W. Brustmen's appointment, Tadeusz Radomski was appointed deputy mayor, effectively leading the city council's work. In agreement with the military commandant, the Deutschenrat (under Polish office control) was established. The city council became a Polish-German body, where most officials were Germans, and Poles held managerial positions. The Polish character of the administration began to emerge only as Polish settlers arrived.\nAfter W. Brustmen's dismissal (he was arrested by the military on June 10), the mayor became Płóciewniczak, who chaired the Gryfice Advisory Council, one of the few established in Western Pomerania. Its main tasks included ensuring the increase and consolidation of Polish ownership (suspended in September, reactivated in January 1946 on different principles). On 25 September 1945, Eugeniusz Zych was appointed mayor, delegated by Lt. Col. Leonard Borkowicz. He held this position until 18 December 1945, when he was nominated for a similar position in Trzebiatów.\nThe process of resettling the Polish population to Gryfice began in May 1945. Planned settlement of Polish and trans-territorial settlers took place in October. According to data from December 1945, around 3,600 people had already been resettled to Zagórze. Depatriation of the German population began on 2 August 1945. Some families left voluntarily, departing the city after it was occupied by Soviet troops. The action of forced expulsions ended on 30 July 1948. Further deportations continued under the slogan of \"family reunification\". According to the census of 31 December 1948, only 13 Germans (0.14% of the city's population) remained in the city. By the end of 1948, Gryfice had become a multi-ethnic city, dominated by Poles with an influx of Ukrainian, Belarusian, and Lithuanian settlers.\nIn late autumn 1945, central authorities decided to relocate the 1st Warsaw Cavalry Division to Gryfice and transfer the district authorities to Trzebiatów. Due to numerous protests, this decision was revoked. Thanks to this, the city maintained its status as a district center. Since 2 August 1945 (Potsdam Conference), the announcement of the expulsion of Germans caused some of them to voluntarily express their desire to leave. The German residents of the city were expelled by 1946.\nThe only social representative body was the Inter-Party Consultative Commission. Representatives of various political parties arrived in Gryfice along with the first settlers. Among these parties, the Polish Western Union and the People's Party, later transformed into the United People's Party, were predominant. The District Office of Information and Propaganda oversaw mass propaganda campaigns. The Consultative Commission provided a political direction to the local community, organized social life, and resolved inter-party friction. At the initiative of the commission, numerous social organizations were established, including the Committee for the Care of Demobilized Soldiers, the Committee for the Care of the Graves of Polish Soldiers, and the Society of Friends of the Soldier.\nEarly on, sports and cultural life were organized. The Zagórze Sports Club was established, featuring several sports sections including football, athletics, volleyball, motorsports, and cycling. Cultural subsections included the Stage Enthusiasts Circle, a string orchestra, a male choir, and a vocal quartet. The Capitol cinema became the focal point for cultural life and also served as the local radio station headquarters.\nPolish education in Gryfice began its work on 4 September 1945. Classes were held at the 1st Polish Public Primary School (the former German girls' school building on 3 Maja Street, now Gymnasium No. 2). The school admitted its first 64 students. Soon, the educational base was expanded to include the State Gymnasium and High School established on 12 December 1945. Józef Pańkowski was its organizer and first director. Although the school commenced operations on 1 November 1945, the official approval for the institutions' activities was issued by the education board on 12 December 1945.\nIn Gryfice, there were the Social Welfare Department (providing care for orphans and war invalids), Polish Red Cross, Social Care Home, a kindergarten, and 2 transit points of the State Repatriation Office. Due to the real threat of an epidemic, a makeshift medical clinic was organized, followed by the opening of a hospital in July 1945.\nGryfice suffered from a severe lack of drinking water, electricity, and gas, so efforts were made to restore these utilities. Communication within the city and with the rest of the country was organized through horse-drawn and motor transport (due to the lack of telephone and telegraph communication). The first telephones started operating at the end of 1945. Communication was improved by launching a narrow-gauge railway in July 1945. The normalization of life in the city was accompanied by the transfer of additional production facilities by the military, including a flakes factory, marmalade factory, mill, and sugar refinery. Craft workshops were established, and a cooperative movement emerged – the Consumers' co-operative, Industrial-Agricultural co-operative, Peasant Mutual Aid Association, and Dairy co-operative, as well as co-operative sectors, known as parceling-settlement co-operatives. As a result of their activities, 253 families settled in the city (1947–1949). The first production cooperatives were established on their land. In June 1946, the municipal authorities once again changed the name of the city from Zagórze to Gryfice.\nNew residents of post-war Gryfice had to overcome many difficulties in terms of provisioning, accommodation, and communication. However, in the first post-war year, the foundations for the efficient functioning of the city in almost all areas of life were already laid. Local priests also actively participated in this process, providing special assistance to those most in need of support and help. Particularly noteworthy is the activity of the local parish priest, Stanisław Rut, and the branch of Caritas in Gryfice.\nThe guidelines from 15 April 1946 for the Recovered Territories initiated the establishment of national councils. Initially, the authorities of the councils belonged to the government's plenipotentiary. In the Gryfice County, the national councils were established at the end of the calendar year. Until their establishment, the function of the national councils was performed by the head of general administration and the Inter-Party Consultative Commission. On 29 September 1946, the County Organizational Committee of the County National Council was established. Its first meeting took place on October 12. The council consisted of 38 councilors. Wacław Wierciński (Polish Socialist Party) was appointed Chairman of the County National Council in Gryfice, and Tadeusz Bedera (Polish Workers' Party) was appointed Vice Chairman. The executive body of the council was the County Department. Three committees worked alongside the council: social control, educational, and budgetary. Zygmunt Pogoda became the first county head in Gryfice. The Municipal National Council in Gryfice was established on 17 December 1946, and the communal councils at the beginning of 1947.\n\n\n=== Between 1950 and 1970 ===\nThe infamous events known as the \"Gryfice incidents\" marked the early 1950s in the history of Gryfice. In 1950, cases of using force to enforce planned grain deliveries from farmers, so-called \"kulaks\", occurred in the Gryfice County. The aim of these actions was to obtain the required grain supplies and prepare for the collectivization of villages. Party and administrative officials, members of the Union of Polish Youth, public security and police officers, as well as \"grain trios\" and \"youth brigades\" (light cavalry brigades), participated in the violation of the rule of law. The involvement of the state administration in the violation of the rule of law involved the so-called \"regulation\", which included the seizure of land previously legally granted to some farmers in exchange for fallow land (in accordance with directives from county political authorities). The grain trios, with the involvement of the Security Service and the police, conducted unlawful inspections, engaged in theft and vandalism of farmers' property. Pressure was exerted and the so-called \"kulaks\" were harassed, and in few cases, they were arrested.\nBefore the climax of the Gryfice incidents in 1951, there were abuses in grain procurement. Farmers were unlawfully deprived of over 7 tons of grain. This collectivization campaign caused a true exodus of peasants from the Recovered Territories and a decrease in agricultural production. After the resolution of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party on 16 May 1951, condemning the Gryfice events, the situation calmed down, although intimidation and beatings of peasants continued, but not on such a scale. On 25 May 1951, with the involvement of the media, a show trial was held by the Supreme Court, which recognized the grievances of 7 affected farmers. They were ordered to be compensated for the losses they suffered. Another 11 farmers were compensated from a special fund of the Provincial National Council in Szczecin. Party and youth activists involved in the case were expelled from the party and organizations and sentenced to several years in prison.\nIn the 1950s, new workplaces emerged, including in rural areas. The agricultural cooperative sector quickly expanded. Between 1950 and 1955, there were already 65 co-operatives in the Gryfice County, comprising 1,628 farms covering 18,094 hectares of agricultural land. However, all co-operatives were liquidated in 1957.\n\nIn 1953, the Victory Obelisk was unveiled in Victory Square, commemorating Soviet and Polish soldiers who died in the battles for the city in 1945.\nIn 1954, exhumations were carried out of 30 Soviet and 13 Polish soldiers buried in Victory Square from the period of World War II. The remains of the Soviet soldiers were transported to the war cemetery in Kamień Pomorski, while those of the Polish soldiers were taken to Siekierki near Oder river.\nThe population of the city reached its pre-war level in 1955, with over 10,000 inhabitants. There was an increased demand for new residential premises. Construction of new apartments in Gryfice began in 1958. The new buildings were primarily erected in the city center, where war damage was most severe. The first 2 residential blocks were made available for occupancy in 1960 (by the end of 1965, 1,186 living quarters were put into use).\nIn the meantime, the Inter-Plant Housing Co-operative Kolejarz was established in 1961, which was transformed four years later into the Nad Regą Housing Co-operative. The first co-operative tenant apartments were built as early as 1967. The co-operative expanded its activities to Trzebiatów and Płoty. By the end of 1975, 9 buildings with 354 residential units were constructed in Gryfice. In 1960 and 1967, two primary schools were built and put into operation (now Primary School No. 3 and Primary School No. 4).\nThe years 1950–1960 were characterized by significant developmental dynamics, except for the regression in 1956. This regression was influenced by the reduction in population influx and the erroneous economic policy towards small towns (elimination of private trade and craftsmanship).\nIn 1962, the city celebrated its 700th anniversary of granting municipal rights. Two years later, the Gryfice Cultural Society was established, which mobilized organizationally talented residents to work for the city. The society aimed to disseminate knowledge about the region, organize leisure and recreation, promote culture and support artistic creativity, as well as develop the cultural, educational, tourist, and recreational base. Thanks to many years of efforts and cooperation with the Institute of History at the University of Szczecin, the society has published 4 historical publications titled Ziemia Gryficka (in 1971, 1973, 1987, and 1993). These are the main sources of knowledge about the history of the city and the Gryfice region.\nFrom 1962 to 1966, investments were directed towards mechanizing field work. Approximately 55% of the total expenditure was allocated to mechanization. Special attention was paid to new production co-operatives established as part of the further stage of agricultural co-operativization (such as SP Smolęcin, Łopianów, etc.). Individual farming developed relatively well. In 1966, the Agricultural Construction Company was established. This allowed for the allocation of more funds for construction and assembly investments, implementation of the housing construction program, construction of livestock buildings, and other utility buildings. Gryfice received over 10% of the total monetary funds allocated for investments in cities at the provincial level. The city was classified in the I group of urban development.\nBy the end of 1968, 1,905 living quarters had been put into use, and several hundred more were renovated and rebuilt. There were already 41 industrial plants in Gryfice (including 9 private ones). The largest ones were: the sugar refinery, Industrial Plants of the Local Industry, Gryfice Industrial Plants, the County Co-operative of Multibranch Services, and a tile factory. The city had a sewage network of over 15 km, a water supply network of 6 km, and a gas network of over 21 km. Additionally, it had a hotel, an expanded educational base (4 kindergartens and 4 primary schools, a high school, and an economics technical school).\n\n\n=== Between 1970 and 1990 ===\n\nSince 1970, Gryfice has been the headquarters of the 26th Anti-Aircraft Brigade OPK. In the same year, the current town hall building was put into use. In 1970, thanks to the efforts of the county authorities, a decision was made by the provincial authorities to build a district hospital in Gryfice – a facility with a full profile. The construction investment of the district hospital was entrusted to the Stargard General Construction Company. There was also an increase in funds allocated for major renovations. There was a revival in the individual construction sector.\nIn Gryfice, youth organizations operated (Polish Scouting and Guiding Association, Union of Socialist Youth, Union of Rural Youth) (since 1976, the last two as Polish Socialist Youth Union, from 1973 to 1981 affiliated with Federation of Socialist Unions of Polish Youth), as well as sports clubs – including sports shooting Baszta, football Sparta, table tennis, competitive cycling, volleyball (in the 1980s), and chess. Numerous organizations, societies, and associations also existed in Gryfice. In 1976, the garrison club with a modern cinema Meteoryt was opened. It was located in the city park, by the Rega river. The club became another center of cultural life in Gryfice (closed in 2003 and demolished a few years later).\nThe turn of the 1970s and 1980s was a period of worsening economic situation in the country. Informal workers' and employees' unions emerged, showing solidarity with the main centers in the country. They began an open fight against the existing system of power. In defense of workers' rights, the Solidarity trade union was established, joined by a group of oppositionists from Gryfice (including Artur Balazs, an employee of the Seed Center in Gryfice, later interned). Almost all professional groups in Gryfice took part in street protests and strikes.\nOn 13 December 1981, after the introduction of martial law, tanks, armored vehicles, military patrols, and police appeared on the streets of Gryfice. It marked the beginning of an almost 5-year period of economic stagnation in the city. The lack of basic goods intensified dissatisfaction. The introduction of \"food ration cards\" aimed to regulate food items and normalize social life. Economic improvement only occurred after 1986.\nThe construction of the hospital was completed in 1982, and three years later – on 12 April 1985 – a ceremony was held in Gryfice to mark the completion of the investment for the district health care center and to name it after professors Julia and Witold Starkiewicz, pioneers of Gryfice healthcare.\n\n\n=== Between 1990 and 2010 ===\n\nIn the 1990s, a wide-scale development of services, private trade, and small-scale manufacturing began, contributing to the city's growth during the difficult period of state transformation. Many retail and gastronomic outlets went bankrupt, unable to cope with the pace of currency devaluation and high interest rates on bank loans. As a result of the bankruptcy of many post-communist enterprises, massive unemployment emerged, sometimes reaching over 30% of the working-age population (according to data from March 2004–24.3%).\nGryfice became a center for the production of agricultural and food products. The largest production facilities during this period were Gryfice Sugar Refinery and the State Grain and Milling Plants in Gryfice. The city was involved in grain processing and wood processing. Production of acrylic bathtubs began, as well as paper and hygiene products. The rich deposits of peat in the vicinity of Gryfice started to be utilized. The local road transport market and high-tonnage fleet services also expanded.\nThere was a development of media in Gryfice. New periodical titles emerged, and in 1996, a Catholic radio station – Radio Fala (now Radio Plus Gryfice) was established. The West Pomeranian Regional Television was also founded, broadcasting its program on the cable network.\nAccording to data from the Central Statistical Office from 2008, Gryfice reached its highest population in 1997, with 18,177 inhabitants.\nAs a result of educational reforms, two secondary schools were established: Secondary School No. 1 named after the Soldiers of the Home Army and Secondary School No. 2 named after Nicolaus Copernicus. An urban amphitheater was built on the Błonia of the City Park after the closure of the inactive fountain and the utilization of some grassy areas.\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, the bridge made of reinforced concrete connecting the city center with the right bank of the city was reconstructed. The bridge was adorned with four griffins, referring to the history of the city and the House of Griffin lineage of Western Pomerania. At the end of 2001, the military unit was disbanded. Thanks to European Union's funds, the city's monuments were restored (as part of the revitalization of cultural heritage sites), numerous road sections were rebuilt, and traffic flow was improved. A new municipal cemetery was built.\nAfter Poland's accession to the European Union on 1 May 2004, significant emigration of the population from the city and neighboring areas to Western European countries began. After the dissolution of the military unit, the municipal authorities became interested in spatial development of the barracks area. Public utility institutions and a branch of a higher education institution, the West Pomeranian Business School, were relocated there (at the intersection of Nowy Świat and J. Piłsudski streets). New workplaces were established, and buildings were acquired for communal housing resources.\nOn the 90th anniversary of Poland's independence regained on November 18, a commemorative stone was ceremonially unveiled. The stone was dedicated to Marshal Józef Piłsudski and was located in the square at 11 Listopada Street, with a plaque (and bust) honoring \"Marshal Józef Piłsudski, the reviver of independent Poland\".\nFrom 1945 to 1998, the city belonged to the Szczecin Voivodeship, and after the administrative reform of the state in 1999, it became part of the West Pomeranian Voivodeship. Gryfice became the seat of the county again.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nState Archive in Szczecin.

At the time, Democrats held 17 seats while the Republicans held 16, having lost their majority only months prior due to the recalling of Senator George Petak.\n\n\n== Summary ==\n\n\n=== Close races ===\nState Senate district 30, 3.58%\nState Senate district 28, 4.08%\nState Senate district 10, 8.24%\nState Senate district 16, 8.97%\n\n\n== Outgoing incumbents ==\n\n\n=== Retiring ===\nJoseph F. Andrea (D–Kenosha), representing district 22 since 1984, decided to retire.\n\n\n== Recall election ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nIn October 1995, Senator, George Petak, faced controversy when he changed his vote on a funding bill for the Miller Park stadium. Miller Park was being planned to replace the forty-year-old Milwaukee County Stadium and was being pushed by Republican Governor Tommy Thompson and Milwaukee Brewers owner and future-Commissioner of Baseball, Bud Selig. Petak had promised his constituents that he would vote against the bill, but changed his mind based on the belief that the Brewers would leave Wisconsin if a new stadium wasn't built.\nPetak's change in vote supported a 0.1% increase in sales tax for five counties in the vicinity of the proposed stadium, which included Petak's home county of Racine. His actions caused outrage and frustration in his home district, and local Democrats were energized to collect signatures for a recall petition. After collecting 15,050 signatures, or 130% of the required 11,577 signatures, the recall was certified on March 26, 1996, and a recall election was ordered for June.\n\n\n=== Petition ===\n\n\n=== Results ===\nNine months after his vote on the stadium tax, Petak became the first Wisconsin state legislator to be removed from office in a recall election, when he was defeated by Democratic State Representative Kimberly Plache. As a result of the recall, control of the state Senate flipped to Democratic control for the rest of the session.\n\n\n== Results summary ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "On April 5, American singer JoJo Siwa released the debut single for her adult era, titled \"Karma\", along with a music video. The song was produced by Rock Mafia, consisting of musicians Tim James, Antonina Armato, and DJ White Shadow. Rock Mafia and Desmond Child had written the song. Musically, the song is a dance-pop and EDM track about a woman who regrets being unfaithful to her partner, seeing it as karma when they move on from her to find someone new. \nOn April 14, a version of the song called \"Karma's a Bitch\" was officially released as a single by American singer Brit Smith. Timbaland collaborated on its production back in 2012, when it was recorded and never released. \n\n\n== History ==\nThe song was originally written for Miley Cyrus in 2011; once she turned it down, it was handed to Brit Smith. Miley Cyrus allegedly recorded an unreleased demo of the song, originally titled \"Karma's a Bitch\", for her album Can't Be Tamed, but it was scrapped due to Cyrus's contract with Disney at the time.\nFollowing the release of Siwa's song, Smith's music video for the unreleased demo began to go viral on social media, which gained her media attention. Her version was granted a release shortly after Siwa's.\n\n\n== JoJo Siwa version ==\n\n\"Karma\" is a song by American singer JoJo Siwa. It was released through Columbia Records on April 5, 2024, as the lead single from her upcoming debut studio album. Siwa teased the song and its music video on social media prior to its release, saying she wanted to rebrand herself after performing for 11 years with a child-friendly image. The song and its accompanying music video were met with universally negative reviews from critics and social media users.\n\n\n=== Background and release ===\n\nJoJo Siwa began her career as a child star on the reality TV series Dance Moms, where she appeared from the show's fifth season to its eighth, and later found fame through her YouTube channel and her collaborations with Nickelodeon, around the time she released songs such as \"Boomerang\". She came out as queer in January 2021 and dated two women in 2022.\nOn March 12, 2024, Siwa teased \"Karma\" with a viewer discretion warning on social media, stating that it was \"not made for children\" and \"may be disturbing or offensive to some viewers\". She posted the title of \"Karma\" on social media on March 18, 2024 along with a snippet of the song, which received negative publicity. Siwa stated that the Internet had \"taken [her] through the frickin' wringer\" while teasing the song, but was unfazed, stating that she \"made the art she wanted to\", happy to \"bring this version of pop music back\".\nSiwa appeared at the 2024 iHeartRadio Music Awards in a black mesh bodysuit, a fauxhawk, and makeup inspired by American rock band Kiss, where she compared her rebrand to that of Miley Cyrus in 2013 during the release of her album Bangerz. Charlie Duncan of PinkNews described it as a \"fairly jarring rebrand\", while Sydney Brasil of Exclaim! opined that \"she looks the same as she once did, just in darker colours\". The look became an internet meme. Siwa called \"Karma\" her \"first breakout adult moment\" after performing for 11 years with a child-friendly image. The song was released as a single on April 5, 2024.\n\n\n=== Composition ===\n\"Karma\" is an upbeat dance-pop and EDM song, its lyrics about a protagonist regretting having cheated on her significant other after getting caught. Strings accompany Siwa throughout the song, specifically at its beginning. In its chorus, she sings, \"Karma's a bitch, I should've known better/If I had a wish, I would've never effed around\".\n\n\n=== Reception ===\n\"Karma\" was panned by music critics, criticizing the song and Siwa's reinvention of her brand and aesthetic. Ivan Guzman, writing for Paper, called the song \"raucous\" and \"early 2010s-esque\", while drag queen Aquaria compared the song to \"early-2010s Jeffree Star\". For Exclaim!, Sydney Brasil labelled the song as \"poorly produced\" with \"no real hook\" and wrote that Siwa did not seem fully committed to her \"new ['bad girl'] persona\". Jason P. Frank of Vulture wrote that \"Karma\" had \"a thumping, uninspired beat\" and \"faux-edgy lyrics [...] performed with all the conviction of the elementary-age students who used to be her fans\". \nCriticism of the song \"Karma\" has been attributed to wider societal issues by some, with media and psychology experts such as Pamela Rutledge emphasizing the negative impact of online anonymity, stating, \"because the internet offers some degree of anonymity, there’s a 'feel and post' cycle that occurs with little regard for its effect on others\".\nDespite the controversy, Siwa broke the record for the largest crowd at Miami Beach Pride in history with her performance of Karma, with a turnout 55,000 people.\n\n\n=== Music video ===\nThe music video for \"Karma\", filmed in March 2024, was directed by Siwa and Marc Klasfeld, with choreography by Richy Jackson. Siwa pitched the concept and choreography for the music video a year before its release. It stars Alexis Warr, the winner of So You Think You Can Dance's 17th season, on which Siwa was a judge. The music video contains lesbian themes throughout.\nIn the video, Siwa first appears in the same black bodysuit and makeup as at the 2024 iHeartRadio Music Awards. She is shown on a desert island, caressing another woman who is in a red sparkly bodysuit. She is then on a boat, where she is shown in a love triangle between the woman from the island and another woman, played by Warr, before again appearing on the island, where she humps the first woman.\nThe video was met with negative reviews from critics. Hannah Dailey of Billboard called the video \"truly wild\" and wrote that it \"marks an extreme departure from [her] kid-friendly persona\". As of April 18, 2024, the video has amassed over 24 million views on YouTube.\n\n\n=== Charts ===\n\n\n== Brit Smith version ==\n\n\"Karma's a Bitch\" is a song by American singer Brit Smith. It was produced by Rock Mafia and Timbaland in 2012, but was eventually scrapped. It was released independently on April 14, 2024. The song garnered attention on TikTok before its official release after the then-unreleased song and music video originally uploaded in 2012 and to Vimeo on March 20, 2013 went viral on TikTok, thanks to JoJo Siwa's 2024 recording.\n\n\n=== Background ===\nSmith originally recorded the song in 2012 as her debut single. However, label officials encouraged her to release the song \"Provocative\" instead in 2013. After the song underperformed, Smith left the music industry. When asked about Brit Smith's version after receiving criticism online over \"stealing\" the song, Siwa stated that she \"didn't steal anything\" as \"people write songs and [....] don't do anything with them\", making sense for another artist \"a few years later\". She also said that she \"[doesn't] know who Brit Smith is\". Smith expressed her amazement at her version going viral, stating she was shocked that her song has now \"got a new life, which is amazing\".\n\n\n=== Composition ===\nSmith's version of the song was originally produced by Rock Mafia for the Miley Cyrus album Can't Be Tamed (2010). After Cyrus passed on it, Smith recorded the song to her liking. She then added more production to the song with Timbaland.\n\n\n=== Music video ===\nThe music video was directed by Marc Klasfeld, who also directed the video for Siwa's version. The shots of Smith and accompanying individuals were shot prior and the graphics were later added by Super77, an animation and design studio located in Columbus, Ohio. It features Smith at a church, club and in her bedroom as she attempts to get a man back after she is caught cheating. Although the original video was uploaded by Super77 as part of their portfolio to Vimeo on March 20, 2013 (a year after the video is said to be scraped), a re-upload of the music video caused a viral reaction across social media platforms such as Tiktok.\n\n\n=== Critical reception ===\nSmith's version of \"Karma\" garnered a positive reception online compared to Siwa's version, which was professionally released first. Smith's version received praise for its \"banging hook\" and production by Timbaland. \n\n\n=== Chart performance ===\nThe song peaked at number three on the U.S iTunes chart, placing higher than Siwa's recording which peaked at number 89 on the chart. In the United Kingdom, the song debuted and peaked at number 40 on the UK Singles Downloads Chart.\n\n\n=== Charts ===\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The paintings in the Contarelli Chapel form a group of three large-format canvases painted by Caravaggio between 1599 and 1602, initially commissioned by Cardinal Matteo Contarelli for the Church of St. Louis of the French (San Luigi dei Francesi) in Rome, and eventually honored after his death by his executors. The intervention of Cardinal Del Monte, Caravaggio's patron, was decisive in obtaining this contract, which was the most significant of the painter's young career when he was not yet 30. The works evoke three major stages in the life of the apostle Saint Matthew: his calling by Jesus Christ ( The Calling of St Matthew), his writing of the Gospel guided by an angel (The Inspiration of Saint Matthew), and his martyrdom (The Martyrdom of Saint Matthew). They are still preserved in the Church of St. Louis of the French.\nAlthough Caravaggio worked particularly fast, the canvases were installed slowly and in stages: first, the two side canvases representing the Calling and the Martyrdom were hung in 1600, then it was decided to add an altarpiece with the angel to replace an unsatisfactory statue; but this painting had to be redone as its first version was rejected. In 1603, the ensemble was finally definitively installed and met with great success, even if sometimes virulent criticism was voiced against its innovative aspects, in particular the naturalism of its painting and certain theological choices.\nThis was Caravaggio's first public commission, and his reputation grew considerably. Caravaggio's work became well-known in Roman painting circles and among the general public.\n\n\n== Context ==\n\n\n=== Art and religion in Rome ===\n\nThe Church of St. Louis of the French was built in Rome between the Pantheon and Piazza Navona in 1518, as a French property for French pilgrims to the papal city. The 70 years of its construction were marked by various episodes in the Wars of Religion that were then tearing Europe apart (including the St. Bartholomew's Day incident in 1572), anPapacy made a deliberate choice of Catholic religious propaganda: the conclusions of the Council of Trent, which ended in 1563, notably emphasized the crucial role of images in propagating the faith.\nThe reigns of Popes Sixtus V and Clement VIII (whose reign coincided with Caravaggio's stay in Rome: 1592-1605) were marked by lively artistic activity, in a context of a return to the Christian roots of pictorial art. The Académie de Saint-Luc was reborn in 1593, under the direction of Federico Zuccari. Cardinal Frederick Borromeo, an influential prelate, was initially its patron but became Archbishop of Milan in 1596, succeeded by Cardinal Francesco Maria del Monte and the elderly Cardinal Paleotti, a veteran of the Council of Trent and author of a treatise on art. This was a favorable period for official commissions, with a certain openness on the part of the clergy to new artistic forms: the successes of Jan Brueghel de Velours, Federico Barocci and Annibale Carracci testify to a marked tendency towards \"Art du vrai\", in particular in opposition to a certain form of Mannerism.\nRome was the home of the French prelate Matthieu Cointrel, whose name was commonly Italianized as Contarelli, as was customary at the time, and who attained the rank of cardinal in December 1583. Contarelli was a close associate of Pope Gregory XIII, who reigned from 1572 to 1585. Having made a substantial contribution to the financing of the Church of St. Louis of the French (in particular for the façade work), Contarelli designated a chapel for his burial, the first chapel to the left of the main altar, which he had acquired in 1565.\n\n\n=== Caravaggio's Ascension ===\n\nAfter receiving his initial training in Milan, Caravaggio arrived in Rome in the early 1590s, perhaps in the summer of 1592, aged around twenty. He passed through several studios, working on a variety of small-scale productions, including flowers and fruit. In the late 1590s, Cardinal del Monte discovered his paintings and took him under his protection: he even installed him under his roof in the Palazzo Madama, his official residence since 1589 as representative of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, Ferdinand I de' Medici. The Palazzo - today the seat of the Italian Senate - is located right next to the Church of St. Louis of the French. It is likely, however, that Caravaggio's home was in the Palazzo Firenzen, which del Monte used in addition to the Palazzo Madama: this building has underground rooms with skylights that let in daylight, which would be just what he needed for the series of paintings in the Contarelli chapel.\nDespite the success he was beginning to enjoy among art lovers, as evidenced by the cardinal's patronage, Caravaggio had not yet received any official commissions and had not produced any works with a religious theme: the Saint Matthew series was a novelty for him. The paintings in the Contarelli chapel were his first public commission. His success was so intense and immediate that, even before completing this commission, he received another, equally prestigious one from Tiberio Cerasi for the church of Santa Maria del Popolon.\n\n\n== Public orders ==\n\n\n=== Hesitation and delay ===\n\nShortly before he died in 1585, Contarelli chose the painter Girolamo Muziano to paint six scenes from the life of St. Matthew on the altarpiece, walls, and vault; but Muziano in turn died in 1592 without even having begun the work. The cardinal's heirs, Monsignor Melchior Crescenzi and his nephew Virgilio were therefore responsible for continuing the work: they chose to commission Giuseppe Cesari, alias the Cavalier d'Arpin. Cesari did indeed paint the fresco on the vault in 1593, as well as two others depicting the Miracle of St. Matthew and two groups of two prophets, but ultimately failed to supply any of the canvases also requested. He did, however, make a preparatory drawing for the Calling of St Matthieu, but went no further. In addition, a statue was commissioned in 1587 from the sculptor Jacob Cobaert to be placed above the altar but was not completed and installed until 1602.\nThe choice of commissioning canvases rather than decorative frescoes to decorate a Roman chapel is an innovation specific to the decade 1590-1600. There are only a few earlier examples in Rome: Muziano's paintings for the Basilica of Santa Maria d'Aracœli in Rome, for example, were produced between 1586 and 1589 and also depict scenes from the life of Saint Matthew. But this trend, new at the time, was destined to last.\nVirgilio Crescenzi died in 1592, and his executor was Cardinal Del Monte, a member of the Fabrique de Saint-Pierre, which directed and organized the work of the clergy in the Vatican: it is therefore likely, as Baglione, his first biographer, writes, that Del Monte convinced Melchior Crescenzi and François Cointrel (nephew of the late cardinal) to ask Caravaggio to decorate the side walls of the chapels. According to Bellori, his seventeenth-century biographer, Caravaggio even belonged to Monsignor Crescenzi's household on the recommendation of the Cavalier Marin (which is not attested elsewhere) and produced portraits of the two patrons (which have now disappeared). In this way, Del Monte was able both to boost his protégé's career and show his interest in France.\n\n\n=== Side panels ===\nCaravaggio was finally commissioned in 1599 when the church administrators decided to reopen the Contarelli chapel to worship. A contract dated July 23, 1599, provided for the payment of 400 ecus for the two side canvases, which were inaugurated barely a year later, in July of the Holy Year 1600: the Calling and the Martyrdom of St. Matthew, which were placed on either side of the altar. The completion of these two canvases was therefore particularly rapid.\n\n\n=== Altarpiece ===\n\nCobaert's statue, barely installed on the altar in 1602, was finally rejected by the Congregation of St. Louis; it was completed by another sculptor, Pompeo Ferrucci (the angel was missing), and then installed in another Roman church: the Santissima Trinità dei Pellegrini. In 1602, Caravaggio was commissioned to replace the Cobaert statue with an altarpiece depicting Saint Matthew and the Angel. This canvas was installed on May 26 of the same year, the day of Pentecost, but again rejected by the commissioners: Caravaggio immediately proposed another version, this time accepted and definitively installed in February 1603, in the center of the chapel lined with multicolored marble.\nThis proposal for an almost immediate second version of Matthew and the Angel is currently being put forward based on concordant documentary sources undermines Roberto Longhi's assertions on this subject in his seminal texts of the 1920s. For him, this crude, uncultivated Matthew was produced around 1592, eight years before Caravaggio reached \"maturity\" in 1600.\n\n\n=== Reception ===\nDespite Caravaggio's speed (including a second, radically different version of his St. Matthew and the Angel), two years elapsed between the installation of the two side canvases (1600) and the altar (1602), echoing the long delays in completing the building work. Tired of waiting for some thirty years, the church's priests harbored a certain resentment towards the Crescenzi family. In this tense context, it is possible that Caravaggio's radical choices for the last painting (The Inspiration of Saint Matthew) were very poorly received and led to a swift rejection. This is what his biographer Bellori tells us:\n\n\"(...) when he had finished the central painting of the Story of Matthew, and placed it on the altar, the priests had it removed on the pretext that the figure had neither the nobility nor the appearance of a saint, sitting as it was, legs crossed, rudely showing its feet to the people. Caravaggio despaired at such an insult to the first work he had done for a church (...)\".\nBaglione, a great adversary of Caravaggio, can't avoid testifying to the success of the works exhibited, but asserts that it is \"malicious people\" who are praising the paintings; He adds a note of perfidy by claiming that this success is only due to the proximity of the works of the Cavalier d'Arpin (on the vault, which is \"very well painted\"), and even accuses Caravaggio of swindling the Marquis Giustiniani by selling him the first Matthew and the Angel, the one that \"nobody had liked\". He also reports the words of the influential Federico Zuccari, who came to see the canvases and, \"laughing under his breath and marvelling at so much fuss\", declared that he could see in them nothing other than the thoughts of Giorgione, a painter who was certainly more than evident, but who had already disappeared almost a century earlier (in 1510): \"Io non ci vedo altro che il pensiero di Giorgione\".  The acid remarks of the eternal rival Baglione do not correspond to historical reality, which shows, on the contrary, that Caravaggio's success was considerable, and provided him with the opportunity of new commissions. Among his contemporary admirers, the painter Rubens closely observed Caravaggio's work for this chapel (and, even more so, that which he supplied for the Cerasi chapel) and probably used one of the figures from the Calling (the seated young man seen from behind) in various drawings.\nGérard-Julien Salvy points out that the naturalism at work in the paintings of the Contarelli chapel was bound to \"scandalize\" the Roman academic school of the time. He cites the critic Zolotov, who, in a 1979 article, sees in Zuccari an echo of the tension between the Roman school and the Lombardo-Venetian innovations carried by Caravaggio in his insistence \"on nature, on the picturesque element of nature\"; but for Salvy, contemporary admirers of Caravaggio's work must have been touched above all by the contemplative aspect and \"deep contemplation of the figures\" from which emerges \"a dramatic feeling expressed in a way other than through the forms of Roman rhetorical invention\".\nFrom a theological point of view, the rejection of the Matthew and the Angel as barefoot, dirty, and with coarse features can be explained by the apparent vulgarity of the character; but the very faithful depiction of the same Matthew as a tax collector in the Calling is potentially just as shocking since this literal accuracy is not in keeping with the spirit of the proponents of Roman academism either: Salvy speaks of a \"provocative and revolutionary orthodoxy\".\n\n\n=== Alternative hypothesis ===\nAlthough the replacement of the first Saint Matthew and the Angel by a second version is attested, doubts remain as to whether the first painting was rejected. For Caravaggio specialist Sybille Ebert-Schifferer, this does not sit well with the high esteem in which the painter was held at the time. According to her, the first painting was installed as early as 1599, but temporarily, pending the installation of the group sculpted by Cobaert (and thus before the two side paintings were completed). It was very well received, and Giustiniani acquired it at that time. The side paintings were then installed as planned, and Cobaert's statue arrived but was rejected: Caravaggio was then called in to propose a second The Inspiration of Saint Matthew, just as well received as the previous one. There is thus a historical confusion between the rejection of Cobaert's statue and that of Caravaggio's painting, a confusion perhaps intended by the rival Baglione. The critic Alfred Moir also finds this rejection implausible, and believes that \"this alleged refusal (...) hardly seems defensible.\"\nHowever, this is only a research hypothesis, and is not widely accepted.\n\n\n== Canvas ==\n\nThe paintings are presented here from left to right, according to the way they are arranged around the altar of the Contarelli chapel. This organization also follows the chronology of the story of St. Matthew, who is first called by Jesus, then writes his Gospel, and finally dies a martyr.\n\nIn The Calling on the left-hand wall, Christ appears alongside St. Peter on the right-hand side of the painting: he points to Matthew, then a tax official, who is sitting with various companions at a table where money is being counted, so that he will follow him and become one of his apostles. The central painting shows the same Matthew, older, writing his version of the Gospel: his handwriting is directed by an angel flying overhead, seemingly explaining or dictating its content. Finally, the painting on the right-hand wall depicts Matthew's death, assassinated in his church during a religious service and amid a motley crowd; an angel is also present, handing him the martyr's palm.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Saint Matthew ===\nThe original commissioner of the paintings, Cardinal Matteo Contarelli, bore the same name as the apostle St. Matthew: no coincidence, since the chapel was intended to house the cardinal's tomb, and thus to honor his memory. Matthew's story also appealed to the prelate, who wanted to associate his image with it: a publican by profession, and therefore in charge of tax collection in the Roman administration, he came from a high social class and, of all Christ's apostles, was the one who best-represented culture. As an evangelist, Matthew occupies a primordial place: the Catholic Church has given him first place in its liturgy. His hypothetical historical anteriority in the writing of the Gospels, however, has been hotly contested since the Griesbach hypothesis.\nThe apostle Matthew appears under this name only in the Gospel according to Matthew: he is shown seated at \"a toll booth\" where Jesus comes to fetch him; the Gospel according to Mark repeats the scene identically, but calls the character \"Levi\" (as does the Gospel according to Luke) and specifies that he is \"the son of Alphaeus\". This profession of tax collector was highly unpopular with the Jews, due to its proximity to the Roman power in whose name it was exercised. In each version of this story, Matthew/Levi immediately follows Christ, who calls him; Luke even specifies that he follows him \"leaving everything\". A meal is then organized by Matthew, bringing together \"publicans and sinners\", and Jesus, who is reproached for this, explains that he has not come to call the righteous, but sinners. This episode, in which Jesus calls Matthew, fits in well with the scene depicted in Caravaggio's Calling, even if many of its elements (setting, characters) are matters of interpretation or imagination.\n\nOn the other hand, the scene of the writing of the Gospel under the direction of an angel, followed by that of the martyrdom of Matthew, evangelizer of Ethiopia, are not found in any biblical text. However, Jacques de Voragine's Golden Legend recounts that Matthew was murdered for having opposed the love of the Ethiopian king Hirtacus for Iphigenia, the daughter of his predecessor.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Models and influences ===\n\nThe model for Matthew, who is logically depicted as getting older and older from one painting to the next, is probably the same one used in the Sacrifice of Isaac, and later in Saint Jerome in Meditation and the Incredulity of Saint Thomas. It is also credible that the elegant young man seen from behind in the Calling is painted after the same model as the angel in the Sacrifice of Isaac. The angel visiting Matthew could have the same features as Isaac in the Sacrifice, or the young John the Baptist with the ram, or Cupid in Amor Vincit Omnia. Mario Minniti, a Sicilian painter and friend of Caravaggio's, would be represented in the young man with a feathered hat in the center of the Calling, as well as in the left margin of the Martyrdom, still wearing a feathered hat, as perhaps in one of the two versions of the Fortune Teller and the Lute Player.\nOther figures are more anonymous, but no less identifiable with known sources. The executioner and the nudes in the Martyrdom, like the figures in Annibale Carracci's frescoes in the Farnese Palace, echo the nudes on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel; Christ's hand in the Calling even seems to be a direct quotation of Adam's in Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam. There are also references to northern Italian painters, such as Titian, from whom Caravaggio takes a well-known figure for the acolyte on the right of the Martyrdom, or Savoldo, who accentuates the breadth of his figures' gestures; on the other hand, Caravaggio seems to distance himself from the influence of Raphael.\n\n\n== Artistic choices ==\n\n\n=== Composition ===\n\nCaravaggio's commission was new for him in more ways than one: apart from the fact that it was his first official commission with a religious theme, he also had to create large-format canvases, incorporating more figures than in his previous paintings. He therefore opted for a new solution, in the tradition of Leonardo da Vinci's chiaroscuro, \"drowning\" a large part of the painting's surface in dense shadow and brutally lighting his figures. For Mina Gregori, this choice of high-contrast lighting in the two side paintings represents a major transformation in her pictorial approach, compared with the transparency of her earlier works: it enables her to achieve a solid effect of relief and volume. Bellori had already spotted this intention in the 17th century when he noted that the effect of focusing the light made it possible to \"draw more force from the vehemence of chiaroscuro\".\nThe choice of lighting sources is directly linked to the installation of the paintings in the chapel: the Calling, on the left, receives light from above and to the right, while the Martyrdom, on the right, is lit from the opposite direction, and the central painting with the angel is lit from above. Everything is done to give the impression that it is the chapel's central window that illuminates the paintings in this way, even though it provides very little light and the chapel is particularly dark; Bellori also notes this constraint, adding criticism of the painter's color choices: \"the darkness of the chapel and the color rob [the Calling and the Martyrdom] from view.\"\nThe composition of the works responds to the double constraint of integrating them into the space of the chapel while at the same time linking them together. The figures in the two side canvases are therefore all depicted on the same scale; furthermore, the two paintings share an identical horizon line, which passes through the eyes of Christ in the Calling and those of the executioner in the Martyrdom; the position of the paintings forces us to perceive these lines with a distortion that further accentuates their dramatic effect. The location of the chapel, at the end of the nave and to the left, means that on entering, the viewer first encounters the Martyrdom, whose depth and breadth are an extension of the space of the church; but as he or she enters the chapel, the delineated space of the Calling painting echoes the impression of constriction he or she may experience there. These elements of context were certainly carefully considered by Caravaggio, who at the time had only the street to cross to get from his studio in Palazzo Madama to the church of San Luigi dei Francesi.\n\n\n=== Redesigns ===\n\nAs there are no known preparatory drawings by Caravaggio's hand, only scientific analysis allows us to understand the stages and possible modifications during the execution of his paintings. No underlying drawings are detectable, but incisions are visible on the surface of the canvas, undoubtedly marked with the handle of the brush and providing reference points in the composition (for example, on the outline of the right calf of Matthew with the angel).\nBut an X-ray study carried out in 1952 by art historian Lionello Venturi shows that beneath the painting of the Martyrdom lie several sketched figures that the painter ultimately chose to replace or modify and that these figures (more numerous than in the definitive version) are relatively small in size. Caravaggio would have executed the Calling after this first version of the Martyrdom; then he would have taken over and corrected various elements of the Martyrdom to simplify its composition and to better match the size of his figures to those of the other painting. As for the Calling, X-rays reveal fewer modifications: the most evident, however, is that Christ was initially alone and that the apostle Peter only appeared alongside him at a later stage.\n\n\n=== Pigments ===\nCaravaggio's typical techniques and palette can already be seen in these works from the Roman period. The dark backgrounds are composed of lead white and lots of vegetable black, red ochre, and umber; the rest of the palette is fairly limited: yellow and red ochre, cinnabar, verdigris, and madder lacquer enable him to obtain some fifteen shades ranging from the warmest of the Calling to the coolest of the Martyrdom, and thus meeting the dramatic needs of the painted scenes. It is possible that the choice of hues also depended on the tones of the surrounding colored marble.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCaravaggio\nList of paintings by Caravaggio\nCaravaggisti\nPainting portalBible portalItaly portal\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\nJaubert, Alain (1998).

        "content": "The Hełm wz. 2000 is a combat helmet used by the Polish Army. Withdrawn in favor of the wz. 2005 helmet.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe helmet was developed based on the German Schubert helmet. It has a characteristic shape of a green shell with black rubber rim. The internal equipment is based on a profiled rim with a so-called hammock. The sweatband is made of black leather (similar to the wz. 93 helmet). It was attached to the supporting hoop with Velcro. The suspension bands are black. The ballistic resistance of the helmet is at the level of general military helmets of this type (>610 m/s). The main disadvantage of the wz. 2000 is limited compatibility with helmet-mounted night vision devices according to NATO rules.\nThe wz. 2000 helmet can be fitted with cloth helmet covers in wz. 93 Pantera camoflauge pattern (woodland and desert version) or blue cover intended for UN forces. \nIn addition to the basic version, a version for aeromobile forces was developed (an additional rear leather cushion was inserted inside the helmet) and an optionally mounted face shield.\n\nThe main producers of helmets were RESAL and Maskpol.\n\n\n== Users ==\n Poland\n Ukraine\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Books ===\n(in Polish) Kijak J., Hełmy Wojska Polskiego 1917-2000, Wydawnictwo Bellona, Warsaw 2004, ISBN 83-11-09636-8.",

        "content": "Leslie Martinez (born 1985, McAllen, Texas) is a visual artist working primarily with abstract painting. Martinez's textured compositions complicate the use of color in art history to touch on issues of gender, queerness, migration, citizenship, and identity. The artist lives and works in Dallas, Texas.\n\n\n== Early life and Education ==\nLeslie Martinez was born in the Rio Grande Valley of the South Texas-Mexico border, precisely between the cities of La Grulla and La Victoria, and raised in Dallas, Texas, where the artist current lives and work. Martinez has a twin sister, and while at school, they attended an arts magnet high school using their childhood bedroom as a studio at the time. \nMartinez holds an MFA from Yale School of Art (2018), New Haven, and a BFA from Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art (2008), New York. \n\n\n== Work ==\nLeslie Martinez was an Artist-in-Residence between 2018-2019 at the Museum of Contemporary Art Tucson, Arizona, where they start experimenting with larger canvases.   \nMartinez solo exhibition Century in Strata was on view at the Commonwealth and Council, in Los Angeles over summer 2023. In an recent interview, Martinez mentions Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza, the work of writer and queer theorist Gloria E. Anzaldúa as influential to her artistic development. \nThe Blaffer Art Museum at the University of Houston, presented Leslie Martinez: The Secrecy of Water in 2023. The paintings in this solo presentation addressed periods of severe drought in Texas state and other United States regions in 2022 as well as the emotional burden caused by the political climate around border control.   \nIn 2023, the MoMA PS1, in Queens, presented Leslie Martinez: The Fault of Formation, the artist's first major institutional solo exhibition in New York. The show featured recent paintings and three large-scale works commissioned by the museum for this multi-gallery presentation. The paintings pallet, and the newly created body of work in the PS1 show, relate to the CMYK color model (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black) often used by the artist in their abstract compositions. The exhibition was organized by Costa Rican curator Elena Ketelsen González and it was on view until spring 2024. In conjunction with the exhibition, Leslie Martinez sat down in conversation with writer and critic Raquel Gutiérrez, author of Brown Neon (2022), for a public program.   \nThe Speed Art Museum presented the two-person show Current Speed: Angel Otero/Leslie Martinez, in 2023. Martinez presented their work alongside fellow abstract painter and Puerto Rican-born contemporary artist Angel Otero.\n\n\n=== Awards ===\nIn 2022, the artist was granted a United States Latinx Art Forum’s Latinx Artist Fellowship. \n\n\n=== Artistic Practice ===\nMartinez's abstract and large-scale paintings incorporate untraditional materials such as towels, cloths, used clothing, and even ashes to comment on border crossing issues, geographies, and gender identity. Their color schemes often reference the CMYK color model (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black).  \n\n\n== Collections ==\nThe work of Leslie Martinez is in the collections of Pérez Art Museum Miami, Florida; Dallas Museum of Art, Texas; High Museum of Art, Atlanta; and the Speed Art Museum, Louisville; Los Angeles County Museum of Art, California; the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:1985 births\nCategory:People from McAllen, Texas\nCategory:21st-century American artists\nCategory:21st-century American painters\nCategory:Cooper Union alumni\nCategory:Artists from Dallas\nCategory:Yale School of Art alumni",

The Saint John of the Mountain Festival is held here every year.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nNatura 2000 code:SPA: ES4120095\nSAC: ES4120095Climate: Continental Mediterranean\nArea: 3.633,03 ha.\nAltitude:Minimum: -\nAverage: 678 m\nMaximum: ± 1000 mThe mountains have an average altitude of 678 meters above sea level. The highest areas present escarpments and reach, in certain points, around 1,000 meters above sea level. The affected population centers are Ameyugo, Bugedo, Miranda de Ebro, and Pancorbo.The greatest risk and vulnerability factors in the Mountains of Miranda de Ebro and Ameyugo are the risks of forest fires, urban development pressure and public-use pressure, and the installation of wind farms, such as the Burgos wind farms.\n\n\n=== Natural Area for Recreation ===\nThe landscape of the Mountains of Miranda de Ebro and Ameyugo covers a vast expanse of approximately 3,600 hectares, although only a small part has been declared a zona natural de esparcimiento. It is in this area where the Saint John of the Mountain Festival takes place and where there are numerous huts to provide shelter to groups on the Monday of Pentecost. In addition, there are various public facilities here, such as parking lots, drinking fountains, toilets, children's playgrounds, etc.\nThe Monte de Miranda is the main natural leisure area available to the people of Miranda de Ebro during the year. It is not uncommon to see people practicing sports such as hiking or cycling. In fact, the climb to the peak of San Juan del Monte is one of the usual final stages during the Vuelta a Burgos race. The rear access road is a short third category pass in which the last ramps exceed 9% on average and with maximums of 14%.\n\n\n=== Flora ===\nThe high-altitude vegetation is composed of grasslands and oak groves. In the middle zone of the mountainous elevations there are abundant shrubby and wooded areas with bushes, oakwood, evergreen oak forests, and pine groves. This remains constant until one reaches the Ebro Valley.Downstream from Miranda de Ebro to the provincial boundary with Álava and La Rioja, there are still some fairly well preserved gallery forests. Rivers and streams have created deep ravines, while in the rich lowland area of the Ebro river there are crops and orchards.The area is in an exceptional state of conservation with sabinares of Phoenicean juniper (Juniperus phoenicea) as well as boxwood (Buxus sempervirens).\n\n\n=== Fauna ===\nThere were 159 pairs of Eurasian griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus) in 2005. Moreover, this is one of the few places in Castile and León where Bonelli's Eagles (Aquila fasciata) are present, with two pairs in 2005.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGeography of Miranda de Ebro\nMiranda de Ebro\nComarca del Ebro\nSpecial Area of Conservation\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMap of the area on the Junta of Castile and León website",

        "content": "Dora Jeannette Turner was born at Cape Portland in Tasmania in 1888. She became an educationist associated with Tasmania's first special school that was later renamed to be the Dora Turner School.\n\n\n== Life ==\nTurner was born in 1888. Her parents were Mary Louisa (born Ikin) and her husband George Arthur Turner who worked in a bank. Turner's education was at Devonport Primary school (that is still in operation) and Launceston High School. She worked as an assisted teacher until she gained her own certificate at Hobart Teachers' Training College in 1909. She then worked at several different primary schools.\nIn 1924 she came to notice when she was appointed as an experienced primary teacher to lead the new Girls' Welfare School. The school had eight female pupils who had been identified as benefitting from a special education by the Tasmanian Department of Education. The school had one classroom and a kitchen and it had been provided at the instigation of the education department's school psychologist, H.T.Parker. However the history of the school is considered to be strongly linked to Turner's career. The girls were aged between twelve and sixteen and were said to be \"backward and feeble minded\". The girls learned primarily about domestic science and there was no stated attempt to made them independent, but Turner was noted for emphasising self-reliance.\nBy 1930 there were 22 girls in the school which had moved to Mather House in Murray Street in Hobart. Mather house had two floors and on the upper floor Dora lived with her sister Mary who  was also a teacher.\nShe retired in 1951 and died in 1953. In December 1954 after thirty years of operation the Girls' Welfare School was renamed the Dora Turner School. It was announced by a former director of the Tasmanian Department of Education, G.V.Brooks, and a portrait of Turner was placed in the school in recognition of her role in starting the school for \"educatable retarded\" pupils. In 1955 the school became co-educational. Its building in Hampden Road was destroyed by a fire in 1970 but the Dora Turner School had moved to new premises in 1969.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBiography at ADB",

        "content": "The Yingtian Gate(Traditional Chinese: 應天門; Simplified Chinese: 应天门) was the main southern gate of the imperial palace in the city of Luoyang during the Sui and Tang dynasties, and it may have been the largest city gate in ancient China. It was originally built in 605 AD, the first year of the Daye era of the Sui dynasty, and was initially named the Zetian Gate(則天門). In 705 AD, the first year of the Shenlong era, the gate's name was changed to Yingtian Gate to avoid the naming taboo of Empress Wu Zetian. The gate was destroyed during the Northern Song dynasty and was reconstructed at its original site in 2016.\nThe Yingtian Gate served as a ceremonial and celebratory venue for the Sui, Tang, and Wuzhou dynasties under Empress Wu Zetian's rule. Emperor Gaozong of Tang once issued an edict here to release King Uija of Baekje, and Empress Wu Zetian ascended to the throne and declared herself emperor at this location. The emperors also received foreign envoys, such as the Japanese envoys to Sui and Tang, at the Yingtian Gate.\n\n\n== Reconstruction ==\nThe reconstruction project cost approximately 350 million yuan (RMB) and was designed by architect Guo Daiheng. The city gate stands 120 Chinese feet tall (equivalent to 35 meters today), has a depth of 25 meters, and is situated on a 9.2-meter-high base. The base measures 137 meters in width from east to west and has a north–south depth of 60 meters. The base houses a museum that showcases the ancient ruins of the Yingtian Gate. After its reconstruction, the Yingtian Gate serves as a city landmark and features a public square where citizens can visit and relax.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Helen Kirk (1827–1895) was a 19th-century Scotch reformer, temperance worker, juvenile magazine editor, and religious writer. She was the first President of the Edinburgh Ladies Prayer Union as well as the President of the Young Women's Gospel Mission. She was intimately associated with the leaders of the Women's Temperance movement in Great Britain and the United States, and was a regular contributor to the press. She was author of numerous tracts and pamphlets, and for 40 years, editor of Dewdrops (juvenile monthly).\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHelen Bruce was born at Dunblane, Perthshire, December 27, 1828.\nWhen a child at home, her father removed from a cottage home into a two storied house, which he converted into a public house, and despite all his own and his wife's efforts, sights and scenes were enacted before the children which they ought not to have witnessed. When about 12 years of age, Helen became the subject of serious religious impressions which were strengthened, and culminated in her conversion while on a visit to her brother at Edinburgh. On her return home, she frankly told her parents that she could no longer sell liquors.\n\n\n== Career ==\nWith the assistance of the Rev. John Kirk, of Edinburgh, she secured the position of assistant to the matron of the Paisley prison. After some time, she returned to Dunblane and engaged in Sunday school teaching and prison mission work.\nIn 1851, she united with the Edinburgh Total Abstinence Society.\nShe also became editor of the Dew Drop that year. It was a juvenile temperance monthly, in which capacity she served for 40 years. In the following year, she published an anonymous pamphlet on the water cure, in which she taught mothers that they should rear children without strong drink.\nShe was a member of the United Kingdom Alliance, and assisted that organization in a number of its canvassing campaigns. In 1859, she was chosen first president of the Edinburgh Ladies Prayer Union, which office she held for many years. In the following year, she commenced giving Gospel addresses to women. Her Women's Prayer was published in 1861. About that time, she came out strongly against the use of fermented wine at the Communion service.\nKirk held a number of offices in social reform organizations. She was secretary of the Scottish Women's Sabbath Alliance, projector of the Dewdrop Anti-Narcotic Union (formed in 1871 to educate children against tobacco and strong drink, but which was finally succeeded by the Juvenile Templar Order), treasurer of the Edinburgh Branch of the British Women's Temperance Association, and president of the Young Women's Gospel Mission.\nIn 1873 she wrote, at the request of the editor of the Christian World, \"An Appeal on Behalf of British Women Against the Use of Tobacco\".\nDuring the early days of the Good Templar Order (IOGT) in Scotland, Kirk affiliated herself with that organization, and upon the institution of the Grand Lodge of Scotland was elected a representative from Edinburgh. In 1874, she was placed upon the Juvenile Templars’ Executive Committee of the Grand Lodge, and in 1875, she was elected Grand Worthy Vice Templar, being reelected to that position in 1876. In the latter year, she was chosen a representative to the Right Worthy Grand Lodge of the World, which body elected her Right Worthy Grand Vice Templar in 1877.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn January 1851, she married Rev. Kirk and immediately entered into religious and social service work. He served an apprenticeship to a blacksmith, then became a divinity student, and afterwards a popular minister of the Independent or Congregational Church. He was the author of several religious and temperance works, and wrote many articles and papers in support of the principles and policy of the United Kingdom Alliance, when it met with bitter opposition and was grossly misrepresented by certain pseudo temperance leaders in Scotland. He was one of the originators and for over 25 years, editor of the Christian News. He was an ardent supporter of Bands of Hope, the IOGT, and was the first Grand Chaplain of Scotland.\nShe died in Edinburgh April 11, 1895, aged 66 years.\n\n\n== Selected works ==\n1851–, The Dew-Drop, a monthly magazine for the young (1859, 1866)\n1861, Woman and prayer\n\n\n== References ==",

It premiered at Broadway's Garden Theatre on February 5, 1901. It closed in June 1901 after 135 performances. The original production was produced by Charles Frohman and David Belasco. Belasco also directed the play which starred Campbell Gollan as the Marquis of Chateauroy, Francis Carlyle as Bertie Cecil, and Blanche Bates as Cigarette.\nA. Baldwin Sloane's musical burlesque The King's Carnival, which was mounted at the Olympia Theatre while Under Two Flags was still playing at the Garden Theatre, was a parody of courtly dramas of that period. It spoofed several plays, including Potter's Under Two Flags.\nPotter's play was the basis for the 1915 silent film Under Two Flags by director Travers Vale for which Potter was a credited screenwriter.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nBraff, Richard E.

        "content": "The Paragould Southeastern Railway (“PSR”), originally the Paragould and Buffalo Island Railway, was an industrial line initially started to carry timber products from lands east of Paragould, Arkansas, into town.  It acquired its first trackage in 1887, and eventually extended its line to Blytheville, Arkansas, over 37 miles from Paragould.  The trackage was absorbed into the St. Louis Southwestern Railway, known as the “Cotton Belt,”  in 1914.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Paragould and Buffalo Island Railway ===\nThe city of Paragould was in a lumbering area, and the need was for a rail line to bring logs to the mills located there.  The Paragould Stave Manufacturing Company built a tramway east from Paragould, the line being about 4 miles long, narrow-gauge, and reputedly laid with wooden rails.\nThe Paragould and Buffalo Island Railway was incorporated October 11, 1887.  It acquired the tramway that month, and in 1888 extended it about 4 miles to Bertig, Arkansas.  To avoid construction problems in the swampy areas around the St. Francis River bottoms, the line was built upon the 40-mile long by 15-mile wide sandy ridge known as Buffalo Island located in Craighead and Mississippi counties in Arkansas.\n\n\n=== Name change and extension ===\nBecause of foreclosure on a local mill in 1888, the line was inactive for a time.  However, the owners persuaded the Cotton Belt to furnish them with thirty-five pound steel rails and a narrow gauge locomotive to run on them.  In 1893, due to a charter amendment, the name of the railroad was changed to the Paragould Southeastern Railway, the tracks were widened to standard-gauge, and the line was extended to Cardwell, Missouri, about 2 additional miles.   A charter amendment dated August 12, 1897, allowed extension of the line to Hornersville, Missouri, about 11 miles, which was done by October 25, 1897.   A charter change on December 11, 1901, authorized a final extension to Blytheville, Arkansas.  However, the line was not actually extended from Hornersville to Chickasawba, Arkansas, about 15 miles, until April 5, 1903; and, the final mile from Chickasawba to Blytheville was not completed until January 27, 1907.  At that point, the railroad had a single-track mainline totaling 37.335 miles.\n\n\n=== Cotton Belt ===\nThe Cotton Belt had obtained control of the PSR back on May 27, 1893.  However, the PSR continued to operate independently until leased to the Cotton Belt on January 1, 1914, after which it was operated as just another part of the Cotton Belt.\n\n\n== References ==",

It originally aired on March 11, 2013.\n\n\n== Episode ==\n\nFor the episode's mini-challenge, the contestants \"read\" (or playfully insult) each other. Alaska wins the mini-challenge.\nFor the main challenge, the contestants perform a roast of RuPaul, the judges, and each other in front of a live audience.\nLeslie Jordan and Jeffrey Moran are guest judges. Alaska, Coco Montrese, and Jinkx Monsoon receive positive critiques, and Coco Montrese wins the challenge. Alyssa Edwards, Ivy Winters, and Roxxxy Andrews receive negative critiques, and Ivy Winters is deemed safe. Alyssa Edwards and Roxxxy Andrews place in the bottom and face off in a lip-sync to \"Whip My Hair\" (2010) by Willow Smith. They are both declared the winners of the lip-sync and no one is eliminated from the competition.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nOliver Sava of The A.V. Club gave the episode a rating of 'A'. Michelle Visage considered the performance among her favorites, as of 2022. In 2022, Bernardo Sim of Out magazine called the lip-sync \"iconic\". Writing for Pride.com in 2023, Sim said the lip-sync was the season's best. Stephen Daw included the performance in Billboard's similar list in 2024. \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ossetia – Liberty Square was a political party in the from the partially recognized Caucasian Republic of South Ossetia, which most of the UN recognizes as part of Georgia, occupied by Russia. The party was established by longtime opposition figure, Alla Dzhioyeva, when her victory in the 2011 presidential election was annulled.\n\n\n== History ==\nAt the party's founding congress on May 17, 2012, the party outlined themselves as pro-administration, at the time meaning pro-Tibilov, who won the 2012 presidential election due to the invalidation of Dzhioyeva. The party stated that their express goal was the promotion of political, economic, social reforms on a vaguely anti-establishment platform. Tibilov fostered the creation of several smaller political parties to support his presidency, the most famous of which is Nykhaz, with each of them hoping he would eventually join their party, although he chose to remain independent. The founding congress also stated that the party was built upon \"professional\" and \"patriotic\" individuals and adopted district heads, a logo, and anthem. The party saw support from Dzhambolat Tedeyev, who attended the founding congress, although he never officially joined the party. Also attending the opening congress, and congratulating the party, was Stanislav Kochiev, the longtime head of the Communist Party of South Ossetia, Yuri Dzitssuty, then vice-speaker of the Parliament of South Ossetia, and Tarzan Kokoiti, an MP for the Unity Party.\nOssetia – Liberty Square was officially registered as a political party on September 5, 2012, by Dzhioyeva as a continuation of the nearly year long protest her and her supporters initiated when the Supreme Court of South Ossetia invalidated her election as president in 2011.\nDzhioyeva was the education minister of Eduard Kokoity from 2002 to 2008 when she was fired and arrested for fraud and official misconduct and was sentenced to a 24-month suspension and a fine of ₽120,000. Due to this she was seen as a surrogate vote for Kokoity's opponents in 2011, after Kokoity resigned due to his willingness to be open to a rapprochement from the Georgian government, coupled with the legal ambiguity on his ability to run for a third term. Dzhioyeva had been a vocal opponent of Kokoity since her firing.\nThe party is largely a political vehicle for Dzhioyeva's own positions, which center around the political and economic self-sufficiency of South Ossetia. One of the first positions they took was the promotion of a special commission to investigate police officers for abuses of power. Dzhioyeva would go on to be named Tibilov's deputy prime-minister for social affairs in 2012, serving in the capacity until she quit in 2014, largely retiring from politics, although the party was never formally disestablished, with Dzhioyeva using it to organize support for a few key issues and to denounce scandals.\nDzhioyeva would come out of her soft-retirement, merging Ossetia – Liberty Square into Nykhaz in time for the 2019 parliamentary election, where Dzhioyeva would be elected to parliament on Nykhaz's list.\n\n\n== References ==",

When Great Comet transferred to the Imperial Theatre, singer-songwriter Josh Groban took over the role of Pierre and Stangland became the standby. However, later in the run, he took over the role for a temporary stint in between the runs of Okieriete Onaodowan and the show's creator, Dave Malloy.\n\n\n== Acting credits ==\n\n\n=== Theatre ===\nSource:\n\n\n=== Filmography ===\nSource:\n\n\n== References ==",

A former driver stated that the company's fleet is an \"absolute disaster\". Next to that in October 2023, a bus driver was caught driving under influence of alcohol with 2.4 per mille of alcohol in his blood.\n\n\n== Investigation ==\nPassengers told German media that the two drivers had an agreement just before the accident.The day after the accident it was announced the German Public Prosecution Service started an investigation into the 62-years-old driver of the bus. Justice accuses the driver of unintentional manslaughter and causing bodily harm through negligence.Five days after the accident the head of bus company Umbrella Mobility responded to the accident and blamed the passengers who were killed because they were not wearing their seat belts.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"Let Me Try Again\" is a 1973 song with lyrics by Paul Anka, Sammy Cahn and Michel Jourdan.\nIt is the English-language version of \"Laisse-moi le temps\" (\"Give me some time\") originally written by Romuald Figuier and Caravelli to lyrics by Jourdan. Romauld had represented France with the song in the XIV International Song Festival in Viña del Mar, Chile, coming in second place.\nShortly afterward, Anka bought the rights to the song, setting English lyrics with Sammy Cahn. It first appeared in the Frank Sinatra album Ol' Blue Eyes Is Back, which was issued in October 1973.\nThe Sinatra version was released as a single, and although it did well in some European markets, it did not chart elsewhere. Sinatra later re-recorded it as part of the live album, The Main Event - Live. In all Sinatra performances the song is credited with its original title, as \"Let Me Try Again (Laisse Moi le Temps)\".\nThe song has since become a standard, performed and recorded by artists as diverse as Peabo Bryson, Joe Longthorne, Tammy Jones, Vera Lynn, Lena Martell and Anka himself.\nIn 1977, Anka gave permission to Jerry Lewis to alter the lyrics as part of his performance of the song at that year's MDA Telethon.\n\n\n== External links ==\nVersion list at Secondhand Songs",

She is married to the actor Martin May and has two daughters. She lives in Hamburg.\n\n\n== Work ==\nWellershoff studied psychology. From 2002 to 2015, she was head of the editorial department of Kulturspiegel, the now discontinued culture supplement of the news magazine Der Spiegel.

It borders the unitary authority areas of Monmouthshire and Torfaen to the east, Caerphilly to the west and Powys to the north. Its main towns are Abertillery, Brynmawr, Ebbw Vale and Tredegar. It covers an area of 109 km2 (42 sq mi) and in 2023 the population was approximately 66,993. \nThe Cadw/ICOMOS Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales was established in 2002 and given statutory status in 2022. It is administered by Cadw, the historic environment agency of the Welsh Government.  It includes just under 400 sites, ranging from gardens of private houses, to cemeteries and public parks. Parks and gardens are listed at one of three grades, matching the grading system used for listed buildings. Grade I is the highest grade, for sites of exceptional interest; Grade II*, the next highest, denotes parks and gardens of more than special interest; while Grade II denotes nationally important sites of special interest.\nBlaenau Gwent has only one site on the register, the grounds of Bedwellty House in Tredegar. These are listed at Grade II.\n\n\n== List of parks and gardens ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of scheduled monuments in Blaenau Gwent\nGrade II* listed buildings in Blaenau Gwent\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Randy Van Zant (born August 11, 1957) is an American former professional stock car racing driver who has previously competed in the ARCA Re/Max Series.\n\n\n== Racing career ==\nVan Zant's interest in racing began when he was frequently around a family friend's USAC sprint car racing team as a child. His career would not being however until 1986, where he formed a street stock team, and won track championships between 1987 and 1988. Other members of the crew also drove in street stock competition in car that were built by Van Zant, and the team accomplished five track championships. Van Zant moved to late models in 1989, and he ran on and off races for Haupt up until 1997.\nIn 1998, Van Zant made his ARCA Bondo/Mar-Hyde Series debut at Salem Speedway, driving the No. 32 Pontiac for Jerry Haupt, where he started in 22nd and finished in ninth place, albeit five laps down behind race winner Frank Kimmel. He then made four more starts across the year, finishing in the top-twenty in all races. In 1999, he ran eleven races, finishing in the top-ten twice with a best finish of ninth at Kil-Kare Speedway, and finished runner-up in the rookie of the year standings behind Ron Cox. From 2000 to 2001, he only finished in the top-ten one in sixteen starts, a sixth place at Memphis Motorsports Park in 2001.\nIn 2002, Van Zant and Haupt planned on running all short-track events, and potentially up to four superspeedway races, although they only ran the short-track events, getting a best finish of fourth in his first start of the year at Salem. He then earned two top-five finishes the following year in 2003, a fourth place at Winchester Speedway and a fifth at Salem, and finished twentieth in points despite running only nine races that year.\nIn 2004, Van Zant attempted to make his NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series debut at Mansfield Motorsports Park, driving the No. 83 Ford for fellow ARCA competitor Greg Sarff, but ultimately failed to qualify due to qualifying being cancelled. He also made only six ARCA races that year, getting a best finish of sixth at the DuQuoin State Fairgrounds dirt track. In 2005, Van Zant left Haupt to run five races between entries fielded by Bobby Gerhart Racing, James Hylton Motorsports, and Darrell Basham Racing, and got a best finish of tenth in his final race of the year at Salem. It was also during this year that he attempted to make two races in the Hooters Pro Cup Series, failing to qualify for both events at Indianapolis Raceway Park and Kil-Kare. Van Zant then attempted only three ARCA races in 2006, finishing tenth at Winchester, failing to qualify at Toledo Speedway, and finishing thirteenth at Berlin Raceway. The Berlin event is his most recent event as a driver, as he has not competed in the series since then.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nVan Zant graduated from Trotwood-Madison High School in 1975, and is the father of three children.\n\n\n== Motorsports results ==\n\n\n=== NASCAR ===\n(key) (Bold – Pole position awarded by qualifying time.

She then studied singing for six years and took music and ballet lessons. She took part in five international festivals and released several single records in the 1960s, initially under the stage name Mariett Sora, including Wenn Du gehst, mon ami and Ohne dich together with Hubert Wolf.\nIn 1969, Pascal's first long-playing record, Kontraste, was released. At the beginning of the 1970s, she had some commercial success with chanson-like songs, which were also played in the hit parades. Her greatest successes were Das war ein Leben, Raskolnikoff (1969), Wie das Glas in meiner Hand (1971), Drei Schritte vor und zwei zurück (1972) and Ich bin ein Morgenmuffel (1979). Noteworthy was her concept album Das Paradies ist noch nicht verloren (1974), on which she dealt with environmental protection and pollution and their consequences in 14 songs. The patron of the work was the then Federal Minister of the Interior, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, who also wrote the foreword on the back of the LP cover.\nFrom the 1980s onwards, Pascal worked primarily as a radio presenter and author. Her programs included: portraits of composers and artists on HR 4, the ARD-Nachtxpress of HR and from 1991 on  WDR 4 the program Café Carlton, which was discontinued at the end of 2006 after a program reform, and the Schellack-Schätzchen, which she presented several times a year until the beginning of 2012.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nGoldene Europa 1969\nHonorary Award of the Federal Ministry of the Interior for Environmental Protection LP 1974\nEnvironmentalMedal of the Bavarian State Ministry 1974\n\n\n== Successful titles ==\nDrei Schritte vor und zwei zurück 1972\nIch bin ein Morgenmuffel 1979\nDas war ein Leben 1969\nSo war Ivan 1970\nWie das Glas in meiner Hand 1971\nWie schön ist doch mein Dorf gewesen 1979\nMorgens um sieben ist die Welt noch in Ordnung 1974\nZugeben 1979\n\n\n== Discography ==\nPetra Pascal has released twelve albums in her career, two CDs and 20 singles, among others:\n\n\n== Singles ==\n1965: Wenn du gehst, mon ami / Ohne dich\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n1969: Kontraste\n1970: Petra Pascal\n1971: Wenn der Abendwind durch die Taiga weht\n1971: Like the glass in my hand\n1972: I am a woman\n1974: Paradise is not yet lost\n1975: The Two Sides of Michael \"M\"\n1979: Admitted\n1985: Das Schachspiel unsres Lebens\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\n1973: Treffpunkt Stars\n1974: Portrait eines Stars\n1993: Die großen Erfolge\n2004: Wie das Glas in meiner Hand - Kontraste (Leico music)\n2008: Ich bin eine Frau - Kontraste II (Leico music)\n2009: Frohsein ist kein Risiko - Kontraste III (Leico music)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Gholamhossein Yousefi (Persian: غلامحسین یوسفی; January 23, 1928 - December 5, 1990) was a distinguished writer, translator, proofreader, and Iranian professor of Persian literature.\n\n\n== Life and Education ==\nGholamhossein Yousefi was born in January 1928 in Mashhad. After completing his primary and secondary education in 1946, he relocated from Mashhad to Tehran to pursue further studies in Persian language and literature. In 1951, at the age of 24, he earned his doctorate in Persian language and literature while simultaneously obtaining a bachelor's degree in judicial and political law from Tehran University Law School. Following the establishment of the Faculty of Literature at Ferdowsi University of Mashhad in 1955, he began teaching literature history courses at this institution. Additionally, he served as the director of teacher training in Khorasan. Until his retirement in 1979, Yousefi continued to impart knowledge through undergraduate and doctoral courses at Ferdowsi University. Notably, one of his specialized endeavors was the correction of old texts, contributing significantly to Iranian literature. He also embarked on research trips to France, England, and America. Yousefi passed away in 1990 at the age of 63 due to a heart attack and was laid to rest next to the tomb of Ali Ibn Musa al-Reza.\n\n\n== Opinions about Yousefi ==\nSeveral scholars have expressed their admiration for Gholamhossein Yousefi's contributions. Iraj Afshar commended Yousefi's scientific integrity, describing him as a modest scholar passionate about Iranian knowledge and humanity's place within it, a rare combination of virtues. Bahauddin Khorramshahi  praised Yousefi's meticulous proofreading of Golestan Saadi, labeling it as exemplary work. Furthermore, Mohammad Mahdi Naseh, a prominent professor of Persian literature who was once a student of Yousefi, lauded him as a genuine educator deeply invested in his students' academic growth. Naseh highlighted Yousefi's dedication to teaching, ensuring no moment in the classroom was squandered and emphasizing the importance of studying relevant sources and references alongside the curriculum.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Lore Uphoff-Schill (born August 18, 1890 - Düsseldorf as Leonore Henriette Schill,  January 28, 1968 - Worpswede) was a German painter of the Düsseldorfer Schule and the Worpswede painters' colony.\n\n\n== Life ==\nLore Schill was born in 1890 as the fourth child of the Düsseldorf art professor Adolf Schill and his wife Emmy Simons (* 1858). His birthplace was Blumenstraße in Düsseldorf. On her mother's side, she came from the Simons-Köhler family from Elberfeld (see Friedrich Wilhelm Simons-Köhler; Walter Simons; Ludwig Simons). The architect Walter Kyllmann (Kyllmann and Heyden) was an uncle of Lore. Her great-grandfather was the district administrator of Solingen and art patron Carl Gottlieb Kyllman.\nIn addition to her father, Lore Uphoff-Schill received instruction in painting from Lothar von Kunowski at the Kunstgewerbeschule Düsseldorf. In 1913, she and her husband Fritz Uphoff began to devote themselves to figurative representation in the studio they rented in Düsseldorf. She mainly created poetic, miniature-like fairy tale paintings. After moving to Worpswede, she turned to landscape painting. She also took her easel to the surrounding villages and created unique paintings in oil and a special spray technique depicting the moorland landscape around Worpswede. The pastel and oil paintings in which she atmospherically depicted farms, moorland paths and barns are impressive.\nDuring the economically difficult 1920s, Lore Uphoff was involved in the work of the \"Werkgemeinschaft Worpswede für Buchkunst, gestochene Buch- und Mappenwerke\" (Worpswede Association for Book Art, Engraved Book and Portfolio Works) founded by Fritz and his brother Carl Emil Uphoff. Due to a serious leg ailment, she had to give up her landscape painting in 1940. From this time onwards, she mainly painted and drew still lifes of flowers.\nIn 1928, the Provinzialmuseum Hannover acquired 10 paintings by Worpswede artists, including Emmy Meyer, Martha Vogeler, Lore Uphoff-Schill and Carl Emil Uphoff. Two drawings by Lore Uphoff are kept by the Sprengel Museum in Hanover.\n\n\n== Writings ==\nAdolf Schill. Memories of my father.

        "content": "Vera Stein (born 195] in La Paz, Bolivia as Waltraud Storck) is a German author who was held in psychiatric institutions against her will for years due to misdiagnosis.\n\n\n== Life ==\nVera Stein was held in psychiatric institutions (Frankfurt University Hospital, Dr. Heines Clinic in Bremen) for years from 1974 without sufficient diagnosis and against her will and treated with psychotropic drugs under conditions of puberty. The family, and in particular the father, were the driving force behind the many inpatient compulsory hospitalizations between 1974 and 1979, even after the patient had reached the age of majority and made several escape attempts.\nIn 1993, she wrote her first book about her psychiatric experiences under the pseudonym Vera Stein, four more followed.\n\nMy case shows what can happen to people who have been deprived of what is most valuable, namely their health, and what additional burdens they have to defend themselves against in order to lead a reasonably decent life despite their damage.\nIn 2005, she was successful with an application to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. The Court found a violation of Article 5 (1) (right to liberty and security) and Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life) of the European Convention on Human Rights with regard to her stay in the private Dr. Heines Clinic from July 29, 1977, to April 5, 1979, for which the Federal Republic of Germany was responsible. At the instigation of her father, she had been placed in a closed ward of the clinic against her will and without a court order, and had been returned there by the police after escaping on March 4, 1979; the rejection of her claims for damages against the clinic in this regard by the judiciary had not taken sufficient account of Article 5 and had thus also violated it. The Federal Republic of Germany was ordered to pay 75,000 euros in damages.\n\n\n== Works ==\nMit dem Rücken zur Wand. Ein Ratgeber – So setze ich mein Recht im Arzthaftungsprozess durch!

        "content": "The community of goods of the early church of Jerusalem (also known as the early Christian community of goods) refers to the transfer of all property and sharing the proceeds with those in need, which Luke's Acts of the Apostles (Acts 2:44; 4:32) in the New Testament highlights as a characteristic of this first community of early Christianity in Jerusalem. To emulate this New Testament account, several later Christian groups attempted to share their property and administer it jointly in whole or in part.\n\n\n== New Testament ==\n\n\n=== Texts on community of property ===\nThe statement \"They had all things in common\" is found twice almost word for word in the text units Acts 2:42–47 and Acts 4:32–35. They are closely related summaries in terms of form, language and content. The evangelist Luke is regarded as their single author.\n\nImmediately following the miracle of Pentecost and Simon Peter's first sermon, Acts 2:42-47 summarizes the main characteristics of the early church in Jerusalem:\"They held to the teaching of the apostles and to the fellowship, the breaking of bread and the prayers. They were all filled with fear, for many miracles and signs occurred through the apostles. And all who believed formed a community and had everything in common. They sold their possessions and goods and gave to everyone as much as they needed. Day after day they stayed in the temple united, broke bread in their homes and ate together in joy and simplicity of heart. They praised God and were loved by the people. And every day the Lord brought into their fellowship all those who were to be saved.\"Luke only uses the word koinonia (\"community\") here. As the phrase hapanta koina (\"all things in common\") confirms, in the NT it means not only personal harmony, but also the social use of property. The distribution of proceeds from sales to the needy is therefore a constitutive part of this community and has the same status as apostolic teaching, the celebration of the meal (in which sacrament and satiety were still inseparable), prayer and mission. According to Acts 2:47, the early church received the sympathy of the Jewish people for this.\nThe text presents these characteristics as the effect of the Holy Spirit poured out in the Pentecost miracle and Peter's first sermon. This centrally proclaims the resurrection of Jesus Christ, the one who was previously crucified for the guilt of all (Acts 2:36). It ends with the call (Acts 2:38, 40): \"Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. [...] Be saved from this perverse generation!\" This is followed by a mass baptism of the sermon listeners. Their community of goods shows that they have received the promised Spirit and are responding to the call to repentance.\n\nAfter further missionary successes, Acts 4:32-35 returns to the subject of the community of goods and explains its nature and purpose:\"And the multitude of believers had one heart and one soul; and no one said that any of his possessions was his own, but all things were common to them. [...] Nor did any of them suffer want, for those who owned land or houses sold them and brought the proceeds of what they had sold and laid them at the apostles' feet; and they distributed to each one according to his need.\"Accordingly, private property remained formally in existence, but each baptized person renounced their property rights to the other members of the congregation as required. Luke describes the state of common ownership achieved in this way with the phrase hapanta koina, analogous to the Hellenistic ideal of friendship at the time, so that the early church was and should also be a role model for non-Jews.\nThese summaries are followed by examples (Acts 4:36–37 ): \" Joseph, who had been given the surname Barnabas by the apostles [...] owned a field and sold it, bringing the money and laying it at the apostles' feet.\" Acts 5:1–11 tells us that Ananias and Sapphira sold a piece of land together, but kept some of the proceeds for themselves and Ananias only brought part of it to the apostles. Peter asked him:\"'Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and keep some of the proceeds of the property for yourself? Couldn't it have remained your property and couldn't you freely dispose of the proceeds even after the sale?\"With the decision in his heart, he had not lied to people, but to God: \"When Ananias heard these words, he fell to the ground and died.\" The same happened to his wife, who then confronted Peter about what she had done.\nThe examples contrast the desired behavior of donating all the proceeds of a land sale to the church with the condemned behavior of keeping some of the proceeds for himself. According to Peter's reaction, the land sale and donation were voluntary, but withholding a portion was lying to God because the donor falsely pretended to donate the full proceeds. In doing so, he broke the fellowship brought about by the Holy Spirit, which was intended to benefit the needy. Accordingly, the actual proceeds of a voluntary donation should not be concealed or a previously announced donation handed over in full. After this, Acts no longer mentions the community of goods.\n\n\n=== Texts on the equalization of property between communities ===\nAccording to Acts 6:1–7, the community of goods did not always ensure that everyone was provided for: The widows of the Greek-speaking Jewish Christians had been overlooked in the daily distribution of food. A general assembly of the church transferred the distribution of food, which had previously been carried out by the apostles themselves, to a newly elected committee of seven deacons.\nOther NT texts report on collections from other churches for the early church. They show that there was still a shortage there, so that an equalization of possessions was introduced between the churches. Acts 11:27–30 mentions such a collection from Antioch. According to Gal 2:10, a continuous collection for the early church was agreed at the Apostles' Council (around 48), which Paul of Tarsus wanted to collect from the churches he had founded. A famine in the region around the year 47/48 was a conceivable reason for this. The example of the Jerusalem community of goods may have inspired the external collection of donations.\nIn Romans 15:25-29, Paul described the handing over of this collection \"for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem\" (cf. Acts 24:17) and wrote about the donors: \"They have done it willingly and are also their debtors. For if the Gentiles have been given a share in their spiritual goods, it is right and proper that they should also serve them with physical goods.\" He therefore did not understand this collection for the poor as a charitable service, but as a theological duty of the Gentile Christians, who were to thank the Jewish Christians for the message of salvation they had received and confirm their lasting connection.\nIn 2 Cor 8:1-15, Paul encouraged the church in Corinth to continue the collection they had begun earlier for the early church: \"For you know what Jesus Christ our Lord did in his love: He who was rich became poor for your sakes, that through his poverty he might make you rich. [...] For it is not a question of your being in need by helping others; it is a question of compensation. At the moment, your abundance should help compensate their poverty, so that one day their abundance may also help compensate your poverty. In this way there will be a balance, as it says in Scripture: \"He who had gathered much did not have too much, and he who had little did not have too little.\" Paul thus took up the intention of the community of goods to compensate for the lack of the poor within the Christian community and transferred the idea of the equalization of possessions between rich and poor members of the church to the relationship between all the churches.\n\n\n== Effects ==\nIn the history of Christianity, the community of goods of the early church (Acts 2/4) served as a model for Christian minorities who try to live accordingly and thus set themselves apart from the mainstream churches. It forms a critical benchmark for the entire relationship of the churches to poverty, property and possessions. It also provides a basis for social criticism, as it implies living together as equals in mutual, binding solidarity without exploitation and thus aims to testify to and anticipate the coming kingdom of God.\n\n\n=== Late antiquity ===\nThe early church developed a hierarchy and the beginnings of a double-tier ethic, which issued the commandments of Jesus to most Christians. Church bishops were also large landowners. Sharing property with the poor was left to the individual as voluntary almsgiving. As a counter-movement to this, Christian monasticism emerged from 300 onwards, which is usually attributed to asceticism. Otto Gerhard Oexle, on the other hand, sees the idea of the Vita communis, inspired by the community of goods of the early church, as the reason for its emergence. The anchorites followed the example of Anthony, who gave away all his possessions in 305 and withdrew into the desert as a hermit. Pachomius founded the first Christian monastery as a koinobion around 325. For him, the early church was a defining motif, although he probably did not yet introduce a community of goods. Representatives of cenobitic monasticism always referred to Acts 2:44 and 4:32 to reject the ascetic model and to justify increasing communion as the correct form of living together for Christians that went hand in hand with Christianization. Eusebius of Vercelli (283–371) introduced a community of life and goods for the clergy of his city in 340 in accordance with Acts 2.\nFor many Church Fathers, the community of goods of the early church was the ideal of the apostolic age, from which they criticized luxury, venality, unjust profits, the taking of interest (as usury) and greed. In 368, during a severe famine in Cappadocia, the presbyter Basil the Great, who had previously lived without possessions for a long time as an anachoret, sharply criticized the rich, who were exploiting the lack of food to raise prices and shortage of goods, in sermons on Luke's texts from the New Testament. He demanded the immediate and unreserved use of their goods for the common good, the lowering of prices and interest rates on loans. He organized regular feeding of the poor from ongoing donations and, following this emergency aid, established a settlement for the poor that provided them with food and medical treatment on a permanent basis. His basic idea was that all private property belonged to God, so that every wealthy person was only his trustee and administrator and had to mobilize all surplus profits for the poor.\nGregory of Nazianzus and Gregory of Nyssa followed this principle called patronage. Jerome legitimized cenobitic monasticism around 380 by pointing out that Jewish Christians in Alexandria and elsewhere had practiced community of goods for centuries. John Cassian wrote about Acts 2:44: \"The whole church lived like this at that time, whereas today there are only a few in the monasteries who lead this life.\" He thus idealized early Christianity in contrast to the church of his time.\nOnce Christianity had become the state religion (380), community of goods was only practiced in separate monasteries. The Rule of Augustine, written around 397, paraphrases Acts 2: \"This is what we command you in the monastery. The first aim of your common life is to dwell together in unity and to be one heart and one soul in God. Therefore call nothing your own, but let everything belong to you together\" (Ch. 1). For Augustine of Hippo, the community of goods of the early church was the norm and the historical starting point for Christians living together in household communities (vita communis) and thus for the cohesion of all Christians. He emphasized this norm in 407 in sermons against the Donatists, whom he accused of having a selfish attitude that was only interested in their own ethical perfection.\nThe Regula Benedicti (6th century) also demanded that aspiring monks give up all private property. The community of goods here also established a common economy and a duty to strictly regulated, daily common work. The administration of monastic common property was the sole responsibility of the respective abbot, was therefore bound to the hierarchy of the order and did not include any criticism of the church.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nThe mendicant orders practiced lively almsgiving, persuaded many rich people to give up their property and at the same time welcomed the expanding interest economy. Their conflicts with the clergy influenced the universities and led to the formation of lay orders in many cities. In this way, they contributed significantly to the stabilization of medieval feudalism.\nThe Franciscan orders founded in the 11th century also practiced renunciation of property and community ownership. The Minorites in particular combined this more strongly than their predecessors with explicit criticism of unequal property and power relations in the church and society. However, attempts to encourage the clergy to adopt a non-possessive lifestyle and the Church to renounce wealth were rejected by the popes.\nIn the 13th century, the community of goods of the mendicant orders led to a scholastic dispute about the role of private property: Thomas Aquinas justified private property and its inheritance based on natural law as a form of Christian life on an equal footing with the community of goods. Johannes Duns Scotus, on the other hand, saw common property as normality, conceded only a right of use to goods as legitimate, denied the right to private property and interpreted it as an invention of the princes.\nForms of the community of goods that were critical of the church and society appeared more frequently from the 14th century onwards. Around 1370, the movement of the Brethren of the Common Life emerged in the Netherlands, but they did not want to form a new religious order. Instead, they saw their community of goods as a direct commandment of Jesus Christ, the only \"abbot\", for all regular canons. For them, the model of the early church as an apostolic teaching was a generally binding way of life for all Christians, both clerics and lay people, which the church had only covered up.\n\n\n=== Reformation era ===\nFrom the 15th century onwards, there were attempts to bring about a Radical Reformation in church and society, the representatives of which often called for a community of goods and implemented it locally or regionally at times: for example, the Czech Taborites (1420) and Hans Böhm (Drummer of Niklashausen) (1476).\nFrom 1520, during the course of the Reformation, groups of Anabaptists made such attempts. They often sympathized with the German peasant uprisings and in some cases adopted their demands for the towns they reformed: for example, Nikolaus Storch, Thomas Müntzer and Hans Hergot in Saxony and Thuringia. In Zollikon (Switzerland), a circle around Conrad Grebel, Felix Manz and Wilhelm Reublin founded a local community of goods after their expulsion from Zurich in 1525. In addition to the Schleitheim Confession, the Anabaptists disseminated a community order in 1527, which was intended to establish a community of goods in future Anabaptist communities. This included the demand for a special budget from which the poor were to be provided for in acute emergencies. The peasant leader Michael Gaismair tried unsuccessfully to implement a new, Christian-based property system in Tyrol in 1526. Hans Hut, a disciple of Müntzer, tried unsuccessfully to implement the community of goods in Nikolsburg (Moravia) in 1527 against the moderate Anabaptist Balthasar Hubmaier. Hut understood community of goods as overcoming the original sin of greed in the sense of the ninth and tenth Commandments. His followers also practised it in their families and with refugees, whom they took into their homes. They founded a community of goods in 1528, first in Austerlitz, then in 1530 in Auspitz, and also advocated a radical pacifism that included renouncing armed self-defence.\nAs a result of the internal conflicts surrounding these issues, Jakob Hutter founded the first brotherhood settlements in Tyrol in 1533 as agrarian housing estates and craft businesses based on the division of labor with their own kindergartens and schools. Although Hutter had to flee to Moravia as early as 1535, while other attempts soon disappeared again, the Hutterites were able to preserve their communities to the present day. Between 1556 and 1578 in particular, new brother farms were established under Peter Walpot. During the severe persecution of the Counter-Reformation, they emigrated to Hungary, Wallachia and later to the Ukraine. In the 19th century, brotherhoods emerged in the USA. Other examples are the Stäbler, Gabrieler and Philipper. These Anabaptist attempts were mostly intended as precursors to an expected reorganization of society as a whole, but did not seek to enforce this generally. Only the Anabaptist kingdom of Münster enforced community of goods and polygamy with a new constitution as a duty of all Münster Christians.\nIn 1525, Martin Luther accused the rebellious peasants of misusing the gospel for social change and thus confusing heavenly and earthly justice (two kingdoms doctrine). The grace of God granted in baptism was independent of social status. The community of goods of Acts 4:32ff. was voluntary and did not justify any demands on others. In contrast, the peasants wanted to keep their property and create common property with other people's property. In a polemic requested by the city council in 1528, the Augsburg pastor Urbanus Rhegius portrayed the theology of the Anabaptists and their way of life as an anti-divine seduction of the faithful. He interpreted their community of goods as a mere means of providing material security for idle vagabonds, as envy and disguised greed. He interpreted their aid to the poor as unregulated chaos with which they sought to evade civil order. The reformer Johannes Brenz, on the other hand, defended the persecuted Anabaptists in 1528/30: they had not attempted to impose a community of goods on all Christians, just as earlier monks had not; this could not be considered equivalent to sedition. Only actual sedition, not assumed future intentions, should be punished. By 1525, the peasant uprisings had been put down, and by 1534 most Anabaptist communes had been put down by massacring tens of thousands of their followers. Nevertheless, the Anabaptists clung to their faith and way of life, which for them was a life-threatening attack on the medieval Corpus Christianum.\n\n\n=== Modern times ===\nThere were other communities of property among persecuted Christian minorities in the 17th century, such as the Levellers during the English Civil War (1642–1649). Their spokesman Gerrard Winstanley based his demand to dispossess all English nobles and replace the feudal order with common property directly on the entire Bible, without referring to continental theologians. From 1668, the Jesuit Jean de Labadie introduced household communities in several regions of Europe that shared income and property. His followers, the Labadists, emigrated to the US, bought land in Maryland and founded a rural commune there in 1683. It was run in an authoritarian manner by a \"bishop\" who assigned daily chores to everyone. All private property was forbidden and consumption was rationed. This community is said to have collapsed in 1725 due to the leader's self-enrichment.\nFollowing a visionary experience she had in prison around 1758, the English Quaker Ann Lee founded a group called the Shakers because of their ecstatic dances. The initial eight members emigrated to the US in 1770 and founded a celibate, pacifist, spiritualist and missionary community near Albany (New York). The group took in orphans and homeless people, many of whom later became members. It grew to 18 communities with around 6000 members by 1826, but dwindled again to just a few people by 2000.\nThe Russian Duchoborzen, probably founded by a Quaker around 1740, formed a tightly organized settlement, work and property community in Tauria with the permission of Tsar Alexander I from 1801. They punished apostates with death and were therefore banished to Transcaucasia in 1839. After several persecutions for their refusal to do military service, Tolstoy succeeded in having them allowed to emigrate to North America in 1886. In his late writings, Tolstoy described the future society he hoped for as an agrarian community of property that would abolish the state, the army, private property, trade and the industrial division of labour. Around 1900, he thus triggered the Tolstoyan movement, which was not founded by him and aimed for a pacifist anarchy.\nIn his work Pia desideria (1675), Pietist Philipp Jacob Spener referred to common property as the ideal of a Christian way of life according to Acts 2/4. Gottfried Arnold had developed this ideal in his \"Unparteiische Kirchen- und Ketzer-Historie\" (1699) as a critique of previous church history. Since then, social reformist pietists such as Ernst Christoph Hochmann von Hochenau and Friedrich Christoph Oetinger have regarded the original community of goods as a model. In his work \"Die güldene Zeit\" (1759), Oetinger identified the expected millennial kingdom of Jesus Christ with the pagan idea of the Golden Age: the 19th century would bring a democratic social order in which money, the state and private property would be abolished. His work inspired the founding of the Pietist settlement of Wilhelmsdorf (Württemberg) as a community of goods in 1824.\nJohann Georg Rapp, a weaver from Württemberg influenced by Pietism, founded the Harmony Society in 1805 in Pennsylvania, USA, which existed from 1814 to 1824 under the name \"New Harmony\" in Indiana, then again in Pennsylvania until 1916 under the name \"Economy\". The members, originally around 800 and ultimately around 150, lived without marriage and transferred all property rights to a board chaired by Rapp. The commune split in 1832 due to leadership conflicts and gradually transformed itself into a pure production cooperative from 1840 onwards.\nIn the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons), Joseph Smith founded the United Order of Enoch in 1831, whose members lived in community of property. The order influenced the settlement of the Mormons in Missouri and Utah.\n\n\n=== As of 1920 ===\nInspired by the religious socialists and the Hutterites, whom they initially joined, the couple Emmy and Eberhard Arnold founded the first \"Bruderhof\" in Sannerz (Hesse) in 1920. The Bruderhöfer cultivated a community of goods based on the Sermon on the Mount. During the National Socialist era, they were persecuted as pacifists and moved to alternative quarters in the Principality of Liechtenstein, Great Britain and Paraguay. Other Bruderhöfe were later established in the US and Australia.\nHans and Wally Klassen, Mennonites and Tolstoyans who had emigrated from Russia, belonged to the commune in Sannerz. In 1923, they founded a settlement in Sonnefeld (Upper Franconia), whose members – mostly Quakers – practised community of goods and strict vegetarianism and took in orphans.\nIn 1943, Chiara Lubich founded a community of women in Loreto (Marche) who vowed poverty, chastity and following Jesus in their daily lives. This gave rise to the Focolare Movement: an initially Catholic lay movement, which today has developed into an international and interreligious movement. Some of its members live unmarried in shared flats, pursuing ordinary professions but transferring all their salaries to a group fund. Surpluses are transferred to a central fund in Rome, from which essential goods are purchased and distributed to places where they are needed.\nAfter 1945, a large number of Protestant and ecumenical communities emerged in Europe taking the original community of goods as a model and therefore seeing themselves as part of the church, not as special groups (sects) outside the church. Brother Roger, the founder and first prior of the Protestant Taizé Community, introduced a community of goods in 1949 that was linked to celibacy and strict obedience. The ecumenical Jesus Brotherhood, founded in 1961, also cultivates a way of life based on Acts 2 within the framework of the mainline churches.\n\n\n== Research ==\nSince the 19th century, NT research has been discussing its texts on the community of goods of the early church. Questions are asked about their meaning in their own context, contemporary analogies, biblical references, their possible form of organization, historicity, effectiveness and current significance.\n\n\n=== Ancient analogies ===\nA community of goods was a widespread social utopia in antiquity long before Christianity. Since the Histories of Herodotus (around 460 BC), some ancient historians have attributed a community of goods to past primitive peoples who did not yet know money as a means of exchange. Other authors described them as part of fictitious, prehistoric or submerged communities that had implemented ethical ideals. Such utopias projected into the past were common in Hellenism as a moral counter-image to the present.\nPythagoras in particular was often attributed an ideal philosophical society, which also practised a community of goods. In his dialog Timaeus (around 360 BC), Plato attributed the traditional saying \"What belongs to friends is common\" to Pythagoras.[53] Aristotle handed down the saying (Nicomachean Ethics 1159b): \"The property of friends is common.\" This saying can also be found in the \"Sayings of Sextus\" (≈180–200), which an anonymous author compiled from older Hellenistic sources (primarily Platonism and Stoicism). Antonius Diogenes wrote about Pythagoras (around 200): \"But he loved friends beyond measure, being the first to hold the view that among friends everything is common (ta ton filon koina) and the friend is an alter ego.\" Iamblichus of Chalcis wrote in his On Pythagorean Life (c. 300): \"the origin of justice is community, equal right and a bond in which all feel the same entirely as a single body and a single soul and designate mine and yours alike [...]. Pythagoras did this best of all men by completely banishing the attachment to private property from the nature of his disciples and instead strengthening the sense of community.\"\nMany researchers assume that Luke was familiar with the ancient idealization of the Pythagoreans and that it influenced his linguistic style (including koinonia, \"one heart and one soul\", hapanta koina: \"they had everything in common\"). Martin Hengel (1996), Gerd Theissen (2008) and other New Testament scholars assume that Luke took the phrase hapanta koina literally from Hellenistic proverbial wisdom circulating at the time. According to Matthias Konradt (2006), he took the phrase from the Hellenistic friendship ethic. According to Niclas Forster (2007), he deliberately stylized the summaries in Acts 2/4 following the common literary pattern of ideal communities at the time.\nThe community of goods was part of some variants of the ancient utopia of the Golden Age. Roman authors such as the poet Virgil considered this age had begun with Emperor Augustus (Aeneid, 29–19 BC). However, they left out the traditional characteristic of the community of goods, apparently because the reality contradicted it too clearly. In contrast, Acts 2/4 emphasizes the community of goods of the early church: possibly in deliberate contrast to the Roman environment, just as the Lucan birth story describes Jesus with imperial titles as the (true) \"Saviour\" and bringer of \"peace on earth\". Such \"anti-imperial allusions\" are considered a fundamental feature of Luke's double work.\nThe community of goods was also known in ancient Judaism. Some Dead Sea Scrolls, the Community Rule and the Damascus Scroll (written around 180 BC), describe an end-time community of \"priests\" who were to give up their possessions in accordance with Ez 44:28 (priests were to be propertyless to live entirely for God) upon joining this group. These texts contain further parallels to Acts 2/4, such as water baptism as a condition of admission, a governing body of twelve lay people and three priests. In contrast to Acts 2/4, they emphasize living together in common houses, the formation of a fixed community wealth by paying wages into a common fund and a firmly organized welfare system. Whether the group described existed and lived in the nearby historical settlement of Qumran is disputed.\n\nIn the 1st century, Jewish authors influenced by Hellenism portrayed the supposed Essenes as analogous to the Pythagoreans. Flavius Josephus wrote:\"They despise wealth, and their sense of community is admirable; it is the law that those who join the sect hand over their property to the order, so that on the whole neither poverty nor wealth prevails among them, but after pooling the property of the individuals there is only one property for all as brothers ... The administrators of the common property are elected, and each individual is indiscriminately obliged to serve all.\"Philo of Alexandria wrote:\"They show their love for people through benevolence, equality... and community life (koinonia) [...]: First, then, no house is the property of a single person without being, in fact, the house of all; for, besides living together in brotherhoods..., their dwelling is also open to members of the same sect who come from elsewhere. [...] Consequently, they have a common treasury for all and common expenses. The clothes are common and the food is common; they have also adopted the custom of communal meals.... Sharing the same roof, the same way of life and the same table is nowhere better realized. And this is the reason for it: everything they earn as wages for their daily work they do not keep for themselves, but lay it down before all... so that it may be at the common disposal of those who wish to help themselves to it.\"These idealized descriptions are considered literary cultural criticism. Although no direct influence on Acts 2/4 can be proven, it is assumed that Luke became acquainted with the community of goods through the Hellenized Judaism of the time. According to Martin Honecker, however, Acts 2/4 does not contain a general protest against wealth and private property.\n\n\n=== Biblical references ===\nThe land law of the Torah is based on the principle (Lev 25:23): YHWH alone owned the land of Israel, the Israelites had only \"leased\" it. This establishes the commandment of the jubilee, which demands that Israelites who have fallen into slavery be released every 50th year and that everyone be given back their original God-given inheritance. Because this commandment was disregarded during Israel's reign (approx. 950–586 BC), it was included in the future promise of exilic-post-exilic biblical prophecy (Is 61:1–2). According to Luke 4:18–21, Jesus of Nazareth quoted this promise during his public appearance in the synagogue of Nazareth and claimed to fulfill it. At that time, however, the Romans and Jewish landowners dependent on them owned the land of Israel. Therefore, the community of goods of the early church is interpreted as an attempt to anticipate and partially fulfill the promised year of jubilee under foreign rule.\nMany interpreters understand the expression \"one heart and one soul\" (Acts 4:32) as an allusion to the Jewish Shema Yisrael (Deut 6:5): \"Therefore you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul and with all your strength.\" Gerhard Jankowski (1995) concluded that, for Luke, the early church realized the first of the Ten Commandments described here precisely through their community of goods. For by no one calling anything their own, but all disposing of everything together, they had once again recognized God as the sole owner of Israel (Lev 25:23). This is why Luke reports on the sale of land and highlights the example of a Levite: according to Deut 18:1–2, this tribe of priests was not allowed to own land anyway. Apparently, the early church, like the Levites, had given up all land ownership. Luke thus presented the early church as an alternative to the Roman Empire, which was based on large estates, slavery and military power. This counter-design could therefore only be realized in a completely different social order, which Acts had also worked towards in Rome with the preaching of Jesus' resurrection.\nFor many New Testament scholars, Acts 4:34 (\"Neither was there any among them that suffered need...\") clearly alludes to the Torah commandment Deut 15:4: \"But in fact there should be no poor among you at all ...\" For Luke, the community of goods of the early church therefore fulfilled the goal of the commanded sabbatical year (Deut 15), which provided for general debt relief for the poor. But while this goal remained unattainable for Deut 15:11 (\"The poor will never completely disappear from your land...\"), Luke deliberately did not take up this verse, to which Jesus also referred (Mk 14:7): \"In the church, then, the promise given to Israel is fulfilled, Deut 15:4.\" Michael Schäfers (1998) also concluded: By remedying the lack of the needy according to Acts 4:34, the early church had, for Luke, fulfilled the utopia of the Torah that there should no longer be any poor among the people of God. Their community of goods therefore aimed to permanently overcome poverty in the sense of Deut 15:4. It went beyond mere individual generosity, which could never eliminate poverty. The early church could only have been a model for the diaspora Judaism of the time, as attested to by ancient sources, if it had actually practised a community of goods.\nThe community of goods of the early church is usually explained as an influence of Jesus. In 1988, Jürgen Roloff cited the following direct influences of Jesus: his renunciation of possessions (Lk 6:24), his corresponding demand to his followers (Lk 9:3; 10:4), his criticism of wealth (Mk 10:21–27; Lk 12:16–21; 16:13.19-31) and his warning against worry (Mt 6:25–33). The early church followed Jesus' proclamation. With their community of goods, they tried to heed his warning against Mammon as a power hostile to God and used possessions for the common good, for the poor, not for their own interests that separated them from others. Peter Stuhlmacher (2005) assumed that Jesus' commandments and the Decalogue continued to apply in the early church. He interpreted Acts 2/4 as an attempt by the early church to obey Jesus' commandment to give up possessions (Lk 12:22–32; Mt 6:25–34). This is why they formed a community completely focused on the reign of God.\n\n\n=== Organization ===\nThe historical-critical debate on the subject began in the 19th century in the context of the social conflicts of the time. From around 1830, the community of goods of the early church was used to justify the goals of utopian socialism and interpreted as the impetus for a comprehensive social reform or social revolution. This was the case, for example, of Félicité de La Mennais and Wilhelm Weitling.\nIn 1843, Friedrich Engels rejected the equation \"Christianity is communism\", which was popular in France at the time: Although \"a few passages in the Bible seemed to favor communism\", the \"general spirit\" of biblical teachings completely contradicted this and every other \"reasonable measure\". He conceded, however, that the rebels in the German Peasants' War had rightly invoked the original Christian community of goods: Their oppression and lawlessness \"stood out very much from the commonwealth of the first Christians and from the teachings of Christ as laid down in the Bible\". The peasant leader Thomas Müntzer had therefore only drawn \"logical conclusions\" from Luther's teachings when he concluded that the \"community of property\" and democracy were the only correct form of society for Christians from the Bible.\nSince the March Revolution of 1848, Christian interpreters have drawn a line between the community of goods of the early church and early socialism: Acts 2:44/4:32 does not mean the abolition of private property through another, collective form of ownership. The deacon Heinrich Merz emphasized in 1849: Private property was a right and a duty to be able to help those in need. Forced expropriation would only make the rich poor and thus the poor even poorer. Everyone only paid what they could and needed into the community treasury, but kept the rest: in the knowledge that \"everything belongs to God and everything is for the brothers\". It therefore depends on the inner willingness to love. Gerhard Uhlhorn (1895) emphasized something similar: Acts 2/4 was about voluntary, spontaneous, unregulated almsgiving out of the enthusiastic love of the early days.\nThe Catholic priest Wilhelm Hohoff had been proclaiming since 1871 that the equality of goods, i.e. a social equalization of property, was the goal of Christianity on account of neighbourly love. This was therefore compatible with socialism.This made him an early representative of religious socialism. In contrast, following the encyclical Rerum novarum (1891), most Catholic interpreters did not infer social reform from the New Testament, but rather the general social necessity of property. They interpreted the community of goods as a heightened form of almsgiving or as a special ethic for an ethically perfect minority. Theo Sommerlad (1903) interpreted Acts 2:44 as an \"institution of support for the poor\" without a fixed form of organization. The NT texts show no trace of an association or common management of the land.\nThe Marxist Karl Kautsky categorized primitive Christianity from 1895 onwards as a reform movement supported by an ancient \"lumpenproletariat\", the destitute poor, small craftsmen and middle-class merchants. This movement reacted to the mass poverty of the time with the fair distribution of goods and joint administration of goods. However, the early Christians had sold the means of production or left them in private hands and were therefore unable to overcome poverty. Because they limited themselves to a \"communism of enjoyment\" and a common household, they would have had to give up their egalitarian ideal based on the family as Christianity spread. Christians could therefore participate in the construction of a classless society, although their faith was incompatible with scientific socialism.\nSome Marxists criticized Kautzky's theses, others took them up positively. Rosa Luxemburg, for example, wrote in 1905 that, in line with the impoverishment of the population at the time, the early Christians had proclaimed common property, sharing of the rich with the poor, social equality and thus communism, but limited to food and the property of the baptized, not the means of production. The permanent overcoming of class rule corresponds to the message of Jesus Christ. The anti-communism of today's priests is therefore directed against his teaching. The first apostles in particular were \"the most passionate communists\". She quoted Acts 4:32–35.\nMost theologians and church representatives subsequently rejected this view. Ernst Troeltsch contradicted Kautsky from 1908 onwards: The early Christians did not have any social reform goals and did not represent any particular class interests. They only tried to implement Jesus' commandment of love within their own circle, albeit initially quite radically. Their community of goods only included the distribution of goods for consumption, not the means of production. It was a \"communism of love\" based on the internal solidarity of the believers as a communism of consumption. The church historian Hans von Schubert (1919) considered the category of communism of love to be inappropriate: the early church had not exercised any compulsion to jointly manage goods of consumption. Leonhard Ragaz, on the other hand, followed on from Troeltsch: The early church had formed a free cooperative and strived for a \"socialism of voluntariness\" that corresponded to the spirit of Christ. In 1972, Ernst Bloch also affirmed the term communism of love for the early church's community of goods. Heinz-Dietrich Wendland, Wilhelm Schneemelcher, Wolfgang Schrage, Jürgen Roloff and others, on the other hand, emphasized that \"communism\" was incompatible with \"love\" and not a suitable category for the original Christian community of goods. It was neither about complete dispossession nor the socialization of the means of production.\nAccording to Michael Schäfers (1998), the early church practiced a mixture of individual renunciation of property and social welfare in line with its possibilities and the circumstances of the time, with the aim of overcoming poverty internally and creating equal property relations. It therefore subordinated private property to this goal and made it subservient, but did not replace it with a collective form of ownership or a collectively exercised right of disposal. The process of voluntary surrender of property had sought to equalize ownership, and private rights of ownership and disposal had taken a back seat. This procedural equalization of possession was understood and legitimized as an expression of following Jesus as a sign of the expectation of the near future.\nPeter Stuhlmacher (2005) concluded from the differences between Acts 2 and ancient texts that describe firmly organized communities of goods and provision: \"In Jerusalem it was only a matter of a vita communis on the basis of spiritual spontaneity and voluntariness... the whole focus of life was on prayer and the imminent coming of the Lord implored in the maranatha\".\nAccording to Jürgen Roloff (2010), the community of goods in both narratives reacts to the resurrection testimony of the apostles and proves its effectiveness (Acts 2:34; 4:33). Luke thus inextricably linked both aspects. Acts 2 presents the community of goods as a summary, Acts 4 describes its concrete implementation: \"Whenever the situation requires it, the owners of land and houses sell their property and deliver the proceeds to the apostles. They administer the common treasury, from which needy members of the congregation receive what they need (cf. 6:1f.)\" In this way, Luke elevated a temporary practice, which he was probably only aware of from the individual examples that have been handed down, to a historical model for the church of all times. Because the apostles, as witnesses to the manifestations of the Resurrected Christ, expected his imminent return, they spontaneously used available resources for the needy, but did not organize any long-term provision.\n\n\n=== Historicity ===\nHans Conzelmann (1969) argued against the historicity of the community of goods in terms of literary criticism: the summaries depicted a general renunciation of property (Acts 2,44/4,32), whereas the exemplary narratives described the renunciation as a special achievement of individuals (Acts 4,36f.), i.e. as an exception. Ancient texts on the community of goods of the Pythagoreans were also ideal images. The transfer of property and wages when joining the community of Qumran (which Conzelmann assumed to be historical) shows that a community of goods could only have existed if production had also been organized jointly. Therefore, Acts 2/4 is a retrospectively idealized depiction; there was \"no such thing\" as a complete community of property.\nGerd Theissen (1989), on the other hand, assumed a historical core of the community of goods. The early church probably adopted the Hellenistic slogan \"All things are common to all\" as a reaction to the conflict between Hebrews and Hellenists (Acts 6:1ff.) to oblige the conflicting parties to share equally and to prevent an authoritarian development.\nUlrich Luz (2005) argued in favor of historicity as follows: Luke deliberately formulated the summaries in such a way that they echoed motifs of ideal social forms and friendship ethics in ancient philosophy as well as biblical Torah commandments. But he certainly did not invent the community of goods, as there is reliable evidence of regular communal meals in the early church, which are reminiscent of Jesus' last meal before his death. Such religious meals had always included the provision of social security for the poor. As Palestine was constantly threatened by famine at the time, many former followers of Jesus came from Galilee. They were unable to pursue their professions as fishermen and farmers in the city. The early church as the center of early Christianity was often visited by other Christians and a local group of Essenes in Jerusalem also practiced community of goods, so it is highly likely that some communitarian form of life of the early church was historical.\nJürgen Roloff (2010) cited similar and additional arguments: many of the first members from Galilee had given up their families, homes and professions there and could hardly find work as fishermen and farmers in Jerusalem. In this situation, local Christians had to help support them. Pharisees had established a welfare program for the poor by offering and collecting donations for the needy at the meal celebration in the synagogues. The early Christians in Jerusalem followed this example.\n\n\n=== Effectiveness ===\nThe community of goods has often been portrayed as the cause of the impoverishment of the early church: Selling property and consuming the proceeds had led to economic ruin. This is why the early church was later dependent on material help from outside, as Paul's collection shows. The community of goods therefore inevitably failed and was not a model for the present day. This view was held by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Adolf Stoecker (1881), Friedrich Lahusen (1890), Hans von Schubert (1919), Max Weber, Gotthilf Schenkel (1946), Werner Elert (1949), Martin Robbe (1967), Rudolf Bultmann (1968), Heinz Kreissig (1970), Barry Gordon (1989) and others.\nWalter Rauschenbusch, representative of the Social Gospel (1907), Leonhard Ragaz (around 1920), Harmannus Obendink (1949) and Hans Joachim Iwand (1964) disagreed. Iwand emphasized that the community of goods was just as possible or impossible from a human perspective as God's incarnation. Anyone who believed in Jesus Christ could not reject the community of goods.\nWolfgang Reinhardt (1995) emphasized that Luke deliberately did not harmonize contradictions regarding the initial community of goods. The impoverishment of the early church had external, not internal causes. One should not speak of the failure of the community of goods because Acts 11:27–30 already shows its effect on other churches: \"Rather, one could speak of an extension of the model to the entire ecumenical community.\" He quoted Klaus Haacker in agreement: \"The example of the early church has in fact set a precedent and has been implemented in supra-regional actions to balance burdens within the church.\" The attractive provision for the poor was the main reason for the growth of early Christianity in antiquity.\nAccording to Martin Leutzsch (1999), early Christian texts (Didache, Apology of Justin, Lucian) confirm the effectiveness of the community of property. Non-Christian ancient parallels also show its viability. For Luke, according to Acts, it was a success story, not a failed experiment.\n\n\n=== Validity claim ===\nIn 1780, the Lübeck surgeon Jakob Leonhard Vogel interpreted Acts 2/4 as a valid legal claim of poor Christians against rich Christians and a common right of disposal for all Christians:\"Every Christian had a right to the goods of all the members of the whole community according to the fraternal union and in case of need could demand that the wealthy members share as much of their property with him as was required for his needs. Every Christian could make use of the goods of his brothers, and Christians who had something could not deny their needy brothers the benefit and use of the same. A Christian, for example, who had no house, could ask another Christian who had two or three houses to give him a dwelling, but he remained master of the houses. However, because of the community of use, one house had to be given to the other to live in.\"Martin Leutzsch sees most traditional interpretations as attempts to reject the claim to validity of the Lucan model for today's Christians. He includes the following lines of argument:\nConsistent historicization: the community of goods only existed in the special, unrepeatable situation of the early Christians (their near expectation).\nConsistent de-historicization: It was never a historical reality, only an ideal construct of Luke.\nDenial of the model character: Community of goods was only mentioned in Acts, the Jerusalem model was only one among others in early Christianity.\nReligious-historical comparison: The community of goods is taken from non-Christian parallels and is not derived from Jesus' message.\nLimitation of relevance and effectiveness: The community of goods is a model for the church, not a model for society. According to Acts itself, it was not practised by all early Christians, but only under the leadership of the first-called apostles. Those involved had fallen into a Pentecostal frenzy. It led to the impoverishment of the early church.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nArnold, Eberhard (1921). Siegmund-Schultze, Friedrich (ed.). Sie hatten alles gemein.

        "content": "The ELVIS Act or Ensuring Likeness Voice and Image Security Act, signed into law by Tennessee Governor Bill Lee on March 21, 2024, marked a significant milestone in the area of regulation of artificial intelligence and public sector policies for artists in the era of artificial intelligence (AI) and AI alignment. It was noted as the first enacted legislation in the United States of America specifically designed to protect musicians from the unauthorized use of their voices through artificial intelligence technologies and against audio deepfakes and voice cloning. This legislation distinguishes itself by adding penalties for copying a performer's voice without permission, a measure that addresses the sophisticated ability of AI to mimic public figures, including artists.\n\n\n== Origin and Advocacy ==\nThe inception of the ELVIS Act has been attributed to Gebre Waddell, founder of Sound Credit, who initially conceptualized a framework in 2023 that later evolved into the legislation. Representative Justin J. Pearson acknowledged Waddell's pivotal role during the March 4 House Floor Session on the bill.  The act's development was a community-driven response, reflecting the collective initiative of the music industry to confront and address the challenges posed by rapid technological advancements.  Tennessee Governor Bill Lee endorsed it as a Governor's Bill, and it was introduced in the Tennessee Legislature as House Bill 2091 by William Lamberth (R-44) and Senate Bill 2096 by Jack Johnson (R-27).The ELVIS Act is an amendment to a 1984 law that was the result of the Elvis Presley estate litigation for controlling how his likeness could be used after death.\n\n\n== Lobbying from the recording industry ==\nThe legislative journey of the ELVIS Act included a broad coalition of music industry stakeholders, including:\n\nThese organizations, led by the Recording Academy and the RIAA, played roles in drafting the legislation, advocating for passage, and rallying support among the industry and legislators.The act gained momentum through discussions that bridged industry concerns with legislative action. This collaborative process led to a proposal that specifically targets the use of AI to create unauthorized reproductions of artists' voices and images.\n\n\n== Opposition ==\nThe ELVIS Act saw industry opposition from the Motion Picture Association, including testimony in the House Banking & Consumer Affairs Subcommittee, including remarks that the law risks “interference with our member’s ability to portray real people and events”.  TechNet, representing companies like OpenAI, Google and Amazon expressed their opposition in the hearing to the bill as drafted, asserting that the language was too broadly written and could have unintended consequences.  Other concerns around it being overly broad arose with concern that it could apply to cover bands, these concerns were addressed in the hearings with lawmakers mentioning that this was not the intention.The bill passed the Tennessee House and Senate with a unanimous, bi-partisan vote including 93 ayes and 0 Noes in the House, and 30 ayes and 0 noes in the Senate.\n\n\n== Passage ==\nBy explicitly addressing AI impersonation, the ELVIS Act originated a legal approach to safeguarding personal rights, in the context of digital and technological advancements. It extends protections to an artist's voice and likeness, areas vulnerable to exploitation with the proliferation of AI technologies that occurred in 2023.The legislation received widespread support from the music industry, signaling a significant step forward in the ongoing effort to balance innovation with the protection of individual rights and creative integrity. It was reported as underscoring Tennessee's commitment to its musical heritage and showed the state as a leader in adapting copyright and privacy protections to the modern technological landscape.Artists including Chris Janson and Luke Bryan appeared at the signing ceremony hosted at Robert's Western World to support the new law and commemorate its passing.\n\n\n== Precedent and Trajectory ==\nThe ELVIS Act was reported as representing a development in the discourse surrounding AI, intellectual property, and personal rights.  It was hoped by proponents to set a precedent for future legislative efforts both within and beyond Tennessee, offering a model for how states and potentially the federal government could address similar challenges. As AI technology continues to evolve, the act represents a foundational framework for protecting the authenticity and rights of artists, ensuring contributions remain protected.The act prohibits usage of AI to clone the voice of an artist without consent and can be criminally enforced as a Class A misdemeanor.This legislation's success was hoped by its supporters to inspire similar actions in other states, contributing to a unified approach to copyright and privacy in the digital age. Such a national response would reinforce the importance of safeguarding artists' rights against unauthorized use of their voices and likenesses.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Lau Kok Rui (Chinese: 劉國瑞; born 1990) is a Hong Kong-based Malaysian film director and screenwriter best known for his feature film debut The Sunny Side of the Street, for which he won Best New Director and Best Original Screenplay in the 59th Golden Horse Awards.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nLau was born in 1990 in Muar, Johor, Malaysia. He is of Chinese descent with ancestral roots from Fujian, China, and has an elder brother and sister who later pursued studies in Taiwan. Lau, describing his hometown as lacking in entertainment, spent most of his childhood immersed in reading and watching movies, including books beyond his age owned by his siblings and Chinese films owned by his classmates. He later attended and graduated from Chung Hwa High School in 2008. Upon graduation, Lau intended to studying abroad. However, since he didn't want to follow his siblings and found Singapore too similar to his home country, he sought for places that are unpopular for Malaysian graduates. He was then informed by his high school teachers about a full scholarship program offered by City University of Hong Kong, and he applied despite not knowing Cantonese and having only a limited knowledge of Hong Kong through films like Infernal Affairs. He subsequently moved to Hong Kong alone at the age of 18 and resided in Kowloon Tong. He studied marketing at CityU and graduated with a Bachelor of Business Administration in 2011. After graduation, he became a research assistant at Chinese University of Hong Kong for a year. Initially considering postgraduate studies in political science, he eventually found himself lacking interest in the extensive essay writing involved. During that time, he attended a filmmaking workshop at the University of Hong Kong and became interested in film production. He then applied for a documentary directing course organised by Tammy Cheung and was mentored by Cheang Pou-soi and Steve Yuen. In 2013, he entered the film industry and began producing documentaries. He became a permanent resident of Hong Kong in 2015, and began working in advertisement production and as a volunteer at Pathfinder International in 2017.\nIn 2017, Lau marked his television series debut as a writer for ViuTV drama series Afterlife Firm. He then produced an RTHK documentary The Sea Gypsies, and made his directorial debut in 2019 with the ViuTV romance series Till Death Do Us Part. He started to pen a screenplay which later evolved into The Sunny Side of the Street in the same year, which themes about South Asian ethnic minorities in Hong Kong that was influenced by his own experiences as an outsider residing in Hong Kong. The screenplay was enlisted in the 2019 Hong Kong-Asia Film Financing Forum, and went into production with Lau serving as the director and scriptwriter. Lau was originally admitted for a postgraduate program at Columbia University in 2020, but he rejected the offer to focus on the film project. Lau's debut feature film was theatrically released in 2022 and received numerous awards, with Lau himself winning Best New Director and Best Original Screenplay in the 59th Golden Horse Awards and received nominations for Best New Director and Best Screenplay in the 41st Hong Kong Film Awards. Lau is currently working on a second feature film project which is based in Malaysia.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nLau is married to a Hong Kongese woman.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLau Kok Rui at IMDb",

The surface is pinkish-beige with a reddish-brown centre and a white fluffy to velvety coating from the pileicystidia. It is membranous, dry, thin and brittle and very strongly hygrophanous with the striations being visible from the margin to centre when moist. Stem: 4.5–9 cm long and 1.5-2mm thick tapering upwards slightly from a 6mm wide base. The surface is the same colour or paler than the cap with a dense covering of caulocystidia. It is fragile but solid rather than hollow with a membranous, persistent white volva at the base. Gills: Adnexed, crowded, pale rust brown. Spore print: Rusty ochre. Spores: 12.5-15 x 9.5-12 x 7.5-9.5 μm. Sublimoniform to broadly amygdaliform in side view, sublimoniform to subhexagonal to submitriform in front view. Smooth with a thick wall of up to 1.2 μm with a distinctive germ pore. Rusty ochre-brown in colour. Basidia: 15-24 x 10-12 μm. 2 spored, broadly clavate.\n\n\n== Habitat and distribution ==\nThe specimens studied by Horak, Hausknecht and Desjardin were found growing on soil in Indonesian rainforests dominated by Fagaceae trees.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Professor Frank E. Clark (Occupied the Hollyhurst Mansion from 1897,1904,1929,1930)\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1896, Frank E. Clark, musician and composer, wanted to build the \"most beautiful residence in town,\" and built a three-story, castellated style mansion that he called \"Hollyhurst.\" The mansion was completed in 1897. Not long after this, his life began to deteriorate. His father and mother died and his finances dwindled. And the bride he wanted, refused him. The beautiful sandstone dwelling perched on a hill, intended to have been his honeymoon palace, became a self-built prison for the musician. For many years, Frank Clark secluded himself in two rooms. His only companion was a dog. When the dog died, Mr. Clark buried it under one of the trees at the rear of the mansion and had a monument erected over the dog's grave. Old-times residents had recalled how the musician, now-grown eccentric, used to pedal an old-fashioned high bicycle around town and how he would appear in the streets wearing a little skullcap beneath his hat, and in the winter-time, a \"fascination\" over his cap, tied under his chin, Professor Frank E. Clark died in 1930 at the age of 77. At the time of his death, the property was in possession of Henry H. Hayes. Henry H. Hayes (1846-1930) worked on a family farm with his father, Calvin Hayes (1810-1867) and mother, Susan B. Mills (1810-1890) and 5 siblings. Mr. Hayes handled his money exceptionally well and was able to make a loan to Frank Clark. When Mr. Hayes died in 1930, that same year, his housekeeper, Miss R. Ellen Green, bought the mansion, and renamed it the Baughman House. She closed it in 1930 and Hollyhurst was given to the community. On August 20, 1933, R. Ellen Green held a special dedication for the opening of the new community hospital housed in Hollyhurst, was held on the lawn of Hollyhurst. The hospital was called Hayes-Green Community Hospital(1935). Over the years, the need for a larger facility prompted Henry Martin of Dimondale and many other County members to apply for a Federal grant and solicit matching funds from the community. Fitch H. Beach, Charlotte philanthropist, contributed $25,000 to the community hospital. The community raised $600,000 including the said $25,000 donated by Fitch H. Beach. The wills of Henry Hayes and Ellen Green stated that if money from their estates were to be used, the hospital had to be built on the land of the Hollyhurst Mansion. The hospital's name was changed from Hayes-Green Community Hospital to Hayes-Green-Beach Community Hospital to include Mr. Fitch's last name, Beach. A three-story modern hospital structure was constructed in the early 1950s and opened in 1954. In 1972, Eaton County sold the hospital and it became a non-profit named Hayes-Green-Beach Memorial Hospital, with the slogan \"We're your hospital.\" Located at 321 East Harris Street, the hospital went through multiple major expansions through the 1980s and 1990s-I am still working on this.",

        "content": "Deborah G. King (née Akin; 1839–1922) was an American Women's Crusader, Prohibition advocate, and suffragist, who worked along all reform lines. She shared with her husband in all the pioneer experiences in Minnesota and she lived to witness almost the entire growth of Lincoln, Nebraska. In August 1886, King was elected National Inspector of the Woman's Relief Corps (WRC) at the national encampment of the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR) and WRC held at Portland, Maine, and later, at a national encampment held at Minneapolis, Minnesota. She advocated and had adopted, in spite of strong opposition, the measure providing that eligibility to the WRC be broadened to include all loyal women instead of relatives of soldiers only, as was then the case. In 1896, King founded and was the first President of the Woman's Bimetallic League, which advocated the silver standard and was, at the time, the only political organization for women in the U.S.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nDeborah G. Akin was born in Rensselaer County, New York, March 29, 1839. Her grandmother, Sarah (Holley) Akin, was a half-sister of General Lafayette. Her grandfather, Justice Akin, was a soldier in the War of 1812 and in the Mexican–American War.\nShe was educated in the schools of Troy, New York.\n\n\n== Career ==\nKing was one of the original Crusaders in Lincoln, Nebraska — a party of thirteen — while her husband waas one of the group of men that stood on guard to see that no harm came to the women. She was a charter member of the Lincoln Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) and took active part in its meetings. She became a forceful speaker, and continued for many years to be in demand as a campaigner in various State contests, as well for equal suffrage as for Prohibition. Other interests — patriotic, social and religious— claimed much of her time. She was nearly always a delegate to the National WCTU conventions.\nShe was the second president of the WRC of Lincoln, and was a delegate to the national convention at Minneapolis. During the early days of the WRC, a question arose as to what limit should be placed upon the membership, whether only relatives of civil war soldiers should be eligible, or whether all loyal women should be admitted. Clara Barton was national president at the time, and favored only relatives of soldiers. King championed the idea that all loyal women should have the privileges of membership. She had only a small backing at first, but carried on the discussion for two days and two nights, when she won her point by a vote of 36 to 6. In August 1886, at Portland, Maine, King was elected National Inspector of the WRC, with the unanimous endorsement of the GAR. During that year, King inspected every WRC department in the U.S. She served as a member of the national board up to the time of her husband's severe illness. \nIn 1896, King suggested establishing a strictly political organization for women, and at her invitation, 327 women met in representative hall, at the Nebraska State Capitol, and organized the Woman's Bimetallic League, advocating the silver standard. King was unanimously elected the first president of this league, it being at the time the only political organization for women in the U.S. This band of women studied the money question, and political history generally, and were active in their support of the Boers in their war against England. At the time it disbanded, at the close of the campaign, it had a membership of 1,375.\nShe also served as vice-president for Nebraska of the National Woman Suffrage Association, with Lucy Stone as president. During this time, she attended all the national conventions.\nKing was for several years at the head of the county jail and prison work in Lincoln.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1858, she married Shepherd H. King, and later removed with him to Lincoln, Nebraska, where he became well known as a leading dentist, and more widely known as a Prohibition party official. The couple having no children of their own, adopted five young girls whom they reared as if their own.\nKing was reared in the Methodist church but both she and her husband were members of the Universalist church for years and Dr. King was president of the society as long as the organization existed in Lincoln, while she was chair of the board.\nIn politics, she was in sympathy with the Prohibition Party.\n\n\n== Death ==\nDeborah G. Akin King died March 8, 1922. She left two wills for her estate, bequests of both instruments differing altogether.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"II Most Wanted\" is a song by American singers Beyoncé and Miley Cyrus. It was released on April 20, 2024, through Parkwood Entertainment and Columbia Records as the third single from Beyonce's eighth studio album, Cowboy Carter and interpolates \"Landslide\" (1975) by Fleetwood Mac.\nA country and pop rock track, Beyoncé and Cyrus wrote \"II Most Wanted\" with Ryan Tedder and Michael Pollack, and produced it with Pollack, Jonathan Rado and Shawn Everett. The song received favorable reception from music critics, naming it one of the best tracks on the album.\nCommercially \"II Most Wanted\" became  Beyoncé's 23rd and Cyrus' 13th top-ten song on the Billboard Hot 100. The song also debuted at number two on the Hot Country Songs, scoring Beyoncé's third and Cyrus' second top-ten on the chart.\n\n\n== Background ==\nKnowles and Cyrus previously collaborated on \"Just Stand Up!\" (2008) as part of the charity supergroup Artists Stand Up to Cancer. On March 28, 2024, Knowles revealed the song and the collaboration as part of her studio album Cowboy Carter. Upon release, Cyrus took to Twitter to express her admiration for Beyoncé that only deepened in the process of creating the song alongside each other.\n\n\n== Composition ==\nThe title \"II Most Wanted\" is a reference to their status in the music industry. The \"twangy, down-tempo duet\" sees the two singers \"blend their distinctive voices\" while trading lines and harmonizing. It features \"simplistic vocal runs\" by Cyrus and more \"boisterous rifts\" by Knowles, accompanied by an instrumental blend of \"back porch country\" and \"pop rock\" in the vein of Fleetwood Mac. Additional production, acoustic guitar, and keyboards were provided by Jonathan Rado of Foxygen, while the electric guitar was played by Adam Granduciel of the War on Drugs.\nAlthough Beyoncé confirmed that all the tracks on Cowboy Carter were inspired by films, \"II Most Wanted\" also draws reference from a friendship or \"a more romantic love\". Meeting their significant other changed their lives in a profound way so they are committed \"to being there for them\". The lyrical content was also linked to the theme of a \"ride or die\" partnership, reminiscent of films like Buck and the Preacher (1972), Thelma & Louise (1991) and Bonnie and Clyde (1967). A prominent motif within the track is the use of \"cowboy imagery\".\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nRolling Stone's Brittany Spanos deemed \"II Most Wanted\" as the best collaboration on Cowboy Carter and a \"career highlight\" for both singers. She likened Carter's and Cyrus' personas to Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid, respectively, and praised how their voices \"melt[ed] into each other instead of fighting for the spotlight.\" Rolling Stone ranked the song 46th among the \"The 70 Greatest Beyoncé Songs\".\nKyle Denis of Billboard ranked \"II Most Wanted\" as the third best track on the album, praising their \"smoky tones\" that \"pair beautifully\". Denis viewed the collaboration as both artists being at the \"peak of their powers\" that makes every stylistic choice \"a home run\". They evoke \"a sense of emotional gravitas\" that makes the song appear \"a lot more high-stakes\".\nMary Siroky of Consequence defined the song as \"one of the more straightforward tracks on the album\", describing it \"a bit mournful and nostalgic, acknowledging the ever-flowing passage of time and our inability to stop it\".\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\nThe song debuted at number ten on the Billboard Global 200, scoring Beyoncé's third top-ten on the chart, after \"Break My Soul\" (2022) and  \"Texas Hold 'Em\" (2024), and Cyrus' third after \"Flowers\" and \"Used to Be Young\" (2023).\nIn the United States, \"II Most Wanted\" debuted at number 6 on the Billboard Hot 100, scoring Beyoncé's 23rd and Cyrus' 13th top-ten on the chart. The song also became Cowboy Carter's third top-ten, charting simultaneously with \"Texas Hold 'Em\" and \"Jolene\". The three songs also occupied the top three positions on the Hot Country Songs, with \"II Most Wanted\" at second, making Beyoncé the first female artist to achieve it.\n\"II Most Wanted\" debuted at number 9 on the UK Singles Chart on 5 April 2024, one of three songs from Cowboy Carter to chart in the top ten that week. The simultaneous top-ten debut of Beyoncé's cover of \"Jolene\" brought Beyoncé's tally of UK top ten singles to 24 and Cyrus' to 9.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "In ancient Assyrian sources, the phrase \"son of a nobody\" (Akkadian:  mār lā mamman) is used to indicate a king of disreputable origins. Usurpers, lowborns, immoral rulers, and foreign kings were all commonly referred to as a “son of a nobody”.\nThe earliest instance of the phrase occurs in a fragmentary annal of Naram-Sin, who reigned in the 23rd century BCE, where it is used to deride the Gutian king Gula-AN.  Ashur-uballit I, who established the Middle Assyrian Empire in the 14th century BCE, used the term to describe a Kassite usurper installed by the army following the murder of the previous ruler, Kara-ḫardaš. The term found occasional usage in subsequent centuries, but became regularly used in royal documents beginning in the 9th century BCE. Dynastic lists from around this time began calling previous usurper kings “sons of a nobody” to indicate their non-royal ancestry, which consequently made them unqualified to govern according to the patrilineal principle of legitimacy relied upon by later monarchs. Beginning with Tiglath-Pileser III, royal annals begin employing the phrase “son of a nobody” much more frequently. Usage of the term was not universally negative, however, as Tiglath-Pileser notes the king of Tabal, whom he personally installed, behaves in the way prescribed by Assyrian state ideology in spite of his status as the “son of a nobody”. \nIn the time of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, the king Nabopolassar strikingly referred to himself as a “son of a nobody” in his own inscriptions, something that no previous Neo-Babylonian usurper king had done.\n\n\n== Notable “sons of a nobody” ==\nGula-AN (reigned 23rd century BCE)\nAššūr-dugul (r. 18th century BCE)\nAdasi (r. 18th century BCE)\nLullaya (r. 17th century BCE)\nNazi-Bugaš/Šuzigaš (r. 14th century BCE)\nHazael (r. 9th–8th century BCE)\nRukibtu (possibly, r. 8th century BCE)\nMushezib-Marduk (r. 7th century BCE)\nNabopolassar (r. 7th century BCE)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ay-Kul (Kyrgyz: Айкөл; Uzbek: Oydinkoʻl; Russian: Ай-Кёл), also called Oydinkul, is a small freshwater landslide dam in the Turkestan Range mountains in Kyrgyzstan, near the border with Tajikistan. The lake was formed after a massive landslide blocked the flow of the Ay-Kul Creek.\nAy-Kul is located approximately 20 kilometres (12 mi) km south of Razzakov. It has a surface elevation of 2,838–2,938 m (9,311–9,639 ft) and covers an area of .82–1.5 km2 (0.32–0.58 sq mi). There are no paved roads leading to Ay-Kul, and the lake lake is a popular destination for local hikers.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe Kyrgyz name for the lake is Ayköl (Айкөл), meaning \"moon lake\". In Uzbek, it is called Oydinkoʻl, meaning \"moonlit lake\" or \"clear lake\".\nAy-Kul hosts an array of legends and myths among local Uzbeks. A popular legend holds that a shepherd lost his crook (variously described as having unique carvings or fitted with gold coins) in the lake, but months later found it in a spring in Dehmoy, Tajikistan.\n\n\n== Hydrography ==\nAy-Kul is was formed after several cubic km of rock dislodged from the steeply sloped river valley of Ay-Kul Creek, a tributary of the Ak-Suu River. The lake freezes in late October and thaws in March.\nSources differ on the area of Ay-Kul, putting it from .82 km2 (0.32 sq mi) to 1.5 km2 (0.58 sq mi). It has a maximum length of 2.8–3.5 km (1.7–2.2 mi) and a maximum breadth of 0.5 km (0.31 mi).\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The City and County of Cardiff is a county in the south of Wales. It covers an area of 140.3 km2 (54.2 sq mi) and in 2023 the population was approximately 359,512. Cardiff is the country's capital and hosts its parliament, the Senedd, and a large number of national institutions such as the Wales Millennium Centre, the National Museum, the national stadium of Wales and the St Fagans National Museum of History.\nThe Cadw/ICOMOS Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales was established in 2002 and given statutory status in 2022. It is administered by Cadw, the historic environment agency of the Welsh Government.  It includes just under 400 sites, ranging from gardens of private houses, to cemeteries and public parks. Parks and gardens are listed at one of three grades, matching the grading system used for listed buildings. Grade I is the highest grade, for sites of exceptional interest; Grade II*, the next highest, denotes parks and gardens of more than special interest; while Grade II denotes nationally important sites of special interest.\nThere are 18 registered parks and gardens in Cardiff. Three are listed at grade I, five at II*, and ten at grade II. Sophia Gardens, Cathays Park, and Bute Park and the grounds of Cardiff Castle originally formed the castle estate. Pontcanna and Llandaff Fields run north from the centre, forming a very large public park. There are five smaller urban parks, six gardens to formerly private houses, the grounds of a hospital and a cemetery. A large number of the registered parks were designed by Andrew Pettigrew and his sons. Pettigrew came to Cardiff from his native Scotland in 1873, as head gardener to John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute. Over the following 60 years, he and his sons worked on most of the city's major parks; the Glamorgan Archives, which hold the records of Cardiff County Borough Council containing materials relating to the development of the city's parks, describes them collectively as \"the family who landscaped Cardiff\".\n\n\n== List of parks and gardens ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of scheduled monuments in Cardiff\nGrade I listed buildings in Cardiff\nGrade II* listed buildings in Cardiff\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nCrook, J.

        "content": "Acteon hebes is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Acteonidae.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe length of the shell attains 8 mm.\n(Original description) The white shell is not very small. It is short, stout and swollen. It is broad-ovate in form, with a short spire, (the apex is eroded in both our specimens). The body whorl is large, swollen, and constitutes the greater part of the shell. The suture is deeply impressed or slightly channeled. The whorl just below rises abruptly with a convex outline. The penultimate whorl is short, convex, and is surrounded by about three or four punctate grooves. The body whorl is strongly convex, but very slightly flattened in the middle, its upper portion decidedly swollen. It is covered by about twenty well-marked, revolving grooves, which are closely and very distinctly punctate, the punctations arranged very close together or in contact, and nearly uniform in size. The intervals between the grooves are rather broad and even, with a somewhat lustrous, nearly smooth surface, crossed by slightly sinuous lines of growth. The aperture is ear-shaped, rather broad, narrowed and rounded at the posterior angles, broadly rounded in front, with the inner margin sinuous and strongly excavated at the base of the columella, on which there is an oblique, slightly elevated, obtuse fold. \n\n\n== Distribution ==\nThis marine species occurs in the Atlantic Ocean off North Carolina and Georgia, USA. This is a deep-sea species, found at depths between 800 m and 4700 m.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVerrill, A. E. (1885).

        "content": "Ferien für immer. Die angenehmsten Orte der Welt (lit. 'Vacation forever. The most pleasant populated places in the world') is a 1998 book of travel writing by Christian Kracht and Eckhart Nickel.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nThe book consists of 66 travel reports, one to three pages long, from different locations around the world. It is presented as a guide to the authors' favourite places to visit and mostly covers hotels, bars and cafés. The texts occasionally include short musings on literature, art, history, music or fashion. Some anecdotes are fictional and intentionally written as obvious lies.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nBernhard Lill of Der Spiegel wrote he did not understand by the authors' intention with the book, which he called a \"pseudo-tour guide\" that is \"filled, but not with content\". He wrote that some of the anectdotes are funny, such as an obviously untrue story from a bar in Jerusalem where the authors witnessed Benjamin Netanyahu celebrating his election victory drunk and naked except for a Palestinian scarf. Lill criticised Kracht's writing style, which he said is influenced by Thomas Mann's long sentences but lack their content. He wrote that both authors fail to live up to their role models such as Peter Fleming and Evelyn Waugh. Ulla Biernat of Literaturkritik.de wrote that the book, with its ironic subtitle, is made for \"bored postmodern tourists\". She summarised it as a book where places are \"judged by the presence of other tourists and by the bizarreness of the hotels, restaurants and discos: tourist means a big minus, 'alcoholic's paradise' a fine plus\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKiepenheuer & Witsch",

        "content": "Alibaba Aani Chalishitale Chor (transl. Alibaba and Thieves in their Forties) is an Indian Marathi-language comedy drama film based on a play by the same name. Directed by Aditya Ingale, the film features an ensemble cast of Subodh Bhave, Atul Parchure, Anand Ingale, Umesh Kamat, Mukta Barve, Madhura Welankar Satam and Shruti Marathe. The plot revolves around seven friends who have been together for about 25 years and meet again in their forties.\nThe film was released on 29 March 2024, with positive reviews.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThere are three married couples and one bachelor who are all friends. Parag works as an executive and his wife, Aditi, is a boutique owner and fashion designer. Sumitra is a homemaker, while her husband works as a radiologist. Varun is a physics professor, and his wife, Shalaka, teaches chemistry. Abhishek is an unmarried artist. They all attend a party at the doctor's farmhouse, but an unexpected event prompts them to leave early. During the party, the lights go out, and everyone hears the sound of a kiss followed by a slap. It becomes clear that someone in their group forcefully kissed someone else, resulting in a slap in return. The story revolves around uncovering who was involved in this incident, exploring various possibilities and scenarios.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nSubodh Bhave as Parag\nAtul Parchure as Doctor\nAnand Ingale as Varun\nUmesh Kamat as Abhishek\nMukta Barve as Sumitra\nMadhura Welankar Satam as Shalaka\nShruti Marathe as Aditi\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe original Marathi play Alibaba Aani Chalishitale Chor was also written by Vivek Bele, although it was directed by Ajit Bhure. Varun is played by actor Anand Ingale, who was also in the original play.\n\n\n== Soundtrack ==\nThe music was composed by Ajit Parab and Agnel Roman, while the background score was done by Roman.\n\n\n== Release and marketing ==\nThe film was officially announced on 22 February 2024, along with the release date. It was announced with a teaser featuring all the lead actors holding a black board on which their names, crimes, and ages were displayed. The poster was dropped on 28 February 2024, and the artists' weird, inquiring expressions suggest that something is wrong. The teaser was dropped during the second week of March, followed by the first song. On 18 March 2024, the official trailer was released. \nAfter a successful week in theaters, the film was impacted by online piracy as it became available on pirate sites and illicit movie streaming services.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nKalpeshraj Kubal of The Times of India rated it 3 out of 5 stars and wrote, \"Alibaba Ani Chalishitale Chor promises is an engaging watch. With relatability and humour, the film also touches upon issues like suppressed desires, extramarital affairs, jealousy and more.\" Keerti Kadam for CineBuster praised the screenplay, dialogue and performance, while saying, \"The 'suspense' around the kiss and the slap is built successfully without giving away anything till the climax,\" giving 3.5 out of 5 stars. Cine Blitz critic Jyothi Venkatesh gave 3 out of 5 stars and noted, \"What is interesting about the film is that though it is verbose to a large extent, and extremely dialogue-heavy as it has been adapted from the stage, where visual representations take centre stage, dealing with the way the director has tackled the intertwined relations, midlife crisis etc, the story is as relevant as it was when it was first executed on stage.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAlibaba Aani Chalishitale Chor at IMDb",

        "content": "The monumental tomb of King Charles III of Navarre and his queen, Eleanor of Castile, in Pamplona Cathedral was constructed in the Gothic style between late 1413 and mid-1419. The work by a team of craftsmen from France, Burgundy and the Burgundian Netherlands was overseen by Johan Lome.\nThe tomb sparked a fad for funerary monuments in Navarre, which had been rare up to that time. Charles III's freestanding bed, however, was not imitated, later monuments being of the arcosolium variety.\n\n\n== Artists ==\nThe names of seven men who worked on the tomb under Lome are known. Many of them are described in documents as \"French\". Two, Michel and Collin, were from Reims. Michel de Reims, a painter, came to Navarre with Lome in 1411. He and Anequín de Sora were the most important collaborators. The others were Viçent Huyart, Johan de Lille from Flanders, Johan de La Garnie from Picardy and a certain Johan from Burgundy.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe design of the tomb was inspired by the tomb of Charles V of France and his queen, which was designed by André Beauneveu and Jean de Liège, and the tomb of Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, which was designed by Claus Sluter. It is a freestanding structure, constructed of sandstone and alabaster. Green and white paint have been used to make the sandstone bed appear like marble. There are some touches of coloured paint and gilding, but the precious stones which once existed are lost.\nStatues of the king and queen are recumbent atop the false marble slab. They are both crowned with their heads resting on pillows beneath Gothic canopies. The king is wearing his coronation robes and his feet rest on a lion, a symbol of strength. His face is thought to be a portrait. The queen is wearing fashionable clothes and her feet rest on two dogs fighting over a bone, \"an allusion to human life gnawed by time.\" Her face is idealized and does not seem to be a portrait.\nThe base of the tomb is covered in carved mourners (plorantes) representing the funeral procession. These include cardinals, bishops, canons, monks and laymen in complementary pairs. They have sometimes been taken to represent contemporary persons, but Clara Fernández-Ladreda Aguadé considers this unlikely.\n\n\n== Epitaphs ==\nThe tomb has two carved and gilded Romance epitaphs in Gothic script on the top of the canopies. That for Charles III also extends around the edge of the table. It mentions his descent from Charlemagne and Saint Louis while extolling his recovery of \"a great part of boroughs and castles of his kingdom which were in the hands of the king of Castile\", his recovery of his patrimony in France that had been confiscated, his building projects and how he \"ennobled  and  exalted  [many] who were his subjects.\"\nThe epitaph for the queen is much shorter. She is described as \"a very good queen, wise and devout\". In both epitaphs Charles is numbered IIII (a variant of the Roman numeral IV), which is probably best explained by the reference to Charlemagne, who ruled over part of Navarre and may have been considered the first Charles. The death dates of the king and queen, however, appear to be in error in both epitaphs. This probably indicates that they are later additions to the tomb.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nCastro, José Ramón. Carlos III el Noble, rey de Navarra.

        "content": "Herederos del Marqués de Riscal, S.A., better known as Marqués de Riscal is a large Spanish winery located in Elciego, in the Rioja Alavesa.The company was founded by Camilo Hurtado de Amézaga, 6th Marquess of Riscal in 1858 after inheriting a series of wineries in Elciego from his father.\nIn 2006 the Elciego wineries were transformed into the City of Wine, a complex that includes the primary wineries, the most modern ones, the vineyards and a leisure complex that includes the Marqués de Riscal Hotel, an emblematic building designed by the architect Frank Gehry and inaugurated by Juan Carlos I in 2003.Since its origin in the 19th century, Marqués de Riscal has produced Rioja wine, but in 1972 it also settled in Rueda to produce white wine that in 1980 would receive the designation of origin of Rueda wine. Riscal was the first non-French wine to receive a Honorific Diploma at the International Wine Exposition of Bordeaux, in 1895.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe company owes its name to the eponymous hereditary peerage title, which had been granted by Philip V of Spain to Baltasar Hurtado de Amézaga, a lieutenant general that was governor of Málaga and was distinguished in service in Spanish Flanders and in the Battle of Zenta.\nIt was Camilo Hurtado de Amézaga, 6th Marquess of Riscal, who was the driving force behind the creation of the wineries that bear the name of \"Herederos del Marqués de Riscal\" (Heirs of the Marquess of Riscal). He was residing in Bordeaux when he received the order from the Provincial Council of Álava to hire an oenologist who could teach the region's growers the techniques used in the Médoc, to produce wines according to the French system. The chosen expert was Jean Pineau, cellar master of the Château Lanessan cellars, with whom he signed, representing the Provincial Council, a contract to advise Álava producers. Hurtado then sent \"9,000 fully guaranteed vine shoots\" to the Rioja Alavesa, of the following types: Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec and Pinot noir, to experiment in their vineyards, where grapes had been grown of the Tempranillo and Graciano varieties.\nIn 1858 Hurtado, who had inherited some wineries in Elciego from his father, founded the wineries applying the techniques used in France, and hired Pineau full-time, who had stopped working for the deputation. In the 1895 edition of the International Exposition of Bordeaux, Marqués de Riscal became the first non-French winery to receive the Diploma of Honor.\n\n\n== Production ==\nIn 2021, the company had revenues of €72m, employed 310 people and exported to over 110 countries around the world. It puts on the market more than 7 million bottles of red and white wine, in addition to 200,000 of Laurent-Perrier sparkling wine.\nWithin the Rioja designation of origin, Marqués de Riscal sells red wine with the labels Frank Gehry Selection 2001, Barón de Chirel, Marqués de Riscal 150 Anniversary, Marqués de Riscal Gran Reserva, Finca Torrea, Marqués de Riscal Reserva, Marqués de Riscal Rosado and Marqués de Arienzo.\nThe white wine of the Rueda designation of origin is made up of the brands Marqués de Riscal Limousin, Finca Montico, Marqués de Riscal Sauvignon Blanc and Marqués de Riscal Rueda Verdejo.\nAdditionally, within the Vinos de la Tierra de Castilla y León denomination, it markets Riscal 1860, the only red wine it produces outside of La Rioja.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMarquess of Riscal (title)\nBodegas Marqués de Murrieta\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Hendrik Frederik Prinsloo was a Second Boer War commander of the Carolina Commando for the South African Republic who fought and prevailed at the Battle of Spion Kop (Afrikaans: Die slag van Spioenkop). His son and namesake Hendrik Frederik Prinsloo (1890–1966) served as an officer in the South African Army in both World War I and World War II.\n\n\n== Family ==\nPrinsloo was born in 1861 Kroonstad, Orange Free State, to Hendrik Frederik Prinsloo (12 May 1834, Albany, Cape Colony, South Africa - 20 March 1897, Marabastad, South African Republic) and Christina Johanna Sophia Dreyer (around 1837, Cape Colony - 4 March 1897, Marabastad) as the second son out of five sons among in total 10 children. He married Cecilia Maria Steyn (22 January 1865, Carolina, South Africa - 28 June 1910, Carolina, South Africa), a daughter of general Johannes Petrus Steyn (1833–1887), and had two daughters and three sons by her. Prinsloo's third child and first son was his namesake Hendrik Frederik Prinsloo (1890–1966).\n\n\n== Second Boer War ==\nAt the outbreak of the Second Boer war in 1899, Prinsloo was a field cornet for one of the three wijken (sectors) of Carolina, South Africa. When commander David Joubert stepped down, Prinsloo was chosen as his successor. Prinsloo fought in Natal and commanded Boer troops at the Battle of Spioenkop.\nThere he was sent in on 24 January 1900 by General Schalk Willem Burger to recapture the strategic hilltop Spionkop near the Tugela River occupied by the British. He invited his soldiers to storm Spioenkop with the words \n\n“Citizens, we are going to the enemy from below and not all will come back. Do your duty and trust in the Lord\", \"Come Citizens!\" \nGeneral Louis Botha sent promised reinforcement, and due to Boer artillery support from neighbouring hilltops and Prinsloo's initiative he prevailed over a superior British force.\nLater he was killed in action together with general Joachim Christoffel Fourie by the British at Witkloof in the Battle of Leliefontein (Battle of Witkloof), district Carolina, on 7 November 1900. His burgher soldiers felt so dejected by the loss of Prinsloo that they did not pursue the fleeing enemy.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBattle of Spion Kop\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Literature ==\nA.E., Onze Krijgs-officieren.

It broadcasts on VHF channel 11, as part of the Red Universitaria Boliviana de Información (Red Rubi) in the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTVU was the first channel to go on air in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, as up until then, television was limited to La Paz and surrounding areas, by means of Televisión Boliviana, the state channel.\nThe channel started experimental broadcasts on March 1, 1973, using a homemade transmitter with a 5-watt radius broadcasting on channel 8. The channel broadcast three days a week, its first director was Noel Alderete Arteaga and Alfredo Quiroz the first technician. In 1978, it started color broadcasting and moved to channel 11, its current frequency. In 1986 it acquired a powerful 10 kW transmitter by means of a Japanese donation.\nThe emergence of private television networks caused the university networks to dwindle their viewer base, even though they did not have commercial funds to sustain them.\nIn 2013, the station was introducing a new transmitter enabling viewers to receive the signal with better quality.\nOn November 11, 2019, TVU was one of the media outlets that announced a voluntary shutdown due to threats facing the resignation of Evo Morales.\nAn agreement was signed with Cooperativa Rural de Electrificación in August 2023, with the aim of digitizing the signal.\n\n\n== References ==",

A notable discovery in Georgia (Kobuleti) was a silver coin of Amissos from the 4th century BC, featuring on the obverse the profile of a woman—either Hera or the nymph Amissos—and on the reverse, a spread-winged eagle with the Greek inscription 'ΠΕΙΡΑ' (meaning 'trial' or 'attempt'), which refers to the city of Amissos, and dates the coin from the 5th to the 4th centuries BC.\nAdditionally, bronze coins of Amissos, minted between 105 and 90 BC, have been found more frequently in various locations, including Vani, Sukhumi, Mtskheta, among others. These coins feature the Gorgon Medusa on the obverse and the goddess of victory, Nike, on the reverse, accompanied by the Greek inscription 'ΑΜΙΣΟΥ' (Amissos).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAncient Coinage of Pontos, Amisos\nPontos, Amisos, Silver Siglos",

        "content": "Conocybe vaginata is a species of mushroom-producing fungus in the family Bolbitiaceae.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIt was described in 1979 by the Scottish mycologist Roy Watling who classified it as Conocybe vaginata.\nIt is notable as being one of the few Conocybe species which has a volva and subsequently was placed in Conocybe sect. Singerella along with the other volvate species.\n\n\n== Description ==\nConocybe vaginata is a small volvate mushroom.\nCap: 1.4-2cm wide starting hemispherical to ovoid to campanulate before expanding with age. The hygrophanous surface is smooth, dry and very striated with a brownish or greyish beige colour. Stem: 7-7.6cm long and 1-2mm thick. The surface is white and smooth with a pubescent coating all over but no striations. It is very fragile and hollow with a swollen base that sits inside the persistent, membranous white volva. Gills: Free to adnexed, greyish beige to pale rust coloured becoming more rust brown with age. They are narrow and ventricose. Spores: (11) 11.5-12.5 (13) x 8.5-10 x 6.5-8 μm. Broadly ellipsoid and smooth with a thick wall and large germ pore. Yellow-brown in water turning red-brown in KOH. Basidia: (17.5) 20-24 x 12-15 μm. Clavate and hyaline in water or alkaline mounts.\n\n\n== Habitat and distribution ==\nThe specimens studied by Watling were found under bamboo in Castanopsis and Araucaria woodland and on rotten wood in Castanopsis forests in New Guinea.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Rebecca Ann Turner (born 17 September 1977), known as Becky Turner, is a retired American rhythmic gymnast. She was part of the national senior group.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBecky Turner started out in artistic gymnastics for three years before switching to rhythmic. She was on the US national rhythmic gymnastics team from 1994 to 1997, being part of the national senior group along Aliane Baquerot, Lori Fredreickson, Mandy James, Ginny Ledgerwood, Kate Nelson, Brandi Siegel and Challen Sievers. They all lived together in suburban Chicago largely due to Sievers’ father, Ron, whose construction firm renovated the house where the gymnasts lived and converted a former racquetball complex into the gym where they trained.\nIn 1994 the group was 19th at the World Championships in Paris. They won silver at the 1995 Pan American Games in Mar del Plata.\nIn the summer of 1996 Becky, Mandy James, Aliane Mata-Baquerot, Kate Nelson, Brandi Siegel and Challen Sievers were selected to compete at the Olympic Games in Atlanta, the first edition to feature the group competition. They finished in 9th place and so did not advance to the final.\nShe also competed at the 1996 World Championships, and placed second in the group at the 1995 Four Continents Championships.\nTurner attended Kennesaw State University in Georgia after the Olympics. She later taught and coached rhythmic gymnastics at Elite Rhythmic Gymnastics in Downers Grove, Illinois.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "revision_id": 1219856164,
        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Mental health is essential for individuals' well-being and functioning, encompassing cognitive abilities, emotional understanding, and interpersonal interactions. Students worldwide consider psychological well-being, happiness, and contentment as essential life values. Research indicates that students' well-being is greatly influenced by specific needs, including the ability to make choices, express oneself freely, pursue passions and interests, achieve success, and feel psychologically and socially secure. Moreover, global studies suggest that an increased sense of well-being is associated with enhanced academic achievement, interpersonal relationships, and overall health.\nResearch indicates that despite scoring higher on international tests, Chinese students report lower levels of well-being compared to their counterparts in other countries.\n\n\n== Current situation ==\n\n\n=== Primary and high school students ===\nAdolescence is a critical phase for establishing psychological well-being. Adolescents facing mental health issues may encounter challenges in adulthood and are more likely to continue experiencing mental health difficulties as they mature.\nRecent social reforms and rapid economic development in China have significantly impacted the mental health of children and adolescents. This includes heightened social stress, increased labor migration, and shifts in family planning, which have altered traditional family structures and social support systems. Numerous studies have suggested that academic stressors, including academic workload, exam failures, interpersonal conflicts, and family financial issues, are the primary sources of stress in the daily lives of Chinese adolescents.\nStudents encounter various academic demands in school, including exams, competition with peers, and meeting the expectations of teachers and parents, all of which contribute to academic stress. An empirical study using the Middle School Students’ Academic Stressors Questionnaire (SSA) to explore academic stress among junior high school students in northwestern China's Gansu province (seventh to ninth grade). Their findings revealed that stress often stems from parental and teacher expectations and peer competition. Similar results have been observed among Chinese students in other regions such as Ürümqi.\nBesides, financial stress and interpersonal stress were found to have association with Chinese adolescents' wellbeings. However, academic stress seems to be the predominant stressor.\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities students ===\nThe significance of college and university students extends beyond individual development, as their physical and mental health affect both personal growth and the nation's future. Consequently, their mental well-being has garnered attention from families, educational institutions, and society as a whole.\nA meta-analysis investigated the prevalence of the most common mental health issues among college students in mainland China from 2010 to 2020 via consideration about various moderating factors. Two categories of mental health problems were selected: internalizing disorders encompass anxiety, depression, sleep issues, somatization, and suicidal ideation; externalizing issues include non-suicidal self-harm and suicide attempts. The result suggested that:\n\nOver the past decade, there has been a notable rise in the prevalence of anxiety, depression, sleep issues, and suicide attempts among college students.\nThe prevalence rates of various disorders among Chinese college students are as follows: sleep issues (23.5%), depression (20.8%), nonsuicidal self-injury (16.2%), anxiety (13.7%), suicidal thoughts (10.8%), somatization (4.5%), and suicide attempts (2.7%). These findings suggest a higher occurrence of internalizing problems compared to externalizing problems among this demographic.\nSignificant regional disparities were observed in the prevalence of sleep issues and suicidal thoughts among college students, indicating poorer mental health in western China and relatively better mental health in northeastern and central regions.\n\n\n=== International students ===\nThe influx of Chinese students to the United States surged in the 1980s due to the implementation of the \"open-door policy.\" Since then, China has consistently ranked among the top sources of international students in the United States. As of 2011–2012, Chinese students constituted the largest group of international students in the United States, numbering 194,029.\nHowever, as a result of cultural adjustments and transitions, international students have distinct support requirements that increase their vulnerability to various psychological issues. Moreover, Chinese education system prioritizes effort and excellence while demonstrating less tolerance for underperformance. Chinese students are accustomed to early academic competition and internalize these cultural values, potentially influencing their behavior, interactions in class, and responses to academic stressors.\nA survey among Chinese international students at Yale University showed that 45% percent experienced signs of depression, while 29% displayed symptoms of anxiety. Additionally, 27% of respondents were unaware of the mental health and counseling services offered on campus. An studies indicated that Chinese students are less inclined to seek formal mental health support compared to local students, preferring instead to rely on informal support from friends. Factors such as self-perceived poor health, a strained relationship with one's advisor, and low physical activity levels were linked to higher rates of depression and anxiety symptoms.\n\n\n== Other Contributing factors ==\n\n\n=== Academic stress ===\nChinese adolescents navigate a cultural and educational system distinct from that of Western countries. Students in China contend with rigorous academic competitions, such as the national college entrance examination, which begins in childhood. In Chinese society, there is a widespread belief that attending prestigious schools can lead to lucrative careers and long-term happiness for children. However, many Chinese families currently face the challenge of educational anxiety as they pursue these goals. Despite Chinese students' high global rankings in academics, including reading, mathematics, and science, their life satisfaction scores, which are crucial for mental health assessment, are notably low. This trend reflects increasing academic competition, resulting in heightened financial and time investments in education, as well as an upsurge in extracurricular tutoring and a heavy academic workload for students.\n\n\n=== COVID-19 ===\nAccording to several review studies, the prevalence of psychological distress including stress, anxiety, depression and PTSD symptoms has been notably heightened in correlation with the COVID-19 pandemic. The likelihood of experiencing increased depressive symptoms was notably higher among Chinese students when compared to individuals in other occupational situations such as employment or retirement. The emotional distress stemming from school closures, social event cancellations, difficulties in adapting to remote learning, and exam postponements has been noted to impact students significantly. According to an meta-analysis, approximately 24.9% of Chinese college students experienced symptoms of anxiety during the COVID-19 outbreak. The shift to online learning was reported to bring the challenges, fostering feelings of loneliness, disconnection, and difficulty adapting to new environments. Residing in urban areas, living with parents, and maintaining a stable family income were protective factors against anxiety among college students. Conversely, having a family member or acquaintance infected with COVID-19 significantly increased anxiety risk. Economic impacts also be found to added financial stress for students and families.\n\n\n=== Rural Area ===\nThe majority of research indicates that rural children and adolescents experience poorer mental health compared to their urban counterparts. Studies found a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms among adolescents from rural areas compared to those from urban areas. However, some studies produced inconclusive or contradictory results which observed no significant difference in the mental health of college students between rural and urban areas.\nA research comparing the general well-being of children left behind versus those not left behind revealed that, on average, left-behind children scored lower on the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory. Although there were no notable variations in mean scores related to physical health, left-behind children exhibited significantly lower scores in areas concerning psychosocial summary, emotional and social functioning, as well as school performance. A meta-analysis encompassing 1465 left-behind children and 1401 children from intact family environments, indicates a consistent trend that left-behind children tend to exhibit notably elevated levels of anxiety, loneliness, fear, and self-attribution.\n\n\n== Initiatives and policies ==\nIn China, the focus on children and adolescents' mental well-being is emphasized through three interconnected policy frameworks: inclusion in national policies, integration into maternal and child health initiatives, and dedicated policies for this demographic. Mental health promotion programs within schools are recognized as effective initiatives. Recent efforts aim to reduce academic stress, notably through the introduction of the \"Double Reduction Policy\" in July 2021, mandating schools to decrease excessive homework and off-campus training. Primary schools, under China's nine-year compulsory education program, play a significant role in promoting child mental health, with initiatives aimed at achieving widespread mental health education coverage. Provisions introduced in the revised 'Mental Health Law of the People's Republic of China' emphasize the availability of psychologists and counselors in schools at all levels, alongside the requirement for preschools to conduct mental health education. Additionally, schools are obliged to provide psychological counseling and support to students in need. In 2016, various ministries jointly released the 'Guiding Opinions on Strengthening Mental Health Services,' emphasizing the need for improved mental health services across educational institutions.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTypes of universities and colleges in China\nMental health in China\nMental health in education\n\n\n== References ==",

Like other Soviet public organizations, it was under the control of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) - CPSU . The society had a publishing house \"Znanie\".\nAfter the collapse of the USSR, the property of the society on the territory of Russia passed to the Knowledge Society of Russia, which became the legal successor of the all-Union Knowledge Society. The new organization fell into decline in the 1990s: the number of members decreased and many regional branches disappeared. In June 2016, the congress of the Knowledge Society of Russia decided to liquidate this organization. A new state-public organization “Znanie” was created, which is not the official successor of the previous society.",

        "content": "Conocybe corneri is a species of mushroom-producing fungus in the family Bolbitiaceae.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIt was described in 1979 by the Scottish mycologist Roy Watling who classified it as Conocybe corneri.\nIt is notable as being one of the few Conocybe species which has a volva and subsequently was placed in Conocybe sect. Singerella along with the other volvate species.\n\n\n== Description ==\nConocybe corneri is a small volvate mushroom.\nCap: 2-6cm wide and 1.5-2.5cm high starting conical then umbonate before flattening with age. The surface is dark purple with fine striations when young but it becomes wine red or reddish grey as it ages. It is hygrophanous and smooth with finely pubescent white hairs. The flesh is 1-1.5mm thick in the centre of the cap and is concolorous with the exterior surface. Stem: 10-16cm long and 2-3mm thick tapering upwards from a 5-7mm base. The surface is covered in fine pubescent hairs with spiraling striations up its length and is white towards the apex and base. The white floccose-membranous volva measures 8-12 x 7-9mm and splits irregularly or splits in half. Gills: Free or slightly adnexed, crowded and initially white turning pale ochre-cinnamon from the margins towards the stem. Spore print: Brown. Spores: 8.5-11 x 6-6.5 μm. Broadly ellipsoid to angular in face view and slightly flattened on one side in side view. Smooth with a very distinct apiculus and germ pore. Basidia: 26-30 x 11-12 μm. 4 spored, clavate and hyaline in water or alkaline mounts.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe specific epithet corneri is named for the English mycologist E. J. H. Corner who collected the holotype specimen in 1940.\n\n\n== Habitat and distribution ==\nThe specimens studied by Watling were found on elephant dung in Malaya and on the forest floor in New Guinea. It was also cultivated for study in the Singapore Botanic Gardens by incubating elephant dung from the forest in under bell jars demonstrating that the growth of the mushroom is first visible in the early morning with the cap opening after dark whilst the volva remains immersed in the dung where it is inconspicuous.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Gerry Austin T. Abadiano (born March 8, 2001) is a Filipino college basketball player for the UP Fighting Maroons of the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP). He has won championships in the juniors and seniors division of the UAAP, and has played for the Philippine national under-19 team and under-17 team.\n\n\n== High school career ==\n\n\n=== Adamson Baby Falcons ===\nAs a Grade 6 student coming from St. Roberts International Academy who had just competed in the Palarong Pambansa, Abadiano was discovered by Coach Goldwin Monteverde, who recruited him to play for Adamson High School beginning in UAAP Season 79 (2016–17 season). Unfortunately, most of their wins that season were forfeited as they fielded an ineligible player in guard Encho Serrano. In his final game for them, he had 11 points. \n\n\n=== NU Bullpups ===\n\n\n==== Red-shirt season ====\nAfter that season, Abadiano, along with his teammate Carl Tamayo, followed Coach Monteverde in transferring from Adamson to Nazareth School of National University. Him and Tamayo had to serve residency for Season 80. The NU Bullpups then won tournaments such as the NBTC League (in which he was named Finals Most Outstanding Player), the 2018 Palarong Pambansa (in which he made the Mythical Five along with his teammates Tamayo and Terrence Fortea), and the 2018 ASEAN School Games.\n\n\n==== Season 81: First championship ====\nThe Bullpups opened their Season 81 campaign in 2018 with a win over the FEU Baby Tamaraws, in which Abadiano scored 10 points and three assists. In a 50-point blowout win over the UPIS Junior Maroons, he had 14 points, five assists, two rebounds and two steals. He followed that up with 17 points in a 72-point win over the UE Junior Warriors. Against the Ateneo Blue Eaglets, he had 16 points, five rebounds, and two assists to close out the first round of eliminations. \nIn their rematch against Ateneo in the second round of eliminations, Abadiano scored 16 points and they eventually won again. His performance in that game put him on top of the NBTC UAAP 24 high school rankings. He had a double-double of 20 points and 15 rebounds in a win over the Zobel Junior Archers. They went on to sweep the second round and finished fourth in the NBTC rankings. They met Ateneo again in the Finals, where in Game 2, he was ejected from the game late in the fourth quarter with eight points and nine rebounds. Despite his absence, NU held on to win the juniors' championship for the first time since 2016.\n\n\n==== Season 82: Second championship ====\nBefore the start of Season 82, NU successfully defended its NBTC League title, becoming the first back-to-back champions in league history. They also successfully defended their ASEAN School Games title, in which they defeated Indonesia for the gold medal. NU swept the elimination rounds, earning an outright spot in the Finals. NU then swept the Baby Tamaraws in the Finals, with Abadiano contributing in Game 2 with 20 points, five rebounds, five steals and four assists. He finished his high school career with averages of 11.3 points, 3.2 rebounds, 2.3 assists, and 1.1 steals. He also finished 16th in the NBTC 24 rankings.\n\n\n== College career ==\n\n\n=== UP Fighting Maroons ===\nOn August 1, 2020, it was announced that both Abadiano and Tamayo had committed to the UP Fighting Maroons. Several weeks later, their high school coach Monteverde resigned from NU, who was supposed to be the head coach for the senior team of NU. Another former teammate, Cyril Gonzales, left Mapúa to join them at UP. In 2021, two more of Abadiano's former teammates reunited with him at UP, with guards Fortea and Harold Alarcon also committing to UP. That year, Coach Monteverde was named head coach for the Maroons, reuniting him with many of his former players.\n\n\n==== Rookie season and first UAAP seniors' championship ====\nAbadiano made his UAAP seniors' debut in Season 84. In his rookie season, he was the backup point guard to JD Cagulangan, and often played the role of a defensive specialist. He played a crucial role in their semis win over the DLSU Green Archers. This set them up for a best-of-three Finals match against defending champions Ateneo. In Game 3 of the finals, UP won the game with Cagulangan making the game-winning shot. This ended UP's 36-year title drought and made him a champion once again. He also competed in the UAAP 3x3 competition that season.\n\n\n==== 2022–23: Runner-up finishes ====\nAbadiano continued in his role as a defensive stopper and backup to Cagulangan in Season 85. He would occasionally have higher scoring games, such as when he scored 13 points in a win over UE Red Warriors while limiting UE's Kyle Paranada to 4-of-11 shooting. In their semis win over NU, he scored a go-ahead basket, then Cagulangan sealed the win with another three pointer the following play. UP would lose in a finals rematch to Ateneo that season.\nAbadiano had offers to transfer to other schools, but he stayed with UP. In Season 86, after missing two games due to concussion protocol, he returned with 13 points, four rebounds, and two assists in a clutch win over DLSU. His midrange jumper with 1:01 left in the game gave UP the lead. In a loss to Ateneo, he had 12 points. A week later, they rematched, this time without lead guards Cagulangan and CJ Cansino due to a hamstring injury and an illness respectively. Abadiano stepped up, and scored a career-high 22 points to lead UP past Ateneo. Once again, UP made the finals, but lost to DLSU.\n\n\n== National team career ==\n\n\n=== Junior national team ===\nAbadiano then played for the Philippines in the 2018 FIBA Under-17 Basketball World Cup. He had 17 points each in losses to France and Argentina. Against Canada, he led the team with 19 points on 7-of-11 shooting, but they lost by 40 and were relegated to the classification phase. In the Philippines' first win of the tournament, he contributed 15 points as they won over Egypt. He also played in the 2018 FIBA Under-18 Asian Championship.\nIn 2019, Tamayo played in that year's FIBA Under-19 World Cup. He averaged 8.4 points and 2.1 assists in that tournament. He also represented the Philippines in the 2019 FIBA 3x3 U-18 Asia Cup.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nProfile at FIBA website",

It will take place during Memorial Day weekend on May 26, 2024, at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in the Las Vegas suburb of Paradise, Nevada. The event returns Double or Nothing to the MGM Grand after five years, which is where the inaugural 2019 event was held.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\n\nDouble or Nothing is considered All Elite Wrestling's (AEW) marquee event, having first been held in 2019, which was the promotion's first professional wrestling event and first pay-per-view (PPV) produced. It is held annually in May during Memorial Day weekend and is one of AEW's \"Big Four\" PPVs, which includes All Out, Full Gear, and Revolution, their four biggest shows produced quarterly. The event's name is a reference to its Las Vegas theme and it is traditionally held in the Las Vegas area in Paradise, Nevada. Exceptions from this norm occurred in 2020 and 2021 due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions that were in place at the time, but they maintained the Vegas theme. \nOn March 27, 2024, it was announced that the sixth Double or Nothing event would take place on May 26 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena, marking a return to the venue after five years, which was when the inaugural 2019 event was held there. It was also announced that during Double or Nothing weekend, Saturday Night Collision the night before on May 25 would also be held at the venue.\n\n\n=== Storylines ===\nDouble or Nothing will feature professional wrestling matches that involve different wrestlers from pre-existing feuds and storylines. Storylines are produced on AEW's weekly television programs, Dynamite, Rampage, and Collision.\n\n\n== Matches ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAll Elite Wrestling website",

        "revision_id": 1216897704,
        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Azure Maps is a suite of cloud-based, location-based services provided by Microsoft as part of the company's Azure platform. The platform provides geospatial and location-based services via REST APIs and software development kits (SDKs). The service is typically used to integrate maps or geospatial data into applications.\nAzure Maps differs from Microsoft's other enterprise mapping service, Bing Maps, in its pricing model, focus on privacy, and its level of integration into the broader Azure cloud ecosystem.\n\n\n== History ==\nAzure Maps was first introduced in public preview mode under the name \"Azure Location Based Services\" in 2017, primarily as an enterprise solution. The services was intended to add mapping and location-based functionality onto the existing Azure cloud services suite, seen as a critical part of Microsoft's broader Internet-of-Things (IoT) strategy.\nThe preview version included APIs which could be used to develop location aware apps for use cases such as logistics and mobility. In 2018, the software was renamed \"Azure Maps,\" and became generally available to the public, and a number of new functions were added, including route calculation, travel time calculation, and incorporation of real-time traffic data and incident information.\nAzure Maps was integrated with Azure IoT Central in 2018, which added tracking, monitoring, and geofencing capabilities. A set of mobility APIs on were added in 2019, with applications such as use in public transport apps and shared bicycle fleet management. “Azure Maps Creator,” which converts private facility floor plans into indoor map data, was also introduced in 2019. Some commentators linked these services to Microsoft's broader development of augmented reality products.\nIn 2020, Azure Maps Visual for Power BI was released, integrating location-based features and mapping capabilities into Microsoft's business intelligence software.\nAn elevation API (which was later retired), geolocation services, and an iOS and Android software development kit were introduced in 2021.\nIn 2022, support for historical weather, air quality, and tropical storm data was made generally available and custom styling for indoor maps was also introduced. In 2023, Azure Maps was certified as HIPAA compliant in a move to target healthcare and health insurance companies.\n\n\n== Functionality ==\n\n\n=== Geocoding ===\n\nGeocoding is one of the core functionalities of Azure Maps, converting addresses or place names into geographic coordinates. Batch geocoding is used to process large amounts of address data, a function used for route optimization and spatial analysis.\n\n\n=== Reverse geocoding ===\nReverse geocoding derives human-readable information from geographic coordinates like longitude and latitude, used in navigation and by geographic information systems.\n\n\n=== Routing ===\nAzure Maps uses map data and routing algorithms to calculate the shortest or fastest routes between locations based on factors like vehicle size and type, traffic conditions, and distance. Routing also supports multi-modal routing, which include multiple modes of transport in a single trip, including cycling, walking, and ferries.\nThis functionality is used for location-based searches and route optimization in applications like fleet management, proximity marketing, and emergency services as well as logistics and delivery, urban planning, ride sharing apps, and outdoor activities.\n\n\n=== Map visualization ===\nThe platform supports map visualizations that can be modified to reflect real-time data (including from IoT sensors) as well as historical data patterns. Visualizations include heat maps, street maps, satellite imagery and other custom data layers. Maps are rendered using raster or vector tiles which reduce the load of displaying large data sets or complex maps.\nThis can be used in various applications in areas like transportation, smart cities, retail and marketing, public health, and environmental monitoring. For example, it can be used for tracking the spread of diseases or measuring the impact of changing climatic patterns.\n\n\n=== Geofencing and spatial analytics ===\nAzure Maps supports polygonal geofencing, which enables the definition of custom geographic boundaries. Geofenced areas can be monitored in real-time for events of interest. For example, an application could send an alert when equipment or persons enter or leave a defined area.\nTools for analyzing historical geofencing data are also available via the APIs for optimization purposes.\n\n\n== Industry usage ==\nAzure Maps' geofencing function has seen usage in the construction industry, designating hazardous areas for safety purposes and sending alerts if anyone enters the area. Private facility maps are used by construction companies for monitoring large construction sites to increase productivity and prevent accidents or damage.\nIn emergency management, New Zealand based company Beca has used Azure Maps to provide analysis on the impact of earthquakes to users, including information on the severity and location of an earthquake and the impact on affected properties. Alaska's Department of Transportation uses Azure Maps as part of an information system providing weather-related warnings and analytics to road crews.\nAirmap, an airspace management platform for drones, uses Azure Maps.\nAzure Maps has also been used in conjunction with Azure Monitor for risk monitoring by an insurance company.\nOther companies that use or have used Azure Maps include BMW, Banco Santander, Jvion, MV Transportation, C.H. Robertson, Wise Skulls, Tata Consultancy Services, Providence Health and Services, Gas Brasiliano Distribuidora S.A., Shell plc, Persistent Systems, Phase 2 Dining and Entertainment, Symbio, HID, Globant, and Insight Enterprises.\n\n\n== Partnerships ==\nAzure Maps and TomTom have been partners since 2016, and TomTom provides location data to Azure Maps and can process data from Azure Maps for mapping purposes.\nIn 2021, Azure Maps partnered with AccuWeather to make climatic data available via its APIs, making weather data along all parts of calculated routes available for mobility and logistics purposes.\nMicrosoft has partnered with Esri, the developer of ArcGIS, and there is cross-compatibility between Azure and ArcGIS so that data from Azure Maps can be integrated into ArcGIS and vice versa.\nAzure Maps partnered with Moovit in 2019, a startup providing software that interfaces with public transport data. Moovit's database on global public transit networks, including information on which stations and facilities are wheelchair accessible, was linked to Azure Maps. This service was  noted for its use increasing accessibility to public transport for the visually impaired by means of voice activated route planning assistance.\nNORAD has used some Azure Maps functions for their NORAD Tracks Santa website during Christmas holidays.\n\n\n== Components ==\n\n\n=== REST APIs ===\nVarious APIs cover the major functionalities across Azure Maps:\n\nData registry API\nGeolocation API\nRender API\nRoute API\nSearch API\nSpatial API\nTime zone API\nTraffic API\nWeather API\n\n\n=== SDKs ===\nAzure Maps SDKs uses MapLibre-style specifications and open source MapLibre GL-based libraries as a rendering engine. The Web SDK is used for developing web apps with maps and location-based data and functionality. It includes a map control module as well as modules with drawing tools. It also supports Azure Maps Creator and various spatial data formats.\nThe platform also includes a set of REST SDKs for developers integrating Azure Maps REST APIs into Python, C#, Java or JavaScript applications.\nAzure Maps also includes Android and iOS SDKs used for developing applications for Android and Apple devices.\n\n\n=== Azure Maps Creator ===\nAzure Maps Creator is a tool for generating custom maps for locations like large office complexes, construction sites, or university campuses. These maps can then be integrated into applications and used with other Azure Maps functions for purposes such as wayfinding and maintenance and security in building automation contexts.\n\n\n=== Azure Maps Visual for Power BI ===\nAzure Maps is integrated with Microsoft Power BI, a graphical tool for producing data visualizations. Since July 2020, Power BI can be used in conjunction with Azure Maps for developing map-based data visualizations. This functionality entered general availability in May 2023.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBing Maps\nGeographic information system software\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-maps/",

Incumbent Governor Vadim Shumkov is eligible to run to a second term in office.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThen-Deputy Governor of Tyumen Oblast Vadim Shumkov was appointed acting Governor of Kurgan Oblast in October 2018, replacing first-term Governor Aleksey Kokorin, who resigned at his own request. After his resignation Kokorin joined the board of directors of ARMZ Uranium Holding, a uranium mining division of Rosatom corporation.\nShumkov ran for a full term as an Independent and overwhelmingly won the September 2019 election with 80.86% of the vote, as his nearest challenger, Yakov Sidorov (CPRF), received just 9.70%. During the campaign analysts in May 2019 named Shumkov \"tough and uncompromising anti-crisis manager\" and \"the toughest acting governor running that cycle\".\n\n\n== Candidates ==\nIn Kurgan Oblast candidates for Governor can be nominated by registered political parties or by self-nomination. Candidate for Governor of Kurgan Oblast should be a Russian citizen and at least 30 years old. Candidates for Governor should not have a foreign citizenship or residence permit. Each candidate in order to be registered is required to collect at least 5% of signatures of members and heads of municipalities. In addition, self-nominated candidates should collect 0.5% of signatures of Kurgan Oblast residents. Also gubernatorial candidates present 3 candidacies to the Federation Council and election winner later appoints one of the presented candidates.\n\n\n=== Potential ===\nVadim Shumkov (Independent), incumbent Governor of Kurgan Oblast (2018–present)\nViktor Zyryanov (CPRF), Member of Kurgan Oblast Duma (2020–present)\n\n\n== See also ==\n2024 Russian regional elections\n\n\n== References ==",

However, in order to pursue it, he had to quit his job as a phone line salesman. He resigned and bet everything on his career in mixed martial arts. \n\n\n== Mixed martial arts career ==\n\n\n=== Early career ===\nHe debuted in professional MMA on September 11, 2015, at the age of 23, at the '300 SPARTA 8' event.

These wars took place during the Almohad period and were primarily fought over territorial control and influence in the Maghreb region of North Africa.\nAround 1230 the Almohad empire was beginning to decline, and the leaders appointed the Zayyanid chief Jabir ibn Yusuf as governor of Tlemcen who took control of the city for the Almohad empire. Yaghmurasen ibn Zyan was the next governor of Tlemcen who was appointed in 1235, after a short time the Almohad caliphate lost control over the city and Yaghmurasen declared independence for Tlemcen effectively making him the first ruler and founder. The war started when Yaghmurasen tried to consolidate power and gain control of the surrounding territories including territories owned by the Almohad caliphate.\nIn 1241, the Zayyanid territories survived an invasion by the Hafsid dynasty, in 1248 the successors of the Almohad leaders attempted to invade Tlemcen and their lands located in Western Algeria but failed. In 1248, Abu Yahya ibn Abd al-Haqq, who was the sultan of the Marinid dynasty, attacked Tlecemen. Abu al-Hasan as-Said al-Mutadid attacked Tlecemen and laid siege to the Oudja fortress where Yaghmurasen was, the Battle of Oujda which was one of the decisive victories of the Zayyanid dynasty which ended the Zayyanid-Almohad wars.\n\n\n== See also ==\nKingdom of Tlemcen\nHafsid dynasty\nAlmohad Caliphate\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Serigne Mbayé Diouf (born 1975) is a Senegalese and Spanish activist and politician. He migrated to Spain in 2006 due to reduced opportunities in fishing in Senegal. He lived as a hawker on the streets of Madrid and set up a trade union, Manteros, to advocate for those involved in the same trade. A member of Podemos, he served in the Assembly of Madrid from 2021 to 2023, as its first black member.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMbayé was born in Kayar, Senegal. After his baccalaureate, he became a fisherman, as was his family's tradition. He fished for ten years, until climate change and the rise of European trawlers reduced the economic viability of his work.\nIn 2006, Mbayé was one of 95 passengers on a small boat that crossed from Saint-Louis, Senegal to Tenerife in the Canary Islands. He was then transferred to mainland Spain, where he found accommodation with a friend. He worked as a hawker selling CDs on the streets of Madrid. After taking educational courses, he moved on to working in construction and agriculture in 2009, and once his immigration status was regularised the following year, he worked in administration.\nMbayé set up a trade union for hawkers in 2008, which was named Manteros in 2015, after the mats from which they sell their ware. He said that the organisation's aim is to move the vendors into employment, and to make the public aware of the bureaucratic difficulties that prevent some migrants from working legally.\nMbayé was approached by the left-wing party Podemos to stand in the 2021 Madrilenian regional election. He was elected, becoming the first black member of the Assembly of Madrid. He said \"There will always be attacks but from now on, there is a black person in the chamber. Whether people like me or not, they now know that I am part of society, and that there is diversity in Madrid and in the world\".\nDuring the election campaign, far-right party Vox threatened to deport Mbayé, despite his naturalisation as a citizen of Spain. This threat was criticised by Vox consultant Bertrand Ndongo, who was born in Cameroon.\nMbayé was the subject of the 2023 documentary Serigne vs the EU, produced by Al Jazeera as part of their Witness strand. The title refers to his trip to Brussels to argue in favour of fairer fishing and border policy between the European Union and Senegal. The film was nominated for an International Emmy Award for Best Documentary.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Artabba Fortress is a Hasmonean-Herodian fortress, discovered in 2015 by Dr. Dvir Raviv from Bar-Ilan University and Dr. Aharon Tavger from Ariel University. The site is located at the top of a hill at a height of 364 meters, is near the ravine of Wadi Artabba, also known as Nahal Natuf, southeast of the Palestinian village of Deir Abu Mash'al in the West Bank.\n\n\n== Fortress discovery ==\n\nIn 2015, as part of the Israeli South Samaria survey in the West Bank, the remains of a fortified site from the Second Temple period were uncovered on a hill in the west Beit El Mountains. The site, which was unknown until recently, [clarification needed] is located at the top of a cone-shaped hill, about ten kilometers northeast of Modi'in and about a kilometer southeast of the village of Deir Abu Mash'al. The hill is hidden from its distant surroundings and only those who approach it notice it; Perhaps because of this the site \"disappeared\" from the eyes of researchers who explored the area. The hill (364 meters above sea level) dominates the ravine of Nahal Natuf (Wadi Artabba), that has created steep slopes surround the hill.\nOn the lower part of the south-western slope, there is another ancient site called Khirbat Artabba and about 200 meters down stream, west of the hill, is the spring of Ein Artabba. The summit of the site is relatively flat, has an area of about 22 dunams and is mostly covered by currently cultivated land.\nDuring a tour of the site in June 2015, it became clear that residents of Deir Abu Mash'al had begun development and construction work on the site with the help of heavy mechanical tools, partly for the purpose of breaking through to access the top of the hill and erecting a structure.\nIn the course of these works, the remains of a square tower built in the Hellenistic-Hasmonean style were exposed and damaged, the corner was displaced during the work. Architectural items were also uncovered, the openings of five large cisterns, storage pits, as well as types of quarries (building foundations and stone quarries). The residents' earthworks were accompanied by systematic antiquities looting all over the site. These acts brought to the surface many fragments of pottery from the Hellenistic and early Roman periods. The fort that was discovered during earthworks was not known to researchers until its current discovery.\nAccording to the pottery found at the site, it dates to the period between the middle of the second century BC and its abandonment at the end of the first century BC. Estimates accepted by site researchers are that the fort functioned from the time of Hasmonean leaders Jonathan Apphus or Simon Thassi until the end of Herod's reign.\n\n\n== The Hasmonean era ==\nThe fort was part of the Hasmonean fortresses in southern Samaria guarding the kingdom.\nThe historical background for the establishment of the fort in the place can be learned from its geographic-historical data. The hill of the fortress dominates the large ravine of Nahal Natuf, which descends from Mount Beit El to the west towards the Shepelah. The wide ravine allowed a relatively convenient passage between the Modi'in area and the center of Mount Beth El and it can be assumed that the Hasmoneans made a lot of use of it during the years of the Maccabean Revolt. In addition to this, it is worth noting a small, isolated, sloped valley with springs, located at the central part of the stream, about 2 km east of Artabba. The unique characteristics of this valley allowed the Hasmonean rebels to use it as a refreshing and organizing base.\nFrom a geographical-historical point of view, the fort is located in the northern part of the region of Ramataim, one of the three regions that were transferred from Samaria to Judea as part of the agreement concluded between Jonathan Apphus and Demetrius II in 145 BCE. The three toparchies, which extend along the northern edge of the Yehud Medinata in its borders from the days of the return to Zion, and it is acceptable to assume that they were inhabited mainly by a Jewish or pro-Jewish population even before they were annexed to Judaea. This citadel can be seen as part of a fortifications system designed to establish control over this area while forming a fortified line controlling the northern area of the Hasmoneans in the second half of the 2nd century BCE.\n\n\n== The findings on the site ==\nAccording to Dr. Raviv's assessment, \"Settlement at the site began as an agricultural one in the early Second Temple period on the western slope of the hill, at a site called \"Khirbat Artabba\", while in the days of Jonathan or Shimon the Hasmoneans, a royal fortress was erected at the top of the hill and later buildings were built on the southern slope of the hill including cisterns and warehouses\".\n\n\n== The fortifications ==\n\nThe built fortifications were added to the natural fortification of the site. The remains of a perimeter wall were exposed on the northern, eastern and southern sides of the site hill. The most impressive remains were found in the southwest corner of the hill during the preparation of an access road to its top. These remains include two wall sections perpendicular to each other, which form a corner of the perimeter wall or of a square tower. These walls have been preserved to a height of 5 courses and were built of large hewn stones with chiseled edges and a coarse ledge, which were laid using the head and patina method, except for the lower course, where the stones were placed using the head and stringer method.\nThis construction method is typical of the Hellenistic period in the Land of Israel and is known from the fortifications of the first wall from the Hasmonean era in Jerusalem and from other sites, such as the round towers in Samaria, the fortifications of Alexandrium and Aroma in Samaria. A similar construction style is also found in other sections of the perimeter wall and makes it possible to date the remains of the fortifications in place to the Hasmonean period. The location of the walls sections standing at point overlooking the southern slope of the hill, is probably where the access road to the site was installed. This allows us to suggest that before us are the remains of a tower that guarded the entrance gate to the fort.\n\n\n== Purification Mikvehs ==\n\nIn the northern part of the site, two mikvehs were recorded. One mikveh was incorporated in a later period into a cistern. This mikveh includes a stepped entrance and an opening approximately 1.5 meters high and 1 meter wide. The opening leads to a square baptismal chamber measuring 3.5x3.5 meters and five carved steps descend to its bottom. The sides and steps of the mikveh are coated with a thick layer of white plaster and on top of that a layer of gray plaster like the plaster seen in the water pits (below). The integration of the mikveh space into the cistern was done with the sealing of its original entrance. The ancient plaster layer in the mikveh was probably installed during the Hasmonean period.\nThe second mikveh includes a carved entrance, a 1.5-meter-high arched opening leading to a square baptismal chamber that measures 3.2x3.3 meters, and on its sides traces of light gray plaster are visible. Therefore, it seems to have been carved during the Herodian period. The bottom of the mikveh is covered in silt, but it can be seen at least on one step. In the period after finding the mikvehs, acts of robbery were carried out in them damaging the stairs and the floor.\n\n\n== The cisterns ==\n\nThe most impressive remains on the site are five large rock-cut water cisterns. Two cisterns are located to the south of the hill and three in the northern part, all within the fortified area. The soft chalk rock made it possible to carve the cisterns relatively easily, but also required consideration of the possibility of disintegration and collapse. The fear of the ceiling collapsing led to digging long, narrow cisterns and even building a retaining wall in one of them.\nThe shape of the cisterns are usually square: Cistern No. 1 is rectangular, Cistern 2&4 are trapezoidal, Cistern No. 3 is cross-shaped, and Cistern 5 is square. The dimensions of the cistern on average: 16 meters long, 7 meters wide, 6 meters high and a volume of about 600 cubic meters. Cistern 4 is the largest of the Cisterns: it is 22 meters long, 10 meters wide, 11 meters high and could store more than 1,200 MK. The data is only partial, as today the pits are filled with a lot of silt covering their bottoms. In all the cisterns there is at least one opening in the ceiling and in four of them there are also other openings in one of the sides. The openings in the roof of the cisterns are relatively small and were used for pumping and absorbing water.\nIn contrast, the side openings are generally wide and seem to have been used for the entrance of the workers. When the quarrying ended, the side openings were closed with smooth stone walls. The sides of the cisterns and their bottoms are covered with two layers of plaster: a thick layer of white plaster typical of the Hellenistic period and above it a layer of gray plaster typical of the early Roman period. Horizontal lines remain on top of the plaster, some of them very high, which indicate the levels of water storage and the large amount that was actually stored in the cisterns. The area of the dome and the location of the site in a relatively rainy area made it possible to easily collect the runoff water and fill the cisterns. The location of the water cisterns in the center of the fortress hill and not at the edge allowed easy and safe access to them during a siege.\nThe water cisterns at Artabba are similar in shape and size to the water reservoirs, usually based on the collection of surface runoff water, found in fortresses and citadels within the Hasmonean state, including in the fortresses of the Judean desert such as Alexandrium, Kyprus and Hyrcania, which clearly date to the Hasmonean period. The total volume of the cisterns in Artabba is estimated at more than 3,400 cubic meters, a considerable amount of water compared to the other forts, which was collected through canals and moats and was intended to allow standing a prolonged siege and supply water to the site's inhabitants, and perhaps even to the area residents in times of need.\nThe common typology of the waterworks in the royal citadels, the similar shape of some of the cisterns as well as the white plaster, make it possible to date the digging of the cisterns on the site to the Hasmonean period and their continued use to the Herod days. However, due to the unusual shape of Pit No. 3 and its impact on an ancient facility (Mikveh described above), it may have been dug only during Herod's time.\n\n\n== Warehouses ==\nOn the northern slope of the site hill, a large cave was found that was apparently used for storage and contains many pottery fragments from the Hellenistic period. At the bottom of the southern and eastern slopes of the hill are scattered the remains of buildings built mostly of field stones and polished stones. Besides them, cisterns, a lime kiln, quarries, burial caves and storage caves were located.\nWorthy of mentioning is a large cave roofed with carved arches, in which many fragments of pottery were found, most of them jugs, which are common in assemblages dating from the period between the revolts[clarification needed] and the days of the Bar Kokhba revolt. According to the shape of the cave it seems that it was carved in the Herodian period and was used as a royal storehouse.\n\n\n== The site's history in light of the findings ==\nThe geographical and archaeological data of the Artabba fortress show that it was one of the fortresses of Judah during the Second Temple period. Its location at the top of a lofty hill, the remains of the fortifications and the impressive water supply system are the main characteristics of the Judean Desert fortresses and of the fortresses that were built in the settled parts of the Hasmonean-Rhodian kingdom. Dozens of pottery fragments found at the site make it possible to date the construction of the fort to the middle of the 2nd century BC and its existence until the end of the 1st century BC, that is, from the days of Jonathan Apphus or Simon Thassi to the end of Herod's time. This is while the settlement that was located at the foot of the fortress hill, to the south and southwest of it (Khirbat Artabba), continued to exist until the days of the Bar Kokhba revolt.\n\n\n== Districts transferred of from Samaria to Judea ==\nFrom a geographical-historical point of view, the Artabba fortress is located in the northern part of the Ramataim district, one of the three districts that were transferred from Samaria to Judea as part of the agreement between Jonathan Apphus (161-142 BC) and Demetrius II in 145 BC (Maccabim 11:34). The three districts extend on the northern edge of the Judean Basin at its borders during the days of return to Zion, and many researchers saw their annexation as a ratification of an existing situation, in which Jews lived in this area already at the beginning of the Hasmonean period. This agreement led to the acceleration and development of the Jewish settlement in southern Samaria, and from now on the northern border of the Hasmonean kingdom passed through the northern border of the three districts. The location of the Artabba fortress near this border allows it to be seen as a northern border fortress of Judah at the beginning of the Hasmonean state. In light of these data, it can be assumed that the Artabba fortress was built by Simon Thassi.\nThe geographical data of the Artabba fortress, and especially its location near the northern border of Judah during the Second Temple period and its proximity to district capitals (Ramataim and Timanah), allowed it to fulfill both security and administrative functions. At the end of the first century BC, the fort passed into the hands of Herod, like the other forts of the Hasmonean kingdom. The remains from this period show the continued use of the cisterns and the construction of a monumental building in the place from which a stone survived that was part of a cornice that decorated the front of a magnificent building. The Herodian royal building in Artabba is part to the other royal estates from the period of House of Herod recorded in the southwestern region of Samaria. It seems that the fort was abandoned at the end of Herod's time and no longer stands.\n\n\n== Artabba ruins ==\nThe ruins lie at the foot of the fort, on the southwestern slope of the hill. It was first described in the PEF Survey of Palestine and then in the Israel Antiquities Authority archive division and in the surveys of Israel Finkelstein, Zvika Tzuk and Dr. Raviv Dvir.\nThe size of the ruin is about 20 dunams and parts of its stones can be seen in secondary use on nearby terraces. Water cisterns and burial caves and remains of a weaving house were found on the site and in its vicinity. Over 90% of the ceramics collected at the site have been dated to the Hellenistic-Roman periods.\n\n\n== Photo Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

He began in the SDE Hockey system in his hometown of Enebyberg, a suburb of Stockholm. In 2018, he switched to the Örebro HK junior system and progressed up through the ranks. He made his first appearance at the top junior level during the 2019–20 season and played there almost exclusively during the following two seasons. In 2022, he played a single game for Örebro, getting his first taste of professional hockey. For his final season of junior eligibility, Stjernberg moved to North America and played for the Des Moines Buccaneers. At the beginning of the season he committed to attending Bowling Green State University the following fall.\nWhen Stjernberg debuted at the college level, he joined a program in turmoil. Accusations of hazing directed towards one of the other players cast a pall over the season but that did prevent Stjernberg from playing well. He led the team in scoring from the blueline and was one of the very few Falcons to finish the season with a positive +/-.\n\n\n== Career statistics ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBiographical information and career statistics from Eliteprospects.com, or The Internet Hockey Database",

The album is considered to be part of Bartz's comeback, after his absence from recording for most of the 1980s.\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe album was recorded in November 1990, at Birdland, in New York City. Bartz was backed by the Candid All Stars: bassist Ray Drummond, pianist Kenny Barron, and drummer Ben Riley. He composed \"Racism (Blues in Double Bb Minor)\" and \"Flight Path\". \"Impressions\" is a version of the John Coltrane composition. Two songs were written by Tadd Dameron: \"On a Misty Night\" and \"Tadd's Delight\".\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nThe Chicago Tribune called the set \"energetic and immediate, very much the sinew of jazz.\" The Washington Post wrote that \"Bartz's brash, headlong improvisations, accruing more momentum with every chorus and often sustained brilliantly by Barron, are tempered by the emotional vulnerability the saxophonist displays so readily on the ballads.\" The News & Observer advised: \"Don't expect tenderness ... unless it's the tenderness following a burn,\" and noted Bartz's similarity to Coltrane's \"whiplashing 'sheets of sound' days.\" Musician labeled Bartz \"a burning improviser who can bring a club to a frenzy.\" In 1993, Newsday wrote that Riley and Barron \"played to great effect on the underrated\" There Goes the Neighborhood!\nAllMusic praised Bartz's \"rippling solos and dominant presence.\" The Encyclopedia of Popular Music called the album \"a vivid record of one of modern jazz’s most intense and exciting living saxophonists, playing at his peak.\" The Penguin Guide to Jazz on CD considered it \"his finest hour.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Roberto Cosulich (30 July 1946 – 1980) was an Italian chess player, FIDE Master (FM) (posthumously awarded in 2001), six time Italian Chess Championship silver medalist (1969, 1971, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976).\n\n\n== Chess career ==\nRoberto Cosulich, born to a family of Istrian origin, grew up in South America where his father, a ship commander, was on business. Here he learned the game of chess and had as a teacher the International Grandmaster Hermann Pilnik. Returning to Italy in 1965 he quickly became one of the strongest Italian players, obtaining the title of National Master in 1966.\nGifted with great talent, he participated in tournaments mainly to earn some money. The reason for his numerous second places in Italian Chess Championships from 1969 to 1976 was precisely in his being satisfied with a safe placing - and prize money - rather than taking a risk for first place and then finding himself without the prize money.\nRoberto Cosulich played for Italy in the Chess Olympiads:\n\nIn 1970, at first reserve board in the 19th Chess Olympiad in Siegen (+7, =6, -1),\nIn 1974, at fourth board in the 21st Chess Olympiad in Nice (+9, =4, -4).\nIn 1967 he won the 8th Italian Team Chess Championship with the Trieste chess club Società Scacchistica Triestina.\n\n\n== Last years and disappearance ==\nFrom the 1960s Cosulich abandoned his family and chess became his only means of support. Always in search of himself and strongly tempted by oriental philosophies, Cosulich lived day by day, in the hippie style of those years.\nIn 1977 Cosulich was investigated during the investigations into the Red Brigades. He was cleared quite quickly and, as soon as he got his passport back, he decided to leave for India. He returned after a year to leave for South America where he had grown up. There has been no news of him since. In 1980 the French chess magazine Europe Échecs reported to the director of L'Italia Scacchistica Giovanni Ferrantes about the discovery of the passport of a chess master named Cosulich in Peru, who would have been the victim of a natural disaster. The absolute lack of news after then suggests, despite the failure to find his body, that Cosulich died in that event. \nIn 2001, Roberto Cosulich was posthumously awarded the FIDE Master (FM) title.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRoberto Cosulich player profile and games at Chessgames.com\nRoberto Cosulich chess games at 365Chess.com\nL'AVVENTURA DI ROBERTO COSULICH",

Later the species name suffix was subsequently altered (inflected to the feminine for gender agreement with the genus) in Roewer 1923, but using a variant (mis)spelling of the genus as Paecilaemula signata, which was repeated by several authors. The current formation as Poecilaemula signata was given in the extensive catalog of Laniatores by Kury 2003. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Poecilaemula signata at Wikimedia Commons\n Data related to Poecilaemula signata at Wikispecies",

The company specialized in the production, distribution, and provision of household, health care, personal care, and associated products. In the 1920s, with more than 800 outlets, its chain of Schous Sæbehus shops was the largest of its kind in the country.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nJens Christian Schou (1836–1900) was born in Thisted as the son of a carpenter. He attended the local latin school. He later apprenticed with merchant Galster's widow in Nørresundby. In 1859, Galster closed the company. The remains of it was subsequently acquired by Schou and his somewhat older collogue Sofus Holm who had also worked for Galster. The new company operated under the name Holm & Schou. Sophus Holm left the company in 1865. Schou's property was just a few months later destroyed in the Greart Fire of Nørresundby. He received 60,000 Danish rigsdaler from the insurance company. This enabled him to cpmstruct a large new building complex at the corner of the town's central market square and the street Vestergade.He supplemented the income from his grocery business with the manufacturing of confectionary and chemical products.\n\nIn 1888, the company moved to Copenhagen. It was initially located on Godthåbsvej. In 1892, it relocated to new premises on Sankt Peders Stræde.\nAfter the death of Jens Christian Schou in 1900, the business was continued by his widow, Caja Severine Schou, (née Bøggild, 1928-). In 1904 she made their two sons Lauritz Kjellerup Bøggild Schou, (1866–1938) and Holger Schou (1871–1948) as partners. Not long thereafter shecompletely withdrew from the operations. Om 10+4, C. Schous Fabriker inaugurated a large new factory complex at H. C. Jensens Vej 4 in Copenhagen's North-West district.\nIn caround  1900, the company began to set up Schous Sæbehus shops in towns across the country.\nThe company had 4,000 employees in 1950. It was headquartered at Kronprinsessegade 28. Board members were Oluf Schou (1885-), C. L. Da.vid (1878-), Marius Schou (1902-) and Holger H. Schou (1903-). The cief executing officers were en Oluf Schou, Marius Schou and Holger H. Schou.\nNew factories were later established at Nymølle and Ravnholm in Lyngby. The company went bankrupt in 1974.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nRge company's former factory at Nymøllevej 50 in Lyngby was later taken over by Haldor Topsøe.\nA Schous Sæbehus shop from Viborg has been reconstructed in Den Gamle By in Aarhus.\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nGuldmann Andersen, Berit: C.

        "content": "Hazon Leumi is an Israeli organization operating in Israel and around the world by implementing training and enrichment activities and programs on the topics of Zionism, combating anti-Semitism, Jewish heritage, and conservative approaches in the fields of economics, law, and society.\nThe core activities of the organization are annual programs for groups of young people and students who meet weekly for lectures, workshops and tours from a national-conservative-liberal perspective.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Establishment of the Organization ===\nIn 2013, a group of activists led by Ariel Kallner founded the organization together, setting a goal of shaping the leadership of the next generation with a Jewish-Zionist-national spirit. After being elected to the 21st Knesset, Kallner resigned from the organization and was replaced by Dor Harlap as the chairman of the organization.\n\n\n=== Activities of the Organization ===\nThe organization's activities focus on deepening Zionist awareness through Zionist, conservative values by means of discussions, lectures, workshops and tours, with the aim of encouraging students to later engage in public and social action.\nEvery year, the organization conducts tours for student groups and open public tours in south Tel Aviv (led by Sheffi Paz), Samaria, Hebron Hills and Jerusalem. Weekly lectures are held in the 'Public Leadership Program' where regular lecturers include Dr. Mordechai Kedar, Retired Major General Uzi Dayan, Dr. Gadi Taub, Prof. Gustavo Perednik, Yoram Ettinger, Eran Bartal and Yehuda Yifrach. The organization organizes an annual ceremony commemorating the Altalena affair.\nDuring Israel-Hamas war, the organization was involved in various public advocacy campaigns in support of Israel, in Israel and abroad.\nIn 2017, Knesset member Stav Shaffir claimed that the organization \"is an organization that persecutes academics\" and that \"it is an arm of the Independence Heritage Fund.\" Following this, the then-chairman of the organization, Ariel Kallner, appealed to the chairman of the Ethics Committee, requesting that he instruct MK Stav Shaffir to apologize for the \"false claims.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nHazon Leumi on Facebook\nHazon Leumi's channel on YouTube",

        "content": "Dorothea, Lady Banks (née Hugessen, 1758 – 1828) was an English collector of ceramics.\nShe was born Dorothea Hugessen on 8 November 1758, one of two daughters of William Western Hugessen of Proveden, Kent, and his wife Thomazine, née Honywood. She was a 'well-acred heiress' at the time of her marriage to scientist Sir Joseph Banks on 23 March 1779, and she was described by Banks' colleague Daniel Solander as 'rather handsome, very agreable, chatty & laughs a good deal.'\nHer collection of ceramics, which she displayed in the dairy of her home at Spring Grove, is recorded in her Dairy Book. Like the ephemera collection of her sister-in-law Sarah Sophia Banks, it is informative about women collectors in the Georgian period.\n\n\n== Collection ==\nDorothea converted the dairy on their property at Spring Grove into an exhibition-house for her collection of ceramics. Banks said that she was 'a little old-china mad, but she wishes to mix as much reason with her madness as possible.' She sought authentically Eastern pieces rather than those produced for the western market, and designed a classification system for them. In 1804 King George III and his family visited her collection, and she served him produce from the dairy on some of her china.\nThe collection was sold at Christie’s in 1893 after the death of her great-nephew, who had inherited it, and found to contain Minton, Crown Derby, Sèvres, and Dresden ware as well as oriental pieces.\nDorothea inherited the ephemera collection of her sister-in-law Sarah Sophia Banks, who lived with them, and donated it to the British Museum in her name.\n\n\n== Lady Banks rose ==\n\nThe Lady Banks rose, brought to Kew Gardens from China by William Kerr and cultivated by her husband, was named after her.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Andrzej Szwan (born August 16, 1938, in Warsaw) is a Polish entertainer and photo model, performing as a drag queen under pseudonym Lulla la Polaca.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHe was born in Warsaw, into a family of Jewish origin. After the outbreak of World War II, he was sent to the Warsaw Ghetto, from which he was evacuated through the wall. He was originally taken in by the Zając family, and eventually found himself in the care of his father's sister, Janina. Her husband, Apolinary, was a member of the Home Army and an activist of the anti-fascist underground. Young Szwan began to treat his adoptive parents as biological. After the end of the war, he grew up in the district of Praga. In 1956, he passed his high school final exams and then applied to study at the Aleksander Zelwerowicz's State Higher Theater School. However, due to his mother's illness, he was forced to give up further education and started working at the Capital Transport Company for Internal Trade. Later, he started law studies at the University of Warsaw. As a government official, he worked on contracts, among others, in Libya and Iraq, thanks to which he managed to escape the governmental initiative of infiltration of the queer community of Poland and persecution of its members, known as Operation Hyacinth.\n\n\n== Drag performances and activism ==\nIn 2010, thanks to Kim Lee, he made his debut on stage as a drag queen, and became known as the oldest active Polish drag queen. He performs in clubs and festivals related to the queer community. Szwan's photos appeared, among others, in Vogue magazine. He also took part in the Levi's Pride 2021 campaign and the 2024 promotional action of the Polin museum, asking Varsovians to pin on yellow paper daffodils as a token of remembrance of Warsaw Ghetto uprising. In 2021, he appeared in Miuosh's music video for the song \"Klucze\". He is openly gay  and an activist for the rights of non-heteronormative people.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Ravensburg–Weingarten–Baienfurt tram line – occasionally also referred to as the Ravensburg–Weingarten–Baienfurt narrow-gauge railway - connected the three mentioned towns until 1959 as a meter-gauge interurban tramway. It was opened in 1888 by the private Lokalbahn Aktien-Gesellschaft (LAG) and initially operated as a steam-powered branch line from Ravensburg to Weingarten. In 1910, it was electrified and extended to Baienfurt in 1911.\nIn 1938, the railway, also known colloquially as \"Zügle,\" \"Mühle,\" \"Bähnle,\" or \"Bodensee-Blitz,\" was nationalized and henceforth officially classified as a tramway according to the Regulation on the Construction and Operation of Tramways (BOStrab) that came into force in the same year. After 1938, the route was the only tramway operation owned by the Deutsche Reichsbahn, and after World War II, it became the only tramway operation owned by the Deutsche Bundesbahn.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1849: Altdorf is bypassed ===\nAs early as November 8, 1847, the Upper Swabian district town and present-day district capital of Ravensburg was connected to the South Railway from Friedrichshafen. On 26 May 1849, this line was extended to Biberach an der Riß, and by 29 June 1850, Ulm was reached. From there, it connected with the existing Filstal Railway from Stuttgart. Contrary to the original expectations Altdorf – later known as Weingarten – did not receive a connection to this important mainline of the Royal Württemberg State Railways during the northern extension.\nThe kingdom, which did not possess coal deposits, aimed to lead its locomotives to Lake Constance via the shortest route possible; in the short term, there was even a threat to bypass Biberach. On the other hand, the Mayor of Altdorf, Adolf Prielmayer, vehemently opposed a direct connection. Consequently, the South Railway passed about two and a half kilometers west of the town. The old market towns of Waldsee, Tettnang, Baindt and Baienfurt, were also not connected at that time.\nCompounding the issue, no train station was established at the location closest to Altdorf. The current nearby stop, Weingarten/Berg, was only opened in 1998 by the Bodensee-Oberschwaben-Bahn. This meant that the nearest railway stations to Altdorf on the South Railway - Ravensburg and Niederbiegen - were about four and three kilometers away respectively. Although Altdorf had only about half the population of neighboring Ravensburg in 1849, it was well known regionally as a place of pilgrimage due to the Benedictine Abbey of Weingarten and the Basilica of St. Martin.\n\n\n=== 1865–1888: Weingarten in the shadow of transportation ===\n\nIn 1865, Altdorf adopted the name of the Benedictine abbey and was renamed Weingarten. At the same time, the town was granted city rights. Concurrently, during this period of industrialization, Weingarten also developed into an important industrial location. In particular, the Weingarten Machine Factory AG was founded in 1865 (known today as Schuler AG), as well as the spinning mill established the following year, played a significant role. The rapid development led to a sharp increase in population; by 1 December 1880, there were 5,232 people living in the city. Consequently, the lack of a railway connection became increasingly disadvantageous, leaving the city – unlike Ravensburg – in the shadow of transportation. Additionally, there was already a local transportation demand between Altdorf and Ravensburg at that time. Furthermore, from 1868, Weingarten had an 800-man garrison, but unlike Ravensburg, it had only a few industrial jobs.\nTo improve the inadequate situation, Weingarten subsequently sought to obtain a connection to the Württemberg State Railway through the construction of a branch line, albeit belatedly. The driving force behind this was the Weingarten Business Association, led by its energetic secretary, the Protestant teacher Christoph Klein. In 1879, he managed to enlist the support of the Zurich railway engineer Theodor Lutz for the project. Remarkably, the route via the Frauentorplatz in Ravensburg was already planned at this stage. However, a critical examination by the Weingarten City Council revealed that Klein had calculated far too tight radii for his standard-gauge railway laid in the street, and economically, he had assumed a much too high volume of traffic and thus a high return. Consequently, the plans were shelved.\nAfter the Kingdom of Württemberg lost interest in the railway, efforts were made to alternatively promote the construction of a private railway. Privately operated lines were still a relatively new phenomenon at the time; in Württemberg, there were only three non-state railways at that time; The railway to Weingarten was intended to become the fourth private railway in Württemberg.\n\n\n=== Redesign of narrow-gauge steam tramway ===\nIn the spring of 1886, the Augsburg engineers Theodor Lechner and Viktor Krüzner, who were active in the railway sector at the time, identified a corresponding transportation demand between the two emerging cities of Ravensburg and Weingarten, which could be addressed by the construction of a steam tramway. In October 1886, the company therefore submitted an application for a project planning concession for the construction of the railway to the government of the Kingdom of Württemberg.\nIn 1887, the two engineers finally presented a concept for a meter-gauge narrow-gauge railway to the municipal administrations of Ravensburg and Weingarten. It was planned to run from Ravensburg's railway station square via Schussenstraße to Frauentorplatz, then directly along the Ulm-Friedrichshafen state road to the Scherzach bridge in Weingarten. There, Lechner and Krüzner did not want to follow the sharp bend around the former forest, now the youth hostel, and planned the track to run directly from the Stadtösch stop (later Lamm) through the orchard of the Sonnenwirt to the terminus at the intersection of Waldseer Straße/Schloßstraße, now Abt-Hyller-Straße or Charlottenplatz. In contrast to the failed standard-gauge plans of a few years earlier, this railway could easily adapt to the given settlement axes.  The routing in the public road space also allowed for lower construction and operating costs compared to a mostly independently routed classic railway.\nThe concept by Lechner and Krüzner convinced the civic bodies of the two participating cities both in terms of technology and profitability, albeit more so in Weingarten than in Ravensburg, where there was generally less openness towards the railway. The state government in Stuttgart also agreed after recognizing that the new railway posed no serious threat to the utilization of its line between Ravensburg and Aulendorf. This was not a given, as in the kingdom, the state held a monopoly on railways. If it allowed a private railway, it was only under the condition of being able to repurchase the line after a certain number of years of operation, at the accumulated asset value.\nThe conditions around Ravensburg and Weingarten were so acceptable that Lechner and Krüzner were able to enlist the influential Munich railway industrialist Georg Krauß for the project. He was the owner of the locomotive factory Krauss & Comp., specializing in local railway locomotives, and saw an opportunity to increase his sales in the planned route. Thus, Lechner, Krüzner, and Krauß founded the private Lokalbahn Aktien-Gesellschaft (LAG) on 9 February 1887. This company received the construction permit for the new railway and was also the builder. Construction began in August 1887, according to another source on 3 September. The operating concession was granted by the state of Württemberg on 15 November 1887. The licensing of private railways was still subject to the respective state law at that time.\n\n\n=== Opening ===\nThe new railway to Weingarten was supposed to be ceremonially inaugurated on 22 December 1887, but the track was not yet completed. When it was finally completed by the next scheduled date, 29 December 1887, it could not be inspected by the responsible official from Stuttgart due to a snowstorm that buried it centimeters deep. Thus, passenger traffic could only commence on 6 January 1888, without an opening ceremony. Operations ran from 6:50 to 22:10, with a lunch break for the staff, resulting in a total of eleven services. The journey over the entire route took 20 minutes and cost 20 pfennigs for adults and 10 pfennigs for children under ten years old in the third class with wooden seats. Children under three years old could ride for free if they did not occupy their own seat. Tickets were valid for one day; double the price was required for a return journey. The second class, equipped with padded seats, was twice as expensive and mainly reserved for officers of the Weingarten garrison and their families. Tickets were only available at the ticket office in Weingarten, although some merchants and inns in both Ravensburg and Weingarten also served as additional sales points.\nPublic freight transport commenced over half a year after the start of passenger operations, on 15 August 1888. The LAG primarily transported goods in the existing half-luggage vans, with the few freight cars only rarely used. The track was laid with Vignoles rails weighing 24.77 kilograms per meter. Larger structures were not required, explaining the short construction time of the line. The management and depot of the railway were located in Weingarten.\nThe 4.18-kilometer connection was the first route of the newly founded LAG; the existing Feldabahn only joined the LAG in 1891. The concession to the Bavarian LAG was remarkable because it concentrated almost exclusively on activities in Bavaria. However, a few years after the opening of the steam tramway, the LAG expanded its activities in the Upper Swabia region by opening the Meckenbeuren–Tettnang railway line, located about ten kilometers south of Ravensburg, in 1895.\nFrom a technical perspective, the former steam tramway to Weingarten largely corresponded to the Chiemsee Railway, which is still steam-operated today, although it runs continuously on its own track. The Chiemsee Railway was opened on 9 July 1887, just a few months before the Weingarten route. It still uses a locomotive identical to those used in Oberschwaben at that time.\nThe new route, especially in the third class, was soon well patronized after its opening, causing the recently introduced horse omnibus, which offered a five-pfennig discount on the return journey, to be discontinued shortly thereafter. The Weingarten city administration sought to introduce an additional service for students returning from Ravensburg shortly after the start of operations. However, this was rejected by the LAG, citing the necessary rest time for the locomotive driver, stoker, and conductor. Initially, the staff worked the entire day without shifts, using the same locomotive, while the other was kept on standby only for emergencies.\n\n\n=== Route Description ===\nThe trains to Weingarten – and later to Baienfurt – departed from Ravensburg's railway station square, with the LAG station officially named Ravensburg State Station to distinguish it from the existing Ravensburg railway station. Boarding took place from the sidewalk opposite the state railway station building, with the former stop located directly in front of the main post office. The steam tram initially ran parallel to the South Railway in a northerly direction for about 100 meters, before making a sharp 90-degree turn eastward at the current bus station. Via Schussenstraße, it reached Ravensburg Frauentor at kilometer 0.83, located at the \"Green Tower\" junction. Due to its proximity to Ravensburg's old town, it was the second busiest stop on the railway after the starting station. After passing another 90-degree curve on Frauentorplatz, the route turned north again, following Gartenstraße towards Weingarten.\nThe rails in Gartenstraße were positioned on the right side of the road when heading out of the city. In the urban area of Ravensburg, they were initially laid within the roadway, while in the rural area, they were placed on a separate track to the right of the road. Gartenstraße was formerly the main traffic artery of the region, part of the former Württemberg State Road 49. This was particularly associated with a significant increase in individual traffic in later years. Along the course of Gartenstraße, another stop within the Ravensburg city area followed, called Ravensburg Holy Cross. The name originates from the former inn Holy Cross, which, in turn, was named after the Holy Cross leprosarium demolished in 1826. The stop was especially significant for the transportation connection to the adjacent St. Elizabeth Hospital.\nAt kilometer 2.46 – at the height of today's Ravensburg district of Burach (then spelled as Burrach), the railway crossed the border to the neighboring city of Weingarten and continued along the state road called Ravensburger Straße from here. The track ran through largely undeveloped areas before and after the territorial boundary at that time; in 1908, there was still a gap of about two kilometers between the two cities. Furthermore, the connecting road was not yet paved at that time; it was only paved between Ravensburg and Weingarten from 1916 to 1926.\nAbout half a kilometer after the territorial boundary, the railway reached the 14 Nothelfer stop, the first of three stations on Weingarten territory. It was named after the Hospital of the 14 Holy Helpers, in front of which the stop was located. Unlike other stops of the steam tramway, this stop did not have a place name attached to it, as the hospital it was named after – formerly a leprosarium – was still located slightly outside the built-up area of Weingarten.\nFollowing that, the trains reached the southern outskirts of Weingarten after about 500 meters, where the Weingarten Scherzachbrücke stop was located. Shortly thereafter, the track crossed the Scherzach river together with the road. After the bridge, the railway turned left, crossed Ravensburger Straße, and continued through then-undeveloped areas in a northerly direction. The alignment in this area corresponded to today's Waldseer Straße, which was rerouted in later years following the railway line. At the junction with the street now called Promenade, the railway rejoined the state road towards Ulm, following it on the left side. Subsequently, the track passed the railway depot and soon reached the terminus Weingarten Stadt. It was located slightly south of the former Charlottenstraße, now Abt-Hyller-Straße.\nThe track was single-track throughout, with train crossings possible at the two passing loops Ravensburg Holy Cross, which was only established later. This sufficed as the steam tramway operated with only two train tracks.\n\n\n=== Railway or tramway ===\nLegally, at the opening of the discussed route in the Kingdom of Württemberg – unlike in neighboring Bavaria, Prussia, or Saxony – there was no differentiation between a tramway and a railway. Thus, from a legal perspective, the route discussed here was initially considered a railway – simply because the existing Württemberg laws did not explicitly recognize tramways at that time. Nevertheless, the term tramway was also known in Württemberg. And regardless of the legal situation described, it was used not only colloquially but also officially. However, the LAG itself did not commit to a specific term; instead, it sometimes referred to its Ravensburg branch as a local railway and sometimes as a tramway. For example, the first tariff regulations dated 1 December 1887, were still labeled as Local Railway Ravensburg–Weingarten, while the timetable dated 1 December 1920, already stated Tramway Ravensburg–Weingarten–Baienfurt.\nEven in later years, this legal gray area led to definition problems. For example, Wolfgang Hendlmeier writes that the route was mostly listed in railway statistics, except for the years 1933 to 1938. In his opinion, the distinction was often made arbitrarily.\n\n\n=== Weingarten continues to grow ===\nIn the long run, the narrow-gauge branch line could no longer satisfy the increasing demand for transportation, especially as the population of Weingarten continued to grow rapidly, a trend that was further accelerated by the significantly improved transportation connections since 1888. On 1 December 1900, there were 6,678 people living in the area, while on 1 December 1910, the population had already increased to 8,077 inhabitants. Correspondingly, the workforce of the engineering factory also increased, from just under 50 in the opening year of the railway to 710 in 1913. Of these, 78 commuted daily from Ravensburg, with the railway as a technical innovation enabling the separation of residence and workplace.\nBesides the increased demand in passenger traffic, the freight traffic by narrow-gauge railway, albeit quite sparse at the time, proved to be problematic. On the one hand, goods had to be laboriously transferred from narrow gauge to standard gauge at Ravensburg State Railway Station, and on the other hand, the goods from Weingarten had to be transported through the city area of Ravensburg beforehand. Above all, however, the desired expansion of rail freight transport was not possible with the existing infrastructure.\n\n\n=== Baienfurt develops into an industrial town ===\nFurthermore, in those years, the northern neighboring town of Baienfurt also evolved into an industrial location. When the South Railway was extended northward from Ravensburg in 1849, Baienfurt had only 800 inhabitants. Accordingly, the town was as little considered during the routing at that time as Altdorf. However, in later years, industrialization also led to significant growth in Baienfurt. At the center of this development was the paper mill in Baienfurt, built between 1870 and 1873, which remained the largest employer in the area until its closure in 2009.\nBy the turn of the century, Baienfurt found itself in a situation similar to that of Weingarten until 1888. The nearest station on the South Railway – the Niederbiegen station – was two and a half kilometers from the town center, and it was also about two and a half kilometers to the terminus of the steam tramway in Weingarten. Thus, there was also an urgent need for improved transportation in Baienfurt, especially because the horse-drawn carts of the paper mill could not keep up with the supply of wood or the removal of finished paper via Niederbiegen.\n\n\n=== Ravensburg expands to the north ===\nAround the turn of the century, Ravensburg also continued to grow steadily, with the population increasing from 10,550 in 1880 to 15,594 in 1910. However, because there was limited housing available in the city center, this led to an expansion of the built-up area, including to the north. There, along the road towards Weingarten, the Nordstadt district was established, and the existing hamlet of Burrach was also developed into a district. Consequently, the branch line to Weingarten increasingly gained importance for intra-urban transportation in Ravensburg. To meet the changing needs, however, new stops had to be established – so far, the railway only served the Ravensburg Heilig Kreuz stop in the section north of the city center. However, the steam tramway would have been only partially suitable for this purpose, as each additional stop would have involved a lengthy acceleration process, resulting in corresponding increases in travel time on the entire route.\n\n\n=== Expansion Plans ===\nTo further improve the transportation situation for the three involved towns, it was decided to comprehensively expand the infrastructure of the branch line. In addition to extending it northward and establishing new stops in Ravensburg, electrification was also considered because operating a steam-powered railway through built-up streets was already seen as outdated. This was particularly true for the existing downtown route through Ravensburg, and especially regarding the intended northern extension. This extension was planned to pass directly through the town center of Weingarten, even passing by the Basilica. Moreover, electric traction was advantageous for reducing the distances between stops in the northern part of Ravensburg; this helped mitigate the time losses incurred during acceleration.\nAround the turn of the century, the LAG (Lokalbahn AG) was considered a pioneer in electrifying railway lines in Germany. It had gained early experience with electric railway operations on five of its routes:\n\nMeckenbeuren–Tettnang (opened in 1895, electrified from the beginning)\nTürkheim–Wörishofen (opened in 1896, electrified from the beginning, operated by LAG since 1905)\nBad Aibling–Feilnbach (opened in 1897, electrified from the beginning)\nIsartalbahn (electrified in 1900)\nMurnau–Oberammergau (electrified in 1905, albeit operated with alternating current)\nAt that time, numerous German cities had already established electric tramways, including Stuttgart in 1895 and nearby Ulm in 1897. Therefore, it was only logical to convert the steam tramway to Weingarten to electric traction.\nThe technical questions seemed less problematic than the legal ones. The main concern was the electricity monopoly of the Württembergische Gesellschaft für Elektrizitätswerke (WGE), a subsidiary of the Maschinenfabrik Esslingen, which was strongly linked to the state. After years of negotiations, a compromise was reached, which was significant for the procurement of vehicles. The LAG was allowed to establish its own power plant for its railway electricity within the WGE area. In compensation, it had to have its railcars built in Esslingen, not by its main supplier, MAN. However, at that time, Esslingen had little experience with electric vehicles, which is why special customizations had to be made according to the latest plans for the LAG, which ultimately proved to be absolutely suitable for operation.\nThe modernization and expansion of the infrastructure were carried out gradually. Alongside the expansion of the narrow-gauge railway, the construction of the standard-gauge railway lines Niederbiegen–Weingarten and Abzw Baienfurt West–Baienfurt Gbf was also planned. These two new lines were intended to take over freight traffic to and from Weingarten from the narrow-gauge railway and, for the first time in its history, provide Baienfurt with a connection to rail freight transportation. On 21 August 1909, the Württemberg state finally granted the permit for the extension. In contrast, the two standard-gauge lines were approved only on 14 May 1910.\n\n\n=== Failed Development of the City Center and the Southern District ===\nPrior to electrification, there were concrete plans to also connect the historic center of Ravensburg as well as the expanding new districts to the south by rail. To route the railway through what is now Marienplatz, a breakthrough through the city's own construction office was even planned, which at that time still served as a school building. However, the project ultimately failed not due to the loss of at least two classrooms, but due to the realization by the LAG that both the route through Eisenbahnstraße and through Bachstraße would have led to unreasonable bottlenecks and inclines. Apparently, nobody in the Ravensburg Magistrat had considered the noise pollution the railway would have caused in these narrow, densely built streets, extending late into the night for residents.\n\n\n=== Electrification, First Extension, and New Stops ===\n\nThe transition to electric operation took place on 1 September 1910, although steam operation was not definitively discontinued until September 1911. Initially, a voltage of 700 volts DC was chosen for the electrical supply, which was later increased to 750 volts in subsequent years. At the midpoint, a substation was established to power the overhead line. Simultaneously with electrification, the track infrastructure was modernized, and the line was extended by 950 meters with the addition of three new stops. The railway now extended to the northern outskirts of Weingarten, with the interim terminus located on the station square of the freight station under construction. However, the freight station itself was not put into operation until the following year. Additionally, about 300 meters of existing track in Weingarten were rerouted.\nFrom Ravensburg, the railway now crossed Waldseer Straße at the junction of Promenade and followed it, now on the right side, to the present-day Charlottenplatz. The former terminus Weingarten Stadt on the left side of Waldseer Straße was abandoned. It was replaced by the new stop Weingarten Charlottenstraße on the right side of Waldseer Straße. The new station was located in the green area near the current bus stop Weingarten Charlottenplatz (outbound) and was designed as a passing loop. Immediately afterward, the new route sharply turned 90 degrees to the right and proceeded through Charlottenstraße – now Abt-Hyller-Straße – initially in an eastern direction. After 500 meters, directly at Basilica St. Martin, where the new stop Weingarten Post was located, the route turned again sharply to the north at a right angle. From here, after passing the Weingarten Traube stop, it finally reached the interim terminus Weingarten Freight Station.\nThe new operations center of the railway was also built at Weingarten Freight Station. This included a wagon shed approximately 40 meters long with additional sidings in front of and beside the shed, as well as a six-part building with residential apartments for the approximately 70 railway employees at that time. The latter was located at Baienfurter Straße 22–32 and was designed in the same architectural style as the station building of the freight station. However, the old depot of the steam tramway on Waldseer Straße was abandoned in 1910. Concurrently, as planned, three new stops were established in the Ravensburg area along the existing route: Ravensburg Falken, Kraftwerk and Unterburach.\nThe Kraftwerk stop was designed as an additional passing loop. Thus, a total of four passing opportunities were available in 1910: Ravensburg Heilig Kreuz, Kraftwerk, 14 Nothelfer, and Weingarten Charlottenstraße. Despite being already on Weingarten territory, the Unterburach stop served to access the Burrach hamlet belonging to Ravensburg. Since both Kraftwerk and Unterburach were still in open fields at that time, like the 14 Nothelfer station in 1888, they did not receive a local designation.\nWith the new electric vehicles, the total capacity per train increased from 300 to 752 passengers, making the railway ready for peak traffic during events like Blutfreitag and Rutenfest. The electrification also led to the nickname \"Mühle\" (mill) for the entire railway. This referred to the control lever operated by the tram driver, which resembled a coffee mill crank.\n\n\n=== Second Extension - Baienfurt is reached ===\n\nJust over a year later, the second extension between the Weingarten freight station and the northern neighboring village of Baienfurt was also opened. The new route was built together with the standard gauge railway line Niederbiegen–Weingarten and therefore partly executed as a three-rail track. The new meter gauge section went into operation on 13 September 1911, and was exclusively served for passenger traffic from the beginning. Operations started at 5:45 a.m. and ended at 11:45 p.m. after a total of 66 trips. The festive opening with processions, speeches, and musical performances took place on 12 October 1911.\nThe new terminus, referred to as Baienfurt Ort to distinguish it from the northern Baienfurt freight station, was located only about 250 meters from the historic center of Baienfurt. It was situated immediately south of the bridge over the Wolfegger Ach, near today's Baienfurt Achtalschule bus stop. The total length of the route thus increased to 6.56 kilometers, of which only the last 180 meters were within Baienfurt's territory. The temporary terminus Weingarten Güterbahnhof became the fifth passing loop on the still completely single-track route. After 1911, only arriving or departing trains terminated or started there.\n\n\n=== The Traubenhof stop ===\n\nAs part of the extension to Baienfurt, an additional intermediate station was established about 200 meters south of the hamlet of Trauben, belonging to Weingarten. At that time, it was still in an open field. The Traubenhof stop also served to better connect the neighboring hamlets belonging to Baienfurt, namely Neubriach, Knechtenhaus, Briach, and Köpfingen. The name Traubenhof was coined by the LAG, as the associated hamlet was officially called Trauben already in 1911. This was done to avoid confusion with the simultaneously opened Weingarten Traube stop. This was only corrected in December 2007 when the corresponding bus stop was renamed from Weingarten Traubenhof to Weingarten Trauben. The Weingarten Traube bus stop had been closed for some time, so there is not longer a concern for confusion. Furthermore, during the railway's operating times, the Traubenhof stop never had the addition \"Weingarten\" in its name, although it already belonged to the city of Weingarten at that time. The addition was only introduced later during bus operations. The reason was to avoid confusion for passengers unfamiliar with the area whose destination was one of the four hamlets belonging to Baienfurt.\n\n\n=== Abandonment of the narrow-gauge freight traffic ===\nWith the commissioning of the standard-gauge line Niederbiegen–Weingarten on 1 October 1911, the use of freight traffic by narrow-gauge railway could finally be abandoned. From then on, freight for the machinery factory and other freight customers in Weingarten was delivered directly by standard-gauge freight cars from Niederbiegen. This measure proved to be a big success: While the narrow-gauge railway transported only 2,673 tons of freight in 1910, by 1914 the standard-gauge railway transported 111,594 tons of freight. This represents an increase of more than fortyfold, although it now also included goods to and from Baienfurt.\n\n\n=== Operation on the three-rail track ===\n\nThe three-rail track became a characteristic feature of the railway in the newly opened section. The section in question was just under a kilometer long and was located between the exit from the Weingarten freight station and the southern edge of Baienfurt. In the direction towards Baienfurt, the right rail of both gauges was used. This was practical for two reasons: firstly, because the platform edge of the Traubenhof stop was also on the right-hand side, and secondly because it only required the installation of two instead of four frog switches. Between the start of standard-gauge freight traffic to Weingarten on 1 October 1911, and the cessation of tram operations on the northern section on 30 June 1959, both meter-gauge electric passenger trains and steam-operated standard-gauge freight trains, occasionally also passenger trains, operated on the same track in this area. The section was double kilometered, meaning it was kilometered in opposite directions for the tramway from south to north and for the standard gauge. Consequently, the three-rail track later had two separate route numbers, namely 4522 for the tramway and 4520 for the railway. Legally, after 1938, the trams also operated in this short section according to the railway construction and operating regulations (EBO) and not, as on the other sections, according to the then newly introduced BOStrab.\nThe shared section was secured by means of a special signal board; there was no stationary signaling. Only the train whose crew possessed the single signal board at the time was allowed to travel through the section. Train movements on the standard-gauge line had to be reported by telephone to the operating management in Weingarten. Approval was only granted by the Weingarten operations manager if he had the signal board in his possession. This principle resembles the train staff system commonly used on single-track tram lines in the past, and it is still used today on the Kirnitzschtal tramway.\nFurthermore, the electric vehicles of the Ravensburg–Weingarten–Baienfurt line had traditional railway wheel tires. These were slightly wider than those commonly used on trams. This ensured that they could pass through the section with the three-rail track without any problems, especially at the two frog switches at the merging and branching points.\n\n\n=== No competition from the standard gauge ===\nAlthough the unelectrified standard-gauge line from Niederbiegen to Weingarten was primarily built for freight traffic, occasional scheduled passenger trains also operated on it from 1914 onwards. They ran in addition to the electric narrow-gauge trains to Ravensburg and provided passengers heading towards Ulm or the state capital Stuttgart with a shorter connection than via Ravensburg. However, this service was very sparse over the years, and passenger numbers were always far behind those of the electric narrow-gauge railway. For example, in 1914, only 16,519 passengers were carried on the standard-gauge railway, whereas in the same year, 839,865 passengers traveled on the narrow-gauge railway. The Niederbiegen line never became a serious competitor to the electrified line to Ravensburg. At times, passenger traffic on the freight line was also suspended, for example, from 1922 to 1925. In 1938, it was finally completely abandoned.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\nAfter surpassing the million mark in the last year before the war in 1913, World War I also meant a deep cut for the tramway. Initially, the LAG reduced the timetable to save oil in the company's own power plant. In 1917, it was finally connected to the general network of the Upper Swabian Electricity Works (OEW) with a substation because the railway transported numerous workers for the armaments industry in Friedrichshafen with its branches in Ravensburg and Weingarten.\n\n\n=== Difficult Interwar Period: 1920s: economic problems and temporary shutdowns ===\n\nAs with many other railway lines, the operation of the Ravensburg–Baienfurt connection also faced economic difficulties due to the recession in the first half of the 1920s. The closure of the route was even threatened at times. The financially struggling LAG (Local Railway Company) therefore demanded subsidy payments from the two participating cities. When these were not granted, the LAG actually suspended railway operations beginning 1 November 1923. Nevertheless, the city of Ravensburg stuck to its decision. Instead of the unpopular railway operation, which largely escaped municipal influence because decisions were always made in distant Munich, the city favored bus operation, thus hindering the further development of the railway. Despite the railway also serving an important intra-urban function in the city of Ravensburg – with five stops located within the Ravensburg city area, excluding Unterburach – the establishment of additional crossing stations in Ravensburg, for example, was never unanimously possible.  It was only when the city of Weingarten agreed to grant an annual subsidy that the railway could continue operating from 15 January 1924.  This reopening was initially intended as a one-month trial operation. However, due to its success – the new deficit was not as high as feared – the operation could continue even after the probation period expired. At that time, particularly during the holidays, a challenge for the LAG were the postal and private buses operating parallel to the railway. This competition only ended when the railway company legally enforced its transportation monopoly.\n\n\n=== Temporary stabilization in the 1930s ===\nIn the 1930s, the then mayor of Ravensburg, Rudolf Walzer, attempted to replace the perceived outdated tramway with motorbus transport, which could have extended to the southern part of the city. However, after an examination of the situation, the Reichspost was not interested, and the Ministry of the Interior insisted on retaining the established railway – as did the adjacent communities of Weingarten and Baienfurt.\nDespite its economic problems, the LAG continued to invest in railway operations. For example, in 1931, it succeeded in expanding the central Ravensburg Frauentor stop to become the sixth crossing station, despite resistance from the city of Ravensburg. This expansion also involved realignment; trains traveling towards Baienfurt now passed on the left side of the Kreuzbrunnen. Although a renovation of the LAG was achieved again in 1934 through loans from the German Reichsbahn, capital reductions, and concessions from the states of Württemberg and Bavaria (because of the two Upper Swabian LAG routes), it only postponed the end. In the mid-1930s (before 1936), the LAG finally abolished the distinction between carriage classes. Previously, the two middle compartments of the four-axle railcars or the end compartment of the single two-axle railcar were designated as 2nd class (\"upholstered class\"), while the remaining seats in the railcars and most of the trailers represented 3rd class (\"wooden class\"). This differentiation was highly atypical for a tram-like operation with comparatively short travel times. Capacity could thus be slightly increased. For example, the large railcars now had 48 seats instead of the previous 44. However, the spatial separation from the compartments of the former 2nd class was not eliminated; it now serve as a division between smoking and non-smoking areas. Even in 1937, just a year before the liquidation of the company, two new four-axle trailers were acquired.\n\n\n=== First conflicts with road traffic ===\nMotorization increased significantly between the two world wars. While carriages and carts were formally the primary mode of transportation, automobiles now dominated. In 1934, the Württemberg State Road 49 was designated as Reichsstraße 30, further increasing its importance. Therefore, plans for a bypass road for the towns of Ravensburg, Weingarten, and Baienfurt were already made between 1936 and 1942.\nThis development also increasingly influenced tram operations. In the 1930s, it became increasingly apparent that the street-level alignment chosen in 1888 was only partially compatible with the requirements of modern road traffic. It became increasingly clear that the Ravensburg–Weingarten–Baienfurt railway was more of a tramway, a mode of transport actively participating in road traffic. For example, the step-boards of the trains posed a problem as they protruded 20 centimeters beyond the actual clearance profile of the railway and occasionally endangered road traffic. Therefore, in the last years of LAG management, the steps were angled towards the end of the vehicles. In addition, during those years, directional indicators (informally known as \"blinkers\") were retrofitted to the railcars – but not the trailers – in accordance with the regulations of the newly introduced Road Traffic Licensing Regulations, which came into effect on 13 November 1937.\nTo prevent nighttime accidents with motor vehicles, whose out-of-town drivers, according to court records in the Ravensburg area, were least likely to expect an oncoming tram, the front ends of the railcars also received a second headlight and two roof lights in this period.\n\n\n=== The new Baienfurt Süd stop ===\nThe Baienfurt Süd stop at kilometer 6.3 was introduced later to better serve the residential area north of Baienfurter Friedhofstraße. This increased the total number of tram stops from 14 to 15, decreasing the average distance between stops from 505 to 469 meters. It was the only stop newly established between electrification in 1910 and closure in 1959. The date of its opening is not recorded. However, it was still located within the municipal boundaries of Weingarten, as the city boundary to Baienfurt ran slightly further north of the station. Parallel to this, there was already a Baienfurt Süd stop about a hundred meters westward. However, unlike the jointly served Traubenhof stop, these two stations were completely separate operationally.\n\n\n=== Under the management of the state railway - 1938: From LAG branch line to DR tramway ===\n\nSince the economic situation of the LAG did not improve, the nationalization of the LAG was finally decided in the Reich Law Gazette Number 23 of 20 June 1938. Taking effect on 1 August 1938, all assets of the LAG were given over to the German Reich. The Deutsche Reichsbahn (DR) took over the operation of all LAG routes as of this date, including the tram-like operation Ravensburg–Weingarten–Baienfurt. The line now belonged to the Reichsbahndirektion Stuttgart. The LAG depot in Weingarten became the locomotive station Weingarten, which was a branch of the Bahnbetriebswerk Friedrichshafen.\nThe meter-gauge line to Baienfurt was a particularity for the Deutsche Reichsbahn. It was operated as the only German state railway line according to the Regulation on the Construction and Operation of Tramways (BOStrab), which had already come into force on 1 April 1938. From the timetables from 1943 onwards, the Reichskursbuch explicitly indicated \"electric tramway\" in the header, while in the winter edition of 1941/42, the general notice \"Electric operation\" was still present. From 1944 onwards, the – typically found on all other single-class branch lines – notice \"All trains 3rd class only\" was finally omitted, implying that a uniform class for tramway operations was assumed.\nHowever, the Deutsche Reichsbahn had already been responsible for the operation of the steam tram Neuötting–Altötting, which was shut down in 1930, for ten years prior. It acquired this line from the Royal Bavarian State Railways upon its foundation in 1920. Unlike in Württemberg, a clear distinction between a tramway and a railway was possible under Bavarian law before 1938. Additionally, the Deutsche Reichsbahn also owned the State Goods Railway Deuben, which was also licensed as a tramway. Although it was built by the Royal Saxon State Railways, it was operated by the Dresden tramway.\nThe classification as a tramway meant, among other things, that through-ticketing between the tramway to Baienfurt and the railway was still not possible, even though they were operated by the same company since 1938. Passengers could not purchase through tickets from railway stations to destinations on the tramway. Conversely, conductors on the tramway did not sell tickets to destinations beyond Ravensburg. The same applied to luggage transport; through luggage check-in was not possible. Additionally, limited luggage transport applied to all trains. Furthermore, the transition from a branch line to a tramway was also noticeable externally: the railcars were equipped with destination signs prescribed by the BOStrab. Section 32 states: \"The first vehicle of a scheduled train must display a destination sign at the front, which must be clearly visible even in darkness.\"\n\n\n=== New Station Names ===\nFurthermore, after the Deutsche Reichsbahn took over the line in 1938, new designations were introduced for some tram stops. These changes likely occurred at the first timetable change after the takeover, at the beginning of the winter timetable 1938/39 – 2 valid from October 1938:\n\nWith the addition of (Württ) for Württemberg, confusion with the railway stations Weingarten (Baden) or Weingarten (Pfalz) was to be avoided. The reason for renaming Weingarten Scherzachbrücke to Weingarten Lamm is not documented. Lamm was the name of a hotel in the neighboring Liebfrauenstraße 53. Nevertheless, the Traubenhof stop continued to be designated without the addition of Weingarten or Weingarten (Württ). The station Unterburach received the additional name Ravensburg, although it was located in the territory of Weingarten. This was because the district named Burach belongs to Ravensburg. Additionally, the city border in this area runs directly next to the former railway track.\n\n\n=== National Socialism and Further Renamed Stops ===\nDuring the Nazi era, Weingarten was incorporated into Ravensburg on 1 April 1939. With the exception of the northern terminus Baienfurt Ort, all tram stops were now located within the city limits of Ravensburg. In this context, two tram stops in Weingarten were renamed. This presumably happened at the beginning of the summer timetable on 15 May 1939:\n\nThe renaming in the first case is evident since there was already a Charlottenstraße in the old town of Ravensburg, which is still named such today. In the second case, the Christian name addition \"14 Nothelfer\" was eliminated for political reasons. However, the Weingarten hospital itself was not renamed; it still carries its Christian name addition and is now operated as Krankenhaus 14 Nothelfer GmbH. Paradoxically, the Weingarten tram stops continued to be prefixed with Weingarten (Württ), even though Weingarten did not officially exist on paper during this time.\n\n\n=== World War II and Period following war ===\nDuring World War II, the tramway was allowed to operate even during air raids. In contrast to municipally operated tramways in other cities, it was subject to the Railway Air Protection as a public transport railway. This is evident from a letter written by the responsible DR operations office in Friedrichshafen on 22 February 1941.\nThere were no serious war damages to the tramway, so it could continue to operate continuously during the war. However, on 23 April 1945, operations were suspended because the Wehrmacht erected tank barriers at that time. On 28 April 1945, French forces entered Ravensburg. The barriers were leveled again. The city and the tramway henceforth belonged to the French occupation zone. Operations were initially suspended. However, on 18 June 1945, Steiner, the French military governor of the Ravensburg district, ordered the resumption of tramway operations. After a little over two and a half months of interruption, it resumed normal operations on 11 July 1945. To ensure orderly railway operations, the new authorities first established the Upper Directorate of the German Railways of the French-occupied Zone with its headquarters in Speyer on 8 January 1946. The tramway to Baienfurt also fell under this authority. On 25 June 1947, it was finally merged into the Operating Association of the Southwest German Railways, whose headquarters were also in Speyer.\n\n\n=== Era of the German Federal Railway ===\nIn the post-war period, the Ravensburg-Weingarten-Baienfurt tramway shared the fate of the other railway lines in the French-occupied zone. With the amalgamation of the Southwest German Railways, they passed into the ownership of the German Federal Railway due to the Federal Railways Act of 18 December 1951. From then on, Ravensburg-Weingarten-Baienfurt was not only the only tram operation of the German Federal Railway, but also the only tram operation still owned by the German state. Despite numerous nationalizations, the parallel existing German Reichsbahn did not own a tram operation. The former electric narrow-gauge railway Klingenthal-Sachsenberg-Georgenthal of the German Reichsbahn was operated under similar circumstances to the Baienfurt line, yet it was legally always classified as a railway – regardless of the use of only slightly modified tram vehicles.\n\n\n=== Traffic Issues ===\nDuring the 1950s, not only did the number of tram passengers increase, but also the use of private vehicles in Ravensburg and its surroundings continued to rise. This so-called mass motorization increasingly posed problems for the tramway. The conflicts already known from the 1930s worsened further. Especially in the city center of Ravensburg and on the sections along Federal Highway 30, which emerged from Reichsstraße 30 in 1949, the tram was increasingly perceived as a traffic hindrance. Due to the rails laid in side position, trams traveling towards Ravensburg came directly towards northbound road users in the town sections of Ravensburg and Baienfurt. The relatively wide old vehicles of the tramway, more resembling a narrow-gauge railway than a traditional tram in construction and size, exacerbated the problem. This led, among other things, to trucks on the road protruding into the clearance profile needed by the tram in curves. Additionally, the asymmetrical design of the old vehicles posed difficulties. They were wider in the passenger compartments than in the entry platforms area. As a result, the actual space they needed could hardly be estimated from the front.\nAt the beginning of the 1950s, the protruding steps of the old vehicles also caused problems again. The inclination made during the LAG era could not solve the problem in the long run. In the first half of the 1950s, the German Federal Railway therefore decided, as a emergency measure, to permanently lock the doors on the west side. The obstructive steps on the road side, i.e., towards Federal Highway 30, could thus be completely removed. This conversion was only possible because all platforms of the tramway Ravensburg-Weingarten-Baienfurt were located on the same side – namely on the east side. Furthermore, this successfully prevented passengers from disembarking directly on the road side and being endangered by traffic. This relatively rare operating form of bidirectional operation with doors on one side still exists today on the Kirnitzschtalbahn, the Drachenfelsbahn, the Gmunden tram, and the Italian railway line Trieste-Opicina, even though the reasons for this differ partially for the mentioned operations.\n\n\n=== 1953 to 1955: Hesitant Modernization and Timetable ===\nAt the beginning of the 1950s, the number of tram passengers on the Ravensburg-Weingarten-Baienfurt tramway suddenly increased. While about two million passengers were carried annually in the immediate post-war period, in 1951 there were already 3,192,650, with a further increasing trend. During that time, the tramway to Baienfurt became a mass transit system. Despite the massive traffic problems, the German Federal Railway initially did not consider converting the line to bus operation. To meet the increasing traffic demand, a fixed 20-minute interval timetable was introduced all day beginning in 1953, with service every 30 minutes after 9:00 p.m. This replaced the previous demand-oriented timetable. However, before that, the entire tramway fleet had to be converted from the traditional manually operated trumpet coupling to the modern automatic BSI compact coupling. This rationalization measure significantly simplified shunting operations, especially the turnaround at the termini. This was necessary because the new timetable allowed for relatively short turnaround times. Thus, in Baienfurt, only three minutes and in Ravensburg, only four minutes were scheduled for the turnaround process. To ensure punctual operation, it was essential, especially in case of delays, to avoid delaying the departure of the tram in the opposite direction.\nHowever, at the same time, the city of Ravensburg pushed forward the plan to convert the tramway to bus operation. Without the involvement of Weingarten and Baienfurt, an initial meeting between Ravensburg and the German Federal Railway took place on 12 June 1953. Due to the increasing motor vehicle traffic, it was planned to widen Federal Highway 30 – at the expense of the tramway track – to four lanes. Furthermore, the existing city bus service in Ravensburg was considered deficient due to its short routes and was expected to become more economical by incorporating the longer route to Baienfurt. The German Federal Railway agreed and, for cost reasons, also demanded diesel bus services. In contrast, Weingarten and Baienfurt formed an alliance in favor of the tramway and commissioned corresponding counter-reports.\nAfter passenger numbers continued to increase in the following years, the German Federal Railway decided to further increase the frequency shortly after the introduction of the interval timetable. To this end, in 1954, it acquired two modern large-capacity railcars for its unusual branch of operations. With this, the fleet increased from six to eight railcars. They needed to operate every ten minutes between Ravensburg Bahnhof and Weingarten Charlottenplatz during peak hours. This further expansion of services was introduced in 1955. Thus, the German Federal Railway continued the modernization of the tramway that had begun in 1953, albeit very hesitantly. With the ten-minute interval, the tramway reached the limit of its capacity; because the track remained single throughout even after 1955. However, the frequency increase was also associated with a significant fare increase; thus, ticket prices rose by 40% on 1 October 1955.\n\n\n=== 1956 to 1957: Class Reform and Three-Light Head Signal ===\n\nWith the so-called class reform – meaning the abolition of the former 1st class – the tram cars operating between Ravensburg and Baienfurt were \"upgraded\" with the start of the summer timetable on 3 June 1956. Consequently, the timetable now stated consistently: All trains only 2nd class. However, in practice, the German Federal Railway – like the former German Reichsbahn before – did not label their tram vehicles accordingly. Unlike the other vehicles of the two state railways, they were not marked with the respective class numbers. Thus, the change in 1956 was merely on paper.\nRegardless of the traffic problems described above, the railcars of the Ravensburg-Weingarten-Baienfurt tramway also received an additional front headlight installed in the roof area in 1957. This ensured the so-called three-light head signal. Its introduction was demanded by the legislature to better distinguish rail vehicles from the steadily growing number of road vehicles at night. However, the introduction was nationwide according to the Road Traffic Licensing Regulations and had nothing to do with the explicit safety problems on the route discussed here.\n\n\n=== 1957 to 1958: Fatal Traffic Accident and Controversial Closure Plans ===\nIn the second half of the 1950s, the mutual impediments between the tramway and the further increasing motor vehicle traffic became unbearable for the government. After a series of traffic accidents between 1956 and 1958, they repeatedly pushed for the closure of the operation. In contrast, the local population advocated for the retention of the rail service, partly because they feared higher fares in case of conversion to bus operation. For example, opponents cited the existing bus connection from Ravensburg to Eschach, where a ticket cost two and a half times as much as a tram ticket on the approximately equally long route to Baienfurt. While the German Federal Railway acknowledged the imminent fare increase, it pointed out that \"this increase would also be unavoidable if rail operations were maintained\".\nOn 3 July 1957, there was another serious traffic accident, resulting in the first fatality. A long timber truck collided with a tram at the Ravensburg Kraftwerk stop while traveling to Weingarten – three passengers were injured, and a 58-year-old woman died. The 20-year-old truck driver was initially acquitted on 11 June 1958, but the Ravensburg Regional Court overturned the verdict on 24 September 1958, and convicted the driver – but also attributed partial blame to the tramway. Police investigations revealed that the load protruded up to 40 centimeters beyond the side limit of the truck. Additionally, it was the driver's first time driving this long and heavy vehicle, and the tachograph recorded a speed between 45 and 50 km/h on the narrow, busy, and uneven road, which was only five and a half meters wide.\nThe revision of the judgment prompted authorities to impose a maximum speed limit of ten kilometers per hour on the tramway by decree on 9 October 1958, effective 13 October 1958. This applied to the sections Ravensburg Bahnhof–Ravensburg Frauentor and Ravensburg Heilig Kreuz–Weingarten Lamm. Furthermore, in the fall of 1958, the aforementioned protruding passenger compartments of the old vehicles were provisionally marked with a conspicuous red-white striped warning marking. However, the proposal by the Federal Railway to install a continuous white line along the tracks at a safety distance of 40 centimeters on the road of Federal Highway 30 was rejected by government agencies.\nAs a result of the ten kilometers per hour speed limit, travel times increased, and due to limited crossing opportunities, the intermediate services introduced in 1955 as part of the ten-minute interval during peak hours could no longer be offered. Consequently, the already comparatively slow tramway lost even more attractiveness compared to competing individual traffic – or to the envisaged bus operation. Students and workers could no longer travel home during lunch breaks. This led to massive protests from citizens and businesses, with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce considering a strike. As a replacement for the missing additional services between Weingarten and Ravensburg, the German Federal Railway provisionally operated buses during peak hours, alternating with trams, which now ran at intervals of at most every 20 minutes.\nBecause under the given conditions, competitive operation was no longer possible, the German Federal Railway presented the Baden-Württemberg state government with a choice: Either the state would cover the difference of 1.97 million marks between the costs of bus operation and the higher costs of a traffic-safe operation of the tramway route – or agree to a complete switch to buses. The state railway wanted to protect its employees from legal risks, among other reasons.\nConsequently, the state government in Stuttgart decided to switch to bus operation. Furthermore, after the closure of the tramway, Federal Highway 30 between Ravensburg and Weingarten was to be expanded to four lanes for a total of 2.8 million German marks. Initially, however, only an – immediately feasible – widening of 35 centimeters was planned, which was necessary for smooth operation of future bus traffic. This measure was entrusted to the cities of Ravensburg and Weingarten. At the same time, the planned bypass road for Ravensburg, which had already been specifically planned at the end of the 1950s, was abandoned. At that time, the concept of the so-called Car-Friendly City, named after the book of the same name published in 1959, was also pursued in Upper Swabia, where the tramway was discontinued that year by the Ravensburg Otto Maier Verlag.\n\n\n=== 1959: Gradual Transition to Rail Replacement Service ===\n\nAs early as 27 October 1958, the Stuttgart Regional Railway Directorate decreed: \"Large buses will temporarily take over traffic between Ravensburg and Weingarten. The former 20-minute service on the Weingarten – Baienfurt route will be resumed.\" However, due to an administrative complaint from the city of Weingarten and the municipality of Baienfurt, which, unlike the city of Ravensburg, continued to advocate for the retention of the railway, the state railway could not initially implement its plan as planned. Ultimately, the protests from Weingarten and Baienfurt were ineffective. In January 1959, the President of the Stuttgart Regional Railway Directorate, Kurt Hagner, announced the switch to bus operation, and on 12 February 1959, the Tübingen Regional Council announced that beginning 23 February 1959, tram services would only run between Weingarten Charlottenplatz and Baienfurt Ort. The timetable for these services was only published by the German Federal Railway two days earlier, on 21 February 1959. However, the bus service temporarily introduced between Ravensburg and Weingarten was legally considered provisional. Due to the pending administrative complaint, it was declared as so-called emergency service. Therefore, de jure, it initially constituted rail replacement service. For passengers from Baienfurt, this temporarily meant having to transfer in Weingarten.\nAfter another four months, when enough buses were available, the remaining 2.5-kilometer section in the northern part of the Weingarten–Baienfurt route was finally converted to bus operation. The trams ran for the last time on Tuesday, 30 June 1959. Even though the buses to Baienfurt initially continued to operate legally as rail replacement service, the German Federal Railway officially designated the route as a rail bus line as of 1 July 1959. However, there was no specific line designation at that time, and several years later the typical four-digit line numbers in rail bus services were introduced by the German Federal Railway. This bus service introduced in 1959 initially had a provisional character. For example, due to the lack of suitable stops, the Ravensburg Unterburach, Ravensburg Kraftwerk, Traubenhof, and Baienfurt Süd stops could not initially be served. Additionally, in 1959, with the introduction of rail replacement service, two stops were renamed:\n\nOn the other hand, the transition also led to significant improvements in the transportation situation. For example, the buses in Baienfurt now extended beyond the previous terminus to Baienfurt Feuerwehrhaus, thus also serving the Baienfurt town center. Furthermore, the timetable was expanded further, although this improvement was primarily a result of the lower capacity of buses compared to tramway trains.\nThe intermediate services between Weingarten and Ravensburg were now offered not only during peak hours but throughout the day until around 9:00 p.m. Furthermore, they now ran not only to Weingarten Charlottenplatz but all the way to Weingarten Güterbahnhof. During the morning peak hours (from 6:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m.), the intermediate services even ran all the way to Baienfurt. This meant that a ten-minute interval service was now offered for the entire route.\nThe 20-minute base frequency of the tramway was also extended into the evening hours after 9:00 p.m. It now applied until the end of operations. Furthermore, during peak hours between Ravensburg Bahnhof and Weingarten Güterbahnhof, so-called express buses operated in addition to the intermediate services. They only stopped at the Ravensburg Frauentor, Weingarten Lamm, and Weingarten Post stops. These services were specially marked by a red diagonal line on the signage, indicating a so-called canceled line signal.\n\n\n=== Outdated Fleet ===\nIn addition to the traffic problems, the very outdated fleet of the railway also played a significant role in the decision to switch to bus operation. In the year of discontinuation in 1959, the eight railcars of the railway had been in service on average for 37.5 years, including the two new railcars from 1954. At that time, the five railcars procured for electrification had already been in service for 49 years each, and they were also worn out due to two world wars. The situation was even more critical with the eleven trailers. In 1959, they averaged 56.1 years old. Six of them were still from the steam tramway era and thus from the founding year of the railway. These veterans were already 71 years old at that time. Additionally, the introduction of the clock timetable in 1953 exacerbated the situation – it significantly increased the daily mileage of the vehicles – as did the heavy usage due to continuously increasing passenger numbers. While the six railcars together with the trailers in the early years of the electric tramway only transported around one million passengers annually, by 1954, the total number of passengers was almost five million.\n\n\n=== Spirit of the Time and General Trend ===\nThus, almost 21 years after being taken over by the Reichsbahn, the second tramway in German state ownership, following the former Neuötting–Altötting steam tramway, became history. Regardless of the specific situation on the Ravensburg–Baienfurt route, the discontinuation of the railway followed a general trend in West Germany in two respects. Firstly, many municipal transport companies at that time also converted their tramways to bus or trolleybus operation. In 1959 alone, six more operations were discontinued (Rheydt, Herne–Castrop-Rauxel, Minden, Solingen, Völklingen, and Lübeck). The weekly newspaper \"die Zeit\" describes this spirit of the time in its 6 March 1959 issue, as follows: \"So the tramway is finally on the extinction list – here as elsewhere. But it is difficult to make people understand in the heat of the battle of Weingarten and Ravensburg that a new era is dawning ...\"\nOn the other hand, the German Federal Railway soon also ceased passenger services on its other narrow-gauge lines. Due to their elaborate operation, they were considered uneconomical: in 1960 for the Walhallabahn, in 1964 for the two neighboring lines Öchsle and Federseebahn in Upper Swabia, in 1966 for the Bottwartalbahn, in 1967 for the Altensteigerle, and in 1973 for the Odenwaldexpress. Although the Zabergäubahn was converted to standard gauge in 1964/65, it was also eventually switched to bus operation in 1986. The Wangerooger Inselbahn has become the sole DB narrow-gauge railway that still operates today.\n\n\n=== Bus Service from 1962 to Present - Downgrading and Final Establishment of Bus Operation ===\n\nOver the course of 1961, they began dismantling the overhead lines and the tarring over of the tracks. Between Ravensburg Bahnhof and Frauentor, they were completely removed in August of the that year. On 1 January 1964, the tramway line was finally formally decommissioned and thus declassified. The three-rail section remained unaffected; it was still used by standard-gauge freight trains to Weingarten until 26 October 1999, and was officially decommissioned on 1 December 1999.\n\n\n=== From Rail Bus Line to City Bus Network ===\nOver the decades, the rail bus line evolved into a regular city bus route network. The direct successors of the tramway are today's bus lines 1 and 2. Their route exactly corresponds to that of the former tram line. However, both lines are now trunk lines and also serve the Ravensburg districts of Schmalegg and Weststadt in the southwest. Furthermore, they extend northward beyond Baienfurt to Baindt. In addition, new lines were introduced. They also serve residential areas located away from the former tram line, such as today's line 3 to Hegaustraße (at Sonnenbüchel) or line 5 to Schacherösch (to Baienfurt).\nThe former rail bus division of the German Federal Railway – which took over the operation of the tramway at that time – was dissolved in 1989, and it turned into DB ZugBus Regionalverkehr Alb-Bodensee (RAB), which still exists today. It was initially a wholly-owned subsidiary of the German Federal Railway, and since its privatization in 1994, it has been a subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn AG.\nThe RAB cooperates closely with the cities of Ravensburg and Weingarten and the private bus companies in the area. Initially, this was done as part of the Rundumbus Ravensburg Weingarten transport community, which was launched in 1996 and evolved into today's stadtbus Ravensburg Weingarten GmbH in 2004. The RAB, along with Stadtwerke Ravensburg, Stadtwerke Weingarten, and two private bus companies, is a shareholder of the GmbH. It owns the largest share (45.2%) in the joint company. In addition to its own lines, it also operates lines that are licensed to Stadtwerke Ravensburg or Stadtwerke Weingarten, as these companies do not have their own buses. The operation of city bus services by the Deutsche Bahn Group is relatively rare due to the licensing of the former tramway. Usually, the companies of DB Stadtverkehr GmbH only operate regional buses.\n\n\n=== Today's traffic situation ===\nThe former tram route remains the main axis in the public transport of the cities Ravensburg and Weingarten. Most bus stops are still located at the same positions as the 15 former tram stops. Moreover, even over sixty years later, eight stops still carry their old names, although the addition \"(Württ)\" for the Weingarten stops has been omitted:\n\n\n=== Passenger Transport Frequency Over the Years ===\nIn comparison to the later electric railway, the steam tram operated with its two sets of trains relatively infrequently in the early years of the railway. As late as 1897, only eleven trips were offered on weekdays, the same number as in the opening year of 1888. This changed later: With 37 (1906) or even 38 (1909) daily train trips per direction, the steam tram had reached the limit of its capacity. After electrification and extension of the route, the timetable was further condensed. In 1914, with a total of six available motorcars, trains ran approximately every 30 minutes, and on Sunday afternoons, about every 20 minutes. In economically difficult times (1927 and 1946), one train per hour had to suffice. But already by 1934 or 1948, the frequency was back to normal. Until 1953, the schedule was largely demand-oriented, primarily focusing on connections to and from the trains on the Südbahn (Southern Railway). It was only in 1953 that a fixed interval timetable was introduced for the entire day. The following data are recorded over the years:\n\nThe individual trips were distinguished by train numbers, which were used as late as 1944, which is atypical for a tram. However, they are no longer listed in the 1957 timetable. The courses in the direction of Baienfurt had even numbers, while those in the direction of Ravensburg had odd numbers. At times, the demand was so high that individual courses had to be additionally reinforced by so-called \"advantages\"; these additional trains are not included in the table. Advantage and main trains then followed each other at a sight distance, the advantages were appropriately marked to ensure that the oncoming trains had to wait for the main train in the passing loops.\n\n\n=== Operating Hours ===\nThe operating hours also corresponded to the usual times for major city tramway operations, even in the war year of 1944, trains ran until shortly before midnight:\n1920: from 4:55 a.m. to 11:05 p.m.\n1944: from 4:52 a.m. to 11:55 p.m.\n1957: from 4:23 a.m. to 01:06 a.m.\n\n\n=== Travel Times and Speed ===\nAccording to the timetable of 1920, most trains still needed 33 minutes for the entire route Ravensburg–Baienfurt, which corresponds to an average speed of only 11.9 km/h. In later years, the timetable was somewhat streamlined; in 1944 and 1957, for example, most trains covered the entire route in 26 or 27 minutes, respectively, that is, at an average speed of 15.1 or 14.6 km/h.\n\n\n=== Circuits ===\nWith the introduction of the fixed interval timetable, the following vehicle requirements arose in the last six years of operation:\n\n\n=== Passenger Numbers ===\n\n\n== Vehicles ==\n\n\n=== Procurements Over the Years ===\n\nFor the opening of the steam tramway, two box locomotives without engine casings were procured, the LAG 1 and LAG 2 with serial numbers 1814 and 1817. They were from the company Krauss & Co., a co-shareholder of LAG, and were the first locomotives of LAG. An identical train had been delivered by Krauss shortly before to the Chiemsee Railway.\nFor passenger cars, the steam tramway had seven two-axle trailers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 16) and three freight cars (6, 7, and 17) available. The passenger cars were supplied by MAN, weighing 5000 or 6050 kilograms, with lengths of 8.35 meters and widths of 2.5 meters, and a wheelbase of 3.9 meters.\n\nTo start electric operations, the vehicle fleet was extensively expanded. At that time, LAG acquired a total of five large four-axle railcars from Maschinenfabrik Esslingen, their electrical equipment was from Siemens-Schuckertwerke (SSW). They were designated as elT (for electric railcar) at LAG and numbered 800 to 804. They were complemented by three two-axle trailers (832, 833, and 834), including a half-luggage car. In addition, the former trailers of the steam tramway were continued to be used behind the new railcars.\n\nIn 1914, a smaller two-axle railcar with number 875 was added, later known by the nickname \"Piccolo\". Its electrical equipment – differing from the existing four-axle ones – came from Maschinenfabrik Oerlikon in Switzerland. In 1937, LAG finally procured two large four-axle trailers (921 and 922). They had the same capacity as the large railcars. In 1941, the Deutsche Reichsbahn introduced new designations for railcars and their associated trailers. At that time, the four-axle railcars were assigned to the series 196.0 (ET 196.0 or EB 196.0), and the two-axle ones were grouped under series 197.0 (ET 197.0 or EB 197.0).\nWith the introduction of the 1955 schedule densification to and from Weingarten Charlottenplatz, Deutsche Bundesbahn procured two large four-axle high-capacity cars from Duewag. Their electrical equipment came from Kiepe, and they entered service on 9 April 1954. In principle, these were standard vehicles, as procured by many German tramway companies at that time. They were classic bidirectional vehicles, but with the peculiarity – similar to the few years earlier converted old vehicles – that they only had doors on one side. Also characteristic of the two Duewag tramcars of Deutsche Bundesbahn was the scissor-type current collector unusually located in the middle of the car, as well as the absence of line number boxes. Furthermore, due to the design of the new cars, smoking compartments could not be designated in the new cars, unlike the old ones. The two railcars were classified as Class ET 195 (ET 195 01 and ET 195 02; serial numbers 26887 and 26888) and were occasionally operated in double traction. However, due to technical reasons, their electrical equipment was incompatible, so they could not be operated together with the older vehicles. The two new railcars became the backbone of the railway, but the old railcars remained indispensable. Especially during the 1955 ten-minute interval schedule and during peak times, in which case the older vehicles were preferred to be sent ahead of the new railcars as \"extras\".\n\n\n== Colours ==\nOriginally, the vehicles of LAG were uniformly painted dark green. Around 1936, a two-tone paint scheme was introduced, with the vehicles painted light green below the windows, while the window band was \"pale cream.\" The two areas were separated by a dark green dividing line. Shortly thereafter, they were repainted by the Deutsche Reichsbahn into their commonly used railcar livery, with the lower part below the windows being light red, while the window band remained pale cream.\nSubsequently, the Deutsche Bundesbahn introduced another scheme, painting the vehicles dark red, similar to their other railcars. This paint scheme was complemented by three white decorative stripes running around the roof area, at the level of the window sills, and above the lower edge of the car body. However, as a special feature, the two large-capacity cars from 1954 – differing from the rest of the tram fleet in particular and the other railcars of the Deutsche Bundesbahn in general – were painted light green. This unique paint scheme was complemented by a circumferential decorative strip connected with a similarly circumferential dark decorative stripe – both just below the window band.\n\n\n== Disposition of the Vehicles ==\n\nAll vehicles of the tram that were still present at the time of its cessation in 1959 were initially stored on the premises in Weingarten. The majority of them were eventually scrapped around 1962, after the track had been legally decommissioned. Only the four newest vehicles of the tram – the two trailers from 1937 and the two railcars from 1954 – were able to be sold. Three of them were preserved and serve as reminders of the tram.\nThe railcars ET 195 01 and ET 195 02 – just five years old at the time of cessation – were sold by the Deutsche Bundesbahn to the Dutch railway company Rotterdamsche Tramweg Maatschappij (RTM) in 1961. They were converted for operation on the non-electrified network of RTM by adding a generator car. This diesel-electric railcar, now designated as M 17, was transferred to the Austrian Zillertalbahn in 1967. Since 1999, the train has been back in the Netherlands and has been regularly used on the RTM museum railway line between Ouddorp and West-Repart since October 2003.\n\nThe trailers EB 196 01 (formerly 921) and EB 196 02 (formerly 922) were acquired by the Austrian Stern & Hafferl Verkehrsgesellschaft in 1962, but only EB 196 02 entered service, receiving the new operating number B 20,221. EB 196 01, on the other hand, was scrapped in Austria without ever being used. The remaining B 20,221 (formerly EB 196 02) underwent a major inspection at Stern & Hafferl in September 1971 and was then in service on the Gmunden–Vorchdorf local railway until 1976. In October 1980, it was transferred to the Stuttgart Tramway Museum, where it was provisionally stored at the former depot of the Esslingen–Nellingen–Denkendorf tramway in Nellingen, in anticipation of the planned museum operation between Nellingen and Neuhausen. After the museum plans fell through, it was finally transferred to the German Railway Association in June 1986. After extensive restoration, it has been in operation on the Bruchhausen-Vilsen–Asendorf museum railway since December 1990. Under the new operating number 21, it is used either as a trailer behind railcars or \"out of class\" in classic steam or diesel trains.\n\n\n== Relics ==\n\nApart from the three vehicles preserved elsewhere as museum pieces, little remains today to remind us of the tram. The meter-gauge sections were completely removed due to road expansion. In front of Ravensburg Station, the tracks were covered with asphalt for many years, and with the construction of the new bus station around 1990, these last traces of rails were also removed. The former three-rail track between Weingarten and Baienfurt, abandoned in 1999, still exists partially, but the original rails and sleepers in this section have been replaced over the years with used two-rail track components from other standard gauge lines. The following relics remind us of the tram:\n\nAt the former freight station in Weingarten, aside from the former station building of the standard gauge line, the former tramcar depot still exists, now used as a bus depot for the RAB. This is the focal point of the independent RAB branch in Weingarten. Inside, there is, among other things, a bus wash. Buses are also parked on the former track area. The property is still owned by the state.\nOn the premises of the Weingarten depot, two steel overhead line masts have been preserved, used as street lamps.\nAt the former Ravensburg Frauentor stop, now the Ravensburg Schussenstraße bus stop, the wooden station building has been preserved. The small house attached to the Green Tower was built around the turn of the century by the LAG and used as a ticket sales office. Today, it serves as a kiosk and is classified as a cultural monument.\nOccasionally, the brackets for the overhead line tensioning have been preserved on the buildings along the route. Among them are seven artistically ornamented overhead line rosettes from the year of electrification. One can be found at Gartenstraße 8, Gartenstraße 10, Gartenstraße 34, Schussenstraße 2, and Schussenstraße 18, and two more at the building complex of the former Maschinenfabrik Ravensburg in Schussenstraße 21.\nDuring the parade of the Welfenfest, celebrated annually in the summer in Weingarten, a parade group recalls the \"Bähnle.\" Students dressed as passengers and conductors accompany a model of a tram.\n\n\n== Reactivation Plans ==\nThe demand to reactivate the former Ravensburg-Weingarten-Baienfurt tramway as part of a modern regional light rail system reappears in politics from time to time, for instance, by the Green Party (Bündnis 90/Die Grünen) in August 2005. The passenger association PRO BAHN also supported such a project in a position paper from January 2003. These considerations are influenced not least by the great success of the Bodensee-Oberschwaben-Bahn, launched under municipal management in 1993. Connections with this railway have also been considered, such as through services from Weingarten or Baienfurt to Friedrichshafen. However, reactivating the former tramway route would essentially require complete reconstruction and would thus be costly. Only the short section along the former three-rail track could be used for such a project, but formally it has also been decommissioned since 1999.\n\n\n== Miscellaneous ==\nParts of the power supply system that were no longer needed after the tramway was discontinued were sold to the Austrian Montafonerbahn. As a result, in 1965, they were able to increase the traction voltage of their Bludenz-Schruns railway line from 720 to 900 volts DC. However, since 1972, they have been using the alternating current system common in the Austrian Federal Railways, with a voltage of 15 kV and a frequency of 16⅔ Hz. Consequently, the equipment from Germany became redundant once again.\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBergsteiner, Leonhard (2008). \"Bundes-Straßenbahn – Die Strecke Ravensburg–Weingarten–Baienfurt\".

It is the cultural and religious center of the area's Louisiana Creole people, predominantly of French descent.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe chapel is located on LA 119 near the Atahoe Plantation on the banks of the Cane River south of Natchez, Louisiana.\nLike nearby Old River and Bayou Brevelle, the Cane River was once the Red River, a major trade route for early colonists and Native Americans.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe chapel was founded by French Creole families in the 1900s as a mission of St. Augustine Catholic Parish Church of Isle Brevelle. During this period, St. Augustine Catholic Parish Church founded 3 other missions: St. Anne Church (Spanish Lake) (serving the Adai Caddo Indians of Louisiana), St. Joseph's Catholic Mission at Bayou Derbonne, and St. Anne Chapel at Old River.\nNotable Creole founding and patron families include Rachal, Longlois, Lacaze, Metoyer and Brevelle. The mission was initially under the Roman Catholic Diocese of Natchitoches, which is now part of the Diocese of Alexandria.\n\n\n== St. Augustine Historical Society ==\nThe building is owned by the St. Augustine Catholic Church and has been given for use to the St. Augustine Historical Society. \n\n\n== Notable People ==\nJean Baptiste Brevelle (1698-1754), early 18th century explorer, trader and soldier of Fort Saint Jean Baptiste des Natchitoches. Father of the namesake of Isle Brevelle.\n\n\n== See also ==\nRoman Catholic Diocese of Alexandria in Louisiana\nSt. Genevieve Catholic Church of Brouillette\n\n\n== References ==",

He studied under Professor Jameson at Edinburgh, where he graduated M.D. in 1815, his thesis being ‘Disceptatio … de mutationibus quas ea, quæ e terra gignuntur, aëri inferent,’ Edinb. 1815, 8vo, pp. 26, at which time he was annual president of the Royal Society of Medicine in that city. He wrote several papers, chiefly on geological subjects, his last being on the respiration of plants in the ‘Edinburgh Philosophical Journal’ for 1821. The date of his death has not been ascertained, but, as he was a frequent essayist until that year, he probably died either then or very shortly after. He was a member of the Geological Society before its incorporation.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Jackson, Benjamin Daydon (1890). \"Hall Gilby, William\".

The station is available in Cornwall through DAB, as well as online. \nFounded by Richard Woods, Shaun Ford and Jamie Reed, online test transmissions for Rewind Radio began during England's 2021 COVID-19 lockdown, with the station launching on 7 October 2021. The station's presenting team includes local presenters Victoria Leigh, Matt Rogers and Gavin Marshall. From April 2024 Rewind Radio will be the only local commercial radio station to serve the county following Bauer Media Audio UK's decision to merge Pirate FM with its national Greatest Hits Radio network.\nIn November 2023, Jamie Reed announced his departure from Rewind Radio due to health reasons. Also in November 2023, the station appointed Paul Fenton as its national sales director, and he took up the post on 1 December. In March 2024, Rewind Radio's managing director, Richard Woods, and commercial director Martin Saulsbury met local MPs George Eustace and Derek Thomas at Westminster as part of their campaign to make FM radio available throughout Cornwall, with both MPs giving their support to a county-wide FM frequency for local output. On 2 April 2024, the station will launch a new weekday breakfast show presented by Josh Cornow and Laura Mac.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

Singerella along with the other volvate species.\n\n\n== Description ==\nConocybe volviradicata is a small brown volvate mushroom.\nCap: 1.5cm wide and conical to campanulate. The surface is cinnamon to sienna brown but dries to a buff or yellowish cream colour. It is smooth and silky with a striate margin. The flesh is thin and up to 1mm in the centre. Gills: Almost free, crowded and pale ochre. Stem: 3cm long and 3mm thick with a cream colour surface and distinct striations running to the start of the volva. The base of the stem has a volva and a rooting base that is up to 2cm long. Spore print: ochre to cinnamon brown. Spores: 8-10 x 6-7 μm. Hexagonal with a distinct germ pore and thick wall. Sienna brown.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe specific epithet volviradicata is named in reference to the volvate, rooting stipe.\n\n\n== Habitat and distribution ==\nThe specimens studied by Watling, Işıloğlu and Sermenlı were found growing on manured soil on the border of a vegetable garden in Southwest Turkey.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Elsa Mazzetti (28 February 1937 – 20 March 2024), better known as Cocky Mazzetti, was an Italian pop singer, mainly successful in the 1960s.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nBorn in Milan, Mazzetti studied piano and singing and made her official debut in 1955, with the group Menestrelli del Jazz ('Minstrels of Jazz'), with whom she toured in Spain, Turkey, Egypt and Lebanon. In the late 1950s she adopted the stage name Cocky, which was the name of her poodle. She had her first hit in 1961 with \"Pepito\", an Italian-language cover of Los Machucambos' song. \nIn the following years Mazzetti took part in some of the most important musical events in Italy, including four editions of the Sanremo Music Festival, where in 1963 she got her major hit with Pino Donaggio's twist song \"Giovane giovane\", the  Festival di Napoli, where in 1962 she ranked third with \"Nuttata 'e luna\", the Cantagiro, the \nFestival delle Rose and the \nItalian Song Festival of Zurich. Her success declined in the second half of the 1960s. \nIn the early 1980s Mazzetti was part of the group Oldies, together with Nicola Arigliano, Wilma De Angelis, Ernesto Bonino and Claudio Celli. Between late 1990s and early 2000s she was a recurring guest in Paolo Limiti's RAI nostalgia-themed music TV-shows. Mazzetti died on 20 March 2024, at the age of 87.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCocky Mazzetti discography at Discogs \nCocky Mazzetti at IMDb",

        "content": "Herbert John Giraud (14 April 1817 – 12 January 1888) was an English physician, chemist, and botanist.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nGiraud was the second son and youngest child of John Thomas Giraud (1764–1836), a surgeon at Faversham, Kent (mayor in 1814), by Mary, daughter of William Chapman of Badlesmere Court, Kent. He was born at Faversham on 14 April 1817. His grandfather, Francis Frederick Giraud (1726–1811), was born of Waldensian Protestant refugee parents at Pinache in Würtemberg in 1726, and was brought to England by his uncle, the Rev. William Henry Giraud, vicar of Graveney, Kent, in 1736, entered at All Souls, Oxford, in 1744, was ordained in 1749, and was from 1762 to 1808 head-master of the Faversham grammar school. Herbert John Giraud was educated at the university of Edinburgh, where he graduated M.D. with honours in 1840. Entering the medical service of the East India Company in 1842, he became successively professor of chemistry and botany (in 1845) and principal of the Grant Medical College, Bombay; he was also chief medical officer of Sir Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy's Hospital, chemical analyst to the Bombay government, surgeon-major and deputy-inspector-general of the Bombay army medical service, and dean of the faculty of medicine in Bombay University (1863). He died 12 January 1888 at Shanklin, Isle of Wight, where he had lived since his retirement in 1867. He married in 1842 Christina, daughter of Dr. David Shaw of the Bombay medical service, by whom he had two daughters, the elder of whom married Major-general Harpur of the Bombay staff corps. A list of ten botanical and chemical papers by Giraud is given in the Royal Society's ‘Catalogue of Scientific Papers,’ vol. ii. The most valuable of the botanical papers is on the embryo of Tropæolum, ‘Linnean Transactions,’ xix. 161. Several of the chemical papers relate to toxicology in India. Giraud was often consulted as an expert in medico-legal cases in the Bombay presidency.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Bettany, George Thomas (1890). \"Giraud, Herbert John\".

        "content": "Dorothy Banks (née Alford, 1865 – 1937) was an English naturalist and shell-collector who was one of the originators of Hergest Croft Garden, Kington.\nShe was born in 1865 to clergyman Bradley Hurt Alford and his wife Caroline, née Lyall, and raised in London. Her older sister was the classicist Margaret Alford.\nLike Margaret, Dorothy attended Girton College, Cambridge, where she gained a first in the Natural Sciences tripos in 1885–8. Her Director of Studies was conchologist Alfred Hands Cooke, and she worked and corresponded with William Bateson, John Read le Brockton Tomlin and Thomas McKenny Hughes. She received no degree, and in 1887 collected signatures for a petition for Cambridge to allow full university membership to women so that they could gain degrees.\nIn 1893, she married her course-mate, the banker and plant photographer William Hartland Banks. They had a son, Richard Alford (Dick) Banks (b. 1902), and three daughters.\n\n\n== Hergest Croft ==\nIn 1895, William and Dorothy built Hergest Croft and personally designed its gardens. Dorothy’s plant knowledge and interest in the Arts and Crafts movement are detectable in the project.\n\n\n== Collection ==\nDorothy was a collector of shells, minerals and fossils since the age of fifteen. Her collection, spanning from the 1870s to 1929 and comprising 900 species of British and foreign shells, is held at Hergest Croft.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2024 Chelyabinsk Oblast gubernatorial election will take place on 8 September 2024, on common election day. Incumbent Governor Aleksey Teksler is eligible to run to a second term in office.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn March 2019 first-term Governor of Chelyabinsk Oblast Boris Dubrovsky announced his resignation and was replaced by First Deputy Minister of Energy Aleksey Teksler. Teksler was previously viewed as the likely replacement for Governor of Murmansk Oblast Marina Kovtun, who resigned two days after Teksler's appointment to Chelyabinsk Oblast. Dubrovsky's resignation was expected as in August 2018 he was indicted for conspiracy by the Federal Antimonopoly Service, Dubrovsky later fled Russia and was charged with abuse of power in October 2019.\nTeksler ran for a full term as an Independent and handily won the September 2019 election with 69.30% of the vote, as his nearest challenger, Konstantin Natsiyevsky (CPRF), received just 12.02%. In June 2020 Governor Teksler joined United Russia party, and later this year led the party list in the Legislative Assembly of Chelyabinsk Oblast election.\n\n\n== Candidates ==\nIn Chelyabinsk Oblast candidates for Governor can be nominated by registered political parties or by self-nomination. Candidate for Governor of Chelyabinsk Oblast should be a Russian citizen and at least 30 years old. Candidates for Governor should not have a foreign citizenship or residence permit. Each candidate in order to be registered is required to collect at least 7% of signatures of members and heads of municipalities. In addition, self-nominated candidates should collect 0.5% of signatures of Chelyabinsk Oblast residents. Also gubernatorial candidates present 3 candidacies to the Federation Council and election winner later appoints one of the presented candidates.\n\n\n=== Publicly expressed interest ===\nAleksey Teksler (United Russia), incumbent Governor of Chelyabinsk Oblast (2019–present)\n\n\n=== Potential ===\nValery Gartung (SR–ZP), Member of State Duma (1997–present), Chairman of the Duma Committee on Safeguarding Competition (2021–present), 2000 gubernatorial candidate\n\n\n== See also ==\n2024 Russian regional elections\n\n\n== References ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Carrow Works is a former factory site in Norwich previously owned by condiment manufacturer Colman's. The site covers 40 acres, and several of the buildings within its bounds are Grade II listed, as well as the Grade I listed Carrow Abbey. In production for 165 years, the site has been referred to as \"historic\" due to its impact on the industry and character of Norwich.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1146, Stephen, King of England granted land in Carrow (then known as Carhowe) to the nuns of the Church of St Mary and St John for the founding of a Benedictine priory. At a point between 1503 and 1535, Isobell Wygun, its penultimate prioress, built a new house for herself, substantially reworking the priory's west range. However, after the dissolution of the monasteries, the priory largely fell into ruin, apart from the prioress' house which had been given to Sir John Shelton by Henry VIII. It came to be known as Carrow Abbey, changing ownership several times before being acquired by a Norwich surgeon, Philip Martineau, in 1811.\n\n\n=== Use by J & J Colman Ltd ===\nLand to the north of the Carrow Abbey estate was purchased from the Norfolk Railway Company by J & J Colman Ltd in 1850, and the business began to move from its former mill at Stoke Holy Cross. Jeremiah James Colman, the son of the business' founder Jeremiah Colman, was influential in the expansion of the business here following his joining of the partnership in 1851. At one point from 1854 to 1856 a mustard mill was erected at the site beginning an official movement onto the site; it is now demolished. Later, flour and starch mills, granaries, warehouses and workshops, and a counting house in 1857, were built. JJ Colman finished building a family home on the site in 1861, and in 1862 the move from the Stoke mill was fully finished.\nJ & J Colman Ltd acquired further adjacent land in the late 19th century, including the Carrow estate from the Martineau family, and more factory buildings were built, with several being rebuilt after a large fire in 1881. The roof of one of the blocks was replaced after being damaged during World War II, and metal bridges and chutes were added between the buildings during the 20th century. All four blocks that made up the factory seemingly closed during the 1990s.\n\n\n=== Closures and redevelopment plans ===\nOn 15 December 2017, co-owner of the site Britvic confirmed that it would close its operations at the Norwich factory, where it produced Robinsons and Fruit Shoot drinks, instead moving to Rugby, east London and Leeds. At the time, Britvic employed 249 people at the site. Unilever, which owns Colman's, had already stated that it may close its own operations if Britvic left the site. Modular building construction company Beattie Passive then moved into the site, though the company filed a notice of administration in March 2024 and halted production.\nIn January 2018 Unilever also announced it would end Colman's production in the factory, which at the time employed 113 people, instead moving to factories in Burton-on-Trent and Germany; this was further confirmed in March of that year. On 24 July 2019 the final jars of mustard were produced by the factory; their best before dates were replaced with \"Norwich's Last. By Its Finest. July 24th 2019\", and they were gifted to the employees at the site. On 22 May 2020, the site closed, ending over 160 years of production by Colman's in the city.\nIn August 2023, details were revealed about a new housing development proposed for the site that would have included the building of 1,859 properties, including 143 houses plus business and community space. The plans were expected to cost £460 million. These plans were scrapped in March 2024 by Norwich City Council, which cited a breakdown in communications with developers Fuel Properties and concerns over the project's environmental impact.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Conocybe anthuriae is a species of mushroom-producing fungus in the family Bolbitiaceae.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIt was described in 1997 by the Scottish mycologist Roy Watling and the Austrian mycologist Anton Hausknecht who classified it as Conocybe anthuriae.\nIt is notable as being one of the few Conocybe species which has a volva and subsequently was placed in Conocybe sect. Singerella along with the other volvate species.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nConocybe anthuriae is a small brown volvate mushroom.\nCap: 0.6-1.5cm wide and up to 1cm high starting campanulate to convex and not expanding much with age. The surface is hygrophanous and brown but becomes paler or dirty yellow-orange in the centre with a yellowish white colour at the cap margins. It is smooth and lacking in striations when young but is radially sulcate when older with a pubescent coating when dry. Gills: Adnate, distant and pale cream coloured becoming pale yellowish brown with age. Slightly ventricose. Stem: 1.5-3cm long and 1-1.5mm thick tapering up from a bulbous base of up to 3mm wide. The surface is white to cream, not darkening with age and has a pruinose to pubescent coating with a striate texture. The volva is distinct, white and membranous with an uneven margin that is slightly denticulate. Spores: 10.5-13 x 7-8.3 μm. Ellipsoid with a prominent germ pore that measures 1-1.5 μm and a thick wall of up to 1.5 μm. The spores are yellow in water turning dark reddish brown in KOH with a wine red wall. Basidia: 18-25 x 10-14 μm. 4 spored with clamp connections.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe specific epithet anthuriae is in reference to the cultivated Anthurium plants that the species was found growing with.\n\n\n== Habitat and distribution ==\nThe specimens studied by Watling and Hausknecht were found in Mauritius where they were growing in an open glass house on an Anthurium plantation in soil mixed with composted sugar cane.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Roman Science: Origins, Development, and Influence to the Later Middle Ages is a book by science historian William Harris Stahl, published in 1962 by University of Wisconsin Press.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThis book: 12–23  covers the history of science in the Latin-speaking  West from its Greek origins to the time of the Graeco-Arabic revival, focusing on the influence of Greek science in the Latin world, and on how this influence shaped both scientific education and scientific culture all the way to the Middle Ages. The volume follows what the author calls \"the handbooks movement\", the production of encyclopedic material originating with Greek authors, such as Posidonius and Theon of Smyrna, and follows this tradition among the Romans. Stahl devotes specific chapters to Pliny, Solinus, Chalcidius, Macrobius, Capella, Boethius, Cassiodorus, Isidore, Bede, and other authors till about 1250, and discusses the genesis and subsequent development of the liberal arts in the Quadrivium and Trivium from the age of Plato (428–424 BC) and Isocrates (436–338 BC) till the Middle Ages and Renaissance.\n\n\n== Content ==\nThe initial section on \"Classical Greek Origins\" treats the discoveries of Aristarchus of Samos, Pythagora, the Sophists Hippias of Elis and  Isocrates, Plato, the mathematician Eudoxus – credited with the invention of the Method of exhaustion – \nand Aristotle. The mathematicians Euclid, Archimedes, Apollonius of Perga and Hipparchus are described in the section of the early Ellenistic tradition, together with the early botanist Theophrastus who headed the Peripatetic school after Aristotle, and Eratosthenes of Cyrenes. The first section of the work of Stahl ends with a chapter entitled \"The Posidonian Age\", from Posidonius (c. 135-51 BC) that marks the period when a Greek, mostly Stoic tradition, opens a \"lengthy period of mutual admiration\": 45   between the Greek and Roman intellectuals. The chapter tells how histrian Polybius and the Stoic philosopher Panaetius were invited to the Scipionic Circle and of the friendship between Posidonius and Cicero. Though no work of Posidonius has reached us, his writings were used extensively by Cicero in his works, and influenced later authors such as Marcus Aurelius and  Seneca.: 47   \nAuthors treated in the central section of Roman science, beside Pliny, include Cato the Elder, Cicero, Varro, Lucretius, Pomponius Mela, Vitruvius, Celsus, and Lucius Annaeus Seneca. Marcus Agrippa has a special mention for his approach of measuring the  length and breadth of each province of the Roman Empire by computing distances recorded on the milestones on the imperial highways. \nNicomachus and Apuleius are treated in the chapter on the second century AD, while Latin neoplatonist encyclopedists Solinus, Calcidius, Macrobius, and Martianus Capella are treated in the chapter on Third- and Fourth-Century Cosmography.\nThe last part of the volume describes the short period of Ostrogothic renaissance, with Boethius and Cassiodorus, then moves to Isidore of Seville and Bede, and concludes with the 12th century and the School of Chartres. From the twelfth century onward, Latin translations of Arabic and Greek works were to revolutionise the intellectual life of Western Europe and diminish the predominance of the Latin encyclopedists.  \nThe themes treated in the volume were anticipated in an article of the same title that Stahl published in 1959 in the journal Isis.\nThe author is critical of the way Roman authors treated quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, music and astronomy) – but also geography – in their handbooks. Stahl faults the Romans and their handbooks for the low scientific level, the mechanical borrowing from one author to the next, the absence of new ideas, and the instrumental use of referencing – authors citing primary sources they had not read, and not acknowledging the secondary sources they had read instead.\nThe fact that any of these handbooks, Greek or Latin, quotes an original source cannot be taken for evidence that the compiler was himself acquainted with that source, as the quotations could have come from intermediate works.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nOtto E. Neugebauer faults Stahl for ignoring relevant elements of Roman science: the Roman calendar, the agrimensores, and authors such as Manilius and Firmicus Maternus. He is also critical of Dahl's expansive use of the term \"handbook\" to cover a plurality of different types of works. \nFuntowicz and Ravetz read in the work of Stahl a warning of how \"science is an ongoing process, and not tables of enshrined truths\". Thus science can degenerate to the banality and plagiarism denounced by Stahl if deprived of the stimulus of new research.: 58 \nFor Abraham Wasserstein, the merit of Stahl's work is that it provides a \"history and aetiology of a great failure\" of Roman civilization – that of not building on the  foundations laid by their Hellenic predecessors, thus failing \"the great task imposed upon them by history: to continue, develop, or at least transmit faithfully the inheritance of Greek science\".\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Palatinate language island on the Lower Rhine is an area to the west of the Lower Rhine where since the mid-18th century a Rhenish Franconian dialect has been spoken, brought into the then-Prussian territory by settlers originating from the Palatinate region. Because the Protestants did not mix with the local Catholic population for a long time, their distinct dialect has remained partly preserved.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe language island is located in the far west of Germany to the west of the Lower Rhine towards the Dutch border, on the Lower Rhine Heights between the cities of Goch, Kalkar, and Kleve.\n\n\n== Terminology ==\nThe adjective \"Palatine\" is not regional (historical Palatinate or present-day Palatinate), but rather linguistic. The dialect, later called by the residents of the region \"Pälzersch\", belongs to the dialects spoken 300 km south in the Nahe-Hunsrück area in the middle of Rhineland-Palatinate and is classified by linguistics into the West Palatine dialect group within the Palatinate dialect and within the Rhenish Franconian.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nIn May 1741, the Palatine settlers intended to emigrate to the North American colony of Pennsylvania via Rotterdam. They were a larger group from the Palatinate upper bailiwicks of Kreuznach on the Nahe River and Simmern in the Hunsrück region (both cities are now located in Rhineland-Palatinate). They attempted to escape the poor economic conditions in their homeland.\nHowever, due to the War of Jenkins' Ear, not all prospective emigrants received passage to America. The Dutch border posts were instructed to only allow immigrants into the country who could prove passage to North America. For this reason, the Palatine emigrant group was detained at the Dutch border fortress of Schenkenschanz (now in North Rhine-Westphalia). Negotiations with an English ship captain failed because the emigrants deemed the price too high and refused to accept it.\nThe Rhine boatmen, who were supposed to transport the emigrant group further to Rotterdam, were not ok with their ships being stuck at the Prussian-Dutch border and demanded payment. The settlers subsequently occupied the ships and only released them after receiving an eviction order from the Kleve War and Domain Chamber.\n\nAfterward, 20 families comprising approximately 120 individuals decided to forego emigration and requested settlement land in the region. Their request was forwarded to the Prussian magistrates and judges of Emmerich, Goch, Huissen, and Kleve. The city of Goch possessed the Goch Heath, a 10,000-acre area, which had been gifted to them in 1458 by Arnold von Egmond, Duke of Geldern. This land was made available to the Palatines, who referred to themselves as \"Pfälzer\". It was only about 250 km away from their homeland.\nIn the following years, the emigrants struggled with initial financial difficulties, leading to repeated expulsions. Therefore, they submitted a petition to King Frederick the Great. On 30 April 1743, Frederick instructed the Kleve War and Domain Chamber and the Goch Magistrate in a special decree to support this community.\n\n\n=== Community Foundations ===\n\n\n=== Pfalzdorf ===\n\nThe settlement area in Goch Heath was named Pfalzdorf in 1749. After the initial successes of the colonists, the Prussian authorities became interested in further immigration. Until 1771, additional families settled there, almost exclusively from the Hunsrück region. After that, the heathland was almost completely allocated.\nThe lease agreement for the settlement sites did not allow for sale or division; therefore, many offspring saw re-emigration as the only way out. The first wave of emigration went to Bönninghardt near Sonsbeck, Königshardt near Oberhausen, Asperheide near Goch,  and to Pfalzdorf, Plaggenburg, and Dietrichsfeld in East Frisia.\n\n\n=== Louisendorf ===\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, the settlement space in East Frisia was used up, but there was still a need to expand. Therefore, a settlement of the Kalkar Forest was proposed. On 30 September 1820, Friedrich Wilhelm III signed an order making the establishment of the colony legally binding. At the request of the colonists, the new settlement was to be named Louisendorf after Queen Louise.\n\n\n=== Neulouisendorf ===\nSince not all willing settlers could be accommodated in the settlement of Louisendorf, another forest area was considered in 1826. On 31 December 1827, King Friedrich Wilhelm signed the order for the foundation of Neulouisendorf. On 4 June 1832, the portions were assigned, and settlement began. Contrary to the plan to be an extension of the Louisendorf settlement, Neulouisendorf became an independent community.\n\n\n=== Consolidation ===\n\nIn Pfalzdorf, a Reformed church was already inaugurated in 1775, and a Lutheran church on 29 October 1779. On 11 September 1811, the inauguration of a Catholic church followed. This expansion of infrastructure, which also facilitated the practice of religion for incoming Catholics, contributed to a largely autonomous community.\nLouisendorf belonged to the Amt Till. However, its own Evangelical parish was established, and its Elizabeth Church was inaugurated on 13 November 1861.\nNeulouisendorf was part of the city of Kalkar. Here too, its own Evangelical parish was established. The Evangelical church in Neulouisendorf was inaugurated on 7 June 1898.\nWith the first municipal reorganization program in North Rhine-Westphalia on 1 July 1969, Pfalzdorf became a district of Goch, and Louisendorf belonged to the part of the Amt Till that was incorporated into Bedburg-Hau.\n\n\n== Independence ==\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe Protestant denomination separated the \"Palatines\" from the Catholic surrounding area. There were hardly any interfaith marriages, so traditional \"Palatine\" family names, such as Puff, Hans, Saueressig, Imig, and Thomas, have been preserved. Elements of tradition were also passed down, such as the practice of mentioning the surname before the first name (thus, Imig Fritz and not Fritz Imig). Furthermore, Catholic customs widespread in the Lower Rhine were not adopted.\n\n\n=== Language ===\nDue to settling in close quarters, the \"Palatines\" became a minority group that nurtured and developed their own dialect. This was encouraged by the aforementioned marriage policies and by the establishment of their own elementary schools, which existed until the 1940s. Originally, the settlers exhibited linguistic peculiarities stemming from their different regional origins: Bad Kreuznach and Simmern are about 35 km apart and separated by the 650 m high Soonwald; Simmern belongs more to the Moselle Franconian, while Kreuznach to the Rhenish Franconian linguistic area. In the settlement area, both dialects gradually merged into a general dialect known as \"Pälzersch,\" which also incorporated features of the surrounding Low Franconian or Ripuarian dialects. Presently, \"Pälzersch\" is still regularly spoken by older residents. The younger population typically switches to Standard German upon starting school and loses their dialect competence. Therefore, the preservation of \"Pälzersch\" is threatened. Jakob Imig was a dialect poet and local historian, after whom the Jakob Imig Archive in Louisendorf, based on his collection, is named. The LVR Institute for Regional Studies and History in Bonn also refers to him as \"the most well-known Palatine\" from the Lower Rhine Palatinate language island.\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nEmil Böhmer, Sprach- und Gründungsgeschichte der pfälzischen Colonie am Niederrhein (Dissertation), Marburg 1909.\nPeter Honnen, Cornelia Forstreuter, Sprachinseln im Rheinland : Eine Dokumentation des Pfälzer Dialekts am unteren Rhein und des „Hötter Platts“ in Düsseldorf-Gerresheim, in Rheinische Mundarten 7, Köln 1994, ISBN 3-7927-1456-6.\nBarbara Mott, Pfälzer am Niederrhein : Die Geschichte der Pfälzersiedlungen Pfalzdorf, Louisendorf und Neulouisendorf im Rahmen der preußischen Binnenkolonisation des 18 und 19 Jahrhunderts, Völkersche Buchdruckerei und Buchhandlung, 1989.\nRené Schiering, Zur Dokumentation des Pälzersch in Pfalzdorf, Louisendorf und Neulouisendorf (Niederrhein) : Bericht eines zweiwöchigen Feldforschungsaufenthaltes, in GBS Bulletin 10, 2004.\n\n\n== Reference list ==",

        "content": "NGC 5953 is a peculiar spiral galaxy in the constellation Serpens. The galaxy lies about 80 million light years away from Earth, which means, given its apparent dimensions, that NGC 5953 is approximately 35,000 light years across. It was discovered by William Herschel on April 17, 1784. NGC 5953 interacts with NGC 5954 forming a pair known as Arp 91.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\nNGC 5953 is an unbarred spiral galaxy seen face on with many dust lanes. Two tidal plumes are visible, one to the northwest and one to the south of the galaxy. The spiral arms are flocculent and appear fragmented and are associated with star formation regions. \nThe galaxy has recently undergone intense star formation in the circumnuclear region around the nucleus where there are huge HII regions, probably as a result of its interaction with NGC 5954. The large HII region has been found to emit radio waves, appearing as a discrete source 5 arcseconds from the nucleus. A circumnuclear star ring with a diameter of 10–14 arcseconds is visible, which coincides with a disk of CO gas.  Based on near infrared observations the ring hosts a red giant but not hot gas. The total star formation rate of the galaxy is estimated to be 2.56 ± 0.1 M☉ per year.\n\n\n=== Active nucleus ===\nThe nucleus of the galaxy has been found to be active and it is categorised as a type 2 Seyfert galaxy or as a LINER. The most accepted theory for the energy source of active galactic nuclei is the presence of an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole. The black hole in the nucleus of NGC 5953 is estimated to have a mass of 7×106 M☉ based on velocity dispersion.\nA jet is visible to the north of the nucleus in radio waves extending for 0.3 arcseconds, which corresponds to a projected distance of 40 parsecs in the distance of the galaxy.\n\n\n== Nearby galaxies ==\nNGC 5953 forms a pair with another spiral galaxy, NGC 5954, which lies 43 arcminutes away. The interaction has distorted NGC 5954. The pair is part of the NGC 5962 group or LGG 400. Other members of the group, apart from NGC 5962, include UGC 9925 and UGC 9951. A bit further away lie NGC 5951, NGC 5956, and NGC 5957.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nNGC 5953 on WikiSky: DSS2, SDSS, GALEX, IRAS, Hydrogen α, X-Ray, Astrophoto, Sky Map, Articles and images",

        "content": "Donaustauf Palace (German: Schloss Donaustauf) was a summer residence of the princes of Thurn und Taxis in Donaustauf, Bavaria in Germany. The palace was destroyed during a fire in 1880. Today, only the gardens with a Chinese teahouse remain.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1812, Karl Alexander, 5th Prince of Thurn and Taxis (1770-1827) acquired a monastery building, which formerly belonged to the Prince-Bishopric of Regensburg. Between 1817 and 1819, this building was transformed into a princely summer palace overlooking the Danube river.\nUnder the 6th prince, Maximilian Karl von Thurn and Taxis (1802-1871), who married to Princess Mathilde Sophie of Oettingen-Oettingen and Oettingen-Spielberg (1816-1886) in 1839, the palace became the preferred summer residence as they were drawn to the romantic scenery of the Danube valley. Seven of their twelve children were born at the Donaustauf palace.\nBetween 1829/1830 and 1841/1842, the palace was rebuilt to mark the construction of the Walhalla (memorial), whose foundation was laid in 1830 and inaugured in 1842. After completion, the palace counted a total of 112 rooms. Various ancillary buildings were erected between 1831 and 1832, such as the stables and a riding hall.\nA neogothic rebuilding of the palace was considered in 1843, but did not materialize. Only the designs by Ludwig Voltz remain, the architect responsible for the neogothic renovation of the other princely summer residence, Schloss Taxis.\nOn 4 March 1880, the palace and many other buildings on the Danube banks in Donaustauf became victim of a large fire. Afterwards, the palace was not reconstructed. Princess Mathilde started to use Schloss Neueglofsheim in Thalmassing as her summer residence.\nToday, the princely gardens including a Chinese teahouse (constructed in 1842) and the forestry office belong to the small reminders of the princely palace in Donaustauf. In addition, the head of the princely house of Thurn and Taxis still bears the title 'Duke of Wörth and Donaustauf', which was bestowed to them by the King of Bavaria in 1899.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Literature ==\nDallmeier, Martin (1995). \"Der Markt Donaustauf und das fürstliche Haus Thum und Taxis im 19.

        "content": "The Johann Strauss Theater in Wieden, part of Vienna, Austria, was built in 1908 especially for operettas. It had a hall for 1,200 spectators in Baroque Revival style. After many successful world premieres such as Die Csárdásfürstin, played more than 500 times, it was demolished in 1960.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Johann Strauss Theater was built at Favoritenstraße 8 in Wieden in 1908 when Viennese operetta was highly successful. The architect Eduard Prandl built a theatre dedicated to operetta for 1,200 spectators in Baroque Revival style. It was opened on 30 October 1908 with 1001 Nacht, an arrangement of Indigo und die vierzig Räuber by Johann Strauss, made after he died.\nThe world premiere of Emmerich Kálmán's Die Csárdásfürstin in 1915 was followed by more than 500 performances. Alexander Girardi starred in Kálmáns Der Zigeunerprimas, premiered in 1912. In 1925, Lehár's Paganini was first performed. Josephine Baker appeared in her revue Schwarz auf weiß in March 1928.\nThe theatre faced financial problems due to the Great Depression in 1929 and the growing attraction of sound film. Therefore the architect Carl Witzmann transformed the house into a cinema for 1,400 people in 1931. Named Scala, it was opened on 30 September 1931. It was also used for Varieté performances.\nBetween 1948 and 1956, when the dirtict was under Soviet occupation, the hous was used for drama theatre in ambitious staging, such as with Karl Paryla and Therese Giehse in Brecht plays, but the Vienna press ignored them for political reasons.\nAfter Soviet occupation, the house existed only for a short time; the last performance was held on 30 June 1956. It was demolished in 1959/60.\n\n\n== World premieres ==\nSeveral operettas were first performed at the theatre:\n\nBub oder Mädel, by Bruno Granichstaedten, 13 November 1908\nDas Fürstenkind, by Franz Lehár, 7 October 1909\nDer Zigeunerprimas,  by Emmerich Kálmán, 11 October 1912\nDer Nachtschnellzug, by Leo Fall, 20 December 1913\nDas dumme Herz, by Carl Michael Ziehrer, 27 February 1914\nRund um die Liebe, by Oscar Straus, 9 November 1914\nDie Csárdásfürstin, by Kálmán, 17 November 1915\nDie Faschingsfee, by Kálmán, 21 September 1917\nDas Hollandweibchen, by Kálmán, 30 January 1920\nEine Sommernacht, by Robert Stolz, 23 December 1921\nBajazzos Abenteuer, by Michael Krasznay-Krausz, 1923\nEin Märchen aus Florenz, by Ralph Benatzky, 14 September 1923\nPaganini, by Lehár, 30 October 1925\nEvelyne, by Bruno Granichstaedten, 6 January 1928\nDas Veilchen vom Montmartre, by Kálmán, 21 March 1930\nDer süßeste Schwindel der Welt, by Stolz, 21 December 1937\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nDieter Klein, Martin Kupf, Robert Schediwy: Stadtbildverluste Wien.

        "content": "Péter Magyar (Hungarian: [ˈpeːtɛr ˈmɒɟɒr]; born 16 March 1981) is a Hungarian politician and lawyer.\nMagyar garnered media attention when, on 15 March 2024, he announced his intention to found a party, offering an alternative to what he believed to be an \"artificial divide\" between the parliamentary opposition and Fidesz–KDNP, the governing coalition of Hungary. He further released an audio recording which he claims proves collusion between the Prosecutor's Office and high level government officials, and which he recorded after his ex-wife, the then justice minister, told him that the government of Hungary is a mafia state.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nMagyar was born in Budapest. He is a former member of the ruling Fidesz party.\nHe met Judit Varga in on 1 April 2005 at a party. He proposed to her in August 2006. They have three sons; their first child, a son named Levente, was born in 2008. The family lived in Brussels for several years before returning to Budapest when Varga was tapped for a position in the Ministry of Justice. The couple announced their divorce in March 2023. \nHis family is prominent in Hungarian politics, including a judge and a former president. His grandfather, Pál Erőss, was a judge who hosted a popular television program about legal matters. His great uncle, Ferenc Mádl, served as President of Hungary from 2000 to 2005, and his mother worked in the judicial branch.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nPrior to entering politics in a local chapter of Fidesz, at the time an opposition party, Magyar participated in the pro bono legal representation as well as assistance for anti-government activists during the 2006 protests in Hungary. His earlier role in Fidesz has been variously described as \"powerful insider\" and \"former official\". After Fidesz took power in the 2010 Hungarian parliamentary election, he was appointed as an official in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. A year later, coinciding with the Hungarian EU presidency, he also joined the Permanent Representation of Hungary to the European Union. In 2015, he became employed by the Prime Minister's Office. In September 2018, he took over the management of the EU Legal Directorate of the state-owned MFB. Between 2019 and 2024, he was the head of the Student Loan Center.\nMagyar first came to prominence for his criticism of government politicians after the Katalin Novák presidential pardon scandal. In early February 2024, it was revealed that the president of Hungary, Katalin Novák, had granted a presidential pardon in April 2023 to Endre Kónya, the deputy director of a state-run children's home near Budapest. The deputy had coerced children into covering up sexual abuse by his superior, János Vásárhelyi, the home's director. The scandal resulted in anti-government protests demanding that Novák resign; she did so on 10 February 2024. The same day, Magyar's ex-wife Judit Varga, the former justice minister who had countersigned the pardon, also announced her resignation from the National Assembly and her role leading the Fidesz party list in the June 2024 European Parliament election.\nHours after his ex-wife's announcement of her withdrawal from politics, Magyar published a Facebook post declaring that he would be resigning from his positions in two state-owned enterprises and relinquishing his seat on the board of a third, MBH Bank. He wrote that the past few years had made him realize that the idea of a \"national, sovereign, bourgeois Hungary\" stated as the goal of Viktor Orbán's rule was in fact a \"political product\" serving to obscure massive corruption and transfers of wealth to those with the right connections.\nIn the following weeks, Magyar conducted a number of interviews with Hungary's most-read independent news organizations including Partizán, Telex.hu, and 444.hu, in which he extensively criticized the government, particularly Minister of the Prime Minister's Cabinet Office Antal Rogán. He claimed that during his tenure at the head of the national student loan provider, he had been forced to favor those close to Orbán in public invitations to tender and pressured on aspects of his divorce. His first interview, in which he claimed that \"a few families own half the country,\" had been viewed more than two million times as of March 2024.\nMagyar continued publishing posts critical of figures associated with the government in the subsequent days, claiming that people friendly with or related to the prime minister, like his son-in-law István Tiborcz, had amassed enormous wealth hidden behind domestic private equity funds. On 15 March 2024, he held a rally attended by tens of thousands in Budapest at which he announced the formation of a new political party. According to polling conducted that month, around 13 percent of voters claimed they were \"certain or highly likely\" to vote for Magyar if he ran for office. \nOn 6 April 2024, Magyar organised a second demonstration against the government, citing what he calls a \"feudalistic system\" that needs dismantling, with hundreds of thousands of protesters attending. The government supported Megafon think-tank spent 117 million HUF on ad campaign against Magyar on Facebook in the weeks leading up to the rally.\n\n\n== Evidence in Schadl-Völner case ==\nOn 20 March 2024, Magyar testified for several hours at the Metropolitan Prosecutor's Office regarding the high-profile corruption case involving bribes President of the Court Bailiffs György Schadl paid to former Secretary of State for Justice Pál Völner. Shortly after his testimony, he announced in front of the press that he had proof in the form of audio recordings that Antal Rogán or his associates had manipulated documents in the case in order to hide evidence that would have incriminated Rogán. In a Facebook post a few days later, he promised to make the recordings public at 9 AM on 26 March 2024, the date of his next appointment to testify and present the evidence to the prosecutors. He stated that once this happened, Chief Prosecutor Péter Polt as well as the entire Orbán Government would have no choice but to resign.\n\nOn 26 March 2024, Magyar released the recording to the public. It contains a two-minute discussion between himself and his ex-wife Judit Varga about the Schadl-Völner corruption case. Varga's comments implicate Cabinet Minister Antal Rogán in tampering with evidence by having his and/or his associates' names removed from documents associated with the case. He has turned the recording over to prosecutors.\n\n\n== Domestic abuse allegations ==\nThe same day that Magyar leaked the recording on which she discusses Rogán's role in the Schadl-Völner case, Judit Varga published two posts on Facebook alleging that Magyar had verbally and physically abused her throughout their marriage. She also claimed that the statements she made on the leaked recording had been coerced during an interaction with Magyar in which she felt threatened. Later that evening, the YouTube channel Frizbi TV released an interview with Varga in which she went into more detail about her allegations, including that at various times Magyar had locked her in a room without her consent, pushed her against a door while she was pregnant, and walked around their shared residence brandishing a knife and once he faked suicide, but when the ambulance arrived, he drove off in his pyjamas and Varga had to send the medics off. Magyar classified the accusations as slander and claimed that his ex-wife was being blackmailed from the government. According to him, the government media only wanted to divert attention from the audio recording. However official police reports and close colleagues of Varga confirmed that Magyar often showed aggressive and intimidating behaviour towards his wife and children.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Péter Magyar at Wikimedia Commons",

All 39 members of Castle Point Borough Council in Essex will be elected following boundary changes.\n\n\n== Background ==\nCastle Point was a traditionally Conservative council. The Conservative controlled the council from 1976 until 1995, when the Labour Party won a majority. The Conservatives retook control in 2003. This majority lasted until 2022 (aside from a period of no overall control from 2014 to 2015), when the council again fell into no overall control.\nIn the most recent election, the People's Independent Party gained 6 seats with 35.4% of the vote, the Canvey Island Independent Party held the 6 seats they were defending with 20.2%, and the Conservatives lost 6 with 28.5%. Following the election, the CIIP and PIP formed a majority coalition.\n\n\n== Boundary changes ==\nCastle Point usually elects its councillors in thirds, on a 4-year cycle. However, following boundary changes, all councillors will be elected to the new wards. The change reduces the number of councillors by 2. The electoral system is due to change to whole council elections every 4 years following a vote by the council.\n\n\n== Previous council composition ==\n\nChanges:\n\nDecember 2023: John Payne (CIIP) dies\nMarch 2024: Godfrey Isaacs leaves Conservatives to sit as an independent\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n== Candidates ==\nThe Statement of Persons Nominated, which details the candidates standing in each ward, was released by Castle Point Borough Council following the close of nomination on 8 April 2024. Thirteen of the thirty-five Conservative nominations were rejected as invalid. An asterisk denotes an incumbent councillor seeking re-election.\n\n\n=== Appleton ===\n\n\n=== Canvey Island Central ===\n\n\n=== Canvey Island East ===\n\n\n=== Canvey Island North ===\n\n\n=== Canvey Island South ===\n\n\n=== Canvey Island Winter Gardens ===\n\n\n=== Hadleigh St James ===\n\n\n=== St George's ===\n\n\n=== St Mary's ===\n\n\n=== St Michael's ===\n\n\n=== Tarpots ===\n\n\n=== Thundersley North ===\n\n\n=== Thundersley South ===\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The thousand legs house (Indonesian: Rumah kaki seribu) is the traditional house of the Arfak people who reside in Manokwari Regency, West Papua.\nThe house is dubbed \"Thousand Legs\" because it uses many supporting poles underneath, so when seen, it has many legs like a millipede. Meanwhile, its roof is made of straw or sago leaves. The poles are made from tall and short-sized wood. The function of these wooden poles is to protect the dwellers from enemy attacks and black magic threats. The thousand legs house is of the stilt house type and has a typical Manokwari pattern. In the local language, this house is called Mod Aki Aksa in the Meyah language, Igkojei by the Wamesa tribe, Igmam in the Hattam language, Tu Misen in the Sougb language).\nThe thousand legs house is mostly inhabited by residents living in mountainous areas with cold weather. This house is built tall to avoid attacks from wild animals. It also does not have windows, which are intended to keep the temperature inside the house warm.\nThe thousand-legged house is Arfak's ancestral heritage. Its construction is based on the philosophy of the local lifestyle, so the house can only be found in the Arfak Mountains Regency and its surroundings.\n\n\n== Form ==\n\nThe thousand legs house generally has dimensions of 8 x 6 meters. The height of the platform measured from the ground is around 1 - 1.5 meters. The peak roof height ranges from 4.5 to 5 meters. The pillars are made of wood with a diameter of 10 cm. The foundation pillars of the house are very close together, spaced about 30 cm apart. The floor and walls are made of widened pieces of wood tightly tied together and wrapped with smaller wooden poles. As for the roof, it is made of straw/grass or sago leaves tied to supports, which are also made of wood. The connections of the wooden pillars, floor, walls, and roof are tied using rattan fiber and wood bark fiber to give a strong and natural impression.\nBecause the house does not have windows, the only way to create air circulation is through the doors. The house has two doors which are the front door and the back door. The house's interior is not divided into rooms like modern houses but into two sections. The left side is for women (ngimsi), while the right side is for men (ngimdi). Inside, there is also a fireplace to warm the room. Like other traditional stilt houses, the thousand legs house is usually inhabited by several families living together inside.\nFor the Arfak community, the thousand legs house serves as a shelter, a place to educate children, and a venue for festivities. There are gaps in the floor that allow air to enter the house, ensuring good air circulation. Inside, there is a spacious space under the house used as a livestock pen. In a specific area, there is a room designated for ceremonies and traditional celebrations. In the central part of the house, the floor is not covered with wood, so if there's a dance party, it can be done on the ground. However, the presence of such traditional houses is rarely found nowadays because many villagers prefer to build modern houses made of concrete floors, brick walls, zinc roofs, and equipped with windows.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

All species are from Central America or South America.\nAn overview of the taxonomy was provided by Medrano et al. (2024)\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe genus Poecilaemula was described by Roewer, 1912 with the type species Poecilaemula signata (Banks, 1909). The South American species require further revision to re-assess their taxonomic placement.\n\n\n== Species ==\nThese species belong to the genus Poecilaemula:\n\nPoecilaemula eutypa (Chamberlin, 1925) – Panama\nPoecilaemula iching Medrano, Kury, Martins & Proud, 2024 – Panama\nPoecilaemula lavarrei Goodnight & Goodnight, 1942 – Guyana\nPoecilaemula metatarsalis Roewer, 1915 – Venezuela\nPoecilaemula moniliata Roewer, 1928 – Ecuador\nPoecilaemula peruviana Roewer, 1947 – Peru\nPoecilaemula signata (Banks, 1909) – Costa Rica\nPoecilaemula smaragdula Mello-Leitão, 1941 – Brazil (Espírito Santo)\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe genus is feminine. Genus name derives from a misspelling of pre-existing genus Paecilaema + feminine form of Latin suffix -ulus.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Poecilaemula at Wikimedia Commons\n Data related to Poecilaemula at Wikispecies",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Natsuko Tanihara (谷原菜摘子)(born 1989) was born in Saitama Prefecture, Japan. She completed her BFA and graduate studies in oil painting at the Kyoto City University of Arts. From 2017 to 2018, she received a grant from the former Gotoh Memorial Foundation and stayed in Paris, France. After returning to Japan, she went back to school for her PhD in Fine Arts. She is the recipient of numerous domestic awards and continues her production based in the Kansai region. She works in various mediums but is known for her signature works using velvet as a support and her use of decorative materials such as glitter, sequin and rhinestones.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nTanihara has garnered various awards and accolades throughout the years. The following is not exhaustive.\nIn 2015, as a student at the Kyoto City University of Arts, she won the Koji Kinutani Award, the prize was established to promote figurative painters under the age of 35 by Mainichi Shimbun to support young painters. She participated in the VOCA, Vision of Contemporary Art Exhibition in 2016. The show is held every year at the Ueno Royal Museum where young artists under the age of 40 are picked up by museum curators. She won the Shoreisho, the second place prize. She received the Gotoh Memorial Cultural Award's Newcomer's Prize of Art in 2017 and spent one year in Paris on a grant from the Former Gotoh Memorial Culture Foundation. In 2017, she received the Best Young Artist Award given by the City of Kyoto. In 2020, Tanihara has participated in the ARKO Artists in Residence in Kurashiki, Ohara. This Ohara Museum of Art program supports young artists by offering them the use of the studio of Torajiro Kojima, a Yōga style painter. The museum is the first private museum focused on western art in Japan and was established in 1930 by Magosaburo Ohara. She was introduced in the Japanese television program Break Zenya in October, 2020. The BS Fuji television program introduces young artists. In 2021, the City of Osaka presented Tanihara with the Sakuya Konohana Award. The award is given to promising young artists who have contributed to the development of the culture of Osaka City.\n\n\n== Artistic Style ==\nTanihara has experimented with various materials throughout her life. As an elementary school student, she would often grind glass, eggshells or seashells that she found and would collage them into her pastel drawings. In an interview with Sankei Shimbun, Tanihara relates a story about how she began to use velvet as a support instead of canvas. She had entered university to study Nihonga style painting because she loved the work of Iwasa Matabei but left the department after half a year and switched to the Yōga, western style painting, department. After switching departments, she says that she didn't like traditional white canvas because she felt her brush “wouldn’t move” the way she wanted. After hearing that the American Abstract Expressionist Julian Schnabel painted on velvet, she experimented with the material and has continued using it ever since.In interviews with other various publications, she has said that her expression focuses on the dark legacy of humanity but presented through the aesthetic prism of decorative beautification. She often mixes mica, glitter, rhinestones and sequin into her paints and collages other decorative materials into her works. After her year-long grant-supported travels in Europe, she has experimented with works on paper using pastels. While she had used pastels on paper for studies for her larger velvet works, she began to work in earnest on her drawings on paper because she did not have a studio space during her time in Europe.In an interview conducted upon receiving the Sakuya Konohana Award from the City of Osaka, she explains that her works spring from narratives of her own creation. She postulates that narrative creation has been central to artistic creation and cites the example of scroll works from the late Heian period such as Stories of Hungry Ghosts. She argues that the narrative behind these works were most likely imagined by people to help them rationalize the unfair phenomenon that beset them.\n\n\n== Influences ==\nIn her interview with Sankei Shimbun, she notes a formative memory from kindergarten when she saw Claude Monet’s painting of Camille on her deathbed. She felt “goosebumps and could really feel that the woman depicted was dying.” Feeling the potential of the medium of painting, she thought one day she would become an artist. Although she dreamt of being an artist, she was discouraged by her peers and teachers, as well as her father. Only her mother supported her dream to become an artist.Due to her mother's illness, as a child she was often sent to her mother's hometown in rural Aomori where she had the opportunity to see and wear Japanese kimono. In an interview she did when she won the Sakuya Konohana Award from City of Osaka, she said has strong memories of being scared of the darkness of her grandparent's home, exacerbated by the fact that her grandparents would go to sleep around 7PM. The interviewer Noriko Ishibashi connects the decorative materiality of Tanihara's works to her exposure to kimono and her interest in the Royal French and Imperial Chinese ornamentations.As a junior high school student, she moved to Hokkaido from her birthplace in Saitama due to her father's work where she was bullied and experienced a serious injury. In an interview with the Japanese Art magazine, Bijutsu Techo, she notes that this experience created a desire in her to reveal the “darkness of human beings.” She explains that although modernization has brought a sterilizing light that seems reveals all, through her works she insists that there is still a “dreadful darkness that exists.”The writer, Masaki Toshikazu, suggests that her brief experience in the Nihonga department of Kyoto University and her initial interest in Nihonga can be found in many of the Japanese motifs in her work.Her time in Europe was spent going to many museums. She said she prioritized “looking more than painting” as she travelled around to various places in Europe like France, Germany, Switzerland, Poland, and Belgium to visit museums and galleries. In her interview with Bijutsu Techo, Tanihara notes that she was particularly interested in contrast between highly detailed figures and distorted spaces in the works of Northern Renaissance artists. She singles out Bathesheba at her Bath by Rembrandt as making a strong impression on her as well as the works of Grünewald, Jan van Eyck and Hans Memling. She felt stylistically validated observing firsthand the violence in many of these works and gained a renewed sense of confidence in the direction of her chosen subject matter. Her interaction with European art on this trip allowed her to choose her motifs more freely. Many of her works prior to her trip to Europe had Japanese settings, but after her trip, she began to experiment with new settings such as supermarkets, meadows, and restrooms; and new depictions of people outside of her personal circle. Also her time in Europe led to an increase in production of works on paper due to her lack of studio space.In more recent years she said that she has been deeply inspired by the intensity of video works of artists such as Pierre Huyghe and Matthew Barney.\n\n\n== Critical Reception ==\nNakai Yasuyuki, chief curator at the National Museum of Art, Osaka, positions Tanahara as a “Modern Ukiyo-e Painter” as indicated by the title of his essay for one of Tanihara's solo shows at MEM Gallery in Tokyo. For Nakai, Iwase Matabei is one of the formative figures in the history of Ukiyo-e paintings, arguing that from the medium's inception its subject matter has focused on the macabre as evidenced in Iwasa's magnum opus The Tale of Yamanaka Tokiwa, a depiction of the “masochistic act of recreating the cruel murder of his own mother.” Nakai does a comparative analysis of Iwasa and Tanihara, whose works “are [spun] together from painful memories [experienced] by the artist.” While ukiyo-e genre images from later periods such as the peaceful Edo period typically depict “scenes of young men and women enjoying themselves,” Nakai argues that Tanihara is the “true successor” to “the spirit of Iwasa Matabei” whose works are “imbued with a shadow of death.”\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Constantin Zablovschi  (16 July 1882, in Czernowitz – 3 May 1967, in Bucharest) was a Romanian engineer and pioneer in the field of telecommunications.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nZablovschi studied at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering in Charlottenburg, Berlin, which was part of the Technical University of Berlin, Berlin, and obtained the title of Doctor of Engineering. Upon returning to Romania, he dedicated his career to the development of radio communications, becoming one of the first specialists in this field in the country. He contributed to the establishment of the first radio stations and the development of the national radiocommunication network. Zablovschi was involved in the establishment and development of the Romanian Radio Broadcasting Company. He was also involved in various projects and experiments related to radiocommunications, including establishing the first transcontinental radio links between Romania and other countries.\nIn the 1930s, Zablovschi achieved a remarkable feat in the field of telecommunications by establishing a transatlantic radio link between Bucharest and New York. Utilizing modern radio technology of the time, Zablovschi oversaw the design and implementation of sophisticated antenna systems, coordinated radio frequencies, and optimized signal strength and quality over vast distances. He died in 1967 in Bucharest, aged 84. A street in the city's Sector 1 is named after him.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Karim Kimvuidi (born 13 March 2002) is a Congolese footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder or winger for Orlando Pirates in the South African Premier Division.\nHe was named in DR Congo's squad for the 2020 African Nations Championship, played in 2021, and featured in one game.\nAfter several years in Daring Club Motema Pembe, he went to South African club Maritzburg United in 2022. Kimvuidi was an outstanding player for Maritzburg United, but the club was relegated from the 2022-23 South African Premier Division. As such, the club had several offers for their best players, and Kimvuidi transferred to Orlando Pirates in July 2023. He made his Bucs debut in September 2023 against Mamelodi Sundowns. He played regularly, but did not establish himself as a starter yet.\n\n\n== References ==",

It is an alternative to the method described by Bernstein, Greene and Kruskal , as it first solves the Vlasov equations for the species involved and only in a second step Poisson's equation to ensure self-consistency. The S method is generally considered the preferred method because it is best suited to describing the immense variety of electrostatic structures, including their phase velocities. These structures, also known under Bernstein–Greene–Kruskal modes or phase space electron and ion holes, or double layers, respectively, are ubiquitously found in collisionless plasmas such as in the Earth's magnetosphere, in fusion machines, or in the laboratory.\nWith the S method, the distribution functions for electrons \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          f\n          \n            e\n          \n        \n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        v\n        )\n        =\n        \n          F\n          \n            e\n          \n        \n        (\n        \n          ϵ\n          \n            e\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          σ\n          \n            e\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f_{e}(x,v)=F_{e}(\\epsilon _{e},\\sigma _{e})}\n  \n and ions \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          f\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        u\n        )\n        =\n        \n          F\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        (\n        \n          ϵ\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          σ\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f_{i}(x,u)=F_{i}(\\epsilon _{i},\\sigma _{i})}\n  \n, which solve the corresponding Vlasov equation, are described as functions of the constants of motion.

This statement  contradicts Landau's theory for corresponding linear single waves.\n\n\n=== Negative wave energy holes - anomalous transport ===\nThe energy of a structured plasma associated with these nonlinear waves can typically be negative. These negative energy holes therefore act as attractors in this dynamical system, providing an abundance of secondary wave excitations that contribute to anomalous resistivity and heating in intermittent turbulence and anomalous transport,,.\n\n\n=== Extensions ===\nBased on the S method, various extensions have been presented in the past.\nIn   a generalization to relativistic electrons and the inclusion of magnetic field effects were presented. The structures, observed ubiquitously in circular particle accelerators and storage rings, could be explained in   by use of the S method considering the focusing property of wall impedances. Quantum corrections of holes, investigated by  , revealed the tendency to bring this extreme non-equilibrium state closer to thermodynamic equilibrium, an effect that is due to the tunneling of particles through the potential barrier. Finally  dealt with the nonlinear shielding of planar test charges and pointed out the important role of particle trapping.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The U.S. Congressional Research Service produces approximately annually a report with the title Instances of Use of United States Armed Forces Abroad, 1798-xxxx, where \"xxxx\" is the final year of data presented. Until 2018, these reports were not available to the public. Since 2018, the CRS has been publishing new ones on their website, as well as making some previous ones available. Several other outlets have been acquiring and publishing the reports as well.\nThe Bowdoin College Library provides a list of eight online collections of CRS reports. The most complete collections are in three commercial databases that require a paid subscription for access. The other five are available for free. In each of those five, searches were performed on March 26, 2024 based on two report numbers known to have been used for the report and based on the title. The table below lists the results of successful searches.\nIn the results of those searches, the report appears with four different report numbers (column \"ID\" of table below): RL30172 (2004 and earlier), RL32170 (2004 to 2010), R41677 (2011), and R42738 (2012 and later).\n\n\n== Structure of the table ==\nIn the table, a single quotation mark in a cell is the ditto mark, indicating the value is the same as that of the cell above it.\nThe columns of the table below have the following meanings:\n\nDate: Publication date stated in the source listing.\nDate note: In the HSDL listing, some of the dates are prefaced with \"Updated\". If so, that word is given here.\nID: Report number, if stated in the source listing.\nVersion: The version history on the CRS website states version numbers of the reports, which are given here. Those version numbers do not appear in the reports.\nEnd: All report titles given in the source listings have the form, Instances of Use of United States Armed Forces Abroad, 1798-xxxx, where \"xxxx\" is the year indicated here.\nSource:\nCRS R42738 (17 reports): Version history of the report from the CRS.\nUNT 42738 (7): Search in the University of North Texas (UNT) Digital Library for CRS reports with \"42738\" in the metadata.\nUNT 32170 (6): Search in the UNT Digital Library for CRS reports with \"32170\" in the metadata.\nUNT title (19): Search in the UNT Digital Library for CRS reports with \"Instances of Use of United States Armed Forces Abroad\" in the title. These include the 13 results of searching by report numbers, plus six additional reports. The listing does not state the report numbers.\nHSDL title (20): Search in the Homeland Security Digital Library for items with \"Instances of Use of United States Armed Forces Abroad\" in the title.\nEveryCRS title (4): Search at EveryCRSReport.com for \"Instances of Use of United States Armed Forces Abroad\".\nAWC: The two reports with this source code were not results of database searches, but were found separately. They were published by the Air War College of the United States Air Force on a now-defunct website that remains accessible via the Internet Archive. In the table, this source code is linked to a listing that includes the report or directly to the report itself if no listing is known that includes it.\n\n\n== Table of revisions and sources ==\nIn the table, there are five sets of rows with all data the same except for different version numbers stated by the CRS, to wit, {41, 40, 39} (2023), {38, 37, 36, 35} (2022), {34, 33, 32} (2021), {31, 30} (2020), and {23, 21} (2018). Inspection of versions 41, 40, and 39 found no differences, including the version numbers, which do not appear to be stated in the reports. To an inquiry submitted online about the differences, the Library of Congress, of which the CRS is a division, reported being unable to answer the question.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of notable deployments of U.S. military forces overseas, which is based on the primary contents of this report, version 41, June 7, 2023.\n\n\n== References ==",

Upon the death of Gaspare Borgetti, the property was inherited by his son Giuseppe, who pursued a military career and became Major General in 1893. It is highly likely that the villa was named after his wife, Luisa Cotta Ramusino. Later on, the property was purchased in 1974 by the Industrial Association of Canavese, and after the completion of some renovation works, it became its headquarters in 1977.\nIn 2020, the façades of building were subject to some renovation works.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe villa is located on Corso Costantino Nigra, opposite Palazzo Ravera, with its northern side rising on a cliff above the Dora Baltea, between the Ponte Vecchio and the Ponte Nuovo. The property borders to the south the garden of Villa Ravera and to the west the church of San Grato Vescovo. The villa has two entrances: a main one on Corso Costantino Nigra, preceded by a tree-lined garden, and a secondary one on Vicolo Giordano, accessible from the nearby Borghetto.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Villa Luisa (Ivrea) at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "Ihor Volodymyrovych Hordiichuk (Ukrainian: І́гор Володи́мирович Гордійчу́к; born 12 November 1972) is a Ukrainian military officer who is posthumously awarded the Hero of Ukraine and Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky in 2014. He is also known by his nickname Sumrak or Gordey. Hordiichuk gained notoriety in August 2014 when, for 12 days, he commanded special troops and, accompanied by his scouts, he successfully repelled several Russian attacks from Savur-Mohyla in Donetsk Oblast.\n\n\n== Education ==\nBorn on 12 November 1972, in the Ukrainian village of Zaliznytsia. Hordiichuk attended the Omsk Higher Tank Engineering School from 1989 to 1991, and graduated from the Hetman Petro Sahaidachnyi National Ground Forces Academy in 1994. He completed four months of classes in Canada to meet the STANAG 6001 (2008) level for minimal English proficiency for personnel. At the College of the United States Army in Carlisle, he further enhanced his military understanding. He received an honors diploma from the United States Army War College in 2008, and the National Defense Academy of Ukraine in 2002.\n\n\n== Military career ==\nAfter graduating in 1994, Hordiichuk began his military service in the Khmelnytsky region's city of Iziaslav with the 161st Mechanized Brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. He held several positions in the mechanized forces: deputy commander of a mechanized battalion, commander of a separate tank battalion, commander of a tank line battalion, reconnaissance platoon, and mechanized company.\nCaptain Hordiichuk first served as the deputy commander of a brigade in 2002, and then as the commander of the 8th Special Forces Regiment from 2003 to 2008. He was part of the multinational contingent stationed in the Afghanistan from May to December 2010. He worked in the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and in Defense Intelligence in April 2014.\n\n\n=== Battle in Shakhtarsk Raion ===\n\nThroughout the war in Donbas, Colonel Hordiichuk participated in several operations inside the ATO zone. Leading a Special Forces unit, he oversaw the capture of the Savur-Mohyla strategic point while carrying out operations in the enemy's rear. Following the capture of the hill and the installation of the observation station, Russian artillery spotters completely shut off all Ukrainian military transportation in the \"D\" sector.\n\nOn 12 August 2014, the 14-man scout group Krym of Hordiichuk broke into the hill's positions, gained possession of the hilltop observation post, and started carrying out combat duties including as spotting artillery fire. Russian tanks, separatists, and artillery were used in large quantities to defeat the Ukrainian unit. Due to enemy artillery attacks, communication channels were rendered inoperable. While communication was not very effective, cell phone communication was feasible in certain parts of the hill.\nHeavy artillery was directing its concentrated fire towards the Hordiichuk's group. Almost every day, the enemy's soldiers attempted to storm the hill. Although the scouts' lives were spared by bunkers, they suffered serious contusions from explosions that left the military crippled. Hordiichuk himself was also often scolded, yet he remained in his role. There were generally only firearms and grenade launchers available, although occasionally artillery assistance was used to repel day attacks. Six attempts were made by separatists to take Savur-Mohyla by night. The defenders of the hill survived many close-quarters assaults.\nColonel Peter Potekhin led a party of volunteer reconnaissance officers that came to assist on 18 August. The 25th Airborne Brigade consists of these seven soldiers. Colonel Hordiichuk received assistance from a number of additional volunteers who joined the group. These included combatants from the 4th Company of the 42nd Territorial Defence Battalion in the Kirovohrad Oblast, who were commanded by Lieutenant Colonel O. Melnychenko, artillery adjusters, infantry fighting vehicles from the 28th Mechanized Brigade, and armoured personnel carrier from the 3rd Separate Special Purpose Regiment arrived with brand-new communication apparatus.\nFollowing the arrival of the reinforcement, Hordiichuk rotated; the Krym group withdrew. With his hand injured, he remained on the hill, carried out combat duties, and kept the enemy informed of his whereabouts. The order to leave the hill was received on the evening of 24 August. By then, it was evident that the hill was surrounded tightly. Russian separatists rendered inoperable the vehicle of the 3rd Separate Special Purpose Regiment, which had broken through it to transfer the injured personnel.\nHordiichuk issued the order to leave Savur-Mohyla at night of 25 August. After 12 days and nights of nonstop fighting, the Ukrainian scouts departed from the hill that had been excavated by shells. They were able to sneak around 60 kilometres (37 mi) past the enemy's line and join Ukrainian forces close to Mnohopillia. Scouts set out to make a breakthrough in an attempt to escape the encirclement on 29 August, accompanied by all forces from Ukraine.\nWhen Hordiychuk and Sergeant Serhii Stehar were moving on the truck, artillery and mortar fire started, causing a body explosion and setting the automobile on fire. The escorts were unable to approach because of the enemy's heavy fire; Hordiichuk managed to escape on his own. Without a helmet, a bullet fragment ripped a chunk of bone from his skull on the back of his head, injuring him. After ripping off the bandage and attempting to lead the battle, the colonel passed out from blood loss. Russian paratroopers seized Hordiychuk, Stegar, and numerous more combatants. He was left behind when the detainees were hauled away, and it was forbidden to assist him because they said he would die very soon. After lying on the battlefield for two days, he was discovered by Red Cross workers, who took him immediately to the Mechnikov Clinical Regional Hospital.\n\n\n=== Rehabilitation ===\nColonel Hordiichuk, paralyzed and suffering from the worst kind of traumatic brain injury, was brought unconscious to the Mechnikov Clinical Regional Hospital in Dnepropetrovsk and subsequently to the National Military Medical Clinical Center in Kyiv. A horrific head wound not only caused paralysis (hemiparesis) but also a blood infection (sepsis). He suffered from a dangerously elevated body temperature for several weeks, which was only alleviated by being placed in a medical coma and not by medication.\nHordiichuk regained consciousness, but his left arm and leg were totally paralyzed, and he lost control of his body. At the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in the United States, Colonel Hordiichuk received the expert care he sorely needed. Here, he learnt to move again despite the excruciating pain under the tight supervision of qualified rehabilitation specialists. Although the American rehabilitation program was successful, complete healing remained a long way off.\nHordiichuk had many operations and therapy in the United States and Ukraine after the injury. His recuperation was aided by the expert work of American rehabilitologists at first, and currently by specialists from the Institute of Vertebrology and Rehabilitation's Kyiv Center for Strengthening the Spine and Joints. His family had to deal with the challenge of carrying out the challenging reconstruction process once they returned to Ukraine. There are no dedicated veteran's rehabilitation programs in our nation, so his only option was to attend classes at sanatoriums and public hospitals. Experts offered their services at no cost to assist him in living a full life again.\n\n\n=== Later career ===\nColonel Hordiichuk successfully completed all of the tests of luck, undertook a number of difficult and protracted treatment courses, and in April 2016, he rejoined the ranks. Furthermore, as per the directive from the Minister of Defense Stepan Poltorak, he was named Ivan Bohun Military High School during his recuperation. Hordiichuk would be in charge of the high school from 26 April 2016 to 3 October 2023. His dismissal was referred to as treason and disrespect on the online community in response to this decision. On 7 November, he was moved to the position of deputy head of the National Defence University of Ukraine. He held a private conversation with Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umierov during their meeting.\nIn a 2018 interview, Hordiichuk stated that his primary adversaries are deceit, bribery, and corruption in addition to being set an example for and eliminating the traditional ways. A statue honoring Russian commander Alexander Suvorov was taken down from the courtyard of the IvanIvan Bohun Military High School in January 2019 at the behest of the institution's chief, Major General Hordiichuk, and the cadet community. He became the director general of the National Museum of the Revolution of Dignity (Maidan Museum). He stated in a 2023 interview:\n\nI am proud to have been one of the few officers who convinced everyone in uniform, the Armed Forces, that we should be with the people. We realized that this was a difficult path, but we had no alternative. If there had been no Maidan, I am not sure if we would have been able to survive. We are grateful to our military, they are doing the hardest work – the victory depends on the girls and boys on the front line\n\n\n== Advocacy ==\nHordiichuk advocates for gender parity in the armed forces. He claims that his female pupils are extremely driven and serving as role models for others. Like all military personnel, he values discipline. In his opinion, winning the Russo-Ukrainian war requires a comprehensive strategy. It is imperative to have a robust army, as well as information resistance, a thriving economy, and the preservation of Ukrainian language and culture. He claims that this is being done to make sure that the nation's integrity won't be compromised by the adversary.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nHordiichuk refers to his mother Sofia Rodionivna as a rule intelligentsia, who enjoyed such power among her fellow peasants that she presided over them for more than 30 years. Volodymyr Oleksandrovych is his father. Inspired by his uncle, his mother's brother, he began dreaming of a military career as a future Hero of Ukraine from an early age. A professional soldier, he visited his sister annually and inspired his nephew to enlist in the military with his life experiences.\nHe married Tetiana Hordiichuk after becoming a lieutenant on 9 May 1994, and saw the birth of his daughter Martha two years later. Tetiana Hordiichuk, a senior soldier, is employed with the General Staff in the communication division. Martha, the daughter, is a student at the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv studying English and Spanish in Western European Philology.\n\n\n== Honours and awards ==\n\nColonel Hordiichuk was granted the title of Hero of Ukraine of the Golden Star on 21 October 2014, as per a decree issued by the President of Ukraine. This was in recognition of his extraordinary bravery and heroism in safeguarding the territorial integrity and state sovereignty of Ukraine, as well as his fidelity to the oath of allegiance. The military title of Major general was conferred to him on 23 August 2016. The next day, at the parade on Khreshchatyk celebrating Ukraine's 25th anniversary of independence, President Petro Poroshenko gave the major general shoulder marks.\nBobanych has received honours and recognitions such as:\n\n Hero of Ukraine Order of the Gold Star (21 October 2014)\n Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky Second Class (29 September 2014)\n Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky Third Class (8 September 2014)\n Dignity and Honour Commendation\n 10 Years of Armed Forces Medal\n 15 Years of Armed Forces Medal\n Wound Medal (29 August 2019)\nWarrior-Peacemaker Badge\nHonorary Citizen of the Khmelnytskyi (20 September 2017)\nOrder of Merit in the Fight against Fascism in Russia (22 June 2017)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

He competed on the Vanderbilt University varsity team while studying for an engineering degree, then moved to North Carolina for work at the beginning of the 1980s and joined the Olde Originals club, which he went on to captain.\nDickson featured twice in capped matches for the United States, debuting in a draw against Japan in 1986, before travelling to Australia with the national team for the 1987 Rugby World Cup. His only appearance in the tournament came against the Wallabies and he had to leave the field with a badly broken arm that left bone sticking out of his skin.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of United States national rugby union players\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDave Dickson at ESPNscrum",

        "content": "United States Forces in the Philippines (USFIP) is a unified command in the Philippines during World War II. It was the successor to the United States Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE) which General Douglas MacArthur commanded. He moved to Australia as he evacuated as ordered by President Roosevelt in March 1942. The command only lasted two months as it surrendered by Lieutenant General Jonathan M. Wainwright to Lieutenant General Homma Masaharu commander of 14th Army of the Imperial Japanese Army.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nIn February 1942 as Japanese tighten its grip with the Philippine Islands and the situation getting critical and desperate. Supplies could not reach Bataan due to the intensified naval blockade of Imperial Japanese Navy. President Franklin Roosevelt ordered General MacArthur to relocate to Australia in preparation for a build up for an offensive operations against Japan.\nMacArthur intended to still control the Filipino–American forces in the Philippines from Australia through his Deputy Chief of Staff in Corregidor Island. He reorganized his and designed it as an independent from each other for an eventuality one unit surrenders the others can still continue to fight. Apparently Washington, D.C was not informed of this ahead by MacArthur.\n\n\n=== Reorganization ===\nMacArthur selected his G4 Supply Colonel Lewis Beebe to remained in Corregidor to act as his deputy Chief of Staff, to issue orders for MacArthur's behalf and managing the supply in Malinta Tunnel. Harbor Defense of Manila and Subic under Major General George F. Moore was retained but renamed as Philippine Coast Artillery Command, with its headquarters in Fort Mills, Corregidor. North Luzon Force and South Luzon Force which are now located in the same location in Bataan Peninsula is now known as Luzon Force under Wainwright with CPY in Mariveles, Bataan. Visayas-Mindanao Force is split into Mindanao Force still with Major General William F. Sharp with its current CPY in Del Monte Field and the new Visayan Force will be under Brigadier General Bradford Chynoweth the commander of 61st Infantry Division in Panay Island with CPY in Cebu. These took effect after MacArthur's departure for Australia on March 16, 1942, from Del Monte Field in Mindanao.\n\n\n=== Command confusion ===\nUS War Department with understanding that Wainwright the most senior officer in the Philippines assumed the command from MacArthur sent all communications addressed to him. MacArthur failed to inform Washington, D.C., of his new setup and it created confusion. Beebe, being MacArthur's deputy chief of staff, had no choice but to relay the message of War Department to Wainwright, who was in Bataan. Wainwright assumed the command in Corregidor and made Beebe his chief of staff. Major General Edward P. King Jr was selected to replace Wainwright in Luzon Force.\n\n\n== Luzon Force ==\n\nAfter five months of fighting the troops for Luzon force on half ration and despite being battered. exhausted, hungry, and sick continued to resist and to keep the line of defense. Lack of ammunition, supplies, and food as ships sent by USAFFE could no longer reach Philippine even in Mindanao due to intensified naval activities of the Japanese Navy and air patrols.\n\n\n=== Surrender ===\nOn April 8, 1942, Major General Edward P. King Jr., with no more troops can put up a defensive line went forward together his aides Major Marshall and Hurt to Cabcaben to secure terms of surrender. He ordered all weapons and equipment destroyed except motor transports before moving forward. His surrender was accepted by Colonel Nakayama and 76,000 Filipino-American troops and 20,000 civilians move out and consolidated in Mariveles.\n\n\n=== Death March ===\n\nJapanese forced the surrendered troops to marched from Mariveles to San Fernando, Pampanga under the scorching heat from the Sun, no water and food, and sick, around 12,000 more died on road some shot or Bayoneted by their guards which is now known as Bataan Death March. From San Fernando they were box carted towards Capas, Tarlac and incarcerated at Camp O'Donnell. Thousands more died upon reaching Camp O'Donnell in Tarlac to due malaria, dehydration, and starvation as Japanese deprived the prisoners of food and water.\n\n\n== Siege of Corregidor ==\n\nHomma's focus now is to secure the island of Corregidor, he moved heavy artilleries in Bataan and Cavite. Corregidor was subject of Air and artillery barrage from King's surrender until May 6, 1942.\n\n\n=== Philippine Coast Artillery Command ===\n\nCoastal Artillery troops under Major General George F. Moore, continue to resist for a month after Bataan surrendered. Brigadier General Paul Bunker commander of the defense of Corregidor.\n\n\n=== 4th US Marine Regiment ===\n\nThe Marine regiment under Colonel Samuel Howard, USMC the regiment was pulled out from Shanghai and was attached to PCAC. The regiment was responsible for the ground defense of Corregidor Island. One of the regiments battalion was captured by the Japanese as they were all still at Shanghai when hostilities started. A provisional battalion was organized from the sailors and crew of sunk ship USS Canupos.\n\n\n== Visayan Force ==\n\nBrigadier General Bradford Chynoweth assumed command on March 16, 1942, crossing through Negros and established CPY in Camp X, Cantabaco, Cebu. He was not able to fill all his staffs as the promised from USFIP HQ to sent officers did not materialized. He absorbed he used some staffs from Cebu Brigade under Colonel Irvine Scudder. As the newest unit organized, Chynoweth commanded it for just a month. Same with other units problem on what he have, lack of heavy weapons, artillery and antiaircraft guns, ammunition, and supplies.\n\n\n=== Siege of Cebu ===\n\nOn April 9, 1942, Kawaguchi Detachment landed in Cebu, Colonel Irvine Scudder has two infantry regiments 82nd to defend southern Cebu and 83rd to defend northern Cebu. Cebu MP Regiment under Lieutenant Colonel Howard Edmands responsible for the eastern Central Cebu met Japanese landing force in Talisay but with just M2 Browning .50 Caliber Machinegun as its heaviest weapon and Japanese has Naval, Artillery, and Air support, the MPs were overwhelmed and retreated towards Busay. Troops in Toledo was not able to repulse the invading enemy force made Chynoweth and Scudder decided to evacuate Visayan Force HQ inland from Cantabaco. They retreated towards Sudlon and Tabunan. Chief Justice Jose Abad Santos was captured in Barili and was brought to Lanao when Kawaguchi landed there.\n\n\n=== Siege of Panay ===\nColonel Albert F. Christie assumed command of the Island and 61st Infantry Division, after General Bradford left for Cebu. With 63rd, 61st Provisional, and 62nd Provisional Infantry Regiments. Christie commanded a division with 8,000 troops though lack of rifles, they resorted to Bolo and Bow and Arrows. The advantage of this garrison as they prepared for 5 months in bringing food and supplies in the mountains and hills in preparation of guerilla warfare due to disadvantage of lacking fire power. When Kawamura detachment landed on April 16, 1942, Christie's troops did not resist at the beach but prepared ambuscades inland and raids to the positions at night. Christie's troops was never in critical position before it was ordered to surrender.\n\n\n== Mindanao Force ==\n\nSharp organized the defense of Mindanao into sectors to defend Japanese landings. Cagayan, Agusan, Lanao, Zamboanga, and Cotabato-Lanao sectors. Muira detachment who was already in Davao since December 20, 1941 was not able to get inland to Sayre highway. Fighting was secluded in Digos sector. If not for the air and naval support his detachment could be defeated. Sakaguchi landed in Jolo, Sulu.\nOn May 2, 1942, Kawaguchi landed in Lanao on April 28, 1942, where they are met by 61st Infantry Regiment under 81st Infantry Division of General Guy O. Fort in Malabang, Lanao and 102nd Infantry Regiment under 101st Infantry Division of General Joseph Vachon in Cotabato City and Parang in Cotabato Province and few days later Kawamura detachment landed in Macajalar Bay in Cagayan de Oro.\n\n\n== Reconstitution of Visayas-Mindanao Force ==\nOn April 19, 1942, three days after Kawaguchi Detachment landed in Cebu, Wainwright realizing the lost of Cebu and assuming Chynoweth could no longer function his command, ordered Sharp to reconstitute the Visayas-Mindanao Force and him back as commander of that unit to command the remaining garrisons of Visayas islands.\n\n\n=== Surrender of US Forces in the Philippines ===\n\nOn May 10, 1942, Wainwright went to meet Homma to discuss surrender terms of his forces in Corregidor, as Homma insisted of surrender all the forces in the Philippines or he will not accept Wainwright's surrender. He broadcast an order for Sharp to surrender and sent Lieutenant Colonel Jesse Traywick as his emissary to Sharp in Mindanao to enforce his surrender order.Sharp in turned send several emissaries to different island garrisons in the Visayas to ensure his order is carried immediately. On May 12, 1942, all forces in the southern islands surrendered. Wainwright sent Lieutenant Colonel Gailbrith to contact Colonel John Horan and Major Guillermo Nakar in northern Luzon. Colonel Horan surrendered his troops but Major Nakar refused to surrender 14th Infantry Regiment. Major General Guillermo Francisco was sent to Legaspi to stop the Constabularies for further fighting and surrendered.\nAlthough majority of USFIP surrendered many American and Filipino officers refused, went to hills and established their based and continued to fight as guerilla unit. It took a while to contact Australia or America so these men relied on the support of the Filipinos for food and money. The command cease to exist, Filipino soldiers captured where released in August 1942 while American Prisoners were moved to mainland Luzon and Palawan. Healthy ones are brought to Japan and sick one were keep on POW camps in Tarlac and Cabanatuan which were rescued in 1945 by US Army Rangers.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== See also ===\nUnited States Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE)\nLuzon Force\nVisayan Force\nMindanao Force\nVisayas-Mindanao Force\nHistory of the Philippine Army\nPhilippine Constabulary\n\n\n=== External links ===\nThere were others, unpublished papers of Colonel Hiram Tarkington, CO 61st Field Artillery\nTabunan, Personal Memoirs of Colonel Manuel A.

Originally, there were eight teams competing in the event, the teams being Indonesia, Japan, Singapore, Republic of China (Taiwan), Thailand, the Philippines, Malaya and Cambodia.\nIn the draw, Singapore was originally drawn to face Taiwan in the first round but due to political factors, the ROC delegation was refused to participate in the 1962 Asian Games by host Indonesian government. Therefore, Singapore automatically qualified for the semi-finals.\n\n\n== Schedule ==\nAll times are Western Indonesia Time (UTC+07:00)\n\n\n== Bracket ==\n\n\n== Quarter-finals ==\n\n\n=== Indonesia vs Japan ===\n\n\n=== Thailand vs Philippines ===\n\n\n=== Malaya vs Cambodia ===\n\n\n== Semi-finals ==\n\n\n=== Indonesia vs Japan ===\n\n\n=== Malaya vs Thailand ===\n\n\n== Bronze medal match ==\n\n\n=== Malaya vs Singapore ===\n\n\n== Gold medal match ==\n\n\n=== Indonesia vs Thailand ===\nThe final of the men's team event took place on 27 August 1962 with hosts Indonesia going head to head against Thailand. About 9,000 spectators came to witness the final in the Istora Senayan Indoor Stadium. In the first men's singles match, Tan Joe Hok played against a determined Charoen Wattanasin and took the first set 15–9. In the second set, Charoen fought back and won 15–10. In the decider, the Thai player, who was 14–10 up, was dissatisfied with the decision making of the umpire and linesman protested for an umpire change. When the score was 14–12, Charoen decided to retire from the match. The Thai team then made a controversial decision to withdraw from the next few matches, giving Indonesia the title.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Powdered Toast Man is the second episode of the second season of The Ren & Stimpy Show that originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on 15 August 1992.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn a parody of Superman, Powered Toast Man is a superhero who lives under the disguise of Pastor Toast Man. After receiving a message from his Catholic Schoolgirl Assistant that his help is needed, he shreds his disguise and goes to work. Invariably, his attempts to help caused more problems than what he solves. He saves a kitten from being run over by clashing an air plane into the oncoming bus; rescues the Pope who has been kidnapped by Muddy Mudskipper, helps Ren and Stimpy by making their powdered toast \"taste right\" and rips out the zipper of the fly of president of the United States with such force that the president has to be hospitalized. With the president in the hospital, Powered Toast Man takes over the duties of president and has a romantic dinner in the White House with his Catholic Schoolgirl Assistant. To keep warm, he casually tosses what he calls \"dusty old papers\" into the fireplace that are the U.S. constitution, the Bill of Rights and the Declaration of Independence.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nPowered Toast Man-voice of Gary Owens\nCatholic Schoolgirl Assistant-voice of Cheryl Chase\nThe President of the United States-voice of Jim Smith\nRen-voice of John Kricfalusi\nStimpy-voice of Billy West\nThe Pope-voice of Frank Zappa\nMuddy Mudskipper-voice of Harris Peet\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe showrunner, John Kricfalusi, had wanted to do a \"special\" episode that would feature the voice of Frank Zappa who was one of his heroes, which inspired him to write Powered Toast Man. At the time, Zappa was dying of the prostate cancer that was to kill him in 1993, and the scenes featuring his voice were recorded at his home. Unlike many of the other episodes of season two, Powered Toast Man was completed on time for its scheduled premiere in August 1992. The episode was illustrated at the Rough Draft Korea studio in Seoul.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nPowered Toast Man generated a firestorm of controversy when it aired in 1992, being widely denounced for being \"anti-American\" owing to the scene where Powdered Toast Man burns the U.S. constitution, the Bill of Rights and the Declaration of Independence. The Nickelodeon network was flooded with complaints over the \"anti-American\" episode with one woman writing in to say: \"I was so repulsed, I couldn't calm down. I was outraged when I saw that program. I want that cartoon pulled from the air because it has no social value whatsoever\". The burning scene attracted so much attention that the overtly sexualized appearance of the character known only as Catholic Schoolgirl Assistant; that it is clearly implied that Powered Toast Man is going to have sex with Catholic Schoolgirl Assistant after their romantic diner in the White House; and the scene where the Pope clings to the oversized buttocks of Powered Toast Man passed almost unnoticed. In subsequent airings, the burning scene was censored while the rest of the episode went uncensored.\nThe Irish journalist Padraig Cotter praised Powered Toast Man as the \"ultimate parody of superheroes\". Cotter wrote: \"Powdered Toast Man is a dark, but somewhat loving, parody of superheroes and comics. Despite being universally beloved within the show itself and having an ego to match, he's hilariously ill-suited to saving people. His lack of care often causes fatalities and in most cases, it would have been better if he wasn't around to save the day at all...The fact nobody within Ren And Stimpy appears to realise how awful he is becomes part of the gag\". The character of Powered Toast Man became so popular as a result of the episode that in 1993 he had a cross-over appearance in the Spider-Man comics where he faced Spider-Man.\n\n\n== Books ==\nKlickstein, Matthew; Summers, Marc (2013).

        "content": "Selago dolosa is a species of plant in the family Scrophulariaceae. It is endemic to South Africa. \n\n\n== Description ==\n\nA perennial, woody, loosely-branching shrublet. One of a group of southern African Selago species (including Selago corymbosa, Selago punctata, and Selago variicalyx) that have fascicled leaves, pubescent stems, and an inflorescence that is a corymbose panicle.\nSelago dolosa is frequently confused with the related species Selago corymbosa, but can be distinguished by the following characters: \n\nThe leaves of S. dolosa are broader (length:width ratio 2.5-7 : 1 rather than 10-24 : 1), shorter (2-7mm rather than 5-12mm), and less hairy (usually only glandular-punctate over most of their surface). The S. dolosa leaves also lack a raised midrib blow, and margins that recurve when dry.\nThe bracts of S. dolosa are also broader (0.7-1.25mm rather than 0.4-0.7mm).\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nSelago dolosa is mainly confined to the southern Cape regions of South Africa, where it occurs from near Caledon in the west, to the East London and Butterworth regions in the east.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Hamida Banu was India’s first woman wrestler. She was known for her immense strength and determination, dominating the wrestling circuits for over a decade from the time of her debut in 1937. She was also known as the ‘Amazon of Aligarh’. She challenged and won against many Indian wrestlers of the time and also participated in wrestling competitions in Europe. \nShe fought and shattered many gender and religious stereotypes, at a time when both wrestling was a taboo for women and being a Muslim woman meant you had to follow the purdah custom.\n\n\n== Early Life and Background ==\nBorn in Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh in the early 1920s, Banu was initiated into martial arts at the age of 10 by her father, a famous wrestler named Nader Pahelwan. Little else is known about Banu’s early life. \n\n\n== Wrestling Career and Notable Matches ==\nHamida Banu began her career as a wrestler at a time when most sports in India, and wrestling in particular, were male-dominated spaces. She began her training in Aligarh under a local wrestler named Salam Pahalwan.\nSince entry of women into these spaces was largely restricted, Banu resorted to wrestling male opponents, which was received with great criticism. At these matches, Hamida wore the same sports outfit, which incited protests from conservative men. Her opponents often refused to wrestle her because they felt that women were not worthy of a fight. Simultaneously, male wrestlers like Baba Pahelwan challenged her to either marry him or defeat him in a wrestling match - in an attempt to dismiss and undermine her skills as a female athlete. \nAlthough Banu succeeded in her fight against several male wrestlers, the orthodox community in Punjab refused to accept her passion for wrestling and even targeted her with insults and physical assaults. Soon after, she had no choice but to flee.\nThere were two other known cases in which the widespread perception of wrestling as a man’s sport stood in the way of Banu’s career. According to The Times of India, a bout with male wrestler Ramchandra Salunke had to be canceled because the local wrestling federation objected. There was another time when Hamida was booed and stoned by people when she defeated a male opponent, which called for police authorities to intervene.\nBanu is known to have won over 320 wrestling matches in her career which spans 1930-1950. The first wrestling match that proved to be a turning point was her 1937 face-off with Lahore wrestler Feroze Khan in Agra, where she “pinned him down” and “threw him back down with an energetic flying mare”, taking him by complete surprise.\nFollowing the now-famous ultimatum of “Beat me in a bout and I'll marry you,” In a bout held in Mumbai on May 2, 1954, Banu, then five foot three and weighing a substantial 230 pounds, defeated a prospective suitor and wrestler Baba Pahelwan in less than two minutes. An interesting anecdote about this match tells us how Chhote Gama Pahalwan, a wrestler who was patronised by the Maharajah of Baroda, was to be Hamida’s opponent but had supposedly withdrawn upon hearing of Banu’s unbelievable strength, but not before citing his refusal to fight a woman as his reason for dropping out, thus leaving the next challenger Baba Pahelwan to fight Banu. Baba Pahelwan’s defeat would be the third time she had felled a suitor since February of that year, including one Sikh (Khadag Singh) and another Hindu wrestler from West Bengal. \nSuch “mixed” matches, in which Banu vanquished male wrestlers, were always eponymous for the controversies they stirred. During a bout in Kolhapur in Maharasthra, the audience booed and even stoned Banu for defeating her male opponent, Somasingh Punjabi. The police who were deployed to control the crowds, touted the match a “farce” which aligned with the allegations prevalent at the time, of dummies being put up to challenge Banu in these “mixed” matches. These allegations had forced even then-Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Morarji Desai, to intervene and ban mixed gender matches. Nonetheless, Banu continued to fight. \nIn 1954, Banu notably defeated Russian pro-wrestler Vera Chistilin, then regarded as “female bear” within a minute in Mumbai's Vallabhbhai Patel Stadium. Later that same year, she had also wrestled Singapore’s woman wrestling champion Raja Laila, and subsequently challenged European wrestlers for a fight. \n\n\n== Post-Wrestling Life ==\nAfter the highly publicized wrestling matches in Europe, Banu disappeared from the wrestling scene. Reports suggest that Banu faced domestic violence from Salam Pahalwan, who beat her to prevent her from traveling to Europe, resulting in her hands being broken.\nShe and Salam Pahalwan were known to travel between Aligarh, Mumbai, and Kalyan for their dairy business. Eventually, Salam Pahalwan returned to Aligarh, while Banu stayed on in Kalyan. Banu resorted to selling milk, renting out buildings, and selling homemade snacks to make ends meet.\nHamida Banu died in 1986.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Corpse-like obedience (German: Kadavergehorsam, also translated as corpse obedience, cadaver-like obedience, zombie-like obedience, cadaver obedience, slavish obedience, perfect obedience, unquestioning obedience , absolute obedience or blind obedience), refers to an obedience in which the obeying person submits unreservedly and passively to another's will, like a willless cadaver.\n\n\n== Origin ==\nThe term originated with the Jesuit work by Ignatius of Loyola from 1553 (the Letter on Obedience) also dated to 1558. That text said, in Latin: \"“Et sibi quisque persuadeat, quòd qui sub Obedientia vivunt, se ferri ac regi a divina Providentia per Superiores suos sinere debent perinde, ac si cadaver essent\" which can be translated as \"We should be aware that each of those who live in obedience must allow himself to be led and guided by Divine Providence through the Superior, as if he were a dead body\". This concept, described in the Jesuit context as \"fabled and misunderstood\", has been criticised later by detractors of the Jesuit order as \"blind obedience\". Jesuit supporters, in turn, refer to it as the \"perfect obedience\".\n\n\n== Modern use ==\nThe term is often associated with Germany (where it is known as Kadavergehorsam), where it refers to \"both obedience and loyalty until death\" or simpler, just \"absolute obedience\" or \"blind obedience\". It has been associated with the discussion of German military and administration of the Prussian and Nazi eras and their passive adherence to carrying out orders, including those later judged to be war crimes (see also Prussian virtues, German militarism, Befehlsnotstand, Führerprinzip, and superior orders). Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service of 1933 has been credited with enforcing this idea in the Nazi German civil administration. The concept has been said to Adolf Eichmann, one of the major organisers of the Holocaust, invoked this concept in his defence during his post-war trial.\nThe term has also been used in the contex of other totalitarian regimes, such as communist states and parties. The concept has been described as promoted by works such as The Communist Manifesto or Mein Kampf.\nThe concept has also been mentioned in the context of extreme interpretation of military discipline.\nSome scholars have translated this term as \"zombie-like obedience\".\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "In the Army  is the first episode of the second season of The Ren & Stimpy Show that originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on 15 August 1992.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nRen and Stimpy have decided for reasons that are never explained to join the U.S. Army. At the U.S. Army Induction Center, the duo hide in shame out of the fear of seeing the naked bodies of the other recruits. After subjected to various painful tests, the duo are permitted to join the Army. In the training camp, Stimpy proves himself a good soldier willing to do whatever he is told while Ren proves himself lazy and useless. The drill sergeant constantly punishes Ren, which causes him to almost lose his mind. Ren tries to desert, but is stopped by the Sergeant who announces that for some reason both Ren and Stimpy have graduated to be Tank Paratroopers. The episode ends with Ren and Stimpy parachuting into some battlefield somewhere.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRen-voice of John Kricfalusi\nStimpy-voice of Billy West\nThe Sergeant-voice of Bob Camp\n\n\n== Production ==\nUnlike the first season where all of the episodes were directed by John Kricfalusi, in the second season with the increased workload imposed by 20 episodes, production was assigned to several directors. In practice, production for the second season was primarily divided between the \"A\" productions headed by Kricfalusi which had money and time lavished on them vs. the \"B\" productions headed by Bob Camp which had lower budges and less time. In The Army was one of the lesser \"B\" productions assigned to Camp. Camp tended to combine the process of making the storyboard phrase and the lay-outs into one, which increased the speed of production. Camp referred to himself as being \"more about the gag\", and the productions directed by him tended to be thin on plot, instead being a loose collections of gags built around a single theme, in this case Ren and Stimpy joining the U.S. Army. In The Army was finished on time for its scheduled premiere in August 1992 and slightly under budget. The episode was illustrated at the Rough Draft Korea studio in Seoul. The American journalist Thad Komorowski  wrote that In The Army was a difficult episode to illustrate because it was \"heavy on distortion\", but that the artists of Rough Draft Korea were able to complete the episode on time and in full with \"admirable deftness\".\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIn a review, the American critic Sim Basible wrote In The Army was \"fun without being particularly memorable\". Komorwski rated the episode as only two stars.\n\n\n== Books ==\nKlickstein, Matthew; Summers, Marc (2013). Slimed! An Oral History of Nickelodeon's Golden Age. London: Penguin Publishing Group.

After he returned, he played all AmaZulu's games.In late 2023 and early 2024, rumours arose that South African giants Mamelodi Sundowns and Orlando Pirates were interested in Moremi. AmaZulu had the opportunity to place a high price tag on Moremi, should other clubs want to buy the player.\nIn late 2023, Moremi was called up to Bafana Bafana by Hugo Broos as part of a 50-man preliminary squad for the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations. He was again in the preliminary squad for the 2024 FIFA Series.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Mona Blasia \"Mohana\" Cabral (3 February 1929 – 11 September 1990), also known as Miss Mohana, was an Indian actress, singer, television producer, and dancer based in France. She was known for her work in Hindi films, television, and tiatr productions.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMona Blasia Cabral was born on 3 February 1929, in the village of Socorro, Goa, which was then a part of Portuguese India under the governance of the Portuguese Empire. Coming from a Christian family, she was the eldest among her two sisters and three brothers. Cabral's father had previously worked in British Ceylon but returned to Goa in the late 1930s, securing a position as a cashier at Hindustan Construction Company in Bombay. As a result, the family relocated to Bombay, with Cabral completing her primary education at a local school in Porvorim, Goa, and later continuing her studies at Victoria School in Mahim. \nAfterward, Cabral attended Convent of Jesus and Mary, a boarding school in Poona, where she completed her academic pursuits. It was during this time that she found employment as a telephone operator at Lever Brothers in Bombay. This particular occupation proved to be pivotal in shaping her future career in the Hindi film industry. As a telephone operator, Cabral frequently interacted with popular personalities of the era, including figures from the film industry. It is worth noting that during that period, telephone services did not offer direct connections, and operators played a crucial role in facilitating communication between individuals.\nCabral was known for her passion for acting and singing since childhood. Writer Wilson Mazarello, in his literary work, acknowledged Cabral's beauty alongside her artistic abilities. During her education at Victoria School in Mahim, Cabral, together with her sister, actively participated in school concerts and annual gatherings, thereby cultivating their performance skills and fostering self-assurance. Cabral's breakthrough opportunity arrived when the emerging local playwright, A. F. Rodrigues, staged his tiatr production titled Opurbaechi Sun in Mahim. Recognizing their potential, Rodrigues personally invited Cabral and her sister Ophelia to participate, marking their official debut on the tiatr stage. The display of their abilities caught the attention of C. Alvares, a popular director within the Konkani theater scene.\n\n\n== Career ==\nCabral was the first female artist who played a significant role in breaking barriers for women in the field of Konkani theater. Prior to Cabral, there had been other female performers in Konkani theater, but their presence was fleeting. The tradition of male actors assuming female roles had persisted due to the lack of consistent female performers. However, Cabral's arrival marked a turning point in this practice. She introduced a new era of professionalism among female tiatrists, inspiring an increasing number of women to pursue careers in the field. As a result, the reliance on male actors to portray female characters gradually diminished over time. In the present day, the need for male actors to assume such roles has completely vanished due to the abundance of female tiatrists. Cabral's breakthrough came in 1952 when director C. Alvares recognized her talent, offering her a role in his new tiatr production, Kortub Avoichem (Mother's Actions). In this production, Cabral was the sole female artist among a cast composed entirely of men. The scarcity of female performers during that era led to male actors such as Vincent de Saligao, Andrew Ferns, Master Vaz, and Remmie Colaço assuming female roles. However, Cabral's performance in Kortub Avoichem earned her a standing ovation from the audience, establishing her reputation as an actress. Additionally, director C. Alvares introduced Cabral during the opening chorus to the audience. This marked the beginning of a career for Cabral, as she went on to become the leading lady in subsequent tiatrs produced by C. Alvares. She appeared in popular productions such as Avoicho Xirap (Mother's Curse), Bail de Tarvotti (Seafarer's Wife),\" Bhorvanso (Hope), and Ankvar Kazari (Bachelor Married), among others.\nCabral was a versatile artist known for her contributions to the Konkani stage. Throughout her career, she had the privilege of sharing the stage with actors including Anthony Mendes, A. R. Souza Ferrão, Effie Fernandes, Alfred Rose, Master Vaz, Andrew Ferns, and Remmie Colaço, among others. Her performances garnered attention, attracting audiences from various parts of Bombay and revitalizing the popularity of tiatr, a form of Goan musical theater. Cabral's talent extended beyond acting, as she also collaborated with directors apart from C. Alvares. Cabral brought a distinct charm and appeal to the Konkani stage, with her beauty serving as a catalyst for the growth of tiatr. Spectators from all corners of Bombay eagerly flocked to witness Cabral's appearances in tiatrs. In addition to her acting prowess, Cabral possessed a singing voice, which she showcased through duets with C. Alvares and other singers. Even today, her duets recorded on HMV Records continue to be broadcast by All India Radio in Panaji, preserving her musical legacy. Cabral has produced a number of musical recordings in collaboration with artists such as C. Alvares, Remmie Colaço, Chris Perry, Star of Arossim, and Anthony Mendes for HMV Records. Some of the popular songs include \"Devachi Soirik,\" \"Chokletti Dilear,\" \"Tambddem Bonder,\" and \"Axirvad Di Aaii.\" Prior to her involvement in the Konkani stage, Cabral had a modest presence in Hindi films, where she portrayed supporting roles. Her photogenic qualities and talent led to her inclusion in over 20 Hindi films, alongside Bollywood actors. Popular among her film credits are Insaniyat, Nagina, Saqi, Shart, Sansar, Patanga, Nadaan, Sawan Aya Re, Ashiana, Ashima, and Aag, among others. Cabral's contributions to the film industry were recognized internationally when she was invited as a guest of honor at the Cannes Film Festival in 1954.\nCabral took a hiatus from her involvement in tiatrs to embark on a professional journey to Beirut. After an extensive tenure on the Konkani stage, Cabral received a lucrative contract from television program producers based in Beirut, Lebanon. Collaborating with her sister Ophelia, she also participated in several television programs. During her time in Beirut, Cabral gained prominence as a producer of dance programs. Subsequently, she ventured to France, where she entered into matrimony with her longtime fiancé. Nonetheless, Cabral's love for Konkani and the Konkani stage persisted. Whenever opportunities arose, particularly in European countries, featuring Konkani programs or tiatrs, Cabral eagerly embraced the chance to partake, consistently positioning herself as a frontrunner in such productions. In 1983, while on holiday in India, Cabral made a memorable appearance in Aiz Nam Faleam (If not today, then tomorrow), a new tiatr staged by her brother-in-law Bab Peter and sister Ophelia, which garnered acclaim during its performances in Bombay and Goa. This marked the final occasion for tiatr audiences to witness Cabral's stage presence. Throughout her career, Cabral actively participated in over 200 tiatr performances and delivered approximately 40 songs, rekindling memories of her earlier days when she held a prominent position among female artists in the Konkani theater sphere.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nCabral entered into matrimony twice during her lifetime. Her initial marriage, which unfolded in 1951, was marked by a series of events. Engaged in rehearsals for a song featured in the Hindi film Sansar (1951), Cabral found herself in the rehearsal room of Bombay's Ambassador Hotel. Coincidentally, a young English man occupied a room directly opposite the rehearsal space. Perturbed by the incessant commotion generated by the rehearsals, his patience gradually wore thin over a span of three to four days. Finally reaching a breaking point, he succumbed to a fit of anger and promptly confronted the rehearsal room. However, upon catching sight of Cabral, his ire dissipated instantaneously, leading him to offer a sincere apology before promptly retreating to his own quarters. The allure of Cabral's beauty had thoroughly enchanted him. This young man was Edward Dawning, a pilot serving in the Royal Indian Air Force. A bond formed between Cabral and Edward, culminating in love that ultimately led to their matrimonial union. The couple had a son named Mark. However, their marriage was abruptly cut short when Edward met his death in an aviation accident at Calcutta airport a mere eighteen months after their nuptials.\nIn the 1950s, Cabral entered into her second marriage with a British man John Defrates CBE, who held the position of general manager at Hindustan Lever Limited. John Defrates was the son of Captain H F \"Harry\" Defrates, a paddle steamer captain from Weymouth, England. Their union was considered unconventional within their respective communities, which led Cabral and her husband to make the decision to sacrifice their professional careers. In response to objections from John's employer regarding his marriage to an Indian woman, he chose to resign from his position and pursue a diplomatic career with the United Nations. During the latter half of the 1950s, John was assigned to serve in Beirut, Lebanon, and Cabral accompanied him to this new posting. It was during their time in Beirut that Cabral and John welcomed their daughter, Clare, into the world. After spending nearly 25 years in Beirut, John's diplomatic duties led to a transfer to Vienna, Austria. Following John's retirement in 1986, he, along with Cabral and their daughter, relocated to France. In 1984, Cabral's father-in-law died in London at the age of 89. Cabral's son, Mark \"Marik\" Defrates (1950–2016), from her previous marriage, pursued a career as a chaos magician and jeweller based in Key West, Florida. Mark also established an online association called Z (Cluster) in the 1990s, which served as a platform for individuals interested in chaos magic. Cabral's daughter, Clare Defrates-Penelon, is married and currently resides with her children in La Coucourde, France.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMohana Cabral at IMDb",

        "content": "Momčilo Stanojević (Serbian Cyrillic: Момчило Станојевић; born 1958) is a Kosovo Serb former politician. He served as mayor of Đakovica in the late 1990s and was a member of the National Assembly of Serbia from 1997 to 2001. For most of his time in public life, Stanojević was a member of the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS).\n\n\n== Private career ==\nStanojević was born to a prominent local family in Đakovica. He is a graduated engineer.\n\n\n== Politician ==\n\n\n=== Mayor of Đakovica (1996–99) ===\nThe Socialist Party of Serbia won a landslide victory in Đakovica in the 1996 Serbian local elections, and Stanojević was chosen afterward as mayor of the municipality. Relations between Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo were generally poor in this period, and most members of the Albanian community were boycotting Serbia's political institutions in favour of their own parallel structures.\nThe militant Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) was particularly active in Đakovica during the 1998–99 Kosovo War. In August 1998, Stanojević said that Serbs and Montenegrins in the area fully supported what he described as \"the uncompromising fight against ethnic Albanian terrorism\" by the Yugoslav Army and state security. He also said the KLA was losing support in the Albanian community and that many Albanians were requesting foodstuffs from state-owned shops due to exorbitant prices charged by KLA-aligned salesmen. In December 1998, Stanojević said that the KLA had killed one ethnic Albanian police officer working in the municipality and injured another. Đakovica was targeted in the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, and Stanojević reported significant civilians casualties after one such attack in March 1999.Human Rights Watch documented a pattern of state violence against ethnic Albanians in Đakovica during the Kosovo War and argued that all evidence pointed to close cooperation between various levels of the Serbian state apparatus. A witness was reported to have asked Stanojević, \"What are you doing? Don't you want to live here after this?\" Stanojević was, in this recounting of events, said to have responded that his orders were \"coming from above.\"At Slobodan Milošević's trial at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), an ethnic Albanian witness from Đakovica – who was testifying in support of Milošević – said that he and other Albanians had participated in Stanojević's municipal security forces. The witness defended the Serbian state's actions against what he described as the \"terrorist\" KLA.Virtually all of Đakovica's significant Serb community, including Stanojević, fled the area at the end of the Kosovo War in June 1999, when KLA forces took control of the community. An article in The Times from this period referred to Stanojević as \"a lackey of the Milošević regime\" and noted (disapprovingly) that he had built a new Serbian Orthodox church during his mayoral term with municipal funds provided mostly by the majority Albanian community.Stanojević was for time placed on a list of persons who could not obtain visas for European Union (EU) countries. This occurred during a period of broader sanctions against Milošević's government.\n\n\n=== Parliamentarian (1997–2001) ===\nStanojević appeared in the third position on the Socialist Party's electoral list for the Peć division in the 1997 Serbian parliamentary election. From 1992 to 2000, Serbia's electoral law stipulated that one-third of parliamentary mandates would be assigned to candidates on successful lists in numerical order, with the remaining two-thirds distributed to other candidates at the discretion of the sponsoring parties or coalitions. Stanojević was automatically elected when the list won twelve seats in the division. The Socialist Party won the election and afterward formed a coalition government with the far-right Serbian Radical Party (SRS) and the Yugoslav Left (JUL), and Stanojević served as a government supporter.\nSPS leader Slobodan Milošević fell from power in October 2000, and a new Serbian parliamentary election was held in December of that year. Prior to the election, Stanojević left the SPS and joined Zoran Lilić's breakaway Serbian Social Democratic Party (SSDP). Serbia's electoral system was reformed prior to the election, such that the entire country became a single electoral division. The SSDP did not cross the electoral threshold to win representation in the assembly, and Stanojević's term ended when the new assembly convened in January 2001.\nAfter the Kosovo War, it was reported that Stanojević was building a villa with apartments in Bar, Montenegro.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Mlondi Mbanjwa (born 21 July 1998) is a South African soccer player who plays as a right back for AmaZulu in the Premier Soccer League.\nHe hails from Mariannhill. His career started modestly with Free State Stars, Polokwane City and Uthongathi in the National First Division. He was picked up by AmaZulu ahead of the 2023-24 South African Premier Division campaign, but did not start his first match until October 2023 against Orlando Pirates—where manager Pablo Franco Martin was forced to rotate the team because AmaZulu played their last match only two days prior. Nonetheless, Mbanjwa impressed enough into 2024 that he was called up to Bafana Bafana by Hugo Broos for the 2024 FIFA Series. Here, Mbanjwa made his international debut against Andorra, although South Africa only managed 1–1 against one of Europe's lowest ranked teams.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Marie Charlotte Fayanga (23 January 1946 - 5 February 2021) was a Central African diplomat and politician.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nFayanga was born on 23 January 1946 in Bangui. She finished her primary and high school education, Lycée Pie XII, in Bangui. She studied at École nationale d’administration (ENA) in Bangui from 1966 to 1969 where she gained administrative certificate. Afterwards, she continued her education at Institut International d’administration Publique  in Paris from 1969 to 1972.\n\n\n== Career ==\nUpon finishing her studies in Paris, she returned to the Central African Republic and worked as a central inspector of surface transportation at the Ministry of Transportation and Civil Aviation from 1972 to 1975. Bokassa appointed her as the Deputy Minister in charge of State Vehicles on 1 January 1975. However, she was dismissed on 24 September from the deputy ministerial position after protesting the removal of Louis Alazoula from the government. In February 1976, the government arrested Fayanga for being the relatives of one of the failed coup plotters, François Kossi. Nevertheless, she was released and served as the Secretary of State to the Presidency in charge of the Stabilization and equalization fund for agricultural products at the Council of the Central African Revolution on 4 September 1976.\nUpon the downfall of the Bokassa regime, Fayanga became Patasse's follower and joined the MLPC party and became a member of its political bureau. She also served as the Director of Price control in 1982. However, she was arrested together with Lucienne Patassé and Agnes Mbaikoua in March 1982 following the failed coup attempt. She then left MLPC and joined PSD on 4 October 1991. Patasse appointed Fayanga as the transportation inspector in 1994. In the early 1990s, she was known for advocating multipartyism.\nUnder the Bozize administration, Fayanga became the Ambassador of the Central African Republic to the Republic of Congo in 2004 and was stationed in Brazzaville on 25 March 2005. She held the ambassadorial position until 2021.\n\n\n== Death ==\nFayanga's health condition deteriorated on 31 January 2021, prompting her to be flown to Paris for intensive medical care. She died on 5 February 2021 in La Rochelle. Her body was flown and buried in Bangui on 25 February 2021. Her funeral was attended by Faustin-Archange Touadéra and Chargé d'Affaires of Equatorial Guinea Embassy in Bangui, Benjamin Obama Eworo Mangue.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nFayanga married twice. Her first husband was Mr. Aguide, and she had three children. Later she remarried to Louis Alazoula and the couple had two children.\n\n\n== Awards ==\n, Commander Order of Merit - 1975.\n, Commander Order of Central African Merit - 1994.\n\n\n== References ==",

He was elected at the 2024 election, defeating incumbent Jenny Hill.\nThompson has been banned from the Queensland parliament precinct since 2021.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nThompson had been disendorsed as the One Nation candidate for Thuringowa at the 2020 Queensland state election because he did not disclose his legal name and directorship in a company that went insolvent.\nIn early 2024, Thompson announced his candidacy for mayor of Townsville at the upcoming local government elections, competing against 12-year incumbent Jenny Hill.\nOn 27 March, more than a week after the election, Hill conceded to Thompson.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nThompson had been previously known as Troy Joseph Birnbrauer, after he married a German woman in 1996 and took her surname \"as she was last in her [family] line\".\n\n\n== References ==",

The election was held as part of the statewide local elections in Queensland, Australia.\nIncumbent mayor Jenny Hill was defeated after 12 years in the position by independent candidate Troy Thompson. She officially conceded defeat on 27 March.\n\n\n== Candidates ==\nJenny Hill, who had been serving as mayor since the 2012 election, confirmed in 2023 she would seek re-election. In August 2023, Shari Fabbro and Ben Fusco were announced as Team Hill candidates for Division 2 and Division 10 respectively (the only wards not held by Team Hill).\nTroy Thompson contested the mayoralty as an independent candidate. He had been disendorsed as the One Nation candidate for Thuringowa at the 2020 Queensland state election because he did not disclose his legal name and directorship in a company that went insolvent.\nDivision 10 councillor Fran O'Callaghan withdrew from the mayoral election on 2 February 2024, citing health reasons, and did not recontest her seat.\n\n\n== Campaign ==\nThompson was supported by the local chapter of My Place Australia, a conspiracy theorist group with around 50 active Facebook groups in Queensland.\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n=== Mayor ===\n\n\n=== Councillors ===\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The King's Carnival is a musical burlesque in two acts with music by A. Baldwin Sloane and both book and lyrics by Sydney Rosenfeld.  The musical also included one hit song by the songwriting team of Jean Schwartz and William Jerome, \"When Mr. Shakespeare Comes to Town\". The musical was a parody of several Broadway shows that dealt with royalty and courtly drama, including targeted spoofs of Paul Kester's When Knighthood Was in Flower, Clyde Fitch's The Climbers, Paul M. Potter's Under Two Flags, and Lorimer Stoddard's In the Palace of the King.\n\n\n== Broadway production ==\nSet in palaces in Spain and England, The King's Carnival starred Marie Dressler in the role of Anna of Austria, Queen of Spain, Louis Harrison as Philip II of Spain, Harry Bulger as Henry VIII, Adele Ritchie as Mary Tudor, Amelia Summerville as Inez, and Mayme Gehrue as Sidonia.\nThe King's Carnival was directed by Frank Smithson and produced by Rosenfeld. It used costumes by Caroline Siedle. It premiered on Broadway at the New York Theatre on May 13, 1901. It ran there for a total of 80 performances; closing in June 1901. The production then took a break before resuming performances at the same theatre in September 1901. It ultimately closed on October 12, 1901, with a total Broadway run of 102 performances.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nBordman, Gerald (2001). \"The King's Carnival\".

        "content": "Hunter Brian Hanson is a former American businessman noted for operating a Ponzi scheme that defrauded grain farmers. He was 22 years old when he was convicted of fraud and money laundering.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHanson was considered an \"entrepreneurial wonder\" at a young age. He completed high school in 2015 and started working at a grain elevator. Hanson struck out on his own when he was 20 and registered seven businesses in North Dakota. He reportedly wrote a $30,000 check to buy a car while promoting grain trading businesses. The story he circulated was that he inherited money from his grandparents and used the proceeds to establish his trading businesses, including Midwest Grain Trading Company and Nodak Grain. He first introduced the former as a \"roving grain buyer\". Nodak Grain began operating in 2018 with a warehouse license and rural facilities.\nHanson defrauded grain farmers by purchasing crops at a price above the per-bushel market value and selling them below market value. This Ponzi scheme was carried out by taking money from one investor to pay another. As a result, both Midwest Grain Trading and NoDak Grain accumulated $8 million in unpaid bills.\nAuthorities had investigated where all of the money Hanson bilked went. It was reported that he lived an expensive lifestyle. He traveled with his girlfriend to Paris, bought steam threshing equipment, and purchased high-end vehicles. Hanson also founded a used car business called Hanson Motors. He allegedly used this company to launder part of the $11.2 million he was supposed to pay the 60 farmers he defrauded. He also had eleven bank accounts, which he used to launder money between his businesses.\n\n\n=== Conviction ===\nIn 2018, the North Dakota Public Service Commission closed Hanson's businesses after receiving complaints from farmers and his other victims. It was also found that he was granted a license without grain marketing training or experience. He was arrested on April 4, 2019. On July 30 of the same year, Hanson pled guilty to wire fraud and money laundering charges. He admitted to defrauding North Dakota and Canada victims. He was sentenced to eight years in prison and was ordered to pay back more than $11 million in restitution.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "George Philip Steneff Jr. (27 August 1916 – 2 December 1998) was a United States Army Lieutenant general who served in World War II and the Vietnam War.\n\n\n== Military career ==\nHe attended West Point graduating in the class of 1941.\nDuring World War II he served as an artillery officer in the 14th Armored Division.\nAfter World War II he returned to West Point where he served as a Tactical Officer from 1946 to 1948. He then served in the Armored Branch until 1950, during which time he graduated from the Army Language School and Strategic Intelligence School. He served as assistant Army attache in London until 1953. He then served with the 82nd Reconnaissance Battalion, 2nd Armored Division, part of U.S. Army, Europe until 1955.\nIn 1956, he graduated from the Army Aviation School. He graduated from the National War College in 1960 and was then assigned to the U.S. delegation to NATO. In February 1963 he was appointed commanding officer of the 11th Air Assault Aviation Group and the Division Aviation Officer of the 11th Air Assault Division (Test) on the unit's activation.\nIn March 1966 he was appointed as commanding general, 1st Aviation Brigade, in South Vietnam. He was quick to assemble many of his former 11th Air Assault team to form a brigade staff and to publish the first handbook and standard operating procedures of the brigade. With the publication of basic operational manuals, the 1st Brigade was able to standardize aviation operational procedures throughout Vietnam, establish training schools, enforce safety regulations, and in general more effectively manage the growing aviation assets. Essentially Seneff commanded the non-organic Army aviation elements in Vietnam, but operational control was vested in the supported ground commander. In coordination with Major general William E. DePuy who then commanded the 1st Infantry Division, Seneff began a test period to determine the most satisfactory means of supporting a line infantry division with separate aviation elements. While considerable work had been done in this area during 1965, it had grown in different directions depending on the unit supported and the aviation assets available. Using the 11th Combat Aviation Battalion as the test vehicle, DePuy and Seneff soon ironed out most of the serious problems in matching aviation to the ground units.: 103  On 4 September 1967, four days after the arrival of the first Bell AH-1 Cobras in Vietnam, a Cobra piloted by Seneff made the type's first combat kill, sinking a sampan and killing four Vietcong near Muc Hoa.\nOn 16 September 1967 Seneff passed command of the Brigade to Major general Robert R. Williams.: 155n \nIn October 1967 he was appointed commander of the 3rd Infantry Division in West Germany. From March 1969 he served as operations officer at United States Strike Command and as deputy director of Modern Army Selected Systems Test Evaluation and Review project (\"Project MASSTER\"). In July 1971 he was appointed commanding general of III Corps. In October 1973 he was appointed commanding general of Fifth Army.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nHe died of Alzheimer's Disease on 2 December 1998 in Honolulu, Hawaii. He was buried at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Mykhailo Kostiantynovych Korolenko (Ukrainian: Михайло Костянтинович Короленко; born 20 April 1962) is a Ukrainian politician and civil servant who is a recipient of both the Hero of Ukraine. Additionally, he was formerly the Minister of Industrial Policy of Ukraine from 2013 to 2014. He significantly contributed to the extraction and enrichment of iron magnetite quartzites, producing iron ore concentrate and domain agglomerate, while also playing a key role in advancing the domestic mining and metallurgical complex through the implementation of modern technologies.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBorn on 20 April 1962, in the Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih. Korolenko graduated from the Kryvyi Rih Metallurgical College in 1981, earning a degree in mining engineering enrichment from Kryvyi Rih Mining Institute in 1986.\nKorolenko held various positions in the plant management from 1986 to 2004, including mill machinist, production master, head of the processing plant's main production site, deputy head of the technical control department, chief enricher, chief engineer, and head of the Southern Mining and Processing Plant. He was appointed chief beneficiant and production director of the Central Mining and Processing Plant in 2004–2005; production director of Northern Mining and Processing Plant in 2005–2006; served as the Party of Regions' deputy for the Kryvyi Rih City Council from 2006 until 2010.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\nKorolenko was named Minister of Industrial Policy of Ukraine on 5 February 2013, by proclamation of President Viktor Yanukovych. Ruslan Demchenko and Korolenko, attended the 2013 Dubai Airshow's inauguration. Vice President and UAE Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum visited the Ukrainian pavilion on the opening day of the show. There, he met Korolenko, the leader of the Ukrainian delegation, and learned about the aviation sector in Ukraine.\nRussia modified its import laws and customs to launch an embargo of Ukrainian goods in mid-August 2013, to the point that the Federal Customs Service of Russia banned all shipments of products from Ukraine on 14 August. Prime Minister Mykola Azarov appointed Yuriy Boiko, Ihor Prasolov, Korolenko, Stepan Deryvolkov, Valery Muntiyan, and Viktor Suslov to a working committee to investigate issues with trade and economic cooperation between Ukraine and Russia.\nPractically every industry in Ukraine has been impacted by Russia's tougher rules, but Korolenko claimed that the auto, railroad, and pipe manufacturing industries have been particularly hard hit. Russia has pledged to lift restrictions on steel pipe imports from Ukraine, Korolenko said at a press conference on 17 December. He referenced estimates from experts that, in the event that the Russian–Ukrainian action plan reached in Moscow on the same day by Russian and Ukrainian Presidents Vladimir Putin and Viktor Yanukovych had not taken place, Ukraine would have had to reduce its yearly exports to Russia by between $4 billion and $4.5 billion.\nOn 18 December 2013, Korolenko declared that as a result, Ukraine's exports had decreased by $1.4 billion. The Ukrainian government has decided to delay the signature of an Association Agreement with the European Union, citing economic setbacks that have worsened the nation's political crisis. According to Korolenko, he wants to make sure that the planned effort does not include shifting the focus or direction of Ukraine's international economic and diplomatic policy.\nBy a Verkhovna Rada vote on 27 February 2014, Korolenko was removed from his position as head of the Ministry of Industry and Policy. He then went on to preside over the open joint-stock company Zaporizhzhia Iron Ore Plant board from 14 May 2014 until 30 June 2020.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nKorolenko is married and has two children.\n\n\n== Awards and recognitions ==\nIn Kryvyi Rih, his name is memorialized on the Stele of Heroes. Korolenko has received awards and recognitions such as:\n\n Hero of Ukraine Order of the State (24 August 2012)\n 20 Years of Independence of Ukraine Medal (19 August 2011)\nState Prize of Ukraine in Science and Technology (30 December 2020)\nHonored Worker of Industry of Ukraine (23 February 2012)\nFor Merit to the city (Kryvyi Rih) Badge of the 1st Degree (11 April 2012)\nFor Merit to the city (Dniprorudne) Badge (2017)\nFor Merit to the Zaporizhzhia Oblast Order 1st Degree (2019)\nFor Merit to the Zaporizhzhia Oblast Order 2nd Degree (2017)\nFor Merit to the Zaporizhzhia Oblast Order 3rd Degree (2014)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "Manuel \"Manolo\" Grau Solé (26 December 1872 – 7 May 1934) was a Spanish athlete and a pioneer of Spanish sport. He was a player and director of FC Barcelona, as well as a prominent gymnast, fencer, and practitioner and disseminator of many other sports. In addition to being one of the first members of FC Barcelona, Solé was also co-founder and vice president of the Barcelona Swimming Club in 1907, founder and president of the Solé Pedestre Club (1909), and owner of the Gimnasio Solé from 1910 until his death.\n\n\n== Early and personal life ==\nSolé was born on 26 December 1872 in Benissanet, in the Ribera d'Ebre, at the age of 23, and moved to Barcelona under the tutelage of his uncle, Francisco Solé, who ran an important gym on Carrer del Carme in Montjuïc. In this environment, he became one of the pioneers in sports practice in Barcelona, working as a gymnastics teacher and standing out as a fencer, a discipline in which he won several tournaments.\nSolé married Magdalena Sans, but the couple had no children. His brother Juan Bautista Grau Solé (1876–?) was a fencing teacher at the Solé Gymnasium and one of the most prominent Spanish fencers of the early 20th century. Another Grau Solé brother named José was a prominent doctor in Barcelona.\n\n\n== Sporting career ==\nAs a friend of Joan Gamper, Solé closely witnessed the founding of FC Barcelona on 29 November 1899, which took place in the Gimnasio Solé. He was one of two figures that were present in this historic meeting, but were not founding members, the other being Narciso Masferrer, who had the headquarters of his numerous initiatives domiciled in the gym. He was one of the first members of the Barcelona club and played at least one match, a friendly against Català FC on 23 September 1900, acting as a defender in a 3–1 victory, thus becoming the first player from the Tarragona area to play for the club.  He was then vice secretary of the board of directors chaired by Walter Wild between 17 October and 30 December 1900, the day in which the board not only replaced him with Fernando Blanco, but also granted the title of \"Honorary Members\" to several partners, including Gamper and his uncle Francisco Solé due to his decisive contribution to the birth of the club.. Later, during the presidency of Otto Gmeling (1909–10), he served as the club's first member. It was a board that was very respectful of the club's origins since Masferrer was the vice president and Gamper the treasurer.\nSolé was also a friend of Bernat Picornell, with whom he founded the Club Natació Barcelona, a pioneer in the practice of swimming and water polo in Spain, which was established on 10 November 1907 at the Gimnasio Solé in 1907, just like FC Barcelona eight years before.  He was vice president of the club and promoted the first Spanish Championship of swimming. He was also the creator and president of the Solé Pedestre Club, in 1909.\nIn January 1910, Solé took over from his uncle as director and owner of the Solé Gym. In 1914 he closed the old premises to open a new one a few meters away, on Pintor Fortuny Street, no. 2, under the name Solé Physical Culture Center. Representatives of the daily and professional press were invited to the event, and councilor Mr. Ripoll also attended. They did the honors of the house, together with Solé, Cercos, the doctor of the establishment, and Grao, professor of the Sala de Armas (weapons room). The guests visited all the first and second-class bathroom departments, luxuriously installed, the Weapons Room, which is very elegant and spacious; the Gymnasium hall, where lunch was served, with all those present expressing their wishes for the prosperity of the establishment. The architects who have contributed to the beautification of the establishment were Antonio Ventura, master builder; José Preckler, smokers, boilers and pipes; Orsola Sola and Inc, mosaics; Lacoma brothers, bathtubs, toilets and sinks; Ramón Solé, furniture maker; Fargas and Buxaderas, carpentry, and Franzi brothers, marbles; the works were directed by the renowned architect Juan Casado.\nIn 1924 Solé was one of the guests of honor at the banquet that commemorated the Silver Jubilee of FC Barcelona.\n\n\n== Death ==\nSolé died in Barcelona on 7 May 1934, at the age of 61. His nephews Gustau Griñó and Maria Contell, along with cousins and other relatives, asked their friends and acquaintances to keep Solé in their prayers and to attend the funeral a few days later and to accompany the corpse to the parish church and from there to the Old Cemetery.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nVVAA (2015).

        "content": "The Karasor Basin (Kazakh: Қарасор ойысы; Russian: Карасорская впадина) or Karasor Depression, is a depression in Karkaraly District, Karaganda Region, Kazakhstan.\nThe Karasor Basin includes a 37,286 hectares (92,140 acres) Important Bird Area.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe Karasor Depression is an endorheic basin in the Kazakh Uplands. It extends roughly from east to west for a length of approximately 130 km (81 mi) to the southeast of the Ayr and Zheltau ranges, and north of the Karkaraly Range and the Kyzyltas. Fourteen rivers flow into the basin, the largest of which are the 159 kilometers (99 mi) long Taldy and the 156 kilometers (97 mi) long Zharly. The Karasor Basin is covered in snow approximately between October and April every year. Most rivers and rivulets flow only following the melting of the snows, breaking up into disconnected pools or drying out completely during the summer.\nKarasor, the largest lake, lies in a central position at the bottom of the depression. There are three other major lakes in the basin, Saumalkol, Katynkol and Balyktykol, as well as numerous smaller lakes and sors. The water of all the lakes is saline; Saumalkol in the west is a dead lake, having the highest salt concentration, while Balyktykol has the lowest. The salinity of Karasor and Taldykol exceeds the values of average sea water. Parts of the depressions between the surrounding hills are occupied by salt pans.\n\n\n=== Ancient lake ===\nKarasor was a much larger lake in the past. There are traces of high water levels reaching 640 m (2,100 ft) in the banks of Karasor and adjacent Saumalkol and Katynkol lakes, indicating that the former extension of lake Karasor reached 740 km2 (290 sq mi) —about five times larger, with a depth between 22 m (72 ft) and 25 m (82 ft) —almost five times deeper.

        "content": "The Zharly (Kazakh: Жарлы; Russian: Жарлы) is a river in Karkaraly District, Karaganda Region, Kazakhstan. It is 156 kilometres (97 mi) long and has a basin of 5,660 km2 (2,190 sq mi).\nThe Zharly is one of the longest rivers of the Karasor Basin. The main settlements near its banks are Milybulak, Akshoky, Zharly (NRD), Tegisshildik, Zharly (TRD) and Koktas.\n\n\n== Course ==\nThe Zharly has its sources in the slopes of Mount Duaktas, part of the Kyzyltas Massif, central Kazakh Uplands. It first flows roughly westwards as the Ashchyozek, a mountain river forming rapids within a deep, narrow gorge. After it bends northwards its current is still strong and it is known as the Aktas. Further downriver from Milybulak village it is known as the Koktal; its channel widens and the flow of the current eases. In its middle course the river passes by Akshoky and is known as the Zharly, beginning to twist and turn while continuing to flow northwards; here some stretches of its banks are steep. Further on, the river bends slightly to the NNW north of Tegisshildik, keeping that course along its final stretch, where it meanders within a 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) to 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) wide floodplain with scattered lakes. \nFormerly the river used to reach the southern shore of lake Saumalkol, but now its waters get lost in the ground about 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) to the south of the lakeshore, a little east of Zhanazhol village, former Novy Put.\nThe river has eleven tributaries that are longer than 10 kilometres (6.2 mi). The longest is the 50 kilometres (31 mi) long Taishek from the right.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of rivers of Kazakhstan\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Zharly at Wikimedia Commons",

Rajendra Chakravarthy.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nSreejith Mullapilly from The New Indian Express rated the film two out of five and wrote that \"While strongly opinionated monologues might still be entertaining even if they don’t serve the plot of the film, they hardly work in a disjointed film like Yaavarum Vallavare\". Roopa Radhakrishnan from The Times of India rated the film 2+1⁄2 out of 5 stars and wrote that \"The film preaches rather than showcasing its on-the-face ideologies, which becomes an issue. Yavarum Vallvare falls short of making us feel more for the sad plight of its characters\". Manigandan KR from Times Now gave the film the same rating and wrote that \"Yaavarum Vallavare is a film that works in parts and that has nothing extraordinary to offer\". A critic from Maalai Malar praised Samuthirakani as the best segment of the four, in addition to the music and the cinematography.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nYaavarum Vallavare at IMDb",

        "content": "Joseph Raseta (December 9, 1886 – November 5, 1979) was a Malagasy physician, politician, and intellectual who co-founded the Democratic Movement for Malagasy Renewal with Joseph Ravoahangy-Andrianavalona and Jacques Rabemananjara.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\nJoseph-Delphin Raseta was born to a Hova family in Marovoay on December 9, 1886. His grandfather was a palace official and commander of the Mahajanga garrison in the Franco-Malagasy War of 1883–1885, and his father the governor of Iboina and deka (aide-de-camp) to Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony.\nAfter studying in Antananarivo at a Lasallian school as well as a Quaker school run by the Friends' Foreign Mission Association, he graduated from the city's medical school in 1908. He served as a  medical officer at the Assistance médicale indigène from 1909–1922—during this time, in October 1915, he joined Vy Vato Sakelika (transl. Iron, Stone, Cutting), a secret society of nationalist students. The leaders of the VVS were convicted of plotting against the state in early 1916, but Raseta was not charged. This fact would provoke suspicion toward him later in life, seemingly lending credibility to the allegation of police provocation of the 1947 Insurrection.\n\n\n=== Entry into politics ===\nAfter opening a private practice in Toliara in 1922, in 1926 Raseta became a correspondent for the anticolonial newspaper L'opinion de Diego Suarez. He was unsuccessfully charged in 1927 with forestry-related offenses, and in 1929 and 1930 for soliciting donations on behalf of Jean Ralaimongo. In 1933, he made a public appeal on behalf of a village whose land had been awarded to a colonist, describing the 1926 land decree which enabled this as \"criminally evil\" (French: scélérat); for this he was sentenced to a 500 ₣ fine and three years of restricted freedom of movement for insulting the governor-general, but was acquitted on appeal. In 1935 he was barred from practicing medicine and charged with involuntary manslaughter after the death of an Indian patient he treated for diabetic gangrene, but was again acquitted on appeal.\nRaseta joined the International Red Aid, which represented the French Communist Party in the colonies, and in 1934 joined the League against Imperialism. He contributed to L'Aurore Malgache and Opinion, and in 1935 became a founding owner, with 10% of shares, of the new paper La Nation malgache; he simultaneously worked as a correspondent for L'Humanité and the Prolétariat malgache, founded in late 1936. The latter was the organ of the Communist Party, Madagascar Region (PCRM), of which he was a member from its founding in August 1936 until its dissolution in 1939; Raseta, however, was a nationalist rather than a Communist. Sentenced to two years of internment at a camp in Moramanga by the Vichy authorities under the Indigénat, he was released in 1943 and resumed his political activities.\n\n\n=== Deputy of the Constituent Assembly ===\nRaseta was elected to the French Constituent Assembly of 1945, and reelected in June 1946. He arrived in France in December 1945, and in Paris in 1946 he co-founded the MDRM, becoming the party's first president. Raseta kept a low profile in the first Constituent Assembly, speaking before the Assembly only three times, during debate on a bill to determine the composition and function of colonial local assemblies, and during that of a bill regarding local assemblies on Madagascar. On March 21, 1946, he submitted a bill to designate Madagascar a \"free state within the French Union,\" only for it to be buried in committee. Nevertheless, the repeal of the Indigénat and ban on forced labor assured him a triumphal welcome in Antananarivo on May 5 of that year. In the second Constituent Assembly he reiterated his demand on August 9 in the form of a proposed resolution to hold a referendum on Madagascar, which was rejected. He addressed the Assembly twice, notably on September 19 regarding the draft constitution's chapter on the French Union.\n\n\n=== Conviction in the \"trial of the parliamentarians\" ===\nReelected again on November 10, 1946, Raseta returned to France on March 9 of the following year and was named to the new National Assembly's Committee on the Family, Population, and Public Health. Following the outbreak of the Malagasy Insurrection on March 29, 1947, he questioned the government on its Madagascar policy on May 6, but on May 20 was called before a commission of inquiry, headed by Maurice Viollette, on accusations of involvement in the revolt. Raseta denied any such involvement and publicly condemned the rebellion; nevertheless, after a long debate on June 4, the Assembly voted 234–195 to lift his immunity. Arrested and transferred to Antananarivo, he was taken to court in the \"trial of the parliamentarians\" (July–September 1948) and sentenced to death. After losing an appeal before the Court of Cassation on July 7, 1949, President Vincent Auriol commuted his sentence on July 15 to lifelong detention in exile. Raseta was deported to the Comoros, then transferred to Calvi in October 1950, before finally being released on grounds of ill health on August 6, 1955, and put under house arrest in Grasse, then Cannes.\n\n\n=== Figurehead of Malagasy independence ===\nStill influential in nationalist circles, he joined Jacques Rabemananjara in a 1955 appeal for nationalist unity in the 1955 provincial elections, supported Stanislas Rakotonirina's successful 1956 bid to become the first elected mayor of Antananarivo, and in 1958 lent his endorsement to the newly founded Congress Party for the Independence of Madagascar (AKFM), a pro-Soviet Communist party opposed to Philibert Tsiranana and the French Community. While attempting to return to Madagascar with help from the Communists in July 1959, he was taken in for questioning in Djibouti and returned to France.\nFinally managing to return to his home country in July 1960, he joined the AKFM and ran for a seat Madagascar's own National Assembly on the party's list in Antananarivo, defeating his former MDRM ally Joseph Ravoahangy and becoming the body's oldest member. Upon the Assembly's reopening in May 1961, Raseta distinguished himself with an incendiary speech against the government. Finding himself outnumbered in the AKFM by moderates inclined to compromise with Tsiranana, however, he left the party in 1963 to found the Malagasy National Union (FIPIMA). At the head of the new party, he ran against Tsiranana in the 1965 presidential election, receiving just 2.19% of the vote. This stinging defeat made clear to Raseta his lack of allies in the opposition—even the AKFM had quietly supported Tsiranana.\nWith the rise of the socialist Democratic Republic, Raseta was declared a \"hero of the revolution\" and named a Grand Officer of the Order of Combatants of the Malagasy Revolution by Didier Ratsiraka. Raseta died on October 5, 1979, at the age of 92.\n\n\n== Electoral history ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== References ==",

This two-part series the inaugural edition of a multi-sport Olympic qualifying event, which will determine the athletes who will compete in the 2024 Summer Olympics in BMX freestyle, breaking, skateboarding, and sport climbing.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn April 2022, International Olympic Committee announced the plans for a four-sport, festival-style qualification event for what it described as \"urban sports\"—BMX freestyle, breaking, skateboarding, and sport climbing—in city-centre venues. The series was a part of the organisation's efforts to promote the Olympic qualifying process outlined in its Olympic Agenda 2020+ project, which cited the success of urban sports at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. The inaugural edition would take place between March and June 2024. The IOC announced the two host cities, Shanghai and Budapest, in October 2024. Shanghai was to be the first stop of the series, with events held at the Huangpu Riverside from 16 to 19 May 2024, while the Budapest stage would be held from 20 to 23 June at the Ludovika Campus of the National University of Public Service. Budapest previously hosted the inaugural World Urban Games in 2019.The final day of the series, 23 June, coincides with the annual Olympic Day, and marks the end of the qualifying process for the 2024 games.\n\n\n== Qualification format ==\nThe competition is overseen by the respective international governing bodies of the four individual sports: the World DanceSport Federation (WDSF), the International Cycling Union, World Skate, and the International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC).A total of 464 athletes from four sports will compete for just over 150 quota places in the 2024 Olympic Games, with an equal number of places for men and women. Athletes in BMX freestyle, sport climbing, and breaking earn up to 50 points each in Shanghai and Budapest, for a maximum of 100 points total. In skateboarding, a third of the points are allocated from past events, and the remaining two-thirds are earned in Shanghai and Budapest. The athletes with the highest points qualify for Paris based on the available quota places.\n\n\n== Competitors ==\n\n\n=== Breaking ===\nThe following athletes have qualified for the Olympic Qualifier Series:\n\n\n=== BMX freestyle ===\nThe following athletes have qualified for the Olympic Qualifier Series:\n\n\n=== Sport climbing ===\n\n\n==== Speed ====\nThe following athletes have qualified for the Olympic Qualifier Series:\n\n\n==== Boulder & lead ====\n\n\n=== Skateboarding ===\nThe following athletes have qualified for the Olympic Qualifier Series:\n\n\n==== Park ====\n\n\n==== Street ====\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial page",

        "content": "Angela Doyinsola Aina is an American public health practitioner and the co-founder and executive director of the Black Mamas Matter Alliance, an organization which focuses on improving maternal and reproductive health outcomes for Black women.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nAina earned her Bachelor of Science in Psychology and African-American Studies from Georgia State University in 2005. She earned her Master of Public Health from the Morehouse School of Medicine in 2011.\n\n\n== Career and advocacy ==\n\nAina began her career as a public health practitioner and has worked both at the community level and in academic settings, as well as at both state and federal government levels. Aina recalls these early experiences in her career and how \"she would often find herself in predominantly white spaces\", witnessing a disconnect \"like something is always wrong with Black women or African women\".\nAina was a Public Health Prevention Service Fellow for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for over five years, working on the impacts of the Zika on pregnancy. She also supported the CDC's response to the 2014 outbreak of Ebola in Western Africa.\nIn 2016, Aina helped to co-found the Black Mamas Matter Alliance (BMMA) with Elizabeth Dawes Gay, drawing upon a partnership between the Center for Reproductive Rights and the SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective. Both Aina and Gay point to the CDC's statistics on Black maternal mortality in the United States that say white women die from pregnancy-related causes at a quarter of the rate Black women do. The BMMA has been successful in pushing for legislation to assist African-American women in childbirth, including the Preventing Maternal Deaths Act of 2018. Aina cites the importance of the data this act collects: \"Because if we don’t know how and why women are dying, we’re not able to address these systems-level issues\".\nIn 2018, BMMA launched Black Maternal Health Week as an initiative to draw attention to the health crisis facing Black mothers. In 2021, the Biden-Harris administration officially recognized the initiative. In 2020, Aina was recognized by Time magazine for her work in addressing discrepancies in maternal health care. Aina expressed her hope that \"increased attention will help lead to more investment in black women–led health programs\". Aina and the BMMA have supported the Black Maternal Health Caucus as well as the Momnibus Act of 2023.\nIn September 2020, Aina was named the executive director of the BMMA.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\nIn March of 2020, Aina was recognized as a 2020 WebMD Health Hero\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Cavin Robert Councilor (born August 27, 1963 – June 19, 2002) was an American professional stock car racing driver and team owner. He had competed in the ARCA Re/Max Series from 1997 to 2001.\n\n\n== Racing career ==\nIn 1997, Councilor made his debut in the ARCA Bondo/Mar-Hyde Series at Michigan International Speedway, driving his self-owned No. 95 Ford, where he was running as high as second in the race before finishing 30th due to a crash that was the result of a broken axle. He then made one more ARCA start that year at Talladega Superspeedway, where he finished four laps down in fourteenth place. It was also during this year where he made select starts in the USAR Pro Cup Series, getting a best finish of fourteenth at Birmingham International Raceway. In 1998, he expanded his ARCA program, running in a majority of the races held that year with four top-tens with a best finish of seventh at Kil-Kare Speedway and Winchester Speedway.\nIn 1999, Councilor ran the full ARCA schedule, driving the No. 19 Chevrolet. Across the year, he earned one top-five and four top-ten finishes with a best finish of fifth at Winchester, where he started on the front row. He then ran all but two races the following year in 2000, getting two top-ten finishes at Kentucky Speedway and Berlin Raceway on his way to finish thirteenth in the final points standings.\nIn 2001, Councilor made only two starts, finishing 29th at Nashville Superspeedway due to a crash, and thirteenth at Memphis Motorsports Park, which proved to be his final start as a driver. Despite his driver career ending, he still remained in the now ARCA Re/Max Series as a team-owner, with multiple drivers piloting the No. 19, with Ed Berrier drive a majority of the races held that year, and taking a win at Chicagoland Speedway. He also fielded a NASCAR Busch Series entry for Berrier at Kansas Speedway, where Berrier finished in 43rd to due a crash ten laps into the race.\n\n\n== Personal life & death ==\nCouncilor graduated from Michigan State High School in 1981, where he was a cross-country champion, and attended Florida State University, receiving dual bachelor's degrees in both criminology and economics.\n\n\n=== Death ===\nOn June 19, 2002, Councilor was flying a single-engine, propeller-driven Piper PA-46 alongside two other passengers in Naples, Florida, when the plane hit nose first just after taking off near the Collier County Humane Society. Councilor and the two passengers, Shawn Michael King and an unidentified second passenger, perished in the crash. Witnesses stated that they could hear the engine of the plane cutting out, while some stated that they saw the propeller of the plane stopped, which caused the plane to take a sudden and uncontrolled nose-low descent and make subsequent contact with the ground.\nThe investigation into the case concluded that the crash was likely the result of the pilot's failure to maintain air speed whilst maneuvering to land after the engine ceased operating, which resulted in the plane stalling, then taking an uncontrolled descent. They were not able to determine what caused the engine to fail. Toxicology reports also indicated that Councilor had diphenhydramine in his urine and blood.\n\n\n== Motorsports career results ==\n\n\n=== ARCA Re/Max Series ===\n(key) (Bold – Pole position awarded by qualifying time.

        "content": "The Federation of Korean Associations, Japan (Korean: 재일본한국인연합회; Hanja: 在日本韓國人聯合會; Short name: 한인회; Japanese: 在日本韓国人連合会) is an ethnic association for Koreans in Japan. It caters primarily to recent South Korean emigrants. It is headquartered in Shin-Ōkubo, Tokyo, Japan.\nIt is a different organization from Mindan (The Korean Residents Union in Japan), which was founded by Zainichi Koreans and also aligns itself with South Korea.\n\n\n== Activities ==\nThe organization facilitates support and communication for South Koreans in Japan, Zainichi Koreans, Japanese people, and South Koreans. It publishes a newsletter, organizes events for cultural exchange and business purposes, advocates for South Korean immigrant rights in Japan, and promotes economic ties between the relevant communities and countries. The group also offers advice and services to immigrants. It advocates for friendlier Japan–South Korea relations, and provides services that help South Koreans immigrants integrate into Japanese society.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nKoreans first significantly emigrated to Japan during the 1910–1945 Japanese colonial period. After the 1945 liberation of Korea, around half of the Korean population remained in Japan; they and their descendents are now called \"Zainichi Koreans\". For decades afterwards, few South Koreans settled in Japan for a number of reasons, but namely strained Japan–South Korea relations and South Korean restrictions on emigration. Beginning in the early 1980s, amidst a labor shortage in Japan, Japan began allowing more foreign exchange students and workers from South Korea. By the end of that decade, South Korea loosened its emigration policies. South Koreans began arriving in significant numbers, and often settled in the district of Ōkubo, Tokyo. These recent South Korean immigrants are sometimes called \"newcomers\" (뉴커머) by the Zainichi Korean population.\nThe organization has its origins in a small organization founded in September 2000. It initially had six members and was called \"The Association in Consideration of [South] Koreans in Japan\" (Korean: 재일한국인을 생각하는 모임). By December 2, 2000, they held a meeting in which they decided to significantly expand the organization, and proposed that it be called \"The Federation of Korean Associations, Japan\". They prepared for its creation, and eventually held their first official meeting and inauguration on May 20, 2001. At the time of creation, they had 400 registered members. By the end of the year, they had over 1,800.\nBeginning in the late 2010s, the group has experienced some internal conflict. An effort was made to modify the organization's structure in order to absorb other similar Korean associations in Japan. However, disagreement over this process and a dispute over the legitimacy of an internal election led to a smaller splinter group leaving the organization and founding another in September 2022 (similarly named; 일반사단법인 재일본한국인연합회; lit. General Aggregated Corporation The Federation of Korean Associations, Japan), which is now also based in Tokyo.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHomepage (in Korean)",

        "content": "Albert Cook Myers (December 12, 1874 – April 1, 1960) was an American author, genealogist, and historian of Quakers and Pennsylvania. He was a leading authority on the life and works of William Penn, a Quaker leader and founder of the Province of Pennsylvania during the British colonial era.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nMyers was born in York Springs, Pennsylvania, the first child of Sarah Ann (née Cook) and John T. Myers. His mother taught school before her marriage, while his father sold farm equipment and real estate. At the age of 18, his mother reportedly shook Abraham Lincoln's hand after he delivered the Gettysburg Address. As adults, one of his sisters taught at the Friends Select School, the second was a social worker, and the third was a housewife. \nMyers attended Adams County public schools and graduated from Martin Academy in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, in 1894. He received his Bachelor of Letters in 1898 and his Master of Letters in 1901, both from Swarthmore College. In 1932, Franklin & Marshall College awarded him an honorary Doctor of Letters. He took graduate coursework in history at the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Wisconsin, and Harvard University. \n\n\n== Public history career ==\nMyers worked as registrar, instructor, and secretary to the president at Swarthmore from 1900 to 1902. He edited The Literary Era from 1898 to 1900.\nMyers became a prominent figure in Pennsylvania public history. He served as a director of the Pennsylvania Historical Exhibit and of the Historical Exhibits of the Thirteen Original States for the Jamestown Exposition in 1907. He served on the Philadelphia Mayor's Historical Committee to organize celebrations of the city's founding and directed the Historic Industries Loan Exhibit of the Founders Celebration. As a member of the Philadelphia War Service Committee during World War I, he entertained a total of 32,000 servicemen by organizing historical tours of Philadelphia, arranging meals and receptions at the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, and distributing pamphlets about the city's history. In 1924–25, he raised funds to purchase William Penn's royal charter and bring it back to Pennsylvania; he also organized the 1925 welcome celebration. In 1928, he directed a celebration of the 150th anniversary of the French alliance with America and in 1932 directed a celebration of the 250th anniversary of the first arrival of Penn in America.\nFrom 1924 to 1936, Myers served on the board of the Valley Forge Park Commission, which expanded the future Valley Forge National Historical Park. In 1924–27 and 1933–36, he served as secretary of the Pennsylvania State Historical Commission. He ramped up the state's historical marker program, installing scores of markers and also contributing to the restoration of Pennsbury Manor. He served on the board of directors of the Friends Historical Association from 1921 to 1925 and again from 1927 to 1936. He also served as president of the Pennsylvania Federation of Historical Societies. \nIn 2011, Myers was posthumously elected to membership in the National Genealogy Hall of Fame, run by the National Genealogical Society.\n\n\n== Personal life and death ==\nMyers was a lifelong Hicksite Quaker. He never married or fathered children. He lived at his parents' house in Moylan from 1906 to 1955, when he sold the house and moved to West Chester and then to the Pocopson Home assisted living facility. He died in West Chester on April 1, 1960, at the age of 85. He was interred at the cemetery of the Providence Friends Meetinghouse, where he had been a lifelong congregant, in Media, Pennsylvania.\n\n\n== Research and publications ==\nIn 1910, Myers launched a lifelong project to research Penn's life and compile and edit the complete works of William Penn, which he intended to publish in 15 volumes. He spent years in England and Ireland tracking down Penn's letters. His research gained the support of the Royal Historical Society and the Friends Historical Society, which arranged to have him formally presented to King George V and access private collections across Britain and Ireland. Myers died without completing this work, but he did publish many books and articles on Pennsylvania and Quaker history, genealogy, and biography.\n\nWharton, Walter (1955). Myers, Albert Cook (ed.).

Totaling 450 boxes, the collection includes transcriptions of marriages, land records and maps, diaries, cemetery and courthouse records, and other materials (including his academic gown). The collection featured one of nine known surviving daguerreotypes of Frederick Douglass. Douglass had gifted the photo to Susan B. Anthony, whose niece in turn gave it to Myers.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Alfred Meadows (2 June 1833–18 April 1887) was an English obstetric physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMeadows was born at born at Ipswich on 2 June 1833. He was fourth child of Charles Meadows. A brother, Robert (1839–1887), obtained a distinguished position in China as a medical man. Alfred was educated at the grammar school, Ipswich, and later at King's College, London, of which he was first associate and afterwards fellow. He matriculated at the London University in 1853, and after serving as pupil to William Elliston of Ipswich, he entered, in October 1853, the King's College medical school, where he obtained many prizes. In 1856 he was admitted a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England and a licentiate of the Apothecaries' Hall. He also became a licentiate in midwifery of the Royal College of Surgeons. In 1857 he graduated M.B. of the university of London, and in the following year he became M.D., and in 1862 a member of the Royal College of Physicians of London; but it was not until 1873 that he was elected a fellow of that body. Immediately after obtaining his first qualifications to practice he held the offices of house-physician and resident midwifery assistant at King's College Hospital, and in 1857 he spent the winter in Paris.\nFew men held a larger number of appointments than Meadows. The following are some of the more important. In 1860 he was assistant-physician for diseases of women and children at King's College Hospital; from 1863 until his resignation of the post in 1874 he was physician to the Hospital for Women, Soho Square. In 1871 he became physician accoucheur to St. Mary's Hospital, a post he held until his death, and was lecturer in the medical school on the diseases of women and children. He was elected the first president of the British Gynæcological Society on its foundation in 1884, and was a corresponding member of the German, Swedish, and Boston gynæcological societies. In 1878 he attended the crown prince of Sweden while he visited England, and in recognition of his services the king of Sweden, in 1881, made him a commander of the second class of the order of Wasa. He died on Tuesday, 18 April 1887, at his house in George Street, Hanover Square, and is buried at Colnbrook, Buckinghamshire.\nMeadows was an active promoter of the Guild of St. Luke. He was an energetic freemason and an officer in grand lodge, and took a leading part in founding the University of London lodge. Sir Edward Sieveking says of him: ‘He was an active and energetic man, and he was able to bring to the contested field of practice those qualities which, combined with activity and energy, insured him a large amount of success. He was kind and hospitable in all his social arrangements, a good mechanician, clever in the adoption of means to an end, and skilful in the manipulative details of his department of practice.’\nHe published ‘A Manual of Midwifery,’ 3rd edit. London, 1876 (the second edition was translated in 1875 into Japanese and published in 12mo), and, with Dr. Tanner, a work on the diseases of children. He was translator of Bernutz and Goupil's ‘Clinical Memoirs on the Diseases of Women’ for the New Sydenham Society, vols. i. and ii. 1866. He edited the ‘London Medical Review’ in 1860.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Power, D'Arcy (1894). \"Meadows, Alfred\".

        "content": "Samuel B. Parrish (February 25, 1838 – July 12, 1897) was an American Indian Agent and Portland Police Chief. He lived at Cardwell–Parrish House, listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1991.\nAs a young man, Parrish worked as a government express employee for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, was a cowboy, and worked for the custom house. Parrish was indicted but not convicted of transporting liquor between Portland and Victoria, British Columbia in 1866 and 1867 without paying the duties.\nHe worked for Indian Affairs during the Modoc Wars, was instrumental in  establishing the Malheur Indian Reservation, and was an Indian Agent there. With Sarah Winnemucca, Parrish introduced agricultural methods for effective farming and helped establish and operate a school for children and young adults. Some white people in the area were not happy with the job he was doing and had him fired after about a year and a half.\nParrish worked as assistant manager of the Monumental Mining Company in Grant County, Oregon, for about four years. He then worked at the Portland Police Department in customs and, beginning in 1884, as the city's chief of police, a position he held for eight years.\n\n\n== Early life and parents ==\nSamuel Ball Parrish, born February 25, 1838, in Pike, Allegany County, New York, was the son of Elizabeth (née Winn) and Rev. Josiah L. Parrish. Parrish had an older brother Lamberson (who died in 1840), older brother Norman, and a younger brother Charles. \nStarting as a harness maker and blacksmith, Josiah became a missionary for the Methodist Episcopal Missionary Society. The family sailed for eight months around Cape Horn in 1840 from New York to the mouth of Columbia River of the Oregon Territory. They traveled with the Alvin F. Waller party on the ship and then to Rev. Jason Lee's mission near Salem. Parrish's father was a teacher, missionary, and when needed, a blacksmith. Josiah co-founded and served as president of Oregon Institute, now known as Willamette University. Parrish was educated at Oregon Institute and lived with his parents until 1857. In 1858, Josiah opened a small book and stationery store, J. L. Parrish & Company, in Portland. Parrish worked in the bookstore in his youth.\nParrish had two stepmothers. Josiah was married a second time to Jennie Lichtenthaler, and they had two daughters, Grace and Josie. Jennie died in 1887. In 1888, Josiah married Mrs. M. A. Pierce, the widow of early pioneer J. O. Pierce, who had a child from that marriage.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Early career ===\nDuring the Rogue River Wars, also called the Indian War of 1855-1856, Parrish carried the government express through the Willamette Valley for the superintendent of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. In 1857, he engaged in the cattle business, driving from Oregon to British Columbia and the Eraser River mines, and continued in that occupation about two years. Parrish was a merchant, living with George Stratton and his small family in Portland, in 1860. In 1863, Parrish became connected with the railroad interests in Oregon, first being associated with S. G. Elliott, and later with Ben Holliday. He identified himself as a retired merchant in 1870 when he lived in Portland with two women. From 1870 to January 1873, Parrish held the office of Inspector of Customs.\n\n\n=== Legal case ===\nParrish—with Asa Mercer, a deputy collector for the custom house; George A. Ladd, a delivery man; and H. W. Rappeleye, who prepared the fraudulent paperwork—were deemed by prosecutors to have transported liquor between Victoria, British Columbia and Portland without paying duties. Brandy was conveyed in December 1866 to Portland. In January 1867, Irish whiskey and wine were sent from Portland to Victoria. Mercer approved the paperwork. Parrish was believed to have been the ring leader. A grand jury convened before the arrests made in May 1867. They were released after posting bond, with bail set at $3,000 (equivalent to $65,400 in 2023) for Parrish and $2,000 each for Ladd and Rappeleye. A grand jury indicted Mercer, Parrish, Ladd, and Rappeleye. The prosecutors tried the case three times, plagued by witnesses who would not testify, defendants not showing up to court due to illness or otherwise absent, and very limited press coverage. Charges against Parrish were dropped, and the jury was deadlocked on Mercer's case. The U.S. Attorney's office dropped the case against Mercer.\n\n\n=== Indian agent ===\nAppointed Commissioner, under T. B. Odenale, superintendent of Indian Affairs, Parrish went into eastern Oregon to preserve the neutrality of the Northern Paiute and Snake Indians during the Modoc Wars. He was instrumental in establishing the Malheur reservation.\nParrish then worked as an Indian Agent for the Malheur Indian Reservation, beginning April 18, 1874. With Sarah Winnemucca, his Paiute-English interpreter, Parrish was able to help the Paiute to farm the land using irrigation. He taught at the school he built and Winnemucca established. Upon opening the school in October 1876, and with the leadership of Parrish's sister-in-law, they taught 374 children and 42 young men and women. Parrish distributed rations, during a time when Native Americans generally did not receive their promised supplies from the government. Author Michael Farquhar stated that Parrish \"treated the Indians with kindness, encouraging them to work the land and to keep the rewards of their labor.\" White residents of Canyon City had Parrish removed from his position on April 25, 1876. They had also tried to obtain some of the reservation land. Parrish was replaced by William V. Rinehart, who reversed Parrish's plans and fired Winnemucca.\n\n\n=== Mining ===\nParrish then engaged in mining in Grant County, Oregon, also served as assistant manager of the Monumental Mining Company, but in September 1880, returned to Portland to work for the police department.\n\n\n=== Portland Police Department ===\nThe City Council of Portland appointed Parrish to the position of weigher and gauger for the Portland Police Department. He worked under N. F. Shurtleff, the collector of customs. After he was elected on April 23, 1884, Parrish served as chief of police for the city of Portland for eight years. During that time, he thoroughly reorganized the department. Parrish retired in August 1892. After Parish retired, he was sued by the City of Portland for holding money from city taxes that he was responsible for managing. Upon learning that Parrish had used his own money in December 1891 to pay police officers when there were insufficient funds in the city's account, the city attorney dropped the suit and settled. The last year of his life, Parrish served as bailiff for Judge H. E. McGinn at the Circuit Court.\n\n\n=== German Remedy Company ===\nIn the fall of 1892, Parrish was interested in the German Remedy Company and the treatment of alcohol, morphine, and tobacco habits. With Captain J. T. Watson and John R. Duff, he purchased the agency for the State of Washington, and established their headquarters in Seattle on January 1, 1893. Used in Germany for over eighty years, the remedy was brought to America in 1870.\n\n\n== Membership ==\nWhile a businessman, Parrish was a member of the Portland's Stock and Exchange Board. Parrish was a member of the Oregon Pioneer Association and the Ancient Order of United Workmen (AOUW). \n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1885, Parrish married Adda, also known as Addie Crabb, daughter of pioneer John Crabb. They were married at Halsey, Linn County, Oregon. Parrish and his wife lived in a Queen Anne House along the Willamette River, now called the Cardwell–Parrish House, which has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1991. They lived in the house beginning in 1891. The house was sold two months after Parrish died. Parrish died on July 12, 1897, in Portland, Oregon, and he is buried in River View Cemetery. His wife Adda died on October 7, 1911, age 54, in the state of Washington and was buried in Portland, Oregon.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nForbes, Jack D. (1967).

        "content": "Pena Branca & Xavantinho was a Brazilian Sertanejo duo made up of brothers José Ramiro Sobrinho (4 September 1939 – 8 February 2010), as Pena Branca, and Ranulfo Ramiro da Silva (26 December 1942 – 8 October 1999), as Xavantinho. They became famous with their cover of the Milton Nascimento song \"O cio da terra\", with Nascimento himself providing guest vocals. During their career, they recorded with famous artists both inside and outside the Sertanejo scene such as Nascimento, Rolando Boldrin, Fagner, and Almir Sater, among others.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Pena Branca ===\nJosé Ramiro Sobrinho, or Pena Branca, was born on 4 September 1939 in Igarapava, São Paulo. He lived for a large part of his life in the city of Uberlândia, Minas Gerais, later the birth city of his brother Xavantinho.\n\n\n=== Xavantinho ===\nRanulfo Ramiro da Silva, or Xavantinho, was born in the Cruzeiro dos Peixotos district of Uberlândia on 26 December 1942.\n\n\n=== Early life ===\nThe brothers largely grew up in a rural zone of Uberlândia. They worked in a rural area when they were children alongside their parents and five siblings. José Ramiro learned to play the viola de cravelha (a 12-string guitar), while Ranulfo learned to play the violão. They performed at folias de reis, at kermesse, parties, and volunteer drives. Their father died when Pena Branca and Xavantinho were 12 and 9 years old, respectively.\n\n\n=== 1958–68: Beginning of musical career ===\nIn 1958, Pena Branca & Xavantinho began to sing as a duo, performing on a radio station in Uberlândia. In 1961, they appeared on Coronel Hipopota's program on Rádio Educadora de Uberlândia. At that time they called themselves Peroba and Jatobá. Afterwards, they adopted the stage name Barcelo e Barcelinho and, later on, Xavante e Xavantinho, inspired by their history classes in primary school. In 1964, they travelled to the interior of the state of Goiás with accordionist Pinaji. The three became, for a brief period, Trio Pena Branca. In 1968, they moved to São Paulo to attempt to grow their musical careers.\n\n\n=== 1970s: Name change to Pena Branca & Xavantinho ===\nThey came in 4th place at a festival promoted by Rádio Cometa, which offered them a chance to record a CD with their song “Saudade” (Xavantinho, 1971). To acknowledge the two as a duo, they again changed their name to Pena Branca e Xavantinho. In 1975, they became part of the Coração de Viola orchestra in Guarulhos, where Inezita Barroso heard them sing and encouraged them to continue in their musical trajectory. That same year, they were hired to perform at the Basilica of Our Lady of Aparecida on weekends.\n\n\n=== 1980s: Album releases and prizes ===\nIn 1980, they participated in \"Festival MPB Shell\" on TV Globo, with the pagode caipira \"Que terreiro é esse?\", written by Xavantinho. The song reached the final round. That same year, they released their first LP: \"Velha morada\" (Warner), with the most famous songs being \"Cio da terra\" (Milton Nascimento, Chico Buarque), \"Calix Bento\", along with the titular \"Velha morada\".The duo participated on Som Brasil in 1981, which was presented by Rolando Boldrin on TV Globo, with whom they later performed in shows throughout Brazil.\nIn 1982, they released the LP \"Uma dupla brasileira\", produced by Boldrin, the most well-known of which being \"Memória de carreiro\" (Juraíldes da Cruz) and \"Rama da mandioquinha\" (Elpídio dos Santos).\nIn 1987, they released \"O cio da terra\" (Continental), with special participation by Milton Nascimento, Marcus Viana, and Tavinho Moura, becoming known for \"Vaca Estrela e boi Fubá\" (Patativa do Assaré) and \"Cuitelinho\" (a folkcloric song collected by Paulo Vanzolini). The LP was their best-selling album to date, with more than 300,000 copies sold, and led them to become more known nationally, reaching an audience with fans of MPB.In 1988, they launched the LP \"Canto violeiro\" (Continental), with special participations from Fagner, Tião Carreiro, and Almir Sater, among others, containing the hit \"Mulheres da terra\" (Xavantinho and Moniz).\n\n\n=== 1990s: Final years and Xavantinho's death ===\nThey won the Sharp Award in Best Music in 1990 with the song \"Casa de barro\", written by Xavantinho and Moniz, and Best CD, with \"Cantado do mundo afora\".In 1992, \"Ao Vivo em Tatuí\", recorded live between 21 and 23 September 1992 at the Teatro do Conservatório de Tatuí with Renato Teixeira (Kuarup) again won the Sharp Award for Best CD and the APCA Prize.They would later record \"Violas e canções\"(Velas) in 1993, having a major hit with \"Viola quebrada\" (Mário de Andrade). They would also perform internationally for the first time that year, playing shows in the United States.They also released \"Ribeirão encheu\" (Velas), in 1995, along with \"Luar do sertão\" (João Pernambuco and Catullo da Paixão Cearense) and \"Pingo d'água\" (Velas). In 1996, they released \"Tristeza do jeca\" (Angelino de Oliveira) and \"Flor do cafezal\" (Luís Carlos Paraná).\nTheir last project, Coração Matuto (1998), would bring singles such as “Planeta Água” (Guilherme Arantes), “Lambada de Serpente” (Djavan), “Morro Velho” (Milton Nascimento), and “Carreiro Velho” e “Estrada”, the last compositions by Xavantinho.The duo ended with the death of Xavantinho on 8 October 1999 at 56 years old due to a pulmonary embolism.Pena Branca continued performing in a solo career. His 2002 album, Pena Branca canta Xavantinho, along with his participation on the Elomar album Cantoria brasileira, were both nominated for Best Brazilian Roots/Regional album at the 4th Annual Latin Grammy Awards, held in Miami, Florida, USA in 2003. He would continue to perform until his own death on 8 February 2010, at age 70, due to a heart attack.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nIn 2007, a researcher from the Federal University of Uberlândia, Ariovaldo Giaretta, named a species of frog after Pena Branca & Xavantinho. The frog species, Ischnocnema penaxavantinho, is part of the brachycephalidae family of frogs and is native to the region around the duo's hometown of Uberlândia.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nVelha morada (1980)\nUma dupla brasileira (1982)\nCio da terra (1987)\nCanto violeiro (1988)\nCantadô do mundo afora (1990)\nAo vivo em Tatuí (with Renato Teixeira) (1992)\nViolas e canções (1993)\nPena Branca & Xavantinho (1994)\nRibeirão encheu (1995)\nCoração matuto (1998)\n\n\n== References ==",

On 6 July 1792 he married there a Miss Ramsbotham (Gent. Mag. 1792, pt. ii. p. 672). A marriage of Dr. Mossman, physician of Bradford, to Mrs. Ramsbottom of Barwick-in-Elmet, Yorkshire, is also recorded in 1812 (ib. 1812, pt. ii. p. 586).\nMossman wrote: \n\n'Observations on the Brunonian Practice of Physic: including a Reply to an anonymous Publication reprobating the Use of Stimulants in Fevers,' 8vo, London, 1788.\n'An Essay to elucidate the Nature, Origin, and Connexion of Srophula [sic] and glandular Consumption; including a brief History of the Effects of Ilkley Spaw; with Observation on the Medicinal Powers of the Digitalis,' &c., 8vo, Bradford [1792?] (another edit., London, 1800).\nHe contributed four papers to Duncan's 'Annals of Medicine,' 1797 and 1799 (ii. 298, 307, 413, iv. 432), a paper in the 'Medical Repository' (i. 577), and numerous papers on the effects of digitalis in consumption to the 'Medical and Physical Journal.'\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Goodwin, Gordon (1894). \"Mossman, George\".

        "content": "Manuel Graciano Ansoleaga Aguirre (17 December 1879 – ?) was a Spanish footballer who played as a midfielder for Athletic Bilbao, with whom he won the 1903 and 1904 Copa del Rey titles. He later joined the ranks of Atlético Madrid, becoming the club's first-ever manager as well as a vice president in the early 1920s.\n\n\n== Football career ==\n\n\n=== Bilbao FC ===\nIn the late 1890s, Ansoleaga became a member of an informal group led by Carlos and Manuel Castellanos, the so-called Bilbao Football Club, the first entity to play football in Bilbao since the disappearance of Club Atleta. Although it was formed in 1896, it was not until 30 November 1900 that the Bilbao Football Club was officially established in a meeting held in the house of industrialist José Luis de Villabaso in the Biscayan neighborhood of Algorta.\nAt the end of 1901, the two most important clubs in the city were Bilbao FC and Athletic Club, so they began playing several friendly matches against each other at the Hippodrome of Lamiako, and Ansoleaga, along with his brother, a certain J. Ansoleaga, played in some of them, thus being part in what is now regarded as one of the first football rivalries in Spain, one that helped turn football into a mass phenomenon in Bilbao since their duels aroused great expectation.\nAnsoleaga featured in the midfield alongside his brother in a match on 1 December 1901, which ended in a 1–1 draw, but then he missed the next match two weeks later, on 15 December, and since he was not replaced, Bilbao FC played with 10 players. Ansoleaga then played in the first paid match held in Biscay on 19 January 1902, in which Bilbao FC once again played with one less player than Athletic, but despite \"playing a very hard game all afternoon, he was confident and tireless\", as reported in the newspapers of the time. In this match, he started as a midfielder, but then in the second half, with the arrival of Lee, who was late, the goalkeeper Rogelio Renovales moved into midfield and Ansoleaga took over as goalkeeper, and as a result of this change, Bilbao FC began to push much more and they were rewarded with a goal from William Dyer, although they still ended up losing 2–4.\nHis next and last appearance for Bilbao FC came on 9 March 1902, which ended in an 0–1 loss to Athletic; in the chronicle of this match, his name was wrongly written as \"Aureolaga\".\n\n\n=== Athletic Bilbao ===\nIn 1903, Bilbao FC collapsed and its remaining members were officially absorbed by Athletic Club, and even though Ansoleaga played only two competitive matches for Athletic between 1902 and 1904, he was part of the Athletic team that won the 1903 Copa del Rey, featuring in the final alongside the likes of Alejandro de la Sota, and club founders Juan Astorquia and Eduardo Montejo; He was at the heart of a 3–2 comeback win over Madrid FC (now known as Real Madrid) in the final. Ansoleaga was also part of the team for the 1904 Copa del Rey, which Athletic won without playing a single match since their opponents failed to turn up.\n\n\n== Managerial career ==\nIn the mid-1910s, Ansoleaga became the assistant coach of Billy Barnes. In 1915, the club's management commissioned the Basque painter José Arrue a portrait of the team, which depicted the eleven players, wearing red and white jerseys and black pants, plus the coach Barnes and his \"tireless\" assistant, Manolo Ansoleaga. Ansoleaga later joined the ranks of Atlético Madrid, becoming the vice president of the club under the presidency of Julián Ruete until he was replaced by José García Cernuda in the 1922–23 season.\nIn 1921, the Atlético board asked Ansoleaga, the then vice-president of the club, to coach the team, thus becoming the first-ever documented coach in the club's history. He was at the helm of the club for just one season.\n\n\n== References ==",

His aunt, Raymonde Joseph, his twin sisters, Carla Merhige and Lisa Knight, as well as his 6-year-old cousin, Makayla, were killed in the shooting. Lisa Knight was pregnant at the time of the shooting. Her husband, Patrick Knight, was severely injured and spent three months in a coma.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe family had a troubled past. In 1973, Paul Merhige's aunt, Salwa Merrige-Abrams, murdered her ex-husband and two children before committing suicide by taking barbiturates.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nA manhunt for Merhige followed, with a $25,000 reward offered for information leading to his arrest.\nOn January 2, 2010, Merhige was arrested. On October 27, 2011, Paul Merhige pleaded guilty to all charges, and was sentenced to seven consecutive life sentences without parole.\nThe same year, on September 15, Jim and Muriel Sitton sued Paul's parents, with their reasoning being that they could have prevented the murders. In 2014, 4th District Court of Appeal ruled that Merhige's parents could not be held liable for the massacre.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Vithaikkaaran (transl. Magician) is a 2024 Indian Tamil-language crime thriller film directed by Venki and starring Sathish. The film was released to mixed-to-negative reviews.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\nSathish plays a dual role in the film. The film marks the Tamil lead debut of Simran Gupta, who previously worked as a dancer in the song \"Simtagaaran\" in Sarkar (2018), and the feature film debut of cinematographer Yuva Karthick. One of the film's schedules was shot in Coimbatore. \n\n\n== Reception ==\nA critic from The Times of India rated the film 2+1⁄2 out of 5 and wrote that \"Vithaikkaaran is a film that works best when the comedy and drama elements are intertwined. The film suffers when it gets into full-on serious mode, as these portions don't work as well as its dark comedy moments and meta-jokes\". A critic from Cinema Express rated the film two out of five stars and wrote that \"Sathish’s restrained performance as Vetri isn’t enough to save this act that is bland and lacks a punch to hold its audience’s attention span. I often found myself drifting away with the convoluted screenplay in the second half that tries to add humour, wittiness and action in scenes that are already all over the place\".\n\n\n== Home media ==\nIn March of 2024, the film was made available to watch on Simply South and Amazon Prime Video.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVithaikkaaran at IMDb",

        "content": "Portland station was a passenger rail station on the Grand Trunk Railway in Portland, Maine, United States. It stood to at the foot of India Street, Portland's first street, between 1903 and 1966. It was one of Portland's four railroad stations for the Portland and Forest Avenue Railroad Company over its history, and one of the two stations in the city at the time of the station's construction. The other was Union Station, which has also been demolished. \nThe Grand Trunk and steamship offices building still stands, at the corner of India Street and Thames Street. As of 2024, it was in use as the head office of Gorham Savings Bank. A third story was added to this building in 1903. \nThe station's clock tower was removed in 1948, eighteen years before the station itself was razed. \nConstruction of the Grand Trunk Railways was delayed by the American Civil War, but used rail was obtained from New Brunswick in 1863 to complete a line from India Street along Middle Street, through Monument Square, along Congress Street, and then down High Street, and westerly along Spring Street to Clark Street. Service with horse-drawn street cars began on 12 October 1863.  In 1864, an adjoining line was built along Preble Street from Monument Square and thence along Portland Street and Forest Avenue to Woodfords Corner.  This line was later extended to Morrills Corner along Pleasant Avenue and Stevens Avenue.  Lines along Congress Street were extended westward to Longfellow Square and eastward to Atlantic Street on Munjoy Hill. Horse-drawn sleighs were substituted for rail cars when snow and ice covered the streets during winter months to avoid ice removal inconveniencing other horse-drawn sleighs. \nIn the late 19th century, Portland was favored over Boston as the seaport terminus for the Grand Trunk Railway from Montreal. When rail service to Montreal was withdrawn, the station was abandoned.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nGrand Trunk railway stations\nRailroad history of Portland, Maine\n\n\n== References ==",

He does not appear to have practised medicine, at least in London, till middle life, since it was not till 9 July 1722 that he took the degree of M.D.,and six years later, 23 December 1728, was admitted candidate of the College of Physicians of London, succeeding to the fellowship 22 December 1729. He was elected physician to Bethlehem Hospital for lunatics 9 October 1728, which appointment he held till his death. For the rest of his life he devoted himself to the treatment of insanity. He is said to have been a skilful and honourable physician. His policy in not admitting students or physicians to the practice of his hospital was the subject of hostile criticism in Dr. Battle's treatise on 'Madness' (London, 1758, 4to), and was defended in a pamphlet by his son John Monro, who is separately noticed. James Monro's only literary production was the Harveian oration at the College of Physicians in 1737. He died 4 November 1752, at Sunninghill, Berkshire, and is buried there. A portrait of him is in the College of Physicians.\nMonro married on 22 February 1707, Elizabeth (died 20 November 1753) the only child of Thomas Hay (died 1734), Solicitor in Chancery. Their children included Dr. John Monro and Thomas Monro (1716–81).\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Payne, Joseph Frank (1894). \"Monro, James\".

        "content": "Dmytro Semenovich Kiva (Ukrainian: Дмитро Семенович Ківа; born 8 October 1942) is a Ukrainian engineer and professor who is a recipient of the Hero of Ukraine, Order of Merit and Order of Prince Yaroslav the Wise. Additionally, he was formerly the President–General designer at Antonov.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBorn on 8 October 1942, in the Tatarstan city of Kazan. Kiva graduated from the Kharkov Aviation Institute in 1965. He has been employed at the Antonov Aviation Scientific-Technical Complex (ASTC) since 1964. He joined the state-owned corporation in 2006 as its chief designer and rose to the position within two years.\n\n\n== Career ==\nDmytro Kiva was named General Designer on 25 May 2005, by order of Volodymyr Shandra, Minister of Industrial Policy. Furthermore, he has been the president and general designer of Antonov ASTC since 2006. As early as 2006, Antonov proposed to create fighter and attack aircraft. However, Kiva stated that at the time, they were arguing that it wasn't required. He went on to say that Ukrainian businesses would be involved in the creation of these aircraft, which would include Ukrainian engines, equipment, and armaments.\nUnder Dmytro Kiva's leadership, the Antonov Company has grown and achieved high production activity indices despite challenging economic times. Honorable Company Collective has consistently represented Ukraine at the highest international forums, safeguarded its aviation potential in global markets, upheld high social standards, operated as an enterprise devoid of government subsidies, and is among the largest taxpayers in Ukraine. Notably, the Antonov An-70, An-148 and An-158, An-140, and An-178 have all been designed by Kiva.\nOn 18 June 2009, during the Paris Air Show, Dmytro Kiva and Bernard Charlès, President and CEO of Dassault Systèmes, inked a strategic alliance to expedite the adoption of the French company's most recent PLM products. According to him, Dassault Systèmes PLM systems have long since shown to be the greatest solution to the difficulties facing the aerospace sector. Kiva had been negotiating potential cooperation with the Russian government in December 2013. Production of the An-148 and An-158 was discussed. \nFrom 14 to 20 July 2014, in the vicinity of London, the Antonov Company showcased its contemporary programs at the Farnborough – 2014 exhibition. The delegation of Antonov, led by President and General Designer Dmytro Kiva, had many meetings and talks on the agenda, all aimed at fostering communication with European businesses and aircraft operators.\nThe government said in 2014 that Dmytro Kiva, the President–General designer of Antonov, will be removed. Workers for Antonov responded by marching into Kyiv and calling for his return. The company refuted rumors that he was relieved of his duties in a statement posted on the company's website on 14 August 2014. Workers also demanded that the company's leadership be led by Dmytro Kiva and that the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine's resolution No.18, dated 11 April 2014, be revoked. On 4 July, a group of honorary test pilots from Ukraine wrote an open letter to President Petro Poroshenko pleading with him to keep open the possibility of growing the aviation sector in their country and to reinstate Dmytro Kiva as chief designer.\nAccording to him in a June 2015 interview, Antonov would want to begin working with Poland since they have a lot of experience in one area and the Poles in another. Mikailo Hvozdev took over as Antonov's CEO in June 2016, although Kiva is said to have remained the company's chief designer. Later that year, he relocated from Kyiv to Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, to work on developing the country's aviation sector. He carefully considered his options and hoped to be able to carry out aviation initiatives that would benefit Azerbaijan.\n\n\n== Awards and recognitions ==\nKiva received the title of Hero of Ukraine in 2009 in recognition of his exceptional contributions to the growth of the national aviation industry and the country's economic potential. Kiva has received awards and recognitions such as:\n\n Hero of Ukraine Order of the State (12 July 2009)\n Order of Prince Yaroslav the Wise Fifth Class (22 June 2009)\n Order of Merit First Class (24 September 2004)\n Order of Merit Second Class (24 September 2001)\n Order of Merit Third Class (26 January 2008)\nOleh Kostiantynovych Antonov Prize of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine (2002)\nHonored Science and Technology Figure of Ukraine\nHonorary Citizen of Kyiv (2012)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "Cassandra Oil, formerly known as Eureka Oil, is a Swedish-based company that manufactures so-called reactors for extracting oil from various types of waste such as contaminated oil spills, plastic waste, and old car tyres. The company was listed on NASDAQ First North in the spring of 2012 but was delisted in the autumn of 2018. In 2024, Cassandra Oil was acquired by Nexergy Holdings PLC, valuing the company at approximately SEK 2.1 billion.  \n\n\n== History ==\nCassandra Oil was initially named Eureka Oil throughout 2011. It was later changed to Cassandra Oil due to a Norwegian oil company also named Eureka Oil. In the spring of 2012, Cassandra Oil was listed on NASDAQ First North through a so-called reverse listing where it took over the listing of Factum Electronics AB.The first mass-produced reactor, which was sold for EUR 4.5 million, was delivered to a facility in northern Iraq in 2013.When Cassandra Oil was listed on First North, a cooperation agreement was presented with the recycling company Ragn-Sells and the lime producer Nordkalk. The used tyres collected by Ragn-Sells would be converted into oil, which would be used by Nordkalk in its energy-intensive processes. However, Cassandra Oil and Ragn-Sells discontinued their collaboration in September 2016 due to a disagreement over commercial expansion terms and Cassandra's technology rights.In May 2017, an experiment went wrong, causing a fire at the factory in the Västerås harbor area. The company's founder and CEO, Anders Olsson, sustained minor injuries in the blaze, which took several hours for the emergency services to bring under control. In the autumn of 2018, Cassandra Oil was delisted from First North after Nasdaq's Disciplinary Committee concluded that the company had failed to provide information.In 2024, Cassandra Oil was acquired by Nexergy Holdings PLC, a British company investing in sustainable energy. The acquisition valued Cassandra Oil at approximately SEK 2.1 billion, with the shareholders receiving one share in Nexergy for each share in Cassandra.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "The 2013 Wisconsin Spring Election was held in the U.S. state of Wisconsin on April 2, 2013.  There were contested elections for justice of the Wisconsin Supreme Court and Superintendent of Public Instruction, as well as several other nonpartisan local and judicial elections.  In addition, the ballot contained a special election to fill a vacancy in the 98th Assembly district.  The 2013 Wisconsin Spring Primary was held February 19, 2013.\nIn the top two races, both parties claimed one victory.  For Wisconsin Supreme Court, the Republicans' preferred candidate, incumbent Patience Roggensack, was reelected.  For Superintendent, the Democrats' preferred candidate, incumbent Tony Evers, was also reelected.\nLater in the year, there were three more special elections, for the 21st, 69th, and 82nd Assembly districts.\n\n\n== State elections ==\n\n\n=== Executive ===\n\n\n==== Public Instruction ====\n\nA regularly scheduled election for Superintendent of Public Instruction of Wisconsin was held at the Spring general election, April 2, 2013.  Incumbent superintendent Tony Evers, first elected in 2009, won his second four-year term, defeating state representative Don Pridemore with 61% of the vote.\n\n\n=== Legislative ===\n\n\n==== State Assembly 98th district special election ====\nA special election was held concurrent with the regularly scheduled Spring election to fill the 98th district seat of the Wisconsin State Assembly.  The seat was vacated by Republican Paul Farrow, who had been elected to the Wisconsin Senate in the 2012 general election.  At the time of the special election, the 98th district was located in central Waukesha County, containing the city and village of Pewaukee, the village of Sussex, and the north side of the city of Waukesha.  It was considered a safe Republican district.\nNo Democrat registered to run for this seat in the special election. In the Spring primary, Republican Adam Neylon defeated Ed Baumann, Jeanne Tarantino, Matt Morzy, and Todd A. Greenwald, receiving 38.35% of the vote.  He went on to win the special election without a formal opponent on the ballot.\n\n\n==== State Assembly 21st district special election ====\nA special election was held November 19, 2013, to fill the 21st district seat of the Wisconsin State Assembly. The seat was vacated by Republican Mark Honadel, who resigned for a private sector job.  At the time of the special election, the 21st Assembly district was located in southeast Milwaukee County, containing the cities of Oak Creek and South Milwaukee, and a small part of the city of Franklin.  It was considered a moderately competitive Republican seat.\nIn the October 22 Republican primary, Jessie Rodriguez defeated Chris Kujawa, Ken Gehl, Larry Gamble, and Jason Red Arnold, receiving 48% of the vote.  She went on to defeat Democrat Elizabeth Coppola in the special election, receiving 56% of the vote.\n\n\n==== State Assembly 69th district special election ====\nA special election was held November 19, 2013, to fill the 69th district seat of the Wisconsin State Assembly. The seat was vacated by Republican Scott Suder, who resigned to accept a role at the Wisconsin Public Service Commission, though he ended up taking a lobbying job rather than the Public Service Commission appointment.  At the time of the special election, the 69th Assembly district comprised the eastern half of Clark County, along with parts of southwest Marathon County and northwest Wood County, including most of the city of Marshfield.  It was considered a safe Republican seat.\nIn the October 22 Republican primary, Bob Kulp defeated Alanna Feddick, Tommy Dahlen, and Scott Kenneth Noble, receiving 44% of the vote.  He went on to defeat Democrat Kenneth A. Slezak and independent Tim Swiggum in the special election, receiving 67% of the vote.\n\n\n==== State Assembly 82nd district special election ====\nA special election was held December 18, 2013, to fill the 82nd district seat of the Wisconsin State Assembly.  The seat was vacated by Republican Jeff Stone, who resigned to accept a role at the Wisconsin Public Service Commission.  At the time of the special election, the 82nd Assembly district was located in southwest Milwaukee County, comprising the village of Greendale, along with most of the city of Franklin and part of the city of Greenfield.  It was considered a likely Republican seat.\nIn the November 19 Republican primary, Ken Skowronski defeated Stephanie Mares, Shari Hanneman, and Steven C. Becker, receiving 50% of the vote.  He went on to defeat Democrat John R. Hermes in the special election, receiving 64% of the vote.\n\n\n=== Judicial ===\n\n\n==== State Supreme Court ====\n\nA regularly-scheduled Wisconsin Supreme Court election was held at the Spring general election, April 2, 2013.

Attorney Vince Megna was eliminated in the February primary.\n\n\n==== State Court of Appeals ====\nThree seats on the Wisconsin Court of Appeals were up for election in 2013. None were contested.\n\nIn District II, Judge Mark Gundrum, appointed by Governor Scott Walker in 2011, won a full six-year term without opposition.\nIn District III, Judge Gregory A. Peterson did not run for re-election and resigned before the election.  Eau Claire County circuit court judge Lisa K. Stark was elected to a six-year term without opposition.\nIn district IV, Judge Paul Lundsten, appointed by Governor Tommy Thompson in 2000, won his third six-year term without opposition.\n\n\n==== State Circuit Courts ====\nTwenty nine of the state's 249 circuit court seats were up for election in 2013.

        "content": "James Ross (11 January 1837 – 25 February 1892) was a Scottish physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nRoss was the third son of John Ross, a farmer, was born at Kingussie in the highlands of Scotland on 11 January 1837. He was sent to the parish school of Laggan, and thence to the Normal College for Teachers in Edinburgh, but soon went to study medicine at Aberdeen, where he graduated M.B. and C.M. with the highest honours in 1863, and M.D. in 1864. He made two voyages to Greenland in a whaler, practised as an assistant for two years, and then began general practice at Newchurch in Rossendale, Lancashire. He attained considerable success in the district. He wrote articles in the ‘Practitioner,’ and published in 1869 ‘On Counter Irritation,’ in 1872 ‘The Graft Theory of Disease, being an Application of Mr. Darwin's Hypothesis of Pangenesis to the Explanation of the Phenomena of the Zymotic Diseases,’ and in 1874 ‘On Protoplasm, being an Examination of Dr. James Hutchinson Sterling's criticism of Professor Huxley's Views,’ all essays of considerable ingenuity, but somewhat involved in statement. In April 1876 he removed to Manchester, and in August was appointed pathologist to the infirmary. Though late in beginning the practical work of pathology, he laboured in the post-mortem room with all the enthusiasm of youth, and in October 1878 was elected assistant physician to the infirmary. In 1881 he published ‘A Treatise on the Diseases of the Nervous System,’ in two large volumes, of which a second edition appeared in 1883. He begins by a classification of these diseases into three groups, Æsthesioneuroses, Kinesioneuroses, and Trophoneuroses, or changes of sensation, of motion, and of nutrition, and then describes the diseases of the several regions of the nervous system in detail. The book contains much recent information on the subject, and some original observations and hypotheses. It was the first large modern textbook in English on its subject and was widely read. It led to his election as a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1882. In 1885 he wrote a shorter ‘Handbook of Diseases of the Nervous System,’ which appeared in America, and in 1887 an essay on ‘Aphasia.’ He was elected professor of medicine in Owens College, Manchester, in 1887; and in 1888 became physician to the infirmary. In 1890 his last illness, which proved to be due to cancer of the stomach, began, and he died in Manchester on 25 February 1892. Besides numerous papers in medical journals and transactions on nervous diseases, he published in 1888 an address on evolution and in 1889 one on technical education He married, in 1869, Miss Bolton, niece of his predecessor in practice at Newchurch.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Moore, Norman (1897). \"Ross, James (1837-1892)\".

The span carries two lanes of traffic and a walkway, with a drawbridge for boat traffic in Back Bay.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first Popp's Ferry bridge was a deck girder swing bridge that opened for traffic in mid-December 1928.  The second Popp's Ferry Bridge was a bascule-type bridge built on the location of the 1928 span, opening to public traffic on April 11, 1953.The current Popp's Ferry Bridge replaced the previous span in 1979.  It was severely damaged by Hurricane Katrina in late August 2005, affecting nineteen sections of the concrete decking of the span, the draw, and the walkway.  Repairs were completed on December 23, 2005.On March 20, 2009, a tugboat pushing eight barges hit the bridge pilings.  No one was injured, but two ninety-foot (27 m) sections of the bridge dropped into the water. The bridge reopened to traffic on April 25, 2009.On July 14, 2020, the bridge was struck by a tugboat pushing three barges. It was closed to vehicle traffic for several hours.\n\n\n== See also ==\n Transport portal\n Engineering portal\n Mississippi portal\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nUSA Today, Bridge Inspections - POPPS FERRY ROAD over BACK BAY BILOXI\nWaterway Guide - Popps Ferry Road Bridge",

The elections were held for the role of Mayor of Porirua plus other local government positions including ten city councillors, also elected triennially. The polling was conducted using the standard first-past-the-post electoral method.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe incumbent Mayor, Whitford Brown, sought re-election for a third term. He was opposed by Rairi Christian Field, who had stood against Brown in 1962. He led an independent progressive ticket organised by the Progress for Porirua Association. Councillor Bill Arnold's wife, Maxine Arnold, was elected to the Porirua District Licensing Trust, believed to be the first woman in New Zealand to win a seat on a licensing trust. Two successful council candidates on election night (Alf Mexted and John Stewart Kenward) were unseated with the counting of late votes.\n\n\n== Mayoral results ==\n\n\n== Councillor results ==\n\nTable footnotes:\n\n\n== References ==",

He was admitted a member of the London College of Surgeons on 12 March 1812, and he subsequently entered the army, where he served as surgeon during the later years of the Peninsular war. He at length settled at Chigwell in Essex, and there practised for many years. He was admitted a member of the Royal College of Physicians in 1840, and in 1846 he moved into Golden Square, though he still continued to practise in Essex. He relinquished his country work about 1848, when he took the house in Cavendish Square in which he died on 25 January 1861. He was an honorary physician to the Royal Dramatic College and a member of the London Medical Society. He wrote:\n\n‘A Practical Treatise on the Nervous Diseases which are denominated Hypochondriasis,’ 2nd edit. 1841; 16th edit. 1860.\n‘On some Important Diseases of Females,’ London, 1844 (2nd edit. 1857).

        "content": "Bradfield Hall is an English country house. It is a historic Grade II* listed building. The house is located southwest of Bradfield, Berkshire in the hamlet of Rotten Row.\n\n\n== History ==\nBradfield Hall was built in the mid to late 18th century. Some sources give a date of 1764.\nThe house was most likely built for Stephen Wilson.\nThere is a row of four almshouses, located southeast of the house, that have a plaque on them stating \"'BRADFIELD POOR HOUSE ERECTED AT THE EXPENSE OF STEPHEN WILSON ESQ 1810 AND GIVEN BY HIM TO THE PARISH FOR EVER 1811\".\nWhen Wilson died in 1814, the house, along with properties on Whitehall in London and elsewhere went to his goddaughter, Katherine Stewart Connop, who was married to the Rev. John Connop.\nThe house remained in the Connop family until 1898, when the house and contents were sold. A variety of famous 18th-century carved Chippendale-style mahogany chairs, now known as the \"Bradfield Hall Chairs\", some now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art and some now at the Lady Lever Art Gallery, along with the so-called \"Barrington Bed\", now in the possession of the Victoria and Albert Museum, were auctioned at this time.\nAround 1900, the property passed into the hands of Arthur Radford, who had been Justice of the Peace of Derby, and whose family home had been at Smalley Hall in Derbyshire.\nThe Radfords held the house for the first half of the 20th-century. It remains in private hands.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nA large red brick house in a Georgian style. It has a \"curiously informal\" entrance. Was originally three storeys. The top floor incorporated Diocletian windows on either side of the center. This level was removed in around 1950 and then reinstated around 2006.\nThe saloon, two storeys high, has an oval ceiling painting attributed to Jean-François Clermont.\nThe house's mid-18th century stable block is Grade II listed. It has a pedimented design in red brick with grey headers.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRoyal Berkshire History – Bradfield\nHistoric England – Bradfield Hall",

        "content": "They Said (他们说) is the fourth solo album by Chinese singer and actress Han Xue, also known as Cecilia Han, released on 15 August 2012 by Gold Typhoon. Han Xue spent over five years working on the album, her first release since A Journey Into Fantasy in 2007, written and produced with the intent of shedding her \"girl next door\" image. \"Ephemera\" won the 20th Annual Top Chinese Music Awards for best song.\n\n\n== Writing and recording ==\nHan Xue wrote the lyrics for nine of the eleven songs. Albert Leung and Francis Lee contributed additional lyrics. In talking about the change in style of the album and the writing of her songs, she said she \"did not want to be a flower that is cared for and has the courage to create her own ideals\".\nHan Xue invited Albert Leung to write the Mandarin lyrics for \"Love Is a Fire\", an original song written by American writer Roxanne Seeman with Danish writers Claus Christensen, Per Lange, and Simon Munk, producer/writer. Before asking Leung, she was told he may not necessarily give her his time or his best songs but found, when she gave him her song, she received “Love Is a Fire”, the lyrics he wrote, quickly. The lyrics express the true and false feelings of love, between the flickering of light and shadow.\n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe MV for \"They Said\" premiered on the internet on August 23, 2012. Shooting a music video for Han Xue, a film and TV actress, looking into the camera and singing to express herself was a new experience. In one of the scenes, Han Xue stood in the center of a stage filled with shattered glass looking at reflections of herself which made her feel a little nervous.\n\n\n== Press conference ==\nOn August 16, 2012, Gold Typhoon held a press conference in Beijing announcing the signing of Han Xue with the release of They Said. Han Xue met with media across the country and put on a performance of songs from the album, including \"They Said\" and \"Ephemera\". The music video of \"Ephemera\" first aired at the press conference, premiering one week later.\nFor the press conference, the clothing was custom-made by Judyhua, fashion designer, with the theme of a butterfly, symbolizing rebirth and transformation after breaking out of the cocoon. Han Xue was presented with a special gift from Ms. Qi Yalei, the president of Gold Typhoon, of \"crystal shoes\", also symbolizing transformation and growth.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

The church and monastery are part of a high school, the Istituto Salesiano, run by the Salesian order.\n\n\n== History ==\nA Benedictine monastery was found at the site since 947. The church was rebuilt between 1491 and 1506 with designs by Pellegrino da Pontremoli, Bernardino Zaccagni and mastermason Angelo. The facade is sober and simple. Inside, are frescoes (1759) by Antonio Bresciani and Gaetano Ghidetti can still be seen in some of the side altars. The church has a single nave. In the late 16th century, the monastery was given to the Gesuati order by the Duke Ottavio Farnese. When that order was suppressed at the pope's behest in 1668, this became a parish church. The monastery became a refuge for fallen women.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "John Rushworth (1669 – 6 December 1736) was an English surgeon.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nRushworth was born in 1669, was son of Thomas Rushworth, vicar of St. Sepulchre, Northampton, during 1666, and afterwards vicar of Guilsborough in Northamptonshire. John qualified as a surgeon, and lived in Northampton, where he attained to considerable practice. He is eminent for the discovery of the efficacy of cinchona bark in cases of gangrene, a discovery which was utilised by John Ranby some years later. This discovery Rushworth first made known to Sir Hans Sloane in 1721, but he subsequently communicated it to the master and wardens of the Company of Barber-Surgeons for the use of the profession at large.\nRushworth shares with Garth the honour of being one of the first to suggest the foundation of infirmaries and dispensaries in the centre of every county and town, and he was especially earnest in endeavouring to carry this project into effect in Northamptonshire. But the infirmary for that county was not established till 1743, some six years after his death. Rushworth was especially desirous of advancing the surgical art, which he called the ‘ancientest and certainest part of physic.’ He died on 6 December 1736 and is buried in the church of All Saints, Northampton, where a tablet was placed in his memory, and to that of his wife Jane, heiress of Daniel Danvers of Northampton, doctor of medicine, and sister of Knightly Danvers, recorder of Northampton. She predeceased Rushworth on 3 July 1725.\nThe names of the ten children of the family are recorded on the tablet to the memory of the mother.\nRushworth published: \n\n‘The Case of the late James Keill, Dr. of Physic, represented by J. R.,’ Oxford, 8vo, 1719; reprinted in Beckett's ‘Tracts,’ p. 62.\n‘A Letter to the Mrs. or Governors of the Mystery and Commonalty of Barber-Surgeons,’ Northampton? 1731, 8vo.\n‘A Proposal for the Improvement of Surgery; offered to the Masters of the Mystery of Barbers and Surgeons at London,’ London, 1732, 8vo.\n‘Two Letters showing the great advantage of the Bark in Mortifications,’ London, 1732, 12mo.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Power, D'Arcy (1897). \"Rushworth, John (1669-1736)\".

        "content": "Bridge protection systems prevent ship collision damage to a bridge by either deflecting an aberrant ship from striking the piers of a bridge, or sustaining and absorbing the impact.\n\n\n== History ==\nProtecting bridges against ship collisions got attention of architects and regulators in the last third of the 20th century due to a marked increase in the frequency of collision accidents: worldwide, 30 major bridges collapsed in the 1960-1998 timeframe after being rammed by ships or barges, 321 persons were killed. The rate of smaller accidents is much higher: there were 811 serious accidents that did not cause a collapse just in the United States between 1970 and 1974, with 14 persons killed. Minor collisions are routine: the US Coast Guard gets 35 reports per day.\nIn the US, the turning point was the collapse of the Sunshine Skyway Bridge in 1980. Since then,\n\nA \"Committee on Ship/Barge Collision\" appointed by the National Research Council issued a report on the history of ship collisions with bridges (1983);\nThe Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development issued vessel collision protection criteria for the bridge piers in Louisiana (1984);\nEleven states together with the Federal Highway Administration commissioned guidelines for the bridge protection design in the United States (1988);\nThe American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) issued a Vessel Collision Design Guide Specification in February, 1991, based on the previous study;\nThe International Association for Bridge and Structural Engineering published its \"Ship Collision with Bridges\" guide in 1993;\nAASHTO adopted the LRFD bridge design specifications with provisions for bridge protection (1994).\n\n\n== Designs ==\nThere are several types of bridge protection systems used:\n\nFender systems attached to the pier with the goal to absorb the vessel impact. Their ability to withstand a typical ship collision is low. Fenders are built using a variety of materials:\nthin-walled concrete box;\nthin-walled steel membrane steel;\nrubber.\n \nartificial islands built with sand and rock core that is protected by riprap. The islands are quite effective in protecting the pier by pushing the ship away, but cause environmental damage to the river bottom and, while settling, might shift the bridge piers;\ndolphins are made of piles driven into the river bottom in a group, with space in between sometimes filled with rocks and capped with concrete. The collision is absorbed via deformations of the structure;\npile-supported systems on dedicated piles that are driven into the bottom either vertically or at an angle (\"batter piles\"). The piles are connected together with rigid or flexible links, can be attached to the pier, and sometimes are fitted with fenders;\nfloating systems (cable nets and pontoons) have multiple problems from low efficiency to high construction and maintenance costs and environmental impacts, and are therefore used as a last resort, when the location of the bridge precludes the use of other designs.\nStarlings are widenings of the  bridge piers near their base, typically extending some distance above water level, providing some degree of reinforcement of the pier against impact.\n\n\n== Alternatives ==\nPhysical bridge protection systems designed to prevent catastrophic collisions are expensive and represent a \"significant\" share of overall construction costs. Therefore, alternatives are typically considered during the design phase:\n\nfortifying the piers and superstructure to the point where they will be able to handle the impact, either on their own, or with the help of a fender system;\nincreasing the span length, so that the piers are away from the fairway and thus protected by the shallow water around them;\nimproving the navigational aids to reduce the probability of a catastrophic impact (60-85% of the collisions are due to pilot error.\n\n\n== Regulations ==\nHighway designs in the US are subject to the AASHTO specifications, but the text does not contain specific procedures and recommendations. Railway bridges are build according to the \"Manual for Railway Engineering\" published by the American Railway Engineering and Maintenance-of-Way Association (AREMA).\nIn Australia, the subject is covered in the Australian standard AS 5100.2:2017, \"Bridge design, Part 2: Design loads\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nKnott, Michael; Prucz, Zolan (2000). \"Vessel Collison Design of Bridges\".

Williams fought against Ric Flair in Flair's Madison Square Garden debut in April 1976. Continued working as a jobber with the WWWF throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s.\nWilliams most memorable moment in his career was an appearance on Piper's Pit on April 14, 1984. Being interviewed by Roddy Piper, Piper asks offensive questions and calls Williams a coward and a bad wrestler. Williams gets defensive by grabbing the microphone and said “I don’t run from nobody.” Piper then beats up Williams by pushing him out of the chair and through the curtain.\nAfter Piper's Pit, Williams worked in the WWF in 1984 and retired in 1985.\n\n\n== Death ==\nWilliams passed away from lung cancer on April 23, 1991. He was 51 years old.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nProfessional wrestling record for Frankie Williams from The Internet Wrestling Database\nFrankie Williams at IMDb",

        "content": "Ballarat Synagogue is a Modern Orthodox synagogue situated in Ballarat East in Victoria, Australia. It is the oldest continuously used synagogue in mainland Australia.  \n\n\n== History ==\nBritish Jews were among a flood of migrants that were drawn to the goldfields of Ballarat. European Jewry, escaping antisemitism at home, also settled in the city. Two groups of German Jewish migrants arrived in the 1850s, and 1860s, and again in the 1930s. Jewish refugees from pogroms in Eastern Europe arrived in the 1880s and 1890s.\nThe first minyan was established in 1853 for observing the High Holidays. The writer and Ballarat native, Nathan Spielvogel wrote a personal account:\n\n\"It is Tuesday evening, 11 October 1853, Tishri 9 5614. Clad in the red\nshirt and high boots of the digger the cantor who learned his chazonos\nin a far away Lemberg, solemnly and tunefully chants Oshmanu. The\nthoughts of the worshipped drift back to the homes and kindred they\nhave left behind on the other side of the world. With bowed heads\nthey follow his lead repeating with the chazzan his confession, beating\ntheir breasts as they had been taught in their distant house of worship\n… a remnant of Israel, albeit a very small one, proudly remembers\nKol Nidrei night.\"\nThe Ballarat Hebrew Congregation was founded in 1855 and it occupied a small synagogue building with a capacity for 200.The first synagogue was consecrated on 12 November 1855. Rev David Isaacs of Geelong was the first lay leader of the congregation. The congregation soon had to find a new home, as in 1856, the local Municipal Council reclaimed the land that the synagogue was built on, to house its Municipal Chambers.The larger, current building was consecrated in 1861. The British architect, TB Cameron designed the new synagogue, using a Neoclassical style.\nThe new site posed issues as squatters had claimed the land, paying taxes and rates. Therefore, the congregation had to buy out the squatters. The ark from the original synagogue is housed in the congregation's communal hall.\nAt the height of the goldrush, around twenty-five percent of Ballarat's shopkeepers were Jewish, many were members of the synagogue.\nThe congregation employed a permanent rabbi until 1943. For several decades, the synagogue was only open for High Holiday Services. However, since 2009, the synagogue hosts monthly Shabbat services.\nIn recent years, the synagogue underwent a $300, 000 AUD renovation. This was funded by Heritage Victoria, private donors and Jewish organisations in Melbourne.\n\n\n== Notable members ==\nNathan Spielvogel, a short-story writer. His parents married at the synagogue and he had his Bar Mitzvah there in 1887. He later served as President of the congregation.\nCharles Dyte, a Jewish parliamentarian and founding member\nNewman Rosenthal, academic and editor of The Australian Jewish Herald\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of synagogues in Australia and New Zealand\nHistory of the Jews in Australia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n37.86102009548239°S 144.99050071457705°E﻿ / -37.86102009548239; 144.99050071457705",

        "content": "Serpentovirinae, commonly known as serptentoviruses, is a virus subfamily within the family Tobaniviridae which is within the order Nidovirales. The virions of Serpentovirinae have a viral envelope and a positive-sense single-strand RNA genome. They infect vertebrates, mostly Ophidians, but sequencing has identified serpentovirinae infections in other reptiles including turtles, chameleons, and lizards. Although clinical significance varies across the clade, several pathogenic infections by this subfamily have been observed and studied, primarily in snakes with some observations in other groups. This subfamily comprises seven genera and 12 subgenera.\n\n\n== Transmission ==\nSerpentoviruses have exhibited fomite transmission and transmission via the air. One study showed that there is no vertical transmission; the eggs of a mating pair of infected pythons were positive for serpentovirinae RNA, but the hatchlings were RNA negative when tested.\n\n\n== Host susceptibility by phylogenetics ==\nPhylogenetic analysis has shown that the different genera and species of serpentovirinae infect specific groups of snakes, and that some species exclusively infect non-serpent reptiles. However, it is currently understood that pythonidae are the most susceptible to serpentovirus infection generally, with colubridae and boidae exhibiting the highest non-python-hosted species diversity. Additionally, sequencing of viral RNA from infected animals has shown the ability of serpentoviruses to become recombinant during replication. \n\n\n== Symptoms and diagnosis of infection ==\nThe symptoms of serpentovirus infections in reptiles are similar to some coronavirus symptoms in mammals (the coronaviridae family also belongs to the order Nidovirales). Symptoms include shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, increased oral mucous secretion, oral mucosal reddening, anorexia, and eventually weight loss. Serpentoviral infections have also been found to cause lesions in the upper respiratory tract, upper gastrointestinal tract, and even the lungs. These lesions are usually inflammed and pneumonic, and can cause greater complications and morbidity when the animal is also infected with bacterial bronchopneumonia.\nReverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction can be used to detect viral RNA and is the most common form of diagnosis. Oral/nasal swabs are used to obtain samples both pre- and post-mortem. It is also possible to detect virions and viral RNA within the stool of infected pythons due to nematode species being able to bioaccumulate the viruses. However, the nematodes themselves are not infected. Specific treatments and therapeutics have not yet been discovered or perscribed, but research is ongoing to determine best practices and potential therapeutics. \n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe subfamily Serpentovirinae contains the following seven identified genera and 12 identified subgenera:\n\nInfratovirus\nHepoptovirus, Selatovirus, and Xintolivirus\nLyctovirus\nChalatovirus and Rebatovirus\nPregotovirus\nRoypretovirus, Snaturtovirus, and Tilitovirus\nSectovirus\nSanematovirus\nSeptovirus\nSekatovirus\nSertovirus\nSerecovirus\nVebetovirus\nChabetovirus\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Fantastic Cat is an indie music supergroup consisting of Anthony D'Amato, Brian Dunne, Don DiLego, and Mike Montali. \n\n\n== History ==\nFantastic Cat was conceived as a project between Mike Montali (of Hollis Brown) and Don DiLego who wanted to form a \"four singer-songwriter\" group. The band claim's their name comes from a waitress in a bar who when asked what she would name a band responded with \"Fantastic Cat.\" Brian Dunne was brought in along with Mike Montali and Don DiLego to record the group's early music at DiLego's recording studio in the  Pocono Mountains, and Anthony D'Amato joined via recording remotely from his home in Colorado due to travel restrictions from the COVID-19 Pandemic. Artist Jane Beaird illustrated the band depicting them as anthropomorphic cats for the first EP record release in 2021, which has become reoccurring iconography in following releases by the group.\nFantastic Cat's first LP The Very Best of Fantastic Cat released in 2022, produced by Joe Poletto with Michael Hesslein, Tyler Rigdon, Randdy Schrager, and Andrew Zehnal as additional musicians. The cover art features the band members photographed by Shervin Lainez. The album cover's blurb parodies prior rock bands with multiple singer-songwriters claiming comically it had \"never been done\" before listing several famous supergroups such as The Beatles and The Highwaymen. Reviewer Jon Young for No Depression favorably compared the album's opening track \"C'mon Armageddon\" to Bob Dylan's \"Subterranean Homesick Blues\" and it's protest message against former US president Donald Trump. Reviewer Shawn Donohue made comparisons of the album to the music of Delta Spirit, Bruce Springsteen, Jackson Browne and Monsters of Folk. In an enthusiastic review for Americana Highways, critic John Moore stated \"If there is any justice in this world, this would be the first in a series of shows, followed by another record. Even the Traveling Wilburys gave us two albums (and The Highwaymen gave us three).\" Fantastic Cat would perform several songs from the album on CBS Saturday Morning in August 2022.\n\nFantastic Cat throughout 2023 would issue singles covering Warren Zevon's \"Keep Me in Your Heart\" and  Paul McCartney and Wings' \"Band on the Run\". A vinyl exclusive EP titled Live at The Bowery Ballroom was self-published by Fantastic Cat in 2023 with the humorous claim it was a \"Japanese import\" from a factory that was destroyed by Godzilla after pressing only 250 copies of the record.\nFantastic Cat announced their second LP Now That's What I Call Fantastic Cat in 2024 with the release of a music video for \"All My Fault\" parodying VHS dating services.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio Albums\n\nThe Very Best Of Fantastic Cat (2022)\nNow That's What I Call  Fantastic Cat (2024)\nEPs\n\nFantastic Cat EP (2021)\nLive at The Bowery Ballroom (2023)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Jeff Frumess is an American regional filmmaker, writer, and podcaster from Westchester, NY.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\nFrumess began his filmmaking journey after watching The Snowball Effect — a documentary chronicling the production of Kevin Smith's first feature film, Clerks. A string of short film experiments soon followed.\nInitially cutting his teeth with live music production and documentary work, Frumess made a shift into narrative feature films beginning with Romeo’s Distress. A second feature, Gouge Away, followed. Frumess is currently working on a third feature film, My Shadow.\n\n\n=== \"They Came From Lodi\" ===\nUpon returning home to New York, Frumess began working on a documentary project recording the history of the punk band The Misfits told through the eyes of those who surrounded the band, as well as their contemporaries and notable musicians who would draw great influence from the original 1977-1983 lineup. Since 2021, the project has undergone a vast revision in its scope and approach, with interviews and\nother materials still being gathered.\n\n\n=== Horror Punk (2011-2017) ===\nConducting interviews for They Came From Lodi introduced Frumess to the Horror Punk scene and the bands it represented. He teamed up with Sal Bee from Sardonica to start a YouTube show called Rock and Roll Cooking with Sal Bee. Various bands would come to Sal's house in Lodi, New Jersey, where he would cook a band-themed inspired meal followed by a song performance or two in the kitchen studio. Bands who appeared on the show included Doyle, Blitzkid, Nim Vind, The Jasons, The Independents, Stellar Corpses, Cancerslug, Whiplash, Cinema Cinema, Sardonica, Michale Graves, and Dr. Chud's X-Ward. The show was to feature Mister Monster and The Undead, but ended before the episodes could be taped.\n\n\n==== Michale Graves: Live at Europa (2012) ====\nIn late 2011, Ex-Misfits 95 frontman Michale Graves had assembled a whole new band as he was preparing to roll out new songs for his forthcoming LP. Informally dubbed the \"The Dumonts,\" this acoustic/electric lineup was taped for a live DVD with Frumess handling production duties. The show took place at Club Europa in Brooklyn on December 16, 2011. The release was eventually shelved over inconsistencies and dissatisfaction with the live performance itself.\n\n\n==== Blitzkid: Return to the Living (2012) ====\nFrumess accompanied Blitzkid on their farewell U.S. and European tours as a videographer doing 46 shows in 10+ countries from Moscow, Russia to Santa Cruz, California. The documentary that was to come out of the footage would serve as one part band history, one part road movie, and one part concert film. The film remains unfinished and will never be completed.\n\n\n==== Blitzkid: Live at Conne Island (2014) ====\nOn the Hellnights leg of the European tour, Blitzkid played Conne Island in Leipzig, Germany to a sold-out crowd. \nThe resulting show was recorded with four cameras with audio coming directly from the soundboard, which Frumess used to produce a feature-length concert film to release as a limited edition DVD for Kickstarter pledges of the Return to the Living Documentary Kickstarter campaign.\n\n\n==== Long Live the Horror (2018) ====\nWhen Blitzkid: Return to the Living failed to materialize, Frumess took the footage he shot surrounding the Horror Punk festival Ghouls Night Out at Dingbatz in Clifton, NJ and produced another feature length concert film. The live footage used was originally envisioned to be the third act of Blitzkid: Return to the Living.\nThe resulting material was turned into Long Live the Horror. It was intended for horror punk fans who contributed to crowdfunding campaigns for both Blitzkid: Return to the Living and another unassociated project, Ghouls Night Out that was separately helmed by its concert promoter, Matt Pathetic. Since Blitzkid had played their last U.S. show at the Ghouls Night Out festival, Long Live the Horror was intended to serve as something for all parties affected. The feature film was intended to be released exclusively for free on YouTube but currently remains shelved. A hard drive with a copy was stolen and never recovered.\n\n\n=== Romeo’s Distress (2017) ===\nInspired by Jeremy Gardner's The Battery, Frumess set out to make his true directorial debut with a no-budget narrative feature in August 2014. Romeo's Distress is a gothic, neo-noir horror film that takes its name from the Christian Death song of the same name. The film follows a creepy man named James, his unrequited love for a beautiful girl named Jane, and her father's sadistic response to it all.\nThe film had its world premiere at the Macabre Faire Film Festival in January 2017, where it was nominated for Best Feature Film, Best Feature Film Director, and winning Best Feature Film Screenplay. Romeo’s Distress was also nominated for Best Feature Film Screenplay at Nightmares Film Festival and winner of the Esprit De Gore independent Spirit Award.\nKieran Fisher of Dread Central called it \"the personification of a passion project, a smorgasbord of influences ranging from avant-garde cinema, Gothic literature, punk rock and more.\"\nDave J. Wilson of Diabolique Magazine wrote, \"Romeo’s Distress is a unique and intriguing oddity. A strange arthouse experimentation seamlessly melded together with an energetic genre-bending pastiche of creativity, the film is an engaging character study that is a darkly comical and ultimately bleak exploration of the dark side of love.\"\nKevan Farrow of Scream Magazine said, \"Romeo’s Distress mixes more highbrow influences with an idiosyncratic, almost mischievous oddness and, like its troubled protagonist, walks its own path, unswayed by more 'respectable' trends. Atmospherically dense, gleefully oddball, and relentlessly unnerving.\"\n\n\n=== The Transformations of the Transformations of the Drs. Jenkins (2021) ===\nIn late 2020, Frumess directed a segment along with a slew of other filmmakers for the almost unclassifiable The Transformations of the Transformations of the Drs. Jenkins. To call Jenkins a mockumentary would be as wildly accurate as it is inaccurate: Determined to create the ultimate pandemic movie, filmmakers recruit 20 of their friends to each shoot a segment of their art film. A lot goes wrong.\nCreating a unique kind of anthology film showcasing the creativity of 20 different filmmakers (each given no direction and only one rule: use only what you have on hand), combined with an engaging and side-splittingly funny wraparound about the making of the film, the result is an enormously entertaining midnight movie that doubles as a highlight reel for some of the best indie talent working in the genre. - Stephanie Malone, Morbidly Beautiful\n\n\n=== Gouge Away (2023) ===\nOn April 21, 2021, Frumess began work on what would become his second narrative feature-length film, Gouge Away. The film is a sequel to a previously incomplete film called Wash Away (2020). Gouge Away had its world premiere at midnight, Saturday, September 3, 2022, at the GenreBlast Film Festival at the Alamo Drafthouse in Winchester, VA, and winner of the GenreBlast Forever Independent Spirit Award.\n\nB&S About Movies said: Tony the Stamper uncovers a nasty secret when his mentor Stanley Pedious goes missing as a hazardous narcotic gas is unleashed upon the streets of the city. That’s a basic description for a movie that goes absolutely wild and eventually becomes nearly indescribable and I’m using that as a compliment. This movie is a real journey through whippets and stronger inhalants, as well as a neo-noir underground and yoga breathing if that makes sense and I think it does. It’s definitely something different and works hard to create its own universe that you can’t help but sit back and watch unfold.\nGiallo Julian of Dread Central wrote, \"Sounds like the beginning of a Creepypasta, doesn’t it?\"\n\nRJ Bland from You've Got Red on You wrote: The plotting may be simplistic and nothing you've not seen before, yet we somehow go into every scene unsure of how it’s going to play out. Think David Lynch but on acid. The scenarios our hero gets into and some of the people he meets are straight out of left field. When your character list contains names such as Lord Fungus, Pickles Zanetti, Uncle Faceneck, and The White Hotdog, you know you’re in for a bit of a trip.\"\nS. Michael Simms of Morbidly Beautiful said, \"We basically have a crime drama with comedic elements, with the style of comedy in this awkward limbo between Napoleon Dynamite and Beverly Hills Cop.\"\n\n\n=== Kuyashii Gonzo: Blood Visions and Chaos Magic (2024) ===\nKuyashii Gonzo: Blood Visions and Chaos Magic is a Gonzo documentary in a similar vein to American Movie (1999). It started life as a behind-the-scenes featurette for the upcoming Blu-ray release of Gouge Away, until a larger story revealed itself and broadened the scope.\nOver a hundred of hours of video diaries and behind-the-scenes footage spanning nearly two decades were utilized in telling the story of the incomplete film, Wash Away, and its Corman-esque resurrection-turned-transformation into its own continuing sequel-like story, Gouge Away.\nWash Away initially fell apart when production halted in April 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The revenge thriller was originally about a therapist named Stanley who is given the opportunity for nefarious indulgence and retaliation against a former nemesis who ruined his life years prior.\n\n\n=== My Shadow ===\nFollowing the premiere of Gouge Away at the GenreBlast Film Festival, Frumess began work on My Shadow, a new screenplay for an old idea called Dead Dog Robert. It is envisioned as Frankenstein by way of Pet Semetary via Little Shop of Horrors.\nThe synopsis follows Robert, a painter, who struggles with the sudden demise and grisly resurrection of his best friend — a Rabbit named Shadow. Now, all Robert wants to do is take the-girl-next-door Sydney to the Jovial Halloween Ball and have a good time. But it's hard to have fun when your best friend aspires to be a rock n roll singer and won't stop eating the people you know.\nThe story is named after the song \"My Shadow\" by Jay Reatard. Preproduction is set to begin in 2024.\n\n\n== Podcasting and YouTube ==\nIn March 2020, while in quarantine at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Frumess began to livestream filibuster about music, film, and history. Soon, live interviews began with musicians and filmmakers. The streams initially started on Facebook before moving to YouTube. The shows are typically long, passionate, unscripted, and interactive.\n\n\n== Selected filmography ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Frumess\" website\nJeff Frumess at IMDb",

        "content": "\"Yet Another Day\" is a song by Dutch disc jockey and producer Armin van Buuren. It is a remix of Scottish singer and guitarist Ray Wilson's song \"Another Day\" taken from his first studio album, Change, realised after his works with Stiltskin and Genesis. It was released as 12\" vinyl and CD single in the Netherlands on 23 October 2002 by Armind. It is the second single from van Buuren's first studio album, 76.\nFor his shows, Van Buuren created the famous \"Armin van Buuren Mash-Up\" of the song mixed with DJ Tiësto's \"Suburban Train\" and known officially as \"Yet Another Suburban Train\" or simply \"Another Suburban Train\".\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe lyrics of the song are dedicated to one of Wilson's friends who committed suicide. He declared: \"I wrote this for a school friend who killed himself. I tried to imagine what he must have been thinking to do such a thing. Was he in need of a better life? And dying to see another day? I tried to get inside a suicidal mind and write from that perspective, if that is possible.\"\n\n\n== Music video ==\nA music video to accompany the release of \"Yet Another Day\" was released in 2002. It features Ray Wilson. He commits suicide by exhibiting himself under the sunlight to burn his clothers. Then, he walks in the street surrounded by flames. He ends up dying next to a car driven by Armin van Buuren.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nNetherlands – 12\" – Armind (ARM014)\n\"Yet Another Day\" (Original Mix) – 10:18\n\"Yet Another Day\" (Sunday 5PM Mix) – 8:40\nNetherlands – CD single – Armind (ARM014-3)\n\"Yet Another Day\" (Radio Edit) – 3:27\n\"Yet Another Day\" (Riva Edit) – 3:44\nNetherlands – CD single – Armind (ARM014-9)\n\"Yet Another Day\" (Vocal Edit) – 3:32\n\"Yet Another Day\" (Riva Edit) – 3:44\n\"Yet Another Day\" (Original Mix) – 10:18\n\"Yet Another Day\" (Video Clip) – 3:51<\nNetherlands – Remixes Part 1 - 12\" – Armind (ARMD015)\n\"Yet Another Day\" (Riva Remix) – 8:51\n\"Yet Another Day\" (Rising Star Remix) – 8:37\nNetherlands - Remixes Part 2 - 12\" - Armind (ARMD016)\n\"Yet Another Day\" (Yet Another Dub) – 8:17\n\"Yet Another Day\" (Hiver & Hammer's Ground Control Remix) – 9:17\nGermany - 12\" - Zeitgeist\n\"Yet Another Day\" (Original Mix) – 10:21\n\"Yet Another Day\" (Sunday 5PM Mix) – 8:40\n\"Yet Another Day\" (Riva Remix) – 8:42\nGermany - Remixes - 12\" - Zeitgeist\n\"Yet Another Day\" (Hiver & Hammer's Ground Control Remix) – 9:19\n\"Yet Another Day\" (Riva Remix) – 8:45\n\"Yet Another Day\" (Riva Dub) – 8:26\nUK - 12\" - Nebula (NEBT042)\n\"Yet Another Day\" (Original Mix) – 10:18\n\"Yet Another Day\" (Riva Remix) – 8:42\nUK - CD single - Nebula (NEBCD042)\n\"Yet Another Day\" (Radio Edit) – 3:42\n\"Yet Another Day\" (Riva Remix) – 5:29\n\"Yet Another Day\" (Hiver & Hammer's Ground Control Remix) – 5:48\n\"Yet Another Day\" (DJ Shah Remix) – 5:08\nUK - Remixes - 12\" - Nebula (NEBTX042)\n\"Yet Another Day\" (Hiver & Hammer's Ground Control Remix) – 9:16\n\"Yet Another Day\" (DJ Shah Remix) – 8:23\nUK - Attention Deficit Mixes - 12\" - Nebula (NEBTXX042)\n\"Yet Another Day\" (Attention Deficit Adderrol Session) – 8:55\n\"Yet Another Day\" (Attention Deficit Multi Task Remix) – 9:09\nUS - 12\" - Ultra (UL1157-6)\n\"Yet Another Day\" (Original Mix) – 10:18\n\"Yet Another Day\" (Riva Remix) – 8:42\nUS - Digital download - Ultra (UL1157)\n\"Yet Another Day\" (Radio Edit) – 3:31\n\"Yet Another Day\" (Riva Radio Edit) – 3:43\n\"Yet Another Day\" (Original Mix) – 10:18\n\"Yet Another Day\" (Riva Remix) – 8:48\n\"Yet Another Day\" (Sunday 5PM Remix) – 8:44\n\"Yet Another Day\" (Rising Star Remix) – 8:42\n\"Yet Another Day\" (Attention Deficit Adderrol Session) – 9:06\n\"Yet Another Day\" (Attention Deficit Multi Task Remix) – 9:20\n\"Yet Another Day\" (Hiver & Hammer Ground Control Dub) – 9:49\n\"Yet Another Day\" (DJ Shah Remix) – 8:33\n\"Yet Another Day\" (Yet Another Dub) – 8:20\n\"Yet Another Day\" (Riva Dub) – 8:27\n\"Yet Another Day\" (Armin's Downtempo Radio Edit) – 4:11\n\"Yet Another Day\" (Armin's Downtempo Extended Mix) – 8:53\n\"Yet Another Day\" (Armin's Downtempo Instrumental Radio Edit) – 4:12\n\"Yet Another Day\" (Armin's Downtempo Extended Instrumental Mix) – 8:54\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "James Johnstone (1730? – 28 April 1802) was a Scottish physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nJohnstone was born about 1730 at Annan, Dumfriesshire, and studied medicine at Edinburgh, chiefly under Robert Whytt, graduating M.D. in 1750. After a visit to Paris he settled at Kidderminster in 1751, and continued there until 1783, when he removed to Worcester, shortly after the death of his son James (see below). He was a good scholar and antiquary, a friend of Bishop Hurd and of George, lord Lyttelton, of whose deathbed he gave ‘a very affecting and instructive account’ (Johnson, Lives of the Poets). He practised as a physician in Worcester almost to the day of his death, 28 April 1802. His epitaph in the cathedral was composed by Dr. Parr. He married Hannah, daughter of Henry Crane of Kidderminster. Of his five sons, three, James the younger, Edward, and John, also of Birmingham, became physicians.\nJohnstone's first work was on ‘The Malignant Epidemical Fever of 1756,’ London, 1758, with other observations from his Kidderminster practice since 1752. It is interesting for its account of instances of putrid or malignant sore throat among the cases of typhus, a phenomenon which had been first described in a famous essay by Fothergill for London in 1748, and after him by Le Cat for Rouen previous to 1755, and by Huxham for Plymouth in 1757. The same subject was afterwards treated by Johnstone's son James. The other point of interest in the essay of 1758 was the casual notice, among other disinfectants for typhus, of the ‘thick white steam’ of muriatic acid set free by pouring small quantities of vitriol from time to time upon common salt heated in a chafing-dish of coals. The same disinfectant having been formally advocated in 1802 before a committee of the House of Commons, of which Wilberforce was chairman, a question of priority arose between Dr. John Johnstone, on behalf of his late father, and Dr. Carmichael Smyth, each of whom wrote a pamphlet (1803 and 1805) preferring his respective claim. Besides writing on fevers, Johnstone wrote, with sound knowledge of the physiology of muscle and nerve (as taught by Whytt), upon ‘The Use of the Ganglions of the Nerves’ (Shrewsbury, 1771, German translation by C. F. Michaelis, Stettin, 1787), his theory having been originally communicated to the Royal Society in two papers (Phil. Trans. liv. 177, lvii. 118). The theory was that the ganglia of the sympathetic nerve ‘rendered the movements of the heart and intestine uniformly involuntary,’ a fact which he considered to be inexplicable by any peculiarity of their muscular structure. Another medical piece was on the medicinal water of Walton, near Tewkesbury, and its curative power in scrofula, with some remarks on the uses of the lymphatic glands (two editions, 1787 and 1790). In 1789 he published ‘A Second Dialogue of the Dead, between Fernan Cortez and William Penn, to which is added a Scheme for the Abolition of Slavery.’ In 1795 he issued ‘Medical Essays and Observations, with Disquisitions on the Nervous System, and Essay on Mineral Poisons’ (Evesham).\n\nJames Johnstone the younger (1754–1783), physician, the eldest son, born at Kidderminster in August 1754, commenced in 1770 the study of medicine at Edinburgh. Upon being admitted a member of the Medical Society of Edinburgh he distinguished himself by his papers and in the debates, and was honourably noticed by his professors, particularly by Dr. Cullen and Dr. Gregory; to the last he acted as clinical clerk in preparing cases for the lectures at the infirmary. He graduated M.D. at Edinburgh in September 1773. His thesis, ‘De Angina Maligna,’ was recommended to the attention of physicians by Dr. Cullen. It was republished at Worcester in 1779 in an English translation, with considerable additions and some remarks on the angina trachealis. In the summer of 1774 Johnstone was chosen physician to the Worcester Infirmary. When called upon by the county magistrates to visit the prisons where many laboured under gaol fever, he cheerfully undertook the task, but caught the infection and died on 16 August 1783.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Creighton, Charles (1892). \"Johnstone, James (1730?-1802)\".

        "content": "Sigrid Friis Frederiksen (nee Proschowsky; born 20 October 1994) is a Danish politician who is the former chairman of Radikal Ungdom. She is also a blogger for Altinget.dk and BT. She also sits on both the executive committee and the main board of the Danish Social Liberal Party. In September 2023, she was chosen to be her party's lead candidate for the 2024 European Parliament election in Denmark.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nSigrid Friis Frederiksen (born Sigrid Friis Proschowsky) was born and raised in Hillerød. She graduated from N. Zahle's School in 2014 and at the same time received Dr. Bach's memorial grant for special commitment to the subject of history. She has studied political science at the University of Copenhagen and in 2018 became a bachelor in the subject after writing an assignment on the democratic participation of young people in connection with the school elections.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nSigrid Friis became a member of Radikal Ungdom in 2013 and in 2015 was given a seat on the executive committee with responsibility for International Cooperation. She participated in the election campaign for the Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton in the 2016 United States presidential election. Internationally, she has engaged in cooperation across parties through the Nordiska Centerungdommens Forbund (NCF) in the Nordic region, the European Liberal Youth (LYMEC) on a European level and the International Federation of Liberal Youth (IFLRY) on a global level.\nIn Denmark, she won 2nd place at the \"DM in Debate 2017\".  She has introduced the concept of EU-fori and was dubbed the \"Debat Fairy\" by Søs Marie Seerup. Additionally she is a commentator in newspapers and has, among other things, criticized the Danish royal family and the Burka ban.\nShe took over the position as national chairman of the youth party in August 2017 replacing Victor Boysen. As national chairman, she brought Radikal Ungdom into the work with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. In September 2018, she was appointed as dialogue ambassador for the Danish Youth Joint Council. In this role, worked actively with young people to promote understanding across cultures under the mission statement, \"Strengthen and engage young people\".\nShe has won the award \"Woman of Europe\" from the European Movement International and the European Women's Lobby. She won the prize for her work in engaging young people in Europe in Denmark and for playing with the rhetoric about the EU.\nSince 2017, she has been followed by the video documentarian, Lise Birk Pedersen, for a generational portrait of young politicians.\n\n\n=== 2024 European Parliament candidacy ===\nSigrid Friis Frederiksen was nominated by her party as a new MEP candidate in 2022. Karen Melchior had previously been nominated in this constituency. In 2023, Morten Helveg Petersen, who has represented the party in the European Parliament since 2014, announced that he did not intend to stand again in the upcoming election.\nAt the national meeting of the Danish Social Liberal Party from 16 to 17 September 2023, the delegated party members voted for Frederiksen to be the new lead candidate. She was chosen ahead of several prominent names such as Rasmus Helveg and Anne Sophie Callesen. After being chosen she said afterwards: \"I think they have chosen me because I emphasize that we are the party for the next generation. That the climate battle must be fought by new forces, and I can be at the forefront of lifting that that task.\"\n\n\n== Political views ==\n\n\n=== #MeToo ===\nIn 2020, Frederiksen alongside, Freja Fokdal, Maria Gudme and Camilla Søe took the initiative to #enblandtos. The movement #enblandtos refers to 322 women across political parties who signed a debate paper on sexism in Danish politics. The article, as well as 79 anonymous testimonies about boundary-crossing behaviour, was published in Politiken on 25 September 2020. The four signatories described it as saying that the appeal should establish that sexism exists in the political parties and that it is a common problem that requires action. The hashtag #enblandtos is seen as part of the 2nd wave of the MeToo movement in Denmark, which was started by a speech by Sofie Linde at the Zulu Comedy Gala.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Manuel Allende Riverós (8 March 1887 – 10 August 1944) was a Uruguayan businessman and sports leader. He was the 9th president of RCD Espanyol between 1918 and 1919. On a professional level, he was a maritime merchant who became rich during the First World War by transporting groceries across the Atlantic Ocean, thanks to a fleet of more than 70 ships.\n\n\n== Professional career ==\nDuring the First World War, Allende founded an important merchant fleet with more than 70 units, for the transportation of supplies from Spanish America, especially Argentina and Uruguay, to Spain. Later, he moved to the latter, where his commercial operations were guaranteed by different banking establishments, but when the Armistice of 11 November 1918 occurred, unexpectedly, Allende suffered such a tremendous economic collapse that he was ruined along with his family collaborators. In recognition of his efforts to promote commercial relations between Uruguay and other South American countries with Spain, the Spanish Government awarded him the Grand Cross of Naval Merit in 1919.\nAllende was the founder of the Madrid newspaper El Fígaro (1918–1920), appointing the Catalan textile industrialist José María de Boét and his brother, Andrés Boét, to the management. He also founded and financed the literary magazine Cosmópolis (1919–1922). He founded the Allende Insurance Company, located at Plaça de Catalunya, no. 7 in Barcelona.\n\n\n== Presidency of RCD Espanyol ==\nAllende was appointed as the 9th president of RCD Espanyol in the meeting of 6 June 1918, replacing José María Bernadas. In both South America and in Spain, he practiced several sports, especially football, to the point of being classified in Uruguay as an international player. Under his leadership, he created the athletics section of the RCD Espanyol in 1918 and was part of the council superior of the Catalan Athletics Federation.\nHis mandate was marked by a very tense political-social situation since at the end of the war, the controversy over the autonomy of Catalonia intensified, generating demonstrations against the monarchy. All of this triggered an anti-Catalanist campaign on the one hand and pro-independence on the other. The radicalization created an unfortunate atmosphere among the supporters of RCD Espanyol and the club was the target of strong attacks for the mere fact of bearing the name it bore. Because of this situation, in the middle of June 1919, the La Riva family returned to the management of the club, this time in the person of Victorià de la Riva as the new president.\n\n\n== Death ==\nDespite being born and raised in Uruguay, Allende was always a great friend of Spain, expressing his affection on repeated occasions. During his later years, he resided in Barcelona, but then moved to a clinic in Lloret de Mar, due to having contracted a serious illness, which led to fears of the fatal outcome that eventually occurred. Allende died in Lloret de Mar on 10 August 1944, at the age of 57. When the death occurred, the Consul General of Uruguay in Barcelona, Alberto Montalbo de León, took charge of the body of Allende, presiding over the funeral obsequies. Although he had some relatives in Uruguay, it was his wish to be buried in a pantheon in the Lloret de Mar Cemetery, instead of being transferred to his country.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Martín de Zalba (c. 1337 – 27 October 1403) was a Navarrese cleric and statesman who served as the chancellor of the kingdom from 1376 until 1396 and as the bishop of Pamplona from 1377 until his death. From 1390, he was also a cardinal of the Avignon obedience.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nMartín was born around 1337 in Pamplona into a merchant family originally from Zalba. His primary schooling took place in the cathedral of Pamplona. He attended the universities of Toulouse, Bologna and Avignon, where he obtained his doctorate in laws in 1365. He had knowledge of several languages. According to Dietrich of Niem, he taught canon law at Avignon.\nMartín received his first canonry in 1363 and came to hold various canonries throughout Spain. During the episcopate of Jean de Saie (r. 1363–1375), he served as the vicar general of the diocese of Dax, which covered the Navarrese territory of Ultrapuertos. In 1373, he became the dean of Tudela. In 1375, he was placed in charge of the parish of San Martín de Unx with the rank of deacon while residing at the Avignonese curia. In 1376, King Charles II of Navarre appointed him chancellor, a largely honorific position by that time.\n\n\n== Bishop and schism ==\nOn 16 December 1377, Martín was appointed bishop of Pamplona. Having been appointed a referendary by Pope Gregory XI, he remained in Avignon and governed his diocese through two vicars general, Ferrando Ibáñez de Huarte and García Martínez de Larraga, both with legal training. He was one of the papal delegates to the peace conference held in Sarzana in March 1378 to end the War of the Eight Saints. On 19 April 1378, the newly crowned Pope Urban VI accused the bishops resident at the curia of being perjurers. According to Dietrich of Niem, among the bishops present, only Martín spoke out in their defence.\nMartín's reputation for learning and sanctity is well attested in accounts of the start of the Great Schism in 1378. There are conflicting accounts of his role the early days. According to Martín de Alpartil, the dissident cardinals gathered at Anagni intending to freely confirm the election of Urban VI. They sent Martín to mediate, but Count Nicola Orsini convinced Urban to refuse. According to Cardinal Bertrand Lagier, Martín denounced Urban to his face and the pope tried to have him killed at Subiaco, but only succeeded in wounding and robbing him. Martín returned to Avignon under the Antipope Clement VII.\n\n\n== Return to Navarre ==\nOn 1 October 1379, Martín returned to Navarre. He was met at the border by the king and other notables. He argued the cause of Clement VII, but did not convince Charles II away from a position of neutrality. He attended the assembly of Medina de Campo in 1380–1381 and served Charles II on diplomatic missions to King John I of Castile and Count Gaston III of Foix. In 1384–1387, he was back in Avignon. In 1385, he received a papal bull confirming Pamplona's exemption from metropolitan authority. From 1387 to 1393, he resided in Pamplona, where he held a diocesan synod, set up a court of Inquisition and defended his diocese's rights in Montearagón and Guipúzcoa.\nCharles II was succeeded by Charles III and in April 1388 Martín led an embassy on his behalf to King Charles VI of France to negotiate the restoration of lands confiscated from Charles II during the Hundred Years' War. Other members of the delegation include Francisco de Villaespesa and Pedro de Laxague.\nIn 1390, Martín secured the recognition of Clement VII by Charles III. On 10 July, there was a partial collapse in the Romanesque cathedral. Martín cooperated with the king to repair it in the Gothic style.\n\n\n== Cardinal ==\nOn 23 July 1390, Clement VII rewarded Martín's successful diplomacy by naming him cardinal priest of San Lorenzo in Lucina. He was ceremonially robed as a cardinal in the cathedral of Pamplona on 25 September. He was popularly known as the Cardinal of Pamplona. In 1393, he returned to Avignon, where he would thereafter reside permanently. When Clement VII was succeeded by Benedict XIII later that year, Martín remained loyal to the Avignon line. In a meeting in the papal palace in Avignon on 8 July 1395, he was the only cardinal who refused to demand Benedict XIII's resignation. Howard Kaminsky notes that while Martín's \"independence may have been reinforced by the fact that most of his benefices ... lay in Navarre, it was actually a personal trait,\" plainly in view in his interactions with Urban VI in 1378.\nIn 1396, Martín was succeeded as chancellor of Navarre by Francisco de Villaespesa. In 1398, he was briefly imprisoned when the inhabitants of Avignon besieged the cardinals in the palace. He afterwards moved into exile in Arles. He died at Salon in southern France on 27 October 1403 and was buried in the Chartreuse de Bonpas.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==",

He has amassed a following of more than 5 million followers on Facebook Instagram and X (formerly Twitter) combined as of March 2024.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nRogan O'Handley was born in California in either 1985 or 1986. O'Handley graduated magna cum laude from Northeastern University, double-majoring in Criminal Justice and Political Science. There, he was elected president of his student government, and was a member of the Kappa Sigma fraternity. He later earned a Juris Doctor from University of Chicago Law School. He practiced law in the Hollywood area for 6 years, specializing in entertainment law. After the 2016 United States presidential election, he started an Instagram account under the pseudonym \"DC Draino\", an allusion to the phrase \"drain the swamp\" commonly used by Donald Trump. After the account started to gain traction, he decided to quit his job as attorney and make social media content full-time. He eventually moved to South Florida, where he founded a digital media company. He has since made appearances on Tucker Carlson Tonight, and has been a prominent speaker at an event hosted by the Log Cabin Republicans, despite his content being labeled by some as anti-LGBT.He has been mentioned as a potential candidate for Florida's 15th congressional district in 2024, reportedly telling Lee County Republican Party Chairman Michael Thompson that he \"has not ruled anything out\" after Donald Trump called for a primary challenger to incumbent representative Laurel Lee.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Edward Johnstone (26 September 1757 – 4 September 1851) was an English physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nJohnstone was born at Kidderminster on 26 September 1757, was son of James Johnstone, M.D, and brother of John Johnstone (1768–1836). He was educated at the Kidderminster grammar school, and proceeded to the university of Edinburgh, where he graduated M.D. 14 June 1799. His inaugural thesis, ‘De Febre Puerperali,’ was published, and was praised by M. de Ponteau, the eminent French surgeon. In the autumn of 1799 Johnstone was elected one of the first physicians of the Birmingham General Hospital. He was a zealous supporter of the dispensary for supplying medical and surgical attendance to the sick poor at their own homes, as well as an active and munificent patron of every useful and charitable institution. When the plan for the medical school, afterwards Queen's College, was matured in 1827, he became president, and during a period of eighteen years was never absent from the meetings of the council. In 1836 the council deviated from its usual course by fixing its anniversary meeting on his eightieth birthday. He was the first principal of Queen's College. In 1844 the council and professors presented his portrait to the college, and on his retirement in 1845 he was warmly thanked for his services. In 1840 he helped to found the Queen's Hospital in Birmingham, and was honorary physician till his death.\nHe died at Edgbaston Hall, near Birmingham, on 4 September 1851, and was buried in Edgbaston Old Church on 10 Sept. He married Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Pearson of Tettenhall, Staffordshire; she died in 1823.\nThe eldest son, Johnstone, Edward (1804–1881), claimant of Annandale peerage, born at Ladywood House, near Birmingham, 9 April 1804, was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. in 1825, and proceeded M.A. in 1828. He was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn on 6 May 1828, and went the Oxford circuit. He migrated to the Inner Temple, where he was admitted a student on 24 April 1838, and called soon after. With the poet Campbell, Lord Dudley Stuart, Lord Ilchester, and others, he in 1832 founded the Literary Association of the Friends of Poland, and in 1836 published a pamphlet abridged and translated from ‘La Pologne et ses frontières,’ by the Marquis de Noailles, entitled ‘What is Poland? a question of Geography, History, and Public Law.’ He inherited the estates of Fulford Hall, Warwickshire, and Dunsley manor, Staffordshire. On 28 May 1876, in opposition to Sir Frederick Johnstone of Westerhall and Mr. John James Hope-Johnstone, he claimed in the House of Lords the dormant marquisate of Annandale, but the claims of all three petitioners were dismissed in 1881 on the ground of non-conclusive evidence. Johnstone died unmarried at Worcester on 20 Sept. 1881, and was buried in the family burial-place at Edgbaston. He was succeeded in his property by his nephew, Colonel Sir James Johnstone, K.C.S.I.\nThe second son, Johnstone, James (1806–1869), physician, born at Edgbaston Hall, near Birmingham, on 12 April 1806, matriculated from Trinity College, Cambridge in 1819, graduated M.B. 1828, M.L. 1830, and M.D. 1833, and became a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, London, in 1834. After studying in Edinburgh, Paris, and London, he settled in Birmingham, where he was appointed the first professor of materia medica and therapeutics at Queen's College in 1841, and extraordinary physician to the General Hospital, a post which he held for more than thirty years. On the visit of the British Medical Association to Birmingham in September 1865, Johnstone was chosen president. The best-known of his writings are ‘A Therapeutic Arrangement and Syllabus of Materia Medica,’ 1835, which had an extensive circulation; and ‘A Discourse on the Phenomena of Sensation as connected with the Mental, Physical, and Instructive Faculties of Man,’ 1841. He died at Leamington on 11 May 1869. He was the last of his family who distinguished himself in medicine in the midland counties, his grandfather, James, his father, Edward, and two uncles, John and James, having practised in Kidderminster, Worcester, and Birmingham. He married in 1834 Maria Mary Payne, daughter of Joseph Webster of Penns, Warwickshire, and by her, who died in 1859, left twelve children. His eldest son was Colonel Sir James Johnstone, K.C.S.I.; his third son Charles Johnstone, R.N.; and his third daughter Catherine Laura Johnstone, an authoress.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Boase, George Clement (1885). \"Johnstone, Edward\".

        "content": "\"If He Wanted to He Would\" is a song by American country music singer Kylie Morgan. It was released on July 25, 2022, as Morgan's debut single to country radio. It was initially included on her EP, P.S. (2022), and later served as the lead to her debut studio album, Making It up as I Go (2023). Morgan co-wrote the song with Zandi Holup and Ben Johnson, and it was produced by Johnson with Shane McAnally.\n\n\n== Background ==\nKylie Morgan was inspired to write \"If He Wanted to He Would\" around the titular phrase after seeing it used on social media platforms, notably TikTok. She also made a connection with singer-songwriter Zandi Holup through the app, which led to her reaching out to enlist her help with co-writing, and the two met in March 2021. Morgan felt the song was darker than initially intended, so they later enlisted the help of Ben Johnson with a second writing session in August 2021, where he fleshed out the melody. Johnson ultimately co-produced the track with Shane McAnally.\n\"If He Wanted to He Would\" was certified Gold by the RIAA in March 2024.\n\n\n== Music video ==\nDirected by Carlos Ruiz, the music video for \"If He Wanted to He Would\" premiered on November 2, 2022.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Pierre Boillot (22 June 1918 - 1 September 1994) was a French World War II flying ace attributed with 13 confirmed victories.\n\n\n== Career ==\nBorn on June 22, 1918, in Laissey, Pierre opted for a military career and obtained his pilot's license on June 7, 1938, before joining the 4th squadron of GC.II/7 in May 1939, at the Luxeuil air base. As soon as war was declared in September 1939, he participated in operations to protect reconnaissance aircraft above the operational zone extending along the banks of the Rhine, from Rhinau to Basel. At the controls of an MS.406, he experienced his first aerial combat against a Dornier Do 17, in November 1939 but did not until obtain his first confirmed victory until the morning of April 20, 1940, which was against a Bf.109E of 2/JG.54 above Belfort. Then came the German offensive on May 10, 1940, and the fights are increasing (with reduced prior training for French pilots and non-existent means of radio communication between planes except for the squadron leader who can only communicate with a radio car on the ground and only within a radius of 80 km):\n\nMay 10, 1940: he shot down, in cooperation, a Heinkel He 111.\nMay 11, 1940: in the region of Luxeuil-les-Bains, he was hit in aerial combat. He lands his aircraft but is targeted by friendly DCA who believe it is a German plane. He was recovered by friendly troops but his MS 406 was not recoverable.\nMay 11, 1940: he shoots down a Junkers Ju 88 which was counted as a probable victory.\nJune 7, 1940: he obtains 1 new victory.Coming out of the Battle of France as an ace, the GC.II/7 was repatriated to Tunisia and re-equipped with D.520s. After the Anglo-American landing in North Africa (November 1942), he returned to service alongside the allied troops but his unit was confined to maritime convoy escort and coastal surveillance missions, but that did not prevent the young chief sergeant, now flying a Spitfire Mk.V, to obtain 2 victories against Ju 88s (October 10, October 30, 1943). In September 1943, his unit, renamed GC.II/7N, was based in Corsica, where, as of August 1944, he participated in the Allied landings in Provence. Meanwhile, as he was promoted to officer, Pierre fought successively in the Rhône valley, the Vosges and German territory, obtaining 4 new confirmed victories during the winter of 1944 and the spring of 1945, in this case 4 Bf.109s (NB. October 3, October 8, December 24, 1944, and March 18, 1945).\nWith the Second World War over, he decided to continue his career in the Air Force. He commanded the 4e Escadre de Chasse in 1952, and in 1964, he commanded the Romilly air base. He ended his career at the 2nd CATAC in Nancy. He was \"mark officer of experimental prototypes\" (date unknown). He ended his military career as a colonel in 1969. He was then hired by Dassault and retired in 1983.\n\n\n== References ==",

It is not known when or at what place he commenced the practice of physic; but he mentions curing a person at Louth in 1562. He was residing at Asple Hall, near Nottingham, in May 1572, and at Kingsmead, near Derby, in January 1572–3. He also appears to have repaired, for the purposes of practice, to Bath and Buxton during the seasons at those places, and to have been patronised by Henry Herbert, second earl of Pembroke, and George Talbot, earl of Shrewsbury, K.G.\nHis works are: \n\n‘Diall of Agues, wherein may be seene the diversitie of them, with their names, the definitions, simple and compound, proper and accidentall, divisions, causes, and signes,’ London, 1566, 8vo.\n‘The Bathes of Bathes Ayde: Wonderfull and most excellent agaynst very many Sicknesses, approved by authoritie, confirmed by reason, and dayly tryed by experience, with the antiquitie, commoditie, property, knowledge, use, aphorismes, diet, medicine, and other thinges to be considered and observed,’ London, 1572, 4to.\n‘The benefit of the auncient Bathes of Buckstones, which cureth most greevous Sicknesses, never before published,’ London, 1572, 4to.\n‘Galens Bookes of Elementes,’ translated from the Latin, London, 1574, 4to.\n‘A Briefe, excellent, and profitable Discourse, of the naturall beginning of all growing and liuing things, heate, generation, effects of the spirits, gouernment, vse, and abuse of Phisicke, preseruation, &c. … In the ende whereof is shewed the order and composition of a most heauenly Water, for the preseruation of Mans lyfe,’ London, 1574, 4to.

        "content": "Palling Lifeboat Station is a former Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) station, which was located at the town of Palling in the county of Norfolk.\nA lifeboat was first stationed here by the Norfolk Association for Saving the Lives of Shipwrecked Mariners (NASLSM) in 1852, and transferred to the RNLI in 1858. The station closed in 1930.\n\n\n== History ==\nA lifeboat was sent to be stationed at Palling in 1852 by the Norfolk Association for Saving the Lives of Shipwrecked Mariners. She was a 32-foot Palmer type non-self-righting lifeboat, built by Branford, of Gt. Yarmouth, costing £75.In 1857, the NASLSM made a request, that the RNLI take over responsibility for all their lifeboat stations, including Palling. This was formally agreed in 1858. A new lifeboat was ordered for Palling from Forrestt of Limehouse, London, a 30-foot 10-oared Peake-class self-righting lifeboat, and along with her specially constructed carriage, cost just over £250. Edward Amis was appointed Coxswain. She was housed in the boathouse built by the NASLSM, and would serve Palling for 6 years, being launched on service 6 times, and saving 20 lives.The next lifeboat to be stationed at Palling was the Parsee. Originally a 30-foot lifeboat stationed at Hastings named Victoria, she was sent to Forrestt in London for conversion to be a 36-foot, 12-oared boat. She was transported to Gt. Yarmouth in February 1864 free of charge by the Great Eastern Railway Company, and then sailed up to Palling by the crew. In her 18 years on service at Palling, she rescued 103 lives in 23 launches.Parsee was replaced by a new boat in 1882, the Heyland (ON 38), built by Woolfe of Shadwell. The boat was provided from funds raised in the memory of Lt. Heyland, RN, lost rescuing a seaman from H.M.S. Minotaur. But weighing 4 tons, she proved too heavy for the sandy conditions at Palling, and was soon replaced by Good Hope (ON 13) in 1884; again a 37-foot boat built by Woolfe, but weighing only 3 tons.The No.2 station was closed in 1929. Motor-powered lifeboats had been placed on service at Cromer, 20 miles to the north, and Gorleston, 20 miles to the south, and it soon followed that the decision was made to close the No.1 station. This happened on 29 October 1930, with the removal of the lifeboat Jacob and Rachel Valentine (ON 580).The parish of \"Palling\" was renamed \"Sea Palling\" on 2 October 1948.\n\n\n== Notable rescues ==\nAt 4:30am on the 7 Mar 1907, Palling No.1 lifeboat 54th West Norfolk Regiment (ON 471) launched to the aid of the vessel Vixen. In pitch-black gale force conditions, the lifeboat managed to rescue 5 crew, but one man was left clinging to the rigging, cold, and unable to climb down by himself.\nThe Master re-boarded the Vixen along with lifeboat crewman James Pestell. Pestell then climbed the rigging, and with the assistance of the Master, brought the man to the waiting lifeboat. With two of the party now on board, the lifeboat was hit by a large wave, and washed away from the wreck, leaving Pestell alone on the stricken vessel. Finally, the lifeboat returned, and Pestell was taken on board.\nFor this service, James Pestell Jnr. was awarded the RNLI Silver Medal.\n\n\n== Station honours ==\nThe following are awards made at Palling\nRNLI Silver MedalEdward Amis, Coxswain - 1870Walter Pestell, Coxswain - 1893Thomas Bishop, Acting Coxswain - 1894Walter Pestell, Coxswain - 1899 (Second Service Clasp)James Pestell, Jnr, crew member, 1907\n\n\n== Palling lifeboats ==\n\n\n=== All-weather lifeboats ===\n\n\n==== No.1 Station ====\n\n\n==== No.2 Station ====\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of RNLI stations\nList of former RNLI stations\nRoyal National Lifeboat Institution lifeboats\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",
