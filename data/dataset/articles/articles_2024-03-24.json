        "content": "La Libertad (Spanish: The Freedom) was a Spanish newspaper with a progressive, workerist, socializing tone, very popular, entertaining, and easy to read, which was founded in 1919 by editors of El Liberal as a result of a newspaper strike. Throughout its existence, it was configured as a left-wing republican publication. It disappeared in 1939, at the end of the Spanish Civil War.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn December 1919, a significant number of editors and workers from the newspaper El Liberal went on strike, although they would end up leaving this newspaper. In its place they founded a new publication, La Libertad, which published its first issue on 13 December 1919. In its early years it maintained a position close to the politician Santiago de Alba and the Liberal Left group. After the establishment of the Primo de Rivera dictatorship, it was one of the newspapers that welcomed the new regime most negatively.\nIn March 1925 the newspaper was acquired by the businessman and financier Juan March, who also took control of the afternoon newspaper Informaciones. Despite the change in ownership, La Libertad would consolidate itself in these years as Juan March's left-wing newspaper - while Informaciones was the right-wing newspaper. He maintained a position of opposition to the dictatorship and in 1928 he declared himself a republican; At the time of the fall of the dictatorship - 1930 - he was, according to Antonio Checa Godoy, one of the main spokespersons for republicanism in Madrid. The editorial line did not change after the arrival of the Second Spanish Republic. March left the newspaper in May 1934, at which point he began a new stage. In 1935 he gave great media coverage to the \" black market \" affair, exploiting that political scandal.\nThe newspaper began to defend the politicians of the first biennium and would extreme its leftist stance, especially after the victory of the Popular Front in the elections of February 1936. The newspaper continued to be published after the outbreak of the Civil War, in July 1936. He disappeared with the end of the war, at the end of March 1939.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\nIts success is evidenced by the fact that it printed 250,000 copies on the day the sentence against the convicts of the Andalusia Express Crime was carried out in a city, Madrid, that did not reach 750,000. It published good quality serials (Eckermann, Dickens, Mérimée, Dumas Jr., Goethe, Murger, Verne, Répide, Palacio Valdés, Conan Doyle, etc.) well illustrated by Carlos Sáenz de Tejada first and then by Francisco Rivero Gil, while the caricatures were reserved for Exoristo Salmerón and Ricardo Marín, although the youngest of the Machado brothers, José, also made his first steps as a cartoonist. JM Martínez Bande was in charge of the sports drawings.\nHe maintained serious competition with El Liberal to gain the credit of readers in addition to a lawsuit for plagiarism, accused of copying the sections, the layout, the distribution of the pages, and trying to take advantage of the distribution channels. 9 However, La Libertad achieved notable news successes:\n\nReport on the Moroccan War in eight installments carried out by Oteyza and Alfonso.\nAttention, in 1920, to the possible entry of the PSOE into the Third International.\n\n\n== Escrache ==\nOn 26 November 1935, a group of monarchists and right-wingers led by Fernando Cobián, son of former minister Eduardo Cobián, stood in the early hours of the night in front of the newspaper's headquarters \"with the purpose of carrying out an attack in protest against a loose publication by said newspaper in the morning issue\".\n\n\n== Editorial ==\nAmong the founding editors were Antonio Zozaya, Luis de Oteyza (who was one of its directors), Pedro de Répide, Antonio de Lezama, Luis de Zulueta, Augusto Barcia, Manuel Machado, and Luis Salado, among others. Journalist Teresa de Escoriaza was also a collaborator.\nAntonio de Miguel's name for its editors includes, apart from those mentioned, Camilo Barcia Trelles, brother of Augusto; Joaquín Aznar, who would become its director; to Darío Pérez, Luis de Tapia, Manuel Castro Tiedrá, Arturo Pérez Camarero, José Manuel Fernández Gómez (later sentenced to death as an editor by the victors of the civil war along with the also editor and poet Félix Paredes Martín and the deputy director Eduardo Haro Delage), Alfonso R. Kuntz, Antonio de la Villa, his brother Alejandro de la Villa, Ricardo Hernández del Pozo, Rafael Hernández, Antonio García Romero, Ángel Lázaro, Manuel Ortiz de Pinedo, Francisco Rivero Gil, the photographer Alfonso Sánchez García, known simply like \"Alfonso\", and several more.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nCabrera Calvo-Sotelo, Mercedes (2011).

        "content": "The Edziza Formation is a stratigraphic unit of Pleistocene age in northwestern British Columbia, Canada. First described in 1984, the Edziza Formation was mapped as one of several geological formations of the Mount Edziza volcanic complex. It overlies at least four other geological formations of this volcanic complex that differ in age and composition. The main volcanic rock comprising the Edziza Formation is trachyte which was deposited by volcanic eruptions at the end of the third magmatic cycle of the Mount Edziza volcanic complex 0.9 million years ago.\nTrachyte of the Edziza Formation is in the form of lava flows and pyroclastic rocks that comprise the central stratovolcano of Mount Edziza, as well as lava domes on its summit and flanks. At least four lava lakes ponded inside the summit crater which cooled into four rock units that are exposed in the breached eastern crater rim. These lava lakes overlie rock fragments inside the central volcanic conduit which accompanied with collapse of a narrower and higher summit.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nA number of explanations have been made regarding the origin of the name Edziza. A 1927 report by J. Davidson of the British Columbia Land Surveyors claims that Edziza means \"sand\" in the Tahltan language, referring to the deep volcanic ash deposits or pumice-like sand covering large portions of the Big Raven Plateau around Mount Edziza. According to David Stevenson of University of Victoria's Anthropology Department, \"sand\" or \"dust\" is instead translated as \"kutlves\" in the Tahltan language. An explanation listed in the BC Parks brochure is that Edziza means \"cinders\" in the Tahltan language. Another explanation proposed by Canadian volcanologist Jack Souther is that Edziza is a corruption of Edzerza, the name of a local Tahltan family.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Edziza Formation was first described by Jack Souther, Richard Lee Armstrong and J. Harakal in 1984 who grouped it together with the Pillow Ridge Formation in their descriptions and mapping. It was mapped as one of 15 geological formations of the Mount Edziza volcanic complex, a group of late Cenozoic volcanic rocks in northwestern British Columbia, Canada. In 1988, Jack Souther mapped the Edziza and Pillow Ridge formations separately and the number of geological formations comprising the Mount Edziza volcanic complex had dropped to 13; the Sheep Track and Kounugu formations had been reassigned as members of the Big Raven and Nido formations, respectively, and are no longer recognized.\n\n\n== Location ==\nNearly all of the Edziza Formation is located on the east-central edge of the Big Raven Plateau, a barren plateau in Cassiar Land District bounded on the west by Mess Valley, on the north by Klastline Valley, on the east by Kakiddi Valley and on the south by Chakima and Walkout valleys, the latter two of which are separated by mountainous terrain. It lies at the northern end of the Mount Edziza volcanic complex which also includes the smaller Arctic Lake and Kitsu plateaus to the south. This complex of shield volcanoes, stratovolcanoes, lava domes, calderas and cinder cones forms a broad, intermontane plateau at the eastern edge of the Tahltan Highland, a southeast-trending upland area extending along the western side of the Stikine Plateau. Small portions of the Edziza Formation occur north, northwest and southwest of Nuttlude Lake which is an expansion of Kakiddi Creek.\n\n\n== Stratigraphy ==\n\nStratigraphically, the Edziza Formation is the fifth youngest unit of the Mount Edziza volcanic complex, having been deposited over the Nido, Pyramid, Ice Peak and Pillow Ridge formations. It has a volume of 18 cubic kilometres (4.3 cubic miles), making it the fifth most voluminous geological formation of the Mount Edziza volcanic complex. The Edziza Formation is also the youngest geological formation of the Mount Edziza volcanic complex involving more than 10 cubic kilometres (2.4 cubic miles) of volcanic material.\nBasalt flows of the 4.4 million-year-old Nido Formation are overlain by the Edziza Formation on the eastern flank of Mount Edziza between Tenchen Creek and The Pyramid where they overlie a ridge of Mesozoic basement rocks. The Edziza Formation overlies the westernmost portion of Sphinx Dome, a rhyolite dome of the 1.1 million-year-old Pyramid Formation; two thick remnants of the Edziza Formation also occur on the steep northern and southern flanks of this dome.\nBasalt flows of the roughly one million-year-old Ice Peak Formation are overlain by the Edziza Formation which overlaps with the northern flank of Ice Peak. The 0.9 million-year-old Pillow Ridge Formation is sparsely overlain by the Edziza Formation, but much larger portions of the Edziza Formation overlap with the western and northern edges of Pillow and Tsekone ridges, respectively. Hawaiite and patches of air-fall tephra assigned to the Holocene Big Raven Formation overlie the northern end of the Edziza Formation where they are part of the Desolation Lava Field.\n\n\n== Lithology ==\nThe Edziza Formation consists mainly of trachyte that was erupted 0.9 million years ago at the end of the third magmatic cycle of the Mount Edziza volcanic complex. Its composition straddles near the pantelleritic trachyte/comenditic trachyte boundary and is in the form of explosion breccias, lava flows and lava domes. The trachyte contains a matrix of sodic plagioclase alkali feldspar, katophorite, arfvedsonite, aenigmatite and opaque oxides that is embedded with sparse phenocrysts of anorthoclase and sodic ferrohedenbergite. Edziza trachyte is mineralogically similar to trachyte of the Kakiddi Formation which was erupted 0.3 million years ago during the final stages of the fourth magmatic cycle. However, the Kakiddi trachyte flows travelled along gently sloping valleys for at least 10 kilometres (6.2 miles), suggesting that they were erupted more fluidly than those of the Edziza Formation.\n\n\n=== Stratovolcano ===\nThe main feature consisting of Edziza Formation trachyte is the central stratovolcano of Mount Edziza. It comprises explosion breccias, landslide or lahar deposits and thick, steeply-dipping flows that were erupted as highly viscous lava. These rocks are well-exposed in 850-metre-high (2,790-foot) cliffs on the eastern flank of Mount Edziza where they occur along the north side of Tenchen Valley. This section of the stratovolcano contains a lower assemblage of chaotic explosion breccias and an upper assemblage of lava that overlies the breccias. Lava of the upper assemblage is highly irregular or lenticular in cross section, but it contains individual cooling units as much as 150 metres (490 feet) thick.\n\nThe lower assemblage encloses up to 120-metre-long (390-foot) and 15-metre-thick (49-foot) lavas that occur as relatively small, crudely-jointed, irregular masses and discontinuous lenses. Extremely coarse breccias occur in the western proximity and contain massive, up to 7.5-metre-wide (25-foot) volcanic blocks that were probably deposited directly from the central conduit during eruption. At the eastern end of Tenchen Valley are more distal breccias that rarely contain volcanic blocks more than 1.5 metres (4.9 feet) wide. Local rounding and stratification of these breccias is indicative of lahar or landslide deposition.\nExposed in the steep Tenchen cirque headwall are large volcanic blocks and small breccia fragments within the central conduit that accompanied with collapse of a narrower summit with a much smaller crater. The collapse may have been caused by a violent, climactic eruption, effusion of the Kakiddi lava flows or the outpouring of voluminous lava during dome formation. Prior to collapse, the summit of Mount Edziza was at least 610 metres (2,000 feet) higher than it is today. \n\n\n==== Summit crater ====\nThe broad, nearly flat summit of Mount Edziza is truncated by a 3-kilometre-wide (1.9-mile) crater that formed after collapse of the original summit. A circular ridge surrounding this ice-filled crater is partially exposed above the ice cap as a discontinuous series of spires and serrated nunataks. Spires forming the southern end of the ridge are the highest and consist of greenish grey, sparsely porphyritic trachyte. They comprise well-formed, small diameter rock columns that rise nearly vertically for more than 90 metres (300 feet) above the ice cap. Nunataks elsewhere on the summit ridge are more subdued, consisting of pyroclastic debris that has been glacially reworked.\nThe remnants of several lava lakes are exposed inside the crater where the eastern side of the summit ridge has been breached by active cirques. They overlie breccia of the central conduit and are in the form of at least four cooling units. Trachyte with well-developed columnar jointing forms the lower two units, each of which is about 30 metres (98 feet) thick. The two upper units consist of lighter green trachyte; the lower unit has a thickness of nearly 90 metres (300 feet). Well-developed, vertical and rectangularly jointed trachyte forms this unit and comprises a shear cliff across the full width of the Tenchen cirque headwall. The uppermost unit is largely buried under overhanging ice, but it appears to consist of agglutinated volcanic blocks.\n\n\n==== Subvolcanic intrusions ====\nExposed in the underlying basement rocks on the deeply eroded eastern flank of Mount Edziza are subvolcanic trachyte cupolas, sills, dikes and irregular intrusive masses linked to the magma plumbing system. Dikes are present as swarms and are usually vertical or subvertical, having been distributed in a crudely radial pattern towards the summit crater. They individually range in thickness from a few centimetres to nearly 2 kilometres (1.2 miles) and occur both within the stratovolcano and in the underlying basement rocks. Cupolas occur throughout Tenchen Valley as 3-to-9-metre-wide (9.8-to-29.5-foot) projections through thick pyroclastic deposits and resemble inverted sand castings up to 12 metres (39 feet) high where the breccia has eroded away.\n\n\n==== Hydrothermal alteration ====\n\nThe Tenchen cirque headwall exposes dikes, sills and breccias within the central conduit that have been intensely altered by hydrothermal solutions, resulting in the rocks being bright yellow and ochre-weathered. Complete alteration occurs in the middle of the altered zone where rock has been reconstituted to a pure white, amorphous material; the only original mineral present is alkali feldspar which comprises small tabular phenocrysts.\nPermeating the completely altered material are chalcedony veinlets less than 1 millimetre (0.039 inches) thick which are cut by more extensively distributed veins 1 to 5 centimetres (0.39 to 1.97 inches) wide. Tiny cubes of pyrite occupy many of the larger veins while the surrounding wall rock contains disseminated pyrite and marcasite. The conduit breccia and surrounding rocks were likely altered by intense fumarolic activity that occurred on a prolonged basis.\n\n\n==== Subfeatures ====\nAt least three trachyte domes of the Edziza Formation occur on Mount Edziza, all of which were created by the rapid effusion of viscous trachytic lava. The nearly circular Nanook Dome forms the southeastern buttress of the summit crater and is the largest of the three lava domes with a diameter of about three-quarters of a kilometre. It may have been the source for the two upper lava lakes inside the summit crater as they consist of trachyte similar to that of Nanook Dome. Glacier Dome and Triangle Dome are two elliptical masses of trachyte with concentric flow layering on the northwestern and western flanks of Mount Edziza, respectively. Triangle Dome displays a pattern of columnar cooling joints that indicates it was formed by volcanic activity in a subglacial environment. A 24-metre-thick (79-foot) trachyte flow that may have issued during an early, fluid phase of the Glacier Dome eruption is exposed for 2 kilometres (1.2 miles) north of Pyramid Creek; its distal end thins to about 15 metres (49 feet).\nSouth of Pillow Ridge on the northwestern flank of Mount Edziza is a rounded pyroclastic cone with a small central crater that probably formed during the latter stages of Edziza Formation volcanism. This pile of agglutinated trachyte spatter, pumice and bombs was the source of at least two separate lobes of lava that flowed onto the adjacent plateau surface. The northwesterly lobe partially encircles Tsekone Ridge and borders as well as overlies breccia of Pillow Ridge. Extending west of the pyroclastic cone is the second lobe of lava which, together with the northwesterly lobe, is largely overlain by volcanic ash and colluvial material.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGeology of British Columbia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===",

        "content": "Tragedy at Ravensthorpe is an 1927 detective novel by the British writer Alfred Walter Stewart, published under his pseudonym J.J. Connington.  It is the second in a series of seventeen novels featuring the Golden Age Detective Chief Constable Sir Clinton Driffield following on from Murder in the Maze. The American edition was published in Boston by Little, Brown and Company.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nDuring a fancy dress party at the country estate of Ravensthorpe, an attempt is made to rob the museum room of the house containing the house's valuable collection. The main target seems to be some medallions about to be sold to an American millionaire. Sir Clinton, an old friend of the family and a guest at the party, takes over the investigation. When two deaths follow in the wake of the failed robbery, he works to establish what connection they may have with the valuable collection.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBarzun, Jacques & Taylor, Wendell Hertig.

It was released on 22 March 2024 through Virgin Music. Production was handled by Aaron Gillespie and Suzy Shinn. It features a lone guest appearance from Alex Gaskarth.\nAlong with the singles, music videos were released for songs \"I Suck at Grieving\", \"Mary\", \"Pretty Good for a Bad Day\" and \"2nd Prettiest Girl (In the World)\".\nThe album debuted at No. 17 on the Scottish Albums chart, No. 31 on the UK Albums Sales Chart, No. 27 on the UK Physical Albums Chart, No. 30 on the UK Vinyl Albums Chart and No. 12 on the UK Record Store Chart.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nGirlfriend Material was met with generally favourable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 72, based on five reviews.\nAdam England of DIY called the album \"a well-rounded collection of songs\", saying it \"shows Lauren as an artist coming into her own, and her enjoyment shines through in her music\". Christopher Hamilton-Peach of The Line of Best Fit wrote: \"Girlfriend Material sees shimmer traded for increased complexity alongside a confident pop-punk presence – one that defines the album's major strength alongside a sharply served side-eye view of society\". Narzra Ahmed of Clash praised the album, saying \"we are so here for Lauran's honesty and the way tracks like \"Mary\" and \"Jealous\" and \"90's Kid\" are anthemic yet personal\".\nIn mixed reviews, Emma Wilkes of Kerrang! resumed: \"nonetheless, even if the follow-up to 2022's Garageband Superstar isn't wildly innovative, there's a smorgasbord of catchy tunes fizzing with sugary energy\". John Murphy of musicOMH stated: \"it's certainly a confident step-up from Garageband Superstar and if more of Hibberd's musical personality is allowed to shine through next time around, she could produce an even better album\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\nNotes\nAll song titles stylised in lowercase.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nLauran Hibberd — vocals, guitar (tracks: 1, 6)\nAlex Gaskarth — vocals (track 10)\nJess Baker — backing vocals (tracks: 4, 9), guitar (tracks: 8, 11)\nAaron Gillespie — guitar (tracks: 1–5, 7–9, 11, 12), producer & recording (tracks: 1–9, 11, 12)\nSuzy Shinn — guitar, producer & recording (track 10)\nDanen Reed — mixing, mastering (tracks: 3, 6)\nAdam Grover — mastering (tracks: 1–5, 7–12)\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Elizabeth \"Bettie\" J. Floyd  (October 22, 1930 – December 4, 1987), better known by her ring name Betty Jo Hawkins , was an American female professional wrestler.\n\n\n== Wrestling career ==\nAs a child Floyd suffered from rheumatoid arthritis which caused her pain in her joints. It was misdiagnosed as polio. Hawkins began her wrestling debut in 1948 and trained by Ella Waldek. She won the NWA Florida Women's Championship in 1952 where she became a three-time champion. She later worked in Calgary for Stampede Wrestling and other territories. Hawkins retired from wrestling in 1959 after the arthritis came back.\n\n\n== Personal life and death ==\nHawkins was married to female professional wrestler Brute Bernard. Bernard died in 1984 of a self-inflicted gunshot; it was not determined if his death was a suicide or an accident. One story states that Bernard was playing Russian roulette.\nHawkins passed away from a heart attack on December 4, 1987. She was 57. \n\n\n== Championships and accomplishments ==\nChampionship Wrestling from Florida\nNWA Florida Women's Championship (1 time)\nNational Wrestling Alliance\nNWA Women's World Tag Team Championship (2 times) – with Penny Banner (2)\n\n\n== References ==\nGeneral\n\nNevada, Vance (2022).

It was Grade II* listed in 1954.  In 2019, it was converted into a wedding venue by the Cripps Barn Group, the work including a new bat house for the Natterer and Pipistrelle bats which nested in the barn.  The conversion won a Regional Conservation Award from the Royal Institute of British Architects.  Historic England describe the building as \"a very unusual survival in the north of England\".\nThe single-storey building is built of stone, with a stone slate roof.  It is ten bays long.  On the front are two double doors with segmental arches in half-dormers, and there are other later openings.  The interior is aisled, with nine king-post frames.  The fifth bay has a threshing floor.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGrade II* listed buildings in North Yorkshire\nListed buildings in Bolton Abbey\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Railroad land grants in the United States made in the 1850s to 1870s, were instrumental in the building the nation's railway network in the Central United States west of Chicago. They enabled the rapid settlement of new farm and ranch lands as well as mining centers. Overall, government land grants to Western US railroads during the 1850s to 1880s played a crucial role in shaping the economic, social, and geographic landscape of the United States, laying the foundation for much of the nation's modern transportation infrastructure and facilitating the westward expansion of settlement and industry.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe federal government operated a land grant system between 1850 and 1871, through which new railway companies in the west were given millions of acres they could sell to prospective farmers or pledge to bondholders. A total of 129 million acres (520,000 km2) were granted to the railroads before the program ended, supplemented by a further 51 million acres (210,000 km2) granted by the states, and by various government subsidies. This program enabled the opening of numerous western lines, especially the Union Pacific-Central Pacific with fast service from San Francisco to Omaha and east to Chicago. West of Chicago, many cities grew up as rail centers, with repair shops and a base of technically literate workers.\nThe Illinois Central Railroad in 1851 was the first railroad to receive a federal land grant. The grant was part of the Land Grant Act of 1850, which provided 3.75 million acres of land to support railroad projects. The Illinois Central received nearly 2.6 million acres of land in Illinois.\nThe main laws, known as the Pacific Railroad Acts, were passed in 1862.  The highest priority at the time was to open speedy communications with the new state of California, to avoid going on foot or by a sea voyage that took six months.\nThe main factor, Republicans argued, was the immediate military emergency. The Civil War was underway and was not going well for the Union; no one knew how many years it would last or which side would win. Furthermore there was a serious risk that Britain and France might enter in support of the Confederacy--there was a war scare with Britain in late 1861, and France was now favoring the  Confederacy. A war would cut off the ocean route to California (and its gold).  The Confederate army was already marching toward California and there were fears that pro-Confederate political elements would take control of California, or it  might split off as an independent country. A transcontinental railway thus was a military necessity.  The transcontinental link finally became operational in May 1869, four years after the Civil War ended.n   Nationwide, railroad mileage doubled from 35,085 miles in 1865 to 70,268 in 1873.\n\n\n== Railroads for military, settlement, and economic needs ==\nThe government granted vast tracts of land to railroad companies as an incentive to build railways across the undeveloped western half of the country. They came during the Civil War of 1861–1865, when most of the cash budget was devoted to military expenses, and the gold mined in California was urgently needed. There was a military danger: in 1862 the Confederacy was attempting an invasion of California from Texas through New Mexico and Arizona. Furthermore, war with Britian and France was a serious possibility, which would cut off the oceanic connection to the West Coast.  Financially, these land grants acted as a form of non-cash subsidy, making the construction of extremely expensive rail lines across a thousand miles of unsettled land financially feasible for private companies. Economically they would allow the creation of many thousands of new farms, ranches, mines and towns.  \nThe land grants were made in twenty- or fifty-mile strips, with alternate sections of public land given for each mile of track built. The federal government kept the in-between sections, which were open to homesteaders and land speculators. After the success of the Illinois Central grant of 1851, Congress extended the program in 1862-1872 to help new railroads that planned to link to California. It gave out 123 million acres.  All together 1850 TO 1872  Washington gave 223 million acres, of which 35 million were forfeited. Washington also loaned cash for every mile built by these lines, at the rate of $16,000 for flatlands to $48,000 in the mountains. These loans were used to pay the construction crews, and were all fully paid back with interest by 1900. The largest grant went to the Northern Pacific, which obtained 40 milion acres (about the size of New England).   \nAfter the policy of giving land grants was ended. one profitable transcontinental railroad was built in the 1880s and 1890s without subsidies, the Great Northern Railway. However, its system did absorb a small line that was given 3 million acres in 1857.\n\n\n== Settlement of the  Great Plains ==\n\nThe availability of railroad transportation made previously remote areas more accessible to settlers, encouraging westward migration and the establishment of new communities. This expansion of settlement helped to populate and develop the frontier regions of the United States.\n\nIn addition to buying from the railroads, prospective farmers could use the homestead law to obtain free land from the federal government.  They had to file a claim and then work the land for five years. Or they could purchase from speculators who bought many homestead claims or bought land from the railroads. In general the railroads offered the best land with the best credit terms, but at slightly higher prices.  Married couples planning a permanent family farm were usually the buyers. Single women were also eligible on their own for a free homestead from the government.\nIn the Great Plains the population of the six states of the West North Central region ((Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota) soared from 988,000 in 1860 to 6,253,000 in 1890. The far West grew from 619,000 to 3,134,000.\nThe amount of improved farmland in the West North Central states soared tenfold from 11.1 million acres in 1860 to 105.5 million acres in 1890. \nThe land rush climaxed in the 1870s in Minnesota, Dakota, Nebraska, and Kansas, as the population more than doubled from 1.0 million in 1870 to 2.4 million in 1880, while the number of farms tripled from 99,000 to 302,000, and the improved acreage quintupled from 5.0 million acres to 24.6 million. Selling corn, wheat and cattle provided the cash for paying off the loans and taxes, and savings--the savings often went into speculative purchases of more farmland. For the family table, the housewife and the older daughters cultivated potatoes and vegetables, and cared for the chickens and the milch cow.\n\n\n=== Union Pacific Railroad ===\n\nIn addition to charges for freight and passenger service, the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) made its money from land sales to farmers and ranchers. The UP land grant gave it ownership of 12,800 acres per mile of finished track. The government kept every other section of land, so it also had 12,800 acres to sell or give away to speculators and homesteaders.  The UP's goal in this regard was not to make a profit, but rather to build up a permanent clientele of farmers and townspeople who would form a solid basis for routine sales and purchases.\n\n\n=== Northern Pacific Railroad ===\n\nThe Northern Pacific Railway (NP) was a transcontinental railroad that operated across the northern tier of the western states, from Minnesota to the Pacific Northwest. It was approved by Congress in 1864 and given nearly 40 million acres (62,000 sq mi; 160,000 km2) of land grants, which it used to raise money in Europe for construction. Construction began in 1870 and the main line opened all the way to the Pacific in  September, 1883. The railroad had about 6,800 miles (10,900 km) of track and served a large area, including extensive trackage in the states of Idaho, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, Oregon, Washington, and Wisconsin. In addition, the NP had an international branch to Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. The main activities were shipping wheat, cattle, timber, and minerals; bringing in consumer goods, transporting passengers; and selling land.\nDuring the existence of the Dakota Territory (1861 to 1889, when it split into the states of North Dakota and South Dakota), the population first increased very slowly. Then it grew very rapidly with the \"Dakota Boom\" from 1870 to 1880.  The surge  can largely be attributed to the growth of the Northern Pacific Railroad and its vigorous promotion in the U.S. and Europe. Settlers came from other western states as well as many from northern and western Europe. They sold their old farm and bought much larger farms on credit. They included large numbers of Norwegians, Germans, Swedes, and Canadians. Cattle ranching on the vast open ranges became a major industry. With the advent of the railroad agriculture intensified:  wheat became the main cash crop. Economic hardship hit in the 1880s due to lower wheat prices and a drought.\n\n\n=== Migration from Europe ===\nThe railroads wanted experienced European farmers who could sell small farms in Germany or Scandinavia and use the gold to buy much larger farms. The railroads subsidizes travel for prospective buyers and their families and machinery. The sold farmland on good credit terms, such as 10% down and ten years to pay. For example, the Union Pacific, the Burlington, Illinois Central, and the other western lines, opened sales offices in the East and in Europe, advertised heavily, They offered attractive package rates for farmer to sell out and move his entire family, and his tools, to the new destination. In 1870 the UP offered rich Nebraska farmland at five dollars an acre, with one fourth down and the remainder in three annual installments. It gave a 10 percent discount for cash.\nA homestading farmer could get 160 acres free from the federal government after five years. However speculators controlled the best farmland and they charged more than the raillroads. Railroad sales were improved by offering large blocks to ethnic colonies of European immigrants. Germans and Scandinavians, for example, could sell out their small farms back home and buy much larger farms for the same money. European ethnics comprised half of the population of Nebraska in the late 19th century.\n\n\n== Stimulus for economic growth ==\nRailroads were crucial for connecting the resource-rich Western territories with Eastern markets. By providing land grants, the government facilitated the construction of railroads, which in turn spurred economic development in the West by making it easier to transport goods, people, and resources.\nThe historians' debate about the wisdom of providing railroad land grants in the 1860s centered on the government's strategy, with discussions focusing on the potential benefits, drawbacks, and implications of this policy. At issue was the wisdom and fairness of giving land to railroads, as well as the resulting land speculation that made land more expensive for farmers. The government's intention was to promote railroad construction, which would in turn give military protection to the West Coast, facilitate cross-country movement of goods and passengers, stimulate population growth, and boost commerce, mining and industry. There were historical precedents on a small scale. However, the scale of land grants in the 19th century was much larger. \nLloyd J. Mercer attempts by the use of econometrics to determine the values of railroad land grants of the 19th century to the railroads and to society as a whole. Mercer summarizes and criticizes previous treatments of this subject and then discusses his own findings. Using only data from the Central Pacific and the Union Pacific systems, Mercer concludes that the railroad owners received unaided rates of return which substantially exceeded the private rate of return on the average alternative project in the economy during the same period. Thus the projects turned out to be profitable although it was generally expected by contemporary observers that the roads would be privately unprofitable without the land grant aid. The land grants did not have a major effect, increasing the private rate of return only slightly. Nevertheless, it is contended that the policy of subsidizing those railroad systems was beneficial for society since the social rate of return from the project was substantial and exceeded the private rate by a significant margin.\n\n\n== Integration of the nation ==\nThe new western railroads played a key role in uniting the country geographically and economically. The construction of transcontinental railroads, such as the Union Pacific and Central Pacific, facilitated travel and trade between the East and West coasts, reducing travel times and costs while promoting national cohesion.\n\n\n=== Cattle drives ===\n\nLand grant railroads facilitated the integration of the Southwest into the national economy. After the Civil War the cattle industry expanded rapidly in Texas, but it lacked rail connections to the main packinghouses in Chicago.  The solution of a cattle drive across unoccupied federal land north to the railheads in Kansas.  Two railroads competed for the business, the Santa Fe and the Kansas Pacific.  There were several well-travelled routes; the most popular was the Chisholm Trail with a destination in Abeline, Kansas. A typical drive would start with a herd of 2000 cattle (and a hundred or so horses), with a dozen cowboys, a cook and a trail master. They trekked about 15 miles a day, stopping at water holes and giving the cattle the chance to graze so they would not be losing weight. The cowboys made sure the cattle did not wander. There was no cost to use federal land, but when they went across  Indian Territory (Oklahoma), they paid the Indians for their passage with some cattle.\nFinally after a month or two on the trail they reached a destination where the herd was sold to local dealers who shipped them east to packinghouses in Chicago. The cowboys were paid off when they reached their destination. Abilene and Dodge City  were the most famous cattle towns, along with Newton, Caldwell and Wichita. Theirreputation for violence was much exaggerated by Hollywood in films like \"Twelve O'Clock High\".\nThe cattle drives flourished in the 1870s, and slowly moved west as the old paths were taken over by settlers. The cattle drives died out in the 1880s, as quarantines were imposed to stop the tick disease some herds carried. Furthermore cattle ranches in Kansas, Nebraska and the Dakotas grew rapidly in size, and produced better quality beef cattle which could be shipped east on the other land grant railroads.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCentral Pacific Railroad\nDakota Territory\nFirst transcontinental railroad\nHistory of Iowa#Transportation:Railroad Fever\nHistory of Kansas\nHistory of Nebraska#Land sales\nHistory of rail transportation in the United States\nIllinois Central Railroad\nKansas Pacific Railway\nNorthern Pacific Railway\nPacific Railroad Acts\nUnion Pacific Railroad\nPublic Land Survey System\nsee also Wikipedia articles on rail lines receiving land grants\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nAthearn, Robert G.

        "content": "Bolton Abbey Hall is a historic building in Bolton Abbey, a village in North Yorkshire, in England.\nThe building was originally the gatehouse of Bolton Priory.  It was built in the 14th century, and was converted into a hunting lodge in 1652.  It was owned by the Duke of Devonshire from 1748, who typically spent August at the property, where they sometimes entertained royalty.  In the 1843 and 1844, it was extended and altered by Joseph Paxton.  In 2022, it was made available for private hire, at a cost of around £25,000 for three nights.  It was Grade II* listed in 1954.\nThe building is constructed of stone, with a stone slate roof and embattled parapets.  The gatehouse range has three storeys, and a single bay, to the south is a range with two storeys and three bays, to the north is a range of two storeys and four bays, with a three-storey bay at the end.  The gateway has diagonal buttresses, and contains a pointed arch infilled with pointed-arched window, above which is a hood mould and mullioned and transomed windows, and it is flanked by embattled turrets.  Elsewhere, the windows are mullioned, some with transoms and some with hood moulds, and there are further embattled turrets.  Inside, the gatehouse is divided into two by a cross-wall, with only a small connecting passage.  There is a spiral staircase, and a tunnel vaulted roof.  There is a large 16th century fireplace in the former west entrance, while the east entrance has a doorway from about 1370, which may have been relocated from the priory's chapter house.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGrade II* listed buildings in North Yorkshire\nListed buildings in Bolton Abbey\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Camarillo Premium Outlets (formerly called the Camarillo Factory Outlets) is an open-air outlet mall located in Camarillo, California. Camarillo Premium Outlets is owned and managed by the Simon Property Group. The Camarillo Premium Outlets include around 160 stores, including Versace and Jimmy Choo.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1991, the Sammis Corporation proposed to build a shopping center in Camarillo, although it would receive opposition from homeowner groups. \nFrom October 1992 to April 1994, Stephen J. Maulhardt, who was formerly the president of the Oxnard Chamber of Commerce, attempted to file lawsuits against the city of Camarillo, claiming that the city had violated the California Environmental Quality Act by approving the project. Construction for the outlet mall began in August of 1994. The Camarillo Premium Outlets would first open in November of 1995, with a further expansion of the mall in 1997. By 2003, the shopping center had attracted around 10 million visitors per year. In 2009, Camarillo Premium Outlets received another expansion after being bought by Simon Property Group. \n\n\n=== Crime ===\nOn July 8, 2014, a real estate agent exposed himself multiple times at a Neiman Marcus Last Call among other stores in the outlet mall. He was arrested on July 15.\nOn August 17, 2019, four people attempted to steal sunglasses from a Solstice Sunglasses store in the outlet mall at around 21:00 PDT. Two people were arrested following the robbery.\nOn September 22, 2023, 6 people robbed around $80,000 worth of items from a Gucci store in the outlet mall.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

A fresco by James Clark was added to the eastern apse between 1917 and 1920. A 1920s organ was replaced by one from St Jude's Church, Southsea in 2011.\n\n\n== References ==",

This was the first-ever award ceremony that introduced the concept of the \"Eddie Awards\", complete with the unveiling of the \"Eddie\" statuette. The four categories that were introduced were Outstanding Picture of the Year, Best Foreign or Documentary Film, Best Performance by an Actor in a Film Debut, and Best Performance by an Actress in a Film Debut. There were a total of six awards, upped from three in the previous year. The award ceremony was hosted by character actor Pat Buttram.\nFor the first time in the history of the award ceremony, the award was broadcast live on television, airing on the Los Angeles affiliate station KABC-TV. The broadcast was produced and directed by Lamont Johnson with music by bandleader Freddie Martin. After the presentations, singer and actress Barbara McNair hosted the floor show. Former president Harry S. Truman also won the awards' first ever \"Most Outstanding Television Personality\" award. David M. Noyes, producer of the show and Truman's former advisor, accepted the award on his behalf.\n\n\n== Nominees ==\n\nReferences:\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nACE Award 1965 at the Internet Movie Database",

        "content": "The Secret to Life is the debut studio album by the rock band Fizz, released on 27 October 2023 by Decca Records, and Universal Music Group. It was recorded over a two-week period at Middle Farm Studios in South Devon with Peter Miles.\nIn the production of The Secret to Life, the band bypassed many production tools commonly used in contemporary pop music and relied on real instruments and recording live takes of songs directly onto tape. This approach, as discussed in interviews, imparts a nostalgic quality reminiscent of the music of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nThe critical reception of The Secret to Life has been diverse, reflecting various perspectives on the band's musical style, lyrical content, and overall impact.\nThe album was lauded as a noteworthy addition to the music scene, being praised for its distinctive sound and cited as a promising debut.

It is named for Samat Sadykov, who in 1945 was posthumously awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union.\nSamat Sadykov Park is the only urban park in Razzakov. It has two primary entrances, the main entrance from the town's main roundabout on Dodosyan Street and a western entrance from Manas Ata Street. The park includes a soccer field, picnic areas, playgrounds, and a small forest.\n\n\n== History ==\nPart of the soccer field in Samat Sadykov Park was built over an ancient cemetery. In 2017, ownership of the park was transferred from the Ministry of Culture, Information and Tourism of the Kyrgyz Republic to the Razzakov (then Isfana) City Administration.\nIn 2020, the park was renovated with funding from Soros Foundation–Kyrgyzstan, a local branch of Open Society Foundations. In 2024, it was announced that 6 million Kyrgyz soms had been allocated to upgrade the playground in the park.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 1965 Oklahoma Supreme Court scandal was a political scandal in the U.S. state of Oklahoma involving judicial misconduct on the Oklahoma Supreme Court. Justice N. S. Corn was convicted in 1964 on federal tax evasion charges. After his conviction, he implicated himself, Samuel Earl Welch, and Napoleon Bonaparte Johnson in accepting bribes to decide cases.\nCorn had resigned after his conviction and Justice Welch resigned after impeach preceding began in the Oklahoma House of Representatives. Justice Johnson refused to resign and became the first Oklahoma Supreme Court Justice impeached and removed from office.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1964 Oklahoma Supreme Court Justice N. S. Corn was convicted for filing false federal income tax returns. After his conviction, Corn admitted to accepting bribes between 1938 and 1959 in return for his vote on the court and implicated fellow justices Samuel Earl Welch and Napoleon Bonaparte Johnson in also accepting bribes. After Corn made his sworn statements implicating the other still-sitting justices, United States District Judge Stephen Sanders Chandler Jr. passed a copy along to Justice William A. Berry.\nBerry was worried about being sued for libel if he released the allegations publicly, so he planned to pass the statement on to a member of the Oklahoma Legislature since legislators had legislative immunity to libel charges when speaking in a session of the legislature. Berry eventually decided to give the statement to Representative G. T. Blankenship.\n\n\n== Investigation ==\nOn January 21, 1965, state Representative G. T. Blankenship read a summary of a sworn statement from N. S. Corn to the Oklahoma House of Representatives describing how Corn, Samuel Earl Welch, and Napoleon Bonaparte Johnson had all accepted bribes to decide cases pending before the court. An investigative committee of the Oklahoma Bar Association recommended charges be filed against Welch and Johnson.\n\n\n=== Charges, impeachment, and investigations ===\nA federal grand jury indicted Corn, Welch, Johnson, and former Mayor of Oklahoma City O. A. Cargill. Cargill was eventually convicted of perjury. On March 18, 1965, the Oklahoma House began impeachment proceedings against Welch and Johnson, with Welch immediately resigning. Johnson refused to resign and later became the first impeached and removed justice of the Oklahoma Supreme Court.\nState Senator Roy Granthan was the prosecutor for the Oklahoma Senate trial of Justice Johnson. N. S. Corn testified that he accepted a bribe and shared it with Johnson, while Johnson took the stand in his defense and denied the allegations. He was ultimately convicted in the Senate by one vote.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nWhile initially Speaker of the Oklahoma House J. D. McCarty opposed judicial reform, he was later convicted of income tax evasion, allowing Governor Dewey Bartlett to push through reforms. On May 3, 1966, voters approved the creation of the Oklahoma Court on the Judiciary. On July 11, 1967, voters approved two state questions to abolish justices of the peace, the county court system, and special courts (replacing them with district courts) and replaced Oklahoma's system of judicial elections with the Oklahoma Judicial Nominating Commission for selecting judges.\n\n\n== References ==",

Uno Öpik; 19 October 1926 in Tartu, Estonia - 30 April 2005 in Bath, UK) was an Estonian-born atomic physicist most of whose adult life was spent in Northern Ireland and Great Britain. He was one of six children of Estonian astronomer and astrophysicist Ernst Öpik. His son is the British politician Lembit Öpik.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nUuno Öpik graduated from Tartu 1st Gymnasium in 1943. In 1943 his father Ernst moved the family to Danzig, and then to Swinemünde and finally to Hamburg. From 1946 to 1948 he studied at the Baltic University. In 1948 the family moved to Northern Ireland, when his father joined the staff at the Armagh Observatory. In 1950 he became a member of Student Society Liivika.\nÖpik studied at Queen's University Belfast (QUB), getting a B.Sc. in mathematics in 1950, a B.Sc. in physics in 1951, and a Ph.D. in physics in 1954  with the thesis, \"Quantal investigations of certain excitation and ionization processes\" under the advisor David Bates.\nHe worked as a research fellow at the University of Bristol from 1955 to 1956, as a lecturer at the University of Aberystwyth in Wales from 1956 to 1986 and at the University of Reading from 1960 to 1962.  In 1962, he returned to QUB, where he served on the staff until retirement in 1986.\nHis doctoral students included Raymond Flannery and Hugh Morrison.\n\n\n== Papers ==\nÖpik was mainly interested in atomic physics and published over 20 scientific papers in that field.\n\n1967 The polarization of a closed-shell core of an atomic system by an outer electron I.

He received a law degree from Andrés Bello Catholic University.\n\n\n== Politician ==\nSucre was elected to the National Assembly of Venezuela in the 1988 Venezuelan general election, which was won by Democratic Action, for a constituency in Ciudad Bolívar. He took office in January 1989. In 1991, he was appointed as secretary to Venezuelan president Carlos Andrés Pérez. He was defeated by a candidate of the left-wing party La Causa Radical (LCR) in the 1993 general election, in which Acción Democrática lost much of its support.\n\n\n== United Nations Official ==\nSucre moved to the United States following his defeat in the 1993 election and earned a post-graduate degree in law and public administration from Columbia University. He ultimately settled in Darien, Connecticut. \nHe was appointed to an advisor position at the United Nations in 1994. He was appointed as interim mayor of Peja by the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) in 1999 and held this role until 2001. Sucre later described his appointment to this position as one of his proudest moments. He later worked an advisor on governance systems and institutions. In 2008, he promoted an international youth development project based on an initiative of the Odebrecht Foundation in Bahia, Brazil. A 2013 news report identified him as programme manager of the Latin American and East Europe Programme of the Division for Public Administration and Development Management (DPADM).\n\n\n== Death ==\nSucre died on November 1, 2016.\n\n\n== Electoral record ==\n\n\n=== National Assembly of Venezuela ===\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Eels So Good: Essential Eels, Vol. 2 (2007–2020) is a 2023 greatest hits album for American indie rock band Eels. It follows 2008's Meet the Eels: Essential Eels, Vol. 1 (1996–2006) and received positive reviews from critics.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nEditors at AllMusic rated this album 4 out of 5 stars, with critic Mark Deming writing that \"Mark Oliver Everett is a man capable of writing an irresistible pop tune when he feels like it. He also seems to think that's a rather empty pursuit, and he prefers to twist his melodies and production into more challenging forms as he ponders his neuroses in song.\" and that on this compilation, \"Everett sets aside his essential duality and shares 20 tracks that, for the most part, focus on the gentler and more engaging side of his personality\". In American Songwriter, Hal Horowitz scored this a 3.5 out of 5, calling it a \"generous 72-minute compilation\", with \"plenty of compelling indie pop/rock\". In The Irish Times, Tony Clayton-Lea scored this release 3.5 out of 5 stars, writing that \"although it might not have the cumulative punch of their first [greatest hits compilation], no one could deny that the songs are anything less than their usual eerily charming selves\" and summed up \"amid the unforced individualism are measures of poignancy and emotional depth that make Everett’s songs a trove to repeatedly dig your hands into\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nAll songs written by E, except where noted.\n\n\"Fresh Blood\" (E, Koool G Murder) (from Hombre Lobo) – 4:27\n\"That Look You Give That Guy\" (E, Murder) (from Hombre Lobo) – 4:15\n\"A Line in the Dirt\" (from End Times) – 3:30\n\"Little Bird\" (from End Times) – 2:36\n\"Spectacular Girl\" (from Tomorrow Morning) – 3:15\n\"I Like the Way This Is Going\" (from Tomorrow Morning) – 2:35\n\"Peach Blossom\" (The Chet, E, Murder) (from Wonderful, Glorious) – 4:02\n\"Wonderful, Glorious\" (The Chet, E, Knuckles, Murder) (from Wonderful, Glorious) – 3:42\n\"Where I'm From\" (E, P-Boo) (from The Cautionary Tales of Mark Oliver Everett) – 2:46\n\"Mistakes of My Youth\" (The Chet, E) (from The Cautionary Tales of Mark Oliver Everett) – 4:56\n\"The Deconstruction\" (E, Murder) (from The Deconstruction) – 4:12\n\"Today Is the Day\" (E, P-Boo) (from The Deconstruction) – 3:02\n\"You Are the Shining Light\" (E, Murder) (from The Deconstruction) – 3:38\n\"Are We Alright Again\" (E, Murder) (from Earth to Dora) – 3:43\n\"Earth to Dora\" (The Chet, E) (from Earth to Dora) – 3:41\n\"Royal Pain\" (from the motion picture Shrek the Third) – 2:29\n\"Man Up\" (from the motion picture Yes Man) – 3:58\n\"Man I Keep Trying\" (The Chet, E) (from the motion picture Prisoner’s Daughter, previously unreleased) – 3:38\n\"Jazz Hands, Part I\" (previously unreleased) – 3:12\n\"Christmas, Why You Gotta Do Me Like This\" (previously unreleased) – 3:36\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n2023 in American music\nList of 2023 albums\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website \nEels So Good: Essential Eels, Vol. 2 at Discogs (list of releases) \nEels So Good: Essential Eels, Vol. 2 at MusicBrainz (list of releases)",

        "content": "The Ogarev Arena (Russian: Огарёв Арена) is a multifunctional sports venue in Saransk, the capital of the Republic of Mordovia, Russian Federation. Constructed in 2021, it consists of two tiers and can accommodate up to 7,500 spectators. It is primarily equipped for hockey and ice skating, and includes gyms and choreographic halls.\nInitially named Saransk Arena (Russian: Саранск Арена), it was laid down in 2011 but was only completed a decade later, and was opened on 25 December 2021. On 1 November 2022, the venue was transferred to N.P. Ogarev Mordovia State University and became federal property. Following a public vote on social media on 3 April 2023, the arena was renamed to \"Ogarev Arena\".\nThe 2024 Russian Junior Figure Skating Championships was held in the venue.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMordovia Arena, a football stadium in Saransk\nList of indoor arenas in Russia\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "HD 11007 (LTT 10624; HR 523) is a probable astrometric binary located in the northern constellation Triangulum. The primary is faintly visible to the naked eye as a whitish-yellow-hued star with an apparent magnitude of 5.81. The system is located relatively close at a distance of 90.4 light-years based on Gaia DR3 parallax measurements and it is drifting closer with a heliocentric radial velocity of −24.4 km/s. At its current distance, HD 11007's brightness is diminished by an interstellar extinction of 0.09 magnitudes and it has an absolute magnitude of +3.56. It is moving relatively fast across the celestial sphere, having a high proper motion of 341 mas/yr.\nThe primary has a stellar classification of F8 V, indicating that it is an ordinary F-type main-sequence star that is generating energy via hydrogen fusion at its core. However, it is slightly evolved, being 1.62 magnitudes above the zero age main sequence. It has 111% the mass of the Sun and a slightly enlarged radius 1.67 times that of the Sun. It is slightly over luminous for its class, radiating 3.23 times the luminosity of the Sun from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 6,060 K. HD 11007 A is metal deficient with an iron abundance that is 63.1% solar and it spins modestly with a somewhat constrained projected rotational velocity of approximately 5 km/s. The system is estimated to be 6.6 billion years old; it was suspected to be part of the thick disk population but is now considered to be one of the older members of the thin disk population.\n\n\n== References ==",

It has 5 to 11 variably-shaped leaflets, and racemes of about 7, usually purple flowers.\n\n\n== Description ==\nSwainsona longicarinata is a prostrate, rarely ascending perennial herb, or rarely an annual herb, that typically grows up to about 20 cm (7.9 in) tall. Its leaves are 20–70 mm (0.79–2.76 in) long with 5 to 11 variably-shaped leaflets, the side leaflets 5–10 mm (0.20–0.39 in) long and 1–6 mm (0.039–0.236 in) wide with stipules 2–10 mm (0.079–0.394 in) long at the base of the petioles. The flowers are arranged in racemes up to 200 mm (7.9 in) long with about 7 flowers on a peduncle 0.5–1.5 mm (0.020–0.059 in) wide, each flower 12–14 mm (0.47–0.55 in) long on a hairy pedicel about 2–3 mm (0.079–0.118 in) long. The sepals are joined at the base, forming a tube about 2 mm (0.079 in) long, the sepal lobes about the same length as the tube. The petals are purple, the standard petal about 11–12 mm (0.43–0.47 in) long and 12–15 mm (0.47–0.59 in) wide, the wings about 10 mm (0.39 in) long, and the keel 12–14 mm (0.47–0.55 in) long and 4–5 mm (0.16–0.20 in) deep. Flowering occurs from July to September and the fruit is elliptic, 10–30 mm (0.39–1.18 in) and 5–8 mm (0.20–0.31 in) wide.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nSwainsona longicarinata was first formally described in 1993 by Joy Thompson in the journal Telopea from a specimen collected on Dirk Hartog Island by Alex George in 1972. The specific epithet (longicarinata) means \"long keel\".\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nThis species of swainsona often grows on coastal calcareous dunes and flats, in the Yalgoo bioregion in the far west of Western Australia.\n\n\n== References ==",

The group performed the song on Top of the Pops the week before it peaked.

It was not until the end of the 1950s that she returned as an actress and appeared in several films, television series (including Königlich Bayerisches Amtsgericht, Meister Eder und sein Pumuckl and Die zweite Heimat - Chronik einer Jugend) and radio radio plays. She became more widely known as Grandma Soleder, first in the radio series Die Grandauers und ihre Zeit alongside Karl Obermayr and Ilse Neubauer and then nationwide in the television series Löwengrube (1989 to 1992), where she acted alongside Jörg Hube and Christine Neubauer.

        "content": "The Douce Apocalypse is an illuminated manuscript of the Book of Revelation, dating from the third quarter of the 13th century, preserved in the Bodleian Library under the reference Douce 180. The manuscript contains 97 miniatures.  It has been called \"one of the glories of English thirteenth-century painting\".\n\n\n== History ==\nThe manuscript contains in its first historiated initial two characters, a knight and a lady kneeling in prayer before the Trinity and bearing the arms of two sponsors of the manuscript: Edward, Prince of Wales and future Edward I of England, and his wife, Eleanor of Castile.  The work was carried out in successive stages between 1254, the date of their marriage, and 1272, when the prince acceded to the throne.  On stylistic and other grounds a more precise date of between 1265 and 1270 has been proposed.  The manuscript was made in Westminster, or perhaps Canterbury.  No later owner is identified until the 19th century, when it was put up for sale at Christie's by William Wilson in 1833.  It was acquired the same year by Francis Douce, who left his collection to the Bodleian Library at the University of Oxford on his death in 1834.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe manuscript is composed of two parts. The first (ff. 1–12) contains an incomplete text of the Book of Revelation in Old French, including anonymous comments without miniatures and a large historiated initial at the beginning.  The second (ff. 13r–61r) contains the same text in Latin with comments taken from those traditionally attributed to Berengaudus.  This second part contains 97 miniatures, each occupying half a page.  It remains unfinished, with some of the miniatures still in draft form.  The style of the miniatures is directly inspired by that current at the time of Saint Louis in Paris.  It may have been made in the same workshop as the manuscript of the Apocalypse of the Bibliothèque nationale de France MS Lat. 10474.  Three slightly different styles are distinguishable, suggesting that three artists may have been responsible.  The binding of the manuscript, dating from the 1580s, is of gold-stamped leather over pasteboard.\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "Pasja is an installation art by Dorota Nieznalska, a contemporary Polish artist, belonging to the trend of critical art, exhibited at the Gdańsk Wyspa Gallery in 2001. The installation consisted of two parts: a video showing a man exercising in a gym and a metal cross suspended on a chain with an embedded photograph of a penis in the central place.\nThe juxtaposition of these two elements – a symbol sacred to Christians and male genitalia – sparked significant controversy in the media and subsequently in society, provoking a discussion about the boundaries of art and freedom of artistic expression. Nieznalska was accused of offending religious sentiments and in 2003 was sentenced to perform community service. However, she appealed the verdict and in 2010 was acquitted of all charges.\n\n\n== Circumstances of creation ==\nIn 1999, Nieznalska first addressed religion and religiosity in her diploma work titled Absolution (an installation composed of photographs, video, and a wooden confessional). At that time, she was also interested in issues related to the sources of evil, domination, violence, aggression, and earlier, the problem of rape (the installation Modus Operandi from 1998). This is reflected, among other works, in her untitled series of photographs from 1999, depicting the relationship between a naked man and a submissive dog.\nThrough her partner, she became acquainted with the community of men exercising in amateur gyms. Visits to such places inspired her in 2000 to create the installation Omnipotence: A Male Kind, consisting of gym equipment (rubber mat, chalk, mirrors, steel exercise bars). The entire installation was illuminated with red light, accompanied by sounds recorded in the gym aimed at evoking sexual connotations: panting, groaning, and swearing. In 2001, Nieznalska exhibited a photograph titled Potency, depicting a man with a clenched fist in the groin area and tense muscles. Pasja installation was a continuation of the theme of masculinity, including physical strength and the cult of machismo, which the artist emphasized in numerous interviews.\n\n\n== Description of the installation ==\nPasja installation consists of a 45-minute looping, colorful video material (without sound), depicting in slow motion the face of a man exercising in a gym, and a steel cross measuring 104.7 x 90 x 19.5 cm suspended on a chain. The structural elements of the cross were custom-made at the Center of Polish Sculpture in Orońsko, then cut and welded together by Nieznalska. The entire surface of the cross features a colorful photograph of a penis, with the genitalia located at the central point. The cross was of the Greek type, as evidenced by its proportions – different from those of a Latin cross. The film was projected using a video projector, and the entire installation was presented in a darkened room.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\n\nPasja installation was first exhibited in 2001 at the Arsenal Gallery in Białystok. At the request of the director, Monika Szewczyk, the central place of the steel cross was covered with a white card (the director feared protests from local politicians from the League of Polish Families). On the occasion of the exhibition, a 28-page catalogue was issued (ISBN 83-86662-68-9) in Polish and English.\nThe installation was fully shown for the first time as part of the exhibition New Works, open from 14 December 2001, to 20 January 2002, from Monday to Friday from 11 AM to 2 PM, at the Wyspa Gallery in Gdańsk (Student House of the Academy of Fine Arts at 13/16 Chlebnicka Street). The exhibition received funding from the city budget (amounting to 2000 PLN), and its description and project were approved by the Vice President of Gdańsk, Adam Landowski, and the Director of the Department of Social Affairs in Gdańsk, Krystyna Konieczna. The curator was Grzegorz Klaman, a professor at the Academy of Fine Arts and the promoter of Nieznalska's diploma work. At his suggestion, the artist stayed in the gallery every day during the exhibition to explain the meaning of Pasja to visitors.\n\n\n== Meaning ==\nThe work explores the theme of the cult of the male body and the associated suffering. The title refers to the ambiguity of the word pasja (English: passion), which in Polish means both great enthusiasm for something and the suffering of Christ (its description, representation, and cult of this suffering). It is a term that refers to both the sacred and profane spheres. The artist juxtaposed in the installation the physical pain willingly undertaken by men who want to have a stronger body through exercise, as well as the suffering resulting from religious faith. This juxtaposition gave the installation an ironic undertone.\n\nNieznalska commented on her work as follows:Pasja, which was in no way related to religion or faith, and solely addressed the current passion in our culture for arming masculinity with muscles through persistent workouts in gyms, was mistakenly interpreted as an attack on the greatest sanctities.According to Piotr Piotrowski, the figure of the cross used in the installation does not refer to the figure of Christ, as he was crucified on a Latin cross. Nieznalska, however, used a Greek cross, symbolizing an ideal. The genitals in Nieznalska's work symbolize masculinity, and their placement on the Greek cross shows that they are an idealized symbol.\nOn the other hand, according to Izabela Kowalczyk, the juxtaposition of genitals (symbolizing masculinity) with the cross and gym workouts places masculinity in two contexts: the Catholic and consumerist models of life. She associates them with meanings such as suffering and self-sacrifice, showing that the standards set for men are practically unattainable. Kowalczyk also interprets Pasja as a work about the contemporary adoption of a new religion by consumer culture, seeing the gym in this context as a new temple.\nAccording to American theater researcher Magda Romanska, in Pasja, the male body is objectified and subjected to violence, similar to what traditionally happened to the female body. At the same time, the researcher sees in the installation an expression of empathy and an attempt to understand the tormented and pressured masculinity. The symbol of the cross used in Pasja does not have a religious dimension; it represents suffering as such. The genitals inscribed within it indicate the source of this suffering: the cultural ideal of masculinity, which forces men to exceed their physical capabilities to confirm their gender identity. Romanska also associates Pasja with feminist art, which addressed the oppressive action of culture on femininity and the compulsive behaviors it induced in women.\nA different interpretation was proposed by literary scholar Marcin Kowalczyk, placing Pasja in the context of carnivalesque. According to him, while the author did touch upon the theme of training for masculinity and the persistent building of a muscular silhouette through suffering, by using the symbol of the cross with a photograph of a penis in her work, she desacralized this symbol (placing it in the realm of the material and corporeal). Kowalczyk refers to other works of contemporary art that fit into the logic of carnivalesque: Andres Serrano's Piss Christ, Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, Renée Cox's Yo Mama's Last Supper, and others.\nOther interpretations relate the genitals placed on the cross to Christian iconography, in which the visible genitals on depictions of the crucified Christ symbolized his humanity. Critic and curator Paweł Leszkowicz interpreted Pasja as a portrait of male masochism, where men continually increase their physical strength. On the other hand, according to Agnieszka Sabor, Nieznalska's work is not a work of art (i.e., it lacks artistic value) but rather a statement of engaged, social, and feminist journalism and should only be considered through this prism.\nJerzy Krechowicz, the former rector of the Academy of Fine Arts in Gdańsk, testified in court that in his opinion, Nieznalska's work does not present any artistic value, is graphomaniacal, and was created only to provoke.\n\n\n== Reaction from the media and politicians ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nIn the 1990s and early 2000s, many works of artists, especially those belonging to the critical art movement, sparked controversy in the media and Polish society. The first work to provoke such a reaction was Katarzyna Kozyra's Pyramid of Animals (1993), followed by works such as Piotr Uklański's Nazis (1998), Zbigniew Libera's Lego. Concentration Camp (1996), and Maurizio Cattelan's sculpture depicting Pope John Paul II crushed by a meteorite. However, the greatest controversy was stirred by Nieznalska's installation, due to the juxtaposition of the cross (a Christian symbol of the death and resurrection of Jesus) and the genitals.\n\n\n=== Media ===\nOn the day of the exhibition opening, an article titled Feminist Passion appeared in the supplement to Gazeta Wyborcza's \"Co jest grane?\" (\"What's on?\") section, informing about the exhibition and the planned vernissage at 7:00 PM. Three days before the end of the exhibition, on 17 January 2002, an article titled Controversial Passion by Anna Urbańczyk was published in the local supplement to Gazeta Wyborcza. According to the author, the juxtaposition of the cross and male genitalia was surprising: It's no wonder that the realization shocks; it can (and does) offend religious feelings.\nOn January 18, in the main edition of the Fakty TVN news program, a segment about Pasja was aired, titled Trick. On January 19, other press and television media also expressed interest in the installation, and the matter gained enormous publicity. Everyone who commented on the exhibition admitted that they had not seen it personally.\n\n\n=== Incident at the gallery ===\nOn 21 January 2002, an incident involving members of the League of Polish Families, including Gertruda Szumska, Stanisław Żyła, and Robert Strąk, occurred in the gallery, which was closed to the public that day. They barged into the exhibition rooms demanding the release of the installation, specifically the steel cross, claiming that Nieznalska's work offended their religious feelings. However, their intention did not materialize because the exhibition had already been dismantled, and the artist refused to hand over the cross to them. Journalists were witnesses to this incident. Robert Strąk, a member of the League of Polish Families from Gdynia, issued a statement to the press at that time, in which he wrote, among other things:We believe that there should be an ethical code for artists or pseudo-artists because what Mrs. Nieznalska is doing, for example, is seeking cheap publicity. I believe that promoting one's name by insulting the religious feelings of others is disgraceful, and such things should not happen in our country, in the center of Europe.\n\n\n== Criminal proceedings ==\n\n\n=== Prosecution and trial ===\nBased on the notification of suspicion of committing a crime submitted by, among others, MP Robert Strąk and MP Gertruda Szumska, as well as private individuals, on 12 April 2002, the prosecutor filed an indictment with the District Court in Gdańsk, formulated under Article 196 of the criminal code:Whoever offends the religious feelings of others by publicly insulting an object of religious worship or a place intended for the public performance of religious ceremonies shall be subject to a fine, restriction of liberty, or imprisonment for up to 2 years.No preventive measure was applied to Nieznalska. The first hearing took place on 16 September 2002. Wojciech Cieślak served as Nieznalska's defense attorney throughout the entire process. Witnesses who claimed their religious feelings had been offended were questioned. They admitted, however, that they had not personally seen the exhibition but were familiar with it only from an article in Gazeta Wyborcza and a television report by TVN. The installation, as evidence in the case, was secured by the prosecutor's office. Tomasz Pączek, a private individual, acted as an auxiliary prosecutor. Nieznalska did not admit to committing the alleged acts and consistently maintained throughout the entire process that she did not intend to offend religious feelings.\nDuring the trial, there were multiple instances of the court's dignity being violated by the presence of the All-Polish Youth group in the courtroom, including shouting offensive and vulgar remarks directed at Nieznalska and displaying flags: red and white and white and blue. Members of the League of Polish Families gathered at the entrance to the courtroom with rosaries and crucifixes and sang religious hymns. The artist also received anonymous threatening phone calls and letters.\nA letter in defense of the accused was signed by, among others, Anda Rottenberg, Zbigniew Libera, Alicja Żebrowska, and Artur Żmijewski. Nieznalska was also defended by Amnesty International and Culture Minister Waldemar Dąbrowski in television interviews.\nOn 18 July 2003, the district court in Gdańsk found Dorota Nieznalska guilty of offending religious feelings and sentenced her to six months of community sentence consisting of unpaid controlled work for social purposes at a rate of 20 hours per month.\nAfter the verdict was announced, a letter in defense of the artist was written by Grzegorz Klaman and Aneta Szyłak, signed by, among others, Andrzej Turowski, Piotr Piotrowski, Wiesław Godzic, Kazimiera Szczuka, Maria Janion, Magdalena Tulli, and directors of Polish museums. Meanwhile, opponents of Nieznalska's installation issued a statement recognizing Pasja as an \"anti-Christian provocation\" and defending the court's verdict. The statement was signed by individuals such as Barbara Dobrzyńska, Grzegorz Górny, Janusz Kotański, Jacek Kowalski, Paweł Milcarek, Andrzej Nowak, Jan Pospieszalski, Maciej Pawlicki, and Piotr Semka.\nThe Catholic Church did not take an official position on the matter concerning Nieznalska.\n\n\n=== Retrial and appeal ===\nOn 28 April 2004, the district court in Gdańsk overturned the verdict of the district court, citing a lack of proper justification and a restriction on the right to defense. The case was reconsidered by the district court.\nFor the first time, the court appointed expert witnesses in the field of art history, religious studies, and media studies; it reviewed the TVN documentary Trick and reconstructed the installation. There were 27 court hearings, with dozens of witnesses, including 20 aggrieved persons. During one of the hearings, the private prosecutor testified that after watching the TV footage and photos in the newspaper, he felt humiliated and mocked by the artist as a Catholic.\nOn 9 February 2005, during the third hearing, the court did not allow the presence of the public during the trial. Consequently, outside the courthouse, there was a picket by The Greens and the Reason of the Polish Left on the side of Nieznalska's supporters, and the League of Polish Families and the All-Polish Youth on the side of her opponents. The Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights also sent a representative to the trial.\nOn 4 June 2009, the district court in Gdańsk acquitted Nieznalska of the charge of offending religious feelings. In the oral reasons for the judgment, it was explained that the crime of offending religious feelings could only be committed with direct intent (i.e., such must have been the purpose of the actions taken), while Nieznalska acted with conditional intent (she suspected that her actions might offend religious feelings and accepted it). The judge also emphasized the role of the media, whose biased and tendentious coverage contributed to the negative reception of Pasja by viewers and the filing of the report to the prosecutor's office. The justification included the sentence: There is no way to answer the question of whether the offended persons would also feel offended if they saw the installation in its entirety and knew the artist's intentions.\nFollowing this verdict, the prosecutor and the auxiliary prosecutor filed appeals to the higher court. By the judgment of 11 March 2010, the appealed acquittal verdict was upheld. In its reasoning, the appellate court confirmed the correctness of the lower court's opinion, accusing the media of manipulation: The aggrieved parties filed their report after the exhibition had ended, drawing their knowledge of its content from manipulated media reports that provided information about the case sporadically and in a scandalous atmosphere. According to the court, they did not have the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the artist's intentions and the context of her work. The spokesperson for TVN disagreed with these allegations.\nThe court's decision was criticized by right-wing circles and some lawyers. Piotr Kruszyński said that the fact that the aggrieved parties did not see the work is not a sufficient argument; it is an escape from the problem. According to Law and Justice MP Zbigniew Girzyński, the acquittal verdict in this case shows that one can offend the religious feelings of Catholics with impunity. The judgment was also criticized by the columnist Tomasz Terlikowski.\nFollowing the final judgment of the district court, the prosecutor had the right to file a cassation appeal to the Supreme Court. The European Humanist Federation appealed to the Gdańsk-Śródmieście District Prosecutor's Office to abandon this intention.\nThe costs of the trial were borne by the state treasury.\n\n\n== Effects of criminal proceedings ==\nAs a result of the scandal caused by Pasja installation and the court case, galleries belonging to the mainstream refused to exhibit Nieznalska's works. In an interview published in 2011, the author stated that she faced ostracism in the artistic community. She repeatedly applied for a scholarship from the Ministry of Culture, but only received it in 2009.\nThree days before the announcement of the first verdict, Nieznalska photographed a whip made by herself with a strap and her own (cut) hair. The photograph is titled Hair N. before 18.07.03 and is part of a series of photos called Implantation of Perversions. In 2005, the artist created a black leather case for the cross, which was part of Pasja installation, with four zippers allowing for the regulation of the visibility of the photo hidden inside. She titled the case Fetish. Another direct reference to the trial was the exhibition 196 k.k., which took place in early 2012 at the Ego Gallery in Poznań.\nPasja installation, as evidence in the case, was kept in the court's custody for eight years. During the trial, Grażyna Kulczyk and Piotr Piotrowski, the director of the Warsaw National Museum at the time, expressed interest in purchasing the installation. However, the transaction could not take place for legal reasons. After regaining possession of Pasja, Nieznalska declared that she wanted the installation to be placed in a Polish public institution rather than a private collection. Currently, it is in the artist's possession. Pasja has not been exhibited since the end of the trial.\nGrzegorz Klaman commented on the trial in 2002 with a video titled 196 k.k., in which he reads offensive comments about Nieznalska posted on the trojmiasto.pl internet forum, slapping her and making her cry. A similar title (Paragraph 196 k.k.) is given to Dorota Nieznalska's work from 2010, in which the author, standing with her back to the viewer, whispers the dates of subsequent court hearings.\nWyspa Gallery, founded by Grzegorz Klaman and run by the Wyspa Progress Foundation, rented premises belonging to the Academy of Fine Arts in Gdańsk free of charge; on 29 January 2002, the senate, at the rector's request, refused to continue cooperation with the Foundation. According to Klaman, the reason for this decision was the scandal surrounding Pasja exhibition, but Prof. Sławoj Ostrowski of the Academy of Fine Arts claimed that economic reasons were the main factor.\nAgata Araszkiewicz, writing for the magazine Obieg, compared Nieznalska's trial to the case of Rita Gorgonowa (due to what the author perceived as a similar atmosphere in which both criminal trials took place).\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nKowalczyk, Izabela (2002). \"Dorota Nieznalska: porozmawiajmy o mężczyznach\".

In 1936, the Smithsonian's Anthropological Department commissioned a series of \"family portrait-sculptures of ancient Austrians.\" Koller worked with a sculptor team. They used prehistoric skulls to model scientifically accurate heads for exhibition in an early example of forensic facial reconstruction. \nKoller published a paper in 1935, Schädelkunde der Juden (Skull science of the Jews), which was a craniologic study of the Jewish population of Constantinople. She joined the NSDAP in 1938.\nKoller worked for the Natural History Museum where she created a historical bust of St. Leopold which was exhibited at the 500th anniversary of his canonization.\n\n\n== References ==",

She then traveled at home and abroad. For her artistic work, she made studies in the Zwickauer mining district.\nShe lived for many years in Chemnitz (Karl-Marx-Stadt) at Kassbergstrasse 40, a house that was destroyed by bombs in 1945. Hanna Klose-Greger wrote numerous historical novels based on her precise knowledge of historical events, some of which she illustrated and decorated with her own book covers and dust jackets. She also created commercial graphic works such as posters and postcards, including the award-winning official festive map for the inauguration of Chemnitz town hall in 1911. She also created designs for interior decorations. The magazine \"Innendekoration\" published her design for a children's play corner in the \"Spielwinkel\" apartment in 1916.\nKlose-Greger was a member of the Deutschen Werkbund (DWB), as well as the Chemnitzer Künstlerkreis and the Reichsverband bildender Künstler Deutschlands. She was one of the artists ostracized by the Nazis as degenerate. In 1937, her lithograph \"The Scholar\" was confiscated from the Kunsthütte Chemnitz and destroyed as part of the \"Degenerate Art\" campaign.\n\n\n== Works as a writer ==\nHab mich lieb.

        "content": "Sean Bagniewski (born 1983) is an American politician and attorney who has represented the 35th district in the Iowa House of Representatives since January 2023, which consists of parts of northwest Des Moines in Polk County. He is a member of the Democratic Party.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBagniewski was born in 1983 in La Crosse, Wisconsin and was raised in Des Moines, Iowa in a trailer park by a single mother. He attended Theodore Roosevelt High School. He received a bachelor's degree from Truman State University and received a Juris Doctor degree from Drake University Law School.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nPrior to being elected, Bagniewski clerked for Governor Tom Vilsack and served as chair of the Polk County Democrats. Bagniewski announced his candidacy for the open 35th district seat in the Iowa House of Representatives shortly after decennial redistricting in 2021. He ran unopposed in the Democratic primary on June 7, 2022, winning with over 98.8 percent of the vote, and defeated independent candidate Dennis McCullough in the general election on November 8 with over 76 percent of the vote. He assumed office on January 1, 2023, with his term officially beginning on January 9.\nBagniewski is a member of the Appropriations, Commerce, Government Oversight and Transportation committees.\nIn December 2023, Bagniewski announced that he is running for reelection.\nBagniewski has said that his priorities include economic growth and education. He is pro-choice and supports stricter gun laws.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nBagniewski works as an attorney and federal contract administrator. He has a wife, Lindsay, and two children. He resides with his family in the Beaverdale neighborhood of Des Moines. He is the co-founder of the New Iowa Project, a Democratic volunteer network that seeks to increase voter registration and turnout.\nBagniewski was terminated from his job as a Medicaid contract manager with Maximus Health Services shortly after being elected, stirring minor controversy. According to Axios, Maximus received a letter from Iowa Medicaid director Elizabeth Matney eight days after his election stating that Bagniewski's position was full time and that they do not allow exceptions. Matney also wrote that the state required Maximus to submit a transition plan for Bagniewski within two weeks. Bagniewski claimed that there were no alternative positions available, and he was fired on January 29. He pointed to an Iowa law requiring workers elected to a government office be granted a leave of absence from their regular employment, and also claimed that he was falsely told by Iowa Department of Human Services officials that he could keep his job if he was elected. A spokesperson of the DHS told Axios that Maximus has the sole discretion to make employment decisions necessary to their work. Bagniewski said that he would seek legal advice regarding the termination.\n\n\n== Electoral history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Patrick Home (22 May 1728 – 19 December 1808) was the Scottish MP for Berwickshire from 1784 till 1796.\nPatrick Home was born 22 May 1728 to Rev. Ninian Home and his second wife, Margaret Home.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHis father was parish minister of Sprouton, Roxburghshire but was deposed in 1718 for drunkenness and Jacobitism, he became the proprietor of Billie and Wedderburn by buying up the debts of their impoverished owners. Ninian Home died in 1744 and Patrick Home inherited £1,000. In 1766, he succeeded to Wedderburn on the death of the last of the Wedderburn line.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nIn 1784, he was elected MP of Berwickshire with the support of Henry Dundas. In Parliament, he followed William Pitt the Younger and voted for his parliamentary reform proposals on 18 April 1785.\nHe had hoped to make his nephew Ninian succeed him as MP in 1789 but through lobbying from Patrick and George Home, Pitt made Ninian Governor of Grenada in August 1792. On 15 March 1796, he voted against the abolition of the slave trade which was one of his last actions as MP. Home resigned in 1796 due to deafness and frailty.\n\n\n== Marriage to Jane Graham ==\nIn May 1771, Patrick Home married Jane, the daughter of John Graham. Jane's brother, also called John Graham, was owner of the Douglaston estate in Grenada from 1768 and a close friend of Patrick's nephew, Ninian. Graham also owned several plots in Tobago and Patrick helped him become Governor of Tobago in 1769. While married, they lived in Italy but separated in 1779, and Jane joined a Belgian convent and became a nun. Patrick still remained friends with her family and managed the Douglaston estate on behalf of his brother-in-law. John stayed at Wedderburn until his death in 1782. Patrick was an executor of his estate and as such was responsible for selling the land and the slaves that his brother-in-law had owned alongside his fellow trustees.\nHe died on 19 December 1808.\n\n\n== References ==",

She has been an actress at the Ohnsorg-Theater since May 27, 1990 and has played alongside well-known actors such as Heidi Kabel, Jürgen Pooch, Ursula Hinrichs and Uwe Friedrichsen.\nIn 1996, she founded the Pyrmonter Theater Companie with several fellow actors.\nShe directed her first play in 1999 with the fairy tale Der Räuber Hotzenplotz. Sandra Keck made a name for herself as an author with the musical Wi rockt op platt, which she wrote for the Ohnsorg Theater's anniversary season in 2002/03 and which was performed at the theater and on tour from September 28, 2002, to June 2009.\nSince Keck did not agree with the modernization course of the artistic director Michael Lang, who was appointed in 2017, she left the permanent ensemble of the Ohnsorg Theatre. Some of the staff shared her criticism of the theater's changed orientation towards more High German and modern plays. In May 2023, she was elected by the Niederdeutsche Bühne association, owner of the theater, as chairwoman of the association and thus chairwoman of the supervisory board of Ohnsorg-Theater GmbH. This led to the resignation of supporters of the modernization course, including the artistic director Murat Yeginer.\n\n\n== Radio plays (selection) ==\n2006: Dylan Thomas: Ünner den Melkwoold (Rosi Pröve/Janne Hoosband) - Edited and directed by Hans Helge Ott (Original radio play - RB/NDR)\n2019-2023: Seker is seker (various authors) - Edited and directed by Ilka Bartels (Original radio play, series, 20 episodes - RB/NDR)\n\n\n== Works ==\n Lees mol'n beten ...

        "content": "The Independent Commission for the Study of Sexual Abuse of Children in the Portuguese Catholic Church was an independent working group, which was created following an invitation addressed to pedopsychiatrist Pedro Strecht, at the end of 2021, by José Ornelas, president of the Conference Episcopal Portuguesa (CEP), to carry out a study on practices of sexual abuse of minors within the Portuguese Catholic Church, covering the period between 1950 and 2022.\nIt began its work in January 2022, with a team chosen by Pedro Strecht, defining a period of one year as its duration, with the final presentation of a report.\nThe commission is made up of a central nucleus of five people from different professional areas, to which another member is added as an external observer.   They are: Pedro Strecht, Coordinator  (pedopsychiatrist),  Ana Nunes de Almeida  (sociologist, researcher in the area of childhood, family and school),  Daniel Sampaio  (psychiatrist, full professor),  Álvaro Laborinho Lúcio  ( judge advisor  ),  Filipa Tavares  ( social assistant ),  and Catarina Vasconcelos, external member (anthropologist,  filmmaker). The commission also included the participation of  Vasco Ramos  (sociologist), Ana Sofia Varela (clinical psychologist) and  Catarina Pires  (journalist).\nTo study the Church Archives, an historian,  Francisco Azevedo Mendes was invited. He independently formed the Historical Research Group (GIH) with three other researchers:  Júlia Garraio  (specialist in gender studies),  and Rita Almeida de Carvalho  and  Sérgio Ribeiro Pinto  (historians).\n\n\n== Methodology ==\nThe decision to create a Study Commission for sexual abuse committed by members of the Catholic Church, in November 2021, followed instructions from  Pope Francis  in 2019, defending “zero tolerance” towards situations of sexual abuse of children.   These principles had already led to the creation, in that same year, of twenty-one Diocesan Commissions, made up of professionals from various areas and, at the beginning of 2022, of a National Coordination of the same, chaired by the judge advisor José Souto de Moura .\nThe Independent Commission made the fundamental methodological choice of placing the victims at the center of its study, encouraging them to testify and giving them a voice.\nThe Commission designated the various forms of victims' participation as \"testimonies\" and excluded the use of the word \"complaint\", which presupposed a judicial reading that was not present in the field of its work.\nThe Commission prepared a questionnaire, placed online (for self-completion or completion with the help of a member of the Commission) and provided a telephone line (where anyone could call and give testimony or information) and conducted in-person interviews.\nThe Church's historical archives were researched, looking for and studying existing documentation on sexual abuse of children between 1950 and 2022 by members of the Church, in order to understand how the ecclesiastical structure had dealt with the occurrence of these crimes.  Diocesan bishops and superiors of Portuguese religious institutes were also interviewed, in order to reconstruct their biographies and formative and spiritual trajectories and the way they viewed the problem of sexual abuse in the Church.\n\n\n== Conclusions ==\nOn  February 13, 2023, the Independent Commission released, in a session at the  Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, in  Lisbon , a report with the conclusions of the work carried out throughout 2022 and which resulted in the collection of hundreds of testimonies from victims: 512 testimonies were received validated, based on which \"a minimum number\" of 4,815 victims were identified.\nThe report, however, states that the data found in ecclesiastical archives regarding the incidence of sexual abuse should be understood as \"the tip of the  iceberg\". The Historical Research Group (GIH)  only had access to the ecclesiastical archives in October 2022, and so many documents remained to be studied. Access had to be granted  by special Vatican authorizations.\nIn 52% of cases, victims only revealed the abuse they suffered an average of 10 years after it occurred and in 43% of cases this complaint only happened when they contacted the Commission.\nIn 77% of cases, victims never filed a complaint with the Church and only in 4% of cases was a judicial complaint filed.\nThe Commission sent 25 cases to the Public Prosecutor's Office out of the 512 validated testimonies received throughout the year, even though the majority of these cases have already expired. The statute of limitations of cases, on the one hand, and anonymity on the other, are the main reasons for this reduced number of cases handed over to Justice.\nThe 1960s, 70s and 80s were those that recorded a greater number of cases of sexual abuse within the Church in Portugal.\nMany cases have remained unidentified, as in diocesan archives, in particular, there is “the ambiguity that characterizes a significant part of ecclesiastical correspondence from the 20th century”.  “The problem of sexual abuse is often not explicitly mentioned,” says the report.\nThe average age of the victims was, at the time of the release of the report, around 52 years old.  52.7% were men, 47.2% were women and 88.5% were residents of mainland Portugal, mainly in the districts of Lisbon, Porto, Braga, Setúbal and Leiria, but the abuses are spread throughout the country.  Of those abused, 53% continue to claim to be Catholic and 25.8% are practicing Catholics.\nThe percentage of graduates among victims of abuse is 32.4%, while 12.9% are postgraduates.\nAs children, 58.6% of those abused who testified lived with their parents, 1/5 were institutionalized, while 7.8% belonged to single-parent families.\nAlmost all of the abusers of victims contacted by the Independent Commission were men and mostly priests.   97% of abusers were men and in 77% of cases they were priests, and in 47% of cases the abuser was part of the child's close relationships.   The profile of abusers is varied, with a predominance of young adults with  psychopathological  structures , aggravated by risk factors such as alcoholism or poor impulse control.\nMale victims suffered mainly from “anal sex, manipulation of sexual organs and masturbation”, while women suffered, in most cases, from “insinuation”.\nAbuse occurred mainly between 10 and 14 years of age (the average was 11.2 years, 11.7 for boys and 10.5 for girls), 57.2% were abused more than once and 27.5% reported that they had been victims for more than a year.  In the case of boys, in 77% of cases the abuser was a priest.\nMost of the abuse occurred in seminaries (23%), in the church - in various places, including the altar - (18.8%), in the confessional (14.3%), in the rectory (12.9%) and in Catholic schools (6.9%).\nThe Independent Commission recognizes that “it is usually the victims [of abuse] who initiate the silencing, due to feelings of fear, shame and guilt”.\nIn later stages of adult life, “psychological and/or psychiatric support is necessary to intervene in various clinical conditions, such as anxiety and depressive mood disorders linked to  post-traumatic stress  situations ”, added the Commission.\nThe Independent Commission recommended that the Church create a new commission to continue studying and monitoring the topic, with members internal and external to the Church.\nFurthermore, it recommends “the recognition, by the Church, of the existence and extent of the problem and commitment to its adequate future prevention”, namely through “compliance with the concept of 'zero tolerance' proposed by Pope Francis”.\nThe adoption of the “moral duty of reporting by the Church and collaboration with the  Public Prosecutor's Office  in cases of alleged crimes of sexual abuse”, the “effective request for forgiveness regarding situations that occurred in the past and their materialization”, as well as the “ ongoing and external training and supervision of members of the Church, particularly in the area of sexuality (their own and that of children and adolescents)”, are other recommendations that the commission leaves to the Church hierarchy.\n“Continued psychological support for past, current and future victims” is also seen as a responsibility of the Church, in conjunction with the  National Health Service  .\nThe Independent Commission suggests that the statute of limitations for crimes of abuse be increased to the victim's 30th birthday, asking the  Assembly of the Republic  to change the law.\nOther recommendations to civil society include the “carrying out of a national study on sexual abuse of children in their various socialization spaces”, the “unequivocal recognition of the Rights of the Child”, the “empowerment of children and families on the topic: the role of School”, the “increase in the age of the victim for the purpose of prescribing crimes” and the “speed of assessment and response from the justice system”.\nThe working group also highlights the need to “strengthen the role of social communication in research and treatment of the topic” and “increase emotional literacy on the true needs of child and youth development, especially in the affective and sexual field”.\nIn general, says the Commission, the Portuguese Catholic hierarchy “is in favor” of Pope Francis' position in condemning abuse.\nThe Commission decided that at the end of the work, a list of alleged abusers, still active, would be sent to the Public Ministry and the Portuguese Episcopal Conference, for appropriate analysis, recommending, however, maximum respect for secrecy.\n\n\n== Reactions to the report ==\nOn the following March 2, the Portuguese Episcopal Conference (CEP) reacted to the report  at the end of an extraordinary plenary assembly, which ended with a press conference with the president of the CEP, José Ornelas, who responded to the questions, the vice-president, Virgílio Antunes , and the secretary-general, Manuel Barbosa.\nAt the press conference, José Ornelas stated that no suspected priest would be removed. “We only have names, it’s very difficult. In order to have the necessary elements to move forward, it is clear that we need to have data and this list that we received only has names. (...) I can't remove someone from the Ministry just because someone accused him. It’s not enough to say, there needs to be a solid foundation”, explained the bishop.\nA “name by name” investigation will be carried out: the list of priests and other active religious accused of abuse will be made known to all dioceses so that each of them can be investigated. Then, each diocese will define “the appropriate measures” in each case: “within each diocese, it is each bishop who has to find, in the light of civil law and canon law , what are the appropriate measures to take”.\nIt is planned to create a new independent commission that will continue to monitor this matter within the Church.\nNo compensation was announced from the Church for the victims. “If there is an evil done by someone, it is that someone who is responsible. It’s an individual issue”, stated José Ornelas.\nRegarding the removal of bishops suspected of covering up sexual abuse crimes within their respective dioceses, the bishop was cautious: “We do not agree with situations like these, but we also do not embark on any accusation of cover-up”.\n\n\n== Reactions to the Church's position ==\nThe Church's reaction to the  report was immediately subject to much criticism from various sectors of Portuguese society, including from some elements of the Independent Commission itself.\nFor professor Daniel Sampaio, the press conference was disappointing.  He considers that the victims were put in the background.  “The Church did not side with the victims” — he said.  As for the list of names, he emphasizes that this list resulted from the sum of the names indicated by the victims in the IC investigation with the names that they found in the Church's archives.  There should be preventive suspension of individuals who are under suspicion.\nJorge Wemans,  journalist and catholic, one of the signatories of the open letter  that led to the Independent Commission, considers that the Church has taken “a step back” on the path it had started to follow. He believes that there was a lack of “concrete measures” and, above all, a \"reflection on the exercise of power in the Church and the deep  clericalism  that dominates it\", which is precisely where \"the possibility of abuse lies\".\nLisete Fradique  from the movement Nós Somos Igreja (We Are Church), stated that the measures presented by CEP are a handful of nothing.   \"I couldn't see anything concrete. There was a systematic escape into legal issues. There's a moral problem here,\" she said.   She also argued that those covering up abuse cases \"should have the courage to come out.\"\nLisete Fradique highlighted that, despite the apology to victims of abuse, something was missing in the way the Church, in the person of José Ornelas, addressed the victims.  “You don’t see compassion,” she said.\nÂngelo Fernandes, from the  Quebrar o Silêncio (Breaking the Silence) association , raised doubts about the psychological support that will be given to victims.   \"How will psychological support be operationalized in dioceses? My reading is that victims were not comfortable going to dioceses to talk about their experiences of abuse.\"\nThe APAV - Associação Portuguesa de Apoio à Vítima (Portuguese Victim Support Association) stated that the measures presented by the Church reveal \"signs that there is some will\", but little else.   For the association, there is a distrust regarding the victims' words, which worries them.\nFor Carla Ferreira, APAV responsible for monitoring cases of violence against children and young people, the announced internal investigation must take place or the acts will be allowed to continue to occur, putting potential victims at risk.  She also defended that people under investigation should be removed preventively.\nPedro Strecht, who coordinated the work of the Independent Commission, argued that the data sent to the Church are \"important and significant\", and not exactly new.  \"The list that was delivered is part of what the Church already knows, diocese by diocese. This data was also worked on by the Historical Investigation Group (GIH) in the research that was carried out in the historical and secret archives, so I see no reason for concern\", said Pedro Strecht.  He further added that the Church has \"data on each of these cases.\"\nLaborinho Lúcio, who considered the Church's response \"very lax\", stated that \"the bishops, all of them, had a lot of information about the facts that they now say do not exist.\"  Laborinho Lúcio hopes that \"Pope Francis' church\" will get the better of the ultra-conservative faction in the Church, \"which is not the slightest sensitive to the suffering of the victims\".\nThe President of the Portuguese Republic,  Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa — admittedly Catholic and who in October 2022 had been widely criticized for, when commenting on an assessment of the number of victims collected by the CI, stating that 400 cases \"did not seem like particularly high\" — commenting on the CEP's position, stated: \"It ignored all the problems.\"  He added: \"it fell short on all important points\": \"in terms of accountability\", by \"failing to take preventative positions\" regarding priests suspected of abusing minors and \"falling short in terms of reparation\" owed to victims.  \"Everything was the opposite\" of what it should have been, this being made worse because \"the Church is a fundamental institution in society\" that \"the country misses\".  \"If you fail in such a basic situation, it has repercussions throughout the country.\"\n\n\n== Grupo Vita ==\nOn April 26, 2023, the Catholic Church presented Grupo Vita, a body that will monitor cases of sexual abuse against minors and vulnerable adults within the ambit of the Catholic Church in Portugal. The project follows the Independent Commission's investigations.The new body is directed by psychologist Rute Agulhas and consists of two groups: executive and consultative. It is defined by the responsibles as being \"exempt, autonomous\". Despite this, José Ornelas said that Grupo Vita's operations will be coordinated with diocesan teams, meaning a  cooperative action between the committee of experts and the Church.\nDuring the group's presentation, Rute Agulhas said that sexual violence is \"a transversal phenomenon, with a higher intra-family prevalence. The Church is a context, like others.\" And she assured: \"The church takes on a pioneering role here.\"  The Vita Group will work in conjunction with the  teams from the Comissões Diocesanas de Proteção de Menores e Adultos Vulneráveis  (Diocesan Commissions for the Protection of Minors and Vulnerable Adults)  .\n\n\n== See also ==\nCatholic Church sexual abuse cases\nFrederico Cunha\nCarlos Filipe Ximenes Belo\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nComissão Independente para o Estudo dos Abusos Sexuais de Crianças na Igreja Católica Portuguesa (February 2023).

After her state examination, she received her doctorate in history. From 1971, she initially worked as a history and Latin teacher, later also as head of history in teacher training. In 1986, she became head teacher at the Krefeld Ricarda-Huch Gymnasium. She also held teaching positions at the University of Düsseldorf.\nSince 1974, Freya Stephan-Kühn has published numerous didactic essays and was involved in the conception of textbooks such as the history work Zeiten und Menschen and the Latin work Orbis Romanus. She also headed the North Rhine-Westphalian State Association of History Teachers.\nIn addition, she was interested in all kinds of historical literature for young people and its historical source value for schools and a young readership. She herself had an extensive collection of historical literature for young people, which she made accessible to the public in several exhibitions.\nShe herself wrote numerous historical non-fiction books with which she wanted to give children a lively and creative approach to history. Her first work, Have fun with the Romans! (1982), published by Arena-Verlag in Würzburg, was so successful that she has since also edited the Arena-Kinderbuch-Klassik series for the publisher. In the following years, she also prepared the history of ancient Egypt, Europe, the Middle Ages and the Biedermeier period for her young readers in a similar way. In 1985, she was included in the honorary list of the European Youth Book Prize in Padua. She also wrote stories and tales for various holidays.\nIn 1997, the Landesverband Nordrhein-Westfälischer Geschichtslehrer e.V. awarded the Freya-Stephan-Kühn-Preis for the first time. Since then, it has been awarded every two years.Freya Stephan-Kühn died of a serious illness on January 10, 2001 at the age of only 57.\n\n\n== Works (selection) ==\n1976 Martial - Epigramme.

        "content": "Owen Murphy (September 2, 1893 – April 3, 1965) was an American songwriter, film maker, and writer for radio, film, and theatre. He worked as a lyricist, composer, and playwright for Broadway musicals and as a songwriter for Tin Pan Alley in the 1920s and 1930s. As a film maker he was an early maker of industrial films. He also was a writer for comedian Joe Cook for both the stage and radio.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nOwen Murphy was born on September 2, 1893, in Mount Clemens, Michigan. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Notre Dame and a Juris Doctor degree from the University of Pittsburgh School of Law. A self taught composer, he became a member of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers in 1928.\n\n\n== Later life and career ==\nMurphy began his career as a songwriter for Broadway in 1921 with the show The Mimic World for which he co-authored the music with Jean Schwartz and Lew Pollack, and both the lyrics and book with Harold Atteridge and James Hussey. This was followed by the musical Red Pepper which was staged at the Shubert Theatre in 1922. For this show, Murphy co-authored the music with Albert Gumble and the lyrics with Howard Emmett Rogers. Gumble and Murphy's score was rooted in jazz at a time when musical tastes on Broadway were just beginning to shift in that direction. Their forward thinking score shocked the reviewer in the New York Post who criticized their music for its embrace of that music genre.Murphy was co-lyricist with Eugene Conrad for the 1924 musical Top-Hole at the Fulton Theatre, and that same year was a contributing lyricist to the musical revue Artists and Models at the Astor Theatre. He was a contributing writer to both the book and lyrics of The Earl Carroll Vanities of 1925. That same year he co-wrote both the music and lyrics for The Greenwich Village Follies with Harold Levey. He collaborated with Levey again on both the music and lyrics for the 1926 musical Rainbow Rose which was staged at the Forrest Theatre. With composer Milton Ager he co-wrote the music to the 1928 musical Rain or Shine which was written as starring vehicle for comedian Joe Cook.With Robert A. Simon, Murphy co-wrote the lyrics to the musical The Gang's All Here which was staged at the Imperial Theatre in 1931. He was a composer and lyricist for, Hold Your Horses (1933, Winter Garden Theatre), in collaboration with many other contributing creatives. It too was a musical crafted specifically for Joe Cook. Murphy went on to write regularly for Cook as both a song and script writer for his performances on both stage and radio in the 1930s.Murphy was the founder of Owen Murphy Productions, and was a pioneer maker of industrial films. After marrying Marion Murphy (née Herson), he lived first in Ho-Ho-Kus, New Jersey and then Stone Harbor, New Jersey. The couple had two sons and a daughter together. A Roman Catholic, he was member of St. Paul Church of St. Brendan the Navigator Parish in Stone Harbor, New Jersey.Murphy died on  April 3, 1965, in Stone Harbor at the age of 71.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nBaillie, Laureen, ed.

        "content": "The Monument to the Fallen (Italian: Monumento ai caduti) consists of sculptures, reliefs and a plaque affixed in the 1960s to the 18th-century bell-tower (Torre di San Paolo) built attached to the now deconsecrated church of San Ludovico (previously dedicated to San Paolo and serving the adjacent Convent of that name. The bell tower is found at the intersection of Strada Macedonio Melloni, Borgo del Parmigianino, and Strada Cavour in central Parma, Italy.\n\n\n== History and description ==\n\n\n=== Bell-tower ===\n\nThe adjacent church had been rebuilt in a late-Renaissance style from 1584 to 1604, but the Baroque renovation of the bell-tower was not started until 1690 with designs by Domenico Valmagini. Restoration took decades to complete.\n\n\n=== Monument ===\nIn 1961, the Monument to those fallen in all wars (Monumento dedicato ai caduti di tutte le guerre) was installed on the side of the tower facing via Cavour. It is notable that the monument did not honor those of any specific war, although the bronze relief with the grim visages of five soldiers, framed by barbed wire, recalls soldiers of the wars in the first half of the twentieth century. The design was by the architect Mario Monguidi with the sculptures by Renato Brozzi and Luigi Froni. In a niche above the soldiers is a bronze kneeling figure in Ancient Roman battle uniform, representing the Italian lineage, with arms hanging straight down at sides, with a sword draped in front of his groin. In 1961, the plaque was inaugurated by the Italian president Giovanni Gronchi. It reads in the verses by Parmesan poet Jacopo Bocchialini (1878–1965); (in all capital letters and in a Sans-serif script, which recalls the script used by the fascists):\n\nThe monument is the site for wreath-laying on 4 November, the day memorializing the Italian armed forces: Giornata dell’Unità Nazionale e delle Forze Armate.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "After the Russo-Georgian War in August 2008, a number of incidents occurred in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Tensions between Georgia, the United States and the NATO on one side and Russia, South Ossetia and Abkhazia on the other side remained high in 2008–2009. There were expectations that armed hostilities between Russia and Georgia would resume in 2009.\n\n\n== Post-war events in 2008 ==\n\n\n=== September 2008 ===\nIn the beginning of September 2008, a $1 billion aid for Georgia was reported by the White House. Georgia would receive about half of aid during the remaining term of office of George Bush.\nOn 10 September 2008, a Georgian policeman was killed allegedly by Russian soldiers in a village north of Gori, Georgia. The shooting happened several hundred meters from a Russian checkpoint in Karaleti, 12 miles (19 km) from South Ossetia. Russian officials denied responsibility, saying that it may have been perpetrated by South Ossetians.\nOn 13 September 2008, a Georgian policeman was killed in Ganmukhuri on the administrative border between Abkhazia and Georgia.\nOn 21 September 2008, Georgian authorities stated a Georgian policeman was killed and three wounded after shots were fired \"from the direction of the [nearby] Russian army checkpoint\" on the administrative border between Abkhazia and Georgia, with the ensuing trade of fire between Georgian police and Abkhaz-controlled territory continuing for several minutes.\nOn 22 September 2008, a mine wounded two Georgian policemen on the administrative border between Abkhazia and Georgia.\nOn 24 September 2008, a Russian military truck was arrested near the village of Odzisi in the Mtskheta Municipality. The truck contained ammunitions and explosives. The Russian driver said he had lost his way. He was handed over to OSCE observers.\nBombing claimed the life of a 13-year-old South Ossetian resident in the outskirts of Tskhinvali.\n\n\n=== October 2008 ===\nOn 3 October 2008, seven Russian soldiers were killed and another seven wounded by a car bomb that exploded near the Russian military base. Among them was Colonel Ivan Petrik, the peacekeeper's Chief of Staff. The Russians accused the Georgians of orchestrating the \"terrorist attack\", claiming that just before the blast, the Russians had seized two cars with four Georgians and munitions, which were taken to Tskhinvali. Interfax was told by a military spokesman, \"During the search of one of the cars, an explosive device equivalent to some 20kg of TNT went off.\" The South Ossetian leader accused Georgia of \"state terrorism\", adding, \" We have no doubt that these terrorist acts are the work of Georgia special forces.\" The Georgian government blamed Russia for the incident, with the Interior Ministry spokesman Shota Utiashvili describing it as a provocation aimed to prolong Russian military presence in Georgia. Georgian official also said only Ossetians could enter the area controlled by Russia and suggested that only \"geniuses\" could arrange the stealing and transportation by the Ossetians. The attack was denounced by the French Presidency of the European Union.\nOn 6 October 2008, Abkhaz border guard was shot near the administrative border between Abkhazia and Georgia.\nOn 18 October 2008, Georgian media reported that a bridge in the Adzva village in Gori Municipality was partially blown up allegedly by Ossetians.\nOn 18 October 2008, according to South Ossetia, a police post was fired upon from an ethnic Georgian village, with no casualties. The acting Interior Minister Mikhail Mindzayev called the gunfire a series of provocations by Georgians. South Ossetian police were given orders to return fire should they be on the receiving end of a firing from the Georgian side.\nOn 21 October 2008, the police car was blown up by a mine near the village of Avnevi and one policeman was injured.\nOn 25 October 2008, a bomb exploded in the Georgian village near the administrative border with Abkhazia killing the governor of Georgia's Tsalenjikha Municipality, Giorgi Mebonia.\nOn 21 October 2008, the police car was blown up by a mine near the village of Avnevi and one policeman was injured.\n\n\n=== November 2008 ===\nOn 10 November 2008, in the morning two Georgian policemen were killed and three injured after the police car was exploded by a mine near the village of Dvani.\n\n\n== Relations in 2009 ==\n\n\n=== January 2009 ===\nOn 19 January 2009, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev banned arms trade and military co-operation with Georgia until December 2011. According to RIA Novosti, \"countries or individuals found to be in breach of these regulations will face economic and financial sanctions.\"\nOn 19 and 21 January, Russia demanded that Georgian military installations to be checked by Russian experts per a 1999 Vienna OSCE resolution on confidence and security-building measures; however, these calls were turned down by Georgia.\nOn 23 January 2009, Russia expressed concern over \"Georgia's expanding military presence on the borders of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.\" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov had claimed earlier that the EU monitors had confirmed the Georgian build-up.\nOn 26 January 2009, Russian junior sergeant Alexander Glukhov appeared in Tbilisi. He gave press interviews at McDonald's in the presence of Georgian Interior Ministry officials. The 21-year-old claimed that bad living conditions and problems with his superior forced him to desert. According to Georgian interior ministry, the right to stay in Georgia was requested by the soldier. The soldier declared that he applied for political asylum in Georgia. Russia requested Glukhov's release, claiming that he might be tortured.\n\n\n=== February 2009 ===\nOn 2 February 2009, at a meeting with the EU representatives, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko raised concerns over alleged Georgian buildup near South Ossetia.\nOn 6 February 2009, Georgia submitted the application against Russia to the European Court of Human Rights, continuing the process that began on 11 August 2008.\nIn late February 2009, Pavel Felgenhauer, a military analyst, said that Russia intended to provoke the death of the Russian soldier and invade Georgia from South Ossetia in order to topple the Saakashvili government.\n\n\n=== April 2009 ===\nOn 22 April 2009, automatic firearms fire was reported on the administrative border between Georgia and South Ossetia. Both sides accused each other for the incident.\n\n\n=== May 2009 ===\nOn 6 May 2009, former U.S. Ambassadors to Georgia William Harrison Courtney and Kenneth Spencer Yalowitz, and the former European Commission ambassador to Georgia, Denis Corboy, said that Russian military buildup and Moscow's anger over the \"unfinished business\" of the August 2008 war could cause a \"new tragedy\" in Georgia and called on the United States to work to avoid a new conflict.\n\n\n=== August 2009 ===\nOn 1 August 2009, Russian Defense Ministry said that in the prior days, Georgia had fired on the South Ossetian territory. The EU Monitoring Mission in Georgia (EUMM) said its monitors in the area did not see any evidence of the Georgian attack. Earlier, the EUMM had said that four blasts occurred inside South Ossetia due to unknown reasons. The EU Monitoring Mission in Georgia also said that its monitors could not make \"more complete assessment of the situation on the ground\" since they were barred from South Ossetia.\nOn 1 August 2009, The Telegraph reported that at least 28 Georgian policemen observing the boundary near South Ossetia had become casualties since the end of hostilities in August 2008.\nOn 3 August 2009, Georgian TV reported that Georgian and Russian checkpoints were attacked by South Ossetians with grenades. Georgian interior ministry reported that the vicinity of Plavismani was attacked at 21:30. South Ossetia accused Georgia of shelling South Ossetian territory from Plavismani at 22:05.\nRIA Novosti published an interview with South Ossetian president Eduard Kokoity. Kokoity said that he rejected the possibility of a new \"Georgian aggression\". He said he would demand ceding of the Truso Gorge (part of the Georgian administrative unit of Mtskheta-Mtianeti) to South Ossetia. He also talked about Georgian president Saakashvili: \"As for that lover of wars and bellicose slogans, that international criminal, I would advise him to be careful. Considering his behavior, Georgia has a shortage of mental hospitals.\"\nIt was reported that a situation was escalating before the war's first anniversary. The European Union called on \"all sides to refrain from any statement or action that may lead to increased tensions at this particularly sensitive time.\" On 4 August 2009, the Georgian Foreign Ministry deplored Russian \"deliberate attempts\" to raise tensions. Mikheil Saakashvili asked the US and EU to defuse the tensions.\nYulia Latynina stated that as soon U.S. Vice President Joe Biden declared that the United States would not supply arms to Georgia, the past year's scenario began repeating. Latynina criticized Kokoity's allegation that Tskhinvali had come under fire from the Georgian village of Nikozi, because Nikozi had already been wiped off the map by South Ossetia. Latynina ruled out the repetition of last year's Gleiwitz scenario because the world's attention was now focused on South Ossetia unlike in 2008. Latynina concluded that if the conflict was renewed, nobody would believe that Kokoity was responsible and instead the blame would fall on Putin.\nClose to the one year anniversary of the start of the war, internet attacks occurred that targeted one Georgian user. The Twitter account of a Georgian blogger, Cyxymu came under attack, leading to a several-hour-long downtime of the entire service.\nOn 14 August 2009, Shota Utiashvili, Georgia's Interior Ministry representative, said that the South Ossetian side had confessed to shelling of the Georgian villages.\n\n\n=== September 2009 ===\nIn late September 2009, the blast took place with no casualties near the village of Ergneti, south of Tskhinvali, 40 minutes before talks between the Georgian, South Ossetian, and Russian representatives.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGeorgia–Russia relations\nGeorgia–European Union relations\nGeorgia–NATO relations\nGeorgia–United States relations\nRussia–United States relations\nNATO–Russia relations\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "George Baillie (8 October 1763 – 11 December 1841) was the Scottish MP for Berwickshire from 1796 till 1818.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nGeorge Baillie was born 8 October 1763, his father was George Baillie, the younger brother of Thomas, 7th Earl of Haddington. His mother was Elizabeth Baillie (née Andrews), the daughter of John Andrews. He was educated at Trinity Hall, Cambridge in 1784 and on 13 Jult 1801, he married Mary, the daughter of Sir James Pringle, 4th Baronet.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nBaillie wished to become MP for Berwickshire as early as 1788 but supported Patrick Home as long as he choose to retain his seat. When Home's retirement was anticipated in December 1795, he applied for and obtained Henry Dundas' support, encouraged by his uncle Lord Haddington.\nBaillie silently supported William Pitt's government and did not oppose Henry Addington, whose additional customs duties he allegedly supported in a debate in June 1803 until on 23 and 25 April 1804, when he voted with the minorities on defence. He then supported the Second Pitt ministry and does not appear to have voted on Melville's censure on 8 April 1805. On 30 April 1806, he opposed the Grenville ministry on their repeal of the Additional Forces Acts 1803 passed by William Pitt.\nFrom 1807, he supported the government, though he was now considered a Melvillite and shared their tendency of dissatisfaction with Scottish patronage. In late 1807, a piece of local patronage that he had applied for was granted to a political enemy and that put him in \"a very unpleasant predicament\". He supported the government on the Scheldt inquiry and on 30 March 1810, voted with them.\nOn 1 January 1811, he voted with government minorities on the Regency. On 4 May 1812, he voted against sinecure reform, on 21 May, against Stuart Wortley's motion, and on 11 and 24 May 1813, against Catholic relief. On 31 May 1815, he voted against inquiry into the Regent's expenditure.\nIn June 1818, he retired when it was announced that parliament would be dissolved on 10 June 1818 before the 1818 United Kingdom general election. Baillie died on 11 December 1841.\n\n\n== Children ==\nGeorge Baillie had a daughter called Elizabeth \"Eliza Campbell with his wife Mary on 29 June 1803.\nShe married John Campbell, 2nd Marquess of Breadalbane on 23 November 1821 and became a Lady of the Bedchamber from January to July 1839.

        "content": "Aleksandar Ivić (March 6, 1949 – December 27, 2020) was a Serbian mathematician, specializing in analytic number theory. He gained an international reparation and gave, at universities around the world, lectures on the Riemann zeta function.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nAleksandar Ivić was born in Belgrade to two renowned linguists, the academician Pavle Ivić (1924–1999) and the academician Milka Ivić (1923–2011). His paternal grandfather was the historian Aleksa Ivić (1881–1948) and his maternal great-grandfather was the poet Vojislav Ilić (1862–1894), the son of the writer and minister of justice Jovan Ilić (1824–1901).\nIn 1967, Aleksandar Ivić successfully participated in the International Mathematical Olympiad. He graduated in 1971 from the University of Novi Sad with a bachelor's degree in science. As a graduate student in Faculty of Sciences of the University of Belgrade, he graduated with a master's degree in 1973 and a doctorate in 1975. His doctoral dissertation O nekim klasama aritmetičkih funkcija koje su vezane za raspodelu prostih brojeva (On certain classes of arithmetic functions linked to the distribution of prime numbers) was supervised by Đuro Kurepa. After working as an assistant from 1971 to 1976 at the Faculty of Science and Mathematics at the Faculty of Science and Mathematics at the University of Novi Sad, Ivić was appointed as assistant professor at the Faculty of Mining and Geology at the University of Belgrade in the Department of Applied Mathematics. There he was an assistant professor from 1976 to 1982, an associate professor from 1982 to 1988, and a full professor from 1988 to 2014, when he retired as professor emeritus.\nIvić was a member of the Mathematical Institute of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SANU) and served on the editorial boards of several international journals. He was a plenary lecturer at several international scientific conferences. He was a visiting professor at several universities around the world in Japan, China, Brazil, Finland, and elsewhere. He was recognized as one of the world's leading experts on analytic number theory related to the Riemann hypothesis and the Lindelöf hypothesis.\nThe bibliography of articles authored or coauthored by Ivić contains 231 titles. He was elected in 1988 a corresponding member in 1988 and in 2000 a regular member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SANU).\nHis Erdős number is 1, as he published papers with him in 1980 and 1986.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nAleksander Ivić married Milika Avramov in 1976. They divorced in 1990. From his first marriage, he became the father of two daughters, Natalija (born 1980) and Emilija (born 1984). His second marriage was to Sanda Rašković Ivić, whom he married in 1996. They became the parents of a daughter and two sons. Their younger son Jovan (1997–2022) committed suicide.\nIvić died in Belgrade.\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\n\n\n=== Articles ===\nIvić, Aleksandar (1973). \"An asymptotic formula for elements of a semigroup of integers\".

        "content": "Barrancas Fútbol Club, also known as Barrancas UMET is an Argentine football club located in the city of Buenos Aires. Established in 2023, it currently competes in Torneo Promocional Amateur, the fifth division of the Argentine football league system. To date, Barrancas is the younger football team to play in official competitions.The team has similar objectives than universities and colleges in the United States so Barrancas's players can access to student financial aids for the University of Belgrano.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe club was established in August 2023 in the Belgrano neighborhood of Buenos Aires after an initiative from a group of students of the University of Belgrano, a private study house. They had proposed that the university's football team (which competed in the College Amateur Sports Association) could participate in competitions organised by the Argentine Football Association.\nThus when AFA dissolved the Primera D Metropolitana and created Torneo Promocional Amateur, Barrancas UMET was invited by the association to be part of the recently created league. Barrancas UMET's first official match was on 27 February 2024 vs Juventud de Bernal. It ended in a 1–1 tie.\n\n\n== Related cases ==\nThe closest antecedent about strong bonds between a university and a football team is the merger of Universidad Abierta Interamericana (UAI) and Club Deportivo Social y Cultural Ferrocarril Urquiza, which joined forces to form UAI Urquiza in 2009. At the moment of the merger, Ferrocarril Urquiza was in the last position of Primera D and close to be disaffiliated. Since then, UAI Urquiza became one of the strongest women's football teams in Argentina, having won five titles to date.\n\n\n== Football in Belgrano ==\nThe neighborhood of Belgrano has a long tradition of being the home of notable football clubs such as legendary Alumni or Belgrano Athletic, which not only played in the top division of Argentina –Primera División– but also won several national and international championships in the origins of football in Argentina.C.A. River Plate and its home venue Estadio Monumental (which have been wrongly associated with neighbour district Núñez) are also located in the Belgrano neighborhood.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBarrancas Fútbol Club on Twitter",

        "content": "Peach walls are a French technique of growing peach trees beside walls, with limbs being espaliered or trellised. Peach walls were established as early as the 17th century in Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis.\nAt their peak in 1870, the Montreuil peach orchards were 600km long and produced 17 million peaches. These crops, unique alongside those of Chasselas de Thomery, near Fontainebleau, which adopted the same principle, enabled fruit varieties usually reserved for the mild climates of southern France to be produced in the climate of the Paris region.\n\n\n== History in Montreuil ==\n\nOn the vast Montreuil plateau, each narrow, elongated plot, oriented north–south, was enclosed by a 2.70 m-high wall, topped by a tile roof. The southern walls, which enclosed the plot, were set back from the road, to preserve a usable side. A fruit tree called \"costière en dehors\" was planted here.\nThe walls were floated with plaster to increase their thermal inertia, i.e. their heat retention capacity. By accumulating solar energy during the day and releasing it at night, they reduced the risk of frost and accelerated ripening. As Montreuil's subsoil was rich in gypsum, plaster was cheap and easy to produce.\n\nThe thickness of the walls, built on a foundation to prevent rising dampness, varied from 55 cm at the base to 25 cm at the top. A system of removable wooden roofs protected against spring rains, which can lead to peach blistering. Rolling mats insulated the fruit trees on cold nights.\nIn these isolated plots, temperatures were routinely 8 to 12 °C above ambient.\n\n\n=== Trellising and cultivation ===\n\nTo adapt to the plateau's limestone soil, peach trees were grafted onto almond rootstock trees. They were pruned to fit as close as possible to the heat-producing wall. The peach trees, trained in espaliers \"à la diable\", were leaning against the east and west walls, and trellised with canvas ties nailed into the masonry.\nThe central part of each plot was also planted with peach or apple trees, which did not need to be protected by walls. Wind-fed peach trees produced smaller fruit than trellised ones, but had one advantage: there was no need to brush the fruit, which lost its fuzz in the wind.\nThe presence of the vast Parisian market, with its proximity to Les Halles, provided a guaranteed outlet for these crops. The fruit merchants who came to Les Halles de Paris were known as montreuils, as were their peaches. Émile Zola mentions them in Le Ventre de Paris: \"the peaches above all, the blushing Montreuil ones, thin-skinned and fair like Northern girls\".\nThis production was complemented by floral crops (lilacs, daffodils, irises, delphiniums, roses, peonies), and by vine and raspberry plantations, which provided additional income for arboriculturists. They are also evoked by Zola, who mentions \"the brilliants and Valenciennes worn by the daughters of the great gardeners of Montreuil, who came among their roses\".\n\n\n=== At the king's table ===\nMontreuil peaches became famous thanks to their presence at the French court in the 17th century. This reputation facilitated their export to the finest tables in neighboring countries. The Queen of England, and even the Tsars of Russia, imported peaches from Montreuil. Many of the peach varieties now grown around the world were created in Montreuil at this time, including the Prince of Wales, the Grosse Mignonne, and the Téton de Vénus.\nAmong the montreuillois horticulturists most active in variety creation were Alexis Lepère (1799–1883), Arthur Chevreau, Joseph Beausse, Désiré Chevalier and Louis Aubin.\n\n\n=== 19th-century decline ===\n\nPeach orchards reached their apogee in the second half of the 19th century, covering more than a third of the town of Montreuil, 320 ha for more than 300 km of walls and around 600 km of linear planting, and extending well into the towns of Rosny, Romainville, Bagnolet and Fontenay.\nFrom the end of the 19th century, the expansion of the railroads led to a decline in peach production. Fruit from the south of France, which came earlier, was the first to reach the Paris market, at a lower cost. Orchards and walls were gradually destroyed and disappeared into the urban fabric. In 2006, 17 km of severely degraded walls remained, out of the original 600 km. The Murs à pêches (MAP) association is working to save them.\n\n\n=== Site evolution 1950-2010 ===\nIn 1953, an area of 50 ha was classified as a protected horticultural zone, but the 1976 SDRIF transformed the sector into an urban green space reserve. When the SDRIF was revised in 1994, this protective status was transformed into an 80% urban zone, reflecting the State's abandonment of the site, with the consent of the municipality at the time.\nDespite the obvious reluctance of the commune and the Conseil Général, who downgraded the remaining 37 ha to a \"land reserve\" for business activities, 8.5 ha were finally retained and definitively classified by the French Ministry of Ecology on December 16, 2003, as a Site and Landscape.\nThis protected area (only 300 × 300 m) in no way resolves the future of the remaining gardens, now occupied by scrap merchants.\nAccording to the association, an immediate and inexpensive solution would be to rent out these plots to residents, in the form of allotments - there is a very high unmet demand for allotments in Montreuil -, which would enhance and preserve the site and enable the walls to be gradually renovated. In the meantime, the association has acquired a 600 m2 plot that its owner wished to sell, and a public subscription was launched in the summer of 2007 to raise the necessary €24,000. An international youth work camp organized by Union Rempart enabled some twenty meters of wall to be replastered during the summer of 2007. Since then, the same association has restored the outer wall, known as the \"costière\".\n\n\n=== Site evolution since 2010 ===\nIn 2015, a project to sell plots of land to the Bouygues group, the result of an appeal entitled Inventons la métropole du Grand Paris (Let's Invent the Greater Paris Metropolis), sparked controversy and provoked a major mobilization. An opinion piece, with 800 signatories in 2018, denounced the \"attacks of the concreters\" and opposed the transfer of the two hectares concerned by the project from natural zone jurisdiction to that of an urbanizable zone. Representatives of the MAP (Murs-À-Pêches) federation call on the municipality to \"withdraw the Grand Paris project denaturing the Murs à Pêches site and to set up a public interest grouping to properly administer this site of national interest\". The mayor's office retorts, citing \"an essential project to provide the necessary funds for reconstruction\".\n\n\n=== Since 2020: progress in heritage development ===\nAt the end of 2019, three murs à pêches gardens were awarded the \"Remarkable Garden\" label by the French Ministry of Culture. In 2020, the Murs à pêches are awarded the \"Heritage of Regional Interest\" label by the Île-de-France Regional Council.\nIn the same year, the Fondation du Patrimoine granted the site financial aid of 300,000 euros, the largest regional contribution to Stéphane Bern's Heritage Lotto, plus a 50,000 euro cultural sponsorship cheque signed by Française des Jeux and the opening of a popular subscription to raise a further 70,000 euros. For Mayor Patrice Bessac, \"this support is recognition of the municipality's determination to move away from the status quo, to halt the continuing deterioration of the site and its walls, and to give impetus to a coherent vision devised collectively, while respecting the natural vocation of the site\".\nIn July 2021, the Montreuil town council voted to increase investment in the preservation of the site. Between 2021 and 2025, almost 1.5 million euros will be devoted to restoring over ten thousand meters of wall.\n\n\n== Peach walls in art ==\nIn the middle school of the Voltaire school group (Robespierre metro station), one of the ceramic panels by painter Maurice Boitel (1919–2007), who was commissioned to decorate the buildings in 1954, depicts peach tree espaliers along the stone and plaster walls of a Montreuil-sous-Bois orchard, which was still being tended at the time.\n\n\n== Local toponymy ==\nThe peaches of Montreuil have remained part of the commune's cultural heritage, allowing for associations of ideas and puns. Cafés in Montreuil include La Pêche and La Grosse Mignonne, and the former municipal newspaper was named Montreuil Dépêche Hebdo.\nThe names of the Signac-Murs à pêches and Bel Air-Grands Pêchers-Renan neighborhoods also bear witness to these cultures.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nFruit picking\nAllotment (gardening)\nChasselas de Thomery\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nAuduc, Arlette; Vialles, Jean-Bernard.

        "content": "Georgia L. Kober (1873 – September 14, 1942) was a pianist and music educator. For over 30 years, she was a piano instructor and president of the Sherwood School of Music in Chicago.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nKober was born in Indiana, the daughter of George Charles Kober and Rhoda Wanamaker Lewis Kober. Her father was a Union Army veteran of the American Civil War. She studied piano with William Hall Sherwood in Chicago, and with Ossip Gabrilowitsch and Josef Lhévinne.\n\n\n== Career ==\nKober was a concert pianist and music teacher based in Chicago. She performed and lectured often in midwestern cities, played in Texas in 1922, and toured in California in 1923. She made two recordings of piano music in 1924, for the Victor label. Several Chicago composers, including Theodora Sturkow-Ryder, dedicated piano compositions to Kober.Kober was piano instructor and president of the Sherwood School of Music for more than 30 years. Her faculty included conductors Daniel Protheroe and Isaac Van Grove, soprano Genevra Johnstone Bishop, and music historian Glenn Dillard Gunn.  She resigned from the presidency of the Sherwood School in 1942, and received an honorary Doctor of Music degree from the school shortly before she died later that year.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nKober died in 1942, in Palo Alto, California, in her late sixties. Her large collection of sheet music was given to the Community Music School in San Francisco after she died, except for a copy of a Mephisto Waltz autographed by Franz Liszt, which went to the San Francisco Public Library.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Commemorative Medal of the March on Rome (Italian: Medaglia commemorativa della Marcia su Roma) was a decoration granted by the Kingdom of Italy to recognize the October 1922 March on Rome. The march pressured the Italian government into appointing Benito Mussolini prime minister of Italy and began Fascist rule and what the National Fascist Party deemed the \"Era Fascista\" (\"Fascist Era\").\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn October 1922, Benito Mussolini decided on a \"March on Rome\" by members of the Italian National Fascist Party (Italian: Partito Nazionale Fascista or PNF) to pressure King Victor Emmanuel III (Italian: Vittorio Emanuele III) into forcing Prime Minister Luigi Facta to resign and appointing Mussolini to replace him. On 25 October 1922, he appointed the \"Quadrumvirs\" — the Italian fascist leaders Michele Bianchi, Emilio De Bono, Cesare Maria De Vecchi, and Italo Balbo — to organize the march while he remained in the PNF's stronghold in Milan. By 27 October 1922, about 30,000 supporters of the PNF had converged on Rome in 19 columns, and they entered the city on 28 October and began the first of three days of PNF marches and demonstrations. Facta drafted an order declaring martial law and a state of siege in Rome, but Victor Emmanuel, fearing bloodshed, refused to sign it. Facta resigned on 29 October, and on 30 October Victor Emmanuel summoned Mussolini to Rome. On 31 October 1922, the king appointed Mussolini as the next prime minister, an event which began Fascist rule in Italy and which Italian fascists regarded as the beginning of the \"Era Fascista\" (\"Fascist Era\").\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Commemorative Medal of the March on Rome was created on 31 December 1923 by an order of the Voluntary Militia for National Security (Italian: Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale or MVSN), commonly called the \"Blackshirts.\" With royal decrees of 31 January 1926, 1 November 1928, and 15 July 1938 the Kingdom of Italy greatly expanded eligibility for the medal.\n\n\n== Eligibility ==\nThe medal was issued in three grades, gold, silver, and bronze. The 31 December 1923 MVSN order authorized the medal by grade as follows:\n\nThe gold medal for Benito Mussolini, the Quadrumvirs, and the administrative secretary of the National Fascist Party, Giovanni Marinelli.\nThe silver medal for the 19 commanders of the columns organized to converge on Rome in the march.\nThe bronze medal for all other members of the National Fascist Party who participated in the march between 27 October and 1 November 1922.By order of the National Fascist Party on 7 December 1931, the silver medal awarded to Achille Starace, a column leader during the march, was changed to a gold medal on the occasion of his appointment as secretary of the party.After the initial creation of the medal in 1923, the Kingdom of Italy expanded eligibility for it as follows:\n\nThe royal decree of 31 January  1926 extended eligibility to all members of the Voluntary Militia for National Security (Italian: Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale, or MVSN), commonly called the \"Blackshirts.\"\nThe royal decree of 1 November 1928 extended eligibility to personnel who were members of the Italian armed forces on 28 October 1922 but did not engage in opposition to the march that day.\nThe royal decree of 15 July 1938 made all members of the Italian Armed Forces eligible.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\n\n=== Medal ===\nThe medal is a gold, silver, or bronze disc with a diameter of 34 millimetres (1.3 in) and an hook attachment. The obverse depicts a winged victory holding an oak crown in his right hand and supporting a fasces in his left hand. Behind him are legionary insignia, fasces, and Roman daggers. The reverse is centered around a blank quadrilateral delimited by four fasces, within which a recipient could have his name engraved. The identity of the manufacturer of the medal — Lorioli & Castelli of Milan, Italy — is incused below the quadrilateral with the phrase \"M Lorioli & Castelli Milano et EB Mod. Rip. Ris\". The reverse is inscribed along its edge with the phrase \"MARCIA SV ROMA\" (\"MARCH ON ROME\") around the upper half and the phrase \"27 OTTOBRE–1 NOVEMBRE 1922\" (\"27 OCTOBER–1 NOVEMBER 1922\") around the lower half, with two small stars, one each on the left and right edges, separating the phrases.\n\n\n=== Ribbon ===\nThe ribbon is divided equally into two vertical bands representing the colors of the comune (\"commune\" or \"municipality\") of Rome, with yellow on the left and amaranth on the right.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nMorittu, Giuseppe (1982).

It was supported by eight independent MLAs and two MLAs belonging to the Nationalist Congress Party, following which Mukul Sangma was re-elected as the leader of the legislature party and hence the chief minister.\nSangma was sworn in as the chief minister for the second consecutive time on 5 March 2013 by Governor Ranjit Shekhar Mooshahary at the Raj Bhavan complex. On 12 March 2018, eleven ministers were inducted to the council of ministers including two deputy chief ministers and nine other of cabinet rank. Three female ministers and Mukul Sangma's younger brother, Zenith Sangma were also inducted.\n\n\n== Composition ==\nThe council of ministers consisted of chief minister Mukul Sangma and the other ministers. On 12 March 2013, the cabinet was expanded to induct the ministers. Two deputy chief ministers, Rowell Lyngdoh and Roytre C. Laloo were appointed. The cabinet ministers included H. D. R. Lyngdoh, Prestone Tynsong, Deborah Marak, Alexander Laloo Hek, Roshan Warjri, Zenith Sangma, Ampareen Lyngdoh, Clement Marak, and Sniawbhalang Dhar.

        "content": "The 182nd Rifle Division was formed as an infantry division of the Red Army following the Soviet occupation of the Baltic states, based on the shtat (table of organization and equipment) of September 13, 1939 and utilizing the personnel of two divisions of the Estonian People's Army. At the outbreak of war with Germany it was still in Estonia, part of the 22nd Rifle Corps of Northwestern Front's (former Baltic Special Military District) 27th Army. It quickly lost strength, both due to combat losses and to the desertion of large numbers of ethnic Estonians from the ranks. The remainder concentrated near Porkhov by the beginning of July. During that month the 182nd, now under command of 11th Army, took part in the counterstroke at Soltsy against LVI Motorized Corps, and a further action near Staraya Russa in August, both of which slowed the advance of Army Group North toward Leningrad. During 1942 and 1943, under 11th, 27th, and 34th Armies, the division would repeatedly attempt to regain Staraya Russa, while the battles for Demyansk went on to its east through most of this period. The evacuation of the Demyansk salient in February 1943 freed up German forces to reinforce a much shorter line, which stymied Marshal G. K. Zhukov's Operation Polar Star. The front began to move again during the Leningrad-Novgorod Offensive in January/February 1944; Staraya Russa finally fell after holding out for over 30 months and near the end of February the 182nd, now under command of 1st Shock Army in 2nd Baltic Front, won an honorific for its part in the liberation of Dno. At the start of the summer offensive into the Baltic states it was in 22nd Army, still in 2nd Baltic (although very briefly in 3rd Baltic Front). It was under these commands at it advanced through Latvia and into northern Lithuania before being transferred to 43rd Army of 1st Baltic Front in late September. It was almost immediately involved in this Army's rapid advance on Memel, which was reached on October 10. It was impossible to take this heavily fortified city with the means at hand, so the 182nd went over to the defense on the border of East Prussia. When the winter offensive began the division was soon involved in the fighting for Tilsit, and two of its rifle regiments would receive decorations. Following this it pushed through to the Kurisches Haff, and began isolating the German forces in Königsberg. It played little part in the eventual capture of this city, but in April, as part of 2nd Guards Army, it was involved in the clearing of the Samland Peninsula. In the last days of the war the 182nd returned to 43rd Army, now in 2nd Belorussian Front. It would be disbanded in July.\n\n\n== Formation ==\nThe division was formed between August 29 and September 13, 1940, based on the 3rd and 4th Estonian Infantry Divisions of the Estonian People's Army (former Estonian Defence Forces). The personnel continued to wear Estonian uniforms, now with Soviet insignia, and the division was largely equipped with British imports. It was soon assigned to the 22nd Rifle Corps, which also contained the 180th Rifle Division, also of Estonians. Its order of battle on June 22, 1941, was as follows:\n\n140th Rifle Regiment\n171st Rifle Regiment\n232nd Rifle Regiment\n625th Artillery Regiment\n626th Howitzer Artillery Regiment (until October 1, 1941)\n14th Antitank Battalion (until October 1, 1941, then from September 20, 1942)\n138th Antiaircraft Battalion (until October 1, 1941); 23rd Antiaircraft Battalion (October 10, 1941 - February 5, 1942); 23rd Antiaircraft Battery (February 5, 1942 - June 28, 1942); 322nd Antiaircraft Battery (June 28, 1942 - March 25, 1943)\n108th Reconnaissance Company (later 108th Reconnaissance Battalion)\n201st Sapper Battalion (later 493rd)\n9th Signal Battalion (later 897th Signal Company)\n1st Medical/Sanitation Battalion\n181st Chemical Defense (Anti-gas) Company\n382nd Motor Transport Company\n354th Field Bakery\n147th Divisional Veterinary Hospital\n1452nd Field Postal Station\n690th Field Office of the State Bank\nMaj. Gen. Jaan Kruus, who had previously led the 2nd Estonian Infantry Division, was appointed to command, having been transferred to the Red Army in August. On June 3, 1941, he was dismissed from his post, being replaced by Col. Ivan Ignatevich Kuryshev. Kruus was arrested on July 17, and on April 22, 1942, he was condemned to death for \"participation in a counter-revolutionary conspiratorial organization.\" The sentence was carried out by a firing squad on May 15 in Moscow. He would be posthumously rehabilitated on July 5, 1963. Kuryshev had previously led the 10th Airborne Brigade.\n\n\n== Defense of Leningrad ==\nAs the 22nd Corps moved to its concentration area near Porkhov it was removed from 27th Army and came under direct command of the Front. By July 10 it had been subordinated to 11th Army of the same Front.\n\n\n=== Counterstroke at Soltsy ===\nAt this time the LVI Motorized Corps of 4th Panzer Group, supported by infantry of the I Army Corps, was advancing along the Luga axis through Soltsy toward Novgorod. The 8th Panzer Division, in the vanguard, penetrated 30-40km along the Shimsk road and reached the town of Soltsy late on July 13. Here it was halted by spirited resistance from the 177th Rifle Division and the 10th Mechanized Corps, skilfully exploiting the difficult terrain. By nightfall the panzers found themselves isolated from the 3rd Motorized Division to its left and the 3rd SS Totenkopf Division lagging in the rear.\n\nAlert for opportunities to strike back, the STAVKA ordered a counterstroke against the overexposed German force. This was communicated to Marshal K. Ye. Voroshilov, who in turn directed 11th Army to attack along the Soltsy-Dno axis with two shock groups. The northern group consisted of the 10th Mechanized's 21st Tank Division and the two divisions of 16th Rifle Corps, with reinforcements. The southern group consisted of the 183rd, 182nd, and 180th Rifle Divisions, gathered together under 22nd Corps, and was to attack 8th Panzer from the east, with Kuryshev's men moving against the panzer's communication lines to the southwest. The assault, launched in oppressive 32 degree C summer heat and massive clouds of dust, caught 8th Panzer and 3rd Motorized totally by surprise. The two divisions were soon isolated from one another and 8th Panzer was forced to fight a costly battle in encirclement for four days. It also disrupted the German offensive plans by forcing 4th Panzer Group to divert 3rd SS from the Kingisepp and Luga axes to rescue the beleaguered panzer division. In his memoirs the commander of LVI Corps, Gen. E. von Manstein, wrote:Our corps' position at that moment was hardly an enviable one, and we could not help wondering whether we had taken rather too great a risk this time... As matters stood, the only course open to us was to pull 8 Panzer Division back through [S]oltsy to escape the encirclement that now threatened... The next days proved critical, with the enemy straining every nerve to keep up his encirclement and throwing in, besides his rifle divisions, two armoured divisions enjoying strong artillery and air support. 8 Panzer Division nevertheless managed to break through [S]oltsy to the west and re-group, despite having to be temporarily supplied from the air.The Soltsy counterstroke cost 8th Panzer 70 of its 150 tanks destroyed or damaged and represented the first, albeit temporary, success achieved by Soviet forces on the path to Leningrad. It also cost the German command a precious week to regroup and resume the advance. However, the cost to the Soviet forces was high. On July 17, Kuryshev left his command to return to the airborne forces, where he remained for the rest of the war, eventually being promoted to the rank of major general. Col. Mikhail Semyonovich Nazarov took over the 182nd.\n\n\n=== Counterstroke at Staraya Russa ===\nThe STAVKA, as well as Marshal Voroshilov, now the commander of the Northwest Direction, were well aware that Army Group North would soon renew its advance. The STAVKA allocated reinforcements, and dictated a plan to Voroshilov, which stated in part:2. Employ the 34th, 48th, and 11th Armies to conduct this operation...4. Conduct your main attack with the 34th Army and a simultaneous attack by the 11th Army's left flank in the direction of Vzgliady and the 48th Army along the Utorgosh and Peski axis... The offensive by all armies will begin on the morning of 12 August.The plan for the offensive, worked out by Lt. Gen. N. F. Vatutin, was overambitious. Northwestern Front's 48th, 34th, 27th, and 11th Armies were to launch simultaneous and concentric attacks on the X Army Corps of German 16th Army, which was defending at Staraya Russa. 11th Army, led by Lt. Gen. V. I. Morozov, along with 27th and 34th Armies were to strike westward south of Lake Ilmen. The overall objective was to cut off and destroy X Corps and subsequently recapture Soltsy, Dno, and Kholm.\nWhile the attack was carefully prepared, the outcome was uneven, mostly due to the fact that the German formations themselves attacked toward Novgorod and eastward from Staraya Russa on August 10. This set 11th and 48th Armies back on the wrong foot, but the Front's offensive went ahead anyway on August 12, with mixed results. X Corps was indeed enveloped by 34th Army, but the frontal attack by 11th Army soon faltered. Manstein had the 3rd Motorized and Totenkopf restored to his command and on August 19 these launched a counterattack which restored communications to X Corps and by August 25 had driven the two Armies back to the line of the Lovat River. 11th Army lost roughly 30 percent of its personnel and perhaps 80 percent of its weapons. However, the venture had delayed the German advance on Leningrad by another 10 days. On August 23 Northwestern Front had come under command of Lt. Gen. P. A. Kurochkin.\n\n\n== Demyansk Pocket ==\n16th Army, which had a low priority for supplies and manpower, may have been well-advised to remain on the line of the Lovat, but a series of pinprick attacks from the Valdai Hills enticed it to continue its advance eastward. 34th Army was so weak that it could do little to contest the advance of II Army Corps and LVI Motorized toward Demyansk, although 11th and 27th Armies continued to hold positions on the flanks. In early September von Manstein's Corps took Demyansk, but it was now in the ludicrous position of being at the end of a single supply line consisting of a 90km dirt road from the railhead at Staraya Russa. The panzers were soon withdrawn to reinforce the upcoming advance on Moscow, and in early October the X and II Corps again tried to push east from Staraya Russa and Demyansk, but all they gained was more trackless wilderness that was difficult to defend. These efforts were finally halted as the first snow fell, and 16th Army ordered its troops to dig defenses for the winter. Over the next two months a stalemate settled over the front from Lake Ilmen to Lake Seliger. Northwestern Front, battered but not broken, was not immediately in a position to take the initiative. The headquarters of 22nd Rifle Corps was disbanded on September 22, but the 182nd had already come under direct command of 11th Army in August.\n\nThe Red Army's winter counteroffensive began in early December, and it soon became clear that 16th Army was in a precarious position. The weakest point was the boundary between Army Groups North and Center near Ostashkov. To the STAVKA it also seemed that the area south of Lake Ilmen could be used for cost-effective attacks to draw German reserves from Leningrad and Moscow. Kurochkin and his staff began planning on December 18 for a counteroffensive to begin on January 6-7, 1942. Morozov's Army had about 35,000 personnel in five rifle divisions (84th, 180th, 182nd, 188th and 254th), with very limited artillery, but was reinforced with about 90 tanks prior to the counteroffensive, including 15 KV-1s and 30 T-34s. As an example of the shortages, the riflemen of the 182nd received about 100 rounds of ammunition and two hand grenades each, only enough for the first day of fighting. Food was also in short supply. On the German side, the two German Corps relied on a series of strongpoints rather than a continuous line, especially around Demyansk. The weakest aspect was that the 123rd and 290th Infantry Divisions on the flanks had been assigned exceptionally long sectors without any tactical reserves.\n11th Army began the northern part of the counteroffensive on January 7, before 3rd and 4th Shock Armies were ready to attack near Lake Seliger. The 290th Infantry had fortified the village of Vzvad near the mouth of the Lovat, as well as a series of observation posts along the river's west bank, anchored on a battalion-sized strongpoint at Tulitovo. This might have been adequate before the winter freeze, but Morozov's forces now had many more movement options, including Lake Ilmen itself. The Army's shock groups were based on the 180th and 188th Divisions. At 2120 hours one of the observation posts reported that Red Army ski troops were across the Lovat. There was no artillery preparation, and the infiltrating troops moved southwest down the valley of the Redya River, which was about 8km in length. By dawn over 4,000 had crossed the Lovat, bypassing the observation posts and heading toward Staraya Russa; by 1000 the garrison of Vzvad had been cut off by elements of the 182nd and 84th Divisions, before they moved on to threaten to envelop Staraya Russa from the north. Meanwhile, the badly depleted 18th Motorized Division, along with the reconnaissance battalion of Totenkopf were assigned to hold the town.\n\n\n=== Battles for Staraya Russa ===\nOvernight on January 10/11 the 188th Division cut the road from Demyansk to Staraya Russa and brought the latter's airstrip under fire. Morozov now had three divisions outside the town, facing a garrison of 6,500 troops holding a 31km-long perimeter, about 30 percent of which were construction or Air Force personnel. It was fairly well equipped with artillery, but was not prepared for an all-round defense. 11th Army began to invest the town on January 12. A shock group from 84th Division, including three ski battalions, circled around it before approaching the undefended northwest corner on the morning of January 13. This surprise move cut the main road to Shimsk and the rail line, and two battalions entered the town itself, but a violent counterattack by artillerymen and rear troops managed to drive them out with heavy losses. Nevertheless, the garrison was almost completely encircled and forced to rely on air supply. Morozov's next move was to bring up substantial artillery of his own, mostly 76mm field guns, and begin a heavy bombardment, including some 2,000-2,500 shells on January 17 alone. On January 25, Colonel Nazarov left the 182nd. Within weeks he was given command of the 163rd Rifle Division, but left this command a few months later, when he suffered a severe leg fracture. He remained in the training establishment for the duration, being promoted to the rank of major general on January 17, 1944. The new commander of the division was Col. Vladislav Vikentevich Korchits. This Polish officer had survived the Great Purge, and had previously led the 245th Rifle Division.\nBy the end of the month the 11th Army still had Staraya Russa in a fairly tight pocket, but the town was never completely enveloped. Morozov requested reinforcements from the STAVKA as he settled into siege operations. In order to show some success he ordered an attack to finish off the garrison at Vzvad, which was very near the end of its rope. On January 20, this force had been given permission to evacuate, and made a march of 17km in -50 degree C temperatures across Lake Ilmen to reach friendly positions near Staraya Russa.\nThe 32km-wide penetration down the Redya valley gave Morozov the opportunity to exploit to the south with the arriving 1st Guards Rifle Corps. This happened in piecemeal fashion with two rifle brigades on February 2, followed by the 7th Guards Rifle Division, all moving toward Davidovo. It was clear to both Morozov and Kurochkin that Staraya Russa was too well defended to take by storm, but there was now an excellent opportunity to surround II Corps at Demyansk. By February 8 the 1st Guards Corps had taken the village of Ramushevo on the Lovat, cutting the only road into Demyansk, forcing the near-encircled German force to rely entirely on airlift for supplies. Meanwhile the remainder of 11th Army, including the 182nd, maintained the near-encirclement of Staraya Russa. On February 12, the 1st Shock Army began arriving south of the town and began advancing westward toward the Polist River in an effort to complete its encirclement and liberation. During February 15-19 the arrival of 5th Jäger Division delayed this advance. On February 25 the encirclement of II Corps was completed.\nDespite this, by mid-March it was apparent that Northwestern Front had run out of steam. 11th and 1st Shock Armies were still constrained by supply lines run mostly over frozen peat bogs all the way to Valdai, the closest railhead, 110km in the rear. In fact, the Front's troops were hardly in better shape for food and ammunition than the German forces they had fully or partially encircled. For Operation Brückenschlag, the attempt to break the encirclement of II Corps, which began on March 21, the X Corps provided 90 captured Vickers machine guns to the partly-equipped  Corps Group Seydlitz, which had almost certainly been taken from 180th and 182nd Divisions. 11th Army transferred three divisions to the Lovat in an effort to prevent Seydlitz from breaking through, but this did not include the 182nd. Ground communications were finally restored on April 21, although II Corps would continue to require air supply over the following 11 months. From the start of Kurochkin's counteroffensive to the end of Brückenschlag his Front had taken 245,000 casualties, including 88,908 dead or missing, while the two German Corps had lost 63,000, of which 17,000 were dead or missing.\nBy the end of May the front lines of Northwestern Front finally settled, for the most part, along the Lovat River. During the remainder of 1942, four further efforts were made to retake Staraya Russia: May 3-20; July 17-24; August 10-21; and September 15-16. All of these involved the 182nd, and none of them achieved any real success, apart from tying down German 16th Army and preventing any transfer of reserves to aid 18th Army at Leningrad. During May the division returned to 27th Army, still in Northwestern Front. Colonel Korchits was promoted to the rank of major general on August 4, but on August 29 he left the division and was replaced by Col. Vasilii Mitrofanovich Shatilov. Korchits would be transferred to the Polish Army of the East in May 1944 and would end the war as chief of staff of that Army, with the rank of lieutenant general. Shatilov had been the chief of staff of the 200th Rifle Division. By the end of the year the 182nd had been reduced to a strength of just 2,000 personnel, and it was withdrawn to Parfino for rebuilding early in the new year.\n\n\n=== Operation Polar Star ===\n\nWhile the division was rebuilding it was under command of 34th Army, but when it came back to the front on February 11, 1943, it returned to 27th Army. In the wake of Operation Iskra, which broke the German land blockade of Leningrad in January, Marshal G. K. Zhukov conceived a plan to encircle and destroy Army Group North: Operation Polar Star. The first phase of the overall operation would be yet another attempt to cut off and eliminate the Demyansk salient. Zhukov finalized his plan during the week preceding the intended attack date of February 15, and the 11th and 27th Armies together had nine rifle divisions, including the 182nd, plus 150 tanks, massed between Penno and Ramushevo against 5th Jäger Division. However, in light of the encirclement and upcoming surrender of 6th Army at Stalingrad, on January 31 Hitler had authorized the evacuation of II Corps. Operation Ziethen began on February 17 before the delayed Soviet attack could get fully underway, and effectively short-circuited Zhukov's entire plan; 27th Army would still be redeploying as late as the 21st. Demyansk was abandoned on February 21 and by February 26 most of the corridor was evacuated as well.\nDuring this fighting, on February 23, Sen. Lt. Pyotr Ivanovich Shlyuykov distinguished himself sufficiently to be made a Hero of the Soviet Union. Serving as the deputy commander of the 171st Rifle Regiment's mortar company, he was the first man to enter a German trench, and led his men to take a strongpoint. While holding off counterattacks all his comrades were put out of action, but despite being injured himself he was able to repel the attacks until reinforcements arrived. On March 31 he would receive his Gold Star. His injuries forced him to leave the Red Army in 1944, after which he lived in Velikiye Luki. After the war he served in several Communist Party offices after graduating from a Party school in 1950. He died and was buried at Velikiye Luki on January 22, 1957, at the age of 34.\n\n\n==== Further battles for Staraya Russa ====\nZhukov was determined that his plan was fundamentally sound, and so recommended to the STAVKA a modified version to be carried out in March. Northwestern Front was to begin its attack on March 4, with 27th and 1st Shock Armies directed to take Staraya Russa and reach the Polist. If successful, a group of four Armies, including 1st Tank Army, were to exploit toward Pskov and Narva. This effort proved as fruitless as those previous; the attack was delayed by 24 hours and made almost no progress at all. On March 7 the STAVKA ordered 1st Tank Army to the south in response to the German successes in the Third Battle of Kharkov, and the planned exploitation was abandoned. A week later, 27th Army again struck the defenses east of Staraya Russa, but this failed miserably with heavy losses. The STAVKA finally ordered the offensive shut down on March 17 and Zhukov was sent to the south to deal with the situation there. He was soon followed by some of Northwestern Front's best units, as the evacuation of Demyansk freed up Red Army forces as well as German. The 182nd remained on the defensive for the remainder of the year, returning to 34th Army on April 3 as 27th Army began moving south as well. On November 15 it was reassigned to 1st Shock Army, which was part of 2nd Baltic Front.\n\n\n== Leningrad–Novgorod Offensive ==\nIn the planning for the January 1944 offensive against Army Group North the priority was on Leningrad and Volkhov Front's effort to drive 18th Army away from Leningrad and finally end the bombardment of the city. The initial task for 2nd Baltic was to pin down the forces of 16th Army, although two of its Armies were currently in pursuit of German forces north of Nevel, and 1st Shock, with a strength of 54,900 personnel, was intended to play an offensive role.\nThe main offensive began on January 14. On January 19 elements of 22nd Army captured a section of the railroad between Novosokolniki and Dno, cutting an important line of communications to Staraya Russa. On February 1 the STAVKA gave orders to transfer 1st Shock to Volkhov Front in order to strengthen that Front's drive toward Luga. The Front commander, Army Gen. K. A. Meretskov, chose to attempt to penetrate the German defenses south of Staraya Russa with 1st Shock while the main forces of the Front carried out an encirclement near Luga. The Army was to envelop and destroy the left-flank forces of 16th Army on cooperation with Soviet 8th Army. Initially, 1st Shock made little progress to its objective of cutting the road from Kholm to Staraya Russa, gaining only 4km from the 21st Luftwaffe Field Division. The Army was thinly spread, with just four rifle divisions and one brigade on a 100km-wide sector. The 182nd had by now been organized on a reduced shtat: each rifle company had its personnel cut from 160 to 103 with just two platoons. Each platoon, however, had six LMGs, so retained nearly the same firepower as previously.\n21st Luftwaffe was reinforced on February 2 by elements of 30th Infantry Division, two batteries of assault guns the following day, and on February 8-9 by the 15th SS Division (1st Latvian). Meretzkov ordered 1st Shock to continue its offensive on February 5 but this gained just 4km by February 15 before stumbling to a halt from exhaustion. On February 14 the Army had returned to 2nd Baltic Front when Volkhov Front was disbanded, and within days the 182nd had become part of the 14th Guards Rifle Corps.\n\n\n=== Battle for Dno ===\nDespite the crawling pace of 1st Shock's advance, the position of 16th Army at Staraya Russa was clearly untenable and on February 17 Field Marshal W. Model, the new commander of Army Group North, ordered it be evacuated by its German garrison the next day. The town was finally liberated by elements of 1st Shock after two-and-a-half years of struggle. 1st Shock began a pursuit of X Corps which gained 25-45km by late on February 20, hooking up with Leningrad Front's 54th Army. The German withdrawal continued over the next few days, making temporary halts on previously prepared defensive positions. One of these was a north-south rail line from Dno to Nasvy. Dno was a vital point in the German defense, and Model concentrated 8th Jäger Division, a regiment of 21st Luftwaffe, and two security regiments within the city, with 30th Infantry to its south. The first converging attack by 14th Guards Corps and 111th Rifle Corps of 54th Army on February 23 was defeated by counterattacks, but the following day the 182nd, with the 137th Rifle Brigade and 37th Tank Regiment, plus two divisions of 111th Corps, assaulted the city and took it. In recognition, the division was awarded a battle honor:DNO... 182nd Rifle Division (Colonel Shatilov, Vasilii Mitrofanovich)... The troops who participated in the liberation of Dno, by the order of the Supreme High Command of 24 February, 1944, and a commendation in Moscow, are given a salute of 12 artillery salvoes from 124 guns.The Front exploited its successes on February 26. The 14th Guards Corps and the 208th Rifle Division of 54th Army forced the Shelon River northwest of Dedovichi, crushed German resistance on the river's west bank and advanced up to 12km, capturing the Logovino–Novyi Krivets sector of the road from Porkhov to Chikhachevo; the defending 30th Infantry and 21st Luftwaffe divisions were forced to pull back quickly to the west and Porkhov was liberated the same day. As the pursuit continued 1st Shock advanced up to 22km on February 27 and the key town of Pustoshka was taken. The STAVKA ordered 2nd Baltic to continue its advance without regrouping but the German VIII and XXXXIII Army Corps joined up and intensified their resistance opposite the 1st Shock and 22nd Armies and successfully withdrew their forces across the Velikaya River. Although 1st Shock advanced 40km by the end of the day on February 29 and cut the Pskov-Opochka rail line, in the first days of March it was forced to go over to the defense.\n\n\n=== Against the Panther Line ===\nThe 182nd had now run into the defenses of the Panther Line. On March 3, the STAVKA representatives to 1st and 2nd Baltic Fronts put forward a plan to destroy the German forces between Ostrov and Idritsa, which included the following:... 1st Shock Army will attack along the Pskov-Idritsa railroad toward Pushkinskiye Gory and Opochka with three rifle divisions and one rifle brigade.Leave one rifle division and one rifle brigade to protect the Leningrad Front's left flank.This plan was approved early the following morning, but with changes to apply pressure across a broader front. Specifically, 1st Shock was to \"continue to attack along its present axis toward Shanino and Krasnogorodskoe while cooperating with the Leningrad Front's left wing.\"\nA total of six armies under Leningrad and 2nd Baltic Fronts grappled, with few breaks, from early March until April 18 to break through the deep defenses manned by 16th and 18th Armies, but the few gains were at the cost of heavy casualties. There were many regroupings among the attacking forces, such as the 182nd's move to 90th Rifle Corps from April 7-20 before being reassigned to 12th Guards Rifle Corps, all while remaining in 1st Shock Army. Meanwhile, Colonel Shatilov had left the division on April 6. He would soon take command of the 150th Rifle Division, was promoted to the rank of major general on November 2, and became a Hero of the Soviet Union on May 29, 1945, after leading his division into the heart of Berlin. He would reach the rank of colonel general in 1963, before his retirement the following year. Col. Alfred Yurievich Kalnin took over command of the 182nd, but he, in turn, would be replaced on June 6 by Col. Mikhail Vladimirovich Fyodorov, who had previously led the 137th Rifle Brigade. This officer, apart from a few days in April 1945, would lead the division into the postwar.\n\n\n== Baltic Offensive ==\nAs of the beginning of July the 182nd was under direct command of 1st Shock, but shortly after that Army was moved to 3rd Baltic Front the division returned to 90th Corps, which was now part of 22nd Army, still in 2nd Baltic Front. At the start of the summer offensive into the Baltic states in early July the 182nd was facing the Panther Line due south of Pskov. Once that city was liberated on July 23 the Line was broken and 22nd Army began to exploit to the west. By the beginning of August the division was near the town of Preiļi in Latvia. From August 11-20 it came under command of 3rd Shock Army, but returned to 90th Corps in 22nd Army by the start of September. As the advance continued, by the second week of the month it reached as far as Viesīte. Later in the month it was reassigned, with 90th Corps, to 43rd Army in 1st Baltic Front. By early October this Army was moving southwest and the 182nd was in the vicinity of Radviliškis in Lithuania.\n\n\n=== Advance on Memel ===\n43rd Army was under command of Lt. Gen. A. P. Beloborodov. The addition of 90th Corps brought it up to a strength of 12 rifle divisions in four corps. It late September it had been advancing on Riga where German forces were concentrating in an attempt to hold the city. Soviet intelligence had discovered that there were only four divisions available to defend on the axis from Šiauliai to Memel, and Beloborodov was ordered to make this 100-120km march in order to attack the latter place in mid-October. The advance was to begin on October 5, with six divisions in the first echelon. The objective, beyond Memel itself, was to reach the Baltic coast and take the city of Tilsit, which would sever communications from East Prussia to the German forces still holding out in Latvia and Lithuania.\n90th Corps' task was to hold the Army's left flank, a 35km-wide sector. The attack, following a reconnaissance-in-force and a relatively brief artillery preparation, achieved immediate success, with some German troops fleeing in panic. By the end of the day the Army's shock group had advanced 14-15km. The next day a further 25km was gained, and on October 7, as it joined the advance, the 90th Corps covered 10km while the 1st and 19th Rifle Corps in the center pushed ahead up to 40km. In the first six days of attack and pursuit a total of 130km had been covered. The Minija River was crossed by troops of the Front, including 43rd Army, on October 9. This river line was heavily fortified with trenches, pillboxes, and minefields, and the depleted German forces, backed by the garrison of Memel, were finally able to put up notable resistance. Altogether there were 18 infantry battalions of various strengths, plus about 40 tanks and assault guns, under command of the headquarters of XXXX Panzer Corps. Memel itself was guarded by nine forts completed the previous March, each armed with a 310mm naval gun, plus the usual machine guns and lighter artillery. On October 10, Beloborodov's Army advanced another 8-18km while fighting off more than 10 counterattacks and closed up to the outer perimeter of the Memel fortifications, but it was impossible to take these from off the march. The following day, despite heavy fire from the forts, the 90th and 92nd Rifle Corps managed to advance on the flanks, while the 19th Corps attempted to reach the Baltic coast north and south of the city. At 1400 hours the 32nd Rifle Division cut the Memel–Tilsit road and was on the shoreline beyond.\nWhile the offensive had been a significant success, finally isolating the elements of 16th and 18th Armies in the Courland Peninsula as well as the Memel garrison, it was soon clear that the latter place, with its forts, could not be taken until significant heavy artillery was brought up. On October 13 the 1st Baltic Front went over to the defense. 90th Corps was deployed along the Neman River, which formed the northern border of East Prussia.\n\n\n== East Prussian Offensive ==\nThe STAVKA issued orders on December 6 to Army Gen. I. K. Bagramyan, commander of 1st Baltic Front, that he was to concentrate 4-5 rifle divisions on the left flank of 43rd Army by December 28 in order to assist 3rd Belorussian Front in defeating the German group of forces in and around Tilsit and then to roll up the defense along the Neman at the outset of the upcoming offensive into East Prussia. 90th Corps was to provide the larger part of this force. In the first days the Corps forced a crossing of the Neman and then advanced along the south bank, breaking into Tilsit during the latter half of January 19 and capturing it after a short battle. On February 19 the 140th and 171st Rifle Regiments would both be awarded the Order of the Red Banner for their roles in the taking of Tilsit as well as several nearby towns in East Prussia. Immediately after this the 43rd Army as a whole was transferred to 3rd Belorussian Front.\nThis Front now began a pursuit of the defeated German IX Army Corps with its right wing Armies; the German remnants were attempting to retreat behind the Alle and Deime Rivers. By the end of January 22 the 43rd Army had made a fighting advance of 23km and the 90th Corps' main force had reached the eastern shore of the Kurisches Haff as far as the Nemonin River while other elements of the Army had reached from the Nemonin to Agilla and to Kelladen. The German forces were hurriedly fortifying the approaches to Labiau and were trying to organize a defense along the east bank of the Deime, which was the last line of defense before Königsberg.\nCombat operations continued overnight on January 22/23. At dawn the 43rd Army attacked Labiau following a short artillery preparation. The defenders, employing heavy machine gun and mortar fire, initially stopped the 103rd Rifle Corps' units at the river, but eventually its 115th Rifle Division and 54th Corps' 263rd Rifle Division forced a crossing and outflanked the town from north and south, while the 319th Rifle Division broke in from the east. Labiau, with most of its garrison, was in Soviet hands by the end of the day and the Army was directed to continue its advance to the west. By the end of January 26 it had reached a line from Postnikken to Zelweten. From here it developed its attack along the seacoast, pursuing the remnants of two German infantry divisions and reaching the line Stombeck–Norgenen. With Königsberg cut off the Front now focused on eliminating the German forces southwest of the city in the Preußisch Eylau–Landsberg–Bartenstein area, but this did not directly involve the 43rd Army, which was transferred to 1st Baltic Front on February 9. On February 19 the 182nd was transferred to 13th Guards Rifle Corps, still in 43rd Army. On February 21, the STAVKA redesignated this Front as the Zemland Group of Forces, effective February 24.\n\n\n=== Samland Offensive ===\nBy the beginning of April, just prior to the final assault on Königsberg, the 182nd had been transferred to 103rd Corps, which was now part of 2nd Guards Army, also in the Zemland Group. As the Group's right wing army the 2nd Guards was not directly involved in this attack, but instead was directed to clear the remaining German positions in the Samland Peninsula, particularly the port of Pillau. This objective was heavily bombed on April 8, but the 2nd Guards made little progress until it was joined on April 13 by additional forces freed up after the fall of Königsberg. It was assigned an attack sector 20km wide on the north flank, and was to attack in the direction of Gross Hubniken, with a supporting attack toward Germau. On the first day the Army broke the defense in two places, advanced 2.5km, and took 1,017 prisoners. The next day the remaining German forces began to retreat to the west and 2nd Guards gained another 15km, while capturing another 2,500 men and a large amount of equipment. On April 15 the Army reached the Baltic, having cleared the northwestern sector of the peninsula. What remained of the German forces pulled into the heavily-fortified Pillau area, which was not taken until April 25. During this fighting, Colonel Fyodorov handed his command to Col. Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Shchennikov on April 17, but returned on April 23.\n\n\n== Postwar ==\nThe 182nd ended the war in 103rd Corps of 43rd Army, which was now in 2nd Belorussian Front. On May 28 the 232nd Rifle Regiment was awarded the Order of Kutuzov, 3rd Degree, and the 14th Antitank Battalion was given the Order of Alexander Nevsky, both for their roles in the battle for Pillau. The next day the STAVKA issued Order No. 11097. Under part 8, the 182nd is listed as one of the rifle divisions to be \"disbanded in place\". The division was disbanded in July.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nAffairs Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of the Soviet Union (1967b).

Sama also co-wrote the film with Sai Praneeth Gouravaraju. It stars Kaushik Ghantasala as main lead while the other cast include Keegan Guy, Megan Barlow, Satya Yamini, Elester Latham and Candido Carter. This film was screened at Santa Monica International Film Festival and 19th Chennai International Film Festival. The film revolves around the lives of an immigrant, a billionaire, an elder man and a gang of amateur thieves.\n\n\n== Plot ==\n\n\n== Release ==\n\n\n=== Theatrical ===\nHow is that for a Monday? was screened at Regal LA LIVE theater in Los Angeles, United States, on 16 October 2023, as part of 13th Awareness Film Festival. It was distributed by PVR Cinemas and was released in India on 27 October 2023.\n\n\n=== Home media ===\nThe digital rights of How is that for a Monday? were acquired by ETV Win and the film became available for streaming from 7 December 2023.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nRam Venkat Srikar of Film Companion wrote \"HITFAM is a testament that a simple, good-hearted story, when presented with a clean screenplay and control over craft, can make for a compelling watch and move you. One doesn't always need lavish resources at their disposal and heavy-weight drama to keep the viewer invested\" in his review.Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of The Hindu wrote \"The aftereffects of this film might make you read up on Jesse Owens. Like Shyam, we may also learn to acknowledge the bigger picture as we get caught up in day-to-day hustles. Perhaps, we will also learn not to snap at customer care executives who reiterate, even if annoyingly, that they apologize for any inconvenience caused.\" and praised the performance of main lead Kaushik Ghantsala.Abhilasha Cherukuri of Cinema Express rated the film 3.5 out of 5 and wrote \"How’s that for a Monday? has two halves. One comes with a set of short film-style satisfactions, where the co-incidences line up in a way that makes the viewer cognizant of writing done well. The other meanders around with philosophical outtakes before an elegant touchdown that places the joy of an active conscience over the contentments of material comfort.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHow Is That For A Monday? at IMDb",

There are six or seven whorls, the body whorl more than half the length of the shell. They are regularly rounded and grooved by, on the body whorl, 20-30 strong, rather deep, coarsely punctate grooves between rounded interspaces. The lines of growth are quite perceptible. The suture is somewhat appressed, not channelled. The aperture is more than half as long as the shell. The outer lip is thin. The inner lip is hardly callous. The columella is straight, without any chink behind it, and bears a single moderate fold. The protoconch is small, mostly immersed in the succeeding whorl. The apex is not acute. The surface is usually not polished.    This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\n\nThis marine species occurs in the Caribbean Sea off Mexico, Cuba, Barbados and Saint Lucia; in the Gulf of Mexico off the mouth of the Mississippi River.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nRosenberg, G.; Moretzsohn, F.; García, E.

It is endemic to Vietnam, where it has been observed in Hon Ba Nature Reserve and Bidoup Nui Ba National Park, about 1500 meters above sea level.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe adult female frog measures 28.7–36.6 mm in snout-vent length. The authors of the original description did not find any adult males. The skin of the dorsum is green in color without any of the brown or gray marks found on congeners. There is yellow coloration on the sides, legs, and feet, and the belly is lemon yellow in color.  This frog has no vomerine teeth.\n\n\n== Nomenclature ==\nThe frog's Latin name, viridescens, refers to its immaculate green color.\n\n\n== Habitat and threats ==\nThis frog is found in evergreen forests close to the peaks of hills and mountains. Scientists have not observed eggs or tadpoles, but they presume it lays eggs in hollow trees containing water or in small pools.\nScientists classify this frog as endangered because of its small range, which is still subject to degradation from deforestation associated with agriculture. The government of Vietnam has taken some measures to preserve this animal.\n\n\n== References ==",

Greenman (talk) 07:23, 25 March 2024 (UTC)\n\nThe Bestune Pony (Chinese: 奔腾Pony) is a battery electric city car produced by the FAW Group under the brand name Bestune.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nIn response to the great popularity of the Wuling Hongguang Mini EV electric microcar, FAW Group has prepared a response to this model under its Bestune brand. In April 2023, during the Shanghai Auto Show, the premiere of the pre-production Pony model family took place, which announced the serial model ready for sale by being covered with various stickers, decorations and additional panels. It officially debuted in September of the same year, distinguished by a styling that extensively reproduces the aesthetics of the competitive Wuling.\nThe characteristic, boxy proportions were enriched by a two-tone exterior painting with large headlights and rear lamps, as well as additional oval-shaped strips on the bumpers and doors along with relatively small wheels. The car is also equipped with an extensive accessories package, such as a roof rack. The passenger cabin has a cool, minimalist design with a dashboard limited to a minimum of indicators and a two-spoke steering wheel.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

The area is part of the modern day town Al Kanisah.\nThe site contains Hagar el-Merwa, an Ancient Egyptian rock art site with inscriptions (boundary stelae) from the reign of Thutmose I and Thutmose III. This site marks the southern border on the Nile of Ancient Egypt during their reigns. The inscription on the rock reads:\n\nAs for any Nubian who shall transgress (or violate) this stela, which my father Amun has given to me, his chieftains shall be slain, he shall endure in my grasp, the sky shall not rain for him, his cattle shall not calve, there shall be no heir of his on earth.\nKurgus means \"yellow\" in modern Nubian, and the name likely refers to the yellow sandstone of the region.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTombos Stela\nSudan Archaeological Research Society\n\n\n== References ==",

The shell is composed of about six whorls and has a distinct umbilical perforation. The small protoconch is eroded. The spire shows about six, or (on the body whorl) eighteen strong and very regularly and distinctly punctate grooves, the punctations at the rate (near the aperture) of about six to a millimeter, the grooves a little more crowded anteriorly and distant posteriorly, the interspaces\neverywhere wider than the grooves and with no intercalary grooves or striae whatever. The transverse sculpture consists of faint lines of growth. The aperture is rounded in front and pointed behind. The outer lip is thin, simple, arched, and continuous with the reflected thin columellar lip, upon which a fold can hardly be made out. The body of the shell shows a slight glaze. The umbilical perforation is straight, with smooth walls, apparently very deep, and about 0.25 mm. in diameter.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\n\nThis marine species occurs in the Caribbean Sea off Florida, Mexico, Cuba and Saint Lucia.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nRosenberg, G.; Moretzsohn, F.; García, E.

        "content": "Březolupy Speedway is the motorcycle speedway club known as Autoklub Březolupy and the track known as the Plochá dráha Březolupy, which hosts the club. The track is located in the centre of Březolupy in the Czech Republic, off the Březolupy 497. The track surrounds a football pitch.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nDuring the 1950s a group of motor enthusiasts built a motocross circuit approximately three kilometres south of the village of Březolup but because only one meeting per year was held they wanted something more regular. The residents chose the center of the village for a speedway track and constructed it during the early 1960s before opening on 16 July 1961.\nRudolf Havelka set the first track record and the venue hosted numerous rounds of the Czech Republic Individual Speedway Championship. The 9 and 10 May 1964 is considered the birth of a team at the track and in 1970, the stadium added workshops and a clubhouse. The team competed in the Czechoslovak Team Speedway Championship and regularly competed as AMK Březolupy until the Dissolution of Czechoslovakia. \nAfter the dissolution, the team participated in the Czech Republic Team Speedway Championship, enjoying their best period of success, gaining various sponsors such as Barum, Mitas and Z-Group and securing one silver medal in 1996 and three bronze medals in 1995, 1997 and 1999 respectively.\nIn 2016, the team merged for the season with the team PK Plzeň from Plzeň. \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Abans PLC also known as Abans Group is a Sri Lankan public limited company and a diversified conglomerate in Sri Lanka engaged in ICT, retail, manufacturing, logistics, commercial real estate and financial services. Abans predominantly functions mainly as a consumer retailer selling various electronic appliances, smart phones, laptops, cooking utensils. Aban Pestonjee is the founder of the Abans Group of companies and serves as the chairperson of the company.\n\n\n== Corporate history ==\nAban Pestonjee launched her business under the name Abans in 1968 at her home garage, where she managed to restore the used appliances she acquired from auctions and home sales to better working condition and sell them at her corner shop at Bambalapitiya, Galle Road. She came up with the idea to launch her own company at a time when Sri Lanka entered into the prospect of a closed economy in the 1960s, which also resulted in the subsequent ban on imports. Aban also took note of how difficult it was to complete household chores through manual labour due to restrictions imposed by Sri Lankan government on importing raw materials and cashed in on the potential by selling secondhand home appliances sourced through embassy auctions.\nAbans has facilitated the provision of electrical appliances and electronic items, including air conditioners, televisions, laptops to various beneficiaries, such as local Sri Lankan ministries and departments, by entering into high-value contracts. Abans is officially recognised as the licensed vendor by the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka in terms of telecommunications related services including buying of smart mobile phones. Abans currently serves as the authorised Sri Lankan national distributor for the Motorola and Oppo brands while also serves as authorised reseller of Apple iPhones in Sri Lanka.On 21 June 2023, Rusi Pestonjee was appointed as the managing director of Abans with immediate effect following the death of precedent managing director Tito Pestonjee. In October 2023, Abans launched Quick Service at Wellawatte for repairs of appliances such as microwave ovens, irons, blenders, kettles, and water heaters.Abans was appointed as the franchisee by the American fast food restaurant McDonald's in the Sri Lankan context of operating businesses, and the developmental agreement was reached on 21 August 1997, including set franchise terms and conditions. Rusi Pestonjee was also present when Abans reached such a franchise agreement with McDonald's. McDonald's made its entry into the Sri Lankan market in 1998, and since then, Abans has served as McDonald's franchise partner until March 2024. Abans has also established a long-term partnership with South Korean electronics company LG for over three decades and has also established over 17 years of strategic alliance with Apple.\n\n\n== Controversy ==\nIn March 2024, McDonald's removed Abans as their Sri Lankan local partner as part of its global franchise network owing to the poor quality supply of food items and unhygienic food items in McDonald's outlets all over Sri Lanka. Abans was criticised for failing to meet international hygiene standards when operating the McDonald's outlets in Sri Lanka. Around 12 McDonald's outlets in Sri Lanka were closed with immediate effect and McDonald's sign boards were covered up.On 24 March 2024, Colombo Commercial High Court issued an enjoining order preventing Abans from using McDonald's name in their business marketing and promotional purposes. The Colombo Commercial High Court issued the court order following a lawsuit filed by McDonald's Corporation preventing Rusi Pestonjee, managing director of Abans PLC from any way or manner to use the name McDonald's or any name in any way or manner similar to the name McDonald's.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Acteon melampoides is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Acteonidae.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe length of the shell attains 6 mm, its diameter 4 mm.\n(Original description) The short, stout shell is white. It has a depressed spire and shouldered body whorl. It contains five whorls. They are sculptured with punctate spiral lines. The protoconch is small and eroded. The other whorls show two, three, or (on the body whorl) twenty to twenty-five\nspiral lines, which are distinctly punctate, with about ten punctations in the length of a millimeter. The spirals are crowded just in advance of the suture and near the columella, and especially distant on the shoulder of the body whorl. The suture is distinct, with the anterior margin finely crenulate in the body  whorl. The other sculpture consists of fine lines of growth and microscopic revolving striae. The outer lip is hardly oblique, joining the body at a wider angle than usual, owing to the shouldering of the body whorl. It is thin, simple, passing imperceptibly into the short, twisted columella, which bears a single distinct fold. The body whorl shows only a glaze, columella hardly or not at all thickened. The aperture is approximately lunate.   This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\n\nThis marine species occurs in the Western Atlantic Ocean off Virginia, USA; in the Caribbean Sea off Saint Lucia.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nRosenberg, G.; Moretzsohn, F.; García, E.

The magazine is known for its founder and editor Cemal Süreya who was a poet and its well-known contributors.\n\n\n== History and profile ==\nPapirüs was established by Cemal Süreya, and its first issue appeared in August 1960. Immediately after its start the magazine temporarily closed down due to financial problems. It could be restarted in 1961 and managed to publish only three issues in that year. The magazine was republished in June 1966 and came out monthly until June 1970. In this period Tomris Uyar and Ülkü Tamer along with Cemal Süreya were instrumental in the reestablishment of the magazine.\nPapirüs was restarted in 1980 as a triannual publication, but permanently ceased publication in March 1981. The magazine produced a total of fifty-three issues during its run. \nPapirüs mostly featured poems, book and journal reviews and contained a section for biographies. It published thematic special issues.\n\n\n== Contributors ==\nMajor contributors of Papirüs included Sezai Karakoç, İsmet Özel, Ataol Behramoğlu, Behçet Necatigil, Haldun Taner, Leyla Erbil, Ahmed Arif, Ece Ayhan, Fazıl Hüsnü Dağlarca, Enis Batur, Nâzım Hikmet, Refik Durbaş, Salah Birsel and Yaşar Kemal.

        "content": "Acteon incisus is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Acteonidae.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe length of the shell attains 9 mm,its diameter 5.75 mm.\n(Original description) The short, thin shell is inflated. It is waxen white and polished. It contains five or six whorls and a rather acute spire. The protoconch is minute, more or less immersedand eroded to some extent in every specimen. The apical whorls are smooth, polished and rounded. The \nsuture is very distinct, in the majority of cases not channelled. The apical whorls show two or three distant narrow grooves across which, in some cases, pass elevated growth lines which appear nowhere else, or, if at all, only in the suture near the apex. The body whorl forms the largest part of the shell. It is  inflated and provided with ten or eleven spiral grooves, which, are nearer together anteriorly. These grooves are somewhat zigzag by exigencies of growth, but are not punctate, as in so many species. The other spiral sculpture consists of microscopically fine slightly zigzag striae, about seventy in the width of a millimeter. The transverse sculpture consists only of most delicate flexuous lines of growth most evident near the sutures. The aperture is rounded in front and pointed behind. The outer lip is thin, simpleand arcuated toward the periphery, passing imperceptibly into the columella. The body of the shell has a slight callus joining the rather slender columella which carries one inconspicuous fold.

        "content": "Miquel Vidal Vidal (born 1960) is a Spanish People's Party politician. He was mayor of his hometown of Santanyí on Mallorca from 1999 to 2013. He was a deputy in the Parliament of the Balearic Islands from 2015 to 2023, and the interim president of the People's Party of the Balearic Islands from 2015 to 2017.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBorn in Santanyí, Mallorca, Vidal graduated with a degree in biology and a diploma in teaching. He was elected mayor of his hometown in 1999 and remained in office until his resignation in 2013, when he passed the role on to his deputy, Llorenç Galmés.\nShortly before his resignation, Vidal voiced that the PP-led Government of the Balearic Islands should print school textbooks in the standard form of the Catalan language and not in Balearic dialects of the language. He cited the archipelago's statute of autonomy that states that its official languages are Spanish and Catalan.\nVidal was director general for the environment in the Government of the Balearic Islands from 1991 to 1995, and the PP spokesperson in the Island Council of Mallorca from 2011 to 2015. He was elected to the Parliament of the Balearic Islands in the 2015 regional election, for the Mallorca constituency.\nIn July 2015, Vidal was named interim president of the People's Party of the Balearic Islands as José Ramón Bauzá resigned his role after losing the regional government. The following year, he was involved in controversy when the newspaper El Mundo revealed that he earned €28,000 annually for this party position in addition to €60,000 per year as a deputy in the regional parliament. He relinquished his party salary as a way to protect its image, but also said that the salary was necessary for his travel expenses (which he estimated at 584 km per day) and that the salary was less than a cleaner or waiter would earn. In March 2017, Biel Company was elected as the permanent president of the party.\nFor the 2023 Balearic regional election, new PP leader Marga Prohens did not name Vidal on the list of candidates, nor Company.\n\n\n== References ==",

The stadium is located in the northern outskirts of Liberec in the Czech Republic, off the Letná 618.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Pavlovický Stadion was built in 1930.The team have had a sporadic existence, first competing in the Czechoslovak Team Speedway Championship as Liaz Liberec in 1970. Liaz (LIberecké Automobilové Závody) was a manufacturer of trucks. Over the next two decades a team from Liberec would not compete every year but AMK Liberec won the 1.Liga in 1990 before the Dissolution of Czechoslovakia.Then participating in the Czech Republic Team Speedway Championship, teams known as GRS Liberec, SK Kaltina Liberec and GRSBM Liberec (all due to various sponsorships) represented Liberec.The most important event that was run at the stadium was the semi-final of the Under-21 World Championship in 2019.Also in 2021, the team now known as Aforti Start Gniezno Liberec (due to a collaboration between the club and the Polish team Start Gniezno) won the silver medal in the Czech Republic Team Championship.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Acteon danaida, common name Rehder's baby bubble, is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Acteonidae.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe length of the shell varies between 5 mm and 10 mm.\n(Original description) The elongated, white shell is moderately pointed and is polished. It has about six \nwhorls. The spiral sculpture consists of (on the spire) six, or (on the body whorl) over twenty-five punctate grooves, more crowded anteriorly, but with two or three coarser than the rest, just in advance of the suture. Between these original grooves in the latter half of the body whorl intercalary single or double grooves appear, which are seldom quite as deep as the originals, and at first are not punctate, but at last, and especially near the anterior extreme of the shell, \nbecome nearly as well marked as the original series. The transverse sculpture consists only of lines of growth, by a peculiar thickening of certain of which when they cross the grooves the punctate appearance is produced. The minute protoconch is eroded. The suture is appressed and distinct, but the thin appressed anterior margin seems peculiarly liable to erosion, which, in some cases takes place so as to produce the appearance of a channelled suture. The whorls are slightly rounded. The outer lip is thin, simple, somewhat produced in the middle, passing imperceptibly into the thin twisted columella, which is slightly reflected, and bears one inconspicuous, very oblique fold. The body of the shell has a thin layer of callus. The aperture is rounded in front, rather narrowand pointed behind. There is no umbilical chink in this  species.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\n\nThis marine species occurs in the Western Atlantic Ocean off North Carolina; in the Caribbean Sea off Cuba.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nRosenberg, G.; Moretzsohn, F.; García, E.

        "content": "Anak ni Baby Ama is a 1991 Philippine action film written and directed by Deo Fajardo Jr. The film stars Robin Padilla in the title role.A sequel Hari ng Selda: Anak ni Baby Ama 2 was released in 2002.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nAnghel is a troubled, carefree young man who grew up under the care of Ramon, a crime lord well-respected in their territory.  He crosses paths with Annie, a young woman who comes from a well-to-do family.  With their first meeting a disaster due to the constant bullying of Annie's brother Neil and his gang, Annie makes it up to Anghel by bringing him to their family resthouse and teaches him the basics of self-defense.  Soon after they fell in love much to the consternation of Annie's parents and Neil.  \nWhen Annie turned 18 Anghel was invited but was treated badly at the party. In retaliation, he ruins the party and was sent to jail.  While in jail, it was discovered he got Annie pregnant but lost the baby due to the decision of Annie's family that she gets a forced abortion.  Soon after he was released from prison with help from Cora, he and Neil's group come into blows again at Ramon's territory but was saved with the help of Junior Bahala.  As punishment Neil and his gang were subject to humiliation by going naked in the streets but Neil was spared upon request by Anghel, being Annie's brother.  \nAnother problem soon compounded Anghel when a drug lord named Johnny Roa infiltrated Ramon's territory.  Johnny was able to sell drugs at that territory and won the loyalty of some of Ramon's men.  Soon after, Anghel's mother shows up and reveals to Anghel that he is the son of the celebrated criminal Baby Ama.  Ramon was able to confess to Anghel how he and Baby Ama became close in prison but their conversation was cut short when they were informed that Johnny's men were coming to their place for a war.  Anghel shaves his head bald as his response to the revelation that forever changed him but lost his foster father Ramon in that war.  It was revealed that it was Ramon's close associate Boy Dugas who betrayed the group and as retaliation, Anghel kills him mercilessly.\nAnnie on the other hand, was fooled by Mark, one of Neil's gang inviting her to a supposed meet-up with her and Neil's common friends.  She was later on drugged, gang-raped and killed.  Neil later on found out what happened to her sister and sought Anghel's help for revenge.  Devastated by Annie's death and the ordeal she went thru, Anghel made peace with Neil and teamed up in eliminating Annie's killers/rapists one by one.  Anghel later found out that Neil's former gang members bought drugs from Johnny Roa, the same guy that masterminded in killing his foster father Ramon.  After all of Annie's rapists were killed, Anghel proceeds to Johnny's hideout to eliminate the syndicate by himself.  \nAnghel attended Annie's funeral upon the invitation of Annie's surviving family members, including Niel.  At the funeral, the policemen presented a warrant of arrest to Anghel to which he surrendered.  As he leaves the cemetery, he saw Cora who hugs him one last time before entering the prison much to the delight of other prisoners chanting his real father Baby Ama's name.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRobin Padilla as Anghel\nEddie Rodriguez as Ramon\nAmy Perez as Anne\nIlonah Jean as Cora\nAlan Paule as Mark\nBembol Roco as Junior Bahala\nGina Pareño as Anghel's Mother\nGino Antonio as Neil\nRosemarie Gil as Mrs. Lardizabal\nRomeo Rivera as Mr. Lardizabal\nSubas Herrero as Johnny Roa\nRomy Diaz as Larry\nDick Israel as Boy Dugas\nEva Darren as Aida\nVal Iglesias as Victor\nJordan Castillo as Julio\nManjo Del Mundo as Cora's Lover\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was supposed to be part of the 1990 Metro Manila Film Festival, but was not chosen as part of the six entries.

        "content": "Tota of Ribagorza (? - d. 1019), was the suo jure Countess Regnant of Ribagorza between 1003 and 1010 and possibly in 1017–1019. She was also Countess of Pallars by marriage to Count Sunyer I of Pallars.\nTota was born to Count Raymond II of Ribagorza and Garsenda de Fezensac, and the sister of Unifredo de Ribagorza (r. 970 - 979), Arnaldo of Ribagorza (r. 979 - 990) and Isarno of Ribagorza (r. 990 - 1003).\nHer three brothers succeeded her father one after another. Her first two brothers had no heirs, and were therefore succeeded by their younger brother. Her youngest brother Isarno did leave a son when he died in 1003, William Isarn, but he was illegitimate and lived in Castile, and therefore, Tota of Ribagorza succeeded her brother as ruling countess.\nWhen she succeeded the County of Ribagorza was under threat of the forces of Abd al-Malik al-Muzaffar, and Tota allied with the County of Pallars by a marriage alliance with Count Sunyer I of Pallars. The marriage was childless. As was the custom at the time, her spouse was made co-regent and Count of Ribagorza jure uxoris.\nThe increasing dominance of the County of Pallars in the County of Ribagorza made Tota contact Sancho García of Castile, son of her sister Ava of Ribagorza, Countess of Castile, and asked for his help against her husband. \nSancho García of Castile sent military forces under leadership of Tota's illegitimate nephew William Isarn to intervene. This operation ended in 1010 with the abdication of Tota in favor of her nephew William Isarn, who particioned the county with his cousin Mayor García of Castile, daughter of Ava of Ribagorza, who also had claim to Ribagorza.\nTota's own position after her abdication in 1010 is not clear. After the death of William Isarn in 1017, she is again noted in official documents as ruling countess of Ribagorza. She attended a ceremony in the church Santos Juan i Pablo de Tella in 1019.\n\n\n== References ==",

The team race at the Mšeno Speedway Stadium.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe origins of speedway in Mšeno began with the construction of the Mšeno Stadium in 1956, which included a speedway track around the outside of the football pitch and it was first used in 1957. In 1986, there was a failed attempt to bring a Mšeno–Býkev team to the stadium.\nIt was not until 1993 that a private investor, Jiří Opočenský (a former national cyclocross athlete) created a new speedway team called Oliba Mšeno, named after his local bicycle manufacturing company Oliba. The team raced in the second division known as 1.Liga and won it in 1994.\nIn 1997, the team folded and then the company Oliba collapsed but in 1999, speedway returned with new ownership and a new team known as SK Mšeno. The club under the control of Rudolf Grepl, finished seccond in the Czech Republic Team Speedway Championship before winning three consecutive national titles from 2009 until 2011. Greg Hancock was instrumental in helping the team claim such success.\nIn recent years finances have been an issue but the team continue to compete as PDK Mšeno.\n\n\n== References ==",

The play, a verse drama, helped launch Duncan's career.\nGeorge Patten, Aboriginal leader, appeared in a Melbourne production of the play.\n\n\n== Reviews ==\nThe Sydney Morning herald said Duncan \"obviously feels a savage resentment against the stupidities and the horrors of war; and she is not afraid to ex- press that sentiment in verse that flames. It was in neglect of the poetic element that Saturday's presentation fell short of what It easily might have been.\"\nThe Sun News said \"ts characters are puppets rather than people and the -thick brush with which the villains are drawn and the heavy underlining of the moral are sometimes uncomfortably reminisceht of the old-fashioned temperance' text.\"\nThe Age called it \"remarkable\".\nThe Argus called it \"a work of great promise\".\n\n\n== Awards and honours ==\nIt won first prize in the New Theatre League's new play competition.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Sword Sung at Ausstage\nThe Sword Sung at AustLit",

        "content": "Nathalie Licard (born April 17, 1964, in Dax, Landes) is a French presenter. Her trademark is her pronounced French accent. Licard became known from May 7, 1997, above all through the Harald Schmidt Show.\n\n\n== Life ==\nAfter graduating from high school, Licard studied literature in France and trained in social management. She then founded a recording studio and moved to Cologne. According to Licard herself, she started working as an intern at the Harald Schmidt Show in 1997 and did not speak a word of German at the time. She acquired her knowledge of German herself in the course of the show.\nFrom August 9 to September 10, 2004, Licard appeared on the Franco-German channel Arte. She spoke with guests on weekdays at 20:15 o'clock about programs that Arte showed in the evening. In addition to the irregular but frequent appearances in the Harald Schmidt Show, she had a permanent role in Harald Schmidt. On November 22, 2006, she hosted about half of the show instead of Harald Schmidt. She was also the \"singer\" of the ARD show band in Harald Schmidt, although she only had two vocal interludes there. In July 2007, Licard was the face of the theme month Vive la France! on Das Vierte. From March 6, 2012, she again spoke the opening credits and the commercial break announcements in the Harald Schmidt Show, which was reinstated in the program. Her French pronunciation of the wheat beer brand Schöfferhofer, for which she was also heard in commercials, became well-known.\nIn 2004, Licard spoke the voice of the secret weapon in the animated film Derrick - Die Pflicht ruft. She was often part of the guessing team in the program Dings from the Roof. Since 2020, she has been part of the extended guessing team on the program Sag die Wahrheit. In 2008, Licard published the book Ich bin gespannt wie gekochtes Gemüse. A Frenchwoman in Germany. Licard made several appearances on the Sport1 programme Doppelpass for the European Football Championship 2016.\n\n\n== External links ==\nLiterature by and about Nathalie Licard in the German National Library catalogue\nOfficial Website of Nathalie Licard\nInterview in Zeit from June 28.

        "content": "Hanz Cua is a Filipino fortune teller who specializes in Chinese astrology.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nHanz Cua was born to ethnic Chinese parents in the Philippines. His grandparents were emigrants from China and his parents were only fluent in speaking Chinese. Hanz is the eldest and only son among three siblings. Cua attended Chinese schools up to the tertiary level.\nHanz would claim to be able to exhibit psychic abilities at a young age. Through his own account he is able to auras and mythical beings such as the duwende, tikbalang, and other spirits. He also learned Feng shui-based astrology from his father, whose own career in the Philippines was limited by language fluency.\nCua would be briefly work as a nurse in less than a year. He graduated with a degree in nursing and is a board exam passer. He decided against pursuing his nursing career in the United States and went on to pursue a career in astrology.\n\n\n== Career ==\nHanz Cua obtained a diploma as Feng Shui Master Practitioner from an undisclosed institution. He claimed to have trained under Feng shui masters in Hong Kong, mainland China, Singapore, Malaysia, Myanmar and Thailand. Hanz Cua is also a practitioner of Bazi, and Ziwei doushu.\nHe was also a resident Chinese astrologer at the ABS-CBN morning show Umagang Kay Ganda.\nCua is noted for his forecast made in December 2019, that 2020 would be a \"good year\" for most of the Chinese zodiac animal signs. The COVID-19 pandemic occurred going against his initial forecast. Cua would point out that most Chinese astrologers in the country predicted an auspicious year and predictions are not without flaws similar to weather forecasts.\n\n\n== References ==",

She met her future husband, the painter Felix Bürgers, in the studio of Ludwig Schmid-Reutte in Karlsruhe. She lived in Dachau from 1901 onwards. Her portraits capture movements and moods in characteristic color tones, attaching importance to similarity and are usually cleverly composed in space. Works by her are exhibited in the Museum August Kestner. Characteristic of her work are numerous portraits, which were strongly influenced stylistically by her teachers. After their marriage in 1904, the couple co-founded the \"Dachau Artists' Group\". Their house, at Herzog-Albrecht-Straße 1 (now 12), became a meeting place for artists in the town. For many years, it housed a residential home for people with disabilities. The villa has been privately owned since 2014.\nAfter the death of her husband, she moved away from Dachau in 1934 and lived in her hometown of Hanover in the district of Waldheim.\n\n\n== Selected works ==\n\nEine Dachauer Bäuerin in Festtracht oil on cardboard 65 × 49 cm\nZwei spielende Kinder mit Vogelkäfig Oil on canvas 69 × 89 cm\nStilleben mit Rosen\nPortrait\nRosen in gläserner Vase\n1905: Portrait of Mayor Törner\n1907: Portrait of the philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Freiherr von Leibnitz\nEmilie Stockmann\n\n\n== Literature ==\nBürgers-Laurenz, Gertrud.

        "content": "Anna Ivanivna Borisoglebskaya (Ukrainian: Га́нна Іва́нівна Борисоглі́бська; 1868–1939) was a Ukrainian actress and People's Artist of the Ukrainian SSR (1936).\n\n\n== Ealy years ==\nAnna Borisoglebskaya was born on 1868, in the city of Sebezh in the Vitebsk Governorate (present-day Pskov). Borisoglebskaya spent her childhood in the city of Izium in the Kharkov Governorate and received her education at the Charity Society School in Kharkov. In 1886, she took an exam to become a teacher at Kharkov University and began teaching in the village of Novoselovka in the Izyumsky Uyezd that same year.\nBorisoglebskaya died on September 29, 1939, in Kyiv. She was buried in Baikove Cemetery in Kyiv, and her grave is maintained by the Ukrainian Theater Actors Union.\n\n\n== Career ==\nFrom her childhood, Borislebskaya showed interest in the theater. She stepped onto the professional stage in 1888 with invitation of Marko Kropyvnytskyi. Borislebskaya worked with Kropivnitskyi's troupe until 1902, then spent four years with Panas Saksahansky and Ivan Karpenko-Karyi's troupe. In 1906–1907, she toured with the Shchepkin and Kolesnichenko troupes. From 1907 to 1917, she worked at the stationary theater led by Nikolay Sadovsky in Kyiv.\nShe created a rich gallery of vivid stage characters in the theater: Rindichka, Teklya, Gapka, Varvara (\"During the Inspection,\" \"Until the Sun Rises, Dew Eats Eyes,\" \"Zaydigolova,\" \"Chmyr\" by Kropyvnytskyi), Sekleta, Vustya (\"Chasing Two Hares,\" \"Oh, Grits, Don't Go...\" by Starytskyi), Hanna (\"Talented\" by Karpenko-Karyi), Mother (in the plays \"Sueta\" by Karpenko-Karyi and \"The Forest Song\" by Lesya Ukrainka), Stekha (\"Nazar Stodolya\" by Shevchenko), Shkandybiha (\"Limerivna\" by Panas Myrnyi), Mazaylikha (\"Mina Mazaylo\" by Mykola Kulish).\nIn 1919, Borisoglebskaya became one of the founders of the First State Ukrainian Drama Theater named after T. G. Shevchenko (now in the city of Dnipro — Taras Shevchenko Dnipro Academic Ukrainian Music and Drama Theatre). From 1920 to 1925, she was in Western Ukraine, where she performed with various theater troupes, especially with Orel-Stepnyak.\nFrom 1925 until the end of her life, she worked at the Ivan Franko Theater in Kyiv. Here she created characters in plays such as: Oryna (\"97\" by Kulish), Klara (\"Fear\" by Afanasyev), Marfa, Varvara (\"Truth,\" \"Bohdan Khmelnytsky\" by Korniychuk).\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Cantonal and University Library (German: Kantons- und Universitätsbibliothek (KUB), French: Bibliothèque cantonale et universitaire (BCU), also known as the Bibliothèque cantonale et universitaire de Fribourg (BCUF)) is a cantonal and university library that located in the Canton of Fribourg, Switzerland. BCU founded in 1848, comprises a central library and decentralized libraries, notably at the University of Fribourg. All libraries are managed according to the same library principles and guidelines. BCU is part of the Directorate of Education, Culture and Sport (EKSD) of the Canton of Fribourg and is affiliated to the Office of Culture.\nIts mission is to contribute to the development of the intellectual and cultural life of the canton, both for the university community and for the general public. It is part of the Western Switzerland Library Network (RERO) and works closely with the other libraries in the canton. It has been a member of the Swiss Library Service Platform (SLSP) network since 2020.\n\n\n== Legal basis ==\nAccording to the cantonal law on the cultural institutions of the state, the BCU has the task of:\n\nto acquire, record, preserve and make accessible to the public the information media required for general education and scientific research;\nto compile a Fribourg documentation accessible to the public and to keep an associated bibliography;\nto ensure the obligatory distribution of printed materials and recordings and to preserve the collections;\nto contribute to the development of the general public library system in the canton.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe public cantonal library was founded in 1848. The collections came from the libraries of the Jesuit College of St. Michael (Collège Saint-Michel) and the various abolished orders and monasteries such as the Cistercians of Altenryf. They were housed in the former library of the College of St. Michael, a room measuring 8 × 12 meters. The first director, Abbé Meinrad Meyer, published the first volume of the printed catalog in 1852.\nDue to a lack of space, plans for a new library building were made several times in the following decades. The founding of the University of Fribourg and the emergence of seminary libraries exacerbated the lack of space. Following a feasibility study and the purchase of the land by the canton in 1905, the building was constructed on the Winkler property next to the Kollegium and behind the Konvikt Albertinum. The Bernese architects Wilhelm Bracher and Friedrich Widmer planned an entrance building with two side wings and a six-storey stacks building in the neo-baroque style. The architect in charge of construction was Léon Hertling.\nIn 1909, the library officially became the \"Cantonal and University Library\" (Bibliothèque cantonale et universitaire, BCU) and on June 11, 1910, the inauguration of the new library building on Rue Joseph-Piller took place. Pope Pius X donated a facsimile of the Codex Barberianus by Giuliano da Sangallo to the BCU.\n\nIn 1941, the Miséricorde university building complex was inaugurated, in which several seminary libraries were set up. The BCU building became too small due to the growth of the university. It was extended between 1970 and 1975 according to plans by the Basel architect Otto Senn with a contemporary ensemble. The façade of the east wing was retained, the west wing became a catalog hall with an adjoining media library and a new study hall was built behind the stacks building. The stacks in the basement were enlarged and the lending system was automated with a conveyor belt. The extension was inaugurated on May 13, 1976.\nIn 1977, 20 seminary libraries became the Interfaculty Library for History and Theology (BHT). In 1984, the computerization of the BCU's services began and it joined the network of libraries in French-speaking Switzerland and Ticino (RERO). In 1989, the Fribourg Media Center was integrated into the BCU. The first volume of the ongoing Fribourg Bibliography was published in 1990 and the BCU website was launched in 1995. \n\nIn 2002, part of the holdings of the BCU headquarters were moved to the new Beauregard branch. According to a concept approved by the Grand Council in 2001, the head office at 4 and 6 Rue St-Michel was also to be expanded with a new building for the open access area and user workstations, and the existing premises were to be renovated.\nOn December 9, 2020, the BCU moved from the RERO library network in French-speaking Switzerland and Ticino to the Swiss Library Service Platform (SLSP) network. This harmonizes the user accounts, search portals, loan periods and fees of 470 academic libraries in Switzerland for registered users.\n\n\n== Collection ==\n\nThe BCU houses and makes available approximately 3.8 million documents and 720,000 electronic documents, including:\n\n536,705 e-books (across multiple platforms)\n20,620 electronic journals\n207 databases\n2300 manuscripts (including 185 before 1500)\n620 incunabula\n138 nachlass\n\n\n== List of directors ==\nThe following personalities succeeded one another at the head of the institution:\n\n1848-1870: Meinrad Meyer\n1870-1897: Jean Gremaud\n1897-1905: Charles Holder\n1905-1916: Max de Diesbach\n1916-1925: François Ducrest\n1925-1942: Gaston Castella\n1942-1958: François Esseiva\n1958-1973: René de Wuilleret\n1973-1984: Georges Delabays\n1984-2002: Martin Nicoulin\n2002-2020: Martin Good\n2020-: Angélique Boschung\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nAlain Bosson, dans Urs B.

        "content": "Rosanna Rocci (born October 28 1968 in Solothurn) is an Italian pop singer.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nRosanna Rocci first grew up in Switzerland. At the age of four, she moved with her family to Italy in Abruzzo. She spent the rest of her childhood there with two sisters. She learned to play the organetto at an early age, which was actually reserved for men in Italy.\nAt an event in Germany, Rocci played for the composer Hanne Haller and the lyricist Bernd Meinunger, who brought her to Germany. This is how she came to Kempten. Initially she was used to produce hits in English and Italian language. At the beginning of the 1990s, Rocci went on tour with Tony Christie and Umberto Tozzi and became internationally known. She was a guest on numerous hit parades and television shows. From 1992, she also made German recordings.\nIn addition to solo performances and solo recordings, Rocci has also been performing as a duo with her husband, fellow pop singer Michael Morgan, since 1999. Their first hit was Ich gehör zu Dir, with which they won the \"Golden Muse\" at the Deutsche Schlager-Festspiele 1999.\nRosanna Rocci is under contract with the music label zoom music. In April 2019, she released her new album 5.0 to mark her 50th birthday.\nRocci was married to Michael Morgan from 1997 and has a son with him. At the end of June 2012, she announced their official separation. In June 2020, Rocci made her divorce public.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n1992: Rosanna\n1994: Kopfüber ins Leben\n1996: My Fire is Burning\n1998: Amore, Amore\n1999: Emozioni\n2001: I Live for You (with Michael Morgan)\n2001: Heart Over Head in Love\n2001: Rosanna\n2001: Un Poco di Amore\n2002: Dolce Vita\n2002: Kopfüber ins Leben\n2003: Aber bitte mit Herz\n2003: Ti Amo Ancora\n2004: Felicita - Liebe hautnah (with Michael Morgan)\n2005: Das fühlt sich gut an\n2007: Die grössten Single-Hits\n2007: 100% Rosanna\n2009: Solo con te - Nur mit Dir\n2012: Glücksgefühle\n2019: 5.0\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nLa mia Musica\n1990: Mister, Mister\n1991: Theresa\n1991: My family\n1992: Chaka Chaka\n1993: Wer die Augen geschlossen (wird nie die Wahrheit seh'n) (as part of Mut zur Menschlichkeit)\n1994: Vino e Pane\n1995: Perche no - warum nicht\n1996: Mamma Mia\n1996: Ciao mio amore (with Andreas Fulterer)\n1997: Ritornerai\n1999: Ich gehör zu Dir (with Michael Morgan)\n2001: Un Poco di Amore\n2002: Un Anno d'Amore\n2005: Arrivederci Hans\n2007: E Pericoloso\n2007: Ich bin aus dem Süden\n2011: Du bist kein Americano\n2012: Olé Olá - heisser als Fieber\n2019: Tutto o niente (Gefährliches Spiel)\n2019: Solo Amore (Tropical Mix)\n2019: Solo Con Te\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Holly Lester is an electronic dance music disc jockey from County Armagh, Northern Ireland, who performs techno live sets.  Lester is co-founder of the Free The Night advocacy organisation aimed at boosting the night-time economy in Northern Ireland.  \n\n\n== Career ==\nLester first started to beat-match at age 14, while growing up in Hamiltonsbawn, County Armagh.  She first came to prominence working as a disc jockey in dance venues in the north-west of England, has been a regular \"homegrown\" performer at the AVA Festival in Belfast, and was in the top 50 of the Guardians pick of the best new music for 2019. Lester has gone on to achieve wider recognition, playing sets across Europe, and in Australia and Indonesia.\nIn 2019 Amy Fielding of DJ Magazine called Lester \"one of Northern Irelands' most exciting selectors\".  She was also nominated for a DJ Mag award in 2021 in the Underground Hero category. Lester has been featured on BBC Radio a number of times, including performing mixes in both 2021 and 2022.  Her sound has been described by Resident Advisor as \"raw analogue jams\" that \"rub shoulders with dreamy trance tinged melodies and swirling breakbeats\".\nLester set up the Duality Trax record label, which has released music for artists including Abdul Raeva and Tifra.  In August 2021 the label released a compilation, \"Visions Vol. 1\", in aid of Doctors Without Borders, which was described by DJ Magazine as a \"globetrotting, genre-hopping affair\". In 2023 Duality released the follow-up compilation, \"Visions Vol. 2\", with all proceeds aiding the Palestine Children's Relief Fund.\n\n\n=== Free The Night ===\nLester, along with Dublin-based Sunil Sharpe, is the founder of Free the Night, a non-profit organisation which started in 2021 with the aim of improving the night-time economy in Northern Ireland, including making it more \"safe, progressive and culturally diverse\" and campaigning for improved public transport.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nwww.onehouse.com/artists/holly-lester",

        "content": "Nikolskaya sopka (Russian: Нико́льская со́пка), is a sopka  (hill) located in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Russia, close to the historic centre of the city. Nikolskaya sopka has a rich history, in particular, it was the site of military operations during the Siege of Petropavlovsk in 1854. A natural-historical park is located on the sopka. Nikolskaya Sopka is a natural monument. The name \"The Sopka of Love\" has stuck to the sopka among the people.\n\n\n== General information ==\n\nNikolskaya sopka is located on the territory that is the historical centre of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. The base of the second Kamchatka expedition was located on the bay shores surrounded by Nikolskaya and Petrovskaya sopkas, which marked the beginning of the city construction.\n\nThe sopka is a favourite recreation place of the townspeople. From the western side, Nikolskaya Sopka is close to Avacha Bay. On this side, there is a narrow strip of rocky beach, bounded by the steep rocky slopes of the sopka. From the central town square on the northern side of the hill, one can walk along this beach to the stairs rising to the isthmus between the hill itself and the Signal cape.\nOn the slopes of the sopka grows a forest of Erman's birch. According to a 1964 study, some of the trees were over 300 years old, meaning they were older than the city itself.\nThe sopka is popular among the population largely due to the large number of monuments erected on its slopes to commemorate the heroic defence of the city in 1854.\n\n\n== Siege of Petropavlovsk during the Crimean War ==\n\nMost of the fighting during the attack of the Anglo-French squadron on Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky took place in the immediate vicinity and on the slopes of Nikolskaya Sopka. The city defenders had constructed artillery batteries in advance. The closest to the sopka were Battery No. 3 under the command of Alexander Maksutov and Battery No. 7 under the command of V. Koralov. The third battery was located on the isthmus between Nikolskaya sopka and Signal cape. The seventh battery was located on the northern slopes of the sopka. In the course of heavy bombardment from enemy ships, both batteries were completely destroyed, and the defenders were forced to retreat.\nAfter the destruction of the batteries, the attackers landed a landing at the foot of Nikolskaya Sopka, the main purpose of which was to take positions on its top. The Anglo-French landing force, totalling more than 700 men, was opposed by only about 300 defenders of the city. As a result of a fierce battle, the enemy forces were completely defeated and the remnants of the landing force fled back to the ships. As a result of the battle, which lasted about two hours, Russian troops captured the banner of the Gibraltar regiment of marines and a large number of trophies.\n\n\n=== Monuments to the defenders of the city ===\n\nIn honour of the defenders of Petropavlovsk, several monuments were built on the slopes of Nikolskaya sopka in different years, currently, there are only 4 monuments. The main one is a chapel built in 1912 on the eastern slope of the hill, on the site of the mass grave of soldiers who died during the defence. On the right side of the chapel are buried 35 defenders of the city, on the left - 38 British and French sailors.\n\nJust off the road to the top of the hillside, a metal staircase leads to the Glory monument. The monument was moved to this location in the 1940s. Previously, it was located on a sandy spit near the hillside, which is now on the territory of the seaport. The monument is a black-coloured monument with a spire topped with a patriarchal cross.\n\nAbout two hundred metres from this monument, in the direction of the isthmus, a monument was built in 1954 to commemorate the centenary of the heroic defence. The monument consists of a quadrangular base lined with light-coloured tiles. On each side there are relief metal images. A cast-iron cannon is placed on the top of the monument.\nAnother monument is installed on the isthmus between Signal cape and Nikolskaya sopka, where the third battery under the command of Alexander Maksutov was located. In its original version, built in 1959, it was a wooden model of a five-gun battery. In 1967 the wooden cannons were replaced by cast-iron ones.\n\n\n== History of the sopka in Soviet times ==\nBefore the revolution, any economic and other activities on the territory of Nikolskaya Sopka were prohibited. In the 1920s Komsomol members began to improve the slopes of the hill: gradually paths for walking began to appear. In 1937 a park of culture and recreation was opened on the hill, it had such buildings as a dance floor, a summer theatre, amusement rides, a shooting gallery, a billiard room and a parachute tower. Later on, restaurants also appeared. Folk festivals were held on the territory of the park, especially on holidays such as Fisherman's Day, Navy Day.\nAt the top of the hill there was a vacant lot, where during the Great Patriotic War training firing was held. In the post-war years, the city's first stadium with a football field was built in its place. In autumn time it hosted the annual regional agricultural exhibition.\nIn the late 1960s the park of culture and recreation on the slopes of Nikolskaya Sopka lost its importance. The main place of recreation for the citizens became the town square, located on the northern side of the hill. At present, none of the buildings of the park of the Soviet period have survived, only fragments of the metal fence enclosing its territory remain on the eastern side.\nIn 1961, a television centre was built on the top of the hill, which operated until 2005.\nIn 1983, Nikolskaya Sopka was given the status of nature monument.\nIn 2018–2019, the park has undergone significant reconstruction and has become perhaps the most popular recreation spot for citizens and guests of the city.\n\n\n== The monument to La Pérouse ==\nThe first monument on the slopes of Nikolskaya Sopka was a wooden monument erected in 1843 to the French navigator La Pérouse who visited Kamchatka in 1787. During the siege of Petropavlovsk, the monument was destroyed by bombardment from ships of the Anglo-French squadron. A new version of the monument to La Pérouse was built on Leninskaya Street in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in 1892.\n\n\n== See also ==\nKamchatka Krai\nPetropavlovsk-Kamchatsky\nSiege of Petropavlovsk\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nБооль, В.

        "content": "Helga Brauer (2 May 1936 – 15 June 1991) was a Schlager singer of the GDR.\n\n\n== Life ==\nBrauer was born on 2 May 1936 in Leipzig. After training as a dental technician, Helga Brauer was helped by chance to begin her singing career in the summer of 1954: During a vacation in Sellin on the island of Rügen, she took part in a singing competition with the orchestra Helmut Opel. She won first prize - and Opel immediately offered the 18-year-old a contract as an accompanist for the orchestra.\nOn 11 November 1954, Helga Brauer gave her first public performance in Leipzig's Messehalle 2, followed by further appearances and guest performances with the Helmut Opel Orchestra, including in Switzerland. In March 1956, she passed a \"microphone audition\" with GDR Radio and shortly afterwards appeared for the first time with the Leipzig Radio Dance Orchestra, then under the direction of Kurt Henkels. The first radio recordings followed in the same year, and the record company Amiga also offered a six-month training contract in the summer of 1956. This was followed in 1957 by an exclusive contract and the recording of the first single.\nOne year later, Helga Brauer scored the first number one hit in the GDR pop rankings with Heute spielt der Konstantin Klavier. In 1959, together with her band \"Die Flamingos\", she was chosen to popularize the fashionable dance Lipsi with Heute tanzen alle jungen Leute, and for Mister Brown aus USA - also a Lipsi - she received Die goldene Note at the dance music festival of the same name in the same year.\nIn 1960, Helga Brauer married the composer, arranger and trumpeter Walter Eichenberg, who took over the direction of the Leipzig Radio Dance Orchestra in 1961 and also wrote numerous successful titles for the singer such as Hör' mein Herz, Das Tagebuch vom schönen Max, Mit dem strahlendsten Lächeln der Welt and Einer ist für den andern da.\nTours abroad in the 1960s took Helga Brauer to the Soviet Union, the Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Austria, Sweden, Finland and Egypt. With Schlaf, mein kleiner Johnny she won the first Schlagerwettbewerb der DDR in 1966. In the 70s and 80s, the singer was not only a guest on the big entertainment shows on GDR television such as Amiga-Cocktail, Ein Kessel Buntes or Da liegt Musike drin, but also on numerous stages. Her repertoire included over 600 titles.\nHelga Brauer died in Leipzig of breast cancer at the age of 55 and was buried in the Südfriedhof in her home town. In 2018, her husband Walter, who died on 13 March, was laid to rest with her.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n1965 - LP Helga sings for you and me (Amiga)\n1986 - LP Helga Brauer - Das musikalische Porträt (Amiga)\n1999 - CD Hör mein Herz.

        "content": "Yibin University, referred to as Yiyuan, is a full-time undergraduate public provincial higher education institution in the China, located in Cuiping District, Yibin City, Sichuan Province. The school is under the supervision of the Sichuan Provincial People's Government, and implements a city-based school-running system jointly established by the Sichuan Provincial People's Government and the Yibin Municipal People's Government.\nThe history of Yibin College can be traced back to the Yibin Normal College founded in 1978. After restructuring and the accumulation of academic resources since the reform and opening up, it merged with the Yibin Branch of Sichuan Institute of Education on May 11, 2001, to form Yibin College, becoming the first institution of Yibin City. The first undergraduate college; and gradually transformed from a school focusing on teacher education into a multi-disciplinary applied comprehensive university, cultivating a large number of talents for the development of various fields in Yibin City. Yibin University has also formed an \"innovative, applied and international\" school-running pattern, recruiting undergraduate and junior college students from 28 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions in mainland China, and also recruiting international students from South Asia and Southeast Asia.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1975, Sichuan Normal College established a pilot class called \"Come and go\" in Maiba Township, Lizhuang District, which was named as the Yibin Branch of Sichuan Normal University. This was the predecessor of Yibin College. In June 1977, the school was restructured into Yibin Regional Communist Labor University. On December 28, 1978, the State Council of the People's Republic of China approved the establishment of Yibin Normal College on the basis of Yibin Regional Communist Labor University. At that time, the campus was located in Baimiao Village, Maiba Township, Nanxi County (now Li Zhuang Town, Cuiping District, Yibin City), and three majors were approved. In 1985, the school relocated to Jiangbei, Qiaoxi Bay, Yibin City (now Anfu Street, Cuiping District). In 1993, the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China approved the renaming of the school to Yibin Normal Higher Vocational College. In May 2001, the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China agreed to integrate the educational resources of Yibin Normal Higher Vocational College and the Yibin Branch of Sichuan Education College to establish Yibin College at the undergraduate level.\nWith the completion and opening of the waterfront campus in the Sanjiang New Area University City, Yibin University has also begun to strive for the granting of master's degree awarding units and discuss upgrading to a university, in order to promote the development of science and technology innovation industries and educational undertakings in Yibin City.\n\n\n== Campus Environment ==\nIn 1985, the People's Government of Sichuan Province agreed to relocate Yibin Normal Higher Vocational College to Qiexi Bay on the north bank of the Min River in Yibin City, and the construction of the campus began. In August 1987, Yibin Normal Higher Vocational College relocated from Lizhuang Town to the Jiangbei Campus in Qiexi Bay (now located at No. 8 Jiusheng Road, Anfu Street, Cuiping District), which is divided into A and B areas. The A area also serves as the location of the college headquarters, while the B area is located at its southern end. The campus is situated in a mountainous terrain, with the elevation gradually increasing from the southern corner to the north. The campus boasts rich vegetation and a pleasant environment, with a modern architectural style. It has been awarded honors such as \"Outstanding Unit in Campus Civilization Construction\", \"Advanced Sanitation Unit\", \"Garden-style Unit\", and \"Top 100 Greening Units in Sichuan Province\". However, there is a lack of open space at key landscape nodes, which has to some extent affected the campus atmosphere. The college campus is served by external transportation routes such as Yibin Public Bus Route 22, providing convenient transportation for faculty and students to travel to various places.\nIn addition to its main campus, Yibin University has also constructed a waterfront campus in the Sanjiang New Area University City. The first phase of construction was completed on December 31, 2019. Departments such as the Tea College, Intelligent Manufacturing College, Big Data and Software College, Quality Inspection College, and Transportation Service Engineering College have been relocated to the waterfront campus. The architectural style of the campus reflects a blend of Eastern and Western cultures. This campus is adjacent to the Yibin Graduate School of Xihua University, Chengdu University of Technology, Chengdu College of Sichuan International Studies University, and Chengdu University of Technology among other higher education institutions in Yibin. It can be accessed via the Yibin Intelligent Rail T1 Line to travel between downtown Yibin and the Chengdu-Guizhou Intercity Bus Line Yibin West Station.\n\n\n== Academic Research ==\n\n\n=== Schools and Departments ===\nWhen the school was founded in 1978, Yibin Normal College had only three majors: Chinese, mathematics and physics. In the future, as the enrollment scale expanded and the needs of actual development, the number of subjects continued to increase. As of 2022, Yibin University has 13 departments and 3 secondary colleges, offering a total of 63 undergraduate majors, including 1 national first-class undergraduate major, 9 provincial first-class undergraduate majors, and 6 provincial applied demonstration majors; The disciplines established have certain local characteristics and application.\n\n\n=== Academic Resources ===\nYibin University Library was established at the beginning of the school's founding, with a collection of over 11.53 million volumes of various books. In addition, the library subscribes to multiple databases such as CNKI, Wanfang Database, and Superstar Academic Video Database. The library also has a collection of liquor culture and has created a local literature exhibition room. The library has also been open to the public in Yibin City and has hosted special lectures and academic research activities. In 2022, the Sichuan Provincial Local Chronicles Institute established a branch at the university to collect and preserve local documents of Yibin and display local information. The \"Journal of Yibin University\" is a comprehensive academic journal sponsored by Yibin University. Its predecessor was the \"Journal of Yibin Teachers College\", which was founded in October 1981. It was temporarily suspended in May 1982 but later resumed. In 2001, it was renamed following the school's upgrade to an undergraduate institution. The journal has columns such as \"Research on Sichuan Thinkers\" and \"Research on Liquor Culture\".\n\n\n=== Scientific research ===\nYibin University also leverages the existing resources in Yibin City and has carried out a series of scientific research projects around the characteristic industries of Yibin, such as Sichuan tea, Sichuan bamboo, camphor, and fermentation food ingredients. The university's Camphor Engineering Technology Research Center has developed practical products utilizing the characteristics of camphor, including antibacterial sprays, air purifiers, cockroach exterminators, mosquito repellents, and hand sanitizers. The Solid-State Fermentation Resource Utilization Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province primarily focuses on developing high-quality liquor, fermented pickles, tofu products, condiments, and other solid-state fermentation foods. The Sichuan Tea College has achieved significant breakthroughs in the fields of Sichuan tea and Tibetan tea industries through research in the \"Sichuan Key Laboratory of Refined Sichuan Tea\", among others, and as a result, has been selected as one of the first provincial-level \"Modern Industry Institutes\" in Sichuan Province.\nYibin University also collaborates with the local government of Jiang'an County to improve soybean and rice breeding techniques, develop high-quality oil tea and tung trees, and enhance the processing and preservation capabilities of agricultural products. Through training programs, the university has cultivated talents in fields such as e-commerce, integrated rice-prawn farming, and the bamboo industry, contributing to the local community's development.\n\n\n=== Campus Culture ===\nThe guiding spirit of Yibin University is \"Continuous self-improvement and pursuit of excellence\"; the school motto is \"Seeking truth, seeking truth, openness, and innovation\"; the school song is \"Creating Glory\".\nYibin University provides a rich campus life. Since its establishment, students have been actively participating in cultural and sports activities. Some departments have also organized club activities and competitions through curriculum reforms.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

She became known through her bestselling book Alone against the Soul Catchers, which she published in 2005 with the help of Hugo Stamm.\n\n\n== Life ==\nIn the book, she described how she moved from Switzerland to the sect's center in Belize with her parents, who joined the sect Licht-Oase (Light Oasis) in 1992. She also described life in isolation there and how she was sexually abused by the leader of the sect, called \"Benno\" in the book, as well as her escape from the sect in 2001.\nThe name \"Benno\" referred to the German Arno Wollensak. Julie Ravell, Wollensak's partner, described herself as a medium of the spirit Ramtha (also Ram-tha), until she was prohibited from using this name in 1997 in a ruling by the Austrian Supreme Court at the instigation of the owner of the trademark right to the word mark Ramtha, JZ Knight. She subsequently called the spirit being she allegedly channeled Maghan. She called herself \"the source\" in her inner circle.\nLaasner received the Prix Courage in 2005 for her courageous public appearance. Taken in and looked after by a cousin in Switzerland, she completed a three-year course at a commercial college.\nIn 2015, Arno W. and Ravell were arrested in the Uruguayan capital Montevideo. The German judiciary applied for their extradition, which was rejected by a court in Uruguay due to the statute of limitations. The public prosecutor's office considered taking legal action against the decision.\nIn August 2016, the bound and gagged body of Arno W. was found on the beach of La Floresta, 50 km east of Montevideo.\n\n\n== Book publication ==\nAlone against the soul catchers.

        "content": "Gitte Hähner-Springmühl (born 9 October 1951 as Brigitte Springmühl in Zwickau) is a German painter, graphic artist and musician who was part of the independent art scene of the GDR in Chemnitz (Karl-Marx-Stadt) from the 1980s onwards. (Karl-Marx-Stadt) from the 1980s.\n\n\n== Life ==\nBrigitte Springmühl, also known as Gitte Springmühl, later known as Gitte Hähner-Springmühl, initially studied concert guitar for six years at the Robert-Schumann-Konservatorium Zwickau before moving to Karl-Marx-Stadt, now Chemnitz, in 1971. In 1973, she married the artist Klaus Hähner-Springmühl, who had a strong influence on the young art scene in Karl-Marx-Stadt. She had studied literature and librarianship in Leipzig, but then pursued various activities.\nFrom around 1978, she produced her first autodidactic drawings and paintings on literature, e.g. on the schizophrenic poet Ernst Herbeck. Although she divorced in 1979, she worked with Klaus Hähner-Springmühl on actions, performances and free improvisational music, including in the formation Kartoffelschälmaschine. This took place on location in private studios (Hinterhof Richterstraße 9) and the few apartment galleries such as Galerie Oben or EIGEN+ART (Gerd Harry Lybke). The alternative art scene was under observation by Informelle Mitarbeiter, also from the scene itself, the Ministry for State Security, including Gitte Hähner-Springmühl.\nIn 1989, she published 31 copies of the artist's book Obdachlosen-Zone 1 with texts and 17 partly hand-colored serigraphs. \n\n\n== Exhibitions and projects ==\nShe had her first solo exhibition in 1988 at Galerie Hermannstrasse in Chemnitz, followed by others in private galleries. The art scene in Chemnitz attracted attention in West Germany and her works were shown in the exhibition Neuerdings Chemnitz in Munich in 1990. From 1991 to 1993, she worked intensively on the theme \"Underflight - Overflight\", which was also the title of an exhibition in 1995 at the Städtisches Museum Zwickau and the Galerie Oben in Chemnitz. In 1999 and 2000 she realized the Land Art projects \"Seh-Zeichen I + II\" at the ART Galerie Scheel, Morsum (Sylt).\nIn 2003 she founded the private art and music school refugia in Chemnitz. Her last major group exhibition was the \"Kunstbad Keitum\" organized on Sylt in 2005.\n\n\n== Literature ==\nNeuerdings Chemnitz. 11 portraits of artists. (Catalog for the exhibition from November 27 to December 9, 1990, at the Galerie auf der Praterinsel, Munich).

She would also guest at TV Patrol annually as part of New Year's Day observances to give similar forecast for the whole year. \nShe also did astrology forecast for the broadsheet publication, Manila Standard. In the 1980s, Seva wrote for the tabloid Tempo under the pseudonym \"Karma Karissima\".\nThrough the account of her writer friend Jessica Zafra, Seva is said to only need a person's exact birth details and ephemeris to \"tell a person's story\". Seva reportedly was not found of strangers asking her to forecast their future insisting that she has no such ability. Seva died on March 21, 2024.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "José Raúl Mulino Quintero (born 13 June 1959) is a Panamanian lawyer, diplomat and politician, running for president in the 2024 Panamanian election, as a substitute to former president Ricardo Martinelli.\nHe served as Minister of Government and Justice from 2009 to 2010 and Minister of Public Security from 2010 to 2014, both roles in the government of former president Martinelli. He served as Deputy Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs during the government of former president Guillermo Endara. From 1994 to 1995 he was a member of the National Council of Foreign Relations and Substitute Magistrate of the Civil Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice. Mulino was Martinelli's vice-presidential candidate in the 2024 elections, however Martinelli was disqualified from running. As a result, Martinelli endorsed Mulino and Realizing Goals nominated the latter.\n\n\n== Early life and legal career ==\nMulino was born on 13 June 1959 in David, Chiriquí. He is the son of the politician and governor of the province of Chiriquí José Mulino Rovira and the businesswoman Nelly Quintero de Mulino, as well as the brother of the diplomat José Javier Mulino.\nHe completed primary and secondary studies at the San Vicente de Paul School, in David, Chiriquí- He graduated university with a Bachelor of Science and Letters. He later studied law and political science at the Universidad Católica Santa María La Antigua, graduating in 1982. The following year he completed a master's degree in maritime law from Tulane University.\nAfter graduating in law, he dedicated himself to private professional practice in the field of maritime law, and in 1988 he became a founding partner of the Fábrega, Molino y Mulino law firm. During that time he began his activism against the military dictatorship of Manuel Noriega, as a representative of various trade associations.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nIn 1990 he was appointed Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, during the government of president Guillermo Endara, after the restoration of democracy. After the death of Foreign Minister Julio Linares, he became Minister of Foreign Affairs and remained in office until the end of the administration in 1994. During his time as minister, he visited different governments and international organizations, and served as Head of the Negotiating Delegation of the Republic of Panama before the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom, for the negotiation and signing of mutual legal assistance treaties on criminal matters and crimes related to drug trafficking. From 1994 to 1995 he was a member of the National Council of Foreign Relations and Substitute Magistrate of the Civil Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice.\nIn the Martinelli government he was appointed as Minister of Government and Justice in 2009 and served only one year, to 2010 where he submitted his resignation. He was thereafter appointed as Minister of Public Security from 2010 and served until the end of the administration in 2014,. He received important tasks, becoming one of president Martinellis most trusted allies.  As minister he reinforced security on the streets, through the application of police checkpoints, which Mulino claimed was a success as the police had managed to arrest fifteen thousand criminals trying to leave Panama, although some lawyers raised concern.\nOn 9 March 2012, he announced his resignation as Minister of Government and Justice, after disputes with the director of the National Police of Panama Gustavo Pérez, over the regulation of a new statute for security entities of the state. However, on 14 March he retracted his resignation, after the dismissal of Pérez from the position of police by president Martinelli. In July 2013, he was one of those in charge of handling the crisis of the North Korean ship Chong Chon Gang, in which Cuba was transporting war material hidden in 250 thousand bags of brown sugar, but which was detained in Panamanian waters. The North Korean crew members were detained and later released and deported, in addition to receiving a fine from the Panama Canal Authority and retention of war material.\nIn 2015 he was imprisoned for allegedly committing crimes against the public administration, but in the end his case in 2016 was annulled due to procedural errors.\nMulino has been involved in party politics and was the founder of the Solidarity Party, serving first as vice president and then president. He later served as the Second Vice President of the Patriotic Union. He joined Martinellis Democratic Change in 2011 until he left the party in 2019, three years later he joined Martinellis new founded party Realizing Goals.\n\n\n=== Presidential and vice-presidential runs ===\nOn 28 May 2018, he ran as a presidential candidate for Democratic Change (CD), with the purpose of regaining control of the party for former leader Martinelli, who had friction with Rómulo Roux, the new president of CD. However, he lost the primaries to Roux, with whom he then, after several months of refusal, allied to support his candidacy in the 2019 elections. Mulino argued that his alliance sought to return growth, prosperity and job that CD had achieved during the Martinelli government, whom he also supported on his return to the country, however Roux finished in a second place losing narrowly to Laurentino Cortizo.\nMulino was Martinelli's vice-presidential candidate in the 2024 elections, however Martinelli was disqualified from running after being sentenced to almost eleven years in prison for money laundering. As a result, Martinelli who led all polls in the follow-up to the election endorsed Mulino and Realizing Goals nominated the latter. After the endorsement 26% of those surveyed said they would vote for Mulino in the elections, 16 points more than his immediate followers, according to the survey by the company Mercado Planificado, published by the newspaper La Prensa. After Martinelli's disqualification, the Electoral Tribunal decided that the ballot for the Realizing Goals should list Mulino as \"presidential candidate without a vice president.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ronaldo Augusto Lessa Santos GOMM (Maceió, April 25, 1949) is a Brazilian civil engineer and politician, former vice-president of Maceió, former governor of Alagoas for two states, former federal deputy for this state and former vice president from Maceió. He is currently vice-governor of Alagoas, affiliated with the Democratic Labor Party (PDT). He is the cousin of Federal Deputy, Maurício Quintella Lessa.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nRonaldo Lessa is the father of three children: Nivaldo, born in 1992, adopted by the politician at the age of ten; Nina, born in 1986; and Dário, born in 1973, adopted by the politician at the age of seventeen.\nHe began his political activism with the Brazilian Communist Party (PCB). He studied civil engineering at the Federal University of Alagoas (Ufal), and there he led the student directories that opposed the military regime established in March 1964. In 1966, he joined the Brazilian Democratic Movement (MDB), a party opposing the government. He was also president of the Alagoan University Sports Federation (FADU) from 1969 to 1971. Because of his involvement in student circles, he was imprisoned for a few days in 1969. From 1973 onwards, Lessa worked on projects such as the renovation of the Duque refinery in Caxias, the maritime terminal in Ilha Grande Bay, the Rio de Janeiro Metro, and the Rio-Niterói Bridge. \nHe began his political career in 1982, when he was elected state deputy in Alagoas for the PMDB. He ran for state government in 1986, coming in third. He was elected mayor of Maceió in 1992, and in 1996, he supported and elected Kátia Born as his successor. In 1998, already affiliated with the PSB, he became governor of Alagoas, elected in the first round and re-elected in 2002 after beating former President of the Republic Fernando Collor de Mello. In the same year, he published his book Coragem para Sonhar e Fazer. \nIn February 2005, he joined the PDT, for which he would contest the 2006 election to the Federal Senate. This time, he would end up defeated by Collor. In the 2010 elections, he again ran for government in Alagoas, where he reached the second round but was defeated by Teotônio Vilela Filho. In the 2012 elections, Ronaldo ran for mayor of Maceió but had his candidacy denied. Candidate Rui Palmeira won in the first round.\nIn March 2016, he left the coordination of the Alagoas bench in the Chamber of Deputies for health reasons. The parliamentarian reported that he was suffering from a headache, which is why he has been on medical leave since January. He resumed his position in the Chamber at the end of March  and coordinated the bench at the beginning of April. \nIn 2018, he was again a candidate for federal deputy for the PDT but failed to be re-elected. He was the first substitute in his coalition, with 55,474 votes. In 2020, he was elected vice mayor of Maceió on the ticket of João Henrique Caldas.  In 2022, he was elected vice governor on Paulo Dantas' ticket. \n\n\n== Controversies ==\nElectoral Slander\nRonaldo Lessa was sentenced to eight months in prison, converted to providing services to the community, and paid a fine for electoral slander. As stated in the records, in October 2010, the PDT campaign committee was broken into, and, at the time, two computers were stolen from the premises. Lessa, then a candidate for governor, would have stated that the government was the biggest suspect in the crime, referring to the then candidate for re-election, Teotônio Vilela Filho, from the PSDB, in an interview published in the newspaper Gazeta de Alagoas, according to the complaint. The court considered that there was intent to offend the honor of the opponent in an electoral dispute. The parliamentarian appealed the decision, which was upheld.\nAccording to the rapporteur of the action at the Federal Supreme Court, Minister Gilmar Mendes, the defense's claim that the then candidate's statements to the press did not lead to the identification of Teotônio Vilela as being offended is not sustainable. For the minister, Ronaldo Lessa points out, in his statements, as the main or biggest suspect in the theft, \"the candidate who is our opponent,\"  in the published version, and \"the government,\"  in the recording. \"By mentioning our opponent or the government, the appellant directed his statements to the opponent,\"  stated the rapporteur. According to the minister, there was no direct attribution of the crime in Lessa's statement, but rather her suspicion. \"However, the criminal nature of slander does not require the attribution of certainty to the imputation,\"  he stated. One can slander, according to the minister, placing doubt on the authorship of a crime without saying so explicitly.\nOperation Razor\nThe deputy was sentenced for embezzlement and crimes against public administration to 13 years and 4 months in prison and payment of a fine. In the same process, businessman Zuleido Soares de Veras, from the Gautama construction company, was sentenced to 8 years in prison . The complaint, proposed by the Federal Public Ministry , was based on the MPF's own investigations and the final report of Operation Navalha, sent by the Federal Police . The parliamentarian appealed the sentence and was acquitted on appeal, in October 2017, by the Federal Supreme Court.\nIn October 2017, the deputy was acquitted by the 2nd Panel of the Federal Supreme Court due to lack of evidence.\nOperation Gabiru\nRonaldo Lessa was cleared by the judge in the case due to lack of evidence.\nAdministrative misconduct\nLessa and Eduardo Henrique Ferreira, former Secretary of Finance, were convicted in a public civil action of administrative improbity due to mismanagement and misappropriation of R$50 million from the State Fund for Combating and Eradicating Poverty (FECOEP). The court ordered the loss of public service, the suspension of his political rights for three years, the prohibition of contracting with public authorities or receiving tax or credit incentives, and the imposition of a fine.\nAccording to the decision, the State Public Prosecutor's Office reported that the fund, made up of revenue resulting from the ICMS levied on products classified as superfluous, despite having been established in 2004, only in 2005, by means of a decree, began to be collected with the additional Cool. \"The accusations of committing administrative improbity brought to court refer to the irregularity in the management of the fund, as they state that only its form of collection was established, but violating the rules that determine the expenditure and its linking to specific purposes,\"  the judges justified. Added to this, no specific bank account was created for the fund, with the amounts being deposited in the state's single account, which resulted in the expenditure of funds belonging to the fund without observing the fixed destination, using resources to cover other expenses of the fund. state, which would be prohibited. \"There were more than R$ 50,000,000.00 that should have been directly allocated to combating the eradication of poverty that plagues the state of Alagoas, amounts that were, exceptionally, charged to citizens on the increase in ICMS, but which, in the end, were used to cover everyday expenses of the state of Alagoas, those that they were already naturally obliged to carry out.\" Lessa appealed the sentence, and the appeal is still ongoing. \nFocoep was established on December 30, 2004, and receives 2% of the ICMS rate charged on products considered 'superfluous', such as alcoholic beverages, fireworks, weapons and ammunition, sports boats, jewellery, gasoline, ethanol and hydrated for fuel purposes, and electrical energy—in supply that exceeds the consumption range of 150 KWh per month—for home and commercial consumption—cigarettes, cigars, and perfumes. In 2010, under Teotônio Vilela Filho's administration, it was extended for an indefinite period. \nEmbezzlement of resources from the General Hospital and controversy with the prosecutor\nRonaldo Lessa and the former state secretary of health, Kátia Born, were accused by the Federal Public Ministry of misappropriation of public resources in the amount of R$ 5 million during the renovation of the Dr. Armando Lages Emergency Unit, currently the State General Hospital (HGE), in Maceió.  According to the lawsuit, the defendants defrauded the bidding process using overpricing and non-performance of the contract. Also, according to the complaint, the company that won the bid for the reform of the HGE, Arquitec, would have given the money to the campaigns of Ronaldo Lessa, his brother Antônio Lessa, and secretary Kátia Born.\n\nOn February 20, in an interview published by the G1 portal, Lessa informed us that she was filing a representation against prosecutor Anselmo Henrique, considering that the accusations were arbitrary. He compared the MPF's decisions with those that occurred during the military dictatorship and said he was persecuted. The former governor said, \"They are persecuting me. This prosecutor is a thief. I want him to prove that I embezzled all this money.\"\"\n\nFollowing this accusation, on March 8, 2013, the MPF filed a complaint against the former governor for the crimes of slander, insult, and threat, for having described the public prosecutor Anselmo Henrique Cordeiro Lopes as a thief, irresponsible, and frivolous in press interviews in February 19th and 20th. Lessa would also have attacked the institution when she stated, when referring to the proposed action, that this was \"another frivolous attitude from agents of the Public Ministry. These people should respect the institution, which has a lot of bums within the Public Ministry.\" \n. On that occasion, the National Association of Public Prosecutors (ANPR) issued a note repudiating the former governor's statements.\n\nLessa and former secretary Kátia Born were acquitted of the charges. \n\n\n== References ==",

She studied mathematics and physics in Heidelberg and at the Émile Jaques-Dalcroze school in Dresden-Hellerau. rhythmics and ear training. She took her exams there in 1913, followed by further studies in Bonn. As a student, she also attended lectures by Martin Buber and belonged to the Zionist youth association Blau-Weiß.\nIn 1914, Dore Marcus married the mathematician, educator and philosopher Artur Jacobs. Together they founded the Bund - Gemeinschaft für sozialistisches Leben. The aim was a way of life in which the whole person should be integrated - body, mind and soul. This also included movement and dance.\nIn 1925, she founded the Bundesschule für Körperbildung und rhythmische Erziehung (today: Dore-Jacobs-Berufskolleg). The schools were banned and closed in 1934. Dore Jacobs survived underground with the help of the Bund, which continued to operate illegally under the leadership of her husband Artur Jacobs. By September 1944, she - who until then had been considered a privileged Jew - was forced to go into hiding. She and her husband found refuge on Lake Constance in a boarding house run by friends\nIn the post-war period, which was marked by serious illness, Dore Jacobs concentrated on completing her textbooks on movement education. The school she founded is still run privately today as the Dore-Jacobs-Berufskolleg.\n\n\n== Writings (selection) ==\nDie menschliche Bewegung. Düsseldorf 1972.\nBewegungsbildung - Menschenbildung.

        "content": "The Parus Hotel (Ukrainian: Парус Готель) is an unfinished 20th-century hotel in the city of Dnipro, Ukraine. The building sits on the embankment of the Dnieper River. It is one of the few skyscrapers built during the Ukrainian SSR, and ranks as the 15th tallest building in the country.  \n\n\n== Design ==\nThe Y-shaped structure is 114 metres (374 ft) tall, has 32 stories. They take up 28 stories in a high-rise section and a total of 188,991 square metres (2,034,280 sq ft) in the base of two stylobats. In spite of all these measurements, the rooms have a ceiling height of 2.5 metres (8 ft 2 in). There were 589 hotel rooms with 996 seats in the high-rise section. It consisted of a 600-seat restaurant, a 200-seat cafe, a banquet hall for 60, a bar for 50, billiard rooms, a 120-seat conference hall, a 450-seat concert hall, exhibition halls, a hair salon, a 100-seat dining room, a laundry, a drying department, a carpentry shop, and much more are all included in the project. A swimming pool, dock, parking, and its own substation were also planned.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Communist Party of Ukraine Central Committee came up with the proposal to construct a hotel in Dnepropetrovsk (now Dnipro) during the early part of the 1970s. The hotel would serve as a venue for party congresses and seminars in addition to serving as a lodging for visitors visiting historical sites. Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev helped put the proposal into action. The structure was also intended to represent the might of the Soviet Union. The Dnieper's bank was chosen as the location for the building of a 29-story hotel-skyscraper.The State Design Institute Dneprograzhdanproekt team started putting the concept into practice in 1972 when they created a project for the Parus Hotel's complex of buildings and structures. Vladimir Zuyev oversaw the project together with a group of architects that included B. Mitgauz, V. Tovstik, and I. Bogdanov. The The hotel complex proposal includes tourist destinations with a complex of medical and repair services, sports and recreation, and retail and entertainment.The project was approved for 25 million rubles, but only somewhat less than 10 million were provided by Moscow; the remaining funds had to be obtained through patronage support in order to hire people at local firms. Under Brezhnev's personal protection, funds from Moscow were disbursed, the project was moved to the balance of the Ukrainian SSR, and construction was approved in 1974.The irrigation of the sandy coast was finished in 1974, and construction and installation work started in 1975. The structure's framework was constructed throughout the next three years. It was predicted that construction would be finished in 1979. The Ukrainian Ministry of Public Utilities initially provided funding for the building project. Many of the projects were completed at no cost by neighborhood businesses. But soon Kyiv, like Moscow, disowned the hotel and gave it over to the Dnepropetrovsk City Council, who were unable to manage the building financially.Although the facility had disastrously low funding in the early part of the 1980s, the construction halted between 1984 and 1987 due to insufficient funds. Even though the development was moving extremely slowly by 1995, several windows and doors had already been largely fitted. Experts predicted that six months of arduous labor were still ahead. Both the construction and the funding halted altogether when the structure was almost eighty percent complete.The hotel appeared to come to life in 2000, when the hotel was painted in the hues of white, green, and yellow. PrivatBank used the structure to display its emblem as a means of advertisement. The 32-story hotel has now been converted into a billboard for the business. It was decided to build a life-size space technology museum close to the hotel in the early 2000s. However, as reality has proven, this project can no longer be carried out.At the XII session of the City Council on 8 December 2004, it was resolved to determine the fate of the doomed long-term development project. As a result, the deputies agreed to hold an auction on 4 July 2005, to privatize the Parus Hotel complex. Rombus-Privat indicated their willingness to buy the construction. A new design created by Vyacheslav Tovstikov, the head of the Dneprograzhdanproekt Institute, and architect Andrey Pashenko of Kyiv was unveiled to the public in 2006. The Kyiv firm requests a five-year development delay in January 2010. As per the deal, purchasers are now required to finish the hotel by 2015.A massive Ukrainian coat of arms was painted on the hotel in 2014. The Central Economic Court of Appeal's ruling to end the purchase and selling agreement between the Dnipro City Council and the business Rombus-Privat became effective on 18 November 2021. Thus, the Parus Hotel was given back to the city. The hotel building will be demolished by the city officials, who have already painted over the coat of arms. The area where the structure is located has been drastically rearranged.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nSkyscrapers of Ukraine\nList of tallest buildings in Ukraine\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "The 2024 Bolton Metropolitan Borough Council election will take place on 2 May 2024. One third of councillors (20 out of 60) are to be elected. The election will take place alongside other local elections across the United Kingdom.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe Local Government Act 1972 created a two-tier system of metropolitan counties and districts covering Greater Manchester, Merseyside, South Yorkshire, Tyne and Wear, the West Midlands, and West Yorkshire starting in 1974. Bolton was a district of the Greater Manchester metropolitan county. The Local Government Act 1985 abolished the metropolitan counties, with metropolitan districts taking on most of their powers as metropolitan boroughs. The Greater Manchester Combined Authority was created in 2011 and began electing the mayor of Greater Manchester from 2017, which was given strategic powers covering a region coterminous with the former Greater Manchester metropolitan county.\nIn December 2022, the Local Government Boundary Commission for England made The Bolton (Electoral Changes) Order 2022, which officially abolished all 20 existing wards and established 20 new wards with new boundaries. All 60 wards were contested at the 2023 elections. The elected councillor who received the least number of votes in each ward at the previous election will have their seat up in this election.\n\n\n== Electoral process ==\nThe council elects its councillors in thirds, with a third being up for election every year for three years, with no election in the fourth year. The election will take place by first-past-the-post voting, with wards being represented by three councillors, with one elected in each election year to serve a four-year term.\nAll registered electors (British, Irish, Commonwealth and European Union citizens) living in Bolton aged 18 or over will be entitled to vote in the election. People who live at two addresses in different councils, such as university students with different term-time and holiday addresses, are entitled to be registered for and vote in elections in both local authorities. Voting in-person at polling stations will take place from 07:00 to 22:00 on election day, and voters will be able to apply for postal votes or proxy votes in advance of the election.\n\n\n== Previous council composition ==\n\nChanges:\n\n4 May 2023: Derek Bullock (Conservative) was re-elected at the 2023 elections as a Conservative after being selected by the local Conservative Association, but has sat as an independent after being expelled by the national Conservative Party in April 2023 due to racist comments.\n2 October 2023: Paul Heslop (One Kearsley) resigns; by-election scheduled for 16 November 2023.\n2 October 2023: Bernadette Eckersley-Fallon (Conservative) resigns; by-election scheduled for 16 November 2023.\n3 October 2023: Debbie Newall and Melanie Livsey (One Kearsley) join the Labour Party, marking the dissolution of their former party.\n16 November 2023: Tracey Wilkinson wins Kearsley by-election; Farnworth and Kearsley First gain seat from One Kearsley.\n16 November 2023: Deirdre McGeown wins Westhoughton North and Hunger Hill by-election; Liberal Democrats gain seat from the Conservatives.\n14 March 2024: Craig Rotheram (Horwich and Blackrod First) resigns; by-election scheduled for 2 May 2024.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Zakaria \"Zaki\" Hannache (Arabic: زكي حنّاش; born 1987) is an Algerian human rights activist who rose to prominence in 2019 due to his documentation of human rights abuses by the Algerian government against members of the Hirak movement. In 2022, after being charged with multiple offences including undermining state security, Hannache sought asylum in Tunisia, before settling in Canada in 2023, where he continues his activism in exile.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nHannache was born in Béjaïa, Béjaïa Province, Algeria, into an Amazigh family. Prior to the Hirak movement, he was an industrial technician working for the state-owned electricity and natural gas company Sonelgaz and living in Algiers. Hannache described himself as this time as being \"apolitical\" and focused on getting married and moving abroad.\n\n\n== Activism ==\nOn 16 February 2019, a peaceful march was organised in Algiers to protest the then-President of Algeria, Abdelaziz Bouteflika's recent announcement of his plan to run for a fifth presidential term. Subsequent protests across the country led to Bouteflika announcing his immediate resignation on 2 April 2019; the protests continued to occur, primarily on Fridays, with protestors calling for a complete overhaul of Algeria's political system.\nHannache had not taken part in the initial marches, but subsequently joined an ad hoc monitoring group that collected, verified, and documented information pertaining to the arrests of people taking part in the Hirak protests. Utilising Facebook and online messaging, Hannache also publicly advocated for the rights and releases of detained activists, and became a trusted source for their families and lawyers, often disseminating information to international groups and organisations including the United Nations.\n\n\n== Arrest and trial ==\nOn 15 February 2022, Hannache gave an interview with Jeune Afrique in which he disputed Bouteflika's successor, Abdelmadjid Tebboune's claim that there were no prisoners of conscience in Algeria, presenting his own research that had identified 340 such prisoners in the country as of 9 February. Three days later, on 18 February, Hannache was arrested by plainclothes police officers at his home in Cherarba, Algiers. Hannache was placed into police custody, while warrants were obtained to search his home and seize his phone.\nBetween 18 February and 24 February, Hannache was interviewed by the police without having legal representation. On 24 February, Hannache appeared before an investigative judge at the Sidi M'Hamed Court in Algiers, where he was charged with \"disseminating false information\", \"praising terrorism\", \"receiving funds from an institution inside or outside of the country\", and \"undermining state security\"; Hannache was placed into pre-trial detention. Evidence used against Hannache included his reporting on hunger strikes by imprisoned activists, which the government stated was false; an online interview an exiled YouTuber, Amir DZ, who had been described as a terrorist by the government; and prize money he had received as part of a human rights award he was given in 2021.\nHannache's arrest occurred at the same time as the arrest of another prominent activist, Faleh Hammoudi from the Tlemcen office of the Algerian League for the Defence of Human Rights, who had been arrested two days after Hannache, and who similarly had been taken into custody and had his home searched and phone seized. Within 24 hours of Hannache's arrest, a petition signed by 15 organisations and 130 Algerian personalities was released, calling for Hannache's immediate release. Mustapha Bouchachi, the former president of the Algerian League for the Defence of Human Rights, described Hannache as \"an essential vehicle for documenting human rights violations\".\nOn 31 March, Hannache  was provisionally released from custody on bail. In March 2023, Hannache was convincted in absentia and was sentenced to three years imprisonment. The court subsequently issued an international arrest warrant for his immediate arrest.\n\n\n== Exile ==\nIn August 2022, Hannache left Algeria for Tunisia on medical grounds, that had been granted. During his time in Tunisia, Hannache continued to report on human rights abuses in Algeria, including the arrests of journalists and activists and the closures of human rights organisations, while living in hiding in Tunis, moving an estimated 11 times to avoid detection from Algerian authorities. Hannache expressed his concern about his safety in Tunisia, citing the case of Slimane Bouhafs, a fellow Algerian activist with refugee status in Tunisia who had disappeared in 2021, before surfacing in 2022 in custody in Algeria following a case of refoulement by Tunisian authorities. Hannache reported that on at least two occasions, Algerian police officers had been searching for him in Tunis.\nOn 9 November, he received summons for a court hearing at the Sidi M'Hamed Court on 13 November; the following day, Hannache applied for asylum, with the UN Refugee Agency formally recognising him as a refugee. A joint statement by 55 human rights organisations, including the Algerian League for the Defence of Human Rights, Amnesty International, Front Line Defenders, and the Tunisian Human Rights League, called on the Tunisian government to protect Hannache's right to safety, stating that his forced return to Algeria would set a \"dangerous precedent\" for human rights. At the same time, the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights Defenders expressed their \"serious concerns\" for Hannache's charges, stating they appeared to be linked to his human rights activism.\nOn 19 December 2023, Hannache moved to Canada, which had agreed to resettle him.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nIn December 2021, Hannache was awarded the Ali Boudoukha Prize for his work documenting human rights abuses against Hirak activists.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Abu Hashim Bukayr ibn Mahan (died 744) was one of the chief leaders of the Hashimiyya movement and its propaganda that aimed to overthrow the Umayyad Caliphate. His exact role in the movement, as well as the movement's origins and aims, have been the subject of intense scholarly debate.\n\n\n== Origin and early life ==\nBukayr was not Arab, but of Iranian origin. He possibly hailed from Sijistan, but some traditions give his place of birth as the village of Hurmuzfarrah, near the town of Merv in Khurasan. The historian Patricia Crone suggested that another leading figure of the Hashimiyya, Isa ibn Mahan, may have been Bukayr's brother.\nBukayr's father, and Bukayr after him, were mawali (clients) of the Banu Musliya tribe, which belonged to the Yaman or southern Arab tribal group. Bukayr's initial career was spent in service of the Umayyad Caliphate, initially fighting under Yazid ibn al-Muhallab in campaigns in Khurasan and Jurjan. He then served as secretary and translator for Sa'id ibn Amr al-Harashi, governor of Khurasan in 721–723, and then for al-Junayd ibn Abd al-Rahman, governor of Sind. At Sind, he was informed that his brother Yazid had died and left him a large fortune; upon news of this, Bukayr left his post and went to Kufa.\n\n\n== Work in the Hashimiyya ==\nKufa was a hotbed of proto-Shi'a sentiment, and it was there that he was converted to the cause of the Hashimiyya. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nAgha, Saleh Said (2011). \"Bukayr b.

Watching a documentary about Kurt Cobain titled Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck at the age of 16 first inspired him to write songs.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAt age 17 Artemas made his first so-called “very bad rock song” that was played on the local radio. \nArtemas first music release was the single \"High 4 U\" in November 2020. His sound was compared to that of Rex Orange County \"with a hint of R&B\" in 2022. On 24 October 2023, Diamandis released the single \"If U Think I'm Pretty\" which went viral shortly after. By February 2024, the song reached the UK Singles Chart. The single would also lead into the release of his mixtape Pretty. On 19 March 2024, he released the single \"I Like the Way You Kiss Me\". \"I Like The Way You Kiss Me\" peaked at number five on the UK Singles Chart, topped the charts in Germany and Lithuania and peaked within the top ten of the charts in various countries, including Australia, Austria, New Zealand, the Republic of Ireland and Norway.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Mixtapes ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website#",

        "content": "\"I Like the Way You Kiss Me\" is a song by the English-Cypriot singer-songwriter Artemas. It was released independently on 19 March 2024, and follows his debut mixtape Pretty (2024). \"I Like the Way You Kiss Me\" peaked at number three on the UK Singles Chart. Outside the United Kingdom, \"I Like the Way You Kiss Me\" topped the charts in Austria, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, peaked within the top ten of the charts in various countries, including Australia, Canada, France, Ireland, New Zealand and Norway and the top 20 of the charts in Belgium (Flanders) and the United States.\n\n\n== Background ==\nFollowing the release of his debut mixtape Pretty in February 2024 and having hosted two shows at The Lower Third in London, Artemas returned to the recording studio and created \"I Like the Way You Kiss Me\". Artemas announced the single on 15 March on his social media.\n\n\n== Composition ==\nMusically, \"I Like the Way You Kiss Me\" is a darkwave and alternative pop song, fueled by \"moody 80s and pulsating synths\" featuring a \"dark, retro-futuristic sound collage\". Artemas lends his \"crooning, gloomy\" vocals on the chorus as a counterpart to the \"kinetic energy\" of the whole track. Lyrically, he presents a story of a strained relationship, being unsure of where he and his partner stand. Eventually, he confesses that he favours sex over feelings \"by pushing harder for the physicality\".\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Antony Dufort FRSS (born 1948) is an English artist and sculptor. Commissioned works stand in locations in Britain.\n\n\n== Life ==\n\nDuport's maternal grandmother Doris de Halpert, an artist who had studied under Walter Sickert, gave him lessons in drawing and painting. He studied history at New College, Oxford; at Chelsea School of Art he gained a diploma in art and design, and a master's degree in fine art, and he attended a postgraduate art teacher's course at Goldsmiths' College. After working as a film storyboard artist and illustrator, he began a career as a sculptor. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Sculptors, and a Council member of the Society of Portrait Sculptors.\n\n\n== Works ==\n\nDufort's works include the following:\nAn over-life size bronze statue of a bowler, at Lord's Cricket Ground in London, commissioned by the MCC, was unveiled in 2002.\n\"Testing for Gas\", unveiled in 2005, is in Silverhill Wood Country Park near Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire. It is on high ground, a former spoil heap of Silverhill Colliery, which closed in the 1990s. The over life-size bronze statue, on a rock plinth, shows a kneeling coal miner testing for methane gas. It was commissioned by Nottinghamshire County Council to commemorate the Nottinghamshire mining industry.\nBaroness Margaret Thatcher unveiled an over life-size bronze statue of herself, in the Members' Lobby of the Palace of Westminster, London, in 2007. It was commissioned by the Speaker's Advisory Committee on Works of Art.\nA portrait of Britannia was created for the reverse of the £2 Coin of 2015; 650,000 coins were minted.\nA frieze in high-relief, showing miners escaping from a flooded mine, was unveiled in Cinderford in the Forest of Dean in 2022. It is a memorial marking the rescue of 182 miners from Waterloo Colliery in 1949, and was commissioned by Forest of Dean District Council and Cinderford Labour Party. Dufort said: \"When I came to the Forest of Dean about 40 years ago all of my neighbours were all miners or from miners' families.\"\nA memorial to the mathematician George Boole was unveiled outside the railway station in Lincoln in 2022. It was commissioned by the Heslam Trust. Boole, born in Lincoln, is shown as a teacher with two pupils.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Antony Dufort at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "Kim Yak-sŏn (Korean: 김약선; Hanja: 金若先; fl. 13th century) was a Goryeo official. The son-in-law of Ch'oe U, he was the military ruler's heir apparent until his death.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nKim Yak-sŏn was the first-born son of Vice-Director of the Chancellery Kim T'ae-sŏ, hailing from the Jeonju Kim clan. Kim would marry Lady Ch'oe, the daughter of Ch'oe U, due to Kim's prestigious background as a descendant of the Gyeongju Kim monarchs who ruled Silla.\nIn 1219, When Ch'oe U's father, Ch'oe Ch'ung-hŏn, was near death, Ch'oe U entrusted his son-in-law, Kim, to attend to Ch'oe's father as Ch'oe sought to protect his succession.  In 1235, Kim Yak-sŏn's daughter, the future Queen Jeongsun, became the consort of then crown prince Wang Chŏng, the future King Wonjong. As the father-in-law of the future king, Kim was appointed as vice commissioner of the Security Council (추밀부사; 樞密副使; ch'umilpusa).\nAs Kim Yak-sŏn's father-in-law, Ch'oe U, had no legitimate-born sons but only daughters, Kim was the heir to Ch'oe U as the military leader of Goryeo. However, Kim's wife, the daughter of Ch'oe U, committed adultery with a male servant. When Kim Yak-sŏn discovered his wife's affair, to cover up the incident she made a false accusation against her husband. Kim was put to death due to his wife's false accusation. The exact nature of the accusation has not been recorded in history, however it is thought that it must have been equivalent to treason for Ch'oe U to sentence his own heir apparent to death. The truth was later discovered and Kim was given the posthumous name of Changik.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Amelia Mary Irvine (13 April 1866–20 November 1950) was an Irish author who, as A. M. Irvine, wrote 28 books, several on a medical theme, but mostly stories for girls.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nOf Scottish and Irish descent, 'Amy' Irvine was born in Coleraine in County Londonderry, Ireland in 1866, one of seven children of Louisa Caroline née Brady (1840-1912) and the Reverend Arthur Benjamin Irvine (1838-1907), vicar of Holy Trinity Church in West Bromwich, near Birmingham from 1874 to 1902. Although his stipend was meagre, the Rev. Irvine ensured his children were adequately educated for their future lives. Amy Irvine was educated at Sandwell Hall, an Anglican boarding school. In 1891 and 1901 she was living at home with her parents, the last of her siblings to do so.\n\n\n== Writing career ==\nShe developed an interest in medical life and in 1907 published her first novel, The Specialist, which features a minor staple of Edwardian fiction, the life-transforming operation. Another novel on a medical theme, aimed at girls, was The Frantic Misfortunes of a Nurse, Or, The Probationer (1910). In 1911 Irvine bought 78 West Street in Deal, in Kent and here she lived for nearly 50 years. In Deal she lived a simple self-sufficient life supported by her writing. She studied the violin and cello sufficiently well to be able to supplement her income by giving music lessons. In addition she painted landscapes, but this was for her own pleasure.\nDuring World War I she served as a Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD) nurse. The majority of her novels were aimed at schoolgirls, including The Worst Girl in the School and A Girl of the Fourth.\n\n\n== Later years ==\nIrvine had poor health for much of her life and survived a number of strokes. In the summer of 1942 during World War II her home was damaged by an enemy bomb and was looted by two local boys who stole her paints and paintings only to throw them away. Local residents clubbed together to fund the cost of replacing the stolen materials. She died at The Lumeah Nursing Home in Deal in Kent in November 1950. Her estate at her death was valued at £3792 7s. 8d. She never married.\n\n\n== Books by A. M. Irvine ==\nBooks by Irvine include:\n\nThe Beginning and End of Mary Jones [A tale.], Birmingham: The Midland Educational (1893) - as Amy Irvine\nBothersome Babies. True-Alas!, Birmingham: Midland Educational Co (1893) - as Amy Irvine\nThe Specialist, John Lane: The Bodley Head (1904)\nRoger Dinwiddie, Soul Doctor, London: T.

        "content": "The may offensive was a military campaign during the Polish–Ukrainian War. The Polish army under the command of Józef Haller launched the offensive against the forces of the West Ukrainian People's Republic, and as a result the polish forces won, with most of Galicia being captured by the Polish army.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn November of 1918 the Polish–Ukrainian War broke out between the newly established states of Poland and Ukraine. One of the main battles in the month took place in Lviv, Polish forces pushed out the Ukrainian Galician Army from the city, however the UGA began the siege of Lviv.\nIn February of 1919 the Ukrainians attempted to capture Lviv. But after 5 days of fighting the polish forces repulsed the Ukrainian attack, and on March 18th the siege of Lviv was broken.\n\n\n=== Polish preparation for the offensive ===\nIn order to gain better positions before the general offensive planned for May, the Polish Army launched an operation code-named 'Jazda' on 19 April. A flurry of attacks supported by strong air power led to the repulsion of the Ukrainians from the Lubien Wielki-Bartatów-Skniłów line and the Poles reached the Glinna-Nawaria-Nadgórzany-Sołonka-Zubrza line.\nAt the end of April 1919, the Supreme Command of the Polish Armed Forces drew up a plan for an offensive against the West Ukrainian army in Eastern Galicia. The aim of the operation was to smash the Ukrainian army operating in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia, to ensure the safety of the Polish population living in these areas, to recapture areas of Eastern Galicia and to obtain a direct link between Poland and Romania.\n\n\n=== Polish forces ===\nUnder the orders of General Józef Haller, considerable forces were grouped. Their core consisted of:\n\nI Corps under General Dominique Joseph Odry\n1st Rifle Division of the Polish Army in France, commanded by Joseph Jean Bernard\n2nd Rifle Division of the Polish Army in France, commanded by Louis Modelon\nOperational Group under General Aleksander Karnicki\nGroup under General Wacław Iwaszkiewicz with his subordinated Operational Group under General Władysław Jędrzejewski\n3rd Infantry Division of the Polish Legions, commanded by Henryk Minkiewicz\n4th Infantry Division, commanded by Franciszek Aleksandrowicz\nThe total combat strength of the Polish troops scheduled for the operation was about 50,000 soldiers, 200 cannons and 900 machine guns. While the Ukrainian forces under the command of General Mykhailo Omelianovich-Pavlenko, had at that time around 44,000 troops, 552 machine guns and 144 cannons.\n\n\n== The offensive ==\nOn the 14th of May the offensive started. The Poles in Volhynia captured Mosty Wielkie and Sokal, at the same time Ukrainian forces were pushed out of Belz this ended the defense of Belz by Polish forces in a victory. On the 15th of May Polish forces led by Wacław Iwaszkiewicz-Rudoszański and Zygmunt Zieliński attacked Chyrów, this assault broke the front, forcing the entire Ukrainian III Corps to retreat behind the Dniester line. On the 17th of May the Polish army commanded by Henryk Minkiewicz attacked the Ukrainian forces near Kamianka-Buzka, it ended with the capture of the Lwów-Brody line and the  pushing the remnants of the troops of the Ukrainian corps of ataman Osyp Mykytka towards the town of Busk. The next day forces commanded by Wacław Iwaszkiewicz-Rudoszański attacked Drohobych, The tough resistance of the Ukrainian army of General Mykhailo Omelyanovich-Pavlenko was broken and during the pursuit the 9th Małopolska Uhlan Regiment, Lt Stanislaw Maczek's assault company and the 37th Infantry Regiment took Drohobych. \nOn the 22nd of May after Polish forces captured the Boryslav-Drohobych line, pushed the Ukrainian forces out of the outskirts of Lviv, ending the half a year siege by the Ukrainian Galician Army. Józef Haller said this after ending the siege:\n\nSoldiers! Under the mighty blow of your breastworks the entire enemy line has been broken and the enemy ring surrounding Lwów has disintegrated.... I trust that you will continue to exert all your strength and will bring about the final complete victory for the glory of the Republic of Poland.\nOn the 25th of May, Polish forces reached the Bolechów - Chodorów - Bóbrka - Busk line. At the same time, the Romanian army, together with the 4th Polish Rifle Division, began to occupy the south-western areas of ZURL (Pokucia). These areas included Kolomyja and Sniatyn.  The next day Polish forces captured Ivano-Frankivsk. The remaining Ukrainian soldiers were interned by Czechoslovakia. On the 1st of June Polish forces captured Tarnopol.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe offensive was a Polish success, and by the 1st of June the Ukrainian Galician Army found itself on the Ukrainian Death Triangle. Most of Galicia and Volhynia were captured by Polish forces. 2/3 of the UGA was destroyed, and the entire army was demoralized. Poland, in turn, was able to reach the borders with Romania , while cutting off the WUNR from Czechoslovakia - the only (not counting the UPR) trading partner of the West Ukrainian People's Republic.\n\n\n== References ==",

He was also an Academician of the Academy of Sciences of the Armenian SSR (1994, corresponding member 1986). He is the elder brother of Frunze Dovlatyan.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nVram Dovlatyan was born in Nor Bayazet. He participated in the Great Patriotic War and worked there as a coder at the headquarters. In 1949 he graduated from the Faculty of Chemistry of Yerevan State University.\nSince 1954, he worked at the Department of General Chemistry of the Armenian Agricultural Institute, from 1958 to 1989 he served as head of the Department of General Chemistry.\nFrom 1962 to 2005, he was the head of the Laboratory of Pesticide Problems at the same institute, and since 1962 he also headed the experimental laboratory for the synthesis of pesticides. Full member of the RAS since 1994.\nNew highly active herbicides, fungicides and growth stimulants discovered in the Dovlatyanovsky scientific laboratory are widely used in agriculture. He studied the reactions of chloromethoxymethylation of the ester acetic acid, the catalytic effect of quaternary ammonium salts on the formation of esters carbonic acid. Unique rearrangement reactions of chloralkox (thio, amine-sim-triazines) were discovered (in combination with the production of tara-sim-triazines).\n\n\n== Works ==\nAuthor of about 450 scientific works, including 130 copyright certificates. Based on his developments, 4 doctoral and 50 candidate dissertations were defended.\nFor 40 years he headed the department of general chemistry of the Armenian Agricultural Institute, now the State Agrarian University of Armenia. There he created a problematic laboratory for the synthesis and testing of pesticides, which he led until the end of his life.\n\nAuthor of many patents.\nHerbicides, antifungal agents and growth stimulants were obtained (crotilin, metazin, zulfazin, phenagon, alavin, etc.), some of which were invested in agriculture.\nStudied the reactions of chloromethoxymethylation of acetoacetic acid ester, the catalytic effect of quaternary ammonium salts on the formation of both esters of carboxylic acids.\nDiscovered original rearrangement reactions of chloroalkoxy(thio,amino)-sym-triazines (conjugated to form tera-sym-triazines).\nThe method for the synthesis of cyanamine-sim-trazines proposed by Dovlatyan is patented in Germany, Japan, and Switzerland.\nIncluded in the list of 500 influential leaders in the field of world science.\nDovlatyan managed to solve the problem of effective disposal of waste chloroprene rubber - 1,3-dichlorobutene-2, on the basis of which he obtained the herbicide crotiline, which is widely used.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nOrder of the Patriotic War, 2nd class\nOrder of the Red Banner of Labour (2)\nOrder of the Badge of Honour\nHonored Scientist of the Armenian SSR\nJubilee Medal \"In Commemoration of the 100th Anniversary of the Birth of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin\"\nJubilee Medal \"Twenty Years of Victory in the Great Patriotic War 1941–1945\"\nJubilee Medal \"Thirty Years of Victory in the Great Patriotic War 1941–1945\"\nJubilee Medal \"50 Years of Victory in the Great Patriotic War 1941–1945\"\nJubilee Medal \"60 Years of Victory in the Great Patriotic War 1941–1945\"\nJubilee Medal \"70 Years of the Armed Forces of the USSR\"\nMedal \"Veteran of Labour\"\nAnania Shirakatsi Medal\nVoted Person of the Year 1997 by the American Biographical Institute.\nAmerican Biographical Institute title \"Man of the Century\".\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Don Wattrick (April 2, 1910 – September 28, 1965) was an American basketball player, coach, broadcaster, and executive who was executive manager of the Detroit Pistons of the National Basketball Association from 1964 to 1965.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nWattrick was born in Battle Creek, Michigan and attended school in Battle Creek and Lansing, Michigan. He played basketball at Central State and coached at Lansing Central, Chesaning, and Bay City Central high schools before pursing a career in sports broadcasting.\n\n\n== Broadcasting ==\nWattrick began his broadcasting career at WKAR while attending Michigan State University. In 1942, he became the sports director at WXYZ in Detroit. While at the station, he called Detroit Red Wings, high school football, and Michigan Wolverines football games. During World War II, he was also a sales and advertising executive with in the Ford Motor Company. In 1946, he joined WJR as host of the Sports Parade and play-by-play announcer for University of Michigan football games. Wattrick returned to WXYZ in 1948 and on October 9, 1948, was part of the first day of broadcasting at WXYZ-TV.\nNationally, Wattrick called Cleveland Browns games for the DuMont Television Network during the 1952 NFL season and provided commentary for ABC's Motor City Boxing, which aired for three months in 1953.\n\n\n== Detroit Pistons ==\nIn 1962, Wattrick replaced Bill Flemming as the Detroit Pistons' the radio announcer. In 1964, Pistons owner Fred Zollner promoted Wattrick to general manager. One of his first moves was firing head coach Charley Wolf and replacing him with 24-year old player Dave DeBusschere. The Pistons selected Bill Buntin in the 1965 NBA draft, but Wattrick was unable to sign him to a contract. Before the start of the 1965–66 season, the Pistons lost their leading scorer, Terry Dischinger (military service) and starting center, Reggie Harding (suspension). On September 28, 1965, Wattrick died of a heart attack at his home in Detroit.\n\n\n== References ==",

He was the son of \"sultan\" Mohamed Hammed. According to Ahmed Dini, he is actually \"sultan\" of Rehayto under the name of Dini Mohamed Bourhan. He was one of Abubakr Pasha's nephews and in 1839, he was responsible for accompanying Rochet D'Hericourt through Afar territories. In 1842, he visited Paris, in the name of sultans of Tadjourah and Raheita, ceding territory from Ras Doumeira to Goubet El-Kharrab.\n\n\n== Treaties with France ==\nDini Ahmed Abou Baker went to Paris in 1862 aboard the Somme, commanded by Alphonse Fleuriot de Langle. He signed the Treaty of Transfer of Obock on behalf of the \"sultans\" Mohammed ben Mohamed, Diny Koullou Osman Aly Ibrahim Aboubekr Chahm and Loeita, \"leaders of the tribes of the Danakils Adalys and Debenehs\". This transfer was implemented in 1884 with the creation of the Obock Territory.\nIn 1863, Dini Ahmed wrote to the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, Édouard Thouvenel, to ask him for his protection against the Ottoman pasha of Hodeida who requested the payment of 9,000 thalers, probably that of the Zeila customs granted to Abu-Bakr.\nIn 1885, at the time of the colonial installation, Diny Ahmed confirmed the terms of the 1862 text.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"Name of Love\" is the last single created by the Japanese band Cinema Staff, and was used as the ending theme for season three part two of the anime Attack on Titan. Announced on 3 February and released in full on 29 May 2019, the song became the first single to be released by the band in nearly two and a half years, and the second song the band created for the anime: after their ending for season one part two titled \"great escape\" was successful. The song has since been performed on at least two occasions by the band during musical tours across Japan, and has gained positions on the Billboard Japan and Oricon top single charts.\n\n\n== Background and release ==\nThe song was announced by the band Cinema Staff on 3 February 2019 as the ending theme for the second half season three of the anime Attack on Titan. The announcement marked the band's first single in nearly two and a half years, their prior most recent being \"Vektor E.P.\" released in November 2018, and the second collaboration with the anime since creating the song \"great escape\" for the second half of season one. A shortened version of the song was used starting 28 April 2019 for the release of season 3 part 2 of the anime, alongside the Linked Horizon opening \"Shoukei to Shikabane no Michi\".\nThe full version of the song was released on 29 May 2019 as a single across multiple music streaming and distribution services including Apple Music, Spotify, Recochoku, and iTunes. The largely vocal song was sung by band member Mizuki Iida. The single released in two artworks: one featuring the main vocalist (Mizuki Iida) standing against a monochrome background with the name of the single written in front, and a \"first limited edition jacket design\" which displays original artwork by Wit Studio, the anime season's animator, of some of the season's main characters. The single release also included three other songs: titled \"OCEAN\", \"Saraba Rakuen Yo\" (さらば楽園よ, lit. \"Farewell to Paradise\"), and \"great escape (2019 new mix)\" as the second, third, and fourth tracks respectively. The additional two songs were described by Tower Records as also being \"reminiscent\" of the anime. The song later was included in the band's one and only album \"BEST OF THE SUPER CINEMA 2008-2011/2012-2019\" on 18 September 2019, which was a compilation of 36 remastered versions of the band's songs, including two new songs.\n\n\n== Performances ==\nUpon the full version of the song's release on 29 May 2019, the band began a solo tour across Japan titled \"\"Name of Love\" RELEASE ONE-MAN TOUR  ~RE: land=ocean~\" [sic] which lasted from 1 June to 21 July 2019, where the song was performed. The solo tour was also the first time in nearly three years the band had done a tour in a solo format, their prior most recent being \"Oneman Tour 2016 \"About Eve\"\" in 2016. Their first venue in Shibuya on 1 June sold out completely. On another tour across Japan in from 2 July to 5 November 2023 titled \"We are Phenomenal\", commemorating the band's 15 year anniversary, the song was again performed, along with their other anime song \"great escape\".\n\n\n== Chart performance ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "revision_id": 1216490098,
        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Qadištu were a class of women in ancient Mesopotamian societies. They are commonly understood as priestesses. In Babylonia they occupied a position analogous to the nadītu, and were similarly forbidden from having children, though not from marriage. They additionally acted as midwives and wet nurses. Their role in Assyria and other areas is less clear.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe term qadištu had Akkadian origin and it is derived from the root qdš, \"holy\". It can be literally translated as \"sacred woman\". While it is assumed that they fulfilled the role of priestesses, the full extent of their religious duties remains uncertain. They might have specifically been associated with the cult of Adad. They have been compared to other classes of women, such as nadītu or kulmašītu, and the distinction between them is often difficult to make. \nAccording to Marten Stol, qadištu additionally acted as midwives or wet nurses. Support for this proposal has also been voiced by authors such as Fumi Karahashi and Irene Sibbing-Plantholt. They might have also been responsible for abortions. In early scholarship, qadištu were often described as \"prostitutes\" instead, but this view is no longer accepted by modern Assyriologists.\n\n\n=== Qadištu and nugig ===\nThe Sumerogram NU.GIG could be used to write the term qadištu. Marten Stol argues that in Sumerian texts the term nugig, literally \"untouchable\", which is well attested as an epithet of deities such as Ninmah, Aruru, Inanna and Ninisina, similarly can be understood as a designation of midwives. Fumi Karahashi notes that this proposal is supported by a passage from the code of Ur-Nammu published in 2011, which explicitly places the nugig among women professionally taking care of children of other people and states that they were responsible for both help with preparations for birth and delivery and for nursing. She assumes the application of this title to Inanna might only reflect what has been described as \"aggregation of the duties and rights of all female deities\".  However, Annette Zgoll notes that as a title of deities, in particular Inanna, Nanaya and Ninisina, nugig occurs chiefly in contexts relevant to the transfer of royal power, which as she argues supports interpreting it as a generic title indicating high status. Stol also acknowledges that nugig could be more generally used as a designation of women of high status.\nZgoll argues that the use of nugig as one of the epithets of Inanna was the reason why it could be alternatively translated in Akkadian as ištarītu, \"she who belongs to Ishtar\". It has been suggested that these priestesses grew up in temples of Ishtar, but this is uncertain and their role is not well understood. It is known they were responsible for imitating bird calls for cultic purposes. A number of lexical lists explain ištarītu as Emesal gašan, \"lady\", or gašan-anna, \"lady of heaven\", rather than nugig, which Zgoll views as further evidence for nugig analogously being understood as an indicator of high status when applied to Inanna.\n\n\n== Attestations ==\n\n\n=== Babylonia ===\nQadištu are among the classes of women attested in Old Babylonian sources. One of the sections of the code of Hammurabi (§181) deals with the procedure of dedicating one's daughter to a deity to make her a qadištu (or alternatively nadītu or kulmašītu). Seals and theophoric names indicate Adad was a particularly common choice, sometimes alongside his wife Shala. A letter from Mari mentions a qadištu of Annunitum.\nMost qadištu seemingly lived alone. It is known that those associated with Adad were permitted to marry, but not to bear children. It is possible that a mythological justification for the childlessness of qadištu, as well as nadītu and kulmašītu, was provided in Atrahasis, but the relevant passage cannot be restored fully. It remains uncertain whether childlessness necessitated chastity as well. It is also known that in some cases qadištu could adopt children, as attested in the case of Ilša-ḫegal, a wife of the head lamentation singer in Old Babylonian Sippar.\nIt has been proposed that at least some qadištu were literate. However, this proposal depends on the assumption that school texts found in one of the houses excavated in Sippar which belonged to a qadištu and her brother were copied by her, which remains unproven.\nQadištu and other similar female professionals are for the most part no longer referenced in texts from the first millennium BCE. An exception are anti-witchcraft incantations, where the term qadištu is sometimes applied to opponents of the āšipu. Furthermore, lexical lists treat qadištu as interchangeable with multiple other terms, including nadītu, but also šamuḫtu (\"strumpet\") which according to Marten Stol indicates the original meaning of many cultic and professional titles was forgotten and they came to be devalued. However, Irene Sibbing-Plantholt notes that it is implausible midwifery ceased to be practiced altogether, as sometimes argued based on the decline of references to qadištu and other relevant groups.\n\n\n=== Other areas ===\nThe term qadištu is also attested in sources from Assyria, but it is unclear if it had the same meaning in this context as in Babylonia. Old Assyrian texts from Kanesh appear to treat qadištu as a designation of a man's second wife, and it is used interchangeably with the label amtu (literally \"slave girl\", here an indicator of lower status than that of the primary wife). Middle Assyrian laws state that married qadištu should wear veils, while unmarried ones are prohibited from doing so. According to Marten Stol, later Assyrian sources indicate the term was no longer understood.\nOne of the economic texts discovered during excavations in Emar deals with the purchase of a field by a woman designated as qadištu, but it is not known how this term was understood in this city.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===",

        "content": "101st Field Artillery Regiment is a reserve field artillery regiment activated in August 1941 as part of 101st Infantry Division based in Camp Casisang in Bukidnon Province. Visayas-Mindanao Force only received 8 QF 2.95inch Mountain Guns and divided it between two divisions in the island 101st and 81st in Lanao sector. The regiment retrained into fighting as infantry due to lack of guns to operate.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe regiment was organized in Camp Keithley in Lanao Province from reservist, students, and local moros. It was commanded initially by Captain Abellana during the activation but he was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Quintard while being moved to Camp Casisang in Bukidnon province. In November 1941, Quintard was ordered to transfer to Luzon to command 301st Field Artillery Regiment leaving Major Reed Graves in command.\nDue to lack of artillery guns Graves was ordered to train his regiment into fighting as infantry. It fought as an infantry during the entire Japanese invasion of Mindanao.\n\n\n=== Combat Narratives ===\n\nIn January 1942, a detachment with 4 QF 2.95inch Guns from 101st FA under Captain Manuel Acosta was dispatched to Digos Subsector to provide fire support 3/101st Infantry and 3/102nd Infantry under Lieutenant Colonel Howard Frissell who setup the new Main Line of Resistance (MLR) in Digos, Davao. They engaged Japanese forces who landed in Malalag and made Padada as its combat base. The Japanese with superior weapons, naval and air support made their progress easy. On January 12, 1942, the detachment received a direct hit from a naval gun destroying one gun and killing its commander Captain Acosta. With the order of the Visayas-Mindanao Force CG Sharp all guns are withdrawn to Bukidnon. In February 1942, 3rd Battalion 101st FA was dispatched and attached Digos SubSector to replace3/102nd Infantry. 3rd Battalion was fighting as Infantry due to lack of artillery guns to operate. In April 1 Battalion 101st Field Artillery under Lieutenant Colonel Reed Graves was dispatched to Digos to replaced 1/101st Infantry who fighting in that sector since February 1942. In April Lieutenant Colonel Reed Graves took over the command of Digos Subsector.\n2nd Battalion 101st FA was posted in Midsayap, Cotabato to prevent Japanese landing through Mindanao River. In March Lieutenant Colonel Reed Graves took over the command of Digos sector from Lieutenant Colonel John H. McGee who was suffering from Malaria.\nIn April 26, Muira detachment received reinforcements and was ordered to keep engaged for Kawaguchi to reach Kabacan. Colonel Graves repulsed these attempts twice from his prepared positions with mortars and machine guns. However, he was ordered to pullback in Kabacan as Kawaguchi detachment reached Midsayap and Pikit.\n\n\n== Surrender ==\nOn May 10, 1942 Visayas-Mindanao Force CG Major General William F. Sharp ordered all units in Visayas and Mindanao to surrender at daybreak the following day. 101st Division commander BG Joseph Vachon ordered 101st FA to surrender but LCol Graves allowed those Filipino soldiers who do not want to surrender to escape to the hills.\n\n\n=== See also ===\nVisayas-Mindanao Force\nMindanao Force\n101st Infantry Division\n101st Infantry Regiment\n102nd Infantry Regiment\n103rd Infantry Regiment\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThere were others\nBrief History of 101st Infantry Division Philippine Army",

        "content": "The Lenten veil (or Lenten cloth), known as Fastentuch in German or  velum quadragesimale in Latin is a depiction of the Passion of Christ on a large veil which covers up the chancel of the church during Lent. The Christian tradition of the Lenten veil is observed by Catholics and Lutherans.\nWhile the medieval tradition was fading away, it has made an unexpected come back in Germany since the Misereor charity revamped it in 1976, as a tool to fight against world hunger, connecting prayer and almsgiving in the spirit of Lent.\n\n\n== Liturgy ==\n\nThe Lenten cloth is usually hung in the choir (quire) throughout Lent. In some churches it is placed before Passion Sunday or Palm Sunday.\nThe veil visually separates the congregation from the chancel and its decorations and while the congregation can no longer see the liturgy, all its attention is focused on listening; it is a form of visual penance.\nThe Lenten cloth is usually hung on after Compline on the first Sunday of Lent and remains until Compline on Wednesday during Holy Week. It is withdrawn on Sundays and during special services such as ordinations, and regionally also during the elevation at Holy Mass on weekdays. Some Lenten cloths are divided in the middle and can be pulled apart on either side.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== An Eastern tradition ===\nThe origin of the Lenten veil can be linked back to the story of the Peregrinatio Aetheriae, in which the author, Egeria, narrates her journey to the Holy Land in the 4th century. In the eastern churches, the rite of the burial of Christ involved the emotional involvement of the faithful thanks to the skillful use of shrouds and painted canvases. As also stated in the Armenian lectionary, a liturgical text from the 9th century which summarizes the uses of previous centuries, in describing a ceremony in which the cross was bathed and wrapped in cloth; later this cloth was placed on the altar and offered for adoration by the faithful, like a shroud. A similar rite is also found in the Syrian and Coptic tradition.\nIn Armenian Orthodox churches to this day, the choir curtain is drawn during the entire period of Great Lent. The Divine Liturgy is celebrated out of sight of the faithful and the Eucharist is not distributed. This, as a sign of mourning and expulsion from Paradise (the first Sunday of Great Lent is aptly called \"Expulsion Sunday\").\n\n\n=== Expansion to Europe of a painted cloth ===\nAlthough only a few examples have come down to us, the practice of decorating churches with painted canvases, especially during Lent, spread to many European countries starting from the fifteenth century.\nThe book of customs or “Consuetudines” of Farfa Abbey, a Benedictine abbey close to Rome in Italy which traces itself back to Syrian origins, also provides one the earliest mentions of the Lenten veil in Europe around the year 1000. Until the 12th century, this remained a purely symbolic object made of plain fabric - often linen, also silk - which was only decorated in individual cases with ornamental embroidery. The Lenten cloth was then discovered as a form of Christian art, which remained productive for several centuries. A description from 1493 shows that a Lenten cloth with artistic depictions (no longer preserved) was created between 1126 and 1149 in the monastery of St. Ulrich and Afra in Augsburg. Appreciated for the ease of installation and the scenographic effect, the function of these canvases was to hide the altar from the beginning of Lent or Passion Sunday until Holy Wednesday or Saturday.\n\n\n=== Alpine inculturation of the Lenten patchwork in the 15th century ===\nAs the tradition expanded to the Nord, the Alpine tradition changed the materials of the Lenten veil around the 15th century. The Alpine Lenten patchwork consists of several horizontally sewn strips of solid canvas, which were already painted with tempera paints in the practice of so-called cloth painting. This created an early form of cloth painting, while the most common painting surface remained wood until the 15th century. An artistic highlight is the Lenten cloth in the Romanesque cathedral in Gurk dating back to 1458, which shows 99 individual motifs in horizontally arranged stripes. In its combination of motifs and narrative image structure, it is a typical example of sequential art. The Lenten cloth is usually a plain cloth or one made with white embroidery and also decorated with biblical images.\n\n\n=== The enrichment of the Passion veil in Northern Europe ===\nAs its moved north in Europe, the Lenten veil became more and more elaborate as early as the 12th century. The creators of Lenten cloths from Westphalia and Lower Saxony retained linen as a material and embroidery as a working technique, but changed the design by depicting individual motifs on smaller rectangles that were connected by linen bars - a patchwork carpet or textile mosaic. Occasionally, painting was also attempted on tightly stretched linen. Based on the North German tradition, motifs from the Passion of Christ gradually became established. A central theme since the 16th century was the depiction of the crucifixion of Christ; The composition of the image incorporated the Arma Christi (the instruments of Christ's suffering). This reveals a paradox between theological and artistic ideas, as the Lenten cloth had previously served to temporarily conceal the sight of the crucifix. The Marienfelder Lenten cloth became a standard Lenten  veil and served as a template for several other Lenten cloths in Münsterland in the 19th century. There are still some based on this model today in Billerbeck St. Johanni, Lüdinghausen St. Felizitas, Nordwalde St. Dionysius and Warendorf St. Laurentius.\n\n\n=== Decline after the Reformation to renewal after Vatican II ===\nIn the wake of the Protestant Reformation, Martin Luther was critical of the Lenten Veil, though as with other pre-Reformation customs, the use of the Lenten veil continued in many Lutheran congregations. However, the production and attachment of a Lenten cloth was - with a few exceptions - declined in other Lutheran areas and though it was maintained as a religious custom in Catholic areas until the 18th century, it gradually faded away. While Lenten veils had almost fallen into oblivion or become merely museum pieces by the 20th century, the tradition was unexpectedly revived in Germany in the 1970s. \nThe use of Lenten veils was uninterrupted in many localities, as in Sicily where the opening of the Lenten curtain during the Easter tradition is an established popular tradition. Also, Lenten shrouds remained a universal use of the Catholic, Lutheran and certain Anglican traditions as a form of visual penance derived from the Lenten veil.\n\n\n== Geographical variations ==\n\n\n=== Germany ===\nLenten veils, which were rather simple until then, became more ornamented tapestries as they developed in Germany and Flanders after the 12th century, In Germany, the cathedral of Our Lady of Fribourg preserves the largest Lenten veil known in Europe. Dating to 1612, it measures more than 10 by 12 meters and weighs almost one ton. The central scene of the crucifixion is surrounded by 25 squares containing various episodes of the Passion.\nIn 2007, the Catholic parish of Herz Jesu in Bernau near Berlin worked with young people to create the largest hunger cloth in the world to date in a 48-hour campaign with a “Fastentuch XXL” (over 220 m2). That same year, a Lenten cloth was hung in Bonn Cathedral for the first time, created by the Worms photographer and graphic artist Norbert Bach. It refers to the year of Elizabeth and links the history of St. Elizabeth with other works of mercy.\n\nIn 2015 there is a Lenten cloth from 1584, 195 × 135 cm, in the Church of St. Nicholas in Bad Kreuznach. The linen cloth with embroidery was mentioned as early as 1900 in a church guide to St. Nicholas written under Pastor Johann-Benedikt Kirsch. In 2016 a new Lenten cloth was created for the Evangelical Lutheran Church of the Garden Church of St. Marien in Hanover created by the textile artist Constanze Rilke. At 7 × 4 meters it shows a “sea of flowers” that refers to the gardens of the Bible and thus takes up the name of the church (Garden Church).\n\n\n=== Switzerland ===\nThe Lenten cloth of the Catholic town church of St. Martin in Rheinfelden, Switzerland (3.24 x 2.53 m) remained hidden in the church altar for over 400 years and was only discovered by chance in 1977 as part of a civil defense exercise. It is the only old Lenten cloth currently known to exist in Switzerland. However, it may be that other  paintings, such as the Sachsler meditation cloth painted by Nicholas of Flüe, were also created as a fasting cloth.\n\n\n=== Italy ===\nIn Italy, during the first quarter of the 16th century, the practice of displaying the canvas of the Passion spread among the Confraternity of the Disciplined. In Genoa, the Diocesan Museum houses a cycle of paintings from the Abbey of San Nicolò del Boschetto, dated from 1538, composed of 14 canvases dyed with indigo and painted in white lead on a monochrome background with the chiaroscuro technique; of various sizes, the largest measures 460 x 450 cm.\n\"Â calata 'a tila\" is a rite performed in Sicily which involves the sudden unveiling of the presbytery during the Easter night vigil at the pronouncement of the Gloria in excelsis Deo, to figuratively represent and show the risen Christ. It is a common rite in many parishes of the Sicilian dioceses, obsolete and recently in the process of being deliberately restored. The introduction in Sicily of the Lenten veil can be traced back to the work of the missionaries of the Teutonic Order who arrived in Palermo and Messina thanks to the will, support and consideration of Roger I of Sicily, which took place after the Norman reconquest of Sicily. In Palermo, at the Church of San Domenico of the Dominican Order, in very close relationship with the Teutonic Order, it is possible to admire during the Lenten season a monumental canvas of the Passion, one of the grandest in Italy and Europe.\nIn Sicily, this custom was highly developed from the 19th century to the beginning of the 20th, especially in the Amastratino-Madonita area (Mistretta, Gratteri, Petralia); the canvases are here called taledda or tuluni and the rite reaches its peak on Holy Saturday when the altar is revealed during the Gloria in excelsis Deo.\n\n\n=== Spain ===\nThe Lenten cloth in the church of Villoslada de Cameros in the Autonomous Region of La Rioja, created around 1560, is clearly of Flemish origin.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nMarkus Aronica: Passion in Weiß.

Despite that, they would fall in their last six games to finish the regular season 10–11, one game below .500. It is still enough for the Golden Coolers to clinch the sixth seed in the South Division.\nRizal was matched against third-seeded Sarangani, who are six games ahead, but it did not make any difference as the Golden Coolers stunned the Marlins in a Division Quarterfinals sweep. They would, however, be swept by the Batangas City Embassy Chill in the Division Semifinals.\nThe team played both of their home games this season at Ynares Center in Antipolo.\n\n\n== Preseason ==\nRizal was one of 22 teams that took part in the 2021 MPBL Invitational, competing as Rizal Emkai Xentromall.

        "content": "Model synthesis a.k.a. wave function collapse or 'wfc' are names for a family of constraint-solving algorithms commonly used in procedural generation, especially in the video game industry.\nSome video games known to have utilized variants of the algorithm include Bad North, Townscaper, and Caves of Qud.\nThe first example of this type of algorithm was described by Paul Merrell, who termed it 'model synthesis' first in his 2007 i3D paper  and also presented at the 2008 SIGGRAPH conference and his 2009 PhD thesis. The name 'wave function collapse' later became the popular name for a variant of that algorithm, after an implementation by Maxim Gumin was published in 2016 on a GitHub repository with that name. Gumin's implementation significantly popularised this style of algorithm, with it becoming widely adopted and adapted by technical artists and game developers over the following years.There were a number of inspirations to Gumin's implementation, including Merrell's PhD dissertation, ideas from quantum mechanics, and convolutional neural network style transfer. The popular name for the algorithm, 'wave function collapse', is from an analogy drawn between the algorithm's method and the concept of superposition and observation in quantum mechanics. Some innovations present in Gumin's implementation included the usage of overlapping patterns, allowing a single image to be used as an input to the algorithm.Some have speculated that the reason Gumin's implementation proved more popular than Merrell's, may have been due to the 'model synthesis' implementation's lower accessibility, its 3D focus, or perhaps the general public's computing constraints at the time.One of the differences between Merrell & Gumin's implementation and 'wave function collapse' lies in the decision of which cell to 'collapse' next. Merrell's implementation uses a scanline approach, whereas Gumin's always selects as next cell the one with the lowest number of possible outcomes.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe WFC or 'model synthesis' algorithm has some variants. Gumin and Merrell's implementations are described below, and other variants are noted:\n\n\n=== Gumin's implementation ===\nThe input bitmap is read, and the patterns present within the bitmap are counted.\nAn array is created with the dimensions of the output desired.\nEach cell of the array is initialized in an 'unobserved' state\nThe following steps are repeated:\nThe cell with the lowest number of possible output states is located\n'Collapse' this cell into one of its possible states according to the rules\nCheck that all cells are still valid and follow the rules\nOnce all cells are 'collapsed' into a definite state, return the output. If the output is illegal, discard it, and repeat the process until legal.\n\n\n=== Merrell's implementation ===\nMerrell's earlier implementation is substantially the same as Gumin's with some minor differences. \n(1) In Merrell's version, there is no requirement to select the cell with the lowest number of possible output states for collapse. Instead, a scanline approach is adopted. According to Merrell, this results in a lower failure rate of the model without any negative effect on quality. Some commentators have noted however that the scanline approach to 'collapse' tends to result in directional artifacts.(2) Merrell's approach performs the algorithm in chunks, rather than all-at-once. This approach greatly reduces the failure rate for many large complex models; especially in a 3D space.\n\n\n== Developments ==\nIn April 2023 Shaad Alaka and Rafael Bidarra of Delft University proposed 'Hierarchical Semantic wave function collapse'. Essentially, the algorithm is modified to work beyond simple, unstructured sets of tiles. Prior to their work, all WFC algorithm variants operated on a flat set of tile choices per cell.Their generalised approach organizes tile-sets into a hierarchy, consisting of abstract nodes called 'meta-tiles', and terminating nodes called 'leaf tiles'. For example, on the first pass, WFC might make a certain tile a meta-tile of 'castle' type; which on a second pass will be collapsed into other tiles based on a rule, e.g. a 'wall' or 'grass' tile.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nhttps://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse",

        "content": "Plas Machen is a country house in the hamlet of Lower Machen, to the west of the city of Newport, Wales. The house was the ancestral home of the Morgan family of South Wales prior to their construction of Tredegar House. It is a Grade II* listed building. The gardens are listed at Grade II on the Cadw/ICOMOS Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales. A pair of cottages in the grounds of the house are also listed at Grade II. The house remains a private residence and is not open to the public.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Morgans of Machen and Tredegar ===\nThe earliest recorded link between the Morgan family of South Wales and Machen is to the building of Plas Machen by \"Morgan of Machen who led men of Gwent at Bosworth in 1485\". In the following centuries, the family became one of the wealthiest and most powerful in South Wales. In the 1660s Sir William Morgan (c.1640-1680) rebuilt Tredegar House as the centrepiece of the family's estates in Monmouthshire, Glamorganshire and Brecknockshire. In the 19th century, Sir Charles Morgan was created Baron Tredegar, and in the early 20th century, his son Godfrey was elevated in the peerage as Viscount Tredegar. The viscountcy was revived for his nephew, Courtenay Morgan, in 1926. but became extinct on the death of Courtenay's son, Evan in 1949, after which the family's landholdings in South Wales were sold.\n\n\n=== Plas Machen ===\nThe Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales gives building dates for Plas Machen as the \"15th, 16th, 17th centur[ies] and later\". Cadw suggests that the house reached its greatest extent in the 1600s, before being superseded by Tredegar House as the family's main residence. It was much reduced in size in the 19th century, before restoration by Habershon and Pite in 1859. The Morgans retained ownership, although they ceased to live at the house by around 1800. The house, and some associated barns, were restored in the 21st century.\n\n\n== Architecture and description ==\nThe house is built of rubble stone with brick chimney stacks. Archdeacon Coxe saw the house when it was still complete during a visit in 1800 and recorded his impressions in his two-volume, An Historical Tour in Monmouthshire. Of the interior, Coxe noted a circular room devoted to hunting, with a ceiling centrepiece of the goddess Diana and decorative scenes depicting important local houses and churches, together with hunting images. This was located in part of the house subsequently demolished. The gardens retain their Tudor skeleton, with a series of terraces and axes leading down to a fish pond. While the outline of the formal gardens remains, much has now been returned to pasture.\nPlas Machen is a Grade II* listed building.\nIts gardens and grounds are listed at Grade II on the Cadw/ICOMOS Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales. A pair of cottages also have a Grade II listing.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "Rozhen is a mountain pass (saddle) in southern Bulgaria in the central part of the Perelik-Prespa division of the Western Rhodopes in the Smolyan Municipality, Smolyan District. \nThe pass is 11.2 kilometres (7.0 mi) long, and the altitude of the saddle is 1,436 metres (4,711 ft). It connects the valley of the Chepelarska Reka (right tributary of the Maritsa) in the northwest with the valley of the Byala Reka (left tributary of the Luda Reka and part of the Arda basin) in the southeast. It starts at 1350 m above sea level. west of the village of Progled, at the junction for the Pamporovo resort, and heads southeast, up the slope of the Pereliksko-Prespa division of the Western Rhodopes. After 3.2 km, it climbs to the saddle at 1436 m above sea level, from where a dark and many-turning descent along the south-eastern slope of the ridge begins. After 8 km (5 mi), it descends to the village of Sokolovtsi, where it ends at 1,046 metres (3,432 ft) above sea level. \nThe saddle is occupied by extensive meadows and pastures, surrounded by flat ridges overgrown with coniferous vegetation. From a geomorphological point of view, it is of karst origin; its base is made of marbleized limestone, and it is a drainless marble karst valley. The powerful Western Rhodope Hills, Chernatitsa and Radyuva Planina, diverge from it in the northwest and north directions. \nSince ancient times, the saddle has been an important passage between the Upper Thracian lowland and the valley of the Arda River and the White Sea. Now a section of 11.2 kilometres (7.0 mi) (from km 85.9 to km 97.1) of the second-class Republic Road II-86 Plovdiv-Smolyan-Rudozem border crossing passes through the pass (the last part of the project). To the left of the saddle, from the northeast comes the last section of the third-class Republican road III-861 from Yugovsko Hanche, the city of Lucky, and the village of Jurkovo. Due to the important transport and economic importance of the pass, the road through it is maintained year-round for the passage of motor vehicles. \nOn the meadows of the saddle in the past, folklore assemblies were regularly held, which have been resumed for several years (the last edition was held in July 2016). The largest Bulgarian observatory was built on Sveti Duh peak, north of the saddle. It has several telescopes, the largest of which has a diameter of 2 metres (6 ft 7 in).\n\n\n== Miscellaneous ==\nRozhensky Prohod is the name given to a street in the \"Strelbishte\" district in Sofia\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Rubber Nipple Salesmen is the 5th episode of the second season of The Ren & Stimpy Show that originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on 29 August 1992.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nRen and Stimpy have gone to work as a door-to-door salesmen pushing the unlikely product of rubber nipple coverings. Stimpy and Ren disagree about the purposes of their work. In a parody of the 1963 \"I Have a Dream\" speech by Martin Luther King Jr., Stimpy says he has a dream where every American man and woman will be wearing rubble nipple coverings, which he believes will somehow improve the world. Ren by contrast only wants to sell rubber nipple coverings to become rich. At their first house, Ren pushes Stimpy out of the way and goes to the door, only to have his head smashed in by the psychotic Fire Chief who mistook Ren for the dreaded circus midgets whom the Fire Chief hates. At their second house, Mr. Horse answers the door along with a walrus and is notably nervous. It is strongly implied that Mr. Horse is a sexual predator who has kidnapped the walrus and is now molesting him as the walrus begs Ren and Stimpy to call the police. At the third house, Ren and Stimpy are allowed in by the perpetually clueless couple Mr. Pipe and Mrs. Pipe. Ren and Stimpy demonstrate a variety of impractical uses for the rubber nipple coverings and are rewarded when both Mr. and Mrs. Pipe agreeing to buy the coverings, and then immediately expel Ren and Stimpy from their house.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRen-voice of John Kricfalusi.\nStimpy-voice of Billy West\nMrs. Pipe-voice of Cheryl Chase\nMr. Pipe-voice of Billy West\nFire Chief-voice of Harris Peet\nMr. Horse-voice of John Kricfalusi\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe idea for the episode came from the showrunner John Kricfalusi and Vincent Waller, one of the writers at the  Spümcø studio. The network executive Will McRobb gave his approval for the episode despite its risque content, but insisted on removing \"all the bits of innuendo John would pretend weren't innuendo\". The production of Rubber Nipple Salesmen moved forward slowly at the Spümcø owning largely to the perfectionism of Kricfalusi. The artists on the lay-out stage complained that it took four weeks for Kricfalusi to give his approval as he wanted every frame to be perfect. Much of the drawings along the illustrating the episode was done at the Rough Draft Korea studio in Seoul. David Koenigsberg of the Spümcø studio stated that Rough Draft Korea was an inexperienced studio, which was reflected in their work as he stated: \"When we tried to have them animate for digital in-and-paint and camera in Hollywood, they could not follow one simple rule: never trace a line. There's no need to for digital. We had to fix scene after scene\".\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe American journalist  Rachel Llewellyn wrote that Rubber Nipple Salesmen was a product of the \"bizarro world\" of Kricfalusi's mind. She wrote that the sexual abuse allegations against Kricfalusi that came out in 2018 as it revealed that he had used his celebrity as the showrunner to have sex with teenage girls who were fans of his TV show tainted her enjoyment of the show. The American journalist Victoria Vouloumanos wrote that the scene with the walrus whom it is clearly implied is being sexually molested by Mr. Horse was one of the more disturbing scenes in American animation. made worse by the fact that the scene was played for laughs.\n\n\n== Books and articles ==\nDobbs, G.

        "content": "William Hoile Brown (sometimes named as William Hoyle Brown) was a shipbuilder in Auckland from 1864 to 1918 and a local politician.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nHe was born in a Martello tower at  Dymchurch, Kent to Stephen Cain and Elizabeth Brown, on 4 May 1838 and went to Greenwich Hospital School. His siblings were George Hoile, Sarah Heywood, and Elizabeth Brown. There are two versions of the next part of his life. Either in 1850, aged 12, he went to California with an uncle, or in 1855 he went with his father. At Samoa he was on the American barque Elvira when it was wrecked, whilst on a trip to Australia. He was marooned for several weeks, until taken to Sydney by a son of the missionary, John Williams. The 1926 version of Brown's life story says he came to Auckland in 1854, was met by his father, who had also come to settle and served 3 years in the militia during the New Zealand Wars, in Captain Clark's company, building redoubt at Pūkorokoro / Miranda, for which he was awarded a medal. Alternately, towards the end of 1855 he may have come in shipbuilder Henry Niccol's Moa, served a seven-year apprenticeship in his shipyard and then, presumably in 1862, volunteered for the wars. The latter fits better with the date of the war and the redoubt.\n\n\n== Shipbuilding ==\nEither way, he then partnered with another apprentice, John Sims as Sims and Brown, until 1890, after which he continued as a sole trader. Their first yard was on the North Shore, where, from February to June 1865, they built their first vessel, Telegraph, a 30 ton cutter. They added a yard at the foot of Princes Street. Later yards were at Devonport, near the foot of Hobson Street and in Poore Street, now Westhaven Drive, on the western reclamation. He built nearly fifty craft, including -\n\nColonist schooner 1868\nFalcon, barquentine for Watt Brothers, Napier\nLeading Wind\nManaroa for Captain Cross\nDaphne steamer for A.J. Farmer, Kawau\nNoko, a pioneer in the Auckland-Gisborne trade\nGemini, a steamer and other boats for Captain Jeremiah Casey (1820–1881)\nabout 13 sailers, schooners, barques and barquentines for the island trading firm of Donald and Edenborough\nSovereign and Lady Wynyard, which won schooner races at Anniversary Day regattas\nOnewa steamer\nTiroa steamer.\n\n\n== Local government ==\nFrom 1863 he lived on the North Shore, where he was a Member of the Devonport Highway Board from 1876, until it merged into Devonport Borough Council in 1886. He was on it until 1894 and remained a member of Devonport Domain Board until at least 1902. Brown also represented the Council on Auckland Harbour Board for several years. He was largely responsible for Devonport having a promenade from the dock to North Head, ensured that its streets were a chain wide and properly formed before they were handed over and supported pumping water from Pupukemoana to a reservoir on Mount Victoria. He was president of the Master Shipbuilders’ Federation for many years, a Freemason Past Master and, for over thirty years, superintendent of the Church of England Devonport Sunday school.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nBrown married Annie Binns on 24 October 1861. He was survived by her and their children - Walter, Frederick, Harold Brown, Mrs. T. Farquharson, Mrs. (Captain) Richards, Mrs. E. Pike, all of Auckland, Mrs. (Captain) Hardy, of Dunedin, 23 grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Johann Otto Stammann (December 11, 1835, Hamburg – February 7, 1909, Hamburg) was a Hamburg lawyer, senator, and mayor.\n\n\n== Family ==\nStammann's father was a doctor in Hamburg, and his uncle was the Hamburg architect Franz Georg Stammann. After studying law and receiving his doctorate in Heidelberg in 1857, he was enrolled as a lawyer in Hamburg on April 23, 1858. He was registered as a lawyer until 1886. In 1867, he married Bertha Schlüter, whose grandfather, David Schlüter, was mayor of Hamburg from 1835 to 1843. The lawyer Alfred Otto Stammann was his son.\nOn September 22, 1886, Stammann was elected to the Senate to replace the late Hermann Anthony Cornelius Weber. He was a member of this until his death in 1909. He worked for various authorities, such as the secondary school authority, the emigration department, and the medical college. In 1900, he was police chief. In 1906, Stammann was elected second mayor, and the following year, he was elected first mayor of Hamburg. Because he became seriously ill at the end of 1908, he was not re-elected mayor in 1909, contrary to tradition.\nHis funeral led to a public dispute because, in accordance with the constitution, he was buried like a simple senator without a church ceremony; two senators were present. Many felt that since he had been a former mayor, he was entitled to a state funeral.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Diocesan Shrine and Parish Church of Saint Nicholas Tolentine, commonly known as Mariveles Church, is a Roman Catholic church located in Mariveles, Bataan, Philippines. The church is dedicated to the Italian saint Nicholas of Tolentino. The Augustinian Recollects missionaries constructed the first church in 1729. It belongs to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Balanga (Vicariate of St. Michael the Archangel). Since June 5, 2023, Fr. Regin L. Tenorio is the Rector and Parish Priest of the church.\nThe parish church's feast day is September 10 and Catholic population is 36,282.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe parish's current structure was started by the late Msgr. Antonio Tony S. Dumaual and finished construction by Fr. Josue V. Enero. When the current structure was finished, the facade has brown bricks design, multi-colored rectangular stained glasses, and a door with large alpha and omega symbols.\nTo celebrate the Great Jubilee in 2000, the parish church's doors was changed to the one with the Jubilee 2000 logo under the leadership of Fr. Abraham SP. Pantig. A statue of Jesus Christ and its pedestal was also added creating a rotonda at the church's exterior. Also, the bricks design part was added with white paint.\nDuring the leadership of Fr. Percival V. Medina, the church's-stained glass was changed to the one depicting St. Nicholas with people in hellfire, a Bataan Death March marker, and the church itself.\nOn September 9, 2005, under the tenure of the then newly appointed rector and parish priest Msgr. Hipolito Araña, Mariveles celebrated the 276th anniversary of Apo Kolas, the Patron Saint of Mariveles — San Nicolas de Tolentino, who arrived in this town through the Order of Augustinian Recoletos missionaries. Thus, the parish was founded in 1729 bearing the name of the saint. The floor at the left and right side was smoothened by placing a white smooth flooring over their rough surface. It was also during Araña's tenure that the stations of the cross on a frame were bought and the projector used to display the presentation was changed into the one connecting into a laptop. In 2008, the former wall at the right side of an altar was removed moving a choir loft to its current location and a part where the loft was formerly located is now occupied by chairs used by worshippers while at the left was to give way for more space of chairs and the former St. Nicholas Catholic School of Mariveles when it was under the supervision of the parish was now the room for saints and Our Lady of Perpetual Help, and its facade and the sacristy was painted with yellow.\nUnder the leadership of Msgr. Hernando Guanzon in late 2010, the statue of Jesus Christ was moved at the left side of the church and its pedestal added during Pantig's tenure as rector and parish priest near the church's facade was removed, restoring the church's spacious outside. An iron fence was also added at the front of a church. At its interior, walls at the left side of an altar was restored to give way for a sacristy.\nChanges to the parish church during Fr. Felizardo Sevilla's term from June 5, 2011, to June 5, 2017, are the lecterns were changed to wood and became movable, facade became pink in late 2012 which is its current color since then, tiles were added on the floor of the church's interior, gates at the left and right side of the church were changed, ceiling fan was added which removed the two chandeliers, retablo became wood, and ceiling above the altar was changed and added a design.\nOn February 25, 2023, under Santos' leadership, it was declared as a diocesan shrine and later that year under Fr. Regin Tenorio's tenure, its logo as a shrine was revealed. Renovation of the sacristy, and addition of stained-glass featuring St. Nicholas and design at the ceiling's brown part were made. The renovated sacristy was blessed on September 5, 2023, during the 5th day of Novena for the patron saint's feast day on September 10 by the Archbishop of San Fernando, Pampanga and Apostolic Administrator of the Diocese of Balanga Florentino Lavarias.\nIn 2024, the parish church's fence was changed as proposed by the former Bishop of Balanga and acting rector and parish priest Ruperto Santos.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Saint Nicholas of Tolentine Church (Mariveles, Bataan) at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "The Bohorodytska Fortress (Ukrainian: Богородицька фортеця, romanized: Bohorodytsʹka fortetsya) or Novobohorodytska Fortress is a 17th-century retrenchment of the Cossack Hetmanate on the right bank of the Samara River. During the Russian Empire's battle for access to the Black and Azov Seas, as well as the new Zaporizhzhia subordinate, the fort became a crucial outpost. According to contemporary experts, the fortress has a far longer history because it was built where the old Cossack town of Samar formerly stood rather than starting from scratch.\n\n\n== Design ==\nThe primary elements used for reinforcement were wood and earth: a 4 metres (13 ft) shaft, a wide and deep ditch measuring 6 × 3 meters, and a palisade including 17 cannons. A wooden chapel was named after the Intercession of the Most Holy Theotokos, was erected inside its rectangular layout on 23 April 1688. Its state garrison was supposed to include 4,491 troops, spearmen, and reiters, not including various officers, there were only 4,014 individuals. The fort covered an area of about 10 hectares (25 acres) and had a perimeter of over 1,300 metres (4,300 ft). They were positioned and fortified around the citadel with a 3500 m-long moat and rampart. Additionally, bridges made from nadolbs and wooden piles were constructed. The stronghold is referred to as a marvel of Ukrainian fortification art because of its unique design, which makes it resemble a turtle when viewed from above.\n\n\n== History ==\nTwo fortresses were constructed in the same area, according to the surviving documents and evidence of the period. The first was named Bohorodytska (Novobohorodytska) Fortress, and the second was named Novosergievskaya. They were both designed and constructed by William von Zalen, a foreign engineer-colonel who worked for the Moscow government. On the right bank of the Samara River, Bohorodytska Fortress began construction on 22 July [O.S. 12] 1687 by the orders of Dmitry Golitsyn. A garrison of 500 soldiers was stationed and where the remnants of the ramparts are still partially preserved. Early August 1688 saw the completion of the work, which had started in the spring in March.The Bohorodytska Fortress was designated as a base for Russian soldiers fighting the Crimean Khanate, a tool of Moscow's power over the seized land, and a warning to the erratic Cossacks. Hetman Ivan Mazepa assembled his troops, accompanied them to the town of Goltva, and dispatched a separate corps to defend the citadel in response to the prospect of an invasion by the Crimean Khan Selim I Giray on the territories of Ukraine in the winter of 1690.A disease struck Zaporozhye in early April of that year and persisted throughout the summer. The officers and the bulk of the soldiers at the fort perished or escaped to the nearby countryside, and half of the nearby city burned down. After learning of this, the Hetman gave the order to replace them with the same number of Cossacks from the Myrhorod regiment and to dispatch 1,000 Cossacks from the Poltava regiment to guard the citadel and the tsarist treasure.The citadel was essentially reconstructed in 1691 when Petro Ivanenko, his Cossacks, and 500 Tatars attempted to take it on 31 July 1692. The Cossacks and Tatars advanced on the lower city, taking numerous courtyards and two towers on fire while capturing a number of hives and a hundred sheep. However, at this point, the garrison of the citadel opened fire on them with guns, forcing the them to withdraw.During the Bulavin Rebellion in 1708, the Cossacks and Kondraty Bulavin followers failed to storm the fortification. Khan Selim II Giray assaulted the fort in 1711, and later the Treaty of the Pruth with Turkey destroyed it. Under the direct supervision of Hetman, the governor general of Kyiv, and with the presence of Pasha, the Turkish representative, the fort was demolished in September. The stronghold was rebuilt by General Count von Weisbach after 1731 and was known as the Samara Retrenchment in 1736. Following restoration, the fortress's perimeter was expanded to 17,000 metres (56,000 ft). During Russia's battle with the Crimean Horde in 1735–1739, the defenses were included into the Ukrainian line.By royal proclamation of Catherine II, Novorossiya's fortresses were completely decommissioned in 1783. The Intercession Church, which was housed in the citadel, was disassembled and moved to the settlement of Odinkovka, which was situated on the other side of the Samara River, in 1798. The city's and the fortress's existence is over. Since then, German colonists have tilled the ground on the site of the ancient fortification, using it for the gardens of the Shevchenko village's citizens.By a decision passed by the Cabinet of Ministers in 2001, the Bohorodytska Fortress was designated as a historically significant monument of national significance. On the grounds of Samara, archeological excavations started in the same year. In the 1,686 square metres (18,150 sq ft) of the examined area, almost 10,000 items were found. Funding is scarce, thus archeological study is done sporadically. The monument has not yet been a part of any local or regional initiatives.A list of antiquities, which comprised 2,200 findings on the fortress grounds, was released by scientists as early as 2007. The inventory and subsequent discoveries of seals, trade seals, pear crosses, buttons from garments, plates, and other domestic goods, jewelry, money from the 14th–18th centuries, weapons and other artifacts attested to the settlement's antiquity on the margins of the Bohorodytska Fortress. On the site of the stronghold, there are presently archeological digs and Cossack festivities.From 24 to 25 August 2018 is when the Samar Dnipro Fest, an event that blends historical recreation, a medieval competition, and a music performance, takes place at the Bohorodytska Fortress.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

It was preceded by the release of the lead single \"Oh Hi\" on 8 February 2024.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe band produced the album with Steven Schram, with frontman Neil Finn stating that the band wanted to maintain a \"dreamy quality\" on the record yet be more \"lyrically direct\". Lead single \"Oh Hi\" was inspired by Finn's work for the nonprofit organisation So They Can, which builds schools in remote areas of Kenya and Tanzania. Finn named the album after a stone staircase near a place he vacations, which he compared to his mentality as a musician, calling the title a \"metaphor for getting a little older and becoming aware of your own mortality, your own physicality\" as there is \"more determination needed to get to the top, but there's still the same compulsion to climb\". The cover art is a pastiche of the Beatles' 1966 album Revolver.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "John Zupan (c. 1945–August 29, 2011) was the founder of an American independent grocery store chain called Zupan's Markets in Oregon. Established in 1975, the store continues to operate in Portland nearly 50 years later, operated by his son, Mike Zupan.\n\n\n== Career ==\nHe started working in the produce business at age 16, as a produce clerk at Sheridan Fruit Company, Inc., in Southeast Portland, followed by Corno's Food Market. For 11 years, he worked at Fred Meyer, eventually serving as produce district manager, and worked personally with eponymous grocer Fred G. Meyer, a major influence. \nAt age 30, Zupan and his coworker Chuck Gaylord bought Zim's grocery store near Gresham, Oregon. After selling his share of the business, Zupan went on to operate ThriftWay and Food Pavilion stores, before finally opening his first Zupan's Market in Burnside. He opened his fourth Zupan's Market store in Raleigh Hills in 1996. At the time, Zupan's Markets was an Oregon corporation with administrative offices in Washington. Zupan was well known for his unique skill in presenting fresh produce to consumers.\nZupan handed his business over to his son Michael in 2000, although he remained involved in the business. Even after his son took the helm, the stores were designed not to distract from fresh food. At the time of his death in 2011, the store was known as an upscale gourmet grocery store chain.\n\n\n== Personal life and legacy ==\nZupan's hobby was vintage cars and motorcycles. For many years, Zupan's Markets sponsored an annual vintage car race on Portland International Speedway. He was also part owner of an indoor soccer team. \nIn 2011, John Zupan died aged 66 in a hit-and-run motorcycle accident. When he died, Ron McKnight, former president of the Northwest Grocers Association, called him \"a grocery store maverick, an innovator, a visionary\".\n\n\n== References ==",

In Langley, British Columbia, at the 2022 Canadian Track and Field Championships, Hamilton earned a bronze medal despite throwing of just 67.91 m, his shortest performance of the year up to that point. \nHamilton qualified to compete at the 2022 World Athletics Championships in Eugene, Oregon. Making his world championship debut, he failed to advance from the qualifying round, posting a best throw of 74.02 m. Just a few weeks later, he competed at the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, placing 9th with a throw of 67.76 m. He ended his year by competing at the NACAC Championships in Freeport, Bahamas. There he earned a bronze medal, just edging out fellow Canadian Adam Keenan for a spot on the podium by just 12 centimeters with a throw of 74.36 m to Keenan's 74.24 m.\n\n\n==== 2023 ====\nOn 24 May 2023, Hamilton defended his NAIA title in Marion, Indiana with a throw of 71.97 m. His next competition came a month later in Rathdrum, Idaho where he managed a personal best of 76.80 m. At the Canadian Championships, he threw a mark of 72.81 m, placing second to Ethan Katzberg.\nAt the 2023 World Athletics Championships in Budapest, Hungary, Hamilton once again failed to advance from the qualifying round, his furthest throw reaching 74.14 m. \n\n\n=== University of California, Berkeley ===\n\n\n==== 2024 ====\nWith one year of college athletic eligibility remaining, Hamilton decided to enroll at the University of California, Berkeley to compete for the California Golden Bears. \nIn his Bear debut and his first ever indoor meet at the Don Kirby Invitational in Albuquerque, New Mexico, he broke the Cal school record in the weight throw with a mark of 21.98 m, shattering the previous mark by over 2 metres. Two weeks later he improved upon that mark with a throw of 22.36 in Seattle. That performance qualified him for the 2024 NCAA Division I Indoor Track and Field Championships in Boston, becoming the first Cal male thrower to do so. At the championship, he placed 12th with a throw of 21.52 m, earning All-American honours.\n\n\n== Competition record ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The idea of Burden of Knowledge has been around for a long time.\n\n\n== Scholarship ==\nExplicit scholarship of this idea has entered the mainstream with the works of Benjamin Jones (economist), in particular The Burden of Knowledge and the Death of the Renaissance Man, and with the works of \nJan Brendel and Sascha Schweitzer The Burden of Knowledge in Mathematics.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nTheory and empirical studies reflect the case that researchers and innovators are not born with the required expertise and must first undertake education. With accumulating information and discoveries, the time to digest and improve on extant knowledge takes longer. Similarly, frontiers of knowledge advance at an overall increasing rate and are shifting over time. The “burden of knowledge” refers to the difficulty of catching up with this evolving knowledge frontier.\nA hard metric used by Brendel and Schweitzer for mathematics burden is age at first publication. They specifically point to \"a significant increase of the average age of researchers at their first publication in one of our top-ranking journals.\"\nFindings associated with Burden of Knowledge investigations point to declining productivity in sole researchers and developers and increasing productivity by teams. Prominent examples of highly effective team research in basic science include those of Nobel Prize awardees Francis Crick and James Watson's work on DNA structure, Yang Chen-Ning and Tsung-Dao Lee's work on parity violation, and Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman's mRNA vaccine discoveries and development [1])\nResearch also point to better outcomes in gender diverse teams. Interestingly, research points to better development by large teams and more R&D novelty and disruption by small teams.\nChristian Turner (Professor of Law) uses the term BURDEN OF KNOWLEDGE in a different way, referring to situations where one may be better off not knowing things, for example avoiding painful and uncomfortable details of ones health.\n\n\n== Burden of Knowledge Challenges in other areas ==\nChallenges due to increasing complexity and data are found in other fields. There are observed productivity challenges in pharmaceutical drug discovery R&D. The challenges also manifest in an overall trend of patents, papers, and discoveries being less disruptive.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Patrick \"Paddy\" Cahill (c. 1863 – 4 February 1923) was a buffalo hunter, farmer and protector of Aborigines in the Northern Territory.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nCahill was born in around 1863 in Laidley, Queensland and was the son of Thomas and Sarah Cahill. His father was a blacksmith and his birth was not registered. \nCahill moved to the Northern Territory in 1883 when he and his brothers (Tom and Matt) joined Nathaniel Buchanan overlanding (droving) 20,000 cattle from western Queensland to Wave Hill Station; he and his brothers then stayed on to manage the station and later Delamere Station and Gordon Downs Station as well. During this time Cahill was involved in the Wave Hill Massacre/s that took place in the early 1920s and a informant stated that he had been called over in about 1924 to deal with cattle killers. He was recorded as having shot over thirty people.\nSoon after Cahill became aware of 60,000 water buffalo in the Alligator River floodplains, near Darwin, and entered into a partnership with William Johnson to shoot them for their hides and horns. They employed groups of Aboriginal people to assist them and hunted primarily in the Dry Season in semi-mobile camps throughout the region. During this period he is credited as being one of the first to shoot buffalo from horseback and much of his success has been attributed to his horse St Lawrence who was considered particularly fast and intelligent.\nFrom December 1898 to March 1899 Cahill wrote a series of seven newspaper articles, entitled \"In the Northern Territory buffalo country\" for the Northern Territory Times and Gazette. While visiting Darwin in 1898 he also met with Banjo Paterson and spoke to him of the main topics of interest in the town and Paterson later wrote about him, and their meeting, in The Bulletin. This article stated of Cahill:\n\nHe is popularly reported to pursue the infuriated buffalo at full gallop, standing on his saddle, and dressed in a towel and a diamond ring, and yelling like a wild Indian\nEarly in 1899, when there was a downturn in profits buffalo hunting, Cahill purchased a pearling lugger Ethel. Later that year, on 18 October, he married Maria Pickford at St Mary's Star of the Sea Cathedral in Darwin. Within three weeks of their wedding Cahill travelled more then 300kms to assist his partner, Johnston, who had been gored by a buffalo.\nIn 1906 Cahill and Johnston settled in Oenpelli (Gunbalanya) where, with the help of Gaagudju people, they established a farm where they grew fruit, vegetables, sisal, cotton and other products. Cahill was known to have a deep interest and empathy with the Gaagudju people and he soon learned to speak many of the Aboriginal languages of the region and was always careful to use tribal names. \nIn 1912 Cahill was appointed Protector of Aborigines for the Alligator River and in June 1912 was visited by Walter Baldwin Spencer. Spencer was very impressed with him and was surprised that he had gained entry to sacred and secret rituals and, following this visit, Cahill became Spencer’s ‘major anthropological correspondent’, and a major informant for Spencer’s Native Tribes of the Northern Territory of Australia (1914). Cahill also supplied the National Museum of Victoria with zoological specimens and a collection of over 100 bark paintings which he added to those already donated by Spencer. This collection became known as the Spencer-Cahill collection and it was instrumental in establishing a perception of Aboriginal art in Australia.\nAlso based of this visit Spencer recommended a 6,000 square km reserve, the Alligator River Reserve, be formed around Cahill’s lease, with Cahill and Maria appointed to run the reserve. Cahill planned to employ Aboriginal people to work under 'European' supervision and establish a wide range of experimental crops (including tobacco) and run a cattle and dairy herd. In 1915 their first shipment of butter was boycotted by Darwin unionists because it was produced by 'black labour' with concerns being raised about the ethics of its production. In 1917 there was a poisoning attempt on Cahill by Aboriginal workers; three men were arrested and taken to Darwin, two of these men were sentenced to six months imprisonment by the magistrate and the other, the supposed ringleader, had to await the next sitting of the Northern Territory Supreme Court.\nThis venture was, ultimately, a failure due to financial mismanagement and staffing difficulties, however, it was finally ended by the Spanish flu outbreak there in 1919 in which Cahill and Maria both almost died. Cahill also had major political difficulties at this time due to his friendship with John Anderson Gilruth, for which he was viewed as being on the 'wrong side' of the Darwin rebellion and called before the Ewing Royal Commission. In his report Hon. Norman Kirkwood Ewing found that he was \"a decent man but sometimes careless\"; it was also implied that he used his friendship with Gilruth to advance his son.\nAfter the Inquiry, in 1920, Cahill's lease was officially proclaimed an Aboriginal Reserve and, in 1924, after he and his family had left the area it was transferred into the control of the Church Missionary Society and was renamed Oenpelli Mission.\nIn 1922 Cahill travelled to the Melbourne Cup with his wife and son. During this visit he became unwell, with a bout of influenza, and insisted on been taken to the home of his brother Tom in Sydney. He died there on 4 February 1923 and he is buried at Randwick cemetery.\n\n\n== References ==",

In 193 BC, he served as aedile. In 191 BC, he dedicated the Temple of Cybele. In 178 BC, Brutus was elected consul together with Aulus Manlius Vulso. Brutus fought against the Ligurians, then helped his colleague, who was fighting in Histria. Both consuls continued to fight against Histria in the following year. In 169 BC, Brutus unsuccessfully ran as a candidate for censor. In 164 BC, he was sent as an ambassador to King Ariathes V to settle his war with the Galatians.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Henry J. Friendly Medal is an award given periodically by the American Law Institute (ALI) in recognition of outstanding contributions to the field of law. It is named in honor of Judge Henry Friendly of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The medal is conferred to an individual for their contributions \"in the tradition of Judge Friendly.\" \nThe award is reserved to some of the most influential modern jurists, including Judge Merrick Garland, and U.S. Supreme Court Justices Anthony Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and John Roberts. It is the most prestigious award given by the ALI.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Friendly Medal was established by Judge Friendly's former law clerks after his death. Friendly had been a member of the American Law Institute's council. The medal initially featured a likeness of Friendly smiling, but was changed as the judge rarely smiled.  It is given by the American Law Institute Awards Committee.\n\n\n== Prize ==\nThe medal is only awarded as appropriate and not on an annual basis. The award has been described as \"prestigious\" and \"reserved for recipients who are considered especially worthy of receiving it.\" It is one of the highest honors given by the ALI, and is not limited to the organization's members. In 1992, Judge Michael Boudin of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit was the chair of the awarding committee. After it was established, Edward Weinfeld, a close friend of Judge Friendly, traveled in person to be the first to receive the award before dying a day later.\n\n\n== Recipients ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Additional sources ===\nDorsen, David M.

        "content": "The Church of St. Catherine (Ukrainian: Кірха Святої Катерини, romanized: Kirkha Svyatoyi Kateryny) is a 19th-century Evangelical Lutheran church of the German Evangelical-Lutheran Church in the Ukraine (GELCU) in Dnipro, Ukraine. Additionally, it is also called the Evangelical Lutheran Church of St. Catherine. It is the first church to be opened in independent Ukraine. It's on Karl Marx Avenue, next to the Maxim Gorki Theater and Lazar Hloba Park.\n\n\n== Design ==\nThe church was built in the early Gothic architecture, with late Baroque features to enhance its appeal. It is now has an interior design that is opulent, with altar pieces with crucifixes, exquisite icons, sophisticated saint plaster statues, items of devotion, and books with stylish bindings. Images from evangelical life were painted on the church's walls and ceilings.\n\n\n== History ==\nEarly in the development of the German community in the second half of the 18th century, the first Lutheran evangelists relocated to the settlement in the Katerynoslav Oblast. The oldest Lutheran village dates back to 1789 and was known as Josefstal. It is located in what is now the Dnipro Oblast of Samarivka, and it was about 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) from Katerynoslav.\nAt the cost of the city's German Lutheran population, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of St. Catherine was founded in Katerynoslav (present day Dnipro) in 1852. In 1861, a plot of land was bought to construct a church. The actual building process started in 1865, and it was consecrated in 1866. At the building, a Lutheran charity for impoverished people as well as a school were established.\n\nIn 1866, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of St. Catherine was constructed using funds donated by the locals. The neighborhood helped to reopen it after the city officials had shuttered it several times. The church continued to function for precisely fifty years, closing its doors in 1933 due to the USSR anti-religious campaign, with the school closing its doors in 1938.\nThis building was then converted into an archive and library for foreign book collection during the Soviet era. The structure was then abandoned for a long period of time. Following these examinations, the church was placed in an emergency. The structure was given to the Dnipropetrovsk Revival Society in 1990, and they began a comprehensive restoration of the church. Munich and Dnipropetrovsk architects created the repair plan. Only in 1991 did the services get back on track.\nThe vigorous efforts of the Widergeburt Society of Ethnic Germans in 1991 allowed the Lutheran religious community in Dnipro to resume its operations. Igor Yermolaev served as the first pastor of the church until 1994, when Gotthald Hyunke took over. On 24 October 1994, the church was fully restored and refurbished, and it was reopened. Igor Taranenko was the priest of the Church of St. Catherine from 1996 until 2009. Moreover, Serhii Mashevskyi, who was elected bishop of the  German Evangelical-Lutheran Church in the Ukraine in 2013, served from 2008 to 2013.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "Up on Gravity Hill is the fifth studio album by Canadian punk rock band Metz. It was released on April 12, 2024, through Sub Pop. Produced by the band themselves, it features vocal contributions from Amber Webber on the final track.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nUp on Gravity Hill was met with universal acclaim from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 84, based on seven reviews.\nAllMusic's Mark Deming praised the album, calling it \"a significant step forward for a group that already was doing mighty work, and it suggests any number of places they could take their talents next. Anyone who doubts METZ are one of North America's best bands needs to hear Up on Gravity Hill and find out what they've been missing\". Joshua Khan of Clash found the album \"most confident record so far and a deafening reminder that art wasn't designed to adhere to paint-by-numbers standards – it's meant to bend until it breaks into something new\". Alex Doyle of DIY wrote: \"perhaps best of all is how direct the whole thing is, typified by \"Glass Eye\", on which the outfit's uncompromising sound brings sonic clarity while sporadic backing vocals offer classic '90s boyband echoes. A solid record\". Madison Ryan of Exclaim! resumed: \"clocking in at only 35 minutes — though it feels longer, richer — Up on Gravity Hill is a quick glimpse into a more earnest METZ. This doesn't sound like a band experimenting with something new, but rather a group of musicians secure enough in their craft to humbly evolve with increasingly uncertain times\". Brian Stout of PopMatters concluded: \"this has been a particularly strong year for heavy, guitar-forward music, and Up on Gravity Hill is sure to turn up again on some end-of-the-year lists\". Wyndham Wallace of Uncut wrote: \"Metz's latest combines the Jesus Lizard's Goat-era aggression with PiL's Album-era rigour\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nMETZ – songwriters, producers, design, layout\nAlex Edkins – vocals, guitar, additional recording\nChris Slorach – bass\nHayden Menzies – drums\nAmber Webber – vocals (track 8)\nOwen Pallett – strings arrangement\nSeth Manchester – engineering, mixing\nGraham Walsh – additional engineering\nMatt Colton – mastering\nSara Cwynar – cover\nJeff Kleinsmith – design, layout\nJohn Edkins – sleeve photo\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n=== Weekly charts ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nUp On Gravity Hill at Discogs (list of releases)",

        "content": "Ethem Çeku (born 1962) is a historian and former soldier and politician in Kosovo. He was an officer in the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) in the 1998–99 Kosovo War and a minister in the government of Kosovo from 2002 to 2008. Çeku is a member of the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK).\nHe is a cousin of former Kosovan prime minister Agim Çeku.\n\n\n== Kosovo War ==\nÇeku was a commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army in the area of Peja during the Kosovo War. After the end of the war in June 1999, he brought reporters to what he said was a torture chamber operated by Serbian police in the city. He said that 395 ethnic Albanians had been brought to a jail next to the police station in the final three months of the war and that their current whereabouts were unknown.\n\n\n== Politician ==\n\n\n=== Interim leader of Peja (1999–2000) ===\nAt the end of the Kosovo War, the Kosovo Liberation Army appointed Çeku as interim mayor of Peja. He continued to wear his combat fatigues to work and carried an AK-47, despite demands from international forces that the KLA disarm.\nIn response to an attack on a Serbian Orthodox church in Peja in July 1999, Çeku said, \"I feel very sorry about that church, and we're all for preserving the old buildings. But we're very allergic to churches built since 1990. They are churches of politics, not churches of religion.\"\nÇeku met with United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan during the latter's visit to the province in October 1999.\nThe United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) appointed Jose Manuel Sucre as municipal administrator of Peja later in 1999, and Çeku was reassigned as chairman of the Peja municipal council. In May 2000, Çeku signed a statement on behalf of the council that there was not yet any possibility of allowing Serb refugees to return to the area. He attended talks in Washington, D.C., in July 2000; the talks did not deal with the status of Kosovo but rather with ending the ongoing violence between the Serb and Albanian communities and creating conditions for democratic institutions.\nThe Peja region was threatened by serious forest fires in August 2000, and Çeku was described as deploying all of the forces of the municipality to prevent an environmental catastrophe.\nÇeku appeared in the second position on the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo's electoral list for Peja in the 2000 Kosovan local elections and placed first among the party's candidates, winning election to the local assembly. The Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) won a majority victory in the city, and his term as council leader came to an end.\n\n\n=== Cabinet minister (2002–08) ===\n\n\n==== Minister of Environment and Urban Planning (2002–04) ====\nÇeku oversaw the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo's election headquarters in the 2001 Kosovan parliamentary election and introduced its election list to the media in September 2001. He himself appeared in the eleventh position on the list. The election was held under closed list proportional representation; the AAK won eight seats, and he was not elected.\nThe AAK joined Kosovo's coalition government after the election and received two cabinet positions. When the new ministry was formed on 4 April 2002, Çeku was appointed as minister of environment and urban planning. Following his appointment, he said his first priority would be the development and implementation of a legal structure for his ministry; once this was in place, his focus would turn to building industrial zones and infrastructure, environmental protection, and management of natural resources. He said that Pristina's growing illegal construction sector was a serious problem and also accused neighbouring Macedonia of \"invading\" 2,500 hectares of Kosovo's territory.\nIn a November 2003 interview, Çeku highlighted his ministry's work in promulgating laws on environment and spatial planning and expressed hope that the assembly would soon approve further laws on water supply, housing, and the Bjeshkët e Nemuna range. He identified limited finances and a lack of qualified employees as his department's main challenges and called for additional funding from international donors.\nÇeku was injured in a February 2004 car bomb attack in Peja. The injuries were minor, and he was treated at a local hospital. Police did not identify a motive for the attack.\nIn May 2004, Çeku met with Albanian public works and tourism minister Bashkim Fino in Pristina. Their talks covered illegal housing construction, tourism, and the integration of Kosovo's highway system with Albania and Macedonia. The following month, Çeku presented Kosovo's Strategy for Sustainable Environmental Development at a public event at the University of Pristina, and the Kosovo assembly approved his ministry's bill on Kosovo's waters.\nÇeku and Turkish environment minister Osman Pepe signed a protocol on environmental cooperation in September 2004.\n\n\n==== Minister of Energy (2004–08) ====\nÇeku was given the eighth position on the AAK's electoral list in the 2004 Kosovan parliamentary election and was elected when the list won nine seats. His first parliamentary term was brief; the Democratic League of Kosovo formed a new coalition government with the AAK after the election, and Çeku was appointed as minister of energy when the ministry was formed on 3 December 2004. He was also appointed to a lead role in the development of Kosovo's economic development strategy.\nShortly after his appointment as energy minister, Çeku took part in a public debate with Nexhat Daci, who was then president of the Assembly of Kosovo. Daci proposed shutting down the Kosovo A Power Station, which he described as obsolete, and replacing it with a series of smaller plants. Çeku argued for revitalizing Kosovo A and restarting the Kosovo B plant, and for targeting unmetered connections to Kosovo's power grid.\nIn June 2005, Çeku introduced a fifteen-year energy development strategy, highlighted by a pledge for Kosovo to have 4,200 megawatts in new generating capacities by 2020. He argued that Kosovo's energy sector was making progress in fulfilling Kosovo's energy needs, citing a recent memorandum with Albania on a 400-kilowatt transmitting line. Two months later, he said that Kosovo Energy Corporation (KEK) officials, with whom he had a poor relationship generally in this period, would need to provide residents with all-day electricity transmission or face punitive measures.\nÇeku reactivated the Trepča Mines on a three-month experimental basis in August 2005. He expressed confidence that the enterprise would prove economically viable and increase the social welfare of the Mitrovica District. The following month, he joined with representatives of the European Agency for Reconstruction to announce a plan for rehabilitating Kosovo A. On the latter occasion, he proposed a \"zero tolerance\" plan for those not paying energy bills.\nIn November 2005, Çeku was appointed to chair a joint UNMIK–Kosovo task force on energy. In February of the following year, he was appointed to a task force on the opening of the R 6 Motorway.\nÇeku presented a plan for the development of a Kosovo C power plant in May 2006. Construction was slated to begin in 2008. Çeku described the plant as the largest investment that Kosovo's government had made since the beginning of UNMIK's mandate and said that it would generate one hundred fifty million Euros per year for the state. He also indicated that Kosovo's government would have only a minority stake in the plant, with private investors holding the majority of shares. One of the plant's strongest supporters was UNMIK deputy chief of internal administration Steven P. Schook, with whom Çeku had formed a close partnership.\nIn June 2006, Çeku rejected a proposal by the Russian firm Gazprom to build a new power capacity fuelled by imported natural gas.\nThe Kosovo government appointed Çeku as chair of the Kosovo Energy Corporation in May 2007. Shortly thereafter, he led the board in dismissing Pranvera Dobruna-Kryeziu as managing director, only eight months into her term. He said that her dismissal was due to poor performance and lack of cooperation between the corporation and the energy ministry. In August of the same year, he led the board in ending the KEK's financial support for Radio Television of Kosovo (RTK).\nÇeku and Kosovo interior minister Blerim Kuçi introduced a 2007 memorandum that made vehicle registration conditional on the payment of all outstanding energy bills. An unintended consequence of this was a decrease in the number of registered vehicles and greater financial pressure on Kosovo's insurance agencies.\nKosovo's energy sector faced significant challenges during the early 2000s, with frequent power shortages and an irregular power supply. The World Bank's director for South East Europe expressed disappointment with the sector in July 2007, saying that it had not been managed properly despite significant investments. The non-government organization COHU! accused Çeku of damaging local energy production by favouring international investors.\n\n\n=== Opposition legislator (2008–11) ===\nÇeku once again oversaw the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo's election headquarters for the 2007 Kosovan parliamentary election. Prior to this election, Kosovo adopted a system of open list proportional representation. Çeku was given the fifth position on the AAK's list and finished eighth among its candidates. The list won ten seats. Çeku was not immediately elected due to a requirement for one-third female representation, but he was the first candidate in line for a replacement seat, and he was able to take a seat when party leader Ramush Haradinaj resigned his mandate soon after the election. (At the time, Haradinaj was facing charges of war crimes at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY); he was later acquitted.)\nThe Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) won the 2007 election and afterward formed a new coalition government with the LDK. The AAK moved into opposition. In mid-2008, it was reported that the new PDK-led administration regarded virtually everything Çeku accomplished as energy minister with suspicion and that United Nations administrators were investigating whether senior UN officials had worked with Kosovo politicians to manipulate the Kosovo C tender process. Çeku, for his part, accused the government of mismanaging Kosovo's international relations around the Kosovo C plant and in March 2010 expressed doubt that the project would ever start. (Kosovo C was, in fact, ultimately cancelled.)\nÇeku appeared in the fourteenth position on the AAK's list in the 2010 parliamentary election, finished seventeenth among its candidates, and was not re-elected when the list won twelve seats. He resigned from all party functions in the AAK in July 2012 and has not returned to active political life since this time.\n\n\n== Academic career ==\nÇeku began working at the University of Pristina in 1989. He became an assistant professor at the post-war institution in 2010, was appointed as dean of the education department in 2012, and was promoted to associate professor in 2021. In 2016, he published the book Kosovo and Diplomacy Since World War II.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Beverly Hills Little Theatre for Professionals, which grew out of a nationwide little theatre movement, was a playhouse founded by actor Harold Lloyd and others in 1931 in Beverly Hills, California. It was originally at the Wilkes Vine Street Theatre and some years later moved to a renovated location on Santa Monica boulevard. The venue was a 400-seat theater, with the names of the founder-subscribers inscribed on the backs of the seats. An article in Variety stated that Lloyd's mother Elisabeth Fraser Lloyd (listed as Sarah Elisabeth Fraser), Gladys Lloyd Cassell (wife of Edward G. Robinson), and Sam Hardy served on the \"coin-raising\" (fundraising) committee. \n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nBefore the theatre opened, it had been rumored around Hollywood as on its way, a natural extension of a national trend called the little theatre movement. Photoplay's pseudonymous gossip columnist, \"Cal York,\" reported overhearing a woman who wrote features for the movie magazines, Franc Dillon, who was one of the earliest supporters and possibly a founder. Referring to her as \"one of the fond parents of the Beverly Hill Little Theatre movement,\" he reported her speaking to Kenneth Harlan at Estelle Taylor's estate, and inviting him to be in one of the plays when the theatre would be established in the future. In 1935 Hollywood correspondent Dan Thomas wrote that they chose Beverly Hills because more cinema stars lived there than in Hollywood, and the whole point of the endeavor was involving the stars in stage productions, and inviting scouts to see the shows. \nOne of its earliest plays in 1932 was \"The Perfect Alibi,\" based on a play by A. A. Milne and starring Barbara Kent. In 1933 they produced The Good Fairy by Ferenc Molnár, directed by MGM dramatic coach, director, and UCLA lecturer Oliver Hinsdell, a man Photoplay described as one \"who teaches the M-G-M starlets to say ‘‘a-a-a-a-” and pull in the 'tummy.'\" It starred Marion Clayton, J. Irving White, Kenneth Thomson, Richard Tucker, Harry Stubbs, Sidney Christie, and Francesca Braggiotti. \"Eve the Fifth\" was also performed in December 1933, directed again by Hinsdell and starring Patsy Ruth Miller, Russell Gleason, Mary Jo Ellis, William Burenn, and Paul Hurst. James Ellison was discovered while performing there in 1934. \"Bitter Harvest\" was tried out there in 1934 before moving to the Hollywood Playhouse. Hope Loring directed the play \"Caprice\" there in 1934. In June 1935 it produced Lea Freeman's comedy \"A Widow in Green,\" directed by Dickson Morgan, and starring Grace Stafford, Alden Chase, Daisy Belmore, Colin Campbell, Kathleen Lockhart, Adele St. Maur, Beth Alden, and Viola Moore. That same year, immediately following the production, it offered John Entenza's \"A Notorious Lady,\" starring Paul De Ricon, Lora Treadwell, Adele Rowland, Grace Hale, and Robert Hoover, directed by Alexander Leftwich. In 1935, it also produced \"The Bellamy Trial,\" again directed by Dickson Morgan, and starring Barbara Kent and Jack Mulhall. Alice Martino of the Cumnock School of Expression and the Pasadena Playhouse was listed as having performed there sometime prior to 1938.\n\n\n=== Young talent showcase ===\n\nIt was a place for young stars to showcase their talents in the hope of being discovered. In 1937, actor John Craven performed there in \"The Thirteenth Chair\" and Noël Coward's \"Hay Fever,\" the latter also (possibly) with Joanne Jordan, who was said in her obituary to have acted in Coward plays at the theatre. Margaret Early also performed there in 1937, as did Claire Windsor, with Roger Kendal and Judith Arden. Elinor Davenport began there in 1937, later performing in the 1942 Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy film I Married an Angel. A group of young singers including Felix Knight, Marguerite Lamar, Robert Grandin, and Eloise Horton, accompanied by Arthur Carr and a string ensemble and emceed by Durward Grinstead, offered a night of \"opera vignettes\" in 1937. Marie Wilson appeared in three plays there, leading to a contract with Warner Brothers for 1938's Boy Meets Girl. One starlet named Maxine Fife appeared there in 1943 when she was just a senior in high school. Her subsequent movie studio contract required a judge's signature because she was under age. She certainly wasn't the youngest to launch her career there In 1945 Jill St. John had her first stage role at the Little Theatre at age five. Lila Leeds also appeared there as a teenager in 1945, starring in one of the then-popular campus comedies. An actor named Howard Johnson produced a play there when he was a youth, saving $125 from his allowance (the anecdote may be tongue-in-cheek) for the expenses of the Emlyn Williams play \"Night Must Fall.\" He was discovered by John Cousins of the Musart and went on to work with Laird Cregar.\n\n\n=== A place to transition from stage to film, or from silent to talking pictures ===\nThe theatre filled a necessary gap between stage and film. From its start Variety  noted that Hinsdell expected to use film actors in the plays to make it a showcase that would attract talent scouts. It also functioned as a way for actors to get back in front of studio eyes after a hiatus, and to demonstrate their vocal skills for the newer medium of sound movies. For example, Gene Stratton (stage name of Gene Stratton Monroe), granddaughter of author Gene Stratton-Porter, used to star in silent films based on her grandmother's books such as \"Keeper of the Bees,\" \"Laddie,\" and \"Freckles,\" all of which were turned into talking films in the mid-1930s. She acted at the Little Theatre in 1932. Columnist and producer James Leo Meehan – who happened to be her mother's second husband – noted  that she hoped to use that stage to show that she could transition to the talking pictures (presumably because it was a place to hear their voices). Also making a rough transition from silent film, Theda Bara appeared there in \"Bella Donna\" in 1934, while she was married to Charles Brabin, with an audience reception that author Norman Zierold described as \"more polite than enthusiastic.\" She later retired from acting. UCLA used appearance at the theatre as evidence an actor was working, for example noting in 1935 that young actor Morton Kiger gained stage experience there. It was also a place for New York actors to continue to work on stage while on the opposite coast.\n\n\n=== Trivia ===\n\nFor three years, from 1932 to 1935, with its partner Vine Street Theatre, it also produced films under the name Mirror.\nIn 1935 a new theatre (the same playhouse in an improved venue) was announced as forthcoming, presumably at the Santa Monica boulevard address, and it was said to cost an estimated $100,000. Boosters hoped it would rival New York's Theatre Guild for influence. In 1938, an architecture magazine announced that Edwin Drake was renovating the \"old\" Beverly Hills Little Theatre building for his own group, the Patio Playhouse, but it is unclear when the Little Theatre actually changed locations.\nIn 1936 two of the theatre's actors, Martha Chapin and Elaine Johnson, were photographed by the Los Angeles Times as they readied an old horse car for a fundraising fair to be held on the Harold Lloyd Studios lot. The president and chair of the board from 1931 until at least 1936 was listed as Golda Madden Craig, and she coordinated the fair with Lloyd's mother Elisabeth Fraser Lloyd. The little theatre movement was also listed as a potential beneficiary.\nPlayers could participate in an annual drama tournament hosted by the Los Angeles County Drama Association showing some of the reach of the little theatre movement in California. In 1933 the Los Angeles Evening Post-Record listed twelve little theaters in its region alone, including the Monrovia Players with \"Sad About Europe,\" the University College Players of USC with \"Listening,\" the Inglewood Community Players with \"The Cajun,\" the Little Theatre of the Verdugos with \"Out She Goes,\" the Dramateurs Polytechnic High School with \"The Geranium Lady,\" the Beverly Hills Community Players with \"The Mirage,\" the San Pedro Repertory Players with \"The Monkey's Paw,\" the University Dramatic Society of UCLA with \"Magoromo,\" a Japanese noh drama, the Touchstone Drama Shop of USC with \"Night in the Inn,\" and a surprise guest performance by the Beverly Hills Little Theatre for Professionals. They competed for the Mildred Davis Lloyd trophy, named for Harold Lloyd's wife.\n\n\n== References ==",

She ranked second in the nation in assists per game (1.12), third in points per game (1.74), and seventh in goals per game (0.62). Her 38 assists tied the Cornell single-season record. Following the season, she was named to the All-Ivy and All-ECAC first teams, and won Ivy League Player of the Year, ECAC Forward of the Year, and ECAC Player of the Year.

        "content": "Stanisław Stomma (born 18 January [O.S. 5 January] 1908 – 21 July 2005) was a Polish lawyer, habilitated doctor of law, specialist in criminal law, academic teacher, publicist, Catholic activist, and politician. From 1957 to 1976, he was a member of Sejm of the Polish People's Republic (II, III, IV, V, and VI terms) representing Znak. From 1981 to 1984, he served as the chairman of the Primate's Social Council. From 1989 to 1991, he was a senator in the first term and the senior marshal of the Senate in the first term. He was awarded the Order of the White Eagle.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Youth ===\nHe was the son of Ludwik (1859–1910) and Jadwiga née Jasieńska (1875–1944) and had three sisters: Helena (1901–1972), Zofia (1903–1981), and Aniela (1905–1989). He was born into a landowning family, in the family manor in Stačiūnai, which, after Poland regained independence, fell within the borders of Lithuania. He attended the Sigismund Augustus Gymnasium in Vilnius (1922–1928) and joined the Sodality of Our Lady and the Union of Polish Youth Przyszłość during his studies. Later, he studied law at Vilnius University. From 1928, he was active in the Vilnius branch of the Association of Catholic Academic Youth Odrodzenie and became its president in the academic year 1929/1930. In 1931, he made his debut as a journalist in the newspaper Słowo.\nHe defended his master's thesis under the supervision of Stefan Glaser in 1932. After completing his studies, he worked as a non-remunerated judicial trainee, while also working at the rectorate of his alma mater as a student affairs officer. From 1933 to 1936, he was also the secretary of Marian Zdziechowski. At the end of 1936, he briefly joined the editorial board of the magazine Kurier Wileński, and in 1937, he directed the biweekly Pax. In 1937, he defended his doctoral thesis entitled Fault and Causal Connection in the Development of Criminal Law, written under the supervision of Bronisław Wróblewski. From 1937 to 1938, he collaborated with the newspaper Głos Narodu; for six months (until October 1937), he was a member of the editorial board of this newspaper and lived in Kraków at that time. In his writings in the 1930s, he dealt with Christian thought, national thought, and the issue of totalitarianism, advocating for so-called Christian nationalism, within which social life was to be built on the basis of national community, but with the recognition of the absolute primacy of Catholic ethics. In 1938, he obtained the position of senior volunteer assistant at the Department of Criminal Law at Vilnius University (headed by Bronisław Wróblewski), but immediately (in June 1938) went on a one-year scholarship to Paris.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\nIn the summer of 1939, he returned to Poland. Following the outbreak of World War II, he was not mobilized due to his health category being \"C\". In September 1939, he replaced Józef Święcicki as the editor-in-chief of Kurier Wileński, but after the Soviet troops entered Poland, he left for Riga with his friend Antoni Gołubiew. After the Red Army entered Latvia, he returned to Lithuania, where he went into hiding in the countryside. He returned to Vilnius after the German army entered in June 1941. In 1941, he became a member of the editorial board of the underground magazine Dla Polski, published by Father Józef Wojtukiewicz, and also participated in underground education (his students included Henryk Gulbinowicz and Józefa Hennelowa). In July 1944, he fled from Vilnius due to the approaching Red Army. In August 1944, he found himself in Laski, where he joined the underground resistance, briefly serving in the ranks of the Stołpce Home Army Group. In October 1944, he moved to Kraków, where he worked for the Main Welfare Council. From December 1944 to May 1945, he was a seminarian at the Higher Theological Seminary of the Archdiocese of Kraków.\n\n\n=== Between 1946 and 1956 ===\nAfter leaving the seminary, he became a close collaborator and then a member of the editorial team of Tygodnik Powszechny; during this time, he advocated for seeking compromise with the communist authorities and taking into account political realities. He also briefly collaborated with the magazine Dziś i Jutro. In the autumn of 1946, together with Hanna Malewska, he became the editor-in-chief of the magazine Znak, but de facto from 1947, Hanna Malewska directed the magazine (Stanisław Stomma remained one of its main columnists). From 1947, he participated in meetings of the Kraków Club of Logophages.\nIn September 1946, he was a signatory of a memorial by Catholic intellectuals to the Polish Episcopate, appealing for support for the establishment of a political party representing Polish Catholics. In November of the same year, he signed a declaration along with 37 Catholic writers who supported the initiative to create a Catholic political organization. He also participated in an attempt to create, with the consent of the authorities, a Catholic parliamentary representation in connection with the parliamentary elections in 1947 (the initiative, considered belated by the authorities, was ultimately rejected by the Polish Episcopate).\nIn the autumn of 1946, he published an article titled Maximal and Minimal Social Tendencies of Catholics in the third issue of Znak. In this article, he sought a compromise between Catholicism and socialism, primarily in the sphere of social system reform, arguing that the Catholic Church is not bound to any specific program in this matter. He also emphasized the necessity of building strong spiritual, cultural, and intellectual foundations, providing Catholicism with the opportunity for long-term development. Faced with the aggressive communist policy, he advocated for a retreat to \"religious-moral\" positions. His proposal met with opposition from a significant part of the Catholic community (debaters included Jan Piwowarczyk, Józef Marian Święcicki, Tadeusz Przeciszewski, Kazimierz Studentowicz, Jerzy Braun), accusing him, among other things, of a stance of capitulation. Stanisław Stomma subsequently defended his position in an article titled On Apparent Maximization and Imagined Defeatism, published in Tygodnik Powszechny on 20 April 1947. He sought a different path for the functioning of Catholic communities under communism than confrontation or ideological surrender.\nFrom 1 January 1946, he was an employee of the Department of Criminal Law at the Jagiellonian University. In 1947, he habilitated based on his work Sociological Assessment of Certain Concepts of Criminal Law Science (formal habilitation approval was only granted by the higher education authority in 1957). He unsuccessfully applied for a position at Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń, and in October 1949, he received a notice of termination at Jagiellonian University (he was given a choice: to work at the university or in a Catholic publication), as a result of which he ceased to work at JU on 31 January 1950.\nIn the issue of Tygodnik Powszechny dated 10 December 1950, together with Jerzy Turowicz, he published an article titled Catholics in People's Poland, in which they declared that while they see many positive aspects in socialism, the socialist ideal is not their ideal, and the separate Catholic position should be respected. In another joint article titled The Polish Experiment, published in Tygodnik Powszechny on 3 February 1952, they positively responded to the State-Church agreement of 14 April 1950, suggesting that the apolitical stance of Catholics entails the necessity of loyalty to the state. Faced with escalating anti-Church policies and censorship interference in May 1952, he, along with Jerzy Turowicz and Jacek Woźniakowski, appealed for the continued publication of Tygodnik Powszechny, declaring the possibility of supporting some aspects of the government's policies (such as economic issues, combating German nationalism and revisionism, alliance with the USSR), but on the condition of maintaining autonomy in non-political matters. During this period, along with other editors of Tygodnik Powszechny, he consulted most strategic decisions with Archbishop Stefan Wyszyński.\nAfter the previous editorial team was removed from Tygodnik Powszechny in June 1953, he was unemployed for about a year. In 1954, he was employed at the National Museum in Kraków, where he worked as the head of the museum library. He also received an advance for a series of essays from the publishing institute Pax. He remained one of the leaders of the former Tygodnik Powszechny editorial team.\n\n\n=== Between 1956 and 1961 ===\nIn October 1956, he was part of a group of lay Catholics who announced the establishment of the Nationwide Club of Progressive Catholic Intelligentsia, aimed at forming a \"social representation\" of Catholic communities. At that time, he, along with other leaders of this movement, was accepted both by Stefan Wyszyński and by Władysław Gomułka. In Przegląd Kulturalny (issue from October 25–31, 1956), he published an article titled Access to Contemporary Poland, in which he supported the October 1956 reforms aimed at eliminating Stalinist totalitarianism, pointing out that Poland's territorial integrity was guaranteed by the alliance with the USSR. In November 1956, he was re-employed at the Faculty of Law at the Jagiellonian University, although his actual academic work was hindered by his soon-to-be political activities (in the following years, he had only one doctoral student – Andrzej Spotowski, who defended his doctoral thesis in 1970). His application for the title of professor was never considered.\nIn the following years, he advocated for the program of so-called neo-positivism, within which he sought a compromise with the authorities of the Polish People's Republic that would allow for the free operation of Catholic communities (including the operation of Catholic intelligentsia clubs and parliamentary representation) and would permit concessions by the authorities to the Catholic Church. Therefore, he accepted the alliance with the USSR as geopolitically inevitable and did not question the actual power of the Polish United Workers' Party. He rejected what he called \"political romanticism\" and \"prestige politics\" appealing to \"grand slogans\". However, his goal remained the democratization of the system. He demanded that the Polish government be the expression of the real aspirations of the people and, in the economic sphere, called for breaking away from doctrinairism and for social control over the economy.\nIn 1957, he ran as an independent candidate in the parliamentary elections (standing in district No. 34 in Kraków), publicly declaring that his goal in the Sejm would be to fight for the rights of believers and defend the interests of the Catholic Church. He also emphasized that Catholic deputies could serve as advisers to Marxists. According to official election results, he received over 249,000 votes, surpassing, among others, Józef Cyrankiewicz. In the Sejm, he became the chairman of Znak parliamentary caucus, as well as the vice-chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee and a member of the Senior Convention. In his first parliamentary speech, he stressed that despite ideological differences and \"unpleasant past experiences\", Catholic deputies shared overarching national goals, including the ideal of a sovereign and just Poland. Already at the beginning of 1958, he observed a departure from the policies initiated in October 1956 (although he considered the most important achievements of that period to be preserved), publicly calling for greater trust in society and enabling greater involvement of non-party individuals. Initially, he maintained optimism regarding the intentions of the Polish United Workers' Party, and therefore, despite the worsening situation of the church, on one hand, he encouraged Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński to make another attempt at reaching an agreement with the party authorities, and on the other hand, along with other Znak deputies, he called on the ruling party to refrain from harassing believers and to accept the historical and social role of the Catholic Church.\nFrom 1957, he began establishing contacts with political circles in West Germany, openly formulating the condition of respecting borders.\nFrom September 1958, he was the president of the Klub Inteligencji Katolickiej in Kraków; at the same time, he was involved in the Klub Inteligencji Katolickiej in Warsaw, serving as its vice president from 1958 to 1962. In October 1958, he accompanied Stefan Wyszyński on a trip to Rome in connection with the conclave following the death of Pius XII.\nIn the fall of 1959, he permanently moved to Warsaw.\n\n\n=== Between 1961 and 1976 ===\nIn the parliamentary elections of 1961, he once again obtained a parliamentary seat in Kraków, receiving, according to official data, 302,000 votes (once again surpassing Józef Cyrankiewicz). He remained the chairman of Znak parliamentary caucus and was a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Judiciary Committee. In his first parliamentary speech, he affirmed the achievements of the Polish People's Republic, accusing lower levels of administration of discriminating against believers; however, he emphasized hope for the growth of democracy in Poland and the socialist bloc. Despite the deteriorating relations between the state and the Catholic Church, he continued to seek possibilities for compromise, unsuccessfully urging Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński to do so. He advocated for a \"socially constructive\" attitude instead of \"hostile neutrality\" and stressed the importance of organic work, including the need to develop the spiritual and intellectual formation of youth.\nAt least from 1961, his residence was bugged by officers of the Security Service. The authorities of the Polish People's Republic considered him a representative of the so-called right-wing faction within the Catholic Intelligentsia Club, with the criterion being the attitude towards the Polish United Workers' Party, indicating that this group viewed socialism as a necessary evil and worked towards its liberalization, expecting a weakening of the party's leading role.\nHe was fascinated by the Second Vatican Council, but later critically assessed the post-council period, pointing to a strong crisis in the Catholic Church caused, among other things, by materialistic tendencies and consumerism erasing the religious element.\nIn January 1963, he published a critical article in Tygodnik Powszechny titled With the Dust of Fraternal Blood, dedicated to the January Uprising. In it, he criticized the cult of defeat and irrational heroism. He was publicly criticized for this by Stefan Wyszyński. During this time, his position in church circles gradually weakened. Another crisis in relations with the primate was caused by the circulation in October 1963 in Rome of the \"opinion of Catholic circles in Poland\" associated with Tygodnik Powszechny, the monthly magazines Znak and Więź, and the Znak parliamentary caucus, prepared with the participation of Stanisław Stomma. This document was considered a mistake for condemning any form of state governed by communists. While observing the continuous worsening of the situation of the Catholic Church in Poland, it was suggested that relations with the authorities did not have to deteriorate. Therefore, a constructive attitude towards social and economic tasks was called for. However, the most controversial point of the document was the demand for the establishment of diplomatic relations between Poland and the Holy See. Stefan Wyszyński regarded this text as an act of disloyalty, and Stanisław Stomma's apology was accepted only in April 1964.\nIn the 1960s, he became involved in the process of Polish-German reconciliation. In 1969, as the first Polish MP, he was received by the President of Germany, Gustav Heinemann.\nHe was elected as a member of parliament again in 1965, taking the fourth place in the Kraków constituency No. 4, and remained the chairman of Znak parliamentary caucus. In Sejm, he publicly criticized the lack of progress in the processes of democratization, persecution of the Catholic Church, and excessive censorship interference, emphasizing that national unity cannot be equated with uniformity. His relations with Stefan Wyszyński remained cool, and they were only restored in January 1967. In this parliamentary term, he also encountered growing differences within his parliamentary caucus, especially in relation to Janusz Zabłocki's separate position. Along with other members of the caucus, he submitted a parliamentary interpellation in March 1968 in defense of university students who were victims of \"brutal police action\", which led to attacks formulated in Sejm. In this context, he subsequently suggested that MPs from Znak resign their mandates and refrain from running for re-election. However, he encouraged caucus members to remain in Sejm, as advised by Stefan Wyszyński.\nEventually, in 1969, he became an MP for the fourth time, taking the first place in the constituency No. 4 in Kraków (according to official results, he received 97% of the votes), once again assuming the position of chairman of the parliamentary group. In this term of Sejm, he served as the Vice Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee and a member of the Judiciary Committee. However, his position within Znak parliamentary group weakened. Janusz Zabłocki suggested that Konstanty Łubieński should become the new chairman, and the only supporter of Stanisław Stomma remained Tadeusz Mazowiecki. Nevertheless, he maintained good relations with Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński. His political contacts with the authorities of the Edward Gierek era were also weaker than before (other members of the group, Janusz Zabłocki and Konstanty Łubieński, were in better standing).\nHe was also elected to Sejm in 1972 (this time in the constituency No. 9 in Białystok, where according to official results, he took second place, receiving over 98% of the votes). Once again, he became the chairman of Znak parliamentary group, although there were plans for a change in leadership within the group. However, the Kraków faction of Znak protested against this, believing that in such a situation, Stanisław Stomma should leave the group. In February 1976, as the only member, he did not support changes to the Constitution of the Polish People's Republic, concerning the leading role of the Polish United Workers' Party and the alliance with the USSR, abstaining from voting. He believed that the changes would entrench the socialist form of power without societal control. As a result, the authorities of the Polish People's Republic did not allow him to run for Sejm in 1976, although he himself considered such a possibility.\n\n\n=== Between 1976 and 1989 ===\nIn 1978, he retired from the Jagiellonian University. In the late 1970s, he maintained a distance from opposition activities but befriended Adam Michnik, whom he regarded as the wisest Polish politician of the time. In 1980, he published the book Is Fatalism of Hostility? Reflections on Polish-German Relations 1871–1933.\nDuring the events of August 1980, he joined a petition addressed to the communist authorities, signed by 64 scientists, writers, and journalists, calling for dialogue with striking workers. After the emergence of Solidarity, he maintained a friendly but cautious stance towards it, being critical of the excessive radicalism in many union actions. In the autumn of 1981, he was a signatory to two open letters addressed to the authorities of the Polish People's Republic, urging them to seek unity and dialogue. While highlighting the government's responsibility for the difficult economic situation, the letters also emphasized the necessity of respecting the alliance with the Soviet Union. However, these documents did not influence the decisions of the authorities. In December 1981, he became the chairman of the newly established Primate's Social Council. He was the main author of the council's fundamental document, announced in April 1982, titled Theses of the Primate's Social Council on Social Accord, in which they called for an agreement between the authorities and society. The condition for the accord was to end repression and allow free activity for trade unions and cultural and social organizations. He led the council's working group on political thought. From 1983 onwards, he critically assessed the methods of its work, advocating for discussions among a smaller but more specialized group of people.\nHe was opposed to street demonstrations and general strikes, advocating instead for the gradual building of independent social structures. In the autumn of 1983, at the request of the church authorities, he participated in negotiations with the government regarding the fate of the leaders of Solidarity and the Committee for Social Self-Defense KOR awaiting trial. At the end of his term in the Primate's Social Council in December 1984, he became involved in the activities of the informal Dziekania Political Thought Club, of which he became the chairman. From 1986, he was a member of the newly formed senior convocation, defining the program of meetings. However, he rejected the possibility of entering Sejm as part of a new group approved by the Catholic authorities or participating in the Consultative Council with the Chairman of the State Council, although he only made this decision under the influence of the negative opinion of the Warsaw Catholic Intelligentsia Club. In 1988, he took over Dziekania as a legally operating association aimed at creating a platform for cooperation among various independent circles characterized by realism and moderation in political and social aspirations. In December 1988, he joined the Solidarity Citizens' Committee with Lech Wałęsa, the chairman of the Solidarity. In the spring of 1989, he participated on the opposition side in the proceedings of the Polish Round Table Agreement – in plenary sessions and in the work of the political reform group.\n\n\n=== Between 1989 and 2005 ===\nIn the 1989 elections, he was elected to the Senate from the Płock Voivodeship. On 4 July 1989, as the senior marshal, he chaired the inaugural session of the first term of the Senate, at that time belonging to the Citizens' Parliamentary Club. In the upper house of parliament, he became a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. After the elections, he considered the compromise reached at the Round Table as binding. He cast an invalid vote during the vote on Wojciech Jaruzelski's candidacy for the presidency. He also supported the theses of Adam Michnik's article Your President, Our Prime Minister, published a few weeks earlier. In the autumn of 1989, he concluded the activities of the Dziekania Political Thought Club along with other members. He was one of the founders of the Democratic Right Forum, established in June 1990, and was a member of its program council. He was also a member of the parliamentary group of the Democratic Right Forum.\nHe was among the supporters of Tadeusz Mazowiecki's candidacy for the presidency in 1990. In late 1990, he, along with other Democratic Right Forum politicians, joined the Democratic Union, where he belonged to the Democratic Right Faction. He remained in the Democratic Union even after some members of the faction formed the Conservative Party in the autumn of 1992. He opposed the ideological struggle against the Catholic Church, expressing his views in intra-party discussions. From 1994, he was a member of the Freedom Union, although he opposed the merger of the Democratic Union with the Liberal Democratic Congress. In the following years, however, he did not play a significant role in the party.\nHe approved of Leszek Balcerowicz's economic reforms, although he called for an active social policy. He opposed lustration and putting Wojciech Jaruzelski on trial before the State Tribunal, defending the essence of the Round Table Agreement. Until the mid-1990s, he participated in bodies related to shaping foreign policy, including meetings of the Atlantic Club and the Euro-Atlantic Association. He was a member of the Polish-Israeli Society and the Council for Polish-Jewish Relations under the President of the Republic of Poland.\nHe passed away on 21 July 2005. The funeral ceremonies took place on 27 July 2005, at the Warsaw Archcathedral. He was buried in the Forest Cemetery in Laski.\n\n\n== Private life ==\nIn 1947, he married Elwira Szykowska (1924–2006), whom he had met in Vilnius. In 1948, their daughter Magdalena was born, and in 1950, their son Ludwik was born.\n\n\n== Distinctions and awards ==\nOrder of the White Eagle (1994)\nCommander's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta (1969)\nKnight's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta (1964)\nGrand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany (1988)\nBadge of the 1000th Anniversary of the Polish State (1966)\nMedal for Long Marital Life (1997)\nWłodzimierz Pietrzak Award (1950)\nHonorary Doctorate from the Jagiellonian University (2000)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nFriszke, Andrzej (1997).

        "content": "The Rotter kidnapping (German: Rotter-Entführung) was a failed organized kidnapping in Liechtenstein of Fritz Rotter and Alfred Rotter, German film directors and theatre managers of Jewish background, by Liechtenstein citizens sympathetic to Nazi Germany. The attack was additionally supported by five German nationals within the country. \n\n\n== Background ==\nFritz Rotter and Alfred Rotter worked as writers and composers and owned multiple successful theatres in Berlin during the era of the Weimar Republic. However, by 1933 due to the two men's Jewish background, they were the target of pressure contemporaneous with the rise of Nazism in Germany and in January 1933 they were forced to declare bankruptcy and emigrated to Liechtenstein. They had previously succeeded in being naturalized in the country in 1931 as a result of a wider initiative by the Liechtenstein government. \nHowever, due to this Liechtenstein became the target of attacks by German press outlets. In particular, the Rotters became the target of attacks from the press as they falsely accused them of faking their bankruptcy and transferring their money abroad. As a result, it was publicly demanded that the two men be extradited back to Nazi Germany to face trial. Four local Liechtensteiner Nazis (Rudolf Schädler, Franz Roeckle, Peter Rheinbeger and Eugen Frommelt) used the German press demands as an impetus to kidnap the two men and forcefully extradite them to Nazi Germany, which was intended to coincide with the formation of an organized Nazi party in Liechtenstein.\n\n\n== Kidnapping ==\n\nOn 5 April 1933, Fritz and Alfred Rotter, along with Alfred's wife Gertrud Rotter, and Fritz's domestic partner Julie Wolff, were convinced by Schädler to stay at a health resort in Gaflei on the Alps which he managed. Once they arrived, the four men, along with five other German nationals convinced to assist with the plot, attempted to kidnap them and throw them into cars. This however, was unsuccessful as they fought back and began to escape on foot.\nShortly afterwards, Alfred and Gertrud fell into a nearby ravine while fleeing the kidnappers and were killed immediately. Around the same time, Fritz was tricked by one of the kidnappers into getting into his car under the false pretext of aiding him to safety, though once he realized he managed to overpower the driver and jump out of the car, thus breaking his shoulder in the process. Following this, he was able to re-unite with Julie Wolff who was also injured and successfully managed to reach safety and inform the Liechtenstein government.\n\n\n== Trials and aftermath ==\nFollowing the kidnapping attempt, three of the men involved were arrested within Liechtenstein, whereas the rest were caught while attempting to flee through Götzis in Austria and then extradited back to Liechtenstein. In June 1933, the men went on trial for the kidnapping. Notably however, both the indirect murder of Alfred and Gertrud and the political motivation behind the kidnapping were deliberately downplayed in order to avoid further press attacks from Nazi Germany. Fritz Rotter's lawyer, Wladimir Rosenbaum, was prevented from reading his plea where he directly criticized the Nazis' use of violence. In addition, approximately 700 signatures were gathered demanding the pardon of the German men involved.\nAs a result of the trial, Schädler was sentenced to one year in prison, whereas Roeckle, Rheinbeger and Frommelt were sentenced to four months. Four of the German men involved were separately sentenced to three months in a court in Konstanz. In October of the same year it was agreed that in order for German press attacks against Liechtenstein to come to an end Schädler and Rheinbeger would be released from prison early. Schädler was released the following month.\n\nThe kidnappings and subsequent trials temporarily held back the formation of an organized Nazi party in Liechtenstein, and it would not form until 1938 as the German National Movement in Liechtenstein (VBDL) with Schädler as its initial leader. Fritz Rotter and his wife would shortly after leave Liechtenstein and with assistance from Wladimir Rosenbaum, would live in exile in France until his death in 1939. \nIn August 2022, two plaques were placed in Vaduz to commemorate Alfred and Gertrud Rotter.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nPeter Geiger (1997).

During the war, he commanded 1st Brigade, 15th Cavalry Division and 17th Brigade, 9th Division during their organization and training in the United States.\nRyan retired from the army in 1920 and pursued a long career as a Chicago-based business executive. After retiring from business in 1942, he resided in St. Petersburg, Florida. He died in St. Petersburg on January 14, 1956. Ryan was buried at West Point Cemetery in West Point, New York.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nJames Augustine Ryan was born in Danbury, Connecticut on October 22, 1867, a son of James Ryan and Hannah (Doran) Ryan. He was educated at the Liberty Street School in Danbury and graduated from Danbury High School in 1884. In June 1885, Ryan competed for an appointment to the United States Military Academy (West Point). He attained the examining board's top score and was appointed by U.S. Representative Edward W.

During this posting, Ryan participated in the Apache Wars, including skirmishes against warriors led by the Apache Kid.\n\n\n== Early career ==\nFrom May 1892 to until October 1895, Ryan served with the 10th Cavalry at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Ryan was then posted to Fort Assinniboine, Montana with the 10th Cavalry, where he remained until March 1897. He was promoted to first lieutenant of the 9th Cavalry in February 1897. During his Fort Assinniboine posting, Ryan took part in the roundup and deportation of Canadian Cree people led by Little Bear, who were subsequently returned to Alberta and Saskatchewan. After leaving Montana, Ryan was assigned to duty with the Yukon Relief Mission, which provided emergency assistance to Klondike Gold Rush miners when they experienced severe food shortages.\nIn May 1898, Ryan joined the 9th Cavalry in Tampa, Florida as it was equipped and organized for Spanish–American War duty in Cuba. He commanded the regiment's A Troop during the Siege of Santiago, and was appointed regimental quartermaster in August 1898. In September 1898, the 9th Cavalry was assigned to Camp Grant, Arizona. Ryan was appointed regimental adjutant in January 1899. In July 1899, Ryan was assigned to recruiting duty in Denver, Colorado. From November 1899 to August 1900, he served as aide-de-camp to Brigadier General Henry C. Merriam, commander of the Department of the Colorado and Department of the Missouri.\n\n\n== Continued career ==\nIn August 1900, Ryan began a tour of duty in the Philippines during the Philippine–American War. He remained there until August 1903 and was promoted to captain of the 15th Cavalry Regiment in February 1901. During his Philippines service, Ryan was among the U.S. officers accused of using the water cure and other harsh interrogation measures on Filipino prisoners. Ryan was court-martialed and admitted the facts of the allegations against him. In his defense, he argued that his actions were a military necessity and did not cause enough harm to his interrogation subjects to be considered torture. The court agreed, and Ryan was acquitted.\nFrom August 1903 to August 1905, Ryan served as adjutant of the 15th Cavalry, first at Fort Myer, Virginia and then at Fort Ethan Allen, Vermont. From August 1905 to October 1906, he was a student at Fort Leavenworth, first attending the Infantry and Cavalry School, then the United States Army Command and General Staff College. From November 1906 to February 1908, Ryan served in the Provisional Government of Cuba as aide-de-camp to provisional governor Charles Edward Magoon.\nIn February 1909, Ryan was assigned to Fort Sheridan, Illinois as commander of Troop M, 15th Cavalry. From August 1911 to July 1914, Ryan served as assistant professor of modern languages on the West Point faculty. In September 1912, he was promoted to major in the 5th Cavalry Regiment. From July to October 1914, he performed duty in Berlin, Germany as officer in charge of the Assistant Secretary of War's relief commission that facilitated the departure of U.S. citizens from Germany and Austria at the start of World War I.

From December 1914 to March 1916, he served at Camp Harry J. Jones, Arizona, first with the 13th Cavalry, and later as adjutant of the 2nd Cavalry Brigade. From March to May 1916, he served as Intelligence officer (G-2) on the staff of U.S. commander John J. Pershing during the Pancho Villa Expedition, after which he returned to duty with the 13th Cavalry.\n\n\n== Later career ==\nRyan was promoted to lieutenant colonel of the 1st Cavalry Regiment in July 1916 and served with the regiment at Camp Harry J. Jones. In January 1917, he was posted to duty as instructor and inspector of the Illinois National Guard. With U.S. entry into World War I causing an increased need for lieutenants and captains, the army began operation of several Officers' Training Centers. Ryan commanded the first two Officers' Training Centers at Fort Sheridan, one from May to August, and the second from August to December. Ryan was promoted to colonel in July 1917.\nIn December 1917, Ryan was promoted to temporary brigadier general and assigned to command 1st Brigade, 15th Cavalry Division at Fort Sam Houston. When the army determined that Cavalry units would not be required for combat in France, Ryan requested assignment to an Infantry brigade. He was then assigned to command the 17th Brigade, a unit of the 9th Division, which was being organized and trained at Camp Sheridan, Alabama. The Armistice of November 11, 1918 ended the war before the 9th Division could depart for France. Ryan continued to command the 17th Brigade until April 1919, and acted as the division commander on several occasions. He retired at his permanent rank of colonel, but in 1930 the U.S. Congress enacted legislation permitting the general officers of World War I to retire at their highest rank, and he was promoted to brigadier general on the retired list.\n\n\n== Later life and death ==\nAfter leaving the army, Ryan pursued a civilian business career, initially as an executive with Merrill Lynch & Co. in Chicago. Subsequent endeavors included field representative for the Texas Company, an oil company that conducted business in Mexico. While in Mexico, Ryan assisted in negotiating the Bucareli Treaty, which settled claims by U.S. corporations for losses they sustained during the Mexican Revolution.\nRyan's later endeavors included a close association with Samuel Insull, and among them were vice president and general manager of the Utility Securities Corporation and vice president and general manager of the Middle Creek Railway Company. In addition, he served as vice president and general manager of the Middle West Utilities Corporation and vice president and general manager of Insull Son & Company.\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, he was president of the Public Health Institute of Chicago, a privately funded enterprise that worked to eliminate sexually transmitted infections among Chicago's poor and working classes. In addition, he served as president of United Medical Service, Inc. of Chicago, a for-profit corporation that operated a medical clinic. From 1940 to 1942, he served as president of Ryber, Inc., another Chicago-based business.\nRyan retired in 1942. In retirement, Ryan was a resident of St. Petersburg, Florida. He died in St. Petersburg on January 14, 1956. Ryan was buried at West Point Cemetery.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nRyan's awards included:\n\nIndian Campaign Medal\nSpanish Campaign Medal\nPhilippine Campaign Medal\nCuban Pacification Medal\nMexican Service Medal\nWorld War I Victory Medal\n\n\n== Family ==\nIn February 1911, Ryan married Rosemary Tarleton, a native of Ireland.

        "content": "Combatant Mountain, also called Mount Combatant, is a 3,762-metre (12,343-foot) summit in British Columbia, Canada.\n\n\n== Description ==\nCombatant Mountain is located in the Waddington Range of the Coast Mountains, in a remote wilderness area that few visit. Combatant Mountain is set 152 km (94 mi) north of the community of Campbell River and 2.38 kilometres (1.48 mi) northeast of Mount Waddington, the highest peak of the entire Coast Mountains range. Combatant ranks as the third-highest peak in the Coast Mountains, seventh-highest in British Columbia, and 33rd-highest in Canada. Precipitation runoff and glacier meltwater from the mountain drains to Bute Inlet via the Homathko River. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises 1,360 meters (4,462 feet) above the Tiedemann Glacier in 1.5 kilometer (0.9 mile). Combatant Mountain has some of the more challenging and famous rock-climbing routes of the Waddington Range.\n\n\n== History ==\nA photo identifying the peak as \"Mt. Combatant\" was published in 1929 in the Canadian Alpine Journal.\nThe first ascent of the summit was made in 1933 by Don Munday, Phyllis Munday, Hans Fuhrer, and Henry S. Hall Jr.\nThe name \"Combatant Mountain\" was identified in 1948 by mountaineer Don Munday and the toponym was officially adopted October 5, 1950, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Munday wrote that the peak \"presents a slender, fairly symmetrical form, ...a pair of pale reddish buttresses support the twin peaks and a slanting shelf of some breadth breaks the continuity of the eastern buttress in its otherwise clean upthrust out of Tiedemann Glacier. Combatant claims rank as a classic of mountain architecture because of its simplicity and unity in expressing aspiration.\"\nSkywalk is a classic climbing route on the Southwest Buttress that was first climbed in 1982 by Scott Flavelle and Dave Lane.\nThe South Buttress was first climbed in August 1994 by Greg Child, Greg Collum and Steve Mascioli via a route they named Belligerence.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nBased on the Köppen climate classification, Combatant Mountain has an ice cap climate. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Winter temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C. This climate supports the Chaos, Scimitar, and Tiedemann glaciers surrounding Combatant Mountain.\n\n\n== See also ==\n Mountains portal\nGeography of British Columbia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWeather: Combatant Mountain\nCombatant and Waddington (photo): Flickr\nCombatant and Tiedemann (photo): Flickr\nCombatant, Tiedemann, Asperity (photo): Flickr",

        "content": "Redemption is the eighth studio album by the Canadian rock band Mystery, released on May 15, 2023, on Unicorn Digital. The album features the same lineup as the band's previous studio album, Lies and Butterflies, as well as featuring guest keyboardist Johnny Maz.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nRecording for the album started in 2018 and was originally planned for release in 2021. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic leading to the cancellation of live events, the band felt they didn't have a deadline to work towards causing progress on the album to slow down, leading to the second longest interval between studio albums. Once the band was able to begin playing live shows again in the summer of 2022, progress on the album began to pick up. With the album the band wanted to remain positive and give people hope.\n\n\n=== Songs ===\nThe first track \"Behind the Mirror\" was inspired by the refugee crisis. The song was released as the first single from the album on October 26, 2022.\nPageau wrote \"Every Note\" with his brother Marc around 2005. Marc wrote approximately 75 percent of the lyrics while Jean wrote the remaining 25 percent and the music. The song had been previously been submitted for consideration to be included on an album and it was decided to ultimately include it on Redemption.\n\"Pearls and Fire\" was written in parts over the span of many years, some of it being written approximately 20 years before the album was released. The song was inspired by the life of Léo Major, a French Canadian soldier who fought in World War II in the Netherlands. St-Père already had the music written for the song, but the lyrics had not been written yet when a fan suggested writing a song about Major's story to the band.\n\"Homecoming\" is the first song Michaud has a writing credit for on a Mystery album and like \"Every Note\" was also previously submitted to the band.\nWhile working on the album it was originally considered to split \"Is This How The Story Ends?\" into two parts, one to open the album and the other to close it.\n\n\n=== Cover art ===\nThe cover art for the album was produced by photographer and digital artist Kevin Carden. St-Père discovered Carden's work while looking for a cover for Lies and Butterflies.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe album reached number 5 on the Official Charts Independent Album Breakers Chart, number 18 on the Official Rock & Metal Albums Chart and number 45 on the Official Independent Albums Chart for the week of June 22 through June 28, 2023.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nJean Pageau - vocals, keyboards, flute\nMichel St-Père - electric and acoustic guitars, keyboards\nFrançois Fournier - bass guitar, Taurus pedals, keyboards, tambourine\nSylvain Moineau - electric and acoustic guitars\nJean-Sébastien Goyette - drums\nAntoine Michaud - keyboards, electric and acoustic guitars, growl vocals\nAdditional musician\nJohnny Maz - keyboards\n\n\n== Release information ==\nCD - Unicorn Digital - UNCR-5135 - 2023\nVinyl - Oskar - 049LP - 2023\n\n\n== References ==",

The other train involved, another passenger train identified as 324, was on its way to Zhengzhou when it also arrived at Rongjiawan Station \nThe 324 train entered Lane 4 with a green signal, but immediately activated the emergency brakes when it saw the 818 train already parked ahead. The 324 then rear-ended the 818. Around 3,000 passengers were involved in the collision.\n\n\n== Response ==\nFollowing the accident, between 1,000 and 2,000 police and rescue officers arrived at the scene of the accident and began the process of rescuing survivors and extracting bodies.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe death toll of the accident was listed as being at least 90. The cause of the accident was established as error on the behalf of the signalman.\n\n\n== References ==",

It was created in 2005, replacing an earlier commission called the National Observatory of Elections that was created in 1997.\n\n\n== Creation ==\nThe National Observatory of Elections was created on 8 September 1997 by president Abdou Diouf, under Law 95-15, during the Third wave of democratization. In 2005, president Abdoulaye Wade, replaced the National Observatory of Elections by the National Autonomous Electoral Commission (CENA), defined as a legally and financially independent agency under Law 2005-07 of 11 May 2005.\n\n\n== Membership ==\nCENA is legally defined to have twelve members, who have to have a reputation for independence and may not be members of political parties. The members are renewed by a third every three years, and each serve a period of six years.Moustapha Touré was the president of CENA in 2008. In November 2009, he resigned under pressure from Senegalese president Abdoulaye Wade.In late 2023, the terms of all twelve members of CENA had expired in January 2021. President Macky Sall named a new set of twelve members in November 2023, with Abdoulaye Sylla, a retired inspector-general as head, and Ndary Toure, a retired magistrate, as deputy head, under presidential decree. According to Radio France Internationale, the renewal was controversial because of a suspicion that it was a response to CENA being in favour of restoring opposition politician Ousmane Sonko to the electoral roll. Law professor Babacar Gueye described the choice of the new twelve members as being done \"unilaterally\" and that the inclusion of two people who had been members of Sall's political party would put in doubt the integrity of CENA's decisions. Fifteen citizens' associations called for the two former political party members to be replaced by people unaffiliated with political parties. A legal request under administrative law was filed on 13 November 2023 calling for the decree to be annulled.\n\n\n== Recommendations ==\nIn 2008, following the 2007 Senegalese parliamentary election, CENA recommended that electors' photographs be included on electoral registers and that the numbers of electors per polling booth be reduced.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "James Halley II (January 7, 1854 – February 28, 1920) was a Scottish-born American politician. He was affiliated with the Republican Party and served as mayor of Rapid City from 1884 to 1886. He served as a member of the final Dakota Territorial Legislature convened in 1889, before Dakota Territory was split and admitted to the Union as two states.\n\n\n== Early life and telegraphy career ==\nHalley was born on January 7, 1854, in Stirling. The Halley family moved to Washington, D.C. when James was two years old. Halley's education there included training in telegraphy, and he moved throughout the south at the age of sixteen, returning to Washington at the end of the year. For the following three years, Halley worked as a chief telegraph operator in Cheyenne, Wyoming Territory. Halley subsequently moved to the west coast, then to Omaha, Nebraska, before returning to Cheyenne in a matter of months. Halley was then hired by a private company. In 1876, he established a private telegraph line for this company between Cheyenne and the Black Hills, including Custer and Deadwood, Dakota Territory.\n\n\n== Settling in southern Dakota Territory ==\nHalley left the private telegraph company in 1879 to work as a teller for the First National Bank of Deadwood through 1880, after which he cofounded a bank in Rapid City. Halley's bank was merged into the First National Bank of Rapid City in 1884. He remained on the bank staff as a cashier until 1898, when he was named the bank's president. Halley also served as president of banks in Hot Springs and Keystone. Outside of the financial sector, Halley was president of the Rapid City Electric Light Company and treasurer of the Rapid River Milling Company.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nPolitically, Halley was affiliated with the Republican Party, serving as a central committee member of the South Dakota Republican Party and chaired its Pennington County Central Committee. He attended the Republican National Convention in 1892 and 1900. Between 1884 and 1886, he was mayor of Rapid City, and, in 1889, served in the upper house of the Dakota Territory's legislature, the Dakota Territorial Council.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nHalley died on February 28, 1920 in Battle Creek, Michigan.\nHalley Park, named for James Halley II, was established west of Rapid City in 1915. The city government acquired new land for the park in 1939.\n\n\n== References ==",

It is believed that she was the daughter of Haji Yaqub Bey, one of the nobles of Derbent. He received an excellent education for his time, engaged in horse riding and fencing.\nZarnigar started writing poems from an early age and took part in the deyishme (poetry competition) that are characteristic of Azerbaijani ashiq art. One of his famous deyishme was with Ashiq Loghman Khudatli. Later, he participated in the debate with Ashiq Valeh and was defeated. After this competition, Zarnigar and Valeh fell in love and got married. Zarnigar moved to Karabakh after his marriage.\nAshiq Zarnigar Derbentli died in 1840 in Abdal Gulabli village of modern Aghdam region. After her death, Ashiq Zarnigar was buried in the ancient cemetery in the village where she lived, next to her husband's grave. This poem is written on his headstone:\n\n\n== Creativity ==\nAshiq Zarnigar's qoshmas, geraylis, tajnis, mukhammas, qoshayarpaqqoshma, varsagi, etc., written in the form of ashiq poetry as a syllabic verse, have been preserved until today. \nThe work of Ashiq Zarnigar was reflected in the research work \"Azerbaijani literature\" published in German in Wiesbaden, by the Azerbaijani scholar Ahmed Jafaroğlu in 1964.\nThe list of famous works of Zarnigar Haji Yagub gizi, who stands out among Azerbaijani poets from Derbent, includes \"Gəl (Come)\", \"Valeh and Zarnigar\" epic, \"Taleh və Həqiqət (Fate and Truth)\" and \"Deyişmələr (poetic competition between Zarnigar and Valeh)\" works.\n\n\n=== \"Valeh and Zarnigar\" epic ===\nThe folk epic \"Valeh and Zarnigar\", one of the most famous examples of Azerbaijani oral folk art, was dedicated to the love of Valeh and Zarnigar. It is often performed not only at ashik events, but also at weddings, especially in rural areas.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nCəfərzadə, Əzizə, ed. (2005).

        "content": "Sande Church (Norwegian: Sande kirke) is a parish church of the Church of Norway in Holmestrand Municipality in Vestfold county, Norway. It is located in the village of Sande i Vestfold. It is the church for the Sande parish which is part of the Nord-Jarlsberg prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Tunsberg. The white, stone church was built in a long church design around the year 1150 using plans drawn up by an unknown architect. The church seats about 350 people.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1387, but the church was not built that year. The church is usually dated to between 1050 and 1150, or more precisely it is said to be built near the end of Olav Kyrre's time (1066–1093). The Romanesque stone church originally consisted of a rectangular nave and a smaller, rectangular chancel. In 1631, a new wooden bell tower was built on top of the nave roof. In 1665, the whole church was renovated. On 5 April 1783, a fire broke out in the rectory, which was right next to the church. As the rectory burned, the fire spread to the church and the whole church burned. After the fire, all that was left were the exterior stone walls, the baptismal font, some church silver from the altar, the altarpiece's two paintings, and a priest's chasuble. Over the next several years, the rubble was cleared and the church was rebuilt, re-using the old stone walls. As part of the rebuilding effort, a new wooden bell tower and church porch was constructed on the west end of the nave. A new wooden sacristy on the north side of the chancel was also constructed. Prior to the fire, the church only had 2 windows on the east end of the chancel, but during the rebuilding, 3 new windows were put in the south wall of the church.\nIn 1814, this church served as an election church (Norwegian: valgkirke). Together with more than 300 other parish churches across Norway, it was a polling station for elections to the 1814 Norwegian Constituent Assembly which wrote the Constitution of Norway. This was Norway's first national elections. Each church parish was a constituency that elected people called \"electors\" who later met together in each county to elect the representatives for the assembly that was to meet in Eidsvoll later that year.\n\n\n== Media gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of churches in Tunsberg\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Clacton-on-Sea Lifeboat Station is a Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) station located in the town of Clacton-on-Sea in the county of Essex. A lifeboat was first stationed here by the RNLI in 1878.\nThe station currently operates two Inshore lifeboats, a B-class (Atlantic 85), David Porter MPS (B-863), and a D-class (IB1), Damar's Pride (D-849).\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1870, the hamlet of Clacton Beach had a population of just 12. Just 10 years later, following rapid development to create a Victorian seaside resort, the population was over 1300. It was during this time of expansion that the Commander of HM Coastguard at Harwich wrote to the RNLI in 1877, to suggest a lifeboat be placed at Clacton-on-Sea, which was duly agreed.\nA boathouse was soon commissioned, and constructed on the corner of Carnarvon Road and Church Road. The RNLI would later erect a fence around the building \"to keep out stray cattle\".\nA 34-foot self-righting lifeboat was built by Woolfe boatbuilders. Costing £363, and funded by the Grand Lodge of Freemasons, the boat arrived in Clacton on 13 March 1878. Robert Legerton was appointed Coxswain, with Mr. Frederick Nunn appointed Honorary Secretary. In a parade including Freemasons, Mayors and Councillors in July 1878, the lifeboat was pulled to the new lifeboat house, where after the service of dedication by the Grand Chaplain of the Freemasons, the boat was named Albert Edward, the first of three Clacton lifeboats to carry this name.\nAfter only 4 years, it was decided that a bigger boat was required at Clacton. The boathouse was extended, and to make launching easier, two slipways were constructed, one on each side of Clacton Pier. The new lifeboat was 39-foot long, and built by Forrestt of Limehouse, London. Costing £635, she was again funded by the Freemasons of England, and also named Albert Edward (ON 32). The boat was kept in the boathouse in the summer, and on the pier during the winter months, launching down either slipway according to conditions.\nA new lifeboat arrived in Clacton in 1929, a twin engine 45ft 6in Watson-class named Edward Z Dresden (ON 707). She would serve Clacton until 1952. During this time, she would see service as one of the Little Ships of Dunkirk, and unusually, was crewed by her regular lifeboat crew for the trip. Damaged by gunfire, she was sent for repair after the Dunkirk evacuation, returning to be stationed at Brightlingsea, due to the demolition of the centre of Clacton Pier for wartime invasion preparations.\nClacton received D-107, the first of their small high speed D-class (RFD PB16) Inshore lifeboats in 1966. The station then received a second Inshore lifeboat, a larger twin engine B-class (Atlantic 21) in 1984, when it was announced that the All-weather lifeboat was being withdrawn, following difficulties encountered launching due to silt.\nIn October 2022, it was announced that the Atlantic 85 lifeboat would be withdrawn, and Clacton-on-Sea lifeboat station would once again receive an All-weather lifeboat, a new 25 knot Shannon-class lifeboat. The new boat is due on service in 2024.\n\n\n== Notable rescues ==\nOn the 23 October 1881, the Albert Edward was called to the aid of the French vessel Madeline. Having been towed to the scene by the Steamer Consett, the lifeboat set anchor, and attempted to veer down to the Madeline, with no success. When the cable was cut, the lifeboat was swept onto the deck of the casualty boat, damaging the rudder. The lifeboat finally dropped alongside the vessel, and each of the 16 crew were rescued one by one.\nCoxswain Robert Legerton was awarded the RNLI Silver Medal. Legerton and Second Coxswain James Cross were also to receive Gold Medals, and the remaining 11 crew receiving Silver Medals, awarded by The French Government.\nOn the 24th April 1914, the lifeboat Albert Edward (ON 463) was called out to the aid of Government Seaplane No.79, which was forced to ditch in the sea after engine trouble. The seaplane, subsequently towed to Harwich, was carrying the First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill.\n\n\n== Station Honours ==\nThe following are awards made at Clacton-on-Sea\n\nGold Medal, awarded by The French Government\nRobert Legerton, Coxswain - 1881\nJames Cross, Second Coxswain - 1881\nRNLI Silver Medal\nWilliam Wall Weekes, Master of the Fortitude  - 1828\nRobert Cleave, Master of the New Union  - 1830\nJohn Glover, Master of the Atalanta - 1843\nStephen Hurry, Master of the New Gypsy - 1843\nJohn Powell, Master of the  Lord Howe - 1843\nCpt.

        "content": "Nummi Church (Finnish: Nummen kirkko, Swedish: Nummis kyrka) is a Lutheran stone church in the former municipality of Nummi, situated in the Finnish city of Lohja in the Uusimaa region. Constructed of gray stone in 1822, the church was designed by Abraham Niklas Edelcrantz at the Royal Intendent's Office in Stockholm in 1807.\nNummi Church is located in the Diocese of Espoo and is owned by Lohja Parish. It is the largest church in the parish in terms of seating capacity.\n\n\n== History and Architecture ==\nNummi Church represents the neoclassical style and was completed in 1822. The current stone church replaced a 17th-century wooden church, which stood at the old graveyard of Nummi. Nothing remains of the former church except for a sacristy made of gray stone.\nThe church is shaped like a cross, with a tall bell tower attached to the eastern wall. The bell tower is adorned with a weathervane depicting the sun and the moon. On the roof's ridge, there are three crosses and a blazing sun, symbolising God's righteousness.\nIn 1922, following the church's centenary celebration, it underwent a significant restoration. During this restoration, the shape of the benches was altered, and the doors to the bench rows were removed. Additionally, stained glass windows designed by architect Ilmari Launis were installed in the choir of the church. The window on the southern wall depicts the death and suffering of Christ, while the window on the northern wall of the choir portrays Christ as victorious and as a king.\nIn the summer of 2008, lightning struck the bell tower of Nummi Church, igniting several fires there. The fire department was alerted to the church after the church caretaker called the emergency number shortly after four in the morning. The lightning strike had caused a malfunction in the automatic fire detection system, rendering the fire alarms inoperable. The church caretaker received a fault notification on his phone, which enabled him to call the fire department after climbing to the top of the Nummi Church tower to assess the situation.\nAs a result of the fire, the outer shell of the wooden hat of the tower had to be replaced.\n\n\n=== Decoration and Points of Interest ===\nThe two-part altarpiece was painted in 1825 by Axel Johan Fägerplan in Stockholm. In one panel, Jesus is depicted at the Last Supper, and in the other, Jesus is portrayed crucified\nThe pulpit of Nummi Church dates back to the wooden church built in 1635, which was later dismantled.\nThe facade of the organ, manufactured in 1864 by Gustaf Normann's organ factory in Tallinn, Estonia, still remains in the church, but its pipes are not operational. New organ were made by Kangasala Organ Factory in 1973, comprising 20 sets of pipes.\nThe oldest item in Nummi Church is a large crucifix, acquired from St. Lawrence's Church in Lohja, made in the late 1300s.\nThe church textiles were made by Impi Laaksonen in 1974.\nNummi Martha Association made the wedding ryijy for the church in 1955.\n\n\n=== Cemeteries ===\nThe old cemetery dates back to the 1600s. A newer one was established in the 1820s. The latest one was inaugurated on October 4, 2009. The memorial for fallen soldiers, depicting a wounded soldier wading through snow, was designed by Emil Filén in 1951.\n\n\n== Images ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Raimundo Gomes Vieira Jatahy (fl. 1830s) was an important Brazilian leader of the Balaiada. He was a vaqueiro who administered the plantation of Padre Inácio Mendes (a liberal, or bem-te-vi). The imprisonment of his brother, and Gomes' and their fathers freeing of said brother, was one of the catalysts that led to the Balaiada.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nGomes had passed through the village of Manga in Maranhão while taking an oxcart to sell items in another municipality. The vice-mayor of the village, José Egito, a conservative (or cabano) and political adversary of Padre Mendes, sent an order to recruit some men to accompany Gomes and to imprison his brother on 13 December 1838. In response, Raimundo Gomes and their father, Inácio Mendes, and nine other men, freed his brother and fled to Chapadinha, reinforcing his group with freed prisoners and 22 soldiers in charge of local policing operations. These actions would eventually lead to the creation of the Balaiada uprising throughout the Northeast of Brazil, as both Cosme Bento (a formerly enslaved man and a quilombo leader) and Manuel Francisco dos Anjos Ferreira (or Manuel Balaio, a local basketweaver) joined him and galvanized various groups in Maranhão and beyond.\nMany people in Maranhão, including enslaved people, free Black people, farmers, and vaqueiros, became the main groups of people involved in the Balaiada, which began in Maranhão, but later spread to the states of Piauí and Ceará. They were excluded from political life, with much of the population living in slavery. Together with the dire living conditions in the state, while also being forced to serve in the military, they rebelled in 1838 against the conservative elite, represented by large-scale property owners and military personnel. They fought against the troops of the Brazilian Empire for four years. After Manuel Balaio's death during the rebellion and Gomes' men were defeated by Luis Alves de Lima e Silva, the future Duke of Caxias, Cosme Bento assumed leadership of the movement. The strength of the \"balaios\" began to diminish as, in 1840, a large number of the rebels surrendered due to a concession deal being made. Shortly afterwards, the rest of the army surrendered. After he was captured, Cosme Bento was sentenced to death by hanging.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Vassås Church (Norwegian: Vassås kirke) is a parish church of the Church of Norway in Holmestrand Municipality in Vestfold county, Norway. It is located in the village of Vassås. It is one of the churches for the \"Hof, Vassås og Eidsfoss\" parish which is part of the Nord-Jarlsberg prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Tunsberg. The white, stone church was built in a long church design around the year 1200 using plans drawn up by an unknown architect. The church seats about 100 people.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe old medieval church was likely built in the late 12th century. The church originally consisted of a rectangular stone nave which had a choir in the same room, rather than a separate room like many other churches. Later, the building was enlarged. During the 17th century, a small church porch was built on the west end of the nave, to serve as a new main entrance to the building. In 1673, the church ownership was transferred from the King to the Count of Jarlsberg. In 1767, the Count sold the church to the local people of the parish for 175 rigsdaler. In 1846, a smaller, rectangular stone chancel was added onto the east end of the nave. At the same time, new second floor seating galleries were added along the west and north walls. In 1903, the church porch was torn down and a new stone church porch was built to replace it. In 1905, the second floor seating gallery on the north wall was removed. In 1983, the church porch was torn down and again replaced with a new wooden church porch.\n\n\n== Media gallery ==\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of churches in Tunsberg\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Styphelia oblongifolia is a species of flowering plant in the heath family Ericaceae and is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. It is an open or straggling shrub with erect, narrowly oblong leaves and pale yellow, tube-shaped flowers.\n\n\n== Description ==\nStyphelia oblongifolia is an open or straggling to erect shrub that typically grows to a height of 30 cm (12 in), its young branchlets densely covered with white hairs. The leaves are crowded, erect, narrowly oblong to narrowly egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, sharply-pointed, 5–18 mm (0.20–0.71 in) long and 2–4 mm (0.079–0.157 in) wide and more or less glabrous. The lower surface of the leaves is a paler shade of green and the edges are rolled down to almost rolled under. The flowers are pale yellow, arranged singly in upper leaf axils with a broadly egg-shaped, glabrous bracteole 2.6–4.5 mm (0.10–0.18 in) long and 2.5–3.5 mm (0.098–0.138 in) wide. The sepals are broadly egg-shaped, 5.5–10.5 mm (0.22–0.41 in) long and 2.6–3.7 mm (0.10–0.15 in) wide, pale yellow and hairy on the lower surface. The petals are joined at the base, forming a tube 6.0–9.5 mm (0.24–0.37 in) long, the lobes shorter than the petal tube. The style is 8.5–12 mm (0.33–0.47 in) long. Flowering mainly occurs in May and the fruit is elliptic about 5.5–6.5 mm (0.22–0.26 in) long and 3–4 mm (0.12–0.16 in) wide.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThis species was first formally described in 2013 by Annette Jane Gratton Wilson and Michael Clyde Hislop who gave it the name Astroloma oblongifolia in the journal Nuytsia from specimens collected by Hislop in the South Eneabba Nature Reserve in 2010. In 2020, Hislop, Darren Crayn and Caroline Puente-Lelievre transferred A. oblongifolium to Styphelia as S. oblongifolium in the journal Australian Systematic Botany. The specific epithet (oblongifolium) means \"oblong-leaved\".\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nThis species occurs in the Geraldton Sandplains, Jarrah Forest and Swan Coastal Plain bioregions of south-western Western Australia.\n\n\n== Conservation status ==\nStyphelia oblongifolia is listed as \"not threatened\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Canyon is a 23-story waterfront residential tower in the Mission Rock neighborhood of San Francisco, California. The site was previously a parking lot.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn October 2019, Netherlands-based designer MVRDV revealed the design renderings for a canyon-like tower to be constructed in San Francisco. Named The Canyon, the building is one of four that form the first phase of the Mission Rock development project, which was joint venture between the San Francisco Giants, Tishman Speyer and the Port of San Francisco. The building was MVRDV's first completed project on the West Coast.\nGroundbreaking for the construction began in December 2020 and continued through the COVID-19 pandemic. Construction was complete in early 2024 and an inauguration ceremony occurred on June 21, 2024. The ceremony was attended by Mayor London Breed, San Francisco Giants CEO Larry Baer, Elaine Forbes from the Port of San Francisco, and Carl Shannon from Tishman Speyer. Shannon used his time at the podium to advocate for cutting taxes and fees on development in San Francisco, while Mayor Breed discussed her strategy to meet state-mandated goals regarding increasing housing units.\n\n\n== Features ==\nIn view of Oracle Park, The Canyon consists of a 5-story base structure split diagonally and leading to a 23-story tower in the western corner of the plot. The ground floor is dedicated to space for small-scale commercial tenants and the two floors above that are offices. The rest of the building is residential units.\nThe building showcases several elements of MVRDV's common architectural language, including \"village\"-making, \"pixels\", and geology-inspired design. The exterior fascade is rugged, textured, and colored a distinct red-brown. The tower walls include jagged step-backs and overhangs, creating the illusion of steep rocky cliffs. Parts of the lower roof are landscaped to create communal spaces for residents.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Anno Domini 1989–1995 is the upcoming box set by British heavy metal band Black Sabbath, to be released on 31 May 2024. It includes four of five albums from the 1987–1997 Tony Martin-era of the band, with Headless Cross (1989), Tyr (1990) and Cross Purposes (1994) all remastered, and Forbidden (1995) remixed by guitarist Tony Iommi, making this the first time those albums have been reissued.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIommi mentioned re-releases of the Martin-era catalogue as early as March 2016, explaining, \"We've held back on the reissues of those albums because of the current Sabbath thing with Ozzy Osbourne, but they will certainly be happening... I'd like to do a couple of new tracks for those releases with Tony Martin... I'll also be looking at working on Cross Purposes and Forbidden.\" In February 2019, Iommi stated that he was working on a remix of Forbidden \"on and off\" with Mike Exeter. On 14 May 2020, in an interview with Eddie Trunk, Iommi stated that the remix of Forbidden was complete, but added that he was just waiting for \"the right time\" to release it.On 31 December 2023, Iommi announced that a Black Sabbath box set of Martin-era albums was due for release in May 2024. On 21 March 2024, Anno Domini 1989–1995 was revealed as the title of the box set and it was announced that it would be released on 31 May. The day after the box set was announced, the remastered versions of \"Headless Cross\" and \"Anno Mundi\" were released to streaming services, together as a two-song single.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe box set does not include The Eternal Idol (1987), Martin's debut with Black Sabbath, as it was released by Vertigo/Warner Bros. Records while I.R.S. Records released all the albums from Headless Cross to Forbidden (1992's Dehumanizer, which featured Ronnie James Dio instead of Martin, was released on I.R.S. in the UK while Reprise Records released it in North America).One track was added to three of the four discs. \"Cloak and Dagger\" from the Headless Cross disc was previously available as a B-side to the \"Headless Cross\" single, and also appeared as a bonus track on the vinyl picture disc edition. \"What's the Use?\" on Cross Purposes and \"Loser Gets It All\" on Forbidden were previously available as bonus tracks to the Japanese editions of the respective albums, while the latter also appeared on the 1996 compilation album The Sabbath Stones. Tyr is the only disc from the box set with no bonus material.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n=== Headless Cross ===\n\n\n=== Tyr ===\n\n\n=== Cross Purposes ===\n\n\n=== Forbidden ===\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "A red flag was a traditional signal used by slave traders of the United States to indicate that a slave auction was imminent.\nIn 1861, Richmond slave trader Hector Davis paid $16.95 for a secession flag to fly outside his business; according to historian Robert Colby, \"This was only the first of many gestures he made signaling his support for the fledgling Confederacy...Day by day, his secession flag flew alongside the red cloth square that signified an impending sale of slaves, the twin standards of the new Confederacy.\": 52  Among the items looted by Charles Carleton Coffin from Ziba Oakes' slave jail in 1865 was a red slave-sale flag. According to the Museum of African American History, \"Red flags outside slave sites signaled that enslaved people were 'ready for sale' and often had an inventory of the enslaved attached. Sometimes enslaved children were sent through the streets carrying the red flag and ringing a bell to announce a slave sale.\"\nIn an 1850 speech before New England Anti-Slavery Society, C. C. Burleigh painted an image of an injustice being done \"under the blended shadows of the red auction flag and the stripes of the Republic\". When Maryland passed the abolition of slavery in 1864, The Liberator reprinted an editorial from the Cincinnati Catholic Telegraph, that referred to both the red flag and the symbols on the flag of Maryland: \"We rejoice that Maryland, the cradle of the Catholic Faith in the United States, is now untarnished with slavery...and that the Cross, the true sign of liberty, more so than any banner that ever waved on earth, will no longer be insulted by looking down on the red flag of the auctioneer where men and women are offered for sale to the highest bidder.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nSlave markets and slave jails in the United States\nSlave trade in the United States\nSecession badge\nFlags of the Confederate States of America\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Hof Church (Norwegian: Hof kirke) is a parish church of the Church of Norway in Holmestrand Municipality in Vestfold county, Norway. It is located in the village of Hof. It is one of the churches for the \"Hof, Vassås og Eidsfoss\" parish which is part of the Nord-Jarlsberg prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Tunsberg. The white, stone church was built in a long church design around the year 110 using plans drawn up by an unknown architect. The church seats about 210 people.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1367, but the church was not built that year. The church was likely built in the second half of the 12th century. The building originally included a nave and chancel, which are both made of stone (with timber-framed gables). In 1662, a stone sacristy was built on the east end of the chancel. At some point, a church porch was added to the west end of the nave. Like other churches in the area, this one was owned by the Count of Jarlsberg from 1673 until it was sold to the parish in 1765 for 900 rigsdaler.In 1814, this church served as an election church (Norwegian: valgkirke). Together with more than 300 other parish churches across Norway, it was a polling station for elections to the 1814 Norwegian Constituent Assembly which wrote the Constitution of Norway. This was Norway's first national elections. Each church parish was a constituency that elected people called \"electors\" who later met together in each county to elect the representatives for the assembly that was to meet in Eidsvoll later that year.In 1815, the old church porch was replaced with a new one. In 1958, the church porch was torn down and a new wooden one was built in its place.\n\n\n== Media gallery ==\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of churches in Tunsberg\n\n\n== References ==",
