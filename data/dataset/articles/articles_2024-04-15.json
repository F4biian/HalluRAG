        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "The Estoppey D-series was a line of inter-war era bombsights developed by Georges Estoppey of the US Army Air Corps' McCook Field starting with the D-1 of 1922. A key feature was the use of a pendulum to keep the bombsight correctly oriented towards the ground even as the aircraft maneuvered, and dashpots to keep it from swinging around in turbulence. In testing in 1923, it proved more accurate than the US Navy's Mark III or the Army's Mk. I, and twice as accurate as the older Michelin bombsight designs. A series of minor updates led to the first widely used production model, 1925's D-4, of which several hundred were produced. The design was among the most advanced of its era but was still inaccurate to the point of being useless over 8,000 feet (2,400 m) altitude.\nEstoppey continued working on the design, introducing models for both the Army and Navy. The D-5 of 1929 was a very different design, using the new tachometric concept, but it proved to have even lower accuracy than the D-4 and was cancelled. The D-7 of 1931 was similar to the D-4 but added illumination for night use, an automatic pilot direction indicator that signalled the pilot which direction to turn, and automatic bomb release to improve timing. While effective, the Army was expecting production of the Sperry bombsight which offered dramatically better accuracy. When the Sperry proved difficult to produce, in 1938 the Army ordered a last production run of a much more basic update of the D-4 as the D-8, which was the most produced version with just over 10,000 produced.\nEstoppey became infamous for a lengthy and acrimonious series of legal battles with the Army and Navy over royalties for his concepts. As most of the designs were produced while he worked for the Air Corps, he was not eligible for royalties. On leaving their employ in 1926 he immediately began demanding fees from both the Army and the Navy, eventually receiving several thousand dollars.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early designs ===\nEarly bombsights were capable of calculating only the forward distance the bomb would move when dropped from a given altitude. To use these systems, the aircraft would first change its heading until it could see no further sideways drift of objects on the ground, indicating that the aircraft was flying in the same direction as the wind. The speed and current altitude were then entered into the bombsight, which would move a pointer fore and aft to indicate the correct spot to drop the bombs. They would then drop the bombs when the target passed through the indicator on the bombsight.\nEven while approaching directly along the wind line, the speed of that wind will have an effect. Consider an aircraft flying at 150 kilometres per hour (93 mph). Tests on a proving ground have demonstrated that at their current altitude, the bombs will take 20 seconds to reach the ground. That means the bombs, which leave the aircraft with the aircraft's forward speed, will travel 830 metres (2,720 ft) by the time they hit. If the plane is flying in a wind that is 20 kilometres per hour (12 mph) on its nose, its ground speed is only 130 km/h, and in this case, the bombs will travel only 720 metres (2,360 ft), missing by over 100 m.\nThe solution is to use a stopwatch as the aircraft approaches the target. The bomb aimer would pick a suitable object on the ground along the line of approach, perhaps the target itself, and then time it as it passed through two markers on the sight set at a fixed angle. The ground speed could then be calculated by looking up the speed on a table of times and altitudes, although some systems offered some level of automation for this task. Taking this measurement was not a trivial process, especially as almost all of these systems had to be operated by the pilot while looking downward through the sights and trying to keep the plane level at the same time. If the plane's angle changed even a few degrees during the process, the measurements would become meaningless.\n\n\n=== D-1 ===\nGeorges Louis Estoppey immigrated to the United States in 1916 and soon began work on a new bombsight that would address these issues. Estoppey came up with a system that would keep the sight correctly perpendicular to the ground using a pendulum, and then stabilized its motion using dashpots so it did not swing about after moving. He filed for three patents on the concept during World War I, and formed the Musa-Estoppey Company in New York to build them. He received the patents in March 1919, but the company failed in 1921.\nEstoppey then went to work for the Air Service Engineering Division at McCook Field, where he continued refining the design and introduced the first production-quality version as the D-1 in 1922. In tests at the Aberdeen Proving Ground the Army produced hit rates of 80% under standard conditions, concluding that it offered \"much greater accuracy than with the old Navy Mark III or Army Mark IA sights\" and that it was \"twice as accurate as the Michelin\". The Navy was also impressed, but only to the point of using a small number while they waited for newer developments of their own being carried out by Carl Norden to stabilize the Mark III. This led to an order for 16 D-1's, with two of those being sent to the Navy. Tests against the USS Virginia and USS New Jersey in 1923 led to a further order of 100, with 14 of those being sent to the Navy. Eventually, total production amounted to 114 from Pioneer Instrument Company for the Army and another 14 for the Navy from Eberhart Steel.\nIn use, the D-1 differed little from earlier bombsight designs like the Michelin. The bombardier would first watch the target move in relation to a vertical metal wire, and direct the pilot left or right until any sideways drift was seen to stop. At that point, he would watch the motion of the target along the wire until it crossed the line defined by two horizontal wires, the \"top wire\" and \"timing wire\". He would then begin turning a crank with his left hand which caused the timing wire to begin moving rearward while at the same time the rear sighting wire moved forward. They turned the crank to attempt to keep the timing wire in line with the target. When the watch indicated 15 seconds, he stopped cranking, thereby providing a measurement of the ground speed. This measurement left the upper wire positioned such that the ground speed had been accounted for. They then continued watching until the top wire aligned with the lower \"range wire\", and dropped at that instant.\n\n\n=== Basic updates, D-4 ===\nTiming the drop using the stopwatch proved to be a practical problem, and Estoppey began work on an automatic timer for the D-2. The Engineering Division purchased three prototypes from the Pioneer in 1925. The physical layout of the D-2 was significantly different than the D-1, with the sights in the center of a large U-shaped calculator. The two D-3 examples replaced the pendulum system of the D-2 with a gyroscopic platform from Sperry Gyroscope. Neither design proved to offer enough of an advance on the D-1 to warrant full-scale production.\nMeanwhile, in service, the D-1 proved to be too fragile for the rough handling of the crew, who were found to often use the bombsight as a handle while getting in and out of the aircraft. This led to the D-4, which was more robust and also included the automatic timing system. Because it was so similar to the earlier models, three prototypes were ordered and rapidly delivered, but the Army concluded they too represented too small an improvement to consider production, especially as they were now awaiting much more advanced designs. Those failed to emerge, and over the next five years, the Army ordered several batches of the D-4, amounting to 230 examples, with the Navy adding another 40 for low-altitude work.\nThe timing system on the D-4 greatly simplified operation. Instead of timing the motion for a fixed time, and then using that to calculate the needed setup, the system performed this automatically. When the crank wheel at the top of the sight was rotated backwards, it wound the timer up and prepared the fore and aft sights for use. On the side of the bombsight case was a table showing the time-to-drop and a sighting angle for different types of bombs released at different speeds and altitudes. The operator would then move the timing sight to an angle read on the table and then set the stopwatch to the given time. The operator then began turning the crank wheel when the target lined up, as before, and continued turning it to keep the target in the sights. However, the timer now automatically locked the crank when the stopwatch ran down, preventing them from missing the timer running out, as well as accidentally turning it after that point. The rear range sight wire was now in the proper location, no further adjustments or calculations were needed.\n\n\n=== New concepts ===\nIn addition to the minor updates to the original concept, Estoppey also worked on entirely new designs. The first and most developed of these was the D-5, which used the new \"synchronous\" or \"tachometric\" concept to time the drop. In contrast to the previous designs where the speed over the ground was measured directly with the stopwatch, in these designs the speed was measured by a ball-and-disk integrator system. The bombardier would first enter an estimate of the wind speed and direction based on previous measurements, generally by the navigator. This would cause the sights, a low-power telescope, to begin moving so that it would track an object on the ground. The bombardier would then adjust the initial estimate by turning dials to change the direction or speed until objects could be seen unmoving in the sight. At this point, the system held a highly accurate measurement of the ground speed and course. While this offered unparalleled accuracy in theory, in practice the D-5 proved less accurate than the D-4, and the Air Corps recommended that \"no further experimental work be done on the D-5 sight.\"\nThe next known version is the D-7, which used the same general mechanism as the D-4, but added several updates. Among these was an illuminated crosshair sighting system that was suitable for use at night, a system that automatically released the bombs at the right time to eliminate the delays in the bombardier pressing the release button, and a pilot direction indicator that was operated simply by turning the sight to point at the target. Although these were worthy updates, the expected imminent arrival of the more advanced designs from Sperry meant there was no reason to buy the D-7 in the meantime.\n\n\n=== D-8 ===\nThe final development of the line was the D-8, ordered due to ongoing production delays with the Sperry S-1 and Norden Mk. XV. The D-8 was a series of minor upgrades to the D-4 designed by its original manufacturer, Gaertner Scientific of Chicago. These allowed it to operate at higher speeds and altitudes of the new aircraft being introduced. After Gaertner supplied 80 hand-assembled units, the Army sent a production contract to National Cash Register (NCR) for 15,000 units immediately after the Attack on Pearl Harbor, at $200 a unit. In testing against the Norden, the D-8 managed 3 hits for 50 bombs dropped, compared to 48 out of 50 for the Norden. Aware of its limits, the Army nevertheless sent it to \"airplanes for which no other sight is available.\"\nThe Army continued to press for faster deliveries of the Norden, but the Navy vacillated on allowing production to begin at other plants, fearing doing so would upset production at the main Norden plant and delay their own deliveries. At a meeting on 11 November 1942, the Army complained that while they were taking every Norden they could and immediately placing them in an airplane, the Navy had more sights than planes and were simply stockpiling their Nordens in warehouses. Meanwhile, the Navy would promise to deliver a certain quantity of sights for a given month, so the Army would adjust their aircraft orders to match, only to receive a different number and either have missed the opportunity to produce more than a month, or have to deliver them with \"this damb D-8 sight that I would just as soon have a couple of nails and a wire.\"\nAfter enormous arguments and inter-service rivalries, the issue of the Norden was ultimately solved unexpectedly when the Navy concluded it couldn't hit ships anyway. They turned their attention to the use of dive bombers and torpedo bombers, like most other Naval aviation forces, and gave up entirely on the use of high-altitude bombing against ships. The entire production was given over to the Army. By this time, NCR was in full production of the D-8, with 2,000 being delivered a month. Although the contract was cancelled in October 1943, 10,000 had already been produced by this point. These were then sent, along with another 2,000 D-4Bs, to the Soviet Union as part of the Lend Lease.\n\n\n=== Lawsuits ===\nIn 1924, Estoppey demanded that he be paid royalties for his designs. Air Service chief Major General Mason Patrick refused, based on the fact that they had been designed and built while Estoppey was in the employ of the Air Corps. His contract did have an allowance for up to 7.5% royalties up to a maximum of $7,500 (equivalent to $133,340 in 2023), but these could only be paid on devices that were sold after he left government service. Estoppey did so in July 1926, and that resulted in payments of $2,887 in 1927 and $2,600 in 1932.\nWith no more devices being built on his designs after that date, he turned his attention to the Navy, claiming that the Norden Mark XI \"fall within the disclosures and scope of my patents.\" The Navy disagreed, noting that they purchased the Mark XI specifically because it allowed attacks on moving targets, something the Estoppey never solved. Nevertheless, they agreed to pay $2,000 for the use of patent 1,296,640.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nMcFarland, Stephen Lee (1995).

        "content": "The Château des Matignon (also named the ‘château de Torigni’) is a former princely residence located in Torigni-sur-Vire in the Manche department, Normandy, northwestern France. The southern wing that you see today is all that remains of the castle from the 16th and 17th centuries. Originally, there were three wings enclosing a main courtyard that opened to the west, but it suffered substantial damage during the French Revolution. The castle's history is closely related to the Matignon family and the princely family of Monaco, the House of Grimaldi. Presently, the château is owned by the local municipality, serving both as its administrative offices and as a museum.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nIn the 12th century a castle was erected on the very spot where the present château stands. It belonged to Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester (1090–1147), an illegitimate son of King Henry I of England and half-brother of the Empress Matilda, who he supported during the civil war known as the Anarchy. Robert gained possession of Torigni castle through his marriage to Mabel FitzRobert, daughter and heir of Robert Fitzhamon. He enhanced the castle's defenses by adding towers and ramparts surrounded by ditches. Moreover, a substantial water barrier surrounded the castle, rendering it nearly impregnable.\nOn 12 May 1203, the Bretons, allies of the French king Philipp II, ruined the castle during a raid into Normandy. But it is rebuilt afterwards. Also, during the Hundred Years' War, the castle is captured by knights of the English king Edward III.\nDuring the Middle Ages, the ownership of the castle and its surrounding domain passed into the hands of the ‘De Mauny’ family. The last descendant and heiress of this lineage, Marguerite Mauny, married Jean de Goyon de Matignon in 1421. This marks the establishment in Normandy of the Goyon de Matignon family, who were originally from Brittany . The castle itself is then made up of three wings surrounding a courtyard. Jean's son, Bertrand IV, had his services for France rewarded with an elevation of Thorigny to a barony. Later in the 16th century, Thorigny becomes a county.\n\n\n=== 16th and 17th centuries ===\nJacques I de Goyon de Matignon and his son Jacques II (1525–1598) transform the medieval castle into a Renaissance-style residence. Significant portions of the medieval fortifications are dismantled to accommodate the construction of the new castle. They create over time two pavilions which are connected by a long gallery, based on plan by master mason François Gabriel. Charles, the son of Jacques II, adds a third pavilion and second wing at the start of the 17th century. Around 1630, the château reaches its completion.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 18th century ===\nAt the start of the 18th century, Jacques III (1644-1725) further embellished the château: a large park was created including a magnificent cascade. His son, Jacques IV (1689–1751) makes the connection to Monaco, as he marries Louise Hippolyte, Princess of Monaco (1697–1731), the heiress to the throne of Monaco. In 1731, Jacques IV became Jacques I, prince of Monaco, establishing a lasting connection between the Matignon and Grimaldi families. The Prince of Monaco still bears the title ‘baron of Thorigny’.\nBoth prince Jacques I and his son prince Honoré III (1720–1795) did not spend much time in Monaco. Their primary residences were the Hôtel Matignon in Paris (the current official residence of the Prime Minister of France) and the Château des Matignon as the summer residence. Antoine Grimaldi, le Chevalier de Grimaldi, (1697–1784) acted as a regent in Monaco for the absent prince between 1732 and 1784.\n\n\n=== French Revolution and Napoleonic times ===\nIn December 1793, during the French Revolution, the property of the Grimaldi family of Monaco was confiscated, and the castle was transformed into a prison, a dark period that lasted until January 1795.\nIn March 1805, the castle was put up for auction and acquired by General Santerre (1752–1809). However, his attempts to secure the necessary funds fell short, leaving the iconic residence once again on the market. Ultimately, it was bought by a real estate agent for the sum of 1.6 million pounds. With the winning bid secured, a wave of radical changes swept through the property. Two wings of the château were demolished. Forests were cleared, the greenhouse was dismantled, and the cascades were obliterated, signalling the end of a lavish era.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\nIn 1817, under leadership of the mayor at the time, Mr. Chartier de la Varignière, a pivotal decision is made: He convinced the municipal council to purchase the only remaining wing of the castle with the intention of converting it into a town hall.\nAround 1840, the municipality erected the east pavilion aiming to reinstate the architectural equilibrium disrupted by previous demolitions. Today, this pavilion plays a crucial role in safeguarding the harmony and heritage of this remarkable structure.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nOn 12 June 1944, after the town centre of Torigni was bombarded, only four walls of the château remained. The efforts of successive town councils to restore the castle, while not returning it to its original splendour, have ensured that it remains an impressive historic monument.\nSince then, the efforts of various municipalities have been focused on the restoration of the castle. In 2004, the castle's clock, stopped at the time of the 1944 bombing, was restored to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Today, the castle houses municipal offices and exhibition rooms.\n\n\n== See also ==\nChâteau de Marchais\nHotel Matignon\nPalazzo Spinola di Pellicceria\nPrince's Palace of Monaco\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Literature ==\nGuillot, Gaétan (1899). \"Le château de Torigny\".

It is part of the Magdalen Islands archipelago, in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Quebec, Canada.\nThe first settlers came to Havre-aux-Maisons, in 1765 from Acadia. The island was first known as Allright Island, then Alwright, and then Saunders, after Sir Charles Saunders, a British admiral who accompanied General James Wolfe to Quebec City in 1759. The harbour between Grindstone and House Harbour islands was already known in 1756 as Harbour Maison. Since nobody lived on the island before 1765, the singular form for Maison could be attributed to the ruins of a habitation built by early Basque visitors and found by French explorers in 1663. Its population, as of 2006, was 2,078.\nÎles-de-la-Madeleine Airport, Magdalen Islands' only port of entry by air, is located at Havre-aux-Maisons.\nThe hamlet of Dune-du-Sud, northeast of Havre-aux-Maisons, is a Hydro-Québec experimentation site to assess power lines' resistance to high winds. In 1993, it built a vertical-axis windmill, but the project did not go further past the experimental level. The windmill is now purely decorative.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Havre-Aubert located on Île du Havre Aubert is a village in the municipality of Les Îles-de-la-Madeleine. It is part of the Magdalen Islands archipelago, in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Quebec, Canada.\nHavre Aubert Island is made up of two main localities, Havre-Aubert and Bassin, subdivided into hamlets: Portage-du-Cap, La Baie, La Montagne, L'Anse-à-la-Cabane, former name Millerand, and L'Étang-des-Caps.Amherst Island's first settlers arrived in 1762 from Acadia, Prince Edward Island and the Chaleur Bay. A municipality, Havre-Aubert, was constituted in 1875 and changed its name to Bassin in 1959. Another municipality, Havre-Aubert-Est, was constituted in 1951 and changed its name to Havre-Aubert in 1964. Both amalgamated in 1971 and took the name of L'Île-du-Havre-Aubert. The island is a member of the Association of the Most Beautiful Villages of Quebec.\n\n\n== History ==\nReturning from France in 1626, Samuel de Champlain would have spent a night in the Pleasant Bay  he would have given the name \"Aubert\" to the southernmost island of the Magdalen Islands. An English map of 1756 identifies the places Harbour Ober, the name Amherst was given to the post office between 1899 and 1907, Amherst Island became Havre-Aubert in 1907.Historians do not agree on the origin of the name \"Havre-Aubert.\" Some suggested the name of an obscure friend of Jacques Cartier, while others brought up Thomas Aubert, a sailor from Dieppe and one of the Americas' first explorers, or François Aubert de La Chesnaye, who would have supported the colonization efforts of New France, as likely explanations. Some have mentioned a family of sailors named \"Auber\" and other hypotheses include that of French explorer Jean-François Roberval, who would have stayed on the island in 1542, having named it \"Havre au Ber,. The term \"ber\" itself meaning, in this case,  \"berceau\" (cradle in English, while \"havre\" is French for harbour). Roberval's child was still a baby at the time; although, in terms of an explanation, this is really nothing but speculation and hearsay. It probably references the ``high quality`` of port; in layman`s terms.\nHowever, \"ber\" is also a marine term designating the wood structure on which a boat lies during construction or reparation. Yet, while this is an interesting fact to note, it is likely to be a simple slang term in French to reference the berceau, heard and used in conversation by the anglophone population over the years. Meanwhile, an anonymous British map of the area in 1756 named it Harbour Ober, which was in all likelihood, an anglicization of french-origin place-names.  The post office, opened in 1899, bore the name \"Amherst Island\" until 1907.\nIn 2000, a new municipality named L'Île-du-Havre-Aubert was constituted following the amalgamation of L'Île-du-Havre-Aubert and the village of L'Île-d'Entrée. Entry Island is the only inhabited island part of the Magdalen Islands unconnected to the rest of the archipelago by land. It is located 5 km (3.1 mi) east of Amherst Island and it is one of the three English-speaking centres of the archipelago. It saw its first inhabitants in the early 19th century.\nEntry Island owes its name to the fact that it is located at the southeast entrance of the archipelago. A ferry service exists between Entry Island and the village of Grindstone.\n\n\n== References ==",

Sharpley began working on a farm, but soon became homeless. He learned about politics and economics in the State Library Victoria. He got a job in an advertising agency in 1933, and joined the Federated Clerks' Union of Australia and the Australian Labor Party the following year.\nIn 1935, Sharpley joined the Communist Party of Australia (CPA). On 9 April 1938, he married machinist Veronica Theresa Connolly in Melbourne. On 21 December 1948, he left the CPA and fled to Shepparton. To denounce the party, he worked with journalists of The Herald on a 7-article long investigative journalism piece on the CPA, accusing them of election fraud, with the first being published on 16 April 1949. After a report by Charles Lowe was published, Sharpley's evidence was found unreliable.\nOn 19 December 1949, he returned to England to his wife, finding a job as an insurance salesman. He also became a Christian. He died on July 6, 1985, of a coronary occlusion at Islington, aged 76.\n\n\n== Bibliorgraphy ==\nSharpley, C. H. (Cecil H. (1952).

        "content": "Antes do Baile Verde (Before the Green Ball) is a Brazilian short story written by Lygia Fagundes Telles and originally published by Editora Bloch in 1970. It is considered one of the most important publications by the author, who began her career in the 1970s. The book brings together contemporary realist short stories of an intimate nature, reflecting characteristics of the third modernist generation and Concretism. \nComposed of eighteen short stories, written between 1949 and 1969, the book deals with themes such as adultery, marital dissatisfaction, madness, and the demystification of family roles, with characters from middle-class urban Brazilian families who hide dramas and conflicts. Before the Green Ball was distributed under Emílio Garrastazu Médici, during the military dictatorship, and soon after it was published it won the International Women's Grand Prize for Foreign Short Stories.   \nHer short story work consolidated her career, earning her the Guimarães Rosa Prize in 1972 and the Coelho Neto Prize in 1973. In addition to this, other short stories by Lygia enabled her to be chosen for chair number sixteen of the Brazilian Academy of Letters, founded by Machado de Assis. In 1993, O Moço do Saxofone, one of the stories in Antes do Baile Verde, was adapted for television in an episode of the series Retrato de Mulher.\n\n\n== Background and context ==\n\n\n=== Literary scope ===\nModernism in Brazil began with the Modern Art Week in 1922. One of its characteristics was the abandonment of past perspectives and formal freedom, bringing speech and writing closer together, even in the first generation, in which Oswald de Andrade, Mário de Andrade and Manuel Bandeira stood out. The existential concern of man in the world and his social relations gained ground in Brazilian literary production, clearly seen in the second modernist phase, in which Carlos Drummond de Andrade, Vinicius de Moraes, Cecília Meireles, Graciliano Ramos, Jorge Amado and Rachel de Queiroz, for example, reflected on the socio-political context of the time.The socio-political scenario led to an even more explicit change in literature from 1945 onwards when the third generation began. João Cabral de Melo Neto published Morte e vida severina, a poetic work that criticized land concentration. In poetry, Concretism also stood out, an artistic movement that broke with lyricism and began to extend the meaning of poems to the typographic arrangement of words. Décio Pignatari and the brothers Augusto de Campos and Haroldo de Campos were some of the exponents of this movement.Ferreira Gullar also took part in the concretist movement, but expanded the meanings of his poems through an engaged exposition in his texts. At the same time, Guimarães Rosa wrote Grande Sertão: Veredas, a work that gives voice to the sertanejo and describes, in monologue, the long journey of jagunços through Minas Gerais, Goiás and Bahia. Another post-modern writer, Clarice Lispector, exposed a recurring structure in her prose that would lead to the production of short stories: a character is in a routine condition and is disturbed by an event; some external element makes her return to normality (epiphany) and, with this, she \"discovers\" her true identity. The intimate poetry, stream of consciousness and feminine introspection also used by Lispector were used by Lygia Fagundes Telles throughout her literary career.\n\n\n=== Social sphere ===\nAfter the end of the World War II (1939-1945), the European continent began a gradual process of reconstruction during human destruction. Existentialist philosophy, therefore, stood out as an analysis of individual issues, especially with the start of the Cold War, which divided the world into two blocs: capitalist (led by the United States) and socialist (led by the Soviet Union). In Brazil, Getúlio Vargas resigned in 1945, after fifteen years in power, and then Eurico Gaspar Dutra won the elections, initiating a developmental policy in the country, on the side of the capitalist bloc. In 1951, Vargas returned to power democratically, but his term did not end because he committed suicide in 1954, in the face of scandals involving his name in the Tonelero Street bombing. In 1955, Juscelino Kubitschek proposed accelerated industrial growth and consequent urban growth; in 1960, Jânio Quadros was elected president, but resigned after controversy over his plans. With Quadros' resignation, his vice-president João Goulart took office and sought to implement left-wing policies.The cultural scene reflected the changes that had taken place in society, especially the movement of people from the countryside to the city. The Teatro Brasileiro de Comédia (Brazilian Comedy Theater) was created in São Paulo, which revealed numerous actors (such as Grande Otelo, Dercy Gonçalves and Tônia Carrero); its repercussions led to the creation of the Companhia Cinematográfica Vera Cruz (Vera Cruz Film Company), a pioneer in Brazilian film production. Still in the media context, television, broadcast by Assis Chateaubriand in 1950, impressed the population and changed the country's artistic production.The concept of \"post-modernity\" directed the focus of art towards human and social relations, due to the spread of the concepts of social class, ideology and egalitarianism. A new literary vision was further intensified by the counter-revolution, called for by conservative sectors of the Catholic Church, influential politicians, landowners, the industrial bourgeoisie and part of the middle class, by the Armed Forces to remove Goulart from power and establish what would become the military dictatorship, which began with the coup of 1964. As a response to the fierce censorship, marginal poetry and intimate-existentialist prose spread, including Antes do Baile Verde, by Lygia Fagundes Telles.\n\n\n== Features ==\n\n\n=== Structure ===\nBefore the Green Ball is not subdivided into chapters or smaller parts; only the eighteen stories are inserted. In the original edition, they are presented respectively: The Objects, Green Yellow Lizard, Only a Saxophone, Helga, The Saxophone Boy, Before the Green Ball, The Hunt, The Key, Midnight in Shanghai, The Window, A Very Strong Tea and Three Cups, The Wild Garden, Christmas on the Barge, The Supper, Come See the Sunset, I Was Dumb and Alone, The Pearls and The Boy.The original version also contains a letter written by Carlos Drummond de Andrade to Lygia Fagundes Telles in 1966:\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n=== Language ===\nThe language of Antes do Baile Verde changes according to the theme of each story. In general, there is an engaged tone as a veiled denunciation of social inequality and opposition to the military regime in Brazil; the widespread presence of free indirect speech to emphasize the psychological analysis made of the characters and the use of numerous figures of speech, such as metaphor, personification, and sarcasm.Synesthesia is one of the main figures of speech used in Telles' short stories: the color green is constantly cited as a reference to the passage from life to death. Linguistic variations are also used to represent the characters portrayed according to their social level and the communication situation. Two other striking features of Lygia's literature are ambiguity and irony, also present in Ciranda de Pedra (1954) and As Meninas (1973), in which the writer establishes the internal conflicts of a man living in society.\n\n\n=== Style and theme ===\nChronologically, Lygia Fagundes Telles belongs to the modernist generation of 1945, alongside Guimarães Rosa, Clarice Lispector, Rubem Braga and Dalton Trevisan; therefore, there is an influence of stream of consciousness and epiphany, resources used by these writers. The author's short stories also reflect the style of Edgar Allan Poe, a romantic American writer. In addition, there is a great deal of space for female figures in her works, with hatred, jealousy, and loneliness as recurring themes. The writer constructs a feminine perspective on reality and the human inner world. In general, her characters are restless and vulnerable beings, instruments of psychological reflection, who move about in apparent spontaneity, as an ironic representation of society.\nThe focus of his short stories is not so much on the action and movement of the characters, but rather on human questions, which are implicitly questioned to explore the internal conflicts of man in society. The personalities shown in the texts of Antes do Baile Verde are intimate, psychologically introspective, and strongly individualized, to construct an identity that produces a real effect.Among the most popular stories in the book, The Objects exposes a conflict between a couple with a frayed relationship, in which the wife shows no interest in the affairs of her husband, who is emotionally unbalanced; Only a Saxophone tells the monologue of a selfish prostitute who never forgets a saxophone player; Before the Green Ball shows the selfishness of a daughter who would rather go to the ball than take care of her sick father; The Hunt expresses a man's fantastic adventure in front of a tapestry; Christmas on the Ferryboat promotes a biblical intertext with the birth of Jesus; and Come See the Sunset narrates a dialogue, in a tone of mystery, between ex-boyfriends who meet in a cemetery at dusk. \nOf the eighteen stories, only two feature exclusively male characters: Verde Lagarto Amarelo and A Caçada. On the other hand, seven of them feature exclusively female characters, demonstrating that Lygia focuses more on the personality of women in society. In addition, almost all the stories have an ending without an explicit ending.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe book, published in 1970, received numerous positive reviews. The writer Caio Fernando Abreu said, in Before the Green Ball, that Lygia Fagundes Telles \"[is] basically a storyteller, in the best and broadest meaning of the expression\". Literary critic Suênio Campos de Lucena classifies the characters into three categories: \"characters who want to forget, but can't; characters who would like to remember; and characters who remember nostalgically; it is also possible to think of a fourth category: those who remember painfully. The memory of pain and rejection is dominant in the writer's texts, which work with this tension between remembering and forgetting. The characters, almost always disintegrated/corrupted by stressful family relationships or by society itself, find themselves dealing with memories they wanted to forget, with their fragmented experiences, a past that torments them, a reminiscing that never stops\".Professor and essayist Silviano Santiago says that \"a short and succinct definition of Lygia's short stories would say that their most salient characteristic is the difficulty human beings have in establishing bonds\". The reviewer and critic Paulo Rónai also gave a favorable opinion of the eighteen short stories in Antes do Baile Verde: \"these masterpieces, of such deep intimate restlessness and which exude such profound despair, gain the classic serenity of definitive art forms\". Antonio Candido, professor at the Faculty of Philosophy, Letters and Human Sciences at the University of São Paulo, pointed out that \"Lygia has always had the high merit of obtaining, in the novel and the short story, the clarity appropriate to a vision that penetrates and reveals, without resorting to any trickery or heavy-handedness in language or characterization\".\n\n\n== Publications ==\n\n\n=== Editions ===\nOriginally published in the Estória Collection by Editora Bloch in 1970 in Rio de Janeiro, Antes do Baile Verde is a 237-page collection of short stories written by Lygia Fagundes Telles between 1949 and 1969. Basically, the narratives in the book were written in São Paulo and Águas de São Pedro. Shortly after its release, it was awarded the International Women's Grand Prize for Foreigners in France.Other publishers distributed Lygia's work keeping the full text: Círculo do Livro in 1971; Livraria José Olympio Editora in 1983; Nova Fronteira in 1986; Editora Rocco in 2008 and Companhia das Letras on April 23, 2009. Later editions were published with changes in line with the 1990 Orthographic Agreement.\n\n\n=== In other countries ===\nAntes do Baile Verde was published in its original language in Portugal by Livros do Brasil. The short stories As Pérolas (Pearls) and A Chave (The Key) were translated into Italian and Polish, respectively, in works featuring Brazilian narratives. The entire book was published in France and the Czech Republic under the titles Un Thé bien fort et trois tasses and Pred zelenym bálem.\n\n\n== Adaptations ==\nThe only short story adapted from Before the Green Ball was The Saxophone Boy, which tells the story of a chauffeur who takes up residence in a boarding house, where he is disturbed by the indigestible food, some dwarves who are also staying there and a sad saxophone song. The protagonist therefore sets out to find out who the saxophone player is. With its strong introspective character, the text was staged in the episode \"Once Upon a Time... Valdete\", from the series Retrato de Mulher, shown on Rede Globo in 1993.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLygia Fagundes Telles\nModernism in Brazil\nModern Art Week\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nLamas, Berenice (2004).

On April 15, Pereda was selected to the 40-man roster and promoted to the major leagues for the first time.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCareer statistics and player information from Baseball Reference (Minors)",

        "content": "Sarah Bormann (born 27 April 1990) is a German professional boxer. Bormann has been active as a professional since 2017 and has been world champion in the minimumweight and light flyweight divisions. She was previously active as an amateur in the German Boxing Association (DBV). She fought over 121 amateur fights, was a four-time German champion and boxed in the German national squad from 2010 to 2017.\n\n\n== Professional career ==\nBormann made her professional debut on 15 December 2017 against Kitti Kolompar. She won that bout by TKO after just 34 seconds in the first round. Already in the 5th fight, Bormann boxed for the international German championship of the BDB (Bund Deutscher Berufsboxer e.V.) and for the Intercontinental championship of the WIBF (Women's International Boxing Federation) and GBU (Global Boxing Union).In her 6th bout, Bormann won the WIBF and GBU light flyweight world championship.After successful title defenses against Evgeniya Zablotskaya and Sanae Jah, Bormann also won the WBF world title against Anne Sophie Da Costa in 2019.After another successful title defense against Lotta Loikannen, Bormann was unable to fight for 16 months due to the COVID-19 pandemic.In May 2021, Bormann dropped down a weight class and competed in Belgrade at minimumweight for a fight for the WBC Interim, WIBF, GBU and WBF World Championships against Catalina Diaz, which she won unanimously on points.The WBC interim title was later changed to the Silver title due to internal disagreements between the WBC and the promoter.Exactly one year later, in May 2022, Bormann boxed against Ana Arrazola for the WBC Silver title and the IBO minimumweight world championship. Bormann also won this fight unanimously on points, despite a heavily bleeding cut above her forehead that was inflicted on her in the third round by Arrazola's headbutt.In September 2022, Bormann defended her WBC (World Boxing Council) Silver title unanimously on points against Elizabeth Lopez Corzo. After the fight, Bormann relinquished her IBO world title and thus got the chance in May 2023, after which she was the number one mandatory challenger at the WBC for more than two years (2021 light flyweight and 2021-2022 minimumweight). to box for the interim world title against the previously undefeated Yadira Bustillos. Bormann also won this fight unanimously on points and became interim WBC world champion. Just a month later, Bormann successfully defended her WBC title against Perla Perez. This fight was also for the IBF interim world title, as Bormann was number one in this association for more than three years in two weight classes (2019-2020 light flyweight, 2022-2023 minimum weight).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBoxing record for Sarah Bormann from BoxRec (registration required)",

        "content": "The Maltings is a historic pub on Tanner's Moat in York.\nThe pub opened in 1842 as the Railway Tavern, a short walk from York railway station, which had opened the previous year.  The opening of Lendal Bridge nearby increased its trade, although the relocation of York railway station reduced it.  In light of these changes, in 1885 it was renamed the \"Lendal Bridge Hotel\".\nThe building had rooms for travellers, and was sometimes referred to as an inn.  It was also occasionally used to hold inquests into deaths.  In 1902, it was recorded as having a smoke room, a tap room, and a serving bar.\nThe pub was acquired by Bass Brewery, which sold it in 1992 to Anita Adams.  Its new landlord, Shaun Collinge, the nephew of Adams, remained in post for more than thirty years.  The building was extended in 2012, following which it was painted black, leading Nathen Amin to describe it as \"one of York's most distinctive pubs\".  It stocked a wide range of real ales, up to 60 a month, leading to it regularly appearing in the Campaign for Real Ale's Good Beer Guide.  For two years in a row, it was named national Cask Ale Pub of the Year by the Morning Advertiser.  In 2023, The Guardian described it as Britain's \"strictest pub\", based on its prohibition of singing, hen and stag parties, fancy dress, and swearing.\nThe pub was put up for sale in 2023, at a price of £1.5 million, reduced in 2024 to £1.35 million.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website",

The highest placement they obtained was the first runner-up, won by Oihana Torres in 2022.\n\n\n== History ==\nEuskadi debuted in the Miss Grand Spain pageant in 2018 after the license for Miss Grand Euskadi pageant was granted to Muevete Producciones led by Samuel Benasco, who later held the first contest of Miss Grand Euskadi, consisting of candidates from 23 municipalities, on April 28, 2018, at the Hotel Gran Bilbao, Bilbao, in which a 19-year-old Ane Álvarez Alcántara was named the first Miss Grand Euskadi. Ane later represented Euskadi in the Miss Grand Spain 2018 pageant but was unplaced.\nSome titleholders were also sent to compete at other international pageants, such as the 2020 winner, Sara Lahidalga, who later represented Spain in the Reina Hispanoamericana 2024 pageant in Bolivia.\n\n\n== Editions ==\nThe following table details Miss Grand Euskadi's annual editions since 2018.\n\nNote\n\n\n== National competition ==\nThe following is a list of Basque Country representatives who competed at the Miss Grand Spain national pageant.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Miss Grand Spain at Wikimedia Commons\nMiss Grand Spain official website",

        "content": "EV.com Inc., commonly known as EV.com, is an online electric vehicle marketplace company founded in 2022 by Yale University alumni Joel Li, that facilitates the buying and selling of new and used electric vehicles by retailers such as Hertz Global Holdings, one of the three big rental car holding companies in the United States.\nThe company has been the subject of serious controversy related to its partnerships. A 2022 agreement between General Motors (GM) and Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. intended to supply 175,000 electric vehicles over five years encountered delays due to issues with GM's battery factory, causing significant impact on EV.com's inventory.\nIn January 2024, when Hertz decided to shift its strategy and sell roughly 20,000 of its electric vehicles that are predominately Tesla cars, outlets such as Auto Trader (in the United Kingdom) and EV.com (in the United States) flooded the EV second-hand market causing market saturation and price pressure on consumers and automarkers.\nEV.com has also been criticised for contributing to the greenwashing efforts by car manufacturers like General Motors (GM) and Volkswagen.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history: twentieth century ===\nOn July 26, 1994, the two-letter dot-com domain name ev.com was registered, being one of only 676 domain names of its kind in existence.\n\n\n=== 21st century and evolution into a marketplace for electrical vehicles ===\nIn June 2022, a privately held Canadian automotive company acquired the domains ev.com, ev.ca, ev.de and ev.fr in a sale worth an estimated 8,500,000 US dollars, with ev.com becoming one of the only 99 publicly reported sales of a two-letter dot-com domain name in internet history.\nOn September 20, 2022, EV.ca Inc. was incorporated in Canada, listing its founder Joel Li, an alumnus of the Yale University, on its board of directors. The parent company, just two days later, was incorporated in Delaware, United States on September 22, 2022, as EV.com Inc.\nIn January 2023, Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. (commonly known as Hertz), signed a partnership agreement with the company to allow its newly acquired fleet of electric vehicles to be sold on EV.com's online marketplace.\nIn March 2024, the Canadian subsidiary of the company, EV.ca Inc., rebranded and changed its legal name to EV.com Corp. (trading as EV.com), to match its parent company in the U.S.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\nIn September 2022, General Motors (GM), announced a partnership where the car manufacturer would sell 175,000 electric vehicles to the rental car giant, Hertz, over the next five years, allowing Hertz to sign a deal with EV.com. General Motors (GM), however, quickly ran into problems with its struggling battery factory, putting the partnership it had announced with Hertz, in 2022, at risk causing significant delays and shortages on the inventory of EV.com.\nIn January 2024, Hertz decided to shift its strategy and sell roughly a third of its entire fleet of electric vehicles, flooding the EV market through outlets such as Auto Trader (in the United Kingdom) and EV.com (in the United States), despite the announcement it made in October 2021 that the company would buy 100,000 electric vehicles from Tesla, Inc. in a deal that would net more than US$4 billion for the American automaker.\nThe company has also been accused of helping greenwash the images of car manufacturing companies such as General Motors (GM) and Volkswagen.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to EV.com Inc. at Wikimedia Commons\nOfficial website",

        "content": "A horsehair bed is a mattress similar to a wool mattress but produced using horsehair instead of wool. Each curl is shaped like a tiny spring, providing support and flexibility. At the same time, these springs act as miniature airlines and provide air flow, so the mattress does not retain excess heat and moisture and allows the flow of fresh air. Its flexible structure also strengthens the functions of ordinary spring systems.Horsehair is also an organic product with anti-fungal and anti-mite properties.No chemical treatment is used in the production of the mattresses as horsehair is very sensitive to chemical processes. After being thoroughly washed in boiling water, the horsehair is rinsed and turned into yarn by heating at 140 °C in high humidity. After this process, the knots are untied and volume is gained by handling.The production of these beds tends to be quite difficult and expensive, as they are made entirely by hand. It takes approximately 350 hours to produce a mattress. Today, there are only a few companies and places in the world that produce them.\n\n\n== References ==",

Coritiba was invited in their place.\n\n\n== Format ==\nThe competition was played in a round-robin format, where the team that scored the most points became champion.\n\n\n== Final table ==\n\n\n== Champion ==\n\n\n== References ==",

The result was a victory for the opposition People's Radical Party and Liberal Party, which together won 102 seats. The government led by Milan Piroćanac resigned, but King Milan I refused to allow the Radicals to form a government, instead appointing Nikola Hristić as prime minister.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe National Assembly elected in 1880 was dissolved on 11 January 1883. A royal decree set elections for 7 September.\n\n\n== Results ==\nThe People's Radical Party won 72 seats and the Liberal Party 30, with the Progressives winning only 24. The king appointed a further 44 members. Due to unrest, elections were not held in eight districts.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe new Assembly convened on 15 September and was formally opened on 22 September. Sima Nestorović was appointed president of the National Assembly and Arsa Drenovac as vice president.\nHowever, the Timok Rebellion broke out around a month later. Most of the Radical Party's committee were jailed, although its leader Nikola Pašić managed to flee abroad. The National Assembly was reconvened on 30 December, but dissolved on the same day, with early elections called for January 1884.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Whitchurch Civic Centre is a municipal building in Whitchurch, a town in Shropshire, in England. It accommodated the offices of Whitchurch Town Council until September 2023, when the building was closed, following the discovery of potentially dangerous reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== The market hall ===\nThe first municipal building in Whitchurch was a market hall on the corner of the High Street and St Mary's Street which was completed in 1718. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage of three bays facing onto the High Street. It was arcaded on the ground floor, so that markets could be held with an assembly room on the first floor. After ceasing to serve its original purpose, it was leased to Midland Bank in 1877, and then taken over by Barclays in 1917. After Barclays closed the branch, it fell vacant in July 2021\n\n\n=== The town hall ===\nFollowing significant population growth, mainly associated with the brewing and malting industries, a local board was established in Whitchurch in 1860. The new board decided to commission a more substantial municipal building for their meetings. The site they selected was occupied by the Coach and Horses Inn on the northeast side of the High Street.\nThe new building was designed by Thomas Lockwood in the Gothic Revival style, built in red brick with stone dressings at a cost of £3,000 and was completed in 1872. The design involved a symmetrical main block of seven bays, together with an additional gabled bay which projected forward at the left-hand end. There were segmental headed doorways with hood moulds in the central bay and end bays of the main block. On the first floor, in the central bay, there was a bi-partite mullioned window with cusped heads within an arch containing a quatrefoil in the head. All the other bays were fenestrated by segmental headed windows on the ground floor and by tall windows with cusped heads on the first floor. At roof level there was a modillioned cornice, a parapet and a central bellcote. Internally, the principal rooms were the market hall on the ground floor and a public hall, which was 65 feet (20 m) long and 41 feet (12 m) wide, on the first floor.\nThe local board was succeeded by Whitchurch Urban District Council in 1894. The town hall served as the local seat of government until the enlarged North Shropshire Rural District Council was formed in 1967.\n\n\n=== The civic centre ===\nIn the late 1960s, the rural district council decided to replace the ageing Victorian town hall with a new structure.  The new building was designed in the modern style, built in brick and glass and was officially opened on 16 November 1970.  The design involved an asymmetrical main frontage of five bays set well back from the High Street. The second bay on the left originally contained a passageway through to St Mary's Street, while the second bay on the right contained a glass doorway into the building. The ground floor was fenestrated by casement windows, and the first floor was fenestrated by a series of canted windows. Internally, the civic centre incorporated a main hall and a market hall.\nThe architectural historian, Nikolaus Pevsner, was unimpressed by the design of the new civic centre which he described as an \"inadequate replacement for T. M. Lockwood's town hall of 1872\". Following local government re-organisation in 1974, the civic centre accommodated the offices and meeting place of Whitchurch Town Council.\nIn 2013, the building was refurbished, at a cost of £1.6 million. The work included major changes to the facade, and internal redecoration and replacement of services.  The improvements to the façade included a full-height timber framed portico in the second bay on the left, new casement windows on the ground floor, and a new full-width balcony on the first floor, enhanced with timber piers supporting a full-width timber entablature. Behind the balcony, there was a new plate glass wall surmounted by a tall timber parapet. At the time, the venue was used for indoor sports, concerts and film showings, and continued to accommodate the offices of Whitchurch Town Council.\nIn September 2023, the building was closed, following the discovery of potentially dangerous reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete. Protests were organised by local residents concerned by council proposals to redevelop the site for housing. In March 2024, a working group was established, to investigate options for the building, including leaving the building closed but otherwise doing nothing, replacement of the roof, re-construction of the whole building, or redevelopment of the site.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Bela Yaari Hazan (1922–2004) was a member of the Jewish resistance in Poland during the Second World War. She took on an  Christian Polish identity and worked as a courier, passing information, money and arms between various ghettos. She was eventually imprisoned, tortured and sent to concentration camps, all the while maintaining her false identity. She worked as a nurse in the various camps that she found herself in, assisting resistance groups in the camps and getting medicine to Jewish inmates. She survived disease, hard labour, starvation and finally attempts by an SS squad to kill all the remaining prisoners in her final camp by helping move them overnight to the safety of approaching American troops. After liberation she went to France and then Italy, resuming her Jewish identity, before migrating to Israel in late 1945. After writing her memoirs They Called Me Bronislawa, she married and spent the rest of her life in Israel with her family. Many years after her death she was awarded the \"Jewish Rescuer Citation\" by B'nai B'rith.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nBorn in Rozhyshche, Poland (now part of Ukraine) in December 1922 to David and Esther Hazan, who had eight children in all. Her father died when she was six, leaving her mother to support the family from the grocery shop that she owned. Hazan was educated at a Hebrew language Tarbut school, moving on to an ORT vocational school in Kowel.\n\n\n== Halutzim ==\nBy the age of 16 Hazan had joined the HeHalutz Jewish youth movement, which gave young people agricultural training to prepare them for settling in the Land of Israel. In mid-1939 she was sent on a Haganah self-defence course in Zielonka. She used this knowledge to become a combat instructor at the kibbutz training programme at Bedzin. On 1 September 1939 Poland was invaded by Germany and Soviet Russia. After unsuccessfully trying to escape the advancing German forces, Hazan and her HeHalutz colleagues heard that Vilna (then part of Poland, now capital of Lithuania) remained free. In October 1940 Hazan, with nine other \"halutzim\" set off to travel almost 2,000 km to reach Vilna. They were detained and imprisoned by Russian soldiers when they entered soviet-held Poland, but were eventually released. They finally arrived in Vilna on 31 December 1939.\n\n\n== Kashariyot ==\n\nBy late 1941 Vilna was also occupied by the Germans, who immediately started murdering the Jewish inhabitants. Hazan worked as a nurse for while in a hospital in the ghetto.  Because of her Aryan appearance, Hazan then volunteered to act as a courier (kasharit) for the resistance, carrying messages, money and arms to resistance groups, between the ghettos of Vilna, Grodno, Lida and Bialystok. She adopted the name of a Polish woman that she knew, obtaining her passport, changing the photograph to become Bronislawa Limanowska, an identity she maintained throughout the war. She began wearing a crucifix and attending church regularly. She moved to Grodno, where her room became a meeting place for other couriers of the \"Kashariyot\". She obtained a job with the Gestapo as an interpreter, allowing her to steal documents and stationery that she passed on to the resistance. She was invited by one of the Gestapo officers to their Christmas party in 1941. On explaining that she had two friends staying with her, she was urged to bring them too. While at the party, one of the Gestapo officers took a picture of the three of them, Hazan, Tema Sznajderman and Lonka Korzybrodska, all three of them young Jewish women part of the Kashariyot, living with assumed Polish identities.\nShe entered the ghetto in Grodno and told the leadership there of the killing of Jews in Vilna. Although finding it hard to believe, they gave her money to allow her to help Jews to escape from the Vilna ghetto. With others she arranged for about 50 Jews to move from there to the ghetto in Balystok.\n\n\n== Imprisonment ==\n\nIn June 1942, the resistance had lost touch with Hazan's friend and fellow courier Lonka Korzybrodska. Hazan was given the task of locating her in Warsaw. On her journey from Balystok to Warsaw, Hazan was arrested at Malkinia railway station and transferred to the Gestapo headquarters in Warsaw. There she was badly tortured, before being moved to the infamous Pawiak prison. Initially kept for weeks in a dark isolation cell, she was eventually moved to a cell with other Polish political prisoners, the Gestapo still assumed that she was a Polish resistance fighter. In that cell she found Korzybrodska and they together suffered five further months of starvation and torture. On 13 November 1942, as part of a group of 53 women, they were transported to the women's camp at Birkenau, part of the Auschwitz concentration camp.\nInitially Hazan and Korzybrodska were sent to the fields to carry out forced labour. Soon Hazan started working as a nurse in the women's camp's hospital, where she was able to smuggle medicine to the Jewish patients, who were otherwise deprived of them. She helped Jewish resistance groups within the camp and provided extra food for Jewish women that had been smuggled into the Polish section of the camp. She and Korzybrodska contracted Typhoid fever. Hazan eventually recovered but was unable to save her friend, who died in her arms on 13 April 1943. As Korzybrodska was thought to be a Christian, she was prayed for and an icon was placed with her body. Hazan persuaded the SS doctor to allow her to take her friend's body to the morgue herself, where she removed the icon and recited the Jewish prayer for the dead, the Kaddish. Late in 1944, Hazan was moved to the new women's expansion camp in Auschwitz, where she was put in charge of the infirmary.\nAuschwitz was evacuated on 18 January 1945, with the inmates forced on a \"death march\" until they reached the German border after four days. There followed a series of journeys, firstly to Ravensbruck, then on to Malchow, where Hazan again worked as a nurse. She reached her final camp Tachau, near Leipzig, on 3 April 1945 with 1,000 others. She worked in the infirmary with Alexander Herman, a Jewish doctor from Prague. As American forces approached Leipzig, Tachau was evacuated, with all those capable of walking being sent on another death march. The other 140 inmates remained in the infirmary, being cared for by Hazan and Herman. As American forces got closer an SS group were sent out to kill the remaining inmates in the area. Warned by Polish prisoners that had escaped from an earlier massacre, Hazan and Herman, with help from some of the prisoners, successfully moved all the inmates through the night until they made contact with the Allies on 19 April 1945.\n\n\n== Liberation ==\nFollowing a spell in an American hospital in Leipzig, Hazan headed for Paris, where she dropped her assumed identity. In Paris she met with Jewish Brigade soldiers who took her with them to northern Italy. She moved on to southern Italy, reaching a Jewish displaced persons camp at Santa Maria al Bagno in Apulia. Here she worked with a group of orphaned girls, acting as teacher and counsellor. She named the group Frumka after Frumka Plotnicka who she had met in Zielonka in 1939. In early November the group embarked on the SS Princess Kathleen and arrived four days later in Haifa. They were held temporarily in the Atlit detainee camp before going to Ramat HaKovesh kibbutz. HeHalutz sent Hazan to another kibbutz, Givat Brenner, where she wrote her memoirs that were finally published in 1991 as a book entitled They Called Me Bronislawa.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nShe married a former member of the Jewish Brigade and journalist Haim Zaleshinsky, who she had met in Italy, on 5 January 1946. Zaleshinsky later changed his surname to Yaari. The couple moved to Tel Aviv and had two children, Esther and Yoel. She did not talk about her time in the war, wanting her children to grow up without the shadow of the holocaust. Hazan died in Jerusalem on 18 January 2004 at the age of 81. More than 14 years after her death she was recognised for her \"devotion, courage and heroism exhibited in rescuing fellow Jews in the holocaust\" when B'nai B'rith awarded her its \"Jewish Rescuer Citation\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBBC podcast on Bela Hazan - Part 7 of History's Secret Heroes",

        "content": "The church of the Santissimo Crocifisso or church of Cristo della Resega is a religious building located in Vigevano, in province of Pavia and diocese of Vigevano.\n\n\n== Description and story ==\n\nThe origins of the church can be found in the fresco currently preserved above the altar, by an unknown author. It depicts Christ crucified between Saint Francis of Assisi and Saint Catherine of Siena; in the background, you can see the Vigevano skyline. Popular legend considers this painting to be miraculous because, although it has never been restored, it still retains colors as vivid as originally. This fresco probably belonged to an aedicule against the wall of an ancient palace. Popular devotion to the painting grew steadily, until a chapel was built in 1652.\nIn 1679 the chapel became an oratory and was sold to the protempore parish priest of the Parish of San Cristoforo. It was precisely because it became private property that it was not demolished during the Napoleonic suppressions, which instead happened to many other churches in Vigevano.\nAlready considered for decades too small to accommodate all the faithful, in 1749 it was decided to expand and enrich it, starting the works that lasted until 1763, with the Baroque style construction visible today. In 1806 the parish was evicted from the church of San Cristoforo and later transferred to San Pietro Martire. Despite this, Christ's church continued to remain open. The construction of the annexed rooms took place in 1818; these were inhabited by a hermit until the mid-twentieth century. After the demolition of the church of San Cristoforo by Napoleon, the baroque altar and one of the three bells reached the church of Christ from it. The latter, dated 1690 and dedicated to the Holy Trinity, is still functioning and is the middle bell of the small three-bell concert present on the bell tower on the side of the facade. It is the oldest bell in the city after the cleft bell of the Bramante Tower.\nLeft to slow abandonment starting in 1960, the church underwent restoration by the FAI between 1992 and 1995. During this restoration, the red columns were repainted black, as that would have been the original color. Subsequently, the annexed rooms and the garden were also restored by local associations.\nThe paired columns and the folders bearing inscriptions on the Passion are black. Lime painted with pointed motifs forms a crown of thorns, from which the hemispherical volume of the dome detaches. The latter is decorated with little angels in relief, white on blue backgrounds, and, at the top, by a frescoed angelic concert.\nThe building has a significant height due to the impossibility of opening windows on the walls, which required the inclusion of a very large lantern. The entrance front is marked by two giant-order pilasters surmounted by a triangular tympanum; To support the octagonal tiled roof there are short pillars resting on the perimeter walls, which leave the volume of the dome free and visible. The marble altar, from the eighteenth century like the sacristy, demonstrates the continuity of use of the oratory.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ludwig Wilhelm Anton, Count Baillet de Latour-Merlemont (12 February 1753 - 1 September 1836) served as an Austrian general during the French Revolutionary Wars. From a noble family, he joined the Austrian army as a volunteer in 1767 and fought in the War of the Bavarian Succession as a commissioned officer. He was promoted to command an infantry regiment in 1788 and fought in the Austro-Turkish War. He became a Generalmajor in 1794 during the War of the First Coalition against France. He fought in the Rhine campaign of 1795 and led a division in numerous battles during the Rhine campaign of 1796. He was known as Count Baillet or Count Baillet-Merlemont to distinguish him from his higher-ranking older brother Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour. He was promoted Feldmarschall-Leutnant in 1797. \nDuring the War of the Second Coalition, Baillet again led a division in several battles in Germany. During the Ulm campaign in the War of the Third Coalition, he and his division were surrounded and captured in October 1805. From 1807 to 1810, he was the inhaber (proprietor) of an Austrian infantry regiment. He was promoted Feldzeugmeister in 1808. He suddenly resigned his commission in 1810 and transferred his loyalty to France. He served under Napoleon as a General of Division but not as a combat commander. After Napoleon's abdication in 1814, he was awarded the Order of Saint-Louis and retired from the army. He died at Brussels in 1836. \n\n\n== Early career ==\nLudwig Wilhelm Anton, Count Baillet de Latour-Merlemont was born on 12 February 1753 at Latour Castle near Virton in the Austrian Netherlands (modern-day Belgium). On 6 February 1767, he joined the Austrian Salm-Salm Infantry Regiment Nr. 14 as a volunteer. On 1 March 1773, he received promotion to Captain. He led his soldiers during the War of the Bavarian Succession in 1778–1779. He married Charlotte-Angélique-Julienne de Baillet, Baronne de Gesve. He was promoted Major on either 9 May or 9 March 1783. He was elevated in rank to Oberstleutnant on 5 December in either 1783 or 1785. From 1784–1788, he served in the Austrian Netherlands. \nOn 2 February 1788, Count Baillet was promoted Oberst in command of the Austrian Klebeck Infantry Regiment Nr. 14. He assumed leadership from the previous commander Joseph Zamboni San Collogero and would relinquish command to Eduard Jamez in 1794. The regiment took part in the Austro-Turkish War in 1789. It was present at the Siege of Gradiška (Berbir) and Siege of Belgrade. In 1790, the regiment transferred to the Observation Corps in Moravia. In 1792, the regiment was moved to the middle Rhine in the corps of Friedrich Wilhelm, Fürst zu Hohenlohe-Kirchberg. \n\n\n== General officer ==\nCount Baillet was wounded by a round shot at the Siege of Le Quesnoy in 1793. All 3 battalions of the Klebeck Regiment fought at the Battle of Wattignies on 15–16 October 1793. On 1 January 1794, Baillet was promoted Generalmajor to rank from 10 December 1791. He was employed on the upper Rhine at the Action at Mannheim on 18 October 1795. The following year, he fought under the command of his elder brother Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour who was referred to as Count Latour. Ludwig Wilhelm Anton was called Count Baillet or Baillet-Merlemont to distinguish him from his older brother. \nCount Baillet led troops at the Battle of Ettlingen (Malsch) on 9 July 1796 and the Battle of Neresheim on 11 August 1796. By September, the French Army of the Rhine and Moselle was retreating, pursued by Count Latour's army, while several other Austrian forces maneuvered to surround it. The French commander Jean Victor Marie Moreau determined to strike at Latour's army in order to cripple it. On 30 September, Latour's vanguard under Baillet bumped into a stronger French force at Bad Schussenried and lost 300 prisoners. On 2 October, at the Battle of Biberach, Baillet commanded the Austrian center with 6 or 7 infantry battalions and 12 cavalry squadrons. The reckless Latour got his outnumbered army into a bad position with a river at its back. The French won the battle, capturing 4,000 Austrian soldiers and 18 guns. Baillet also fought at the Battle of Emmendingen on 19 October and the Battle of Schliengen on 24 October 1796. He remained on the upper Rhine as a division commander in 1797. He was promoted Feldmarschall-Leutnant on 1 March 1797 to rank from 26 January 1797. \nAt the start of the War of the Second Coalition, Count Baillet commanded a division in the army of Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen in Swabia. In Spring 1799, Baillet's division consisted of one brigade, that of Generalmajor Anton Ulrich Mylius. The brigade included the Carl Schröder Infantry Regiment Nr. 7, the Lacy Infantry Regiment Nr. 22, and 1 battalion of the Deutsch-Banat Grenz Regiment Nr. 12. He led his division at the Battle of Ostrach on 20–21 March, the Battle of Stockach on 25 March, and the First Battle of Zurich on 4–7 June 1799. In Spring 1800, he led a division in Paul Kray's army at the Battle of Stockach on 3 May, the Battle of Messkirch on 4–5 May, and Battle of Biberach on 9 May 1800. In the Battle of Iller River (Erolzheim) on 5 June, Baillet led a corps of 8 battalions and 10 squadrons. At first, his troops were victorious, but Michel Ney's French division appeared and defeated his troops with heavy losses.      \n\n\n== Notes ==\nFootnotes\n\nCitations\n\n\n== References ==\nCust, Edward (1860). \"Annals of the Wars of the Eighteenth Century: 1796–1799, Volume 5\".

It was finished in 1962 and on 7 September 1962 the building was dedicated to Christ. The owner of the building is the Parish of San Giovanni Bosco, born on 15 March 1960 and whose activity began on 11 October 1962. The church was consecrated on 15 November 1992 by the Bishop Monsignor Giovanni Locatelli.\nIt has a particular octagonal shape. Much is owed to the first parish priest, Father Elio Lupano, and his successors for the finishing and embellishment work on the church. Inside, the fresco behind the main altar by Piero Dalle Ceste stands out.\n\n\n== References ==",

On 15 May 1710 the Congregation of Saint Charles was founded, approved by the archbishop Giuseppe Archinto in the same year, who had the construction of the church begin in 1724, finishing it in 1736. The congregation officiated in the church of San Rocco until 3 November 1721, and then moved to the Madonna della Neve, where it remained until the consecration of the aforementioned church from which it took its first name. In 1741 the church was visited by Bishop Bossi. In 1802 it was suppressed by Napoleon Bonaparte and transformed into a military hospital; in this period all the works of art were stolen, including the wooden choir. It was reconsecrated and reopened for worship in 1841. In 1850 it was repainted and restored by Giovan Battista Garberini, who completed the work in 1893.\nIt has dimensions of 26 m long, 9 m wide and 15 m high. The style is purely neoclassical. The facade is simple and is divided into three parts by columns; it has a small bell tower, left unfinished, of the two originally planned, which should have risen from the facade.\nIt has a single nave and four altars, dedicated respectively to: Saint Louis Gonzaga; Saint Francis Xavier, Saint Francis de Sales and Saint Philip Neri; the Crucifix; the Nativity. The flooring dates back to 1724, in terracotta. Many of the paintings present belong to the church of San Pietro Martire.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"The Death of Peace of Mind\" (stylized in all caps) is a song by American alternative metal band Bad Omens. It was initially released as the lead single for their third album of the same name on November 9, 2021. After their song \"Just Pretend\" became a large viral and radio sleeper hit in late-2022/early-2023, the band released the song to radio in May 2023, where it also became a large hit. It was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on January 11, 2024, indicating 500,000 units in the United States (including sales and units adjusted for streaming numbers), becoming their second song to do so after \"Just Pretend\".\n\n\n== Composition ==\nSpeaking to Kerrang!, Noah Sebastian stated that the song's writing process started at the beginning of the quarantine of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 as an experiment to use as many samples using household objects:\n\n\"This track didn’t have much deliberation behind the lyrics at first and was more of a flow-state writing experience. The skeleton of this song was a really experimental process that took place over the course of a full day. If you haven’t heard about the genesis of this song by now, I’ll make it brief: at the start of quarantine in 2020 I challenged myself to make a track using only samples I recorded of household items. Smacking pillows, shaking keys, recording and tuning the low frequency of a vacuum cleaner to a C note and making a multi octave sampler out of it. Stuff like that. After a few hours of tinkering in my DAW [digital audio workstation] I had made an instrumental with all these sounds. From there, I just looped sections and free-styled melodies with whatever words or incoherent noises came to my head. After countless loops the noises shaped into vowels, which shaped into consonants, and then words that ultimately felt very native to the dark, dry and sensual core of the instrumental and didn’t need much tweaking once the real instrumental was realised around them. Asking the question: ‘When this is all over, will we both go home alive, and will we ever find inner peace again after the events that took place?\"\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Capuchin Church is a religious building located in Vigevano, in province of Pavia and diocese of Vigevano.\n\n\n== Description and story ==\nIn 1896, the Diocese of Vigevano purchased villa del Mombello. Initially, the small church of the Holy Family, located in via Bretti, was built.\nThe current church, with a façade on Corso Genova, was designed and built between 1926 and 1927 after the partial demolition of the pre-existing one, which was now inadequate due to its small dimensions.\nThe church appears rather bare, but suggestive in its simplicity. The frescoes are recent, repainted after a fire in 1941 which seriously damaged the 1927 originals. The authors were Luigi Brusatori and Francesco Mazzucchi; the latter dedicated himself in particular to the altarpiece on the main altar dedicated to the Holy Family and to the large fresco of the Madonna of the Angels at the back of the church, above the entrance portal. Another relevant subject are the four wooden side altars from the old convent of Serravalle Scrivia: these enclose Grotta Lourdiana, the statue of St. Francis and the paintings of St. Veronica Giuliani and St. Anthony of Padua; the latter is the work of Giacinto Gimignani and comes from the Serravalle convent.\nOutside, the front of the church door, in the shape of a crescent, represents Saint Francis embracing the Crucifix, a wooden work by the sculptor Carlo Farinone of Varallo Sesia and a gift from Don Pompeo Carreri of Alagna, as the inscription recalls.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Oliver Edwal Ruck was an association footballer and officer in the Royal Engineers, who played in the 1878 FA Cup final.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nOliver Ruck was born at Pennal, Merionethshire, Wales on 27 May 1851, the fifth child and third son of Laurence Ruck (c.1820–1896), a gentleman farmer, originally from Newington in Kent.  On his mother's side, he could claim descent from Owain Glyndŵr, the last Welsh native Prince of Wales.Ruck attended the Royal Military Academy, following in the footsteps of his brother Richard Ruck, and was commissioned as lieutenant in the Royal Engineers in July 1875, having scored the fifth highest marks on passing out for the year; future football team-mate Charles Haynes had beaten him.  He also won the RMA Governor's Prize that year for his skill with watercolours, as well as prizes for technical drawing - three of his future team-mates also won prizes in 1875.\n\n\n== Football career ==\nRichard Ruck had played in the Royal Engineers A.F.C. side which won the FA Cup in 1875.  Oliver made his debut for the Sappers in goal against the Gitanos at the Prince's Cricket Ground in February 1876, and kept a clean sheet in a 2–0 victory.  He only played once more in goal, and by the end of the 1875–76 season had moved up front; in April both he and Richard scored in a win for the Engineers over the Wanderers.He made his competitive début in the second round of the 1876–77 FA Cup, playing as centre-forward in a 3–0 win at the Shropshire Wanderers.  He was not a regular player - his fourth tie in the competition, and first in the 1877–78 FA Cup, was the \"final six\" second replay against Oxford University, in which he scored one of the Sappers' goals in a 4–2 win.  He played in the semi-final and final as well, all three appearances being on the right wing.  He was picked out for his \"untiring\" play in the final, but it was not enough as the Wanderers took the trophy with a 3–1 win.\n\n\n== Military career ==\nThe 1878 final was Ruck's final football match, as his army duties took him away from the game.  Ruck was made captain on 28 January 188, major on 3 November 1894, and colonel in October 1904.  He served in the First Boer War in 1881 before being sent to Hong Kong and Singapore, and in 1901 he was appointed in command of the Royal Engineers in Liverpool.  He retired in 1908, but was brought back to serve for the First World War.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nOn 16 November 1884, at Chatham, he marred Eve Pedley, the daughter of Thomas Pedley (owner of 1847 Epsom Derby winner Cossack), from Stubbing Court in Derbyshire.  The couple had one son, Laurence, who was killed at Neuve Chapelle in 1915, and one daughter, Mary.In retirement, he moved to Aberdovey, where he became an authority on local archaeology.  He died suddenly at his home on 24 July 1934.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nWarsop, Keith (2004). The Early FA Cup Finals and the Southern Amateurs. SoccerData. ISBN 1-89946-878-1.",

        "content": "Floribella is a 344-chapter Brazilian telenovela produced and broadcast by Rede Bandeirantes between April 4, 2005, and August 12, 2006. It was divided into two seasons, the first with 170 chapters and the second with 173. It replaced the news slot and was replaced by the children's program Pic Nick Band. It is a remake of the Argentine telenovela Floricienta, originally written by Cris Morena, adapted by Patrícia Moretzsohn and Jaqueline Vargas, and directed by Ricardo F. Ferreira and Elisabetta Zenatti. It is the first telenovela produced by Rede Bandeirantes since Meu Pé de Laranja Lima (1998). The company was inspired by the success of the Argentine original and Brazilian remakes, such as Chiquititas, to create the plot.\nDeeply inspired by the works Cinderella and The Sound of Music, Floribella was described by the press as the \"Cinderella of the 2000s\", where the crystal shoe was swapped for a sneaker. Aimed at children, Floribella had an overall average of 4 points, doubling Rede Bandeirantes' figures for the time slot. Television journalists reviewed it positively; consequently, Floribella was nominated for ten categories in the 8th Contigo! TV Awards. As a telenovela with a musical plot, two soundtracks were released, becoming commercial successes and selling over three hundred thousand copies in total. Two DVDs and a remix album also hit the market.\nIt features Juliana Silveira, Roger Gobeth, Mário Frias, Maria Carolina Ribeiro, Suzy Rêgo, Daniel Ávila, Cássia Linhares and Fernando Alves Pinto in the lead roles.\n\n\n== Storyline ==\n\n\n=== First season ===\nMaria Flor (Juliana Silveira) is a dreamy girl who lost her mother as a child and was brought up by her godmother, Titina (Zezé Motta), who always helped her make her dreams come true. She starts working as a nanny at the Fritzenwalden mansion, where six orphaned siblings live. The eldest, Fred (Roger Gobeth), who had to give up his career abroad to take care of the younger ones, becomes bitter and cold because of the burden he carries. The other brothers are Guto (Gustavo Leão), a handsome and popular surfer, Betinho (Gabriel Lasmar), Guto's non-identical twin who is considered \"ugly\", João Pedro (Johnny Massaro), a nerd who only thinks about rules, Bruna (Mariah de Moraes), a spoiled and rebellious girl, and little Joca (João Vithor Oliveira).\nFlor already knew all of Fred's brothers, except for Guto, who spends most of his time away from the family because of surfing. She met the brothers at a clandestine party they threw at the mansion during Fred's trip. At the party, she played with her band, which also included DiCaprio (Bruno Miguel), Tati (Úrsula Corona), Juju (Eline Porto) and Batuca (André Luiz Miranda), Titina's son who Flor considers to be her brother. Despite making all the previous nannies run away and almost driving housekeeper Helga (Vic Militello) crazy, the brothers like and respect Flor for this previous connection and, little by little, Fred, who didn't like the nanny's eccentric and positivist way, also starts to admire her and the two fall in love. However, Fred's fiancée, the arrogant Delfina (Maria Carolina Ribeiro), and her mother, Malva (Suzy Rêgo), are not happy about this and are willing to do anything to make the wedding happen so that they can get their hands on the Fritzenwalden fortune and make Flor's life a living hell.\nThere are also other characters, such as Adriano (Daniel Ávila), a cousin of the Fritzenwaldens who arrives at the mansion to study and also falls in love with Flor, vying for her attention with Fred. Sofia, Malva's daughter, who is considered \"ugly\" and awkward, and unlike her mother and sister, likes Flor. Luciano (Bruno Padilha) is Delfina's lover and helps her in her schemes, while Matheus (Igor Cotrim) is Fred's best friend and advisor. There's also Martinha (Letícia Colin), a DJ who befriends Flor and helps her produce the band's music. Malva is also looking for the bastard daughter that her late husband had out of wedlock, whom she wants to intimidate into giving up half of her inheritance, although no one imagines that the girl is Flor.\n\n\n=== Second season ===\nAfter Fred dies in a plane crash, Delfina believes that she will become guardian of the Fritzenwaldens and inherit their fortune, as she married him before the trip. However, she marvels when she discovers that he has handed over guardianship of the brothers to Count Máximo (Mário Frias), and she is entitled to nothing. Flor faces a sexist and arrogant boy, who hates being in charge of five young people and clashes with her constantly. The two gradually discover that they are more alike than they seem and they fall in love. As before, Delfina decides to conquer Máximo in order to gain access to the money with the help of her mother Malva and Luciano, who threatens her to give him half the money or he will tell her that she has committed the crime of bigamy, since she had married him too.\nBruna leaves to study in Europe and Olívia (Julianne Trevisol), the brothers' cousin who has been in love with Betinho since childhood, arrives at the mansion, but faces interference from her ex-boyfriend Christian (Sylvio Carvalho). There are also the romances between Batuca and Camila (Nathália Limaverde) and Guto and Moniquinha (Yana Sardenberg), which is hindered by the poisonous Agatha (Jullie). Marquise Kriseida (Cássia Linhares) also arrives, a great love from Máximo's past and willing to do anything to win him back with the help of Baron João Melaço (Fernando Alves Pinto), who becomes obsessed with Flor. Meanwhile, Flor and Malva discover a clause in the will that they will only receive the inheritance if they manage everything together.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n=== Special guests ===\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 2004, the creator Cris Morena wrote the telenovela Floricienta, inspired by the story Cinderella and the movie The Sound of Music by Robert Wise. Produced by Cris Morena Group in partnership with RGB Entertainment, Floricienta premiered on March 15, 2004, on Channel 13. Starring Florencia Bertotti, Juan Gil Navarro and Fábio Di Tomaso, it aired until December 2, 2005, in Argentina. It was rebroadcast by the Disney Channel and in 2012 by Telefe. In addition to exports, versions were made in several countries, such as Portugal, Chile, Colombia and Mexico.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\nIn August 2004, inspired by the success of the Argentine version and national remakes such as Chiquititas, Rede Bandeirantes announced the production of a Brazilian version of Floricienta, reviving the company's drama department, which had been deactivated since 1998, when it produced Meu Pé de Laranja Lima. Originally, Rede Bandeirantes planned to buy the Argentine version and show it dubbed in Brazil, but the decision was made to produce a Brazilian version. Patrícia Moretzsohn and Jaqueline Vargas, who were collaborators on Malhação, were announced as the authors of the adaptation. Soon after, they announced the Portuguese title, Floribella, formed by combining the words \"flor\" and \"Cinderela\".\nEach episode cost $35,000 and the complete production grossed $5.3 million. Filming of the first season lasted until October 2005, when the second phase began. Rede Bandeirantes rented the Tycoon studios, located in Barra da Tijuca, and the main filming took place at the Rio de Janeiro Film and Video Center, where 20 sets were built in an area of 1,200 square meters, as well as a scenic street. The aim was to decentralize production, which was mainly based in São Paulo.\n\n\n=== Casting ===\nThe casting tests were held on December 11 and 12, 2004 and involved 5,000 candidates, who had to perform an acting scene and sing a song. Around 500 new or well-known actresses fit the profile required for the leading role of Maria Flor. The choice came down to Juliana Silveira, Rafaela Mandelli, Natallia Rodrigues, Fabiana Alvarez and Renata Del Bianco, with Juliana being selected. Maria Carolina Ribeiro was one of the newcomers who tried out for the role of Maria Flor. She was later reassigned to audition for the role of the antagonist Delfina and passed.\nFor the male lead, the final choice was between Miguel Thiré, Márcio Kieling and Roger Gobeth, who got the job. Suzy Rêgo, who had been out of soap operas for four years, asked Elizabetta Zenatti to audition for the production. Zenatti decided to cast Suzy without auditioning, believing that a well-known actress would enhance the plot and help develop the comedic tone of the antagonist Malva. Gustavo Leão received the confirmation that he had passed the tests on Christmas Eve, when the Rede Bandeirantes team arrived at his house with cameras to record his reaction. Before recording began, a 10-day workshop was held to help the actors adapt to the world of children's drama.\n\n\n== Screening ==\nFloribella was originally due to premiere on March 14, 2005, on Rede Bandeirantes, but was postponed to April 4. Aired from Monday to Friday at 8.10 p.m. after Jornal da Band, it was rated free for all audiences. The last chapter was shown on November 25, 2005, making a total of 169 chapters. Afterwards, a special with the best moments was broadcast. With a renewed contract with RGB, Rede Bandeirantes produced a second season, which aired from January 23 to August 12, 2006, with 173 episodes from Monday to Saturday. Counting both series, the production had a total of 344 chapters, making it one of the longest in the history of Brazilian television. The opening of the first season was broadcast to the sound of \"Floribella\", its title song, which was included in the first soundtrack; in the second season, the theme was \"É pra você meu coração\", included in Floribella 2: É pra você meu coração. Both are adaptations of Floricienta produced by Rick Bonadio.\nFloribella was also shown on the Disney Channel from October 16, 2006, to June 8, 2007, in the first season and from June 2, 2008, to January 30, 2009, in the second season. Internationally, it was aired by Band Internacional. There have been rumors of a third season. In this case, the continuation would need unadapted writing, since Floricienta has only had two series. Rede Bandeirantes and RGB discussed the possibility, but it didn't materialize. After it ended, Rede Bandeirantes rebroadcast the first season between November 5, 2007, and June 17, 2008, in the 14:15 slot. The ratings were low, so it was moved to 1.50 p.m. The first season of the show became available on the Netflix streaming service on July 2, 2015.\nIt was rebroadcast for the second time on Rede Bandeirantes from September 15, 2020, to May 17, 2021, in 175 chapters, 15 years after the original airing, replacing the Portuguese drama Ouro Verde and being replaced by the new drama Nazaré at 8:20pm. As with the first rerun in 2007, only the first season was broadcast.\n\n\n== Music ==\nIn order to release the records for the telenovela, Rede Bandeirantes signed an agreement with Universal Music. In total, five albums were released, two studio albums, two live albums and one remix and karaoke album. The first album launched was Floribella on June 6, 2005. The album features voices from the protagonist Juliana Silveira and the antagonist Maria Carolina Ribeiro, with a special guest appearance from Gustavo Leão. The album was inspired by the original Floricienta y Su Banda, released in 2004 in Argentina. The album sold 55,000 copies in the first 45 days after its release and reached fifteenth on the best-selling albums of 2005. Initially certified as a gold record for selling 100,000 copies, which Juliana received on stage at Sabadaço, the album received a platinum record from the Brazilian Association of Record Producers (ABPD) for total sales of 170,000 copies. Silveira received the certificate on the Band Vida stage.\nThe title song \"Floribella\" ranked among the most downloaded ringtones on cell phones in July 2005 with more than 90,000 copies sold; after the end of the first season, 320,000 ringtones had been bought. The first DVD, entitled Floribella: Ao Vivo, was recorded on September 18, 2005, in São Paulo and received a gold certification from ABPD, ranking 18th in the top 20 best-sellers of 2005. The show was aired on Rede Bandeirantes a day after it took place. The second album released was Floribella 2: É para você meu coração, on March 20, 2006, which contains thirteen songs, twelve inspired by the Argentine original and one unreleased, \"País das águas\". In the same year, Floribella: Remixes + Karaoke was released, with remixes and karaoke of all the songs from Floribella 2. Floribella, o Musical was recorded from a live show at Tom Brasil, in São Paulo, and became the last phonographic edition of the telenovela. Overall, the telenovela sold 25,500 CDs per audience point.\n\n\n== Release and repercussions ==\n\n\n=== Audience ===\nRede Bandeirantes' target for Floribella was 3 points; in Greater São Paulo, the premiere reached 3.5 points. It averaged around 3 points during the first two months of broadcasting. After that, the audience increased and it reached third place in the Brazilian Institute of Public Opinion and Statistics (IBOPE) measurement, beating Jornal da Record. On August 2, 2005, it reached 6 points; the last chapter of the first season set a record with 7 points.\nThe first weeks of the second season maintained the same ratings as the end of the first with 5 and 7 points. However, RecordTV launched a second telenovela slot with Cidadão Brasileiro at 8:30 p.m. on March 13, 2006, creating drama competition for Floribella, which led to lower ratings for the second season than for the first. On the premiere of Cidadão Brasileiro, Rede Bandeirantes scored 3 audience points, while its competitor averaged 15, with peaks of 23. The problem persisted throughout the season. The show ended with satisfactory ratings for the broadcaster, with an average of 4 points, double that of Meu Pé de Laranja Lima.\n\n\n=== Retrospective evaluation ===\n\nDuring the first week of showing Floribella, journalists from Jornal do Brasil evaluated it negatively and equated it with the telenovela Malhação: \"Judging by the first two chapters, it's far from being a musical, at least in the sense that this word takes on in cinema [and] it's a bit difficult to know [for] which audience [it's aimed at].\" Ana Beatriz Corrêa, from the same newspaper, stated that \"the romantic comedy is a modern version of the Cinderella fable, in which the crystal slipper has been replaced by colorful sneakers.\" Journalist Thomas Villena said: \"[In Floribella], the sets are poor, the script doesn't help (it's childish and banal), the actors, for the most part, don't know how to act, the direction is insecure and the result couldn't be worse [...] as a children's fable, it should win over children and teenagers, but as a soap opera, it doesn't have the text or actors to compete with the others.\"\nRicardo Valladares, from Veja magazine, exposed the quality of Brazilian teledramaturgy outside TV Globo and cited Floribella as an example to Rede Bandeirantes: \"From actors to cameras, there is a certain euphoria among soap opera professionals today. The 9 points [of Rede Record's Essas Mulheres] are well above the network's average [and Band], for its part, has managed to double its average audience with Floribella, in which it invested 5 million dollars in association with an Argentine producer.\" Elizabete Antunes, from O Globo, commented: \"If a large part of the cast [of Floribella] is as young in age as it is in career, there is a team that goes against the grain. Or rather, they can point the inexperienced ones in the right direction.\" Keila Jimenez, from O Estado de S. Paulo, said: \"[it's] full of clichés, [...] abandoned children, princes charming and Manichaeism.\" Dolores Orosco from IstoÉ commented that Juliana Silveira \"has the makings of a children's presenter\".\n\n\n=== Products and sales ===\nInitially, Rede Bandeirantes spent R$8 million on sponsorship quotas, such as the commercial companies Casas Bahia, Petrobrás, RGB Entertainment and Kopenhagen. The soundtrack began with a CD in Spanish and Portuguese, which sold 55,000 copies in 45 days. During the first few weeks of its release, it remained fourth on the bestseller list. José Antonio Éboli, president of Universal Music, commented: \"What surprises us is the speed of sales. It's an album that will sell half a million copies by the end of the year because it appeals to children.\" Keila Jimenez, from O Estado de S. Paulo commented: \"The next season of the show, which premieres next year, will bring more and more products. CDs, DVDs and a line of beauty and hygiene products are in the plans of the broadcaster, which insists that the soap opera has come to pave the way for other plots at Band. But none as lucrative, Band already knows.\"\nÚrsula Corona, who played Tatiana, was cast to present the show O Diário de Floribella during the second phase of the show. In the program, she would show questions and jokes related to the history of Floribella. A year after the start of the show, the sticker album sponsored by Panini Comics sold 6 million envelopes. Sneakers, dolls, sneakers and puzzles were also licensed. The protagonist's doll sold more than 50,000 copies. The Bamba Floribella shoe, produced in partnership with Alpargatas, was one of the leading products in the TV series and was advertised during the plot and commercials. It sold more than 415,000 pairs. In 2006, the publishing house Landscape launched As Aventuras de Floribella, a book based on the soap opera and composed of eight unpublished stories never shown on TV.\n\n\n=== Awards and nominations ===\nFloribella received ten nominations for the 8th Contigo! TV Awards. Patrícia Moretzsohn and Jaqueline Vargas were placed in the Best Author and Best Soap Opera categories; Elizabetta Zenatti was nominated for Best Director; Lulu Arreal, for Best Costume Design; Juliana Silveira, for Best Actress; Maria Carolina Ribeiro, for Breakthrough Actress; Isabella Cunha represented the Best Child Actress category; Roger Gobeth, the Best Actor category and Gustavo Leão was placed for Breakthrough Actor. Juliana Silveira and Roger Gobeth's characters, Maria Flor and Fred, were also nominated for Best Romantic Couple.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLola: Once Upon a Time\nFloribella\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFloribella at IMDb",

A few years later, according to Simone dal Pozzo, was rebuilt in its current location. It was enlarged for the first time in 1575 and then in 1672, adopting its new structure. The choir was built in 1576.\nAlso in 1672, the base was built higher than the road and the gallows for public executions were added to the side; the latter will then be moved to the disappeared church of Santa Giuliana.\nThe façade dates back to 1908, designed by Galliani and painted by Francesco Mazzucchi in 1960. The altar however dates back to the Seventeenth century and is in polychrome marble. Finally, in the side chapel on the left it is possible to find a fresco representing the Three Kings, the only one in the entire Diocese.\n\n\n== References ==",

The park is on the traditional territory of the Yuin people, and in fact the park's name derives from the local word for koalas.\nThe site is designated a category II protected area by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe park measures 11,626 hectares (44.89 sq mi), and is bounded by the valley of the Narira Creek and the Tuross River. The park is backed by the Monaro tablelands in the west, while the coast lies to the east. The park contains four communities of important vegetation and endangered animal habitat. It comprises a significant portion of Dignams Creek's river basin. The town of Narooma lies 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) to the north-east, and Cobargo township 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) southwards.\n\n\n== Wildlife ==\nKoalas are one of several endangered animal species the park provides habitat for, and a small population is known from the park. Koalas are in danger of local extinction in southern New South Wales. Beyond koalas, the park has reported twenty vulnerable animals found within its boundaries, including the southern brown bandicoot, the long-nosed potoroo, and the tiger quoll, all marsupials.: 3 \n\n\n== History ==\nMany of the pathways in the park follow old routes set down by the traditional inhabitants of the land, the Yuin people. The park's name, Kooraban, comes from a local Aboriginal word meaning \"koala\".: 1  The area was declared a national park in 2001, and there is evidence of historical woodcutting and gold mining within the park.: 3  In 2012, the park was designated a protected area by the IUCN.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Brain Eaters Font Company is an American type foundry founded in 1995 by Brad O. Nelson, specializing in producing \"retro\" style fonts. Many notable fonts included \"Action Is\", \"Musicals\", \"Psychatronic\", and \"Keep on Truckin'\".\nMany fonts produced by Brain Eaters were used by various companies, like Cartoon Network, Warner Bros., The Walt Disney Company, IMAX Corporation, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, MTV, Nelvana, and so many more.\n\n\n== The famous \"Action Is\" font ==\nIt all started with a simple idea back in 1998: do a digital version of Victor Caruso's \"Caruso Roxy\", a \"lost\" 70's typeface, and make up the missing letters that were not present in the only available example Jeff Levine had to work with. Jeff wasn't yet doing his own digital font creation, so he hooked up with Brad Nelson who owns a small foundry called Brain Eaters Fonts. Together, they collaborated on \"Action Is\"- a freeware font named after the source of the type example. This was a title page for a commemorative photo album of images from the 60's TV music show Where the Action Is, formerly hosted by Jeff's employer at the time, singer-writer-producer Steve Alaimo. The free font took off like a rocket, being released just at the peak of the 60’s/70’s retro craze in the late 1990’s, and it was everywhere throughout the 2000s. It showed up on TV shows, packaging and web design, and was even spotted on signage used on the side of a major amusement resort’s retro-themed hotel. From that point on, Jeff kept getting requests for a version with a lower case. Although they shared the copyright in the freeware version, Brad Nelson gave Jeff his blessing to re-work and take Action Is into the realm of commercial type. Newly improved and re-released as Groovy Happening JNL, it became one of Jeff's better selling type designs. A simplified, yet similar font was issued called Groovy Summer JNL.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Richters Herbs is a Canadian nursery and seed company based in Goodwood, Ontario. Richters is one of the top suppliers of herbs in Canada.\n\n\n== History ==\nRichters was founded as a flower and garden center in 1967 by Waltraut and Otto Richter. Waltraut and Otto moved from Austria to Canada in the 1950s. After they began growing their own herbs, a 1969 feature article in the Toronto Star brought them wide attention. They sent out their first catalogue in 1970. In early years, they did business as Otto Richter and Sons.Otto is a trained horticulturist. Waltraut ran the business, assisted by their son, Conrad, who has a master's degree in botanyOriginally located in Locust Hill, Ontario, Waltraut and Otto moved the herb operation to Goodwood in 1975 after their farm was expropriated for the planned development of Seaton. The financial impact forced them to reduce their 29,000 square feet (2,700 m2) of greenhouses to 6,000 square feet (560 m2), devastating their bedding plant business.The company pivoted to focus on herbs in the mid-1980s and began adding commercial growers to their client list.\n\n\n== Operations ==\nRichters offers seeds for both culinary and medicinal herbs. All plants sold by Richters are grown in its greenhouses or on its site. By 1989, Richters had increased their greenhouse space to more than 20,000 square metres (220,000 sq ft).The headquarters is located east of Toronto. It has distributors in Australia, Germany, and Israel.The company has certifications to allow it to export seeds and plants to the United States, and approximately 25 percent of the company's sales are to American customers. Richters will attempt to ship anywhere in the world.The catalogue provides educational content about the uses of herbs. To expand the varieties of herbs the company can offer, Conrad established seed collection agencies in Nepal, Ghana, China, and Ecuador in the 1980s. They also have a Chinese herbal researcher on staff. By 2000, Richters carried 800 varieties of herbs.As of 2019, Conrad is president of the company. He travels globally to locate herbs that can be grown successfully in Canada. Conrad has supported regulation of herb growers, pointing to Australia for an example of \"workable rules for regulating medicinal herbs\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nWanstall, Anne (18 June 1969). \"You can have a garden of sweet smelling herbs\".

        "content": "On June 11, 2023, six people were shot outside a condominium complex in southeast Annapolis, Maryland, U.S.; three people were fatally wounded. A 43-year-old man, Charles Robert Smith, was subsequently arrested and charged in connection with the shooting. The shooting was believed by prosecutors to have had racially-motivated overtones; the shooter was White, and the victims were all Latino American. Hate crime enhancements have also been filed against the alleged perpetrator.\n\n\n== Shooting ==\nAccording to the police charging documents, the six people who were shot were attending a large party when a dispute broke out over a parking issue. Mireles went to Smith's home to talk about it and was arguing with Shirley Smith when her son Charles Smith returned home and confronted him. The altercation started at 1000 block of Paddington Place. Police said that the violence started after the white luxury vehicle was parked in front of the house that Charles Robert Smith shares with his mother, sparking the aforementioned argument. According to charging documents, Shirley Smith called in a complaint to the city, saying her driveway was blocked. The verbal argument became physical.\nSmith pulled out a gun and Mireles tried to grab it before Smith shot Mireles and Segovia. Smith “then stood over Mario Mireles and shot him several more times,” the document says. Smith then went into his house, got a rifle and began firing through a window at people who had come trying to help the mortally wounded men. Smith fatally shot Nicolas Mireles, and wounded Rosalina Segovia, Paul Johnnson and Enner Canales-Hernandez, police said.Twelve minutes later, Charles Smith, 43, was standing at the front door, hands in the air, as he surrendered to police. His neighbor, Mario Alfredo Mireles was laid out on the lawn. Christian Segovia, a friend, had fallen in the space between two Paddington homes. And Nicholas Mireles, Mario's father, was down in front of a neighbor's house. They died at the scene. Rosalina Segovia, 29, Paul Johnson, 28, and Enner Canales-Hernandez, 26, were taken to the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore and are in stable condition, officials said. Neighbors have said that the man made comments that were perceived as disparaging towards Hispanic individuals.\n\n\n== Legal proceedings ==\nAn indictment against Smith was returned by a grand jury on July 21, 2023; a 42-count indictment also includes six charges of attempted first-degree murder. Smith's initial court appearance was scheduled for next Monday. His initial lawyer is no longer representing him.\nMaryland's hate crime law applies to crimes that are motivated either in whole or in substantial part to another person's race, color, religious beliefs, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, disability or national origin. It enables prosecutors to add years to a sentence, and financial penalties. Smith faces up to life in prison without possibility of parole if convicted of first-degree murder.The case's trial will be delayed by a judge for 2025.\n\n\n== See also ==\n2015 Chapel Hill shooting, a shooting that also stemmed from a parking dispute\nAnti-Mexican sentiment\nCapital Gazette shooting, a mass shooting which also took place in Annapolis\nHispanophobia\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Orange Cove HIgh School is a public high school serving students grades 9–12 located in Orange Cove, California, in the Central Valley of California in the United States. It is one of the three high schools operated by the Kings Canyon Unified School District. It is zoned to the city and surrounding communities of Orange Cove, including unincorporated communities within immediately surrounding Fresno County as of 2010. Students participate in the CIF Central Section. In 2023, the school received an mixed ratings from the California Department of Education.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1988, the city had endorsed the proposal to secede from the KCUSD create a new school district and proper high school for Orange Grove and surrounding communities.\nIn 1997, a proposal to pass a bond to build a high school for Orange Grove and perform other general improvements for the district narrowly failed to pass.\nIn 2001, a bond proposal was made that would build a high school for Orange Grove, a school in Dunlap, and other improvements. The Fresno Bee notes that this would be the 11th attempt to pass a bond of its type since the 1960s. By this point, Reedley High School was addressing overcrowding issues with portable buildings. The cost to construct the school was $32 million when a March 2002 bond to build the new school passed after prior proposals had failed.\nConstruction for the high school began in March 2004.\nOrange Cove High School first opened in 2004 was the first high located in Orange Cove. Before its construction, students had to travel to Reedley High School located in Reedley, nearly eight miles from Orange Cove.\n\n\n== Athletics ==\nThe Orange Cove Titans participate in the following sports:\n\nBaseball\nBasketball\nCross country\nFootball\nSoccer\nSoftball\nTennis\nTrack\nVolleyball\nWrestling\n\n\n=== Championships ===\nThe school's football team unexpectedly won the 2007 East Sierra League football championship.\n\n\n== Notable alumni ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n[2]",

        "content": "Patron X was a moniker used by several media outlets for an anonymous audience member at a New York Philharmonic concert whose cell phone rang during a performance of Gustav Mahler's 9th Symphony on January 10, 2012. The conductor Alan Gilbert, who led the performance, stopped the orchestra for several minutes, turning around to face the audience and speak directly to Patron X, who was seated near the front of Avery Fisher Hall. The incident was a remarkable breach of concert etiquette, and was covered by The New York Times and Time Magazine, among others. Patron X's phone played the ubiquitous iPhone ringtone \"Marimba\".\n\n\n== References ==",

        "revision_id": 1219550272,
        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Hyper-E Notation (E# for short) is a notation for large numbers devised by Sbiis Saibian. It was first introduced on his Web book One to Infinity: A Finite Journey on November 19, 2011, and was generalized to Extended Hyper-E Notation (xE# for short).\nE# is not primitive recursive, and specifically the function E(n) = En##n eventually dominates all primitive recursive functions. In fact, in the fast-growing hierarchy, n →E100##n dominates fn for all n < ω and is itself dominated by fω.\nE# and xE# form part of a larger notation, the Extensible-E System, that also encompasses Cascading-E Notation.\nNathan Ho and Wojowu proved termination for the rules of Hyper-E Notation.\n\n\n== Original definition ==\nThe original Hyper-E Notation consists of a sequence an of one or more positive integer arguments separated by hyperions (or hyper marks) #. We notate this as E[b]a1#a2#...#an. b is called the base — if it is omitted, as it often is, it defaults to 10. \"E[b]d\" is also equal to \"b^d\".\nThe three rules are as follows:\n\nRule 1. If there are no hyperions:\nE[b]x = b^x.\nRule 2. If the last entry is 1:\nE[b]a1#a2#a3...#an#1 = E[b]a1#a2#a3...#an\nRule 3. Otherwise(iteration last):\nE[b]a1#a2#a3...#an-2#an-1#an = E[b]a1#a2#a3...#an-2#(E[b]a1#a2#a3...#an-2#an-1#an-1)\nIn plain English:\n\nIf there is only one argument x, the value of the expression is b^x.\nIf the last entry is 1, it may be removed.\nOtherwise...\nEvaluate the original expression, but with the last entry decreased by 1. Call this value z.\nRemove the last two entries of the expression.\nAdd z as an entry to the end of the expression.\nIf there is only one argument x, the value of the expression is .\nIf the last entry is 1, it may be removed.\nOtherwise...\nEvaluate the original expression, but with the last entry decreased by 1. Call this value z.\nRemove the last two entries of the expression.\nAdd z as an entry to the end of the expression.\nThe priority of the rules are stated in the original webpage below the definition, \"There are 3 rules used. If your given a E# expression, you first check to see if rule 1 applies. If it does not you check for rule 2. If that doesn't apply you go to 3.\" It disables an being 1 in the 3rd rule and avoids an overlapping case classification.\n\n\n== Extended definition ==\nExtended Hyper-E Notation allows multiple hyperions to appear between each entry. The number of hyperions following entry an is represented by h(n). For the sake of this definition,  is a shorthand for n successive hyperion marks. For example, a full expression would be written E(b)a1#h(1)a2#h(2)...#h(n-1)an. Saibian uses @ to indicate the rest of the expression such as Bowers uses # to indicate the rest of the array.\nThe difference between original and extended notation is that extended Hyper-E notation allows more than one consecutive #'s.\n\nRule 1. If there are no hyperions:\nE(b)x = b^x.\nRule 2. If the last entry is 1:\nE(b) @ #h(n-1)an#h(n)1 = E(b) @ #h(n-1)an.\nRule 3. If h(n-1)>1:\nE(b) @ #h(n-2)an-1#h(n-1)an = E(b) @ #h(n-2)an-1#h(n-1)-1an-1#h(n-1)an-1.\nRule 4. Otherwise:\nE(b) @ #h(n-2)an-1#an = E(b) @ #h(n-2)(E(b) @ #h(n-2)an-1#an-1 (note #1 = #).\n\n\n== Examples ==\nE6 = E6#1 = 106 = million\nE100 = E100#1 = 10100 = googol\nThis is an example of rule 1 with a one-entry expressions. Since the base defaults to 10, we can abbreviate E(10)100 as E100.\nE100#2 = E(E100#1) = E10100 = 1010100 = googolplex\nE100#3 = E(E100#2) = E1010100 = 101010100 = googolduplex\nThis is an example of rule 3 (rule 4 in the expansion) with a two-entry expressions. In the second expression, the parentheses can be omitted: E(E100#1) = EE100#1.\nE303#1 = E303 = eceton = centillion = 10303\nE303#2 = ecetonplex = EE303 = 1010303\nE303#3 = EEE303 = 101010303 = ecetonduplex\nE1#3 = EEE1 = 101010 = trialogue\nE1#4 = EEEE1 = 10101010 = tetralogue\nE1#10 = EEEEEEEEEE1 = 10^^10 = Decker\nE303#6 = EEEEEE303 = 101010101010303 = ecetonquintiplex\nE1#100 = EEE...EEE1 (100 E's) = giggol\nRepeated application of rule 3: E1#100 = EE1#99 = EEE1#98 = ...\nE100#100 = EEE...EEE100 (100 E's) = grangol\nThis is the same as E1#100, but with a different first entry.\nE100#101 = EEE...EEE100 (101 E's) = grangolplex\nE100#101 = EE100#100 = , hence the name.\nE100#100#2 = E100#(E100#100) = EEE...EEE100 (grangol E's) = grangoldex\nNow we enter three-entry expressions.\nE100#100#3 = E100#(E100#100#2) = E100#(E100#(E100#100)) = EEE...EEE100 (grangoldex E's) = grangoldudex\nIncreasing the value of the third entry makes nesting deeper and deeper.\nE100#100#100#100 = E100#100#(E100#100#100#99) = E100#100#(E100#100#(E100#100#100#98)) = ... gigangol\nFour-entry expressions are similar — they create deeper and deeper nesting in the array level below them. This can also be written as E100##4; the beginning of the next level of the notation.\nE100##100 = E100#100#100#...#100#100#100 with 100 repetitions of 100 = gugold\nNow we have arrived at Extended Hyper-E Notation. Two successive hyperion marks (deutero-hyperions) indicate repetition at the lower level.\nE100##100#100 = graatagold\nThis expression decomposes into Ea##b expressions by applying rule 4 repeatedly.\nE100##100##100 = E100##100#100#...#100#100 with 100 repetitions of 100 = gugolthra\nWe ignore the first ## until the second one has been expanded and all the 100s have been solved.\nE100###100 = E100##100##...##100##100 with 100 repetitions of 100 = throogol\nThree hyperion marks (trito-hyperions) constitute a repetition of two hyperion marks. Remember, the double marks are solved from right to left.\nE100####100 = E100###100###...###100###100 with 100 repetitions of 100 = teroogol\nQuadruple hyperions decompose into triples.\nGodgahlah = E100#####...#####100 with 100 hyperion marks or E100#100100\nSets of 100 hyperion marks decompose into 99s, 99s decompose into 98s, etc. Also note that the superscript 100 means that there are 100 #'s, and should not be confused with E100#(100100).\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sadly Never After (also known as Gert: A Real Muffin Fluffer) is a graphic novel written and illustrated by Skottie Young that was released in five parts throughout 2018 by Image Comics as the fourth volume of the American comic book series I Hate Fairyland, set in the Image Universe. Part 1, Hell of a Trip was released on February 7, 2018, Part 2, There's Magic In That There Cauldron!, was released on March 7, 2018, Part 3, The End!, was released on April 4, 2018, Part 4, Gert In Space!, was released on June 13, 2018, and Part 5, Fuck Fairyland, was released on July 4, 2018.Following the death of Gertrude \"Gert\" in the previous volume, the series follows two new storylines, as Gert is condemned by the devil, Bill, to eternally repeat her quest in an identical copy of Fairyland in a pocket dimension within Hell, while in the real Fairyland, Gert's former companions Duncan Dragon and Larry seek to resurrect her in order to save Fairyland from \"Dark Cloudia\", revived by Horribella. Produced as the final volume of the series, it was followed by the spin-off anthology series The Untold Tales of I Hate Fairyland in 2021, and a revival series, beginning with the story arc Gert's Inferno, in 2022, again written by Young with a new illustration team.The series has received a universally positive critical reception.\n\n\n== Premise ==\n\n\n=== Part One: Hell of a Trip ===\nFollowing her death and descent into Hell in Good Girl, Gert finds \"Happy\" to actually be the devil, Bill assuming her form, who after failing to torment Gert with a twisted version of her childhood home, creates an identical version of Fairyland within Hell, condemning her to an eternity of repeating her quest.\n\n\n=== Part Two: There's Magic In That There Cauldron ===\nThe witch Horribella calls Bill and demands \"her\" bones as payment for causing Gert's death, which Bill has delivered to her through Duncan Dragon, who has become a postal courier after learning how to fly. Planning to bring about the end of Fairyland, Horribella revives the figure to life as a powerful undead being who kills her and declares \"I Hate Fairyland!\" before going on a rampage.\n\n\n=== Part Three: The End! ===\nThe undead being is revealed as \"Dark Cloudia\", a corrupted version of the former Fairyland Queen Cloudia. Reasoning that since Cloudia was returned to life, Gert can be brought back to, Duncan recruits Larry to track down and confront the Fairyland Council to resurrect Gert to save Fairyland. The Council initially refuse, citing the rules of Fairyland, but Duncan retorts that the rules, and the council, are directly responsible for the crisis, and that by kidnapping children like him and Gertrude, they have abdicated any moral authority. Conceding that Duncan is correct, the council orders Bill to deliver the pocket dimension containing Gertrude's Hell to the council chamber.\n\n\n=== Part Four: Gert In Space! ===\nIn her personal Hell, Gert, having recruited the pocket dimension's generated version of a younger Larry, commandeering the spaceship of an astronaut in an attempt to escape, is surprised when Duncan and Larry enter Hell and inform Gertrude about Dark Cloudia. Agreeing to kill Cloudia again, she exists the pocket dimension and returns to life along with the Hell-generated Larry. On learning her actions would serve the Council's purpose, Gert attempts to renege on the deal, only for the Council to promise to return Gert home if she succeeds in defeating Cloudia, noting that as she is now a force of pure darkness, Gert must become a force of good, combining their powers to forcibly empower her with their combined magic.The title is a reference to the Muppets skit Pigs in Space.\n\n\n=== Part Five: Fuck Fairyland ===\nAs Dark Cloudia destroys the army of the current Fairyland monarch, King Cone, she is attacked by the empowered Gert, who embarks in a brawl with her across Fairyland with her new magical powers, depowering Cloudia and beating her up. Sick and tired of violence, on Larry's advice, Gert decides against killing Cloudia again, and hands the defeated villain over to King Cone to be imprisoned for her crimes. The Council then appears, angry because Gert didn't kill Cloudia, in spite of having technically fulfilled their request to simply \"defeat\" her, threatening to exile Gert to a remote place in Fairyland, until Gert reminds them per their own rules that they cannot take back their combined magic from her until acknowledging she had defeated Cloudia and returning her home, and could use it to kill them unless they honored their part of the deal.Fearful, the Council quickly sends Gert back home, much to Larry's sorrow (who had been unable to say \"You're welcome.\" to Gert's \"Thank you.\" for looking after her and truly having raised her over all her years in Fairyland), who hopes Gert enjoys the life she has fought for all these years. On Earth, Gert, now an adult woman in her thirties, finds herself employed as a clerk in a television station, frustrated by her mundane existence and looking for a way to return, before abandoning her search and cursing Fairyland one last time before getting back to work, determined to face her lot in life.\n\n\n== Development ==\nIn June 2018, Skottie Young quietly announced that the then-ongoing fourth volume of I Hate Fairyland would be its last, via a variant cover for Gert In Space!. On the release of the final issue in July 2023, Young elaborated on his reasoning for ending the series and the potential for the series to return, stating:\n\n\"That's right, I just finished inking the last panel on the last page of I Hate Fairyland #20. What I've known for a while, but you just found out, was that's the last page of the series, at least for now. I know, some of you are probably cursing my name right now while some of you are saying, \"It's about time.\" Either way, I knew it was time for me to bring Gert's story to an end for the time being. I LOVED writing and drawing this series [and] was blown away by the support and love you all had for it [but] as much fun as this was, I started having other ideas [and] knew that I didn't have the time to carry on writing and drawing an ongoing series [and] develop a brand new project [and so] made the choice to bring [I Hate Fairyland] to the ending I always saw for Gert.\"\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n== Collected editions ==\n\n\n== Follow-ups ==\nIn the final issue of Madly Ever After, then-intended as the final chapter of I Hate Fairyland as a whole, Skottie Young expressed interest in one-day returning to the series, stating:\n\n\"I'll tease a little of the future. While this is the end of I HATE FAIRYLAND as an ongoning series, that doesn't mean we can't drop into the world from time to time, whether it be a one-shot of a mini-series of \"TALES OF\"-style stories. Nothing is on the schedule just yet, but talks have been had and ideas have been scribbled down. So for now it's not a GOOD-BYE, but more of a SEE YA LATER.\"\nIn August 2021, Young confirmed I Hate Fairyland would return later that year with the spin-off midquel anthology series The Unbelievable, Unfortunately Mostly Unreadable, and Nearly Unpublishable Untold Tales of I Hate Fairyland!, to be written by him along with a revolving team of new artists, and set during the events of the first four volumes, to be published freely to his Substack newsletter ahead of an Image Comics publication, while the main series would be revived in 2022 with a new #1 issue, in what would become Gert's Inferno, with Brett Bean replacing Young as the series' primary artist, following Gert as she is paid to return to Fairyland to rescue a missing child.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSadly Never After at Image Comics",

It is the United States' representative in the Comité Maritime International. \n\n\n== Activities ==\nThe association was formed in 1899 with the goal of having the United States become part of a globally unified maritime law system. While they do not lobby, they have written resolutions endorsing certain political (such as a congressional overturn of Wilburn Boat) and judicial decisions.\nThey have been strong supporters of US ratification of UNCLOS and the Rotterdam Rules.\nThe MLAUS has multiple committees for specialties within maritime law. It also has a proctor credential program for experienced maritime attorneys.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Dionys Schönecker  (29 April 1888 – 14 September 1938) was an Austrian football player, coach and official at SK Rapid Vienna. He also managed one the Austrian national team in a single match in 1914.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nDionys Schönecker was born on 29 April 1888 in Vienna as the son of a factory worker. Professionally, he completed an apprenticeship as a typesetter and worked in the Steyrermühl paper factory. He began playing football together with his older brother Eduard.\n\n\n== Football career ==\nIn 1906, Schönecker joined the football section of the Sportklub Rapid, at the age of 18, where he initially played in the reserve team and since 1907 in the first team as a right winger. Unlike his brother, who was also called up to the national team, Dionys did not establish himself as an important footballer. After playing a few matches in Rapid's first team, and after a short loan to Wiener Sportklub, he retired in 1910, at the age of just 22, and went on to become the youngest manager in the history of the club.\n\n\n== Managerial career ==\n\n\n=== Saving Rapid ===\nThe appointment of the only 22-year-old as the main person responsible for sport and business was actually an emergency solution. Rapid was going through a crisis at that time, being on the verge of collapse after having been abandoned by almost all of its players. The management of the heavily indebted club had resigned as a whole, and the majority of the players had also turned their backs on the club, and to make the situation even worse, the city of Vienna had canceled the lease for the Rudolfsheim sports field, the area of which was needed to expand the Meiselmarkt, which left Rapid homeless virtually overnight.\nDespite taking charge of the club during this difficult phase, the 22-year-old typesetter Schönecker took courage, made a virtue of necessity and saved Rapid by using the players from the youth department to build a new team around Josef Brandstetter and \"Rigo\" Kuthan, whose sister Emilie he would later marry. To the surprise of many, given that until then the team had certainly not shone in terms of results, this young Rapid side won the title in the championship that was held for the first time in 1911–12. In addition to his intuition to focus on the development of young players, Schönecker also adopted a new game scheme, the so-called Kombinationsspiel, made up of short and fast passes, which replaced the old \"Kick and rush\" (literally: \"football and running\"), and thus was born the \"Viennese school\", which in the following years produced some of the most successful teams on the European continent.\nSchönecker was also visionary economically, leasing land from the Hütteldorf parish on which his brother Eduard, who had now become a sought-after stadium architect, built the legendary Pfarrwiese, which opened in April 1912 and served as Rapid's home until 1978, and which naturally also contributed to the club's great success. This move to the outskirts of the city also meant that their mostly wealthy owners began to take an interest in their new neighbors, and Schönecker took advantage of this fact, winning over numerous artists, doctors, and entrepreneurs as wealthy members and sponsors for the club. In this way, Rapid not only managed to become financially healthy within a few years, but also gradually expanded the parish meadow so that it could eventually accommodate 25,000 spectators. Nevertheless, Schönecker always emphasized the SCR's proletarian roots, and in fact, he liked to begin his legendary speeches with the following words: \"Gentlemen, we are workers, and as workers we must work!\".\n\n\n=== National supremacy and Mitropa Cup title ===\nIn the following years, Schönecker consolidated Rapid's status as Austria's most successful team, winning the title in 1912–13 without a single defeat, which was followed by the fifth championship title and the first cup victory in 1918–19. The club then won the double again in the next season. However, the First World War had ended and Austria, having become a republic, was going through a period of crisis, so the 1920s were characterized by the scarcity of financial resources which weighed on the results of the club, who suffered a title drought until winning the championship again in 1922–23, but the team then finished in fourth place in both 1923–24 and 1924–25, and even worse in 1925–26, when it was fifth, up to that point the worst result in the club's history.\nMeanwhile, in 1924, the transition to professionalism was made official with the birth of the Vienna Football Association, which created the new I. Liga championship. Until 1926, the leader of the football section also acted as the team's coach, but after a few less successful years, it was Schönecker himself who made a change, resigning as coach and designating one of his former players, Edi Bauer, as his successor, while he remained at the helm of the section. With Bauer, Rapid became champions in 1929 and 1930 (for the 10th time) and reached three international finals in the Mitropa Cup (1927, 1928, and 1930), winning it for the first time at the third time of asking in 1930, thus becoming the first Austrian team to do so. Bauer still is the most successful coach in the club's history.\nSchönecker remained the dominant man in the club as the leader of the football section until September 1938, when after suffering from appendicitis, the 50-year-old was operated on, but still died a few days later on 14 September. In his last season (1937–38), Rapid won the national title, Schönecker's 12th between the bench and management. During Schönecker's 28 years as head of the club between 1910 and 1938, Rapid became champions 12 times, won the Cup three times, and won the Mitropa Cup once.\n\n\n== In the national team ==\nOn 8 November 1914, Schönecker, together with his colleague Wilhelm Schmieger, oversaw the Austrian national team in a friendly match organized with the aim of raising funds for the Red Cross, which ended in a 1–2 loss to Hungary in Vienna.\n\n\n== Management style ==\nHis management style was often described as authoritarian, almost dictatorial, and when there were disciplinary problems with a player, the offending player was often quickly thrown out, with a famous example of this being Josef Bican in 1935, since he was not used to compromising even with the strongest players of the time. He subordinated everything, including his private life, to his declared goal of making Rapid the best team in Europe, and he also expected the same from his players. However, Schönecker himself sometimes also had disciplinary problems, especially at derbies; for instance, in the scandalous game in the spring of 1937 in which, due to injuries and exclusions, there were only 6 Rapid players on the field when the score was 0–5, the referee wisely blew his whistle and Schönecker immediately ran up to him and gave his unprintable opinion, which earned him a hefty fine.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nAt his death in 1938, Schönecker was already considered a living symbol of Rapid, and in fact, as early as 1935 he was awarded the Republic's Silver Medal of Honor for his services. Despite all the titles won under his leadership, his most lasting legacy remains that he anchored the Rapid virtues of community spirit, fighting spirit, and the will to win in the club mentality. In doing so, he coined the \"Rapid Spirit\", of which he is now rightly regarded as the father of (\"Mister Rapid\").\nIn 1985, the Schöneckergasse street in Vienna-Penzing (14th district) was named after him. The statue of Dionys Schönecker still stands outside the old Pfarrwiese ground, surviving the transition from Gerhard-Hanappi-Stadion to Allianz.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of longest managerial reigns in association football\n\n\n== References ==",

It is designated, in its entirety, as the unsigned New York State Route 901A (NY 901A).\n\n\n== Route description ==\n\nSimeon Woods Road provides access to the Suffolk County Government Complex and the New York State Office Building from the Long Island Expressway (Interstate 495, I-495). It begins at Express Drive North, the northern (westbound) service road of the Long Island Expressway. It then continues north-northeast, soon intersecting County Route 6 (CR 6, Rabro Drive)]] at a signalized intersection. It then continues north-northeast before eventually curving towards the north, before intersecting Kings Highway, where the NY 901A designation terminates.\nNorth of Kings Highway, the road becomes Raoul Wallenberg Drive, providing access to various government buildings and to NY 347/NY 454.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the 1970s, much of Simeon Woods Road was proposed by New York State to be upgraded to serve as a major spur highway, connecting the Long Island Expressway and the Smithtown Bypass (NY 347). However, these plans to turn Simeon Woods Road into a spur highway were eventually scrapped, and the NY 347 designation was instead extended westward along NY 454 to the interchange with the Northern State Parkway.\n\n\n== Major intersections ==\nThe entire route is in Suffolk County.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Reference Routes in New York\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "On December 31, 2005, American mass media company Viacom split into two companies: the second CBS Corporation, its successor (the first being a short lived rename of Westinghouse Electric) which holds the namesake flagship channel Columbia Broadcasting System, CBS News, CBS Sports, Showtime Networks, UPN (Replaced by the CW, co-owned by TimeWarner), Smithsonian Channel, Channel 10, PopTV, and Simon and Schuster, and an entirely new Viacom which holds Paramount Pictures, Nickelodeon, Nick Jr., Noggin, Nicktoons, TEENick, Music Television, Black Entertainment Television, Video Hits One, Country Music Television, and later DreamWorks, respectively. It was first announced in March 2005. The companies are controlled under National Amusements' control because of a stagnating stock price. \nThey would later re-merge into ViacomCBS, later Paramount Global.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nIn 1952, CBS formed CBS Television Film Sales, a division which handled syndication rights for CBS's library of network-owned television series. This division was renamed CBS Films in 1958, again renamed CBS Enterprises in January 1968, and finally renamed Viacom (an acronym of Video and Audio Communications) in 1970. In 1971, this syndication division was spun off amid new FCC rules forbidding television networks from owning syndication companies (these rules were eventually abolished completely in 1993). In 1985, Viacom purchased MTV Networks and Showtime/The Movie Channel Inc. from Warner Communications and American Express. In 1987, Viacom was acquired by theater operator company National Amusements. In 1999, Viacom made its biggest acquisition to date by announcing plans to merge with its former parent CBS Corporation (the renamed Westinghouse Electric Corporation, which had merged with CBS in 1995). The merger was completed in 2000, resulting in CBS reuniting with its former syndication division. \n\n\n== Split ==\nAfter the departure of Mel Karmazin in 2004, Sumner Redstone, who served as chairman and chief executive officer, decided to split the offices of president and chief operating officer between Moonves and Freston. Redstone was set to retire in the near future, and a split was seen as a creative solution to the matter of replacing him. It was also intended to provide alternative investments that would be more appealing to investors: one a high cash flow, lower growth company that could afford to pay a substantial dividend and the other a growing company that would have greater investment opportunities and therefore would not be expected to pay a dividend.\nIn March 2005, Viacom contemplated splitting the company into two publicly traded companies, amid issues of the stock price stagnating and clashing corporate cultures between the cable and broadcast divisions, which came to a head with the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy a year previous with the MTV-produced show causing controversy for game broadcaster CBS.\nOn June 14, 2005, the Viacom board of directors approved the split of the company into two firms. The CBS Corporation name would be revived for one of the companies, to be headed by longtime television executive (and Viacom co-president) Les Moonves, and would include the namesake television network CBS, UPN, Infinity Broadcasting Corporation, Viacom Outdoor, Showtime Networks, and Paramount Television.\nThe split was structured such that the second Viacom was spun off from the first Viacom, which was renamed CBS Corporation. In a sense, this was a repeat of the 1971 spin-off. However, in this case, CBS retained virtually all of the prior firm's broadcast television assets, including its various syndication companies.\nCBS said: \"In many ways, today's decision is a natural extension of the path we laid out in creating Viacom,\" Redstone said in a company-wide memo. \"We are retaining the significant advantages we captured in the Paramount and CBS mergers and, at the same time, recognizing the need to adapt to a changing competitive environment.\"\nWith the split, the two companies began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on January 3, 2006. Investors anticipated Viacom benefiting from the split, but instead, it dropped approximately 20 percent, while CBS Corporation rose 9 percent, that same year, Paramount Parks became a wholly-owned theme park unit of CBS Corporation.\nThe second Viacom was created by Redstone and headed by Freston. It consisted of BET Networks, MTV Networks, and Paramount Pictures. It started trading on January 3, 2006.\nDespite the split, both companies are controlled by National Amusements.\n\n\n== Re-merge ==\nOn August 13, 2019, CBS and Viacom officially announced their merger; the combined company was to be named ViacomCBS, with Shari Redstone serving as chair. Upon the merger agreement, Viacom and CBS jointly announced that the transaction is expected to close by the end of 2019, pending regulatory and shareholder approvals. The merger required approval by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).\n\nOn October 28, 2019, the merger was approved by National Amusements, which then announced the deal would close in early December; the recombined company trades its shares on Nasdaq under the symbols \"VIAC\" and \"VIACA\" after CBS Corporation delisted its shares on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

While much of the land was sold off and used for timber, Howard's family continued to occupy the house at least through 1992.  The house is a one-story, Greek Revival structure with an inset front porch.  The façade is five bays wide, and the central entrance has double doors with multi-light sidelights and transom.  The interior is a triple-pile center-hall plan.  Outbuildings include a frame barn, a two-room detached kitchen, and the family cemetery.\nThe house was listed on the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage in 1982 and the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Spanish illumination of the Early Middle Ages is the art of decorating books that developed in Spain from the 8th to the 11th. The country was marked by the Muslim occupation from 711, which tended to isolate it from the rest of Europe. In the regions that remained Christian, first in the Kingdom of Asturias and then in León, an original art was invented in monasteries, mixing Visigothic, Carolingian, and also Moorish influences.\n\n\n== Origins ==\nUntil the 10th, illuminated manuscripts from the Iberian Peninsula are extremely rare. They mainly come from three origins, each contributing to the formation of the original style that develops thereafter.\n\n\n=== Visigothic manuscripts ===\n\nThe Visigothic culture corresponds to the period between the arrival of the Germanic people in the Iberian Peninsula during the 5th and the fall of the Visigothic kingdom in 711. This culture is not so much that of the Germanic invaders as that of Hispano-Roman Spain, which continued and even fully flourished during this period. Numerous manuscripts are produced during this period, in several centers such as Mérida, Toledo, Zaragoza, or Seville. It is in this last city that the most famous intellectual of the time, Isidore of Seville, author of the Etymologies, is located. However, a single figurative decoration is preserved in a manuscript from this period. It is a wind rose present in a collection of prayers now in the chapter library of the cathedral of Verona but originally from Tarragona. This decoration is inspired by an ancient motif here Christianized by the presence of the cross. The other illuminations of Visigothic manuscripts still preserved are limited to small sometimes colored initials. For the rest, one can only guess the type of decorations that could exist based on manuscripts copied from Visigothic models. The most visible influence on manuscripts of the following periods is especially present in the writing: the Visigothic minuscule, created at this time, continues to be used in Spanish monastic scriptoria until the 12th.\n\n\n=== Asturian manuscripts ===\n\nWhile the most active centers of Visigothic art are undoubtedly in the south, from 711, Christian art is now limited to the north of the country, and more specifically to the Kingdom of Asturias, in Navarre and Catalonia. While the latter two maintained close ties with the rest of Europe, a more original art develops in Asturias, without direct relation to Visigothic culture. It is in this kingdom that the monk Beatus of Liébana writes a commentary on the Apocalypse in a manuscript already richly illuminated but now lost. This text and its decorations subsequently enjoy great prosperity in manuscripts of the following centuries in Spain.\nAmong the manuscripts preserved from this period, some are modestly illuminated, with initials, frames, crosses – typical of Asturian art – as well as labyrinth compositions usually containing the name of the manuscript's patron. The most famous Asturian manuscript of this period is the Bible of La Cava, now preserved at the abbey of La Cava in Italy and dated from the 9th. It is decorated with crosses, writings, and colored and gilded backgrounds, framed titles, and zoomorphic initials. These decorations seem partly derived from the art brought by the Arabs to the peninsula. In several manuscripts of the same origin, motifs of Kufic inspiration are found. Small characters also have an elongated eye in the shape of a tear, in the Andalusian model. If these motifs have a moderate influence for the following period, Asturian manuscripts especially mark the beginning of a renewed interest in illumination in the Spanish regions that remained Christian.\n\n\n=== Mozarabic manuscripts ===\n\nThe Mozarabic art refers to the art practiced by Christians in Islamic territory in the Iberian Peninsula also called Al-Andalus. However, Islamic manuscripts or those decorated on the territory of Al-Andalus at this time from the to the beginning of the 21st century are very poorly preserved and therefore little known. It seems likely that the decoration of Qurans from this period was limited to geometric illuminations framing the titles of the suras, for example. A single manuscript executed by Mozarabic Christians still preserved contains illuminations. It is a bible from Seville also called biblia hispalense, dating from the end of the 9th century and completed with miniatures representing three prophets at the end of the 10th century. All its decoration, made of zoomorphic initials and friezes framing titles, are of Muslim inspiration, even containing mentions in Arabic script. The model of the prophets' representations is more difficult to determine due to a lack of contemporary references. According to John W. Williams, this manuscript does not seem to prove that Mozarabic art would be at the origin of the illumination that will be practiced in the following period in northern Spain. Mozarabic art does not seem to have influenced the abundant use of bright colors that appear at the time in the north of the country.\n\n\n== The golden age of Leonese illumination ==\nThe beginning of the reconquest of the territories ceded to the Moors starts as early as the 8th but it is especially the campaigns led by Alfonso III of Asturias (848–910) that allow occupying a much larger territory. His conquests extend notably to the entire current territory of the province of León, which becomes the new capital, thus forming the kingdom of the same name. These new territories, very depopulated, are subject to a recolonization which is entrusted in particular to several monasteries. The scribes and illuminators of these establishments participate in creating a new own style of manuscript painting that continues until the beginning of the 12th century.\n\n\n=== Contexts of creation ===\n\nThe authors of these manuscripts and their place of creation are relatively well known for several of them thanks to the frequent presence of a colophon. These works were almost all executed by a monk in a monastic scriptorium for an abbot. Most often, the scribe is at the same time the originator of the miniatures. Sometimes, the author is a woman, from a double monastery. They are sometimes represented in one of the miniatures of the manuscript. This is the case of the Beatus of Tábara in which the scriptorium within a tower is represented with the illuminator and the scribe accompanied by an assistant. Among the most productive establishments are: the, that of San Miguel d'Esacalada, to the Monastery of San Millán de la Cogolla and Albelda in the east.\n\n\n=== Types of manuscripts ===\n\n\n==== The Bibles ====\nSeveral Bibles are decorated at this time. One of the oldest Leonese manuscripts is precisely a Bible dated 920: it contains decorations typical of Asturian illumination (cross, labyrinth, wind rose), but over very large surfaces and accompanied by a large number of human representations. Another Leonese Bible dated 960 contains even more decorations, reaching up to 100 miniatures just in the Old Testament. These miniatures are directly inspired by an old Visigothic Bible now lost. The Bible of 960 was itself probably copied from a Bible completed in 943 and also lost. A hundred other Bibles inspired by this last model were copied in the north of Spain until the 13th.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== The Beatus ====\n\nThe Commentary on the Apocalypse by Beatus of Liébana consists of short quotes from the Apocalypse followed by interpretations, compiling various older Christian exegeses. The book of the Apocalypse then had a particular importance in Spain. His commentary, written by Beatus, enjoyed great success in Spanish monasteries and more than 20 illuminated manuscripts copied and illuminated between the 10th and the 21st century are still preserved. Each contains or contained about sixty miniatures illustrating each passage of the book of Saint John. The cycle of illustration was probably established at the time of Beatus of Liébana, during the 21st century but the oldest preserved manuscript, in fragment, dates only from the second half of the 21st century (fragment of the Beatus of Silos, library of the monastery of Santo-Domingo). However, the definitive cycle probably dates back to the following century, that is 108 miniatures in total of which 68 for the text of the Apocalypse.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Other types of manuscripts ====\nOther types of works, rarer, collect similar decorations. This is the case of the Morals on Job, which had been written by Pope Gregory the Great at the request of Leander of Seville, brother of Isidore, of which a richly illustrated version is preserved at the National Library of Spain. Several collections of conciliar canons are also decorated, such as the Codex conciliar of Albelda (Escorial, d.1.2) or the Codex Aemaliensis (Escorial, d.1.1). There are, however, very few liturgical manuscripts commissioned by aristocrats: for example, the prayer book of Ferdinand and Sancha in the middle of the 21st century but whose content is already very influenced by Romanesque illumination.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Characteristics ===\nLeonese painting favors full-page miniatures, even on a double page. They very frequently use very bright colors in large flat areas. According to Williams, this use of color may come from models from Insular illumination, but also from Merovingian and Carolingian illuminations.\n\n\n==== Human representation ====\nUnlike previous periods, human representation becomes a central element in Spanish illumination. However, unlike antique illumination, there is no search for realism or plasticity in these human figures: they are all flat, without relief, simply rendering a width and a height but without any thickness or shadow. They are traced in line but with many colors. In the same way, the space in which they are located is also without any rendering of depth. It is, on the contrary, geometric, sometimes inscribed in a circle and often limited to representations of bands of bright colors.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nFrom the 940s also, manuscripts from the north of Spain are particularly influenced, albeit belatedly, by Carolingian illumination. Within the human figures, they adopt the use of drapery, which better accounts for the different parts of the body, but without giving an illusion of thickness.\n\n\n==== Other decorations and motifs ====\nOther motifs are taken from Carolingian illumination: it is the decoration of initials, in the form of panels of interlace and knots.\nSeveral motifs are also taken from Islamic art in general, without necessarily referring to a possible enemy in the iconography that uses them. These include split palmettes (as in the Omega of the Bible of 960), the horseshoe arch, the representation of the peacock.\n\n\n=== Related articles ===\nMozarabic art\nVisigothic art\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n== References ==",

The EP contains 8 tracks, including the lead single \"Girls' Night\".\n\n\n== Background and release ==\nOn February 4, 2024, group member Hyunjin announced that the group was preparing for \"comeback season\" and continued to tease the future release on fan messaging app Fab until March 15, when CTDENM announced via the group's official social media account that the upcoming second EP would be titled One of a Kind and was to be released on April 16. \nThe release date was immediately met with backlash from fans, as April 16, 2024 was to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the Sinking of MV Sewol. On March 19th, the company posted on the group's fanclub site that the release date would be pushed back one day to the 15th.\nThe track list was released on April 12, with the music video teaser and highlight medley following over the course of the next two days. The EP and music video for the lead single Girls' Night were released at the same time at 6:00 PM KST on April 15, 2024\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sierra Leone (foaled March 31, 2021) is a multiple-Grade winning American Thoroughbred racehorse. In 2024, as a three-year-old colt, he won the Grade 1 Blue Grass Stakes at Keeneland.\n\n\n== Background ==\nSierra Leone is a dark bay or brown colt who was bred in Kentucky by Debby Oxley. The Oxley family has long been involved with breeding and owner, primarily with John Oxley, Debby's husband.Oxley family's influence on the breeding of Sierra Leone goes back to the second dam, Darling My Darling, whom John Oxley purchased for $300,000 during the 1998 Keeneland September Yearling Sale. Darling My Darling retired with earnings of $352,359 in 13 efforts with a record of 5–2–1. Darling My Darling went on to produce 14 foals, two of which were graded winning fillies; Forever Darling captured the Grade II Santa Ynez Stakes for her connections, and Heavenly Love, the dam of Sierra Leone won the 2017 Grade I Alcibiades Stakes for the Oxleys and trainer Mark E. Casse. Heavenly Love retired with earnings of $346,200 from 10 starts with a record of 2–0–2.On August 9, 2022, Sierra Leone, consigned by Gainesway as Hip 202 at the Saratoga Sale, Fasig-Tipton's select yearling sale in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. was sold for US$2.3 million to Coolmore Stud's Michael V. Magnier in partnership with Peter Brant of White Birch Farm. Sierra Leone's sire Gun Runner was the third-ranked sire by both gross ($5,635,000) and average ($704,375) from eight horses sold of nine offered at the sale. In 2023 Gun Runner was the third ranked sire in progeny earnings with $17,532,118. In 2024 Gun Runner stands at Three Chimneys Farm in Kentucky for US$250,000.\nIn 2023 Coolmore Stud expanded the owner partnership of the horse to include Derrick Smith, Michael Tabor, Westerburg and Rocket Ship Racing. In 2024 Rocket Ship Racing registered back to Brook T. Smith.Sierra Leone is trained by Chad C. Brown.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 2023: two-year-old season ===\nSierra Leone made his debut on November 4 in a maiden special weight event over 1 mile at Aqueduct Racetrack. Sierra Leone started from post 5, bobbled the start was roused three wide on the turn, came five wide into upper stretch, and comfortable won with Manuel Franco aboard by one and one-quarter lengths in a time of 1:36.94.In his next start on December 2, Sierra Leone started in the Grade II Remsen Stakes at Aqueduct Racetrack a Road to the Kentucky Derby prep event over 1+1⁄8 miles. Sierra Leone dropped back between horses after the start, but made a five wide drive rallying from last in the field of 10 as the horses entered the stretch run. Sierra Leone poked his head in front of the leader Dornoch with a furlong to run but the latter fought back and won by a nose on the line in a time of 1:50.30 over a muddy, sealed track.\n\n\n=== 2024: three-year-old season ===\nOn February 17, 2024, Sierra Leone began his three-year-old campaign in the Grade II Risen Star Stakes at Fair Grounds Race Course in New Orleans. Starting as the 23/10 favorite Sierra Leone was unhurried early on and uncorked his winning rally in the stretch, prevailing by a half-length over his competition in the 1+1⁄8-mile event.In his next start on April 6, in the Grade I Blue Grass Stakes at Keeneland Sierra Leone did not want to load in the starting gate delaying the start by a couple of minutes. Sierra Leone rallied from ninth to overhaul Just a Touch late in the stretch to win the event by 1+1⁄2 lengths with his Remsen rival Dornoch finishing in fourth. The winning time of 1:50.08 was moderate for the 1+1⁄8-mile. Jockey Tyler Gaffalione commented after the race, \"He has so much ability, and he does things so easily. We haven't even gotten close to the bottom of him yet.\" He attributed the horse's gate antics to getting worked up as the final horse to load on the far outside in front of a large crowd at Keeneland.As a result of his wins in the Risen Star Stakes and Blue Grass Stakes, Sierra Leone finished first in the qualification standings in the Road to the Kentucky Derby and enters the Kentucky Derby as one of the probable favorites.\n\n\n== Statistics ==\n\n\n== Pedigree ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Alma Faye Brooks is an American-born Canadian disco singer. She is most noted as a two-time Juno Award nominee for Best New Female Vocalist, receiving nods at the Juno Awards of 1978 and the Juno Awards of 1980.Born in Tyler, Texas, she moved to Montreal, Quebec, at age 12 with her family. Living in the Little Burgundy neighbourhood, she sang at the Union United Church, and had a musical theatre role in a production of Hair.In 1977 she released her debut single \"Stop, I Don't Need No Sympathy\", a cover of a song previously performed by Lynn Roman.In 1979 she released the album Doin' It, which spawned the singles \"It's Over\" and \"Don't Fall In Love\". Her performances to support the album included an appearance on Whatever Turns You On, a short-lived prime-time version of the long-running sketch comedy/variety series You Can't Do That on Television. However, with the disco genre in commercial decline around this time, she did not release another album, and reemerged in the late 1980s in Montreal's local live music scene, performing Motown music by artists such as Aretha Franklin and The Supremes at \"Soul Unlimited\" events at the Rising Sun club.\nShe has continued to perform as a singer with La Gioventu, a dance music band in Montreal led by her husband, Louis Toteda. Following the death of disco icon Donna Summer in 2012, she began performing Donna Summer songs with La Gioventu in tribute.Her song \"Thank You\", from Doin' It, was used in the soundtrack to the 2023 film Solo.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "NGC 646 is a large barred spiral galaxy located in the constellation Hydrus. Its speed relative to the cosmic microwave background is 8,145 ± 19 km/s, which corresponds to a Hubble distance of 120.1 ± 8.4 Mpc (∼392 million ly). NGC 646 was discovered by British astronomer John Herschel in 1834. It forms an interacting galaxy pair.\n\n\n== Luminosity ==\nThe luminosity class of NGC 646 is III. It has surface brightness equal to 14.69 mag/am2. NGC 646 is a low surface brightness galaxy (LSB). LSB galaxies are diffuse (D) galaxies with a surface brightness less than one magnitude lower than that of the ambient night sky.\n\n\n== Distance ==\nThe Hubble distance of PGC 6014, the galaxy to the east of NGC 646, is 106.4 ± 7.5 Mpc (∼347 million ly). A distance of approximately 45 million light years therefore separates these two galaxies which appear to be neighbors in the image. Their gravitational interaction, if there is any interaction, should therefore be of short duration.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of NGC objects (1–1000)\nInteracting galaxy\n\n\n== External links ==\nNGC 646 at SIMBAD\n\n\n== References ==",

The race is scheduled to be held on Saturday, April 20, 2024, at Talladega Superspeedway in Lincoln, Alabama, a 2.66 miles (4.28 km) permanent asphalt quad-oval shaped superspeedway. The race is scheduled to be contested over 113 laps.\nThis will also be the third and final race of the Dash 4 Cash. Drivers who are eligible for the Dash 4 Cash are Sam Mayer, Ryan Sieg, Justin Allgaier, and A. J. Allmendinger, since they were the highest finishing Xfinity Series regulars following the race at Texas.\n\n\n== Report ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\n\nTalladega Superspeedway, formerly known as Alabama International Motor Speedway, is a motorsports complex located north of Talladega, Alabama. It is located on the former Anniston Air Force Base in the small city of Lincoln. A tri-oval, the track was constructed in 1969 by the International Speedway Corporation, a business controlled by the France family. Talladega is most known for its steep banking. The track currently hosts NASCAR's Cup Series, Xfinity Series and Craftsman Truck Series. Talladega is the longest NASCAR oval with a length of 2.66-mile-long (4.28 km) tri-oval like the Daytona International Speedway, which is 2.5-mile-long (4.0 km).\n\n\n==== Entry list ====\n(R) denotes rookie driver.\n(i) denotes driver who is ineligible for series driver points.\n\n\n== Qualifying ==\nQualifying was held on Friday, April 19, at 4:30 PM CST. Since Talladega Superspeedway is a superspeedway, the qualifying system used is a single-car, single-lap system with two rounds. In the first round, drivers will be on track by themselves and will have one lap to set a time. The fastest ten drivers from the first round move on to the second and final round. Whoever sets the fastest time in Round 2 will win the pole.\nAustin Hill, driving for Richard Childress Racing, would advance from the preliminary round and set the fastest time in Round 2, with a lap of 52.723, and a speed of 181.629 mph (292.304 km/h).\nGarrett Smithley was the only driver who failed to qualify. Smithley had original made the race, but his time would be disallowed after a roof hatch came loose during his qualifying attempt. Mason Massey, who originally failed to qualify, would take his place on the grid.\n\n\n=== Qualifying results ===\n\n\n== Race results ==\nStage 1 Laps: 25\n\nStage 2 Laps: 25\n\nStage 3 Laps: 63\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The SAM Colombia Flight 601 was a Lockheed L-188 Electra, which was hijacked when it was scheduled to fly from Alfonso Bonilla Aragón International Airport of Cali to José María Córdova International Airport in Medellín, with a stop at Matecaña International Airport in Pereira on May 30, 1973. It was one of the longest hijackings in the history of commercial aviation. 84 passengers were on board with at least four crew members.The hijacking began after the plane stopped in Pereira, perpetrated by two former football players from Paraguay who initially claimed affiliation with the National Liberation Army (ELN). Armed and presenting varying demands, they initially sought to negotiate with the Colombian government for the release of all passengers and crew in exchange for a substantial ransom and the release of certain ELN members, expressing a desire to flee to Cuba. However, the government doubted their ELN membership, refusing direct negotiations with the hijackers. Consequently, the hijackers negotiated with the airline instead. After forcing the plane to land at Queen Beatrix International Airport in Aruba, where they released some passengers but failed to secure money, they directed the pilot to head to Jorge Chávez International Airport in Lima. A technical issue forced a return to Aruba, during which some passengers escaped due to the hijackers' oversight. Eventually, they reached Lima, where they negotiated for fuel and new pilots. The hijackers then decided to make stops in several South American cities: Guayaquil, Mendoza, Buenos Aires, Resistencia, and finally Asunción, where the hijacking ended after more than 60 hours.The hijackers, former football players Eusebio Borja and Francisco \"Toro\" Solano López, confessed to the crew that their sole motivation was financial. As the hijacking progressed, they sought notoriety and aimed to set a record for its duration. Borja disembarked at Resistencia International Airport and managed to evade capture; he has not been seen since. Solano López was apprehended at Silvio Pettirossi International Airport by Paraguayan police and subsequently extradited to Colombia. Both men had lived in Colombia attempting to secure contracts with local football clubs, but they were unsuccessful.\n\n\n== Popular culture ==\nIn 2024 Netflix released a drama series named Secuestro del vuelo 601, a Colombian production inspired by the events. The series is based on a book by the Italian writer Massimo Di Ricco named Los condenados del aire.\n\n\n== References ==",

Maybach comes up with a new idea: atomize the fuel into a mist to mix with the air in the carburetor.\nEmil Jellinek, a wealthy businessman, quickly becomes Daimler's biggest and \"most difficult customer.\"\nIn the United States, Ransom Olds unveils the first assembly line.\nIn 1901, mechanical engineer Henry Royce is working to design perfect cars in England.\nMaybach is the first to place the engine in the front while putting the driver behind it within the chassis. He is under immense pressure from Jellinek to produce a that is both safe and powerful. To cool the heating engine, Maybach devices a honeycomb grill that becomes the radiator. In December 1901, Daimler and Maybach deliver the radiator for Jellinek's Mercedes.\n\n\n=== Episode 2: Create a Market, Build an Empire ===\nCharles Rolls buys planes from the Wright brothers.

        "content": "The Siege of Paris is an oil on canvas painting by French painter Ernest Meissonier, created in 1884. It represents the Siege of Paris (1870–1871), during the Franco-Prussian War. It is held at the Musée d'Orsay, in Paris.\n\n\n== History and description ==\nAfter the surrender of Napoleon III, at Sedan, on September 2, 1870, the Prussians reached the outskirts of Paris, which was under their siege until January 28, 1871. Several exit attempts to loosen the German grip ended in bitter failures. The Parisians endured the rigors of the siege with courage, until the failure of the battles of January 1871 after which the Government of National Defense decided to negotiate an armistice with the Germans.Meissonnier conceived this work as a memorial to the French who died at the siege of Paris, mixing realism and allegory. He explained: “I wanted to make a sort of heroic symphony of France.\"\nThe painting is built on an opposition between the central figure of the city of Paris, represented by his wife, covered in a lion's skin, with a large French flag, and the specter of famine, emerging from the smoky sky, accompanied by an eagle symbolizing the German Empire, at the left.In the foreground, lying on the palms of the martyr, lie a number of dead or dying soldiers. They are national guards, mobiles, soldiers and sailors who symbolize the suffering of the entire people. Meissonnier, with realism, also paid tribute to certain illustrious deaths for their exemplary value. In the lower right corner, lies Colonel Picot de Dampierre, commander of the Mobiles de l'Aube, who died at the Battle of Bagneux, in October 1870, at the head of his men, who went on a reconnaissance mission, who is identifiable by his red scarf. He also depicts Captain Néverlée, the leader of a battalion of snipers, who was killed in the Battle of Villiers, and is shown crushed under a wounded horse. At the foot of the figure of Paris, its visible the recumbent figure of Colonel Franchetti, mortally wounded during the exit from the Marne, the November 30, 1870. The painter Henri Regnault is seen dying, kneeling against the side of the allegory which protects him by lifting a section of his veil. He was killed at the age of 27 during the second battle of Buzenval, in January 1871. Meissonnier wanted to symbolize through his death the promising youth who was decimated by the war.Meissonnier also pays tribute to the anonymous fighters. The paintings shows able-bodied soldiers who are still fighting, on the left, while they load a cannon and sound the charge. It also depicts the suffering of several civilians: an old man searches for his son among the corpses, a mother presents their deceased child to her husband, and a woman cries over the lifeless body of her husband.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Muddy Basin Ramblers are a jug band formed in 2002 by a group of American and British expats residing in Taipei, Taiwan.  Their music is heavily influenced by 1920s and 1930s blues, jazz, and traditional string bands.  Many of their songs are also inspired by traditional Taiwanese folk music, and their experiences with Taiwanese culture. The Ramblers got their start playing on the street, riverside, and practicing in bars after hours. The band performs predominantly in English, but also performs in Mandarin, and Taiwanese.  All members of the group are multi-instrumentalists, often switching instruments after each song during live performances.  They incorporate many homemade instruments like washboard, washtub bass, and jug.The Ramblers perform predominantly in Taiwan, but have also played in Hong Kong and Japan.Their albums have received recognition in the art world for their unique and creative design. In 2015 and 2020, the albums Formosa Medicine Show and Hold that Tiger were nominated for the Grammy Awards in the Best Recording Package category.In 2016 the band gave a TEDx talk on the importance of \"jamming\" and how the process led to the writing of their albums. In 2023, the band was the featured guest on the \"Taipei Tonight Show\" with Dennis Nieh.\n\n\n== Members ==\nDavid Chen (Resonator Guitar, Guitar, Banjo, Lead Vocals, Banjolin, Lap steel guitar, Ukulele) Tim Hogan (Washboard, Drums, Vocals)TC Lin (Trumpet, Baritone, Tuba, Washtub Bass, Sousaphone, Vocals)Cristina Paradise (Fiddle, Piccolo, Suona, Ukulele, Mandolin, Washtub Bass, Vocals) Zach Paradise (Saxophone, Banjolele, Nose Whistle, Recorder, Whistling, Jaw harp, Guitar, Washtub Bass, Kazoo, Vocals).

        "content": "Brother Jasper of Mary, FSC (July 1, 1829 – April 4, 1895) was an American academic administrator and coach at Manhattan College.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nJasper was born Joseph Brennan on July 1, 1829, in County Kilkenny, Ireland. He moved to St. Louis and attended the Academy of the Christian Brothers. He became a member of the De La Salle Brothers on November 1, 1851, and took the name Brother Jasper of Mary.\n\n\n== Manhattan College ==\nIn 1861, Jasper became prefect of students at Manhattan College. He was also the school's athletic director, resident student adviser, and chief disciplinarian. He founded Manhattan's first band, orchestra, glee club and several literary clubs, and in 1863, started the school's first baseball team. Manhattan College's athletic teams were called the Jaspers in honor of Brother Jasper. In 1926, the school formally adopted the nickname. In 1882, during the seventh inning of a game against the New York Metropolitans, Jasper instructed restless students to stand and stretch until play resumed. Although it is not the only origin story for the seventh-inning stretch, former National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum curator Ted Spencer said that it was the one with the \"most substance [and] is the one best documented\". Jasper died of \"congestion of the lung\" on April 9, 1895, and was buried at Calvary Cemetery in Queens.\n\n\n== References ==",

It has an unknown origin. In the early days it was known as the church of the Nativity of Mary or the church of Santa Maria Assunta: these names suggest that its foundation dates back to before 1000 and that it served as a parish church for lands mentioned in the Privilege of the emperor Henry IV of Franconia of 1064.\nAfter countless vicissitudes, caused by dangers of imminent collapse, followed by improvements and moments of prestige, the church has preserved the lines of the Deomini intervention (1818-1824), extended and enriched with a façade and pronaos. With the breaking down of the side walls, in the 19th century, the altar of the Sacred Heart was created on the left, with the fresco by Emilio Galli; in front, the chapel of the Blessed Virgin, with wooden statues. The vault, frescoed after the Second World War, is full of garlands of festooned flowers, medallions of the Evangelists and symbols of theological virtues. Also of considerable artistic interest are the large baroque statue of Saint Anne, in the niche, the canvas of the Annunciation, of Saint Lucia and a Deposition.The church is privately owned and fenced, therefore not accessible.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Longhope Lifeboat Station is the base for Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) search and rescue operations at Longhope on the island of South Walls, in Orkney, Scotland. It opened in 1874 and since 2004 has operated a Tamar-class lifeboat. In 1969 its lifeboat and crew of eight were lost during  a rescue mission.\n\n\n== History ==\nA lifeboat station was built at Brims on Hoy and the lifeboat was first launched on 25 September 1874. It was always known as 'Longhope' after the larger town on the adjacent island of South Walls. It was replaced in 1906 by a new station with a slipway at Brims. The boathouse was modified in 1990 when new crew facilities were installed in the roof space but  it  was closed in 2003 and a new one opened at Longhope. A pontoon mooring was provided so that the Arun-class could be moored afloat. The old station on Hoy subsequently became the Longhope Lifeboat Museum.\n\n\n== Longhope lifeboat disaster ==\nThe Irene, a Liberian tanker which was adrift with no fuel in the Pentland Firth on the evening of 17 March 1969. The Longhope lifeboat T.G.B. was launched and made its way through high seas and snow flurries towards the disabled vessel. It radioed its position at 9:28 but was never heard from again. The Kirkwall Clyde-class lifeboat was in the area and was sent to look for the Longhope lifeboat. It was later joined by lifeboats from Stronsay, Thurso and Stromness. It was found capsized by the Thurso crew the following afternoon and towed to Scrabster.There had been eight men on board when it launched: Coxswain Daniel Kirkpatrick, his sons Daniel R Kikpatrick and John Kirkpatrick; Mechanic Robert Johnston, his sons James Johnston and Robert Johnston; along with Eric McFadyen and James Swanson. Swanson was never found but the bodies of the other seven were recovered from inside the lifeboat.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nBenjamin Stout, the lifeboat's coxswain, was awarded an RNLI Silver Medal for leading the rescue of 22 people from the ss Victoria which was sinking in the Pentland Firth on 3 March 1891. Half of the rescued people were German so the Emperor of the Germans gave a gold watch to the coxswain and money to the crew.Coxswain John Swanson was awarded a silver medal after rescuing the crew from the trawler Braconmoor which ran aground   on 5 January 1930. He was awarded for another silver service to another trawler, the Dorbie, which was wrecked on 9 January 1932.The lifeboat was launched on 12 April 1951 to aid the tanker Oljaren of Gothenburg which had gone ashore. 40 people were rescued, but it took 23 hours to do so. The Swedish government gave a cash award to the crew and coxswain Alfred Johnston received an RNLI bronze medal. A silver medal was also awarded to Daniel Kirkpatrick for the rescue by breeches buoy of 14 people from a trawler on 4 February 1959. He was given  two more silver awards for rescues on 3 January 1964 and 1 April 1968. This meant that he was the person at that time with three silver medals, however he was drowned while attempting to aid the Irene on 17 March 1969.Another bronze medal was awarded for saving 11 people from the trawler Ross Tern which ran aground on Swona. The coxswain on this occasion was Jack Leslie. The RNLI's chairman sent a framed 'Letter of Thanks' to Leslie and the crew after they attended a chemical tanker which was on fire, along with the Thurso lifeboat, on 19 March 1999.A yacht named Dasher with a crew of three got into difficulty in high wind on 27 August 2004. The lifeboat went to their aid in the difficult conditions, after which coxswain Kevin Kirkpatrick received the 'Thanks of the Institution inscribe don Vellum' and mechanic John Budge was given a framed 'Letter of Thanks' form the chairman. On 11 November 2007 the lifeboat was launched in a Force 12 storm to aid three men who had been injured on a tanker. Doctor Christine Bradshaw was transferred to the tanker by a helicopter winch. She was later awarded an RNLI bronze medal and the lifeboat crew received a framed 'Letter of Thanks'.\n\n\n== Longhope lifeboats ==\n'ON' is the Official Number used in RNLI records from 1884. 'Op. No.' is the Operational Number of the boat displayed on the boat.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of RNLI stations\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nRNLI: Longhope Lifeboat Station",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "The Bombsight, Pilot-Directing, Mark III was an inter-war era bombsight developed by the US Navy to equip its bomber aircraft. It was a development of the British Course Setting Bomb Sight, or CSBS, which had been introduced in UK service in early 1918 and was demonstrated to the Navy in Washington in May 1918. As the primary bombers in Navy service at the time were flying boats where the pilot and bombardier were separated, Mark III's primary change was to include an electrically driven pilot direction indicator.\nThe Mark III was the standard Navy bombsight in the interwar period, from late 1918 until its complete replacement just before the opening of World War II. The Navy was never particularly happy with it, as it lacked the accuracy to hit a ship from higher altitudes and had no way to directly account for moving targets. The Navy continued to look for ways to improve it through this period, but none of the advances were enough to justify the production of a new model.\nOne of these improvements was to ask Carl Norden to stabilize the system to ease sighting, but this proved to be only a minor advance. Norden continued to consider the problem and this led to the development of the Norden bombsight, or Mark XV, which began to replace the Mark III on new aircraft starting in 1935.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Previous designs ===\nEarly bombsights were capable of calculating only the forward distance the bomb would move when dropped from a given altitude. To use these systems, the aircraft would first change its heading until it could see no further sideways drift of objects on the ground, indicating that the aircraft was flying in the same direction as the wind. The bomb aimer would then use a stopwatch to time an object's movement along that line, and use that measurement to calculate the aircraft's ground speed. This speed and their current altitude were then entered into the bombsight, which would move a pointer fore and aft to indicate the correct spot to drop the bombs. The pilot would then attempt to position the aircraft somewhere up or downwind of the target and then approach. They would then drop the bombs when the target passed through the indicator on the bombsight.\nThis method of operation presented a problem for the Navy in World War I, as their primary bomb-equipped aircraft were large flying boats. In these aircraft, the pilot sat well back of the nose and had no direct line of vision to the target, at least during the period of the drop. The observer was located forward, but so far they could not easily communicate with the pilot. This led the Navy to develop a new system under the direction of A. Boettcher and B. Smith that is today known as the pilot direction indicator, or PDI. After setting up the bombsight as normal, a pointer told the pilot to turn right or left to correctly approach the target. Four small lamps under the pointer indicated the distance to the drop point.\nThe device was tested and approved in December 1917, entering service next year as Bombsight, Pilot-Directing, Mark I.\n\n\n=== Vector bombsights ===\nThese early bombsights had many problems. For one, as the aircraft had to fly along the wind line, it allowed anti-aircraft gunners to set up their guns along that line which made their aiming much simpler. But more important to the Navy was the fact that their targets would generally be moving, and not along the wind line, meaning the bomber's approach would normally include residual sideways drift. Although the pilot or navigator could calculate an approach along the wind line, with some difficulty, the target could maneuver and ruin the approach. More generally, as the aircraft flew towards the target, any inaccuracy in the estimate of its speed and heading would have to be accounted for by eye to keep the aircraft approaching it, almost always resulting in some residual drift.\nA solution to this problem was introduced in early 1918 by Harry Wimperis, an expert in air navigation. Flying long distances in the presence of wind was an important part of pilot and navigator training, consisting of basic vector mathematics normally carried out on a navigation chart using basic mechanical instruments like the E6B circular slide rule. Wimperis' device, the Course Setting Bomb Sight, or CSBS, combined a device like the E6B with the bombsight mechanism. By dialling in the heading, altitude, airspeed, windspeed and wind direction, the device indicated a line along which the aircraft had to fly to eliminate drift while also moving the sights along that line to indicate the timing. The bomb aimer would then tell the pilot to turn left or right until the target was moving directly along that line, and dropped at the indicated point. These devices revolutionized air bombing and became known generally as vector bombsights.\n\n\n=== Mark III ===\nAn example of the CSBS Mark I was demonstrated to US Navy officials in May 1918. It lacked the PDI, so it was not immediately useful for service. Boettcher was asked to adapt a PDI to the new sight, and in testing the system produced \"astonishing good results.\" Boettcher was then told to design a version that had the PDI built-in, such that the bombardier's adjustments were automatically repeated in the pilot's sight. A production contract for 3500 Mark III's was sent to International Register Corp in August 1918. The company had completed 2200 by the time the armistice led to the contract being ended. \nThe new design used the CSBS' sight as the observer's side of the indicator. The sights consisted of a ring-and-bead system mounted at the top of the device. In the original CSBS, these were fixed in location, indicating the timing of the drop. In Boettcher's version, the observer rotated the sights side-to-side so they lined up with the target. Below them was a series of electrical contacts that lit up a series of lamps in front of the pilot arranged in a compact horizontal strip, replacing the much larger pointer system of the Mark I. As the pilot turned towards the lit lamp, the observer would rotate their sight to keep it on the target. Eventually, the target would lie directly ahead, the center lamp would light, and the pilot would stop turning.\n\n\n=== Mark III-A ===\nIn more demanding tests after the war, the system proved incapable of hitting a ship from high altitude. An attempt to improve it was made by fitting a low-power telescope in place of the simple ring-and-bead sights of the original CSBS, but this offered little improvement as the image was unstable as the aircraft moved about.\nLooking for a solution, the Bureau of Ordnance asked gyroscope expert Carl Norden if he could come up with a stabilizing system to keep the image steady. Testing of the three prototypes of the Mark III-A took place in July and August 1921 at the Navy's Dahlgren proving grounds. While it did improve things, it was prone to failure and still did not meet the Navy's demanding accuracy requirements.\nIn October 1921 testing against ships, only 11 bombs of 103 dropped from 4,000 feet (1,200 m) altitude hit the targets, the anchored ships USS Indiana and USS Smith. Against the USS Iowa steaming at 6 knots (11 km/h; 6.9 mph) directly along the wind line, they managed only 2 hits from 85 bombs from the same altitude. The Navy concluded that the Estoppey D-1 was the \"best sight available\" as well as simpler and better stabilized. They would purchase a number of D-1s while awaiting better designs.\n\n\n=== Moving targets ===\nAnother problem with the CSBS was that it could not account for moving targets, which was a serious concern to the Navy whose primary target was shipping moving as fast as it could. Norden concluded that the only way to address both of these problems was to use a system designed for stabilization from the outset and use a timing mechanism that would measure both the ground speed and that of the target using a clock. He convinced the Navy to allow him to work on a new design while being paid to deliver a PDI for the Mark III-A. The PDIs were delivered in January 1922, by which time the new design had impressed the Navy and in June he was given a contract for three examples.\nHe delivered the resulting Bombsight, Mark XI for testing in the spring of 1924, but these proved disappointing. The system had several nice features, including a gyrostabilized telescopic sight and automatic sending of angle information to the PDI. However, its solution for measuring time took almost a minute and was not particularly accurate. Testing at Dahlgren demonstrated \"alarming irregularity.\" Nevertheless, the concept seemed promising and work on the system continued until May 1928, when the Navy ordered eighty examples.\n\n\n=== Norden emerges ===\nEven before the IX entered service, the Navy asked Norden to consider the \"synchronous\" concept, also known as \"tachometric\". In this system, the bombardier does not measure the wind speed and direction, as was the case with the vector bombsights. Instead, basic estimates of these were entered, typically provided by the navigator. A mechanical calculator in the bombsight then begins moving the sighting telescope in such a way that, if the estimates were perfect, objects on the ground would appear to be motionless. As the estimates were rarely perfect, the bombardier would instead see the objects drifting in the sight, and would then adjust two controls, left-right and fore-aft, until the motion stopped. The controls now provided highly accurate measurements of the wind speed and direction and did so in as little as 10 seconds. Moreover, any target motion was accounted for in the same measurement, finally solving all of the problems with bombing naval targets.\nThe resulting Bombsight, Mark XV represented an enormous advance, today known simply as the Norden bombsight. The Mark XI never entered full production, and the Mark III was phased out of service as quickly as the new sights could be delivered.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nRife, James; Carlisle, Rodney (2006).

The Diet then elected him on 2 March 1867 to the Imperial Council (then still indirectly elected) for the curia of rural municipalities in Galicia. On 3 June 1867, he took the oath. By a letter dated 31 March 1870, he resigned from his mandate as part of the mass resignation of Slavic deputies as an expression of disagreement with the constitutional direction of the state. He was again delegated by the Diet to the Imperial Council in 1871. He took the oath on 3 March 1871. He was re-elected in 1872. He took the oath on 13 January 1872, but did not exercise his mandate and was therefore declared expired due to absence on 21 April 1873.\nFor his loyalty during the Austro-Prussian War, he was awarded the Order of the Iron Crown on 16 December 1866.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Trot dance is the most popular Mon-Khmer traditional dance usually performed by groups during the Sangkran Khmer New Year festival.\nIt is the pantomime of a deer hunt imitating the beings which are being called upon to be attracted to the human realm, one of the fundamental goals of the sacred dances of Cambodia.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nMost sources accept that the word \"trot\" (ត្រុដិ) is derived from the Sanskrit word translated \"cut off\" or \"cut off\" referring to the end of the year as cutting off the old year into the new year. Its full name this comes from the royal ceremony of the Cambodian New Year known as \"Trot Sangkran\" (ត្រស្តិសង្ក្រាន្ត).\n\n\n== Origin ==\nIt is commonly believed that the trot dance has its origins in the Samre ethnic group, which lived with the Khmers in the ancient land of Suvarnabhumi or \"Land of Gold\" when it was not yet influenced by Indian civilization before the 1st century AD. There are two stories related to this traditional dance, one connecting to its royal origin, the other trying to baptize a pre-Indian dance into the Buddhist religious framework.\n\n\n=== Royal narrative ===\nAccording to the first royal narrative, a poor couple of fishermen named Bun and his wife Neang Oma, lived near Savathy district. They were poor people, always hunting for prey to make a living. One day, the husband prepared his bow and arrows to go out and hunt. The hunter wandered through the forest, crossing the river farther and farther, without encountering any prey, leading the hunter to think that maybe the gods kept them hidden from his view. Therefore, the hunter prayed to all the angels and powers of heaven for help.\nAfter praying, the hunter continued his journey and suddenly encountered a majestic deer in a bright clairie. His hide was like golden threads and his antlers like glittering glass. The hunter was overjoyed, shot the deer down, and used a knife to cut off a piece of skin.\nArriving, seeing that the deer was very good, he brought the buckskin and antlers to the king who would be worthy of this great hunting trophy. King Brahma saw that the peity of the hunter and he was pleased, so he appointed Bun as the provincial governor. From that day on, a dance group told his story.\n\n\n=== Buddhist narrative ===\nThe second story is situated as another Jataka tale. Before Buddha's enlightenment, he went out to perform vows. At that time, some evil spirit pretended to be a deer to block his way so that he could not move forward. The bodhisattva prayed and called on the good spirits. Suddenly, Brahma, Indra, and all the devas came down to snatch the deer, who died. Then all these devas marched across the Anoma River to build a pagoda, fulfilling their wishes with the music of the festival waiting in the streets. This narrative however is nowhere to be found in the Jataka tales, not even in the Paññāsa Jātaka, a collection of 50 non-canonical Jataka tales of Southeast Asia. However; it seems like it is a palimpsest rewriting of the Syama Jataka: the deer is shot as\n\n\n=== A national pride ===\nThe origin of the trot dance was once associated to Laotian mendicants who used it to beg for money. More often, it is associated to the Samre or Pear people, as the primitive people of Cambodia. It can also be a form of scapegoat, as any trot dance that would not be rightly performed would attract bad luck to all the nation. Henri Marchal even considered this dance to be a remance of Indonesian origin. Today, it is considered a Khmer dance. While  French ethnologist Éveline Porée-Maspero noted that since 1936, the procession had been abandoned in some villages of the province of Siem Reap, the effort led by Minister of Culture Chheng Phon contributed to the renewed popularity of the dance after it had been totally eradicated by the Khmer Rouge. It is today an object of national pride as one for all Cambodians.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe trot dance is a traveling dance procession representing the killing of a deer by two masked figures, along with more than a dozen characters including some who are assigned to take charge of the collection of money offerings for the representation.\n\n\n=== Narrative: the deer sacrifice ===\nAccording the French ethnologist Éveline Porée-Maspero, \"the trot (...) is the walking representation of the killing of a deer by two masked characters, after it has been hunted down theatrically. In Siem Reap, troops from the different surrounding villages join the procession hunt. They then go to Angkor Wat, where they mime the drama as an offering to the Buddha, are blessed by the monks, and finish their trek on the banks of the Baray where the local Khmer people come to picnic on the last day of the New Year celebrations. [...] All the dancing troops from Siem Reap go dancing in Angkor Wat and then get blessed in the Southern Pagoda. According to the monk kru Ap of this pagoda, the troops must dance in front of the Buddhas of the central shrine of Angkor Wat, then come to the South pagoda to be sprinkled with holy water [...] If they do not fulfill this obligation, they will not avoid calamities in the new year. Once this little ceremony is done, they can return home without fear.\"\n\n\n=== Actors: 16 artists ===\nFrench ethnologist Éveline Porée-Maspero described the procession in Siem Reap in 1949 as such:The composition of the troupes is, except for a few fantasies, always about the same. A man representing a deer straddles a curved stick, one end of which ends in a massacre of pros (Cervus aristotelis), the other in an imposing grassy tail from which a bell is usually hung. The deer's skull is sometimes covered with painted cardboard, where the eyes are underlined by the red and black seeds of the Abrus precatorius. These seeds also underline the eyes, eyebrows, and lips of the masks of the two dancers charged with killing the deer, which they do with wooden rifles after miming the deer's stalking and being chased by the beast. In addition to these figures, we see one or two dancers whose hands are lengthened by a kind of fake nails made of small braided rattan fingers whose long tips end in a red cotton pompom. The troupe that I saw in 1949 in Wat Athvea, one of these dancers was equipped with two brooms of dry grass which he played very gracefully during his evolutions. A seeker holds a long curved pole at its end, with a cloth purse hanging at the base of the curve. The orchestra consists of four or five kancha players, a player of a flute (oboe) called a pei, a player of skor arak, and two ringing stick bearers. It is sometimes supplemented by a two-stringed violin.The number of artists participating in a trot dance varies depending on people's wishes, but there are generally 16, including four main dancers, two women and two men, a deer representing the forces of evil, a \"Dangdol\" (person carrying a musical instrument), four \"Kanhche\" (person clowning here and there), two giants, two monsters, two drummers, a hunter and a few others.\nIn the procession, one of the trotters is specially charged, while dancing of \"fishing\" with a chhneang (a woven basket used as a sieve to collect small fish hidden in the grasses of streams or ponds), in practise collecting the money thrown by the spectators. While traditionally, the Trot procession dance would go begging from one house to the other, today groups are hired by schools and institutions such as pagodas, ministries or city halls to perform the dance, with the price varying from $50 to $100 or up to $200 depending on the place and guests. The traditional dance is also popular among the community of Cambodians of Chinese descent, who have often booked performances.\n\n\n== Interpretation ==\n\n\n=== A royal dance ===\nIn the past, the trot dance was performed every New Year in front of kings and royal families to wish them a happy new year. The royal language used in the lyrics of the Siem Reap trot dance is also evidence as to its origin. From the royal court of Angkor, where it is still observed with more pomp and circumstance, the trot dance was folklorized as it became a popular rite of the Khmer New Year across the country.\n\n\n=== Chasing the bad luck of the past year, wishing good for the new ===\nPerforming the trot dance is commonly understood as a way to get rid of the bad and increase good fortune for the upcoming New Year, according to traditional beliefs. It can therefore before co,pqred to the Chinese Dragon Dance which is also presumed to ward off the bad spirits of the past year. According to Henri Marchal, the royal dance was already some form of apotropaic rite to get any bad luck far away from the king.\n\n\n=== A propitiatory rite ===\nThe dance and the deer sacrifice may also represent a propitiatory rite imploring for the rain to fall again at the end of the dry season. According to a 1949 report by Reverend Iv Tuot for the Commission des Moeurs et Coutumes du Cambodge, the trot dance was already acknowledged as a ceremony imploring rain. Along with the rain, the dance and the suggestive dances od actors in couple is also a plea for fertility as the end of the season before the first rains in usually also the time of rut.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": "2011-03-16 13:35:56",
        "content": "Impavido (English: \"Fearless\") was an Italian Indomito-class destroyer. Commissioned into service in the Italian Regia Marina (Royal Navy) in 1913, she served in World War I, playing an active role in the Adriatic campaign and seeing action in the Battle of the Strait of Otranto. Reclassified as a torpedo boat in 1929, she was stricken in 1937.\n\n\n== Construction and commissioning ==\nImpavido was laid down at the Cantiere Pattison (English: Pattison Shipyard) in Naples, Italy, in 1911. She was launched on 22 March 1913 and commissioned in 1913.\n\n\n== Service history ==\n\n\n=== World War I ===\n\n\n==== 1915 ====\nWorld War I broke out in 1914, and the Kingdom of Italy entered the war on the side of the Allies with its declaration of war on Austria-Hungary on 23 May 1915. At the time, Impavido and the destroyers Impetuoso, Indomito, Insidioso, Intrepido, and Irrequieto made up the 2nd Destroyer Squadron. The squadron, under the command of Capitano de fregata (Frigate Captain) P. Orsini, was based at Taranto, although either Impetuoso or Indomito or both were visiting La Spezia that day. On 3 July 1915 the squadron was assigned to the 3rd Group of the 4th Naval Division and Orsini, promoted to capitano di vascello (ship-of-the-line captain), took on duty as commander of the 3rd Group in addition to the 2nd Destroyer Squadron.\nAt 01:00 on 6 July 1915 Impavido and the rest of her squadron got underway from Venice and carried out an offensive reconnaissance sweep toward the east. The ships then headed back toward Venice. At 04:30 they were about 30 nautical miles (56 km; 35 mi) east of Chioggia, where they were to rendezvous with the armored cruiser Amalfi and another destroyer squadron led by the destroyer Bersagliere. Plans called for the combined force to sweep the Gulf of Venice in a search for Austro-Hungarian ships. While heading toward the rendezvous, however, Amalfi was torpedoed by the Austro-Hungarian Navy submarine U-26 and sank in ten minutes.\nA few hours after an Austro-Hungarian Navy force subjected the Palagruža (known to the Italians as the Pelagosa) archipelago in the Adriatic Sea to a heavy bombardment during the night of 16–17 August 1915, Impavido, Intrepido, the protected cruiser Quarto, and the destroyers Animoso and Ardito, which were on a cruise in the Adriatic Sea north of the line Brindisi–Cattaro, interrupted their operations to respond. They reached Palagruža at around 10:00 on 17 August 1915.\n\n\n==== 1916 ====\nAt 19:00 on 8 June 1916 Impavido, under the command of an officer named Ruggiero, departed Vlorë (known to the Italians as Valona) in the Principality of Albania with Insidioso, the protected cruiser Libia, and the destroyers Espero and Pontiere to escort the armed merchant cruiser Principe Umberto and the troopship Romagna, which had embarked the 2,605 men of the Italian Royal Army′s (Regio Esercito′s) 55th Infantry Regiment for transportation to Italy. The convoy had traveled only a short distance when the Austro-Hungarian submarine U-5 hit Principe Umberto in the stern with two torpedoes. Principe Umberto sank in a few minutes about 15 nautical miles (28 km; 17 mi) southwest of the Karaburun Peninsula (also known as Cape Linguetta) with the loss of 1,926 of the 2,821 men on board, the worst naval disaster of World War I in terms of lives lost. The escorting warships rescued the survivors but could not locate and counterattack U-5.\nOn 25 June 1916 Impavido, Insidioso, Irrequieto, the protected cruiser Marsala, and the destroyer Audace operated in distant support of an attack by the motor torpedo boats MAS 5 and MAS 7 against Durrës (known to the Italians as Durazzo) on the coast of Albania. The attack resulted in serious damage to the 1,111-gross register ton steamship Sarajevo.\nOn 24 December 1916 Impavido, the scout cruiser Carlo Mirabello, and the destroyer Ippolito Nievo supported an operation by the motor torpedo boats MAS 3 and MAS 6, which, towed respectively by the coastal torpedo boats 36 PN and 54 AS, were supposed to attack Austro-Hungarian ships in port at Durrës. The Italians aborted the attack when MAS 6 suffered damage in a collision with wreckage 3 nautical miles (5.6 km; 3.5 mi) from Durrës.\n\n\n==== 1917–1918 ====\nOn the night of 14–15 May 1917, the Battle of the Strait of Otranto began when the Austro-Hungarian Navy staged a two-pronged attack against the Otranto Barrage in the Strait of Otranto aimed both at destroying naval drifters — armed fishing boats that patrolled the anti-submarine barrier the barrage formed — and, as a diversionary action, at destroying an Italian convoy bound from Italy to Albania. At 04:10 on 15 May, after receiving news of the attack, Impavido, Indomito, Insidioso, Marsala, the scout cruisers Aquila and Carlo Alberto Racchia, and the British Royal Navy light cruiser HMS Liverpool made ready for sea at Brindisi. At 05:30 the formation left Brindisi together with the British light cruiser HMS Dartmouth and two other destroyers, and at 07:45 the Allied force sighted the Austro-Hungarian destroyers Balaton and Csepel. Aquila and the Italian destroyers steered to attack the two Austro-Hungarian ships at 08:10 and opened fire on them at 08:15. In the ensuing exchange of gunfire, Balaton suffered damage and Aquila was hit and immobilized immediately afterwards. The two Austro-Hungarian destroyers ultimately took shelter under the cover of Austro-Hungarian coastal artillery batteries, forcing the Italian ships to give up the pursuit. Following a clash in which other Italian and Austro-Hungarian ships also participated, the battle ended with some ships damaged on both sides, but none sunk.\nOn 16 July 1917 Impavido, Indomito, Insidioso, Carlo Alberto Racchia, and the scout cruiser Augusto Riboty operated in distant support of an Italian air attack against Durrës carried out by 18 aircraft flying from Brindisi and Vlorë and supported by the torpedo boats Ardea and Pegaso.\nBy late October 1918, Austria-Hungary had effectively disintegrated, and the Armistice of Villa Giusti, signed on 3 November 1918, went into effect on 4 November 1918 and brought hostilities between Austria-Hungary and the Allies to an end. World War I ended a week later with the armistice between the Allies and the German Empire on 11 November 1918.\n\n\n=== Post-World War I ===\nAfter the end of World War I, Impavido′s armament was revised, giving her five 102 mm (4 in)/35-caliber guns, a single 40 mm (1.6 in)/35-caliber gun, and four 450-millimetre (17.7 in) torpedo tubes.\nImpavido was reclassified as a torpedo boat in 1929. She was struck from the naval register on 1 September 1937 and subsequently scrapped.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nFavre, Franco.

        "content": "Mezek Fortress (Bulgarian: Мезешка крепост) is a medieval stronghold constructed in the 11th and 12th centuries west of the modern village of Mezek, southeastern Bulgaria. It has been identified as the medieval Neoutzikon (Неузетикон in Bulgarian, Νεούτζικον in Byzantine Greek), mentioned in Byzantine chronicles. The structure is perched on an elongated terrace at the foothills of the most northeastern ridge of the Rhodope Mountains known as Gorata or St Marina. It functioned as a border guard fortress defending the lands between the rivers Maritsa and Arda. The fortress was controlled by the Byzantine and the Bulgarian Empires until it was conquered by the Ottoman Turks in the second half of the 14th century. \nMezek Fortress is among the 100 Tourist Sites of Bulgaria of the Bulgarian Tourist Union and is considered the best preserved fort in the eastern Rhodope Mountains. Some 600 m east of the structure is located the Mezek Tomb, the largest Thracian beehive tomb in Bulgaria.\n\n\n== Location and status ==\n\nMezek Fortress is situated at an altitude of 210 m next to the homonymous village in Svilengrad Municipality of Haskovo Province, southeastern Bulgaria. It lies some 6 km southwest of the municipal center Svilengrad and one kilometer north of the Bulgaria–Greece border. It is easily accessible via the Maritsa motorway, the first class I-8 road and the second class II-80 road and can be reached via a road in the western part of Mezek leading to the nearby summit of Sheynovets, where the first action in the 1912 First Balkan War was fought.\nIt is part of the Kaleto Natural Landmark declared in 1976 to protect the rock formations and the fortress. \nThe fortress was declared national antiquity in 1927 and an architectural monument in 1968. Restoration and conservation activities were carried out in 1973 and 2007. There is a tourist information center, offering information and brochures.\n\n\n== Description ==\nMezek Fortress encloses an area of 7 decares in the shape of an irregular quadrangle measuring 110/60 m. The walls are constructed of rubble stone joined with white mortar and decorated with three brick belts on the outside. Walls were crowned with battlements, which were preserved until 1900. The northern fortress walls are the most damaged, preserved to the ground level from the interior of the fortress. The south, west, and east sides are well-conserved to the height of the platform above which the battlements rose. The fortress walls are 1.90 to 2.50 m thick. The entrance is on the western wall, at its northern end. It is formed in a deep recess in the wall and is protected by a tower.\nThere are nine round towers, which protrude more than half of their diameter beyond the walls and reach a height of over 10 m. Five of the towers are located on the most vulnerable south wall, of them two in the corners and three on the front. Two of the towers are on the west wall, in the middle and at the main entrance. The north and east walls have one tower each. The tower, located at the southwest corner of the fortress, is the best preserved and the largest. It had three floors, the upper two with battlements. The floors were open to the interior of the fortress so that they had a circular fire range and could be defended even when the enemy penetrated the fortification.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nNeoutzikon was mentioned by Byzantine chronicler Niketas Choniates as the place where the Byzantine emperor Isaac II Angelos quelled the rebellion of his cousin Constantine Angelos Doukas in 1193. Doukas had been appointed governor of Philipoppolis and fought with success against the Bulgarian Uprising of Asen and Peter, which led to the re-establishment of the Bulgarian Empire. In 1193 Doukas declared himself emperor and marched on Constantinople but before reaching Adrianople he was betrayed at captured by his own men at Neoutzikon, that was situated on the border between the dioceses of Philippopolis and Adrianople. According to Choniates, this deed greatly encouraged the Bulgarian rebels, who had feared Constantine's ability and much preferred the ineffective Isaac II to remain on the throne, if possible, forever.\nThe battlements of the fortress were intact until 1900, when part of the structure was demolished by the Ottomans in order to reuse the stones for the construction of barracks in Svilengrad.\n\n\n== Research and conservation ==\nIn the 19th century, historian Konstantin Jireček identified the ruins near the village of Mezek with the Fortress of Neoutzikon. The first archaeological research of the fortress was carried out in the 1930s by architect Aleksandar Rashenov, who performed excavations, documentation of the fortification system and small-scale studies of the interior. Rashenov documented the architectural monument with a detailed description, drawing and photos.\nConservation and restoration works on the walls were completed in 1963 and 1973. In 1983, more extensive archaeological excavations were carried out that clarified the fortress plan, the defense system and the dating. No medieval materials earlier than the 11th century were discovered. There were numerous ceramics pieces from the 13th and 14th centuries. Based on the data, the construction of the fortress was dated to the end of the 11th and the beginning of the 12th century, probably during the reign of Byzantine emperor Alexios I Komnenos. The stronghold was in operation until the fall of the area under Ottoman rule. Many ceramic vessels fragments, stone millstones and other household items were found. Two granaries with charred wheat were also discovered.\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== References ==\nГеоргиев (Georgiev), Владимир (Vladimir) (1984). Енциклопедия България. Том IV.

        "content": "Vibrio cincinnatiensis is a species of gram-negative bacteria. It was named after Cincinnati, Ohio, where it was first isolated and characterized. It is rarely isolated from human specimens. In 2019, V. cincinnatiensis accounted for only 0.07% of all confirmed cases of vibriosis in the United States.\n\n\n== Description ==\nVibrio cincinnatiensis is a halophilic, facultatively anaerobic gram-negative rod, 0.7 by 2.0 μm in diameter. This organism is oxidase positive and motile by a single polar flagellum. V. cincinnatiensis produces yellow colonies on TCBS agar, indicating sucrose fermentation.\nSimilar to other members of the Vibrionaceae family, V. cincinnatiensis is most commonly isolated from marine and aquatic environments. This bacterium was isolated from several bodies of water including Chesapeake Bay, Adriatic Sea, and Ohta River. In all these studies, V. cincinnatiensis represented only a small fraction of the total resident Vibrio populations.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\nVibrio cincinnatiensis is listed as a pathogenic member of Vibrionaceae. However, due to the low number of reported cases and the broad diversity of disease presentation, this bacterium's status as a human enteric or wound pathogen is unclear.\nV. cincinnatiensis was first isolated from the blood and cerebrospinal fluid of a 70-year-old male at the University of Cincinnati Hospital in 1986. The patient had no known contact with seafood or seawater. Therapy was begun with ampicillin followed by moxalactam. The patient's uneventful recovery represented the first successful treatment of Vibrio sp. meningitis in an adult. This bacterium was also isolated from the stool of a patient experiencing gastroenteritis.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "NGC 3110, known as NGC 3122 and NGC 3518 is an active spiral galaxy in the Constellation Sextans. It contains extensive Hubble-type Sb star-forming regions, and is located south of the celestial equator. It is estimated to be 218 million light-years from the Milky Way and has a diameter of around 100,000 ly. Together with PGC 29184 it forms a gravitationally bound galaxy pair. Located in the same area of the sky is the galaxy IC 589.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\nMultiple astronomers have documented NGC 3110 as different objects in the NGC catalogue. The object was first discovered by William Herschel on March 5, 1785, but this observation appears in the NGC catalogue under the designation NGC 3122. This galaxy was also observed by the French astronomer Édouard Stephan on February 17, 1884, and it is this observation which was entered in the NGC catalogue under the designation NGC 3110. Finally, the American astronomer Ormond Stone also observed this galaxy on December 31, 1885, and this observation was entered in the NGC catalogue under the designation NGC 3518.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nNGC 3110 has a broad HI line and is a bright infrared galaxy (LIRG). It also contains regions of ionized hydrogen. To date, three non-redshift measurements give a distance of 54.300 ± 1.375 Mpc (∼177 million ly), which is outside the Hubble distance values.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of NGC objects (3001–4000)\nGalaxy formation and evolution\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNGC 3110 at SEDS.org\nNGC 3110 at SIMBAD",

        "content": "Jan Klán (January 22, 1911 – October 12, 1986) was a Czech fighter ace of World War II who achieved five aerial victories during the Battle of France. He later served as commander of No. 312 Squadron of the United Kingdom's Royal Air Force during the Battle of Britain, and as deputy commander of the 1st Czechoslovak Fighter Air Regiment during the Slovak National Uprising. \nThe son-in-law of the romance novelist Vlasta Javořická, Klán moved to the United States during the Cold War and anglicized his name to John Kent. He died in Tucson, Arizona.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nJan Klán was born in Německý Brod and graduated from the military academy in Hranice. He entered service with the aviation corps of the Czechoslovak Army before transferring to the newly formed air wing of the Czechoslovak Gendarmerie.Klán was engaged to Václava — daughter of the popular Czech romance novelist Vlasta Javořická — in 1939, shortly before the dissolution of the First Czechoslovak Republic and the establishment of the German-administered Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia.\n\n\n== World War II ==\nKlán left the Czech lands for Poland in May 1939 and, from there, to France where he briefly served in the French Foreign Legion before joining the Armée de l'air. Flying with the Groupe de Chasse II/5 La Fayette based at Toul-Croix de Metz Airfield, on 23 April 1940, Klán became the first Czech pilot to register an aerial victory against the Luftwaffe in the Hawk 75 and the first to down a Messerschmitt Bf 109. He became a fighter ace after achieving an additional four aerial victories during the Battle of France, for which he would be invested into the Legion of Honour at the rank of chevalier and decorated with the Croix de Geurre.\nAfter the Fall of France, Klán made his way to the United Kingdom via French Algeria and volunteered with Czech and Slovak expatriates serving the Royal Air Force, briefly commanding No. 312 (Czechoslovak) Squadron RAF. He later moved to the USSR where he was made deputy commander of the Soviet-backed 1st Czechoslovak Fighter Air Regiment, which provided combat aviation support to insurgent forces during the Slovak National Uprising.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nFollowing the conclusion of hostilities, Klán returned to the reconstituted Czechoslovakia. He married on August 11, 1945. In 1948, he was made lieutenant colonel and assigned as military attaché to the Czechoslovak embassy in the Soviet Union. He later returned to Czechoslovakia to take command of the Czechoslovak Army Air Command's České Budějovice Military Airfield.Due to changing political conditions following the 1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état, Klán was dismissed from the armed forces in February 1949.The following year, Klán and his family left Czechoslovakia, eventually settling in the United States where he anglicized his name to John Kent. As John Kent, Klán worked for a \"government services\" firm and, then, for Piper Aircraft as a \"sales manager\" variously posted to the company's offices in Brazil, Argentina, and Switzerland. He retired to Tucson, Arizona, where he died.In 1991, Klán was posthumously promoted to colonel by Czechoslovakia.  An effort in the later 1990s by Czech aviation enthusiasts to have Klán posthumously invested into the Order of the White Lion was rejected by authorities of the Czech Republic.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of World War II aces from Czechoslovakia\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Freya Alexandra Sargent (born 21 January 2006) is an Irish cricketer who plays for Ireland Women and Typhoons.\nShe is an off-spinner and right-handed batter who primarily plays as a bowler for the national team.\nIn 2023 she was part of the Ireland U-19 Women's side that took part in the 2023 Under-19 Women's T20 World Cup where she picked up 4 wickets.\nSargent plays her club cricket for Clontarf.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nSargent received her first senior call up when she was named in the Typhoons squad for the 2020 season. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic the Irish women's domestic Super Series was limited to eight List A games only, with no T20 fixtures taking place.\nShe made her List A debut on 3 August 2020 for Typhoons against Scorchers at Oak Hill aged just 14.\nSargent would make her T20 debut at the same ground just over a year later on 8 August 2021, again against Scorchers.\nShe would appear sporadically for Typhoons in 2022 before receiving a call-up for the 2023 Under-19 Women's T20 World Cup late that year. In Ireland's opening game of the tournament against West Indies she would return figures of 2/9 and hit 15*(11) to take Ireland just seven runs short of what would have been a famous victory.\nAfter beating Indonesia, Ireland would qualify for the Super Sixes stage but not win any further games in the competition.\n2023 would prove to be a breakthrough year for Sargent. In March she was announced as a recipient of a casual contract from Cricket Ireland and two months later she won Player of the Match for her 4/15 in a victory against Scorchers in a Super 20 Trophy match at Anglesea Road.\nA first call up to the Ireland senior team would come in August for a three match T20I series against the Netherlands. Head Coach Ed Joyce noted that \"Freya Sargent has impressed at youth international and Super Series level and has earned a call-up...she also performed well at the Under-19s World Cup at the start of the year, so I have no doubt she’ll be well positioned for a step up in standard.”\nShe made her WT20I debut in the first match of the series on 14 August, going wicketless from her four overs. A maiden international wicket would come two days later in the second game as she bowled Babette de Leede.\nSargent's WODI debut came against Scotland in October at Desert Springs in Spain. She picked up two wickets, followed by another two scalps in the second match. However injury would force her to sit out the third ODI and the subsequent T20I series.\nHer return came during Ireland's tour of Zimbabwe in January 2024 where she took her ODI best figures of 3/29 in a 10 wicket win over Zimbabwe in the first ODI.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nESPNCricinfo Profile\nCricket Ireland Profile",

        "content": "Dream Star Fighting Marigold (stylized as Dream Star★Fighting Marigold), referred to simply as Marigold (マリーゴールド, Marīgōrudo) in shorthand, is a Japanese joshi puroresu or women's professional wrestling promotion founded in April 2024. Marigold was founded by former All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling co-producer and World Wonder Ring Stardom (Stardom) promoter Rossy Ogawa after Ogawa was fired from Stardom. In February 2024, Ogawa was dismissed from Stardom after being accused by the promotion's management of \"poaching talent\", a claim which he denied.\nUpon the announcement of the creation of the promotion, several active members of the Stardom and Actwres girl'Z (AWG) rosters defected to Marigold. Amongst them were Stardom roster members Giulia, Utami Hayashishita, Mirai, Nanae Takahashi, Mai Sakurai, Victoria Yuzuki and Nao Ishikawa as well as AWG roster members Natsumi Sumikawa, Miku Aono, Misa Matsui, Chiaki, Chika Goto, and Kouki.  \nMarigold has stated their intent is to run their first event (titled \"Marigold Fields Forever\") on 20 May 2024 at Korakuen Hall in Tokyo. The show, and subsequent shows, were announced as streaming on Wrestle Universe.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website",

The house was a one-story frame structure with a gable roof flanked by chimneys.  The façade was three bays wide, and the house had a rear ell and enclosed rear porch.\nThe house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Maythorne is a hamlet in Nottinghamshire, England. It is located 1 mile (1.6 km) north-west of Southwell, and is within the Southwell civil parish. The hamlet lies on the Southwell Trail, a multi-use trail linking Southwell with Bilsthorpe along the route of the former Rolleston Junction to Mansfield railway line, and the Robin Hood Way, a waymarked long-distance footpath that links many places with connections to Robin Hood.The hamlet grew up around a pair of mills on the River Greet, and has a total of seven listed buildings or structures, including both mills, the manager's house, and worker's cottages. The mills were built in 1795 to supply cotton yarn to the framework knitting industry. The firm of Messrs. Bean and Johnson altered it in the early nineteenth century, after which silk thread was produced.By 1838 there were 70 employees at the mills, and the hamlet included cottages, a general store, a public house and a mission hall. Willow for making baskets was grown in osier beds, and hops were also cultivated. The mills were used as billets for soldiers during the Second World War, by which time their industrial function had ceased.The mill buildings have subsequently been converted into flats, with some of the outbuildings used as industrial workshops. There is also a caravan park and fishing lake, together with an award-winning gluten-free tea room.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Eye in the Museum is a 1929 detective novel by the British author Alfred Walter Stewart, published under his pseudonym J.J. Connington. It was the first of two books featuring Superintendent Ross, a brief attempt by the author to replace his best-known character Chief Constable Sir Clinton Driffield. Ross is similar in type to the contemporary Inspector French created by Freeman Wills Crofts. The title is a play on words referring both to a glass eye that is a prominent part of the museum's collection and a camera obscura on the top of the building which provides a vital evidence allowing Ross to solve the case.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe novel takes place in a small, English town with a river and a museum containing a relatively dull collection of objections. After Mrs. Fenton is found dead the initial assumption that is was of natural causes soon gives way to evidence that she was murdered. An unpleasant woman who drunk and gambled heavily, she had a number of enemies. Suspicion falls on her niece who she tyrannises and whose inheritance she controls for her own benefit until her twenty fifth birthday. Ross methodically works through the other list of those who had either the motive or the means of killing her, including her former husband and the doctor with whom she has been having an affair. Only after a second murder does the case become fully clear.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nEvans, Curtis.

        "content": "In 1822, after Maharaja Ranjit Singh gave employment to the European mercenaries, the Fauj-i-Ain divided unequally into the Kampu-i-mu'alla (State Troops) and the Fauj-i-Khas. Of the two, the Kampu-i-mu'alla was the larger trained division of the Sikh Khalsa Army comprising infantry, cavalry and artillery,: 78  but principally the infantry and artillery: 5 .  The men enrolled in the Kampu-i-mu'alla wore uniforms: Order 325  and received a salary from the royal treasury: 5 .\nThe Kampu-i-mu'alla had a mistrikhana (workshop), toshakhanna (treasury), a magazine (ammunition storage), a bazaar (shops), a daftar (record-keeping) and abkari (liquor tax) units: Order 325 . \n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Sukerchakia forces inherited by Ranjit Singh from his father and grandfather comprised predominantly irregular cavalry: 373 , well-suited to meet the contingencies presented in the north west frontier of the Indian subcontinent in the eighteenth century.\nIn the early years, Ranjit Singh often led his forces. The meteoric rise of the Company impressed upon the Sikh leader the importance of learning the enemy's art of warfare, and Ranjit Singh commenced training a section of his army in the art of European (British) warfare in the first decade of the nineteenth century. While the Fauj-i-Khas was trained in the Napoleonic art of war, these methods were introduced into the Kampu-i-mu'alla in 1836: 71 .\nBoth the Kampu-i-mu'alla and the Fauj-i-Khas were stationed in Lahore, the capital city of the Sikh Empire, and marched as and when ordered by the Maharaja. Till 1836, the Kampu-i-mu'alla was led only by a Hindu or a Sikh general, while the smaller division of the Fauj-i-Ain, the Fauj-i-Khas, was commanded by Europeans.\n\n\n== Formation ==\nInitially, Ranjit Singh's standing army comprised principally irregular cavalry with a small section of trained cavalry and infantry. The formal divisions in the Sikh Khalsa Army emerged after 1823, the year the Sikh army faced the challenge of the Durrani Empire in the Battle of Nowshera fought in the trans-Indus region. Ranjit Singh's first-hand experience along this frontier made it clear that a single force would not be able to meet the threat posed along the two frontiers of his empire. The Maharaja displayed the Kampu-i-mu'alla and the Fauj-i-Khas before visiting foreign dignitaries. He impressed the governor-general of the East India Company with the training imparted to this section of his armed force: III Part V 340 .\n\n\n== Size ==\nThe earliest trained cavalry in the Sikh Khalsa Army were deserters from the Company's army. By 1808, a section of mounted troops in the Sikh Khalsa Army went through a cavalry drill. Between 1819 and 1838, the strength of the trained cavalry in the Kampu-i-mu'alla saw a five-fold rise, from 837 to 4,090.The first mention of infantry in the Sikh Khalsa Army is in 1803. In three decades beginning 1811, the enrolment of foot soldiers saw a ten-fold rise, while the strength of the artillery increased fourfold.

        "content": "The Inner History of the Kelly Gang is a 1929 Australian biography of Ned Kelly and his gang by J. J. Kenneally. For a time it was considered the most authorotative version of Kelly's life.The book took a very sympathetic point of view towards Kelly and was highly critical of the police.Kenneally claimed the book was plagiarised by newspapers leading to court action.Kenneally later formed the Ned Kelly Defence League. He often complained about inaccuracies in depictions of the life of Kelly such as When the Kellys Rode and the verse play Ned Kelly.The book was republished in 1945.The book inspired Sidney Nolan's famous series of paintings of Kelly.ABC Weekly said the book \"deserves to be an Australian classic.\"The Bulletin said \" the book is intensely biased  in tone. The Kellys are driven to horse  stealing, cattle duffing, murder and robbery in just protest against intolerable persecution by the police. The latter are all  \nknaves or fools, and most of them cowards  into the bargain...An adventure into sheer sensationalism, the book seems to have no particular  reason for existence, though the author’s constant reference to the terror inspired in the outlaws by the black trackers brought from Queensland is of interest.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

He is best known for his work during World War II, when he was head of the German-controlled French film company Continental Films.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nIn the 1930s, Greven was a producer at UFA where he worked with some French directors on multi-language film productions.\nGreven is best known for his role during the German military administration in occupied France during World War II, when he was the managing director of Continental Films, the French film production company set up by Germany. In this capacity, Greven produced notable films by French directors including Henri-Georges Clouzot, Christian-Jaque, Henri Decoin, Maurice Tourneur and André Cayatte. Greven also created the distribution company Société de gestion et d'exploitation du cinéma, which bought and set up new cinemas in France.\nJoseph Goebbels was dissatisfied with the high quality of Greven's work in France, because he thought Greven raised the level of French cinema and inspired national pride, which was not supposed to be his task. Goebbels wrote in his diary that the French had been content with \"cheap trash\", and he wished Greven would continue to provide them with that. Goebbels thought Greven's commitment to French cinema threatened the establishment of Germany as the dominant power in European culture, which he wanted to be analogous to how the United States dominated the American continents through its cinema.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAlfred Greven at IMDb",

        "content": "Miss Grand Navarra is a Spanish provincial female beauty pageant founded in 2020, aiming to select representatives from the community of Navarra for the Miss Grand Spain national competition.Since first participating in the Miss Grand Spain pageant, Navarra's representatives have not won the main title yet. The highest placement they obtained was the top 13 finalists, won by Dori Rodríguez in 2021.\n\n\n== History ==\nFrom 2018 to 2019, after the president of the Miss Grand Spain pageant, Vicente Gonzalez, began franchising the provincial competitions to individual organizers in 2016, the community of Navarra joined the competition with the representation of the appointed candidates. Later in 2020, the license for Miss Grand Navarra was granted to a local organizer who later held the first contest of the Miss Grand Navarra pageant consisting of candidates from 13 municipalities on October 18, 2020, in which a 21-year-old transgender representing Orcoyen, Dori Rodríguez, was named the winner, making her the first transgender to win a female beauty pageant in Navarra.The organizer also held another edition of the pageant in the following years. However, the contract between them and the national organ was discontinued in 2024 resulting in no Navarra representative in the Miss Grand Spain 2024 pageant.\n\n\n== Editions ==\nThe following table details Miss Grand Navarra's annual editions since 2020.\n\n\n== National competition ==\nThe following is a list of Navarra representatives who competed at the Miss Grand Spain national pageant.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Miss Grand Spain at Wikimedia Commons\nMiss Grand Spain official website",

The floods were caused by torrential rains and king tides.\n\n\n== Damages and Casualties ==\nThe floods and landslides killed 23, including a mother and her child. The fatalities occurred during three separate landslides in Chimbu Province. Roads were washed away in coastal regions. The village of Lese Kavora was severely affected by king tides, damaging food gardens and contaminating water wells. Rivers overflowed around deltas. Enga Province also suffered heavy floods. Tons of mud buried homes in the same province. The entire country experienced rain and stormy weather.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe floods ravaged the local economy, and many survived on only one meal per day. The government allocated 10,000 Papua New Guinean kinas ($2,645) for relief assistance. The country is one of the most at-risk to climate change, ranking 16 according to the 2022 World Risk Index.\n\n\n== See also ==\n2008 Papua New Guinea floods\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Cameron Crotty is a Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman currently playing for the Tucson Roadrunners in the American Hockey League (AHL) as a prospect for the Utah NHL team of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was drafted by the Arizona Coyotes 82nd overall in the 2017 NHL Entry Draft.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\nCrotty played with the Brockville Braves of the Central Canada Hockey League (CCHL) between 2015 and 2017. He won the CCHL Top Prospect Award following the 2016–17 CCHL season. He then joined the Boston University Terriers in the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Hockey East. At the end of his first season with the Terriers, Crotty was named to Hockey East's All-Academic Team. He won the Hockey East Conference Championship with the Terries that season. In his final season with Boston University, Crotty was named one of the team's alternate captains.\nCrotty was selected by the Arizona Coyotes of the National Hockey League (NHL) in the third round, 82nd overall, in the 2017 NHL Entry Draft. He signed a three-year entry level contract with the Coyotes on April 9, 2020. However, due to the pandemic, a gap opened up from the end of his college career and the beginning of his professional one. In an effort to get game time, Crotty joined Sparta Sarpsborg of Norway's Eliteserien, playing his first game on November 12, 2020. He returned to North America for the beginning of training camp. Crotty was assigned to the Coyotes American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Tucson Roadrunners to begin his professional career. He returned to the AHL for the 2021–22 season. During the 2022–23 season, Crotty played in 64 games with the Roadrunners, registering 13 points. A restricted free agent at the end of his deal with Arizona, he was not given a qualifying offer and became an unrestricted free agent. However, he re-signed with Arizona on June 30, 2023, to a one-year, two-way contract.\nHe began the 2023–24 season with Tucson but was recalled by Arizona on an emergency basis due to Josh Brown suffering an illness in March 2024. He made his NHL debut for the Coyotes on March 24 in a 5–2 loss to the Dallas Stars.\n\n\n== Career statistics ==\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBiographical information and career statistics from NHL.com, or Eliteprospects.com, or ESPN.com, or Hockey-Reference.com, or The Internet Hockey Database",

        "content": "Missile Strikes on Odesa were carried out during the day on March 15, 2024, with a half-hour interval by the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation targeting the city's recreational area. This attack became the most devastating in terms of casualties and injuries to civilian infrastructure of the city since the beginning of the Russian-Ukrainian War. A total of 21 people were killed, and 74 others suffered injuries of varying severity.\nRescue teams from the State Emergency Service arrived at the scene to extinguish fires, clear debris, and search for victims. Later, the Russian Armed Forces launched another missile strike, causing further damage and casualties.\n\n\n== Course of events ==\nOn March 15, 2024, at 11:01 (UTC+2), an air raid siren was heard in the region. Around 11:03, the first missile hit a recreational facility on Dacha Kovalevskogo Street in the Kyiv District. At 11:37, just as medics, rescuers, and police arrived at the site, a second missile hit the same location. A three-story building of the recreational facility was destroyed, and at least 10 residential houses, a vehicle service station, a low-pressure gas pipeline, ambulances, and fire and rescue vehicles were damaged.\n\n\n== Victims ==\nOn the first day of the tragedy, 20 fatalities were discovered. Among those killed by the Russians were the former First Deputy Mayor of Odesa, Sergiy Tetyukhin, and 30-year-old police officer Andriy Boyarsky, leaving behind a three-month-old orphan. The next morning, 39-year-old rescuer Vitaliy Alimov died in the hospital, becoming the 21st victim.\n\n\n== Investigation ==\nThe Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine reported that the Russians launched the missile from the territory of Crimea using the Iskander-M system. Ukrainian investigators initiated an investigation under the article concerning the violation of the laws and customs of war related to deliberate murder (Part 2 of Article 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine).\n\n\n== Reaction ==\nPresident of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, commented on the strike. \"Rescue operations and assistance are still underway in Odesa after the Russian missile strike — a very cowardly strike by these scoundrels: two missiles, and the second, when rescuers and doctors arrived at the impact site. Among the dead and injured are 'emergency' paramedics and State Emergency Service rescuers,\" the president noted.\nThe Odesa Oblast Military Administration declared March 16 as a Day of Mourning.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBombings of Odesa (since 2022)\n\n\n== References ==",

On 23 December 1880 sheriff Pat Garrett and his posse found Billy the Kid and the Regulators in a stone hut, where it began a shoot-out which killed Charlie Bowdre and captured Billy, Dave Rudabaugh, Tom Pickett and Billy Wilson. Only the foundation remains nowadays.\nThe musical production The Lighter Side of Stinking Springs centers around the stonehouse.

He retired in January 2018.\n\n\n== Downfall ==\nOn 15 April 2024, he was suspected of \"serious violations of laws and regulations\" by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), the party's internal disciplinary body, and the National Supervisory Commission, the highest anti-corruption agency of China. \nIncluding Du Zi, five party secretaries of the Tongliao were investigated. The other four are: Mo Jiancheng, Fu Tiegang, Song Liang, and Li Jiexiang.\nYun Guangzhong, his successor in Ordos, was sacked for graft in June 2019. His colleague Xing Yun, vice chairman of the Inner Mongolia Regional People's Congress from 2012 to 2016, was put under investigation in October 2018.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Reinwardtiodendron anamalaiense, is a species of flowering plant within the genus Reinwardtiodendron and family Meliaceae. It is an evergreen tree species native to India, where it is endemic to the Western Ghats. It is one of six known species within the genus Reinwardtiodendron.\n\n\n== Description ==\nReinwardtiodendron anamalaiense is a species of evergreen tree, which is capable of reaching heights of up to 20 m (66 ft) tall. The bark of the tree is lenticellate and greyish brown in colour. Younger branches are terete, grey in colour and tomentose.\n\n\n=== Leaves ===\nThe leaf is imparipinnate, characterized by a slender rachis measuring 4.2 to 11.5 cm (1.7 to 4.5 in) in length. It exhibits a swelling at its base, and is devoid of hairs. The leaf comprises 5–9 alternate leaflets, with each leaflet lacking stipules. Leaflets  are attached to a slender petiolule measuring 5 to 8 mm (0.20 to 0.31 in) in length, that is also hairless. The lamina of the leaf is elliptic, lanceolate, or elliptic-obovate in shape, ranging from 5 to 15 cm (2 to 6 in) in length and 1.5 to 5.5 cm (0.6 to 2.2 in) in width. Its base is oblique, attenuate, or cuneate, while the apex varies between acuminate, obtusely acuminate, or caudate-acuminate. All leaves possess a smooth margin and a tough, leathery texture. The leaf features 8–10 pairs of pinnate, prominent lateral nerves, accompanied by visible intercostal reticulations. The leaf also possesses domatia within its structure.\n\n\n=== Flowers and fruit ===\n\nThe blooms of this plant are polygamodioecious, possessing both male and female flowers on the same plant. These flowers are relatively small, measuring 3 to 4 mm (0.12 to 0.16 in) across, and exhibit a yellowish-white hue. The male flowers are arranged in axillary panicles, while the female flowers occur in axillary spikes or racemes. Each flower consists of five sepals, which are ovate-orbicular in shape and adorned with ciliate edges; these sepals are fused in the lower half. The petals are concave and arranged in an imbricate manner. The staminal tube is globose and crenulate, housing 9–10 stamens organized in two rows. The lower stamens are included within the tube, while the upper ones are partly exserted, sometimes with apiculate tips, and the attached filaments are prominent. The ovary is positioned superiorly and is globose in shape, housing five cells, with two ovules present in each cell. The style is short and thick, culminating in a stigma that is 3–5 lobed and truncate. Following pollination, the fruit develops into a berry, which is ovoid and white, with a scaly texture. Berries are oval shaped and around 1.8 cm (0.7 in) long. Within each berry, one to two seeds can be found embedded within a pulpy aril. Flowering and fruiting typically occurs between the months of March and November.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nReinwardtiodendron anamalaiense is native to Southwest India, where it is endemic to the Western Ghats region. The species is distributed within multiple Indian states including: Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala. R. anamalaiense grows within a wet tropical climate, where it can be found growing within in the subcanopy of evergreen forests. The species has been encountered growing at elevations of 1,400 metres (4,600 ft) above sea level.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The church of Beata Vergine Addolorata is a religious building located in Vigevano, in province of Pavia and diocese of Vigevano.\n\n\n== History and description ==\nThe first stone of the church was laid by bishop Giorgio Odescalchi on 3 May 1613. Originally it was a small chapel located outside Porta di Cicerino, or Porta Cesarea. The Confraternity of the Seven Sorrows was established in the church in 1657 on the orders of the bishop Pier Marino Sormani. Having declared the old chapel insufficient, in 1699 the brotherhood had part of the building demolished in order to be able to expand it. The new construction was completed in 1722.\nIn 1805 it was suppressed during the Napoleonic revolts; however, the brothers managed to purchase a good part of the objects present inside and the church itself, without suffering serious damage and opening it illegally starting from 1812. It was subsequently reopened for worship and repainted by Giovanni Battista Garberini.\nIt has a single Greek cross nave, a large neoclassical main altar and a dead Christ. Inside there is a statue depicting the Madonna of the Seven Sorrows, coming from the church of Misericordia. There are also four sixteenth-century paintings donated by bishop Odescalchi. Numerous art objects come from churches that disappeared during the Napoleonic looting of art. The church preserves a nativity scene from 1800.\n\n\n== References ==",

In March of 2022, Tyrone traveled on his Spring Break from MIT, taking a commercial flight from LaGuardia Airport to Lagos, Nigeria with 500 chess sets to meet Tunde Onakoya, The Founder of Chess in the Slums Africa. Chess sets were distributed across Lagos, most notably to children in Makoko.\nSeveral months later, 5,000 additional chess sets were sent to Africa reaching both Nigeria (3,000 sets) and Kenya (2,000 sets). From there 1,000 chess sets reached into Ghana and Uganda though assigned Ambassadors. Over 2023, 50,000 additional chess sets have been sent to Africa, being warehoused in both Accra, Ghana and Nairobi, Kenya. From these distribution hubs, 25 countries have received 1,000 chess sets through their local assigned ambassador. These sets are given to schools, prisons, orphanages, and community centers in batches of 5 chess sets each. In 2023 Susan Namangale from Malawi was named The Global Head.\nCountries reached include United States, Kenya, Uganda, Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal, Ivory Coast, Gambia, South Sudan, Somalia, Tanzania, Zambia, Malawi, Botswana, The Congo, Rwanda, Lesetho, Liberia, Ethiopia, Gabone, Togo, Eswantini, Namimbia, Seychelles, Mozambique, South Africa, Zimbabwe. The Gift of Chess has also donated 100 chess sets to each partner country's FIDE chess federation. \nIn May of 2024, 41,000 chess sets are planned to reach Panama for distribution across all of Central, South and Latin America.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Annie Coleman Peyton (1852 – November 12, 1898) was cofounder of the Industrial Institute and College in Columbus, Mississippi, in 1884 and served as an instructor at that institution from 1891 until her death in 1898.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nAnnie Coleman was born in 1852 and was a native of Madison County, Mississippi. In 1872, she graduated from Whitworth Female College, a Methodist women's college in Brookhaven, Mississippi.\n\n\n== Political activism ==\nDuring the 1870s, while teaching at Whitworth College, Peyton became appalled by the lack of a state-funded college for women comparable to those for men in Mississippi. During that time, Sallie Eola Reneau (b. 1837 – d. 1878) from Panola County, Mississippi, had convinced the Mississippi Legislature to pass several bills toward the creation of a state-funded female college, but the bills failed due to financial constraints following the American Civil War. Frustrated by the lack of progress in establishing a state university for women, Reneau left Mississippi.: 68 About 10 years after the unsuccessful efforts of Sallie Reneau, Annie Peyton and Olivia Valentine Hastings (b. 1843 – d. 1896), from Port Gibson, Mississippi, collaborated to actively influence the Mississippi legislature into creating a state-funded Industrial Institute and College for women.In 1880, Annie Peyton, using the byline \"A Mississippi Woman\", began writing to various Mississippi newspapers, such as the Clarion Ledger, advocating for the creation of a state-supported college for women in Mississippi. Those public messages generated support from state residents and prominent Mississippi politicians, and in 1884, the state legislature passed Senate Bill 311 creating the Industrial Institute and College for the Education of White Girls. That Industrial Institute and College became the first state-supported women's college in the United States. In October 1885, the first session began at the new Industrial Institute and College on the site of the former Columbus Female Institute (1847–1877), a private college in Columbus, Mississippi. In 1891, Annie Peyton joined the faculty at the new college as a history instructor and held that position until she died in 1898.\n\n\n== Personal life and legacy ==\nIn 1875, Annie Coleman married Ephraim G. Peyton Jr, son of Ephraim G. Peyton, Chief Justice (1870–1876) of the Mississippi Supreme Court. They made their home in Hazelhurst, Mississippi, and were the parents of seven children.The Industrial Institute and College for the Education of White Girls, that Annie Peyton cofounded, eventually morphed into the Mississippi University for Women.Following her death, Annie Coleman Peyton was inducted into the Mississippi Hall of Fame. Her portrait is on display in Mississippi's Old Capitol Museum in Jackson to honor her significant contributions to the state.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Citizen Kane is a 1941 American drama film directed by, produced by, and starring Orson Welles. Welles and Herman J. Mankiewicz wrote the screenplay. Citizen Kane is frequently cited as the greatest film ever made.Kane was the only film made under Welles's original contract with RKO Pictures, which gave him complete creative control.: 223  Welles's new business manager and attorney permitted the contract to lapse. In July 1941, Welles reluctantly signed a new and less favorable deal with RKO: 223  under which he produced and directed The Magnificent Ambersons (1942), produced Journey into Fear (1943), and began It's All True, a film he agreed to do without payment. In the new contract Welles was an employee of the studio and lost the right to final cut, which later allowed RKO to modify and re-cut The Magnificent Ambersons over his objections.: 223  In June 1942, Schaefer resigned the presidency of RKO Pictures and Welles's contract was terminated by his successor.The European release of Kane was delayed until after World War II, premiering in Paris in 1946. Initial reception by French critics was influenced by negative views from Jean-Paul Sartre and Georges Sadoul, who criticized Hollywood's cultural sophistication and the film's nostalgic use of flashbacks. However, critic André Bazin delivered a transformative speech in 1946 that shifted public opinion. Bazin praised the film for its innovative use of mise-en-scène and deep focus cinematography, advocating for a filmic realism that allows audiences to engage more actively with the narrative. Bazin's essays, especially \"The Technique of Citizen Kane,\" played a crucial role in enhancing the film's reputation, arguing it revolutionized film language and aesthetics. His defense of \"Citizen Kane\" as a work of art influenced other critics and contributed to a broader re-evaluation of the film in Europe and the United States.\nIn the U.S., the film was initially neglected until it began appearing on television in the 1950s and was re-released in theaters. American film critic Andrew Sarris was significant in reviving its reputation, describing it as a profoundly influential American film. Over the decades, \"Citizen Kane\" has been consistently ranked highly in critical surveys and polls, often cited as the greatest film ever made.\nThe film's narrative structure, cinematography, and themes have influenced countless filmmakers and films worldwide, asserting its place as a cornerstone in the history of cinema. Notable film directors and critics have acknowledged its impact on their work and the broader film landscape, underscoring its enduring legacy in both theory and practice.\n\n\n== Release in Europe ==\nDuring World War II, Citizen Kane was not seen in most European countries. It was shown in France for the first time on July 10, 1946, at the Marbeuf theater in Paris.: 34–35  Initially most French film critics were influenced by the negative reviews of Jean-Paul Sartre in 1945 and Georges Sadoul in 1946.: 118  At that time many French intellectuals and filmmakers shared Sartre's negative opinion that Hollywood filmmakers were uncultured.: 124  Sartre criticized the film's flashbacks for its nostalgic and romantic preoccupation with the past instead of the realities of the present and said that \"the whole film is based on a misconception of what cinema is all about. The film is in the past tense, whereas we all know that cinema has got to be in the present tense.\"André Bazin, a then little-known film critic working for Sartre's Les Temps modernes, was asked to give an impromptu speech about the film after a screening at the Colisée Theatre in the autumn of 1946: 36  and changed the opinion of much of the audience. This speech led to Bazin's 1947 article \"The Technique of Citizen Kane\",: 125  which directly influenced public opinion about the film.: 124  Carringer wrote that Bazin was \"the one who did the most to enhance the film's reputation.\": 118  Both Bazin's critique of the film and his theories about cinema itself centered around his strong belief in mise-en-scène. These theories were diametrically opposed to both the popular Soviet montage theory: xiii  and the politically Marxist and anti-Hollywood beliefs of most French film critics at that time.: 36  Bazin believed that a film should depict reality without the filmmaker imposing their \"will\" on the spectator, which the Soviet theory supported.: xiii  Bazin wrote that Citizen Kane's mise-en-scène created a \"new conception of filmmaking\": 233  and that the freedom given to the audience from the deep focus shots was innovative by changing the entire concept of the cinematic image.: 128  Bazin wrote extensively about the mise-en-scène in the scene where Susan Alexander attempts suicide, which was one long take while other films would have used four or five shots in the scene.: 234  Bazin wrote that the film's mise-en-scène \"forces the spectator to participate in the meaning of the film\" and creates \"a psychological realism which brings the spectator back to the real conditions of perception.\": 72 In his 1950 essay \"The Evolution of the Language of Cinema\", Bazin placed Citizen Kane center stage as a work which ushered in a new period in cinema.: 37  One of the first critics to defend motion pictures as being on the same artistic level as literature or painting, Bazin often used the film as an example of cinema as an art form: 129  and wrote that \"Welles has given the cinema a theoretical restoration. He has enriched his filmic repertory with new or forgotten effects that, in today's artistic context, take on a significance we didn't know they could have.\": 236  Bazin also compared the film to Roberto Rossellini's Paisan for having \"the same aesthetic concept of realism\": 117–118  and to the films of William Wyler shot by Toland (such as The Little Foxes and The Best Years of Our Lives), all of which used deep focus cinematography that Bazin called \"a dialectical step forward in film language.\": 71 Bazin's praise of the film went beyond film theory and reflected his own philosophy towards life itself.: 125  His metaphysical interpretations about the film reflected humankind's place in the universe.: 128  Bazin believed that the film examined one person's identity and search for meaning. It portrayed the world as ambiguous and full of contradictions, whereas films up until then simply portrayed people's actions and motivations.: 130  Bazin's biographer Dudley Andrew wrote that:\n\nThe world of Citizen Kane, that mysterious, dark, and infinitely deep world of space and memory where voices trail off into distant echoes and where meaning dissolves into interpretation, seemed to Bazin to mark the starting point from which all of us try to construct provisionally the sense of our lives.: 129 \nBazin went on to co-found Cahiers du cinéma, whose contributors (including future film directors François Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard) also praised the film.: 37  The popularity of Truffaut's auteur theory helped the film's and Welles's reputation.: 263 \n\n\n== Re-evaluation ==\nBy 1942 Citizen Kane had run its course theatrically and, apart from a few showings at big city arthouse cinemas, it largely vanished and both the film's and Welles's reputation fell among American critics. In 1949 critic Richard Griffith in his overview of cinema, The Film Till Now, dismissed Citizen Kane as \"... tinpot if not crackpot Freud.\": 117–118 In the United States, it was neglected and forgotten until its revival on television in the mid-to-late 1950s. Three key events in 1956 led to its re-evaluation in the United States: first, RKO was one of the first studios to sell its library to television, and early that year Citizen Kane started to appear on television; second, the film was re-released theatrically to coincide with Welles's return to the New York stage, where he played King Lear; and third, American film critic Andrew Sarris wrote \"Citizen Kane: The American Baroque\" for Film Culture, and described it as \"the great American film\" and \"the work that influenced the cinema more profoundly than any American film since The Birth of a Nation.\" Carringer considers Sarris's essay as the most important influence on the film's reputation in the US.: 119 During Expo 58, a poll of over 100 film historians named Kane one of the top ten greatest films ever made (the group gave first-place honors to Battleship Potemkin). When a group of young film directors announced their vote for the top six, they were booed for not including the film.: 152 In the decades since, its critical status as one of the greatest films ever made has grown, with numerous essays and books on it including Peter Cowie's The Cinema of Orson Welles, Ronald Gottesman's Focus on Citizen Kane, a collection of significant reviews and background pieces, and most notably Kael's essay, \"Raising Kane\", which promoted the value of the film to a much wider audience than it had reached before.: 120  Despite its criticism of Welles, it further popularized the notion of Citizen Kane as the great American film. The rise of art house and film society circuits also aided in the film's rediscovery.: 119  David Thomson said that the film 'grows with every year as America comes to resemble it.\": 1172 The British magazine Sight & Sound has produced a Top Ten list surveying film critics every decade since 1952, and is regarded as one of the most respected barometers of critical taste. Citizen Kane was a runner up to the top 10 in its 1952 poll but was voted as the greatest film ever made in its 1962 poll, retaining the top spot in every subsequent poll until 2012, when Vertigo displaced it.The film has also ranked number one in the following film \"best of\" lists: Julio Castedo's The 100 Best Films of the Century, Cahiers du cinéma's 100 films pour une cinémathèque idéale, Kinovedcheskie Zapiski, Time Out magazine's Top 100 Films (Centenary), The Village Voice's 100 Greatest Films, and The Royal Belgian Film Archive's Most Important and Misappreciated American Films.Roger Ebert called Citizen Kane the greatest film ever made: \"But people don't always ask about the greatest film. They ask, 'What's your favorite movie?' Again, I always answer with Citizen Kane.\"In 1998 Time Out conducted a reader's poll and Citizen Kane was voted 3rd best film of all time. On February 18, 1999, the United States Postal Service honored Citizen Kane by including it in its Celebrate the Century series. The film was honored again on February 25, 2003, in a series of U.S. postage stamps marking the 75th anniversary of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Art director Perry Ferguson represents the behind-the-scenes craftsmen of filmmaking in the series; he is depicted completing a sketch for Citizen Kane.Citizen Kane was ranked number one in the American Film Institute's polls of film industry artists and leaders in 1998 and 2007. \"Rosebud\" was chosen as the 17th most memorable movie quotation in a 2005 AFI poll. The film's score was one of 250 nominees for the top 25 film scores in American cinema in another 2005 AFI poll. In 2005 the film was included on Time's All-Time 100 best movies list.In 2012, the Motion Picture Editors Guild published a list of the 75 best-edited films of all time based on a survey of its membership. Citizen Kane was listed second. In 2015, Citizen Kane ranked 1st on BBC's \"100 Greatest American Films\" list, voted on by film critics from around the world.\n\n\n== Influence ==\nCitizen Kane has been called the most influential film of all time. Richard Corliss has asserted that Jules Dassin's 1941 film The Tell-Tale Heart was the first example of its influence and the first pop culture reference to the film occurred later in 1941 when the spoof comedy Hellzapoppin' featured a \"Rosebud\" sled. The film's cinematography was almost immediately influential and in 1942 American Cinematographer wrote \"without a doubt the most immediately noticeable trend in cinematography methods during the year was the trend toward crisper definition and increased depth of field.\": 51 The cinematography influenced John Huston's The Maltese Falcon. Cinematographer Arthur Edeson used a wider-angle lens than Toland and the film includes many long takes, low angles and shots of the ceiling, but it did not use deep focus shots on large sets to the extent that Citizen Kane did. Edeson and Toland are often credited together for revolutionizing cinematography in 1941.: 48–50  Toland's cinematography influenced his own work on The Best Years of Our Lives. Other films influenced include Gaslight, Mildred Pierce and Jane Eyre.: 85–86  Cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa said that his use of deep focus was influenced by \"the camera work of Gregg Toland in Citizen Kane\" and not by traditional Japanese art.Its cinematography, lighting, and flashback structure influenced such film noirs of the 1940s and 1950s as The Killers, Keeper of the Flame, Caught, The Great Man: 425  and This Gun for Hire.: 85–86  David Bordwell and Kristin Thompson have written that \"For over a decade thereafter American films displayed exaggerated foregrounds and somber lighting, enhanced by long takes and exaggerated camera movements.\" However, by the 1960s filmmakers such as those from the French New Wave and Cinéma vérité movements favored \"flatter, more shallow images with softer focus\" and Citizen Kane's style became less fashionable. American filmmakers in the 1970s combined these two approaches by using long takes, rapid cutting, deep focus and telephoto shots all at once.: 798  Its use of long takes influenced films such as The Asphalt Jungle, and its use of deep focus cinematography influenced Gun Crazy,: 389–390  The Whip Hand, The Devil's General and Justice Is Done.: 414  The flashback structure in which different characters have conflicting versions of past events influenced La commare secca: 533  and Man of Marble.: 747 The film's structure influenced the biographical films Lawrence of Arabia and Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters—which begin with the subject's death and show their life in flashbacks—as well as Welles's thriller Mr. Arkadin.: 154  Rosenbaum sees similarities in the film's plot to Mr. Arkadin, as well as the theme of nostalgia for loss of innocence throughout Welles's career, beginning with Citizen Kane and including The Magnificent Ambersons, Mr. Arkadin and Chimes at Midnight. Rosenbaum also points out how the film influenced Warren Beatty's Reds. The film depicts the life of Jack Reed through the eyes of Louise Bryant, much as Kane's life is seen through the eyes of Thompson and the people who he interviews. Rosenbaum also compared the romantic montage between Reed and Bryant with the breakfast table montage in Citizen Kane.: 113–116, 300–302 Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon is often compared to the film due to both having complicated plot structures told by multiple characters in the film. Welles said his initial idea for the film was \"Basically, the idea Rashomon used later on,\": 53  however Kurosawa had not yet seen the film before making Rashomon in 1950.: 78  Nigel Andrews has compared the film's complex plot structure to Rashomon, Last Year at Marienbad, Memento and Magnolia. Andrews also compares Charles Foster Kane to Michael Corleone in The Godfather, Jake LaMotta in Raging Bull and Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood for their portrayals of \"haunted megalomaniac[s], presiding over the shards of [their] own [lives].\"The films of Paul Thomas Anderson have been compared to it. Variety compared There Will Be Blood to the film and called it \"one that rivals Giant and Citizen Kane in our popular lore as origin stories about how we came to be the people we are.\" The Master has been called \"movieland's only spiritual sequel to Citizen Kane that doesn't shrivel under the hefty comparison\". The Social Network has been compared to the film for its depiction of a media mogul and by the character Erica Albright being similar to \"Rosebud\". The controversy of the Sony hacking before the release of The Interview brought comparisons of Hearst's attempt to suppress the film. The film's plot structure and some specific shots influenced Todd Haynes's Velvet Goldmine. Abbas Kiarostami's The Traveler has been called \"the Citizen Kane of the Iranian children's cinema.\" The film's use of overlapping dialogue has influenced the films of Robert Altman and Carol Reed.: 412  Reed's films Odd Man Out, The Third Man (in which Welles and Cotten appeared) and Outcast of the Islands were also influenced by the film's cinematography.: 425 Many directors have listed it as one of the greatest films ever made, including Woody Allen, Michael Apted, Les Blank, Kenneth Branagh, Paul Greengrass, Satyajit Ray, Michel Hazanavicius, Michael Mann, Sam Mendes, Jiří Menzel, Paul Schrader, Martin Scorsese, Denys Arcand, Gillian Armstrong, John Boorman, Roger Corman, Alex Cox, Miloš Forman, Norman Jewison, Richard Lester, Richard Linklater, Paul Mazursky, Ronald Neame, Sydney Pollack and Stanley Kubrick. Yasujirō Ozu said it was his favorite non-Japanese film and was impressed by its techniques.: 231  François Truffaut said that the film \"has inspired more vocations to cinema throughout the world than any other\" and recognized its influence in The Barefoot Contessa, Les Mauvaises Rencontres, Lola Montès, and 8 1/2.: 279–280  Truffaut's Day for Night pays tribute to the film in a dream sequence depicting a childhood memory of the character played by Truffaut stealing publicity photos from the film. Numerous film directors have cited the film as influential on their own films, including Theo Angelopoulos, Luc Besson, the Coen brothers, Francis Ford Coppola, Brian De Palma, John Frankenheimer, Stephen Frears, Sergio Leone, Michael Mann, Ridley Scott, Martin Scorsese, Bryan Singer and Steven Spielberg. Bollywood film director and producer Vidhu Vinod Chopra expressed his thoughts on Citizen Kane in his book Unscripted: Conversations on Life and Cinema. He said, 'Let's say you are blind and you have never seen a beautiful sunset in your entire life and suddenly you get an eyesight and you see a sunset. Citizen Kane was like that for me. I was blind. Before that, I had mostly seen only Hindi movies'. While I was watching Citizen Kane, I asked myself, \"If I died and gone to the heaven of cinema\".\nIngmar Bergman disliked the film and called it \"a total bore. Above all, the performances are worthless. The amount of respect that movie has is absolutely unbelievable!\"William Friedkin said that the film influenced him and called it \"a veritable quarry for filmmakers, just as Joyce's Ulysses is a quarry for writers.\": 210  The film has also influenced other art forms. Carlos Fuentes's novel The Death of Artemio Cruz was partially inspired by the film and the rock band The White Stripes paid unauthorized tribute to the film in the song \"The Union Forever\".\n\n\n== Film memorabilia ==\nIn 1982, film director Steven Spielberg bought a \"Rosebud\" sled for $60,500; it was one of three balsa sleds used in the closing scenes and the only one that was not burned. Spielberg eventually donated the sled to the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures as he stated he felt it belonged in a museum. After the Spielberg purchase, it was reported that retiree Arthur Bauer claimed to own another \"Rosebud\" sled. In early 1942, when Bauer was 12, he had won an RKO publicity contest and selected the hardwood sled as his prize. In 1996, Bauer's estate offered the painted pine sled at auction through Christie's. Bauer's son told CBS News that his mother had once wanted to paint the sled and use it as a plant stand, but Bauer told her to \"just save it and put it in the closet.\" The sled was sold to an anonymous bidder for $233,500.Welles's Oscar for Best Original Screenplay was believed to be lost until it was rediscovered in 1994. It was withdrawn from a 2007 auction at Sotheby's when bidding failed to reach its estimate of $800,000 to $1.2 million. Owned by the charitable Dax Foundation, it was auctioned for $861,542 in 2011 to an anonymous buyer. Mankiewicz's Oscar was sold at least twice, in 1999 and again in 2012, the latest price being $588,455.In 1989, Mankiewicz's personal copy of the Citizen Kane script was auctioned at Christie's. The leather-bound volume included the final shooting script and a carbon copy of American that bore handwritten annotations—purportedly made by Hearst's lawyers, who were said to have obtained it in the manner described by Kael in \"Raising Kane\". Estimated to bring $70,000 to $90,000, it sold for a record $231,000.In 2007, Welles's personal copy of the last revised draft of Citizen Kane before the shooting script was sold at Sotheby's for $97,000. A second draft of the script titled American, marked \"Mr. Welles' working copy\", was auctioned by Sotheby's in 2014 for $164,692. A collection of 24 pages from a working script found in Welles's personal possessions by his daughter Beatrice Welles was auctioned in 2014 for $15,000.In 2014, a collection of approximately 235 Citizen Kane stills and production photos that had belonged to Welles was sold at auction for $7,812.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Greens was a restaurant at 41 to 43 Lapwing Lane in West Didsbury. An existing vegetarian restaurant, Greens was reopened in 1990 by Simon Rimmer and Simon Connolly after they spotted it in a pub, and Rimmer became its chef after discovering that they could not afford to hire someone. The restaurant appeared in the AA guide for 31 of the next 33 years, became the first purely vegetarian restaurant to appear in The Good Food Guide, and has appeared on a number of 'best of' lists, with MasterChef winner Simon Wood spending a period cooking there between winning and setting up his own restaurant. A sister restaurant opened in Sale, Greater Manchester, in July 2022, which remained open after the West Didsbury branch closed in 2024 as part of the 2021–present United Kingdom cost-of-living crisis.\n\n\n== History ==\nSimon Rimmer met his business partner Simon Connolly while working at a café in Didsbury; one was a waiter, while the other worked front of house. In 1990, Rimmer was working as a part-time designer and as a lecturer, and Connolly was working as a restaurant hotel manager. While eating a Nepalese curry and drinking beer, Rimmer and Connolly noticed a small vegetarian café, and wondered if it could be converted into a proper vegetarian restaurant; by chance, Rimmer happened to drive past the next day as a 'for sale' sign was going up, and the pair bought the restaurant twelve weeks later, using £2,000 they had between them and £40,000 from the bank. At the time, they were under the impression that they would have enough money to employ a chef and that they could spend their time harassing women; having discovered that they did not, they tossed a coin to see who would learn to cook, which Rimmer lost. Didsbury was not a particularly pleasant place in 1990; Rimmer used a 2024 piece in ManchestersFinest.com to observe that, at the time, drug deals behind the car park of the nearby Metropolitan gastropub were commonplace. The pair kept the restaurant vegetarian in order to keep its existing clientele. Rimmer and Connolly later used the proceeds to open other restaurants.The restaurant closed for a month in 2007, when it reopened, it had almost doubled in size. Simon Wood, who won the 2015 series of MasterChef, worked at Greens for period shortly after winning before setting up his own restaurant, Wood. Rimmer later opened a sister restaurant of the same name in Stanley Square in Sale, Greater Manchester in July 2022, with the kitchen a converted bank vault, and the interiors inspired by The Butcher's Daughter, an American plant-based restaurant; upon opening, the branch attracted attention on social media for its use of unisex public toilets. The West Didsbury restaurant announced its immediate closure in January 2024 after the landlord increased rent by 35% and its energy costs quintupled. The closure came within a challenging period for restaurateurs, with eight restaurants closing every day, and later that month, Rimmer and several other restaurants called for Rishi Sunak, the then-Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, to halve value-added tax.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nWithin two years, the restaurant had appeared in the AA guide, spending 31 of 33 years there, and became the first purely vegetarian restaurant to appear in The Good Food Guide; by the time of its temporary 2007 closure, it was one of six. ManchestersFinest.com credited the restaurant with improving the profile of Didsbury. Jonathan Schofield of Confidentials.com visited Greens in March 2015, and noted that Rimmer \"provides clever vegetarian food with a bit of fun added in\". SquareMeal described Greens as \"arguably the North’s leading vegetarian restaurant\" in January 2019 and found the atmosphere \"buzzy and laid-back\". The Daily Telegraph listed it as one of the \"top restaurants for vegetarians in the UK\" in May 2019 and as one of the \"16 best restaurants in Manchester\" in April 2023.Ria Ghey of Manchesterworld.uk wrote in October 2023 that the \"eclectic interior of Parisian-inspired artwork and frill-tastic lamp gave a welcoming vibe befitting a bustling neighbourhood restaurant\". Rob Martin used a May 2021 Time Out review to describe dining at the restaurant in its early days \"felt a bit like being invited to dine with a really sophisticated friend's family; slightly bohemian but very professional with two lovely blokes at the helm\", noted that \"the food was a revelation for many used to veggie meals consisting of just lentils and something mushy\", and that the restaurant remained \"the delightful experience it always has been, somehow still managing to feel like you're in someone's home\".\n\n\n== References ==",

Its mass is 1.200 ± 0.041 solar mass for a radius of 1.392 ± 0.044 solar radii, or a density of 0.630 ± 0.046 grams per cubic centimeter.\n\n\n== Planetary system ==\nWASP-20b is a transiting hot Jupiter discovered in 2014. WASP-20b orbits WASP-20 in less than five Earth days very close to its star (0.06 AU) in a circular (near-zero eccentricity) orbit. The orbit is inclined by 85.56 ± 0.22° relative to the plane of the sky and is thus edge-on, as necessary for a transit to be observed.\n\n\n== See also ==\nWide Angle Search for Planets\nLists of planets\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Minstrel Man from Georgia is a compilation album by the American musician Emmett Miller, released in 1996. It was part of Legacy Recordings' Roots n' Blues collection. The compilation was reissued in 2001 to coincide with Nick Tosches's Miller biography. Tosches, who first wrote about Miller in his 1977 book, Country: The Biggest Music in America, expanded his research for the 2001 book, Where Dead Voices Gather.\n\n\n== Production ==\nInterest in Miller grew over the years due to Tosches's writings as well as the Merle Haggard album I Love Dixie Blues; Haggard had first heard Miller while visiting an ill Bob Wills. The songs on the compilation were recorded in New York City in 1928 and 1929 and originally released by OKeh Records. Miller was back by the Georgia Crackers, a group that included Jimmy and Tommy Dorsey. Gene Krupa, Jack Teagarden, and Eddie Lang appeared on some of the tracks. The liner notes are by musicologist Charles Wolfe. The compilation added six tracks not found on a previous collection, 1969's Emmet Miller Acc. by His Georgia Crackers [sic]. While an influence on Jimmie Rodgers and Hank Williams, Miller considered his music and minstrel act to be a job, not a representation of his creativity or artistic imagination. The compilation includes two skits as well as comedy bits that precede some of the songs. Miller's recording of \"Lovesick Blues\" was an inspiration for Williams's version. \"St. Louis Blues\" is a version of the W. C. Handy song; it was for years a standard of blackface entertainers. \"Anytime\" is a version of the song written by Herbert Lawson and later covered by Eddy Arnold.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nPeter Margasak, in the Chicago Reader, called Miller \"the best and most important white blues singer ever... While superficially mimicking the vocal mannerisms of rural blacks, Miller in essence tapped into a wellspring of emotionalism that eclipsed the folk forms of the south and offered an alternative to the slick urbanity of early jazz singers.\" Stereo Review labeled the album \"the year's most illuminating reissue,\" and noted that \"Miller emerges from these still-vital recordings as the father of modern country music, a case could also be made for him as one of the most supple and rhythmically assured male jazz vocalists of the Twenties.\" Chuck Eddy considered Miller \"the missing link between Mark Twain and the Beastie Boys,\" writing, \"I've never before heard a singer this high and long and nasal; Jimmie Rodgers and Hank Williams ripped off Emmett's vocal mannerisms outright, but they sound strained compared to him.\"\nThe Boston Globe opined that \"there is just something infectious about that voice... Maybe it's the clear, clean phrasing with its odd falsetto breaks that, though they may be loosely described as yodels, are more personal quirk than Alpine import.\" The New York Daily News concluded that Miller \"was one of those critical 'bridge artists' who took old traditions and reworked them to bring the music up to the next generation.\" The Toronto Star noted that a listener heard \"not only the lonesome pre-echoes of Rodgers, Wills, Williams and Gene Autry, but perhaps even the primordial collision of minstrelsy, country and blues that would eventually mutate into rock 'n' roll.\" The Journal of American Folklore called Miller \"one of the most original yodelers in American music.\"\nSpin determined that Miller's \"bleat [is] as powerful as early electric guitar\"; the magazine included the compilation on its list of \"The 10 Best Albums You Didn't Hear in '96\". Chris Morris, in Billboard, listed The Minstrel Man from Georgia as the 10th best album of 1996. AllMusic deemed the compilation \"more of historical interest and musical significance than anything else.\" MusicHound Folk: The Essential Album Guide considered it \"a masterpiece in musical archaeology.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

He mostly breeded Abyssinian and Bengal cats to get the Kanaani.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nThe breed is characterized by a muscular and athletic appearance, with short and coarse fur, long legs, small feet and a strong tail. The facial structure includes large almond-shaped eyes, and ears that are far apart compared to other cat breeds.\nThe color of the Kanaani cat's eyes ranges from green to yellow. Its fur comes in many shades of colors: brown, coffee, cinnamon, with a dotted, striped or marble texture.\nThe breed is active, energetic, playful and affectionate, but is also independent.\n\n\n== References ==",

A graduate in gender studies and political science from Stockholm University, Rung has worked with the Stockholm police to investigate sexual crimes against children. Together with her partner Peter Svensson, she has founded Huskuraged, a non-profit organization which provides guidelines for neighbours, encouraging them to act if they experiences signs of domestic violence. She now devotes much of her time to lecturing on violence prevention and supporting Huskurage.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBorn in Stockholm on 26 December 1981, Nina Rung attended Stockholm University, graduating in gender studies in 2004. She went on to earn a further bachelor's degree in criminology in 2007.\n\n\n== Career ==\nRung is active as a criminologist with the Stockholm police where she has investigated serious acts of violence between partners as well as sexual violence against children. She devotes much of her time to lecturing on how people can help to diminish the problem. She has also been critical of the related shortcomings of the Swedish legal system. In 2014, together with her partner Peter Svensson, she created Huskurage which was designed to prevent domestic violence by encouraging neighbours to act if they become aware of indications that adults or children can be hurt. It provides simple guidelines on what to do if there are signs of violence in the neighbourhood.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nIn 2020, Nina Rung was awarded the Zaida Catalán prize for disseminating knowledge about sexual violence and influencing public opinion through her Hushurage association. This was seen as a significant contribution to improved rights for children and women.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNina Rung's website (in Swedish)",

        "content": "Once to Every Heart is a 2005 studio album by Mark Murphy.\nOnce to Every Heart is the 44th recorded album by American jazz vocalist Mark Murphy. It was recorded when Murphy was 70 years old and released by Verve Records three years later in the United States in 2005. The release is a collection of torch songs and ballads praised by many reviews as a late career masterpiece by Mark Murphy. The project was spearheaded by producer Till Brönner after recording with Murphy for Brönner's album Blue Eyed Soul.\nMark Murphy recorded Once to Every Heart in two days at Till's Studio, Berlin in 2002 with Brönner and pianist Frank Chastenier. Orchestrations were later added by Nan Schwartz. The release includes Murphy's own composition \"I Know You From Somewhere\" (track 5). Brönner wrote \"Our Game\" with Rob Hoare.\n\n\n== Background ==\nPeter Jones in the biography This is Hip: The Life of Mark Murphy, and James Gavin in the liner notes to Once to Every Heart,  both describe the initial encounter between Murphy and Brönner and the development of the album. Author Jones recounts that Brönner was passing by the A-Trane jazz club in Berlin after a radio engagement in 2001 and saw that Murphy was performing. Brönner, listening from the front of the stage in the half-empty club, \"became aware that Murphy was directing the local trio in a way he had never seen a singer do before. And when Mark sat down alone at the piano to accompany himself on a ballad at the end of the show, Brönner found that tears were rolling down his cheeks\". It was the first time Brönner had seen Murphy live. Brönner told James Gavin that Murphy \"was absolutely brilliant, showing the trio what he wanted onstage by almost 'conducting' with his voice...I started crying because it touched me so much\".\nAfter their meeting, Murphy later recorded \"Dim the Lights\" on Brönner's own Blue Eyed Soul in a trip-hop style. Brönner said, \"as he was leaving the studio, I put to him the idea of recording an album in there. He said, 'What kind of album?' I said, 'I remember that evening at the A-Trane, and very few things in life have moved me as much as that performance\". But Murphy was reluctant to do an all ballad album. Brönner persisted. Jones writes, \"His insight was that Murphy possessed the rare ability to tap into profound, half-buried emotional conflicts, in a way that made his ballad performances extremely moving\". Brönner said, \"For me, only Frank Sinatra has the same ability to make me feel he is speaking to me when he sings...The songs that Mark sounded so good on were the ones that contained a big unresolved emotion. The mother of all love songs is disappointment, unrequited love, and that's something that you feel you shouldn't show\".\nDan Ouellette interviewed Murphy for a feature article in DownBeat in 1997. Murphy said, “I love doing ballads. That’s when I feel I can communicate one-to-one with listeners. People tell me that it’s as if I’m singing directly to them... But the gold is that when you reach maturity as vocalists, you begin to sing your life. You’re not just performing. You’re putting your life into your songs.\" Author Will Friedwald points out that Once to Every Heart was Murphy's first release for a major label since Song For the Geese eight years earlier and his first album of standards and ballads in nearly two decades.\n\n\n== Recording ==\nMark Murphy recorded the tracks in two days in 2002 at Till's Studio, Berlin with Till Brönner and Frank Chastenier. Orchestrations were later added at Teldex Studio in Berlin. Their idea was to create an atmosphere of relaxation and intimacy. Murphy was close-miked and the only other musicians in the studio were Brönner and pianist Frank Chastenier. Brönner's own contributions were sparse. Brönner said, \"What could you possibly add after this guy sang\"?\nMurphy later gave Brönner a recording of his that he liked with string arrangements by Nan Schwartz, a student of Johnny Mandel's. Brönner contacted Schwartz. And after listening to tapes of what Murphy had recorded in Brönner's studio, Schwartz said, \"I am absolutely overwhelmed by what I'm hearing, and I have to be part of this production. No matter what kind of budget you have, we'll find a way to do it.\" Schwartz did string arrangements to fit around the existing recordings, added bassist Christian Von Kaphengst, flutes, and overdubbed the original recordings in Berlin, conducting the Deutsches Symphonie Orchester.\nSpeaking with Ted Pankin in a Jazziz interview about working with orchestrator Nan Schwartz, Murphy said, \"I wasn’t there when the orchestra was put on. In the old days, everything you heard on the LPs was done right there, including the strings. I don’t know whether I prefer it or not. Well, see, with Nan Schwartz, she has a sixth sense about how I sing, and so I have no worries there\".\nAfter the orchestrations were added Brönner was able to convince Universal/Verve to release the project though they had been initially uninterested. However, Murphy was under contract with HighNote and so there was a long delay in releasing the album. The album's title song was one that Murphy had been carrying for decades, ever since he heard the Jo Stafford single from 1952 written by Paul Weston, Stafford's husband with lyrics by Michael S Stoner.\n\nIn the liner notes, Murphy describes the album as \"one of the greatest thrills of my career.\" He told James Gavin, \"I guess maybe it's the best thing I've done\". \"I don't ever want to record any other way,\" he told Jazz Times...I'd like to make a couple more records like that and see where it leads us.\" Gavin describes Murphy as \"a bruised romantic who goes fearlessly into the dark places of the soul. He is miked so closely here that not a crevice of his voice is unexposed...The results are as stark and powerful as BIllie Holiday's Lady in Satin\". Gavin calls Murphy \"one of the greatest singer-storytellers in jazz\". He characterizes Murphy's voice as \"a rugged bass-baritone...now richer then ever\".\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe AllMusic entry gives the album 4 stars. In the review author Thom Jurek writes, \"Mark Murphy has, for decades, given listeners breathtaking performances that underscore the very heart of song itself.\" Jurek says, \"Ultimately, this is Murphy's finest recording in over a decade, and should be embraced by anyone with a remote interest in great singers, and by those who are deeply attached to ballads or torch tomes. This is essential listening.\" He singles out the track 2 and 3 medleys for praise, and Duke Ellington's \"Do Nothin' Till You Hear from Me\" as \"one of the finest, most unsentimental and burningly sensual versions of the song ever recorded\". He calls the final track (Gershwin's \"Our Love Is Here to Stay\") \"simply beguiling and mischievous\".\nThe Penguin Guide to Jazz assigns 3 stars (meaning a good if middleweight set; one that lacks the stature or consistency of the finest records, but which is certainly rewarding on its own terms) and the review says, \"The Verve album looks like a slightly strange one-off. The setting is the kind of lush, rhapsodic mood which Brönner's records have customarily been involved with, and Murphy certainly sounds like he's enjoying the upholstery. But it's rather one-noted: creakingly slow tempos throughout, and after 30 minutes or so one longs for a burst of familiar Murphy adrenalin\".\nJohn Fordham assigns 3/5 stars in The Guardian review and states that Murphy's performances \"are evidence of the audacity that has made him such a unique performer over almost half a century\". Fordham finds the interaction between Murphy and Brönner to be the core of the album and says Murphy's \"uncanny timing is as bold and faultless as ever on \"Our Love Is Here to Stay\".\nBiographer Peter Jones calls the recordings on this release, \"some of the greatest music of Mark Murphy's career\". Jones finds an \"unusual degree of rapport between Murphy and Brönner, helped in no small measure by the 70-year-old's road-roughened gravel in combination with the trumpet's high, breathy Baker-like notes. Murphy's wide vocal range is particularly evident here, now that he could descend as far as the E-flat two octaves below middle C\". Jones highlights the title track, \"Our Game\", \"Bein' Green\", and the \"medley of \"Skylark\", a tune of romantic longing, and \"You Don't Know What Love Is\", one of anguished loss\" which \"really twists\" \"the emotional knife\".\nWill Friedwald calls “I Know You from Somewhere,” one of Murphy's most successful original compositions. Friedwald heard Murphy explain during a live performance that the song was written \"in the immediate after math of 9/11 and that it described two people encountering each other again in this frightening new world\". In his book, A Biographical Guide to the Great Jazz and Pop Singers, Friedwald writes, \"There is no one better at taking a familiar or even unfamiliar old song and turning it inside out, spilling its guts and finding the feeling underneath. What has never been clearer than now is that at his best, Murphy does not abstract and skewer a song merely for the sake of being different, but to get at its inner meaning. By making you think differently about a song you’ve heard before, he makes it relevant and meaningful all over again\". Friedwald also highlights \"I'm Through With Love\", saying Murphy's falsetto \"may be the most creative use of the falsetto in jazz singing since Cab Calloway\".\nAuthor Andrew Rowan acknowledges Murphy as one of the best interpreters of the Great American Songbook and finds him at his top in this release of ballads only, praising his rhythmic sense, intonation, melodic improvisation, emotional expressiveness, and story telling ability. Biographer Peter Jones included \"Our Game\" (track 4) in his article \"10 tracks by Mark Murphy I Can’t Do Without\" in the London Jazz News series \"10 Tracks I Can’t Do Without\". The Jazzwise (UK) October 2005 review said, \"A triumphant reminder of the enduring brilliance of a vocalist whose name should be mentioned in the same breath as the Sinatras, Hendricks and Beys of this world.\"  The JazzTimes December 2005 review said, \"Born out of Murphy's understandable admiration for eerily Chet Baker-esque German trumpeter Till Bronner...In a year crowded with laudable releases, the single finest jazz-vocal album of 2005\". The Jazz Rag (Birmingham, UK) December 2005 review said, \"Murphy sounds more vulnerable and exposed than ever before. Very close miking reveals every nuance of his voice in minute detail. Sometimes his singing is full bodied and passionate. Far more often it is quiet and very intimate, with silence used to great dramatic effect\".  The 2005 Down Beat review said, \"It's thrilling to hear an old master reach a new level of artistry\". Scott Yanow includes the album in his list of \"other worthy recordings of the last twenty years\" by Mark Murphy in his book The Jazz Singers: The Ultimate Guide. Yanow also reviewed the album in Jazziz in 2006 singling out \"Once to Every Heart\", \"I'm Through With Love\", and the \"Skylark\" medley, praising Murphy's subtle improvisations, attention to the lyrics. He said Murphy's 70 year old voice was still \"very much in its prime\".\nSpeaking of Murphy's bass-baritone voice in a 1997 Village Voice article, James Gavin said it was “as agile and resonant as Ben Webster’s saxophone”, it “seems to creep from the shadows of some long-ago jazz dive. In person he tends toward wild, boppish deconstructions of jazz standards, but most of his devotees favor his ballads, in which the most idyllic sentiments can sound painfully raw.\" Murphy recorded Once to Every Heart as he entered his early 70s. Of course his voice had changed over the decades. Peter Jones wrote, “His voice retained both its accuracy and its extraordinary range into old age. Although his original model was the trumpet of Miles Davis, the voice was more akin to the trombone or French horn. By his seventies, it had acquired a gnarled and leathery maturity that added poignancy to his late recordings, particularly Once to Every Heart and Love is What Stays. Even as he passed 80, he was able to sing beautifully, although not consistently so”.\nThe album reportedly sold between 20,000 and 30,000 records.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"I'm Through With Love\" (Fud Livingston, Matty Malneck, Gus Kahn) – 7:36\n\"When I Fall in Love / My One and Only Love\" (Victor Young, Edward Heyman / Robert Mellin, Guy Wood) – 5:06\n\"Skylark / You Don't Know What Love Is\" (Hoagy Carmichael, Johnny Mercer / Gene de Paul, Don Raye) – 6:22\n\"Our Game\" (Till Brönner, Rob Hoare) – 6:14\n\"I Know You From Somewhere\" (Mark Murphy) – 6:40\n\"Bein' Green\" (Joe Raposo) – 5:00\n\"Once to Every Heart\" (Paul Weston, Michael S.

        "content": "Bonica Brown (née Lough; born August 4, 1988) is an American powerlifter competing in the IPF. She is a World Games champion, a 4-time Equipped World Champion, a 2-time Sub-Junior Equipped World Champion, and a 7-time Classic World Champion, and she has held multiple world records in each division.\n\n\n== Powerlifting career ==\n\n\n=== Powerlifting championships ===\n\n\n==== 2002–2008: Junior & Sub-Junior division ====\nBrown began lifting weights on November 25, 2002, at the age of 14. 18 months later, she competed in the IPF open and sub-junior world championships in the 90-kilogram weight class. She secured 5th place in the open competition and first place in the sub-junior competition, where she also broke several sub-junior world records.\nIn 2006, Brown extended her sub-junior records in the 90-kilogram weight class at the 2006 IPF World Open Powerlifting Championships. She would secure second place in the competition.\n\n\n==== 2013–present: Open division ====\nBrown had stopped competing in powerlifting in 2008, but returned in 2013. She was coached by Kimberly Walford at USA Powerlifting Equipped Nationals, where she won the competition.\nIn 2018, Brown broke all five world records in the classic 84+ kilogram weight class in the squat, bench press full power and single lift, deadlift, and total at the 2018 IPF World Classic Powerlifting Championships.\nIn 2023, Brown competed at the inaugural SBD Sheffield Powerlifting Championships after winning the 2022 IPF World Classic Powerlifting Championships. At Sheffield, she secured a new squat world record of 280 kilograms and a total world record of 680 kilograms, and securing 5th at the competition. She competed at the IPF World Classic Powerlifting Championships the same year, squatting 289 kilograms for a world record. However, her record would be annulled after failing to register a total, and the record holder would be given to Sonita Muluh of Belgium, who squatted 285.5 kilograms at the same competition.\n\n\n=== The World Games ===\nBrown qualified for the 2017 World Games, competing as a super heavyweight powerlifter. She would win the competition with a score of 600.71, as well as a squat world record of 310.5 kilograms and a total world record of 763 kilograms.\nBrown competed at the 2022 World Games as a super heavyweight powerlifter a second time and broke her squat world record. Initially, Brown had won the competition on her last deadlift attempt of 262.5 kilograms, but the jury overruled her final attempt to a no lift. She secured second place in the competition, losing gold to Rhaea Stinn of Canada.\n\n\n== Personal records ==\n\n\n=== Competition bests ===\n\n\n==== Equipped ====\nSquat: 325 kg (2019)\nBench Press: 202.5 kg (2019)\nDeadlift: 360.5 kg (2018)\nTotal: 793 kg (2019)\n\n\n==== Raw ====\nSquat: 289 kg (2023)\nBench Press: 155 kg (2021)\nDeadlift: 252.5 kg (2023)\nTotal: 680 kg (2023)\n\n\n=== Record lifts in competition ===\n\n\n==== Equipped ====\nSquat – 230 kg – IPF Sub-Junior World Record – 11/10/2006 (-90 kg)\nBench Press – 125 kg – IPF Sub-Junior World Record – 11/10/2006 (-90 kg)\nDeadlift – 212.5 kg – IPF Sub-Junior World Record – 11/10/2006 (-90 kg)\nTotal – 567.5 kg – IPF Sub-Junior World Record – 11/10/2006 (-90 kg)\nDeadlift – 260.5 kg – USA Powerlifting Equipped American Record – 5/18/2018 (+84 kg)\nTotal – 778 kg – USA Powerlifting Equipped American Record – 5/18/2018 (+84 kg)\nSquat – 325 kg – USA Powerlifting Equipped American Record – 5/3/2019 (+84 kg)\nBench Press – 220 kg – USA Powerlifting Equipped Full Power American Record – 11/18/2019 (+84 kg)\nBench Press – 220 kg – USA Powerlifting Equipped Bench Press Only American Record – 11/18/2019 (+84 kg)\nSquat – 322.5 kg – IPF Equipped Open World Record – 7/10/2022 (+84 kg)\nTotal – 791 kg – IPF Equipped Open World Record – 7/10/2022 (+84 kg)\n\n\n==== Raw ====\nSquat – 242.5 kg – USA Powerlifting Raw American Record – 7/20/2014 (+90 kg)\nBench Press – 140 kg – USA Powerlifting Raw Full Power American Record – 10/10/2014 (+90 kg)\nDeadlift – 227.5 kg – USA Powerlifting Raw American Record – 7/20/2014 (+90 kg)\nTotal – 610 kg – USA Powerlifting Raw American Record – 7/20/2014 (+90 kg)\nBench Press – 151.5 kg – USA Powerlifting Raw Full Power American Record – 10/10/2017 (+84 kg)\nBench Press – 151.5 kg – USA Powerlifting Raw Bench Press Only American Record – 10/10/2017 (+84 kg)\nBench Press – 151.5 kg – IPF Classic Open Full Power World Record – 6/6/2018 (+84 kg)\nBench Press – 151.5 kg – IPF Classic Open Bench Press Only World Record – 6/6/2018 (+84 kg)\nDeadlift – 247 kg – USA Powerlifting Raw American Record – 6/6/2018 (+84 kg)\nDeadlift – 247 kg – IPF Classic Open World Record – 6/6/2018 (+84 kg)\nTotal – 671.5 kg – USA Powerlifting Raw American Record – 6/6/2018 (+84 kg)\nSquat – 276 kg – USA Powerlifting Raw American Record – 6/1/2021 (+84 kg)\nSquat – 280 kg – IPF Classic Open World Record – 3/25/2023 (+84 kg)\nTotal – 680 kg – IPF Classic Open World Record – 3/25/2023 (+84 kg)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Londos family was a military family of Vostitsa (Aigio), which flourished during the years of Ottoman Greece through the Greek War of Independence. They declined in prominence beginning in the 1840s. They were a branch of the Achaean Londos family.\n\n\n== Origins ==\nIn 1715, Golfinos Londos, the progenitor of this branch of the Londos family, settled permanently in Vostitsa, coming from Kalanos Nezeron where he was born. There he began to purchase estates and engage in trade, which brought him enormous profits. Within a few years, Golfinos gained great influence among the Kocabaşis and was eventually recognized as the ruler of the region.\n\n\n== Acne ==\nThe Londos family of Vostitsa was actively involved in the Orlovic movement of 1770, but managed to escape the wrath of the Turks. From the testimonies of the time it seems that members of the family maintained friendly relations with the Turks. In 1778, Sotirakis Londos was appointed general commissioner of the Peloponnese. The family's influence grew even more a few years later, when Sotirakis Londos occupied the office of Moragianis (first tier of Kocabaṣı). \nAfter that point, the prokritoi of Peloponnese were divided into two factions. The first was of Achaikos, headed by the Londos family and supported by the prefects of Vostitsa, Patras, Ilia, and the second was of Karytaina. Finally the nobles of Karytaina succeeded in beheading Sotirakis Londos. Taking advantage of this blow against the Londos family, Ioannis Deligiannis-Papagiannopoulos established a illegitimate branch of his own house in the area of Nezerohoria within the lands of Londos, who come from Kalanos Nezeron, thus aiming on the one hand at the constant friction of his main competitors with the relatives and allies of Papagiannopoulos, who they settled with a focus on the neighboring Kalanistra, and on the one hand in the general neutralization of any hostile influence in the area north of Gortynia.\nDuring the Greek War of Independence in 1821 the Londos family gave their best. Its members had prepared for the impending rebellion since they had already been initiated into the Filiki Eteria since 1818. With the beginning of the revolution, he formed a corps of 700 soldiers and took part in the battles of Patras and Messolonghi, while he also played an important role in the civil war.\nAfter the end of the revolution, many members of the Londos family held important positions such as prime ministers, ministers, senators, presidents of the Parliament, parliamentarians, generals, admirals, mayors, etc. Its most active member was Andreas S. Londos.\n\n\n== Decline ==\nFrom 1840 the most important representative of the family, Andreas, began to face great financial difficulties. At first he borrowed money from his brothers, Loukas and Anastasios, but later his brothers, unable to continue lending to him, began to confiscate his estates. In particular, his brother Anastasios confiscated a large part of his real estate property, causing his financial problem to swell. \nWith the resignation of the Mavrokordatos Government, of which he was a minister, Andreas Londos was marginalized even more, while he was prosecuted by Ioannis Kolettis. Finally, on September 24, 1845, unable to bear his failure, he committed suicide with a gun at his home in Athens. His body was taken to Aigio and specifically to the house of his brother Loukas on October 15, but he was not buried with a church ritual due to the ban imposed by the Kolettis Government. \nHis funeral was finally held in September 1847, immediately after the death of Ioannis Kolettis. At the same time, since the death of Andreas, even though the members of the Londos family continued to be elected deputies of Vostitsa, the substantial influence of the family on the political events of the place stopped. The formal end came a few years later with the death of the last brother of the family, Loukas Londos.\n\n\n== Members ==\nGolfinos Londos, primates & patriarch of the Londos family in Vostitsa\nSotirakis Londos, primates, Moragiannis and son of Golfinos\nLoukas Londos, Member of Parliament for Vostitsa and son of Sotirakis\nKonstantinos Londos, son of Loukas\nAnastasios Londos, rear admiral and son of Constantine\nAnastasios Londos, mayor of Aigio, member of parliament, minister and son of Sotirakis\nAndreas Londos, primates, chieftain, member of parliament, minister and son of Sotirakis\nMaria Londou, wife of Leon Messinezis and daughter of Sotirakis\nMiltiadis Messinezis, raisin merchant and son of Maria\nAristotle Messinezis, raisin merchant and son of Miltiadis\nIoannis Messinezis, son of Miltiadis\nGeorgios Messenezis, merchant, consul of London and son of Miltiadis\nMiltiadis Messinezis, wife of Konstantinos Michalopoulos and daughter of Georgios\nLeon M.

        "content": "Roman roads in Judaea refers to an extensive network of roads built in the Roman period in what was then Judaea (later Syria Palaestina). Remains of some still exist to this day. Many of these roads, including the graded paths, were built by the Jewish population of Judaea, used for pilgrimage to Jerusalem. The Romans used the existing infrastructure for the empire's transportation needs in the province.The purpose of constructing these roads in ancient Rome was to establish an extensive network of thoroughfares, similar to those found throughout the Roman Empire. These roads primarily served the movement of Roman military units and also facilitated public transportation, including mail delivery and travel for central government officials. Additionally, the roads played an economic role in transporting goods and people.\nSome of the roads in the Judaea were paved following the First Jewish–Roman War (66-73), some during the time of Roman emperor Hadrian, and some during the reign of Emperor Marcus Aurelius. The prominent characteristic of these roads was their use of the most convenient route possible from one point to another: a route that avoided natural obstacles, remained passable throughout the year, and had a gentle slope – suitable for pedestrian travel, riding, and vehicle passage. Along the roads, milestones were erected to mark the distance and direction, and there were forts and watchtowers where soldiers guarded the roads.There are modern roads in Israel that utilize the routes of the ancient Roman roads. The most prominent example is the Ashkelon–Kiryat Gat–Hebron road (today Highway 35), which ascends to Hebron along a winding route with minimal incline. However, most of the ancient Roman roads in modern Israel were destroyed by the British, who paved roads over them.From the headquarters of the Legio VI Ferrata, which camped at Legio, a strategic location on the Caesarea–Beit She'an road in the southern foothills of the Jezreel Valley near the modern Megiddo junction, oads were constructed in the year 120 CE to the provincial capital Caesarea, to Beit She'an, to Sepphoris, and to Acre.\n\n\n== The roads ==\n\n\n=== Longitudinal ===\nThe main longitudinal roads were:\n\nAlong the coast, partly on the ancient Via Maris, from Antioch in Syria to Alexandria in Egypt. Both cities were on main trade arteries: Antioch on the trade routes that led from the Mediterranean ports to the area of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, and Alexandria was the main port city of Egypt. The route of the road passed through the cities: Tyre, Acre, Caesarea, Apollonia, Jaffa, Yavne, Ashkelon and Gaza. (Matching to today's Route 4 and Route 2)\nAn eastern road, from Caesarea to Beersheba via Antipatris, Lod (then called Diospolis), Beit Guvrin (called Eleutheropolis), from there it went up to Hebron and went down south to Beersheba.\nAnother road along the national drainage divide (Route 60) that left Tzippori (Diocaesarea), and passed through Megiddo (Legio), Nablus (then Neopolis), Jerusalem, Hebron, Beersheba and continued to Mampsis. Part of this road is well preserved to this day.\nThe road that goes north from Jericho to Nablus - the road goes up north from Jericho in a straight line to ancient Phasaelis (near modern Petza'el) and from there it splits: one route goes up north through the valley of Wadi Ahmar, and goes up through the Alexandrium area to Nablus. The second route, goes up to the Samaria mountains through the southern ridge of Ma'ale Efrayim, passes through the villages of Jadal Bnei Fadal, Aqbara and up to Nablus (route 505 east). A description of a part of the road appears in the British survey: \"The Roman road adjacent to 'Kh. Phasaelis' has been preserved in perfect condition, it includes three rows of stones, the average area of which is a square foot, forming the two extreme rows and the backbone of the road\" - hence the width of the road was 18 feet - 7 meters\nAnother road went from the city of Banias to Nablus through the Jordan Valley, where it split to another route that went up to Jerusalem via Jericho (Route 90). The section of the Beit She'an–Jericho road has been well preserved, maybe due to the fact that fewer people lived in the Jordan Valley. Michael Avi-Yonah believes that the road was paved in the days of Hadrian. To the south and north of Beit She'an milestones belonging to this road were found: one of them is dedicated to Caracalla and others to Marcus Aurelius. On one milestone an inscription was found: \"The 10th mile from Scythopolis\" (Beit She'an).\nThe road leading north from the Negev (in two sections, one from Kadesh and the other from Eilat through Akrabbim), through the ridge of Mount Amasa and the south of Mount Hebron along the back of the mountain and the drainage divide to the city of Hebron (a line of citadels was built along this road to protect the inhabitants of the mountain). Near Kibbutz Har Amasa. On the route of the Israel National Trail, you can see curb stones and cross stones of the Roman road.\nOn the Tabula Peutingeriana, two midway stations are indicated: Coabis, 12 miles from Beit She'an, and Archelais - 12 miles from Coabis. From Coabis to Jericho the distance is 12 miles, so the road which is 36 miles long is divided into three equal sections.\n\n\n=== Latitudinal ===\nIn the north the road from Banias to Tyre.\nThe road crossing Transjordan to Acre, which passed through Jerash and Beit She'an. This road crossed the Lower Galilee, as it ascends from Tiberias in the direction of Sepphoris, through the Toran valley, and from there it continued to Acre. Sections of this road were preserved near Hurvat Romah and near the ruins of Mishkanah, which is mentioned in the Talmud as a central road station between Tiberias and Sepphoris.\nThe road that started at Amman (Philadelphia), passed through the Jordan Valley, Nablus, Sebastia to Caesarea. (Parallel to Highway 57) Part of it runs between Gesher Adam and Nablus along Nahal Tirzah. It is possible that this is the biblical \"way of the sun\" mentioned in the book of Deuteronomy.\nThe road from Jericho to Antipatris, which passed through Aqraba\nThe main road from Jericho to Jaffa is through Jerusalem. The road began beyond the Jordan, in the city of Heshbon.\nThe southern road, from Jerusalem to Ashkelon through Beit Guvrin. On this road, many milestones have were found, as it continues to Gaza as well as connecting to the long road that reaches Beersheba and Mampsis.\n\n\n=== Jaffa-Jerusalem road ===\nThe historic Jaffa-Jerusalem road passed through Lod, and split next to it into two roads: \n\nBethoron road - this road passed through Hadid and Modi'in, and continued along the biblical \"ascent of Bethoron\" between Lower and Upper Bethoron, next to todays Highway 443. This road is mentioned on the Madaba map, and even indicates a road station on the ninth mile from Jerusalem (TO ENNATON), the remains of which are found on site Khirbat el-Lathain near Giv'at Ze'ev. From this station the road turned south towards Jerusalem, and its remains were found in Bir Nabala and Beit Hanina. This road is mentioned by Josephus and Chazal - \"two camels that used to go up the steps of Bethoron and hit each other\". In excavations held in 2023 by archeology chief Haim Cohen, rare remains of the road were uncovered in a total length of 2 kilometers, near the Maccabim checkpoint\nEmmaus road – Israel's route No.1 in its first section runs along the old Emmaus road, with slight deviations, in order to bypass topographical obstacles. Further on the road passes through the Sha'ar HaGai area, a section characterized by an ascent of about 300 meters over three kilometers, up to Horvat Masad, near Neve Ilan. In this section, construction works were carried out. In some cases the obstacles were overcome by creating roads along the mountain side and along ravines. After passing through Abu Ghosh (Kiryat Ye'arim), the road reached Motza, and ascended from there via the route known today as \"Ma'ale Romaim\" towards the area of Har HaMenuchot and the present-day Har Nof neighborhood.\n\n\n== Roads in use today ==\nThere are several modern roads that still follow the Roman routes: the most prominent of them is the Ashkelon - Kiryat Gat - Tarqumiyah- Hebron road, (Route 35) that leads to Hebron on a winding route. On the road from the Valley of Elah - Jerusalem (road 375) and on the old Bethoron road (road 443) the Roman carved steps are still visible.\n\n\n== Surveys and mapping ==\nA partial mapping of the roads can be seen in the Tabula Peutingeriana map which was prepared in the 4th century CE.In the Western Land of Israel survey, conducted on behalf of the Palestine Exploration Fund by Conder and Kitchener in the years 1870 - 1880, the Roman roads were mapped. In the emergency survey conducted in 1968 in the Judea and Samaria region, the roads were located again. After 1975, Adam Zertal pointed out the roads included in the Manasseh Hill Country Survey.\n\n\n== Milestones ==\nA few hundred milestones were found in the Land of Israel, placed at a consistence distances of about 2000 paces (about 1.5 km) from each other. The milestones were usually made of limestone and were 150 on 250 centimeters high.\nTheir function was mainly to provide information about travel distances for road travelers. But also to exalt the ruler who paves the way, whose name was mentioned on them.\n\n\n== Jewish views ==\nThe Babylonian Talmud Tractate Shabbat records a debate among sages regarding the roads, bridges, and other public projects undertaken by the Romans and their impact on the Jewish population:\n\nRabbi Yehuda opened and said: How pleasant are the actions of this nation (i.e. the Romans) as they established marketplaces, bridges, and bathhouses.\nRabbi Yosei was silent.\n\nRabbi Shimon ben Yochai responded and said: Everything that they established, they established only for their own purposes. They established marketplaces to place prostitutes in them; bathhouses to pamper themselves; and bridges to collect taxes from all who pass over them.\nFollowing the publication of Rabbi Shimon's criticism, he had to hide from the Romans for 13 years.\nOn the other hand, in the Midrash there is also a positive tone towards the road system:\n\"A parable of a road that did not have a signs on it and there were people walking and their way, the king said to his people, set a sign on it so that people could see the way\" \n— Yalkot Shimoni Devarim, Pershat Shufitim, 1717\nArchaeologist Israel Roll, who specialized in researching the issue, emphasizes the propaganda role. He demonstrates it this way: when a man traveled from Jerusalem to Beit Gubrin, he sees on his way: \"mathematical precision of 29 groups of millstones, which repeat and remind him of the titles of the great Roman emperors in the past and present - brainwashing - the embodiment of force of Roman power\". This hypothesis is also supported by the fact that millstones were not found in many places prior to the Jewish revolt against the Romans. In Roll's opinion, the rebels against Rome broke up these symbols of Roman emperors as part of their rebellion.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Proyecto Neptuno, sometimes also called Proyecto Arazatí, is a water infrastructure development project in Arazatí, in the departament of San José in Uruguay. A consortium of businesses named \"Aguas de Montevideo\" presented the project in 2020 to create a water treatment plant that draws water from the Río de la Plata near Azaratí, to satisfy the water needs of the Montevideo Metropolitan area.The government water corporation, OSE, accepted the proposal, issuing a request for proposals to build the plant in November 2022 with an estimtaed cost of over 200 million dollars, and quickly was approved with the consortium of businesses.The project is supposed to provide at least 30% of the metropolitan areas water demand from the Río de La Plata. The process involves building a pólder and artificial lake  with 4.0 cubic hectometers  capacity. The project has been an important source of environmental conflict. Critics highlight three major issues with the project. First the environmental impact of the project was never fully evaluated. The scientific community in the country, has actively disagreed with OSE's initial evaluation of the impact of the project and it's potential to address the water shortages And lastly, critics point to the speed and terms of the contract between the consortium of businesses and the state corporation.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Oratorio della Compagnia dei Bianchi or Compagnia della Santissima Annunziata is a Baroque-style, Roman Catholic oratory (chapel) located on Via Roma #9 in the mountain-top town of Fosdinovo,  province of Massa and Carrara in the region Tuscany, Italy. After a fire destroyed the prior oratory, this white marble building was erected in 1648–1653.\n\n\n== History and Description ==\nOriginally the Flagellant, Franciscan-inspired lay confraternity of the Disciplinati (or dei Battuti), now know as dei Bianchi for their white robes had arrived to Fosdinovo at the dawn of the 16th century, patronized by the Marquis Gabriele II Malaspina (1467–1508) and the Franciscan friar Giovanni da Milano. They built their oratory near the center of town, and dedicated it to the Virgin of the Annunciation. The confraternity helped service the rites and burial of its members.\nThe oratory they built had acquired a 14th-century polychrome-painted wooden statue of the Virgin. However, this temple, which had been located closer to the parish church of San Remigio, was destroyed by a fire in 1501, and over a century later, the present oratory was erected under the patronage of Marquis Giacomo (Jacopo) Malaspina. The structure was roofed in 1651, and in 1653, burials from the old oratory site were moved here. the new oratory was decorated by the painter Domenico Utens, son of the Flemish painter Giusto Utens, but his work is now lost. In 1658, a new bell tower was erected under the designs of Mastro Antonio di Giovanni Bello from Bedizzano, a hamlet outside of Carrara. The new oratory was consecrated in 1673 as noted in the coat of arms on the facade.\nIn 1690, the church floor was paved with white Carrara marble tiles, and in 1697, the piazza in front of the church, along via Roma, was similarly paved with a balustrade added the next year. The white marble facade was built in 1666 by Mastro Giulio Pasciuti from Bedizzano, with the work still under the patronage of the then Marquis of Fosdinovo, Pasquale Malaspina. At the time, the cost of the 550 pieces of marble for the facade was 3329 lire.\nThe spacious chapel has a basilica layout, with a main altar hosting the revered wooden icon of the Virgin of the Annunciation, which survived the prior fire. Flanking this altar are statues of Mary's parents: Saints Anne and Joachim. The church also has statues of four prophets: Elias, Jeremiah, David, and Moses. The side altars have dedications to the Holy Family (altar of St Joseph); the Blessed Virgin of the Sorrows (Beata Vergine Addolorata) with a statue (1810) by Giuseppe Casoni; and Archangel Gabriel.  There is also a wooden statue of a Dead Jesus (1646) by Giovanni Francesco Galeotti. The ceiling was frescoed in the 17th-century and underwent restoration after an earthquake in 1920. The choir has engraved oaken seats. The church has a 19th-century organ made by the Serassi family.A survey in 1670 noted the church contained the following altars and altarpieces:\nSt Francis Xavier by Camillo Pucci and commissioned by Giacomo II Malaspina (1610–1663)\nAltar of St Joseph by Bernardino Domenichelli\nAltar of St Charles (now St Antony or Padua) commissioned by Dr Carlo Benedettini\nAltar of St Sebastian commissioned by Sebastiano Milattieri\nAltar of the Holy Relics(now dedicated to the Beata Vergine Addolorata)\nAltar of St Dominic commissioned by the Marchesa Maria Grimaldi-Malaspina\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Based on the study of Natya Shastra text, the common Indian grammar of performing arts and literature is referred to as Marga in the post-Natyashastra period. Deshis are regional forms of performing arts, many of which are developed based on regional taste.\n\n\n== Major Research ==\nMarga Natya is the revival and reconstruction of Bharata (sage)’s tradition of dance, music and acting (natya, geeta and abhinaya) as mentioned in his Natya Shastra.\nResearcher Piyal Bhattacharya has been working at the Natyashastra with the support of the Sangeet Natak Akademi under their scheme of “Safeguarding Intangible Cultural heritage of India”.\n\n\n== The Goal of Marga Tradition ==\nThe Natyashastra and other ancient Hindu texts such as the Yajnavalkya Smriti assert that arts and music are spiritual, with the power to guide one to moksha, through empowering the concentration of mind for the liberation of the Self (soul, Atman)., in strength similar to the knowledge of the Shrutis (Vedas and Upanishads). Various medieval scholars, such as the 12th-century Mitaksara and Apararka, cite Natyashastra and Bharata in linking arts to spirituality, while the text itself asserts that beautiful songs are sacred and performance arts are holy.\nThe goal of Marga Natya, states Natyashastra is ultimately to let the spectator experience his own consciousness, then evaluate and feel the spiritual values innate in him, and rise to a higher level of consciousness. The playwright, the actors and the director (conductor) all aim to transport the spectator to an aesthetic experience within him to eternal universals, to emancipate him from the mundane to creative freedom within.\nThe function of drama and the art of theatre, as envisioned in Natyashastra states Daniel Meyer-Dinkgräfe, is to restore the human potential, man's journey of \"delight at a higher level of consciousness\", and a life that is enlightened.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nPandurang Vaman Kane (1971).

        "content": "Trolleybuses in Debrecen are one of the three systems making up the public transport network serving Debrecen, Hungary. The last one of its kind opened in the country, Debrecen's trolleybus network serves the city since 1985.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the late 1960s, Hungary's transportation politics conception (közlekedéspolitikai koncepció) shifted from rail to rubber wheel transport, both on nationwide and urban levels. Plans were made in the early 1970s to create trolleybus lines in rural cities of Hungary, with the plans originally consisting of Szeged, Debrecen and Pécs as candidants, later switching from Pécs to Miskolc due to insufficient electric network available. Only the former two cities were able to build their trolleybus infrastructure and buy cars from the Soviet Union before the collapse of the Eastern Bloc, with Debrecen opening its first line, number 2 (numbered with the existing tram line number 1 in mind) on July 2, 1985. The sole line started from Segner square, crossed the tram line at the Great Railway Station (Nagyállomás), and traveled on the northeastern main road of the city reaching the site of the Hungarian Roll Bearing Industries (Magyar Gördülőcsapágy Művek, MGM).\nAfter a year in service in 1986, the network expanded two stops from the MGM to the main gate of the Public Cemetery (Köztemető), and a year later with line number 3, that shared the exact same end stations as its original counterpart, but instead of the outer ring of the city, the line crossed through the inner city to reach its destination.\nIn the 1990s, the new city leadership planned to create an east–west corridor connecting two of the largest housing estates in the city, Tócóskert and Dobozi housing estates (Dobozi lakótelep). The latter on the eastern outskirts of the city was connected to line 3's existing infrastructure, and in 1995, the new line 4A started to operate, with the A sign indicating that it's not the full planned length of the line. Although pole-laying operations started at Tócóskert as well, the quickly draining financial situation of the city made the construction works impossible to finish. In 2000, the line 4A was suspended in favor of bus operator Hajdú Volán's new methane fueled green buses, and traffic on it was restored in 2010 only (as line number 4), a year after Hajdú Volán lost its position as Debrecen's local bus operator.\nIn 2005, the city of Debrecen bought new Ganz-Solaris Trollino 12 trolleybuses, with 5 of them (later expanded to 16) being capable of moving without cables as diesel powering was fitted in them. This meant that DKV could create lines that reach outside the infrastructural boundaries. Line 3E was created as Hungary's first trolleybus line with cableless sections, that reached out to the university instead of the cemetery.\nThe 2010s came with little impact on the trolleybus network. In 2011, line 3E was abandoned, and a new line (numbered 3A) opened on a shorter cableless section on Hadházi way (this line is suspended since the 2022 energy price hikes). In 2014, the opening of the tram line number 2 meant that the original trolley line number 2 and 2A was renumbered to 5 and 5A respectively.\n\n\n== Current lines ==\n\n\n== References ==\nBalogh, Tamás Zoltán: TROLImázs; Cívisporta, Debrecen, 2021 (Közlekedési krónikák)\nSzűcs, Ernő Zoltán: A debreceni kötöttpályás közlekedés 120 éve, 1884–2004; DKV Rt., Debrecen, 2004",

In 2021, she became the first woman to be promoted as a freestyler to the Freestyle Master Series (FMS), considered the most important league in Spain in this field.\n\n\n== Career ==\nSocas studied a double degree in Journalism and Audiovisual Communication at the Charles III University of Madrid. She entered the world of freestyle rap in 2017 and also plays several musical instruments, such as the guitar, piano and bass. She is a contributor to the radio programme La Ventana on Cadena SER along with rapper Arkano, as well as an editor at Los 40, among others. Socas has also given rap workshops in several high schools in the Community of Madrid, aimed at teenagers at risk of social exclusion.\nSocas won the second edition of the Madrid Girl Battle held in 2017, where she beat rapper Rasvy in the final. She also reached the quarterfinals of the DH17 Battle and the Pre-National Battle de Royal Rap. The following year, in 2018, she won the Femme Battle 2018, a women's battle-rap tournament, and the Batalla de Azuqueca 2018. That year she also reached the quarterfinals of the Madrid Urban Festival.\nIn 2019, she was one of only two women to participate in the Red Bull \"Batalla de Gallos\", alongside fellow rapper Erika Dos Santos. Socas got through to the competition's semi-finals. In December 2019, she was the only woman to participate in the \"Batallas de Gallos\" at the Otumba exhibition in Mexico City, held by the freestyle organisation Beatle League. Her feminist retort in the battle against Rapder at that event made her a trending topic on Twitter and brought her to the attention of the general public. In 2020, she was chosen to go as a reserve to the Red Bull International Final of that year's Batalla de Gallos.\nIn 2019, she released her songs Ahora me quiero más and Sugarina with Vlack Motor, as well as the track Vuelve with singer-songwriter Fran Mariscal. Socas has been included in the line-up of the Holika Festival 2020. At the end of 2020, she released the single Bambi and in 2021 she released the track Apareciste tú on social media platforms.\nIn January 2021, Socas became the winner of the Gold Battle Barcelona regional. In January 2021, Socas participated in the Spanish National Freestyle League (FMS), becoming the first woman to compete in an FMS. A year earlier, she had turned down the FMS organisation's invitation to join the national league, as she wanted to gain access by competing, a milestone she finally achieved in April 2021. That year, Socas became the Federation Cup champion at the National Final of the Batalla de Maestros in Spain, and went straight through to the FMS final. She was the first woman to do so. As such, she was one of twelve rappers who would participate in the FMS the following season.\nIn 2023, she quit freestyle after receiving hate and sexist attacks on social networks for being a woman and a lesbian. That same year, she presented her first album TFN-MAD, with rap, trap, bachata and rhythm and blues influences, produced by Acción Sánchez of SFDK.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nSara Socas - YouTube channel\n@sarasocass - Instagram",

        "content": "HaTarnegolim (Hebrew:התרנגולים; lit. The Roosters) was an Israeli performing ensemble active in the early 1960s.\n\n\n== History and programs ==\nThe Israeli performing ensemble \"HaTarnegolim\" began its activity in 1960 under the direction and musical guidance of Naomi Polani. It comprised former members of military entertainment troupes. The initiative to establish the band came from soldiers in the military bands who had worked with Polani during their military service and wanted to continue their joint activity.\n\n\n=== The first program ===\nThe first album cover The debut performance of the first program took place in May 1961, featuring Yehoram Gaon, Hanan Goldblatt, Yisrael Poliakov, Amiram Spector, Tuval Patt, Tzvika Gertel, Yossi Tzemach, and Shaike Levi. It consisted of well-known songs from the military bands, and from ensembles such as \"Batzal Yarok\" and \"The Theater Club Quartet\". In addition, the band performed new songs written for them by Sasha Argov and Haim Hefer. The name \"HaTarnegolim\" was coined by Dan Ben-Amotz. Moshe Wilensky was in charge of the musical arrangements while all other creative work, aside from the songwriting itself, was entrusted to Naomi Polani.Polani did not hold open auditions for the public. Being an experienced director from the military bands, she drew talents from those bands, making it easier for her to impose her unique artistic spirit on the discharged soldiers. The first team lasted only for one album.\n\n\n=== The second program ===\nThe second album cover The second program of HaTarnegolim was launched in July 1963. Team A underwent changes and presented a semi-new face towards the premiere and the second record. The second team included for the first time two women - Aliza Rosen and Devorah (Dekovsky) Dotan - as well as Lior Yeynni, Gavri Banai, Shaike Levi, Israel Poliakov, Amiram Spector, Tuval Patt, and Yigal Klaus.All the songs in the program were specially written for the band by Haim Hefer, Dan Almagor, and O. Hillel and were composed by Sasha Argov. The songs added to the previous repertoire in the second program were: \"Everything is Gold\", \"A Lonely Lantern\", \"If You Will\", \"Hora of Love\", \"Boring\", and \"A Soldier's Love Song\" by Hefer, \"The Cats' Song\", \"Just Because\", \"Yossi My Successful Child\" by O. Hillel, and \"When You Say No\" by Almagor.Polani divided the show into different themes and asked the creators to write about those themes. Thus, in the theme \"Neighborhood\", the band combined songs with sketches that presented images from neighborhood life, among them the sketch-song \"The Neighborhood Song\". In the theme \"Colors\", the songs \"The Purple Dress\" and \"Everything is Gold\" were performed.\nHaTarnegolim performed across the country without amplification, as the professional conditions did not allow sound for seven people, and there were no portable microphones available, so the singing could have been lost due to the constant movement on stage.\nThe band performed several times abroad: in Belgium, where the only television program recorded in the Flemish television archive was filmed, in Marseille, Paris, Milan, and Rome, not necessarily in front of a Jewish audience.\n\n\n== Appreciation and importance ==\nHaTarnegolim greatly reflected the collective Israeli experience and became a symbol of the innocence of the early Israeli society. As expressed in the lyrics of Haim Hefer and A. Hillel, who are considered a model of Sabra culture, so too through the compositions of Sasha Argov and the direction of Polani. The young singers, both Eastern and Ashkenazi, graduates of the military bands, groomed and smiling, were a vital symbol for the adults and a symbol of mischief and brilliance for the young. The legacy of the military bands greatly influenced the character of the ensemble. Both the entertainment genre and the folk blend of music, singing, and dance in Israel grew from the legacy of the military bands of the early state.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nHaTarnegolim The First Program (1961)\nHaTarnegolim The Second Program (1963)\nHaTarnegolim – Compilation Album (1989)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHaTarnegolim discography at Discogs",

He established the municipal museum in his home town of Brive-la-Gaillarde and served as its first curator.\nRupin was born in a wealthy family in Brive and went to study law as well as fine arts at Toulouse. He took an interest in botany and anthropology as well. He worked as a receiver in his hometown. He married Joséphine Marie Augustine Mage who came from one of the wealthiest families in 1874 and this led to his decision of resigning from his work in 1874. From 1875 to 1878 he spent time travelling around Corrèze, meeting artists, scientists, and photographing. He also collected botanical specimens and took an interest in excavations at various historic sites. He established a society for science, history and archaeology of Corrèze in 1878 and served as its president from 1881 to 1903. The society also established a Brive museum in 1878 and he became its first curator on 14 June 1884. He worked there until his death and in the 1980s it was moved to Labenche Hotel and renamed as the Ernst Rupin Museum.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPhotographic collections Photos (in French)\nChristmas songs collected by Rupin (in French)\nBiography (in French)\nWorks of Rupin\nL'abbaye et les cloîtres de Moissac (1897)\nLa Corrèze pittoresque.

Clement Corbet, Chancellor of Diocese of Norwich complained Matthew Wren, Bishop of Norwich  (5 December 1635 - 24 April 1638) that “There be too many Adames in that towne, both Ecclesiasticks and Laickes”. Adams emigrated with his wife Ann to New England, settling in Dedham, Massachusetts. Adams settled in Dedham in 1637.\n\n\n== Excommunication ==\nFerdinando Adams fulfilled the role of churchwarden - a lay official of the parish – at St Mary le Tower, Ipswich at a time when William Laud, as newly appointed Archbishop of Canterbury initiated the Laudian reforms in the organisation of church space - for which the churchwarden was responsible. These reforms were contentious amongst puritans, for many of whom Ipswich was their home. Samuel Ward had been town preacher - the most highly paid official of Ipswich Corporation since 1605.\n\n\n== References ==",

Renfrewshire Council have also sought £10,000 per year from the institute to continue storing the Collection.

        "content": "Maria Rita Fernandes (née Pais; born 7 September 1947), known professionally as Rita Rose, is an Indian singer and actress known for her work in Konkani films and tiatr productions. A solo and duet singer, she first gained prominence during the mid-1960s performing in her husband Alfred Rose's tiatrs. She is also best known for her leading role in the Konkani film Boglantt (1975).\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nFernandes was born as Maria Rita Pais on 7 September 1947 in Bombay, which was part of Bombay Presidency in the Dominion of India (now Mumbai, Maharashtra, India). She was born to a company employee, Antonio Rosario Pais, who hailed from Salvador do Mundo, and a homemaker, Maria Angelica de Souza, who hailed from Socorro, Goa, into a Goan Catholic family. Her father was also an artist, a Konkani playwright, and a theatre director who wrote two famous tiatrs, Sosnnikai and Gharachi Chavi (House Key).\n\n\n== Career ==\nFernandes embarked on her artistic journey in the world of tiatr productions through her involvement in Munis Ou Devchar (Human or Demon?), a theatrical production created by her husband, Alfred Rose. Initially, there was a shortage of performers, prompting Rose to request Fernandes' father for her participation. At the time, Fernandes was an unmarried school student. Consequently, Fernandes joined Jessie Dias and Rose himself as part of a trio performance. Throughout her career, Fernandes considered her most memorable role to be in M. Boyer's tiatr, Ekuch Rosto (Only One Way), which was specifically tailored to suit her talents. However, when Boyer sought to record the tiatr production, Fernandes was unable to participate due to her commitment to a show in London. Another actor assumed Fernandes' role in Ekuch Rosto during her absence. Boyer opted not to record the production, as he believed Fernandes, the original cast member, was the most fitting actor for the role. \nOne of the popular songs performed by Fernandes and her husband was \"Bomboichi Birmoti.\" Additionally, Fernandes lent her vocal talents to various audio cassettes for artists such as H. Britton, Titta Pretto, and Hortencio Pereira. Following her marriage to Rose, Fernandes featured in all of his tiatr productions. However, prior to their union, she was unable to participate due to her commitment to schooling. During that time, actors like Jessie Dias and Antonette Mendes took on roles in her husband's productions. As of 2012, Fernandes had acted in several popular tiatrs, including Lakpoti Novro (Millionaire Boyfriend), Director Saib (Director Sir), and Ekuch Rosto (Only One Way). Alongside her acting career, Fernandes also showcased her singing abilities in tiatrs such as Angounnechi Vokol, Somestancho Kumpar, and Dharun Vhoddil.\nAuthor Wilson Mazarello writes, \"Fernandes has a very pleasant voice and can sing solos as well as duets with equal ease\". Her vocal talents received recognition for their quality, enabling her to perform both solo and duet pieces. Collaborating with her husband, Alfred Rose, Fernandes gained international fame, particularly among the Goan diaspora. Her contributions to the world of Konkani theater, working alongside directors like M. Boyer, Prem Kumar, C. Alvares, and her husband Rose, have showcased her versatility as an actress. In addition to her theater performances, Fernandes achieved acclaim as the leading actress in the Konkani film Boglantt (1975), which resonated with the Goan community. Her talent has taken her on several tours, across the United Kingdom, Canada, the Middle East, and other locations. Fernandes has also established a presence in the realm of broadcast media. Since 1995, she has been a regular singer on All India Radio and Doordarshan. Recognizing her contributions to the cultural heritage of Goa, Fernandes granted permission to Isidore Dantas, the former Assistant General Manager of the State Bank of India, to write a book about her husband, Alfred Rose. Displaying her meticulous nature, Fernandes systematically documented her experiences, including handbills, photographs, and cassettes, which she donated to the Goa Central Library in Panjim. In the 2019 book Alfred Rose: The King of Melody by Dantas, Fernandes authored a section spanning four pages following an extensive period of over two years dedicated to research and compilation for the publication.\nIn May 2016, Fernandes and her son Englebert delivered a live tribute to Alfred Rose during the Goa Food and Music Festival organized by the Herald Group. The festival, held over three days at the Campal Parade Ground in Panjim, showcased a diverse range of performances by artists such as Anselm Fernandes, Frazier, Aleta Gonsalves, Pearl, True Blue, Media Waves, Divya Naik, Vito, A-Unit, and Ciloni Da Costa.\nOn 17 April 2017, Fernandes actively participated in a commemorative event held at the DMK auditorium in the Kala Academy, Panjim, celebrating the 125th anniversary of tiatr, a form of Konkani theater. Konkani tiatrists, including Antonette Mendes, Betty Naz, Titta Pretto, Joe Rose, Ben Evangelisto, Roseferns, Prince Jacob, Comedian Agostinho, Comedian Selvy, Comedian Domnic, Luis Bachchan, Mario Menezes, Alfy de Divar, and others, also contributed to the presentation.\nOn 15 August 2020, Fernandes, accompanied by her children Alria and Engelbert, captivated audiences with an online concert hosted by Rockin' Marmalade. The concert named Goan Global 2 was first showcased on their official Facebook page, marking a significant moment as Fernandes and her children reunited on stage after a decade. Their performance highlighted the songs of Alfred Rose. During the concert, Tatum D'Souza, the daughter of Bab Peter and Ophelia Cabral, also made an appearance and captivated the audience with performances of their well-known songs.\nIn August 2022, Fernandes received recognition for her and her husband's contributions to the realms of music and literature during a literary program. The event coincided with the release of the book The Rose Blooms, written by Glenis Mendonça, a lecturer at Carmel College, Nuvem. Fernandes, together with her daughter Alria and son Engelbert, entertained the audience with their performance. The program also commemorated the 90th birth anniversary of the Konkani singer Alfred Rose.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nFernandes had an encounter with Alfred Rose, her future husband, during her involvement in her father's tiatr production titled Gharachi Chavi (House Key). A teenager Fernandes found herself sharing the stage with Rose, who played opposite her. During this time, she had the opportunity to handle Rose's wand and his Panama hat, an accessory he utilized during his singing performances. Amidst the preparations for their show, Fernandes unintentionally crumpled Rose's imported Panama hat from London when she sat on it, marking their initial introduction. This incident caused consternation for Fernandes's mother, who was deeply concerned about her daughter's behavior. \nIn an attempt to make amends, she offered to compensate Rose for the damaged hat. However, Rose responded with equanimity, smiling and accepting the situation without complaint. On the occasion of Fernandes's 18th birthday, she and Alfred Rose, who was 32 years old at the time, tied the knot on 7 September 1965, at the Holy Name Cathedral in Colaba, Bombay. The union resulted in the birth of three children: two sons named Schubert and Engelbert, and a daughter named Alria. All three children actively participate in the Konkani stage, carrying on their parents' artistic legacy.\nFollowing her marriage, Fernandes acknowledges that her husband held a strong affection for the Konkani language and even took the initiative to teach it to their family members. However, Fernandes primarily conversed with her children in English to ensure their familiarity with both languages. In regards to Glenis Mendonça, the author of The Rose Blooms, Fernandes regards her as a \"prolific writer\". Collaboratively, Mendonça and Fernandes authored a book centered around the life and accomplishments of Alfred Rose. Fernandes further emphasizes that her husband did not receive recognition during his lifetime, emphasizing the importance of appreciating individuals while they are still alive. On 21 October 2003, Fernandes's husband died in Mahim, Mumbai at the age of 71. As of 2012, Fernandes and her family continue to reside in Mahim.\n\n\n=== The lost suitcase incident ===\nIn 1987, a musical event took place at Shanmukhananda Hall in Sion, Bombay. The show featured popular English and Konkani bands, including Fernandes' band. Fernandes and her husband, Alfred Rose, had intended to attend the show with their car, carrying a suitcase containing their belongings. Meanwhile, their friends and younger son, Schubert, were en route to the venue in a taxi with another suitcase belonging to Fernandes. However, upon their arrival at the hall, they realized that they had inadvertently left the second suitcase in the taxi. Realizing the predicament, Rose instructed their photographer to take Fernandes back home in a taxi, where she could retrieve new clothes, wigs, and other necessary items. Fernandes promptly took the taxi and managed to make it to the venue. However, the lost suitcase contained only musical notes, specifically solfas, which were crucial for their performance. Without these notes, it would have been impossible for them to participate in the musical show.\nNot wanting to disappoint the audience, Fernandes' husband made an announcement, explaining the situation to the crowd. Despite being already 30 minutes late, the audience remained patient and understanding. In the meantime, Rose contacted Babush, who had written all the songs as per Alfred's instructions. With Babush's assistance, they managed to salvage the show, and it turned out to be a success. Following the performance, Fernandes, her family, husband, and friends celebrated at their residence. To their surprise, the taxi driver arrived at their home with the lost suitcase. In gratitude for his honesty, Fernandes and her family wished to reward the driver with some money. However, the taxi driver declined their offer, displaying his integrity and refusing any form of compensation.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRita Rose at IMDb",

It lacks depth and pacing.\" Satya Pilagam of ABP Nadu rated this film 1.75 stars out of 5 stars and noted \"Viraj Ashwin, Ruhani Sharma's story is well written. As good as there is.

        "content": "On 15 April 2024, at approximately 7:15 pm local time, an unnamed person perpetrated a knife attack at Christ The Good Shepherd Church in Wakeley, a suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. During a live-streamed sermon, the attacker walked up to the pulpit, first stabbing Bishop Mari Emmanuel and Father Isaac Royel before injuring another churchgoer. While no one was killed, this attack was the second stabbing incident to have taken place in Sydney in three days, following the deadly mass stabbing at Bondi Junction.\nThe New South Wales Police Force have arrested a 16 year old male over the attack. They have classified the stabbing as a terrorist attack, but have not revealed the name of the accused, who stated in Arabic after the assault, \"if they didn’t insult my prophet, I wouldn’t have come here.\" Wakeley, where Christ The Good Shepherd Church is located, is home to many Christians belonging to the Assyrian diaspora, including Emmanuel himself.\n\n\n== Background ==\nWakeley hosts the highest number of Assyrian Christians of any suburban neighbourhood in Australia, many of whom are refugees from Iraq and Syria.\nOriginally from Iraq, Mar Mari Emmanuel was ordained as a bishop in 2011 but later broke away from the Ancient Church of the East due to theological differences and established his own Christian denomination. \nEmmanuel criticised liberal Christian denominations, as well as other religions such as Judaism and Islam in his sermons. He was a prominent critic of lockdowns and vaccine mandates during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. He espoused conservative stances on issues such as LGBT rights and sexuality. He had also voiced solidarity with the Palestinians during the Israel–Hamas war, and had called for peace. Clips from his live-streamed sermons have been re-uploaded on social media and have amassed millions of views in which he gained an international following. According to Emmanuel himself, just about one month before the stabbing, there were threats spread on TikTok, stating \"the Bishop has two weeks to live\".\n\n\n== Stabbing ==\nThe stabbings took place around 7:10 pm in the suburb of Wakeley, 34 kilometres (21 mi) south-west of the Sydney CBD. An assailant wearing a black jumper entered Christ The Good Shepherd Church located on Welcome Street, shouted \"Allahu Akbar\", and attacked multiple people with a knife, starting with the bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel, whom he approached at the pulpit and then stabbed multiple times in the head and upper body. The weapon was allegedly a flick knife, which is banned in Australia, but the attacker had not opened it fully before using the weapon. \nIn a video released by one of the churchgoers, the teenager can be heard speaking Arabic, saying \"if he didn't insult my prophet, I wouldn't have come here\". The event occurred during a live-stream of Emmanuel preaching whom the congregation gathered around after he was stabbed. In response to the attack, 11 ambulances were sent to the church.\n\n\n== Casualties ==\nThree people suffered non-life-threatening injuries in the initial attack: bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel, 53, who was taken to Liverpool Hospital in a serious condition, which was placed under a partial lockdown. Two men were treated for lacerations suffered in restraining the attacker, including Father Isaac Royel, 39, and another man in his 60s.\nThe alleged assailant was also treated for injuries to his hand, which were not intentionally caused by parishioners, but by the ensuing tussle. Rumours had promptly spread through the crowd outside the church and hospital and on social media that vigilantes had \"chopped off\" some of his fingers, which was untrue.\n\n\n== Suspect ==\nA suspect was apprehended and taken into custody. The suspect, while not as yet named, was first reported to be 15 years old, later revised to 16. He was known to police but was not on a terrorism watchlist. He had previously been convicted in January 2024 for various weapons offences as well as stalking, intimidation and damaging property, but was later released on a good behaviour bond by a court in Sydney. \nFootage showed the alleged attacker smiling while held to the floor by a police officer and after being apprehended by churchgoers. The assailant's identity was withheld due to juvenile laws in New South Wales. His father said that his son showed no signs of radicalisation before the attack. According to a Muslim community leader who spoke with the suspect's family, the suspect expressed remorse to his mother and apologised for his actions. He added that the suspect's relatives, who transferred residence for fear of retaliation, condemned the attack, while the suspect's mother said that he had been suffering from anger management issues and had sought treatment from psychiatrists.\n\n\n== Investigation ==\nPolice stated that the stabbing that had \"elements that are satisfied in terms of religious motivated extremism.\" At a press conference in Canberra, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) Director General Mike Burgess said that the intelligence agency was aware of alleged references made by the assailant pertaining to the bishop having insulted the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Commissioner of the New South Wales Police Force Karen Webb said police had spoken with the boy’s parents, but she could not provide specific details of that conversation.\nA counter-terrorism task force was set up to investigate the attack, particularly on whether other persons were involved. The task force consisted of officials from the New South Wales Police Force, the Australian Federal Police, and ASIO.\nOn 18 April, the 16-year-old suspect was charged with committing a terrorist act. He was refused bail and appeared before a bedside juvenile court hearing on 19 April. The magistrate recommended that he undergo a mental health assessment and will be remanded at a children’s detention center upon being released from hospital pending his next court hearing on 14 June.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\nMore than 100 police personnel were deployed to the church location to confront crowds estimated to be up to 2,000 people gathered outside the church and the hospital, where they believed the alleged attacker was being held. The crowd screamed \"Bring him out!\" as police and paramedics remained inside the church with the alleged offender for a few hours. The crowds clashed with police and attacked police vehicles. Riot police used pepper spray on the tumultuous crowd outside the church. A police helicopter encircled the area, broadcasting the message: \"All persons, please vacate the area immediately.\" \nA total of 30 people were injured during the riots, of which seven were hospitalised. Fifty-one police officers were also injured. Three police officers were taken to hospital for their injuries but released the following day.\nTwenty police vehicles were damaged, while ten were rendered unusable. Six paramedics were trapped inside the church for more than three hours due to the violence. Several houses were also broken into. Police operations ended before 1:00 am on 16 April. NSW Police Commissioner Karen Webb vowed that the violent rioters involved will be \"prosecuted\" and also stated that many rioters were not associated with the church in the first place. She also announced the formation of Strike Force Dribs to respond to the riot, as well as the implementation of additional patrols to help \"community harmonisation.\" \nThe first arrest in relation to the riots was made on 17 April, when a 19-year-old man from Doonside was charged with riot, affray and destroying or damaging property during public disorder. Police said they were seeking the identities of around 50 people from the crowd. A second arrest was made on 20 April, a ﻿45-year-old man from Fairfield Heights. Webb stressed that the rioters were not related to the church's parish, and only revolted \"as an excuse\" to escalate problems for police. ﻿\nIn his first statements since the attack released on 18 April, Mar Mari Emmanuel said that he was \"recovering quickly\" and said that he had forgiven the attacker. He also urged his congregation to cooperate with authorities and not to engage in retaliatory acts. On 17 April, Father Isaac Royel was discharged from hospital.\nMuslim community leaders expressed fears that the decision by the authorities to label the incident as a \"terrorist attack\" may encourage Islamophobia, and questioned whether that label was being applied consistently. Police were deployed in mosques across Sydney after reports that text messages were being circulated calling for the Assyrian Christian community to \"retaliate\" against Muslims. The Lakemba Mosque, the largest in the country, also hired additional private security after receiving fire bomb threats on 15 April. The Islamophobia Register of Australia recorded 46 reports of hate-related incidents following the Wakeley stabbing and the earlier stabbing incident in Bondi Junction, which it partially attributed to misinformation released by Islamophobic figures.\n\n\n== Reactions ==\nThe Christ the Good Shepherd's administration requested prayers for the victims of the attack as well as the alleged perpetrator in accordance with Bishop Emmanuel and Father Isaac's wishes.  It also called on those that had gathered at the church to \"leave in peace\". The Assyrian Church of the East also said that its \"hearts and prayers are with the victims\" and hoped for their \"comfort and speedy recovery\".\nNoting that Bishop Emmanuel prayed for his attacker after the attack, Councillor Steve Christou of the Cumberland City Council stated \"It just shows the remarkable courage of a man and the forgiveness he has within him to pray for his alleged attacker.\"\nThe attack was condemned by other religious leaders, groups and organisations including the Australian National Imams Council and the Executive Council of Australian Jewry following a meeting with New South Wales Premier Chris Minns, who also expressed sympathies with victims and emergency services and called for calm. \nFrank Carbone, the mayor of the City of Fairfield, said the attack and subsequent riot was \"a very emotional situation\", adding that the community was \"very upset\" over the incident.\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese condemned the attack, saying that there was no place for \"violence in our community\" and \"violent extremism\". He also called on Australians to \"unite, not divide, as a community, and as a country.\" Mike Burgess, the Director-General of Security of ASIO, declared that Australia's terror threat level was \"possible\", which meant extremism was an existing danger. The Australian government ordered Meta Platforms and X to remove offensive content relating to the attack within 24 hours or face fines. In response, X said it would not do so and would go to court over the issue, with its owner Elon Musk accusing the government of censorship.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of mass stabbing incidents (2020–present)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Hermann Rudolf Schäfer (April 6, 1892, in Remscheid – May 26, 1966, in Bad Godesberg) was a German politician (DDP, FDP, Free People's Party, DP). From 1953 to 1956, he was Federal Minister for Special Tasks.\n\n\n== Education and career ==\nAfter graduating from high school in 1910, Schäfer, the son of a factory owner, studied political science, economics, and newspaper studies in Leipzig and Heidelberg, which he completed in 1914 with a doctorate. phil. and a dissertation on the subject of “The Press of the German Labor Movement.\" During his studies, he became a member of the SBV Nordalbingia Leipzig in 1910 and the Schwarzburgbund association Hercynia Heidelberg in 1911.He worked as an editor for a short time and then took part in the First World War as a soldier from 1914 to 1918. After his release from captivity in 1920, he served as a managing director until 1934, and later as executive board member of the Association of Senior Executives (Vela). From 1935 he worked as an employee at the Hanseatic Replacement Fund from 1826; in 1946 he became its director. During the Second World War he was a captain in the reserve at the General Plenipotentiary for Technical Communications (GBN) in Berlin.\n\n\n== Political party ==\nBefore the First World War, Schäfer had already become a member of the left-liberal Progressive People's Party. Released from captivity, he joined the German Democratic Party (DDP) in 1920, where he was a member of the Reich Executive Committee from 1925 to 1932.\nAfter the end of the Second World War, Schäfer took part in the founding of the Free Democrats Party in September 1945, which would become the Hamburg regional branch of the FDP. In 1946, he was elected deputy chairman of the FDP regional association in Hamburg. In 1947, he was elected deputy chairman of the FDP in the British-occupied zone. From 1950 to 1955, he was deputy federal chairman of the FDP. He was a member of the FDP federal executive board from 1949 to 1955. Although he was considered an exponent of the left wing, he left the FDP on February 23, 1956, with the so-called Euler Group, which was otherwise considered to be part of the right wing of the party, and became a co-founder of the FVP, which joined forces after just one year when the DP united. In 1961, he returned to the FDP.\n\n\n== MP ==\nSchäfer was a member of the Cologne city council from 1925 to 1932 and was parliamentary group leader of the DDP from 1929. From 1947 on, he was a member of the Zone Advisory Council for the British Occupation Zone and, in 1948/49, of the Parliamentary Council and its vice president. In this capacity, he drafted the Basic Law on May 23, 1949, together with Konrad Adenauer and Adolph Schönfelder. The constitutional document therefore bears his signature.\n\nSchäfer headed the Parliamentary Council commission, which was supposed to examine which of the four candidate cities (Bonn, Frankfurt am Main, Kassel, or Stuttgart) should receive the provisional headquarters of the federal bodies. The Commission suggested that the Parliamentary Council choose between Bonn and Frankfurt; Kassel and Stuttgart were found unsuitable.\nFrom 1949 to 1957, Schäfer was a member of the German Bundestag and its vice president from 1949 to 1953. In addition, Schäfer was also a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe from 1950 to 1953. He was also chairman of the FDP parliamentary group from September 12, 1949, to January 10, 1951, and from May 6, 1952, to 1953, and in the meantime, its deputy chairman.\nOn February 23, 1956, Schäfer left the FDP parliamentary group together with the so-called “Euler Group” and initially served as a non-attached member of the Bundestag.

He was also called Doctor Spaniard (Polish: Doktor Hiszpan) or in Latin Hispanus Hebraeus.The date of Izaak's birth is not known, but he was certainly born in Jerusalem as the son of Abraham. He then found himself at the court of the Sultan Uzun Hasan, where he served as court physician. In 1472, the Sultan sent him on a diplomatic mission to Europe. Izaak visited the courts of Moldavian hospodar Stephen the Great, King of Hungary Matthias Corvinus and King of Poland Casimir IV Jagiellon. He then settled in Poland, although it is not known exactly in what year. By 1492 he was court physician to Casimir IV Jagiellon. In 1496-1497 he stayed in Lviv, where he treated the archbishop of Lviv, Andrzej Róża Boryszewski.After the death of Casimir IV, he remained at the court as physician to his sons one by one ascending the throne: John I Albert (1492–1501), Alexander I Jagiellon (1501–1506) and Sigismund I the Old. For his service he received numerous privileges, already John I Albert excluded him and his family and household from the jurisdiction of royal officials and subjected them to his own jurisdiction, he also exempted him from taxes paid by other Jews. Alexander I granted him an annual salary of 12 Polish grzywnas per year, which he later raised to 100 florins, and granted him the right to live in Kazimierz near Kraków. After his death, Sigismund I granted his widow Berszewa the same privileges.Izaak also performed diplomatic functions for Polish rulers. In 1501-1502 he carried out a diplomatic mission to the Khan of the Crimean Khanate. And in 1503–1504 to the Khan of the Great Horde.\n\n\n== References ==",

She was the second person from Oman and the first Omani woman to climb Mount Everest.\n\n\n== Life ==\nAl Harthy was born in about 1978. She went to Rustaq College of Education and she has a degree in geography. She worked for four years as a geography teacher before she became an Omani civil servant who works for Oman's Ministry of Education.\nIn 2017 she set herself the goal of climbing the world's highest peak. She had met Khalid al-Siyabi who was the only Omani person at the time to have climbed Everest which he did in 2010. He came to the ministry where she was director of citizenship and she was inspired. She went to the gym each week and she started running and climbing mountains in Oman. In 2018 she took part in the 130km Ultra-Trail Mont Blanc. She did the ultra-marathon in Oman but had to retire before she completed 100 km. She was training under the guidance of her mentor, Khalid al-Siyabi, and for a long time her ambition to climb Everest was a secret. She told her own family of the plan just two months before she set out.She was the second person from Oman and the first Omani woman to climb Mount Everest in 2019. This was a year that the queues on the mountain to climb it became a news story and the year that her mentor died. She was part of a team which included Mona Shahab of Saudi Arabia and the Lebanonese climbers Joyce Azzam and Nelly Attar. She got to the summit on the anniversary of her mentor's ascent and she left his name at the top. The achievement was described as being by an \"all-woman Arab team\" and it was filmed by the Canadian climber Elia Saikaly.She has since become the first woman from the Arab world to climb the Nepalese summit of Ama Dablam. This was a peak that had defeated her before, when she was training for her Everest ascent.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ernst Cohn-Wiener (1882–1941) was a German historian of Islamic art. Born in the city of Tilsit, he studied the history of art, archaeology, and philosophy in Berlin and Heidelberg from 1902 to 1906. He received his PhD from Heidelberg in 1907. In the 1920s his interest turned to Islamic art history and he resolved to explore the monuments of Central Asia, a little-known field at the time. After expeditions in 1924 and 1925, he published Turan: Islamische Baukunst in Mittelasien. In 1933 Cohn-Wiener lost his position due to the anti-Semitic policies of the Nazis and he emigrated with his wife to India where he was employed by the Maharaja of Baroda. In 1939 emigrated to the USA where he died in 1941.\nCohn-Wiener's photographic archive was acquired by the British Museum in 1998 from the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London.\nThe archive consists of 324 film negatives and 567 glass negatives.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nARCHNET",

        "content": "Deborah Currie (born 1974) is a journalist from Findern. A daughter of Edwina Currie, she fronted a cover version of Limmie & Family Cookin''s \"You Can Do Magic\" produced by Mike Stock and Matt Aitken and sung by Sinitta, which charted at No. 86 on the UK singles chart, and which she later revealed was part of an investigation into chart-rigging by The Cook Report.\n\n\n== Early and personal life ==\nDeborah Currie was born in 1974.: Preface  Her parents, Ray and Edwina Currie, met while both were accountants at Arthur Andersen; both Ray and his brother Brian became senior executives at the firm, while Edwina went on to serve as Conservative MP for South Derbyshire from 1983, spending two years as a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health from 1986 before resigning after the 1988 salmonella-in-eggs controversy. Ray and Edwina married in 1972, separated in 1994, and divorced in 2001. Debbie has a younger sister, and they grew up between the Tower House, their family home in Findern near Derby, a flat in Victoria, London, and Les Tuileries in Mouliherne near the Loire Valley.: Preface  She attended Denstone College, where she was reprimanded for smoking aged 13, and had to retake all of her A-levels after being accused of cheating; she graduated with a C and two Ds, and read English and Communication Arts at the University of Huddersfield, where she worked as a lollipop lady and at George Hotel, Huddersfield. She used an October 2009 article in the Daily Mail to announce that she had become a single mother by choice after a drunken one-night-stand aged thirty, and encouraged others to have their children before finding a partner.\n\n\n== \"You Can Do Magic\" ==\nIn 1997, ostensibly after giving up a planned career in the police force, Currie fronted a cover version of Limmie & Family Cookin''s \"You Can Do Magic\", with Sinitta providing the track's vocals. The single was produced by Matt Aitken and Mike Stock, the latter of whom had produced Tatjana Šimić's \"Santa Maria\" two years earlier, which had been bought into the charts. To promote the single, she toured Scotland with pop band The Mojams, claimed that she had enjoyed a four-in-a-bed orgy and lost her virginity at fifteen, told Edwina about the latter in Tesco, and posed with fried eggs on her breasts; Edwina used an interview after her 1997 United Kingdom general election defeat to promote the song. The song was released on 19 May 1997 on Barry Tomes' Gotham Records and was pulled three days later; credited to \"Mojams featuring Debbie Currie\", the song charted at No. 86 on the UK singles chart. Later that month, it was revealed that the single had been part of an elaborate ruse by Roger Cook's The Cook Report, which had been staged to investigate the practice of chart-rigging, although rumours had swirled for two months before that, including that Debbie had been selected for the ruse due to her tabloid history; it later transpired that Debbie was in fact a trainee journalist for that programme's channel Carlton Television, and that the track had been withdrawn because the programme's budget had run out. She later moved to the Peak District and took a job as a gas-meter fitter.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Hakkari Cilo-Sat Mountains National Park (Turkish: Hakkâri Cilo ve Sat Dağları Milli Parkı, established on 26 September 2020, is the 45th national park in Turkey. It is located in Yüksekova district within Hakkari Province, Southeastern Anatolia.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Mount Cilo and Mount Sat, also known as Buzul and İkiyaka Mountains respectively, are a mountain range located in Yüksekova district, east of Hakkari city, southeastern Turkey. The mountain range is 50 km (31 mi) far from Yüksekova town.\n\n\n== National park ==\n\nStretching over an area of 27,500 ha (68,000 acres), the mountain range and its surroundings were declared as the 45th national park in Turkey on  26 September 2020. The national park is administrated by the Directoriate-General of Nature Protection and National Parks  at the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.\nThe national park area is around 60 km (37 mi) long as the crow flies in the northwest-southeast direction. It features high mountain belts, plateaus, deep valleys, streams, waterfalls, glaciers, many large and small glacial lakes as well as many churches and rock paintings. The İnci Stream passes throughwitth Uludoruk reaching 4,125 m (13,533 ft). the valley between the Cilo and Sat Mountains.\nMount Cilo is the second highest mountain in Turkey with its peak Uludoruk reaching 4,135 m (13,566 ft). Other important peaks of the mountain range are Suppa Durek with 4,060 m (13,320 ft), Köşedireği Mountain with 3,700 m (12,100 ft), Kisara Mountain with 3,500 m (11,500 ft), Maunseli Sivrisi with 3,850 m (12,630 ft) and Gelyona Hill with 3,650 m (11,980 ft). In 1931, the mounyaineers Ludwig Sperlich and his friend Ludwig Krenek made the first climb to Uludoruk peak.\nThe mountain range has a very steep topography due to abrasion, cracking and erosion caused by glacial activities and freezing-thawing effect. Deep glacial valleys, moraines and lakes in the area show the deep effects of glaciation that started two million years ago. These glaciers are still in the process of melting, starting from twenty thousand years ago until today. It is claimed that this melting process may develop under the influence of global and regional climate changes, and bring about significant changes in the ecosystem of the region. In August 2023, it was observed that about 3,000 m (9,800 ft) of the glacier broke apart in the Cennet-Cehennem region of the mountain. \n\n\n=== Flora ===\nThe upper parts of the mountains are covered with high alpine meadows, where stony areas are dense. These areas are home to many narrow-ranging and endangered plant species. In the upper reaches, there are permanent glaciers and glacial lakes, especially concentrated in the Sat Mountains. Remnant oak forests and walnut communities lie in the low south-facing valleys. \nCilo Mountains are one of the most important areas in Turkey and the world in terms of plants, and meet the criteria for Key Biodiversity Area. It is habitat for 53 plant taxa, including six endemic plants, among them are the endemic plant species Cephalaria hakkiarica and Cirsium hakkaricum.\n\n\n=== Fauna ===\nThe mountainous area is rich in animal species diversity. It is known that the Lake Urmia newt (Neurergus crocatus), which is  close to extinction worldwide, the wild goat (Capra aegagrus), the narrow-distributed Persian mol (Talpa davidiana), as well as eleven butterfly taxa, including four endemic species. The polyeyed Hakkari freckle (Polyommatus dezinus) find habitat only here. Bird species known to breed in the area include golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), Eurasian griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus) and Caspian snowcock (Tetraogallus caspius).\n\n\n=== Activities ===\nAlthough Cilo and Sat mountains are with the most landscape beauty, they can be used for nature sports only in a limited way due to security reasons. Injuries or deadly accidents can occur when glaciers break apart and create crevasse in the area.\nMergan Plateau and Avaspi Glaciers are places of interest. Mountaineering for Uludoruk summit is performed in the summer season by experienced mountaineers under a guide starting from the Serpil Plateau at the foot of Cilo Mountain.\n\n\n=== Access ===\nThe 2,400 m (7,900 ft)-high Mergan Plateau, which is in the valley, where the Uludoruk glacier of the Cilo Mountains is located, is 37 km (23 mi) far from Hakkari.\nCilo Mountain can be reached also from the south via Yüksekova-\nDağlıca village road, but this road is not used for security reasons. Transportation to Sat Mountain is via Yüksekova, 23 km (14 mi) by motor vehicle and 8 km (5.0 mi) by foot or horse back riding.\n\n\n== References ==",

It was one of a series of influential boooks about bushrangers by Clune.The Bulletin said \"It really is time these bushranging histories were done soberly, reliably,in acceptable prose and with a convincing presentation of character. But in the meantime Captain Melville   for its information about a little-known bushranger and the dark deeds of the convict-system, cannot fail to be interesting.\"Walkabout said \"in what purports to be a documentary treatment of the story, McCallum sometimes gets completely lost in the depths of Mr Clunes’s historical and  opinionated padding. Indeed, his kinky personality becomes so blurred, at times, that, at one stage at least, he reappears almost as a misunderstood and mistreated victim of sadistic punishment.\"The Bristol Post thought the book made Melville \"a very human and not unsympathetic figure.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

It includes the military events, individuals, and topics involving the People's Republic of China from the Chinese Civil War to the present. The events are outlined chronologically with topical subsections.\n\n\n== Overview articles ==\nHistory\n\nHistory of the People's Republic of ChinaHistory of the People's Republic of China (1949–1976)\nHistory of the People's Republic of China (1976–1989)\nHistory of the People's Republic of China (1989–2002)\nHistory of the People's Republic of China (2002–present)Military branches and services\n\nPeople's Liberation Army\nPeople's Liberation Army Ground Force\nPeople's Liberation Army Navy\nPeople's Liberation Army Air Force\nPeople's Liberation Army Rocket Force\nPeople's Armed Police\n\n\n== Major conflicts ==\nChinese Civil War was fought between the Kuomintang-led government of the Republic of China and the forces of the Chinese Communist Party, with armed conflict continuing intermittently from 1 August 1927 until 7 December 1949, resulting in a Communist victory and control of mainland China in the Chinese Communist Revolution.Main article: Outline of the Chinese Civil WarKorean War was fought between North Korea and South Korea from 1950 to 1953. It began on 25 June 1950 when North Korea invaded South Korea and ceased after an armistice on 27 July 1953. The north was supported by China and the Soviet Union while the south was supported by United Nations (UN) forces led by the United States.\nVietnam War was a conflict in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia from 1 November 1955 to the fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975. It was the second of the Indochina Wars and was a major conflict of the Cold War. While the war was officially fought between North Vietnam and South Vietnam, the north was supported by the Soviet Union, China, and other communist states, while the south was supported by the United States and other anti-communist allies. The conflict spilled over into neighboring states, exacerbating the Laotian Civil War and the Cambodian Civil War.\n\n\n== Short conflicts and events ==\nBattle of Chamdo (or Qamdo; Chinese: 昌都战役) was a military campaign by the People's Republic of China from 6 to 24 October 1950 to take the Chamdo Region from a de facto independent Tibetan state. The campaign resulted in the capture of Chamdo and the annexation of Tibet by the People's Republic of China.\nFirst Taiwan Strait Crisis (also known as the Formosa Crisis, the 1954–1955 Taiwan Strait Crisis, the Offshore Islands Crisis, the Quemoy-Matsu Crisis, and the 1955 Taiwan Strait Crisis) was a brief armed conflict between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China (ROC) in Taiwan. The conflict focused on several groups of islands in the Taiwan Strait that were held by the ROC but were located only a few miles from mainland China.\nSecond Taiwan Strait Crisis (also called the 1958 Taiwan Strait Crisis), was a conflict between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China (ROC). During the conflict, the PRC shelled the islands of Kinmen (Quemoy) and the Matsu Islands along the east coast of mainland China (in the Taiwan Strait) in an attempt to take control of Taiwan from the Chinese Nationalist Party, also known as the Kuomintang (KMT), and to probe the extent of the United States' defense of Taiwan's territory. A naval battle also took place around Dongding Island when the ROC Navy repelled an attempted amphibious landing by the PRC Navy.\n1960–61 campaign at the China–Burma border ((simplified Chinese: 中缅边境作战; traditional Chinese: 中緬邊境作戰) was a series of battles fought along the China–Burma border after the Chinese Civil War, with the communist People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Union of Burma on one side and the nationalist forces of the Republic of China (ROC) on the other. The government of the PRC refers to the campaign as the China–Burma border demarcation and security operation (simplified Chinese: 中缅边境勘界警卫作战; traditional Chinese: 中緬邊境勘界警衛作戰).\nSino-Indian War, also known as the China–India War or the Indo–China War, was an armed conflict between China and India that took place from October to November 1962. It was a military escalation of the Sino–Indian border dispute. Fighting occurred along India's border with China, in India's North-East Frontier Agency east of Bhutan, and in Aksai Chin west of Nepal.\nSino-Soviet border conflict was a seven-month undeclared military conflict between the Soviet Union and China in 1969, following the Sino-Soviet split. The most serious border clash, which brought the world's two largest communist states to the brink of war, occurred near Damansky (Zhenbao) Island on the Ussuri (Wusuli) River in Manchuria. Clashes also took place in Xinjiang.\nBattle of the Paracel Islands (Chinese: 西沙海战, Pinyin: Xisha Haizhan；Vietnamese: Hải chiến Hoàng Sa) was a military engagement between the naval forces of China and South Vietnam in the Paracel Islands on January 19, 1974. The battle was an attempt by the South Vietnamese navy to expel the Chinese navy from the vicinity. The confrontation took place towards the end of the Vietnam War.\nSino-Vietnamese War, also known by other names), was a brief conflict that occurred in early 1979 between China and Vietnam. China launched an offensive in response to Vietnam's invasion and occupation of Cambodia in 1978, which ended the rule of the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge. The conflict lasted for about a month, with China withdrawing its troops in March 1979.\nSino-Vietnamese conflicts (1979–1991) were a series of border and naval clashes between the People's Republic of China and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam following the Sino-Vietnamese War in 1979. These clashes lasted from the end of the Sino-Vietnamese War until the normalization of ties in 1991.\nJohnson South Reef Skirmish took place on 14 March 1988 between military forces of the People's Republic of China and Vietnam, on the Johnson South Reef in the Union Banks region of the Spratly Islands, in the South China Sea.\nThird Taiwan Strait Crisis (also called the 1995–1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis or the 1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis), was the effect of a series of missile tests conducted by the People's Republic of China in the waters surrounding Taiwan, including the Taiwan Strait from 21 July 1995 to 23 March 1996. The first set of missiles fired in mid-to-late 1995 were allegedly intended to send a strong signal to the Republic of China government under President Lee Teng-hui, who had been seen as \"moving its foreign policy away from the One-China policy\", as claimed by PRC. The second set of missiles were fired in early 1996, allegedly intending to intimidate the Taiwanese electorate in the run-up to the 1996 presidential election.\nScarborough Shoal standoff is a dispute between the Philippines and the People's Republic of China over the Scarborough Shoal. Tensions began on April 8, 2012, after the attempted apprehension by the Philippine Navy of eight mainland Chinese fishing vessels near the shoal.\n2020–2021 China–India skirmishes began on 5 May 2020, when Chinese and Indian troops engaged in aggressive melee, face-offs, and skirmishes at locations along the Sino-Indian border, including near the disputed Pangong Lake in Ladakh and the Tibet Autonomous Region, and near the border between Sikkim and the Tibet Autonomous Region. Additional clashes also took place at locations in eastern Ladakh along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).\n\n\n== Major individuals and groups ==\n\n\n=== Political ===\nBelow are a lists of primarily political individuals and groups serving the People's Republic of China that spanned multiple conflicts and events.

        "content": "Manorama Basu (née Monorama Ray, 18 November 1897 – 16 October 1986), nicknamed Masima (maternal aunt), was a Bengali revolutionary and feminist from Bangladesh. She was born in 1897 in the village of Bakai in Barisal, which was then part of British India (now part of Bangladesh). Throughout her life, Basu played a prominent role in the popular movements of 1962, 1964, and the mass uprising of 1969. She was also a pioneer in the Bangladeshi liberation struggle.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\nManorama Basu was born as Manorama Ray, on 18 November 1897, in the village of Narottampur in the Banaripara upazila of Barisal, which was then part of undivided Bengal under British rule (now in Bangladesh). She was the fifth child of Nilkantha Ray and Pramoda Sundari Ray, who were supporters of the anti-British movement. Manorama's early life was marked by poverty, and she did not have the opportunity to receive formal education due to her father's untimely death.\nAt the age of 14, Manorama was married to Chintaharan Basu, who was the zamindar (landlord) of the village of Bakai in Barisal. Despite the constraints of her landlord husband's family, Manorama Basu actively participated in the Indian independence movement while living in Barisal.\n\n\n=== Involvement in the Independence Movement ===\nIn 1921–1922, Manorama Basu taught women in the villages how to spin the charkha (spinning wheel) and wear khadi (homespun cloth) as part of the \"Charakha Dharo, Khaddar Paro\" (Grasp the Charkha, Wear Khaddar) movement. Manorama Basu herself wore khaddar clothing throughout her life.\nIn 1925, when Mahatma Gandhi visited Barisal for political campaigning and fundraising, Manorama Basu actively participated in the swadeshi (self-reliance) movement and even donated her own jewelry. In the same year, after the death of Sarojnalini Datta, Manorama Basu established the Sarojnalini Mahila Samiti (Sarojnalini Women's Organization) in Barisal, which was one of the first women's organizations in what is now Bangladesh, to safeguard women's rights.\nManorama Basu joined the Indian National Congress in the early 1930s and became a Congress worker. In 1932, she was one of the first three women who courted arrest in the civil disobedience movement, and she had the opportunity to interact with Chittaranjan Das's sister, Urmila Devi, and Jyotirmoyee Devi in the Behrampur jail.\n\n\n=== Communist affiliation and activism ===\nIn the early 1940s, Manorama Basu joined the Communist Party of India. She was a leader of the Barisal branch of the Women's Self-Defense Society. During the Bengal famine of 1943–44, she was actively involved in relief work, including setting up soup kitchens, hospitals, and rescue shelters.\nAfter the partition of India in 1947, Manorama Basu led a movement to supply food in Barisal, for which she was imprisoned for a year. She was later imprisoned for another three years under the Public Safety Act until her release in 1952.\nIn 1954, the growing political instability and unrest in East Pakistan (present-day Bangladesh) compelled Manorama Basu to go into temporary hiding. However, when the situation became more conducive, she resurfaced and dedicated herself to the work of the Matrimandir Ashram, which she had established earlier. Recognizing the importance of ensuring the long-term sustenance of the Ashram's activities, Manorama Basu deciced to bequeath all of her personal property to the institution.\n\n\n=== Role in popular movements ===\nManorama Basu played a crucial role in the popular movements that swept across East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) in the 1960s. She was at the forefront of the mass demonstrations and uprisings in 1962, 1964, and the pivotal revolt of 1969, which helped pave the way for Bangladesh's eventual independence.\n\n\n=== Other contributions ===\nIn addition to her political activism, Manorama Basu was actively involved in social welfare activities. She established the Pallikalyan Amrta Pathagar (model primary school) and a playhouse for children in Barisal.\n\n\n=== Later life and legacy ===\nManorama Basu was ailing from various ailments since 1983. She died on 16 October 1986, at the Matrimandir Ashram she had established in Kauniya, Barisal. She was the mother of four daughters and one son.\nAfter her death, Manorama Basu's entire property was used to establish the \"Manorama Basu Masima Memorial Trust\" in 2001. The Matrimandir Ashram she had founded was later converted into a government primary school in Barisal.\nManorama Basu's contributions to the women's rights movement, the independence struggle, and the establishment of various social welfare institutions have been recognized with several posthumous awards, including the Sher-e-Bangla Medal in 1997 and the Begum Rokeya Medal by the Government of Bangladesh in 1999.\nIn 1971, the renowned writer and journalist Satyen Sen wrote the book \"Manorama Masima\" on the life and work of Manorama Basu.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nসমবারু চন্দ্র মহন্ত (2012). \"বসু, মনোরমা মাসীমা\".

The TRP advocated for labor and other social movements and supported the liberation of Taiwanese nation. The TRR also referred to the PRC as \"great power\" (列強) rather than an anti-imperialist state. So they were against the Chinese Communist Party, although there was a Marxist–Leninist element.In May 1986, Hsu Hsin-liang defected from the Taiwan Revolutionary Party, saying, \"If the KMT sincerely promotes democratization, it has no intention of overthrowing the KMT regime in a revolutionary way\". The TRP disbanded on March 23, 1987.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAnti-imperialism\nMinzu jiefang (民族解放)\n\n\n== References ==",

In the program he admitted to being an spokesman of George Soros and dissgraced Hungarian oligarch Lajos Simicska and that hidden powers are operating the Hungarian Two-Tailed Dog Party. The program, having been uploaded to the YouTube-channel of Echo TV, became the most-watched video in a few days.\nThe Two-tailed Dog Party was closely involved in the campaign during the October 2016 migrant quota referendum, mocking the government's anti-immigrant messages and phrases. In response to government posters which read \"Did you know?\" followed by claimed facts about immigration, the party spent €100,000 of voluntary donations from 4,000 people on posters with satirical slogans, such as \"Did you know there's a war in Syria?\", \"Did you know one million Hungarians want to emigrate to Europe?\", \"Did you know? The perpetrators in most corruption cases are politicians\" and \"Did you know? During the Olympics, the biggest danger to Hungarian participants came from foreign competitors\". Gergely Kovács told BBC News that \"... What we can do is appeal to the millions in Hungary who are upset by the government campaign. We want them to know they are not alone\". The party asked people to cast invalid ballots in the referendum. Eventually, 6% of the voters cast a spoiled ballot.\n\n\n== As candidate and local council member ==\nKovács was lead candidate of the Hungarian Two-Tailed Dog Party list in both the 2018 and 2022 parliamentary elections, and won a council seat from the same party's list in the 2019 local elections in the 12. district of Budapest (Hegyvidék).\nHe is a candidate for mayor in the 2024 local elections, having won a ranked-choice opposition primary against two other candidates with 61% of the vote in the first round of counting.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nLáng Dávid: Mit akar plakátjaival a Kétfarkú Kutya Párt? szeretlekmagyarorszag.hu, 2015. június 15.",

        "content": "Xanthophyllum fragrans, commonly known as fragrant boxwood, is an evergreen plant in the family Polygalaceae found only in the Wet Tropics bioregion of Queensland, Australia.\n\n\n== Description ==\nXanthophyllum fragrans is a tree growing up to about 20 m (66 ft) tall, and it may produce buttress roots. The leaves are simple, arranged alternately and attached to the twigs by petioles about 10 mm (0.39 in) long; they are glossy dark green above and paler green below, and measure up to 20 cm (7.9 in) long by 7 cm (2.8 in) wide.\nThe inflorescences are produced either terminally or in the leaf axils, and they take the form of a raceme about 12 cm (4.7 in) long. The flowers are very fragrant and quite large with five cream to yellow petals up to 7 cm (2.8 in) long and 1 cm (0.39 in) wide. The stamens are about 55 mm (2.2 in) long with anthers about 3 mm (0.12 in) long; the style is about 40 mm (1.6 in) long, the stigma is capitate (i.e. like the head of a pin).\nThe orange fruit is (in botanical terms) a berry measuring about 9 cm (3.5 in) long and 4.5 cm (1.8 in) wide. They contain 8 or more seeds measuring about 15 mm (0.59 in) by 12 mm (0.47 in), which are completely enclosed in a cream aril.\n\n\n=== Phenology ===\nFlowering occurs from September to October, and fruit ripen in December and January.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThis species was first described by the Australian botanist Cyril Tenison White in his paper titled Contributions to the Queensland Flora, No. 6, which was read to the Royal Society of Queensland in November 1938. It was subsequently published in the Society's journal Proceedings of the Royal Society of Queensland in 1939.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nXanthophyllum fragrans has a restricted distribution within Queensland's Wet Tropics World Heritage Area, from near Cape Tribulation to the Kuranda National Park. It grows in well developed rainforest at altitudes from near sea level up to 1,000 m (3,300 ft).\nIt has a total Area of Occupancy of just 120 km2 (46 sq mi).\n\n\n== Conservation ==\nThis species is listed by the Queensland Government's Department of Environment, Science and Innovation as near threatened. As of 15 April 2024, it has not been assessed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).\n\n\n== Cultivation ==\nThis species is too large for the average suburban garden but it has potential as an attractive park tree due to its large fragrant flowers and colourful fruit.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nView a map of herbarium collections of this species at the Australasian Virtual Herbarium\nView observations of this species on iNaturalist\nView images of this species on Flickriver.com",

        "content": "The Centauro series is a family of Argentinian solid fuel sounding rockets developed by the Instituto de Investigaciones Aeronauticas y Espaciales (IIAE). This family includes Alfa, Beta, and Gamma Centauro.\nAlfa Centauro was a single-stage rocket, launched in 1961 from Santo Tomás base.\nBeta Centauro followed the same year, demonstrating two-stage capability and leading to advancements in payload delivery and high altitude measurements. Further launches from Santo Tomás and CELPA Chamical refined rocketry techniques. Notably, the \"sodium cloud\" operation in 1963 provided valuable atmospheric data.\nThe Gamma Centauro, also a two-stage vehicle, was tested after 1964, notably from Antarctica.\n\n\n== Alfa Centauro ==\n\nAlfa Centauro measured 2.7 m in length and 101 mm in diameter (at the warhead), with a total maximum weight of 28 kg and only 3.3 kg of payload. The solid fuel used consisted of a mix of nitrocellulose, nitroglycerin and  additives. \nMain characteristics of the Alfa Centauro sounding rocket were:\n\nApogee: 20 km\nPayload: 3.3 kg\nLength: 2705 mm\nLaunch weight: 28 kg\nPayload length: 1088 mm\nPayload diameter: 101 mm\nDelta-v: 1800 kg/sec.\nSpecific impulse: 200 s\nBurn time: 1.23 s\nRocket motor length: 1617 mm\nRocket motor diameter: 94 mm\nPropellant weight: ~11 kg\nBuilt entirely in Argentina and under the control of the Argentine Air Force, the first launch took place on February 2, 1961, from the Santo Tomás base in the Achala Pampa in the province of Córdoba. The rocket was named APEX A1-02 and reached an altitude of 20 km.\n\n\n== Beta Centauro ==\n\nBeta Centauro, a two-stage sounding rocket, had a length of 3,812 mm. The first stage (similar to Alfa Centauro) measured 1,769 mm with a diameter of 94 mm, and the second stage was 1,173 mm long with 79.5 mm in diameter\nMain characteristics of the Beta Centauro sounding rocket were:\n\nApogee: 25 km\nPayload: 3.3 kg\nLength: 3700 mm\nLaunch weight: 47.3 kg\nSpecific impulse: 200 s\nFirst stage length: 1769 mm\nFirst stage delta-v: 1800 kg/sec.\nFirst stage burn time: 1.23 s\nFirst stage diameter: 94 mm\nFirst stage propellant weight: ~11 kg\nSecond stage length: 1173 mm\nSecond stage delta-v: 900 kg/sec.\nSecond stage burn time: 1 s\nSecond  stage diameter: 79.5 mm\nSecond stage propellant weight: ~4.5 kg\nBeta Centauro was first launched on September 30, 1961. The rocket as designated APEX-A1-S2-015 and aimed to experiment with the separation of the two stages and to test the measurements and instruments of the vehicle: flight speed, range, atmospheric pressure, among other parameters. The launch was successful, and the rocket reached an altitude of 25 km.\nOn October 13, 1961, the Aerospace Institute conducted the second launch of the rocket (APEX-A1-S2-016) at the same base. Another Centauro rocket was launched on May 10, 1962, coinciding with the start of activities at the CELPA base in Chamical, La Rioja.\nOn February 19, 1962, five new launches were carried out from the Santo Tomás Base, where the new Scar 2.65 engines were tested for the first time, successfully recovering the capsules with their payloads in all cases, allowing the measurement of the altitude at which the separation occurred.\nOn November 15, 27, and 30, Centauro rockets were launched, the last two for aeronomy purposes, all three launched from the CELPA Chamical base, La Rioja province. On December 8 and 9, Centauro rockets were launched again, also for aeronomy purposes and with successful results. Throughout that year, the experiments were successful and yielded significant advances, with a total of 18 launches carried out.\nOn May 25, 1963, the Centauro 35 launch was undertaken for the \"sodium cloud\" operation, resulting in wind and turbulence measurements, reaching an altitude of 189 km.\nExperiments with the Beta Centauro allowed for the refinement of payload takeoff and altitude measurements, continuing from 1964 with the Orion sounding rocket.\n\n\n== Gamma Centauro ==\n\nGamma Centauro was a two-stage rocket, with a length of 2.43 m and a diameter of 13 cm, capable of sending a 5 kg payload to an apogee of 59 km.\nMain characteristics of the Gamma Centauro sounding rocket were:\n\nApogee: 59 km\nPayload: 5 kg\nLength: 2430 mm\nLaunch weight: 27 kg\nFirst stage  specific impulse: 225 s\nFirst stage length: 800 mm\nFirst stage diameter: 130 mm\nFirst stage propellant weight: 11 kg\nSecond stage specific impulse: 212 s\nSecond stage length: 1600 mm\nSecond  stage diameter: 90 mm\nSecond stage propellant weight: ~4 kg\nGamma Centauro was first tested on December 6, 1962. The following year, several tests of models I and II were conducted at CELPA.\nOn August 27, 1964, the \"Operation Inca\" mission was carried out in the province of Mendoza (more precisely near the Puente del Inca). During the operation, a vehicle was propelled to an altitude of 35 km, and the payload was recovered by parachute. The model served to test the equipment that would later be part of the next project in Antarctica in 1965, including the launch tower and the polyethylene cover with heating that maintained the cabin at a temperature of 25 °C.\nGamma Centaur tests continued in February 1965 when, for the first time, two Gamma Centaur rockets were simultaneously launched from the CELPA Experimentation Center, and two others from the Matienzo Base in Antarctica. Two sounding balloons assembled by the National University of Tucumán were also tested, reaching an altitude of 24 km.\nIn this way, Argentina became the third country, after the Soviet Union and the United States, to undertake aerospace activities from Antarctica. The resulting experiences were used to analyze flight and study X-rays in the atmosphere. In August, four tests were carried out with Gamma Centauro rockets from the CELPA base, all successful.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Styphelia quartzitica is a species of flowering plant in the heath family Ericaceae and is endemic to a small area in the south of Western Australia. It is an erect shrub with hairy young branchlets, sharply-pointed, linear or very narrowly egg-shaped leaves, and cream-coloured, tube-shaped flowers.\n\n\n== Description ==\nStyphelia quartzitica is an erect shrub with hairy young branchlets, that typically grows to up to 60 cm (24 in) high and 40 cm (16 in) wide. Its leaves are linear to very narrowly egg-shaped, 7–14 mm (0.28–0.55 in) long, 0.8–1.5 mm (0.031–0.059 in) wide on a petiole 0.3–0.8 mm (0.012–0.031 in) long and sharply pointed. The flowers are usually arranged singly in leaf axils and are widely spreading and sessile with broadly egg-shaped bracts 0.4–0.6 mm (0.016–0.024 in) long and bracteoles 1.0–1.3 mm (0.039–0.051 in) long and 1.0–1.4 mm (0.039–0.055 in) wide. The sepals are narrowly egg-shaped, 2.8–3.6 mm (0.11–0.14 in) long and 1.2–1.3 mm (0.047–0.051 in) wide and pale greenish to straw-coloured. The petals are cream-coloured and joined at the base to form a tube 3.0–4.5 mm (0.12–0.18 in) long and 1.7–2.2 mm (0.067–0.087 in) wide, with lobes that are turned back and 2.0–2.5 mm (0.079–0.098 in) long. Flowering mostly occurs between March and May, sometimes longer.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nStyphelia quartzitica was first formally described in 2019 by Michael Hislop in the journal Nuytsia from specimens he collected in the Fitzgerald River National Park in 2016. The specific epithet (quartzitica) means \"belonging to quartz\"..\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nThis styphelia is restricted to the upper slopes of hills and mountains in remote parts of the Fitzgerald River National Park where it grows in the understorey of dense heath in the Esperance Plains bioregion of southern Western Australia.\n\n\n== Conservation status ==\nStyphelia quartzitica is listed as \"Priority Two\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions, meaning that it is poorly known and from only one or a few locations.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Women's Monastery of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross (Ukrainian: Хрестовоздвиженський жіночий монастир, romanized: Khrestovozdvyzhenskyi zhinochyi monastyr) is a convent of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) located in Poltava, Ukraine.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Holy Cross Exaltation Monastery was founded in 1650 by monks from Mhar Monastery. The construction of the initial, wooden complex was financed by Cossack commander Martyn Pushkar, and Hetman Ivan Samoylovych later funded the construction of the Holy Cross Exaltation Cathedral within the monastery. In 1693, during the Ruin the monastery was burned down by soldiers of the Crimean Khanate, and it later served as a base for Swedish forces during the Battle of Poltava amidst the Great Northern War.\nTaras Shevchenko painted the monastery in 1845.\nSeveral foreign leaders have visited the monastery. King Charles XII of Sweden visited the monastery during the Great Northern War, as did Peter the Great. The former monarch even lived in the monastery for a short period of time, and later Romanov emperors also regularly attended services. Later, during World War II, Adolf Hitler also visited the monastery on 3 December 1941. The monastery was later destroyed during the war, and only restored in 1999.\nThe monastery is designed in a Ukrainian Baroque style. It is included on the State Register of Immovable Landmarks of Ukraine, and draws hundreds of visitors yearly.\n\n\n== References ==",

Its tributary is the Los Pinos River.\nIn the widest sector (Lebu) it measures approximately 250 m, and in Los Álamos (bridge sector) about 50 m.\n\n\n== Population, economy, and ecology ==\nThe Cupaño River has a wooden suspension bridge measuring approximately 80 m in length and 4 m in width, one of the main attractions in the Los Álamos area.\n\n\n== History ==\nIts involvement in Chilean history begins in the with the conquistador Pedro de Valdivia who crossed the river in his race towards Fort Tucapel where he would be assassinated by Lautaro.\nFrancisco Solano Asta-Buruaga y Cienfuegos wrote in 1899 in his posthumous work Diccionario Geográfico de la República de Chile about the area:\n\nCupaño.-—Estate in the department of Cañete, located on the south side of the Lebu River in a northerly direction from the capital city. Facing the estate, the river has the Cupaño ford, which crosses the road from Arauco to that city and which is five or six kilometers upstream from the Gualgalén spot. Some change the name to Copañu. In a spot on the south side of the ford, on June 2, 1817, the governor of the Arauco plaza, Don José Cienfuegos, and his entourage were killed, invited there for a peaceful meeting by a few chiefs from the surrounding area, at the suggestion of the royalist leader Sánchez, ambushed in the vicinity, and who suddenly fell with a strong force on that governor; see city of Nacimiento.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nNiemeyer F., Hans, Hoyas hidrográficas de Chile, Octava Región (PDF), Santiago de Chile: Ministerio de Obras Públicas (Chile), Dirección General de Aguas, archived from the original (PDF) on 11 November 2018, retrieved 30 November 2018 {{citation}}: Invalid |ref=harv (help)",

        "content": "Melinda S. Zook is a historian, academic, and author. She is the Director of Cornerstone Integrated Liberal Arts within the College of Liberal Arts and the Germaine Seelye Oesterle Professor of History in the Department of History at Purdue University.\nZook's research spans the history of political thought, religion, and women in early modern Britain, with published articles covering topics such as radical politics, martyrdom, political poetry, women, religion, and teaching. She has authored two books titled Radical Whigs & Conspiratorial Politics in Late Stuart England and Protestantism, Politics, and Women in Britain, 1660-1714, the latter of which was awarded the Best Book on Gender for 2013 by the Society for the Study of Early Modern Women. She is also the co-editor of Revolutionary Currents: Nation Building in the Transatlantic World, Challenging Orthodoxies: The Social and Cultural World of Early Modern Women, and Generations of Women Historians: Within and Beyond the Academy. In addition, she has received awards from Purdue University including the Mortar Board Society Helen B. Schleman Gold Medallion Award in 2019 and the Charles B. Murphy Outstanding Undergraduate Teaching Award in 2022.\n\n\n== Education ==\nZook attained her Bachelor of Arts degree from George Washington University in 1983, with a major in English Literature. This was followed by a Master of Arts degree focusing on Modern Europe from George Washington University in 1985. Later, she received her Ph.D. degree from Georgetown University in 1993, specializing in Early Modern Europe and England.\n\n\n== Career ==\nZook began her career at Purdue University as an assistant professor of history in 1993. She then became an associate professor in 1999 and was appointed to full-rank position of Professor of History in 2013. She has been holding an appointment as a Germaine Seelye Oesterle Professor of History in the Department of History at Purdue University since 2022.Zook served as the Director of Undergraduate Studies in the Department of History at Purdue University from 2001 to 2004 and as the President of the Midwest Conference on British Studies from 2005 to 2007.\n\n\n=== Model for general education ===\nAlong with seven liberal arts faculty members, Zook developed the Cornerstone Integrated Liberal Arts program. The program opens with a gateway sequence, Transformative Texts, for first-year Purdue students, taught by full-time faculty. In her article titled \"Gen Z Is Ready to Talk. Are Professors Ready to Listen?\", she discussed the model for general education, which employs small, general-education courses centered around \"transformative texts\" to actively engage students in debates, workshops, and projects. It emphasizes faculty mentorship and student support, acknowledging challenges, particularly those intensified by COVID-19. Steven Mintz, an American historian, remarked, \"Their Cornerstone certificate program offers first-year students an experience somewhat analogous to that provided by Honors Colleges.\" Students also learn that the \"boundaries of race, gender, and cultural difference can be crossed by exercising the sympathetic imagination.\" In this respect, writes Sarah Bray, \"The Cornerstone classroom is a rehearsal space for democracy.\"Cornerstone is recognized by the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) as a national model for revitalizing interest in the humanities and fostering lifelong learning through its approach to general education. In 2020, the NEH and the Teagle Foundation partnered to enhance college general education through the Cornerstone program, announcing $7 million for the replication initiative named \"Cornerstone: Learning for Living\". Expanding to other campuses, the program enhances liberal arts for STEM-focused students, with $1.625 million in grants awarded to 21 institutions in 2021 as part of this effort.This work has been covered by media outlets such as The Washington Post, The New York Times, The Chronicle of Higher Education, Town and Country, LearningWell Magazine, and Inside Philanthropy.\n\n\n== Research ==\nZook's research areas encompass early modern European history, with a focus on Tudor-Stuart England, political thought, culture, and women and gender studies.\n\n\n=== Works ===\nZook has authored books including Radical Whigs and Conspiratorial Politics in Late Stuart England which focused on England's political landscape during the 1670s-1680s, examining a network of radical conspirators seeking a Protestant monarchy succession. She emphasized the grassroots origins of liberalism, tracing its development in London's social hubs and arguing for its defense on the streets amid adversity. William E. Burns in his review of this book said, \"Certainly this volume is evidence of how rich their efforts have been.\" Her book, Protestantism, Politics and Women in Britain, was awarded Best Book on Gender for 2013 by the Society for the Study of Early Modern Women. It examined the role of women in late seventeenth and early eighteenth-century British politics, highlighting their effort to protecting the Protestant faith both domestically and internationally. Susan Wiseman, upon reviewing this book, remarked that \"This study is an important contribution to the thinking on Protestant women in the period 1660–1714.\"Zook co-edited Generations of Women Historians: Within and Beyond the Academy with Hilda L. Smith, among other works. This book, a collection of essays, explored the historical journey of early women historians, revealing how societal and intellectual factors shaped their lives and careers. It highlighted their contributions over four centuries and the distinct challenges they encountered in academia compared to men. In Challenging Orthodoxies, co-edited with Sigrun Haude, she explored diverse perspectives on early modern women's experiences, challenging conventional narratives across various realms. Emma Major in her review for Interactive Journal for Women in the Arts stated, \"This excellent collection of essays in honor of Hilda L. Smith is full of surprises and scholarly delights.\"Co-edited with Michael Morrison, Zook's book Revolutionary Currents analyzed the global crosscurrents of revolutionary ideologies and highlighted the impact of transatlantic interactions on shaping modern revolutions. Doina Pasca Harsanyi from Central Michigan University noted, \"This volume will be a valuable contribution to any discussion of the dynamic interplay between the ramifications of historical attempts at nation-building and the current march towards globalization.\"\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n2016 – Kenneth T.

        "content": "Cristoforo I Baschenis (documented from 1465 to 1490) was an Italian painter, belonging to one of the most popular workshops of itinerant painters present in the Bergamo area and in Trentino.\n\n\n== Biography and works ==\nChristopher I is the progenitor, in a pictorial sense, of one of the two branches of the Baschenis family.\nIt appears from documentary sources that he was resident in Colla, a hamlet of Santa Brigida, Rome (BG) and that he stayed for some time in Brescia; but - as far as is known - he worked mainly in Trentino.\nIn, 1474, he was in Pelugo in Val Rendena where on the facade of the cemetery church dedicated to Sant'Antonio Abate, under the pitch of the roof, he painted a large image of the saint dedicatee. It is his only work of certain attribution, signed and dated (6 October 1474). It is a fresco which testifies to some attention to the novelties Renaissance art which spread in Lombardy in the second half of the Fifteenth century.\nRegarding this work it has been observed:\n\n. The figure of that Saint ... is highlighted by his elegant style, ... as can be seen from the darting folds of his robes, ... and the not excessively marked contours . The face of Saint Anthony does not have that hieratic severity, typical of the Gothic and late Gothic, and appears in a good-natured, immediate aspect, which seems to accompany the blessing gesture of the right hand. If we then observe the aedicule and the seat, in their Renaissance architecture, we realize more the diversity of the work compared to the author's original tradition.\nOn the basis of stylistic affinities, other fresco panels that decorate the façade can be attributed to Cristoforo I: the\nMadonna with Child, the SS. Trinity, the'Annunciation, the Procession and San Giorgio.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nL.

        "content": "Jonathan B. Bricker is an American clinical psychologist, academic, and scientist. He is a professor in the Division of Public Health Sciences (PHS) at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, an Affiliate Professor in the Department of Psychology, and a Member of the Graduate Faculty at the University of Washington. He is the founder and leader of the Health and Behavioral Innovations in Technology (HABIT) research lab at the Fred Hutch Cancer Center.Bricker's main contribution to science is in the novel translation of behavioral therapies into high-reach technologies that prevent cancer. He is most known for integrating Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) into AI-based chatbots, smartphone apps, websites, and telehealth interventions for preventing major causes of cancer: cigarette smoking and obesity. He and his research lab have conducted large randomized clinical trials testing these interventions, including a nationwide study funded by the National Institutes of Health which showed that the iCanQuit app was efficacious for quitting smoking. He has worked on adapting and testing these interventions for vulnerable populations, including American Indians and Alaska Natives, Blacks adults, Hispanic adults, and cancer patients. His research career began with the development and testing of a tool to measure air travel stress, followed by contributions to science, including discoveries on the efficacy of proactive coaching to help teenagers stop smoking and on the long-term influences of parental behavior on their children's tobacco use.\n\n\n== Education ==\nBricker earned his B.A. with majors in Psychology and English Literature from the University of California, Berkeley in 1997. He then obtained his M.S. in Clinical Psychology from the University of Washington (UW), in 1999, followed by his Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology from the same institution in 2003.\n\n\n== Career ==\nBricker's research career began in 1997 as a clinical psychology PhD student at the University of Washington, mentored by Irwin Sarason, where his training focused on psychological research methods and treating addictions and anxiety disorders. While in graduate school, he conducted research on defining and measuring air travel stress and introduced the Air Travel Stress Scale, identifying three key components: anxious reactions to adverse events, anger towards passengers, and lack of trust in airlines/airports. His research compared this stress before and after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, and he also found demographic differences in air travel stress components—providing insights for addressing air travel stress.After completing his PhD in 2003, Bricker joined the faculty of the Fred Hutch Cancer Center in Seattle, Washington. His early research at the Fred Hutch focused on conducting longitudinal cohort studies examining social and psychological influences on youth and young adult smoking initiation and cessation. He also studied the impact of proactive telephone coaching to help teenagers stop smoking. In 2007, he began work on translating an intensive in-person clinical intervention called Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) into a brief program delivered through technologies. He and his HABIT research lab have designed and tested, through large randomized clinical trials, ACT-based programs delivered in brief telephone coaching, website, smartphone, and chatbot formats. These programs are being applied to tobacco control and weight loss.Bricker has served as a regular member on grant review panels for the NIH's Center for Scientific Review, including chairing review panels focused on tobacco regulatory science and smoking cessation interventions for individuals with HIV. He is a fellow of scientific societies including the Association for Contextual Behavioral Science and the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco, and serves as a Senior Editor of a leading scientific journal on substance abuse called Addiction.Since 1999, Bricker's work has been featured in media outlets including The New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, TIME, and Newsweek. He has presented his research to the US Surgeon General, Centers for Disease Control, the First Lady of China (Madame Peng Liyuan), and the comedian and writer Trevor Noah.\n\n\n== Public health contributions ==\nBricker has disseminated his discoveries for broad public health impact, with his lab's digital interventions for quitting smoking. His self-help tools include his AI-based chatbot, QuitBot, and an online class on quitting smoking, while his iCanQuit program is distributed in the US as the \"2Morrow Health\" smartphone app through employee wellness programs and health insurance companies. His TEDx talk, \"Secret To Self Control,\" presented the ACT approach to smoking cessation and weight loss. His work has inspired health habit change methods featured in Nir Eyal's book, Indistractable.In 2015, he was a scientific advisor for the Washington State Senate Bill 6096, which was signed into law on June 30, 2015, as the Andy Hill Cancer Research Endowment Fund (CARE) to fund cancer research in Washington State. In 2019, he testified before the Washington State Legislature regarding House Bill 1074, advocating for raising the minimum age for purchasing cigarettes and vaping products to 21. Washington Governor Jay Inslee approved and signed the State's Tobacco 21 law into effect on April 5, 2019, in a ceremony at the Fred Hutch. At the Federal level, he served on the White House Cancer Moonshot for Smoking Cessation in June 2023, which later implemented broad programs for providing smoking cessation services to marginalized communities throughout the US.\n\n\n== Selected articles ==\nBricker, J.B.

        "content": "Giovanni Baschenis (1471–1503) was an Italian painter whose name is combined with that of his brother Battista, also a painter.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nGiovanni Baschenis was the son of Antonio belonging to the dynasty of the Lanfranco family and nephew of Angelo. Some paintings created by Giovanni Baschenis were also linked to the name of Battista, who was probably the brother with the sole duties of assistant.Giovanni began his artistic activity in Trentino with his brother, but upon returning to Bergamo he continued his activity independently.In Trentino the two painters signed the frescoes for the chapel of San Valerio in Castel Valer in Tassullo, those of the Church of Santi Filippo and Giacomo in Segonzone (in the municipality of Campodenno) and those always present in Val di Non in the church of Sant'Udalrico in Corte Inferiore (Noise); here, the fresco dated 1471 of the'Last Supper has the writing Joha[n]nes et Baptista de Averaria pinxeru[n]t 1471.Giovanni returned to the Bergamo area, his homeland, frescoing the Casa Volpi in Fuipiano al Brembo. The fresco Christ on the tomb between Mary and John has the writing Ritius filius quodam Zani hoc opus fieri and die 4 novembris 1486 in the upper part. The work depicts a red tomb, with Christ supported by the Mother on the right, and Saint John praying on the left. The upper part has a long writing with instructions for obtaining the indulgence. The cartouche reports an error in the indication of the years of the indulgence named in twenty-two thousand years. At the bottom he signs Johannes de Avaia pixit.A second fresco is the Madonna and Child among the Saints. The fresco lacks that plasticity that would make the work Renaissance in orientation, the cloak of the Madonna with the printed flowers gives solemnity to the whole work.In the sacristy of the church in the Alino hamlet of San Pellegrino Terme there is the fresco signed and dated 1478 depicting the Original Sin which presents us with Eve who, with the apple in her hand, covers herself and reveals herself naked, and Adam in 'act of touching your throat as if to feel the Adam's apple grow. In the sacristy there is a further fresco Theory of the Saints which is the depiction of five saints: John the Baptist, Saint Blaise, Mary Magdalene, Saint Defendente and the central image of Saint Catherine of Alexandria in the act of being crowned by two angels. The work is dated 1470 and was attributed to Giovanni Baschenis by Luigi Angelini.The frescoes depicting San Defendente housed in the apse of the Church of San Defendente in the locality Roncola date back to 1482. In 1490 he frescoed the church of San Lorenzo of Cunevo.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliografia ==\nAA.VV. (September 2020). Giovanni Valagussa (ed.). I pittori Baschenis Itinerari bergamaschi.

        "content": "This is a list of standard zoom lenses that are designed for mirrorless cameras — limit one per brand, focal length, aperture, and zoom mechanism combination. There is no precise definition of the term, but lenses marketed as \"standard zoom\" usually cover a range of at least 30mm to 70mm in terms of 35mm equivalent focal length with an optical zoom ratio of 2.5× (e.g. 28-70mm) to 5× (e.g. 24-120mm) — the most common being 3× (e.g. 24-70mm). They are called standard zoom lenses, because the midpoint of their zoom range is around 50mm, which is considered a standard or \"normal\" field of view.\n\n\n== History ==\nHigh-quality optical formulas for wider-angle lenses are more difficult and expensive to achieve and produce, so older standard zoom lenses often started at 27mm or 28mm instead of 24mm at the wide end, especially for smaller sensor formats.\n\n\n== Full-frame lenses ==\n\n\n== APS-C lenses ==\n\n\n== Micro Four Thirds lenses ==\n\n\n== 1.0-type sensor lenses ==\n\n\n== Variants ==\n\n\n=== 20-50mm ===\nThe increasingly popular 20-50mm zoom range is arguably more versatile than the more established 16-35mm lenses and shares the minimum 2.5× optical zoom ratio of 28-70mm lenses but shifted to a wider field of view. Even some new fixed-lens cameras like the Sony ZV-1 II are switching from a standard zoom lens to a wider zoom lens that covers this range.\n\n\n=== 35-150mm ===\nThe 35-150mm zoom range shares the 4× optical zoom ratio of 24-105mm lenses but shifted to a tighter field of view, which can be more useful for portraits.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of superzoom lenses\nList of kit lenses\nList of pancake lenses\nList of large sensor zoom cameras\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Elizabeth G. Creamer is an American educational research methodologist, author, and academic. She serves as a professor emerita of Educational Research and Evaluation at the Department of Educational Leadership and Policy Studies in the College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences at Virginia Tech (VT).\nCreamer's research interests span the humanities and social sciences with a specific focus on advancing the mixed methods field through the integration of grounded theory and mixed methods into a methodology tailored for intervention and evaluation research. She is the author of three books about mixed methods: An Introduction to Fully Integrated Mixed Methods Research, Advancing Grounded Theory with Mixed Methods, and Visual Displays in Qualitative and Mixed Methods Research. She was the editor of Reconfiguring the Firewall: Recruiting Women to Information Technology across Cultures and Continents and Development and Assessment of Self-Authorship. She is the recipient of the Excellence in Outreach Award and Betty Vetter Research Award.\n\n\n== Education and early career ==\nCreamer graduated from Rumson Fair Haven Regional High School in New Jersey in 1967 and earned her B.S. in English Education from Northwestern University in 1970. Following this, she served as a High School Teacher at Rocky Mountain High School in Colorado from 1973 to 1976, subsequently pursuing an M.Ed. in Reading Education from Colorado State University in 1974.  In 1981, she joined VT as a Reading and Study Skills Counselor then moved to an administrative position as assistant director of Financial Aid while concurrently completing her Ed.D. in Higher Education and Community College Education from the same institution in 1983.\n\n\n== Career ==\nCreamer has been a faculty member at VT for over 38 years. In 1985, she became an Adjunct Faculty Member in the Higher Education and Student Affairs Program within the College of Human Resources and Education where she served until 1994. She was an associate professor of Interdisciplinary Studies from 1995 to 2001 before moving to the School of Education, where she was later promoted to the rank of Professor in 2006. Since 2006, she has held the title of professor emerita in Educational Research and Evaluation at VT.\nCreamer served as Director of the Interdisciplinary Studies Program from 1988 to 2002. Since 2009, she has been an Associate Member of the Mixed Methods Program at UMich.\n\n\n== Works ==\nCreamer's first book, Assessing Faculty Productivity: Issues of Equity (1998) deconstructed elements of the academic reward structure that disadvantage women. It drew international notice following an interview that was included in a featured article in the Chronicle of Higher Education in September 1998, Why Don’t Women Publish as Much as Men? She authored An Introduction to Fully Integrated Mixed Methods Research which emphasized the benefits of integrating qualitative and quantitative strands throughout the research process. Greg P. Griffin praised the work saying that \"Creamer's book may be the most cogent approach to mixed methods research available.\" Her 2021 book, Advancing Grounded Theory with Mixed Methods provided insights into developing a multi-faceted analytical framework in social and behavioral sciences. Gregory Hadley in his review for the Journal of Mixed Methods Research, stated that \"By studying over sixty real-life exemplars the author clarifies the current murky nature of MM-GTM\".\nCreamer edited the volume Reconfiguring the Firewall: Recruiting Women to Information Technology across Cultures and Continents, discussing the global challenge of increasing women's participation in IT fields. She also edited Development and Assessment of Self-Authorship, which offered a comprehensive exploration of self-authorship across cultures and emphasized the interplay between personal characteristics and contextual influences. Michael G. Ignelzi, in his review for the Journal of College Student Development, noted how \"the book presents the most current theoretical understandings and research on self-authorship.\"\n\n\n== Research ==\nOver the span of her career, Creamer has focused  her research on methodology, mixed methods, grounded theory, faculty research productivity, faculty collaboration, women's advancement in STEM fields, and cognitive development. She has contributed to teaching and advising assignments in research methods, higher education, and women's studies, while participating in conferences and authoring peer-reviewed journal articles.\nCreamer alongside Anne Laughlin, investigated how women interpret contradictory career-related experiences utilizing interviews with 40 college women to confirm the link between self-authorship and career decision-making. The study emphasized the role of inter-connectivity, particularly involving parents, in women's decision-making processes, suggesting that students may reject career advice requiring cognitive complexity. She examined gender differences in undergraduate engineering students by using a mixed methods approach across nine institutions, finding that satisfaction with the engineering major doesn't necessarily align with future career aspirations, especially among women. Additionally, her work on evaluating initiatives aimed at fostering self-authorship growth introduced a measure of self-authorship by assessing three phases in its development.\nCreamer's research on translating developmental theory into academic advising practice emphasized enhancing routine interactions for student learning and personal development addressing advisors' challenges in balancing diverse guidance sources. She also examined how long-term collaborators negotiate their differences by studying the strategies employed by coauthors who have worked together for ten or more years underscoring the value of genuine engagement in fostering innovative knowledge.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n2007 – Excellence in Outreach Award, Virginia Tech College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences\n2010 – Betty Vetter Research Award, Women in Engineering ProActive Network\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Selected books ===\nReconfiguring the Firewall: Recruiting Women to Information Technology across Cultures and Continents (2007) ISBN 978-1568813141\nDevelopment and Assessment of Self-Authorship (2010) ISBN 978-1579223687\nAn Introduction to Fully Integrated Mixed Methods Research (2017) ISBN 978-1483350936\nAdvancing Grounded Theory with Mixed Methods (2021) ISBN 978-0367174804\n\n\n=== Selected articles ===\nCreamer, D.

        "content": "Angelo Baschenis (documented from 1450 to 1504) was an Italian painter, belonging to one of the most popular workshops of itinerant painters present in the Bergamo area and Trentino.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nThe Baschenis family, originally from fraction of Colla in the mountain municipality of Santa Brigida (BG), constitutes an interesting example of a frescanti workshop who, starting from the mid-15th century, handed down their trade from father to son for centuries.Angelo was the son of Giacomo and brother of Antonio, scion of the so-called Lanfranco dynasty, one of two strains of the family.The first news of Angelo's pictorial production dates back to 1482, the year in which we find him busy frescoing the presbytery of the church of San Defendente in Roncola in Imagna valley.In Ornica in Val Brembana, Angelo created an important cycle of frescoes signed and dated 15 in the parish church of Sant'Ambrogio. November 1485 next to the writing Angelus de Averaria pinxit una cum filio suo.They cover the apse of the ancient Gothic church with cross vault (later used as a sacristy).The Episodes from the life of San Nicola da Tolentino, a Crucifixion and other frescoes in the ancient parish church of Santa Brigida are attributed to Angelo Baschenis. , dating back to the penultimate decade of the 15th century.Later Angelo worked in Trentino; the frescoes of the church of San Giovanni Battista in Flavon are attributed to him where we find the Christ, the Evangelists, the Doctors of the Church, represented in the vault of the apse the Coronation of Mary and, on the walls of the apse, various episodes of the Life of Saint John the Baptist. An Annunciation and the figures of Adam and Eve appear on the triumphal arch; on the left wall there is a fresco dedicated to San Nicola da Tolentino, while on the right there is a Madonna Enthroned with Child dated 1485.On the south wall of the church of San Vigilio in Pinzolo we find four panels signed (\"Angelus de Averara pinxit\") and dated (26 May 1490); it is a Madonna Enthroned with Child and four episodes from the life of Christ: the Disbelief of Thomas, the Noli me tangere (episode curiously set in a vineyard ), the Descent into Limbo and the Ascent into heaven.\nThe painter still uses a fully Gothic language; the didactic intentions desired by the client shine through in it, not without a marked human piety, as appears in the figure of the Magdalene of Noli me tangere and in the face of the Madonna Enthrond.\nThe fresco paintings present in the church of San Ludovico in Bretto a small hamlet of Camerata Cornello dated 1504 are assigned to him.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n•Giovanni Valagussa - AA.VV., Bretto (Camerata Cornello), in Giovanni Valagussa (ed.), I pittori Baschenis Bergamo itineraries, Bergamo, Corponove, September 2020, ISBN  9788899219949.\n\n\n== External links ==\nwww.vallebrembana.com (ed.). \"The Baschenis painters\".

The building is the work of Irish architects Yvonne Farrell and Shelley McNamara of Grafton Architects, winners of the 2020 Pritzker Prize. Although it has been dubbed the \"modern Machu Picchu\" by supporters, the building's design has been met with controversy.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe campus, built in 2015 by Graña y Montero, was designed in 2011 by the winning architects of the UTEC International Architecture Competition, the Irish Yvonne Farrell and Shelley McNamara of Grafton Architects. The project won the Silver Lion award at the 13th edition of the Venice Biennale of Architecture. In early 2020, Farrell and McNamara were recognized with the Pritzker Prize for their architectural work.\nThe brutalist building had a budget of US$ 100 million for its construction. Its design and location have been met with controversy and criticism, as its \"unfinished appearance\" has been criticised and compared to the works built during Juan Velasco Alvarado's so-called revolutionary government.\n\n\n== See also ==\nUniversity of Engineering and Technology (Peru)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Lee Data Corporation was an American computer company based in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, and active as a hardware company from 1979 to 1990. It was principally founded by John M. Lee and John Roy to sell data terminal systems compatible with the IBM 3270. It found success going into the mid-1980s, with its offerings praised for their innovations and lower prices compared to IBM's 3270 line, but began faltering in the 1980s when IBM themselves began adopting such innovations.\nIn 1990, the company sold off their terminal assets and pivoted to provide equipment and software for telecommunications businesses under the name Apertus Technologies, Inc.. Apertus changed their name again to Carleton Corporation in the mid-1990s. Carleton was acquired by Oracle Corporation in 2000.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== As Lee Data (1979–1990) ===\nLee Data Corporation was founded in early 1979 by John M. Lee and John Roy of Minneapolis. Both had formerly worked for Data 100, Inc., a maker of data terminals and other peripherals for IBM mainframes and midrange computers, until January 1979, when Data 100 was purchased by Northern Telecom.: 1D  In raising money for Lee Data, the two founders sought their former employer, Ed Orenstein, who gave them sufficient start-up capital to begin devising their first products, a family of data terminal systems compatible with the IBM 3270.: 3D  Like IBM's offerings, Lee Data's terminal systems comprised multiple glass terminal units, as well as a controller unit and a printer.: 3D  The company initially occupied a 21,000-square-foot plant in Eden Prairie, Minnesota; by April 1980, the company employed 31 manufacturing staffers there.: 3D \nIn its first year of operation, the company posted revenues of US$631,000. In fiscal year 1982, the company posted $13.6 million in revenues and announced its first profit of $1.9 million.: 7A  Lee Data's fast growth was conducive to the success of their initial public offering on the over-the-counter market in November 1982. The success of the IPO made founder Lee a millionaire overnight.: 1A  By the end of the next year, Lee Data posted an annual revenue of over $50 million and had cornered roughly four percent of the American data terminal market.: 1D  Lee Data's single largest customer was the Bell System, accounting for roughly a quarter of the company's sales. Even long after the breakup of the Bell System in 1984, the Regional Bell Operating Companies formed in the aftermath provided a major source of revenue for Lee Data.: 8M \nIn 1983, the company attempted two acquisitions of competing technology companies that failed to go through for various reasons. The first was Wordtronix, Inc., a manufacturer of word processing systems also founded by ex–Data 100 employees, who directly competed with IBM and their Displaywriter System. Lee Data initially proposed to purchase Wordtronix for $6.4 million in a stock swap in July 1983. In September 1983, the acquisition was called off, Lee Data instead purchasing 19-percent ownership in Wordtronix. The second was of Visual Technology, Inc., a competing terminal manufacturer from Tewksbury, Massachusetts, whose acquisition Lee Data announced in November 1983 for $16.1 million in a stock swap. Lee Data sought to keep Visual Technology as a subsidiary while acquiring Visual's intellectual property. The bid for Visual collapsed in January 1985, however, shortly before the final signatures were inked. Lee Data agreed to pay $3 million in cancellation fees and agreeing to acquiring some of Visual Technology's patents as a result of the merger breaking down. Lee Data ultimately acquired the patents and designs for Visual Technology's unrealized \"supermicrocomputer\" based on the Intel 80286. Lee Data finished developing the product and marketed it as System 2000 in 1985.\nIn 1985, the company again announced two acquisitions of competing terminal companies. Unlike the botched acquisitions of Wordtronix and Visual Technology, however, the company successfully through with these acquisitions in January 1986, paying out the shareholders of both companies $4 million. The first company, Datastream Communications, Inc., was based in Santa Clara, California, and developed 3270-compatible cluster controllers and file transfer software, among other products; while the second company, Phaze Information Machines Corporation, developed IBM-compatible data terminals like Lee Data.\nEmployment at Lee Data peaked at 1,128 workers in early January 1985. That month, following poor financial performance in the company caused by price pressures from their competitors including IBM, Lee Data announced that they had laid off 106 workers across all departments. Employment hovered around the 1,100 mark around 1987, but the company announced a hiring freeze that year, owing to decreased sales and quarterly operating losses reaching $1.3 million.: 9B  By the end of 1987, four of Lee Data's founding executive talent had resigned, and at the beginning of 1988, Lee Data sold their UK-based international subsidiary to Olivetti.\nLee Data attempted a pivot toward developing specialized computer networking software, in an attempt to bolster its bottom line against shrinking terminal sales.: 4D  Despite their efforts, bloodletting at the company continued apace in 1989, the company laying off 260 of their 913 employees in October 1989 following a projected quarterly loss of $18 million. All told, the company lost between $45 million and $50 million in fiscal year 1989—ten times more than they had lost in 1988.: 2D \n\n\n=== As Apertus Technology (1990–1997) ===\nIn February 1990, Lee Data sold their data terminal assets to Intelligent Information Systems, Inc., of Hackensack, New Jersey, for $8 million. Simultaneous with this announcement, founder John Lee announced his resignation as chairman, CEO, and president. In July 1990, Lee Data changed their name to Apertus Technologies, Inc., reflecting a full-time pivot to terminal emulation software for which they massively downsized, going from 650 employees in February 1990 to 275 employees in July 1990.\nUnder their new CEO Robert Gordon, Apertus made a dramatic recovery. By 1994, they had become the second most popular terminal emualtor vendor, cornering 25 percent of that market share and earning a profit of $4.5 million on revenues of $26.9 million.\n\n\n=== As Apertus Technology (1997–2000) ===\nBetween October and November 1997, Apertus sold off their terminal emulation assets to Computer Network Technology Corporation of Plymouth, Massachusetts, for $11.4 million. Simultaneously, they acquired the Carleton Corporation of Minneapolis, a developer of data warehousing software. They later adopted Carleton as a trade name.: D1 \nIn 2000, Apertus (doing business as Carleton) was purchased by Oracle Corporation for $8.7 million in a stock swap.: D1 \n\n\n== Further reading ==\nGross, Steve (March 26, 1984). \"Lee Data chief forsees more success\".

        "content": "Antonio Baschenis (documented from 1450 to 1470 to 1475) was an Italian painter, belonging to one of the most popular workshops of itinerant painters present in the Bergamo area and in Trentino.\n\nThe Baschenis family, originally from the hamlet of Colla in the mountain municipality of Santa Brigida (BG), constitutes an interesting example of a fresco painter's workshop who, starting in the mid-15th century, handed down their trade from father to son for centuries.\nAntonio was the brother of Angelo, a scion of the so-called Lanfranco dynasty, one of the two strains of the family. Son of Giacomo and nephew of Lanfranco, in 1451 he hadave a shop near the church of San Michele all'arco in Bergamo.\nHe was the first of the Baschenis to move to Trentino, where, in 1461, he received a commission to decorate the right wall of the church of Santo Stefano in Carisolo in fresco. The decorative apparatus includes a Last Supper and in the lower register two Madonnas enthroned with children and figures of saints (from the left we find a saint identifiable, due to the presence of the \"vexillum Regis,\"  with Saint Ursula), followed by two panels with couples of saints, Saint Sebastian and San Giuliano, Anthony the Great and Santo Stefano, then Bernardino of Siena, and finally a saint who is not easy to identify.\nIt cannot be excluded that this last figure represents Saint Bridget of Sweden, which arises from the presence of the thin and elongated stick, surmounted by the cross used as an iconographic element.\nAntonio appears to have already died between 1470 and 1475; consider the homonymy of these artists, which makes it difficult not only to assign the different works but also to recognize that the Scipioni family was the same as the Baschenis. Antonio had three sons: Bartolomeo, Battista, and Giacomo, probably also the authors of some works.\nIn Trentino, Antonio Baschenis worked inside the church of San Vigilio in Pinzolo and in the church of Mione, a hamlet in the municipality of Rumo, where he painted the Madonna and Child with Saint Catherine, signed and dated 1480.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

Kimiyo mixes spoken word in English and Japanese and atmospheric melodies. It is set to release on April 26, 2024.It is one of four creative projects including two albums, \"Kimiyo\" and \"A Measure of Space and Sounds\", the film \"Voyage à la Mer\", and live conversations and musical improvisation \"Of Flashes and Other Currents\", all planned to release in 2024.This project is Alex Henry Foster's first release under artist management company In De Goot Entertainment, since establishing their partnership in 2023.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn February 2023, Alex Henry Foster underwent cardiac surgery, postponing his musical projects and tours with his band The Long Shadows. During this recovery period, he envisioned working on a project he had started in Japan in 2010.\nHis trip was prompted by a letter he had received from the parents of a fan, with whom he had gotten acquainted before he took his life. Foster went to meet with this young man's parents and traveled to Tokyo to further discuss grief, hope, sorrow, and dreams.This meeting and 2010 trip to Japan also inspired creative endeavors that were postponed throughout the years, until this new album and cinematographic project “Voyage à La Mer”.\n\n\n== Recording and composition ==\nUnable to sing or speak, due to the surgery procedures he underwent, Foster invited his artist friend Momoka to sing and recite spoken word in Japanese to accompany the music. Ben Lemelin assisted Foster in the music composition and writing process of the album.Foster said: \"I have always been looking for a pretext or an excuse to work with Momoka... She’s got a very unique spirit, and she’s a very inspiring and insightful person. We have a common view about life in general and spirituality in particular, but most of all, she is a fantastic artist for whom I have the utmost admiration.\"The writing and recording of the album took place at the Highlands Studios, located in Foster's home in the mountains of Virginia. Lemelin and Momoka joined him there to work on the project.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nAll tracks are written by Alex Henry Foster and co-written, recorded, and produced by Ben Lemelin.\n\nA Silent Stream\n“A Silent Stream“ is the album's debut single, released with the announcement on March 27, 2024, with an official lyric video. The Moroccan newspaper Le Matin described it as “an immersive experience, marked by reflection and contemplation\".This track is described on post-punk.com as “a contemplative journey within ourselves, designed for us to discover the purpose of days passing by, beyond the illusion of control over 'time' and the meanings we'd like to believe in.”Nocturnal Candescence\nReleased on April 10, 2024, “Nocturnal Candescence”, is the second single from the album Kimiyo. Foster stated: “The song conveys the profound emotions of loss, hopelessness, and personal surrender in the context of self-abandonment.” It is also related to the traditional Japanese songs of longing, “哀傷歌 (aishōka)”, about mourning, contemplation, and faith in better days.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Thomas de Pinedo (1614 – 13 November 1679), also known as Isaac de Pinedo, was a Jewish scholar best known for his detailed commentary on Stephan of Byzantium's Ethnica.\n\n\n== Life ==\nThomas was born in 1614 in Trancoso, Beira Province, Portugal, during the period of the Iberian Union. His father was from the noble family of Pinheiro and his mother from the Jewish Fonseca. He was also a relative of the converso or marrano poet Miguel de Silveyra. Thomas left Trancoso to live with his uncle in Madrid, Spain. While there, he studied at the Jesuit Imperial College, where he learned Latin and Greek.\nPinedo fled to the Dutch Republic to escape the Inquisition. (Miguel was similarly forced to flee to the Kingdom of Naples.) While praising his education and avoiding censure of Christianity itself, he pointedly criticized the Inquisition and its supporters, comparing them to the Athenian Areopagus and once writing \"I am ashamed and reproach myself for having been useful to such Christians\". Joining the Dutch Jewish community, he began to go by the name Ishac or Isaac de Pinedo and opposed the philosophy of his contemporary Spinoza. He completed his edition of Stephan's Ethnica with Latin translation and commentary while in the city, publishing it under his former name Thomas. He dedicated the work to Gaspar Ibáñez de Segovia, historian, bibliophile, and consort marquis of Mondejar.He died on 13 November 1679 in Amsterdam in the Dutch Republic. De Segovia later wrote to the converso poet Miguel de Barrios of his regret that Pinedo had died without converting from Judaism to Christianity.\n\n\n== Works ==\nPinedo is best known for his edition of Stephan of Byzantium's Ethnica, which he provided in Greek with a parallel Latin translation and commentary, including numerous citations from Jewish historians and travelers such as Josephus and Benjamin of Tudela.\nStephan (1678), Περὶ Πόλεων [De Urbibus, On Cities] (in Ancient Greek), Amsterdam: Jacobus de Jonghe.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===",

The organization was established on July 18, 2018, by He Anquan and Wang Limin in New York City. The party's flag was inspired by the Shanghai International Settlement.\n\n\n== Founder ==\nHe Anquan (Chinese: 何岸泉; pinyin: Hé Ànquán), the party's founder, told The Wall Street Journal that he was named Zhang Min when he was born in Shanghai. His grandmother died in the Chinese Civil War, and his grandfather died during the Cultural Revolution. He immigrated to the United States after the Tiananmen square massacre and later became a citizen in 2010.\n\n\n== Movement ==\nOn August 10, 2018, a party advertisement appeared in the North American Daily. On August 29, tha party issued an \"Emergency statement\", claiming party member Hu Chenyi was arrested and sentenced to death via electric chair upon return to Shanghai. Later that year, the party was registered as a nonprofit organization in New York. The party has since organized multiple anti-Beijing demonstrations in Chinatown, Queens along with Urugers, Xinjiang, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Falun Gong activists. Vice president of the Uyghur American Association (UAA), Yi Lixia, donated one million dollars to the party in support.\nIn August 2019, the party hosted the \"Anti-communist Independence Movement Convention\" with the UAA at Capitol Hill.\nOn June 18, 2020, the party hosted the \"Acceleration of Chinese Collapse\" award ceremony at Times Square, using performance art to mock CCP Chairman Xi Jinping. During the event, He said, \"Dictatorship will now make China strong again, it will only make China collapse quicker.\"\nAfter former president of Taiwan Lee Teng-hui's death in July 2020, He released a video in memory. In the video, the sign of the Taiwan consulate at New York City was changed to \"Republic of China embassy at New York City\". The Taiwanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded by clarifying that the sign was photoshopped in a press release.\n\nHe started a fundraiser for Hong Kong nationalist movements who fled after the passing of its National Security Law in November.\nHe visited Ukraine after the start of the 2022 invasion.\nDuring the Shanghai lockdown in 2022, He claimed that the quarantine methods were a genocide of Shanghainese citizens. Members of the party organized a hunger strike at the Chinese consulate in April.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHong Kong Localist camp\nLocal ethnic nationalism\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTwitter",

Inaugurated in 2009, it is dedicated to all members of the Peruvian Armed Forces that were killed in action during the Peruvian conflict's main stage, which took place between 1980 and 2000.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe monument was inaugurated in a ceremony that took place on May 8, 2009, by Alan García during his second term as president of Peru. Also attending the ceremony were Defence Minister Ántero Flores Aráoz, Interior Minister Mercedes Cabanillas and high-ranking members of the Armed Forces of Peru.\nThe monument was erected to honour 4,357 Peruvians identified as \"defenders of democracy\" who died fighting \"terrorist lunacy\" during the Peruvian conflict's main stage, which took place between the years 1980 and 2000. The number includes 1,513 political authorities and leaders, and members of the Rondas campesinas; 1,397 members of the National Police, 1,307 members of the Peruvian Army, 127 of the Peruvian Navy and 13 of the Peruvian Air Force.\nThe obelisk features an eternal flame.\nSimilarly, a park of the same name was built in Salaverry Avenue, next to Heroes of Independence Park in Jesús María.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGovernment Palace, Peru\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Quemados case (Spanish: Caso Quemados) is the name given to the attack against two protesters by an army patrol on July 2, 1986, in Santiago, Chile during manifestations against the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet.\nA group of soldiers led by Pedro Fernández Dittus, that was patrolling the streets during the Days of National Protest (Jornadas de Protesta Nacional) stopped, hit and after wetting them with a flammable liquid, lit on fire two young people: Carmen Gloria Quintana and the photographer Rodrigo Rojas de Negri. After the attack, the victims were transferred to a remote site in the Quilicura commune on the outskirts of the city. Rojas died of his burns while Carmen survived, but with heavy burns. Due to the cruelty of the crime and the absurd judicial process associated with it the event received widespread attention and provoked protests in Chile and on an international level.\n\n\n== The events ==\nThe opposition to Augusto Pinochet had great hopes that 1986 would be \"The Year of Victory\" and scheduled a series of Days of National Protest (Jornadas de Protesta Nacional) that were to be combined with a national strike on July 2 and 3. In almost every town, opposition political groups prepared themselves. The government's response was to send the military to patrol the streets.\nIn the neighborhood of Los Nogales, in the commune of Estación Central of Santiago, a small group of people was setting up barricades in a strategic sector, during the morning of July 2. Photographer Rodrigo Rojas de Negri, who provided services for an international agency that covered the strike, was following the group. At 8 in the morning the group of the protestors were intercepted on the corner of the General Velásquez Avenue and Germán Yungue Street by a military patrol under the command of Pedro Fernández Dittus and made up of 3 civilians, 5 non-commissioned officers and 17 soldiers. Most of the young protestors managed to escape, except Quintana and Rojas de Negri.\nThe soldiers doused the detainees with gasoline and set them on fire. With both youths on fire and unconscious, they were wrapped them in blankets, and loaded them into a military vehicle which took them to an isolated road, about 20 kilometers from the capital. Once there, they threw them into an irrigation ditch, assuming they would die. Later they were found by agricultural workers and taken to the Central Post Office for treatment.\n\nRojas de Negri died four days later due to his injuries but Quintana was transferred to the Workers' Hospital on July 6. Rojas de Negri died four days later due to the severity of his injuries. Quintana, however, was transferred to the Workers' Hospital on July 6. Despite the second and third degree burns she suffered on 62% of her body, with many broken teeth (transiting between life and death for weeks), she ultimately survived. She then underwent extensive medical treatment in Chile and Canada, but she still retains a partially disfigured face as a result of her burns and scars.\n\n\n== Judicial process ==\nAlthough the official press and government pressure firstly tried to deny the crime, the claims from foreign governments and human rights organizations lead to the judicial examination of the case with judge Alberto Echavarría Lorca being appointed to investigate. On the 23rd day of the trial  the facts who on the 23rd ruled:\na) that Rodrigo Rojas de Negri and Carmen Quintana Arancibia were detained on the 2nd of this month by a military patrol that ensured the free movement of vehicles, temporarily holding them at the place of their arrest, one next to the other and close to easily flammable elements. Combustion occurred due to a movement of the young woman and the fall and breakage of the container of one of those elements, causing serious burns to both of them and subsequently causing the death of the first; and b) that no provision was made for the immediate medical attention of those affected, but rather that they were released after a few moments in a place and in conditions not conducive to obtaining such care.\nAs a result, the judge decided to release the soldiers involved. According to Amnesty International's report that year, witnesses and victims' lawyers received death threats (three witnesses had to leave the country).In the face of criticism and pressure, a military court on January 3, 1991, only found officer Fernández Dittus guilty of negligence for denying Rojas medical assistance, but exonerated him of any responsibility in the incineration of Quintana.\nIt would only be in 1993, when the Supreme Court sentenced Fernández Dittus to 600 days in prison for his responsibility in the death from burns of Rojas de Negri and the serious burns received by Quintana. In October 2000, a court ordered that the Chilean State pay 251.7 million pesos to Carmen Gloria Quintana (about US$500,000) in compensation.\n\n\n=== Reopening of the case in 2015 ===\nIn July 2015, Minister Mario Carroza issued seven arrest warrants against military officials involved in the case. The appearance of Fernando Guzmán Espíndola, as a key witness, who was one of the conscripts of the military patrol, provided the key background to advance in the resolution of the case, indicating that it was Lieutenant Julio Castañer González who gave the order for the crime. The witness acknowledged that, at that time, he had been pressured to give a false statement to the military justice system.In March 2019, Minister Carroza convicted eleven retired military personnel for the crimes of qualified homicide, for the case of Rodrigo Rojas de Negri, and qualified homicide in the degree of frustration, for the case of Carmen Gloria Quintana. The sentence convicted Julio Ernesto Castañer González, Iván Humberto Figueroa Canobra and Nelson Fidel Medina Gálvez as perpetrators to ten years and one day in prison. While Luis Alberto Zúñiga González, Jorge Osvaldo Astorga Espinoza, Francisco Fernando Vásquez Vergara, Leonardo Antonio Riquelme Alarcón, Walter Ronny Lara Gutiérrez, Juan Ramón González Carrasco, Pedro Patricio Franco Rivas and Sergio Hernández Ávila were sentenced as accomplices to a three-year sentence and a day in prison, with the benefit of supervised release.In March 2022, the Court of Appeals of Santiago modified the sentence to increase the sentences imposed on those convicted. In relation to the perpetrators of the crimes, the sentences were modified to twenty years in prison. Meanwhile, the Court rejected the exception of res judicata that had acquitted Pedro Fernández Dittus in the first instance, who was also convicted as the author. The sentence also acquitted Luis Zúñiga González, Jorge Astorga Espinoza and Sergio Hernández Ávila.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Winona County History Center, located in Winona, Minnesota, is made up of two buildings, the historic Winona Armory and the modern Laird Norton Addition. Established in 1935 by the Winona County Historical Society, the History Center offers collections, exhibits, and programming.\n\n\n== Exhibits ==\nThe museum features three floors of exhibits including the permanent exhibits, \"Timeline of Winona County History\" and an award-winning children's exhibit \"Walking Through Time\" a hands-on experience designed for visitors children aged 6 and above that allow exploring a recreated cave, tipi, and steamboat pilot house, all representing different eras in Winona County's history. The gallery space in the Slaggie Family Lobby offers rotating exhibitions of artwork by regional artists.\n\n\n== Programming ==\nHistory on the River tours are offered in the summer, where once a month the society takes the Cal Fremling Boat, a Winona State University vessel, out on the river and offers a program during that time.\n\n\n== Laird Lucas Memorial Library and Archives ==\nThe research facility houses genealogical and historical materials, including documents, photographs, and artifacts. It serves as a  resource for  researching Winona County's past.\n\n\n== Governance ==\nThe Winona County History Center is operated by the Winona County Historical Society, a non-profit organization governed by a Board of Directors composed of community members. The Society relies on memberships, donations, and grants to support its ongoing mission of education and historical preservation.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe society was established in 1935, with its first museum located on the second floor of the Lumberman's building, now known as the Laird Norton Center for the Arts. The armory was acquired by the society for use as its museum in 1973.\n\n\n=== Laird Norton Addition ===\nThe three-story addition was designed by architect Joan Soranno and completed in 2010.  The first level features a welcoming colonnade faced with brick that complements the armory's exterior. Capping the addition is a copper-clad multipurpose room with expansive windows offering views of the Mississippi River bluffs and the downtown area.\nThe expanded the physical footprint of the History Center and allowed it to offer a wider range of programs and events.\n\n\n== Winona Armory ==\nThe Winona County History Center occupies a historic building itself. Originally constructed in 1915, the building served as the National Guard Armory until the Winona County Historical Society acquired it. The Armory's distinctive architecture, featuring castellations (decorative battlements), reflects its former military purpose. The symmetrical facade, resembling a medieval fortress, features a central \"H\" bay with an arched entrance, flanked by smaller bays with windows on multiple stories. Brick piers with round-arch slits and a corbel table top the parapet wall, giving a distinct medieval aesthetic. The 30,000-square-foot building once held a large, open room with a hardwood floor and balcony, dining room facilities, a shooting range, storage rooms and exercise rooms.\nConstructed on the brink of the First World War, this edifice served as a hub for equipment, training, and drilling activities for Company C of the Second Regiment of the Minnesota National Guard. The Armory not only served the National Guard but also functioned as a community center from its inception. Hosting dances, banquets, sporting events, and auto shows, it was a hub of social gatherings until the 1960s.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Winona County, Minnesota\nList of museums in Minnesota",

        "content": "Heroes of Independence Park (Spanish: Parque Próceres de la Independencia), originally known as Matamula Forest (Spanish: Bosque Matamula), is a public park next to Salaverry Avenue in Jesús María District, Lima.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe area where the park is located was once known as Matamula Forest, also known as Matalechuzas, after the fundo of the same name owned by Manuel Ignacio de Vivanco and inherited by his son Reynaldo, which itself took its name after the owls that lived in the area when it was part of the Viceroyalty of Peru, then owned by Martín de Iturain. After the War of the Pacific, the area was acquired by the Olavegoya family, who began the fundo's urban transformation during the 20th century.\nThe estates of \"Matalechucitas\" and \"Jesús María\" were located nearby, the former presumably at numbers 1427 and 1433 of Arnaldo Márquez Avenue, where the remains of a country house were located until their demolition in 2013.\nConstruction works for the park began in the context of the Sesquicentennial of the Independence of Peru. On July 13, 1971, the 3 ton and 4-metre tall bronze statues of Juan Pablo Vizcardo y Guzmán, Toribio Rodríguez de Mendoza, Túpac Amaru and Juan Francisco de Vidal were taken from a warehouse in Argentina Avenue to the park and installed as part of its monument, which features 17-metre tall obelisks as well as one measured at 25 metres, which features a condor, the first statue to be installed. The works were carried out with cranes owned by SIMA from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.\nThe park was officially inaugurated on July 27 of the same year in a ceremony attended by then President Juan Velasco Alvarado. It was visited in 2017 by President of Ireland Michael D. Higgins as part of his official visit, and has also been visited by other heads of state. The park closed during the COVID-19 pandemic in Peru and has since been renovated.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nSesquicentennial of the Independence of Peru\n\n\n== References ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Ancient near eastern (ANE) cosmology refers to the plurality of cosmological beliefs in the Ancient Near East (including Ancient Egypt, Babylonia, Sumer, Akkad, Ugarit, and ancient Israel and Judah) from the 4th millennium BC until the formation of the Macedonian Empire by Alexander the Great in the 4th century BC. This system of cosmology went on to have a profound influence on later views in rabbinic cosmology, patristic cosmology, and Islamic cosmology. Until the modern era, variations of ancient near eastern cosmology survived with Hellenistic cosmology as the main competing system.   \n\n\n== Key texts ==\nThe Hebrew Bible (especially in the description found in the Genesis creation narrative) undergirds known beliefs about biblical cosmology in ancient Israel and Judah. The cosmology of the other civilizations has fragmentarily survived in the form of cuneiform literature primarily in the languages of Sumerian and Akkadian, which includes texts like the Enuma Elish and the MUL.APIN. Another, albeit less abundant source of evidence, are pictorial/iconographic representations, notably including the Babylonian Map of the World. Evidentiary limitations include that the majority of surviving texts are administrative and economic in their nature, saying little about cosmology, and that formal statements about the structure of the cosmos only become known from the first millennium BC. Information about earlier periods is more dependent on gleaning information from creation myths and etiologies.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nAncient near eastern cosmology can be divided into its cosmography, the physical structure and outline of the cosmos, and cosmogony, the creation myths that describe the origins of the cosmos in the texts and traditions of the ancient near eastern world. Ancient near eastern civilizations held to a fairly uniform conception of cosmography. This cosmography remained remarkably stable in the context of the expansiveness and longevity of the ancient near east. There is evidence that Mesopotamian creation myths reached as far as Pre-Islamic Arabia.\n\n\n=== Cosmography ===\nWidely held components of ancient near eastern cosmography included: \n\na Flat Earth (likely disk-shaped)\na solid heaven (firmament), disk-shaped and floating above the Earth\na primordial cosmic ocean: the creation of the firmament separates the cosmic ocean from the Earth and forms a body of heavenly, upper waters which acts as the source of rain\nabove the upper waters lies the abode where the divine powers exist\nthe lower waters which the Earth rests on\nthe netherworld, the furthest region in the direction downwards, above which is the lower waters\nThere are cosmographical notions attributed to, but unlikely to actually have been held by, Mesopotamian cosmologies (though they may have appeared in later or other cosmological thought). These include notions of the cosmos as a ziggurat reaching up to a peak, a cosmic mountain, and a dome-(or vault-) shaped firmament instead of a flat one.\n\n\n=== Cosmogony ===\nAncient near eastern cosmogony also included a number of common features that are present in most if not all creation myths from the ancient near east. These include the organization of the world from pre-existing, unformed elements, represented by a primordial body of water; the presence of a divine creator; an antagonist or primordial monster; a battle between the forces of good and evil; the separation of the elements; and the creation of mankind. In earlier Sumerian accounts, supreme dominion over the cosmos was held by a trio of Gods in their respective domains: Anu ruled the remote heaven, Enki ruled the waters surrounding and below the Earth, and Enlil ruled the region between the great above and the great below. In later Babylonian accounts, the god Marduk alone ascends to the top rank of the pantheon and over all domains of the cosmos.\n\n\n== Cosmographies ==\n\n\n=== \"The world\" ===\nA variety of terms or phrases existed that were used to refer to the cosmos as a whole, as an equivalent of \"cosmos\" or \"universe\". This included phrases like \"heaven and earth\" or \"heaven and underworld\". Terms like \"all\" or \"totality\" similarly connoted the entire universe. These motifs can be found in temple hymns or royal inscriptions which, inside of temples whose size was in some way symbolized to reach heaven in their height or the underworld in their depths or foundations.\n\nIn Mesopotamian cosmology, heaven and Earth were themselves represented as having a tripartite structure: a Lower Heaven/Earth, a Middle Heaven/Earth, and an Upper Heaven/Earth. The Upper Earth was where humans existed. Middle Earth, corresponding to the Abzu (primeval underworldly ocean), was the residence of the god Enki. Lower Earth, the Mesopotamian underworld, was where the 600 Anunnaki gods lived, associated with the land of the dead ruled by Nergal. As for the heavens: the highest level was populated by 300 Igigi (great gods), the middle heaven belonged to the Igigi and also contained Marduk's throne, and the lower heaven was where the stars and constellations were inscribed into. Poetic speculation existed over whether the different levels of heaven were composed of different stones. In total, the extent of the Babylonian universe therefore corresponded to a total of six layers spanning across heaven and Earth. Notions of the plurality of the heavens and Earth go back, at the latest, to the 2nd millennium BC and may be elaborations on simpler cosmographies. One text that post-dates the Enuma Elish describes the cosmos as follows, also corresponding each of the three levels of heaven with a type of stone:30 “The Upper Heavens are Luludānītu stone. They belong to Anu. He (i.e. Marduk) settled the 300 Igigū (gods) inside. \n31 The Middle Heavens are Saggilmud stone. They belong to the Igīgū (gods). Bēl (i.e. Marduk) sat on the high throne within, \n32 the lapis lazuli sanctuary. And made a lamp? of electrum shine inside (it). \n33 The Lower Heavens are jasper. They belong to the stars. He drew the constellations of the gods on them. \n34 In the … …. of the Upper Earth, he lay down the spirits of mankind. \n35 [In the …] of the Middle earth, he settled Ea, his father. \n36 […..] . He did not let the rebellionbe forgotten. \n37 [In the … of the Lowe]r earth, he shut inside 600 Anunnaki. \n\n38 […….] … […. in]side jasper.Mythical bonds, akin to ropes or cables, played the role of cohesively holding the entire world and all its layers of heaven and Earth together. These are sometimes called the \"bonds of heaven and earth\". They can be referred to with terminology like durmāhu (typically referring to a strong rope made of reeds), markaṣu (referring to a rope or cable, of a boat, for example), or ṣerretu (lead-rope passed through an animals nose). A deity can hold these ropes as a symbol of their authority, such as the goddess Ishtar \"who holds the connecting link of all heaven and earth (or netherworld)\". This motif extended to descriptions of great cities like Babylon which was called the \"bond of [all] the lands,\" or Nippur which was \"bond of heaven and earth,\" and some temples as well.\nThe idea of a center to the cosmos also played a role in elevating where that center was placed and in reflecting beliefs of the finite and closed nature of the cosmos. Babylon was described as the center of the Babylonian cosmos. In parallel, Jerusalem became \"the navel of the earth\" (Ezekiel 38:12). The finite nature of the cosmos was also suggested by the periodic and regular movements of the heavenly bodies in the visible vicinity of the Earth.\n\n\n=== Firmament ===\n\nThe firmament was believed to be a solid boundary above the Earth, separating it from the upper or celestial waters. In ancient Egyptian texts, and from texts across the near east generally, it was described that the firmament had special doors or gateways on the eastern and western horizons to allow for the passage of heavenly bodies during their daily journeys. In Egyptian texts particularly, these gates also served as conduits between the earthly and heavenly realms for which righteous people could ascend. The gateways could be blocked by gates to prevent entry by the deceased as well. As such, funerary texts included prayers enlisting the help of the gods to enable the safe ascent of the dead. Ascent to the celestial realm could also be done by a celestial ladder made by the gods. Multiple stories exist in Mesopotamian texts whereby certain figures ascend to the celestial realm and are given the secrets of the gods.\nFour different Egyptian models are known for the nature of the firmament and/or the heavenly realm. One was that of a bird: the firmament above represented the underside of a flying falcon, with the sun and moon representing its eyes, and its flapping causes the wind that humans experience. The second was a cow, known from a text known as the Book of the Heavenly Cow. The cosmos is a giant celestial cow represented by the goddess Nut or Hathor. The cow consumed the sun in the evening and rebirthed it in the next morning. The third is a celestial woman, also represented by Nut. The heavenly bodies would travel across her body from east to west. The midriff of Nut was supported by Shu (the air god) and Geb (the earth god) lied out stretched between the arms and feet of Nut. Nut consumes the celestial bodies from the west and gives birth to them again in the following morning. The stars are inscribed across the belly of Nut and one needs to identify with one of them, or a constellation, in order to join them after death. The fourth model was a flat (or slightly convex) celestial plane which in different texts is said to be supported in various ways: by pillars, or staves, scepters, or mountains at the extreme ends of the Earth. The four supports give rise to the motif of the \"four corners of the world\".\nSome texts describe seven heavens and seven earths, but within the Mesopotamian context, this is likely to refer to a totality of the cosmos with some sort of magical or numerological significance, as opposed to a description of the structural number of heavens and Earth. Israelite texts do not mention the notion of seven heavens or earths.\n\n\n=== Earth ===\n\nThe ancient near eastern Earth was flat and likely disk-shaped. A common honorific that many kings and rulers ascribed to themselves was that they were the rulers of the four quarters (or corners) of the Earth. For example, Hammurabi (ca. 1810–1750 BC) received the title of \"King of Sumer and Akkad, King of the Four Quarters of the World\". Monarchs of the Assyrian empire like Ashurbanipal also took on this title. (Although the title implies a square or rectangular shape, in this case it is taken to refer to the four quadrants of a circle which is joined at the worlds center.) Likewise, the 'four corners' motif would also appear in some biblical texts, like Isaiah 11:12.\nThe cosmography of the Earth is pictorially elucidated by the Babylonian Map of the World. Here, the city Babylon is near the Earth's center and it is on the Euphrates river. Other kingdoms and cities surround it. The world is flat and circular and it is surrounded by a bitter salt-water ocean. The north is covered by an enormous mountain range, akin to a wall. In the Epic of Gilgamesh, Gilgamesh journeys past this mountain range to an area that can only be accessed by gods and other heroes.\n\n\n=== Heavenly bodies ===\n\nMesopotamian cosmology would differ from the practice of astronomy in terms of terminology: for astronomers, the word \"firmament\" was not used but instead \"sky\" to describe the domain in which the heavenly affairs were visible. The stars were located on the firmament, arranged by Marduk himself into constellations to depict the images of the gods. The fixation of these stars also organized the year into 12 months. Each month was marked by the rising of three stars along specified paths. The moon and zenith were also created. Creation and characterization of other phenomena, including lunar phases and an overall lunar scheme,  precise paths and the rising and setting of the stars, stations of the planets, and more, occurred. An alternative account of the creation of the heavenly bodies is offered in the Babyloniaca of Berossus, where Bel (Marduk) creates stars, sun, moon, and the five (known) planets; the planets here do not help guide the calendar (a lack of concern for the planets also shared in the Book of the Courses of the Heavenly Luminaries, a subsection of 1 Enoch). Concern for the establishment of the calendar by the creation of heavenly bodies as visible signs is shared in at least seven other Mesopotamian texts. A Sumerian inscription of Kudur-Mabuk, for example, reads \"The reliable god, who interchanges day and night, who establishes the month, and keeps the year intact.\" Another example is to be found in the Exaltation of Inanna.\nThe word \"star\" (kakkabu) was inclusive to all celestial bodies, stars, constellations, and planets. A more specific concept for planets existed, however, to distinguish them from the stars: unlike the stars fixed into their location, the planets were observed to move. By the 3rd millennium BC, the planet Venus was identified as the astral form of the goddess Inanna (or Ishtar), and motifs such as the morning and evening star were applied to her. Jupiter became Marduk (hence the name \"Marduk Star\", also called Nibiru), Mercury was the \"jumping one\" (in reference to its comparatively fast motion and low visibility) associated with the gods Ninurta and Nabu, and Mars was the god of pestilence Nergal and thought to portend evil and death. Saturn was also sinister. The most obvious characteristic of the stars were their luminosity and their study for the purposes of divination, solving calendrical calculations, and predictions of the appearances of planets, led to the discovery of their periodic motion. From 600 BC onwards, the study of the relative periodicity between their bodies began to be studied.\n\n\n=== Upper waters ===\n\nAbove the firmament was a large, cosmic body of water which may be referred to as the cosmic ocean or celestial waters. In the Tablet of Shamash, the throne of the sun god Shamash is depicted as resting above the cosmic ocean. The waters are above the solid firmament that covers the sky. Mesopotamian cosmology held that the upper waters were the waters of Tiamat, contained by Tiamat's stretched out skin. Egyptian texts depict the sun god sailing across these upper waters. Some also convey that this body of water is the heavenly equivalent of the Nile River.\n\n\n=== Lower waters ===\n\nBoth Babylonian and Israelite texts describe one of the divisions of the cosmos as the underworldly ocean. In Babylonian texts, this is coincided with the region/god Abzu. In Sumerian mythology, this realm was created by Enki. It was also where Enki lived and ruled over. Due to the connection with Enki, the lower waters were associated with wisdom and incantational secret knowledge. In Egyptian mythology, the personification of this subterranean body of water was instead Nu. The notion of a cosmic body of water below the Earth was inferred from the realization that much water used for irrigation came from under the ground, from springs, and that springs were not limited to any one part of the world. Therefore, a cosmic body of water acting as a common source for the water coming out of all these springs was conceived.\n\n\n=== Underworld ===\n\nThe underworld, or the netherworld, was the lowest of all the regions, below Abzu. It was geographically in parallel with the plane of human existence, but was so low that both demons and gods could not descend to it. It was, however, inhabited by beings such as ghosts, demons, and gods. The land was depicted as dark and distant: this is because it was the opposite of the human world and so did not have light, water, fields, and so forth.\n\n\n== Cosmogonies ==\n\n\n=== Overview ===\nThe creation myths conceive and explain the origins of the two fundamental parts of the cosmos, the heaven and the Earth, as resulting from a separation from what was first one single mass. In one myth known as Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Netherworld, in the introduction says that heaven is carried off from the earth by the sky god Anu and becomes the possession of the wind god Enlil. Nammu is the original mother that gave birth to the great undifferentiated mass that would eventually become the heaven and earth. The heaven and earth could represent the father (heaven) and earth (mother). The sky has generative power, and the rain is a representation of semen that falls upon the Earth allowing it to give rise/birth to vegetation. An alternative cosmogony represented the heaven and earth as gods that originated as the distinct offspring of other gods and not as originating from a separation of an earlier unseparated mass. An example of this is in the great Akkadian creation poem, the Enuma Elish.\n\n\n=== Separation of heaven and Earth ===\nThe idea that heaven and Earth were originally joined and then separated is widespread in widespread in ancient near eastern cosmology, going back at least to the 3rd millennium BC, and appears not only in Sumerian and Akkadian mythology, but also Phoenician, Egyptian, and likely early Greek cosmology too. There are two strands of Mesopotamian creation myths regarding the original separation of the heavens and earth. The first, older one, is evinced from texts in the Sumerian language from the 3rd millennium BC and the first half of the 2nd millennium BC. In these sources, the heavens and Earth are separated from an original solid mass. In the younger tradition known from texts in the Akkadian language, such as the Enuma Elish, the separation occurs from an original water mass. The former usually has the leading gods of the Sumerian pantheon, the King of Heaven Anu and the King of Earth Enlil, separating the mass over a time-frame of \"long days and nights\", similar to the timeframe given in the Genesis creation narrative (six days and nights). Genesis also parallels another version of these stories where a primordial darkness pervades prior to the creation of light. The Sumerian texts do not mention the creation of the cosmic waters but it may be surmised that water was one of the primordial elements.\n\n\n=== Origins of the gods ===\nAll gods descend from an original male–female pair known as Enki and Ninki, whose names literally mean \"Lord and Lady Earth\". The primordial Enki is not to be confused with the god of wisdom, who is also named Enki. Sources also differentiate between the inanimate matter from which the universe was made and the soul-like substance permeating living creates like gods and humans. In the Akkadian tradition, the primordial universe is alive and animate, made of Abzu (male deity of the fresh waters) and Tiamat (female sea goddess). The waters mingle to create the next generations of deities.\n\n\n=== Atra-Hasis ===\n\nThe Atra-Hasis does not say much about the origins of the cosmos, but is instead more of a history of mankind as it begins with the universe already existing in its present state and seeks to explain how man was originally created. Atra-Hasis refers begins with humans being created by the mother goddess Mami to lighten the gods' workload. She made them out of a mixture of clay, flesh, and blood from a slain god. Later in the story though, the god Enlil attempts to control overpopulation of humans through various methods, including famine, drought, and finally, a great flood. Mankind is saved by Atrahasis, who was warned of the flood by the god Enki and built a boat to escape the waters, eventually placating the gods with sacrifices.\n\n\n=== Eridu Genesis ===\n\nEridu Genesis has a similar plot to Atra-Hasis, but the tablets it is known from is badly damaged. The surviving portion of the text begins by recounting how the gods created the Sumerians and comfortable conditions for their animals. The office of kingship descends from heaven and the first cities are created. After a missing section, it appears that the gods have decided to flood the world but not spare humans from it. Zi-ud-sura, the king and gudug priest, discovers this (or is informed of it by Ea in a later Akkadian version). He builds an ark. Another missing section occurs and Ziusudra turns out to have survived.\n\n\n=== Enuma Elish and related earlier cosmogonies ===\n\nThe Enuma Elish is the most famous Mesopotamian creation story and was widely known in among learned circles across Mesopotamia, and it went on to influence both art and ritual. The story is preserved foremost in seven clay tablets discovered from the Library of Ashurbanipal in Nineveh. The creation myth seeks to describes how the god Marduk created the world from the body of the sea monster Tiamat after defeating her in battle, after which Marduk ascends to the top of the heavenly pantheon. The creation account in this source is the earliest complete Mesopotamian creation account. Earlier cosmogonies must be reconstructed from disparate sources.\nThe following is a synopsis of the account. The primordial universe is alive and animate, made of Abzu (male deity of the fresh waters) and Tiamat (female sea goddess). The waters mingle to create the next generations of deities. A series of controversies lead to the death of both Abzu and Tiamat with the emergence of Marduk at the top of the heavenly pantheon. Marduk creates the cosmos, humanity, and sets up a divine capital at BabylonBut the noisiness of the younger gods leads Abzu to try to kill them: he is stopped and in turn himself killed by the god Ea, who is the Akkadian equivalent of the Sumerian god Enki. This eventually results in a battle between Tiamat and the son of Ea, Marduk. Marduk kills Tiamat and fashions the cosmos, including the heavens and Earth, from Tiamat's corpse. Tiamat's breasts are used to make the mountains and Tiamat's eyes are used to open the sources of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Parts of the watery body were used to create parts of the world including its wind, rain, mist, and rivers. Marduk forms the heavenly bodies including the sun, moon, and stars to produce periodic astral activity that is the basis for the calendar, before finally setting up the cosmic capital at Babylon. Marduk attains universal kingship and the Tablet of Destinies. Tiamat's helper Kingu is also slain and his life force is used to animate the first human beings.\nThe Enuma Elish shares continuity with earlier creation myths like the Myth of Anzû. In both stories, a dragon (Anzu or Tiamat) steals the Tablet of Destinies from Enlil, the chief god and in response, the chief god looks for someone to slay the dragon. Then, in both stories, a champion among the gods is chosen to fight the dragon (Ninurta or Marduk) after two or three others before them reject the offer to fight. The champion wins, after which he is acclaimed and given many names. The Enuma Elish may have also drawn from the myth of the Ninurta and the dragon Kur. The dragon is formerly responsible for holding up the primordial waters. Upon being killed, the waters begin to rise; this problem is solved by Ninurta heaping stones upon them until the waters are held back. Another myth involves Enlil fighting against the sea monster Labbu. As in the Enuma Elish, Enlil only fights when another god fails to. Both Enlil in his fight against Labbu and Marduk in his fight against Tiamat use the wind and storm in order to defeat their enemy. Traditions of the combat between Marduk and Tiamat may also be rooted in Western Semitic stories of the battle between the thunderstorm god Baal and the sea god Yam. Like Baal, Marduk was also originally a storm god, and the fight between these gods symbolizes combat between the forces of nature. One of the most significant differences, however, of the Enuma Elish over earlier creation myths was in its exaltation of Marduk as the highest god. In prior myths, Ea was the chief god and creator of mankind.\n\n\n=== Babyloniaca of Berossus ===\n\nThe first book of the Babyloniaca of the Babylonian priest Berossus, composed in the third century BC, offers a variant (or, perhaps, an interpretation) of the cosmogony of the Enuma Elish. This work is not extant but survives in later quotations and abridgements. Berossus' account begins with a primeval ocean. Unlike in the Enuma Elish, where sea monsters are generated for combat with other gods, in Berossus' account, they emerge by spontaneous generation and are described in a different manner to the 11 monsters of the Enuma Elish, as it expands beyond the purely mythical creatures of that account in a potential case of influence from Greek zoology. Surviving fragments of Berossus now record two different versions of the cosmic battle event that is followed by an act of creation. Both variants may both go back to Berossus. According to Beaulieu, the first one reads:(BNJ 680 1b: 7) When everything was arranged in this way, Belus rose up and split the woman in two. Of one half of her he made earth, of the other half sky; and he destroyed all creatures in her. He says that this was an allegorical discourse on nature, for when everything was moist and creatures came into being in it, this god took off his own head and the other gods mixed the blood that flowed out with earth and formed men. For this reason they are intelligent and share in divine wisdom.And the second one:(BNJ 680 1b: 8) Belus, whom they translate as Zeus, cut the darkness in half and separated earth and sky from each other and ordered the universe. The creatures could not endure the power of the light and were destroyed. When Belus saw the land empty and barren, he ordered one of the gods to cut off his own head and to mix the blood that flowed out with earth and to form men and wild animals that were capable of enduring the air.The conclusion of the account states that Belus then created the stars, sun, moon, and five planets. Both variant accounts largely agree with the Enuma Elish but also contain a number of differences, such as the statement about allegorical exegesis, the self-decapitation of Belus in order to create humans, and the statement that it is the divine blood which has made humans intelligent. Some debate has ensued about which elements of these may or may not go back to the original account of Berossus.\n\n\n=== Other cosmogonies ===\nAdditional minor texts also present varying cosmogonical details. The Bilingual Creation of the World by Marduk describes the construction of Earth as a raft over the cosmic waters by Marduk. An Akkadian text called The Worm describes a series of creation events: first Heaven creates Earth, Earth creates the Rivers, and eventually, the worm is created at the end of the series and it goes to live in the root of the tooth that is removed during surgery.\n\n\n== Influence ==\n\n\n=== Survival ===\nCopies from the Sippar Library indicate the Enuma Elish was copied into Seleucid times. One Hellenistic-era Babylonian priest, Berossus, wrote a Greek text about Mesopotamian traditions called the Babyloniaca (History of Babylon). The text survives mainly in fragments, especially by quotations in Eusebius in the fourth-century. The first book contains an account of Babylonian cosmology and, though concise, contains a number of echoes of the Enuma Elish. The creation account of Berossus is attributed to the divine messenger Oannes in the period after the global flood and is derivative of the Enuma Elish but also has significant variants to it. Babylonian cosmology also received treatments by the lost works of Alexander Polyhistor and Abydenus. The last known evidence for reception of the Enuma Elish is in the writings of Damascius (462–538), who had a well-informed source. As such, some learned circles in late antiquity continued to know the Enuma Elish. Echoes of Mesopotamian cosmology more generally continue until at least the 11th century.\n\n\n=== Zoroastrian cosmology ===\n\nThe earliest Zoroastrian sources describe a tripartite sky, with an upper heaven where the sun exists, a middle heaven where the moon exists, and a lower heaven where the stars exist and are fixed. Significant work has been done on comparing this cosmography to ones present in Mesopotamian, Greek, and Indian parallels. In light of evidence which has emerged in recent decades, the present view is that this idea entered into Zoroastrian thought through Mesopotamian channels of influence. Another influence is that the name that one of the planets took on in Middle Persian literature, Kēwān (for Saturn), was derived from the Akkadian language.\n\n\n=== Greek cosmology ===\nEarly Greek cosmology was closely related to the broader domain of ancient near eastern cosmology, as is reflected by works from the 8th century BC such as the Theogony of Hesiod and the works of Homer. The flat Earth was surrounded by an ocean with a flat and solid firmament above supported by pillars. This basic conception would be modified by the advent of the observation and studies by the Ionian School of philosophy at the city of Miletus from the 6th to 4th centuries BC. Later on, a more systematic and entirely different Hellenistic system of cosmology would appear in the works of authors like Aristotle and the astronomer Ptolemy.\n\n\n=== Patristic cosmology ===\n\nChristian texts were familiar with ancient near eastern cosmology insofar as it had shaped the Genesis creation narrative. A genre of literature emerged among Jews and Christians dedicated to the composition of texts commenting precisely on this narrative to understand the cosmos and its origins: these works are called Hexaemeron. The first extant example is the De opificio mundi (\"On the Creation of the World\") by the first-century Jewish philosopher Philo of Alexandria. However, it would not be until the fourth century when the genre was revived and popularized by the Hexaemeron of Basil of Caesarea, written in 378, after which numerous works were composed including among Basil's own contemporaries. Among Syrian authors, Jacob of Serugh was the first to produce his own Hexaemeron in the early sixth century, and he was followed later by Jacob of Edessa's Hexaemeron in the first years of the eighth century.\n\n\n=== Rabbinic cosmology ===\nThe primary influence that ancient near eastern cosmology continued to have on subsequent civilizations and traditions was by the form it had taken on in the Genesis creation narrative. For example, rabbinic cosmology as described by the authors of rabbinic literature borrowed its fundamental grasp of the cosmos from ancient near eastern cosmology.\n\n\n=== Islamic cosmology ===\nThe Quran conceives of the primary elements of the ancient near eastern cosmography, such as the division of the cosmos into the heavens and the Earth, a solid firmament, upper waters, a flat Earth, and seven heavens. As with rabbinic cosmology, however, these elements were not directly transmitted from ancient near eastern civilization. Instead, work in the field of Quranic studies has identified the primary historical context for the reception of these ideas to have been in the Christian and Jewish cosmologies of late antiquity. This conception of the cosmos was carried on into the traditionalist cosmologies that were held in the caliphate, though with a few nuances that appear to have emerged.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAncient Mesopotamian religion\nHexaemeron\nMandaean cosmology\nQuranic studies\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nAl-Jallad, Ahmad (2015). \"Echoes of the Baal Cycle in a Safaito-Hismaic Inscription\".

        "content": "\"Me Voy \" (English: \"I'm Leaving\") is a song by the American music group Aventura with the participation of Dominican musician El Prodigio. It is the eleventh track from their third studio album Love & Hate (2003). Despite being a bachata group, it is a merengue song.\n\n\n== Héctor Acosta version ==\nIn 2006, Dominican singer Héctor Acosta released a cover in bachata of the song as his a single for his debut solo album, Sigo Siendo Yo (2006). The song became a huge success and one of Acosta's signature songs. On September 1, 2007, Acosta performed the song with Aventura at their sold-out Madison Square Garden concert. It is featured in the group's third concert film and live studio album, Kings of Bachata: Sold Out at Madison Square Garden (2007). In 2008, Acosta released a remix with the group's lead singer Romeo Santos as a remix of the bachata cover and it is part of Acosta's second studio solo album, Mitad / Mitad (2008).\n\n\n== Chart performance ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Love Me and the World Is Mine is an American ballad published in 1906 with music by Ernest R. Ball, and lyrics by Dave Reed Jr. The original recordings from the 1900s by various singers are now in the public domain (United States) per the Music Modernization Act.\n\n\n== History ==\nThis ballad was first introduced at Proctor's 5th Avenue (New York City) in 1906 during a Vaudeville performance. Featuring Ernest Ball's second wife Maude Lambert as the singer, the song was a huge success, and went on to sell a million record copies. M. Witmark & Sons took note of the song's popularity and decided to elevate Ball under a twenty-year contract as staff composer. It was further popularized from recordings by leading singers/groups of the time later that same year (1906). Canadian singer Henry Burr had a hit recording of the song, Albert Campbell's version topped the charts for 8 weeks, and Harry Anthony's for a week. The song was later revived by the Haydn Quartet in 1908. Love Me and the World Is Mine has since been used in several movie musicals which include San Francisco (1936), The Strawberry Blonde (1941), Irish Eyes Are Smiling (1944), and The Eddie Cantor Story (1953).. Variety magazine, in a fifty-year commemorative issue, selected Love Me and the World Is Mine for its \"Hit Parade of a Half-Century (1905–1955)\" list for 1906. The song has also \"become a favorite\" among the quartets of the Barbershop Harmony Society.\n\n\n== Lyrics ==\n\nLove Me and the World Is Mine uses common 4/4 verses while the \"unusually short\" chorus is set to 12/8 time. The lyrics used are described by author Don Tyler as \"rather antiquated\" and gives \"twould\", \"Yet lo' dear heart\", \"tis only thee\" and \"be mine for aye\" as examples of this in the song.\n\n\n== Recordings ==\nColumbia #3499 - Henry Burr\nVictor #4823 - Albert Campbell\nVictor #5291 - Even Williams\nVictor #5416 - Harry Macdonough (solo)\nVictor #5437 - Haydn Quartet\nEdison #9371 - Harry Anthony\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Asas Linhas Aéreas, stylized as ASAS Linhas Aéreas, is a Brazilian startup cargo airline headquartered in São José dos Campos, São Paulo. The airline was founded in 2020 and is currently in the final phase of certification with the National Civil Aviation Agency of Brazil (ANAC). \n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nThe process of creating the new airline dates back to 2016, when a group of former employees from several Brazilian airlines, such as Varig and VASP, led by Orlando Menezes Silva, decided to create ASAS Linhas Aéreas to enter the Brazilian domestic market. The process, however, remained dormant until mid-2019, when it moved forward again, transferring its headquarters to São José dos Campos, in São Paulo.\n\n\n=== Establishment ===\nThe creation of ASAS Linhas Aéreas began to take shape in May 2020, when the new airline announced the hiring of pilots with experience in Boeing 727. Later, in June, it registered with ANAC the aeronautical registration and ownership of its first plane, the Boeing 727-200F reg. PR-IOC (MSN 22984), previously operated by RIO Linhas Aéreas and Sideral Linhas Aéreas.\n\nOn January 7, 2021, the chief executive officer (CEO) of ASAS Linhas Aéreas, Orlando Menezes Silva, accompanied by the pilot José Antônio Baptista, chief operating officer (COO), and Hélio Oliveira, chief maintenance officer (CMO), officially presented the project to create the newest Brazilian cargo airline. According to them, the airline's intention was to begin operations in March of the same year, as soon as its first Boeing 727 was airworthy again and ready to return to the skies after completing a heavy maintenance process (Check-C).\nBetween January 15 and November 9, 2021, the aircraft remained undergoing maintenance at Afonso Pena International Airport, in Curitiba, where it had been stored for a few years after the bankruptcy of its owner. The entire maintenance process was shared by ASAS Linhas Aéreas through its social networks, updating the public on the progress of work on the Boeing 727, given the great expectation of seeing it fly again.\n\n\n==== Partnership with Americanas ====\nIn October 2021, ASAS Linhas Aéreas entered into a partnership with the Brazilian holding company Americanas, one of the largest retail and e-commerce companies in the country, to transport goods between distribution centers in São Paulo, Recife and Salvador da Bahia, from the hub at São José dos Campos Airport. To celebrate the partnership, the first ASAS Boeing 727, which was in Curitiba in the final phase of maintenance, received a special livery with the retailer's logo. \n\nOn November 9, 2021, the Boeing 727 registration PR-IOC in Americanas livery was officially delivered to ASAS Linhas Aéreas, flying between Curitiba and the airline's headquarters in São José dos Campos, where it was received with a water salute in an event that was attended by airline and retailer executives, press and local authorities. At the time, the airline presented its plans to incorporate two more aircraft of the model during 2022, including the possibility of one of them being configured in the passenger version for charter flights.\nOn November 30, 2021, the company changed plans and decided to send the Boeing 727 for heavy maintenance (Check-5C) and painting in the JH Aviation hangar located at Brasília International Airport. Initially, the airline's intention was to carry it out in São José dos Campos, at DIGEX MRO, but due to the high demand for maintenance and painting of other aircraft, the process would take longer than expected.\n\n\n==== Problems and delays with Boeing 727 maintenance ====\nThe Boeing 727 reg. PR-IOC remained parked for around six months in one of the remote positions on the apron at Brasília International Airport, waiting for maintenance work to begin, which included complete disassembly, starting only in May 2022. The initial forecast was that the process would last around two months, but it constantly suffered from delays. \nIn February 2023, without having completed the maintenance work, the aircraft was removed from the hangar with parts removed, according to ASAS Linhas Aéreas, due to non-compliance with the contract by the company contracted for the maintenance service. Since June 2023, the aircraft has remained abandoned in Brasília, with parts removed and the engines covered with plastic; its future is completely uncertain, but according to experts, it is unlikely that, given such conditions, it will be able to fly again.\n\nTo further complicate the situation for ASAS Linhas Aéreas, its partner Americanas announced the discovery of accounting \"inconsistencies\" of 20 billion reais ($3.88 billion) on their balance sheet, creating an unprecedented crisis in the Brazilian retail sector. After the incident, the company CEO Sergio Rial resigned, with the company filing for bankruptcy on January 19, 2023. On January 25, 2023, Americanas declared bankruptcy in the United States, starting a recovery plan to renegotiate its debts with creditors and restructure its business model, which did not include maintaining the partnership with the airline.\n\n\n==== Change of plans ====\nOn January 5, 2024, after uncertainty about its future due to problems with the maintenance of its only plane and the bankruptcy of its main partner, ASAS Linhas Aéreas appears to have changed its plans and strategy to finally begin its operations. Through the Brazilian Aeronautical Registration (RAB) system, the airline reserved the PS-WIN registration for a Boeing 737-300SF (MSN 27713). In addition to the aforementioned Boeing 737 Classic, the airline also has PS-OMS registration reservation, initial of its founder's name, Orlando Menezes Silva, for another Boeing 727-200F, serial number 22462.\n\n\n== Destinations ==\nAs of April 2024, while awaiting receipt of a new aircraft to complete the process of obtaining its air operator certificate, ASAS Linhas Aéreas plans to fly to the following destinations:\n\n\n== Fleet ==\nASAS Linhas Aéreas fleet consists of the following aircraft (as of April 2024):\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of airlines of Brazil\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "William of Auvergne (French: Guillaume d'Auvergne) was a French nobleman and clergyman who was elected prince-bishop of Liège during a disputed election in 1281 but was forced to renounce the office the following year.\nA member of the House of Auvergne, William was a younger son of Count William X of Auvergne (r. 1229–1247). His brothers were Count Robert V of Auvergne and Archbishop Guy of Vienne.\nWilliam became a canon of Saint Lambert's Cathedral in Liège in 1262. He also held a canonry at Lyon and the provostry of Saint-Donatien in Bruges. From 1264 until 1282 he was the archdeacon of Famenne. According to the Chronique liégeoise de 1402, the canons initially elected the provost of Saint Lambert's, Bouchard d'Avesnes, to succeed the murdered bishop John of Enghien in 1281, but some were soon persuaded by Guy, Count of Flanders, to oppose Bouchard. The chronicle of Jean de Hocsem records that William was also elected. Count Guy then arranged for his son, John of Flanders, to become bishop. This was confirmed by Pope Martin IV, who issued a bull on 9 June 1282 stating that both rival candidates had renounced their rights. While Bouchard replaced John as bishop of Metz, William seems to have gone uncompensated.\nMargaret Alison Stones floats William as a possible candidate for the patron who commissioned the illuminated manuscript of the Chroniques de la Bible (now in The Hague, Royal Library of the Netherlands, 131 A 3).\nWilliam probably died in 1285.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==",

One major exception is for coins that depict a head of state, usually a monarch, which may change when the head of state changes.  New coins for these reasons were introduced in Monaco in 2006, Belgium and the Netherlands in 2014, Spain in 2015, and Vatican City in 2005, 2006, and 2013.  The 2006 Vatican City coins featured the symbols of the interregnum period, known as sede vacante, leading to a regulation banning nationals sides representing a vacancy or provisional occupant in regular coinage.In some cases, national sides were changed to conform to new regulations.  Changes in Belgium in 2008 and Spain in 2010, were in response to a new regulation that national elements could not appear in the ring of twelve stars on the outside of the design.  A 2007 change in Finland was in response to the requirement for the country's name or abbreviation to appear on the coin.\nAs the earliest Euro coins were issued in 2002, some countries became eligible to change their designs in 2017.  San Marino was the first to do so, in 2017.  France revised the design of their €1 and €2 coins in 2022, and the 10c, 20c, and 50c coins in 2024.  Belgium had violated this rule by using a new portrait of King Albert II as part of their 2008 design change, and was forced to revert to the original portrait the following year.  A 2017 change was also made in the Vatican City coin, changing from a bust to a monogram.\n\n\n== List ==\n\n\n== References ==",

She has ten siblings, four of whom played basketball professionally: Melvin, Ryan, Kenny and Deon. In the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd and the resulting protests, Ejim and her Gonzaga teammates participated in \"a pregame video that called for social and racial justice.\" Ejim was also one of several Gonzaga players to kneel during the national anthem, which garnered both praise and criticism from fans. \"The movement was always there,\" she said of the struggle for racial equality. “With George Floyd, it escalated more, but it's a thing that never really stopped.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGonzaga Bulldogs bio",

        "content": "Manchua was a type of sailing vessel used from the eastern coast of Africa to the Malabar Coast, the Indian Ocean, and the East Indies.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe manchua was a square-sailed, single-masted, oared vessel, used for cargo transport in the Indian Ocean. It was used both by locals as well as by Portuguese traders. Typically a Malabar vessel, the term was also used for similar large cargo boats of Chinese origin. Traveler Peter Mundy sketched a manchua in his journals and described them as \"small vessells of recreation, used by the Portugalls here, as allsoe att Goa, pretty handsome things resembling little Frigatts, Many curiously carved, guilded and painted, with little beake heads.\"\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nAlso spelled munchua, monchew, munchew, or manchooa, Manchua is called \"the Portuguese form\" in Hobson-Jobson, which claims that \"the original Malayālam word is manji, [manchi, Skt. maṇcha, 'a cot,' so called apparently from its raised platform for cargo].\" It may also have originated with \"native generic names for sea-going boats from Gujarat to Cochin,\" including \"the machhwu, a fishing and also cargo-boat\" and \"the mahungiri, a large machhwu used for a trading boat,\" according to Carnac Temple. He also notes that the Portuguese used manchua \"to represent the Cantonese term, man-shun, a sea-going trading vessel\" as well as for other simimar vessels from Macau.\n\n\n== History ==\nFirst described in 1512, manchuas (and similar vessels described by the same term) were commonly recorded in the region through the 18th century. Clement Downing noted that in the early 18th century, the \"town of Bombay was unwalled, and no Grabs or Frigates to protect any thing but the Fishery ; except a small Munchew, which had escaped when Angria took the Company’s Yacht.\" Carpenter Richard Lazenby was abducted by pirates Seagar, England, Taylor, and Levasseur in 1720 and recorded the capture of one of these vessels in his journals: \"They not liking to trust him being a stranger, resolved of seeking water at the Lacker Diva Islands, which they put for directly where they arrived in three days after. The same day of their arrival they took a small Monchew with the Governor of Carwar’s pass on board, who gave them an account that there was no anchor ground among the islands.\" The remains of two manchuas which sank during an attack on Mombasa in 1696-97 were tentatively identified by archaeological divers after a 2007 investigation.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "William Garside Phillips (b.  Hyde, 13 April 1849, d. Ansley, 1 January 1929) was a pioneer in mining education, the managing director of Ansley Hall Colliery and chair of the Atherstone Rural District Association from 1907 to 1929. He was called The Field Marshal of Warwickshire Coalfield.\n\n\n== Family and personal life ==\nWilliam Garside Phillips was born in Hyde, Manchester to John Phillips and Eliza Wilde, into “a nest of colliers”. He married Emma Phillips (1848–1921) in 1871. They had five children: Annie Mary Helps (1873–1951), Edith Tew (1878–1947), Gertrude Tremlett (1880–1960), Joseph Herbert Phillips (1882–1951) and Coningsby Wilde Phillips (1884–1964). The family moved to Warwickshire in 1879.\n\n\n=== Death ===\nPhillips died at Ansley Hall on New Year's Day 1929. At his funeral, a wagon carrying over 100 wreaths, “a great many of which were representative ones sent from big groups of people” followed the procession. In March 1931, the Phillips family made a donation to St Lawrence Church, Ansley, consisting of a new West Window, designed by Karl Parsons, an oak screen, choir stalls and electric lighting, all dedicated to Phillips’ memory. At the dedication service the Bishop of Coventry delivered the address.\n\n\n== Mining ==\nPhillips began working at Hyde and Haughton Collieries at the age of nine. At 17 he was made a manager and at a “comparative young age” he earned the Mine Manager's certificate. His studies involved walking eight miles to Queen's College, Manchester and back, for evening classes, following a 13-hour shift in the mine.\nIn December 1879 he moved to Warwickshire to become managing director of Ansley Hall Coal and Iron Company's colliery. At that point the colliery was “in a more or less critical condition” and Phillips “converted an unprofitable undertaking into one of the most up-to-date and successful pits in the country. He was the Warwickshire pioneer in substituting electric haulage underground for ponies 39 years ago.” He was described as the “Field-Marshal of the Warwickshire coalfield”.\n\n\n== Mining roles ==\nWarwickshire Coalfield Wage Board, chair\nWarwickshire Coal Owners’ Association, chair\nWarwickshire School of Mining, founder\nChesterfield and Midland Institute of Mining Engineers, president\nWarwickshire Mining Students’ Association, president\nMining Association of Great Britain, Warwickshire representative\n\n\n== Community ==\nPhillips was the leader of the Nuneaton division of the Conservative and Unionist Party  but declined an invitation to contest Nuneaton's parliamentary seat. In 1904 he donated land for Ansley's village school, which was established in 1906. In 1906 he became Justice of the peace for Warwickshire, taking his seat on the Atherstone bench. Other roles included:\n\nNuneaton Conservative Party, chair\nAnsley Parish Council, chair\nAtherstone Board of Guardians, chair\nBoard of guardians Vaccination Committee, chair\nAtherstone Rural District Council, chair (1907–1929) \nNuneaton Gas Company, vice-chair\nAnsley and District Agricultural and Horticultural Society, founder and president (1900–1929) \nNuneaton Town Cricket Club, president\nCharity of St John Twycross and John Perkins, trustee\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Secret or Underground Ukrainian University (Ukrainian: Таємний український університет, romanized: Taiemnyi ukrainskyi universytet), formally known as the Ukrainian University of Lviv (Ukrainian: Львівський український університет, romanized: Lvivskyi ukrainskyi universytet), was an underground Ukrainian university which existed in the city of Lwów in the Second Polish Republic (now Lviv, Ukraine) between 1921 and 1925.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Secret Ukrainian University was founded in July 1921 on a joint initiative of the Shevchenko Scientific Society, the Petro Mohyla Scientific Lecture Society, and the Stauropegion Institute. The basis of the university's organisation was the Ukrainian People's University, which had been disestablished in 1919 or 1920.\nThe university was established during a time of degrading of Ukrainians' rights within the Second Polish Republic. Polish authorities had removed all Ukrainian teachers and chairs from the University of Lviv and excluded higher education to citizens of Poland or the Allies in 1919, additionally banning Ukrainian-language courses the next year. The latter measure prompted a group of Ukrainian intellectuals in Lviv (then Lwów) to begin teaching clandestine courses in the humanities, law, and medicine. These courses later formed the basis of the Secret Ukrainian University. The first rector of the university was writer Vasyl Shchurat.\nThe Secret Ukrainian University was a non-profit, funded by donations from supporters. It received support from the Shevchenko Society, the Lviv chapter of Prosvita, the Lwów Ecclesiastical Museum, St. George's Cathedral, and Ridna Shkola, as well as members of the Ukrainian diaspora. By the end of 1921, there were 1,260 students studying in 54 different departments. This increased to 1,600 students across 65 students the next year.\nContrary to its name, the Secret Ukrainian University operated openly and in defiance of Polish authorities. After Shchurat's 1921 arrest, he was replaced by Marian Panchyshyn, who was later replaced by Yevhen Davydiak. The vast majority of Ukrainian intellectuals active in Lviv at the time supported the university, as part of the Ukrainian community's boycott of Polish educational institutions. The Polish government responded to the university's growth by launching a wide-reaching crackdown, prompting the university staff to issue a request to the League of Nations for protection.\nThe university began negotiations with Polish authorities for a resolution to the conflict in 1924. The university was represented by Kyrylo Studynsky and Roman Smal-Stocki, while the Polish government was represented by Stanisław Grabski, Stanisław Łoś, and Tadeusz Waryński. Ultimately, the proposals to reestablish Ukrainian-language education in Poland were rejected, owing to the Polish government's desire to strengthen the Polish character of Lviv, and the Secret Ukrainian University was forced to close at the end of 1925. Much of its activities were dispersed among other Ukrainian organisations, including Lviv Polytechnic.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The IBEW Building is a union hall in St. Louis, Missouri, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 1 continues to occupy the purpose-built building.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1891, Henry Miller founded a national organization for electricians at a convention held in his house in St. Louis with the local union being the first to join.  The Local 1 members continued to meet in rented facilities until 1928 when they purchased a former church in the Forest Park Southeast neighborhood. As the union grew and the membership increasingly drove cars in the 1950s, that space no longer met their needs for lack of parking.In 1959, the organization hired the Bank Building and Equipment Corporation to build a new union hall, just as the firm was expanding to serve clients outside of banking. Perry Langston served as the architect of record but worked under the supervision of Wenceslao Sarmiento. The building was completed in 1960 and remodeled in the 1980s.In recent years, Local 1 continues to grow and is one of the largest unions in the St. Louis area. In addition to membership meetings, the union uses the hall for events and fundraisers.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nLangston designed the two-story building in a mid-century modern International Style of architecture. The post-war materials used in construction include concrete, vinyl laminated concrete, steel, plate glass, and aluminum. The building is in The Hill neighborhood and the property is itself on a hillside. The front first floor is accessed from the street while the large parking lot provides direct access to the back second floor.The front of the building is dominated by seven blue painted beams that create exaggerated vertical fins that continue past the parapet to rise above the roofline. This creates six bays and allows the curtain wall to visibly hang from the structure. Only the first floor has windows, but the rest of the face is covered in white concave panels. The building now has multicolor lights that change the color of the building at night to celebrate holidays or support causes.The shorter back of the building mirrors the front with white panels in six bays, each with a double door to allow quick access to the parking lot. In contrast, the  side elevations along the hill are clad in Roman brick. One side has an original sign reading “Electrical Workers\" in a chrome finish.For the interior, the lower main entrance contains imitation marble walls and a terrazzo floor featuring the logo of the union. Beyond that, the first floor has separate rooms including the reception area, hiring hall, leadership offices, and board room. In contrast, the upper floor consists of a single-span meeting hall that can accommodate 900 people with a stage and concession stand on the periphery.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHenry Miller Museum\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in St. Louis south and west of downtown\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Velká Javořina (Slovak: Veľká Javorina) is a mountain massif on the border of the Czech Republic and Slovakia. At 970 metres (3,180 ft) above sea level, it is the highest peak of the White Carpathians mountain range.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe name Javořina/Javorina is derived from the Slavic word javor ('maple'). In Slovakia, there is another peak with the name Veľká Javorina, located in the Čergov mountains in eastern Slovakia, hence sometimes the distinguishing name Veľká Javorina Bielokarpatská is used.\n\n\n== Geological structure and soils ==\nThe massif of Velká Javořina is located in the southwest part of the White Carpathians and is built of flysch rocks with significant thickness, in which layers of sandstone (dating from the Upper Cretaceous to the Lower Paleocene) and fine-grained marine sediments (shales and marls) rhythmically repeat. The massif has the character of a mountainous erosional-denudational landscape. Its main feature is a significant surface area with large differences in elevation and steep terrain slopes. Convex landforms dominate over concave ones. The highest parts of the mountain are characterized by steep slopes facing north and northeast, descending to the Strání Valley with an average elevation of 479 meters above sea level. The summit itself has the shape of a broad, flat ridge covered with meadows, and the peak is located on the Slovak side.\nA characteristic and very common phenomenon in areas with softer (clay) ground is landslides, causing significant damage to the forest stand. On stony-clay slopes with alluvial deposits, medium-heavy cambisols have developed (a type of rendzina).\n\n\n== Hydrology ==\nA characteristic feature of the massif is the rapid, stream-like flow of watercourses, which is typical of areas with significant elevation differences. The predominance of water erosion processes on the slopes over aggradation is significant.\nAbundant mineral springs are found here, whose therapeutic properties are utilized in the Luhačovice spa town. On the northwest slope, at an altitude of 856 meters above sea level, the Velička stream emerges from a spring, which is a left tributary of the Morava river. The drainage divide between Velička and Sviniarský potok (a tributary of the Váh river) runs across the mountain.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nThe massif lies in the zone of temperate climates. The climate of the central and northeastern parts of the White Carpathians is quite warm, cooler at higher altitudes, but much warmer than at comparable heights in northern and western Moravia. Although dry southeast winds prevail in the White Carpathians, especially in summer, on the highest peaks such as Velká Javořina, northeast winds prevail, more frequent also in the summer. Winds are the cause of strong wind erosion. Precipitation is usually more abundant than in southern Moravia.\nThe summit areas of the White Carpathians around Velká Javořina have characteristics of a alpine climate. The average temperature in July there is from 15 to 16 °C, in January from -3 to -4 °C, the number of summer days ranges from 10 to 30, the number of frost days from 140 to 160, and the average annual precipitation totals 850–1000 mm. The average annual atmospheric temperature is below 6 °C.\n\n\n== Nature and its preservation ==\nThis area is one of the oldest protected areas in the Czech Republic; as early as 1909 its owners, the Liechtensteins, declared a protection regime similar to today's. The massif of Velká Javořina is located within the protected landscape areas of Bílé Karpaty on the Czech side and Biele Karpaty on the Slovak side. Additionally, both on the Czech and Slovak sides, small-scale protected areas have been designated (national nature reserve in the Czech Republic and nature reserve in Slovakia). In the Czech Republic the Javořina National Nature Reserve was established in 1951, with the highest category of protection, covering a preserved ecosystem of old-growth forest and mountain meadow, totaling 165.87 hectares since 2007, and in Slovakia, the Veľká Javorina Nature Reserve was established in 1988, covering 82.98 hectares. Both reserves are under strict protection, without interference in natural processes; the forest undergoes only natural renaturalisation.\n\n\n=== Vegetation ===\nThe summit is covered with the only Nardetalia in the White Carpathians, dominated by Nardus stricta. Before the use of mineral fertilizers in the early 1990s, the elder-flowered orchid and Gentianella lutescens were abundant there. Currently, the meadow is returning to its natural state, as evidenced by findings of round headed orchid and willowherbs. At the edge of the reserve grows the giant bellflower, which has the only known occurrence in the White Carpathians.\nThe forests of the massif mainly consist of native species: sycamore maple (from which the mountain takes its name), common beech, and ash. The trees are of similar age. Due to the harsh microclimate of the mountain's summit, there are trees with original, twisted crown shapes in the highest parts. Among the rare plants found here are the alpine sow-thistle (Cicerbita alpina, the only occurrence in the White Carpathians). Also growing there are snowdrops, perennial honesty, and Corydalis.\n\n\n=== Fauna ===\nIn the forests of Velká Javořina, one can find red deers, roe deers, and wild boars. Sometimes brown bears also wander there. Among the rarer species that inhabit this area are beetles such as the alpine longhorn beetle and Cerambyx scopolii, which feed on dead parts of trees. Rare spiders include tangle-web spiders, Tenuiphantes zimmermanni, Saloca kulczynskii from the sheet weaver family, as well as the fly Phaonia czernyi.\nAmong the birds reported are the white-backed woodpecker and the collared flycatcher. Around the springs and forest streams, one can find the fire salamander and the yellow-bellied toad.\n\n\n== Limestone mining ==\nSince the 18th century, limestone has been mined at the northwest foot of Velká Javořina. After grinding, it was supplied to the glassworks owned by the Liechtenstein family in the nearby village of Květné, which has been in operation since 1797. A mining settlement called Vápenky (now part of the municipality of Nová Lhota) was established at this location. Today, the former miners' cottages, built in a folk style, have been protected by the creation of a village monument zone.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nSeveral hiking trails lead to the summit, including periodically running along the same route the E8 European long distance path and Slovakian trails: the red trail (0701h) and the Cesta hrdinov SNP, as well as a yellow cycling route from Lubina (9 km long, with an elevation gain of 600 m). There are also Czech trails. During Austria-Hungary, the ridge served as the border between the Austrian part of the monarchy (including the Kingdom of Bohemia) and the Hungarian part (including Slovakia). A remnant of those times is one of the trails under Velká Javořina, called Maďarská cesta (Hungarian path). Using mountain trails, during World War II, about 2,500 people fleeing from the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, occupied by Nazi Germany, were smuggled through the massif.\nPopular ski resorts are located on the slopes, especially on the Slovak side, with the longest ski lift measuring 730 m. The mountain hut Holubyho chata, located at an altitude of 920 m above sea level, serves as a summer and winter accommodation base and a starting point for hikes. It is named after Jozef Ľudovít Holuby.\n\n\n== Summit development ==\n\nAt the summit, there is a tower with a height of 134.5 m serving as a radio mast, television tower, and base transceiver station for cellular network.\nIn an adit near the summit, a seismic station was established in 1995 by scientists from the Department of Earth Physics at Masaryk University in Brno in cooperation with the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics in Vienna.\n\n\n== Historical events ==\nIn July 1847, a group of Slovak students gathered on Velká Javořina to celebrate the publication of the first issue (3rd year) of the magazine Orol tatránski (Tatra Eagle), a literary supplement (biweekly) to the first Slovak-language periodical, Slovenskje národňje novini, edited by Ľudovít Štúr. The following year, another Slovak national leader, Jozef Miloslav Hurban, administered the oath to volunteers fighting during the Slovak Uprising against the Hungarians, who refused to recognize Slovak aspirations during the Spring of Nations.\n\n\n=== Fraternity of Czechs and Slovaks ===\nPatriotic meetings of Czechs, Slovaks, and Moravians also took place there, which is why Velká Javořina is considered one of the symbols of good relations between these nations. Evidence of this is a stone at the summit with a quote from J.M. Hurban: Tu bratia vždy sa stretať budú (Slovak) (English: Here brothers will always meet). On 1 September 1945, 25,000 Czechs and Slovaks gathered at the summit.\nEvery year in July, joint events are organized (Slovak: Slávnosti bratstva Čechov a Slovákov, Czech: Slavnosti bratrství Čechů a Slováků) with a rich program (including performances by folk groups from both countries, majorettes, meetings of mountain bikers). In addition, it has become a tradition to hike along the green trail from Květné to the \"Vavrouška's Tomb\" (a stone dedicated to Josef Vavrouška) on every New Year's Eve, located on the opposite peak of Velká Javořina. The first meeting took place on New Year's Eve 1992 and was a spontaneous, social protest against the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, which took place the next day – 1 January 1993, against the significant part of public opinion.\n\n\n=== Chapel project ===\nThe idea of ​​supporting the brotherhood of these nations was to be dedicated to the chapel of Our Lady, Mother of Unity, which the Servant of God, Father Antonín Šuránek, wanted to build on the summit directly after World War II. For this idea, he obtained the support of Archbishop Leopold Prečan of Olomouc. During the period of seeking approval and support from the Ministry of Agriculture and local government offices, the first ecumenical service for Slovaks, Czechs, and Moravians was held on the summit on 27 July 1947. During the descent from it, Marie Málková from Nivnice was killed by a tree falling during a storm. At the urging of Father Šuránek, a wayside cross was erected at the accident site, and then in 1971, a stone chapel with a bronze relief was built.\nHowever, the implementation of the chapel project on the summit became impossible after the full takeover of power by the communists in the 1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état and the resignation of President Edvard Beneš due to the resistance of the totalitarian regime.\n\n\n=== Tales and legends ===\nMountains often have their own folk legends. One tells of a dead rooster that came back to life and crowed to drive the Turks out of the country. Another story is about the bandit Jano Žuchli, who abducted the beautiful Anička from the Čachtice Castle (known for the infamous Elizabeth Báthory) and made her the queen of the mountains on Velká Javořina, endowing her with his wealth.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVelká Javořina on Bílé Karpaty Protected Landscape Area website\nVelká Javořina on Biele Karpaty Protected Landscape Area website\nVelká Javořina – heywhatsthat.com\nMassif of Velká Javořina on mapy.cz",

        "content": "Anne Abel Smith (born 28 July 1932), formerly known as Anne Liddell-Grainger, is a British aristocrat and Christian charity worker. A great-great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria and a cousin of Queen Elizabeth II, she was married for 25 years to Scottish politician David Liddell-Grainger and is the mother of Conservative MP Ian Liddell-Grainger. In her sixties, she attended gospel meetings in Kennington, did missionary work in Africa, and was often invited to Royal Ascot and other functions by the queen.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nAnne was born Lady Anne Mary Sibylla Abel Smith to Lady May Abel Smith and Sir Henry Abel Smith in 1932. She was the eldest of their three children and older sister to Richard Abel Smith and Elizabeth. She is a direct descendant of Queen Victoria; her mother was the eldest daughter of the Princess Alice of Albany, who was the eldest daughter of Victoria's youngest son, Prince Leopold. Her grandparents were Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone and Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone. \nShe attended King's Hall Compton in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada, when she was twelve.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nAnne married David Liddell-Grainger, a Scottish politician, on 14 December 1957. Their wedding ceremony was held in St. George's Chapel in Windsor Castle. Anne was attended by eight bridesmaids, among them Beatrix and Irene of the Netherlands, and Christina of Sweden, and wore a veil made for Queen Mary's wedding and a diamond tiara which was loaned to her by a cousin.\nThe couple had five children, including Ian Liddell-Grainger, who became the first direct descendant of Queen Victoria to be elected to the House of Commons in 2001.\nIn 1963, Anne and her husband took ownership of two Pharaoh hounds while vacationing in Malta. In the following years, they made an effort to try to introduce the breed to the United Kingdom; in 1966, only ten Pharaoh hounds were recorded in the United Kingdom, with the couple owning five at Ayton Castle in Scotland.\nShe divorced David after 25 years of marriage.\n\n\n== Charity work ==\nIn a rare interview in 1998, Abel Smith told The Mirror that she was a frequent passenger on board the hospital ship MV Anastasis, paying her own way to join Christian missions to Third World countries as a volunteer.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Batman: Resurrection by John Jackson Miller is an upcoming novel set in the Tim Burton Batman universe with Michael Keaton's Bruce Wayne / Batman as its protagonist. It is set to be released on October 15, 2024, by Penguin Random House. The novel serves as a direct sequel to the movie Batman (1989) and is set between the aforementioned film and its sequel, Batman Returns (1992).\n\n\n== Premise ==\nAfter the events of Batman, Gotham City is still in the clutches of the Joker, even after his death. What's left of The Joker's gang continues to terrorize the city, and opportunists such as greedy millionaire Max Shreck come out of the woodwork. Victims of The Joker's toxic chemical Smylex crowd the city's main hospital. Bruce Wayne's obsessive need to protect Gotham City drives a wedge between him and his newspaper journalist girlfriend Vicki Vale. Batman discovers an ever-growing evil being organized and orchestrated behind the scenes. This also leads him to investigate the biggest mystery of all – could The Joker have somehow survived. \n\n\n== Background ==\nOn April 11, 2024, it was announced exclusively by the web site io9 that a new book based the 1989 film Batman would be written by author John Jackson Miller. Miller was quoted saying, \"There are dream projects, and then there are projects you never dreamt were possible [...] People always ask what world I wanted to get the chance to write in; I never named Burton's take on Batman because I never imagined it could happen. But [PRH] editor Tom Hoeler found a way.\" Miller further revealed that the 1989 film shaped the writer he had become, mentioning that he saw the film in the theater twelve times and wrote college papers and comics magazine articles about it.\nUnlike the ongoing Batman '89 DC Comics comic book series, which serves as an alternative continuation of Batman (1989) and Batman Returns (1992), Batman: Resurrection explores the events following the 1989 film and before the events of 1992's Batman Returns. Miller revealed that the book's timeline enables characters such as Vicki Vale, Alexander Knox, Selina Kyle, and Max Shreck to appear.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website  at Penguin Random House website\nJohn Jackson Miller official website announcement",

        "content": "Mie lethek  (lit. 'Ugly noodles') is a noodle dish originating from Srandakan, Bantul Regency, Special Region of Yogyakarta. This dish primarily consists of grated cassava and grated coconut, typically using a bull to process the noodles. The word \"lethek\" is derived from its brownish color, resembling the bark of a tree.  Mie lethek is less popular in the Yogyakarta region due to competition from other dishes like petis, kuning, and instant noodles. However, in Bantul, mie lethek is well-known and enjoyed by the local community.\n\n\n== History ==\nDuring the 1920s, Umar Yassir from Yemen came to Yogyakarta for missionary work and to spread Islam. In Yogyakarta, his preaching couldn't reach many people because he used the Jawi script. Eventually, residents directed him to Kyai Bakir, who spoke Arabic to better convey his message. Later, Kyai Bakir sent him to Srandakan, Bantul. There, Umar spread his teachings and also engaged in economic activities in Srandakan. He believed that economic activities not only sustained life but also improved it. Consequently, in 1940, he established a noodle factory in Srandakan.Umar's factory was named Garuda Noodle Factory and operated until 1983 before closing in 2003 due to employees leaving for stone carving work in Lèpèn Praga. However, when stone carving work became scarce, the locals requested Umar's family to reopen the factory. The Garuda Noodle Factory continues to operate.\n\n\n== Noodle Processing ==\nThe main ingredients of mie lethek are grated cassava and tapioca. The cassava is soaked in water for several days. Each day, the water must be changed. After soaking, the cassava is ground using a large grinder and then mixed with tapioca. This mixture is kneaded using a bull for about two hours until thoroughly mixed. Once mixed, the dough is shaped into long rectangular blocks measuring 20 cm x 30 cm x 20 cm. These blocks are then steamed for 90 minutes and allowed to cool overnight. The cooled blocks are then grated, mixed with tapioca flour again, shaped into noodles, and dried.\n\n\n== Modern and Traditional Tools ==\nThe noodles are cut using both modern and traditional tools. Traditional tools include a large circular cutter with eight blades, which are operated by several people. The cutter is placed over a mortar or basin with a sieve to catch the cut noodles. Once cut, the noodles are spread out and dried.\nThe mie lethek factory in Bendho Village, Trimurti Subdistrict, Srandakan, sells its products in markets such as Bantul Market, Beringharjo Market, and even as far as Jawi Kilèn. However, the noodles are not sold in Jawi Wétan due to competition from other producers.\n\n\n== Preparation ==\nMie lethek can be prepared by frying or boiling the noodles. They are typically seasoned with a mixture of spices such as garlic, shallots, chili, candlenuts, turmeric, and galangal, along with chicken meat and various vegetables.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Pieve di San Verano is a Roman Catholic, Romanesque-style, formerly-rural parish church now located in on Piazza Popolo #1 in the historic center of Peccioli, province of Pisa, region of Tuscany, Italy. The church is dedicated to Veranus of Cavaillon.\n\n\n== Description ==\nA church at this site is first reliably documented by 1171 in a papal bull by Alexander III. The church layout seen today dates to the 12th-13th centuries. Originally it was located outside of the castle walls, but later as the medieval town grew, so did walls around this area.\nIn 1580, two chapels were added to the church, that of the Holy Sacrament and that of the Virgin of the Assumption. In 1688, after a procession, a fire destroyed the altar, nave roof, and organ. Reconstruction led to  a reconsecration in 1692. Further refurbishments took place over the following centuries. In 1811, a portico that had been added to the facade was razed. Between 1831 and 1834, the mullioned windows were sealed. The interior received plaster covering. A restoration in 1930 attempted to restore the look to a more Romanesque state.\nIn 2009, the Chapel of the Compagnia dell'Assunta (Fraternity of the Virgin of the Assumption) was converted into the Museo d’Arte Sacra of Peccioli.\nThe main facade has sealed arches. The Romanesque bell-tower was rebuilt in 1885 by the architect Luigi Bellincioni. The interior is divided into three naves by 8 brick columns with Romanesque capitals and bases. The ceiling of the nave and of the apse are frescoed. On the left wall is a depiction of St Verano of Cavillon (1854) by Andrea Sorbi.\n\n\n== Museo di Arte Sacra ==\nAmong the works housed in this museum are:\nMadonna and child with two angels attributed to 13th-century painter Enrico di Tedice\nLife of St Nicola attributed to 13th-century Michele di Baldovino\nWooden Crucifix (14th-century) by Sienese sculptor\nMadonna and Child with Saints Verano, James the Major, Monica, and Catherine (1463) by  Neri di Bicci\nVirgin in Glory with angels and Saints Roch, Verano, Francis, and Charles Borromeo attributed to a Tuscan painter\nCrucifixion with Virgin and Saints Anthony Abbott, Francis, Mary Magdalen, John the Evangelist, and Sebastian (17th-century) attributed to a Tuscan painter\nAssumption of the Virgin with Saints Bartholemew, Verano, John the Evangelist, Thomas, and Catherine of Alexandria (1628) by Giovanni Bilivert\nPresentation al Temple, Assumption of the Virgin, Flight to Egypt (second half of 17th-century) attributed to a Tuscan painter\nSt Nicola of Tolentino (17th-century) attributed to Tuscan painter\nSt Agatha (17th-century) attributed to a Tuscan painter\nSaint Apollonia, 17th-century by a Tuscan painter\nSaints John the Baptist, Augustine, Andrew, and Moses (1673) by Simone Pignoni, removed from local former church of the Madonna del Carmine\nSt Peter (18th-century) attributed to Giovanni Battista Piazzetta\n\n\n== References ==\nLuca Sacchini, Thesis, a.a. 2012–13, Il complesso di San Verano a Peccioli: dall’analisi delle vicende storiche al progetto di restauro.\nArianna Merlini, “Tra chiassi, vicoli e strade attorno alla Castellaccia.

It was initially a men's monastery, and it received support from several political figures in the Zaporozhian Sich such as Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny, Pavlo Teteria, Petro Doroshenko, and Ivan Skoropadsky. During the Ruin, the monastery was destroyed by the Ottoman Empire, Crimean Khanate, and Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.\nThe monastery played an important part in the religious life of southern Kyiv region during its early existence, and it was an organisational centre during the Koliivshchyna uprising. Taras Shevchenko depicted the monastery in his 1845 watercolour work Motryn Monastery.\nIn 1911, Motronynskyi Monastery's status changed from a male monastery to a nunnery. Following the Russian Revolution and the Ukrainian–Soviet War, the monastery was initially allowed to continue operating, but with 250 dessiatinas (273.13 hectares) confiscated by the Soviet government. On 21 November 1929 the monastery was fully abolished, with a commune being established in its place. The monastery was reestablished under the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) in 1991.\nIn addition to the monastery itself, the monastery's territory contains a spring and a pond.\n\n\n== References ==",

It was founded in 1991 and is headquartered in Vienna. It is a founding member of European Leagues.It has 27 member clubs and organizes the two professional championships of Bundesliga and 2nd Liga, where reserve teams are welcome.\n\n\n== History ==\nProfessionalism in football arrived in Austria with the Wiener Fußball-Verband, in 1924. But it was only after the Second World War, in 1949, that an organization bringing together the country's professional clubs was born: it was the Österreichische Fußball-Staatsliga, which governed the first (Staatsliga A) and second (Staatsliga B) division championships. In 1974, however, the Austrian Football Federation officially dissolved the league and took over the organization of the championships. Only in 1991 did the clubs form an autonomous association again, the Österreichische Fußball-Bundesliga, operational from 1 December of that year. Formally it is a non-profit association.It is constituted in the form of eingetragener Verein and is one of the 10 members of the association, together with the 9 football associations of land.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "The Sudamérica XV (sometimes nicknamed the Jaguars) is a rugby union team made up from the national rugby sides in the Sudamérica Rugby (formerly CONSUR) rugby federation. \nThe squad was first formed in 1980 to compete against South African teams, despite the ban imposed on that country in repudiation of apartheid. Over the eight test matches played, seven of them were won by the Springboks and only one was won by the Jaguars. This single victory came at Bloemfontein in 1982.\nIn 2011, a new Sudamérica XV was formed to face the Argentine side before they trip to New Zealand to play the 2011 Rugby World Cup.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== First team: the 1980s ===\n\nThe side was formed in 1980 after an invitation from the SARU to the Argentine Rugby Union (UAR) to play a series of games there as a way of counteracting its sporting isolation which was due to the country's apartheid policies.\nThe team that toured was mainly made up of Argentina players and included a few Uruguayan, Chilean, Paraguayan, Brazilian and even Spanish players. The team was named \"Sudamérica XV\", wearing a white jersey with blue, red and gold stripes. The badge included a puma, a condor, a lapwing and a jaguar, representing Argentina, Chile, Uruguay and Paraguay respectively. Rodolfo O'Reilly was appointed as coach.\n\nBoys from other countries knew that (South America XV) was a facade, and, although they played some matches in the tour, it were the Pumas who played the tests\nThe Jaguars was a 'shadow' Argentine national team, not officially recognised by the UAR as a stratagem to elude the prohibition of the Argentine government that since the early 1970s forbade any official relationship between any Argentine sport federation and South African and Rhodesian ones, due to the apartheid politics of those countries. This ostracism had started in 1971 when the Argentine government forbade the Pumas to play a match in Rhodesia during the tour in South Africa.\nIn March 1973, the Argentine government and the UAR had a great conflict: the government contested to UAR the permit given to San Isidro Club to visit South Africa, and forced the federal committee of UAR to resign. A new committee was elected on 24 April 1973. In November the government also forbade all visits to South Africa by any Argentine team and any visit of a South African team into Argentina. This ban remained until 1991.\nThe only victory of Sudamérica XV in a test match came in 1982, when they beat South Africa 21–12, with all points scored by captain Hugo Porta. It also became the first win of an Argentine side over South Africa so all the players on the field were from that country.\nIn 1984 the Argentine Government forced the UAR to forbid the use of any Argentine emblem by the players. As a result, the body decided not to send any representative to South Africa, declining the invitation. Nevertheless, the players accepted the invitation, being part of the South American Jaguars that toured that year. That tour was the last, with the Jaguars being dissolved.\n\n\n=== Rebirth ===\nIn 2011, the side played one match against Argentina, in San Juan as part of their 2011 Rugby World Cup warm-ups. Argentina won 78–15.\nThe team reassembled in 2013, and played England on 2 June 2013 at Estadio Charrúa in Montevideo as a warm-up match for the English before playing 2 tests against Argentina.\nThe team competed at the 2015 Urucup, with players from the Argentine Pladar Litoral plus three guests from Colombia, Paraguay and Venezuela.\nIn November 2018, Sudamérica XV toured Chile and Paraguay to play the respective national teams. In August 2019, the team played Uruguay, which beat them 24–20.\nAfter a long hiatus of over four years, Sudamérica XV was reassembled in 2023 to play vs Georgian professional team Black Lion, then Rugby Europe Super Cup champion, at Estadio Charrúa. Sudamérica XV defeated the Lions 28–24. The regional side was formed by players from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Uruguay.\n\n\n== Team image ==\n\n\n=== Badge ===\n\nThe team's badge includes four animal figures, each of them representing a symbol of their respective countries,  they are puma (Argentina), condor (Chile), tero (Uruguay), and yacare (Paraguay).\nThese animals have also been the symbols (and nicknames) of the four rugby national teams. In the case of Chile, the condor is also the national emblem of the country, appearing in the national coat of arms promulgated in 1832.\n\n\n=== Kit history ===\n\n\n== Test results ==\nSummarised list of matches played by the South American side (only considered \"tests\" are included):\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Chestnut Street Opera House, originally Fox's New American Theatre, was a theater in Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which operated from 1870 to 1939. At different times it presented legitimate theater, variety and film.\n\n\n== History ==\nRobert Fox opened Fox's New American Theatre as a variety house in 1870 on a site on Chestnut Street bought from the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. The theater burned down and was rebuilt in 1877. Fox had previously run his original Fox's American Theatre in Walnut Street from 1865 to 1870. That theater had also burned down and been rebuilt in 1867. The Philadelphia Times reported that all but one of the theaters connected to Fox had \"found their end amid charred timbers and smoking ruins\".\nIn 1880 Fox's theater was acquired by George K. Goodwin, the manager of the Walnut Street Theatre, and reopened as a legitimate theater, the Chestnut Street Opera House.: 18 : 157  Goodwin died in 1881 and in 1882 the theater magnates Samuel F. Nixon and J. Fred Zimmerman Sr. acquired the lease of the Chestnut Street Opera House from his widow.: 166 \nBetween 1915 and 1916 it was one of three model theaters for the Triangle Film Corporation, along with the Knickerbocker in New York and the Studebaker in Chicago . The aim had been to attract \"the very best people\" and charge $2 for a ticket, equivalent to $60 in 2023, but the theaters were unable to cover their costs. The theater was acquired by the Shubert Organisation theater chain in 1916. In the 1920s and 1930s it was one of the leading legitimate theaters in Philadelphia.: 18 \nThe theater closed in 1939 and was demolished in 1940.: 18 \n\n\n== Building ==\nThe site of the New American Theatre was 100 by 173 feet (30 by 53 m). The Chestnut Street frontage was occupied by an entrance hall behind an elaborate classical facade with corinthian columns and a central arch topped by a clock and a sculpture of an eagle. The auditorium had three levels of seating, accommodating 1,656 patrons.: 126–127 \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Udio is a generative artificial intelligence model that produces music based on prompts. Its free beta version was released publicly on April 10, 2024. Founded in December 2023 by a team of former researchers for Google DeepMind headed by Udio's CEO, David Ding, the program received financial backing from the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and musicians will.i.am and Common, among others. Critics praised its ability to create realistic-sounding vocals while others raised concerns over its training data likely consisting of copyrighted music.\n\n\n== History ==\nUdio was created in December 2023 by a team of four former researchers for Google DeepMind, including Udio's CEO David Ding, Conor Durkan, Charlie Nash, Yaroslav Ganin, as well as Andrew Sanchez. The venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz; the music distributor UnitedMasters; musicians will.i.am, Tay Keith, and Common; investor Kevin Wall; Instagram cofounder Mike Krieger; and DeepMind research Oriol Vinyals all provided financial backing for Udio, and it was valued at $10 million in seed funding. It spent several months in a closed beta phase before being publicly released in its beta phase on April 10, 2024 on the Udio website. As of April 2024, it allows users to generate 1,200 songs per month for free. Sanchez described it as \"enabl[ing musicians] to create great music and ... to make money off of that music in the future\". Udio's release followed the releases of other text-to-music generators such as Suno AI and Stability Audio.\n\n\n== Capabilities ==\nUdio bases the songs it creates on text prompts, which can include their genre (including barbershop quartet, country, classical, hip hop, German pop, and hard rock, among others), lyrics, story direction, and other artists to base their sound on. Its lyrics are created with a large language model (LLM), while the process used to generate the music itself, as of April 2024, has not been disclosed. The program generates two songs based on the prompts and users can \"remix\" their songs with further text prompts. Songs are first generated as 30 seconds long and can be extended to a maximum length of 90 seconds.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nMark Hachman, the senior editor of PC World, compared Udio to AI art generators and praised its ability to turn \"a few rather poor lyrics\" into a \"rather catchy\" song, also calling the vocals it generated \"incredibly realistic and even emotional\". Sabrina Ortiz of ZDNET described the songs it generated as being \"impressive\" and sounding \"as though they were produced professionally\". She also called them \"fuller and richer\" than those of other text-to-music generators, which she said it had \"more personalization options\" than. Tom's Guide's Ryan Morrison wrote that Udio had \"an uncanny ability to capture emotion in synthetic vocals\" and was the only AI music generator \"to have captured the passion, pain and spirit of a vocal performance\". He added that the program was geared toward \"people with no or minimal musical ability\". Brian Hiatt of Rolling Stone wrote that Udio was \"more customizable but also perhaps less intuitive to use\" than Suno AI and added that \"some early users have suggested that on average, Udio's output may sound crisper than Suno's\".\nFor Ars Technica, Benj Edwards wrote that Udio's generation capability was imperfect and \"less impressive\" than Suno AI's, noting that its songs were substantially shorter than Suno AI's. He also called the songs it produced \"half-baked and almost nightmarish\". In response to the company's announcement of Udio's beta release on Twitter, Telefon Tel Aviv member Joshua Eustis tweeted that Udio was \"an app to replace musicians\" and called into question the data that it used. Udio has also been criticized online as \"soulless\" and for having the potential to create audio deepfakes. Lucas Ropek of Gizmodo stated that Udio was \"full of acoustical nonsense\" and that its songs were \"extraordinarily bad\".\n\n\n=== Copyright concerns ===\nCritics of Udio have questioned what data was used to train it and if that data consisted of copyrighted music. Rolling Stone wrote that there was \"substantial reason to believe\" that both Udio and Suno AI were trained with copyrighted music, while Benj Edwards of Ars Technica wrote that its training data was \"likely filled with copyrighted material\". Udio does not directly recreate copyrighted songs if prompted. Ding has stated that Udio has \"extensive automated copyright filters\" and that the company is \"continually refining [its] safeguards\".\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Goodenia brendannarum is a species of flowering plant in the family Goodeniaceae, and is endemic to a small area in the south-west of Western Australia. It is a perennial herb with woody stems, crowded, narrowly egg-shaped leaves with toothed edges, and erect flowering stems and orange-yellow and red flowers.\n\n\n== Description ==\nGoodenia brendannarum is a more or less glabrous, perennial herb with erect stems up to 30 cm (12 in) long. Its leaves are sessile and crowded, egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, 40–70 mm (1.6–2.8 in) long and 10–15 mm (0.39–0.59 in) wide with toothed edges. The flowers are borne on a flowering stem up to 200 mm (7.9 in) long with linear bracteoles up to 13 mm (0.51 in) long at the base. The lower sepal is about 5 mm (0.20 in) long, and the petals are orange-yellow and red, about 12 mm (0.47 in) long and hairy, with wings about 2 mm (0.079 in) wide almost to the base of the lower sepal. Flowering mainly occurs from October to December and the fruit contains up to 4 seeds about 2 mm (0.079 in) long.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThis species was first formally described in 1912 by George Bentham who gave it the name Velleia macrophylla var. foliosa in his Flora Australiensis from specimens collected by James Drummond from the summit of the Stirling Range. In 2020, Kelly Anne Shepherd and others transferred it to the genus Goodenia but the name G. foliosa was unavailable as it was preoccupied by a species described by Karel Domin. Shepherd named the new species G. brendannarum in honour of Brendan Lepschi and Anna Monro in recognition of their service to the botanical community.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nGoodenia brendannarum grows in rocky places in the Stirling Range in the south-west of Western Australia.\n\n\n== References ==",
