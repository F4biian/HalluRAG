At 4 February, The Palestinian Health Ministry reported that 92 people had been killed by Israeli attacks on Rafah. At least two girls were killed on an attack at a kindergarten. The intensifying Israeli attacks were reportedly centered in eastern Rafah.\nOn 7 February, Axios reported that Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant stated to the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken that Israel would soon begin expanded ground operations in Rafah. In Rafah, an Israeli airstrike bombed a civilian car next to an entertainment event for displaced children, reportedly killing at least one person. Eleven people were killed in overnight airstrikes. Six Palestinian policemen were reportedly killed while clearing the road for an aid truck.\nIn February 2024, multiple countries and organizations expressed concerns about the offensive.\nOn 8 February, The U.S. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby stated, \"Any major military operation in Rafah at this time... would be a disaster, and we would not support it\". The U.S. requested Israel to create a plan and prioritise the safety of civilians which had increased due to refugees from other areas of Gaza. U.S. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby stated that they have not observed signs of an imminent Israeli offensive into Gaza.\nNetanyahu ordered the IDF to prepare to invade Rafah. An intense bombing campaign in west Rafah was reported, reportedly indicating an expanding ground invasion. At least twelve people were killed in airstrikes in southern Rafah.\nOn 9 February, Netanyahu ordered the IDF to plan for the \"evacuation of the population\" from Rafah. Israeli Prime Minister's Office stated that elimination of Hamas remains impossible without the destruction of the four Hamas battalions in Rafah which is the last major population center in Gaza not occupied by the IDF. Doctors Without Borders issued a strong warning in response, stating, \"Israel's declared ground offensive on Rafah would be catastrophic and must not proceed. Today’s announcement marks a dramatic escalation in this ongoing massacre.\" Egypt sent 40 tanks to the Rafah border. Eight people were killed and at least eighteen wounded in Israeli strikes on residential buildings in Rafah.\nOn 10 February, Haaretz and Channel 12 stated Israel's plans for the Rafah invasion were not yet finalized. Two Palestinians were killed after an Israeli strike on a police car in Rafah. An unnamed Israeli official stated Palestinians in Rafah would be evacuated back northward. At least 28 people were killed in Rafah by overnight Israeli attacks.\nEgypt warned Israel that if it invaded Rafah, the Egypt–Israel peace treaty would be suspended. Egypt also stepped up security on its border with Israel and sent 40 tanks and armored personnel carriers to northeastern Sinai. Israel called up reservists for the operation. Israeli airstrikes in Rafah killed two Hamas policemen, three senior officers, and a senior commander in the Rafah district.\nOn 11 February, In a call with Benjamin Netanyahu, Biden stated Israel could invade Rafah with U.S. support when they had a \"credible and executable plan\" in place. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the World Health Organization, stated reports of Israel's impending invasion were \"extremely worrying\". Satellite imagery indicated Egypt had strengthened the border, including building earthen berms and security checkpoints. At least 40 people were reported killed in east Rafah. Al Jazeera journalist Hani Mahmoud described Israel's attacks on Rafah police as an intentional attempt to create civil disorder.\nIsrael conducted a nighttime raid on Rafah and rescued two hostages. To divert attention during the operation, bombing increased, killing more than 67 people according to the Gaza Health Ministry. One survivor of Israel's bombing stated, \"We heard the sound of explosions, like hell falling down on civilians\". The event coincided with Super Bowl LVIII, allegedly to distract Americans.\nIsraeli airstrikes hit the area around the Kuwait Hospital. During a press brief with U.S. president Joe Biden, King Abdullah II of Jordan stated the world \"cannot afford an Israeli attack on Rafah\". Stéphane Dujarric criticized Israel's stated plan to evacuate people northward, stating, \"You can't send people back to areas that are littered with unexploded ordnance, not to mention a lack of shelter\". ICC prosecutor Karim Khan stated he was \"deeply concerned\" by Israel's bombardment of Rafah.\nMore than 100 people were killed due to Israeli airstrikes targeting areas in Rafah and helicopters firing machine guns along the border areas. An Al Jazeera correspondent reporting on the ground stated, \"Warplanes that covered the sky, dropping barrages in a fiery belt that crushed the bodies of the displaced in their tents.\" Hamas condemned the action as a \"horrific massacre\" by Israel against civilians in Rafah.\nDisplaced people in Rafah began fleeing to other parts of the Gaza Strip, including Khan Younis and Maghazi. Two Al Jazeera journalists were wounded by an Israeli drone missile while documenting living conditions in Rafah, with one reporter losing a leg. Four people were killed by an Israeli bomb in Rafah's Brazil neighborhood.\nUNOCHA reported that displaced people were continuing to flee to Deir el-Balah, as well as to the Nuseirat refugee camp. Intensified Israeli strikes in eastern Rafah were reported, including in agricultural areas near the Egyptian border. Egypt continued on its construction of a concrete walled enclosure along its border with Gaza.\nThe Wall Street Journal and The New York Times reported that south of Rafah, Egypt was building a refugee camp surrounded by five-meter-high concrete walls for over 100,000 people.\nDuring a press conference, U.S. president Joe Biden stated, \"I anticipate, I’m hoping, that the Israelis will not make any massive land invasion [of Rafah] in the meantime. So, my expectation, that’s not gonna happen.\" Yoav Gallant stated the Israeli military was in the process of planning the Rafah offensive. When asked about Israel's plans for potential refugees fleeing Gaza during a military offensive, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz stated, \"We will coordinate with Egypt\". The Sinai Foundation for Human Rights stated that Egypt was building an enclosure with tents \"in the case of a mass exodus\", though North Sinai Governor Mohamed Shousha stated this was not true. Seven people were killed and more wounded in an Israeli bombing of the Nassr neighbourhood.\nAt least thirteen people were killed in two airstrikes on Rafah. A bombing from an Israeli fighter jet destroyed a residential building. Benjamin Netanyahu stated, \"Whoever is telling us not to operate in Rafah is telling us to lose an ear\". The U.S. began preparing to send Israel more weapons.\nThe North Sinai governor stated that Egyptian construction on the Rafah border was a \"designated spaces for [humanitarian aid] trucks, storage units, administrative offices and places for the drivers to stay overnight\". UN spokesman Stéphane Dujarric stated, \"In Rafah, humanitarian conditions have become increasingly severe with continued reports of people stopping aid trucks to take food\". David M. Satterfield stated that the Israeli killing of Rafah police for truck convoys had made the safe distribution of aid \"virtually impossible\". ActionAid warned that if Israel proceeded with an offensive on Rafah, \"Aid operations will grind to a complete halt, denying a lifeline to hundreds of thousands of people\".\nThe Egyptian Foreign Minister admitted Egypt was preparing safe areas for Gaza refugees while reiterating that displacement of Palestinians into Egypt was unacceptable: \"It is not our intention to provide any safe areas or facilities, but if this is necessary we will deal with the humanity that is necessary.\" Netanyahu stated Israeli ground soldiers would go into Rafah, stating, \"Whoever tells us not to operate in Rafah, is telling us to lose the war.\"\nIsraeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz warned that a ground offensive would be launched in Rafah on 10 March unless Hamas has freed all hostages by then. Gantz added Israel would act in \"a co-ordinated manner, facilitating the evacuation of civilians in dialogue with our American and Egyptian partners to minimise civilian casualties\". President of Egypt Abdel Fattah el-Sisi stated his \"categorical rejection of the displacement of Palestinians to Egypt in any shape or form\".\nOn 19 February, the US proposed an alternative draft resolution for the United Nations Security Council calling for a temporary ceasefire and opposing a major Israeli ground offensive in Rafah, Reuters reported. The text \"determines that under current circumstances a major ground offensive into Rafah would result in further harm to civilians and their further displacement including potentially into neighboring countries.\" The resolution says such a move \"would have serious implications for regional peace and security, and therefore underscores that such a major ground offensive should not proceed under current circumstances.\" Israel sets a deadline for the offensive, saying it will begin if the hostages aren't freed by Ramadan.\nOn 21 February, Israel bombed a residential building and wounded one person, leading journalist Tareq Abu Azzoum to state, \"Right now Rafah has been a centre for Israeli attacks\". An Israeli airstrike on the home of an attorney for the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights killed the woman, as well as seven family members, including her two-year-old child.",

While undergoing treatment, Travis suffered congestive heart failure and a stroke. The stroke affected the left side of Travis's brain, impacting movement on the right side of his body. Travis was placed on life support after the infection caused his lungs to collapse, and was declared to have a one percent chance of survival. The infection, subsequent stroke, and three separate bouts of pneumonia led to Travis undergoing three tracheostomies and two brain surgeries. Travis also suffered aphasia and lost the ability to speak and sing, while also suffering vision problems. These issues were mitigated through years of therapy with Davis, to whom he was engaged at the time. By November 2014, he was recovering, could walk short distances without assistance, and was re-learning to write and play guitar, according to Davis. While the stroke removed most of Travis's ability to sing, he has made sporadic onstage appearances to perform in limited capacity.\nIn 2023, the increased use of artificial intelligence spurred conversation about the need to protect artists' rights. However, Cris Lacy, Warner Music Nashville co-chair and co-president, believed that some positive influence could come from it in the way of \"giving Randy Travis his voice back\". \"Where That Came From\" is a ballad written by Scotty Emerick and John Scott Sherrill, and Travis' longtime producer Kyle Lehning developed the vocal track from an initial recording done by vocalist and frequent touring partner James Dupré, working for months on perfecting it from the AI model's base rendering.",

This makerspace played a pivotal role in the global response to COVID-19 by producing medical equipment for the hard-hit Navajo Nation. However, Grenzfurthner is deterred by the thought that the content might be too depressing, and he doubts his ability to sell it to Netflix. Uncle Sam (performed by Max Grodénchik) appears, demanding that Grenzfurthner create an 'invigorating tale' about the 'spirit of freedom, the endless beauty of the American Southwest, and a forceful statement against collapse.' He seeks a 'true American story.'\nReluctantly, Grenzfurthner agrees to make the documentary, albeit with the intention of educating the audience about the downsides of the \"American story\" and colonialism.",

In 2009, Steven K. Baum and Neal E. Rosenberg founded the Journal for the Study of Antisemitism as the first English-language academic journal solely devoted to the study of antisemitism. According to scholar Kenneth Marcus, antisemitism was not considered a particularly popular or politically correct area of academic focus, particularly on the political left, because so much of contemporary antisemitism arises from Arab and Muslim countries.\nThe first journal's issue was released in June 2009 with Professor Michael Berenbaum as founding editor.\nIn Europe, the number of research items dealing with antisemitism more than doubled between the 1990s and 2010s, with antisemitism taking up an increasingly large proportion of research holdings since 1990. The European Union Strategy on Combatting Antisemitism and Fostering Jewish Life, published on 5 October 2021, recommended the formation of a European research hub to coordinate academic research on antisemitism and Jewish life across Europe and foster and fund multidisciplinary research. A 2023 study by the European Commission noted that the core group of academic researchers of antisemitism numbered approximately 60; however, antisemitism was not the primary focus of study for the majority.\nIn 2009, Birkbeck, University of London and the Pears Foundation launched the Pears Institute for the Study of Antisemitism, the first academic institute in Britain solely studying antisemitism.\nIn the aftermath of the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel and subsequent rise in global antisemitism, several universities announced the formation of academic research institutes and programs specifically focusing on antisemitism, including the University of Michigan, New York University and the University of Toronto (UofT).",

Witnesses to the test, which was to determine the impact of high altitudes on parachute straps, reported seeing Major dogpaddling during his descent.\nThe rhesus macaque Albert I was launched in a V-2 Rocket on 18 June 1948. The respiratory apparatus and the parachute system both failed, and Albert likely died due to breathing problems but would have died on impact anyway since the capsule's parachute failed to open. Another rhesus macaque, Albert II became the first mammal in space on 14 June 1949, but plummeted to his death after a parachute failure.\nAt Edwards Air Force Base in 1962, bears were used for a series of escape capsule ejection tests of the Convair B-58 Hustler. The first supersonic ejection test occurred on 21 March 1962 at the speed of Mach 1.3 at 35,000 ft (11,000 m) and the bear survived the nearly eight-minute parachute descent. A bear was ejected again from a height of 45,000 ft (14,000 m) on 6 April.

An explosion at the mine in May 1901 saw the deaths of 81 men. An even greater explosion in the mine on 14 October 1913 became the greatest colliery disaster in British mining history, with the loss of 439 men and boys.

In 2022, he met Tan Zhu (born 1997 in Chongqing) through the mobile game Honor of Kings. Tan Zhu repeatedly requested money transfers from Fat Cat under various pretenses. Fat Cat's primary source of income was playing the game for others (\"game boosting\"). According to chat logs, Fat Cat and Tan Zhu had agreed to marry in May 2024. However, in April 2024, Tan Zhu broke up with Fat Cat, saying that he \"could not provide her with emotional value\". Determined to salvage the relationship, Fat Cat traveled from Hunan to Chongqing, but Tan Zhu refused his suggestion of cohabitation. Fat Cat then transferred his remaining RMB 66,000 (US$9,000 at the time) to Tan Zhu and jumped off the Shibanpo Yangtze River Bridge in Chongqing. According to Fat Cat's family, he had transferred a total of RMB 510,000 to Tan Zhu online over the course of two years.\n\nFat Cat's body was found 12 days later. Following the incident, Tan Zhu publicly apologized for her actions and expressed regret. She also denied the claim that Fat Cat had transferred RMB 510,000 to her. In the aftermath of the incident, Tan Zhu reached an agreement with Fat Cat's father to pay RMB 130,000 in compensation.",

His first, \"Push Ups\", was premiered by media personality DJ Akademiks after a low quality demo version that sampled \"Get Money\" by Junior M.A.F.I.A. was leaked. Throughout the song, Drake mocks Lamar's short stature and musical authenticity, all the while generating rumors of him being extorted by his former label, Top Dawg Entertainment.\nThe second response, \"Taylor Made Freestyle\", was released on Drake's social media accounts immediately after \"Push Ups\" was released to streaming platforms. The song used vocals generated from artificial intelligence of Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg, two of Lamar's musical idols, to entice him to release his own response.

Writing for musicOMH, Ross Horton scored this work a 5 out of 5, declaring it \"a fantastic album [which] may be the best of an already-excellent run of albums produced by... the greatest rock band in the world\". A profile of the band in NME by Oumar Selah stated that this release shows that the band \"remain musically inventive and passionate for change in their home nation and beyond\". That magazine also published a review by Max Pilley who scored it 4 out of 5 stars, stating that listeners to this \"wildly exciting\" music \"will not just hear the glorious music of the Tuareg people, but they will understand their struggles, too\". In The New York Times, Ben Sisario called this release \"a cri de coeur of screaming guitars and lyrics decrying the legacy of colonialism in Niger and throughout Africa\" that \"amps up the urgency\" of 2021's Afrique Victime. In The Observer, Phil Mongredien rated Funeral for Justice 5 out of 5 stars, stating that it \"doesn’t pull any punches, whether tackling the disastrous legacy of French colonialism... and the failures of African leaders to build up their countries..., or the way that Moctar’s native Tamasheq language is at risk of dying out as it loses out to French among younger people...\".\nEditors at Pitchfork Media scored this release 8.4 out of 10, declaring it among the Best New Music and critic Arielle Gordon praised the incendiary political lyrics: \"it’s impossible to miss—from the blood dripping off of the crows on its album cover to the screeching guitars that open its first song, it’s the proud sound of rebellion, transposed from Tamasheq into a language that refuses to be misinterpreted\". At PopMatters, Adriane Pontecorvo rated this album a 10 out of 10, writing that \"Even by Mdou Moctar’s high standards, Funeral for Justice is extraordinary. It is searing in music and lyrics, with messages that are essential in a world on fire and whose sounds can carry those messages far and wide.",
        "passage_text": "More than any previous Mdou Moctar album, it feels alive: Moctar and his whole band are in the room with their listeners, fanning the flames of righteous resolve and reminding us that if justice is dead, there’s no more fitting tribute to it than raising our voices on its behalf\".",

Following this, Gomber played the role of a call center accent trainer in Kunaal Roy Kapur's English language satirical mockumentary film The President Is Coming in 2009. This film delved into the behind-the-scenes chaos surrounding President Bush's visit to India, receiving acclaim from critics. During this period, he also contributed to Vinod Mitra's drama film Meridian Lines, although the film is yet to be released.\nHis breakthrough came in 2014 with his portrayal of a Gujarati defense lawyer in Chaitanya Tamhane multi-lingual legal drama film, Court, alongside Vira Sathidar and Geetanjali Kulkarni.  The film, which explores the intricacies of the Indian legal system through the trial of an aging protest singer accused of encouraging a manhole worker to commit suicide, earned him widespread recognition. Gomber also served as a producer for the film, a role offered to him by Tamhane.

        "context": "The term was not coined in New Zealand, however; earlier usage included that of British Prime Minister David Cameron to describe a potential coalition between Labour and the Scottish National Party (see Chaos with Ed Miliband), which became similarly infamous.\nUnder New Zealand's mixed-member proportional (MMP) voting system, legislative coalitions are almost always essential for forming governments. During the campaign, Luxon, a centre-right social conservative, claimed Hipkins would form a \"coalition of chaos\" with the Green Party and Te Pāti Māori, the two other left-wing parties in the House of Representatives, the latter of whom he described as \"separatist\" and \"radical\". Luxon became known for his usage of the term. At one point Luxon caused controversy after also claiming Labour would go into coalition with \"Te Pāti Māori... and the gangs\". With the exception of former Green Party co-leader James Shaw (who has since resigned), all the leaders of New Zealand's major third parties are Māori. This is relevant because the potential left-wing coalition was seen as one which would enhance indigenous rights (in eyes of the right, to the detriment of others), and the right-wing coalition as one seen as regressive towards them.\nHipkins occasionally also utilised the phrase to claim that Luxon would form an extreme right coalition with two parties, ACT New Zealand, led by David Seymour, and New Zealand First, led by veteran politician Winston Peters; Hipkins also used the term \"coalition of cuts\". Luxon's reversal on forming a coalition with New Zealand First - which he had previously refused to comment on - was justified by Luxon himself as averting Labour's \"coalition of chaos\".\nAfter National emerged as the largest party in the election and formed such a coalition with New Zealand First and ACT, opposition politicians used the term to describe Luxon's government, the Sixth National Government of New Zealand, instead. The term \"coalition of chaos\" and others related to it, such as the \"three-headed taniwha\", have since been used to describe the triumvirate-like power-sharing agreement between Luxon, Peters and Seymour, in which Luxon had made significant concessions in exchange for support. This included the potential of a referendum on the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi as proposed by ACT, which is extremely controversial.",

The company was acquired in June 2007 by a private equity firm, Cerberus Capital Management. It became part of the firm's Freedom Group, which was renamed in 2015 as Remington Outdoor Company. Remington Outdoor Company declared bankruptcy in 2018, from which it emerged, and in 2020, following which it was broken up.\nThe firearm portion of Remington Arms (excluding Marlin Firearms) was sold to Roundhill Group, LLC, and was then organized as RemArms, LLC. Vista Outdoor purchased Remington Arms' ammunition business, which it subsequently organized as Remington Ammunition. Vista Outdoor also purchased various intellectual property, including the Remington brand name. RemArms licensed use of the brand name from Vista Outdoor in order to market its products using Remington Firearms branding.\nBoth Remington Firearms and Remington Ammunition appear to claim Remington Arms' history, the former noting in a 2021 press release, \"Founded in 1816, Remington Firearms is one of the nation’s oldest firearms brands, operating for 205 years\" and the latter noting on its website \"We’ve been here since 1816.\"\nRemArms obtained a Federal Firearms License in early 2021, and resumed production of some firearms at the former-Remington Arms manufacturing facility in Ilion, New York. The company announced its launch in September 2021, via a video from its CEO.\nIn November 2021, the company announced it would relocate its global headquarters to LaGrange, Georgia, with plans to contain a new advanced manufacturing operation and a research and development center. In November 2023, it was reported that the company would end its operations in Ilion in March 2024 with approximately 250 to 300 employees affected by the plant closure.

Nxumalo's comments were condemned by human rights organisations and activists including the Human Rights Foundation, the Southern Africa Human Rights Defenders Network, the Swaziland Multi-Stakeholder Forum and Maxwell Nkambule.\nOn 27 March 2024, Maseko and her children were stopped at the South Africa-Eswatini border between Oshoek and Ngwenya when attempting to cross back into Eswatini. Immigration officials reported that Maseko's passport had been flagged as belonging to a wanted person; local police officers subsequently confiscated Maseko's passport and phone, and interrogated her for four hours at the Manzini Regional Police Headquarters before releasing her pending a further interview to be held the following day in Mbabane. It was initially reported that Maseko's wanted status was linked to the investigation into her husband's death.\nOn 28 March, Maseko's interview with police officers in Mbabane was halted after her lawyers challenged the legality of the police's refusal to permit them to be present. During her time in the station, activists from the Swaziland Rural Women's Assembly protested outside against Maseko's arrest.",

        "context": "On 25 August 2016, in a press statement signed by the SOKAPU President, Kaptain Solomon Musa, the SOKAPU leadership pointed out the previous confessions by the Kaduna State governor about knowing who the killers were doing nothing to stop the killings in the region, and challenged the people of Southern Kaduna to defend themselves, calling for el-Rufai's resignation. The protest, done in collaboration with the Coalition of Professionals led by Barr. Mark Nzamah Jacob, in Gwantu, followed the continuous killings of Southern Kaduna indigenous peoples in Sanga LGA, by Fulani herdsmen. The SOKAPU leader demanded that Southern Kaduna should be included in the joint military operations undertaken by the present government of Kaduna State in the forest and bushes of Birnin Gwari to rescue rustled cows and goats to save human lives and properties. An estimated figure of 10,000 indigenes of Southern Kaduna from 24 villages were said to have been killed since the invasion of their communities started in 2011. In addition, in 2014 in Sanga alone, about 30,000 refugees fled killing and arson by the herdsmen. In Musa's words, \"...those natives are yet to return home as herdsmen have converted they farm lands into grazing grounds, under arms.\" The leaders thanked the governor for visiting some of the affected communities but pressed on for more to be done after the usual political promise of ending the killings and nothing happening. They said two days after the governor's visit, the pastor of the RCCG, Ungwan Anjo, Godogodo chiefdom, Luka Ubangari, was killed by suspected herdsmen, adding that same herdsmen went to the Ningon Community and killed two men, Gambo Sule and Benjamin Auta, two days later. They lamented that with all those acts, no one has been arrested and charged, instead youths who put their lives on the line to protect their communities are the ones getting arrested and locked up always by the police and soldiers.  They recalled a statement made by Haruna Usman, the Kaduna State chairman of MACBAN, who said that the killing and destruction in Gada Biu, Akwaa, Ungwan Anjo and Godogodo were a revenge for the killing of a Fulani leader (or Ardo) in the area.\nIn January 2017, the Kaduna State Council of Imams and Ulamas led by its chairman, Sheikh Abubakar Babantune and secretary, Aminu Ibrahim, organised a press conference making accusations and calling for the arrest and prosecution of Southern Kaduna chieftains and Christian religious leaders including the senator representing Kaduna South senatorial district, Danjuma Laah; a member of the House of Representatives, Sunday Marshall Katung; clergymen like Rev. Zachariah Gado of 19 DCC Fellowship; CAN President, Samson Ayokunle; CAN Secretary-General, Musa Asake; former KASU lecturer, John Danfulani. They accused them of encouraging the killings in the region. They also called for the prosecution of Zamani Lekwot and five others sentenced to death by the Okadigbo tribunal investigating the 1992 Zangon Kataf crises. Furthermore, they asked for a review of the \"White paper of the Judicial Commission of Inquiry into Kaduna State Religious Disturbances of 2001\", pressing for the arrest of Elder Saídu Dogo, Archbishop P.Y. Jatau, and Archbishop B.A. Achigili; and the \"White paper on the report of the Federal Government Investigation Panel on the 2011 Election Violence and Civil Disturbances\", asking for the investigation of a History Teacher who slaughtered his student's father in her presence. \n\nIn June 2020, el-Rufai set up a 'White Paper Committee' to investigate the 1992 Zangon Kataf crises. According to Premium Times Nigeria's report by his special adviser on media and communications, Muyiwa Adekeye, The events of 11th and 12th June 2020 in Zangon-Kataf and Kauru LGAs offer compelling evidence that these persistent contentions over farmlands is a conflict trigger that has to be boldly addressed, rather than wished away.\nIn July 2020, Fulani chieftains represented by the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association (MACBAN) said there were 3,099 Fulani IDPs in Southern Kaduna. They also reported missing persons and lost animals.\nAs of 30 October 2020, at least 100 Southern Kaduna villages were under Fulani occupation according to SOKAPU. There had been incessant attacks across four Southern Kaduna LGAs since Nasir el-Rufai came in as governor of Kaduna State. These include Chikun, Kajuru, Kachia and Zangon Kataf. The pattern had been that of the killing of the indigenous population and replacement with the Fulani population.\nOther affected LGAs include Kaura, Kauru and Jema'a. After an attack by the terrorists on the indigenous communities, curfews were usually imposed by the state government and that gives room for further killings. Some of the killings especially in the Zangon Kataf axis were alluded to the 1992 Zangon Kataf crises, like in the case of 30-year-old Yusuf, an Atyap young man, whose mutilated body was found at the bank of the Kaduna River on June 10, 2020.\nWhenever youths from communities protest the act, they get arrested and detained while the killers go undetected. On 15 August 2020, a street reporter, Beevan Magoni, led a protest against the trends. Southern Kaduna youths in Kaduna, Abuja and Lagos went out peacefully to protest the killings which they termed as \"genocide\". Some youths got arrested in Kaduna by the police over the excuse of not informing the authorities of their plans.\nIn March 2021, soldiers opened fire on women peacefully protesting the indiscriminate arrests of their children in Kanai district, Atyap Chiefdom, killing one woman on the spot, shooting two others with one dying later on, and injuring many others.\n\nOn 31 March 2021, SOKAPU reported how the Commander of the Nigerian Army Operation Safe Haven, Major General Dominic Onyemulu, got about 15 Atyap community leaders among which were village heads, arrested. He was said to have tricked them into a meeting at one of their operational base on Ungwan Rimi-Bajju road, close to Kafanchan whence they were arrested. Their offence was said to be the killing of 75 cattle (figures later adjusted to 300) and some sheep. They stayed four days in military illegal incarceration, then passed to the Kafanchan Police Area Command. Among them was Waje Laah, an unwell 85-year-old great-grandfather. They were said to have been kept by the police for six days under dehumanizing conditions before being transferred to the Kaduna State Police Command Headquarters in Kaduna. In his words, the SOKAPU spokesman, Luka Binniyat said, \"Not a single Fulani leader has been called for questioning not to talk of being detained. We also said that under Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State, that has been the style of justice – victims are dragged and punished, while the alleged murderers are walking free with no consequence to their actions.\"\nIn February 2022, the MACBAN chairman in Kaduna, Haruna Tugga, said not less than 10 Fulani herders, including a one-year-old infant, were killed; with 99 cows either poisoned or missing between January 22 and February 2, 2022.\nAdara and Atyap lands, in particular, had been under constant Fulani terror attacks between early 2020 to mid-2023. Awemi Dio Maisamari, the National President of the Adara Development Association (ADA), said between January and May 2020, no fewer than 107 people have been killed, 49 injured, about 66 persons kidnapped, 111 houses burnt, 32 villages destroyed and about 20,000 displaced. Many Atyap villages were sacked and many killed in the same unprovoked attacks, a situation which the Hausa community in the Zangon Urban district had distanced itself from in spite of allegations levelled against it by the Atyap Community Development Association (ACDA) of harbouring Fulani terrorists in the settlement. \nOn May 1, 2023, the ACDA organized a World Press Conference to voice out the ongoing genocide in its territory. Sun News Online reported the ACDA National President, Samuel T. Achie saying, \"As of the last count, 20 villages have been displaced, 18 villages burnt down, while 518 people killed with thousands of victims who have taken refuge across many communities from 2017 till date.\" In less than 24 hours before leaving office on May 29, 2023, the state governor, Nasir el-Rufai proscribed the ACDA, calling it an illegal entity. In response, the National President of the ACDA said the proscription would be challenged in court because it is an infringement on freedom of association.\n\nIn April 2023, the SOKAPU National President, Awemi Dio Maisamari, advocated for a UN/AU base in Southern Kaduna. In his words, \"We advocate for a UN or AU Peace Enforcement Operations Base in Southern Kaduna. This will practicality demonstrate that the world is interested in our collective survival as minority ethnic groups. It must not abandon us to be hounded by well funded and well-armed herdsmen who are being encouraged and protected by their powerful kinsmen and collaborators in and outside Nigeria.  In the past 6 years, about 63 Atyap communities have been attacked, hundreds of homes burnt and hundreds of natives killed by pillaging armed herdsmen. Not a single Fulani is facing prosecution for these crimes. Ironically, scores of Atyap leaders have been arrested and put in jail over trumped up charges in the violence in which they are the victims.\"...\nIn March 2024, SOKAPU through its spokesman, Josiah Abraks, showed delight over the decision by the Governor of Kaduna State, Uba Sani, el-Rufai's successor, to resettle the displaced communities in Southern Kaduna with the inauguration of a 10-man committee.",

We also said that under Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State, that has been the style of justice – victims are dragged and punished, while the alleged murderers are walking free with no consequence to their actions.\"\nIn February 2022, the MACBAN chairman in Kaduna, Haruna Tugga, said not less than 10 Fulani herders, including a one-year-old infant, were killed; with 99 cows either poisoned or missing between January 22 and February 2, 2022.\nAdara and Atyap lands, in particular, had been under constant Fulani terror attacks between early 2020 to mid-2023. Awemi Dio Maisamari, the National President of the Adara Development Association (ADA), said between January and May 2020, no fewer than 107 people have been killed, 49 injured, about 66 persons kidnapped, 111 houses burnt, 32 villages destroyed and about 20,000 displaced. Many Atyap villages were sacked and many killed in the same unprovoked attacks, a situation which the Hausa community in the Zangon Urban district had distanced itself from in spite of allegations levelled against it by the Atyap Community Development Association (ACDA) of harbouring Fulani terrorists in the settlement. \nOn May 1, 2023, the ACDA organized a World Press Conference to voice out the ongoing genocide in its territory. Sun News Online reported the ACDA National President, Samuel T. Achie saying, \"As of the last count, 20 villages have been displaced, 18 villages burnt down, while 518 people killed with thousands of victims who have taken refuge across many communities from 2017 till date.\" In less than 24 hours before leaving office on May 29, 2023, the state governor, Nasir el-Rufai proscribed the ACDA, calling it an illegal entity. In response, the National President of the ACDA said the proscription would be challenged in court because it is an infringement on freedom of association.\n\nIn April 2023, the SOKAPU National President, Awemi Dio Maisamari, advocated for a UN/AU base in Southern Kaduna. In his words, \"We advocate for a UN or AU Peace Enforcement Operations Base in Southern Kaduna. This will practicality demonstrate that the world is interested in our collective survival as minority ethnic groups. It must not abandon us to be hounded by well funded and well-armed herdsmen who are being encouraged and protected by their powerful kinsmen and collaborators in and outside Nigeria.  In the past 6 years, about 63 Atyap communities have been attacked, hundreds of homes burnt and hundreds of natives killed by pillaging armed herdsmen. Not a single Fulani is facing prosecution for these crimes. Ironically, scores of Atyap leaders have been arrested and put in jail over trumped up charges in the violence in which they are the victims.\"...\nIn March 2024, SOKAPU through its spokesman, Josiah Abraks, showed delight over the decision by the Governor of Kaduna State, Uba Sani, el-Rufai's successor, to resettle the displaced communities in Southern Kaduna with the inauguration of a 10-man committee. This came after the State Security Council's recommendation issued on November 8, 2023, to resettle displaced persons in their original settlements.",

As a result, in most states and for most companies there are no limits to how they use, share, or sell their users data and no requirements to notify users when or how they do so.The laws which have been passed focus on specific types of data or specific populations of data subjects. The Privacy Act of 1974, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) of 1996, and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) of 1998, for example, regulate the use of data by federal agencies, how patients' health data is communicated, and aspects of collecting data about children. In the absence of a federal data privacy law, several states have passed laws to like the 2008 Biometric Information Privacy Act in Illinois and the 2018 California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). As of 2021, only California, Colorado, and Virginia had enacted comprehensive data privacy legislation.There have been multiple attempts to pass a comprehensive data privacy law, such as the Personal Data Privacy and Security Act of 2009 and the American Data Privacy and Protection Act (ADPPA) in 2022. Both had bipartisan support and passed committees, but were not brought up for a vote. A common sticking point in debates over these laws is the relationship between the federal law and current or future state laws. There has also been disagreement about enforcement, including whether users could use the laws as a basis to sue companies directly for privacy violations.",

The couple entered an agreement, witnessed by their friend musician Stepan Stepanovich Mitusov, that if Bilibin did not drink for a year, then O'Connell would stay with him. Bilibin did not keep his word, and O'Connell left Bilibin in September 1917, with Bilibin travelling to Crimea alone following the events of the Russian Revolution.: 195 \nMitusov wrote a comic poem about the breakdown of the couple's relationship.\nAfter her relationship with Bilibin had ended, O'Connell married mining engineer Sergei Nikolaevich Mikhailovsky. They had two children, a daughter and a son, and Mikhailovsky died in 1927.\nFrom 1922 to 1932, O'Connell-Mikhailovskaya was engaged to the workshops of the Leningrad Porcelain Factory, where she worked as a porcelain artist.

It was one of the longest hijackings in the history of commercial aviation. 84 passengers were on board with at least four crew members.The hijacking began after the plane stopped in Pereira, perpetrated by two former football players from Paraguay who initially claimed affiliation with the National Liberation Army (ELN). Armed and presenting varying demands, they initially sought to negotiate with the Colombian government for the release of all passengers and crew in exchange for a substantial ransom and the release of certain ELN members, expressing a desire to flee to Cuba. However, the government doubted their ELN membership, refusing direct negotiations with the hijackers. Consequently, the hijackers negotiated with the airline instead. After forcing the plane to land at Queen Beatrix International Airport in Aruba, where they released some passengers but failed to secure money, they directed the pilot to head to Jorge Chávez International Airport in Lima. A technical issue forced a return to Aruba, during which some passengers escaped due to the hijackers' oversight. Eventually, they reached Lima, where they negotiated for fuel and new pilots. The hijackers then decided to make stops in several South American cities: Guayaquil, Mendoza, Buenos Aires, Resistencia, and finally Asunción, where the hijacking ended after more than 60 hours.The hijackers, former football players Eusebio Borja and Francisco \"Toro\" Solano López, confessed to the crew that their sole motivation was financial. As the hijacking progressed, they sought notoriety and aimed to set a record for its duration. Borja disembarked at Resistencia International Airport and managed to evade capture; he has not been seen since.

The writing process for the collection involved Towles working at his desk for about four hours each morning. In the afternoon, he often sat at the bar of a restaurant to revise his work. During the drafting of the book, Towles also stayed for a week at the The Beverly Hills Hotel. In an interview with NPR, he described the stay as helping him to set the mood for his novella, Eve in Hollywood, which is set in the same city as the hotel, Los Angeles. Towles also talked with NPR about his decision to name the book Table for Two, stating the following:\n\nI was preparing to hand in the manuscript to my publisher, and I really didn't have a title at that time... What really leapt out at me was that in almost every story and in Eve, there are critical moments where there are two central characters sitting across from each other at a small table, often in a kitchen, and hashing out some significant element of their lives which has come to the surface through the events of that particular story.\nAt least one of the stories in Table for Two is autobiographical. In an interview, Towles recounted feeling incensed after observing a guest recording a performance at Carnegie Hall in violation of the facility's rules.",

        "context": "Wajda was born in 1934 in Newmarket, New Hampshire. Prior to his career as a jockey, he worked in a shoe factory in his hometown. By 1954, he was riding Thoroughbreds as an apprentice at Laurel Park in Maryland. By 1957, he was riding at Rockingham Park in New Hampshire and had picked up the nickname \"Hammerin' Hank\". In October 1957, while riding at Suffolk Downs in Massachusetts, Wajda twice won five races in a single day, each time winning four races consecutively.On September 6, 1958, Wajda set a world record at Rockingham Park; riding Mark Antony, he covered 1 mile and 70 yards—1,830 yards (1.67 km)—in 1:39+1⁄5, besting the prior record by 1⁄5 of a second.On June 30, 1960, while riding Lusty Andy at Suffolk Downs, Wajda pulled fellow jockey Anthony DeSpirito back onto Color Bearer after DeSpirito had been knocked off his saddle in the first turn and was clinging to his mount by one hand and had a foot caught in a stirrup. DeSpirito credited Wajda with saving his life. For his bravery, Wajda received honors from the New England Turf Writers and New York Turf Writers organizations.In 1961, Wajda's annual income was estimated at $40,000 ($407,840 in 2023). That year, he missed five weeks of riding after suffering a shoulder injury in a race at Lincoln Downs in Rhode Island. In June 1962, Wajda was thrown from horses twice in one day at Suffolk Downs—once in a race, and then again prior to the next race—but was not injured. In 1963, he was reportedly the highest-paid professional athlete in New Hampshire. That season, he won 73 races in 42 days at Suffolk Downs.Wajda died in 1973, as the result of a racing accident at Rockingham Park. Riding Zabush on July 28, 1973, Wajda fell from his mount after his right stirrup broke at the start of a race; he was kicked by the horse, and suffered a punctured lung. He died the next day following surgery in Methuen, Massachusetts.During his career, Wajda won 2224 races, finished second 2131 times, and finished third 1930 times, capturing over $6 million in winnings. At the time of his death, Wajda was a resident of Hollywood, Florida, and Raymond, New Hampshire. He had married Mary Lasofsky in June 1960 in Salisbury, Massachusetts. A race in his honor, the Henry Wajda Memorial Handicap, was established in 1974 and was held annually at Rockingham Park through at least 1997. In 2024, a New Hampshire historical marker (no.",

Although only 3% of its airtime was broadcast in Catalan, in breach of Catalan broadcasting law, which requires a minimum of 50% in Catalan, no sanctions were taken against the broadcaster.\nOn 20 April 2020, commercial channel Teve.cat began broadcasting, watchable from the regions of Barcelona and Tarragona, as well as part of Girona and Central Catalonia.\nRAC 105 TV closed on 1 June 2020, being replaced by Manresa-based commercial channel Fibracat TV, mainly targeting content relating to new technologies and feminism.\n\nDue to extremely low audience figures on commercial channel 8tv, broadcaster Group Godó announced the sale of Emissions Digitals de Catalunya on 5 March 2021, which, in addition to 8tv, included the frequencies of Barça TV, Fibracat TV and BOM Cine, to OC 2022, for ten million euros. It was authorised by the Catalan government in July 2021.\nOn 23 November 2021, BOM Cine was replaced by Verdi Classics, a commercial channel broadcasting films, mainly in Catalan.\nTeve.cat was shut down on 12 September 2022, date in which Canal 4 began broadcasting in the Barcelona region.\nIn October 2022, the sale of EDC was realised, forming part of OC 2022. The rebrand of 8tv was heralded as an attempt to compete with TVC, and one of the slogans used by 8tv when it was re-launched was \"TV3, are you ready?\". It was also announced that the broadcaster would begin to focus on full Catalan-language programming in order to achieve this competition, although on the very day of the rebrand the broadcaster continued to broadcast a large amount of content in Castilian.\nFibracat TV was closed on 31 December 2022, after the company stopped paying rent for the frequency in June 2021.\nOn 2 June 2023, the company managing 8tv, Emissions Digitals de Catalunya, declared a debt moratorium, and began a 3-month period to renegotiate the debt with its creditors. Due to financial issues, Barça TV was closed that month, on 30 June 2023.\n\nAt a press conference in May 2023, the Corporació Catalana de Mitjans Audiovisuals announced the merger of Televisió de Catalunya and Catalunya Ràdio under a new brand, 3Cat, scheduled for 2028.\nOn 10 October 2023, Super3 was replaced by SX3, a rebrand of TVC's youth programming channel, displaying an S3 logo for children audiences and an X3 one for young viewers and more mature programmes. Although it still shared its frequency with El 33 on terrestrial television, it had now been made available online throughout the day. It was started in response to the very poor audiences of the former Super3.\nAfter having obtained several overtime concessions from the Catalan government, the company behind 8tv filed for bankruptcy and the channel was due to cease broadcasting at midnight on 15 October 2023. However, broadcasts continued both through terrestrial television and the internet until a few minutes after midnight on 17 October 2023, when both 8tv and Verdi Classics stopped broadcasting, marking the end of the whole of Catalan commercial television. As of May 2024, Catalonia's commercial multiplex (MAUT-CAT-2) continues to be empty.\nOn 30 October 2023, the CCMA launched the new 3Cat digital platform, replacing the old 3alacarta video-on-demand service and the TV3 mobile application. On the same day, channels 3/24, SX3, Esport3 and El 33 began broadcasting in HD, exclusively online, via the new platform, with terrestrial broadcasts continuing in SD quality.\nOn 8 January 2024, three months after the closure of 8tv, the station began operating again through the Internet, still self-proclaimed as \"the commercial television of Catalonia\", but now broadcasting entirely in Castilian. Some of its programmes are also broadcast through terrestrial television through Canal 4, which broadcasts in the Barcelona region, Mallorca and the community of Madrid.\nAlthough the Spanish government had set the date to switch-off all SD television signals on 14 February 2024, Televisió de Catalunya announced on 12 January 2024 that they would carry out the switch-off a month earlier, on 16 January 2024. The SD version of TV3, the only TVC channel broadcasting through terrestrial in HD, was to be switched off, while all the other channels, which only aired in SD, would automatically switch to HD. Additionally, the Balearic channel IB3 Global, which was broadcast in Catalonia with a poor SD quality due to the limited space left in the multiplex, also switched to HD and a better-looking bitrate on that day.",

He also made his senior debut for Brønnøysund before moving to Mosjøen to attend upper secondary school. With this came a transfer to Mosjøen IL, where he experienced relegation from the 2017 3. divisjon. He moved to Bodø to take higher education, which also entailed a transfer to IK Junkeren, though the 2020 season of the lower leagues was cancelled. In 2022 Kristiansen scored 10 league games as Junkeren won promotion to the 2023 2. divisjon. After the 2022 season he went on trial with Sogndal, but stayed in Junkeren.\nPlaying his first seson on the third tier in 2023, several transfer bids were rejected in the first phases of the 2023 summer transfer window. In August, a bid from Åsane was accepted, and then another from Ranheim, with Kristiansen being close to finalizing a transfer to the second tier. However, Junkeren's neighboring club, and dominant Norwegian club in the 2020s, Bodø/Glimt, suddenly entered the process. The move to Bodø/Glimt was confirmed on 16 August, and was regarded as surprising. His unassuming career before suddenly making the leap from the third tier to a club in European competition was described as \"the beauty of football\".\nWhile Kristiansen only reached as far as being benched for two of Bodø/Glimt's league games and the two 2023–24 UEFA Europa Conference League qualifying phase and play-off games against Sepsi, the fellow first-tier team Sandefjord saw fit to procure Kristiansen ahead of the 2024 season.",

After encountering significant problems in scaling some types of workloads using traditional database systems, Sanfilippo began in 2009 to prototype a first proof of concept version of Redis in Tcl. Later Sanfilippo translated that prototype to the C language and implemented the first data type, the list. After a few weeks of using the project internally with success, Sanfilippo decided to open source it, announcing the project on Hacker News. The project began to get traction, particularly among the Ruby community, with GitHub and Instagram being among the first companies adopting it.\nSanfilippo was hired by VMware in March, 2010.\nIn May, 2013, Redis was sponsored by Pivotal Software (a VMware spin-off).\nIn June 2015, development became sponsored by Redis Labs.\nIn August 2018, Redis Labs announced the switch to a proprietary source-available software license, Server Side Public License. Initially the change was said to affect only some optional modules primarily developed by Redis Labs.\nIn October 2018, Redis 5.0 was released, introducing Redis Stream – a new data structure that allows storage of multiple fields and string values with an automatic, time-based sequence at a single key.\nIn June 2020, Salvatore Sanfilippo stepped down as Redis' sole maintainer. Sanfilippo was succeeded by Yossi Gottlieb and Oran Agra.\nIn 2024, the Linux Foundation created a fork of Redis under the name of Valkey, allowing community maintainers, contributors, and users to continue working on an open source version of the Redis database.",

The Dorchester village council approved funding for making repairs to the wooden sculpture and building a viewing platform for it. In 2021, repairs were unable to be made after MacMillan discovered that the sculpture's wood had started rotting, and his tools getting stolen prevented him from being able to rebuild it. In order to replace the sculpture, the village council commissioned one made with steel, epoxy and fibreglass from Robin Hanson. The new sculpture was built at a cost of $9,300.On January 1, 2023, as a result of the 2023 New Brunswick local governance reform, Dorchester was amalgamated with Sackville into the newly-formed town of Tantramar. Paying Hanson for the sculpture became less prioritized by the new town council, resulting in individuals and organizations attempting to raise funds towards covering costs themselves. On April 8, 2023, the new sculpture was transported to Dorchester and reinstalled by local volunteers rather than by municipal officials, which was well-received by residents. This resulted in controversy within the new council, with former Dorchester council member Debbie Wiggins-Colwell supporting Shep's return, while other officials, such as Tantramar mayor Andrew Black considering the statue to be an insurance and liability risk for the municipality. After considerations were made that Wiggins-Colwell had violated municipal codes of conduct, a third-party investigation was conducted by Montana Consulting in October 2023, costing the municipality $19,167.11.",

He began playing junior football at nine years of age when signed up to play for the Palm Beach Currumbin Lions alongside future AFL teammates Jed Walter and Will Graham. Read joined the Gold Coast Suns Academy at 13 years of age, but was not considered a standout in his early teenage years.\nAt 16 years of age, Read experienced an 11 cm growth spurt and he was subsequently put on the radar of several AFL teams due to his newly developed 200 cm frame. The following year he received national exposure for the first time when as a bottom ager he was selected to represent the Allies several times in the U18 National Championships as well as the Gold Coast Suns Academy in the U19 Talent League. His performances at the representative and club levels led to Read being placed in the AFL's 30-player National Academy program on the eve of his draft year and he was generally considered a second round draft prospect at the time.\nRead moved into top 10 draft calculations when he played a starring role in the Allies' historic first U18 National Championship win and his performances earned him the starting ruckman position in the 2023 U18 All-Australian team. A month later he made his VFL debut for the Gold Coast and impressed many onlookers by quickly adjusting to the higher standard of football when he recorded 12 disposals, four scoring shots as well as multiple inside 50 marks in an impressive first game outing.",

Despite being a political newcomer, his self-funded grassroots campaign attracted sufficient attention that ABC news reported that it seemed that both the Labor and Liberal candidates were treating him as their main opposition. \nHis decision to direct preferences on his how-to-vote cards to the ALP candidate Justine Keay ahead of the Liberal Party's Brett Whitely saw his attract the ire of then federal senator for Tasmania Eric Abetz, who held a press conference to highlight that Garland had pleaded guilty to an assault charge in Victoria in 1994.  Garland responded that the charge related to an incident where he had stepped in to help a group of friends who were being bashed, stating \"I've got nothing to hide whatsoever. If I was faced with the same situation again and had two young blokes being chased down the road being bashed, I'd do the same thing again.\" He added that \"They're clutching at straws. Obviously, they're worried about me... They've got a minority view, they want to rule — they're an elitist, self-entitled pack of pricks.\" Senator Abetz later criticised Garland's use of offensive language in calling him a \"prick\".\nHe went on to contest the 2019 election for the federal Senate in Tasmania, polling just over 1% of the vote. \nIn 2021, Garland co-founded The Local Party (later named The Local Network) and contested the state seat of Braddon in the 2021 Tasmanian state election for the party. However, Garland left the party and contested the 2022 Australian federal election and 2024 Tasmanian state election as an independent.\nIn the 2024 state election, he received approximately 5.1% of the first preference votes in the seat of Braddon.",

This was a precursor of the Walk Again Project. Previously, in 2000, Nicolelis had already demonstrated, in a publication in Nature, the possibility of a computer decoding an ape's brain signals in order to move a robotic arm. The project, which began in 2009, is a partnership between institutions in the US, Switzerland, Germany, and Brazil.\nIn one of its first steps, published in 2011, the project team made a monkey control a mechanical arm and receive tactile information from this tool, including in the virtual world, with the team's research being welcomed \"as an important advance by the scientific community\", according to Veja magazine. That year, in his book “Beyond boundaries”, Nicolelis described his plan to make a patient take the opening kick of the FIFA World Cup, in a project budgeted at R$33 million at the time (U$S 15,305,489.56 in 2013), and funded by Finep.\n\nIn 2012, in the process of creating the BRA-Santos Dumont exoskeleton for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, the project team recorded 1847 neurons simultaneously, something, until then, unprecedented. The next research project saw mice being able to sense tactile information from infrared light, as a possible new form of BMI communication. The following year, the project received authorization to test the exoskeleton in Brazil, with volunteers from the Association for Assistance to Disabled Children testing the equipment since the beginning of November 2013.\nWhen he returned to Brazil for the project, Nicolelis found that the patients did not want to undergo surgery as a way of regaining movement.",

Topically, the song is \"a playful look at the truths of modern-day dating\" born out of Ashton's realization that the guys who called her crazy are the ones who always call her back: \"This wasn't some fancy hook or poetic notion that I stumbled across, it was just the cold hard truth hit me one day.",

The deal worth over $1 billion involved the sale of convertible preferred stock and warrants to HBC and other investors. The deal had large potential upside if the company recovered and limited downside for HBC as its exposure was hedged.\nOn March 30, 2023, Bed Bath & Beyond terminated its deal with HBC and instead tried to sell up to $300 million of common stock in the open market with the offering led by B. Riley Financial. Before the deal was terminated, Bed Bath & Beyond had raised at last $360 million where HBC had converted its preferred stock and warrants into at least 300 million new common shares and sold them on the open market by relying on retail investors. Bed Bath & Beyond and HBC amended the deal terms to preserve the deal even though the company stock had dropped below $1.00 which would have been a violation of the deal. However Bed Bath & Beyond stated it anticipated it would not be able to meet the conditions of the deal and terminated it. By April 2023, Bed Bath & Beyond had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\nIn May 2024, Bed Bath & Beyond sued HBC to recover over $300 million in trading profits from their deal to pay off its creditors such as Sixth Street Partners. The lawsuit was filed under the short swing rule which was allegedly applicable to HBC as it was a shareholder that owned more than 10% of Bed Bath & Beyond's outstanding shares and therefore had to give any profits from short-term trading during a given six-month period to the company. The lawsuit alleged HBC orchestrated the terms of the deal so it could acquire a large stake in it at a deep discount without having to disclose the ownership. HBC aimed to make a quick profit by capitalizing on the company's popularity as a meme stock. In response, HBC stated Bed Bath & Beyond's creditors were behind the lawsuit and that it never owned more than 10% of its shares.  HBC had ended up with almost 98% of the common stock underlying the preferred shares and warrants issued in the deal. While HBC incorporated blockers to prevent it owning more than 9.99% of Bed Bath & Beyond, the lawsuit alleges the company never enforced them as it had no incentive to do so as it needed cash and also had no mechanism to enforce them.",

The Australian Football League (AFL) is one of the rare fully professional leagues to have no active—or even retired—players to publicly identify as gay or bisexual despite more than a century of elite competition and at least 16,885 players in the VFL/AFL, although multiple players at an amateur level or semi-professional level have come out (specifically, many players in AFL Women's have come out as gay or bisexual).\nPlayers at non-professional level have come out, including Jason Ball, and he launched a campaign to tackle homophobia in Australian rules football. However, the first player to come out to the public was a man named Matt Hall, who contracted HIV in 1996 and was banned from the Victorian Amateur Football Association due to his diagnosis. Hall came out in 2002 and actively worked to fight the stigma until his sudden death in 2023.\nWhile no gay or bisexual professional players have come out, former AFL coach and premiership player Danielle Laidley (formerly known as Dean Laidley) was outed without her permission by a police officer in May 2020 for being transgender; the police officer in question was stood down. The outing occurred after Laidley was arrested and charged with one count of stalking. She did not apply for bail. She was allegedly found with 0.43 grams of methamphetamine in her bra at the time of her arrest. A Victoria Police officer distributed photos of Laidley in women's clothing taken while she was in custody. In December, the officer was charged with unauthorised access and disclosure of police information as well as misconduct in public office. Three other officers were accused of the same breach. In November 2020, Laidley was placed into a diversion program and given an \"adjourned undertaking with no conviction recorded\" on the stalking charge.\nBesides members of the LGBT community, controversy has arisen as former players such as Jason Akermanis—while not homophobic himself—controversially advised in a 2006 article that gay and bisexual players should keep their sexual orientation secret, which ended his career at Brisbane; he doubled down on this stance in 2023.\nIn more recent times, the AFL has taken a strong stance against homophobia, including publicly supporting the Yes vote for marriage equality, including temporarily changing its logo to \"YES\" in support. The survey was ultimately successful in overturning Australia's marriage laws, with more than 61% of respondents voting in the affirmative.\nThe AFL took a particularly strong stance against homophobic slurs in the 2024 AFL season, handing out significant suspensions to players who have used such language.

        "context": "Overwatch initially showed promise for an esports scene during its beta phase in 2015, attracting teams from around the world to compete upon its full release. While an open ecosystem for its esport was quickly established, its publisher Activision Blizzard elected to create the Overwatch League, a franchised league akin to that of North America's NBA, with slots being sold for a reported US$20 million for its inaugural season in 2018. The league faced challenges early on, including a slow start in its inaugural years and logistical issues exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Additionally, the announcement of Overwatch 2 in 2019 brought about changes to the game's format and gameplay, which received a lukewarm response upon release in 2022. These challenges, coupled with controversies such as the sexual harassment lawsuit in 2021, led to mounting pressure from teams to exit the league. Months before Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard, teams were offered the chance to leave the Overwatch League, ultimately leading to its closure in January 2024.\nThe Overwatch Champions series (OWCS) was established in January 2024 following the folding of Overwatch League. Unlike the previous approach of independently managing the league, Blizzard Entertainment opted for partnerships to oversee specific regions, with ESL FaceIt Group operating the North America and EMEA regions, while WDG was selected to operate the Asia region. The Overwatch Champions Series adopted open format, departing from the franchise structure of the Overwatch League. This transition opened up opportunities for both established organizations and new entrants, with teams like ENCE and Team Falcons joining the series well-established teams such as Fnatic and TSM. Former Overwatch League teams such as the Toronto Defiant also remained active after the closure of the Overwatch League, competing with a new roster in the OWCS.",

This change in ownership marked a crucial juncture in SugarBun's journey, signaling both growth and evolution as it continued to expand its presence in the market.\nIn 1997, SugarBun's parent company, Borneo Oil, reached a notable achievement by being listed on the Second Board of the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE).  This event not only reinforced SugarBun's position within the industry but also paved the way for potential opportunities.\nThe year 2001 marked another crucial phase for SugarBun with the introduction of a revamped menu featuring a diverse range of Asian dishes. This menu transformation encompassed additions such as Chicken Mushroom Soup, Sambal Eco Fish, Assam Eco Fish, Nasi Lemak and Chicken Curry, complementing the existing favorites. The introduction of these new offerings not only led to a notable surge in sales but also fostered greater customer engagement with the brand.\nDuring this period, numerous SugarBun outlets were strategically co-located with Applebee's Bakery and Caprilla Ice Cream Cafés, providing customers with a multifaceted dining experience all under one roof. This innovative approach aimed to offer patrons a diverse range of culinary options in a convenient setting.",

On January 29, 2020, Dallas District Court Judge Mary Brown ruled that joint custody would remain in place. However, on August 3, 2021, Brown awarded full custody of the twins to Georgulas, ruling that Younger \"failed to timely make the payments of child support, medical support and interest as ordered\". Georgulas' legal team claimed that Younger, in addition to paying child support late, had refused to carry out court orders including required counseling and educational decisions, while Younger argued he had made payments on time and they had just been disbursed late. According to the ruling, both parents still had to consent to any hormone therapy, puberty blockers or gender-affirming surgery for Luna.\nOn November 23, 2021, Younger filed to run for the Texas House of Representatives in District 63 as a Republican. He sought to criminalize gender reassignment for children as part of his campaign. Younger advanced to the primary runoff, but lost to Ben Bumgarner.\nIn February 2022, Governor Greg Abbott issued an order to investigate parents in Texas for child abuse if they provided certain medical treatments to their transgender children, which The New York Times noted Younger's case had \"paved the way for\".\nOn December 16, 2022, after Georgulas had moved with the twins to California, Younger filed a petition with the Texas Supreme Court seeking to return the children to Texas.",

They were started by a few sit-in protestors against rising prices of wheat flour and electricity. They were soon followed by a boycott of electricity bills, which went unpaid in most areas of Azad Kashmir.\nThe protestors maintain that the power projects in Azad Kashmir generate 3,000 megawatts of cheap electricity, a third of Pakistan's power generation, but the Azad Kashmir consumers are charged prices five times the cost of production. This is said to be in violation of the Constitution of Pakistan which prohibits the government of Pakistan from making a profit from the residents of Azad Kashmir.\nSeveral rounds of negotiations between the governments of Azad Kashmir and Pakistan, as well as those between the Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC) and the government of Azad Kashmir have failed to produce results, leading the movement to question the mandate given by the United Nations to Pakistan during the Kashmir conflict.\nIn September 2023, protests were held in all major towns of Azad Kashmir with thousands of protestors, and traders' associations, transporters and lawyers observed a strike. A call for strike was also given for 5 February 2024, which is normally observed as the Kashmir Solidarity Day.\nMuzaffarabad Public Action Committees called for a \"long march\" to Muzaffarabad, the capital of Azad Kashmir, on Saturday, 11 May, to come from all parts of Azad Kashmir. The federal government mobilised 600 personnel of Punjab Constabulary and an unspecified number of Frontier Constabulary in a bid to block the march.",

For several years, Al Attar has been working with the Syrian director Omar Abusaada. Her theater is characterized by both fictional and documentary elements.\nAl Attar's earliest play, Withdrawal, was performed in a cramped apartment in his hometown; his second, Could You Please Look into the Camera, followed a massive wave of arrests in his country. This text consists of testimonies from prisoners who were tortured in military prisons.\nBetween 2013 and 2017, Al Attar and Abusaada performed a trilogy about the fates of refugee Syrian women, which is based on classical Greek tragedies. His adaptation of Iphigenia after Euripides was shown in 2017 at the Volksbühne in Berlin, preceded by The Trojan Women after Euripides in Jordan and Antigone of Shatila after Sophocles in Lebanon.\nIn the 2023/24 theatre season, the German premiere of Al Attar's work Damascus 2045 took place in the Theater Freiburg. The piece, set in a utopian future, addresses “the mechanisms of forgetting, the writing of war history and the narratives of the victors and the vanquished.” In March 2024, his play A Chance Encounter premiered in the same German theatre. In the plot, which is based on a real event, Anas, one of the main characters, meets the other protagonist, Walid Salem, by chance in Berlin. In the ensuing court case, both men try to remember their encounter ten years ago during an interrogation by the Syrian secret service.",

Throughout 2023, his candidacy was taken for granted by political figures of the party such as Roberto Cláudio, the interim national president of the party André Figueiredo and the former governor of Ceará Ciro Gomes. At the same time, Ciro's political group had internal disputes in the state directory with his own brother Cid Gomes, who is an ally of the governor Elmano de Freitas, from the Workers' Party (PT).\nElmano supported an alliance between the two parties, since this political alliance has been broken in a state level since the election for governor in 2022 (which was won by Elmano) and since 2012 in mayoral elections. This issue made some of the state deputies of Ceará support the candidacy of the president of the Legislative Assembly of Ceará, Evandro Leitão, for mayor in 2024. Since Leitão didn't had any space in the party to run for mayor, he left the Democratic Labour Party and joined the Workers' Party afterwards in order to run in the 2024 elections.\nIn February 2023, the politician Capitão Wagner, now a member of Brazil Union (UNIÃO), announced that he could run again for mayor of Fortaleza in 2024, a position for which he ran in 2016 and 2020. His optimism came from the fact that he lost the last election to Sarto by a small margin of votes and by the fact that he was also the most voted candidate in Fortaleza in the 2022 Ceará gubernatorial election. Wagner even supported an alliance with names from the conservative right in Ceará, such as the federal deputy André Fernandes, from the Liberal Party (PL), and the senator Eduardo Girão, from the New Party (NOVO). Both Fernandes and Girão announced their own candidacies in 2023. Their political groups are linked to the former president Jair Bolsonaro and to the opposition in a statewide and city level.\nAmong other parties, the Socialism and Freedom Party (PSOL) started a debate to launch their own candidacy or to invite parties and social movements to join its ticket, even though Adelita Monteiro's, a member of the party, is part of Elmano's government as a state secretary.",

The funicular railway had recorded a ridership of 1.74 million throughout 2018 and Penang officials were seeking an alternative mode of transportation to reduce the overdependence on the railway. The federal government allocated RM100 million for the cable car project in the 2020 budget, with additional costs to be borne by the Penang state government. The Penang Rifle Club, situated adjacent to the Penang Botanic Gardens, was selected as the ground station over other areas such as Teluk Bahang.\nA political crisis in 2020 led to the removal of the Pakatan Harapan-led federal government by the right-wing Perikatan Nasional. As a result, federal allocations promised for the cable car project were cancelled. Despite this, in 2021, the state's Chief Minister Chow Kon Yeow announced a request for proposal for the project, citing \"tremendous\" public support. The project was to be awarded through a public–private partnership framework, with the selected developer given a 30-year concession to design, finance, build, operate and transfer the system. Six proposals were received by the Penang Hill Corporation (PHC) and in 2022, Malaysian firm Hartasuma Sdn Bhd was awarded the project.\nAs the cable car project is to be undertaken on slopes between 25 and 35 degrees, federal government oversight was required, involving traffic impact (TIA) and environmental impact (EIA) assessments. To build and operate cable car systems at ecologically sensitive areas, the PHC sought technical expertise from Switzerland and Austria; Penang Hill had been inscribed as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 2021. In 2023, Chief Minister Chow announced that the cable car infrastructure would be provided by Doppelmayr/Garaventa Group.\nThe cable car project received approval from federal government environmental regulators in 2024.",

The army embarked on military campaigns until Egypt's territory expanded and they reached the Levant to consolidate their influence and protect their northern borders.

The Egyptian army was also the first army to pledge allegiance to its Tulunid masters rather than the Abbasids.\nAhmad Ibn Tulun exaggerated in enlarging the size of his army and strengthening it, motivated by the conspiracies, intrigues, and temptations that were being hatched against him in the capital of the Abbasid state, so its number reached one hundred thousand fighters, as previously mentioned. Ahmad Ibn Tulun controlled this huge army based on a well-thought-out and drawn-up policy. He made his officers from among the Turkics close to him. This army was always ready to carry out what was asked of it, and it occupied its members with hard training and suppressing temptations and conquests. It allowed them to gain wealth and gain prestige, and provided them with comfort. He preferred them over himself, and said that they were related to him like children to fathers. Therefore, he lavished on them generously, and payed their salaries on time.\nThere was no revolution during his reign that was attributed to the lack of wages, which his contemporaries were accustomed to. Rather, he would sometimes grant a year's salary as a pure grant to them, so that their hands and hearts would be strong.\nKhumarawayh ibn Ahmad ibn Tulun went to extremes in spending on the army in terms of uniforms and weapons. He dressed its members in silk caps and brocade gilets, designed belts for them, and adorned them with decorated swords that they placed on their shoulders. This was in line with the luxury that dominated life in his era, which included almost everything. If they walked in front of him and his convoy he arranged each sect with its uniform and weapons, the al-Mukhtara squad (his private squad) first, then the rest of the military, followed by the Blacks.\nKhumarawayh took care of training his army. He assigned each sect its role in fighting, and he lavishly spent money on its members, giving them more than his father had given them. He would give them their gifts on a regular basis, and distribute gifts to them in abundance on every occasion, in addition to the spoils of war that they took as rewards, which made them loyal to the state and bind them to it with a bond based on mutual interest. The army's expenses amounted to nine hundred thousand dinars annually.\nThe status of the army rose as a result of this increased attention, and its soldiers and commanders became a stronger influence than they were in the days of Ahmad Ibn Tulun. Its leaders gained control of the estates, and its sects played a major role in the state's foreign policy, especially in the wars of the Levant and the defense of the emirate. Khumarawayh also took an interest in the naval fleet, and it played an important role in the wars that the Tulunid prince fought in the Levant by supporting land campaigns.\nThe new Egyptian army fought many battles in which it won glorious victories, the most important of which were the Levantine border (al-Thughur al-Shamia) wars against the Byzantines, the sack of Byzantine Thessaloncia, the Battle of Tawahin against the Abbasids, and the war of Mahammad ibn Ali al-Khalanji to restore the Egyptian Tulunid state.\nIn the book “The Army in Egypt in the Tulunid and Ikhshidid Era,” its author, Dr. Faten Mahammad al-Bandari, says that the Egyptian army during those two eras was a force to be reckoned with by the Abbasid state and other powers in the Islamic world and outside it.

The Egyptian army was also the first army to pledge allegiance to its Tulunid masters rather than the Abbasids.\nAhmad Ibn Tulun exaggerated in enlarging the size of his army and strengthening it, motivated by the conspiracies, intrigues, and temptations that were being hatched against him in the capital of the Abbasid state, so its number reached one hundred thousand fighters, as previously mentioned. Ahmad Ibn Tulun controlled this huge army based on a well-thought-out and drawn-up policy. He made his officers from among the Turkics close to him. This army was always ready to carry out what was asked of it, and it occupied its members with hard training and suppressing temptations and conquests. It allowed them to gain wealth and gain prestige, and provided them with comfort. He preferred them over himself, and said that they were related to him like children to fathers. Therefore, he lavished on them generously, and payed their salaries on time.\nThere was no revolution during his reign that was attributed to the lack of wages, which his contemporaries were accustomed to. Rather, he would sometimes grant a year's salary as a pure grant to them, so that their hands and hearts would be strong.\nKhumarawayh ibn Ahmad ibn Tulun went to extremes in spending on the army in terms of uniforms and weapons. He dressed its members in silk caps and brocade gilets, designed belts for them, and adorned them with decorated swords that they placed on their shoulders. This was in line with the luxury that dominated life in his era, which included almost everything. If they walked in front of him and his convoy he arranged each sect with its uniform and weapons, the al-Mukhtara squad (his private squad) first, then the rest of the military, followed by the Blacks.\nKhumarawayh took care of training his army. He assigned each sect its role in fighting, and he lavishly spent money on its members, giving them more than his father had given them. He would give them their gifts on a regular basis, and distribute gifts to them in abundance on every occasion, in addition to the spoils of war that they took as rewards, which made them loyal to the state and bind them to it with a bond based on mutual interest. The army's expenses amounted to nine hundred thousand dinars annually.\nThe status of the army rose as a result of this increased attention, and its soldiers and commanders became a stronger influence than they were in the days of Ahmad Ibn Tulun. Its leaders gained control of the estates, and its sects played a major role in the state's foreign policy, especially in the wars of the Levant and the defense of the emirate. Khumarawayh also took an interest in the naval fleet, and it played an important role in the wars that the Tulunid prince fought in the Levant by supporting land campaigns.\nThe new Egyptian army fought many battles in which it won glorious victories, the most important of which were the Levantine border (al-Thughur al-Shamia) wars against the Byzantines, the sack of Byzantine Thessaloncia, the Battle of Tawahin against the Abbasids, and the war of Mahammad ibn Ali al-Khalanji to restore the Egyptian Tulunid state.\nIn the book “The Army in Egypt in the Tulunid and Ikhshidid Era,” its author, Dr. Faten Mahammad al-Bandari, says that the Egyptian army during those two eras was a force to be reckoned with by the Abbasid state and other powers in the Islamic world and outside it. Rather, it was the strongest Islamic armies at the time. To demonstrate this, the author discusses, in extensive detail, the human structure of this army, its military organizations, the arts of mobilization and fighting as it was relied upon, and finally its weapons and supplies. Ahmad Ibn Tulun was allowed to gain independence in Egypt from the Abbasid state, which was preoccupied with suppressing strife and revolutions and the weakening influence of its caliphs.\nHence, the author says that the personality of Ibn Tulun had a great impact on his wise leadership of the Egyptian army, especially given his military and religious upbringing in Tarsus. But creating the first Egyptian Islamic army independent of the Abbasid state was not an easy task at all. To ensure superiority, and to curb the ambitions of the Byzantines in particular, Ibn Tulun had to prepare and mobilize the army in a completely new way. In this regard, Ibn Tulun himself says: “I endured the great burdens and the heavy supplies by attracting everything described with courage and summoning everything described richly... what I had prepared to surround the state from the dense armies and multiplying armies.”\nAs the author explains, the Egyptian army in that era included Turkic, Maghrebi, Nubian, Byzantine, Arab, and Egyptian elements, but the heaviest of them were the Egyptians, of whom alone there were about 70,000 soldiers. This is in addition to what historical sources mention that Ibn Tulun used some of his Turkic family and appointed them to leadership positions. The Egyptians also had leadership roles, especially in the last phase of the Tulunid state and then the Ikhshidid state.\nRegarding the military organizations during the two states, the author focuses on leadership, recruitment, and the army office. The Tulunids, and after them the Ikhshidids, followed special systems in assuming leadership and carrying out its tasks. The title of “Amir of Jihad” evolved into, in that era, “Army Commander,” “Chief Commander,” “State Manager,” or “Wāli of War.” Leaders were chosen on the basis of possessing qualities and characteristics such as horsemanship, experience, and possessing the characteristics of leadership.\nAs for soldiers and conscription, the author concludes from historical sources that Ibn Tulun came to Egypt accompanied by soldiers with a high degree of training and loyalty. He used them to defeat his opponents and they were the first nucleus of the new army. As a culmination of this strong beginning, Ibn Tulun recruited huge numbers from Sudan, and then large numbers of all elements joined the Egyptian Tulunid army.\nThe author says that the Tulunids and Ikhshidids paid great attention to military reconnaissance and gave it their attention. Military mobilization and the preparation of soldiers to fight were at a high level in the two eras, as the army was mobilized into two parts: cavalry and footmen (infantry), and each of them had its role in the fighting.",

Artist Jane Beaird illustrated the band depicting them as anthropomorphic cats for the first EP record release in 2021, which has become reoccurring iconography in following releases by the group.\nFantastic Cat's first LP The Very Best of Fantastic Cat released in 2022, produced by Joe Poletto with Michael Hesslein, Tyler Rigdon, Randdy Schrager, and Andrew Zehnal as additional musicians. The cover art features the band members photographed by Shervin Lainez. The album cover's blurb parodies prior rock bands with multiple singer-songwriters claiming comically it had \"never been done\" before listing several famous supergroups such as The Beatles and The Highwaymen. Reviewer Jon Young for No Depression favorably compared the album's opening track \"C'mon Armageddon\" to Bob Dylan's \"Subterranean Homesick Blues\" and it's protest message against former US president Donald Trump. Reviewer Shawn Donohue made comparisons of the album to the music of Delta Spirit, Bruce Springsteen, Jackson Browne and Monsters of Folk. In an enthusiastic review for Americana Highways, critic John Moore stated \"If there is any justice in this world, this would be the first in a series of shows, followed by another record. Even the Traveling Wilburys gave us two albums (and The Highwaymen gave us three).\" Fantastic Cat would perform several songs from the album on CBS Saturday Morning in August 2022.\n\nFantastic Cat throughout 2023 would issue singles covering Warren Zevon's \"Keep Me in Your Heart\" and  Paul McCartney and Wings' \"Band on the Run\".

During this meeting, Boer claims he acknowledged having communications with the complainant, but denies that the communication was inappropriate. Boer also claims the board told him to limit communication to only family and a trusted advisor or he would face termination.\nOn 24 February 2024, the lawsuit states Boer was given a 15-minute meeting with the board to defend himself. After the meeting, the board told him they had the votes to fire him and was given a 7 pm deadline to decide if he would resign. This deadline was later moved up to 5 pm by the board's chair. At 4:55 pm, Boer agreed to resign as president. Following his resignation, the board released a statement that the lawsuit alleges to contain several statements that defame Boer with mentions of the Title IX due process, despite the process never being afforded to him.\nFollowing his resignation, Boer claims he was told they had until 15 April to move out of their home, the DeWit Manor. Boer attempted to negotiate an extension to this, however, no deal was made between him and the university. On 2 April 2024, the suit claims that Calvin officials entered the home and changed all the locks to prevent the Boer family from reentry.

In particular, the F-35A and F-35C can carry the missile internally, while other aircraft like the F-35B and F-22 would carry it on external pylons. According to Lockheed Martin, an F-35A or C could carry six Makos between internal and external bays. The P-8A Poseidon, known for maritime patrol and surveillance, has received fit-checking and could also adapt the Mako for offensive missions. According to Naval News, the missile is fitted with multiple types of guidance system, and it is expected to be able to engage many, if not all, of the same targets as the SiAW as well as maritime targets.",

Ben Beaumont-Thomas of The Guardian called it \"an indulgently rich record that keeps revealing more on double-digit listens.\" According to Luke Morton of Kerrang!, \"the heaviness throughout is unrelenting.",

A bipartisan group of lawmakers called for a federal investigation in funding of SJP. Columbia university and Rutgers university suspended the SJP chapter in their university in late 2023. In late November 2023, the center for Antisemitism research found that 73% of Jewish college students and 43.9% of non-Jewish students experienced or witnessed antisemitism in the 2023–2024 school year.\nIn the first 16 days after the October 7th massacres by Hamas against Israel there was an increase of 400% in antisemitic incidents, including assault, harassment and vandalism against Jews in the United States, the Washington Post said that some of the most visible instances of antisemitism occurred in US campuses.\nIn 2023 the American Jewish Congress released a report that found that 44% of Jewish students were affected by antisemitism on campus. 25% of Jewish students avoided wearing or displaying items that could identify them as Jewish. More than 50% of Jewish students were excluded or felt excluded from other students more than once.\nOf the non-Jewish students targeted 46% said it was because they were assumed to be Jewish.

When photons, by chance, of the right frequencies are emitted into the whispering gallery modes, it stimulates other molecules to emit more matching photons, amplifying the light.\nA soap bubble's thickness is constantly changing due to freely flowing water inside the bubble.

        "context": "Greek Women of Souli Running to Their Death is an oil painting created by female French painter Constance Blanchard.  Blanchard was born in Paris and she was active in the early part of the 19th century between 1820 and 1840.  She created a painting entitled Jesus Christ in 1822 but also painted the full-length Portrait of Mademoiselle G (Portrait en Pied de Mme de G.) that same year.  Two years later she won second place in an art competition and painted The Virgin Our Lady of Good Help (Une Vierge. Notre Dame de Bon Secours), a full-length Portrait of Madame la Marquise de la V. (Portrait en Pied de Mme la Marquise de la V) and she also painted additional portraits that same year.  By 1831, she completed a work entitled Assumption of the Virgin (Une Assomption) and even more portraits.  In 1835, she completed another version with the same theme of the Assumption of the Virgin (Une Assomption) and by 1838 she finished the Greek Women of Souli Running to Their Death.  King Charles X of France presented one of her paintings with the Savior and the sister's Mary and Martha to the Sisters of the Visitation of the Georgetown Visitation Monastery in Washington, D.C.\nDance of Zalongo was a tragic event that occurred as a result of the Souliote War. As legend has it, sixty women and children escaped capture and fled to the mountain of Zalongo where they were trapped. Instead of surrendering which would have led to lifelong enslavement, torture, and rape the women decided to throw their children off a cliff and tragically followed them falling to their death on the rocks while singing and dancing.  Countless European and American articles were written about the event and artists began to commemorate the theme.  Ary Scheffer painted Les Femmes Souliotes in 1827, Filippo Agricola painted Young Albanian being chased by a Turk in 1833, Dance of Zalongo was another work created by Claude Pinet in 1855,  Alphonse Marie de Neuville painted Courage des femmes Souliotes around the same period and Theophilos Hatzimihail painted Dance of Zalongo in 1929.",

Delacroix popularized the Greek War for Independence (1821–1829) with a series of paintings and many French painters were eager to continue the theme.  The work marks the end of romanticism and the dawn of realism.  Women of all ages appear and young children are scattered around the crowd of women.  The woman's lavish costumes denote the traditional attire of Northern Greece around that period.  The haunted expressions and frightful gazes build the anxiety of that moment.  To the far left, behind the cross in the smoke, the silhouette of soldiers appears as they are approaching.  The smoke from their fire darkens the sky.  The children appear restless and some women embrace their small children clasped to their bosoms.  One woman to our left embraces the cross, another woman prays to the cross with her right arm elevated.  The female statuesque figures are wearing elaborate jewelry.  A young mother wearing a turban, red scarf, and white dress clutches a little girl in a yellow dress to her breast as the young girl's back is turned to the sea.

        "context": "The Western Pacific Railroad originally built the Warner Branch (also referred to as the \"Tooele Branch\" in some timetables) in 1917 to connect the Western Pacific to the Tooele Valley Railway, accessing the traffic from the International Smelting and Refining Company plant in Tooele, Utah. An interchange with the Tooele Army Depot was built in 1943 providing further traffic along the branch. Following the merger between the Western Pacific Railroad and the Union Pacific Railroad the branch would be deemed surplus, and was largely abandoned. Rails were removed from Tooele to the unincorporated community of Marshall, Utah in 2003. A significant portion of the right of way on the Tooele to Grantsville portion of the Warner Branch exists presently as the Mid-Valley Trail.\nIn 2020, the Romney Group (owned by Josh Romney, son of Utah senator Mitt Romney) and NorthPoint Development broke ground on the Lakeview Business Park, north of the Utah Motorsports Campus. The Savage Tooele Railroad was founded as a common carrier railroad under parent company Savage (who operate the nearby Savage Bingham and Garfield Railroad in Salt Lake County) to restore and operate the Warner Branch to the business park and filed an appeal in 2021 with the Surface Transportation Board to begin construction of the railroad line. The project was backed by Utah governor Spencer Cox and representatives John Curtis and Chris Stewart, but concerns were raised by the Environmental Protection Agency due to the railroad's proximity to wetlands near the Great Salt Lake. Tooele County agreed to replace a segment of the Mid-Valley Trail right of way with a bypass segment, to clear the right of way for the Savage Tooele Railroad. Motions to begin construction on the railroad were denied in 2021 and 2022, pending the completion of an environmental report which was finished in 2024, after a draft environmental report had been issued in 2023.\nIn February 2024, the STB granted permission to the Union Pacific Railroad to restore the upper portion of the Warner Branch to service for interchange with the Savage Tooele Railroad. BNSF Railway had appealed for lengthier STB proceedings to allow access to interchange with the Savage Tooele Railroad via trackage rights, however currently the STB has denied this appeal.",

It was replaced by a second town hall, which was deemed inadequate by the early 19th century and needed to be replaced. Like the earlier buildings, the current building was purpose-built as a town hall. It was designed in the neoclassical style, built in red brick and was completed in about 1820. The architectural historian, Nikolaus Pevsner, noted that, despite its municipal purpose, it resembled a large town house.\nAfter the local rural sanitary authority was succeeded by Wymondham Urban District Council in 1894, the new civic leaders decided to establish their offices and meeting place within the town hall. The building continued to serve in that capacity for much of the 20th century, but ceased to be the local seat of government when South Norfolk District Council was formed at Farthing Green House in Loddon in 1974.

Based on his internships at JZD Slušovice, the author analyzes the organization and internal structure of this company and the mechanism of its activity.\nIn 1999, director Robert Sedláček filmed the documentary František Čuba: The Slušovick miracle,  which retrospectively describes and explains the main factors of the Slušovice company and its post-revolutionary forced disintegration.\nThe success of Slušovice also left its mark on Czech popular culture, the singer-songwriter duo Miroslav Paleček and Michael Janík wrote a song about Slušovice called Slušovice (it was released on their CD Kukátko and something else ). The song was also heard in the big revue program of Czechoslovak Television from 1988, which was called Jedeme dál ze Slušovice and was filmed at the Parkhotel in Slušovice.

The aim of the boycott is to pressure Loblaw into making a 15% reduction on their grocery prices, and signing Canada's Grocery Code of Conduct, a proposed process created by Agriculture and Food ministers throughout Canada to “address the concerns of processors, producers and independent grocers regarding increased retailer fees on suppliers and the need for balance in the supplier-retailer relationship, while also ensuring that Canadians continue to have access to a reliable food supply at affordable prices.” Previously, Loblaw as well as Walmart have both refused to sign onto the code of conduct.",
        "passage_text": "On the same day marking the start of the boycott, Loblaw reported CA$459 million in profits out of CA$13.58 billion in revenue during the first quarter of 2024, a 9.8% increase in profits and a 4.5 percent increase in revenue from last year.",

After suspending its flights from Hong Kong to Saipan in 2019, Hong Kong Airlines announced that it would reintroduce its exclusive direct route to Saipan. Despite confidence from Hong Kong Airlines, the worsening relations between the United States and China signals that Chinese and Hong Kong tourists, once a cornerstone of the local tourism industry, will likely not return to the levels seen before the COVID-19 Pandemic. Less tourists from China will likely negatively impact the economy because, as Marianas Visitors Authority board chair Gloria Cavanagh points out, based on numbers the MVA has collected, Chinese tourists coming into the CNMI outspend their Korean counterparts by multiple times. However, it appears that Chinese tourists, despite tensions with the United States, as well as Japanese and Korean tourists, despite their ongoing economic woes with a weaker Yen and Won compared to the Dollar, continue to come to the CNMI as the number of tourists have increased in January, February, and March of 2024 compared to the same months in 2023, though still below pre-pandemic levels. \nThe declining population has led to lower tax revenue and worse social services and economic conditions, leading to more people leaving and creating a cycle that is difficult to break and is placing pressure on the local government, especially on the incumbents.\nA defining aspect of Governor Arnold Palacios' Administration is austerity. On April 24, 2023, the Palacios Administration placed some executive branch employees on a 72-hour work schedule, reduced from 80 hours. On October 4, 2023, Palacios reduced the work schedule to 70 hours.

        "context": "On the economic front, the Northern Mariana Islands faces many problems that were present in the 2022 general election. The territory is still attempting to recover after the COVID-19 Pandemic and its aftermath caused a complete collapse of the local tourism industry, creating a massive economic burden on the territory. Airlines have sent mixed signals on tourism recovery. Asiana Airlines suspended its flights and switched to a charter schedule until June 2024, citing low demand and the Commonwealth Ports Authority (CPA) adoption of a 90 percent hike in landing fees and a 79 percent increase in terminal rental fees back in September 2023. However, United Airlines and Hong Kong Airlines show positive attitudes towards economic recovery. Dan Weiss, United Airlines managing director for Global Government and Regulatory Affairs, stated that United is pleased with the performance of their “relatively new” Saipan-Tokyo Narita service. After suspending its flights from Hong Kong to Saipan in 2019, Hong Kong Airlines announced that it would reintroduce its exclusive direct route to Saipan. Despite confidence from Hong Kong Airlines, the worsening relations between the United States and China signals that Chinese and Hong Kong tourists, once a cornerstone of the local tourism industry, will likely not return to the levels seen before the COVID-19 Pandemic. Less tourists from China will likely negatively impact the economy because, as Marianas Visitors Authority board chair Gloria Cavanagh points out, based on numbers the MVA has collected, Chinese tourists coming into the CNMI outspend their Korean counterparts by multiple times. However, it appears that Chinese tourists, despite tensions with the United States, as well as Japanese and Korean tourists, despite their ongoing economic woes with a weaker Yen and Won compared to the Dollar, continue to come to the CNMI as the number of tourists have increased in January, February, and March of 2024 compared to the same months in 2023, though still below pre-pandemic levels. \nThe declining population has led to lower tax revenue and worse social services and economic conditions, leading to more people leaving and creating a cycle that is difficult to break and is placing pressure on the local government, especially on the incumbents.\nA defining aspect of Governor Arnold Palacios' Administration is austerity. On April 24, 2023, the Palacios Administration placed some executive branch employees on a 72-hour work schedule, reduced from 80 hours. On October 4, 2023, Palacios reduced the work schedule to 70 hours. Governor Palacios and his administration, through Directive 2024–1, also continued \"Austerity Monday,\" which began in October 2020 when his predecessor, former Governor Ralph Torres, implemented it. Austerity Monday calls for the government to be closed every Monday following a payday or on a Tuesday if that Monday happens to be a holiday. The Commonwealth Ports Authority board also adopted an eight-hour cut for all CPA employees and suspended its airline incentive program. Palacios and his coalition government implemented these measures to address fiscal issues but have placed significant strain on the local economy and could pose an issue to the current governing coalition of Independents and Democrats.",

Lives stated that the game aimed to recapture the experience of reading through the fictional bestiaries of the Monster Manual of the Dungeons and Dragons series of role-playing games. Following a series of abandoned prototypes, Lives revisited the concept upon discovering the analog horror subgenre, and decided to create a game under the working title The Lunar Archives inspired by the aesthetic of \"90s media formats\" including the user interface of the Windows 95 operating system. The monsters included in the game were a mixture of Lives' own creation and existing mythological entities, with additional inspiration from the SCP Foundation series of fiction and the horror artwork of Trevor Henderson Eduardo Valdés-Hevia. Lives created imagery for the game by importing source photography into Photoshop and transforming them into digital paintings, exporting the imagery at a reduced level of quality to meet the 90s aesthetic for the game. Home Safety Hotline was announced alongside the release of a demo in June 2023 at the Steam Next Fest, and showcased in late 2023 at the DreadXP Indie Horror Showcase and the Double Fine Day of the Devs. The game was released on Steam on 17 January 2024.",

Weddings, zakats and the annual Eid al-Adha boost the sale of these animals. As a totally Islamic country, pig farming and consumption of pork are simply nonexistent. The wool of the slaughtered sheep is used to make Afghan rugs, clothing, and other products.\nAfter the completion of the major Qosh Tepa Canal and new dams, animal husbandry is likely to increase dramatically. Small number of people raise other animals in Afghanistan, such as camels, horses, ostriches, turkeys, peacocks, ducks, rabbits, and pigeons.\nPoultry farming is widespread in the warmer parts of the country. In 2022, there were over 10,000 poultry farms in the country. Some of the largest and modern ones are in the provinces of Balkh, Helmand, Kandahar, Khost and Nangarhar.

During his studies, Stawaisz was diagnosed with cancer and spent months fighting the disease after which he eventually recovered. After joining a Catholic retreat (Aggie Awakening Retreat), he began discerning the vocation to priesthood.\nAfter graduating from college, Stawaisz declined employment opportunities in order to fully discern his priestly vocation. He entered Saint Joseph Seminary College in Covington, Louisiana, where he earned a degree in philosophy. He pursued his studies further at Saint Mary's Seminary in Houston, Texas, and shortly before his ordination, he received another cancer diagnosis. Despite his diagnosis, he was ordained to the diaconate and eventually to the priesthood on 1 June 2019.\nHe began his priestly ministry at Prince of Peace Catholic Church as a parochial vicar.  While undergoing medical treats, which, at times, causes him to be confined in hospital facilities, he continued performing his ministries, being passionate about increasing vocational awareness in the diocese and celebrating the sacraments.\nStawaisz died on 21 June 2021, with the reputation for holiness.",

        "context": "Graphic Nature were formed in mid-2018 by vocalist Harvey Freeman, guitarists Pete Woolven and Matas Michaliovskis, bassist Charlie Smith and drummer Jack Bowdery. Whilst Freeman is from London, the other members of the band are based in Kent, England. Prior to forming Graphic Nature, Woolven, Smith and Bowdery had played together in the metalcore band Cove, whilst Freeman had played drums in various bands before becoming a vocalist around 2015. The band took their name from the Deftones song of the same name, from their seventh album Koi No Yokan (2012). Over the course of a year, the band wrote between five or ten songs in a variety of styles, ranging from metalcore to hardcore. After Woolven sent the band a rough demo of \"Grit\", they decided to pursue a nu metal sound. In 2022, Freeman told Rock Sound:Nu metal was such a big influence on us [...] We were playing music we didn't love as much as the music we grew up with, and if you're not playing something you enjoy then what's the point [in] playing it? So we decided to put more 90's riffs into it, and more electronics.Graphic Nature released their debut single, \"Grit\", on 21 August 2019. By February 2020, the band had released two more singles, \"Mortal Fear\" and \"Dis[in]fect\", and played a number of shows supporting larger bands including Creature, Gassed Up, Heart of a Coward, Lock & Key, Monasteries, MTXS and Palm Reader. Of the reception to Graphic Nature's music, Freeman said that the audiences they played to \"either fucking [loved] it or [had] no idea what to do.\" The band began writing material again in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns, with the plan of releasing two EPs in one year. Freeman said that the lockdowns helped the band's members \"find [their] own segments\", and it inspired him to write about his experiences and challenges with mental health and isolation during the pandemic. In August 2021, Graphic Nature signed to Rude Records, who reissued the band's back catalog of singles. \nOn 25 February 2022, Graphic Nature released their debut EP, New Skin. During 2022, the band played shows with Employed to Serve, Ho99o9, Cancer Bats, Witch Fever, Vended, Vexed and SeeYouSpaceCowboy. By the time the EP was released, the band were already working on new material in the studio, and the planned second EP was turned into the band's debut album, A Mind Waiting to Die. The band planned on releasing the album in September 2022, but it was pushed back to avoid competing with Slipknot, who were releasing an album in the same month. The album was released on 17 February 2023, receiving mixed-to-positive reviews from critics. Kerrang! and Rock Sound both listed the album as one of the best of 2023, and both it and Graphic Nature received nominations in the \"Best Breakthrough Album\" and \"Best UK Breakthrough Live Artist\" categories at the Heavy Music Awards 2024. Following its release, Graphic Nature performed at the 2023 editions of the 2000trees, Download, Reading & Leeds and Misery Loves Company festivals.\nOn 4 April 2024, Graphic Nature announced their second album Who Are You When No One is Watching? and released the single \"To the Grave\". The album was partially inspired by Freeman's struggles with PTSD after he was physically assaulted in early 2023.",
