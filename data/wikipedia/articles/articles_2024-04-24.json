        "content": "Jaime Garcia Alsina (28 March 1874 – 20 September 1936) was a Spanish doctor, professor of medicine and gymnastics, and sports promoter and leader. During the first decades of the 20th century, he was involved in many Catalan sports initiatives, both in gymnastics and athletics, being the second president of the Catalan Athletics Federation in 1917–18, and again in 1920–21, and 1922–23. He was also the first president of the Catalan Olympic Committee and a key figure in the development of sport and Olympicism in Catalonia. He organized gymnastic tables, athletic competitions, \"School Hygiene\" congresses and had an outstanding militancy in various entities.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nJaime Garcia was born on 28 March 1874 in Barcelona, as the son of Pere Garcia i Corbera (1833–1903) and Josepa Alsina i Gonfaus, who already had three children from her previous marriage, including sports promoter Eduardo Tolosa, who are thus half-brothers.\nHis father founded the Gimnasio García in 1868 in Barcelona to give lessons to the fire department, of which he was the chief, and later opened it to the public.\n\n\n== Professional career ==\nFollowing in the footsteps of his father, he founded the Gimnasio Garcia Alsina in 1904, which would become known as the \"Kinesiterapic Institute\", which had a garden and the most modern equipment of the time, competing with the Gimnasio Blume in terms of training gymnasts and winning titles. It was not only Garcia's gym, but also his therapeutic center. This sports center was the first place in Spain in which women's basketball (November 1912) and Swedish gymnastics, among other sports, were practiced. Lectures by Josep Elías on sport and Olympism were also held there, and in 1913, he gave the conference that marked the starting point of Catalan Olympism. Garcia also worked as a professor of medicine and gymnastics, and introduced the practice of sports as a hygiene and health benefit.\nIn addition to all the specialties he had, Garcia must not have had enough, and in 1910 he went on a European excursion with his friends from Los Deportes and La Veu de Catalunya, which served to increase his notoriety and offer news from abroad, such as those of Basketball. Along with Narciso Masferrer, Ricardo Cabot, and Josep Elías, Garcia was one of the pioneers of sports journalism in Catalonia. With them, he founded the Union of Sports Journalists in 1911, whose purpose was to defend, regulate and disseminate sports journalism which until then was self-taught.\n\n\n== Sporting career ==\nIn 1915, Garcia was one of the founders of the Catalan Athletics Federation, the very first federation of such in Catalonia, becoming its first treasurer under the presidency of Àlvar Presta. On 15 January 1917, he was appointed as the second president of the institution, a position he held for over a year, until 15 March 1918, when he was replaced by Joan Matas (only because Elías did not accept it). In total, he held the presidency in three different periods between 1917 and 1923. He was also the first president of the Spanish Wrestling Federation in 1914 as well as the first president of the Catalan Wrestling Federation between 1924 and 1932, which he himself founded. He left the presidency of the Catalan Federation in 1932 and the Spanish Federation two years later, occupying the honorary presidency.\n\n\n== Olympism ==\nGarcia organized events and conferences to promote the culture of Olympism and the creation of the Olympic Committee of Catalonia (COC), which was founded in 1920 as a subcommittee of the Spanish Olympic Committee (SOC). Garcia was elected first president of the Catalan Olympic Committee, which he represented in the 1920 Olympic Games in Antwerp, where he met Baron de Coubertin. At the opening ceremony of the 1920 Games, he paraded behind the Marquis de Villamejor. In 1924, COC authorized the development of weightlifting at his gym, and also commissioned him to organize a competition for the selection and preparation of athletes with the aim of the 1924 Games in Paris, which he attended as a delegate of the wrestling team since at this time he was president of the Catalan and Spanish Greco-Roman Wrestling Federations. \nDue to the failure of the SOC to request the celebration of the 1924 Games for Barcelona, the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera decided to purge the Catalan managers, including Garcia, on 11 January 1924. In the following year, on June 25, 1924, he decided to found the Agrupació Olímpica del Gimnàs Garcia as a \"cultural and sports society whose objective is the regeneration of our race, through the practice of the Olympic trials and as a basis gymnastics sports\". On 12 July 1924, the organization was officially established, having as a mission the sending of Spanish representatives to the Olympic Games; this was the first Olympic committee in Spain in accordance with the Law of Associations of 1887. At last in 1926, Garcia was readmitted to the COE, which was the one registered as an Olympic Group in the registry of the Civil Government instead of the Alsina Group. He was thus a member of the Spanish Olympic Committee (1926), in which, in 1931, he presented Barcelona's candidacy to host the 1936 Olympic Games.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nDuring the 1930s, Garcia was a delegate of the SOC and organizer of conferences in order to promote gymnastics, sport, and hygiene among the young and the elderly. He collaborated with the Ministry of Public Instruction of the Directorate of Primo de Rivera, studying the regulations of National Physical Education and pre-military Instruction and making known what physical education and sports were like abroad by organizing an International Graphic Exhibition of Physical Education, Physiotherapy, Sports and Tourism in his gym. In 1934, he promoted the First Catalan Congress of Physical Education, chaired by Augusto Pi, being a member of it together with the likes of Carles Comamala. \n\n\n== Personal life ==\nHis son, Joan Garcia y Rodríguez, had been the leader of the Catalan Winter Sports Federation and participated in the 1936 Winter Olympics in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. Both Garcia and his son were assassinated during the first days of the Spanish Civil War on 20 September 1936 (the same day that he was to participate in the Winter Olympics) by one of the many groups of \"uncontrolled\" people who spread terror among right-wing people and Catholics in Barcelona. His corpse appeared tortured and disfigured next to that of his son.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Eduardo Tolosa Alsina was a Spanish professor of calligraphy and gymnastics educator who founded the Gimnàs Tolosa in the 1880s under the name Gimnasio Médico, a Barcelona multi-sport gymnasium. Toghet with his wife Emília Colomer, he was a pioneer in women's gymnastics, being the director of a recreational Gymnasium for both sexes and with separate departments in the 1890s.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nEduardo Tolosa was born in Vila de Gràcia, as the son of Eduard Tolosa i Alsina and Josepa Alsina i Gonfaus. He was the youngest of three children, Aurelio (1861–1938) and Trinidad. After his father died in the early 1870s, his mother remarried, now with Pere Garcia i Corbera (1833–1903), and one of their children was the doctor and sports promoter Jaime Garcia Alsina, who was thus Tolosa's half-brother. His stepfather founded Gimnasio de Gracia in 1868.\nTolosa married Emília Colomer, and the couple had two children, including Eduardo, one of the world's first neurosurgeons, a pioneer in the surgical treatment of Parkinson's disease and discoverer of the Tolosa–Hunt syndrome.\n\n\n== Sporting career ==\nTolosa was one of the few Catalans who studied at the Escuela Central de Gimnástica in Madrid (1887–1892), a short-lived school that worked as the first Spanish center for the specific training of Physical Education teachers, thus being one of the few teachers with an official gymnastics title in Barcelona. In the 1880s, Tolosa founded the Gimnàs Tolosa under the name Gimnasio Médico, a Barcelona multi-sport gymnasium where fencing, athletics, boxing, and Greco-Roman wrestling was also practiced. With a hygienist tradition, it was much frequented by the Catalan bourgeoisie at the end of the 19th century and it was domiciled on Carrer del Duque de la Victòria.\nTolosa and his wife were in charge of directing \"theoretical and practical gymnastics\" in the gymnasium rooms that they both owned. His wife Emilia Colomer, who in Barcelona stood out – according to the press – as the most accredited female teacher in teaching gymnastics, worked at the Escuela de Institutrices (School of Governesses), a school for women, and also worked at the Sagrado Corazón and Nuestra Señora de Loreto schools, and in the Municipal Schools of Barcelona, as well as in other prestigious schools. This aspect shows how teachers dedicated to physical education, whether men or women, had to combine several jobs at the same time to make a living from this profession. Tolosa played a crucial role in contributing to making the practice of women's gymnastics visible, becoming the director of a recreational Gymnasium for both sexes, with separate departments, shower and massage rooms, and all the derivations known in Gymnastics.\nIn 1898, under the guidance of physical education teacher Jaime Vila Capdevila, Gimnàs Tolosa organized the first official race in Barcelona, which ran between Barcelona and Sarrià. The sport of football began taking root in the city in the 1890s, and soon it gained followers among members belonging his gym, where Tolosa and Vila were introduced to football by his younger students, and soon the gym's members created the football team Sociedad Deportiva Tolosa, which trained at the Velódromo de la Bonanova. In the same year, Vila and his students founded in a meeting held at the Tolosa Gym, the Català FC, the second-ever official football club in Barcelona behind Joan Gamper's FC Barcelona, which was also founded in a gym, the Gimnasio Solé of Francisco Solé. In fact, Tolosa, Vila, and Solé, as well as Narciso Masferrer and Ángel Rodríguez, began to promote football among that generation of Barcelona gymnasts to being an outdoor sport, which they considered as more appropriate to Spain's climate and their national peculiarities, hence why most of the first Barcelona clubs were born in gyms and under the protection and encouragement of characters linked to the Spanish Gymnastics Federation, such as Vila and Masferrer.\nIn 1900, the Tolosa Gym joined the Spanish Gymnastic Federation, which at the time was under the presidency of Rafael Rodríguez Méndez, and it continued to organize gymnastics evenings during the first half of the 20th century until it disappeared before the Spanish Civil War.\n\n\n== Professional career ==\nTolosa later became a teacher in both Secondary Education and Normal Schools. According to the yearbook of the University of Barcelona of the 1902–03 academic year, which at the time was under the rectorship of Rafael Rodríguez Méndez, Tolosa was a teacher of calligraphy who lived in Duque de la Vitoria, as well as a \"special assistant\" of gymnastics.\nIn 1909, Tolosa, then the teacher of calligraphy at the Institute of Barcelona, together with fellow professors of drawing and calligraphy from the Normal Schools of other cities, sent a declaration to the Ministry of Public Instruction stating that by virtue of the second paragraph of the Royal order of 25 November 1908, they \"must occupy the top of the ranking of the calligraphy teaching staff\", which they eventually achieved since they had performed their positions since 1898 without interruption. On 7 July 1910, the general director of the Ministry of public instruction sent for examination \"the calligraphy program of the professor of the Barcelona Institute Eduardo Tolosa y Alsina\". Tolosa was also a gymnastic assistant at the Institute of Barcelona.\nThe date of his death is unknown.\n\n\n== References ==",

The pie originates in the Region of Murcia, particularly in the municipalities Murcia, Santomera, Cieza, Abanilla and the neighbouring town Orihuela. It has roots in Arab cuisine.\n\n\n== History ==\nMeat pies have been eaten in Spain since the Middle Ages. They were consumed in much of Spain and the Murcian recipe has been preserved to this day, enriched by local gastronomy. In 1695, a mandate by Charles II established the correct measurements, the quality of flour to be used and outlined exile penalties on artisans who did not comply with the standard.\nSince 2009, a day is dedicated to celebrating the Murcian meat pie in Murcia each April. During this day, thousands of meat pies are distributed free of charge to the entire public in Murcia.\nDue to its national fame and its tradition in regional gastronomy, it is sold across many other regions of Spain outside the Region of Murcia.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nIts circular base is made of shortcrust pastry and its upper coverage is made of fine puff pastry in the shape of a spiral. Each pie serves one person, with each pie being about 15 cm in diameter. There is a variety called \"especial\" that incorporates lamb brains into the basic filling.\n\n\n== Local variations ==\nYecla: Murcian meat pies from here generally do not have the characteristic spiral on its top.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMeat pie\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Woke mind virus, sometimes shortened to WMV, is a term used to refer to anything which is perceived to be closely connected to \"wokeness\" and left-wing politics with particular emphasis on actions or ideas that encourage the suppression of freedom of speech and anti-meritocratic ideals.\nWoke mind virus is a neologism which has gained widespread use among politically right leaning or conservative pundits and audiences, most especially in the United States and after the early 2020s.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nWoke Mind Virus as a term has been widely used by politicians such as Ron DeSantis, entrepreneurs such as Elon Musk, and talk show hosts like Bill Maher. WMV as a term has been criticized as a politically charged or pejorative term that according the The New York Times, \"...Is eating away at Republicans brains...\" The term is used mostly by right leaning, conservative, Republican, libertarian, or sources other than politically left leaning sources. \nTerms such as \"structural racism\", \"patriarchy\", \"white privilege\", \"systemic racism\", and \"intersectionality\" are all reported buzz words that signal subscription to a \"woke mind virus\" concept.\n\n\n== Usage ==\n\n\n=== Elon Musk ===\nThe Woke Mind Virus term was first majorly popularized when used by Elon Musk on the X app (formerly Twitter) in December 2021. Musk has been a heavy and frequent user of the term since, including statements such as:Unless it is stopped, the woke mind virus will destroy civilization and humanity will never reached [sic] Mars.Musk has stated that he believed also that Yale University is a \"...epicenter of the woke mind virus attempting to destroy civilization.\" Musk has also attributed the homeless problem of San Francisco to the woke mind virus. The Washington Post reported that Musk partly bought twitter to \"rid [the app] of 'woke mind virus'\" Other commentators such as Bill Maher have used the WMV term as a derisive term used to describe a perceived widespread lack of critical thinking and easy or ready acceptance, primarily among youth, of far-left or progressive political ideas (at the sacrifice of humanity primacy considerations).\nIn a April 2023 interview between Maher and Musk, Maher asked Musk, \"You have talked about this woke mind virus in really apocalyptic terms. You should explain why you don’t think it’s hyperbole to say things like it’s pushing civilization toward suicide. First of all, what is the woke mind virus?\", to which Musk responded:I think we need to be very cautious about anything that is anti-meritocratic and anything that results in the suppression of free speech. So, those are two of the aspects of the woke mind virus that I think are very dangerous—that it’s often very anti-meritocratic and you can’t question things. Even the questioning is bad. So, you know, another way to … almost synonymous would be cancel culture...The Atlantic reported Musk and X with the label of far-right in association with the use of the WMV term. Other sources have also stated that the term is a far-right term though Musk, a major proponent of the term, denies that he is either far-right or far-left, and that the term is not either. Musk also reportedly bought X in part as a reaction to his daughter's transition as a transgender person and Musk's interpretation of her far-left political beliefs being \"infected with the woke mind virus.\" After being booed by the audience of standup comedian Dave Chappelle in 2022, Musk reupped his rhetoric stating, \"The Woke Mind Virus Is Either Defeated Or Nothing Else Matters.\"\nOn the Lex Fridman podcast Musk called the WMV a \"civilizational threat\".\n\n\n=== Other uses ===\nFlorida Governor and former presidential candidate, Ron DeSantis has frequently used the term. \nVanity Fair has a story under the \"Woke Mind Virus\" label. USA Today said that the term \"woke\" had been \"co-opted by GOP activists\" Left-wing economist Paul Krugman has stated defended wind energy farms saying that, \"...the bigger picture, I’d argue, is that renewable energy has become a victim of the anti-woke mind virus.\"\nSome sources have argued that \"red America\" has \"declared war on Corporate America\" as a result of \"wokeness\" and the \"woke mind virus.\"\nCritics of Netflix streaming service claimed that \"woke mind virus\" concerns around left-wing political agendas being woven into the plot of various programs was hurting the service's reach and viewership.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCollective narcissism\nEcho chamber (media)\nEmotional contagion\nFilter bubble\nGo woke, go broke\nGroupthink\nHerd behaviour\nIndoctrination\nSystem justification\nTone policing\nViruses of the Mind\n\n\n== References ==",

According to the definition category guide, the award is for recordings characterized by a prominent use of electronic instrumentation, often featuring a dance rhythm and incorporating elements of Latin vocal and instrumental music, including subgenres such as EDM, electro, electronic, house, disco, techno, etc.\nThe recording should prioritize established dance and electronic music recordings, with at least 51% of the playing time dedicated to Latin electronic music genres, as determined by the committee. It should also encompass emerging genres and Latin influences to accurately represent current trends in Latin electronic music. Recordings that include interpolations or samples are eligible, provided that these elements constitute no more than 25% of the lyrics and/or 51% of the music of the original song. Latin electronic remixes are also considered for the award. The statuette is awarded to solo artists, duos or groups.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website of the Latin Grammy Awards",

        "content": "Las barbas de plata (English: Silver Beard) is a Spanish fairy tale from Cádiz, published by Spanish scholars Julio Camarena and Maxime Chevalier. It is about the marriage between a human maiden and the Devil disguised as a suitor, but a talking mule rescues the maiden to another kingdom, where she marries a human prince. Spanish and Portuguese scholars locate similar tales in Iberian Peninsula.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nA widowed father has an only daughter, and issues a proclamation: he will only marry her off to a suitor with a silver beard. One day, the man is drinking his coffee, when a stranger appears to him, with the silver beard, as the proclamation stated. The stranger announces he intends to marry the man's daughter. The man calls for his daughter Mariquilla, who consents to the marriage, to be held on Saturday. Mariquilla goes to take her mule, when the animal begins to talk to Mariquilla, asking her to bring a bag of clothes and take a ride on it on Saturday, without telling anyone where she is going.\nOn Saturday, the stranger comes and a carriage is ready to take Mariquilla, but she takes the mule and rides away from home, reaching a distant castle by nightfall. She leaves the mule in the nearby village and takes shelter with a shepherd. A week goes by, and Mariquilla reads on the newspaper a castle is looking for a new squire to look after the horses. The girl disguises herself as a youth named Noé, takes on the job at the castle and brings the mule with her.\nThe prince falls for Noé, and suspects the squire is a woman. His mother, the queen, dismisses her son's ideas, but suggests they test his gender: first, invite Noé to dine with them, and, if he is a woman, she will eat many olives. Noé/Mariquilla's mule advises her to eat a single olive, in order to preserve her disguise. It happens thus. The next time, the queen suggests Noé takes a bath with the other servants. This time, the mule advises her to take the mule with her and let it loose to create a distraction; the other servants will try to rein it in, and Mariquilla can take her bath.\nThe mule's stratagem works twice. The third time, the queen suggests the prince, Juanillo, invites him as a sleeping companion; if Noé refuses, he is a woman. This time, the mule advises Mariquilla to reveal herself to the queen and explains the whole story. Mariquilla/Noé meets the queen and explains everything, and the queen marries her to prince Juanillo.\nIn time, the prince goes to war and leaves his pregnant wife at home. Mariquilla bears twins, a boy and a girl, and the queen sends a messenger to deliver a letter to the prince at the battlefield. However, the messenger meets on the way the silver-bearded suitor, who materialized a store. The messenger stays the night, and the silver-bearded suitor falsified the letter with a false information Mariquilla bore two puppies.\nThe messenger delivers the false letter to the prince, who writes back to his mother to keep his wife at the palace. The messenger passes by the same store and the silver-bearded falsified the second letter with a command to expel Mariquilla and the children. The second false letter arrives, the queen reads it and Mariquilla decides to fulfill the false request. She takes the children, some belongings and the mule with her, and they depart.\nAt a meadow, the mule tells Mariquilla to light a fire with firewood and throw the animal into the fire to burn; after it burns to cinders, blow on the ashes, and a castle will appear to her, and soon her husband and father will be with her. Mariquilla refuses to do it at first, but the mule insists she does it. Thus, with the mule's sacrifice, a splendid castle appears to house her. A person or the Virgin appears to Mariquilla, to tell her no harm will befall her. \nLater, Mariquilla's husband and her father are each closing in on the castle, from different directions, and are welcomed by Mariquilla and her twins, whom they do not recognize. Her father sits with the girl on his lap and the boy on his father's lap. The girl points to her father, the prince, and says she prefers him, then bids her mother tells the group the same tale she tells the twins every night to lull them to sleep. Mariquilla has some reservations, since the two men are strangers, but relents and tells them the story of how everything transpired to her. Mariquilla's father drops dead on the spot, while the prince embraces her and his children. The family reunites, and makes their way back to the prince's palace.\n\n\n== Analysis ==\n\n\n=== Tale type ===\nSpanish scholars Julio Camarena and Maxime Chevalier, in their joint Spanish Folktale Index, classified the tale as a new Spanish tale type: 533A, \"Caballo mágico salva a la novia del diablo\" (\"The Magic Horse Saves the Devil's Bride\"). In this type, the heroine makes a vow to marry a suitor with a certain uncommon trait, which the Devil, in human disguise, fulfills, and tries to marry her; however, the heroine's talking horse advises her to run away, and both escape to another kingdom, where she takes on a male disguise; in the male disguise, she befriends a human prince and eventually marries him; later, the heroine is left alone at home when the demonic suitor returns and threatens her and her children, but the talking horse appears one more time to save her, defeating the Devil and creating a new home for her (a tower, a hut, or a castle).\nAccording to Basque researcher Koldo Biguri, Italian folklorist Sebastiano Lo Nigro located stories of the crossdressing heroine, her helpful horse and the flight from an unwanted monstruous suitor in Italy, Catalonia and Basque Country – which corresponds to Type C in Lo Nigro's study.\nIn a study about the European cycle of La Doncella Guerrera (\"The Warrior Maiden\"), French historian François Delpech identified a second form of the cycle, which he termed La fille qui a épousé le diable (English: \"The girl who married the devil\"). In this form, the crossdressing heroine is still put to the test of her gender, but she is helped by her faithful magic horse. Delpech also concluded that the heroine's horse is the one that rescues her from a terrible marriage with a supernatural being and sets her up with a beneficial human partner.\n\n\n=== Motifs ===\nAccording to Chilean folklorist Yolando Pino Saavedra, in some variants, the heroine is betrothed or already married to a gentleman (who is a devil in disguise), and escapes from him in a \"Magic Flight\" sequence. Despite the presence of the motif, these tales are not classified as type ATU 313, \"The Magic Flight\".\n\n\n=== Relation to other tale types ===\nIn an article in Enzyklopädie des Märchens, narrative researcher Ines Köhler-Zülch stated that this narrative (heroine and magic horse save themselves from demonic bridegroom) may also start as tale type AaTh 621, \"The Flea\": her father, the king, fattens a louse and uses its hide as a suitor's riddle; a demonic bridegroom guesses it right.\nItalian scholar Sebastian Lo Nigro, in his study, noted that the motif of the sequence of falsified letters harks back to tale type ATU 706, \"The Maiden Without Hands\".\n\n\n== Variants ==\n\n\n=== Spain ===\nIn her catalogue of Spanish sources, scholar Montserrat Amores reports few variants of Spanish type 533A, \"El Caballo Mágico salva a la novia del Diablo\" (English: \"The Magic Horse Saves the Devil's Bride\"), in Spain.\n\n\n==== Galicia ====\nGalician ethnographer Lois Carré Alvarellos published a tale collected from San Xián de Sergude, titled Iria e o Cabalo Boligán (\"Iria and the Horse Boligan\"). In this tale, a princess named Iria does not want to marry anyone. One day, a horse in the stables, named Boligan, calls for her and advises her to tell her father she wants to marry a man with perfect ivory teeth, hoping that such a man does not exist. However, a man with this exact trait, a rich and powerful Moor, appears in the kingdom and asks to marry her. The princess cries over her fate, but the horse counsels her to take the horse with her. Some days into their journey, something startles the Moor's mount and he falls to the ground, allowing Iria to flee on her mount. She rides to a distant hut and rests with an old woman, who, the next day, gives the princess a tuft of sheep wool and a stack of needles. Iria journeys on, when her fiancé, the Moor, rides just behind them. Boligan, the horse, tells the princess to throw behind her the old woman's objects to delay the pursuit: the wool creates a mist and the needles great boulders. The third time, she throws behind her a piece of silk, creating a lake to deter the Moor. At a safe distance, the horse advises her to buy male clothes, take on a male name, Payo, and to find work as a king's page. The second king suspects Payo is a girl underneath the disguise and tries to unmask her by setting tests: to catch an apple between her legs; and to stay by the king's bed at night. Her horse, Boligan, however, warns her against every attempt. Eventually, Iria reveals herself and marries the king. Time passes, and a Moor army is at the king's door; Iria's husband, the king, borrows Boligan and marches to battle, leaving her at the castle. Iria notices that her former fiancé, the Moor, is leading the army, and gives birth to twin boys \"like two suns\". Her mother-in-law writes her son a letter with the good news, but a series of forged missives force the king's mother to carry out false orders to kill her. Crying, Iria takes her sons and leaves the kingdom, hoping to reach her father's homeland. One morning, she wakes up and sees her loyal horse Boligan in front of her. The horse tells her the Moorish king will come after her, but Boligan will fight him to the death; in case he dies, Iria is to take whatever she finds in his mouth. Just as the horse predicted, the Moor comes to kill her, but Boligan kills him in a fierce battle, and perishes, his form reverting to a human shape. Iria mourns for her fallen friend, gets his tongue and tosses it on the floor; a stone tower appears to house her and her children, furnished with everything they need. Back to Iria's husband, he returns home and, learning of the changed letters, begins a journey in search of her. He meets a long-bearded old man, and both ride to the stone tower. Inside, Iria welcomes them and, after dinner, embraces the king as her husband and the old man as her father. The Galician tale was listed by Camarena and Chevalier as a variant of their new tale type 533A, and also as a Galician variant of the same tale type in the Catalogue of Galician Folktales.\nResearcher Marisa Rey-Henningsen collected a tale from a Galician source which she translated as The Countess's Daughter and The Talking Horse. In this tale, Floriña is the daughter of a rich woman who is a countess. Many men have courted her, but her mother does not want to surrender her to any man. Even a powerful Moorish king makes a bid for the girl's hand, and threatens to kill both mother and daughter if they do not agree to it. Floriña weeps, and walks a bit with her mother's horse, which begins to talk. It advises Floriña that she shall only marry a man with perfectly white teeth, white as the freshly fallen snow. The Moorish king says he is that man, and gets to marry Floriña. The horse laments that their initial plan failed, so it suggests the girl takes her mother's horse with her to her new home. On the journey to the Moorish king's house; the horse seizes the opportunity to bump into the moor and his horse, and gallops away with Floriña to a Christian king's land. In the Christian king's castle, Floriña trades her womanly clothes for a peasant's and a cap. She works as a page in the second king's castle, and the king suspects she is a woman, and not a man. The Christian king's mother advises him to test the page: ask him to show his hands (either their palms, if a man), throw him a bunch of kindlewood (he will catch it between his legs if a man), and finally to ask him to sleep with him in his bed. Floriña passes by the first two tests, and begins to undress herself to join the king in his bed, when they hear a commotion in the streets: the Moorish king comes back with an army in search of his wife. The Christian king tries to deter him, but the Moor kills him, and goes after Floriña. She escapes from the attack and calls out for her mother's horse, and the animal rides to her aid. They gallop together across a field of dead bodies, both Christians and Moors, and the animal advises her to take its tongue in the hour of dire need. The horse stops by the side of a bridge, the Moor king on the other side. The Moor changes into a sparrow hawk to fly over the water and reach Floriña, and the horse warns the girl to cut off its tongue. In a rapid movement, the girl grabs a knife, cuts off the horse's tongue and throws it on the ground: a solid tower springs up to protect her, while the horse fights the Moor. The Moor stabs the horse in the neck with his sword, and it falls to the ground. The horse changes into a human prince, and, in the confusion, takes the sword to kill the Moor. From inside the tower, Floriña sees the battle and climbs down the tower to help the man. She brings him inside the tower, dresses his wounds and restores him to full health. Despite him not talking at all, Floriña begins to fall in love with him, and, one day, kisses him: the tower disappears and the man regains his speech, telling the girl a wicked fairy cursed him to an equine shape. Floriña and the man journey back to her mother's land, where she learns her mother died of grief, but later she marries the man.\n\n\n==== Catalan-speaking areas ====\nMallorcan priest Antoni Maria Alcover i Sureda collected similar tale from a Mallorcan source in Son Carrió. In this tale, titled Na Dent d'or, a rich lady has a beautiful daughter with golden teeth, whom she will only marry to a person who also has golden teeth. The girl rejects many suitors for they do not have golden teeth, and utters aloud she would marry even the Devil if he had golden teeth. The Devil (Barrufet) turns into a twenty-year-old youth and approaches the girl. Na Dent d'Or is surprised to find one such as herself and decides to marry the stranger. The tale then explains Na Dent d'Or's mother left the girl a magic horse of supernatural provenance, which always advised her. However, Na Dent d'Or did not consult with the magic horse before her accepting the stranger's marriage proposal. The magic horse admonishes the girl for her brash decision, and reveals the stranger is Barrufet, who will drag her to Hell. Na Dent d'Or is stunned by this information and berates herself for her rushed marriage plans, but the horse advises her how the can escape: Barrufet with come with a full marriage cortège, which are actually devils in disguise, but Na Dent d'Or is to tell them she will ride on the horse; they will seize the opportunity to gallop as hard and fast as they can, without looking behind them. The next day, Barrufet appears with a splendid carriage to carry his bride, but Na Dent d'Or says she will ride the horse. The girl and the horse gallop away as fast as they can to flee from the demons, who chase after them in their true forms. Na Dent d'Or invokes the holy names of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, and the ground under the demonic pursuers opens up to swallow them, ending their threat for now. The duo reach a distant kingdom, and the horse advises Na Dent d'Or to buy a shepherd's garments and assume a male disguise. Na Dent d'Or does that and hires herself as a local king's new squire, to look after the stables. The new squire does a remarkable job the king and queen treat him like a son, but the prince suspects he is in fact a girl. The queen dismisses the notion, but gives suggestions on how to ascertain it: first, place a feathery pillow; if a girl, she will fluff the pillow; if male, he will simply lie on it. With the horse's help, Na Dent d'Or avoid being discovered. Next, the queen suggests they pass by the stores selling spinning implements and swords: if male, he will prefer the swords; if female, she will prefer the other. Again, the horse advises its mistress. Thirdly, they will sleep in the garden, with rabbits hidden near their beds; if female, she will complains about the animals; if male, he will pay no mind to the hounds. Lastly, the queen suspects there is a connection between the squire and the horse, and suggests the prince places a pearl necklace around a hound and let it loose after a rabbit, when the queen will say the horse is dead; if female, she will lament the fact; if male, he will simply join the prince in trying to capture the loose hound. The prince puts the queen's scheme in action: the squire joins the prince in capturing the loose hound and brings it to the palace, when the queen announces the horse died. Na Dent d'Or falls to the ground and laments the fact, thus proving she is woman, after all. Na Dent d'Or dismisses the male disguise and becomes a lady in the prince's court. The prince wants to marry her, and she consults with the horse. Both depart from the prince's castle to think the idea over, and the prince, despairing at her departure, goes after her. The horse and Na Dent d'Or transforms themselves to trick the prince: into a charcoal-maker and a coal furnace, then into a gardener and an orchard, and finally a church with bell tower and a priest. The prince is tricked by the transformations, but keeps chasing after her. At the last moment, the magic horse gallops in such a way a golden nail escapes from its hoof and hits the prince's tooth, replacing part of it with the nail's gold metal, thus making him one with \"golden tooth\". Na Dent d'Or ceases her flight and explains to the prince her mother wrote as her last will she was to marry a man with golden tooth such as herself, and now that the prince has a \"golden tooth\", they can be married. Thus they marry.\n\n\n=== Basque Country ===\nAuthor Wentworth Webster collected a Basque language tale named Zorria (\"The Flea\") from Saint-Jean-de-Luz, which was published by French linguist Julien Vinson with the title Le Pou (\"The Flea\"). In this tale, a king has three daughters. One day, his youngest daughter finds a flea in his hair. The king fattens the bug, kills it and uses its hide as part of a riddle for the princess's suitors. A gentleman wearing gold garments (the devil in disguise) guesses it right and is given the hand of the youngest princess, named Fifine, in marriage. Fifine goes to the stables and a white mare warns her that her suitor is the devil, and that, as parting gift, the princess must choose to take the mare with her. It happens so. On the road, the white mare trots the ground, and it commands the earth to swallow the devil for seven years. The mare's enchantment works, and Fifine is saved, but the animal advises her to dress in masculine clothes and go to another kingdom. In this new kingdom, Fifine and the white mare find shelter in a prince's castle. The prince tells his mother he had a dream their guest is a woman, and the queen advises him to test her: to make her choose guns and weapons at the market, to have her horse trample on a piece of linen, and to take a bath in the river. With the mare's help, Fifine passes the tests, but eventually reveals herself to the prince and marries him. The white mare gives Fifine a chirola, for her to use in extreme distress, and departs. Fifine and the prince live in relative peace and harmony for seven years, and she gives birth to a boy and a girl. One day, her husband has to go to war and leaves her with his mother. While he is away, the devil rises from the ground and meets Fifine and her children, and takes them to the forest. Fifine begs for him to grant her a last request, and she blows on the chirola. The white mare appears to her, stomps on the ground and the devil disappears for good. Fifine decides not to return to her mother-in-law's castle, so the mare gives her a magic cane for her to create a manor if she strikes the ground with it. Fifine's husband returns from war and, not seeing his family, looks for them in the forest. He finds the manor with Fifine and their children inside. Its mission accomplished, the white mare turns into a white dove and flies to Heaven. Webster presumed a French origin for the tale, due to the heroine's name (Fifine), and claimed that the tale was from \"Laurentine, Sister of Toutou\". The tale was also translated into English as Fifine and the White Mare and its second part, Fifine and the Prince, and both sourced from Gascony, France. Camarena and Chevalier cited Vison's tale in regards to their new Spanish tale type.\n\n\n=== Portugal ===\nPortuguese scholars Isabel Cárdigos and Paulo Jorge Correia locate a similar tale type in the Portuguese Folktale Catalogue, numbered 533A, Portuguese: Cavalo mágico salva noiva do Diabo, lit. 'Magic horse saves Bride from the Devil': the heroine marries a strange suitor, who turns out to be of evil nature; a horse takes her away in a magic flight to another kingdom, where she spends some time in male disguise; she reveals her identity and marries the prince; the prince goes to war; the heroine gives birth to her child and writes her husband a letter; the letters are falsified by the former suitor; the heroine escapes with her horse and the animal creates a new house for her and her child.\nPortuguese author Trindade Coelho published the tale O Conto da Infeliz Desgraçada (English: Tale from Alentejo of an Unfortunate Wretch) in his book Os Meus Amores. In this tale, an old king asks his fifteen-year-old daughter to find a husband. The princess hears a voice telling her to marry only a man with ivory teeth, and the king summons every man, until the ivory-toothed man comes to marry her. When she prepares to leave her castle to go with her husband, the princess (named Isabel) hears another voice coming from the stables. She goes to check it and finds a \"cardano\" horse with black mane that tells her to take the horse with her, lest something evil befalls her. It is agreed on, and Isabel rides the horse. After some 200 days journey, her husband disappears from view, and the horse advises her to ride to a small cottage. Isabel does and finds two straws and a piece of paper inside it that she takes with herself. The husband appears behind her, and the horse tells her to drop the objects behind her: the paper to create a mist, the first straw, filled with needles, to create a forest, and the second straw, filled with water, to create a river between them. After safely escaping from the ivory-toothed man, the horse advises Isabel to dress in male clothing, and to go to another court, where she will pass her off as a youth named José. The second king tries to buy \"José\"'s horse, but he refuses. Later, after suspecting the newcomer is truly a woman, he plots with an old lady how to unmask her: to have her choose sits at the dining table, and to join him in his bedchambers. José passes the first test, but reveals her true identity in the king' room and marries him. Some years later, the king has to go to war and borrows Isabel's horse, while she stays at the palace and gives birth to two sons. A king's messenger takes a letter and runs to the battlefield to deliver it, but spends the night at an inn, where the innkeeper writes a false letter. The king receives the false letter and writes another, that is also forged by the innkeeper, with a command to banish her from the palace. Isabel receives the sad news and, despite bemoaning her fate, leaves the palace with her sons and wanders around the world. Suddenly, her cardano horse appears to her, having fled from the battlefield, and alerts her that her first bridegroom is after her, but the horse will do battle against him; after the horse perishes, Isabel is to get whatever she finds inside his mouth. It happens so: the princess takes the horse's tongue, throws it on the ground and a tower appears to house her and her children. Back to the king, he returns from war, learns about the forged letters, and decides to look for his wife. He stops by the same inn, and meets an old man that is also looking for her. Both decide to look for Isabel together and find her tower. They are welcomed inside, and, after dining with Isabel and her sons, she introduces her children to her father and her husband.\n\n\n== See also ==\nThe Horse Lurja (Georgian folktale)\nHorse sacrifice\nCalumniated Wife\nThe Three Golden Children (folklore)\nVasilisa the Priest's Daughter\nIleana Simziana (Romanian folktale)\nThe Black Colt (Iranian folkale)\nThe Magician's Horse (Lithuanian folktale)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Capital 3 is a football league competition under Capital Football, the governing body for football in the Wellington region of New Zealand. It is the third tier of the league system within Capital Football, sitting below Capital Premier and Capital 2.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nCapital 3 is a regional league that provides an opportunity for clubs in the Wellington area to compete at a competitive level. The league consists of a number of teams, typically ranging from 10 to 14, which compete against each other over a designated season. The exact number of teams and format may vary from season to season based on the number of participating clubs.\nThe league operates on a promotion and relegation system, with teams having the opportunity to move up to Capital 2 or face relegation to lower divisions based on their performance throughout the season. Promotion and relegation provide an incentive for clubs to strive for success and maintain a high level of competitiveness.\n\n\n== Structure ==\nCapital 3 operates with a regular season format, also known as a double round robin, where each team plays against every other team in the league twice, once at home and once away. The team with the highest number of points at the end of the season is crowned the league champion. In the event of a tie on points, tiebreakers such as goal difference, goals scored, or head-to-head results may be used to determine the winner.\nPromotion and relegation between Capital 3 and other leagues within Capital Football are determined by the performance of the teams. The top-performing teams in Capital 3 may earn promotion to the higher-tier Capital 2 league, while the teams at the bottom of the table may face relegation to the lower-tier Capital 4 league.\n\n\n== Participation ==\nParticipation in Capital 3 is open to clubs registered with Capital Football. Clubs are required to meet certain criteria set by the governing body, including having appropriate facilities, qualified coaches, and adhering to the regulations and rules of the competition.\nClubs in Capital 3 may field teams comprising players of various age groups, genders, and skill levels. This diversity allows for a broad range of participation and encourages the development of football talent at different levels.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCapital Football\nNew Zealand Football Championship\nNew Zealand national football team\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Website",

        "content": "Henry Vanderford (December 23, 1811 – January 27, 1894) was an American politician and newspaperman from Maryland. He served as a member of the Maryland House of Delegates, representing Carroll County from 1874 to 1876, and served in the Maryland Senate from 1880 to 1884.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHenry Vanderford was born on December 23, 1811, in Hillsborough, Caroline County, Maryland, to Elizabeth (née Frampton) and William Vanderford. His father was of Queen Anne's County where the Vanderford family owned 1,000 acres (400 ha) of land. He studied at Hillsborough Academy and moved to Talbot County with his family and attended school there. In 1825, he entered the office of Thomas Perrin Smith of the Easton Star. He studied the printing business and later joined the Easton Whig.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1835, Vanderford purchased the Caroline Advocate in Denton. He continued publishing the paper until 1837, when he moved the business to Centreville and published the Centreville Sentinel in January 1838. In 1842, he sold the Centreville Sentinel and moved to Baltimore. In 1845, he published a weekly literary and educational paper called The Ray. In 1846, he published the Democratic papers Baltimore Daily News and the Weekly Statesman under the firm Adams, Vanderford & Brown. He was appointed by Governor William Grason as chief judge of the magistrate's court, but he declined each appointment. In 1840, he was appointed as deputy marshal for Queen Anne's County and acted as the census taker.\nIn February 1848, he bought the Cecil Democrat in Elkton from Thomas M. Coleman. The paper opposed succession, but also the Abraham Lincoln administration. He expanded the paper and quadrupled its circulation. He managed the paper for 17 years. In 1865, he sold the paper to Albert Constable and Frederick Stump. He retired to a farm on the Patuxent River in St. Mary's County for three years. In 1868, Vanderford founded the Middletown Transcript in Middletown, Delaware, and acted as publisher and printer. In 1870, he transferred the paper to his son Charles H. In November 1870, he moved to Westminster, Maryland, and became the principal editor of The Democratic Advocate alongside his son William H. He remained in that role until 1880.\nVanderford was a Democrat. He was active in the reform movement in 1836. He served as a member of the Maryland House of Delegates, representing Carroll County from 1874 to 1876. He also served in the Maryland Senate, representing Carroll County from 1880 to 1884. He was chairman of the committee on finance and a member of the committee on engrossed bills and the committee on printing.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nVanderford married Angelina Vanderford, daughter of Henry Vanderford of Queen Anne's County and a distant relative, on June 6, 1839. They had twelve children, including William H., Charles H. and Julian J. His wife died in 1889. He was a Mason. He was a vestryman and member of the Ascension Protestant Episcopal Church.\nVanderford died on January 27, 1894, at his home in Westminster. He was buried at the Ascension Protestant Episcopal Church in Westminster.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "St Paulinus' Church is a former Catholic church in Brough with St Giles, a village in North Yorkshire in England.\nA Catholic chapel associated with Brough Hall was constructed in 1758.  The church was commissioned by William Lawson, and constructed in 1837 to a design by Ignatius Bonomi.  It was grade II* listed in 1987.  In 1992, the church and adjoining presbytery and schoolroom were purchased by the art collector Greville Worthington, who converted it into holiday accommodation.\nThe church and attached buildings built of sandstone and have Welsh slate roofs.  The church has two storeys and five bays, with schoolrooms in the ground floor and the church above, which has a nave and a chancel in one unit, and a north vestry.  The presbytery has two storeys, three bays, and a double depth plan. The central doorway has a fanlight, the windows are sashes, and there is a coped parapet.  At the rear is a walled yard with stables and other outbuildings.\nInside the church, there is a grand altar based on the tomb of Walter de Gray at York Minster, and below it, a sarcophagus transferred from the catacombs of Rome, said to contain the remains of Saint Innocent.  The reredos was designed by George Walker Milburn and installed in 1887.  The east window has stained glass by Thomas Willement, a copy of the Five Sisters window at York Minster.  The south windows have glass by William Wailes from the 1850s, and the north west window glass by H. M. Barnett, installed in 1880.  There is also an 11th-century font.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGrade II* listed buildings in North Yorkshire\nListed buildings in Brough with St Giles\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Rescue Mission Syracuse is a private 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization established in 1887, based in Syracuse, New York. The mission statement for Rescue Mission is to \"put love into action through shelter, food, clothing, and hope.\" It provides food services, emergency shelter, housing, permanent care, clothing centers, mobile outreach services, employment and educational resources, and connections to other services. It is currently located at 155 Gifford St in Syracuse, NY.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the early part of 1887, a lot of Christians in Syracuse were impacted by a wish to make some contributions to the cause of Christianity in the Syracuse community. The author of this article H. B. Gibbud who is a member of the Florence Night Mission of New York City was then invited to come to Syracuse for consultation on the matter. In June 1887, H. B. Gibbud arrived in Syracuse with his wife. After a careful study of the situation of Syracuse, H. B. Gibbud claimed that \"the thing to do is create a place in the very midst of the district where information was most needed, a place to which the people would be constrained to come and in which they would be met by sympathetic hearts.\" This advice was acted upon. They select the place on East Railroad Street, No. 340, near Mulberry. Around it, there are drinking saloons, gambling dens, and houses of ill-fame within a stone's in every direction. On September 4, 1887, in this place, Rescue Mission Syracuse was established, and it began its work among the non-church-going masses. The name of it comes from the event \"Jerry Rescue\". H. B. Gibbud was placed in charge as superintendent, and Mr. John E. Hendscy was their assistant.\nA prominent businessman of the city called H. B. Andrews purchased the building and site at 115 Mulberry Street near the Railroad. He altered, enlarged, and repaired the building and grounds and leased them to the Mission for a merely nominal rental, and on May 1, 1890, the Mission took possession of its new place.\nIn 1959, Clarence Jordan came to Syracuse from Goodwill in Bridgeport, Conn. He worked as manager of the Rescue Mission's small lodging house. In less than a year, Jordan was running the mission. Then, the organization had seven employees, one building, and a budget of $65,000. He has worked in Rescue Mission for 38 years.\nIn 2012, a Central New Yorker introduced Alan Thornton to the mission. Alan Thornton is a graduate of Pennsylvania's Messiah College. He soon becomes an executive director and CEO of the Rescue Mission in Syracuse. On November 17, 2017, Alan Thornton resigned from the mission to prepare for his role as president and CEO of St. John's Community Services in Washington, D.C. After that, Dan Sieburg became the new chief executive officer of the Rescue Mission Alliance. He is a social worker who has been with the Syracuse Mission for 10 years, mostly in program oversight jobs, on projects all over Central New York.\n\n\n== Services ==\n\n\n=== Food Services ===\nClarence L. Jordan Food Service and Culinary Education Center was opened in 2019, located at 148 Gifford Street, Syracuse NY, and named for previous Rescue Mission director and board member Clarence L. Jordan who passed away in 2018. The food center is dedicated to serving hot breakfast, lunch, and dinner every single day in Syracuse to anyone in need. Every day will provide over 700 meals to the public.\nDaily Meal Serves Time\n\nBreakfast: 7 a.m. to 8 a.m\nLunch: 11 a.m. to 12 p.m\nDinner: 4 p.m. to 5 p.m\nClarence L. Jordan Food Service and Culinary Education Center not only serves hot meals but also have state-of-the-art kitchen hosts cooking classes and teaches kitchen training skills for people who are looking for work in the food service industry. According to Spectrum News, the center also \"has an electric fireplace and a family dining room\" provided to people.\n\n\n=== Day Center and Emergency Shelter ===\nBoth Alice C. Barber Day Center and Kiesewetter Emergency Shelter cater specifically to the needs of individuals facing crises, offering them a haven and a range of essential amenities. Within these facilities, people are provided with secure dormitories ensuring their safety and comfort during times of distress. In addition, they also offer support for employment, education, and healthcare services.\n\n\n==== Alice C. Barber Day Center ====\nAlice C. Barber Day Center is located at 122 Dickerson Street, Syracuse NY; open daily from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. to the shelter residents only, not open to the public. The day center is the entry point to reach out to the services of Rescue Mission Syracuse, public bathrooms with a shower, meals, clothing, shelter, and HIS Van (Homeless Intervention Services Van) are provided. HIS Van is used to transport homeless individuals to medical, legal, and employment appointments if needed.\nInside the day center is an employment and education resource spot, to help clients get help with obtaining work and housing. Clients can also engage in the \"Willing to Work\" program to get unpaid job experience.\n\n\n==== Kiesewetter Emergency Shelter ====\nKiesewetter Emergency Shelter is the largest emergency shelter around Syracuse and Onondaga County, with 192 beds and 8 dormitories, containing two dormitories exclusively for females. According to CNY's Healthcare, in 2017, the emergency shelter provided \"more than 90,000 overnight stays.\"\n\n\n=== Street Outreach – Rescue Mission Homeless Intervention Services (HIS) ===\nAccording to Paul Driscoll, commissioner of the Syracuse Department of Neighborhood and Business Development, \"In Syracuse, there are typically 20 to 25 unsheltered homeless people during the summer and about five during the winter.\" Rescue Mission Homeless Intervention Services (HIS) Team is the only full-time mobile service that reaches out and keeps homeless individuals in the Syracuse area safe year-round. The outreach team will attempt to build trust and transport homeless individuals to the shelter. If individuals are not willing to get inside the shelter and choose to live outdoors, workers will provide hot meals, drinks, clothing, blankets, and other necessities to support them.\n\n\n=== Long-term, Permanent Care – Crossroads Adult Home ===\nCrossroads Adult Home is a congregate-care Level 3 facility located at 120 Gifford Street, Syracuse NY, which provides both long-term and transitional housing for males aged 25 and above with mental, physical, or developmental disabilities. The facility supports a total of 59-bed residences and provides assisted living services such as 24-hour supervision, basic care needs, medication management, and three meals and two snacks a day with special diet accommodations if there are medical concerns.\nThe monthly fee for living in Crossroads Adult Home is an average of $1,261 cost per month.\n\n\n=== Community Clothing Center ===\nThe Community Clothing Center reopened in 2022, following a two-year shutdown during the peak of the epidemic. The Community Clothing Center is now located at 200 Gifford Street and with open hour from Mondays through Fridays from 10 a.m. to 5:30 pm. The center provides people with free clothing, hygiene items, and other necessities. Every month, people can get up to five free clothing items including women's, men's, and children's clothing, and shoes through the center. The center also cooperates with the CNY Diaper Bank for the distribution station, providing free diapers for people who needed.\n\n\n== Local Contributions ==\n\n\n=== LGBTQ Youth Homelessness ===\nIn 2014, When Dan Sieburg attended a conference about homelessness, he was surprised about the disproportionate number of homeless youth in the U.S. who identify as LGBTQ. He realizes that the local Rescue Mission doesn't have shelters that are specifically addressing LGBTQ youth homelessness. After that, Sieburg reached out to ACR Health, a fellow Syracuse nonprofit that provides support services for people with chronic illnesses, including HIV/AIDS, and operates the Q Center, a supportive space for LGBTQ youth where they and their families can gather, build community, and receive health and other support services. After years of conversations, Rescue Mission Syracuse and ACR Health plan to raise funds to open an emergency 10-bed shelter for runaway and homeless LGBTQ youth, ages 12 to 17 in 2019, providing them with access to Q Center programs, including family support groups, tutoring, and case management, among other services.\n\n\n== Programs ==\n\n\n=== Rescue Mission Donation Centers in Wegmans ===\nThe privately held American supermarket, Wegmans, hosted Rescue Mission donation centers in their parking lot for decades. In 2023, Wegmans decided to terminate its partnership with Rescue Mission. Donation Centers in Liverpool/John Glenn, East Syracuse, and Clay/ Great Northern have been closed and are expected to close three more in 2024 including Cicero/ Route 11, DeWitt, and Liverpool/ Taft Road locations.\n\n\n=== Thrifty Shopper ===\nThrifty Shopper is a retail store owned and operated by Rescue Mission Alliance Syracuse, that offers affordable clothing, household products, and furniture to customers. All revenue from Thrifty Shopper store sales will provide food, shelter, and clothing to people who needed.\nEvery Thrifty Shopper accepts clothing in any condition, as well as shoes, accessories, linens, books, and electronics & small appliances. The stores do not accept mattresses, bed pillows, cribs, sleep sofas, car seats, high chairs, and tires. The donations might be sold at either Thrifty Shopper or 3fifteen store. Alternatively, it might be donated to one of the agencies' clients or be recycled.\nRescue Mission Syracuse now has 19 Thrifty Shoppers and two 3fifteen stores around the Upstate New York area.\nThrifty Shopper Open Hours (For all locations)\n\nWeekdays: 10 a.m. to 8 p.m\nSaturday: 9 a.m. to 9 p.m\nSunday: 11 a.m. to 6 p.m\n\n\n== Finances ==\nMission Rescue Alliance's financial reports show a good pattern of financial management and transparency. Key financial data such as revenues, expenses, net income, and net assets highlight the organization's ability to sustain services and increase resources over time. The majority of their revenue comes from donations (28.9%) and net inventory sales (65%), which together make up a significant portion of total revenue. These revenues are used to support a variety of expenditures, a significant portion of which is used to pay salaries and wages(47.7%) to ensure the delivery of programs and services. As revenues increase each year, so do expenditures.\n\n\n== See also ==\n501(c)(3) organization\nHomelessness among LGBT youth in the United States\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "This is a list of disparaging nicknames for settlements in the United States, including states, cities, towns, universities and schools. These pejorative nicknames may be coined for a variety of reasons. Some may be a straightforward desire to slander or disparage the city, while others may be examples of self-deprecating humor. While residents of the cities may see such nicknames as offensive, they may also be reclaimed as positive, even affectionate terms. Still other nicknames may simultaneously serve to attack the city from the outside and as a point of pride for its residents, especially those criticizing local politics.\nEtymology of these terms varies. Some are simple portmanteaus of the city name and profanity; others may reference a specific aspect of the city, such as an unfortunate incident in its past.\n\n\n== States, territories and federal districts ==\nCalifornia: Land of fruits and nuts\nIllinois: Illnoise, Suburban Chicago, Land'o'Lincoln (considered disparaging in the pre-Civil Rights South)\nLouisiana: Loserana\nMassachusetts: Taxachusetts\nMichigan: That State Up North\nMissouri: Misery\nTexas: Texass, The Big Tumbleweed, South of Sane, Land of the Giant Spiders\nWashington, DC: Hollywood for Ugly People, Murder Capital of America\n\n\n== Cities and towns ==\n\n\n=== Alabama ===\nBirmingham: The Tragic City\n\n\n=== Alaska ===\nAnchorage: Los Anchorage\nFairbanks: Squarebanks\n\n\n=== California ===\nBerkeley: Berzerkeley, The People's Republic of Berkeley, Twerkeley\nDavis: People's Republic of Davis\nLos Angeles: La-La Land\nPalo Alto: Shallow Alto\nRedwood City: Deadwood City\nSacramento: Suckramento\nSan Francisco: San Franpsycho, San Franshitsco\nSanta Monica: People's Republic of Santa Monica\n\n\n=== Colorado ===\nBoulder: The People's Republic of Boulder\nLafayette: Laugh at It\n\n\n=== Illinois ===\nChicago: Beirut by the Lake, Chiberia, Chi-raq, Second City, Shitcago\n\n\n=== Indiana ===\nIndianapolis: India-no-place\n\n\n=== Kansas ===\nDodge City: The Wickedest Little City in America\n\n\n=== Louisiana ===\nNew Orleans: The Big Sleazy\n\n\n=== Maryland ===\nBaltimore: \"Bodymore, Murderland\", The City That Bleeds, Harm City, Mob Town\nTakoma Park: The People's Republic of Takoma Park\n\n\n=== Massachusetts ===\nCambridge: The People's Republic of Cambridge\nSomerville: Slummerville\nWorcester: Wormtown\n\n\n=== Nevada ===\nLas Vegas: Lost Wages\n\n\n=== New Hampshire ===\nConcord: The City in a Coma\n\n\n=== New Jersey ===\nAsbury Park: The Dark City\nDumont: The Dirty D\n\n\n=== New Mexico ===\nGallup: Drunk Driving Capital of America\n\n\n=== New York ===\nAlbany: Smallbany\nAmsterdam: Amsterico\nAuburn: The Prison City\nNew York City: Hymietown, The Modern Gomorrah, New York Shitty\nStaten Island: The Forgotten Borough\nRochester: Rottenchester\nUtica: The City That God Forgot\nYonkers: Junkers\n\n\n=== North Carolina ===\nFayetteville: Torture Town\nGreensboro: Greensboring\n\n\n=== North Dakota ===\nMinot: Mindrot\n\n\n=== Ohio ===\nCincinnati: Cincinasty\nCleveland: The Sleepy City, The Mistake on the Lake\nDayton: Little Detroit\nYoungstown: Murdertown\n\n\n=== Oregon ===\nAstoria, Oregon: ASS-toria\nPortland: Little Beirut\nPortland, Oregon : Porn-land\n\n\n=== Pennsylvania ===\nPhiladelphia: Filthadelphia, Filthydelphia, or Killadelphia\nPittsburgh: Shittsburgh\n\n\n=== Texas ===\nDallas: Dallass, South Oklahoma\nEl Paso: Hell Paso\nHouston: Baghdad on the Bayou\n\n\n=== Utah ===\nSalt Lake City: Smog Lake City\n\n\n=== Vermont ===\nBurlington: The People's Republic of Burlington\n\n\n=== Washington ===\nAberdeen: Port of Missing Men\nTacoma: Tackyoma\n\n\n=== Wisconsin ===\nKenosha: Kenowhere\nRacine: Ratzine\n\n\n== Universities ==\nFlorida Atlantic University: Find Another University\nIllinois State University: I Screwed Up\nIndiana University Bloomington: Loosiers\nKent State University: Kent Read, Kent Write\nPurdue University: Purdon't, Turdue\nUniversity of California, Irvine: University of Chinese Immigrants\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles: University of Caucasians Lost Among Asians\nUniversity of California, San Diego: UC Socially Dead\nUniversity of Massachusetts Amherst: ZooMass\nUniversity of Michigan: That Team Up North (TTUN)\nUniversity of North Florida: University of No Football\nUniversity of Oklahoma: Chokelahoma, Jokelahoma, Mobilehoma\nUniversity of Southern California: University of Spoiled Children, University of South Central\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

In 1980, it won the Grand prix littéraire d'Afrique noire.\nIt was originally published in Dakar by Nouvelles Éditions africaines. It was republished in France in 2001 by Le Serpent à plumes.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe novel describes the revolt of beggars against a politician who expels them from the city, and the consequences of their begging strike in a society where alms are a matter of both religious and social obligation.\nBeggars, cripples, lepers, and children left to their own devices, the poorest, are in the habit of begging with their bowl in the busiest places in the city. They station themselves near mosques, crossroads, pedestrian crossings where residents, practicing Islam or having to make sacrifices to obtain a favor, give them alms. The authorities, concerned about the country's image with tourists, expel  this poor population far from the city. In reaction, they unanimously decided to strike and refuse alms from anyone.\nThe director of the sanitation service of the city of Dakar, who wants to become vice-president, is ordered by the marabout to give portions of sheep to the poor as a sacrifice. The distancing of the poor, which he himself organized, and their refusal of the slightest alms will turn against him  .\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nFall, Aminata Sow (2009-10-21). \"La Grève des bàttu\".

        "content": "The Legacy of Molly Southbourne is a 2022 horror novella by Tade Thompson. It is a sequel to 2019's The Survival of Molly Southbourne. The novel received a special citation at the 2023 Philip K. Dick Awards.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nA feral molly kills several civilians. A British agent named Gove assigns a woman named Myke to track down the molly and kill it. Tamara meets Vitali. He offers to pay her to retrieve a molly and help smuggle it out of the UK.\nMolly is living in Dorset under the name Molly Whitlow. She and her “sisters” Mollyann, Moya, and Molina undergo intensive therapy, but still struggle with their memories of violence, torture, and fire damage.\nMyke breaks into a morgue full of dead mollies and tamaras. She burns the building to the ground, stealing some molly spleens in the process. She learns that there are at least two feral mollies. She kills them, revealing that she is Mykhaila Southbourne, mother of the original Molly. Myke contacts Vitali, who plans to use the molly spleens to repair a global fertility crisis. In a flashback, Mykhaila is revealed to be a British defector to the USSR. Secret operatives including Vitali injected her with a mysterious substance, allowing her to make duplicates. Disappointingly, the duplicates were all violent. Mykhaila returned to the UK, where she met her husband Connor and gave birth to Molly. After Connor was killed by a molly, Mykhaila used one of her own duplicates to fake her death. Mykhaila now wishes to kill all the remaining mollies as revenge for the death of Connor and her original daughter.\nMolly and her sisters are attacked by a feral molly. They catch it and tie it up, hoping that it will eventually stop being violent and that they can integrate it into their family. They name this molly Kathy. Tamara approaches the house where Molly lives. She offers to double-cross Vitali. Molly is attacked by several feral mollies. Myke arrives. She kills Molina before Molly kills her. \nA year later, Vitali has been arrested and the stolen genetic material has been recovered. Scientists have been able to perfect the duplication process. Molly declines an offer to work for Gove and wonders if she should write a book about her experiences.\n\n\n== Reception and awards ==\nKristi Chadwick of Library Journal gave the novella a starred review, praised the characterization of Molly's clones as well as the plot, writing that \"themes of redemption and found family sliding the last puzzle pieces into place in this exciting and haunting series.\" Publishers Weekly wrote that \"the novel’s alternating perspectives can be disorienting\" but \"the action scenes are hard-hitting and adrenaline-stimulating, and serve as the most powerful and immersive parts of the novel.\"\nThe Legacy of Molly Southbourne received a special citation at the 2023 Philip K. Dick Awards.\n\n\n== References ==",

The military branch sought to grow its operational capacity while rationalizing it.\nIn 1968 the command established its headquarters in the Cóndor Building, Buenos Aires.\n\n\n=== Operations ===\n\n\n==== State terrorism ====\nFor the repression of the opponents, the Air Operations Command established the Internal Framework Group Command (CAMI) in order to lead the groups that operated in the provinces where there were Air Force units.\n\n\n==== Malvinas War ====\nThe Air Operations Command led by Brigadier Major Hellmuth Weber prepared a contingency plan in January 1982 in case Argentina had war with the United Kingdom after Operation Rosario ordered by the Military Junta. This plan, called \"Plan Blue and White\", was ready on March 25, 1982. Weber managed to obtain permission from the dictator Leopoldo Fortunato Galtieri to deploy the Argentine Air Force to Patagonian airports. The COA established the Strategic Air Command.\nOn January 1, 2011, the Air Operations Command acquired the name \"Air Force Training and Readiness Command.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Paul Pilnick (17 January 1941 – 17 September 2021) was an English guitarist. During the 1960s/1970s, he played with Lee Curtis and the All-Stars, The Big Three, and Stealers Wheel.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1963, Paul joined Lee Curtis and the All-Stars. He played with them for a year before going to The Big Three. This tenure was short, and the same year he left to join Tony Jackson and the Vibrations, formed by former Searchers bassist Tony Jackson. In 1972, Pilnick was invited into the band Stealers Wheel. The band had an international hit song in 1973 with Stuck in the Middle with You, to which Pilnick is credited as \"lead guitarist\" on the track. \"Stuck in the Middle with You\" reached No. 6 in the US Billboard Hot 100 and No. 8 in the UK Singles Chart in 1973, selling over one million copies worldwide, and was awarded a gold disc. Also in 1973, Pilnick, Tony Williams (bass player) and Rod Coombes (drummer) left the band, and for the remaining three years, members Joe Egan and Gerry Rafferty continued as a duo, with the support of session musicians in the studio.\nIn 1974, Paul joined rock band Badger, formed by Tony Kaye after he left Yes. He is credited with playing on the album \"White Lady\". After Badger, Pilnick co-founded the new wave group Deaf School, as both a guitarist and a producer. Pilnick won a Melody Maker talent contest, that got them a contract at Warner Records. He also played banjo and accordion in the band. Pilnick was still involved with Deaf School up until his death. Pilnick played guitar on Egan's debut solo album \"Out of Nowhere\" (1979), and produced his second album \"Map\" (1981).\nAfter being contacted by iTunes and K-tel in California, Tony Williams briefly re-formed Stealers Wheel in Blackpool in 2008 with Rod Coombes and Paul Pilnick, together with close friend Tony Mitchell. On 10 November 2008, they started filming a music video for a re-recording of \"Stuck in the Middle\" on the Fylde coast. They also began writing new songs although they had no plans to tour, and disbanded again.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nPaul Pilnick was born in Liverpool in 1941 (although different sources claim he was born in 1944), and began playing guitar at an early age. Pilnick was identified in the audience of a picture of The Quarrymen (later The Beatles) performing on Rosebury street in 1958 or 1959. Pilnick was a humanitarian.\nPilnick died at the Northern General Hospital in Sheffield on 17 September 2021 after a short illness. He was 80. He was survived by his wife, two children, and two grandchildren. Deaf School posted on twitter:\n\nWe’re very sad to report the death of former band member Paul Pilnick. He was a great musician and friend. His contribution to our album 2nd Honeymoon was massive and he’ll be remembered, not least, for his iconic banjo intro on What A Way To End It All.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Secretary of Aeronautics was an entity dependent on the Presidency of the Argentine Nation of the Argentine Republic created on January 4, 1945 by the then de facto president General Edelmiro Julián Farrel in a general agreement of ministers. Its purpose was to bring together under the sole direction and administration of the government all the nation's air activity, until then dispersed in various dependencies. The Argentine Air Force (FAA) is created as an armed force independent of the Army.\nThe provision for the creation of the Secretariat of Aeronautics placed in charge a Secretary of Aeronautics with the category of Minister of State, while assigning him the leadership of all aviation activity organizations, both civil and military. Its first secretary was Brigadier General Bartolomé de la Colina.\nDuring the last months of the government of General Farrel and then, under the two successive governments of General Perón, the Secretariat of Aeronautics laid the foundations of Argentine air and commercial aerospace expansion by articulating policies for this purpose.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Swaffham Town Hall is a municipal building in London Street in Swaffham, a town in Norfolk, in England. The building, which now accommodates the Swaffham Museum and the offices of Swaffham Town Council, is a Grade II listed building.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe building was commissioned the brewer, John Morse, for use as his home. The site he selected was on the west side of London Street, adjacent to the White Hart Inn.\nThe building was designed in the neoclassical style, built in red brick and was completed in around 1810. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage of three bays facing onto London Street. The central areas of the bays were slightly projected forward, relative to the outer areas. The central bay featured a porch formed by a pair of Doric order columns and a pair of pilasters supporting an entablature with triglyphs and a cornice. The other bays on the ground floor were fenestrated by round-headed windows, while the first floor was fenestrated by sash windows with window sills and there were dormer windows at attic level. Internally, the principal room was the dining room with a pair of Doric order columns at the south end.\nIn 1894, the local urban sanitary district board was replaced by a new urban district council. The council was initially based at the Shirehall but, in the early 1950s, civic leaders decided that they needed a dedicated building for their offices and meeting place. In 1955, the building was purchased by Swaffham Urban District Council to use as a town hall, with the dining room being converted into a council chamber.\nIn the late 1950s, three PGM-17 Thor nuclear missiles were located near-by at RAF North Pickenham, giving rise to protests by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Considerable interest was generated in the British tabloid newspapers in December 1958, when the Russian news agency, TASS, telephoned the town hall to inquire about the protests: on this basis, the journalists concluded that the protests were communist-inspired. The building was grade II listed in 1973.\nThe building continued to serve as the offices of Swaffham Urban District Council for two decades, but ceased to be the local seat of government when Breckland District Council was formed in 1974. Since then, it has accommodated the offices and meeting place of Swaffham Town Council.\nWorks of art in the town hall include a landscape painting by Samuel John Carter, depicting horses drinking at a local farm.\n\n\n== The museum ==\nIn 1986, Swaffham Museum opened in the building.  It is an independent social history museum covering the town and surrounding villages. It has five galleries exhibiting local history and local geology as well as an Egyptology room about Howard Carter and the Ancient Egyptians, celebrating the centenary year of Howard Carter discovering the Tomb of Tutankhamun in 1922. There is also a display about the author, Captain W. E. Johns, who, after serving as a local sanitary inspector, created the fictional air-adventurer Biggles, and there are some items which belonged to Admiral of the Fleet Sir Arthur Wilson, 3rd Baronet, who served as First Sea Lord shortly before the First World War.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

As of 2022, the system provided 115,492 rides over 11,283 annual vehicle revenue hours with 9 buses and 4 paratransit vehicles.\n\n\n== History ==\nPublic transit in Eureka Springs began in 1891 when 10 mulecars began operating on city streets under the Eureka Springs Electric Light & Street Railway Co. In the late 1890s, the mulecars were replaced by electric streetcars, which would operate in the city until 1920.\nIt was not until 1978 that transit would return with replica trolleys. Six years later the city acquired land for the two transfer facilities. Beginning May 3, 2024, the city will extend service hours into the evenings on Fridays and Saturdays with an on-demand shuttle.\n\n\n== Service ==\nEureka Springs Transit operates three seasonal schedules based on demand. Only two routes operate in the winter while all four operate from March until November. All routes serve the Eureka Transit Center and Downtown Trolley Depot. Regular fares are $4.00.\nHours of operation for the system are Wednesday through Saturday from 10:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M. in the winter, Tuesday through Friday from 10:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M. and Saturday from 9:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M. in the spring and fall, and Sunday through Friday from 10:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M. and Saturday from 9:00 A.M. to 8:00 P.M. in the summer.\n\n\n=== Routes ===\nRed Route\nPurple Route\nYellow Route\nBlue Route\n\n\n== Fixed route ridership ==\nThe ridership statistics shown here are of fixed route services only and do not include demand response services.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of bus transit systems in the United States\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEureka Springs Transit",

        "content": "Pycnotrema is a small genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Graphidaceae. Its two species are characterised by their small, rounded apothecial (fruiting body) pores.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe genus was circumscribed by Eimy Rivas Plata and Robert Lücking in 2012, with Pycnotrema pycnoporellum assigned as the type species. The authors indicate that there are no well-defined characters that separate the genus from Ocellularia and Myriotrema (in the broad sense), but molecular analysis shows the lineage is distinct. This lichen was originally described by William Nylander in 1876 as a species of Thelotrema. A second species, P. fissurinum, was added to the genus in 2015. It is found in Puerto Rico. The genus name is derived from the epithet of the type species, pycnoporellum, combined with the suffix -trema. Pycnotrema is in the subfamily Fissurinoideae of the family Graphidaceae.\n\n\n== Description ==\nPycnotrema is characterised by a thallus that is light grey-green and varies from smooth to uneven in texture. It features a dense, prosoplectenchymatous cortex—a compact, tissue-like layer of fungal cells that protects the photobiont layer beneath, where the photosynthesizing algae reside. This layer, along with the medulla—the innermost layer of the lichen—contains clusters of calcium oxalate crystals. The apothecia (fruiting bodies) of Pycnotrema are typically immersed within the thallus and rounded, often aligning in lines across the surface. These structures feature a disc that is usually covered by a narrow, reddish-coloured pore and surrounded by an entire, brown-black margin. Unlike some other lichens, Pycnotrema does not develop a columella, which is a central support structure found in some fungal fruits.\nThe wall surrounding the apothecial disc, known as the excipulum, is also prosoplectenchymatous and brown in colour, and lacks periphysoids—filamentous structures that can protrude from the margins of some lichens. The paraphyses (sterile filaments that fill the apothecium) are unbranched. The spores of Pycnotrema are produced eight per ascus (spore-bearing structure) and are submuriform—divided by multiple cross walls—ellipsoid in shape, and feature thick walls that divide the internal space into rounded compartments. These spores are colourless and turn violet-blue when treated with iodine, indicating the presence of amyloid compounds. In terms of chemistry, Pycnotrema does not produce any secondary metabolites.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Since 2023, after the Botafogo team failed to maintain its lead and saw Palmeiras overtake them in the Campeonato Brasileiro in the last rounds, John Textor has made numerous accusations in the press that the championship has suffered from manipulation of results and refereeing errors, for which his team would have been harmed; To give greater veracity to his statements, Textor ended up hiring a French company, specialized in game analysis and arbitration to verify the matches. In the complaints, he also accused football referees of  receiving agreed bribes. However, such accusations were not presented to the competent bodies. The businessman also accused Fortaleza, Palmeiras and São Paulo, without presenting evidence, of colluding to harm Botafogo. Textor was then denounced by the Superior Tribunal de Justiça Desportiva for bad faith litigation and false accusation of crime, and the trial was scheduled for April 15, 2024. Textor had been given a deadline to deliver the alleged allegations to the magistrates, however, he did not comply with them. Hours after the STJD's decision, Textor handed over the alleged evidence to the Cidade da Polícia located in Benfica in Rio de Janeiro because according to the businessman, the sports tribunal did not have the competence to investigate this lawsuit. However, senators who were members of the CPI on Manipulation of Results, which took place in 2023, asked the Brazilian police to interrogate him and present such evidence.\nOn April 22, 2024, Textor stated during the CPI do Senado meeting that \"Manipulation of results in football is reality\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nGolden Whistle: Portuguese football corruption scandal\n2005 Brazilian football match-fixing scandal\nCalciopoli\n2023 Brazilian football match-fixing scandal\n\n\n== References ==",

But the leader of the opposition, Martial, is a dead man who refuses to succumb to the assassination attempts, and who takes refuge in the body of his daughter, Chaïdana, leading to conflict.\nIt is a visionary fable which,  satirizes the politics based on torture, murder and the cult of personality.  The text is also full of parody, like Rabelais Gargantua    Thus, despite the hell and the horrors that it describes, the book is also carried by hope and strength.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nTansi, S.L.

        "content": "Francis de Noyelle was a French diplomat, born on December 9, 1919, in Paris, where he died on March 30, 2017. He was French ambassador to Nepal between 1980 and 1984.\nDuring the Second World War, after spending two years in the office of the Prefect of Hérault, Francis de Noyelle played an important role in the French Resistance, particularly in Isère and Paris. A member of the Goélette network, his mission was to recruit partisans and find addresses to store all the documents stolen from the Nazis during the Occupation. He received several distinctions for his acts of resistance.\nAfter the war, he embarked on a 40-year diplomatic career. As a secretary at the New Delhi embassy, he was a member of the famous 1950 French expedition led by Maurice Herzog, which conquered the Annapurna. Thereafter, Francis de Noyelle alternated between posts in the central administration of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and positions in the French embassies in Czechoslovakia, Morocco, Canada and, finally, Nepal.\nAfter being awarded the Légion d'honneur and the Ordre national du Mérite, he was, at the time of his death in 2017, the last survivor of his Himalayan expedition.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Youth and the Resistance (1919-1945) ===\n\nFrancis Deloche de Noyelle, born on December 9, 1919, in the 16th arrondissement of Paris, is the son of diplomats: André Deloche de Noyelle, Minister Plenipotentiary, and Jeanne née de Geer. He grew up at rue de Traktir, right next door to the Prunier restaurant. He studied at the Lycée Janson-de-Sailly, then at the faculties of literature and law in Paris, Poitiers, Montpellier and Grenoble.\nBetween 1941 and 1942, he was deputy chief of staff to the Prefect of Hérault. During the Second World War, he took part in the Resistance in Isère. From January 1943, while undercover as a student and scout from Grenoble, he ran a small network, Goélette (part of the Bureau central de renseignements et d'action), which extended as far as Valence. Under the orders of General de Gaulle, he was tasked with expanding the network. His mission also involved finding “depot ” addresses, where all the information obtained (photographs, plans, and stolen documents) could be stored before being sent to General de Gaulle's intelligence service in London. After recruiting members of the Jackson family (Phillip, Toquette, and Sumner), he set up a Resistance base in Paris at 11, avenue Fochd. After the liberation of Grenoble in August 1944, he became “liaison officer interpreter for the leading battalion commander of the liberating troops”.\n\n\n=== Diplomatic career and ascent of Annapurna (1945-1985) ===\nAfter the war, Francis de Noyelle worked for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as an administrator in the Asia-Oceania Division (1946–1948).\n\nThen second secretary at the New Delhi embassy since 19481, he spent three days scouting Nepal in 1949, with a view to a possible French expedition to the Himalayas. After negotiating with the Nepalese authorities to obtain the necessary authorizations, he took part, as liaison officer, in the 1950 expedition led by Maurice Herzog, who conquered Annapurna, the first of the world's 14 8,000-meter peaks. His mission was to facilitate the transfer of equipment, recruit Nepalese porters and obtain weather reports. He takes part in the ascent, but goes no further than the second camp, located at an altitude of 5,600 m. During the ascent, he was the only one to try out an oxygen mask, for medical purposes only. Alongside the expedition's cinematographer Marcel Ichac, Francis de Noyelle also shot Super 8 footage of the climb, recording almost 40 minutes of footage. On their return to France, Francis de Noyelle and his mountaineering companions were received at the Salle Pleyel (8th arrondissement of Paris) and then at the Élysée Palace to celebrate their feat; the President of the Republic Vincent Auriol, five ministers and all the personalities of sport and mountaineering were present.\n\nAfter the expedition, he joined the press department at headquarters devoted to American issues. Two years later, in 1952, he joined the Embassy in Czechoslovakia, where he was appointed Second, then First Secretary. In 1955, he was appointed Deputy Chief of Staff at the French General Residence in Morocco. He remained in Rabat until 1958 when he was appointed First Secretary of the Embassy. He returned to work at headquarters, more specifically in the section of the economic affairs department specializing in issues relating to the African continent. In 1966, he left for Ottawa, where he served as a Counselor at the French Embassy in Canada until 1969 when he joined the Mail and Pouch Service at headquarters. He was promoted to deputy director of this department in 1971. Francis de Noyelle was appointed Senior Defense Official in 1978. After writing an end-of-mission report for the Ministry, he was appointed Ambassador to Nepal on September 10, 1980, replacing François de Testa. His term of office in Nepal was due to expire on March 4, 1984, but he was replaced on February 15 by Lionel de Warren and retired the following year.\n\n\n=== Retirement and end of life (1985-2017) ===\nAfter his retirement, Francis de Noyelle worked for the French Red Cross for four years (1985–1989). At the same time, he was appointed assessor judge on the Refugee Appeals Board (1986–1998).\nIn 2000, he took part in the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the French ascent of Annapurna.\nThe last survivor of his Himalayan expedition, Francis de Noyelle died on March 30, 2017, at the age of 97. His funeral was held on April 3 at the Protestant Temple de l'Étoile (17th arrondissement of Paris).\n\n\n=== Private life and community involvement ===\nFrom an early age, Francis de Noyelle's passions were tennis and skiing, two sports he practiced until the end of his life - when he was 85 and 90 respectively.\nHis wife Odette-Juliette, born Petit-Delrieu on October 14, 1920, in Strasbourg (Bas-Rhin) and died on December 9, 2009, was also a diplomat. Together, they had three children: Luc, Guy and Marc. They lived in Paris and spent part of the year in their chalet in Saint-Nicolas-de-Véroce (Saint-Gervais-les-Bains, Haute-Savoie).\n\n\n=== Private life and community involvement ===\nFrom an early age, Francis de Noyelle's passions were tennis and skiing, two sports he practiced until the end of his life - when he was 85 and 90 respectively.\nHis wife Odette-Juliette, born Petit-Delrieu on October 14, 1920, in Strasbourg (Bas-Rhin) and died on December 9, 2009, was also a diplomat.

        "content": "The penal colony of Clevelândia, located in the current district of Clevelândia do Norte, Amapá, functioned from 1924 to 1926 in the extreme north of Brazil, bordering French Guiana. It was installed in the \"Cleveland Colonial Nucleus\", an agricultural colony founded in 1922, and received a total of prisoners that ranged from 946 to 1,630 individuals. The prisoners included enemies of president Artur Bernardes' government (tenentist rebels, militant workers and anarchists) and common prisoners (criminals from the \"scum of society\", poor peoples, capoeiras, and minors caught on the streets). They came from Paraná, São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Amazonas and Pará. In addition to these, the colony's population was made up of Brazilian Army guards, employees, traders and settlers, the last three totaled 204 inhabitants at the end of 1926. At the beginning of 1927, the Washington Luís administration allowed the prisoners to return.\nThe original agricultural colony was already losing its inhabitants to neighboring Martinica (present-day Oiapoque) in 1924, when the Bernardes government needed a remote and isolated prison. In response to the tenentist military revolts, the government had imposed a state of emergency and filled the prisons. Miguel Calmon, then Minister of Agriculture, offered the location, as it was the most remote agricultural colony in the country. The colony has precedents in the governments of Floriano Peixoto, who deported prisoners to the Amazon, and Rodrigues Alves, in the period after the Vaccine Revolt, as well as in other penal colonies around the world. The first ship with prisoners arrived at the mouth of the Oyapock River on 26 December 1924.\nThe sudden expansion of the colony's population overloaded its agricultural center's infrastructure. Testimonies from prisoners recorded precarious accommodation and usually unpaid work in hot, humid and unhealthy conditions, as well as threat of violence from guards and some common criminals. The prison's workforce carried wooden logs to the sawmill, weeded the fields, built public facilities and worked in the pau-rosa mills. Military personnel who swore loyalty to the government performed technical and bureaucratic functions. In June 1925, soldiers from the Public Force of São Paulo, defeated in the battle of Catanduvas during the Paraná Campaign, brought an epidemic of shigellosis, which killed hundreds of prisoners along with other diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis. According to the official report Journey to the Cleveland Colonial Nucleus, out of 946 prisoners, 491 died and 262 escaped.\nPress censorship suppressed the matter until the first months of 1927, when the prisoners returned and the penal colony occupied the front pages of newspapers. The government's opposition described Clevelândia as a \"green hell\", and government supporters as a \"very common agricultural colony\". Clevelândia was permanently associated with president Artur Bernardes. It was remembered by anarchists and forgotten by historiography, being the subject of the first major study only in 1991. Historians have characterized the penal colony as a forced labor camp or even as a concentration camp.\n\n\n== Creation ==\n\n\n=== The agricultural colony ===\n\nThe prisoners' memoirs often confuse Clevelândia with the region where it was located, Oiapoque, at the time belonging to the state of Pará and currently to Amapá. Oiapoque is located on Brazil's border with French Guiana and was an area of territorial disputes with France until its definitive incorporation into Brazilian territory in 1900. The region was considered an empty space, and its occupation had been studied by Brazilian authorities since the 1890s. In 1919, the Brazilian Congress approved senator Justo Chermont's proposal to found national patronages and colonies along the Oyapock River. Chermont warned the government against smugglers who took advantage of the lack of policing, inspection and military defense in that area. Colonization would eliminate French influence from the region and ensure Brazilian sovereignty.\nThe colony was established on the right bank of the Oyapock River, 15 kilometers from the military post of Santo Antônio, a few kilometers upstream from the village of Martinica. Both were part of the municipality of Amapá in the district of Demonti, whose total population was more than 1,150 in the 1920 census. The village of Saint-Georges was on the opposite (French) side of the river. The first settlers, refugees from the drought in Northeastern Brazil, arrived in May 1921. According to Rocque Pennafort, the population was made up of two distinct groups, one that accompanied colonel Chico Pennafort and the other of families from Ceará brought from Belém by the government. The region was believed to be an \"Eldorado\" of fertile lands, presented in government propaganda by photographs of giant cassava and sugar cane trees. The healthiness of the region was attested to by a report signed in 1922 by the director of the Rural Prophylaxis Service of Pará. On 5 May 1922, the \"Cleveland Agricultural Center\" was inaugurated, named after Grover Cleveland, president of the United States who served as arbitrator in the Palmas issue between Argentina and Brazil.\nThe chief engineer, administrator and founder of the village was Gentil Norberto. Clevelândia should be the \"model area for a civilizational project\". The urban area of the nucleus was planned, an unprecedented feat for the towns in the region. Until 1924, a two-story building was built for the administration, a school with two classrooms, a hospital, infirmary, immigrant hostel, telegraph office, sawmill, church, several residences and 28 kilometers of local roads. But the initial enthusiasm was lost and settlers who were unsuccessful with agriculture migrated to Martinica, where they found work in the pau-rosa mills. On 31 December 1926, the population, excluding prisoners and guards, was 204: 127 settlers and 77 employees and traders.\n\n\n=== Transformation into a penal colony ===\n\nThe federal government of president Artur Bernardes (1922–1926) transformed Clevelândia into the largest destination for its political prisoners, in a context of a lasting state of emergency, overcrowded jails, mass arrests and degredados. Tenentists, defeated in their armed revolts against the government, militant workers (including anarchists), common criminals and \"undesirables\" removed from the streets of Rio de Janeiro had Clevelândia as a prison from 1924 onwards. By article 80 of the General Provisions of the Brazilian Constitution of 1891, in force at the time, the president could, during a state of emergency, resort to exile to maintain law and order. In the case of Clevelândia, an additional justification would be a constitutional provision that gave the federal government control over the border strip necessary for national defense.\nAccording to Bernardes, the idea of deporting the prisoners to Clevelândia was not his, but that of his Minister of Agriculture, Miguel Calmon, or Gentil Norberto. According to former minister Calmon, \"the government only deported to Clevelândia as a last resort and forced by habeas corpus requests to the Supreme Federal Court, which did not allow the prisoners to be kept here\" [on prison ships and islands in Guanabara Bay] , and \"those deported to Clevelândia were prisoners who had the worst records and no special title to recommend them\".\nMiguel Calmon presented to the president establishments of the Ministry of Agriculture with room to receive prisoners: Ilha das Flores, the colonial centers of Paraná and Santa Catarina and the agricultural centers of Paraíba, Piauí, Pará (i.e. Clevelândia) and Amazonas. According to him, Ilha das Flores and Clevelândia would be the only viable ones, as the others were in territories at risk of revolts or the governors of their respective states did not want to host political prisoners.\nClevelândia was the most remote agricultural colony in the entire country, guaranteeing the isolation of prisoners and the impossibility of legal defense before courts. The prisoners would be punished for their crimes while also contributing to the occupation of the border region. The measure has precedents in republican Brazil, also in the equatorial jungle, when hundreds or even thousands of individuals were deported to Tabatinga, Xingu, the upper Rio Branco and Acre during the government of Floriano Peixoto and in the post-Vaccine Revolt. This type of punishment in inhospitable regions can be compared to Devil's Island in French Guiana, the Italian domicilio coatto (confinement on islands in the Mediterranean), the Argentine prison in Ushuaia and the Russian gulag. The isolation was so great that there was no direct telegraphic connection to Belém; Until the construction of a radiotelegraph station in September 1926, communication passed through French Guiana to Paris and from there to Recife and Belém.\n\n\n== Points of view ==\n\nThe events in Clevelândia did not reach the press as a whole, which was under censorship during the state of emergency declared by the Bernardes government. Public opinion only had a superficial understanding of the events. Opposition deputies in the Chamber denounced many abuses that occurred during the state of emergency, but did not mention Clevelândia. The newcomers did not know what awaited them. The news only started to come out in September 1925, when a letter from Domingos Braz was published in the Lisbon anarcho-syndicalist newspaper A Batalha. In December 1925, another letter was published by the newspapers La Antorcha, from Buenos Aires, and O Syndicalista, from the Workers' Federation of Rio Grande do Sul. The government denied the accusations.\nOnly at the end of Artur Bernardes' term and the state of emergency did the story resonate with public opinion and the big and small press brought testimonies from survivors. Government and opposition newspapers debated what the real conditions of the place would be at the beginning of 1927, when the prisoners had already been amnestied. The opposition can be exemplified by the newspapers O Combate and A Nação, which represented the interests of the Democratic Party of São Paulo, tenentists and the Workers and Peasants Bloc, as well as A Plebe, representing the anarchists. The defenders of former president Bernardes and his government can be found in the Rio de Janeiro newspaper O Paiz. Justo Chermont's newspaper reported on the beauty and good climate of Clevelândia, and Gentil Norberto would publicly defend the place.\nThe play Clevelândia (1927), by Euclides de Andrade, criticized the First Brazilian Republic in a humorous tone from the point of view of a caipira arrested in São Paulo for saluting the revolutionaries in 1924. The play was well received by the public in São Paulo. In Mr. Slang e o Brasil (1927), writer Monteiro Lobato interpreted Clevelândia as the possible destination of the country's thinking minds. Regarding the doctor Belisário Penna, Lobato wrote: \"He has done so much good for his land and will do so much more that - write what I'm going to say: he will end up in Clevelândia\".\n\nThe opposition denounced the \"horrors\" and the \"Clevelandian hecatomb\", \"the extermination of prisoners\" and \"the crimes of the Bernardes government\". The contemporary press and historiography associate Clevelândia with exile and demographic emptiness. Expressions such as \"green hell\", \"Brazilian Siberia\", \"garden of torments\", \"exile of plague and death\", \"pestilent jungles\" and \"inhospitable place\" were common in the newspapers. The place entered anarchist memory as a symbol of oppression, the \"Brazilian Bastille\".\nThe revelations put the government press on the defensive. In the article \"The demagoguery industry and the Clevelândia bonanza\", the newspaper criticized opposition publications. The newspaper softened the image of the place, calling it a \"very common agricultural colony\" and a \"peaceful cassava plantation\". Reversing the accusations, it asserted that \"those who today cry out with an olive branch in hand, for general peace, were the ones who lit and fueled the fire of rebellion that has been drenching the national territory in blood for so many years\", and that \"if there had not been a revolution the government would not have been forced to take some severe measures\".\nFor historian Carlo Romani, historiography let the history of Cleveland fall into oblivion. The official silence about the region was broken by the Brazilian Army Library itself with the publication of Clevelândia do Norte, by priest Rogério Alicino, in 1971. Alicino had an affinity with the interests of the State and relied on official documents. His book dedicated only five pages to the penal experience; according to Romani, \"the first extensive work on the episode was a chapter in Paulo Sérgio Pinheiro's book\", Estratégias da ilusão: a revolução mundial e o Brasil (1922-1935) (1991). Pinheiro focused on state repression and social struggles. Local historians stick to the official history, seeking to prevent the history of Oiapoque from being tainted by the short time in which the prison camp existed.\nAlexandre Samis, author of Clevelândia: anarquismo, sindicalismo e repressão política no Brasil (2002), had a similar perspective to Pinheiro. He and Romani have an ideological affinity with anarchism or libertarian socialism. For an additional historian of Clevelândia, Edson Machado de Brito, Pinheiro, Samis and Romani presented, each in their own way, the penal colony as a \"milestone of the resistance's defeat\". He, on the other hand, emphasizes that dissent survived the exile of part of its militants in Clevelândia. Samis presents the exiles as citizens imprisoned without trial, while Brito recalls the revolutionary danger that these dissidents represented to the State.\n\n\n== Deactivation ==\n\nThe Washington Luís administration, which had succeeded Artur Bernardes, ordered the release of the prisoners in 1927. On 14 January, O Combate reported a new wave of deportees to Clevelândia aboard the steamship Vasconcellos, but on 25 January it published that the prisoners had been amnestied. The last disembarkation of Clevelândia prisoners in Rio de Janeiro, according to the newspaper, was on 22 February 1927, aboard the steamship Macapá. According to the testimony of these prisoners, others remained in Clevelândia due to their health condition. The topic occupied the front page of newspapers for the first three months of 1927. The communist Octávio Brandão, a witness to the prisoners arrival, saw yellowish, thin and weak survivors, with diseased livers and swollen feet.\nArtur Bernardes earned the nickname \"Clevelândia President\" and remained associated with the penal colony. At his funeral, in 1955, a wreath was left with the words: \"The survivors of Clevelândia ask for forgiveness for having risen up against such an honest government and such a worthy president\", a possible irony on the part of his detractors.\nSome of the prisoners integrated into the local community and have descendants in the current population of Clevelândia. The town of Martinica expanded continuously, was renamed Oiapoque and in 1945 became the seat of the new emancipated municipality. The Cleveland Colonial Center was extinguished in 1936 and its assets were transferred to the Ministry of War, which transformed Clevelândia into a military colony in 1940. The location currently hosts the Special Border Company of the 34th Jungle Infantry Battalion. There is no visible material legacy of the penal colony, apart from possible burials in the São Carlos cemetery. The closed army archive in Clevelândia holds documents from various periods, including those from the penal colony.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAmapá Question\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===",

        "content": "Anita Daniel (1892–1978) was a Romanian-born German-American author and journalist known for her contributions to transatlantic understanding and cultural exchange between Europe and America. Throughout her career, she has focused on elucidating European affairs for American audiences and vice versa. Daniel, who grew up in Paris, France, was multilingual, fluent in French and Italian. Her syndicated newspaper columns and numerous publications have been translated into several languages, including Turkish, Persian, and Dutch. She is recognized for her ability to adapt her writing to the preferences of each country she addresses. Daniel's work has been diverse, ranging from travel guides like \"You'll Love New York\" to biographies such as \"Story of Albert Schweitzer.\" Her contributions have earned acknowledgment from various quarters, including the US Department of State.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nDaniel was born to a wealthy Jewish family in the Romanian university town of Iași, and went to school in France's Paris and Switzerland's Geneva. Growing up bilingual in French and German, she traveled often.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\nDaniel had a brother who was the head of a picture agency. He gave Daniel her first assignments. Her work was \"taking a trip around Europe and distract the kings and queens\" while photographer took 'special' pictures.\nDaniel began her writing career in Berlin in the 1920s, when she wrote primarily for Die Dame, published by Ullstein Verlag, and also for Ullstein's innovative magazine Uhu and the Jewish-German newspaper Aufbau. In 1933 she left Germany for Switzerland and then immigrated to the United States.\nIn 1945, while working as a feature writer for The New York Times, Daniel was victim to an accident that occurred in a restaurant. In the accident she was injured in her neck. She subsequently sued the owner of the restaurant, American playwright and screenwriter Preston Sturges on December 15, 1945. She sued him for $36,000, citing \"an electric fan in his [Preston's] restaurant cut her neck and kept her from interviewing Walt-Disney, Joan Crawford, and Aldous Huxley.\"\nShe wrote a number of travel books in English and German. Her shorter stories and articles appeared in French and Swiss publications and in American magazines including This Week, Vogue, The Christian Science Monitor, The American Mercury, among others.  She also contributed articles to The New York Times. Her articles catered to the public's appetite for light-hearted content that highlighted contemporary inventions.\nHer New York Times obituary notes that she died at age 85 in New York after a long illness.\nA collection of 120 of Daniel's texts was published in German in 2021 under the title Mondän ist nicht mehr modern ('Worldly is no longer modern').\n\n\n=== Sex Appeal ===\nDaniel's best-known article was published in 1928 in the German cultural magazine Uhu, titled \"Sex Appeal: Ein neues Schlagwort für eine alte Sache\" ('Sex Appeal: A New Catchword for an Old Thing'). It was republished in English translation in 1995 in the Weimar Republic Sourcebook, and in 2006 in the German History in Documents and Images site. This article delves into the emergence of the term “sex appeal,” as a new concept, distinct from traditional notions of beauty. She notes that the term originated in the United States, but became internationally recognized, similar to “flirt,” “dancing,” and “cocktail.” Daniel explains how, while in the past, people referred to this quality as “that certain something,” the term “sex appeal” took over to evoke a similar meaning.\n\n\n=== I Am Going to Switzerland ===\nAmong Daniels many travelogues, her 1952 book I Am Going to Switzerland received the most attention. The book was frequently featured, reviewed, and mentioned in the travel columns by contemporary periodicals in the USA. The book was frequently featured, reviewed, and cited in travel columns of American periodicals at the time. It served as an introduction to Swiss culture and lifestyle while also functioning as a comprehensive traveler's guide, offering detailed information on accommodations, shopping, and local festivals across various districts of Switzerland.\n\n\n=== The Story of Albert Schweitzer ===\nDaniel's biographical book on Alsatian polymath Albert Schweitzer was published c. 1957 and became critically acclaimed. The Canadian Champion called it an \"outstanding example of love for your neighbor regardless of race or creed – [whilst] the lesson of brotherhood so missing in the world today.\" Waxahachie Daily Light noted it as \"the story of the exciting adventures that is his [Schweitzer's] life is a vital and faithful portrait of a great man.\"\n\n\n== Works (selected) ==\n\n\n=== Books ===\nI Am Going to Switzerland. New York: Howard-McCann, 1952\nEin bisschen Glück. ('A Little Luck') Basel: Birkhäuser, 1953\nI Am Going to Italy. New York: Howard-McCann, 1955\nIch reise nach Paris.

        "content": "Nellie Constance Morrice  (31 March 1881 – 11 April 1963) was an Australian army and civilian nurse. Following her overseas military service in World War I, she was secretary of the New South Wales Bush Nursing Association for 23 years, overseeing significant growth in its coverage.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nNellie Constance Morrice was born on 31 March 1881. Her parents were Sarah Mary (née Hale) and grazier David Morrice. She was the seventh born in a family of 11 children.\n\n\n== Career ==\nMorrice trained to be a nurse at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, commencing in November 1903. She became a staff nurse in 1906 and was awarded her certificate in 1907 having worked in theatre, providing instruments and dispensing medication. She then completed midwifery training before working with private patients from 1907 to 1909, including as senior sister at a private hospital in Randwick.\n\n\n=== War service ===\n\nMorrice joined the Australian Army Nursing Service (AANS) in May 1910. She signed up as a sister with the Australian Imperial Force in November 1914 and left Australia on 28 November per HMAT Kyarra. On arrival in Egypt, she nursed with the No. 2 Australian General Hospital at Mena House, working under matron Nellie Gould.\nDuring her time in Egypt, Morrice handmade a doll for her niece, complete with nursing uniform, which she named \"Sister Helen\". The doll is held in the collection of the Australian War Memorial.\nShe volunteered for transfer to the 2nd Australian Stationary Hospital on Lemnos in September 1915 where she nursed the soldiers wounded at Gallipoli. She was promoted to head sister in March 1916, before sailing to England in October, where she served briefly in Dartford and Brighton. From November 1916 she served at Ismailia, next posted in April 1917 to Abbeville in France with the 3rd Australian General Hospital. October 1917 saw her working under matron Adelaide Kellett at the 25th British General Hospital, a 2400-bed facility fully staffed by Australian nurses.\nMorrice left France in December 1918 and returned to Australia on HMAT Demosthenes, working as matron. She received her discharge on 9 July 1919.\n\n\n=== Post-war work ===\nMorrice joined Georges Heights Military Hospital in Mosman as matron and served there until she was made secretary of the New South Wales Bush Nursing Association (BNA) in 1924.\nUnder her leadership, the number of bush nursing centres grew from 26 to 62, but nursing award changes and World War II saw a number of closures when no nurse could be found to fill the role. At the time of her retirement in January 1947, 31 remained open, while several had been transferred to health department management.\nMorrice died at her home in Chatswood on 11 April 1963. \n\n\n== Awards and recognition ==\nMorrice was awarded the Royal Red Cross (2nd Class) for her service in Flanders and France. In the 1934 Birthday Honours she was appointed a Member of the British Empire for her work as secretary of the NSW Bush Nursing Association. Her investiture, by Governor-General Sir Isaac Isaacs, took place at Government House, Sydney on 15 September 1934.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Collection of Sister Nellie Constance Morrice – photographs, with descriptions, held by the Australian War Memorial\nThe story behind the \"Sister Helen\" doll video",

She has served as President of the Association for Information Science and Technology and the Association for Library and Information Science Education. Her scholarship has been wide-ranging and she is particularly known for her research on the potential of information systems to support discovery and consideration of convergence curation. The first librarian to investigate Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Information Retrieval (IR), Smith also specified the role of AI as a human intermediary and identified the AI techniques of pattern recognition, representation, problem-solving, and learning as suitable for IR. AI is just like a human librarian who helps users navigate information systems.\n\n\n== Education and career ==\nLinda C.

        "content": "The Midland Alliance was an association football league for teams in the Midlands of England, which ran for three seasons in the 1890s.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe League was set up at a meeting at the Maypole Hotel in Nottingham in June 1890.  The aim was to form a competition akin to the Midland League for clubs overlooked for that particular division; 9 clubs initially pledged to join, with an invitation sent to Football League club Notts County for its reserve side (the Rovers) to take part.  County duly accepted and 10 teams formed the first league, officially called the Midland Football Alliance, but almost always referred to as the Midland Alliance.\n\n\n=== 1890–91 season ===\nRotherham Swifts, after winning only one of its first five matches, withdrew from the league in December 1890. Although the Alliance initially refused to accept the club's resignation, another member, Jardines, was suspended by the Football Association for non-payment of a fine.   On 17 April 1891 it was decided to expunge both clubs' records; this did not have any effect on the overall table, as Notts County Rovers were uncatchable, although it made the gap a little smaller as Jardines' only win had come against Rovers.\n\n\n=== 1891–92 season ===\nFive new clubs were elected into the competition, including three reserve sides - those of Derby County (the Wanderers), Lincoln City (the Swifts), and Long Eaton Rangers (the Athletic).   Leicester Fosse and Boston also applied to join, but were not elected; Sheffield, having finished bottom in the first season, was forced to apply for re-election, but was voted back in.\nGrantham Rovers, despite finishing fourth the previous season, decided not to enter again, as the club's debts had increased to £44 and it had to undertake a new guarantee scheme in order to continue at all; instead it sought bigger gates by joining the Midland League, and the club was replaced by its rival Grantham Town.  Two other clubs – Doncaster Rovers and Loughborough – also left for the Midland League.\nThe 1891–92 season saw each of the 10 clubs play out their entire fixtures, and Derby County Wanderers took the title, with 88 goals scored in 18 matches, more than double the total of runner-up Mansfield Town.\n\n\n=== 1892–93 season ===\nThe third season of the Alliance was its final season.  Mansfield Town was elected to the Midland League in May 1892; in June 1892 the Alliance voted to accept neighbours Greenhalgh's as a replacement, with two other clubs proposed by Mr Longdon of Newark, Matlock and the Nottingham Forest reserves, also accepted at the same time.  However, Newark in turn withdrew shortly afterwards to join the Midland League, and the Sheffield United reserve side, the Strollers, which had been turned down by the Sheffield & District Football League, was elected as a replacement.\nThe division suffered an early blow when Grantham Town withdrew in December, having played just three matches (one win, draw, and defeat each).  The remaining eleven clubs however completed their fixtures, and the Derby County reserves (now called Derby Town) again took the title, having secured the crown with 2 matches still to play.  One match was never finished; the game between Lincoln City Swifts and Heanor Town at John O'Gaunts in January was abandoned while scoreless with 13 minutes remaining, after Lincoln goalkeeper Johns was sent off for kicking an opponent (allegedly in retaliation), and the crowd invaded the pitch.  Heanor claimed both points, but the Alliance ordered that the result stand as 0–0, with Heanor keeping its point for a draw, and Lincoln having its point deducted. \n\n\n=== Disbanding ===\nThe Alliance held a meeting for admission of new clubs on 12 June 1893, but only two clubs – Derby Town and Notts Olympic – turned up, along with honorary secretary Mr Hines.  Given that most of the other clubs had found berths in different competitions, the three attendees voted to suspend the requirements for a quorum, and to disband the Alliance.\n\n\n== Clubs and points totals ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "John J. Chambers Crowell  (May 12, 1917, State College, Pennsylvania – May 13, 2015, Montecito, California) was an American professor of geology, known for his research in tectonics, sedimentation, and the geology of California, especially his studies of the San Andreas Fault.\n\n\n== Education and career ==\nBorn in Pennsylvania and the son of a father who became a professor of Romance languages at Claremont Colleges, John Crowell went to high school in Los Angeles County, California, and graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in 1939 with a degree in geology. He then matriculated as a graduate student in geology at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). During his study of the geology of part of the San Joaquin Valley, he was offered employment as a geologist by the Shell Oil Company. He briefly worked for that company before the United States entered WW II. He joined the U.S. Army, was given intensive training as an oceanographic meteorologist, and in May 1943 was commissioned a second lieutenant. He became a member of Operation Overlord's weather forecasting team. For his role in predicting weather and surf conditions for the June 6th 1944 D-Day invasion, Crowell was awarded a Bronze Star Medal. In the autumn of 1944, in preparation for the Burma campaign of 1944–1945, he was based in Ceylon and was one of the leaders of a U.S. Army convoy across the Ledo Road from India into China. In 1945 he became stationed in Manila and was assigned to work on the planned invasion of Japan. Upon the end of WW II, he returned to the United States and in 1946 met and married Betty Marie Bruner (1920–2007) in Los Angeles County. Their daughter Martha (nicknamed \"Marty\") was born in 1951.\nJohn C. Crowell graduated in 1946 with an MA in oceanographic meteorology from Scripps Institution of Oceanography and in 1947 with a PhD in geology from UCLA. His Ph.D. dissertation Geology of the Tejon Pass region, California was supervised by James Gilluly. At UCLA Crowell was a professor of geology for 20 years and then in 1966 joined the faculty of the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). With Preston Cloud, he founded the UCSB Environmental Studies Program. Crowell taught structural geology and tectonics (including field studies in tectonics) at UCSB, as well as short courses all over the world for the Continuing Education Program of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG). In many different countries, he and his graduate students conducted field studies in deserts  and mountain ranges. He remained a professor at UCSB until his retirement as professor emeritus. His doctoral students include Lawrence A. Frakes.\n\n\n== Research ==\nCrowell did research on sedimentation, tectonics, paleoclimatology, and California's geology. In the early and mid 1950s he published results on the origins of submarine canyons and turbidity currents. He studied flysch in California and in the Alps. In the 1950s and 1960s he published papers on the displacement history, including kinematics, sedimentation, and tectonics, of the San Gabriel Fault and the southern part of the San Andreas Fault. His research on the San Andreas Fault guided his subsequent research on the geology of similar tectonic belts in the North Sea region, the Alps, the Caribbean region, Southeast Asia, and Australia. He did important research on pull-apart basins and the origins of pebbly mudstone. In the late 1960s Crowell and his colleagues investigated ancient glaciations in Europe, North American, and on all of the Gondwanan continents and elucidated the histories and causes of continental glaciation.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\nCrowell was a Guggenheim Fellow for the academic year 1953–1954. He was elected in 1980 a Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and in 1981 a Member of the National Academy of Sciences. He received an honorary doctorate from the University of Louvain. He received in 1995 the Penrose Medal of the Geological Society of America and in 2013 the Lifetime Achievement Award of the Society for Sedimentary Geology (previously known as the Society of Economic Paleontologists and Mineralogists). In his honor, a mountain, mapped in the 1960s, is named Mount Crowell, which is located in Antarctica's Rare Range (a mountain range named for the Ronne Antarctic Research Expedition).\n\n\n== Family ==\nJohn Crowell's wife died in 2007 after 61 years of marriage. Upon his death in 2015 he was survived by his daughter, two grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren — all of whom were living in Santa Cruz, California.\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\nCrowell, John C.

        "content": "The Hitotsuyanagi clan (一柳氏, Hitotsuyanagi-shi) was a prominent Japanese samurai and kzoku clan. Originating from the Mino Province, it is believed to be a branch family of the Kono clan. The two brothers, Hitotsuyanagi Naosue and Naomori, played significant roles as loyal samurai serving Toyotomi Hideyoshi and eventually rose to the position of daimyo. During the early Edo period, Naomori's three children also became daimyo, solidifying the clan's influence and power. However, even after the abolition of the han system in the Meiji period, two of Naomori's descendants continued to hold the title of daimyo. These two domains, namely Iyo-Komatsu Domain and Harima-Ono Domain, maintained their status until the Meiji Restoration. The Hitotsuyanagi clan was recognized for their achievements and contributions, as they were granted the prestigious rank of viscount within the peerage system. This elevated their social standing and further solidified their position as a respected and influential clan in Japanese society.\n\n\n== Background ==\nHitotsuyanagi Naomori initially served Toyotomi Hideyoshi and eventually became a daimyo overseeing a domain of 35,000 koku in Owari Province. During the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, he aligned himself with Tokugawa Ieyasu, leading to an increase in his domain to 50,000 koku in the Kanbe Domain of Ise Province the following year. However, in 1636, he was relocated to the Saijō Domain of Iyo with 63,000 koku, but after his passing, his estate was divided among his three sons. The eldest son, Naoshige, inherited Saijo's 30,000 koku, but due to neglect of duties during Hitotsuyanagi Naoki's rule, it was lost in 1665. Naomori's second son, Naoie, who inherited Harima Province, initially owned 28,600 koku but saw it reduced to 10,000 koku in 1643 due to illness and a request for adoption towards the end of his life. The Ono Domain continued with 10,000 koku until the abolition of feudal domains. The family of Naomori's third son, Naoyori, who inherited Komatsu in Iyo Province, also maintained control over the Komatsu domain with 10,000 koku until the domain system was abolished and prefectures were established. Following the Meiji Restoration, both the former Ono and Komatsu feudal lords were recognized as viscount families within the peerage system. In \"Kansei Jushu Shokafu,\" it is stated that Nobutaka, the first generation of the Hitotsuyanagi clan, originated from Iyo Province as the son of Kono Michinao(Danjo Shohiku), a daimyo. Due to his father's death during the Daiei era (1521–1528), Nobutaka relocated to Nishino Village, Atsumi County, Mino Province (now Nishino-cho, Gifu City, Gifu Prefecture). Nobutaka, feeling regretful for being unable to trace his ancestors, expressed a desire to change his family name. During an audience, he was suggested the name \"Hitotsuyanagi\" because of the vibrant willow tree in the Kemari garden. However, there are alternative theories suggesting that this incident may have occurred in Nobutaka's grandfather's generation, or that Nobutaka's father might have been a different individual from Kono Tsunao, thus obscuring the precise relationship with the Kono clan.\nRegarding the origins of the Ichiyanagi clan, historical records mention Ichiyo Mikuriya (Ichiyo-so) in the territory of Ise Jingu Shrine in Owari Province, also known as \"Hitosuyanagi.\" Some opinions suggest a connection with Nakagawa Ward and Nakamura Ward in Nagoya City. Arai Hakuseki referenced this in \"Hankanfu.\" Another perspective proposes a hypothetical relationship with the Kono clan of Ochi in Iyo, considering Toki amino's territorial presence in Iyo Province. It is also suggested that the branch family of the Kono clan migrated to Mino due to these connections. Descendants of the Kona clan, including Inaba and Hayashi, also make claims to this lineage.\nThe Hongan-ji Temple Gifu Betsuin in Nishino-cho, Gifu City, is recognized as the former residence of Nobutaka. Family tradition recounts that Naotaka Ichiyanagi, Nobutaka's son, married the niece of Inaba Ittetsu. Additionally, Genko Nanka, who later became the chief of Myoshin-ji Temple at the Hoshi of Kaikawa Joki, is purportedly from the Ichiyanagi lineage, tracing his ancestry to Nobutaka (Taroemon).\n\n\n== History ==\nThe eldest son of Hitotsuyanagi Naomori, Hitotsuyanagi Naoshige, inherited 30,000 koku of the family estate. It was Naoshige who essentially established the Saijo Domain, constructing the residence and the town surrounding it. After Naoshige's death, his territory was divided between his two sons, Hitotsuyanagi Naooki (25,000 koku) and Hitotsuyanagi Naoteru (5,000 koku). Naooki became the third lord of the Saijo Domain, but was later stripped of his title in 1665, due to negligence and misgovernment. Naoteru, who became a hatamoto after being granted 5,000 koku, resided at the Hachikaichi residence in Tsune Village, Uma District, Iyo Province (present-day Tsune, Doi-cho, Shikoku Chuo City, Ehime Prefecture). His son, Naomasu, had his fief relocated to Mino District, Harima Province, and resided at the Takagi residence (present-day Takagi, Bessho-cho, Miki City, Hyogo Prefecture). This branch of the clan continued as a hatamoto residing at the Takagi residence until the end of the Edo period, as recorded in the \"Kansei Genealogy\" compiled by the Naogo clan. Hitotsuyanagi Naomasa's second son, also named Hitotsuyanagi Naomasa (2), was the lord of several territories in Harima Province and established his residence in Kawanohe, Iyo Umma District. However, after Naomasa's death, the succession to Naomasa was uncertain, and in 1643, his territory in Iyo Province was confiscated, leaving him with only 10,000 koku in Kato District, Harima Province. Naomasa's descendants continued to rule as the lords of Ono Domain until the end of the Edo period. After the Meiji Restoration, the Hitotsuyanagi clan became a family and was classified as a court noble. The last lord, Hitotsuyanagi Suenori, served as the governor of Ono Domain until the abolition of the han system. Suetoku was ennobled as a viscount when the peerage system was established. One of Suetoku's daughters married an American missionary and architect, who changed his name to Hitotsuyanagi Beirai. During the early Showa period, the residence of the Hitotsuyanagi clan was located in Okuradani, Akashi City. Hitotsuyanagi Naomori's fourth son, Hitotsuyanagi Nagayoshi (also known as Toshinari or Josunosuke), became a retainer of the Hiroshima Domain and received a fief of 1000 koku. On the other hand, Naomori's fifth son, Ichirou Nagasumi, served the Tokugawa family of Kofu, and his successor, Naomasa, became a hatamoto with a stipend of 870 koku. However, in 1790, during the time of Hitotsuyanagi Nagasato (Kannojou), the family was deprived of their status due to misconduct. Ukon Yagiu (Kanayu), a member of Hideyoshi's Kii-Momoyama clan, became the lord of Kuwana Castle in Ise Province. His genealogical relationship with brothers Naosue and Naomori is debated, with some sources suggesting they were \"unknown\" and others saying they were \"cousins.\"\nDuring the early Showa period, the Ichiryanagi family conducted research on their history and honored their ancestors. They erected a monument at Yamana Castle, held an unveiling ceremony, and published a booklet called \"Ichiryanagi Family History Summary.\" This booklet included a family tree and identified individuals with the Ichiryanagi surname. It categorized certain lineages as \"connected families.\" These lineages included the family of Hitotsuyanagi Michikata, who was appointed as the Neodai of Mino Province, and the descendants of Ichiryanagi Michimasa, who served as equestrian instructors for the Ogaki Domain and the Toda clan. The descendants of Ichiryanagi Shosai served as village headmen in Nijosaneko Village, and Ichiryanagi Tarozaemon initiated the construction of the Nakajima Canal. The family lineage of Hitotsuyanagi Suenori served the Aizu Domain, and the court physician Kuronose Masarim claimed to be a descendant of Michitaka. The Hitotsuyanagi clan that served the Asano clan of the Hiroshima Domain also claimed descent, according to the \"Geihan Shuyo.\n\n\n== Family crest ==\n\nIn \"Kaneifu,\" the Hitotsuyanagi family's crest is described as \"Marunouchi ni Kuinuki\" and originally consisted of \"three characters\".\nIn \"Kanseifu,\" the crests used by the Hitotsuyanagi clan are detailed as follows:\n\"Pull out a nail in a circle\" (used by the Saijo Domain, Komatsu Domain, and Hatamoto Hitotsuyanagi clan)\n\"Double nails pulled out in a circle\" (used by the Ono Domain, and the Hatamoto Hitotsuyanagi clan)\n\nIchiju Kugi-Nuki\" (an old tradition of the Hatamoto Hitotsuyanagi clan)\nThree characters\" (used by the Saijo Domain of Kan'eifu)\nSanmonji Oreshiki\" (an old tradition of the Hatamoto Hitotsuyanagi clan)\nOreshiki Sanmonji Ichirin\" (an old legend of the Komatsu Domain)\nShukusanmonji on oreshiki\" (an old legend of the Hatamoto Ichiyanagi Naosato family and the Ono clan lord family).\nIn 1933, Hitotsuyanagi Naokichi, a descendant of the Hitotsuyanagi clan, compiled a book on family history titled the Hitotsuyanagi Family History Bulletin. This book stated that the Ichiyanagi family after Noritaka used the crest \"maru-ni-kugi-nuki\" (\"Maruno-naka kugi-nuki\"), indicating the recognition that the crest of the three Ichiyanagi families after the early modern period was \"double kugi pulled out in a circle.\" The design of the cover of the \"Ichiyanagi Family History Bulletin\" includes \"nail in a circle,\" \"double nail in a circle,\" and \"three characters on orishiki\" derived from the Kono clan (in the main text, \"shosanmonji on square orishiki\"). The term \"double nail in a circle\" is also referred to as \"Hitotsuyanagi nail puller,\" but there are other designs sometimes called \"Hitotsuyanagi Kugi-nuki\" [40].\nAccording to page 165 of \"Tracing Your Family Line with Family Crests,\" edited by Shigeru Chikano (Zokugun Documents Jukankai), \"double nail in a circle\" is commonly referred to as \"Hitotsuyanagi nail puller,\" though there are other designs with different names, sometimes called \"Hitotsuyanagi Kugi-nuki.\"\n\n\n== Genealogy ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of han\nAbolition of the han system\nKomatsu Domain\nOno Domain\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Dinehart-Holt House is a historic house museum located in Slayton, Minnesota. Built in 1891, the museum offers a glimpse into the lives of prominent residents C.E. Dinehart and his family, as well as the early days of Slayton and Murray County.\n\n\n== History ==\nC.E. Dinehart, a founding member of the State Bank of Slayton and prominent landowner, commissioned the house in 1891. Architect Frank Thayer, who also designed the Murray County Courthouse, was hired to bring Dinehart's vision to life. The Dineharts raised livestock and were known for their community gatherings featuring Flora Dinehart's piano, the first in the county.\nThe house eventually passed to the Holt family through Florence Dinehart's marriage to Harvy Holt. Judge John Holt, one of their sons, resided in the house until his passing in 1993. Following his death, the house and its furnishings were sold. Murray County purchased the property in 2007 with the intention of preserving it as a museum.\n\n\n== Significance ==\nListed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1982, the Dinehart-Holt House is a well-preserved example of Victorian architecture in Murray County.  The museum's collection reflects the lifestyle of a prosperous family in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Visitors can explore the house and learn about the Dineharts and Holts, gaining a deeper understanding of Slayton's and Murray County's social and economic development.\n\n\n== Exhibits and Events ==\nThe Dinehart-Holt House Museum offers tours that showcase the period furnishings and architectural details. The museum also highlights the stories of the Dinehart and Holt families, their contributions to the community, and the broader history of Murray County.  In addition to tours, the house can be rented for special occasions.\n\n\n== Murray County Historical Society ==\nThe day-to-day operations of the Dinehart-Holt House Museum fall under the purview of the non-profit organization, Murray County Historical Society. The property was acquired in 2007 by the government of Murray County with the specific purpose of preserving it as a museum. This acquisition ensured the house's long-term protection and its continued role as a public educational resource.\nThe Murray County Historical Society, a non-profit organization founded in 1934, is dedicated to preserving and sharing the history of the county. In addition to the recently acquired Dinehart/Holt House built in 1891, their facilities include, the Murray County Historical Museum, the Sierk Building showcasing the agricultural heritage, and the Wornson Log Cabin from 1872.\nIn addition to operating several museums, the organization maintains an archive of documents pertaining to history of Murray County, including the original blueprints for the Great Oasis drainage project of 1913 and the original blueprints for the Dinehart Holt House.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of museums in Minnesota\n\n\n== References ==",

Their trial was an unprecedented case in Russia in that the majority of a large crime group were of Russian nobility, and also included other elites, such as wealthy merchants. Even one member of higher aristocracy, knyaz Vsevolod Dolgorukov, was indicted. The case involved about 50 defendants and over 300 witnesses. Dozens of criminal episodes were considered, mostly of fraud and forgery, but also one case of murder.  The name of the group comes from the 1858 Rocambole picaresque novel Le Club des Valets de Coeur by Pierre Alexis Ponson du Terrail.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "On October 15, 2020, militants from Al-Shabaab, the Islamic State – Central Africa Province's branch in Mozambique, launched an incursion into the village of Kitaya in Mtwara Region, Tanzania, the group's first claimed attack in Tanzania. At least twenty civilians were killed in the massacre.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIslamist insurgents allied with the Islamic State have waged in insurgency in the Cabo Delgado Province in northern Mozambique, on the border with Tanzania, since 2017. While al-Shabaab initially started as local gangs of Mwani militants disgruntled with the Filipe Nyusi government, the group established connections with the Congolese Islamic State – Central Africa Province (ISCAP) in 2018, and ISCAP as a whole has expressed the intention to expand to other East African states like Kenya and Tanzania. In 2017, unknown militants killed twelve police officers in linked attacks in Kabiti and Dar es Salaam.\n\n\n== Massacre ==\nThe jihadists made their way to Kitaya by entering Tanzania by sea, and moving up the Ruvuma River that demarcates the Tanzanian-Mozambican border. Tanzanian police estimated that around 300 jihadists took part in the massacre. In videos released by the Islamic State, the attackers were speaking Swahili, Makua, and Mwani, the two latter languages being spoken in northern Mozambique. Villagers in the town helped ISCAP identify which houses to set ablaze, and videos showed the attackers decapitating a man and looting weapons. In the videos, the jihadists' goal was \"to kill the infidels\", and was unrelated to the election that occurred the next day.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nAt least twenty people were killed in the massacre in Kitaya. The attack was claimed that same day by ISCAP, and it marked the first confirmed attack in Tanzania by the Mozambican branch of ISCAP. ISCAP launched a second attack in Mtwara province on October 28, killing five people and burning down several homes in Michenjele. In November 2020, Tanzanian police detained an unknown number people from Kigoma, Mwanza, and elsewhere in Tanzania headed to the Tanzanian-Mozambican border to join ISCAP.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Tovorafenib, sold under the brand name Ojemda, is a medication used for the treatment of glioma. It is a kinase inhibitor.\nThe most common adverse reactions include rash, hair color changes, fatigue, viral infection, vomiting, headache, hemorrhage, pyrexia, dry skin, constipation, nausea, dermatitis acneiform, and upper respiratory tract infection. The most common grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities include decreased phosphate, decreased hemoglobin, increased creatinine phosphokinase, increased alanine aminotransferase, decreased albumin, decreased lymphocytes, decreased leukocytes, increased aspartate aminotransferase, decreased potassium, and decreased sodium.\nIt was approved for medical use in the United States in 2024, and is the first approval of a systemic therapy for the treatment of people with pediatric low-grade glioma with BRAF rearrangements, including fusions.\n\n\n== Medical uses ==\nTovorafenib is indicated for the treatment of people six months of age and older with relapsed or refractory pediatric low-grade glioma harboring a BRAF fusion or rearrangement, or BRAF V600 mutation.\n\n\n== History ==\nEfficacy was evaluated in 76 participants enrolled in FIREFLY-1 (NCT04775485), a multicenter, open-label, single-arm trial in participants with relapsed or refractory pediatric low-grade glioma harboring an activating BRAF alteration detected by a local laboratory who had received at least one line of prior systemic therapy. Participants were required to have documented evidence of radiographic progression and at least one measurable lesion. Participants with tumors harboring additional activating molecular alterations (e.g., IDH1/2 mutations, FGFR mutations) or with a known or suspected diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1 were excluded. Participants received tovorafenib based on body surface area (range: 290 to 476 mg/m2, up to a maximum dose of 600 mg) once weekly until they experienced disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the application for tovorafenib priority review, breakthrough therapy, and orphan drug designations.\n\n\n== Society and culture ==\n\n\n=== Names ===\nTovorafenib is the international nonproprietary name.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Tovorafenib\".

        "content": "Caliente de Durango is a professional baseball team in the Mexican League based in Durango. Their home ballpark is the Estadio Francisco Villa, with a capacity of 6,000 people. The team was established in 2024 after the former Durango's Mexican League franchise, Generales de Durango, was suspended by the league due to its owner's legal problems. The club debuted in the 2024 Mexican League season.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe city of Durango had its first professional baseball team in 1956 when the Alacranes de Durango joined the Mexican Central League, a minor league that served as feeder for the Mexican League. After several years playing in the Mexican Central League, the Alacranes joined the Mexican League in 1976 and played for four seasons, from 1976 to 1979.\nProfessional baseball returned to Durango in 2017, when the Delfines del Carmen moved to Durango and were renamed as Generales de Durango. The Generales played in the Mexican League until 2023, but were suspended by the league in February 2024 after its owner, Venezuelan businessman Carlos Lazo, was involved in legal problems accused of fraud. Lazo also owned the Reds de la Ciudad de México of the Liga de Fútbol Americano Profesional (LFA); the Reds were similarly suspended by the LFA.\nIn March 2024 it was officially announced that a new team, owned by Grupo Caliente, would be joining the Mexican League as a replacement for the Generales. The new franchise would retain the same players that the Generales had before being suspended and would remain in Durango, playing in the Estadio Francisco Villa. Luis Borges, the Generales manager, and most of the players remained with the new team. The club was presented as Caliente de Durango with red, black and white as its colors, owing to Grupo Caliente's corporate colors. This marked the first time in Mexican professional baseball that a team's name included a corporate sponsor and the decision sparked controversy and mockery amongst fans.\nCaliente debuted in the Mexican League on 12 April 2024 against the Saraperos de Saltillo, winning its inaugural game 7–4.\n\n\n== Roster ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"Without You\" is a song recorded by American singer and songwriter Mariah Carey. It is a cover of the Badfinger song based on the version by Harry Nilsson. It was released as the third single off Music Box in the first quarter of 1994, its US release date of 21 January 1994 by Columbia Records, falling a week after Nilsson had died following a heart attack on 15 January 1994. In the US \"Without You\" was promoted as a double A-side with \"Never Forget You\". While she had heard Nilsson's version as a very young girl, Carey's decision to remake his hit was based on a chance hearing during the time she was recording Music Box: \"I heard that song in a restaurant and just knew it would be a huge international hit\" recalls Carey. Carey's version has been considered very popular on talent shows. \"Without You\" was later included on some non-US pressings of her compilation albums #1's (1998) and #1 to Infinity (2015), and her 2001 compilation, Greatest Hits. \"Without You\" was also included on her 2008 compilation The Ballads.\nIn February 2008, Carey's version was performed in severely broken English on the Bulgarian talent show Music Idol by contestant Valentina Hasan, spawning a global meme called \"Ken Lee\" (misinterpretation of the line \"Can't live\").\n\n\n== Release ==\n\"Without You\" was released on 21 January 1994 in the United States, where Columbia distributed 7-inch vinyls, 12-inch vinyls, cassettes, maxi cassettes, CDs, and maxi CD singles. The label issued it in the United Kingdom on 7 February as a 7-inch vinyl, cassette, and CD. RCA re-released Nilsson's version on the same day. Columbia issued a second UK CD a week later. Sony Music Japan released a mini CD in that country on 21 February.\n\n\n== Chart performance ==\n\"Without You\" reached number three on the US Billboard Hot 100 for six weeks, remaining in the top 40 for 21 weeks and on the chart for 23. It reached number two on both the Billboard Hot 100 Airplay and Radio & Records pop charts (ending Carey's streak of consecutive number ones on the latter chart; all ten of her previous singles had gone to the top), and number three on the Hot 100 Singles Sales. It was certified platinum by the RIAA and sold 600,000 copies domestically. It was ranked 16 on the Hot 100 1994 year-end charts. In Canada, it peaked at number four.\n\"Without You\" remains Carey's biggest hit across Europe. In the United Kingdom, where Carey had yet to score a number one hit, \"Without You\" made its UK chart debut at number one where it remained for four weeks in total, and later ended as the 7th best-selling single of 1994 in the United Kingdom. Additionally, Carey achieved a \"Chart Double\" in the UK, with both \"Without You\" and the album Music Box holding the top spot at the same time. In the UK, \"Without You\" was Carey's only number-one solo hit (seven years later, she topped the charts with her collaboration with Westlife: \"Against All Odds\" in 2000), until Carey scored a second number-one solo hit with \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" in 2020. \"Without You\" was certified platinum in the UK with combined sales and streams of 600,000. It was a runaway success across Europe, in which it topped the European Hot 100 Singles chart for two weeks. \"Without You\" reached number one for ten weeks in Switzerland; eight weeks in Austria and Sweden; seven weeks in Belgium; five weeks in Ireland and the Netherlands; four weeks in Germany and Iceland; and two weeks in Scotland, where Carey's success had previously been limited. The song also peaked at number two in France and Denmark; at number three in Norway; and at number four in Lithuania. \"Without You\" was certified platinum in Germany and Austria by IFPI, and gold in France by SNEP.\nBeing a number-three hit for Carey in Australia, \"Without You\" topped the charts in New Zealand for one week. It was certified 2× platinum in Australia by ARIA, and gold in New Zealand by RIANZ.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nScottish Aberdeen Press and Journal described the song as \"inspirational\". Billboard wrote, \"Carey offers a faithful rendition of the eternally sweet pop ballad\", adding that the \"song's arrangement is infused with all the romance and drama it requires, with Carey rising above the mix with a vocal that is more heartfelt and gutsy than note-scaling and acrobatic.\" Troy J. Augusto from Cash Box named it Pick of the Week, stating that \"Carey has thankfully learned the important difference between dynamic control and sonic overkill, never more evident than here. Her recent short concert tour revealed Mariah to be an anxious, under-confident live performer, but this song, with its accompanying tale of her own childhood loneliness made \"Without You\" the show's climax. Expect a long chart life.\" \nDavid Browne of Entertainment Weekly called Carey's cover a \"by-the-numbers remake of Nilsson's melodramatic 1972 hit.\" John Kilgo from The Network Forty concluded that \"exhibiting her dynamic vocal range with powerful emotion, Mariah scores again with her rendition of Harry Nilsson's chart topper.\" A reviewer from People Magazine noted that \"she takes on a sensuality—in a lower register—that is often sacrificed for her \"look Ma, no hands\" vocal fireworks.\" In an 2015 retrospective review, Pop Rescue stated that \"Without You\" gives the singer \"a ton of space to really let her vocals reach wherever they want to\", adding it as \"an epic track, and a fantastic showcase of her vocals.\" Stephen Holden of Rolling Stone called it the \"likeliest contender\" for ballads like \"I Will Always Love You\", praising how Carey \"dips into her lower register and is accompanied by backup singers (including herself) magnified to sound like a mighty gospel chorus.\" Mike Joyce from The Washington Post stated, \"Unlike Nilsson, Carey has the pipes to pull off this anguished pop aria\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nWorldwide CD single\n\"Without You\" – 3:38\n\"Never Forget You\" – 3:45\nEuropean maxi-CD single #1\n\"Without You\" – 3:38\n\"Never Forget You\" – 3:45\n\"Dreamlover (live from Here Is Mariah Carey)\" – 4:09\nEuropean maxi-CD single #2\n\"Without You\" – 3:38\n\"Vision of Love\" – 3:28\n\"I'll Be There\" (Featuring Trey Lorenz) – 4:28\n\"Love Takes Time\" – 3:48\n\n\n== Credits ==\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of Music Box.\nLocations\n\nPersonnel\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications and sales ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Kesteven 75, abbreviated as Kes 75 and also called SNR G029.7-00.3, G29.7-0.3 and 4C -03.70, is a supernova remnant located in the constellation Aquila.\n\n\n== Morphology ==\nKesteven 75 is a supernova remnant of composite morphology. In the radio band, it shows a shell or partial shell of about 90 arcseconds in radius, with a central nebula of about 25 × 35 arcseconds. The complete absence of emission in the eastern part indicates a strong density gradient of the interstellar medium where Kesteven 75 expands. The central component has been observed to have a flat radio spectrum with substantial polarization, which is characteristic of a pulsar or plerion wind nebula. The expansion speed of this plerion is approximately 1000 km/s. \nX-ray observations with the ASCA and Chandra observatories also show the composite nature of Kesteven 75, its morphology being very similar to that of radio frequencies. The emission from the shell of Kesteven 75 is mainly concentrated in two regions, to the southeast and southwest. Likewise, a \"jet\"-torus structure, common in young plerions, has been identified. According to certain observations of Chandra, the spectra of the shell can be explained by a thermal model of two temperatures, possibly associated on the one hand with the impacted material, and on the other with the ejecta material that has suffered a second impact due to the reverse shock.\nThe infrared emission from the shell is spatially correlated with the X-ray emission, suggesting that the dust particles are heated by the collision of gas previously heated by the X-rays. This dust reaches a temperature of 140 K due to upon collision with a hot and relatively dense plasma. \nKesteven 75 has also been detected in the gamma ray region between 20 and 200 keV with the INTEGRAL space observatory, and between 0.3 and 5 TeV with the H.E.S.S telescope system.\n\n\n== Progenitor ==\nBased on the high velocity of the ejecta and the low density implied by the initially estimated distance (much greater than currently accepted), it has been suggested that Kesteven 75 comes from a type Ib/c supernova explosion. However, subsequent studies have proposed that Kesteven 75 is probably the result of a more common type IIP supernova, where the plerion expands into an asymmetric nickel bubble. The parent star is thought to have a mass between 8 and 12 solar masses.\n\n\n== Stellar remnant ==\nKesteven 75 houses the X-ray pulsar PSR J1846−025, discovered in 2000, which provides energy to the plerion. It is a highly energetic stellar remnant (E = 8.3 × 1036 erg/s) whose rotation period is 325 ms. In 2006, it was detected that this pulsar was in an \"active\" or \"flaring\" state, which led to changes in its spectrum, as well as in the morphology of the associated plerion; Fourteen years later, activity was detected again in PSR J1846−025. However, the energetic and spectral properties of this pulsar firmly distinguish it from a magnetar. Its inferred magnetic field (Bs = 4.9 × 1013 G) is the largest among this type of objects, and is probably responsible for the activity intervals discovered, suggesting a transition to a magnetar state.\n\n\n== Distance ==\nAlthough historically estimates of the distance to Kesteven 75 have varied significantly between 5,000 and 21,000 parsecs, recent analyzes based on H I observations place this supernova remnant at 5,800 ± 500 parsecs from Earth. On the other hand, Kesteven 75 is a very young supernova remnant, with an age of less than 840 years. The study of the expansion of the plerion over 10 years has allowed us to limit the age of this remnant to 480 ± 50 years . Consequently, Kesteven 75 contains the youngest plerion in our galaxy.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of supernova remnants\n\n\n== External links ==\nKesteven 75 at SIMBAD\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "On September 12, 2023, clashes broke out between the Malian Armed Forces and the Wagner Group against the Permanent Strategic Framework for Peace, Security, and Development (CSP-PSD) in and around the city of Bourem. The battle was the first major attack by the CSP-PSD on Malian forces since the battle of Ber in August.\n\n\n== Prelude ==\n\nDuring late 2023, tensions between the Malian junta that came to power in a 2021 coup d'état and the Coordination of Azawad Movements (CMA), a coalition of rebel groups that signed the Algiers Accords in 2015. On the night between August 4 and 5, 2023, a CMA post was attacked by Malian forces in Fooita. The CMA denounced the deaths of two fighters, and accused the Malian junta and the Wagner Group of being behind the attack. Malian and Wagner officials did not respond to the accusations. In the days that followed, CMA representatives left the Malian capital of Bamako. Tensions between the CMA and junta came to a head between August 11 and 12, when Malian forces captured the MINUSMA base and surrounding town of Ber from CMA fighters just before MINUSMA evacuated the base.\nIn the following weeks, tensions between the junta and Tuareg groups intensified. On September 8, the pro-government GATIA denounced the bombing of their base by Malian helicopters in Afawlawlaw, near Gao. The next day, the CMA announced that they had shot down a Malian Sukhoi Su-25 jet in Tinouake, north of Gao after the jet had bombed CMA positions. The Malian Air Force denied that the jet was shot down.\nThe CSP-PSD, a coalition of all rebel groups including the CMA and Platform, accused the junta and Wagner Group of multiple breaches of the ceasefire outlined in the Algiers Accords, and stated they would \"adopt all measures in self-defense against the junta.\" The Movement for the Salvation of Azawad, part of Platform, distanced itself from this statement. On September 12, the CSP-PSD declared war on the junta.\n\n\n== Battle ==\nThe town of Bourem was attacked by CSP-PSD fighters on the morning of September 12. CSP-PSD fighters quickly seized the Malian military camp in the northern part of the town after besieging it. Immediately after it's capture, Malian Air Force jets launched airstrikes on the town and camp and sent troops to recapture it. Both the junta and the CSP-PSD declared victory at the camp. The Malian Army, in a statement released the same day, claimed to have repelled the offensive, and launched a counter-offensive against the CSP-PSD later on.\nJournalist Wassim Nasr stated that the CSP-PSD fighters had captured four Malian outposts in and around Bourem, but were unable to capture the main base in the city. Later in the day of September 12, CSP-PSD and CMA officials claimed responsibility for the attack \"against the Malian Army and the Wagner terrorist militia.\" The CSP-PSD stated that their offensive was carried out on four fronts, and that fighting lasted two hours. They also stated that four outposts were seized except for a Malian position in the eastern part of the city. The CSP-PSD also claimed control over the Malian base, although stated that they withdrew following intense clashes immediately after it's capture. CSP-PSD spokesman Mahmoud El Maouloud Ramadane stated that \"taking the city was not our initial objective, our objective isn't to stay in cities.'\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe Malian army stated that ten soldiers were killed and thirteen were wounded, and claimed that forty-six attackers. The CMA claimed the deaths of nine fighters, the injuries of eleven others, and the destruction of three of their own vehicles. They also claimed ninety-seven Malian soldiers were killed in Malian airstrikes while they were being held prisoner. Only five soldiers survived, including a colonel who was detained on September 13. Nasr stated that a captain, the son of a Malian general, was among the prisoners.\nOn September 17, CSP-PSD fighters attacked Malian forces in Léré, killing dozens of Malian soldiers.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "African Americans in the United States have a unique history of homesteading, in part due to historical discrimination and legacies of enslavement. Black American communities were negatively impacted by the Homestead Act's implementation, which was designed to give land to those who had been enslaved and other underprivileged groups. The act sought to divide up public lands in five Southern states to black people who were prepared to improve and utilize the land for farming. \n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n== Great Plains communities ==\n\nAmong the six black homesteading communities in the Great Plains were Blackdom, New Mexico; Nicodemus, Kansas; DeWitty, Nebraska; Sully County, South Dakota; Empire, Wyoming; and Dearfield, Colorado. Black American settlers frequently organized into groups and started these communities by combining their labor and resources to create profitable homesteads. They established churches, schools, and other social organizations to promote unity and belonging.\nDespite their tenacity and creativity, African American homesteaders still had to overcome formidable obstacles. In the journal \"African American Homesteader “Colonies” in the Settling of the Great Plains\", the writers talk about how unfair practices hindered their success, like not being able to get loans or agricultural extension services. Further obstacles to agricultural development were the severe weather of the Great Plains, which included severe winters and drought.  \nA recent study carried out at the University of Nebraska with funding from the National Park Service provides a detailed account of the number and achievements of black homesteaders in the area. \n\nAn estimated 3,500 black claimants are believed to have been successful in securing their patents, or titles, from the General Property Office, which has allowed them to own some 650,000 acres of prairie property.\nUp to 15,000 individuals, including all family members, called these homesteads home.\n\n\n=== Dearfield ===\n\nDuring a period of severe racial prejudice, Black families seeking opportunity and autonomy found sanctuary in the Colorado community of Deerfield. Deerfield prospered for a while, having a church, school, and other businesses, although encountered many obstacles, such as severe weather and financial troubles. Eventually, the town began to collapse, mostly as a result of economic causes like the industrialization of agriculture and the Great Depression. \nElaine Tassy's essay \"Deerfield – a Refuge for Black Homesteaders in the 1900s – could become part of the National Park Service\" explores plans to preserve the history of Deerfield, including suggestions to include it in the national park system. By granting this status, the town's historical value would be protected and safeguarded for upcoming generations. Author Tassy uses conversations with the town's founding relatives and local historians to give readers a glimpse into Deerfield's colorful past and its lasting significance as a representation of African American resilience and community building in the face of hardship. \n\n\n== Modern analysis ==\nIn Richards Edward's journal, \"African Americans and the Southern Homestead Act\", he contends that the act restricted African Americans' access to land because of fraud, prejudice, and bureaucratic barriers. He emphasizes the difficulties African Americans experienced in obtaining and preserving land, as well as the larger historical background of Reconstruction and African Americans' attempts to establish their rights and autonomy, through archival research and analysis. \nAlthough the goal of the Act was to give land to freed slaves, authors of the research paper \"Race and Local Knowledge: New Evidence from the Southern Homestead Act\" contend that local knowledge about the quality of the property was a major factor in deciding who was eligible for the program. They discovered that African American settlers were frequently given less attractive, lower-quality land, whereas white settlers tended to obtain the most valuable and bountiful property. \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Zeffiro (\"Zephyr\") was an Italian Nembo-class destroyer. Commissioned into service in the Italian Regia Marina (Royal Navy) in 1905, she served in the Italo-Turkish War and World War I, playing an active role in the Adriatic campaign. Reclassified as a torpedo boat in 1921, she was decommissioned in 1924.\n\n\n== Construction, commissioning, and modernization ==\n\nZeffiro was laid down at the Cantiere Pattison (English: Pattison Shipyard) in Naples, Italy, and launched on 14 May 1904 and completed on 1 April 1905. She was commissioned in April 1905.\nAt various times between 1909 and 1912, each of the Nembo-class destroyers underwent a radical modernization; Zeffiro′s took place in 1912. Her coal-fired boilers were converted into oil-fired ones, and her original two short, squat funnels were replaced with three smaller, more streamlined ones, profoundly altering her appearance. Her armament also changed, with her original five QF 6 pounder Nordenfelt 57 mm/43 guns replaced by four Cannon 76/40 (3 in) Model 1916 guns, and her original four 356-millimetre (14 in) torpedo tubes replaced by four 450-millimetre (17.7 in) tubes. Sometime between 1914 and 1918, Zeffiro underwent additional modifications in which minelaying equipment was installed aboard her.\n\n\n== Service history ==\n\n\n=== Italo-Turkish War ===\nThe Italo-Turkish War began on 29 September 1911 with the Kingdom of Italy′s declaration of war on the Ottoman Empire. At the time, Zeffiro was assigned to the Division of the Torpedo Boat Inspector and was being held in reserve at La Spezia. On the afternoon of 29 September, however, she took part in one of the first clashes of the war, the Battle of Preveza, when she, along with the destroyers Alpino, Artigliere, and Carabiniere and the torpedo boat Spiga engaged the Ottoman Navy torpedo boats Antalya and Tokad as they attempted to leave the port of Preveza on what then was the Ionian Sea coast of the Ottoman Empire. The Italian ships attacked the two torpedo boats at 14:00, and Artigliere seriously damaged Tokad and pursued her into the anchorage as she attempted to return to Preveza. Meanwhile, Zeffiro, Alpino, Carabiniere and Spiga surrounded Antalya. Hit repeatedly, seriously damaged, and on fire, with four members of her crew killed in action and numerous other crewmen wounded, Antalya struck her colors and ran herself aground on a nearby beach. As Antalya′s crew abandoned ship, members of Alpino′s crew boarded and captured her and removed her flag and her only usable gun, after which Alpino finished her off with gunfire. Zeffiro, Alpino, Carabiniere, and Spiga then joined Artigliere in the harbor and sank Tokad and an Ottoman gunboat. As the Italian ships departed, the crew of the Greek steamer Marte cheered them.\nIn a 1912 magazine article and a 1913 book based on contemporary sources, United States Navy Commodore W. H. Beehler offers a different version of the events of 29 September 1911. According to Beehler, the Italian ships sighted Antalya and Tokad in the Ionian Sea between Corfu and Preveza, steering north-northwestward, at either 15:00 or 16:00. The Italians opened fire, and the Ottoman ships returned fire only feebly. Tokad steamed northward chased by three Italian destroyers, while Antalya headed south with two Italian destroyers in pursuit. Hit 15 times and on fire, Tokad beached herself near Nicopolis and was totally destroyed, with her commanding officer and eight of her sailors either killed by the Italian gunfire or drowned. Meanwhile, Antalya reached Preveza undamaged. The Italian destroyers were undamaged and fired 100 76-millimetre rounds during the engagement.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\n\n\n==== 1915 ====\nWorld War I broke out in 1914, and Italy entered the war on the side of the Allies with its declaration of war on Austria-Hungary on 23 May 1915. At the time, Zeffiro, under the command of Capitano di corvetta (Corvette Captain) Arturo Ciano – a future admiral – as well as Alpino, Carabiniere, and the destroyers Ascaro, Fuciliere, and Pontiere made up the 4th Destroyer Squadron, based at Brindisi. In the predawn hours of 24 May 1915, during the first night of Italy's participation in the war, Zeffiro took part in the Raid on Porto Buso. At 02:00, she entered the navigable channel that led to the island of Porto Buso at the mouth of the river Ausa in the Grado Lagoon, a part of the larger Marano Lagoon, on which an Austro-Hungarian barracks and small port were located. At 03:00, from a range of about 500 metres (550 yd), she fired a torpedo at the port's jetty, damaging it. She then destroyed the motor boats and other small boats moored there and bombarded the barracks, damaging them and setting them on fire. The bombardment killed 11 Austro-Hungarians, who either died in the shelling itself or drowned while trying to swim to safety, and 48 others, including the commanding officer, surrendered to Zeffiro, which brought them aboard and took them to Venice as prisoners-of-war. Of the Austro-Hungarians based on Porto Buso, only 23 avoided death or capture, only six of whom were on Porto Buso itself: The other 17 were on other islands in the lagoon at the time of the raid.\n\n\n==== 1916 ====\nOn 30 April 1916, Zeffiro got underway to lay a minefield in the Adriatic Sea off Šibenik (known to the Italians as Sebenico) on the coast of Austria-Hungary, but had to abort the mission and return to base after encountering the Austro-Hungarian hospital ships Anfitride and Tirol. On the nights of 3–4 May and 4–5 May 1916, Zeffiro and Fuciliere succeeded in laying a minefield off Šibenik.\nSupported by Alpino, Fuciliere, and the coastal torpedo boats 40 PN and 46 OS, Zeffiro, under the command of Capitano di fregata (Frigate Captain) Costanzo Ciano – brother of her previous commander – and with Lieutenant Nazario Sauro, an Italian irredentist, aboard as pilot, entered the port of Poreč on the western side of Istria, a peninsula on Austria-Hungary's coast, at dawn on 12 May 1916. A group of men from Zeffiro, including Sauro, captured a gendarme who showed them the location of an aircraft hangar. In the meantime the other ships had joined Zeffiro, and at 04:50 they began a bombardment which lasted about 20 minutes. The hangar suffered damage from hits by 76-millimetre (3 in) shells from the Italian ships. Austro-Hungarian coastal artillery batteries returned fire,  and then 10 Austro-Hungarian seaplanes attacked the Italian ships. Allied aircraft came to the defense of the Italians, resulting in a dogfight in which Austro-Hungarian seaplanes collided with two Italian and one French aircraft. All the Italian ships returned to base, although they suffered damage and a number of casualties, including four men killed in action.\nOn 18 July 1916 Zeffiro and the torpedo boats Climene and Procione towed three seaplanes – L 141, L 156, and L 157 – to a point in the Adriatic Sea about 20 nautical miles (37 km; 23 mi) from the Dalmatian island of Mljet (known to the Italians as Meleda) – and supported them as they made an incursion into the Velebit Channel (known to the Italians as the Morlacca Channel) between the Dalmatian coast and the island of Pag (known to the Italians as Pago). The incursion was unsuccessful, yielding no results except for the loss of two of the seaplanes.\n\n\n==== 1917–1918 ====\nOn 24 September 1917 Zeffiro, Carabiniere, and Pontiere got underway from Venice to intervene in a clash between the Italian coastal torpedo boats 9 PN, 10 PN, 11 PN, and 12 PN and four Austro-Hungarian Navy destroyers. The battle ended following the intervention of Italian aircraft, and the Austro-Hungarian destroyers withdrew before the Italian destroyers could engage them.\nBy late October 1918, Austria-Hungary had effectively disintegrated, and the Armistice of Villa Giusti, signed on 3 November 1918, went into effect on 4 November 1918 and brought hostilities between Austria-Hungary and the Allies to an end. World War I ended a week later with an armistice between the Allies and the German Empire on 11 November 1918.\n\n\n=== Post-World War I ===\nAfter World War I ended, Zeffiro underwent modifications to her superstructure, propulsion system, and armament. Her bridge was moved aft, one of her three funnels was removed, and her engine power dropped to 3,400 horsepower (2,535 kW) and her maximum speed to 25 knots (46 km/h; 29 mph). In addition, one of her 76-millimetre guns was removed and a Colt Browning 65-millimeter/80-caliber antiaircraft machine gun was installed. Reclassified as a torpedo boat in 1921, she was stricken from the naval register in 1923 and subsequently scrapped.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nBeehler, W.

The league is contested by 20 teams, evenly divided in North and South zones. The season started on 11 April with the series between the defending champions Pericos de Puebla and Diablos Rojos del México and will end on 11 September with the last game of the Serie del Rey, the Mexican League championship series.\n\n\n== Team changes ==\nThe number of teams increased from eighteen in 2023 to twenty in 2024 (the last time that twenty teams contested the league was in 1979) with four new franchises joining the LMB for this season.\nDorados de Chihuahua and Conspiradores de Querétaro joined the league as expansion teams. The Dorados first played in the Mexican League in 1940 and had since played in the league in several stints, the most recent being from 2007 to 2010, while the Conspiradores were established in 2023, bringing professional baseball to Querétaro for the first time.\nCharros de Jalisco returned to the LMB after purchasing the Mariachis de Guadalajara; Charros last played in the Mexican League in 1995 and joined the Mexican Pacific League in 2014. Caliente de Durango, owned by Grupo Caliente, replaced Generales de Durango after the league suspended the Generales due to its owner's legal problems.\n\n\n== Standings ==\n\n\n== League leaders ==\n(Current through 24 April 2024)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Phasael or Phasa'el is an ancient Semitic, probably mainly Nabataean, gender-neutral name, i.e. used for both men and women.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe Semitic name took the form Faṣay-ʾel, and through contraction Faṣā-ʾel. According to Jérôme Norris, its meaning is \"ʾl delivered\" (see El (deity)).\nThe Semitic root pṣy takes in Aramaic and Hebrew the meaning 'to rescue, to deliver', and in Classical Arabic that of 'to separate, to remove', which by extension becomes 'to escape, to become free'. Safaitic inscriptions attest to the frequent use of words based on this root in invocations of divinities with the meaning of 'deliver!' and 'deliverance'. This convinces Norris of the meaning 'ʾl delivered' for Phasael, as opposed to opinions interpreting it as meaning 'God has opened (the womb)', or to seeing it as an innovative Hebrew theophoric name from the Second Temple period, given that among the Greek inscriptions containing it, only one is from Judaea, compared to twenty-nine from Transjordan and southern Syria, plus the fact that, as of 2017, it does not occur in any known Hebrew or Jewish Aramaic material. Norris, citing a 1975 paper by J.T. Milik and J. Starcky, explains the use of the name by Antipater for one of his sons, an older brother of King Herod, through the influence of his wife, who was of Arab/Nabataean origin.\nThe name  was rendered in many different spellings in Greek, in the masculin form mainly as Φασάηλος, Phasaelos, which in Latin became Phasaelus.\n\n\n== Historical figures and derived uses ==\n\n\n=== Herodians ===\nThere were three princes by the name Phasael in the Herodian dynasty: Phasael I (died 40 BCE), the elder brother of Herod the Great; Phasael II, his son; and Phasael III, a son of Herod the Great and father of Cypros, wife of Agrippa I.\nHerod named the town of Phasaelis, established by him in the Jordan Valley north of Jericho, and the Phasaelus tower in Jerusalem after his brother Phasael.\nNorris suggests that the name entered Herod's family through his mother, Cypros, a Nabataean noblewoman.\n\n\n=== Nabataean princess ===\nPhasa'el (Phasaelis, Phaisael), born in 5/4 BCE, was a Nabataean princess, daughter of King Aretas IV Philopatris who became the first  wife of Herod Antipas, ruler of Galilee and Perea.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSimilar theoforic names\nShamar (given name). The Hebrew verb 'shamar' means 'to protect/save/keep'. Shmaryahu/Shemaryahu or Shmarya/Shemaryah, 'Yah has kept/guarded', is a biblical name derived from it.\nYehoshua (Joshua in English; through Latin became 'Jesus'), Hebrew for 'Yahu is salvation\".\nYeshayahu (Isaiah in English), Hebrew for 'Yahu is salvation'.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Magic Shop was an American independent recording studio located at 49 Crosby Street in the SoHo neighborhood of Lower Manhattan in New York City. Established in 1988 by Steve Rosenthal, The Magic Shop hosted projects by David Bowie, Lou Reed, Foo Fighters, and others.\n\n\n== History ==\nMusician and engineer Steve Rosenthal, who had worked with Herb Abramson at A-1 Sound Studios prior to co-founding Dreamland studios, established the Larry Carswell-designed studio in a loft space at 49 Crosby Street in SoHo in 1988. Roselthal obtained a 32-input Neve mixing console originally commissioned for the BBC's Maida Vale Studios, which was later combined with a 24-input version of the same console to create a custom 56-input console in a project overseen by Rupert Neve himself. \nIn 1992, the studio gained notoriety with a string of notable album projects from Suzanne Vega, Lou Reed, Sonic Youth, and the Ramones. Producers Dave Sardy, Mitchell Froom, Tchad Blake, and John Agnello discovered the studio, leading to a steady stream of album projects.\nIn the early 2000s, Magic Shop expanded to add the Blue Room, which offered transfer, restoration, and mastering services, and Rosenthal was hired to remaster the first 22 Rolling Stones album releases.\nIn 2007, three projects that had been recorded at the Magic Shop, Keane's \"Is It Any Wonder?\", The Klezmatics Wonder Wheel, and Pink's \"Stupid Girls\", were nominated for Grammy Awards, reinforcing the studio's success. The following year, the studio expanded the services of the Blue Room by adding a second mastering facility, the Red Room, which Rosenthal shared with Elliot Mazer. In 2009, the studio restored over 100 recordings for a Rounder Records 100-disc reissue series compiled by musicologist Alan Lomax, the collection comprised recordings as old as 1938 from artists including Jelly Roll Morton, Lead Belly, Muddy Waters, Woody Guthrie, and many others.\nOn May 2, 2011, David Bowie and producer Tony Visconti began recording what would become the artist's album The Next Day (2014). Recording took place in secret; all personnel signed non-disclosure agreements.\nIn 2014, the Magic Shop and Steve Rosenthal were included in the final episode of Foo Fighters: Sonic Highways American rockumentary miniseries directed by Dave Grohl. At the time, the studio was struggling financially due to rapidly rising rent and outstanding debt. In 2015, David Bowie returned to the studio to record what would be his final studio album, Blackstar.\nA dispute with the studio's landlord exacerbated its financial problems. In an effort to help Rosenthal keep the studio afloat, David Grohl contributed approximately $50,000 and even unsuccessfully bid to buy the building, but these efforts failed, and the Magic Shop closed on March 16, 2016.\n\n\n== Selected list of Magic Shop recordings (by year) ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Manuela Zoccali is an Italian astronomer who works in Chile as a professor of astrophysics at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile in Santiago, and is the former director of the Millennium Institute of Astrophysics at the university. Her research concerns the metallicity of stars, particularly those in the galactic bulge of the Milky Way, and the implications of these observations for the evolution of both individual stars and the formation of the bulge. Her research has suggested the independent formation of stars in the bulge, rather than migration of stars from the galactic disk to its bulge.\n\n\n== Education and career ==\nZoccali is originally from Reggio Calabria in southern Italy. She was a student of astronomy at the University of Padua, where she earned a laurea in 1995, with undergraduate research on globular cluster NGC 1261, and completed her Ph.D. in 2000. Her doctoral dissertation concerned low-mass stars, and was supervised by Giampaolo Piotto.\nShe became a postdoctoral researcher at the European Southern Observatory from 2000 to 2003, during which she first visited Chile to help set up spectroscopy instrumentation at the Paranal Observatory. Next, she won a joint fellowship of Princeton University and the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile, funding her for a continued year of postdoctoral research through both universities. After starting a family in Chile, in 2004 she joined the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile as an assistant professor. She was promoted to associate professor in 2008 and full professor in 2016.\nShe was the director of the Millennium Institute of Astrophysics from 2016 to 2019, and continues as deputy director.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nZoccali was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2011.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHome page\nManuela Zoccali publications indexed by Google Scholar",

Its headquarters is located in Čakovec. Initially founded as an electoral list in March 2021 prior to that year's local elections, it took on its current name in July 2023.\nThe party is positioned on the political centre and seeks to gather independent lists from the region.\nPosavec was previously a member of the social liberal Croatian People's Party (HNS) and its Međimurje branch leader, until he left in 2019. He resigned as county prefect in September 2021 after a bribery affair was revealed and he was arrested. He initially confessed to accepting a 10 thousand kuna bribe, but later retracted the confession and successfully ran for a new mandate as county prefect in a special election. He was re-elected during the 2021 Croatian local elections in the first round.\nNPS won two seats in the Croatian Parliament at the 2024 Croatian parliamentary election. The party became a part of the Our Croatia alliance.\n\n\n== Election results ==\n\n\n=== Legislative ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

During his only season at Watford, Hugo scored six league goals in 25 appearances as Watford finished midtable. In 1966, Hugo moved to South Africa, signing for Port Elizabeth City, winning the National Football League with the club in 1967. Hugo spent two years at Port Elizabeth, before joining Highlands Park.

        "content": "Maximilian Arthur Fosh (born 3 April 1995) is a British YouTuber and comedian. As of April 2024, his eponymous YouTube channel has over 3.80 million subscribers.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMaximilian Arthur Fosh was born on 3 April 1995 in London, England, to father Matthew Fosh, an English cricketer and rugby union player. Fosh has an older sister. He attended Arnold House School in Westminster, London, before progressing to Harrow School - the same school his father attended - from 2008 until 2013.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Radio ===\nWhile studying for a combined honours in English literature and business at Newcastle University, Fosh began presenting at Radio Tyneside. When at Radio Tyneside, he won gold in the \"Best Newcomer\" category at the National Hospital Radio Awards in 2017.\nOn Christmas Day in 2022, Fosh presented a half-hour \"TikTok Takeover\" show on BBC Radio 1, following an event almost two years earlier which involved printing his CV in large text on the roof of a car, and parking it outside of Broadcasting House in London.\n\n\n=== YouTube ===\nFosh's main and eponymous YouTube channel has amassed more than 3.6 million subscribers, and includes \"silly\" pranks and jokes - as well as other comedic content. The channel was started on 13 January 2016 and posted its inaugural video on 18 October 2017, which started a series called \"StreetSmart\" (the channel's name at the time) where Fosh would interview people on the streets. \nIn May 2022, Fosh placed a large sign reading \"Welcome to Luton\", visible from the approach path for Gatwick Airport, to trick arriving travellers into thinking they were instead at Luton Airport, triggering reactions from local news and social media Being noticed by the media, Fosh made several appearances on TV and radio, although some people criticised the prank as having caused undue stress for arriving passengers. Fosh had use of the land on which the sign was placed for six weeks, and said that renting the land and materials for the sign cost more than £4000.\n\n\n=== Stand-up comedy ===\nFollowing his YouTube success, in 2021 Fosh toured the UK with his show \"Zocial Butterfly\", which he had originally written in 2019. He then went on to take the show to the Edinburgh Fringe in August 2022, his debut at the festival. Isobel Lewis of The Independent rated the performance two out of five stars, said he was \"promising\" despite lacking the \"comedy chops needed for a Fringe show.\"\n\n\n=== Other ===\nOn 9 September 2023, Fosh played in the Sidemen charity match, an association football match to raise money for charity, for the YouTube Allstars team. In the 78th minute, Fosh tackled and fouled Sidemen member Miniminter, resulting in referee Mark Clattenburg issuing him a yellow card. In response, Fosh pulled an Uno \"reverse card\" from his shorts and showed it to Clattenburg, garnering Internet and media attention.\n\n\n== 2021 London mayoral candidate ==\n\nFosh was an independent candidate in the 2021 London mayoral election, which was won by the incumbent, Sadiq Khan. Fosh said he ran simply to \"wind up\" fellow former Harrovian Laurence Fox, who was running as a right-wing candidate for the Reclaim Party, which Fox had recently founded. Fosh aimed to get more votes than Fox, but failed to do so, coming second from last. Fosh also said he wanted to increase youth turnout. Fosh put forward a set of comedic policies and said, \"I would make a terrible mayor\".\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Primary sources ===",

The film is directed by Sherif Arafa, written by Abdel Rahim Kamal, and produced by Walid Sabry, and stars Mohamed Saad, Mohamed Ramadan, Hend Sabry, Ahmed Rizk, Ahmed Hatem, Amina Khalil, and Ruby.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1975, Hassan Bishr decided to return from Europe after studying Egyptology to the family home in Luxor. He discovered that his father had left him a recorded will in which he narrated many details of his life. He also left him papyri dating back to the reign of Queen Hatshepsut, and handwritten notes attributed to him. For the hero, Ali Al-Zaybak, the events range from the Pharaonic era, the Ottoman era, and the first half of the twentieth century during the rule of King Farouk, as Hassan searches through all of this for what his father left for him.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nMohamed Saad as Beshr Al Katatni\nKhaled El Sawi\nMohamed Ramadan as Ali Al-Zibq\nHend Sabry as Hatshepsut\nAmina Khalil as Naemat\nAhmed Hatem\nHaitham Ahmed Zaki as Mostafa\nSawsan Badr\nHany Adel\nRuby as Zainab\nAhmed Amin\nMohi Ismail\nMohamed Mahmoud Abdel Aziz\nAbdelaziz Makhyoun\nEl-Shahat Mabrouk\nAhmad Seyam\nAbbas Abul-Hassan as Salah Elkalby\nTamim Abdo\nMahmoud El Lozy\nAbeer Farouq\nAhmed Rizq as Abdel Aziz\nNoha Abdeen\nRamsi Lehner as Thutmose II\nGamil Barsoum\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "On 26 December 1983, in Green Bay, Wisconsin,  Margaret Anderson (born October 6, 1948) was beaten, tortured, raped and finally killed by four members of a bike gang inside the Back Forty local bar. The case was finally solved after four years of hard work by the Green Bay Police Department, other jurisdictions, and the help of America's Most Wanted television show.\n\n\n== Murder ==\nOn Monday December 26, a day after Christmas, a friend of Margaret, Terry “Weasel” Apfel, a member of the local Drifters motorcycle club, stopped by her house at afternoon, and together they went out to see a movie and have a few drinks. At around 11:00 p.m., Apfel and her went to a bar called the Back Forty. The bar was owned by Mark “Shotgun” Lukensmeyer, himself also a Drifter.  Inside, some members of the Drifters and of the DC Eagles, another bike gang, had already spent the evening heavy drinking and taking drugs. Members of the two clubs generally valued their motorcycles more than women, who were often seen as property that could be traded or beaten easily.  \nAt a certain point and after many drinks, one of the Drifters’ girlfriends and Margaret started fighting and had to be separated.  After that Apfel sensed that he and Margaret were no longer welcome, so they decided to leave the bar. It was almost closing time, so the other patrons began to leave. \nBut outside an angry Margaret, fueled by alcohol, confronted Apfel, pulled his hair and slapped him in the face. Furious, Apfel threw her to the ground, kicking her repeatedly with his steel pointed boots in the head and body.  Then he pushed her towards three members of the D.C. Eagles, and said: “Here, you guys can have her.” He  got in his car and drove away.\nThe three D.C. Eagles —  Randolph “Gargoyle” Whiting, Denice “Bobber” Stumpner and Mark “A.D.” Hinton — began beating and kicking her. Mark Lukensmeyer,  the owner of the Back Forty, watched the scene from the doorway.  Chris Shavlik, the bartender, tried to make the men stop, but  there was nothing she could do. She got into her car and left. Now Lukensmeyer joined the other three men spanking Margaret.\nThen the four took Margaret again inside the bar. During the next two hours, they subjected her to severe beatings and sexual abuse, snapping in half a cue stick,  and pulled a cue ball into her vagina.  Margaret attempted to fight back. At one point she cut Stumpner with a knife, but  it only resulted in more beatings.\nEventually, they left the bar and took Margaret with them. They pushed her into the back seat of the Lukensmeyer’s Grand Torino, and drove to the Packerland Meat Packing Plant, and parked in the rear of the  company’s manure clean-out area. Whiting exited the vehicle, pulling Margaret out by her hair. He dragged her  through the snow. Then Whiting pulled out his buck knife and slit Margaret’s throat. She was left to die in the cold night. Blood was coming out \"like a fountain of water\" from the neck cut.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nDauplaise, Mike (2009).

        "revision_id": 1220990053,
        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "The Siege of Battleford was a siege during the North-West Rebellion which lasted from 28 March 1885 to 26 May 1885.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAfter the Métis victory at the Battle of Duck Lake on March 26, 1885. Cree bands who were sympathetic to the Métis cause and with grievances of their own began raiding stores and farms in the western part of the District of Saskatchewan for arms, ammunition and food supplies. The raids caused civilians to flee to the larger settlements and forts of the North-West Territories.\n\n\n== Beginning of the siege ==\nOn 28 March 1885, news arrived that Indian bands commanded Poundmaker were on their way to Battleford. 500 civilians began moving into the nearby North-West Mounted Police post, Fort Battleford for protection against the Cree raids. Fort Battleford was under the command of Colonel William Morris and had a small garrison of 25 police. During the night of March 29 nearby homesteads were raided their horses and cattle rounded up by the Cree. On March 30, Poundmaker asked for a meeting with the Indian agent J. M. Rae. After Rae refused to meet with him, the Cree raided food and supplies from abandoned stores and houses. The next day, the Cree camped a few miles away bringing with them their looted provisions including cattle and horses then eventually returned to Poundmaker's reserve. The New Town was protected due to its proximity to the Fort and its cannon. However, the Old Town was not. The occupants of the Fort could only watch as the Old Town, about a mile away, was plundered, looted and burned. Stolen vehicles and horses carried away the supplies of the Hudson's Bay Company and the other merchants. All the public buildings were sacked, including the Battleford Industrial School. On 21 April 1885, Francis Dickens and his men safety reached Battleford after the Battle of Fort Pitt.\n\n\n== Lifting the siege ==\nGeneral Middleton's original plan was simple. He planned to march all his troops north from the railhead at Qu’Appelle to the Riel's capital in Batoche. However, the killings at Frog Lake and the siege of Battleford forced him to change his plan. He sent a large group under Lieutenant-Colonel William Otter north from a second railhead at Swift Current to relieve Battleford and lift the siege. On 1 May, Colonel Otter moved west from Battleford with 300 men. In the early morning of the next day on 2 May, he was confronted by the Cree and Assiniboine force just west of Cut Knife Creek, 40 km from Battleford which would result in the Battle of Cut Knife. The Indigenous force had enormous advantages of terrain, virtually surrounding Otter's troops on an inclined, triangular plain. Cree war chief Fine Day deployed his soldiers successfully in wooded ravines. After about six hours of fighting, Otter retreated. Casualties would have been very high as the militia re-crossed the creek, had not Chief Poundmaker persuaded the Indigenous warriors not to pursue the government troops. Otter's force suffered 8 dead and 14 wounded while Poundmaker's force only suffered 5-6 killed and 3 wounded.\nThe defeat at Cut Knife delayed the lifting of the siege and delayed Middleton's assault on Batoche. After the defeat of the Métis force at the Battle of Batoche and the surrender of Louis Riel to Middleton on May 15. Poundmaker surrendered to General Middleton at Fort Battleford on May 26, 1885.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nCasualties on both sides were relatively light. 3 militiamen, 7 Cree and 2-6 civilians were killed over the course of the siege. Most homes were burned, including the home of Judge Charles Rouleau. Just half a dozen buildings were left standing by the end of the siege.\n\n\n== Debate ==\nLike the rest of the North-West Rebellion, the Siege of Battleford has remained a source of debate among historians. Historian Douglas Hill characterized the Cree in his book, The Opening of the Canadian West, as a \"war party ... ready to take revenge for a winter of incalculable suffering\" who \"swooped on Battleford, killing six whites\". Canadian historian George Stanley writing on the event indicated that the Cree were not murderous but more haphazard and bumbling stating \"they did not appear to have in mind an attack upon the town but were content with prowling around the neighbourhood\". In October 2010, Parks Canada stated that they stop using the word \"siege\" in its posters and programming to describe the \"sometimes violent, sometimes tragic events at the frontier community during the Northwest Rebellion.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Byala reka (Bulgarian: Бяла река) is a river in southern Bulgaria, a left tributary of the river Stryama of the Maritsa drainage, with a length of 37 km. Its upper course falls within the Dzhendema nature reserve of the Central Balkan National Park.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe Byala reka takes its source at an altitude of 2,048 m in the Kalofer division of the Balkan Mountains, at the western foothills of the summit of Botev (2,376 m), the highest in the mountain range. It flows initially south and then southeast in a steep valley, which along with its tributaries the Dzhendemska reka and the Praskalska reka form the deep impenetrable valley of Southern Dzhendem. After it receives the waters of the Dzhendemska reka, its flow increases significantly. Downstream of the confluence with the Bazovitsa the terrain becomes less undulated and the river again turns southwards.\nNorth of the town of Kalofer in a small valley extension is located the Kalofer Monastery. Less that a kilometer west of Kalofer, the Byala reka turns west and at the village of Kurtovo enters the Karlovo Valley. There the river bends to the southwest and flows in to the Stryama at an altitude of 268 m upstream of the Stryama Gorge.\nIts drainage basin covers a territory of 239 km2 or 17.1% of the Stryama's total. The river a number of tributaries, mostly flowing from the Balkan Mountains, such as the Dzhendemska reka and the Praskalska reka. Its largest tributary the Svezhenska reka (26 km) takes its source from Sredna Gora.\nThe Byala reka has predominantly snow–rain feed with high water in March–June and low water in July–October. The average annual flow is at the village of Kurtovo is 1.58 m3/s.\n\n\n== Settlements and tourism ==\nThe river flows entirely in Karlovo Municipality of Plovdiv Province. There are four villages along its course, Kurtovo, Verdare, Beguntsi and Prolom. Its waters are utilised for irrigation and industrial supple in the Karlovo Valley. A 3.3 km stretch of the first class I-6 road Gyueshevo–Sofia–Karlovo–Burgas follows its valley west of Kalofer.\nThe upper valley of Byala reka and its tributaries is known for its pristine nature and offers favourable conditions for tourism and family recreation. There are dozens of waterfalls along the river and some of its tributaries, the most notable being the Raysko Praskalo, which at 124.5 m is the highest permanent waterfall in Bulgaria and the Balkan Peninsula. The 1.83 km eco-trail “Byala reka” beginning at the Kalofer Monastery winds around part of its course.\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== References ==\nМичев (Michev), Николай (Nikolay); Михайлов (Mihaylov), Цветко (Tsvetko); Вапцаров (Vaptsarov), Иван (Ivan); Кираджиев (Kiradzhiev), Светлин (Svetlin) (1980).

        "content": "SNR G054.1+00.3, also called G54.1+0.3, 2E 4258 and 2E 1928.3+1846 is a supernova remnant located in the constellation Sagittarius. It was identified as a supernova remnant in a study of the galactic plane in the radio continuum at wavelengths of 21 and 11 cm.\n\n\n== Morphology ==\nSNR G054.1+00.3 is identified as a supernova remnant by its non-thermal radio emission with strong linear polarization. It has a small angular radius (1.5 arcminutes) in radio and X-ray images. Its X-ray emission has been detected with the Einstein, ASCA, ROSAT and Chandra telescopes. In this region of the electromagnetic spectrum it presents different structures that include a ring, an outer nebula and a pulsar, called PSR J1930+1852. The period of this pulsar is 136 ms and it emits very high energy gamma rays. There is a nebula caused by the stellar wind coming from it (PWN). \nCO observations show that there is no interaction between SNR G054.1+00.3 and the surrounding clouds and that it instead appears to be located within a bubble. Likewise, in a study carried out in the infrared region at 21 μm, features similar to those observed in Cassiopeia A appear, probably attributable to SiO2 grains. Recently formed cold dust (with a temperature of only 27 - 44 K) has also been detected.\nVarious models that consider the amount of dust and its composition suggest that the progenitor star was part of a massive star cluster and had a mass of 15 - 20 solar masses or 16 - 27 solar masses.\n\n\n== Distance ==\nSNR G054.1+00.3 is a young supernova remnant. According to various studies, it has an age between 2100 and 3600 years, between 1500 and 3000 years, or 1700 years. On the other hand, the distance at which it is located is not well known either. Various works place this supernova remnant at a distance between 5,000 and 10,000 parsecs; a commonly accepted value is 6200 (+3800, -1200) parsecs.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of supernova remnants\nLists of astronomical objects\n\n\n== References ==",

        "revision_id": 1220920220,
        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Robert A. Royer was an American competitive swimmer for Indiana University in the 1920's and later served as Head Coach of their swim team from 1931 to 1957, leading them to a fourth place finish in the NCAA Championship in 1957, and a third place in the competitive Big 10 Conference in 1956. He coached Indiana University's first NCAA swimming champion, Bill Woolsey, and their first two Olympic swimmers, Woolsey, and Sonny Tanabe who competed in 1956.  \n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nRoyer was born to Reuben and Nerla A. Hoffman Royer in a log cabin in Akron, Indiana on September 22, 1902. He swam for Indiana University from around 1924-1928 under Coach Paul Thompson, and received a Varsity letter, graduating in 1928 with an A.B. in English.  In competition at Indiana, Royer was a consistent winner in the backstroke, and had beaten backstroke competitors from University of Chicago, University of Illinois, and Perdue.\nAt 33, Royer married his wife Catherine Edwards, 21, an Indiana native, on Sunday, August 17, 1936 at the home of Catherine's parents in Windfall, Indiana. At Indiana, Catherine served as the alumni advisor to Theta Sigma Phi, the national professional journalistic society for women.\n\n\n== Coaching Indiana ==\nAfter teaching and serving as an Assistant Principal at Akron High School in his hometown of Akron, Indiana for three years, he began coaching the University of Indiana in 1931 and continued through 1957 when his coaching years ended following an eight month illness after a surgery.  \nRoyer was responsible for bringing the Indiana swim team to national recognition, through achieving top five finishes in national and major regional championships and helping to produce two U.S. Olympic swimmers. Bringing greater national attention to the team at the end of his coaching tenure, he brought Indiana to a sixth-place finish in the 1956 NCAA Championships, and then a fourth-place finish in the NCAA swimming Championship in 1957 at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, behind swimming powers University of Michigan, coached by Gus Stager, and Yale.  \nIn 1956 he led Indiana to a Big 10 Conference finish of a third-place tie. The team had a fourth place finish at the Big 10 swimming Championships in Minneapolis in March 1957, with Head Coach Macaffree's Michigan State Spartans taking first. Royer coached the swim team continuously except for two seasons when he performed administrative duties for the University.  One of Royer's greatest achievements was briefly mentoring Assistant Coach Doc Counsilman, and recruiting and training a talented team that had steadily improved in the years before Cousilman assumed head coaching status.\nOn May 15, 1948, Royer taught a Water Safety Institute Seminar sponsored by the American Red Cross to teachers of swimming and life saving at Butler University in Indianapolis in conjunction with the Coaches of Perdue and the Rivera Swim Club.  He would conduct and attend other swimming institutes during his time as a coach.  On the evening of January 11, 1954, sharing tips on his second career, he gave a lecture on free lance writing for magazines at Aterbury Center as part of their cultural lecture series.\n\n\n=== Outstanding swimmers ===\n\nOutstanding swimmers, though they came at the end of Royer's tenure, included Bill Woolsey, Richard \"Sonny\" Tanabe of Hawaii, and Frank McKinney Jr. who were all members of the U.S. 1956 Olympic team.  Woolsey and McKinney were both Olympic medalists.   Woolsey was Indiana's first NCAA champion, receiving the honor twice.  He won a total of four AAU titles and was a recipient of All-American honors on eight occasions.  As an Indiana junior in 1956, he won Big Ten titles in the 220-, 440- and 1,650-yard freestyles and NCAA titles in the 220 and 440.  Woolsey was the first Olympic swimmer from Indiana University. He swam for the U.S. at the 1952 Helsinki Summer Olympics, capturing a gold medal in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay.  His relay team consisted of Wayne Moore, Ford Konno, and James McLane.    At the 1952 games, Woolsey competed in the 1500-meter freestyle. At the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, after receiving coaching from Indiana Coaches Royer and Assistant Coach Counselman, Woolsey won a silver medal swimming the 800-meter freestyle relay.  Ron Honda was another outstanding swimmer from Hawaii for Royer's Indiana team.  \nRoyer's swimmer Sonny Tanabe, another outstanding Hawaiian, was on the Silver medal 4x100 meter freestyle relay team in the 1956 Olympics, but did not medal, as he did not swim in the finals.\n\nRoyer's Fall 1957 Freshman recruits included Frank McKinney Jr., with near world record times in the 200-meter backstroke, one of Royer's former strokes. At 18, prior to swimming for Indiana, McKinney won a bronze medal in the 1956 Olympics in the 100-meter backstroke, and a silver in the 100-meter backstroke in the 1960 Olympics, as well as taking a gold medal in the 4x100-meter relay.  Royer was unable to provide  multiple years of coaching to McKinney due to his illness, but likely was involved in recruiting him.   McKinney, who was coached primarily by Doc Counsilman as an Upperclassman at Indiana won titles with the American Athletic Union and took two NCAA championships for Indiana. In 1959 he twice set a world record for the 200-meter backstroke, and in 1960 he was a member, on two occasions, of teams which posted new world records in the medley relay.\nRoyer also served as Men's Assistant Dean at Indiana during his tenure with the University.  He wrote as a hobby and submitted many articles to wide-selling magazines.  He resided on a farm near Bloomington.\n\n\n=== Work in the swimming community ===\nRoyer served as Chair of the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Rules Committee.  He had served as an advisor to the 1956 U.S. Olympic team.  In 1955, as an NCAA Rules Chairman, he was partly responsible for maintaining the ability of college swimmers to serve as lifeguards and playground attendants while maintaining amateur athletic status, however working independently as swim instructors would not be permitted.  He served as a top official and starter with University of Michigan swimming Coach Charles McCaffree, Jr. at the annual YMCA Swimming and Diving Championships in Richmond, Indiana, in April 1957.\nHe died at 55 at his home in the Bloomington area on December 6, 1957. He had married the former Catherine Margarette Edwards in 1936.  Catherine had served as a secretary to University President Herman Wells for ten years.  Royer had been ill since an operation around eight months prior to his death.  The couple had a young daughter.  A funeral was held on December 9, and Royer was buried in Valhalla Gardens in Bloomington, Indiana.\nThe Robert Royer Pool on 7th Street in Bloomington was dedicated to Royer in his honor by the University's Board of Trustrees.  Built around 1960, the pool is housed in the School of Public Health and is used recreationally by students and faculty, though it was once used for competition as it has a viewing area with a 500 person seating capacity.  In March, 1962, the pool hosted the Big Ten Championship, and was officially dedicated by President Herman Wells, Indiana's Athletic Director Bill Orwig, and other speakers during the weekend of the event.   It is a six-lane pool, 75-yards in length, with a separate diving well, and features many photos of Indiana swimming teams.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nIU Honors and Awards, Bill Woolsey\nOlympedia Olympic Biography, Bill Woolsey",

        "content": "Luck and Strange is the upcoming fifth studio album by the English songwriter and guitarist David Gilmour, set for release on 6 September 2024.\n\n\n== Recording ==\nOn 24 April 2024, David Gilmour announced the upcoming release on September 6 (through Sony Music) of Luck and Strange, his first album of new material in nine years. It was recorded over five months in Brighton and London with the producer Charlie Andrew. Gilmour said Andrew challenged him musically and \"has a wonderful lack of knowledge or respect for this past of mine\" thus he didn't defer to him, which he loved. Gilmour's wife, the writer Polly Samson, wrote the majority of the lyrics, which she said reflected themes of mortality and ageing.\nMusicians contributing to the record include Guy Pratt and Tom Herbert on bass, Adam Betts, Steve Gadd and Steve DiStanislao on drums, Rob Gentry and Roger Eno on keyboards, with string and choral arrangements by Will Gardner. The album also features keyboard recordings from Gilmour's former Pink Floyd bandmate, Richard Wright, in 2007 from the barn jam sessions. It will also include lyrics from Gilmour's son Charlie, and harp and vocals from his daughter Romany.\nThe cover was photographed and designed by Anton Corbijn.\n\n\n== Credits ==\nProduced by David Gilmour and Charlie Andrew.\nEngineered by Matt Glasbey, Charlie Andrew, David Gilmour and Damon Iddins.\nMixed by David Gilmour, Charlie Andrew and Matt Glasbey.\nAdditional engineering by Andy Jackson and Luie Stylianou.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nFrom what's seen in \"The Piper's Call\" music video, the personnel for the song is as followed:\n\nDavid Gilmour – lead vocals, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, classical guitar, lap steel guitar, ukulele\nRob Gentry – keyboards\nGuy Pratt – bass guitar\nSteve Gadd – drums, percussion\nRomany Gilmour – harmony vocals\nWill Gardner – choral arrangements, string arrangements\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Antonio Fernández Rivadulla (born 29 January 1978), known as Antonio Fernández, is a Spanish retired footballer who played as a central midfielder, and currently is the manager of Real Balompédica Linense.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\nKnown as just Antonio during his playing days, he was born in Ourense, Galicia, and made his senior debut with Tercera División side Villalonga FC at the age of 17. In 1996, he was transferred to Deportivo de La Coruña for an undisclosed sum plus a friendly match, and returned to youth football.\nAntonio featured mainly in the fourth tier during his entire career; aside from a one-year spell in Segunda División B with CD Lalín in the 1998–99 season, he played for USD O Grove, UD Xove Lago, CP Villarrobledo, Granada CF, Torredonjimeno CF, Granada Atlético CF, CD Guadalajara, Portonovo SD, Motril CF, CD Ourense, Pontevedra CF, Céltiga FC and CD Boiro.\nOn 29 August 2013, Antonio returned to his first club Villalonga, now in the Preferente Autonómica. He officially retired on 11 December 2014, aged 36, after being appointed manager of the club.\n\n\n== Coaching career ==\nOn 3 December 2014, whilst playing for Villalonga, Fernández was named as interim manager following the sacking of Óscar García; eight days later, he was permanently appointed manager, and subsequently retired from playing. He achieved promotion to the fourth division in 2016, and on 30 May 2017, after leading Villalonga to an 8th-place finish, he left to become manager of fellow league team Alondras CF.\nOn 20 June 2019, after leading Alondras to two consecutive play-off qualifications, albeit without promotion to the Segunda División B on both occasions, Fernández left the club. On 27 October, he was named in charge of CD San Roque de Lepe also in the fourth tier. \nFerández led San Roque to promotion during the 2020–21 campaign, and left the club on 6 July 2022, after a sixth-place finish in the season, to take over Primera Federación side Pontevedra. On 18 January 2023, however, he was sacked by Ponte after three losses in a row.\nOn 6 March 2024, after more than a year of inactivity, Fernández was appointed at the helm of Segunda Federación side Real Balompédica Linense on a contract until the end of the campaign; he replaced sacked Mere.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nFernández's father, also named Antonio, was also a footballer. A forward, he featured in one Segunda División match for Ourense, and also played for Pontevedra and Lalín.\n\n\n== Managerial statistics ==\nAs of 28 April 2024\n\n\n== Honours ==\n\n\n=== Manager ===\nVillalonga\n\nPreferente de Galicia: 2015–16\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAntonio Fernández at BDFutbol\nAntonio Fernández manager profile at BDFutbol",

The fourth film in his semi-autobiographical series after 1981, 1987 and 1991, the film stars Jean-Carl Boucher as Trogi, making his first foray into filmmaking as a contestant in the competition series La Course destination monde in 1995.\nThe cast also includes Sandrine Bisson, Francis-William Rhéaume, Rose Adam, Shadi Janho, Guillaume Gauthier, Claudio Colangelo, Olivier Aubin, Mickaël Gouin, Myriam Gaboury, Maude Bouchard, Marie-Josée Bastien and David Leblanc.\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe film's development was first announced in 2021, and shooting on the film began in fall 2023. \nTrogi stated that he considers the film to be the funniest in the series; he noted as well that while La Course was retitled in the film for copyright reasons, he kept the real names of key personalities who featured in the storyline, including host Pierre Therrien and judges Michel Coulombe, Louise Racicot and Manon Barbeau. \nHe has also stated that while there may be future films in the series, he is not currently certain of that, stating in particular that he doesn't see any comedy to be mined from his experiences directing his debut film Québec-Montréal.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe film's first promotional poster was revealed in February 2024, with the film slated to open on July 31.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n1995 at IMDb",

'Polar') is a Chinese icebreaking research vessel under construction for the State Oceanic Administration North Sea Branch.\nAs of 2024, Guangzhou Shipyard International is building a slightly bigger Polar Class 4 research vessel, Tan Suo San Hao, at the same time.\n\n\n== Design ==\nJi Di is 89 metres (292 ft) long overall and has a beam of 17.8 metres (58 ft) and draft of 5.9 metres (19 ft). The 5,600-tonne (5,500-long-ton) vessel has accommodation for 60 persons, operational range of 14,000 nautical miles (26,000 km; 16,000 mi), and can remain at sea for 80 days.\nJi Di has a diesel-electric propulsion system with four main diesel generators and two 3.2-megawatt (4,300 hp) ABB Azipod azimuth thrusters. The ship's speed in open water is 14 knots (26 km/h; 16 mph) and it can break 1-metre (3.3 ft) level ice at a speed of 1.5 to 2 knots (2.8 to 3.7 km/h; 1.7 to 2.3 mph).\nJi Di is built to Polar Class 6, an ice class intended for summer and autumn operation in medium first-year ice which may contain small inclusions of old sea ice that has survived at least one melting season without melting completely.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe ship's construction was awarded to Guangzhou Shipyard International, a subsidiary of the China State Shipbuilding Corporation, in March 2022 and the construction began shortly afterwards. It was floated out on 29 December 2023.\nJi Di, Chinese for \"polar\", is scheduled to enter service with the State Oceanic Administration North Sea Branch during the second half of 2024.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Cokefloat! is the debut album by Scottish band Paws. It was released on 8 October 2012 on FatCat Records.\n\n\n== Background and promotion ==\nIn 2010 and 2011, Paws released four EPs on cassette label Cath Records, which they owned and ran from the house they shared. Some songs from those EPs were re-recorded for Cokefloat!. Paws signed to FatCat in 2012 and released the EP Misled Youth in May of that year.\nSeveral tracks on Cokefloat! have lyrics about songwriter Phillip Jon Taylor's mother, who died of cancer when he was 21.\nThe single \"Sore Tummy\" was a playable track in the video game Rocksmith 2014.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nOn Metacritic the album holds a score of 66/100, based on 9 reviews, indicating a \"generally favorable\" reception. Ian Cohen of Pitchfork described \"Catherine 1956\" and \"Bloodline\" as \"frankly astonishing.\"\nSeveral reviewers noted a strong influence of 90s grunge on the album.\nWriting for BBC Music, Mike Haydock described the album as \"tuneful and energetic but a little unoriginal\" and drew comparisons to Sonic Youth, Dinosaur Jr. and The Lemonheads, as well as to contemporaries like Yuck. Pitchfork described the album as \"alternately thrilling and mildly embarrassing for being the sum of its 90s influences.\" \nJason Lymangrover of AllMusic wrote that the album \"references '90s guitar rockers like Dinosaur Jr. and Teenage Fanclub, and manages to channel the fun aspects of noisy slacker pop.\"\nThe album was shortlisted for the 2013 Scottish Album of the Year Award, losing to RM Hubbert's Thirteen Lost & Found.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nPaws\n\nPhillip Jon Taylor\nJosh Swinney\nMatthew Scott\nOther musicians\n\nPhillip Jon Taylor – lyrics on all tracks\nAlice Costelloe – vocals on \"Sore Tummy\"\nCatherine Helen Taylor – lyrics on \"Tulip\"\nTechnical\n\nRory Attwell – recording\nAlan Douches – mastering\nArtistic\nJessical Penfold – cover artwork\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Levantine Army was a unit of the Spanish Republican Army that operated during the Spanish Civil War. Under its jurisdiction were the Republican forces originally deployed on the Teruel front and, later, on the Levante front. It played an important role during the Battle of Teruel and during the Levante Offensive.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Levante Army was created on 19 August 1937 from the XIII and XIX Army Corps, which became part of it. Colonel Juan Hernández Saravia assumed command of the new formation.  The lines of the Levante Army went from Rillo to the Sierra de Calomarde and Frías de Albarracín, covering various sectors of the Teruel front.\nIn December 1937, the Levante Army was in charge of the Republican offensive in Teruel, which would manage to conquer the capital of Teruel after an intense fight. This earned Hernández Saravia the promotion to General. However, this initial victory would end up turning into defeat with the Nationalist  counteroffensive, which recovered the city of Teruel.\nStarting in April 1938, the Levantine Army had to face the Nationalist offensive on the Levante front, which sought to conquer Valencia. Also on that date the formation was assigned to the newly formed Central Region Army Group\n(GERC), under the supreme command of General José Miaja. In June 1938, the Levante Army absorbed the forces of the Maneuver Army. From that moment on, the unit had 5 Army Corps in line, and another in reserve. In addition, Colonel Leopoldo Menéndez López assumed command of the unit, replacing Juan Hernández Saravia.\nThe fighting on the Levante front was very intense between the months of April and July 1938. Castellón de la Plana fell into Franco's hands on 14 June, which left Franco's forces about 80 kilometers from Valencia.  At that time up to 6 Army Corps belonging to the Levantine Army were in line, protected by the defenses of the XYZ line. The fighting in Levante reached a climax between 18 and 23 July, during which the Nationalist attackers suffered numerous casualties. The Ebro offensive undertaken further north by the Army of the Ebro stopped all Nationalist attacks.\nAfter being overrun in the Final offensive of the Spanish Civil War, the Levantine Army dissolved itself at the end of March 1939, coinciding with the end of the war.\n\n\n== Leaders ==\n\n\n=== Commanders ===\nartillery colonel Juan Hernandez Saravia (24/8/1937 - 2/6/1938);\ninfantry colonel Leopoldo Menéndez López (2/6/1938 – 28/3/1939);\n\n\n=== Commissars ===\nThomas Mora Saenz, PSOE;\nFrancisco Ortega Jimenez, PCE;\nJose Ignatius Mantecon, IR;\n\n\n=== Chiefs of Staff ===\nLieutenant Colonel Eduardo Saenz de Aranaz;\nlieutenant colonel Federico de la Iglesia Navarro;\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nAlpert, Michael (2013).

        "content": "Yuriy Vasyliovych Badzyo (Ukrainian: Бадзьо Юрій Васильович) (25 April 1936 – 1 September 2018) was a Ukrainian literary critic, activist, and political prisoner.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nBadzyo was born into a peasant family of ten children in the village of Kopynivtsi, located in the Mukachevo Raion, Zakarpattia Oblast, Ukraine.\nIn 1958, Badzyo graduated from the Faculty of Ukrainian Language and Literature of the Uzhhorod National University, becoming a teacher of the Ukrainian language and literature before serving as a director of a school located in Mukachevo.\nIn 1961, he began studying for his PhD at the Taras Shevchenko Institute of Literature of the Academy of Sciences located in Kyiv. In 1964, he married Svitlana Kyrychenko, a fellow student at the institute whom he had met the previous year, and successfully defended his PhD, becoming an assistant researcher at the institute.\n\n\n== Dissident activity and imprisonment ==\nDuring his time in Kyiv, Badzyo became a member of the Klub tvorchoyi molodi or Club of Creative Youth, a cultural organisation founded during the Khrushchev Thaw that became a centre for dissident members of the Ukrainian intelligentsia, collectively known as the Shistdesyatnyky or \"Sixties\". Here, he came into contact and became friends with Vasyl Stus, a fellow student and dissident, among others. \nOn September 4 1965, Badzyo participated in a protest against the arrests of political activists in Ukraine alongside Ivan Dzyuba, Vyacheslav Chornovil, Stus, Kyrychenko, and others, at the premiere of Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors at a cinema in Kyiv. Badzyo is subsequently dismissed from his position at the institute, expelled from the Communist Party, and gradually deprived of the opportunity of further work in the academic field, taking up teaching, proofreading, and editorial work between periods of unemployment.\nIn 1971, Badzyo wrote a letter to the Sixth Congress of the Union of Soviet Writers of Ukraine in which he criticised the cultural policy of the government and argued that Ukrainian literature and culture held inferior positions in relation to their Russian counterparts.\nThe arrests of political dissidents close to Badzyo, including Dzyuba and Stus, as well as a KGB raid on his apartment, in 1972 prompted him to begin writing a treatise on the Soviet political system, historiography, Russification, and the subjugation of the Ukrainian nation, titled \"Pravo zhyty\", or \"The right to live\". The disappearance of the 1,400 page manuscript, encompassing four out of a planned five chapters in 1977 meant Badzyo, at this point working at a bakery, had to re-write the entirety of his work. He had completed 452 pages when authorities raided his apartment again in February 1979, seizing the second manuscript.\nNot long after the raid, Badzyo was arrested and sentenced to seven years at a labour camp and a further five years in exile for \"anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda\".\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Jorge Salvador Murrugarra Torres (born 22 March 1997) is a Peruvian footballer who plays as a midfielder for Peruvian Liga 1 club Universitario de Deportes.\n\n\n== Club career ==\nMurrugarra played in the youth ranks of Juventud Progreso, a team in the District League of Barranca in the Copa Perú, from 2012 to 2014. He then moved to Sporting Cristal, where he played the 2015 Torneo de Promoción y Reserva but was unable to make his professional debut.\nIn 2016, Murrugarra was signed by Deportivo Coopsol from the Peruvian Segunda División, making his professional debut with the team on 14 August 2016, in a 1–1 tie against Alianza Universidad. As a 19 year old, he played a total of 12 matches in his first professional season.\nMurrugarra was then signed by Universidad Técnica de Cajamarca, from the Torneo Descentralizado, for the 2017 season, making his debut with the team on 26 May 2017, coming from the bench in a 3–0 victory against Juan Aurich. From then on, Murrugarra became a starting player in UTC's midfield, finishing the year with a total of 25 matches. He was also considered the best new player in the team, which managed to qualify to the 2018 Copa Sudamericana first stage. The following season, Murrugarra remained an undisputed starter in UTC's midfield, next to Benjamín Ubierna, and played a total of 32 matches. In January 2019, he renewed his contract with the team for one more season, in which he once more played in the Copa Sudamericana first stage.\nIn December 2019, Murrugarra signed for Ayacucho FC with a contract for one season, on request by his former UTC manager Gerardo Ameli, making his debut on 7 February 2020, coming from the bench in a 2–1 victory against Sport Boys. That year, Murrugarra was part of Ayacucho's historic Fase 2 win, after defeating Sporting Cristal in the final, and played a total of 23 matches, giving 2 assists. His good performances throughout the season led to him catching the attention of the technical staff of Ángel Comizzo, manager of Universitario de Deportes.\nIn January 2021, Murrugarra was announced as a new signing of Universitario with a contract for one season and a half, in order to play both the Liga 1 and the Copa Libertadores.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nAyacucho FC\n2020 Fase 2\nUniversitario de Deportes\nPeruvian Primera División: 2023\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJorge Murrugarra at Soccerway",

        "content": "SNR G306.3-00.9, also called G306.3-0.9 is a supernova remnant located in the constellation Centaurus. It was discovered by the Swift Space Observatory in 2011.  \n\n\n== Morphology ==\nThe first observations carried out with the Chandra X-ray Observatory revealed that SNR G306.3-00.9 has a distorted morphology, brighter towards the southwest. The strong radio and X-ray emission from this area suggests either that there is interaction with an interstellar cloud or that it is the consequence of an asymmetric supernova explosion. Emission from highly ionized atoms of magnesium, silicon, sulfur and argon, and suggests that it is the remnant of a type Ia supernova. Such a spectrum can be described by a non-equilibrium ionization plasma with a temperature below 1 keV. In infrared images at 24 μm, the morphology of the dust grains impacted by the shock wave is shell-shaped, coinciding with the distribution observed in hard X-rays. At 70 μm the dust emission is concentrated in the south, with very little dust in the northwest.\n\n\n== Distance ==\nThe age of SNR G306.3-00.9 is not well known. It was initially estimated that it could be approximately 2,500 years old—a very young supernova remnant—considering that it was 8,000 parsecs away. A later study, which compares the X-ray absorption column with the distribution of H I decomposed along the line of sight, gives it a distance of around 20,000 parsecs, so its age may be 6000 years and evolutionarily it would be in the late Sedov phase. According to this, the most probable location of SNR G306.3-00.9 is in the outer extension of the Perseus arm. However, according to other models, its age could be considerably older, 12,800 (+2500, − 2500) years.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of supernova remnants\n2011 in science\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Hilda Hope McMaugh (11 March 1891 – 30 March 1981) was a nurse and the first Australian woman to qualify as a pilot, receiving her certificate from the Royal Aero Club in England on 15 November 1919. \nAfter completing her nursing training at Tamworth District Hospital, McMaugh enlisted with the Australian Army Nursing Service (AANS) in 1916. The following year she was posted to Cairo with the Australian Imperial Force (AIF). For her services during the war she received the British War Medal and the Victory Medal.\nAfter Armistice McMaugh went to London, where she earned a driving licence from Britain's Royal Automobile Club, and then after one month's training in a Centaur IV aircraft at Northolt Aerodrome, she gained a pilot's licence.\nIn 1920 McMaugh returned to her home town Uralla, in New South Wales. There, three years later, she established St Elmo’s Private Hospital, where she ran the place as its matron for near 30 years. Her name is one of 850 inscribed on a memorial in Central Park, Armidale. A retirement home, the McMaugh Gardens Retirement Home, is named after her.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHilda McMaugh was born Caroline Hilda Hope on 11 March 1885 at Kempsey, in New South Wales, Australia, the youngest of two daughters of George McMaugh and his wife Clementina Sarah (Daisy) née Ker. At home she was affectionately known as Cissy.\nAfter completing her nursing training at Tamworth District Hospital, McMaugh enlisted with the AANS on 26 August 1916. She served first at the Army hospital in Sydney, and the following year was posted to Cairo with the AIF. She left Australia on 21 March 1917 on the TSS Kanowna to serve at the 14th Australian General Hospital in Abbassia. After Armistice, she visted Jerusalem, Belgium, and France. For her services during the War she received the British War Medal and the Victory Medal.\n\n\n== Life in England ==\nIn 1919, McMaugh was posted to England, where she took driving lessons, and received a licence from Britain's Royal Automobile Club. She also took flying lessons in a Centaur IV aircraft at the Central Aircraft Company's base at Northolt Aerodrome. On 15 November 1919, one month into flight training, McMaugh became the first Australian woman to qualify as a pilot, receiving her certificate, No. 7818, from the Royal Aero Club in England. That day, one newspaper described weather conditions as \"wild nasty day\", the test taking five hours, and she \"didn't care a rap for the weather, and descended a winner in the midst of a shower of congratulatory cheers from her fellow-students — all men except her.\" On 16 November 1919, the Sunday Times reported:\n\nMiss McMaugh, an Australian lady, after only a month's training, successfully passed her tests yesterday and received the Royal Aero Club's Pilot Certificate. She flew a Centaur 4 machine.\nAt the time she was reported to claim that she found flying aircraft easier than driving a car, explaining that \"there are no bobbies and no crowds up there\". Newspapers reported that she could loop-the-loop, and that during the final test she \"felt like a bird\". She described herself as having  \"mastered the levers\".\n\n\n== Later life ==\nMcMaugh returned to Australia on 12 January 1920. Her appointment with the Australian Army Nursing Service ended on 16 March 1920. Women were not permitted to hold a pilot's licence in Australia, and McMaugh was not allowed to fly there. In 1923, back in her home town Uralla, New South Wales, she bought an old school building and in it established a private hospital, St Elmo's. That year, it was opened by General Cox, who had known McMaugh from army service.\nIn later years she financed a pool for the hospital, built by local men who had lost income as a result of the Great Depression. She may have received money from a bet on Old Rowley, a racehorse who won the Melbourne Cup. She retired in 1950, having run the hospital as its matron for near 30 years. The hospital was sold to W. L. Colen and Ted Spensley, and converted into a hotel, before later being turned into residential property.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nMcMaugh died in Uralla on 30 March 1981. Her name is one of 850 inscribed on the Armidale Memorial Fountain, in Central Park, Armidale. A retirement home, the McMaugh Gardens Retirement Home, is named after her.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Nurse becomes a pilot\". British Pathé. Retrieved 24 April 2024.",

        "content": "Mary McKay Scott (pen name, Yarrow; 1851–1932) was a Canadian temperance reformer as well as the proprietor, publisher, and editor of a woman's journal. She also wrote travel articles and short stories. She held memberships in several organizations, serving in leadership roles in some of them.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nMary McKay Scott was born in Ottawa, Canada, then called Bytown, August 17, 1851. Her father was Alexander Scott, a businessman and alderman for Wellington Ward. Her mother was Alison McKay, a niece of Thomas McKay of Rideau Hall. A brother, William, served as president of the Ottawa Board of Trade, which another brother, George, was connected with the Ottawa Electric Company. Her mother's family were among the pioneers of the Ottawa.\nScott's schooling occurred at the Ottawa Private School, and at Bute House, Montreal. Abbie M. Harmon, of Ottawa, and Annie M. Mcintosh, of Montreal were two of her teachers. While a schoolgirl in Montreal, she attended the revival services of Lord Cecil, and that changed the course of her life.\n\n\n== Career ==\nFor more than 24 years, Scott worked as a civil servant, including for the Ministry of home affairs\nIn 1882, she joined the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU). She heard Frances Willard in Boston, in 1877, for the first time, but did not listen very attentively, as a woman speaking on the temperance question on a public platform was not at all to her liking. She attended the annual meeting of the Ottawa WCTU, when Sir Samuel Leonard Tilley presided as chairman. She was struck with the earnestness of the women, the reasonableness of the cause and the evident Christian spirit, and that day, she joined the organization. She was immediately put on a committee, and she filled many offices, especially in connection with the work of young women. These office included Dominion Superintendent, Young Woman's WCTU; custodian, Dominion WCTU's Literature Depository; and WCTU press superintendent. She became an earnest advocate for the prohibition of the liquor traffic.\nThe first official organ of the Dominion WCTU was the Woman's Journal, a monthly publication started in 1884 by Addie Chisholm, and adopted in 1889 by the Dominion WCTU under Scott's management. From the beginning, urgent need was felt for distinctly Canadian temperance publications. For nine years thereafter, Scott was the editor, publisher, and proprietor of the Woman's Journal, published monthly.\nHer literary work was confined to stories and descriptions of travel for Canadian papers. Having spent her summers for more than three decades at Yarrow Cottage in Chelsea, Quebec, she wrote much about Chelsea and the Gatineau district in The Citizen and other publications.\nScott served as president of the Ottawa Girl Guides and Interim Secretary of the National Council of Women of Canada. She was president of the YWCA, being a life member of the latter's board; she attended the YWCA's World Conference in Berlin in 1910. Scott was founder and  president of the Ottawa branch, Canadian Women's Press Club. She was also a member of the Ottawa Field-Naturalists' Club.\nScott taught at the Kitchen Garden on the kindergarten plan. For 30 years, she worked as a Sunday school teacher at St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church. She was engaged in other church work as well. Later, she joined the Chalmers United Church.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nShe made her home in Ottawa, where she died October 24, 1932. Interment was at that city's Beechwood Cemetery.\nSome of Scott's writings are held in the Women's Canadian Historical Society of Ottawa (WCHSO) collections by the Historical Society of Ottawa.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Works related to Woman of the Century/Mary Scott at Wikisource",

        "content": "Bogdan (Bulgarian: Богдан) is a small managed reserve in the central parts of the Sredna Gora mountain range of central Bulgaria. Administratively it falls in Koprivshtitsa Municipality of Sofia Province, with a very small area extending to the neighbouring Karlovo Municipality of Plovdiv Province. The nearest towns are Koprivshtitsa and Klisura.\n\n\n== Statute and geography ==\n\nBogdan was declared a nature reserve on 29 March 1972 to protect an old-growth beech forest and recategorized as a managed reserve in 1999. It spans an area of 113 ha or 1.13 km2. In addition there is a buffer zone of 121 ha. Its territory is state-owned.\nThe reserve is situated in the highest parts of the Sredna Gora mountain range and includes its highest point, the summit of Golyam Bogdan (1,604 m), after which it is named. The lowest point within its territory is 1,360 m, accounting for a denivelation of 244 m. The average altitude is 1,482 m. There are not permanent rivers within the limited territory of Bogdan but the river Topolnitsa just southwest of the reserve and its right stem the Kriva spring in its vicinity on the northern slopes. On the southern slopes flow small streams forming one of the main stems of the river Luda Yana, while on the northeastern slopes several small streams belong to the Stryama basin. The soils are Cambisols.\nThe ecosystems of the reserve are relatively homogeneous and the predominant biotope are the European beech (Fagus sylvatica) forests some 140–170 years old on average. Meadows form the only other biotope, covered a limited area of 4.6 ha.\n\n\n== Flora ==\nThere are 286 species of vascular plants, as well as 32 species of moss. There are two Balkan endemic species, Pastinaca hirsuta and Campanula sparsa, as well as one included in the Red Book of Bulgaria, Elwes's snowdrop (Galanthus elwesii). There are a number of orchids, such as white helleborine (Cephalanthera damasonium), narrow-leaved helleborine (Cephalanthera longifolia), elder-flowered orchid (Dactylorhiza sambucina), fragrant orchid (Gymnadenia conopsea), bird's-nest orchid (Neottia nidus-avis), green-winged orchid (Anacamptis morio), lesser butterfly-orchid (Platanthera bifolia). Other species of conservational importance include Geum rhodopeum, Hesperis sylvestris and round-leaved sundew (Drosera rotundifolia).\n\n\n== Fauna ==\nThe number of recorded mammal species is 31, of them 10 large mammals, 12 small mammals and 9 bats. They include European pine marten, beech marten, red fox, European wildcat, wild boar, etc. Brown bears and gray wolfs have been registered in Bogdan but do not inhabit it permanently. Bats of conservational importance are lesser noctule, western barbastelle and Bechstein's bat.\nThe ornithofauna includes 88 nesting species in the reserve's limited territory. Six taxa are included in the Red Book of Bulgaria, lesser spotted eagle, eastern imperial eagle, saker falcon, hazel grouse, white-backed woodpecker and horned lark. The herpetofauna is also varied and includes ten amphibian and six reptile species. The former include fire salamander, alpine newt, yellow-bellied toad and common frog.\nThe invertebrate fauna is poorly researched and understood.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== References ==\nManagement Plan of Bogdan Managed Reserve (План за управление на поддържан резерват „Богдан“) (in Bulgarian).

It is a sequel to the Owens' 1984 book Cry of the Kalahari, beginning with their move from Botswana to Zambia.\n\n\n== Plot summary ==\nThe Eye of the Elephant follows Delia and Mark Owens as they embark on a mission to protect wildlife and preserve natural habitats in the Luangwa Valley of Zambia. The couple establishes a wildlife reserve and works to combat the poaching of endangered species, particularly elephants.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe New York Times called the book \"not merely brazenly but maladroitly ideological\" in its promotion of the Owens Foundation for Wildlife Conservation and its paternalistic attitude toward anti-poaching efforts. Kirkus Reviews concludes that the book's narrative presents \"[a]nother seemingly clear-cut victory for the tireless defenders of wildlife, who tell a lively tale tinged with that smugness typical of Western conservationists who expect the impossible of poor Africa.\" The anti-poaching non-profit Poaching Facts described the book as \"suspenseful and designed to impress upon the reader the struggles ... that portions of Africa continue to deal with in the face of poverty, apathy to change, systemic corruption at all levels, and coexisting with wildlife in a place that has been forsaken by globalism.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

She has an MA and a PhD in creative writing from Queen's University Belfast. \n\n\n== Writing ==\nKennedy's early short stories appeared in publications including The Stinging Fly, The Tangerine, Banshee, Wasafiri and Ambit. She was shortlisted for the 2019 and 2020 Sunday Times Audible Short Story Awards, for \"In Silhouette\" and \"Sparing the Heather\" respectively.\nKennedy's first novel, Trespasses (2022), was shortlisted for the 2022 (inaugural)  Waterstones Debut Fiction Prize, and for the 2023 Women's Prize for Fiction. Kennedy has said that it is \"a star-crossed love story set in a small town near Belfast in 1975, at the height of the time known as The Troubles\".\nShe published a book of short stories, The End of the World is a Cul de Sac, in 2023. They were described by Kirkus Reviews as \"set in a contemporary Ireland divided by wealth and education\". The Guardian's reviewer called it a \"dazzling, heartbreaking debut collection\", and the New York Journal of Books wrote of \"deep-probing, slice-of-life stories seamlessly woven in stark vignettes without a filter\".\nShe has also written for The Guardian, The Irish Times, and BBC Radio 4.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nKennedy lives in Sligo.\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\nKennedy, Louise (2023).

It is relatively close to Earth, allowing astronomers to observe and study the remnant. It lies a short distance from NGC 1850. The exact type of supernova that produced N103B is under speculation, but has been widely accepted to be a Type Ia supernova. It is within the boundaries of the constellation Mensa.\n\n\n== Morphology ==\nThe orange-red filaments visible in the image show the shock fronts of the initial supernova explosion. These filaments have allowed astronomers to calculate the original barycenter of the explosion. The filaments also show that the explosion is no longer expanding as a sphere, but is elliptical in shape. Astronomers assume that part of material ejected by the explosion interacting with an extremely dense cloud of interstellar material, which slowed its speed. N103B is theorized to be interacting with dense circumstellar matter.\nA double-ring structure is visible within N103B, implying that it expands into an hourglass-shaped cavity and forms bipolar bubbles.\n\n\n== Supernova ==\nUsing the Chandra Telescope, astronomers observed N103B to figure out the initial supernova type. Due to the type of material and the amount of specific materials within N103B, astronomers were able to support the widely accepted belief that it was formed from a Type Ia supernova.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of supernova remnants\nList of supernovae\n\n\n== External links ==\nN103B at NED\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"Ti amo non lo so dire\" is a song by Italian singer Noemi. It was released on 2 February 2022 through Columbia Records and Sony Music Italy.\nThe song competed in the 72th Sanremo Music Festival, Italy's musical festival which doubles also as a selection of the act for Eurovision Song Contest, where it placed 15th in the grand final. The song peaked at numer eleven on the FIMI Single Chart and was certified platinum by FIMI.\n\n\n== Background and composition ==\nThe song, written by Mahmood, Alessandro La Cava, Dardust and produced by Dardust. In an interview with Billboard Italia, Noemi described the song and its meaning:\"The song is a metaphor to say that overcoming our frailties takes a lot of courage; [...] It is to explain a new way of experiencing emotions. When you go through a period of change, you have to retake measures with emotions, with people, with what happens to you. Life is like that: you have to learn to say \"I love you\" in the right way and with the right courage. [...] These are phrases that have to be said with energy, to say that you are not afraid, that you throw yourself into life, it takes the energy of that synth. It's like the heartbeat of someone running. [...] Mahmood wrote a lyric with great sensitivity, I am very happy with the result. It is very poetic, true, honest, a fundamental thing in lyrics.\"The song marked Noemi second consecutive participation  at the Sanremo Music Festival after 2021 song \"Glicine\" and her seventh overall.\n\n\n== Critics reception ==\nIl Messaggero described the song as \"a metaphor to be able to explain this fragility. \"Ti amo non lo so dire\" takes immense courage. To tell this dichotomy, I chose an uptempo piece with important lyrics that well represents the energy and balance between mind and body needed to deal with it.\" Francesco Chignola of TV Sorrisi e Canzoni wrote that the song is \"contemporary and evocative,\" comparing it to the song \"Glicine\", which tells \"an authentic stream of consciousness about the need to overcome the fear of change.\"\nMassimo Longoni of TgCom24 found in the song \"two faces: it opens in the groove of Noemi's more classic ballads and then takes off with an explosion of electronics that, accomplice to a killer mix, often overpowers her voice. Between tonal and atmospheric changes, the impression is that she has to chase a bit to stay within the piece\".\nFrancesco Prisco, writing for Il Sole 24 Ore, found in the song \"an attempt at rejuvenation\" but reiterating that \"on the music scene it only takes two years and you rediscover yourself old,\", however, the singer has \"one of the most beautiful soul voices we have in Italy.\"\n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe music video for the song was released on YouTube on 2 February 2022, to accompany the single's release. It was directed by Cristiano Pedrocco.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Anglo-German Payments Agreement was a bilateral agreement signed on 1 November 1934 between the governments of the United Kingdom and Nazi Germany. The agreement aimed to address the German debt question, particularly in relation to the Dawes and Young reparations agreements, and set a framework for trade relations between the two countries during a period of increasing political tension in Europe. The agreement remained in place until the outbreak of World War II in 1939.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAs part of the Dawes and Young reparations agreements, Germany sold two issues of bonds to creditor nations in 1924 and 1930 respectively, commercialising Germany's reparations obligations by borrowing from private investors. During late 1933, British concerns arose over the deteriorating conditions faced by the holders of these bonds—whose returns depended on Germany's ability and willingness to pay its debts—largely due to the economic policies implemented by Hjalmar Schacht, the newly reappointed President of the Reichsbank. As conditions worsened, the British government contemplated retaliatory measures, including the possibility of imposing a unilateral Anglo-German clearing arrangement to safeguard British interests.\n\nThe proposed arrangement would have required debts owed by British importers of German goods to be paid and settled through a clearing house in London, instead of being paid to German creditors directly. German debts with British creditors, including bonds, would then be forcibly repaid through this clearing house, an arrangement disadvantageous to Germany as the debts would be paid in sterling.\nThe approach raised alarm among London's banking circles, as it risked German retaliation in the form of a moratorium on all British financial claims and thus a disruption of normal trade and credit channels with Germany. However, the threat of a unilateral clearing arrangement prompted German authorities to agree to a settlement on British terms at the end of January 1934.\nOn 14 June 1934, these concerns resurfaced, as Germany appeared on the brink of defaulting on its long-term debts. The Reichsbank announced it would stop paying interest to creditors in foreign currencies from 1 July onwards, prompting the British to again threaten to establish a clearing house.\n\nThese renewed concerns led to the establishment of a financial mission from Berlin to London in late June, the negotiations of which culminated in a preliminary agreement between the two countries which was announced on 5 July 1934, and the publication of a white paper the same day. This was known as the Anglo-German Transfer Agreement, with Germany promising to end discrimination of creditors and purchase bond coupons in sterling (i.e. continue interest repayments), and was to last six months from 1 July onwards.\nFurther negotiations on a formal and more extensive agreement, led by British economist Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, continued into September 1934. On 10 August 1934, an Exchange Agreement was agreed to in Berlin, ensuring British exporters would receive payments despite Germany's foreign exchange restrictions. This agreement failed not long after, and was suspended on 1 August.\nA breakthrough in negotiations finally came in late October 1934—the Payments Agreement was announced to the public on 2 November, having been signed the day before.\n\n\n== Terms ==\nThe agreement stipulated several key terms:\n\nThe German government would continue to provide sterling funds at the Bank of England for the purchase of all coupons under the Dawes and Young loans at their full value, thus continuing Germany's interest payments on bonds issued under the Dawes and Young agreements (Article 7.i). Germany would also allow for the redemption of all medium and long-term debts against 4% funding bonds (Article 7.ii). This agreement gave UK residents and subjects of the British Empire preferential coupon payments.\nGermany committed to earmarking a percentage of its export earnings in England for the purchase of British commodities (Article 1.ii). Initially set at 55%, this percentage was effectively increased to 60% in 1938 following the change to a sliding scale system.\nGermany committed £400,000 towards paying outstanding debts (Article 4), defined as debts towards UK persons or corporations \"in respect of the sale of goods\". Germany would also allocate 10% of its export earnings to pay back these debts, if not already liquidated by the lump sum, a provision in effect until 1 November 1935 (Article 6).\nForeign exchange certificates would be issued by the German government for imports from Britain, up to 55% of the sterling proceeds from German exports to Britain, without restrictions (Article 1.i). These certificates were calculated monthly based on the export value of the penultimate month.\nGoods imported from Britain had to carry a certificate of British origin from the British Chambers of Commerce to prevent the circumvention of trade restrictions (Article 1.iv).\n\n\n== Revision in 1938 ==\nBy 1936, with Hitler increasing German rearmament and marching into the Rhineland on 7 March, the agreement was being questioned in papers such as the Financial News. By 1938, with Hitler's annexation of Austria into Germany, these concerns escalated into a crisis, with Britain being forced to seek a revision of the agreement's terms or dissolve it. The economic basis of this potential breakdown of the agreement surrounded the question of Germany honouring the terms of loans given to Austria following World War I.\nAs negotiations in Berlin for a resettlement began in late May 1938, Germany explicitly refused to honour these Austrian loans, causing Britain to threaten to end the agreement altogether within a months time. In response, Germany capitulated and counter-offered: a reduction on the Dawes and Young interest rates in return for Germany paying the Austrian loans' interest in full. However, the inclusion of a demand that Britain commit to take in more German exports again moved the British to threaten the use of a unilateral clearing, as in 1934. On 14 June, Britain publicly threatened to end the agreement, giving a deadline of 1 July.\nOn 1 July, a revised agreement was reached. Germany would continue to pay interest on Austrian loans, and the clause regarding British exports was amended to a sliding scale, with a new provision that Germany could request a reduction of this allocation if its earnings from British exports were not sufficient to cover it. This new arrangement effectively increased the 55% figure agreed to in 1934 to 60%, notwithstanding an increase in exports resulting from the Austrian annexation. German demands for a reduction in interest rates were also met: on the Dawes and the Austrian loan of 1930, a reduction from 7% to 5%, with a 2% cumulative sinking fund—on the Young loan, a reduction to 4.5%, with a 1% cumulative sinking fund.\n\n\n== Impact ==\nThe agreement is generally viewed as having steadied and formalised foreign relations between the two countries throughout the interbellum, providing a significant framework for economic relations until 1939. Author Bernd-Jürgen Wendt writes that the agreement had \"generally accepted stabilising effects on bilateral relations, an effect which even the political crises of the subsequent years could not impair. Thus in July 1938 with the Sudeten crisis heading towards its climax, von Dirksen, the German Ambassador to London, explicitly referred to the 1934 Economic Agreement and the 1935 Naval Convention as the 'two main supports which had hitherto carried the swaying structure of foreign relations [i.e. between Britain and Germany] even in critical periods'.\"\nIn addition to guaranteeing debt repayment, the Treasury and Bank of England saw the agreement as an instrument to widen and revive Germany's foreign trade internationally, in effect fulfilling a British desire to raise the purchasing power of producers in favour of British exports, helping Britain's economic recovery from the Great Depression. \nThe agreement was also beneficial for the Nazi war economy—author Alexander Anievas writes that the agreement allowed Germany to \"collect a considerable sum of earnings from the maintenance of its export surplus with Britain. This provided the Nazis with vital financial means to purchase those raw materials Germany needed for her war economy, either through English transit trade or directly on the world market [...] The Payments Agreement was thus designed to ultimately strengthen the Nazi regime from internal socio-economic shocks while protecting Britain's socio-economic interests.\"\nGermany continued to pay interest on Dawes and Young bonds to British and French holders until September 1939, when World War II began. Payments to Dutch and Belgian holders were suspended in 1940, to US bondholders in 1941, and to Italian bondholders in 1942. These suspensions of payments was against the provisions of the Dawes and Young plans, which still required payment in times of war and to hostile states. The bonds also continued to be traded on the London Stock Exchange until the end of the war in 1945.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAppeasement\nGermany–United Kingdom relations\nTimeline of British diplomatic history\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nAnievas, Alexander (2011). \"The international political economy of appeasement: the social sources of British foreign policy during the 1930s\".

        "content": "Weedon Viaduct is a railway bridge carrying the West Coast Main Line through Weedon Bec in Northamptonshire, England. It was designed by Robert Stephenson for the London and Birmingham Railway and opened in 1838. It is a Grade II listed building.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe viaduct crosses Church Street and the young River Nene in Weedon Bec, on the outskirts of the village. It was built in stock brick but has been extensively patched with blue brick and dressed with stone. It has five low semi-circular arches with stone springers (the lowest block in the arches). The arches have a 50-foot (15-metre) span, giving a total length of 50 yards (46 metres). It has a roll-moulded stone string course running the length of the bridge above the arches and a brick parapet with stone copings. It terminates in splayed abutments. The viaduct is almost immediately north of Stowe Hill Tunnel near the Watford Gap, where the railway, canal, and ancient and modern roads all take a similar path. Shortly beyond the viaduct, Church Road passes through a low tunnel under the Grand Union Canal.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe viaduct was built for the London and Birmingham Railway, whose chief engineer was Robert Stephenson. It opened with the line in 1838. The viaduct sandwiches Lower Weedon between the railway and the canal. This stretch of railway, including the viaduct, is little altered since it was built. South of Roade Cutting, the line was quadrupled in the 1880s. Stephenson originally bypassed Northampton, but the Northampton loop (opened in 1881) acts as the second pair of tracks between the cutting and Rugby, which negated the need for substantial modification.\nThe viaduct was one of the features illustrated by John Cooke Bourne in his series of lithographs published to mark the opening of the London and Birmingham Railway. Bourne shows the viaduct separating the village from green areas to the east, including the local churchyard which is now the opposite side of the viaduct from the church. Bourne's vantage point was the canal embankemnt.\nThe viaduct was designated a Grade II listed building in 1987. Listed building status provides legal protection from unauthorised demolition or unsympathetic modification and is applied to structures of historical and architectural importance.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nBiddle, Gordon (2011).

Symons received British Patent No. 5,759 for a technique that was used about two years later for the oldest known publication that used a line-sheet to create the illusion of motion in pictures. It is an early use of stereography.\nMay – Auguste Berthier published an article about the history of stereoscopic images in French scientific magazine Le Cosmos, which included his method of creating an  autostereogram. Alternating strips from the left and right image of a traditional stereoscopic negative had to be recomposed as an interlaced image, preferably during the printing of the image on paper. A glass plate with opaque lines had to be fixed in front of the interlaced print with a few millimeters in between, so the lines on the screen formed a parallax barrier: from the right distance and angle each eye could only see the photographic strips shot from the corresponding angle. The article was illustrated with a diagram of the principle, an image of the two parts of a stereoscopic photograph divided into exaggerated wide bands, and the same strips recomposed as an interlaced image. Berthier's idea was hardly noticed.\n\n\n== Births ==\n\n\n=== January ===\nJanuary 24: Yasuji Murata, Japanese animator, master of cutout animation, (produced dozens of mostly educational films, featuring characters such as Momotarō and Norakuro), (d. 1966).\n\n\n=== May ===\nMay 3: Dodie Smith, English novelist and playwright, (her children's novel The Hundred and One Dalmatians was adapted into the animated film One Hundred and One Dalmatians), (d. 1990). \nMay 18: Hans Fischerkoesen, German commercial animator, pioneered the use of three-dimensional elements in animation, (Fischerkoesen Studios, Verwitterte Melodie  (Weather-Beaten Melody),  Der Schneemann (The Snowman), Das dumme Gänslein (The Silly Goose) ), (d. 1973).\n\n\n=== June ===\nJune 21: Bob McCay, American cartoonist, illustrator, comic book colorist and inker, (assistant for his father Winsor McCay, he received sole credit for several of his father's cartoons, including an animated film),  (d. 1962). \n\n\n=== July ===\nJuly 2: Quirino Cristiani, Italian-born Argentine animation director and cartoonist, created the world's first two animated feature films, and the first animated feature film with sound, pioneer of cutout animation, (El Apóstol, Sin dejar rastros, Firpo-Dempsey, Peludópolis, El mono relojero), (d. 1984).\n\n\n=== November ===\nNovember 3: Gustaf Tenggren, Swedish-American illustrator and animator, (chief illustrator for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, animator for Bambi and Pinocchio, background artist for The Ugly Duckling and The Old Mill), (d. 1970).\n\n\n== References ==",

It is endemic to China, where it has been observed in the Yunnan Province, parts of the Guangxi Province, and the Guizhou Province. It is suspected to be in nearby parts of Vietnam.\nThis frog has been in forests near streams between 1,000 and 1,900 meters above sea level. The female frog lays eggs in piles of jelly on leaves. The tadpoles swim in static water.\nThe IUCN classifies this frog as least concern of extinction because of its large range and relative abundance. Outside protected parks, humans can pose some threat to this frog by collecting wood. The frog's range includes several protected parks, including Hualinshan Nature Reserves.\n\n\n== Original publication ==\nFei L; C-y Ye; J-p Jiang (2010). \"A new species of Rhacophoridae from Yunnan, China (Amphibia, Anura)\".

Copeland supported the album with a North American tour.\n\n\n== Production ==\nProduced by Copeland and John Hahn, the album was recorded in Brussels, Belgium, and New York City. Copeland used a Gibson guitar instead of his usual Peavey. He duetted with Dr. John on the cover of Hank Williams's \"Jambalaya (On the Bayou)\"; Dr. John played piano on \"Circumstances\". Buckwheat Zydeco played accordion on \"Love Song\". Hank Crawford, David \"Fathead\" Newman, and the Uptown Horns contributed to the album; Copeland became fond of using horns on blues songs after picking up Albert Collins's band, in 1953. Joe Hughes, Copeland's early mentor, also played guitar on Flyin' High. \"Thigpen (Cornball)\" is an instrumental song.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nThe Washington Post wrote that the album \"boasts strong original songs, smart horn charts, guest stars who came to work rather than schmooze and performances that look forward rather than backward.\" The Sun-Sentinel deemed the album \"sweet and sassy, low and laid back.\" The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette noted that the songs \"showcase Copeland's impressive command of the nuances of working-class misery, pride and romance.\" The Herald-Sun opined that the album \"partakes too fully of the slicker and more superficial rhythm and blues influences that have adulterated the blues in recent years.\" The Chicago Tribune included Flyin' High on its list of the 14 best blues albums of 1993.\nAllMusic wrote that \"Copeland was at his best on tunes where the emphasis was on style rather than lyric meaning and elaboration.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "The Alliance against Depression is an integrated community-based approach to tackling depression and suicide. It originated in Germany in 2008 using EU funding to tackle Mental Health issues and involved several members and more than 100 network partners across Europe, Chile, Canada and Australia. The main aim of the EAAD is to improve care and optimize treatment for patients with Depressive disorders and reduce suicidal behavior. PUlrich Hegerl is currently the president of the EAAD.\n\n\n== Approach ==\nThe AAD uses a 4 pillared approach to suicide prevention which includes training specific to primary care and Mental Health care givers are trained to recognize and treat patients presenting with Mental Health related issues. The second pillar is an overarching public awareness raising campaign that consists of flyers, posters and community events. The third pillar relates to community facilitators and stakeholders being targeted and educated to understand the warning signs of a developing mental health issue and / or suicidal behavior. These could include Teachers, Parents, Youth Workers etc. and the fourth pillar involves direct assistance for high-risk groups who experience suicidal behavior. The concept of the AAD is that while each AAD must run activities that encompass all four pillars, the specifics of what that entails will differ between communities, cultures and countries and therefore the AAD allows flexibility from one group to the next as to how their local AAD is run and what their specific focuses are.\n\n\n== Trials ==\nThe Alliance Against Depression is recognized as the world's best practice for the care of people with depression and in the prevention of suicidal behavior. The initial AAD was in the trial region of Nuremberg and  resulted in a 24% reduction of suicidal acts within a 2-year period. The AAD has the flexibility to be adapted based on the specific needs of the local community.\n\n\n== Results ==\nAccording to the trials, the Nuremberg AAD successfully reduced the number of suicidal acts and suicide attempts by 24% over a 2-year period when compared to the controlled region. There was no significant reduction in completed suicides over that time.\n\n\n== Australian AAD ==\nThe WA Primary Health Alliance brought the AAD over to Western Australia in 2017 with the Kwinana AAD being the first to be created in 2018. Since then local AAD's have been created in Rockingham, Belmont, Busselton, Kalamunda and Cockburn.\nDaniel Rock, the Alliances principal advisor for Mental Health at WAPHA said “The alliance actually equips people with specific knowledge around their community so instead of saying, 'You should go to your GP, you should go seek help', you can actually point to a place to go to [and say] 'Why don't you go to the X centre or you should speak to this GP”.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Canada Ukraine Surgical Aid Program or CUSAP is a mission of Canadian doctors led by Oleh Antonyshyn, a Canadian plastic surgeon of Ukrainian descent. Initiated by the Canada-Ukraine Foundation in 2014 following the Revolution of Dignity, CUSAP's volunteer doctors provide free treatment to patients, while the Canada-Ukraine Foundation covers operating costs.\nFrom 2014 to 2022, the mission was based in Kyiv. In 2022, with the beginning of the Russian full-scale invasion, the surgical assistance program was relocated to the hospital in Czeładz, Poland.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn April 2014, after the shootings on the Maidan, a Ukrainian-American physician, activist, and philanthropist Ulana Suprun, who served as Director of Humanitarian Initiatives for the Ukrainian World Congress, appealed to the Canada-Ukraine Foundation for medical assistance to Ukrainians wounded during the Revolution of Dignity.\nIn March 2014, to assess the state of affairs and the possibilities of medical assistance, the Canada-Ukraine Foundation organized a trip of several representatives of the organization who had medical specialization, including Antonyshyn, a plastic surgeon at Toronto's Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, professor in the Department of Plastic, Reconstructive, and Aesthetic Surgery at the University of Toronto, and a member of the Canadian Ukrainian diaspora.\nThe delegation visited several hospitals in Kyiv where Ukrainians with severe injuries were treated and also visited hospitals in Donetsk. After visiting at least 20 hospitals all over Ukraine, Oleh Antonyshyn and the leadership of the Canada-Ukraine Foundation established the Canada Ukraine Medical missions. After eight years, it was renamed to the Canada Ukraine Surgical Aid Program (CUSAP).\nIn November of the same year, at the invitation of  Antonyshyn, 25 volunteer surgeons, anesthesiologists, and nurses arrived in Ukraine from Canada to carry out a mission to treat patients who were injured during the Revolution of Dignity and those who were wounded in Eastern Ukraine. The medical team was assembled across Canada, including Victoria, Vancouver, Edmonton, Winnipeg and Toronto. More than 60 patients from Ukraine with complex post-traumatic conditions and distortions were consulted. A total of 37 reconstructive surgeries were performed on 30 patients.\n\n\n== Activities ==\nBetween 2014 and 2020, Antonyshyn and the surgical aid team conducted five missions. During each mission, they treated about 40 patients, and by the fifth mission, the medical team was regularly consulting 100 patients.\nFrom 2014 to 2020, the Canadian Mission of Plastic Surgeons was based in Kyiv, and Canadian doctors also performed on-site surgeries in Lviv and Odesa. Over the years of the mission's work in Ukraine, the Canada-Ukraine Foundation has contributed almost 2 million Canadian dollars to Ukrainian hospitals.\nIn 2016, Antonyshyn was awarded the State Award \"For Merit\" of the III Degree by Presidential Decree.\nIn 2017, Antonyshyn received the M. Ochrymovych Humanitarian Award, also known as the Helping Hands Humanitarian Award, from the Ukrainian Canadian Social Services Toronto (UCSST) organization.\n\n\n=== Activities since 2022 ===\nWith the outbreak of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine, the Canada Ukraine Surgical Aid Program relocated to Poland. Operating rooms were set aside in the hospital in Czeładź, where volunteer doctors from Canada provide orthopedic and plastic surgery to seriously wounded military and civilians, who have suffered mine-blast injuries. Ukrainian surgeons are also involved in the postoperative care and recovery of the victims.\nIn 2022, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki visited the hospital in Czeładź to thank Canadian doctors who operate on seriously wounded war veterans and civilian Ukrainians.\n\n\n=== Volunteer doctors ===\nAt the beginning of the large-scale invasion, the CUSAP team received more than 120 applications from doctors of various specialties from across North America who wanted to treat Ukrainian patients on a volunteer basis. One of the mission participants is Steve McCabe, who, together with his team, was the first in the world to perform an arm transplant. The doctor has been participating in CUSAP missions since 2014.\nFor some facial reconstructions, plastic surgeons use patients' bones from other parts of the body, or artificial implants printed on a 3D printer.\nOperations are performed with the participation of medical specialists from various fields, including maxillofacial surgeons and neurosurgeons, which has a multidisciplinary approach to treatment.\nAccording to Polish law, foreign doctors are prohibited from treating patients in the country without first confirming their qualifications. The Polish government and the Polish Ministry of Health simplified this procedure for CUSAP doctors and issued a 3-week authorization for Canadian doctors to treat patients.\n\n\n=== Funding ===\nOn September 11, 2014, the Ukrainian Canadian community in Toronto hosted a charity event, \"Unite for Ukraine\", to raise funds for the first mission of plastic surgeons to Ukraine. The event was sponsored by Canadian businessman Eugene Melnyk, the Canadian entrepreneur and proprietor of the NHL's Ottawa Senators. The gathering included the attendance of then Prime Minister Stephen Harper, renowned hockey figure Wayne Gretzky, and other notable attendees. The evening raised over 200,000 Canadian dollars. Other donors included representatives of the Canada-Ukraine Foundation, Canadian corporations, and other institutions, which allocated CAD 500,000 for the second and third missions.\nCUSAP's last four missions were funded by donor support raised via the Ukraine Humanitarian Appeal, established in 2022 as a joint initiative of the Ukrainian Canadian Congress (UCC) and the Canada-Ukraine Foundation (CUF).\nThe Canada Ukraine Surgical Aid Program is also supported by the Ministry of Health of Ukraine, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, and the Ministry of Health of Poland. Also, in 2023, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, in collaboration with the Canada-Ukraine Foundation, launched an educational initiative for Ukrainian surgeons. This program aims to improve patient care in Ukraine through joint training and exchange of experience. During each mission, 15-20 Ukrainian doctors are trained in craniofacial surgery.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Barbara McManus was a professor of classics at The College of New Rochelle and an expert in classics and comparative literature, feminism, mythology, and women in antiquity. She was acknowledged both for her research and for innovative teaching approaches, and had a significant influence on both the teaching and research of women in antiquity, and women as classicists.\n\n\n== Career ==\nBarbara McManus gained her BA from the College of New Rochelle in 1964. She moved to Harvard for her MA in 1965, and PhD in Comparative Literature, which she gained in 1976, writing a thesis on \"Inreparabile tempus: A Study of Time in Virgil's Aeneid\".\nIn 1967 she became an instructor in classics at The College of New Rochelle, where she stayed until her retirement in 2000, by which point she had become a professor. She also contributed to the growth of the College of New Rochelle's Women's Studies Program, particularly through the establishment of the newsletter Eos and the Women's Center in 1978. In 1997 she gave the lecture \"Crossing The Boundaries Of Gender: Vergil's Aeneid and Augustan Rome,\" at Hamilton College, funded by the Winslow Lecture Fund. Between 1997 and 2000 she was part of the team who developed the innovative 'VRoma Project', providing Latin resources and an 'interactive virtual Roman world', which was funded by a 'Teaching with Technology' Grant from the NEH, and later became the director of the project until 2015. She also contributed significantly to understanding on female pioneers in Classics, through her research on the life and history of Grace Macurdy, including reenactments of scenes from her life.: 212–14 \nAlong with this grant, McManus received NEH grants in 1983, 1989, and 2006. She served on various Society for Classical Studies (then called the APA) committees, including the Committees on the Status of Women and Minority Groups, and Outreach.: 214  She was elected as a member of the APA Board of Directors (1994–1997) and Vice President for Professional Matters (2001–2005). In 2003-2004 she launched the first census of classics for the APA. In 2009 she was awarded the APA \"Distinguished Service Award\" for her work on their behalf. She also served as president of the Classical Association of the Atlantic States (CAAS) in 2005, and their webmaster between 2005 and 2010. She also served as vice-president and centennial historian of the New York Classical club, and as webmaster of the Women Writing Women's Lives Biography seminar, both in New York.: 212 \nMcManus was awarded an ovatio by the CAAS in 2001, and in 2011 the same organisation established the \"Barbara McManus Leadership Award\" in her honour. The Women's Classical Caucus created the annual Barbara McManus Award for the best published article in gender studies each year in her honour in 2012, and in 2016 she became the first recipient of their own Leadership award.: 547  She was also recognised with awards from The College of New Rochelle, including their Alumnae Association's Ursula Laurus award in 1994 and in 2014 their \"Woman of Achievement\" award. In 2012, the University of Maryland hosted an international, interdisciplinary conference in her honour.: 214 \n\n\n== Selected Works ==\nHalf Human Kind: Contexts and Texts of the Controversy about Women in England 1540-1640 with Katherine Usher Henderson (Urbana: U. of Illinois Press, 1985)\n“Multicentering: The Case of the Athenian Bride,” Helios 17,2 (Autumn 1990) 225–35\nClassics and Feminism: Gendering the Classics (New York: Twayne; London: Prentice Hall, 1997)\n“The VRoma Project: Community and Context for Latin Teaching and Learning,” CALICO Journal 18,2 (2001) 249–68\nThe Drunken Duchess of Vassar: Grace Harriett Macurdy, Pioneering Feminist Scholar (Columbus: Ohio State U.

        "content": "Caritas Czech Republic (Czech: Charita Česká republika) is a Czech Catholic not-for-profit social welfare and humanitarian relief organisation. It is a service of the Czech Bishops' Conference and is the largest social welfare and charitable organisation in the country.\nCaritas Czech Republic is a member of both Caritas Europa and Caritas Internationalis.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nCaritas Czech Republic was founded after the end of the First World War and the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, when structured charity organisations began to operate in various places. At the beginning of the First Czechoslovak Republic, proclaimed in 1918, a network of Catholic agencies gradually emerged, first at grassroots level. This led to the creation of a national Caritas office in Prague in 1928. The goal of this organisation was to coordinate these actions. The Czech Caritas network progressively developed over the following years.\nIn 1945, right at the end of World War II, before the authorities responded to the need for immediate assistance for returning concentration camp prisoners and other war victims, Caritas opened canteens, assisted in document matters, and cared for and treated people. During that time, Caritas nursing stations were staffed by certified and volunteer nurses.\nAfter the 1948 communist coup d'état, Caritas, a Catholic organisation, was consciously expelled from its social and medical environment by the State. The entire Caritas network was dissolved and replaced by a single volunteer organization, the Czech Catholic Caritas. It was under state supervision and its activities were limited to publishing religious press and literature, selling devotional items and caring for elderly monks, nuns and priests.\nThe rebuilding of the organisation only started after the Velvet Revolution of 1989. The leaders of many local Caritas organisations were parish members, often participants in pilgrimages to Rome for the canonization of Agnes of Bohemia, or members of Christian relief committees formed after the devastating 1988 Armenian earthquake.\nIn 1997, Caritas Czech Republic played a significant role as a primary provider of disaster relief during the extensive flooding in Moravia. The organisation actively participated in the reconstruction efforts, providing assistance to affected individuals, coordinating fundraising campaigns, and engaging in various support activities for the community.\nIn 2001, Caritas launched its annual Three Kings collection (Tříkrálová sbírka) for the first time.\nOther major events that the organisation responded to were the 2002 floods, the COVID-19 pandemic (starting in 2020), the 2021 South Moravia tornado, AND THE arrival of Ukrainian refugees starting in 2022.\n\n\n== Structure ==\nCaritas Czech Republic follows the structure of the Czech Catholic Church. The organisations consists of a national secretariat and 10 archdiocesan or diocesan Caritas organisations which are subdivided into 274 local structures. The secretariat based in Prague is responsible for the coordination of activities at the national level and is engaged in health and social advocacy activities. It also maintains a separate department for the implementation of humanitarian aid and development cooperation activities, and it operates a hotel and training centre, named Marianeum and located in Prague.\nThe diocesan Caritas structures coordinate the activities of Caritas organizations in the territory of the dioceses. They also provide some services but most of the social and health services of Caritas in Czech Republic are provided by the hundreds of regional, municipal and parish Caritas organisations.\nThe eight diocesan structures of Caritas Czech Republic are:\n\nAnother organisation that is part of Caritas Czech Republic, Czech Catholic Caritas (Česká katolická charita) operates 9 retirement homes for nuns and priests.\n\n\n== Work ==\n\nCaritas Czech Republic works in a variety of social sectors. In 2022, the organisation ran 72 specialised counselling centres and 178 registered healthcare facilities  which employed 1,667 nurses. Its social and healthcare services, including counselling, social care, social prevention and healthcare, reached 199,504 individuals. In addition, more than 500 persons benefitted from afforable housing to more than 500 persons.\nAdditionally, Caritas Czech Republic managed 22 social enterprises in 2022, including cafés, sewing workshops, laundries, bakeries, pastry shops, waffle production, furniture renovation, and food preparation and delivery services.\nInternationally, Caritas Czech Republic directly implements humanitarian and development projects though its country offices in Georgia, Iraq, Moldova, Mongolia, Turkey and Ukraine. The organisation is one of the NGO partners of DG ECHO.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Chris Tanasale is an Indonesian former politician and military officer who served as the mayor of Ambon, Maluku between 1996 and 2001. He served in the Indonesian Army and reached the rank of colonel, and was appointed into Maluku's Regional House of Representatives in 1992 as an army representative.\nHis selection as mayor by governor Akib Latuconsina in 1996 was a compromise. Latuconsina, a Muslim, sought to appoint a Muslim military officer to the position to replace the previous mayor Johanes Sudijono, but Indonesian Democratic Party representatives in Ambon's city council resisted and sought to retain Sudijono. Latuconsina relented and chose Tanasale, a Christian military officer, to prevent alienating Christians in the city. Both the fall of Suharto and the outbreak of sectarian violence in Maluku occurred during his tenure, with the city of Ambon experiencing a sharp rise in unemployment. As the conflict spread throughout Maluku and Ambon, refugees flooded into Ambon and occupied abandoned shops which had been damaged by the fighting. The city government under Tanasale experienced a drop in revenues, and rehabilitation efforts were hindered by lack of communication with the provincial government.\nHe was not reelected by the legislature for a second term in 2001, being defeated in a vote by Marcus Jacob Papilaja. In 2003, he unsuccessfully ran as Vice Governor of Maluku in a legislature vote, receiving none of the 36 votes cast.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "David K. Gifford (born 22 October 1954) is a computer science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the area of computational biology. As a Principal Investigator in MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), he leads research in developing interpretable computational models for drug development, immunology, genomics, and human therapeutics.\nGifford received his BS from MIT in 1976, and his PhD from Stanford University in 1981. He joined the MIT faculty in 1982, where he is Professor of Computer Science and Engineering and Professor of Biological Engineering.\nHis group develops combined computational and experimental approaches to the discovery of novel biology and human therapeutics. Some of his work involves looking at non-coding genes in the genome known as non-functional DNA. He has collaborated on techniques for searching long stretches of the genome to identify new regions that appear to play a crucial role in gene regulation.\nHis group has also worked to develop drugs for specific health conditions. His team's protocols for the direct programming of stem cells into motor neurons has shown promise as a regenerative medicine for motor neuron diseases.\nMore recently Gifford's group has used machine learning methods to help scientists use CRISPR, specifically with predicting DNA repair outcomes in the form of insertions or deletions. The tool can be used to predict genetic diseases that can be cured by the direct application of CRISPR. \nHe has also helped create pan-variant COVID-19 vaccines that work on a wider swath of diverse populations and have been shown in mice to be able to protect against a highly pathogenic variant of COVID-19.\nIn 2011 Gifford was named a fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery for \"contributions to distributed systems, e-commerce and content distribution\".\nGifford has also founded multiple companies, including e-commerce site Open Market and the biotech startup Think Therapeutics. His company SightPath was bought by Cisco in 2002 for $800 million.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Consolação Street (Portuguese: Rua da Consolação) is an important thoroughfare in the Brazilian city of São Paulo. It begins in the central area of the city, near the Anhangabaú Valley, and ends at Estados Unidos Street, in the Jardins district. \nIt has three different stretches. In the first and third sections, between Anhangabaú Valley and São Luís Avenue, and between Paulista Avenue and Estados Unidos Street, it consists of a single lane road. In the central section, it has eight lanes (two of which are exclusive bus lanes) and integrates the Campo Limpo-Rebouças-Centro bus corridor.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nConsolação Street originated from the Pinheiros Path (Caminho de Pinheiros), a road that existed during colonial Brazil and connected Vila de São Paulo to Vila de Pinheiros. It marked the beginning of the route to the cities in the west. It started at the end of Direita Street, passed through Anhangabaú Valley and continued towards Pinheiros until it met Sorocaba Road. It was also known as Aniceto Path (Caminho do Aniceto) and Taques Street (Rua do Taques). The current name derives from the construction of the old Church of Our Lady of Consolation in 1800. Despite the presence of the church, the current neighborhood of Consolação remained isolated, far from the city and with very few residents in 1855.The Consolação Public Cemetery began to be built in 1854 and was opened on July 3, 1858 during a smallpox epidemic that afflicted São Paulo. At the end of the 19th century, Consolação Street was one of the main roads leading to Paulista Avenue. Between the 1950s and 1960s, it underwent an extensive renovation that widened the space. The first stores specializing in lighting and chandeliers were established around the same time. Despite having all the characteristics of an avenue, the official name remains Consolação Street.\nAt the end of the 19th century, São Paulo's first velodrome was installed in Consolação Street. The track measured 380 meters long by 8 meters wide and had a 700-meter-long grandstand for 800 spectators. It also had tennis courts, a soccer field and ponds for swimming. \nIn the 1960s, Mayor Faria Lima decided to double the street. Work began in 1965 and finished in 1968 after expropriations and demolitions were carried out between Dona Antônia de Queirós Street and Paulista Avenue. The area expropriated for enlargement was 21,600 square meters. In 1972, the Consolação Gallery, a pedestrian passage under the street where cinemas, nightclubs, bars and restaurants are located, was built.\n\n\n== Important buildings ==\n\nConsolação Street has several important buildings, such as the Anchieta Building, where the Riviera Bar, a place frequented by bohemians and intellectuals, used to be, and the Cine Belas Artes, inaugurated in 1943 as the Cine Ritz. The site is also home to the Mário de Andrade Library, with a collection of over 450,000 titles and more than 8,000 rare books, the Mackenzie Presbyterian University and the Marina Cintra College. There is also the Higienópolis-Mackenzie station on Line 4 of the Metro, which opened on January 23, 2018, on the corner of Piauí Street.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nBesides belonging to the Campo Limpo-Rebouças-Centro bus corridor, one of the city's structural transportation routes, Consolação Street also has two subway stations: Higienópolis-Mackenzie and Paulista, both on Line 4-Yellow. Paulista Station is integrated with Consolação Station on Line 2-Green.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTourism in the city of São Paulo\n\n\n== References ==",

Bainbridge Records acquired the rights to the recordings in 1968. Originally slated to be released in May 1982 under the tile My Favorite Things, Jarreau issued a temporary restraining order against the release of the album. The court initially favored Jarreau, but the label filed an appeal, stating that the album is a studio recording rather than a demo tape. Eventually, the decision was reversed and the album was released in July under the name 1965.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n1965 at Discogs",

        "content": "Francis Purcell Warren (29 May 1895 – circa 3 July 1916) was a British violinist, violist and composer who was killed in World War One.\nWarren was born in Leamington Spa. His father, Walter James Warren, was a musician. He studied at the Royal College of Music from February 1910 and was awarded the Morley Scholarship in May of that year. While at the college he became a close friend of Herbert Howells. Howells portrayed \"Bunny\" Warren in his light orchestral suite The B's (1914), alongside two other friends, Arthur Bliss and Arthur Benjamin.\nIn the summer of 1914, before conscription was compulsory, Warren volunteered for war duty, joining the Royal Warwickshire Regiment as a private. After a short spell in France he returned to England  and joined the 10th South Lancashire Regiment as a Second Lieutenant. On 3 July 1916 he was reported missing at Mons in Belgium during the Battle of the Somme. His body was not found. Warren is commemorated on the Thiepval Memorial. His name is also one of the 38 on the War Memorial at the Royal College of Music. Howells dedicated his 1917 Elegy for Viola to the memory of Warren.\nHis surviving works include the short motet Ave Verum, published by Richards & Co in 1912, the Benediction Service (1912, held in the British Library), the Five Short Pieces for Cello and Piano (Curwen, 1914)  and the Variations on an Original Theme (originally the final movement of his String Quartet in A minor), composed circa 1914 and posthumously published by Cramer in 1927. There was also a Canon, scored for string orchestra. An Adagio for cello and piano was intended for a sonata that remained unfinished. Cobbett described it as \"a powerful and deeply moving piece, in which an almost prophetic foreboding seems to colour the spacious phrases\". Thomas Dunhill described it as \"indubitably his masterpiece\". \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWar Composers: Francis Purcell Warren\nVariations on an Original Theme for String Quartet, realization by Steve's Bedroom Band\nFree scores by Francis Purcell Warren at the International Music Score Library Project (IMSLP)",

        "content": "The Castlereagh-Canning duel was a pistol duel between the British Minister of War Viscount Castlereagh and Foreign Secretary George Canning, which took place on September 21, 1809, at Putney Heath. The reasons for the duel were the rivalry between the two politicians and numerous disagreements between them over the conduct of the war against Napoleonic France in 1808 and 1809. These differing opinions ultimately led to Canning's demand for a new appointment to the War Office in the spring of 1809, accompanied by a threat of his own resignation. Prime Minister Portland was reluctant to lose either Canning or Castlereagh and delayed a decision for an extended period. Instead, the matter was discussed with King George III and other members of the cabinet without Castlereagh's knowledge. Castlereagh was not informed of the circumstances for an extended period. He only became aware of the discussions in the late summer of 1809 and, in response, challenged Canning to a duel a few days later.\nThe duel, in which Canning was wounded in the leg by Castlereagh, resulted in the final collapse of the Portland government and the ascension of Spencer Perceval as the new prime minister. Castlereagh and Canning, meanwhile, spent several years on the backbenches, absent from any government responsibility.\n\n\n== The origins and rise of Castlereagh and Canning ==\n\nWhile Castlereagh was the son of an aristocratic family with Irish-Scottish roots, George Canning was the son of a disinherited Irish landowner and an actress. He spent his early years in poverty before, thanks to the generosity of a relative, he received a privileged education at Eton and Oxford, where he excelled intellectually and was quickly regarded as a promising politician by what was considered his outstanding talents. A celebrated orator and unashamedly ambitious, he was nevertheless regarded as an outsider by his more privileged political contemporaries, who viewed him with a mixture of snobbery and suspicion due to his humble origins. By contrast, Castlereagh was perceived as the archetypal representative of a privileged group of insiders, to whom rank and dignity came effortlessly, despite his perceived lack of eloquence.\nBoth began their political careers as supporters of the Whigs around Charles James Fox. As the increasingly bloody French Revolution unfolded, both underwent a shift in their political orientation and joined William Pitt the Younger, who promptly recognized their political talent and supported them. Nearly of the same age, the two rapidly became rivals for promotions and government posts in Pitt's cabinet. Upon Pitt's resignation in 1801, both followed Pitt's example and returned to the backbenches. Pitt encouraged numerous of his closest political associates to join the newly constituted government under the leadership of Henry Addington (whom he had previously proposed for the role). Castlereagh followed Pitt's advice and became President of the Board of Control. However, the rhetorically adept Canning remained on the opposition benches, deriding Addington and ardently advocating for Pitt's cause. This angered Pitt, who had not only proposed Addington himself as his successor but regarded him as his temporary replacement and supported him in the House of Commons. Upon Pitt's return to the office of Prime Minister in 1804, Castlereagh retained his previous office and assumed the additional role of Leader of the House of Commons, thereby relieving Pitt, who was already in poor health, of the burden of attending to the House of Commons. He also assumed control of the War Office. Castlereagh, who had already established a reputation as a reliable and capable administrator during his tenure as a cabinet minister, thus ascended to become an indispensable figure within the government. In contrast, the ambitious Canning was compelled to accept a relatively insignificant post outside the cabinet and was also overlooked for subsequent cabinet vacancies. After a debate, Pitt promised him the next open cabinet post, but he died in January 1806, whereupon William Grenville and Charles James Fox formed the Ministry of All the Talents. Canning and Castlereagh were not involved in the formation of the government. Following an agreement with other young \"Pittites,\" including Spencer Perceval, the group went into opposition together.\n\n\n== Castlereagh and Canning in Portland's wartime government ==\n\nFollowing the collapse of the brief administration of all the talents, King George III selected the elderly Duke of Portland as the new Prime Minister in the spring of 1807.\nIn the new cabinet, Castlereagh was given his former office, the War Office. Canning was awarded the Foreign Office following the Marquess of Wellesley's refusal. Despite the substantial promotion, Canning also claimed the post of Leader of the House of Commons, which Castlereagh had held. Castlereagh was prepared to relinquish this office (which he felt was a burden), but refused to give it to Canning. As a compromise solution, the position was assumed by Spencer Perceval.\nAs in his first term as prime minister, when Charles James Fox had been the dominant figure in the government, Portland was once again more of a figurehead than the head of government. In practice, Portland proved to be weak in leadership, sluggish, and conflict-averse. He usually stayed away from cabinet meetings. As a result of Portland's weakness, each department was left to its own devices. Consequently, no higher authority in the cabinet could arbitrate disagreements between the departments. The four leading figures in the Cabinet were Canning and Castlereagh, plus Spencer Perceval in his dual role as Chancellor of the Exchequer and Leader of the House of Commons, and the Home Secretary, Lord Hawkesbury (who inherited the title Earl of Liverpool in 1808 after the death of his father, with which he became famous). Additionally, the Cabinet included Castlereagh's uncle, Lord Camden, who held the position of Lord President of the Council.\n\n\n== Conflicts over warfare ==\n\nIn 1807, the war against Napoleonic France continued. Like its predecessors, the Portland cabinet was divided over the optimal strategy. Numerous disagreements arose within the cabinet, which increasingly impeded the government's ability to function. In contrast, George Canning had increasingly established himself as the driving force of the government. To secure the maritime superiority of the Royal Navy, Canning successfully proposed neutralizing the fleet of neutral Denmark either through diplomatic overtures or, if necessary, by force, to remove it from Napoleon's grasp. At the same time, he persuaded the Portuguese royal family to flee to Brazil to protect the Portuguese fleet from Napoleon's grasp. Castlereagh supported both measures. Even when Napoleon's intervention in Spain presented the opportunity to open up a new theater of war, Canning was the driving force behind the prompt decision to dispatch troops under the command of Arthur Wellesley (later Duke of Wellington) to the Iberian Peninsula to support the uprising against Napoleon. Castlereagh was indisposed for several months during 1808 with an unspecified illness. As a consequence, he became a liability to Canning. The two frequently disagreed in the Cabinet over the question of a suitable commander-in-chief. Canning regarded the previous commander Wellesley as a suitable choice, while Castlereagh supported King George III's demands in the Cabinet for a formally higher-ranking officer and ultimately prevailed. Wellesley's forces were victorious over the French at the Battle of Vimeiro in August 1808, but were subsequently placed under the command of the two generals Burrard and Dalrymple. In the Convention of Cintra, both generals renounced the advantages they had gained through the armistice that had been negotiated with France. John Moore, who was subsequently dispatched to replace the two recalled generals, and who was once again viewed with skepticism by Canning, did not fare much better in the eyes of the British cabinet. He was compelled to withdraw his army after Napoleon intervened. Moore was killed in a rearguard action in January 1809, thereby reinstating Wellesley as commander-in-chief. The army was initially evacuated and sent to Portugal in the spring.\nDespite facing significant internal criticism, Canning defended Moore's campaign in the House of Commons against the opposition's intense criticism in a compelling and unanimously endorsed speech, preventing the government from suffering a setback in the subsequent close vote.\nCanning and Castlereagh also increasingly disagreed about the optimal strategic approach. Canning advocated for a concentration of the limited military forces on the Iberian theater of war. Castlereagh, on the other hand, was preparing a British invasion of the Netherlands or northern France in parallel with the Iberian campaign to support and relieve the military pressure on the ally Austria. This led to the planning of the Walcheren Expedition. Canning perceived this as a potential threat to the success of the Iberian campaign, yet he ultimately acquiesced to the majority decision of the cabinet.\nCanning initiated a discussion with Prime Minister Portland and conveyed his opinion that the government was not adequately equipped to fulfill its duties. He also alluded to the possibility of his resignation. A few days later, he met with Portland at his country estate in Buckinghamshire and reiterated his comments. He advised Portland to resign due to health reasons and also demanded a new appointment to the War Office. Portland, who was reluctant to lose either Canning or Castlereagh, attempted to pacify Canning by agreeing in principle, although he initially took no further action. Instead, he initially informed Lord Bathurst (the President of the Board of Trade) and the King, but not Castlereagh. Over the summer, other ministers were involved in discussions about the Cabinet reshuffle and how to deal with Castlereagh. Castlereagh's uncle Lord Camden was also involved, but could not bring himself to report openly to his nephew about what was happening. Portland and Canning initially assumed the opposite and only found out days later that Camden had remained inactive. King George III was unwilling to accept Canning's resignation and simultaneously prohibited Portland from informing Castlereagh of the events. Giles Hunt interprets the King's actions as an attempt to prevent the ascension of Canning, a talented but inexperienced politician, to the position of prime minister.\nCanning, who observed the country in a state of imminent peril in a life-and-death struggle with a superior opponent, became increasingly restless and regularly renewed his demands at Portland, threatening to resign. While he dutifully defended the government and the war effort in the House of Commons, he harshly denounced what he saw as intolerable conditions to acquaintances. For Giles Hunt, Canning's actions were not a blow against a political rival, but rather an expression of mounting despair throughout the war. From an insider's perspective, Canning had observed that the Cabinet was unable to effectively manage the various crises and that the war was on the verge of a negative turn. John Campbell, however, notes that Canning was not only the dominant figure in the cabinet at this time, but was also increasingly acting like it. He was already openly strategizing for the foreseeable succession to Prime Minister Portland, in which he and Spencer Perceval were considered the two most promising candidates. He prepared a memorandum for the King in which he argued against the next prime minister from the House of Lords, which would have limited the succession to him and Spencer Perceval. He also stated in the memorandum that he did not want to serve under Perceval, which would have influenced the election in his favor as an indispensable member of the Cabinet. Additionally, he pledged to Lord Wellesley (Arthur Wellesley's brother) the position of Minister of War as soon as Castlereagh had been removed from office, despite lacking the requisite credentials. Douglas Hurd also perceived Canning's actions as presumptuous and his demand for dismissal as an act that transgressed the boundaries of normal political competition.\n\n\n== Castlereagh's challenge ==\n\nThe Walcheren expedition swiftly deteriorated into a military debacle during the summer of 1809, ultimately proving to be a complete failure. For Canning, this outcome served to reinforce his concerns. He consequently demanded Castlereagh's immediate dismissal. Perceval and Lord Liverpool, however, advocated for a different solution. They persuaded Prime Minister Portland to resign and proposed a significant cabinet reshuffle to address the situation. In this manner, Castlereagh would have been removed from the position of War Minister in a manner that would not compromise the government or the unsuspecting. Portland, who had suffered a stroke in August, accepted the proposal and announced his resignation on September 6, 1809, as soon as a successor had been found; he also informed Canning at the same time that Castlereagh could not simply be dismissed. Canning then renewed his resignation and absented himself from the Cabinet meeting the following day. He probably anticipated being able to secure his appointment as prime minister through this means.\nCastlereagh then became suspicious and demanded an explanation from his uncle, who finally revealed the events to him. Castlereagh also tendered his resignation and ceased attending cabinet meetings. After withdrawing for 12 days, he sent Canning a letter of several pages on September 19, 1809, in which he accused him of having violated the principle of good faith, both privately and publicly. Although he acknowledged Canning's right to criticize, he felt that his honor had been violated. He also accused Canning of conspiring behind his back. The harshly worded letter was tantamount to an invitation to a duel. Castlereagh named Lord Yarmouth as his second, while Canning named Charles Ellis. Ellis attempted to mediate and sent Yarmouth copies of several letters in which Canning had warned the Prime Minister not to conceal the discussions. Nevertheless, Castlereagh, who felt humiliated and betrayed, remained adamant and asserted that Canning could have simply resigned. Canning was thus compelled to acquiesce to the demand for a duel.\n\n\n== Background: Duels as a social practice ==\n\nAlthough prohibited, duels continued to be a prevalent practice among the upper classes in Britain at the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries. Those who were challenged had few options but to accept the duel challenge, as social isolation was a significant consequence of refusal. While earlier duels were typically fought with thrusting weapons, by the late 18th century, the pistol duel had become the dominant form of duel in Britain. In practice, these were extremely inaccurate. Many duelists were not sufficiently familiar with the weapon, and in some cases both opponents deliberately missed. The majority of duels were not fatal, and if both opponents agreed that honor had been served, the duel often remained inconclusive. The practice of dueling was not uncommon among high-ranking politicians. For example, Charles James Fox was injured in a duel in 1779. His political antipode, William Pitt the Younger, had fought a duel with Fox supporter George Tierney in May 1798 following an insult in the House of Commons. Both combatants emerged unscathed from the initial exchange of fire. Pitt discharged his weapon into the air during the second encounter, and both parties subsequently agreed that further action was unnecessary. King George III was enraged and dismayed upon learning of the incident and reminded Pitt that as prime minister, he should have prioritized the interests of the nation over personal considerations. Nevertheless, the practice of dueling persisted.\n\n\n== The duel ==\n\nThe duel took place at 6 a.m. on September 21, 1809, at Putney Heath on Lord Yarmouth's estate - within sight of the house where Pitt the Younger had died three years earlier. Both duelists were accompanied by their seconds. According to the report of his second, Castlereagh was in a relaxed and cheerful mood during the carriage ride to the duel site and engaged in a lively discussion about a popular opera singer. Castlereagh was an accomplished marksman; in his youth in Ireland, a political opponent had withdrawn his challenge when he learned of Castlereagh's skill with a gun. Canning had made his will and written a suicide note to his wife before the duel. Canning had never fired a gun and had never fought a duel. Therefore, his second and Yarmouth had to load and cock the gun for Canning. After a final attempt at mediation by the seconds failed, the duel took place.\nThe first duel, fought at a distance of twelve paces, was inconclusive. After a brief exchange between the seconds, Castlereagh declared that he was still not satisfied, so a second duel was necessary. During the second duel, Castlereagh's shot pierced Canning's thigh. It is unconfirmed that Canning's second shot grazed Castlereagh and shot off a button. Canning, who was hit, asked if a third round was necessary, which was immediately stopped by the two seconds who declared the matter closed. His second and Castlereagh helped Canning to Lord Yarmouth's nearby cottage, where a surgeon was already waiting to treat Canning's wound.\nBecause the bullet had passed through the flesh of the thigh and not an artery, there was little blood loss and Canning's wound healed completely within a few weeks.\n\n\n== After the duel: public reaction ==\nThe next day, the Morning Chronicle published a detailed account of the duel, as well as an editorial by its editor, a scathing attack on the two protagonists who had behaved irresponsibly at a time of national crisis. The Courier, which unlike the Morning Chronicle was closer to the government than to the Whig opposition, revealed a few days later that the reason for the duel had been the demand for Castlereagh's dismissal. Other newspapers also satirized the duel between \"Mr. Canting\" and \"Lord Castaway,\" while the government initially tried to portray the duel as the result of a misunderstanding. William Wilberforce called the duel disgraceful and demanded that both men never hold office again. Spencer Perceval privately said that Castlereagh had acted out of a complete misunderstanding, while Lord Holland (the nephew of Charles James Fox) said that Castlereagh's behavior was more a sign of a thirst for revenge than a sense of wounded honor. The leading Whig, Charles Grey, saw Castlereagh as being in the right and said that it was impossible to defend Canning's conduct.\nThe majority of public opinion initially thought Canning was right. Castlereagh first justified himself to his closest relatives in the form of a letter. He sent a letter to the King in which he apologized for demanding a duel, but at the same time denied that Canning had any reason to complain about his actions as Minister of War. On October 3, 1809, he also published a vindication, which caused a shift in opinion as Castlereagh was now seen as the victim of a conspiracy by his cabinet colleagues who had secretly plotted against him.\nA friend and Castlereagh loyalist leaked details of the duel and the events leading up to it to the leading British newspaper The Times in early October. Canning responded, also in The Times, with his version in an open letter to Lord Camden, placing some of the blame on Camden. A few days later, King George III was amused to be informed by Canning of all the details of the duel.\n\n\n== Historical impact ==\n\nThe duel had lasting consequences both for the two protagonists and for British politics. Two days before the duel, Spencer Perceval and other cabinet members had concluded that they would either have to bring the leaders of the opposition (Grenville and Grey) into the government or recommend Canning to the king as Portland's successor. With Canning and Castlereagh now on the backbenches, two of the leading politicians had fallen far in public esteem and were outside any discussion of succession. The attempt to include the opposition failed, and Spencer Perceval became the new Prime Minister, forming a new government based around Lord Liverpool as War Secretary and Lord Wellesley as foreign secretary. Castlereagh and Canning spent the next few years out of government; Castlereagh, less driven than Canning, was not unhappy with his exile and enjoyed the inactivity. The restless Canning, on the other hand, found it difficult to come to terms with the frustrating role of backbencher. A first attempt by Perceval in 1812 to bring them both back into government failed when Castlereagh refused and Perceval wanted either both or neither back in the cabinet. Another attempt, after Wellesley's resignation, failed due to Canning's excessive demands; Liverpool, the successor to the assassinated Perceval, then ignored Canning and made Castlereagh Foreign Secretary. Castlereagh held the post until 1822 and played a key role in the political reorganization of Europe after Napoleon's defeat.\n\n\n== Research history ==\nBetween 1929 and 1931, the duel was the subject of a discussion between two distinguished Cambridge historians, Harold Temperley and Charles Webster, in the Cambridge Historical Journal. Webster, who had published a study of Castlereagh's foreign policy, defended Castlereagh. Temperley, Canning's biographer, justified Canning's conduct; he saw the influence of King George III as decisive and Canning as the one really responsible. He cited as evidence George III's letter to Portland in which George III swore Portland to secrecy and forbade Castlereagh to be privy to the discussions.\nThe duel between the two was the subject of a separate book by Giles Hunt in 2008 (The Duel: Castlereagh, Canning and Deadly Cabinet Rivalry). In his conclusion, Hunt noted that the duel ultimately had a positive effect on Castlereagh's political career, citing a ruling by Thomas Creevey in 1818 and explaining that Castlereagh's career was effectively over before the duel, but that the duel rehabilitated him in the eyes of the majority of the public. He also saw Castlereagh's demand for a duel as a partially irrational act.\nIn 2009, John Campbell published his book Pistols at Dawn: Two Hundred Years of Political Rivalry from Pitt and Fox to Blair and Brown. He devoted a chapter to the Castlereagh-Canning rivalry (Viscount Castlereagh and George Canning), describing the duel as the culmination of a political rivalry that spanned the entire political careers of both men. While political duels and political rivalries were and are nothing unusual, he saw the attempt by the two duelists to kill each other against the backdrop of the greatest war in British history to that point as unprecedented. He also referred to Thomas Creevey's judgment and saw Castlereagh as the beneficiary of the duel; without it, Castlereagh's career would have been over. Less driven by ambition than Canning, he had taken the loss of his office in stride.\nIn 2010, the complex interaction between Canning and Castlereagh was taken up by Douglas Hurd in a study of the foreign policy of successive British foreign secretaries; he saw the duel as the result of intense rivalry and ambition. He also noted that the tragedy of the duel was that although Pitt the Younger taught his two talented protégés much about the art of politics, he was never able to bring them together and get them to work together.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nJohn Bew: Castlereagh.

        "content": "The Umi for Change Party (U4C) is a political party in the Solomon Islands. The party was founded in 2022 by Premier of Malaita Province Daniel Suidani.\n\n\n== History ==\nSuidani, a vocal critic of the Sogavare government's switch of diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China and its expansion of ties with the latter, was ousted as premier in 2023 after losing a no-confidence vote, allegedly due to his opposition to the switch. Suidani explained that U4C is a successor to the Malaita Alliance for Rural Advancement government, which he led as premier of Malaita. The Political Parties Commission approved U4C's registration on 9 January 2024; the party subsequently launched a manifesto. One of U4C's key policies included revoking the absolute legal immunity that public officials enjoy. Suidani said this policy was necessary, citing numerous officials allegedly \"hiding behind the law\" and \"making reckless decisions on behalf of the state.\" The party also pledged to address gender inequality and focus on youth-related issues; U4C aimed to establish an education program on employment to decrease youth unemployment. In the election, 2024 Solomon Islands general election, the party won over 10,000 votes and 3% of the national vote share, with one candidate elected to Parliament; Suilea Waneoroa in North Malaita.\n\n\n== Leaders ==\nThe party has the following leadership:\n\nParty Vice President Wendy Vahoe\nSecretary Celsius Talifilu\n\n\n== Policies ==\nThe party supports private sector. They pledge the removing of public officers immunity.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of political parties in the Solomon Islands",

        "content": "The Swiss Union of Arts and Crafts (USAM), (in German Schweizerischer Gewerbeverband SVG, in Italian Unione svizzera delle arti e mestieri USAM, in French Union Suisse des Arts et Métiers USAM) is a Swiss umbrella organization representing the small and medium-sized enterprises of the country.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Swiss Union of Arts and Crafts was founded in 1879 by dissidents from the Swiss Union of Commerce and Industry. Its policy, more conservative than that of the Vorort, included measures to protect the domestic market, particularly important at the end of the 19th century, such as raising customs duties.\n\n\n== Role ==\nUSAM promotes the role of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs, i.e. 10 to 249 employees according to the Federal Statistical Office) in economic growth, and represents their interests in political and economic debates. Politically independent, it advocates, at a federal level, individual responsibility, respect for property rights and freedom of trade and undertaking, as guaranteed by the Federal Constitution. It advocates a modest and efficient state.\nThe USAM presides the Alliance of Economic Circles  for a moderate prevention policy, a Swiss lobby that advocates a conciliatory legislation in terms of health regulations, particularly in the areas of tobacco and alcohol.\n\n\n== Members ==\nUSAM members include cantonal unions of arts and crafts, professional and industry associations and other organizations.\nSome members are large multinational companies, such as the \"Swiss Cigarette\" association comprising Philip Morris International, British American Tobacco and Japan Tobacco International.\n\n\n== Action ==\nThe basis of the action of the Swiss Union of Arts and Crafts is the reduction of legal standards and regulations, the reduction of the tax burden on SMEs and cutting red tape. To this end, the Union is lobbying at the federal level. It has spokespersons in the Federal Parliament, particularly in the Parliamentary Affairs Group, and in the cantons and municipalities.\nThe Union's priority sectors are:\n\nVocational training\nEnergy and environmental policy\nFiscal and financial policy\nPlanning and Transportation\nSocial and labour market policies\nEconomic policy\n\n\n== Energetic and environmental policy ==\nThe Union reaffirmed its demands in this field at the 43rd French-speaking  Arts and Crafts Days organized in Champéry, on 28 and 29 June 2010. It calls for security and self-sufficiency of supply and calls for an increase in energy efficiency, the use of renewable energy and the renewal of existing nuclear power plants to achieve these objectives. It does not oppose the construction of combined gas plants, provided that these do not replace electro-nuclear  power plants.\n\n\n== Planification and transport ==\nThe Union calls for a reduction in the burden on transport  companies and opposes the extension and the increase of the Heavy Vehicle Fee (HVF).\n\n\n== Tax and financial policy ==\nOn 4 February 1992, the Union launched a popular initiative \"For the abolition of direct federal taxation\", supported by the national councillors Philippe Pidoux, Suzette Sandoz, Joseph Iten and Maximilian Reimann, the Vorort, the Patronal Centre, the Vaud League and the National Recovery. The initiative was deposited with the Federal Chancellery on 3 August 1993, with 108,458 signatures. 106,419 of them are declared valid on December 6, 1993. On 13 April 1994, the Federal Council rejected the initiative, considering that it threatened social peace and that the introduction of VAT had already met the Union's wishes. After numerous parliamentary negotiations, the Union withdrew the initiative on 5 December 1996.\nThe Union is in favour of a single rate for Value Added Tax (VAT), but is opposed to vocational training being subject to it. It also calls for a reduction in the burden on SMEs and a simplification of administrative formalities. It calls for an exemption from copyright for SMEs.\n\n\n== Social politics ==\nIn 2007, the Union campaigned against the popular initiative \"For a social and unique health insurance fund\", in which it saw a risk of an increase in social security contributions.\nThe Union participates in debates on old age and survivors' insurance (AHV). Since 2004, it has proposed gradually raising the retirement age to 67 between 2018 and 2030. The increase must be able to ensure an expenditure coverage rate of between 70% and 80%. The Union opposes a reduction in pensions and the abolition of the mandatory nature of the AHV. At the Swiss Congress of Arts and Crafts, held in Lugano on 28 May 2010, it also called for the cost of regulation to be reduced from CHF 50 billion to CHF 10 billion. In order to achieve this objective, the Union requests that a regulatory cost control body be set up.\n\n\n== Organization ==\nThe Swiss Union of Arts and Crafts is the umbrella organization for 266 associations representing small and medium-sized businesses in 2009. These represent a total of 300,000 affiliated companies. It federates the cantonal and the professional sector associations. It is a member of the European Union of Craft, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (UEAPME).\nIts policy and long-term orientations are determined by the Swiss Congress of Arts and Crafts, which brings together about a thousand delegates every two years. The Swiss Chamber of Commerce is its parliament. It has 99 delegates. Its role is to take a stand in political debates and express the Union's opinion on federal legislative proposals. A steering committee of fifteen people implements the Union's policy, so the Bern office manages the day-to-day business.\nThe headquarters of the Swiss Union of Arts and Crafts is in Bern. Management is the responsibility of the Director.\n\n\n== presidents ==\n1879: Louis Troxler\n1880-1882: Friedrich Autenheimer\n1882-1884: Theodor Hoffmann-Merian\n1884-1885: Friedrich Wüest (de)\n1885-1897: Johannes Stössel (en)\n1897-1915: Jakob Scheidegger\n1915-1930: Hans Tschumi (de)\n1930-1941: August Schirmer (en)\n1941-1951: Paul Gysler\n1951-1968: Ulrich Meyer (de)\n1968-1973: Karl Hackhofer\n1973-1982: Rudolf Etter (de)\n1982-1991: Markus Kündig (de)\n1991-2004: Hans-Rudolf Früh\n2004-2010: Eduard Engelberger (de)\n2010-2011: Bruno Zuppiger\nSince 2012: Jean-François Rime (not re-elected to the National Council in the 2019 federal elections)\n\n\n== Directors ==\n1963-1979: Otto Fischer\n1980-1984: Markus Kamber\n1985-1989: Peter Clavadetscher\n1990-2008: Pierre Triponez (de)\nSince 2008: Hans-Ulrich Bigler (de) (not re-elected to the National Council in the federal elections of 2019)\n\n\n== Journal of Arts and Crafts ==\n\nThe Swiss Union of Arts and Crafts publishes the Journal of Arts and Crafts (JAM), in French, and the Schweizerische Gewerbezeitung (SGZ), in German. Together, the two magazines have a print run of 150,000 copies. They are printed by St. Galler Tagblatt AG, and Publicitas Publimag AG is responsible for advertising sales.\nThe Union also operates a bilingual website, which publishes press releases, speeches by its directors and a press review. The Union's communications department is headed by Ruedi Christen.\n\n\n== Events ==\nThe Swiss Union of Arts and Crafts organizes the \"Winter Business Conference\" in Klosters and the\" French-speaking Arts and Crafts Days\" in Champéry, which brings together, under the aegis of the Swiss Foundation of SMEs, representatives of the business community and politicians.\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n=== Related articles ===\nEconomiesuisse\nSwiss Employers' Union\n\n\n==== External links ====\nSite officiel archive",

        "content": "The Battles of Inje and Qalaburun - Military clashes between forces loyal to Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi and the Azerbaijan National Government took place in the villages of Incə and Qalaburun, located between the Tikantəpə and Sayınqala roads, in April 1946.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn late 1944, relations between the USSR and Iran deteriorated. When the Soviet Union was refused the concession of oil, it decided to exploit ethnic grievances in Southern Azerbaijan. As a result, the Azerbaijan Democratic Party (ADP) was formed and declared its establishment on September 3, 1945. From October 2 to 4, 1945, the First Congress of the ADP was held in Tabriz. Elections to the Azerbaijan People's Assembly were held throughout Southern Azerbaijan at the end of November. Simultaneously, actions were taken against the Shah's army, and these army units were neutralized. From December 1 to 19, a significant part of Southern Azerbaijan effectively fell into the hands of the ADP. In December, the People's Congress declared itself the Constituent Assembly, which also elected members of the National Committee. On December 12, the autonomy of Southern Azerbaijan was proclaimed. This process unfolding in Azerbaijan was closely watched and strongly opposed in Tehran.\nWith the start of the process of the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Iran, there was an intensification of contacts between the Azerbaijan National Government (ANG) and the Tehran government. Tehran forces conducted propaganda among the population, urging them not to support the National Government's military service. According to Jamil Hasanli, the Tehran government intended to punish the ANG by taking advantage of the confusion arising from the decision to withdraw Soviet forces from Iran.\n\n\n== Collisions ==\nThe commander of the military detachment of the Azerbaijan National Government  in Maragha, General Azimi, informed Jafar Kavian, the commander of the People's Army of the ANG, in a report dated April 17 that an 800-strong Iranian military detachment had attacked the villages of Inja and Qalaburun between the Tikantepa and Sayinqala roads. This position was defended by Azerbaijan People's Government volunteers. The next day, the reorganized Iranian forces continued their attack until evening. During the four-day clashes, 15 volunteers were killed or wounded. The leader of the ANG, Ja'far Pishevari, became concerned about the ongoing attacks by the Tehran army. He feared that as a result of these attacks, the city of Tabriz, which was the center of the Azerbaijan People's Government, could be threatened. Therefore, he ordered the immediate establishment of previous regulations in these areas. Under his command, additional forces were sent to the locations where the clashes occurred. As a result of the clashes, control over Inja and Qalaburun was restored to the Azerbaijan People's Government. The Iranian army lost 8 personnel during these clashes.\n\n\n== Result ==\nIran's defense minister at the time, Ahmad, presented the clashes in Inja and Qalaburun as an attack by the Azerbaijan Democratic Party (ADP) on the Iranian army. He proposed punishing the democrats. However, Iran's Prime Minister at the time, Qavam as-Saltaneh, was against this approach. He advocated for a comprehensive review of the matter from all sides. According to information obtained by Soviet intelligence agencies, the clash between the democrats and the army was provoked by individuals close to the Shah, such as Ahmadi, Yazdan Panah, Manuchehr Eqbali, Sepehr, and Morteza Bayat, against Qavam. However, as a result of the measures taken by the Azerbaijan People's Government, control over Inja, Miyanbulaq, and Qalaburun villages was restored to Tabriz. Stalin and Molotov, in their correspondence with Mir Jafar Baghirov, wrote:\n\nWe believe that, on the one hand, Qavam wanted to test the defense capabilities of the National Government, and on the other hand, he wanted to encourage hostile forces to disrupt the order within Azerbaijan. Pishevari stated that if necessary, he would continue to resist the Iranian army with the forces of the people's army.\nIn general, Baghirov emphasized the importance of military power in relations with Iran. He believed that without military force, nothing could be achieved.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAzerbaijan People's Government\n[Azerbaijani Democratic Party]\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Oxford Glacier (71°26′31.78″N 25°20′17.88″W) is a glacier in the southern Stauning Alps of East Greenland.  It is located close to the entrance to the Holger Danskes Briller trough and near Stormpynt, on the north shore of Nordvestfjord. On older maps it is referred to as Uranus Glacier. It was named in recognition of the work of the Oxford University Expedition to East Greenland 1962    A party of four (David Sugden, Brian John, Sandy Hall and Svend Wurm) spent part of August 1962 on a reconnaissance survey of the glacier, which at that time was not heavily crevassed apart from one distinct icefall. In their glaciological studies they noticed ice temperature anomalies which were difficult to explain.  They did not know it at the time, but they had discovered some of the earliest evidence of surging behaviour.\nTwo climbing parties, one in 1976 and the other in 2013, found that the glacier was heavily crevassed and impassable in places.  The neighbouring glacier, Løberen, is renowned as one of the fastest-flowing surging glaciers in Greenland.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Visconti Bridge at Valeggio sul Mincio is a medieval viaduct over the Mincio River built at the end of the 14th century by Gian Galeazzo Visconti, Duke of Milan. Initially conceived as a fortified dam to divert the Mincio water flowing to Mantua, it has served as a bridge since then. Today, the ruined central span over the Mincio is replaced by a steel structure.  \n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Gian Galeazzo Visconti's project to deviate the Mincio River and dam's construction (14th century). ===\nIn 1393, when his relationship with Francesco I Gonzaga, lord of Mantua, suffered a crisis, Gian Galeazzo Visconti began building a dam on the Mincio river to divert its water from its natural course. The initial objective of that construction was to dry out the three lakes surrounding Mantua, fed by the Mincio's water. Interrupting the river's flow would have made Mantua defenseless and even uninhabitable.\nIn addition to the dam's construction, the project implied excavating a canal through the hills separating the Mincio from the Adige River, toward which the water would have flown. Despite the enormity of the excavation required for the canal, the Gonzagas and their allies became convinced of Gian Galeazzo's intention to divert the Mincio's water permanently.\nThe canal excavation was probably interrupted in the autumn of 1393 due to a flood of the Mincio, which damaged its initial course. The objective of the complete diversion of the Mincio's water was soon considered unachievable and abandoned. The dam could still represent a means to weaken Mantua's defense by temporarily interrupting water flow toward the three lakes. \nThe dam is 525 metres (1,722 ft) meters long. To resist the pressure of water expected to be collected in the reservoir formed by the Mincio, it is 25 metres (82 ft) meters wide at the base and 22 metres (72 ft) meters wide at the top. Four fortified towers complement the construction. The two outermost towers had a drawbridge to control the dam's access and the passage from one side of the valley to the other. At its base, the dam had four transverse tunnels through which the Mincio water could flow. A mechanism inside the tunnels allowed the interruption of the water flow.   \n\nThe engineer Domenico da Firenze, also known as Domenico di Benintendi di Guidone, led the project. Despite his failure to divert the Mincio, Gian Galeazzo Visconti commissioned him with a similar project a few years later to divert the Brenta River near Bassano del Grappa and deprive Padua of its water. \n\n\n=== Use as a bridge, damages, and reopening as a viaduct in the modern era ===\nThe Visconti's dominion ceased in the 15th century, and the dam project was definitively abandoned. Since then, the dam has been used to cross the Mincio Valley. In 1701, the French blew up the central part, under which the Mincio flowed, to prevent the imperial army under the command of Eugene of Savoy from crossing the Mincio. At the beginning of the 20th century, the demolished section was replaced with a steel structure, and the bridge reopened. \n\n\n== Today ==\nThe bridge's 600th anniversary was celebrated in 1993. Since then, every year, on the third Tuesday in June, a 1.5 km long double row of tables is organized along the entire bridge to celebrate an ample feast called \"Festa del nodo d'amore\" (Party of the Love Knot). \n\n\n== See also ==\nBridge castle\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nBueno de Mesquita, Daniel Meredith (1941).

Matches were played between August 2008 and May 2009.  \n12 teams were originally invited to contested the championship, with Boroughmuir Thistle and Dundee United SC, winners and runners-up respectively in the 2007–08 SWFL First Division (Boroughmuir had completed that season as Dalkeith Thistle), taking the places of Newburgh, who had folded prior to the start of the 2007–08 SWPL leaving the division with 11 teams, and relegated Vale of Clyde. However, Queen's Park withdrew after the 2008–09 campaign started but without having themselves playing a match, so 11 teams again took part.\nGlasgow City won the championship by a margin of two points ahead of Spartans, previously known as Edinburgh Ladies, and three ahead of Celtic (who inflicted their only defeat) to qualify for the 2009–10 UEFA Women's Champions League. It was their second consecutive title, and third overall. With Queen's Park's place already vacated for the following season, the only team to be relegated was Raith Rovers. \nIt was decided that the SWPL would change from a winter to a summer schedule going forwards, so a transitional, shortened campaign with only one round of fixtures was played in the second half of 2009.\n\n\n== League standings ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nResults at Spartans FC Women\nWomen's League Competitions at Scottish Football Historical Archive",

        "content": "Rebellion of the false Ismail Mirza or Rebellion of the false Shah Ismail - also known as the False Ismail Mirza uprising, began in 1578 in the regions of Marash and Bozok by a person who proclaimed himself as II Shah Ismail against Ottoman rule. After the death of Safavid ruler II Shah Ismail, pseudo-Shah Ismails emerged not only within the Safavid territories but also in the Marash and Central Anatolian regions that came under the Ottoman Empire.\nBefore the protests of the False Shah Ismail and his supporters could escalate into a major uprising, they were suppressed by Ottoman soldiers, resulting in the deaths of many Qizilbash Turkmens, and many others fleeing and losing track of them in the process.\n\n\n== The leader of the rebellion ==\nThere is not enough information available in sources about the leader of the uprising. According to a document in the Ottoman archives with the number MD 35-445, it is mentioned that he came from the province of Ajam to Anatolia and started the uprising there. There is no precise information about whether this Ajam territory refers to Arabia or Safavid territories. However, the description of his appearance in the document as \"medium height, blond, and with a short beard, speaking Persian\" increases the likelihood that the mentioned Ajam territory was part of the Safavid state. On the other hand, his being from the Sham Bayadi Turkmen, living a semi-nomadic life in regions such as Raqqa, Konya, Sivas, Nigde, Adana, Aleppo, Tarsus, Bozok, Marash, and Qaraman, and not leaving Anatolia since the mid-16th century, decreases the possibility of him coming from the Safavid state.\nMoreover, the information obtained about the false Shah Ismail generally relates to his characteristics and reflects the Ottoman authority's view of him. For example, in the documents, terms such as \"extremist claiming to be Shah Ismail and his followers\" or \"unfortunate individuals appearing in the name of Shah Ismail\" are used. He and his followers are described as troublemakers and troublemakers, labeled as belonging to a deviant sect, and accused of abandoning religion. As it seems, the documents discussing the uprising briefly mention where the false Shah Ismail came from and describe his qualities, but what is known about his life before and after the rebellion is limited.\n\n\n== The beginning of the rebellion ==\nIn 1578, Ottoman commander Lala Mustafa Pasha left Istanbul with the intention of attacking Georgia and Shirvan, arriving in the city of Sivas. At this time, Zulgadir Beylerbeyi and the Qadi of Elbistan wrote him a letter, informing him that on August 12, a person from the Sham Bayadi Turkmen, claiming to be Shah Ismail, had arrived in Elbistan. He had gathered around 200 cavalrymen and engaged in highway robbery, blocking roads at night in the Marash region. They were primarily aiming to recruit more supporters and headed towards the Ashabi-Kahf in Nakhchivan, where they slaughtered victims. Later, they reported their intention to start the uprising to the Qizilbash leader in Bozok and to Haji Bektash. Upon receiving the letter, Lala Mustafa Pasha sent orders to the Turkmen sanjakbeyi Shah Murad Bey, the Bey of Bozok, Cerkaz Bey, the Bey of Ayntab, Keyvan Bey, and the Bey of Kirsehir, Memi Shah, instructing them to kill the false Shah Ismail and his associates and to suppress the uprising. These orders mentioned that the false Shah Ismail and his associates were disrupting the peace in the region, and it was requested that the Turkmen and administrators in the region move together to ensure the safety of the people and to neutralize other troublemakers as an example.\nDuring this period, the false Shah Ismail was gathering supporters on one side. At the same time, some Qizilbash leaders were being protected by certain communities in the region. Although a letter to Bey of Bozok mentioned that certain groups from the Sham Bayadi community, led by Yunus Xalifa, and from the Pahlivanli community, led by Javshidoghlu, were identified as gathering in a house, they were not handed over to Ottoman soldiers and were protected by their communities.\nThe first confrontation between the parties occurred between Javshidoghlu Huseyn from the false Shah Ismail's followers and the Bey of Bozok. Although Huseyn was captured alive in the initial battle, he was later executed by the order of the Shah. Another battle took place between another Qizilbash leader and Ottoman forces in the Boybeyli plateau. During the preparation for the uprising, a Qizilbash leader named Kose Yunus was captured by the forces of the Bey of Bozok. According to his testimony, the false Shah Ismail had come from the Erciyes province, spent the winter of 1577 in the Emik plains, declared himself as Shah Ismail there, and later ascended to the plateau with the support of the Kemerli and Pahlivanli gatherings of the Yeni-Il Turkmen.\nIn a decree sent to the Bey of Malatya, it appears that some communities in the region provided financial support to the leaders of the uprising. According to the decree, communities named Izlu, Rishvan, Iskanlu, Solaklu, Sheikh Hasanlu, Soysalu, Ayribuklu, Adaklu, Kalacaklu, Bezki, Cakalu, Mihran, Qarasaz, and Komurlu sent alms and pledges to this person who called himself Shah Ismail. This information was later reported to the Shah by a person named Mehmed, one of the rebels sent to his presence.\nDespite the efforts of the governors in the region, it was not possible to capture the false Shah Ismail. In the directive sent to the Bey of Bozok, it was demanded that this person and his followers, whose name was mentioned with Shah Ismail, be captured wherever they were found, serving as an example to other rebels. Indeed, the persistent pursuit by Ottoman forces yielded results. For instance, the vizier of the false Shah Ismail, Khan Piri, was taken captive. According to the information provided by him, Shah Ismail left Bozok with three hundred Qizilbash Turkmen towards a village called Adana, arrived at the camp of Ciyelioglu, stayed there for a few days, and then went to Erguvan. During his stay there, with the support of the communities of Rishvan, Bezki, and Cihanbeyli, and the followers he gathered, they clashed with Malatya, resulting in a major confrontation between them and Abdikendu, one of the men of the Malatya judge, in the village of Almali. Many of Shah Ismail's men were killed in this confrontation, while others fled. Shah Ismail and his men crossed the Euphrates River and headed towards Siverik. After this incident, his name is not encountered again in the sources.\n\n\n== See also ==\nŞahkulu rebellion\nNur-Ali Khalifa\n\n\n== References ==",

It is led by a collective leadership. Vanya Grigorova and Maya Manolova were the primary figures in the foundation of the alliance.\n\n\n== History ==\nFollowing Grigorova's strong performance in the 2023 Sofia mayoral election, there was speculation she might have broken away from the BSP and form her own political party to run in the next election.\nIn April 2024, there were negotiations between several leftist parties to form the electoral coalition in time for the 2024 European and parliamentary elections. Grigorova, alongside 3 leftist parties, officially formed the coalition. The coalition shares its name with a leftist group Grigorova was a founding member of in the early 2010s.\n\n\n== Composition ==\nThe coalition registered on 23 April 2024, ahead of the 2024 European and parliamentary elections. They were primarily formed between the ex-BSP politician Grigorova and the IS.BG leader Manolova. Two smaller parties, Bulgarian Left and United Social Democracy, were also registered under the coalition.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

Like his elder brother Raymond, an Ireland cricket and rugby dual-international, Hunter represented Ulster in both sports. He was a fast bowler and played for the Lisburn Cricket Club.\nHunter, a centre, played his rugby with Belfast club Civil Service. He won two Ireland caps, debuting against Wales in the 1968 Five Nations. His other cap came later that year in Ireland's win over the touring Wallabies at Lansdowne Road.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Ireland national rugby union players\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLawrence Hunter at ESPNscrum",

        "content": "Beit Qufa (Arabic: بيت قوفا) is an archaeological site in the Lod Valley, near the modern Israeli settlement of Beit Nehemia in Israel's Central District.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe site of Beit Qufa was inhabited since antiquity. Salvage excavations revealed settlement remainsfrom the Middle Bronze Age I, in addition to a settlement, a bathhouse, terraces and a lime-kiln from the Byzantine and Early Islamic periods (Umayyad and Abbasid periods).\nThe village of Beit Qufa was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517 with all of Palestine. In 1596 it appeared in the tax registers as being in the nahiya (\"subdistrict\") of Ramla, which was under the administration of the liwa (\"district\") of Gaza. It had a population of 16 households who were all Muslims. They paid a fixed tax-rate of 25% on agricultural products, including wheat, barley,  summer crops,  goats and beehives, in addition to occasional revenues; a total of 4,100 akçe. All of the revenue went to a waqf dedicated to the Cave of the Patriarchs.\nIn the 17th century, the village of Bayt Qūfā was abandoned due to unsettled conditions, and its residents scattered between Bayt Nabala and the villages of ‘Ajjūl and ‘Arūra near Ramallah.  \nDuring the 18th and 19th centuries, the area around Beit Qufa now belonged to the Nahiyeh (sub-district) of Lod that encompassed the area of the present-day city of Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut in the south to the present-day city of El'ad in the north, and from the foothills in the east, through the Lod Valley to the outskirts of Jaffa in the west. This area was home to thousands of inhabitants in about 20 villages, who had at their disposal tens of thousands of hectares of prime agricultural land. \nAccording to Marom, local tradition holds that sometime during the 18th century, a Yaman immigrant from the Khuzā‘a tribe, named Salām b. Ḥarfūsh, came to the vicinity of Bayt Nabālā and camped in the caves near the village and Bayt Qūfā. When a conflict broke out between Bayt Nabala and al-Ḥadītha, Salām took advantage of the plight of the residents of Bayt Nabālā to gain control over them, and his three “sons” – Zayd, Nakhla and Ṣāfī – settled in the Bayt Nabala. The lands of Beit Qufa were than subsumed by the village of Beit Nabala.\n\n\n== References ==",

He gained fame as main author on the long-awaited 2019 paper \"An Ancient Harappan Genome Lacks Ancestry from Steppe Pastoralists or Iranian Farmers,\" on DNA-research on a skeleton from Rakhigarhi which shows that the people of the Indus Valley Civilisation had no steppe (Indo-Aryan) genetic ancestry, in line the Indo-Aryan migration theory. The day after the publication Shinde publicly endorsed the Out of India theory, thereby rejecting the conclusions of his own paper.\n\n\n== Rakhigarhi DNA ==\nShinde gained fame as main author on the long-awaited 2019 paper \"An Ancient Harappan Genome Lacks Ancestry from Steppe Pastoralists or Iranian Farmers,\" which concluded that the IVC-people lacked ancestry from Anatolia and the steppes, in line with the Indo-Aryan migration theory, which argues that the Indo-Aryan Vedic people migrated into South Asia after the height of the Indus Valley Civilisation, in the period of ca. 1900-1500 BCE.\nShinde et al. (2019) states that the presence of Anatolian farmer-related ancestry in South Asians today \"is consistent with [it] being entirely derived from Steppe pastoralists who carried it in mixed form and who spread into South Asia from 2000–1500 BCE (Narasimhan et al., 2019).\" The paper further states that \"a natural route for Indo-European languages to have spread into South Asia is from Eastern Europe via Central Asia in the first half of the 2nd millennium BCE, a chain of transmission that did occur as has been documented in detail with ancient DNA.\"\nNevertheless, in deviance from his own publication, in a press conference held at September 6, 2019, to explain their findings, Vasant Shinde and Niraj Rai endorsed the Oud of India theory, rejecting the idea that the Vedic people had migrated into South Asia at the time of the decline of the Harappan civilisation. As Shinde stated, \"the Vedic era that followed [the IVC] was a fully indigenous period with some external contact.\"\nAccording to journalist Hartosh Singh Bal, \"the claim that the Harappans were the Vedic people \"betrays the very research that underlies the two papers. To believe this, the authors would have to discredit their own papers.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nIndo-European migrations\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nPrinted sources\n\nWeb-sources",

        "content": "Vijay Anand (died 6 February 2024) was an Indian composer who worked in South Indian films, mainly Tamil and Kannada.\n\n\n== Career ==\nVijay Anand was originally a composer for Visu's stage plays. He debuted in film with the Tamil film Oorukku Upadesam (1984), and went to score for more Tamil films including Naanayam Illatha Naanayam (1984), Naan Adimai Illai (1986), Kavalan Avan Kovalan (1987), Vetri Mel Vetri (1989) and Rasathi Varum Naal (1991). Naan Adimai Illai remains Vijay Anand's best known Tamil film. He was, however, more prolific in Kannada cinema, where he composed for over 180 films. After a point, his success derailed as he received no further opportunities in the film industry. He also composed the music for two English-language albums.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nVijay Anand was married to Amali, and the two have a daughter. He died in Chennai on 6 February 2024, at age 71, following health issues since December 2023.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVijay Anand at IMDb",

        "content": "In computer science, the matrix mortality problem (or mortal matrix problem) is a decision problem that asks, given a finite set of n×n matrices with integer coefficients, whether the zero matrix can be expressed as a finite product of matrices from this set.\nThe matrix mortality problem is known to be undecidable when n ≥ 3. In fact, it is already undecidable for sets of 6\nmatrices (or more) when n = 3, for 4 matrices when n = 5, for 3 matrices when n = 9, and for 2 matrices when n = 15.\nIn the case n = 2, it is an open problem whether matrix mortality is decidable, but several special cases have been solved: the problem is decidable for sets of 2 matrices, and for sets of matrices which contain at most one invertible matrix.\n\n\n== Notes ==",

        "content": "Eusebia Feliciana \"Sabina\" Fernandes (born Eusebia Feleciana Pereira; born 13 August 1946) is an Indian actress, singer, theatrical producer, and theatre director known for her work in Konkani films and tiatr productions.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nFernandes was born as Eusebia Feleciana Pereira on 13 August 1946 in the village of Cortalim, Goa, which was part of Portuguese India during the Portuguese Empire (now in India). She was born to a Goan tailor, Jaime Colombano Pereira, and homemaker Severina Maria Rodrigues, who hailed from the port city of Mangalore, then part of the Madras Presidency in British India (now Karnataka, India), into a Catholic family. In her youth, she was commonly referred to as \"Saibin\" (transl. Lady), a term of endearment that evolved into the nickname \"Sabina.\" Despite being born in Goa, she received her education in Bombay, which was part of Bombay State (now Mumbai, Maharashtra, India). During her early years of education, she enjoyed engaging in activities such as music, dance, and drama as her preferred hobbies.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1960, Fernandes seized a significant opportunity in the theatrical realm when she secured a prominent role in the English play Scattered Feathers. Her acting abilities elicited acclaim and admiration from several individuals. During this theater performance, Master Vaz, a then-well-known personality in the tiatr industry, discovered Fernandes and offered her a significant role in his tiatr play called Bapui (Father). Residing in Juhu, Bombay, at the time, Fernandes eagerly embraced this initial opportunity within the tiatr domain. Her performance in Bapui proved transformative, propelling her to attain eminence as one of the most sought-after actresses on the tiatr stage. While Fernandes has graced the tiatr scene with her acting prowess in various productions, she remains etched in the memories of tiatr aficionados for her unforgettable portrayals in John Claro's Portuguez Kolvont (Portuguese Artist) and Aristides Dias' Divors (Divorce). In Portuguez Kolvont, Fernandes delivered a performance that significantly contributed to the success of the tiatr. This particular performance made history by running for more than 100 shows, establishing a record during that period.

Collaborating with a diverse range of singers throughout her career, Fernandes garnered acclaim for her musical prowess. However, it was her duets alongside her husband, Greg de Candolim, that truly captivated the tiatr audience, earning popularity and high demand. These duets were distinguished by their clever wit, comedic flair, and have become cherished within the tiatr fraternity, leaving a mark on its history. In addition to her musical achievements, Fernandes has also made contributions to the world of acting.

Nirantar published Pitara, a Hindi feminist magazine (1994–2010), writing simply for neo-literate readers in India's rural hinterland.\nNirantar also started Mahila Dakiya, a rural newspaper run by women from marginalised communities, which in 2002 became Khabar Lahariya. The all-women teams of both Mahila Dakiya and Khabar Lahariya won the Chameli Devi award for Excellence in Journalism in 1996 and 2004 respectively. Writing with Fire, a film on the women journalists of Khabar Lahariya, was nominated for an Oscar in 2022.\nFarah Naqvi lead a study for the BBC World Service Trust called ‘Images and Icons’ on using mass media to reduce Sex Selection.  And as NAC member, she continued to push for policy interventions for a wholistic and women's rights approach to the issue of sex selection.\nShe has worked for over three decades on the issue of sexual and domestic violence against women. She co-authored the Survivors Speak (2002), a fact finding that focussed on the impact the Gujarat 2002 violence had on Muslim women. And was a member of the International Initiative for Justice (2003), a global panel of gender experts, which produced Threatened Existence: A Feminist analysis of the long-term impact of this violence against women. In 2013, following national outrage about sexual violence in the wake of the Nirbhaya case, Farah Naqvi was an active part of a group of feminists from the women's movement who contributed to the Criminal Law Amendment Act 2013 (which changed India's rape laws). [][]\n\n\n=== Minority Rights ===\nFarah Naqvi made significant contributions to minority rights in India, including rights of minority women. She provided gender inputs into the work of the seminal Sachar Committee Report (2006), which noted her contribution and was a member of the Kundu Committee (Post-Sachar Evaluation), which submitted its report to the Government in 2014.\nAs a member of the Planning Commission Steering Committee on Empowerment of Minorities (2011–12), she pushed for greater outlays. She also designed and proposed a Central Scheme for the leadership development of minority women, modelled on the Mahila Samakha (MS) programme, and based on her own early experiences of working in Mahila Samakhya. The scheme was rolled out as Nai Roshni: The Scheme for leadership development for Minority Women in 2012–13.\n\n\n=== Internally Displaced People ===\nShe has worked extensively on the issue of post-conflict internal displacement through direct work with IDPs, writing, fact-finding, and policy advocacy.\nFarah Naqvi brought together 3 partners (Sadbhavna Trust, Vanangana and Hunnarshala Foundation) for a pilot rehabilitation project for internally displaced people after the Muzaffarnagar riots. From 2013 to 2016, they built two housing colonies, designed by the survivors themselves. This initiative was hailed as the first of its kind in India.\n\n\n=== Syncretic Traditions ===\nFarah Naqvi also speaks about and anchors performances based on India’s syncretic and pluralistic cultural traditions.\n\n\n== Films ==\nIn 2017 she made The Colour of My Home (In collaboration with the Srishti Institute of Art, Design and Technology, Bangalore. Co-director, Sanjay Barnela), a film set in Muzaffarnagar after the 2013 violence, following the lives of survivors especially women, violently displaced from their homes and ancestral villages. How do they rebuild new homes and lives, with hearts unable to leave the old one behind? The film is about the idea of home. About remembering and loss. About the power of hope and the will to survive. It was screened at film festivals across India.\n\n\n== Books ==\nWaves in the Hinterland. (2008) (Zubaan Publications, New Delhi. Distributed by Cambridge University Press). A book about Dalit women journalists, rural journalism and empowerment through the stories of Mahila Dakiya and Khabar Lahariya, two award-winning rural newspapers.

        "content": "The Fair Start Movement is a children's rights movement that advocates for equity-based birth entitlements to improve the environmental and social conditions into which children are born - using metrics like the Children's Rights Convention. The movement considers these entitlements a fundamental condition of self-determination, the basis for political legitimacy. Proposed investments include incentives for fertility delay, baby bonds, and climate migration funds to assist families relocating to safer areas that will be less impacted by the climate crisis.\nThe concept of birth entitlements merges the objectives and goals of social justice, reproductive justice, and environmental justice, with their amount, use, and prioritization informed by concrete metrics centered on children's rights.\n\n\n== Legal Theory ==\nThe Fair Start Movement operates from the Zero Baseline Model, which suggests that theories of legitimacy and political obligation should prioritize intergenerational birth equity. This involves raising children according to principles that allow them to negotiate the terms of any social contract as free and equal individuals, rather than focusing solely on abstract considerations.\n\n\n== See also ==\nChildren's Rights Movement\nConvention on the Rights of the Child\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights\nSteady State Economy\nRewilding (conservation biology)\nInternational Conference on Population and Development\nIntergenerational Equity\nCycle of Poverty\nEconomic inequality\nSustainable Development Goals\nUniversal Basic Income\nhuman right to a healthy environment.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Subtara (Arabic: سبتارة) is an archaeological site in the Lod Valley, near the modern Israeli settlement of Yagel in Israel's Central District.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe site has been inhabited since ancient times, and its name is of non-Semitic extraction.\nArchaeological excavations discovered the remains of a Mamluk settlement dating to the 13th and 14th centuries.\nSubtara was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517 with all of Palestine. In 1552, Subtara was an inhabited village. Haseki Hürrem Sultan, the favorite wife of Suleiman the Magnificent, endowed its tax revenues to her Haseki Sultan Imaret in Jerusalem. Administratively, the village belonged to the Sub-district of Ramla in the District of Gaza.\nIn 1596 it appeared as a large village in the tax registers under the name of SVbtara, as being in the nahiya (\"subdistrict\") of Ramla, which was under the administration of the liwa (\"district\") of Gaza. It had a population of 123 households who were all Muslims. They paid a fixed tax-rate of 33,3 % on agricultural products, including wheat, barley,  summer crops,  sesame, vineyards, fruit trees,  goats and beehives, in addition to occasional revenues; a total of 19,100 akçe. All of the revenue went to a Waqf. Archaeological excavations found settlement remains from this period, including walls, floors, cooking ovens and a rich ceramic repertoire. \nIn 1051 AH/1641/2, the Bedouin tribe of al-Sawālima from around Jaffa attacked the villages of Subtara, Bayt Dajan, al-Sāfiriya, Jindas, Lydda and Yazur belonging to Waqf Haseki Sultan. Under nomadic pressures, Subṭāra was abandoned and its residents moved to Kafr 'Ana, than a minor and insignificant hamlet.\nDuring the 18th and 19th centuries, the area around Subtara now belonged to the Nahiyeh (sub-district) of Lod that encompassed the area of the present-day city of Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut in the south to the present-day city of El'ad in the north, and from the foothills in the east, through the Lod Valley to the outskirts of Jaffa in the west. This area was home to thousands of inhabitants in about 20 villages, who had at their disposal tens of thousands of hectares of prime agricultural land. The lands of Subtara were subsumed by the village of al-Safiriyya.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Herbert Hess (16 June 1908 in Frankfurt, German Empire – 31 October 1977) was a German classical singer, an operatic tenor and university professor. He performed in operas, operettas and later focussed on sacred music. His debut in UK took place in 1954.\n\n\n== Family ==\n\nHe was the fourth-born of five children of the German-Jewish merchant Leopold Hess (16 December 1863 in Frankfurt – 1 November 1918) and his Christian wife Eugenie (2 August 1870 – 2 January 1930), née Wolf. Herbert had three older siblings, Mathilde (1 August 1894 in Frankfurt – 5 February 1957), Alfred (* ? in Frankfurt; † 1970 as Alfredo Hess Wolf in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain), Richard (10 October 1896 in Frankfurt – 10 August 1918 near Fransart, department Somme, France) and a younger brother, Helmut (3 June 1910 in Frankfurt – 30 January 1972 in Mainz, Rhineland-Palatinate).\nHerbert's youth had been significantly influenced by the World War I as well as the economic shortage of the post-war years, hyperinflation and Great Depression.\nA first hard turning point was the death of his older brother Richard, who was shot on guard in France near Fouquescourt by a British sharpshooter in the last weeks of the war at the age of 21. Shortly after, the family's father also died early at the age of 54.\nAfter elementary school, Hess attended Klinger School in Frankfurt's borough Nordend.\nThe family's only daughter, Mathilde, received her philosophical doctorate in 1924 and later contributed significantly to the preservation and well-being of the family as a secondary teacher at Frankfurt's girl's school Herder School in Frankfurt's borough Ostend for German, French and Protestant religion.\nThe youngest son Helmut was severely disabled due to polio and therefore ultimately dependent on a wheelchair for decades.\nHerbert received his singing and piano training at the Hoch Conservatory in the era of Bernhard Sekles.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 1930–1945 ===\n\nHerbert Hess was engaged at German theatres until around the mid-1930s; engagements in Kolberg in 1932 and Gotha in 1933 are documented, for example. He met the contralto Marie Maurer (* 23 June 1907 in Münzenberg; † 30 July 1971 in Frankfurt), both married. At the time of his engagement in Gotha, Marie and Herbert Hess's only child, Kurt Herbert \"Herbie\" (1933–2015), was born.\nThird Reich had a direct impact on the family; Nazi authorities issued professional bans, first in 1933 for Herbert Hess's older sister, Mathilde, the teacher in public service. This way she also lost all rights to pensions and insurance.\nAs a result, the children of the family suddenly became aware of the Jewish roots of their late father Leopold, as family life was affected by Christianity, here Lutheran.\nHerbert Hess sympathized with the opposition movement Confessing Church, particularly with the views of Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Helmut Gollwitzer and Martin Niemöller.\nFrom around 1935/36, Hess was no longer allowed to appear on German stages, and in 1935 he was excluded from the Reich Theater Chamber, a subdivision of Reich Chamber of Culture. Therefore, he initially switched to the second largest theater of Czechoslovakia, to Teplice, under the aegis of Carl Richter (1870–1943).\nHowever, due to Munich Agreement the German Wehrmacht invaded Sudetenland at the beginning of October 1938, so the option to perform on stage in Teplice was also taken away from him.\nThe Nazis fundamentally destroyed Herbert Hess's early operatic career as a tenor by discriminating and classifying him as a Half-Jew (with two Jewish grandparents on his father's side), since the professional ban lasted for a singer's normally essential creative years.\nDuring WWII he was not drafted into the fighting troops, but still required to serve. In Erfurt he received an artillery training until Wehrmacht became aware of his status as a Half-Jew. Therefore, he got dismissed from service. Hess found this humiliating and defamatory.\nWhile the war continued, Herbert Hess worked as a representative for fine leather goods to secure his and his family's livelihood. In the last phase of the war, he was called up as an industrial worker in Butzbach.\n\n\n=== 1945–1973 ===\n\nIn 1946, Hess was offered a contract by Südwestfunk (SWF) to appear as a vocal interpreter for the radio station and to take part in archive productions. During this phase there was a tour around the Mediterranean, which was completed by cruise ship.\nAt the end of the 1940s he took part in recordings for Radio Frankfurt (later: Hessischer Rundfunk).\nAt the beginning of the 1950s, for example, he appeared for the Bonn Bach Community in the Christmas Oratorio and St John Passion under the direction of Gustav Classens.\nFinally, he was very successful under the aegis of Kurt Thomas with the Frankfurt Dreikönigs-Kantorei (later: Frankfurter Kantorei) in and abroad in concerts, a large number of recordings with Hess were made in the 1950s. He developed an intense inner connection to concert church music.\n\nChristmas Story by Heinrich Schütz: The narrative, already allotted to a tenor, is beautifully declaimed by Herbert Hess and the other solists sing well. (...) St. John Passion: Here Herbert Hess's contribution is of quite outstanding excellence. It is a pleasure to hear the narrative sung as though by a story-teller who is excited and moved by what he has to tell, and not in the slow, hieratic manner so often adopted in English performances.\nHess worked artistically alongside Kurt Thomas and many others like Heinrich Bensing, Helene Bindhardt, Maud Cunitz, Hans Dahmen, Diana Eustrati, Betina Feit-Brucker, Karl Friedrich, Rudolf Gonszar, Willy Hofmann, Aga Joesten, Karl Kronenberg, Gisela Litz, Jean Löhe, Christa Ludwig, Maria Madlen Madsen, Arnold van Mill, Olga Moll, Aage Poulsen, Heinz Prybit, Otto von Rohr, Helge Rosvaenge, Heinrich Schlusnus, Paul Schmitz, Erik Schumann, Frithjof Sentpaul, Georg Stern, Else Tegetthoff, Günther Treptow, Elfride Trötschel and Helmut Walcha. He admired the artistic performances of Schlusnus and Walcha as well as those of Joseph Schmidt and Fritz Wunderlich.\nHess went on musical tours to France, Italy and Spain.\nAfter completing his active time as a tenor, Herbert Hess taught as a vocal training lecturer until his retirement at Frankfurt University of Music and Performing Arts under the aegis of Philipp Mohler (1908–1982) and at University of Mainz, later as a professor.\nA collegial friendship connected him with the lecturer for vocal training at Hoch Conservatory, Herbert Champain (actually: Herbert Czempin, born on 31 March 1907 in Frankfurt; deceased on 14 March 1992) and the professor for piano, music theory and organ music, Wilhelm Baither (a scholar of Helmut Walcha), from the University of Music and Performing Arts Frankfurt am Main. Through Champain he met his wife Charlotte Landé (1890–1977).\n\n\n=== 1973–1977 ===\nIn 1973 Herbert Hess became emeritus. He had great respect for contemporaries like German actor Hans Söhnker because of their humane attitude during the Nazi dictatorship. He was familiar with the Hessian secretary of state Heinz-Herbert Karry (1920–1981) as they lived just two houses away from each other.\nHis hobbies were philately and photography, which he had practiced since his youth. Since the end of the 1950s he had been active in slide photography with his Leica M2 rangefinder camera.\nIn addition to a high degree of artistic and musical understanding, he is described as a person who was always correct, very reliable, subtle, highly sensitive, warm-hearted and extremely caring, who enjoyed high-quality, precisely crafted things. He was considered to be excellently organized both privately and professionally and was highly respected and even revered by many.\nHe died unexpectedly of heart failure in the early morning of October 31, 1977, and was buried in the family grave in Frankfurt's Main cemetery.\n\n\n== Literature ==\nFrithjof Trapp, Bärbel Schrader, Dieter Wenk, Ingrid Maass: Biographisches Lexikon der Theaterkünstler, Vol. 2.

        "content": "Guillermo Gallego is an American data scientist, academic and author. He is the Liu Family Emeritus professor at Columbia University, the Crown Worldwide Professor Emeritus at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and is the X.Q. Deng Presidential Chair Professorship at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen.\nGallego is most known for his works on discrete choice models, dynamic pricing, pricing analytics, assortment optimization and dynamic programming. Among his authored works are his publications in academic journals, including  Management Science, Operations Research, Mathematics of Operations Research, and MSOM, as well as a book titled Revenue Management and Pricing Analytics. He is the recipient of two best-papers awards from Management Science and Operations Research, the 2011 INFORMS Historical Award of the Revenue Management & Pricing Section, the 2012 INFORMS Practice Award, the 2016 INFORMS Impact Prize, the 2021 INFORMS Revenue Management and Pricing Section Prize among others.\nGuillermo has been elected as an INFORMS fellow in the class of 2012 and an MSOM fellow in the class of 2013.\n\n\n== Education ==\nGallego completed his B.A. in Mathematics from the University of California in 1980. Later in 1987, he obtained his M.S. from Cornell University, followed by a PHD from the same institution in 1988.\n\n\n== Career ==\nGallego began his academic career at Columbia University in 1988, holding various positions within the Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, promoted to full professor in 2000, and to the Liu Family Professorship in 2012. Additionally, from 2016 to 2022, he served as the Crown Worldwide Professor of Engineering at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. Since 2022, he is the holder of the X.Q. Deng Presidential Chair Professorship at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen.\nGallego served as the department head of the Department of Industrial Engineering and Decision Analytics at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology from 2016 to 2021. Moreover, he serves as the Operations Research Area Coordinator in the School of Data Science at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen.\n\n\n== Research ==\nGallego, in his early research, explored how companies could smoothly recover from production schedule disruptions, and on integrating inventory control and vehicle routing to optimize distribution systems. His 1993 collaborative work presented a new proof of Scarf's ordering rule for the newsboy problem and extended its analysis to scenarios in inventory management, including the recourse case, fixed ordering costs, random yields, and multi-item competition for scarce resources. In the following year, he proposed dynamic pricing strategies for inventory management in industries with time-constrained sales, stochastic and price-sensitive demand, using intensity control, obtaining structural monotonicity, closed-form solutions, and extensions to more complex scenarios. Moreover, in 1995, he addressed the optimization of pricing strategies for industries facing fixed stock and finite horizon challenges. The study determined the optimal timing of mark-ups or mark-downs based on stochastic demand and price sensitivity to maximize revenues.\nGallego's 1997 work proposed stochastic pricing strategies to optimize network revenue management problems, deriving asymptotic optimality results for simple policies. In 2001, he explored optimal inventory control policies, such as state-dependent (s, S) and base-stock policies, considering advance demand information, aiming to improve revenue, capacity use, and operational performance in stochastic inventory systems. In 2008, he explored the strategic use of callable products, analyzing their role in generating riskless additional revenue in the context of revenue management problems. Through this research, he also provided optimal pricing and booking strategies, with potential extensions to multifare structures, network models, and other industries. While investigating the assortment optimization problems under the nested logit model in 2014, he demonstrated that the problem is polynomial solvability for the standard model, and proposed heuristic strategies for NP-hard cases. Later in 2016, he introduced a Markov chain choice model for assortment planning, approximating discrete choice models, optimizing assortments, and offering insights into substitution behavior.\nIn 2019, Gallego authored a book titled Revenue Management and Pricing Analytics with H. Topaloglu. Through this book, he bridged the disparity between current research findings and well-established literature within the field. Georgia Perakis from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in her review of the book said \"The book by Gallego and Topaloglu provides a fresh, up-to-date and in depth treatment of revenue management and pricing. It fills an important gap as it covers not only traditional revenue management topics but also new and important topics such as revenue management under customer choice as well as pricing under competition and online learning.\" She also lauded the book's ability to cater to a diverse range of readers, from advanced undergraduates to those pursuing masters and PhD degrees. In 2022, he presented a learning algorithm for a firm to optimize revenue through personalized pricing for various consumer types over a finite selling period, using a primal-dual formulation to explicitly learn the dual optimal solution and overcoming the curse of dimensionality. His more recent work has focused on personalized pricing and personalized assortment optimization.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n2005-2006 – IBM Faculty award\n2011 – INFORMS Revenue Management and Pricing Historical Prize, INFORMS\n2012 – Fellow, INFORMS\n2017 – INFORMS, Best OM paper award in Management Science\n2019 – INFORMS, Best OM paper in Operations Research\n2021 – INFORMS Revenue Management and Pricing Section Prize, INFORMS\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Books ===\nRevenue Management and Pricing Analytics (2019) ISBN 9781493996049\n\n\n=== Selected articles ===\nGallego, G., & Van Ryzin, G.

        "content": "Marcus Jacob Papilaja (born 22 September 1954) is an Indonesian academic and politician of the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle who served as the mayor of Ambon, Maluku for two terms between 2001 and 2011. His mayoral tenure began as the Maluku sectarian conflict wracked Ambon, and he contributed to the reconciliation between Muslim and Christian groups in the city. He was sentenced for corruption in 2014, and was imprisoned for one year.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nPapilaja was born in Suli, in Ambon Island but part of Central Maluku Regency, on 22 September 1954. He studied at an elementary school in Suli, then at economic middle and high schools in Ambon City. He graduated from high school in 1973 and later received a bachelor's degree in economics from University of Pattimura in 1978. He received another bachelors, in accounting, from Makassar's Hasanuddin University in 1982. He later also received a master's in accounting from Gadjah Mada University and a doctorate from the Bogor Agricultural Institute.\n\n\n== Career ==\nPapilaja began lecturing at Pattimura in 1982, and continued to do so until 2010. He also lectured at the Indonesian Christian University Maluku and at Pelita Harapan University. In 1999, Papilaja was elected into Ambon's Regional House of Representatives (DPRD) as an Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle member, becoming the speaker of the legislature. In 2001, the DPRD elected him as mayor, with United Development Party legislator Syarief Hadler as deputy.\nAmbon was suffering from religious violence as Papilaja was sworn into office, as part of the ongoing sectarian conflict in the province. In order to end the violence, Papilaja met national leaders, foreign NGO representatives and United Nations officials to involve them in the peace process. Within the city government, he pushed for Muslim and Christian employees to mix – due to prior violence, employees had been self-segregating on religious lines. Another policy of Papilaja was to establish ad hoc markets guarded by security officers to replace markets which were destroyed in the violence, which also promoted commercial activity across religious lines. With the help of the Ministry of Home Affairs. Papilaja also approached Jafar Umar Thalib, commander of the Muslim militia Laskar Jihad active in Ambon. By 2002, Papilaja had managed to convince Thalib to accept the Malino II Accord and to disband Laskar Jihad in exchange for guarantees that Christians would not attack Muslim neighborhoods.\nPapilaja also introduced fit and proper tests for leadership positions in the city government, reducing accusations of preferences in the selection of officials. As the situation in Ambon calmed down, the city government began to take part in the development of regions of Ambon Island outside the city's jurisdiction. It also sponsored sports events to improve interreligious relations and repatriated refugees who had fled the city. Papilaja was reelected for a second term in the direct mayoral election of 2006, winning 52,195 votes (36.1%) in a four-way race. Richard Louhenapessy was elected to replace him in 2011.\nDuring the 2009 presidential election, Papilaja joined the campaign team of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, against PDI-P's candidate Megawati Sukarnoputri.\n\n\n== Post-mayoralship ==\nPapilaja was arrested by the provincial police in December 2012 under charges of corruption related to a municipal purchase of burial land. He was sentenced to one year in prison on 28 October 2014 by the Ambon District Court. He remained active in Ambonese politics, campaigning for a candidate in the 2017 mayoral election. He also continued to lecture, moving to Matana University in Tangerang in 2016.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nPapilaja is married to Risakotta, and the couple has two children. Papilaja is a Protestant Christian, and a member of the Protestant Church of Maluku. He is also active in the Indonesian Amateur Boxers' Association.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Leslie Wylde (nicknamed 'Anzie') (1893–1935) was an ex-army officer from New Zealand, who, under the patronage of Frank Schuster, associated with a large group of leading English artists, composers and poets in the 1920s.\n\nWylde enlisted with the New Zealand Army in 1914 and saw action in the Gallipoli campaign where he lost a leg and was invalided to England. There, he met Schuster, who offered Wylde the hospitality of \"The Hut\", his country estate in Bray, Berkshire, where he befriended (among others) Siegfried Sassoon (who chronicled some of Wylde's activity), Edward Elgar, Robert Nichols and Glyn Philpot.\nAfter spells abroad, in France and back in New Zealand, Wylde rejoined Schuster's circle, where he met artist Wendela Boreel, whom he married in 1924. He and Boreel moved into an extension of The Hut, renamed at Wylde's suggestion as \"The Long White Cloud\" (a translation of Aotearoa, the Māori name for New Zealand). When Schuster died in 1927 he left the estate to Wylde and Boreel.\nA son, James Paxton de Eglesfield Wylde, was born in 1927.\nWylde died suddenly in May 1935, at the age of 41.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Myra Ah Chee or Kanakiya Myra Ah Chee (born 13 April 1932) is a Southern Aranda (Pertame) and Luritja woman who was born at Oodnadatta in South Australia. She is an artist, interpreter and translator, storyteller and author. In 2021 published her autobiography Nomad Girl: my life on the Gibber Plains and beyond which was cowritten (told by) Linda Rive.\nShe is the granddaughter of Charlie Apma and the niece of Undelya (Minnie) Apma.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nAh Chee is the daughter of Molly Niningaya and Dick Taylor Junior (an Aboriginal man who worked with Afghan cameleers in Australia) and she was born at the Australian Inland Mission Hospital at Oodnadatta. She was named after Sister Myra, the nursing sister there, who delivered her. She spent her early years living in a watuti (lean-to) on the fringes of the township with her family with her siblings. Starting at the age of 7 Ah Chee began attending the United Aborigines Mission (UAM) Church School in Oodnadatta and to 'ensure' that the children would be nice clean and tidy when they attended lessons she lived there from around 1939 to 1940; her parents were only living a short distance away.\nAh Chee's time at the UAM school ended abruptly in 1940 when she ran away from the home when the male missionary there was to bath her and she ran away; she said of this:\n\nNormally I would enjoy a both, but what we didn't like about it this time was that it was the man giving the little girls a bath, and the lady giving the boys a bath. We were just little girls, and we were shy about that sort of thing. We didn't like the man bathing us. It does seem a bit inexplicable, a bit strange, even today.\nWhen she returned home and the missionary came to bring her back she refused to return.\nIn October 1940 Ah Chee's mother died, after unsuccessful treatment in Port Augusta in which her arm was amputated, and her cause of death was likely cancer. After her death the family decided to leave Oodnadatta and return to her father Dick Taylors traditional country in the Northern Territory. They travelled there on her fathers camels and took what Ah Chee calls a \"meandering journey\" in order to see the country of the Northern Territory and meet their extended family; one place that they stopped for sometime was Horseshoe Bend Station where she compared their journey to that of Carl Strehlow as told by the book Journey to Horseshoe Bend (1978).\nAh Chee's father began taking on work at cattle stations along their journey, including Tempe Downs Station, where he dug wells and built cattle yards and the family spent many years living out in the open and sleeping under the stars. During World War II Ah Chee and her family lived in Alice Springs, where they camped with their camels just south of Heavitree Gap. Ah Chee spent some of her time in Alice Springs staying with her Aunty Maude in town and attending Hartley Street School but this was short-lived as she missed her family too much and did not like staying away from them.\nIn 1945 Ah Chee was sent by her father to the Colebrook Home, near Quorn in South Australia. She attended school alongside her cousin Lowitja O'Donoghue who was a good friend to her; Ah Chee remembers her being a good friend, very kind and that she was always encouraging Ah Chee to do additional studies and her homework; acting like a tutor to her.\nAh Chee left school in 1949, at the age of 16, and began working as a domestic hand at Maryvale Station (where her father was already employed) for a short time before starting work for Charles Duguid and his family in Adelaide primarily as domestic help with some secretarial assistance also provided. She remembers him very positively and believed him to be a hard-working fighter for Aboriginal people; she said:\n\nWe used to have a good yarn together. I used to call him Tjilpi - old man. I'd ask him sometimes, 'Tjilpi!' 'Yes?' 'Why haven't you being knighted? Why aren't you Sir Charles Duguid?' 'How can I Myra?' he'd reply, and go on to say, 'I am always fighting the government!'When she had days off she would meet up with other girls from the Colebrook Home and was in contact with many family and friends while in Adelaide. It was here that she met with Fred Ah Chee who she would later marry. Fred, who was originally also from Oodnadatta, was a friend of her brothers who was studying at the School of Mines as well as working as an electrician, he was boarding with her Aunt Undelya (Minnie) Apma. The pair married on 13 February 1954 from the Duguid's home and it was covered in The Australian Women's Weekly; Lowitja O'Donoghue was one of her bridesmaids. Afterwards they made their first home in the Adelaide Hills and Fred continued work as an electrician and spent periods of time (several months in total) working at the Maralinga nuclear tests.\nIn October 1958 Ah Chee and her husband moved to Alice Springs, alongside their one-year-old son Paul Ah Chee (later part of the Amunda band), where Fred began working at the Power House and, by the end of his career, was the chief there. In Alice Springs Ah Chee began working as a gallery attended at the Centre for Aboriginal Artists and Craftsmen and, from the early 1980s, began working as a teacher demonstrator and interpreter/translator at the Institute for Aboriginal Development. Here she worked alongside Cliff Goddard on the Yankunytjatjara sections of the  Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara to English Dictionary (1987). She also worked at the Alice Springs Hospital and Central Australian Aboriginal Congress as a liaison officer/interpreter.\nAh Chee largely retired after Fred's death of reported heart failure in 1987 and she suspects that exposure to radiation at Maralinga contributed to his early death. In her retirement she committed much more time to her art and most of her works where acrylic on canvas.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nAh Chee, Kanakiya Myra (2021).

        "content": "Cara Shillingford became Cara Shillingford Marsh is a Dominican lawyer. She has won several cases that called the government of Dominica to account. In April 2024 she had the laws against same gender sex overturned.\n\n\n== Life ==\nShillingford was brought up in Dominica. She was the daughter of Sylvia Vidal and Hillary Shillingford who live in Salisbury. Her father is one of the most successful farmers in Dominica. She attended the University of the West Indies where she graduated with a First Class Honours Degree in law and she was accepted to the Bar in Dominica in October 2013.\nIn 2014 she was one of the lawyers involved in a case where it was alleged that all the fifteen politicians of the Dominica Labour Party who were elected in the elections that year were involved in treating before the election.\nIn 2018 she went to court to challenge the use of the Riot Act against over 50 citizens. She operarated her own chambers in Dominica employing other lawyers.\nIn 2020 she was a founding member of the Committee of Concerned Lawyers (CCL) which was a group of lawyers who believed that political interference had undermined the country's government. Statutory boards and other institutions are failing to act and they are made of people who routinely follow the government's line. The CCL said that they had no common political or religious loyalties but they did have sixteen goals and one of these was to create respect and primacy for the law. The CCL announced that they intended to improve education in legal matters so that the public were aware of their rights.\nAt the beginning of 2024 she again made the news as she again took on Anthony Astaphan who was the government's lawyer. The government had sacked their employees who had refused to take the COVID-19 vaccine. Shillingford argued that this was unconstitutional and she persuaded the courts to support her.\nShillingford spoke up for electoral reform that could see politicians elected by the Dominican diaspora. In April 2024, Shillingford persuaded the High Court of Justice to overturn the ban on same-sex activity because it violated the constitutional rights of LGBT individuals.\n\n\n== Private life ==\nShe is married to fellow lawyer Wayne Benjamin Marsh.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Tel Qana (Arabic: Tell el-Mukhmar, Hebrew: תל קנה) is an archaeological site and historical mound situated in the Yarkon river basin, near the confluence of Wadi Qana and the Yarqon. It is situated 3 km east of Ramat Ha-Sharon, 5 km south of Ra'anana, and 4.5 km northwest of Tel Afeq. The mound spans an area of 25 dunams and rises to a height of around 12 meters its the surrounding, and includes finds from the Early, Middle, and Late Bronze Ages, Iron Age I–II, and the Persian, Roman, and Byzantine periods.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe Crusader name of the site was Filie de Comar. The site is mentioned in a boundary description in Hasseki Sultan imaret's endowment deed, dated to 1552. The name is listed as Tall bin muḫmārrecte /Tall il-muḫmār/ “the mound of Mukhmar.” Muḫmār might be an ancient Canaanite/Biblical Hebrew survival of mkmr “snare”.\nThe modern Hebrew name of the site derives from Wadi Qana, near-which it stands.\n\n\n== Main finds ==\nA sizable Late Bronze Age II cist burial that is distinctive in its size, plastering, and east–west orientation is the main find at Tell Qana. A young adult's was found buried in the grave with funerary goods made of metal and ceramic. The ceramic vessels, which belong to the latter part of the Late Bronze Age II, are made locally. The distinctive elements of the cemetery, such as the excellent lime plaster, hint at the potential social standing of the deceased and imply influences from other civilizations, including Egyptian. But nothing related to Egypt turned up in this burial.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Our Kakaʻako is a residential and commercial project in the Kakaʻako neighborhood of Honolulu, Hawaiʻi led by Kamehameha Schools, Stanford Carr, Kobayashi Group, and Castle & Cooke Homes Hawaiʻi Inc. The $60 million project aims to improve Hawaiʻi's urban-island lifestyle by adding 183 homes to the Kakaʻako area, with 88 rental units to be developed by Kamehameha Schools. Castle & Cooke will develop the remaining 95 units for buyers. The project also plans to redevelop existing properties in Kakaʻako for residential and commercial space, as well as integrate mid-block pedestrian crosswalks, networked walking paths, complete streetscapes, and green spaces, along with retail spaces. Our Kakaʻako is estimated to take 15–20 years to complete.\nIn accordance to Kamehameha Schools' sustainability efforts, Our Kakaʻako plans to reuse existing warehouses and other structures to \"preserve the feel\" of Kakaʻako. \n\n\n== SALT at Our Kakaʻako ==\n\n\"SALT\" is one of the new developments of Kamehameha Schools' master plan, designed for locals and visitors to enjoy a cosmopolitan environment accompanied with green and open-air spaces. Covering an area of 76,000 square feet, it currently serves as a marketplace housing a variety of retailers and restaurants.\nThe development of SALT aims to cater to a larger and \"more creative\" demographic in the Kakaʻako area. Its name references the historical pa‘akai (salt) ponds which historically existed in the low-lying wetlands of the area.\n\n\n== Six Eighty ==\nTo continue their preservation efforts, Kamehameha Schools hired contractors to redevelop a previous office building and create \"Six Eighty,\" an apartment structure named after its address at 680 Ala Moana Boulevard. Six Eighty is the first installment of Kamehameha Schools' nine-block master plan for Kakaʻako. It is an affordable housing complex that offers both studio and one-bedroom loft-style apartments. Each apartment comes with a 12-foot ceiling, half and full-size kitchens, a full-size bathroom, and compact lighting. Kamehameha Schools created Six Eighty to be a modern and contemporary rental complex consisting of 54 units reserved for median-income renters. The complex is home to small retail shops and eateries and an open-air venue on the roof.\n\n\n== Dwellings ==\nA number of condominiums have been developed as part of the project. The first development, \"The Collection\", is an ultra-luxury development with 397 units and 14 townhomes, constructed in 2016 by Stanford Carr. This was followed by the redevelopment of \"Keauhou Place and Keauhou Lane\" in 2017, two locations comprising a mixed-use condo of 423 units and a low-rise mixed-use complex of 209 units. This development is adjacent a future Skyline rail station.\nA public housing rental development consisting of 456 units, known as \"The Flats at Pu‘unui\", opened in 2023.\n\n\n=== Future plans ===\n\"Kaliʻu\" will be the next redevelopment project in Our Kakaʻako, with ProsPac selected as the developer. The 400-foot structure will comprise 330 market-priced homes and 42,000 square feet of commercial space that will expand the neighborhood retail, grocery, and dining options in Our Kaka‘ako. Kaliʻu, meaning well-seasoned in Hawaiian, embodies concepts of resource stewardship and sustainability and honors the region's famous salt-bed lands in old Hawaiʻi.\n\"Ālia\" will be a luxury mixed-use condo development next to Ward Village's Launiu and will consist of 477 units, at least 40 of which will be affordable.\nKahuina will be an affordable mixed-use condo development in Our Kaka'ako. This development will have 60% affordable and workforce housing; as well as affordable retail space.\n\n\n== Future Skyline station ==\n\nOur Kaka'ako will be served by Kaʻākaukukui station, the planned terminus of the Skyline light metro rail system, as of 2024. It will be located next to the Keauhou Place condominium.\n\n\n== References ==",

During the votes for the third constitution of Côte d'Ivoire, she declared herself in favor of the \"No\" vote. In an interview with the Ivorian daily newspaper, she protested in these terms: \"we say no, to the fraud.\" In January 2022, her daughter, serving as a diplomat at the Ivorian embassy in Switzerland, died following a malaise.\n\n\n== Presidential Candidacy ==\nOn May 12, 2014, Henriette Lagou announced her candidacy for the 2015 presidential election.\nOn August 10, 2015, she became the fourth candidate to officially submit her application.\nOn September 9, 2015, her candidacy was validated by the Constitutional Council.\nShe ultimately received 27,759 votes, or 0.89% of the votes cast.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Rocky Marciano and Archie Moore fought for the world heavyweight boxing title on September 21, 1955. The fight pitted Marciano, the undefeated heavyweight champion against Moore, the light-heavyweight champion. Marciano knocked Moore out in the ninth round, winning his 49th and final fight before retiring.\n\n\n== Background ==\nBoth men had won their respective championship titles in 1952. While Marciano defended his title, Moore climbed through the heavyweight ranks, defeating several top contenders (most notable was two victories over top contender Niño Valdés), and by 1955 was ranked #1 heavyweight contender, ultimately leading to him receiving a title shot later that year. The fight would be Marciano's sixth title defense.\nThe fight was one of the most anticipated sports events of the year, featuring two popular champions both with a large number of knockouts. Moore in particular created a lot of publicity by confidently claiming that he would be the first man to defeat Marciano. Although Moore was seven years older than Marciano, he was far more experienced, and after having studied film of Marciano's fights, believed he had crafted a successful plan to defeat him.\nThe fight was held at Yankee Stadium in New York. It was originally scheduled for September 20, but it was postponed by one day due to Hurricane Ione.\n\n\n== Fight ==\nInstead of a short slugfest, the fight was a very tactical match, with both men attempting to impose their respective styles upon the other. Marciano spent much of the fight on the offensive, trying to break through Moore's defense, while Moore cleverly boxed and moved. Moore began the fight well, using his jab and combinations at range, along with his defense to keep to ever approaching champion off balance, and did well in the fierce exchanges at close range. In the second round, Moore threw a counter right hand that dropped the champion. Marciano took a four count, but soon recovered.\nAs the fight progressed, Marciano's constant pressure began to wear Moore down, and found himself increasingly being cornered and forced to take punishment. In round six, Marciano dropped Moore twice, first with a right hook towards the beginning, and a second time after taking  a barrage of punches at the end of the round. Moore survived the seventh round without being knocked down, but was knocked down a third time at the end of the eighth but was saved by the bell, though the end was near. The ninth round Marciano backed Moore up against the ropes, and after landing two consecutive left hooks to the head, dropped Moore for a fourth time and this time did not beat the referee's count.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe fight was Marciano's 49th and final professional boxing match, and he announced his retirement six months later in 1956. That year, following his retirement, Moore remained the top heavyweight contender, and following a brief tournament, ultimately fought Floyd Patterson for the vacant heavyweight title in November. Moore was defeated and never fought for the heavyweight title again, but retained his light-heavyweight title into the 1960s.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"Follow Me (Zoey 101)\" is an unreleased song that served as the theme song for Zoey 101. With Jamie Lynn Spears on vocals, she and her older sister Britney Spears wrote and recorded the song in 2004. Spears and American DJ Chantel Jeffries re-recorded and remixed the theme song, releasing it on October 22, 2020. A Gigi Gorgeous-directed music video for the re-recorded theme song was released a few days later on October 27, 2020, and featured JoJo Siwa, Dixie D'Amelio Noah Beck, and Sofia Reyes.\n\n\n== Background and release ==\n\"Follow Me (Zoey 101)\" was first written and recorded in 2004 by Jamie Lynn Spears and her older sister Britney Spears. Spears was originally too nervous to record the song, but after encouragement from her older sister, she felt comfortable singing. It served as the theme song to Zoey 101, with Spears then playing the lead character from 2005 to 2008. Despite the song being very popular among fans, it was never commercially released. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, people had started re-watching their childhood shows, inspiring Spears to re-record the song as fans waited for the reboot of the show she had begun working on.\nSpears had wanted to rewrite the lyrics of \"Follow Me (Zoey 101)\" due to writing the original as a young child. Spears recorded a new version of \"Follow Me (Zoey 101)\" with American DJ Chantel Jeffries over Zoom during the Spring of 2020. They finished remixing the song in a recording studio in Louisiana. The song was later released on October 22, 2020, by Republic Records, and credits Spears and Jeffries as the artists. The song was produced by Jeffries along with American musician Josh Cumbee.\n\n\n== Music and promotion ==\nThe re-recording of \"Follow Me (Zoey 101)\" is an electropop and pop song. According to Heran Mamo of Billboard, the re-recorded \"Follow Me (Zoey 101)\" had the original theme songs \"nostalgic piano keys\" and stated it \"reassures Spears will always be our girl.\" The original theme song featured the lyrics, \"I'm just another kinda girl/And you wanna see my world/So come and run away\", while the re-recorded version had, \"You know I'll always be your girl/ Together we can see the world/ Come on let's run away\".\nA music video for the re-recorded version of \"Follow Me (Zoey 101)\", which was directed by Gigi Gorgeous, was released on October 27, 2020. The video was filmed on September 29, 2020, and features parts of the original show with new footage featuring Spears, her daughter, and the original Zoey 101 cast consisting of Erin Sanders, Christopher Massey, Matthew Underwood, and Sean Flynn. The video also features JoJo Siwa, Dixie D'Amelio, Noah Beck, and Sofia Reyes auditioning to be characters in the reboot of Zoey 101. It ends with them dancing at a party with confetti falling while D'Amelio and Beck kiss.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nDylan Kickham for Elite Daily wrote that the original theme song was an \"iconic tune\" that \"holds a special place in the hearts of millennials\". MTV News editor Crystal Bell ranked the original theme song at number three on her The 17 Best Nickelodeon Theme Songs, Ranked list, mentioning that having Britney Spears as a co-writer in the song \"automatically put \"Follow Me\" in the top three\". Carolyn Twersky, writing for Seventeen magazine, called the re-recorded version of \"Follow Me (Zoey 101)\" a \"low key bop\" and opined it was an \"iconic new theme song\".\n\n\n== Credits and personnel ==\nOctober 2020 remix credits adapted from Tidal.\n\nJamie Lynn Spears –  vocals, songwriter\nChantel Jeffries vocals, songwriter, producer\nJosh Cumbee  –  songwriter, producer, piano, programming\nBritney Spears –  songwriter\nChristian Karlsson  –  songwriter\nHenrik Jonback  –  songwriter\nPontus Winnberg –  songwriter\nShari Short –  backing vocals, songwriter, vocal producer\nTony Maserati –  mixer\nDale Becker –  mastering engineer\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Cultural Centre of the National School of Fine Arts' (Spanish: Centro Cultural de la Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes), also known as the Old Deposit and Consignment Fund (Spanish: Antigua Caja de Depósitos y Consignaciones), is a building located in the historic centre of Lima, Peru. It was designed by Ricardo de Jaxa Malachowski in the Beaux-Arts style and built in 1917. The property has had various uses and is currently used as an exhibition centre and as teaching classrooms. It is located on the corner of Huallaga and Azángaro streets.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1905 the Deposit and Consignment Fund was created. Its financial nature was reflected in its headquarters, which, like a bank, has a first floor with easy access from the street dedicated to serving the public, and offices on the upper floors. The building replaced a viceregal house where a pastry shop once owned by Andrés Diez de Abreu was located.\nThe building was designed by the Polish-born architect Ricardo de Jaxa Malachowski according to the postulates of the late Beaux-Arts style. The first floor serves as a basement, with horizontal striped padding, and a series of openings crowned by semicircular arches . On the second and third floors, two Doric colonnades stand out, separated from the façade, with pediments and cornices with strongly molded modillions.\nThe interior is organized around three exhibition rooms made up of three peristyles joined and covered by stained glass windows made in Bordeaux. The offices and meeting rooms of the managers were around that space, under which the vaults are located.\nIt was declared part of the Cultural heritage of Peru through Supreme Resolution N° 2900–72-ED, and donated by the government to the National Superior Autonomous School of Fine Arts on September 27, 1996.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNational Superior Autonomous School of Fine Arts, Lima\n\n\n== References ==",

I think it's kind of all been leading up to this, and I haven't had a release in the summer in a while. So I'm really excited to be rolling it out in this way”.\n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe accompanying music video was released the same day as the single, on April 12, 2024.

        "content": "Druggans Dam, for some time known as Toi Toi Flat Dam, is a reservoir in the Tasman District of the South Island of New Zealand. It was built to get water for gold-mining purposes.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nDruggans Dam is located approximately 1.45 kilometres (0.90 mi) east of the Slate River, approximately 1.8 kilometres (1.1 mi) southeast of the Aorere River, and approximately 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) south-southwest of Collingwood, which lies at the mouth of the Aorere River that flows into Golden Bay / Mohua. The lake covers an area of 20 hectares (49 acres) and has a shore length of around 2.46 kilometres (1.53 mi). The lake extends over a length of around 595 metres (1,952 ft) in an east–west direction and measures around 490 metres (1,610 ft) at its widest point in a north–south direction.\nThe reservoir is fed by several creeks that run from the south to the southeast. Drainage occurs via the barrier structure on the northwest side of the lake into Stanton Creek. Before the dam was built, the area was known as Toi Toi Flat. The original dam and lake was named after the miner who built the original dam, George Druggan. When the Slate River Sluicing Company took over and greatly increased the dam, they called it the Toi Toi Flat Dam.\n\n\n== Dam structure ==\nThe dam structure, which is now overgrown with trees and plants, has a crown length of around 91 metres (299 ft) and a width at the base of 61 metres (200 ft). The dam, for which a volume of 23,000 cubic metres (810,000 cu ft) of earth was used, is around 18 metres (59 ft) high.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe reservoir, which is a relic of the gold rush era, was used to store water for hydraulic mining. The water jets would blast open the slopes in the mining areas downstream to get the coveted precious metal. The original dam was built in c. 1873. The miner George Druggan bought the dam in 1876. Druggan gave up gold mining when he received an inheritance of £30,000 and went back to England. Druggan's claim was taken over by Joseph Benson and his wife Agnes in the early 1890s. After Benson came the Slate River Sluicing Company, registered in 1900, which promoted gold mining between the Slate River and Doctor's Creek and enlarged the lake's dam. However, the construction work did not pay off for the company, as the 1,152 ounces (32.7 kg) of gold recovered by 1905 did not offset the investment of £13,785. When the company was dissolved in 1909, all assets went to the Aorere Hydraulic Sluicing Company for £250, which continued to use the reservoir into the 1930s.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Battle of Sharafdin (or Sherfedîn ) was a 5-month-long battle from August, 2014 between the terrorist organization Islamic State (IS) and Kurdish Peshmerga vigilantes with local Yazidis. The site of the battle is the pilgrimage site of Sharfadin, located on the Jabal Shingal mountain range in Ninewa Governorate in northwestern Iraq.\n\n\n== Battle ==\nIn August 2014, the temple was the site of a battle where 18 lightly armed Yazidi Peshmerga fighters under the command of Qasim Shesho successfully held off a larger and better equipped ISIL force with armored vehicles, mortars, and rockets that had attacked the shrine as part of the genocide of Yazidis by ISIL.\nOn October 20, 2014, at three o'clock, the IS militias advanced on several locations around Jabal Shingal. Eyewitnesses report that 40 Humvees were used during the advance. The IS militias were able to advance quickly and encircle the defenders in the pilgrimage site of Sharfadin. For the Yazidi religious minority, Sharfadin is the second most important pilgrimage site. According to Yazidi statements, one hundred Yazidi fighters died as part of the major offensive on October 20 alone. The Yazidi vigilantes had been waiting for days for a promised relief attack from the Peshmerga. Both the escape and possible air support from the anti-IS alliance were hampered by days of rain. On October 22, the Yazidi defenders released a video showing the German-speaking fighter Yassir Qasim Khelef. The video is an appeal to the world for help and reports that the Yazidi vigilante group is only holding the position in the mountains and in the pilgrimage site, and that the IS militias are only 3 km away from the pilgrimage site.\nOn the morning of October 25, Kurdish forces again managed to capture the town of Zummar, about 50 km northeast of the Shingal Mountains.[1]  The defenders were able to keep the front line stable until the end of October, with support from the Peshmerga. On November 1, it was announced that the Peshmerga had launched an offensive to liberate the city of Shingal. The capital of the district is located about 10 km southwest of the pilgrimage site, on the opposite side of the Shingal Mountains.\nIn December 2014, the Peshmerga launched a major attack against IS in the region and were able to liberate most of the region within a few days.\n\n\n== Reference list ==",

        "content": "In April 2024, mass graves were discovered in the Gaza Strip during the Israel–Hamas war. Such graves were found in two large hospitals, Nasser Hospital and Al-Shifa Hospital, both of which were raided by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). Graves were also found in Beit Lahia and Deir al-Balah. More than 300 bodies have been found as of 24 April 2024.\nThe discovery has caused international concern over potential war crimes and calls for an investigation, including by the United Nations (UN). Several officials at the UN have cited reports that an unspecified amount of the bodies found had their hands tied.\n\n\n== Background ==\nSince the start of the Israel–Hamas war, Israel has attacked, damaged or destroyed nearly every hospital in the Gaza Strip. In January 2024, the Gazan health ministry said that 40 bodies were buried inside the hospital due to \"the siege on the neighbourhoods close to Nasser Hospital\". A Nasser hospital official had told journalists in January that hospital staff had buried around 150 bodies in the hospital's yard.\nThe hospital was shelled multiple times throughout the war and received significant international media coverage after the death of a 13-year-old amputee, Donia Abu Mohsen, who had survived a previous Israeli airstrike that had killed her entire family. Nasser Hospital was reported to be non-functional after a February Israeli raid.\nIsraeli soldiers entered the hospital on 15 February 2024 from the south, destroying tents and bulldozing a mass grave. Israel stated it exhumed and examined some 400 corpses looking for Israeli hostages.\nDue to power outages during the entry of Israeli soldiers into the hospital, five patients in the hospital died. On 18 February, the World Health Organization said the hospital could no longer serve its patients, and that the hospital was no longer functional. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus attributed the hospital's inability to continue operating to the Israeli siege and raid.\nMass graves had previously been discovered at Al-Shifa Hospital after the siege there earlier in 2024.\n\n\n== Allegations of desecration ==\nPalestine Health Ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qadra claimed that dozens of bodies exhumed from mass graves had been beheaded and their organs and skins removed from mass graves at Nasser Hospital.\nAccording to paramedics and rescue teams involved in the recovery of the bodies, some bodies were found with hands tied, indicating possible execution. Other victims were found with bullet marks on their heads, raising suspicions of summary executions. There are also reports of torture marks on the bodies.\nSome bodies were found suspicious of organ theft with their stomachs open and stitched up, contrary to the usual wound closure techniques in the Gaza Strip. The mutilated body of a little girl wearing a surgical gown was also found, prompting suspicions that she had been buried alive.\n\n\n== List of discovered graves ==\n\n\n=== Nasser Medical Complex ===\n\nIn April 2024, following the withdrawal of Israeli forces, over 300 bodies of young men, women, and children were unearthed at the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis, Gaza, after Israeli military withdrawal. The bodies exhibited signs of having been bound and potentially executed in the field. Reports indicate that two other mass graves have been identified, but have yet to be excavated.\n\n\n=== Al-Shifa Hospital ===\nIn April 2024, health workers in Gaza exhumed the first bodies from mass graves at Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, where at least 381 bodies were found after the withdrawal of Israeli forces, following their two-week siege. Many bodies showed signs of severe trauma, including being crushed or disfigured, partially as a result of being run over by Israeli tanks. The graves included both buried and above-ground remains, some under dirt or plastic sheeting.\n\n\n=== Beit Lahiya ===\nA mass grave has been discovered on the grounds of a school in Beit Lahiya, in the northern Gaza Strip. The bodies of 30 Palestinians were reportedly found in body bags, blindfolded and their hands tied behind their backs. The Palestinian Prisoners' Club has confirmed the discovery and indicated that the victims were under detention, suggesting they were executed in the field. The victims' identities, circumstances and dates of death are unknown.\n\n\n=== Deir al Balah ===\nA mass grave was also discovered in Deir al-Balah. At least 50 people have been buried in a mass grave due to the large number of casualties, said the city's mayor, Diab Al-Jaro.\n\n\n== Investigation ==\nThe United Nations called for \"clear, transparent and credible investigations\" into the mass graves. Volker Turk emphasized that hospitals are entitled to very special protection under international humanitarian law. He also stated that the deliberate killing of civilians, prisoners, and others who are hors de combat (unable to participate in combat) is a war crime. The United Nations has also called for the preservation of forensic evidence of Gaza's mass graves. The European Union also called for an independent investigation, stating, \"This is something that forces us to call for an independent investigation... because indeed it creates the impression that there might have been violations of international human rights committed\".\n\n\n== Reactions ==\nThe Israeli Defence Forces said the accusations of them causing the killings were \"baseless and unfounded.\" The IDF said that during its operation \"in the area of Nasser Hospital, in accordance to the effort to locate hostages and missing persons, corpses buried by Palestinians in the area of Nasser Hospital were examined.\" They further stated that \"Bodies examined, which did not belong to Israeli hostages, were returned to their place.\" Sky News published an analysis of satellite imagery and social media footage of mass graves dug by Palestinians during Israel's siege, which were later bulldozed by the IDF.\nHamas has criticized the international community for its silence after the discovery of mass graves in Gaza. They called the findings evidence of \"Zionist fascism\" and war crimes. Hamas demanded that international institutions hold Israel accountable.\n\n\n=== Countries ===\n Egypt: The Egyptian Foreign Ministry said that \"it is sad and shameful that violations of international law and human values continue in this way in the 21st century, in full view and hearing of all countries, international organizations and the Security Council.\" Egypt also said it condemned violations of international law, including the targeting of civilians, displaced persons and medical teams by Israeli forces.\n France: France has called for an independent investigation into mass graves discovered in Gaza. \"Given the total humanitarian emergency in Gaza, where the civilian situation has long been unacceptable, France calls for an immediate and lasting ceasefire, the only thing that will protect the civilian population,\" the French foreign ministry said. and the massive influx of humanitarian aid through all access points to the Gaza Strip.\"\n Germany: Germany has called for an investigation into media reports on the discovery of mass graves.\n Iran: The spokesman of the Iranian Foreign Ministry, Nasser Kanani, has described this massacre as horrific and heartbreaking. Emphasizing that international humanitarian law, particularly the 1949 Geneva Conventions, supports medical centers and hospitals, he said, adding that damning evidence shows that the Israeli government and Zionists are responsible for the atrocities committed in this crime. Iran's ambassador to Geneva and permanent representative to international organizations, Ali Bahrain, has also called for an immediate end to crimes in the Gaza enclave in response to the discovery of mass graves.\n Jordan: Jordanian Foreign Ministry spokesman Sufyan Qadah reiterated the kingdom's condemnation of Israeli actions and crimes, adding that these actions are not only a violation of international law and humanitarian law, but also war crimes.\n Pakistan: Pakistan has joined the United Nations in demanding a \"transparent and credible\" investigation into the discovery of mass graves at two major Gaza hospitals. A Foreign Office spokesman said, \"There must be an independent and impartial investigation to establish the facts, determine responsibility and punish those responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza. We call on the international community, particularly calls on Israel's supporters to take immediate action to end the war on the people of Gaza, to protect civilians and to hold the perpetrators of the Gaza genocide accountable.\"\n Palestine: Palestinian officials have called for an international investigation after a mass grave of people who were blindfolded and handcuffed was found in Gaza. The Palestinian Foreign Ministry called for an international investigation into what it described as an Israeli massacre, and demanded that a team visit Gaza to find out \"the reality and extent of this genocide to which our people are being exposed\".\n Saudi Arabia: Saudi Arabia has condemned Israeli war crimes in the Gaza Strip. The kingdom's foreign ministry emphasized that the international community's failure to hold Israel accountable for its violations of international law will only lead to more violations and an increase in humanitarian tragedies and destruction.\n South Africa: South Africa's Department of International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO) has expressed its deep concern and shock at the discovery of the mass grave, describing the discovery as appalling.\n United States: The US State Department has expressed concern over mass graves. Spokesman Matthew Miller said the US was inquiring with Israel about the reports. The US has asked Israel about reports of mass graves. The White House has also described reports of mass graves in Gaza as 'deeply troubling'. US officials have spoken to their Israeli counterparts to learn more about the reports.\n Houthis: Following the discovery of the mass graves, Yemen's Houthi group urged its forces to step up its operations against Israeli-linked vessels in the Red Sea, Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean. The Houthi group emphasized the continuous stand of the Yemeni people in support of the Palestinian people and their heroic resistance in Gaza.\nThe Scottish National Party's deputy Westminster leader, Mhairi Black, has urged the UK government to condemn reports of mass graves in Gaza hospitals as war crimes. She reiterated her party's call for an end to arms sales to Israel during Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday. Black likens the condemnation of mass graves in Ukraine as war crimes to the failure to do so so far in this case. She told the Commons: \"When mass graves were discovered in Ukraine two years ago, this House was united in condemnation and considered the graves to be evidence of war crimes, for which Russia must respond. Yesterday, Palestinian authorities in Gaza Covering up mass graves outside bombed hospitals is also considered a war crime, isn't it?\" In response to Black, Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden said Israel was expected to investigate any allegations of misconduct. Dowden continued to urge the Israeli government to investigate any allegations of misconduct.\n\n\n=== International organizations ===\n United Nations rights chief Volker Türk said that he was \"horrified\" by the site and called for an international investigation. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said the attack indicated \"serious violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law.\" The United Nations has also called for the preservation of forensic evidence of Gaza's mass graves. The UN human rights chief while expressing his horror at the destruction of Nasir and al-Shifa hospitals and reports of mass graves also demanded an independent investigation into the killings.\n The European Union (EU) has backed a UN call for an independent investigation into the alleged discovery of mass graves. European Union spokesman Peter Stano said the situation \"forces us to call for an independent investigation of all suspicions and all circumstances, because it gives the impression that international human rights may have been violated\".\n The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) has condemned Israel's \"continuous and tragic massacre\" of Palestinians following the discovery of mass graves. The OIC said it called the discovery of the mass grave \"a war crime, a crime against humanity, and organized state terrorism that requires investigation, accountability and sanction under international criminal law\".\n The Arab League will hold an emergency meeting to discuss Israel's deadly attack on the Gaza Strip. The meeting will discuss Israel's ongoing genocidal war, the discovery of mass graves in Gaza and the US veto against the Palestinian bid for full UN membership.\nAmnesty International has called for immediate access to the Gaza Strip for human rights investigators following the discovery of mass graves. Erika Guevara Rosas, Amnesty International's senior director, stressed the need to preserve these sites for forensic evidence and identification of remains. He highlighted ICJ orders for Israel to preserve evidence to prevent genocide and urged third states to pressure Israel to allow independent investigators and forensic experts into Gaza.\nThe International Rescue Committee (IRC) has called for an immediate international and independent investigation into the reports of mass graves. Bob Kitchen, Vice President of Emergencies at the IRC, expressed deep concern at the reports and said, \"We are horrified by the news of hundreds of bodies being buried in mass graves in health facilities in Gaza. Some of the dead are alleged to have died. There were elderly, women, and injured persons - some of whom were handcuffed and stripped - we echo the call of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights for an immediate and fully independent investigation into these incidents. do.\"\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Copper Mountain is a roughly 8,317 foot mountain in the Bridger Mountains, a small range that straddles the Fremont and Hot Springs County line.\nThe range rises north of Shoshoni, and is split by Wind River Canyon. The Owl Creek Mountains are west of Wind River Canyon. Copper Mountain is also sometimes known as Bridger's Mountain. Copper Mountain is part of a larger BLM owned parcel known as The Copper Mountain Wildlife Study area which encompasses 6,858 acres. Most of the mountain is scattered limber pine and juniper with rocky slopes. \nNearby Boysen Reservoir is visible from Copper Mountain. The area is popular for hikers, hunters, and rock climbers, which has caused conflicts with local ranchers.\n\n\n== Geology ==\nCopper Mountain is features Archean rocks of the Wyoming Craton and is overlain in the southern part by Cenozoic sedimentary rocks.\nLithium-bearing pegmatite (otherwise known as igneous rock containing crystals) has been found on Copper Mountain, including amblygonite, lepidolite, iron-manganese phosphates, columbite, tapiolite and beryl.\n\n\n== Mining ==\nCopper Mountain is home to several mines, including those for uranium.\nThree of the four uranium mines in Wyoming are still producing. The Arrowhead Mine on Copper Mountain produced around 500,000 pounds of Uranium in the 1960s and 70s.\nCopper Mountain was also mined for iron, some of which was discovered in the 1950s.\n\n\n== Radio/Television uses ==\nEdwards Communications, based in nearby Riverton, Wyoming, operates two radio stations from a tower on Copper Mountain. KDNO 101.7 FM is licensed to Thermopolis, while KWYW 99.1 FM is licensed to Lost Cabin. When the stations moved their studio location to Main Street in Riverton, both KWYW and KDNO also received upgrades at the time.\nWyoming Public Radio's KUWT 91.3 FM, licensed to Thermopolis, also broadcasts from the mountain.\nWyoming Public Radio also has two other stations on Copper Mountain, KTWY 97.1 FM, carrying an adult alternative format known as \"Wyoming Sounds\", and KWWY 106.5 FM, carrying a classical format.\nThe last station that shares a tower on Copper Mountain is known as KUDA (FM), on 89.9 FM, licensed to Bonneville, Wyoming. That station is known as \"Wyoming's Hot Spot\" in reference to the nearby hot springs in Thermopolis.\nIn addition to radio stations, Copper Mountain provides a large coverage area for television stations in central Wyoming. KFNE Riverton, channel 10, broadcasts from the mountain. Casper television stations KTWO-TV and KGWC have translators on the mountain, as does Wyoming Public Television, based out of Lander.\nAmateur radio users have repeaters on the mountain, two with the call sign W7BEQ. One repeater receives on 146.805 MHz and transmits on 146.205 MHz. The other repeater receives at 446.825 MHz, and transmits at 441.825 MHz. A third repeater with the call sign W0KGB receives on 444.375 MHz and transmits on 449.375 MHz\nThere is also a repeater on Copper Mountain used for Automatic Packet Reporting System, or APRS, known as W7BEQ. It uses 144.390 MHz.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of mountain ranges in Wyoming",

It is an erect shrub with broadly egg-shaped to lance-shaped leaves and whitish-cream, tube-shaped flowers with hairy lobes.\n\n\n== Description ==\nStyphelia tenuiflora is an erect, bushy, rigid, glabrous shrub that typically grows up to 0.2–1 m (7.9 in – 3 ft 3.4 in) high. The leaves are egg-shaped to broadly lance-shaped, about 12 mm (0.47 in) long with a short, almost sessile with a sharply pointed tip. The flowers are arranged in leaf axils, with bracteoles up to 2 mm (0.079 in) long at the base. The sepals are about 5 mm (0.20 in) long, and the petals are creamy white and joined at the base forming a narrow tube 12 mm (0.47 in) long with hairy lobes.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nStyphelia tenuiflora was first formally described in 1839 by John Lindley in his A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony. The specific epithet (tenuiflora) means \"thin-flowered\".\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nCommon pinheath grows on gravelly lateritic soil in the Avon Wheatbelt, Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest, Mallee and Swan Coastal Plain bioregions of south-western Western Australia.\n\n\n== Conservation status ==\nStyphelia tenuiflora is listed as \"not threatened\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Zambono di Andrea or d'Andrea (c. 1235 – 1315/1316) was a Paduan notary, poet and historian. He wrote in Latin.\n\n\n== Life ==\nZambono was born in Padua around 1235 to a draper named Andrea. His mother's name is unknown. His family belonged to the urban middle class. That he was a member of the Favafoschi family, as later writers have it, is unlikely. His family was dedicated to the notarial profession. Two of his brothers, Antonio and Bartolomeo, became notaries, as did Bartolomeo's son Andrea. Zambono had five sons. Four (Andrea, Filippo, Virgilio and Polidamo) became notaries, while Corradino became a judge.\nIn 1254, Zambono was a member of the Consiglio Maggiore. By 1258, he was a notary for the city. In 1266, he drew up a pact between Padua and Treviso. Other surviving documents he drew up for the city are from 1264 and 1289. Later, he worked as a notary for the bishop of Padua. With Lovato Lovati, he signed on behalf of Padua a treaty of alliance with Verona against Venice on 18 May 1304. Following the war with Venice, he was part of the commission overseeing the reconstruction of the disputed salt pans.\nLate in life Zambono and three of his sons—Andrea, Filippo and Virgilio—were forced into exile for a crime committed by Virgilio while on military assignment. They may have spent time in Vicenza and Treviso before settling in Venice. When the Emperor Henry VII came to Italy in 1311–1313, Albertino Mussato sought advice on whether to support the emperor through a poem addressed to Zambono, whom he calls \"the one source and mind of the modern age\" (fons et mens una moderni).\nZambono drew up his will in Venice on 15 October 1315. He died there sometime before 7 April 1316.\n\n\n== Works ==\nZambono wrote a short poem on the families of Padua, their castles and coats of arms. It is known today only from quotations in the De generatione aliquorum civium urbis Padue of Giovanni da Nono. He also contributed two poems to a poetic debate between Lovato Lovati and Albertino Mussato over whether it was better to have children or not. After five poems each, Zambono judged the debate in favour of Lovato and childlessness. After Mussato appealed the decision to Benvenuto Campesani, Zambono wrote a poem addressed to Campesani defending his judgement. The collection of twelve poems is often known collectively as De prole. Imitating the troubadours, all three participants took nicknames (senhals). Zambono went by Bos (ox), while Lovato was Lupus (wolf) and Mussato Asellus (ass). In his judgement, Zambono speaks from experience:\n\nFive other poems by Zambono are found in one manuscript containing De prole. In one of these, dated 4 October 1314 and addressed to Mussato, he expresses joy that Padua had reached a peace with Cangrande della Scala and hope that he could soon return to Padua.\nAccording to Bernardino Scardeone, writing in the 15th century, Zambono also wrote a prose work \"on his country from the foundation of the city\" (de patria ab urbe condita). Giovanni Francesco Capodilista, writing in 1434, identifies him as a \"poet and historiographer\" (poeta et ystoriographus), but distinguishes him from the author of the so-called Pseudo-Favafoschi chronicle, with whom, since 1627, he has often been conflated.\nZambono was \"a member of the pre-humanist circle\" in Padua. Like Lovato, he belonged to its first generation. Giuseppe Billanovich alleged that his poetry showed the influence of Horace, Martial, Propertius, Tibullus, Catullus, Ovid's Ibis and Statius' Siluae. The evidence for Zambono's knowledge of Propertius, Tibullus, Ibis or Siluae, however, is weak.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nButrica, James L. (1984).

She founded ONG & ONG, an architecture and urban planning firm, with her husband in 1972.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nLing was born in 1937 in Shanghai, China, the fourth of six children. She was later sent to an orphanage in Shanghai, China after her father and her family were separated during the Japanese occupation of Singapore. In 1948, she returned to Singapore after her father had located them.\nShe studied at Nanyang Girls' High School. She later studied at the University of Adelaide studying architecture, which is where she met her future husband Ong Teng Cheong. After graduating in 1963 with a Bachelor in architecture, she married Ong in the same year.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1972, Ling and Ong founded ONG & ONG, an architecture firm, she was a principal partner.\nIn 1993, she became the 5th Spouse of the President of Singapore after her husband Ong was elected president of Singapore. Despite becoming the Spouse, she continued her job as an architect at ONG & ONG, becoming the first working Spouse.\nIn 1999, Ling designed the new Nanyang Girls' High School campus at Linden Drive. She was also the chairperson of Nanyang Girls' board.\nShe died later that year whilst still serving as Spouse. Ling is the first Spouse to have died during their partner's presidency. Her death is reportedly the reason why Ong did not seek a re-election as he himself was in remission from lymphatic cancer.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nShe and Ong have two sons. In 1993, she stated that her elder son, Ong Tze Guan, was working in Singapore while her younger son, Ong Tze Boon, was doing his masters at Rice University in Houston, Texas.\n\n\n=== Death ===\nLing died on 30 July 1999 after suffering from colon cancer for 2+1⁄2 years at the National University Hospital.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Francis Leo McNamee (February 3, 1892 – November 6, 1974) was an American businessman and government official who was regional director of the War Manpower Commission, president of United Artists and the Philadelphia Eagles, and commissioner of the Philadelphia Fire Department.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMcNamee was born in Butler County, Pennsylvania, on February 3, 1892. He attended public school in Butler, Pennsylvania, and graduated from Washington & Jefferson College in 1915 and the University of Pittsburgh School of Law in 1918. He enlisted in the United States Army in 1918 and was assigned to the officer's training school at Camp Taylor, Louisville.\n\n\n== Early career ==\nIn 1923, McNamee joined RKO Pictures as a branch manager based out of Washington D.C. He then worked as a salesman for Universal Pictures until 1932, when he became manager of RKO's Philadelphia branch, which covered Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. In 1940, he became a partner of theatre manager Jay Emanuel. They owned and operated around 125 theaters and hotels, including the Rajah in Reading, Pennsylvania.\n\n\n== World War II ==\nIn 1943, McNamee was appointed regional director of the War Manpower Commission for Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. In August 1943, McNamee instituted a mandatory 48-hour work week in the Newark, New Jersey, area due to labor shortages. In August 1944, he order a 48-hour work week for the Philadelphia–Camden, New Jersey, area as well.\nDue to the labor shortage in the city, McNamee ordered the Philadelphia Transportation Company to upgrade black employees to operating jobs. This led to a strike by white transit workers. McNamee refused to rescind his order and later issued an order barring any employer from hiring any PTC employee. The PTC was taken over by the United States Army under the authority of the Smith–Connally Act and the strike was resolved after Major General Philip Hayes directed strikers to return to work or lose their military draft deferments.\nIn 1944, McNamee was chosen by WMC chairman Paul V. McNutt to act as the agency's assistant deputy director while Vernon A. McGee was on vacation. From January to September 1945, McNamee was the deputy chairman of the War Manpower Commission.\nIn 1946, McNamee was appointed regional director of the War Assets Administration. He oversaw the sale of surplus military equipment and property in the Philadelphia area, including 125 factories and the Millville Army Air Field.\n\n\n== Philadelphia Eagles ==\nIn 1949, McNamee was part of a syndicate, nicknamed the Happy Hundred, that purchased the Philadelphia Eagles from Alexis \"Lex\" Thompson for $250,000. In 1953, he succeeded majority shareholder James P. Clark as team president. McNamee also served as secretary of Clark's Liberty Bell Park Racetrack until Pennsylvania passed a law prohibiting public officials from operating horse tracks. \nIn 1958, the Eagles moved from Connie Mack Stadium to Franklin Field after McNamee reached a deal with the University of Pennsylvania. The Eagles were allowed to play at the stadium rent free, but made donations toward the maintenance of the field and allowed Penn to keep revenue from parking and concessions. The Eagles played the 1960 NFL Championship Game at Franklin Field and defeated the Green Bay Packers 17–13. In 1960, McNamee was one of four owners who blocked Marshall Leahy's appointment as Commissioner of the National Football League due to his desire to remain in San Francisco and move the league office to the west coast. After an eight-day deadlock, Leahy's supporters finally gave in and Los Angeles Rams general manager Pete Rozelle was elected as a compromise candidate. McNamee disagreed with Rozelle's decision to have the league play its normal schedule of games following the assassination of John F. Kennedy. McNamee refused to attend the game in favor of a memorial service at nearby Independence Hall, stating that \"the game is being played by order of the commissioner\". In December 1963, the \"Happy Hundred\" sold the club to Jerry Wolman for $5,505,000.\n\n\n== United Artists ==\nIn 1950, McNutt led a syndicate that obtained control of United Artists. He reorganized the company with himself as chairman and McNamee as president and treasurer. The pair were unable to turn around the struggling company, which reportedly lost around $25,000 a week under their management. In 1951, management of UA was acquired by Arthur B. Krim and Robert Benjamin.\n\n\n== Philadelphia fire commissioner ==\nIn 1952, mayor Joseph S. Clark Jr. appointed McNamee to the position of fire commissioner, which was created after the PFD became a independent from the department of public safety. Under his leadership, the department underwent a modernization program that saw the closure or replacement of older fire stations, engine and ladder companies move from separate stations into the same building, the construction of a new fire training school, and the replacement of the city's firefighting apparatuses. He retired on April 24, 1964.\n\n\n== Later life and death ==\nMcNamee spent his later years in Lakewood, Ohio. He died on November 6, 1974, at Fairview Park Hospital in Cleveland.\n\n\n== References ==",

Known as the first Directional Temple among the quartet of temples established in the region, it holds a sacred duty of invoking rain and protecting the settlements of Vavuniya from all four cardinal directions. It the largest Hindu temple in Vavuniya. \nInitially overseen by pujaris who conducted rituals without chanting mantras but with offerings, including sacrificial tributes to the revered deity Muthumari Amman, the temple later saw a significant change in its religious practices after 1977, with Brahmins assuming the responsibility of conducting worship ceremonies and offering pujas. It has remained a pilgrimage site of immense importance. \nThe annual festival held in honour of Muththumari Amman is a grand affair, attracting throngs of devotees from across Vavuniya.\n\n\n== Location ==\nPandarikulam Amman Kovil is located 1.3 km (0.81 mi) from the Vavuniya Railway Station and 400 m (1,300 ft) from the B52 road. Its strategic location near these transport arteries facilitates easy access for devotees and visitors alike. Surrounded by verdant fields, the temple serves as a beacon of communal harmony and spiritual devotion for the Vairavarpuliyankulam and Pandarikulam suburbs. Despite the limited public transportation options in the area, its close proximity to these key landmarks ensures a steady flow of pilgrims and tourists, enriching the vibrant fabric of the local community.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Muththumari Amman temple in Vavuniya, alongside the Kandaswamy temple and the Kudiyiruppu Pillaiyar temple, is believed to date back to ancient times. Evidence of its antiquity is apparent in the presence of a statue of Muththumari Amman within the Kandaswamy temple's courtyard and the construction of a dedicated temple for Muththumari Amman at the entrance of the Kudiyiruppu Pillaiyar temple.\nTracing its origins to the 16th century, the Temple of Muththumari Amman began as a modest shrine nestled atop a neem tree. Over time, it flourished into a revered institution, largely due to the unwavering support of the local Pandarams and Wannaans communities. The reign of the esteemed monarch Pandara Vanniyan saw the temple's prominence reach new heights, with the ruler himself renaming the village after his visit to honor the deity. Formerly known as Karunkali Thottam Village, it was rechristened Pandarikulam, honoring Pandara Vanniyan's reverence for the goddess. The temple's historical association with towering ebony trees also led to its erstwhile moniker as the Karunkali Amman Temple in ancient folklore.\nFor more than four centuries, the temple remained relatively modest as newer Hindu temples emerged in Vavuniya. However, significant changes occurred in 1977, with the replacement of Pujaris and animal sacrifices by Agamas and Brahmins. Despite the challenges posed by the Sri Lankan conflict, the temple gradually evolved, culminating in its complete demolition and subsequent reconstruction in 2010, transforming it into the largest Hindu temple in Vavuniya. After twelve years of consecration, a grand re-consecration ceremony took place on March 25, 2024. This event featured the unveiling of a magnificent five-tiered gopuram adorned with intricate designs, alongside an elaborate nine-kundalini grand kumbhabhishekam.\n\n\n== Festivals ==\nThe temple festival kicks off fifteen days prior to the full moon day in the Tamil month of Aadi with the flag hoisting ceremony, initiating a series of celebrations that span the following fortnight. This festival stands as one of the most extended and anticipated events in the city of Vavuniya. \nDuring the Navaratri festival, which extends over a period of 10 days, the temple hosts cultural performances and rituals. \nDuring occasions such as Saptharosha and Iratharosha, numerous devotees gather to contribute towards the temple's financial needs. The Poongavanam festival also witnesses a plethora of artistic and cultural events, attracting participation from people of various ethnic backgrounds. Throughout the 17-day celebration, each day is marked with unique rituals and festivities, including the Kailasha Utshavam on the 5th day, the Vettai Thiruvizha on the 13th day, the Sappara Utshavam on the 14th day, the Ther Utshavam on the 15th day, the Theertham on the 16th day, and concluding with the Poongavanam on the 17th day.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sidymella angularis (also known as the common square-ended crab spider), is a species of crab spider endemic to New Zealand. \nLike all thomisid spiders, this species does not make a web, but lies in wait for prey to appear nearby. It eats insects, or occasionally other small spiders. It lives in leaf litter on the forest floor or in low vegetation. A closely-related and similar species S. angulata has the same range and habitat.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe species was first described by in 1885 by Urquhart in the genus Sparassus. It was placed in the genus Sidyma by Bryant in 1933; however, it was discovered that a genus of moths had already been called Sidyma, so in 1942 Strand provided the replacement name Sidymella. It is a member of the subfamily Stephanopinae in the family Thomisidae.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nSidymella angularis is one of the square-ended crab spiders. These spiders have a trapezoidal abdomen, giving them a truncated appearance. This species can occur in a variety of colours including shades of grey, yellow and brown, and has a gnarled body texture. It can be distinguished from the related Sidymella angulata by the presence of two longitudinal ridges on the cephalothorax. These are absent in S. angulata, which also has a large socketed forward-pointing spine on the femur of the first leg.\n\n\n== Behaviour ==\nSquare-ended crab spiders, including S. angularis, can use thanatosis (playing dead) to avoid predators. Their colouring and texture help create the appearance of a fragment of bark or debris, but after dropping to the ground on a dragline, they often end up upside down. In New Zealand Spiders and their Worldwide Kin, husband and wife spider experts Ray and Lyn Forster describe how a square-ended crab spider can turn itself the right way up by pushing with its legs and using the square-end of the abdomen as a pivot point. \nLike other New Zealand thomisids, S. angularis is an ambush predator rather than a snare builder. It lies in wait, using its powerful front legs to grab prey before delivering a bite. These legs are armed with spines that prevent prey escaping.\nTheir flat-looking egg sacs  are often laid on the underside of dead leaves, with females frequently standing guard.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nSidymella angularis is only found in New Zealand. It is the commonest of New Zealand's square-ended crab spiders, and is found from Northland to Stewart Island. It occurs in habitat ranging from suburban gardens to native bush, and is often found on ferns, particularly on tree trunks, dead ferns, and in leaf litter.\n\n\n== Phylogenetics ==\nA preliminary phylogenetic analysis suggests New Zealand stephanopines including S. angularis diverged from their Australian relatives approximately five million years ago.\n\n\n== Conservation status and threats ==\nSidymella angularis is listed as Not Threatened as of 2020, under the New Zealand Threat Classification System. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\tVariation in colour of S. angularis\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nSidymella angularis discussed on RNZ Critter of the Week, 26 April 2024.",

Its tournaments have been held annually since 1949 (with only 11 interruptions), and it is organized by the Paraguayan Basketball Confederation.\nIn some years the absolute champion was defined in a final between the winners of the Apertura and Clausura tournaments, in the event that the same club had not managed to win both tournaments, in which case it automatically won the absolute title. In previous years, the absolute title was obtained by the winner of the Copa de Campeones, which was contested between the champions of the Top Profesional Metropolitano and the Liga Nacional.\nSince 2017, it was established that each championship (Apertura and Clausura) will be considered an absolute title and there will be two champions per year. After the  COVID-19 pandemic, it was played annually again.\n\n\n== Teams ==\n\n\n=== 2024 Season ===\n6 teams participate in the 2024 LNBF season.\n\nCiudad Nueva\nColonias Gold\nDeportivo San José\nFélix Pérez Cardozo\nOlimpia Queens\nSol de América\n\n\n== Winners list ==\nFrom its inception until the 2016 season there was only one absolute champion per year.

        "content": "Tommi Jaakkola is a computer science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, serving as a Principal Investigator at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. \nHis work focuses on machine learning and natural language processing, specializing in topics such as inference, semi-supervised learning, information retrieval, and reinforcement learning.\nIn 2017 he was elected a fellow of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence in recognition of “significant contributions to the fields of machine learning, computational biology and natural language processing”.\n\n\n== Career ==\nJaakkola graduated from Helsinki University of Technology in 1992 and received his Ph.D. from MIT in computational neuroscience in 1997. Following a postdoctoral position in computational molecular biology he joined the MIT EECS faculty in 1998.\nJaakkola's research aims to tackle inferential, algorithmic and estimation questions in machine learning, including large scale probabilistic distributed inference, deep learning, and causal inference. The applied side of his work has involved problems in natural language processing such as parsing, regulatory models in computational biology, computational chemistry, and computational functional genomics.\nHe has done extensive research on unsupervised systems that can be passively trained to learn language more like humans, so that they can work using just audio. One of his translation models runs more efficiently than traditional “monolingual” translation models by viewing words as vectors that can be clustered with other words that have similar meanings.\nAnother major topic area is explainability and better understanding how machine learning systems produce outputs. With MIT professor Regina Barzilay he has demonstrated methods for better interpreting the rationale behind the decisions of language models.\nJaakkola has also done work related to drug development, producing machine learning models that can jointly learn drug-target interaction and drug-drug synergy to uncover new drug combinations to better protect against coronaviruses.\nHis papers have received more than 45,000 citations, with an h-index of 94. In 2022 he received the AISTATS Test of Time Award for co-authoring the paper ”Approximate Inference in Additive Factorial HMMs with Application to Energy Disaggregation”. He has also held editorial positions on journals such as the Journal of Machine Learning Research.\n\n\n== References ==",

While he is widely recognized for his streaming career, Rafiq initially gained recognition as a YouTuber where he would upload gaming videos on NBA 2K and Fortnite. He previously streamed on Twitch before joining Kick in 2023.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nRafiq was born on August 13th, 2004. His father, Rafiq Wazir Ali was part of a Pakistani Pop/Rock band called Strings.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 2019, Rafiq began gaining popularity throughout his videos and live streams where he would rage and start going by the nickname \"Ronnie2K's son\" in reference to Ronnie Singh who has the nickname \"Ronnie2K\" and is the Digital Marketing Director for 2K Games. The \"Ronnie2K's son\" phrase became a popular meme within the NBA 2K community due to resemblance between Rafiq and Ronnie Singh which resulted in \"Ronnie2K\" posting a meme video on TikTok for Fathers Day in 2021.\n\n\n=== YouTube ===\nBefore predominantly posting clips and highlights from his Kick live streams, Rafiq started publishing YouTube videos in October 2016, posting player builds and gameplay videos on the video game NBA 2K17.\nOn May 30, 2017, before live streaming on Twitch or Kick, Rafiq would live stream on YouTube. On his first stream he was seen playing the video game Grand Theft Auto V. Later that year he would begin to start live streaming NBA 2K17 which was the video game he was making videos on before live streaming.  During his live streams Rafiq would play with and against his viewers throughout different NBA 2K video games. \nOn October 14, 2019, Rafiq would have his last published YouTube live stream before fully switching over to stream on Twitch.\n\n\n== References ==",

Ikhrek, Safavid Shirvan, Safavid Empire – d. 1760) was a Rutul poet who wrote poems mainly in Azerbaijani Turkish.\n\n\n== Life and creativity ==\nThe main part of Ikhrek Rajab's work consists of love poems. According to folk legends, he loved a girl named Huri, but the girl's father married Huri to a rich man. Therefore, Rajab's poems dedicated to Huri formed the basis of his creativity.\n“Söylərəm” (“I will say”), “Mənəm mən” (“This is me”), “Mən” (“I”) are among his famous poems. In them, the main place is occupied by the state of the lyrical hero, accompanied by sadness and melancholy. These poems are distinguished by the fact that they lack a clearly defined object - it seems to be dissolved in time and space. Accordingly, the relationship of the subject to the object is not emphasized. The main attention is focused on the subject himself.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===",

        "content": "Shinkuchan (Chinese: 新堀江; pinyin: Xīnkūjīang) is a car-free shopping, eating and entertainment district of Kaohsiung. Shinkuchan is a collection of several streets and alleys and is packed with boutique clothing shops and restaurants along with many stalls selling food, snacks, and drinks. Shinkuchan shops and stalls start to open mid-afternoon and the neighbourhood has many small alleys with small houses that have been turned into places to eat.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nCovering the area of Wufu 2nd Road and Renzhi Street of Kaohsiung City, Shinkuchan is renowned for its wide array of local and overseas fashionable clothing and accessories as well as special designer products. Similar to Ximending in Taipei, Shinkuchan is a popular Kaohsiung attraction involving youth and newfangled fashions, gourmet foods, and entertainment.  Shinkuchan Commercial District has become the largest market in southern Taiwan for imported goods. Products from Paris, Milan, Hong Kong, and Tokyo can be found there, mostly oriented to teenagers. The district is close to many other tourist attractions, including 85 Sky Tower, Asia New Bay Area, Central Park, Liouhe Night Market.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe real birth of Shinkuchan was in the context of the collapse of the surrounding business district after a fire broke out in the Datong Department Store on October 29, 1995. In 1997, Liu Yifu, general manager of Shinkuchan, cooperated with the Ministry of Economic Affairs to comprehensively transform the district. Although this fire destroyed Datong Department Store, which had been operating for 20 years, it also gave the business district outside Datong Department Store an opportunity to reorganise.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nShinkuchan can be accessed by walk from Exit No.2 of the Kaohsiung Metro Central Park station.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSanduo Shopping District\nXimending\n\n\n== References ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "EditorConfig is an open specification and file format for Syntax highlighting, text editors and integrated development environment (IDEs) that aims to maintain a consistent coding style, particularly aimed at groups working together. It can help keep multiple editors as well as individuals using the same conventions. It stores configurations in a file which can be shared by multiple people or used in multiple editors (by the same person or by many). It defines rules for how to format different programming languages or other structured text files with conventions such as what character to end a line with and how to manage indentation.\n\n\n== Concept ==\nThe project web site states \"EditorConfig helps maintain consistent coding styles for multiple developers working on the same project across various editors and IDEs. The EditorConfig project consists of a file format for defining coding styles and a collection of text editor plugins that enable editors to read the file format and adhere to defined styles. EditorConfig files are easily readable and they work nicely with version control systems.\"\n\n\n== Specification ==\nThe configuration is typically stored in a UTF-8 encoded text file: .editorconfig.  Some tools allow saving their style preferences as an EditorConfig file.\nEach line:\n\nMay be blank (only Whitespace characters\nA comment that begiings with ; or #\nA section header, which starts with a square bracket [, and ends with a square bracket ].\nA sectionheader may not have any non-whitespace characters outside of the brackets\nIt may contain any characters between the backets including whitespace/tabs\nIt uses forward slash characters /  as path separators\nBackslashes \\ are prohibited, even on Windows.\nKey-Value pair, with a = separating the key from the value\nAny other line format is invalid. It does not support in-line comments. If there is a ; or # character anywhere other than the start of line it is considered to be part of the text of the line.  It does not support any character escaping.\n\n\n=== Parts/sections of file ===\nPreamble:  optional key=value pairs that precede the first section.\nSection Name: String between [  ]\nSection: the key value pairs that follow a section name until the start of the next section.\n\n\n=== glob expressions ===\nSection names are file path globs, using a format similar to .gitignore, and are based on Unix convetions.\n\n\n=== File location ===\nEditorConfig plugins look for a file named .editorconfig in the same directory that contains an existing file, and in parent directories of that one until it hits the root filepath (e.g. / in Linux/Unix/MacOS or C: in the case of Microsoft Windows, or it finds an .editorconfig file that contains a line that states root=true.\nThe most recent rules found take precedence in the order they are read.  So rules in the same directory as the file would over-rule rules from higher level directories.\n\n\n=== File format ===\nEditor config uses the common INI configuration file format.\n\n\n=== Style options ===\n\nSome tools support additional options such as max_line_length (which forces a hard line wrap after the specified number of characters) (supported by Emacs, Vim, Atom, and several others)\n\n\n== Implementation ==\nMany popular editors have adopted support of the specification.  The GitHub page for the project has libraries written in GO programing language, C programing language,  and Python programming language, and there is a Node.JS library as well. There is a comprehensive listing of editors available on the project site.\n\n\n=== Editors reported to work without use of a plug-in ===\nGitea, GitHub, IntellijIdea, PyCharm, and editors by JetBrains, Kate, Komodo, Visual Studio, Vim/Neovim.\n\n\n=== Editors which require a plug-in ===\nSome editors require installation of a plug-in:\nEclipse IDE, Atom, Emacs, Geany, JEdit, Notepad++, Netbeans, Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text\n\n\n=== Build environment which require a plug-in ===\nApache Ant, Gradle, Apache Maven\n\n\n=== Editors which don't support EditorConfig ===\nThere is no list maintained of all the various text editors or IDEs which do not support EditorConfig (e.g. Spyder IDE has had support mentioned in the past, but does not seem to yet include it.\n\n\n=== Other software development tools which implement EditorConfig ===\nPrettier\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Airlie Conference Center, commonly referred to simply as Airlie, is a historic hotel outside of Warrenton, Virginia. The compound is best known for having become a safe space for dialogue during the US civil rights movement, and as the origin of Earth Day.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Original estate 1899-1958 ===\nIn the 1890s, socialite Harry Connelly Groom moved from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Fauquier County, Virginia. There he purchased land to build a manor from Adeline h. Edmonds. Groom named the estate the \"Airlie House,\" after a Scottish castle.\nIn 1924, a fire and accompanying structural accident caused damage throughout the building. Because of this, Groom renovated the house through the 1930s. After his death, his daughter Susan Groom Harney inherited the estate.\n\n\n=== Modern building 1959-1970 ===\nHarney sold the home to Dr. Murdoch Head in 1959, who embarked on a series of renovations to create a hotel and conference facility. The renamed \"Airlie Center,\" opened in 1961 with a variety of new programs held at the facility including environmental research, public health, and education.\nIn 1962, Life Magazine dubbed the Airlie Center an \"island of thought\" to which professionals could retreat without distractions. That year, the NAACP hosted its first annual civil rights conference at Airlie. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. visited Airlie later in the 1960s.\nIn 1969, Wisconsin Senator Gaylord Nelson sponsored a conference at Airlie to promote Earth Day, a then new holiday he created with U.S. Representative Pete McCloskey.\n\n\n=== 1971-present ===\n\nDuring the 1980s a film company named Airlie Productions operated at the center. The company produced over 250 documentaries and won three Emmy's.\nIn 1988, more than 150 LGBTQ individuals attended The War Conference to promote human rights. The purpose of this conference was to increase support from legislators and civil rights organizations.\nIn 2014, the Airlie Hotel opened to the public for the first time in its history. The next year, Airlie was inducted into the Historic Hotels of America.\n\nIn 2016, the Airlie Foundation entrusted American University with stewardship of the property.\n\n\n== Conception of Earth Day ==\nSenator Nelson was inspired by the Vietnam anti-war movement to promote environmental conservation. He and Representative McCloskey gave a speech at Airlie in 1969 to establish a new holiday, \"Earth Day,\" to promote their environmental conservationist ideals. Earth Day would eventually become a well-established international holiday.\nIn 1993, Senator Nelson planted a tree at Airlie to commemorate their 1969 meeting that promoted the Earth Day holiday.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Las voladoras (English: The Flying Women) is a book of short stories by Ecuadorian writer Mónica Ojeda, published for the first time in 2020 by publishing house Páginas de Espuma. The book is composed of eight stories that take place in Andean settings which are marked by mysticism, violence, ancestral rites, and horror, in a style that the author herself defined as Andean gothic. Some of the themes she addresses include: feminicides, domestic violence, grief, child abuse, forbidden love, and abortion, among others.\nThe book was well received by critics and was included in several lists of the best books of 2020. Moreover, it was a finalist for the Premio de Narrativa Breve Ribera del Duero and the Premio Finestres literary awards.\nThe title Las voladoras comes from the first story in the book, which in turn is based on a myth from the town of Mira, in Carchi Province, Ecuador. The people of Mira believe that women go into a magical trance during the night, go up to the roofs of their houses, spread honey on their underarms, and start to fly, all of this without having any memory whatsoever of these events the morning after.\n\n\n== Contents ==\nSeven of the eight stories in the book had never been published before. The eighth, Caninos, was originally published in 2017. The stories are the following:\n\n\n== Writing and themes ==\n\nAccording to Ojeda, the original idea for the book was born out of a creative curiosity for the possibilities that short stories could offer, as a result of the publication of Caninos in 2017. In turn, this gave her the notion to write a book in which each story was connected organically through the same general idea, which the author decided would be the Andean gothic genre. This term reached Ojeda through Ecuadorian academic Álvaro Alemán, who had mentioned it years before in a conference of Ecuadorian scholars. Since there had not been any academic theorizing on the concept at that time, Ojeda was able to freely explore in her book the idea of the Andean gothic genre, which she later defined as un tipo de literatura que trabaja la violencia (y por tanto el miedo) generada en una zona geográfica específica: la Cordillera de los Andes, con todas sus narraciones, mitos, símbolos y su desnuda contemporaneidad. As in some of her previous works, the general themes she chose for the book include fear, horror, and violence.\nOjeda wrote the book during a three-month period from her residence in Madrid. This first draft was completed in December 2019 and sent to the literary competition Premio de Narrativa Breve Ribera del Duero, which included it among its finalists in February 2020. In the following months, Ojeda worked on polishing the book, a process that coincided with the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSome of the stories in the book include legends from the oral tradition of the Andean peoples, specifically in stories like Las voladoras (which includes the creatures of the same name that are native to the town of Mira, in Carchi Province), Cabeza voladora (which mentions the witches known as umas), and to a lesser extent in Soroche (which makes a reference to the myth of the suicidal condor). Apart from these legends, some stories were inspired by other authors or by reports in the crime section of newspapers. The idea for Cabeza voladora, for instance, was born when Ojeda found out about a feminicide that took place in Ecuador, in which a woman had been beheaded. This incident coincided with her readings about the umas and their ability to willingly detach their own heads. In El mundo de arriba y el mundo de abajo, Ojeda sought to write a story in the manner of an incantation, reminiscent of the poem Weeping for Pedro Jara, by  Ecuadorian poet Efraín Jara Idrovo. Terremoto, which the author referred to as a \"story-poem,\" was inspired by the writings of Canadian poet Anne Carson.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe book was very well received by critics. Before it was published, Ojeda sent the manuscript for the book with the title El mundo de arriba y el mundo de abajo to participate in the 2020 version of the literary competition Premio de Narrativa Breve Ribera del Duero, in which it finished among five finalists out of 1,079 entries. Afterwards, it finished among the three finalists of the 2021 version of literary award Premio Finestres de Narrativa. Media outlets and cultural magazines such as El País, El Mundo, The New York Times, and Culturamas included it in their lists of the best books of 2020.\nThe review by newspaper El Periódico de Catalunya, written by Ricardo Baixeras, praised the book, referring to it as un libro de una contundencia asombrosa, conformado por una estética unitaria en unos relatos que respiran un mismo aire lingüístico. Claudia Sterling, from digital outlet Pulzo, was even more complimentary, praising in particular the use of the horror genre in the book, to which she referred as a whole, thusly: [un] verdadero tesoro de la literatura latinoamericana, made up of relatos sublimes que nos reconectan con la naturaleza, los mitos y el Universo. On his part, Ecuadorian writer Eduardo Varas highlighted the strength of the language used by Ojeda, the thematic unity of the work, and its exploration of horror and grief.\nSpanish writer Marta Sanz, in a review written for El País, remarked on Soroche and Caninos, referring to them as \"excelentes cuentos (...) que invitan a taparse los ojos con la mano. Y dan calambre\", apart from referring to Ojeda as a \"sabia escritora de ambición telúrica\". In an analysis published in magazine Amazing Stories, academic Iván Rodrigo Mendizábal referred to El mundo de arriba y el mundo de abajo as the esencial story in the book, an opinion shared by José Miguel Giráldez, from El Correo Gallego, who also singled out this story as his favorite and referred to the book as a whole as [un] libro coherente y brutal. In an interview, Ojeda herself said that El mundo de arriba y el mundo de abajo was her favorite story in the book.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMónica Ojeda\nLatin American Gothic\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Additional bibliography ==\nAguilar Giler, Génesis Priscila (2022).

        "content": "Fredo Durand is a computer scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), where he helps lead CSAIL's Computer Graphics Group.\nHe works on both computer graphics and vision, spanning topics such as computational photography, differentiable rendering, compilers for high-performance imaging, and video magnification. \nSeveral of his projects focus on trying to reveal visual signals that are otherwise imperceptible to the human eye. With MIT colleagues he developed a “motion microphone” device that can take silent video of an object and magnify the visual vibrations from the video to recreate the sounds present in the room. He also helped develop a system that can look at short video clips of people sitting still and visual magnify their movement and skin-color changes such that he could measure people's heart-rates, enabling new applications for remote health monitoring. \nAnother project uses video of shadows on the floor to be able to detect things hidden around the corner, an insight that could help self-driving cars better detect objects in their blind spots. His team's “Interactive Dynamic Video” system lets them test how an object would respond to different kinds of touch based only on a short video clip of it.\nHe has also created several influential tools for computer graphics. With Saman Amarasinghe and Jonathan Ragan-Kelley he invented a domain-specific language (DSL) called Halide for image processing. Their research showed that Halide offers major speed and performance gains over hand-engineered code, and uses code that is also much easier to read. Halide has received interest from both academic and industry partners, who have incorporated it into products such as the Google Pixel's cameras, Adobe's Photoshop filters and YouTube's video-uploading system. \nDurand received his PhD in 1999 from Grenoble Institute of Technology in France, supervised by Claude Puech and George Drettakis. \nHe co-organized the first Symposium on Computational Photography and Video in 2005, and the first International Conference on Computational Photography in 2009. \nDurand received an inaugural Eurographics Young Researcher Award in 2004, an NSF CAREER award in 2005, an inaugural Microsoft Research New Faculty Fellowship in 2005, a Sloan fellowship in 2006, a Spira award for distinguished teaching in 2007, and the ACM SIGGRAPH Computer Graphics Achievement Award in 2016.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The play Lucifer is a 1654 tragedy set in Heaven, written by the Dutch playwright and poet Joost van den Vondel, and premiered on 2 February in the city theater of Amsterdam. When God decides to elevate Man above the Angels, the high-ranked angel Lucifer initiates a revolt which ends when archangel Michael ejects the revolters from Heaven with a bolt of lightning. Lucifer then avenges himself on earth by seducing Adam and Eve to commit original sin, causing their banishment from the Garden of Eden. After the second performance on February 5 the burgomasters of Amsterdam, pressed by the clergy, banned further performances. Lucifer is widely regarded as Vondel's masterpiece and one of the greatest works of Dutch literature. It has been said that Lucifer is \"one of the rare products of Dutch literature that occupies a steady place in the Western canon.\"\nAs a young poet, Vondel associated the Lucifer character with the theme of unjust uprising. The many examples of Luciferism in international politics of the 1640s finally prompted him to give life to the Lucifer-conception inside him. The result is an original work: though all names derive from the Bible, the plot itself is not based on any existing story. In Vondels collected plays in two octavo volumes of 1662, edited by the playwright himself, Lucifer appears in the volume with non-Biblical plays.\nDedicated to kaiser Ferdinand III of the Holy Roman Empire, the play is written in alexandrines, with the choirs concluding each act in four- to three-foot iambes. The structure follows the five stages of classical Greek drama, yet timeless and spaceless Heaven does not accommodate all three of Aristotle's unities of time, place, and plot. Literary scholars have long been confused by the question wether the Fall of Man does obstruct the unity of plot. Another aspect of structure that provoked much discussion is the question wether Lucifer is already in the camp of evil from the start or if his character concurs with Aristoteles's norm for a protagonist, and so in the course of the play, after much hesitation and contemplation, becomes a member of evil. Scholarly concentration upon the theological background of the play gradually gave way to study of themes such as free will, and the relation of belief versus reason. The tragedy's parallels to the political situation of Vondel's time, remarkable as they are, do not have such bearing as to constitute a political allegory.\nAfter performance was forbidden, selling the text became officially illegal as well. Yet six reprintings of the quarto appeared in 1654 alone. The play was not performed again until the nineteenth century. In 1825 a British theory was launched, holding that Lucifer was a source for John Miltons Paradise Lost, which after initial acceptance was discredited in 1895. Lucifer has been translated into French, German, English, Hungarian and Japanese, among other languages.\n\n\n== Plot ==\n\n\n=== Act 1 ===\nThe angel Apollion returns from Paradise, where he has spied on Adam and Eve. Lucifer ordered him to do so, because God has decided to elevate man to a hierarchical level superior to the angels, who will have to serve man. Still under the impression of the beauty of both Paradise and Eve, he reports to Belzebub, who is concerned that men's capacity for reproducing will in time overshadow the power of the angels. Then the archangel Gabriel announces God's decision about the coming of Christ, whom the angels will have to revere. The choir praises the Lord and stresses the necessity to serve him.\n\n\n=== Act 2 ===\nLucifer appears on his chariot, embittered by his degradation in rank. He swears to do anything in his power to prevent the elevation of man from happening. Belzebub agrees with him, citing the right of the firstborn as justification for the view that unjust is done. Lucifer would rather be expelled from heaven than to accept God's decision: \"To be the first prince in some lower court/ Is better than within the Blessed Light/ be second, or even less.\" Lucifer asks Gabriel for an explanation, but the archangel Gabriël has no answers, but just presses Lucifer to unconditionally accept the decision. Lucifer replies that it touches God's honour to elevate the lowly creature man.\nAs soon as Gabriel leaves, Lucifer vows at all cost to prevent man's elevation, even if the world order must be destroyed. He then calls for Apollion, and announces his plan to eliminate archangel Michael, the commander of God's army of angels. Apollion responds by saying that even contemplating such a plan is blasphemy. Despite God's almight and the strength of Michaels army, Belzebub believes in a chance to win. Lucifer orders Apollion and Belial to come up with a plan to wins as many angels as possible over to revolt.\nBelial thinks up a catchy slogan or the revolt: \"For all eternity,/ Mankind to lock without the gate of Heaven.\" They develop a plan in three stages: first, to stimulate uproar with false reason; second, Belzebub must attach his authority to the revolt with the acknowledgment of the grievance and the assurance that things should remain as they are now; third, Lucifer must become the leader by feigning reluctance to do so, and then feigning to be overrided by Belzebub. The choir asks why there is darkness in heaven, and concludes that jealousy made it so.\n\n\n=== Act 3 ===\nThe Luciferists, as the revolutionairies are called, are in dispute with the choir. Then Apollion and Belial arrive. Belial asks what the cause of the uproar might be, prompting the choir to call in their assistance. But Belial and Apollion show much understanding for the grievances and claim the revolters are justified in their jealousy. Now the choir warns the two not to stimulate the uproar.\nThe arrival of Belzebub sets phse two in motion. Belzebub behaves like an officer who catches his men in an uproar. He asks what the matter is, and the Luciferists offer him the leadership of their gang. He responds that negotiations with God are called for. The Luciferists, running out of patience, demand violence, strength, and revenge. Belzebub feigns to prefer a peaceful solution or the conlict.\nAccording to the plan Lucifer should now appear, but instead Michael arrives. He acts like a general and places the responsibility for the uproar upon the highest in rank, Belzebub. Michael warns that negotiating is allowed, but resistance is not. This does not quite work out as expected, the Luciferists demand that no servants in heaven are ranked below earthlings, and threaten with violence. Michael orders the Luciferisten to withdraw, and to lay down their weapons. As both orders are ignored, Michael sneers: \"No longer art thou sons of the Light.\" His third and last order is that the good angels secede themseves from the bad angels. He leaves with the choir, leaving the Luciferists with Belzebub, whose doubleplay is now over.\nLucifer arrives, speeches to the mob. They offer him the hatchet, but he pretends not to want a war, but the Luciferists reject his reasoning. He accepts the position of leader of the revolt: \"I console myself to turn violence with violence.\" gewelt te keeren met gewelt.\" Belzebub underscores the decision with incense and candles. The choir complains about the envy and deceit.\n\n\n=== Act 4 ===\nAs the smell of incense reaches the highest realm of heaven, Gabriel informs Michael that it is time to confront Lucifer and his gang. His servant Uriël brings his weaponry, while archangel Rafael, who personifies God's mercy, tries to make Lucifer change his mind. He makes Lucifer doubt his revolt, but ultimately he cannot believe mercy is still possible. Rafael warns Lucifer for the penalty of not only being cast out of heaven, but acquiring the appearance of an ugly dragon in the process.\nRafael accuses Lucifer of pride and envy, but also offers him a last chance. This prompts Lucifer to declare his \"despair soliloquy\" in which he acknowledges that his revolt against God is unjustified. But he cannot believe mercy is still possible, and when Gabriel sounds his trumpet that the battle is to begin, Lucifer is ready for war. In a final gesture to prevent this, Rafael prays with the choir or Lucifer.\n\n\n=== Act 5 ===\nAfter the battle is over, Urriel reports to Rafaël how it went. The crucial moment was when Lucifer with his axe hit upon Michael's shield with God's name in diamond on it. With a bolt of lightning Michael throws Lucifer to the earth. During his fall, Lucifer changes into a monster, a genuine devil.\nAfter the report the choir sings to Michael. But then Gabriel arrives with the news of the fall of man. On earth, Lucifer lost no time seeking his revenge, and already succeeded in seducing Adam and Eve to eat from the forbidden tree. Michael orders Uriel to banish Adam and Eve from Paradise. The choir prays for the arrival of the Messiah.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Debate over influence upon Miltons Paradise Lost ===\nIn 1825 two English poets suggested Vondel's Lucifer influenced Paradise Lost, the poem John Milton began composing in 1658, four years after the publication of Lucifer. Robert Southey wrote, possibly at the suggestion of his friend the Dutch poet Willem Bilderdijk, that Milton would have been familiar with both Vondel's Lucifer and his Adam in Exile. Thomas Lovell Beddoes restricts his assumption of Vondel's influence to Lucifer. Milton knew some Dutch and may have had some interest in the Dutch opinion of Cromwell's revolution. According Milton's Dutch translator Peter Verstegen, however, Milton's mastery of Dutch was not sufficient to read Vondel's tragedies. Whenever Milton communicated with Dutchmen, the language was Latin. Milton would then be sooner familiar with Grotius' Adamus exul than with Vondel's emulation of that tragedy, Adam in Exile.\nYet in 1854 Rev. A. Fishel confirmed Beddoes's suggestion, prompting a debate between twelve Dutch, British, Germans, and French scholars that ran until 1903. In 1877 Critic Edmund Gosse published an essay on Vondel called A Dutch Milton, in which he claimed that at least Book six of Milton's epic was influenced by Lucifer. In 1885 the British clergyman George Edmundson published his book Milton and Vondel. A Curiosity of Literature, in which he argued that Lucifer supplied the basis for Milton. Ten years later, this claim was refuted by J.J. Moolhuizen in his dissertation \"Vondel's Lucifer and Milton's Paradise Lost\", written in Dutch (Vondels Lucifer en Miltons Verloren Paradijs, The Hague, Martinus Nijhoff publishers, 1895), written with, in the words of Vondel scholar Molkenboer, \"a sense of justice only equalled by his sharp analytical insight.\" Moolhuizen showed that the so-called parallel verses by Vondel were of Edmundson's own making by way of additions and eliminations in his translation. Molkenboer points out \"the irony, that the laurel, offered our major poet so chivalrous by an Englishman for having fertilized Milton's genius, was rejected just as chivalrous by a Dutchman.\"\nSince then, the consensus among Dutch scholars is that the similarities between the two works of literature are of too general a nature to speak of direct influence: Vondel and Milton just chose the same Biblical material to build upon. British historian J.L. Price states in neutral terms that Vondel in Lucifer treats the same problems as Milton does in Paradise Lost. As late as 1966 Charles Delmer Tate showed in his dissertation on Milton and Vondel that in the nineteenth century Vondel was still perfectly unknown in Britain and that before that century not one British library held a copy of his writings.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n=== English translation of Lucifer ===\nNoppen, Leonard Charles van (1898).

        "content": "Palaeohodites is an extinct genus of primate from the Eocene Nadu Formation of China. Living about 35 million years ago during the late Eocene, Palaeohodites belongs to an extinct group of primates known as adapiforms, related to modern day lemurs and lorises. Specifically, this genus is one member of the family Ekgmowechashalidae, known primarily from the Eocene and Oligocene of Asia. Notably, Palaeohodites has been recovered as the sister taxon of Ekgmowechashala, the latest primate known to exist in North America before the arrival of humans at the end of the Pleistocene.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nPalaeohodites is a monotypic genus currently represented only by the species P. naduensis. Palaeohodites belongs to the family Ekgemowechashalidae. The affinities of this clade have historically been quite contentious, with most previous research placing it within either Omomyidae or Plagiomenidae, which are typically considered as primates and dermopterans, respectively. More recent analyses have definitively recovered ekgmowechashalids as adapiform primates based on various characters such as their retention of a double-rooted lower second premolar, a plesiomorphic trait that does not occur in omomyids or anthropoids.\nThe family Ekgmowechasdhalidae includes two subfamilies: Bugtilemurinae, containing the genera Bugtilemur and Muangthanhinius, and Ekgmowechashalinae, containing Palaeohodites and Ekgmowechashala itself. The genus Gatanthropus has also been recovered within the family, but its exact placement relative to the other genera and subfamilies remains unresolved.\n\n\n== Biogeographic implications ==\nPalaeohodites lived in present-day China during the late Eocene, several million years before its sister taxon, Ekgmowechashala, appears in North America. As its morphology has been described as intermediate between that of Ekgmowechashala and more primitive Asian ekgmowechashalids, Palaeohodites provides evidence that Ekgmowechalinae originated in Asia, not North America. This suggests that Ekgmowechashala itself represents an immigrant lineage from southern Asia, where primates could take refuge in lower latitudes from the global cooling across the Eocene-Oligocene boundary that drove the extinction of their North American counterparts.\n\n\n== Description ==\nAlthough it was first discovered in the 1990s, very few specimens of Palaeohodites have been found, and a few upper and lower jaw fragments are all that is known about its anatomy. Palaeohodites shared many dental similarities with Ekgmowechashala, including the presence of double-rooted P2's, with a slight distinction being that Palaeohodites possessed more widely spaced roots. Both genera also had highly crenulated enamel, suggesting a diet that included hard foods like nuts and seeds. Unlike Ekgmowechashala, Palaeohodites also had longer and narrower P2 and P3. The upper molars (based on M2) of Palaeohodites and Ekgmowechashala share a unique feature in having a duplicated protocone cusp lingually, which is one of the most important characters supporting a close evolutionary relationship between these two primates. The distinctive upper and lower molars of Palaeohodites support it having a herbivorous diet consistent focusing on hard objects.\n\n\n== Paleoenvironment ==\nPalaeohodites lived in the Baise Basin of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in southern China near the Eocene-Oligocene boundary. The Baise Basin, more specifically the Nadu Formation where Paleohodites was discovered, is a rocky terrain filled with mudstone, sandstone, and coal. The adapiforms, including Palaeohodites, would have inhabited a subtropical climate similar to that of modern-day Madagascar. Evergreen and deciduous broad-leaved trees would have been widespread and easily accessible around the terrain, providing abundant food and habitat resources for arboreal species like Palaeohodites'.\nPalaeohodites lived just prior to the Eocene-Oligocene boundary, an interval marked by significant climatic changes, including the transition from the Eocene greenhouse to the Oligocene icehouse. The drastic drop in temperature associated with the Eocene-Oligocene boundary likely played a crucial role in the mass extinction of adapiforms living in North America and Europe by rapidly altering their environment. While the direct impact of this cooling event on Palaeohodites remains uncertain, it was probably able to survive the climatic deterioration around the Eocene-Oligocene boundary by inhabiting the warm, subtropical ecosystem of southern China and adjacent regions.\n\n\n== Morphology ==\nThe upper and lower molars of Palaeohodites resemble those of Ekgmowechashala, with both taxa having a duplicated protocone on upper molars and neomorphic cusps on the lower molars. A prominent neomorphic cusp on the lower M1 is located on the central part of the postvallid, but additional neomorphic cusps occur in other locations on the lower molars. Palaeohodites and Ekgmowechashala share a similar number of cusps on M2 and a prominent \"lingual wall\" of cusps and crests that may be partly homologous with the postprotocingulum. Palaeohodites differs from Ekgmowechashala in having the protocone and duplicated protocone very closely spaced, while these structures are farther apart in Ekgmowechashala. The lower premolars of Palaeohodites and Ekgmowechashala are similar as well, both having a double-rooted P2 and P3. The lower premolars of Palaeohodites are longer and narrower than those of Ekgmowechashala.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Slave trade in the Mongol Empire refers to the slave trade conducted by the Mongol Empire (1206–1368). This includes the Mongolia vassal khanates which was a part of the Mongol Empire, such as the Chagatai Khanate (1227–1347), Yuan dynasty (1271–1368), Ilkhanate (1256–1335) and Golden Horde (1242–1368).\nIn pre-imperial Mongolia, slavery had not played any big part, but the Mongol invasions and conquests of the 13th-century created a great influx of war captives, which were by custom considered legitimate to enslave, and caused a significant expansion of slavery and slave trade. \nThe Mongol Empire established a massive international slave trade founded upon war captives enslaved during the Mongol conquests, which were distributed by market demand around the Empire via a network of slave markets connected through the cities of the Empire.\nThe slave trade network established thorough the Mongol Empire was partially built upon earlier slave markets, and partially upon new. Many centers of the slave trade survived the fall of the Mongol Empire, notably the major Bukhara slave trade, which survived until the 1870s.\n\n\n== Background and supply ==\n\nThe Mongol slave trade was based on war captives and human tributes, and the constant warfare and conquests of the Mongol Empire and their vassal khanates supplied a constant influx of enslaved people to the slave trade network of the Empire. This contributed to the constant warfare within the Mongol Empire.\nThe Mongol warfare developed routines for the capture of slaves. When the Mongols captured a city, the routine were to enslave people deemed to be suitable for the slave market, such as craftsmen and other skilled artisans.\nThere was a system for whom were enslaved. One practice was to count the boys of a captured city and select one of ten as a prisoner, and then do the same with girls.  \nIf a man had three sons, one was selected for enslavement.  \nAll adult men and women who were unmarried were defined as legitimate for enslavement.\nThe established standard for war captives was to ask for ransom for war captives and, if no ransom was offered, sell them as slaves.\nAnother method to acquire slaves were taxation in the form of human tributes from conquered states. The Mongol often asked for tribute in the form of humans; this custom was not ended in conquered Russia until the Mongols introduced a regulated tribute tax in the form of silver and fur from Russia in 1257–1259.\nEnslavement could also be used against subjugated people unable to pay their taxes or tributes. Up until the Russian Uprising of 1262, for example, the Mongols sold Russian peasants who were unable to pay tribute to the Italian slave traders in the Crimea.\nThe slave trade was fed by raids and purchase by slave traders; by tributary system in which subjugated states were forced to give slaves as tributes; and by war captives during the warfare campaigns during the Mongol Empire and its succeeding Khanates.\n\n\n=== The trade ===\nOnce captive, the enslaved people were distributed to the different slave markets around the Empire.\nThe Mongol Empire established a massive international slave trade with war captives based on the Mongol invasions and conquests, and used a network of cities to transport slaves across different parts of the Empire in accordance with market demand for particular categories of slaves; such as Christian slaves to the Muslim slave market, and Muslim slaves to the Christian world.\nThe slave trade network of the Mongol Empire was organized in a route from North China to North India; from North India to the Middle East via Iran and Central Asia; and from Central Asia to Europa via the Steppe of the kipchak territory between the Caspian Sea and the Black Sea and Caucasus.\nThis slave trade route was connected via a number of cities used to transport slaves to the peripheries of the Empire, consisting of the capitals of the Mongol Khanates - with the capital of Qaraqorum as the main center - and already existing slave trade centers, notably the old slave trade center of Bukhara.\nThe network was new but used and included many old slave trade centers, notably the Ancient Central Asian slave trade center Bukhara.\nThe different slave trade centers were used by the Empire to cater to the specific slave markets in different parts of the world, which all had different needs and a market for different categories of slaves, which together made it possible for the Empire to dispose of all slaves for the highest possible profit.\n\n\n== Slave market ==\n\nThe far reaching slave trade network of the Empire made it possible to distribute different categories of slaves to the parts of the world where they could be sold for the highest profit. \nThe slave markets in different parts of the world had different demands and were in need of different categories of slaves, which was a factor the slave trade of the Empire was able to adjust to.\nThere were three main factors to consider in order to distribute the slaves to the correct slave market for the highest profit. \nThe first factor was the religious factor; neither Christians nor Muslims bought slaves of their own religion, which made it necessary to traffic slaves across religious borders and sell Christian slaves to Muslims and Muslim slaves to Christians. \nThe second factor was military slavery, which constituted a massive market for male slaves to the Muslim world.  \nThe third factor to consider was the ethnic or racial factor. Different races were preferred for different purposes in different parts of the world, such as for example Turkish men who were preferred as slave soldiers in the Middle east; Tartars who were popular as house slaves in Italy, and Corean girls who were popular as concubines in China.\n\n\n=== China ===\n\nThe slave market in China was small, since traditionally slavery did not play a big role in China. \nThere were however a market for skilled slaves and luxury slaves. These were skilled artisans and craftsmen, girls used as concubine sex slaves, and well educated male slaves used within the sophisticated administration.\nThe slaves requested on the Chinese slave market were primarily kipchak, European Rus people and Coreans.\n\n\n=== Europe ===\n\nThe Black Sea slave trade in the North West was used by the Mongol Empire to dispose of slaves deemed suitable for use in Christian Europe. \nThe Genovese and Venetian slave trade established in the Black Sea ports in parallel with the Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus' and were flooded with slaves when the Mongols used the Italian slave traders in the Black Sea ports to dispose of war captives from the Russian campaign, and the Mongols established a long-term collaboration with the Italian slave traders at the Black Sea.\nThe Mongol Empire used the European market to dispose of mainly Muslim Tartar war captives, who was taken captives during the conquests and inner warfare and rebellions of the Empire. Muslim captives were not possible to sell in the Muslim world, but could be sold to Christian Europe, and in the period of 1351 and 1408, between 80 and 90 percent of all slaves trafficked by Genoa and Venice to South Europe from the Black Sea were of Tatarian ethnicity.\nMost slaves sold by the Mongols to Europe via the Black sea slave trade were Tatar or Mongol, though a few Chinese and Indian slaves are also noted to have been sold.\nThe slave trade to Europe mainly concerned Tatarian house slaves  to Italy, Spain and Portugal and was a small market compared to the export to the Muslim world.\n\n\n=== India ===\n\nOne of the most important markets for the Mongol Empire were the Muslim Delhi Sultanate in Northern India. The Delhi Sultanate had an import of slaves from the Central Asian slave market already before the Mongol Empire, and this trade was not interupted when the Mongols took the Central Asian Bukhara slave market, which was merely incoroporated in to the Empire's slave trade network. \nThe Delhi Sultanate was dependent on a constant supply of male Turkish slaves from Central Asia as slave soldiers, and these were regularly provided to India via the Hindu Kush from Central Asia.\n\n\n=== Middle East ===\n\nThe Muslim world of the Middle East was the biggest market for the slave trade of the Empire.\nThere were traditionally an established market in the Muslim world for slave-girls for sexual slavery as concubines, and for slave-boys for military slavery as slave soldiers.\nBukhara in Central Asia was since Ancient times a provider of slaves to the Muslim Middle East, and used by the Empire to traffick slaves suitable for the Muslim slave market; from Central Asia, the slave trade route continued via Tabriz to Aleppo.\nMale slaves for military slavery (Ghilman) were trafficked from China to the Middle East via Central Asia and Iran.  \nTurkish slave soldiers were transported from the Golden Horde in Central Asia to the Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt via the Black Sea.\nThe slave market of the Muslim world was used by the Empire to depose of Christian slaves. After the Siege of Acre (1291), the inhabitants of the city, being Frankish Christians, were deported to the slave market of Baghdad.\nIn the Ilkhanate in Iran, Mongolian soldiers reportedly often owned slaves used to cultivate the land allotted to them.\n\n\n=== Mongolia ===\nSlavery also increased in the domestic market of Mongolia during the expansion of the Empire. Mongolia itself therefore also became a destination of slaves. \nThe main capital of Qaraqorum was the main base of the cities forming the slave trade network of the Empire, and the presence of slaves of all ethnicities, such as Russians or Arabs, are noted by contemporary witnesses in Mongolia.\nThe capital of the Empire received large quantities of war prisoners for its own market. An example is the Siege of Baghdad of 1258, after which thousands of Arab people of the conquered city were taken as slaves to Azerbaijan or Mongolia.\nGenghis Khan was among many recorded warlords who would often employ the mass, indiscriminate murder of men and boys regardless if they were soldiers, civilians, or simply in the way. In the year 1202, after he and Ong Khan allied to conquer the Tatars, he ordered the execution of every Tatar man and boy taller than a linchpin, and enslaved Tatar women for sexual purposes. This order was given as collective punishment for the fatal poisoning of Genghis Khan's father, Yesugei, for which the Mongols blamed the Tatars according to The Secret History of the Mongols.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe Mongol Empire were gradually divided from 1294 until its final division in 1368. The network of slave trade cities established by the Empire continued in many cases as separate slave trades after 1368. The Ancient Bukhara slave trade, for example, continued for another five centuries until 1873.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSlavery in Egypt\nGenoese slave trade\nSlavery in the Abbasid Caliphate\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Mount Shura Site (首羅山遺跡, Shurasan iseki) is the ruins of a medieval Buddhist temple located in town of Hisayama, Fukuoka Prefecture on the island of Kyushu, Japan.  The site was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 2013.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Shurasan ruins is located in the northeastern part of the town of Hisayama. The presence of ruins on the southern side of the 288-meter mountain has been known to locals for a long time,  but no formal archaeological excavation was conducted until 2005. Several excavations have been conducted by the  Hisayama Town Board of Education and the Kyushu Historical Museum and are still ongoing. The site corresponds to the location of a temple called Tōkō-ji (頭光寺) which historical documentation states was located on this mountain. Although Hisayama is located in the Fukuoka metropolitan area, development activities have been relatively few, and the site has remained in good condition. The ruins are clustered in three areas: the summit of the mountain, the Nishitani Valley and the Sannō (Hiyoshi) area. The site is not opened to the public, but since 2020 a hiking trail cut through the area.\nAccording to legend, during the Tenpyō era (740–749), villages were afraid of a tiger which had crossed over to Japan from Baekje. After they captured and killed the tiger, they cut off its head, but as it glowed, they thought that this supernatural phenomena was due to Hakusan Gongen, so they buried the head and erected a temple dedicated to the Jūichimen Kannon on top. This is the origin of Tōkō-ji. The temple reached the peak of its prosperity during the Kamakura period, when it had over 300 chapels and hermitages on the mountain. The temple was protected by the \"Hakata Kōshū\", the merchants guild of the port of Hakata, who were mainly immigrants from Song China who had settled in Hakata, and who had formed ties with powerful temples and shrines and aristocrats, and actively engaged in trade activities between Japan and China and in the wider East Asian waters. Their period of activity spanned approximately 200 years from the end of the 11th century to the Mongolian invasion of the latter half of the 13th century. The temple was used as a guest facility for important customers involved in trade with the Asian continent. The temple was largely destroyed in the wars of the Sengoku period, although it remained a holy mountain in the Edo period, when a Shinto shrine was erected on its summit.\nArtifacts found in the Shurasan ruins include many shards of trade ceramics, such as blue and white porcelain and Jingdezhen ware from China, and Goryeo celadon from the Korean Peninsula. At the summit of the mountain is a stone pagoda called a \"Satsuma-to\". This style of monument has been found only in western and southern Kyushu and was brought to Japan from Song China.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Fukuoka)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHisayama town home page(in Japanese)\nCultural Properties in Fukuoka Prefecture(in Japanese)\nFukuoka Tourism Web(in Japanese)",

        "content": "Australian singer-songwriter Delta Goodrem has headlined seven concert tours, supported several international artists, and performed at numerous major events, festivals and award shows since the release of her breakthrough single \"Born to Try\" in 2002. During the initial success of her debut album Innocent Eyes (2003), Goodrem was unable to tour due to her cancer diagnosis in July 2003. Following a period of recovery and the release of her second studio album Mistaken Identity (2004), Goodrem embarked on her debut concert tour The Visualise Tour in July 2005, playing to 80,000 people. \nIn 2006, Goodrem performed a new song, \"Together We Are One\", at the Commonwealth Games opening ceremony and years later, would perform again at the 2018 ceremony with the song \"Welcome to Earth\". In 2009 she embarked on the Believe Again Tour and supported Andrea Bocelli in North America during his My Christmas shows. She would support Bocelli again in 2014 and 2022. To launch her fourth studio album Child of the Universe (2012) Goodrem performed the mini-tour An Evening with Delta: The Top of My World Shows and the following year headlined the 2013 Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras. \nIn 2015 and 2016, she starred as Grizabella in an Australian production of Cats, her first foray into musical theatre, and toured her fifth studio album Wings of the Wild (2016). In 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, Goodrem started a livestream concert series, titled The Bunkerdown Sessions, to unite fans during Australia's COVID-19 lockdowns. She toured her fifth studio album Bridge over Troubled Dreams (2021) in 2002 after restrictions were lifted, and joined the Backstreet Boys on 35 dates of their DNA World Tour in North America. In 2023, she embarked on the Hearts on the Run Tour – her first headlining tour of Europe – and celebrated the 20 year anniversary of Innocent Eyes in Australia with a sold out retrospective tour. Since 2020, Goodrem has hosted and performed an annual Christmas concert, Christmas with Delta, televised on the Nine Network. \n\n\n== Concert tours ==\n\n\n=== Headlining ===\n\n\n=== As support act ===\n\n\n== Concert series ==\n\n\n== Other concerts and music festivals ==\n\n\n== Award shows ==\n\n\n== Sporting events ==\n\n\n== Television programs ==\n\n\n=== 2000s ===\n\n\n=== 2010s ===\n\n\n=== 2020s ===\n\n\n== Musical theatre ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

Currently, O'Kennon is a Professor Emeritus of Mathematics, Computer Science, and Chinese at Albion College.\n\n\n== Education and career ==\nIn 1969, O’Kennon graduated from the University of Richmond. She went on to get a Master’s degree in mathematics in 1970 followed by a Master’s in computer engineering in 1981, both from Clarkson University. For seven years, she worked as an adjunct professor in mathematics at Clarkston. Afterwards, she got a job in China teaching computer science where she also learned Mandarin.\nIn 1985, after her two years in China, O’Kennon became a professor of mathematics, computer science, and Chinese at Albion College. Her main area of research was writing  computer schemes that translated languages like Mandarin, Irish, Xhosa, and some Native American languages into English, allowing people to learn the grammar for each language.\nAfter 19 at the college, O’Kennon went on to retire from her full-time position as a professor and is now a Professor Emeritus, still teaching Mathematics, Computer Science, and Chinese.\nShe continued her work on writing web-based translators for less-commonly taught languages like, Xhosa, Ojibwe, Pulaar, and Quichua.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMartha O'Kennon's Nature Blog\nMathematics And Computer Science ― Faculty And Staff\nMartha O'Kennon's Research Gate Page",
