        "content": "Pedro Pascual Gandarias Urquijo (16 February 1901 – Unknown) was a Spanish athlete, politician, and financier. He was the president of club Puerta de Hierro in Madrid, and as such, he was one of the six founders of the Royal Spanish Golf Federation. He was also a bullfighting rancher, being the owner of the Castillo de Higares ranch.\nAs an athlete, he played football for the youth team of Madrid FC and hockey for Atlético Madrid, and he was also an international golf player. In politics, he was a senator by appointment of the Crown, and on 6 March 1939, he was one of the people chosen by Franco to be part, as deputy mayor, of the City Council of Madrid chaired by Alberto Alcocer.\n\n\n== Early and personal life ==\nGandarias was born on 16 February 1901 in Madrid, as the son of Juan Tomás Gandarias Durañona, a businessman from Biscay (1870–1940), and Cecilia Urquijo y Ussía, daughter of the Marquess of Urquijo. His birth came just two days after the death of his grandfather, Pedro Pascual Gandarias, so he was named in his honor. He was the oldest of seven children, five sons and two daughters, including Juan Manuel and José.\nGandarias married Isabel Alós, daughter of the Marquess of Haro and a four-time Spanish golf champion between 1932 and 1935, a sport in which he also became international.\n\n\n== Sporting career ==\n\n\n=== Football ===\nThe three oldest Gandarias brothers, Pedro, Juan Manuel, and José, all played football for Madrid's youth team, but only one of them made it to the first team in a friendly match in 1916, with most investigations and historians agreeing that the identity of this Gandarias most likely belongs to José, even though he was only 12 at the time while Pedro was 15. He was a midfielder.\n\n\n=== Golf ===\nAt some point in the early 1930s, Gandarias became the president of Club Puerta de Hierro, a private country club based in Madrid that had a long-recorded history and sections in the fields of golf, tennis, polo, equestrianism, and Et cetera. On 9 October 1932, the representatives of the main golf clubs in Spain of the time: Pedro Cabeza de Vaca of Club de Campo, Pedro Gandarias of Club Puerta de Hierro, Santiago Ugarte of Club de Lasarte, Marcelino Botín of Club de Pedreña, Luis de Olabarri of Club de Neguri, and Javier de Arana of Club de Sevilla, met at the home of Luis de Olabarri in Las Arenas to found the Royal Spanish Golf Federation.\n\n\n=== Bullfighting ===\nGandarias was also a bullfighting rancher, whose cattle grazed on the Castillo de Higares farm, in the municipality of Mocejón, in the province of Toledo. In 1954, Castillo de Higares was used to film the 1954 movie Chateâux en Espagne (\"The Bullfighter\"), a Spanish-French co-production directed by René Wheeler and starring a popular actress, Danielle Darrieux, who denounced the rigging of the bullfights and vindicated the purity of \"The Bullfighter\" compared to the actual bullfights.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nIn politics, Gandarias was a senator by appointment of the Crown, and on 6 March 1939, he was one of the people chosen by Franco to be part, as deputy mayor, of the City Council of Madrid chaired by Alberto Alcocer.\nGandarias participated in numerous boards of directors, presiding over companies such as Iberavia, La Basconia S.A., and Portland (1930), and being a vice president of Naviera Aznar, S.A. and Banco Urquijo, a bank founded by his father and in which he obtained and held several relevant positions of responsibilities, such as a member on the board of directors between 1944 and 1974. He was also a director of Constructora Naval, Minas del Rif, Altos Hornos, Unión Española de Explosivos, Firestone, Compañía de Fernando Poo, Eléctrica de Castilla, and Unión Eléctrica Madrileña.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Facundo Pascual Quilis (20 July 1893 – 13 October 1955) was a Spanish sports leader who served as the 7th president of football club Valencia CF between 1925 and 1929. He purchased the club's white and blue shirts for Avilés local club, Stadium Club Avilesino, which eventually became the colours of the flag of Avilés.\n\n\n== Presidency of Valencia ==\nOn 21 June 1925, Pascual Quilis was appointed as the 7th president of Valencia CF, replacing acting president Pablo Verdeguer Comes, being accompanied by Juan Fortis Olaso and Ramón Ferrer Aguilar as first and second vice presidents respectively. He wasted no time and just three months later, on 18 September 1925, the club moved its headquarters to Moratín Street, numbers 6 and 8. The previous board continued to make decisions until the assembly held on June 3, 1926, the date on which Pascual Quilis was ratified as president.\nIn his first season as president, Valencia was once again proclaimed regional champion, which allowed them to compete in the 1926 Copa del Rey, but they did not qualify for the final phase. Notably, the Mestalla Stadium hosted the Cup final for the first time in its history, contested by FC Barcelona and Atlético Madrid, ending in a 3–2 victory to the former.\nIn the second year of his mandate, the  Mestalla Stadium saw its first remodeling undertaken just three years after being inaugurated. The first important change was to change the land for planted grass, in order to improve the practice of football, but the true transformation of Mestalla, which changed its appearance and at the same time provided comfort to its spectators, was the construction of a covered grandstand. The architect Francisco Almenar was in charge of the project, the same one who designed and directed the construction works of Mestalla, and who held the second vice presidency of the club. The works began at the beginning of the season and lasted for several months, during which work was done day and night without rest. The Mestalla stand, as well as the new façade and entrances, was officially inaugurated on 23 January 1927, taking advantage of the Regional Championship match that pitted Valencia against CD Castellón. The celebrations were led by Pascual Quilis, the representative of the Spanish Football Federation, Luis Colina Álvarez, and the president of the Valencian Regional Federation, José Posada Solis. With its spectacular transformation, Mestalla reached a capacity for 17,000 spectators, with the initial cost of the works being 211,981.70 pesetas.\nOn 6 April 1927, the club moved its social premises again. He left Moratín Street and moved very close, this time to Las Barcas Street, number 5, the main street. At the end of the season, on 19 July 1927, new positions were elected on the board of directors chaired by Facundo Pascual Quilis. That season, the team reached the semifinals of the Cup, after having eliminated Real Madrid in the quarterfinals, but was defeated by Real Sociedad. On 10 February 1928, at the proposal of manager Remigio Sáez Soler, Facundo Pascual incorporated Luis Colina Álvarez into the Valencia FC team as technical secretary, a position in which he remained for 28 years, until shortly before his death. His experience was fundamental in the team's development, being present in the great historical events of the entity, such as promotion to the First Division in 1932 and runner-up in the Copa del Rey in 1934.\nDuring the 1928–1929 season, he continued Facundo Pascual's directive that had ended the previous campaign. However, the club was beginning to go through an economic crisis and, at the same time, the urgent need to close new contracts became evident. To date, the Valencian entity had counted among its ranks, mostly, players from the quarry and the region, but with the imminent establishment of the National League Championship, in which the club began its journey in the Segunda Division, it became necessary, even though the moment was not ideal due to the difficult monetary situation, to spend a good sum of money on the incorporation of new players, in some cases already established and with proven quality. The critical economic scenario raised in Valencia caused the resignation of Pascual Quilis in the assembly held on 13 June 1929. His successor was Juan Giménez Cánovas, who until then had served as a member of the outgoing board.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nOn 14 May 1941, Elipidio Lozano Escalona, the First Instance Judge of Valencia, ruled to make public the complaint of the loss of 100 ordinary mortgage certificates of 500 pesetas, all of them inclusive, issued by the sports entity Valencia FC on 20 April 1933, announcing that a period of thirty days had been established so that the holder or holders can appear before his Court to make use of their right.\n\n\n== Death ==\nFernández died in Avilés on 13 October 1955, at the age of 62.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Euthanasia for mental illness involves a physician intentionally ending the life of a patient who has requested euthanasia due to a psychiatric condition. The practice is legal in Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Spain and Colombia. In Canada, legislation authorizing the procedure was passed, but has since been repeatedly postponed.\nThe practice is considered controversial as unlike with other types of euthanasia, a patient euthanized for mental illness alone is usually not terminally ill, and may have their decisional capacity impeded by their condition. It is also considered more difficult with psychological conditions to determine an objective prognosis, or whether a disorder is irremediable.\n\n\n== By country ==\n\n\n=== Belgium ===\nIn Belgium, euthanasia for mental illness is legal if the patient is mentally competent to make the decision; the patient requests euthanasia on two separate occasions in writing; the patient is suffering from an incurable disease or mental illness, and all treatment options have been exhausted; and the patient is experiencing \"unbearable suffering\" from the illness, either physically or psychologically. Three doctors must agree to grant euthanasia in psychiatric cases. Euthanasia for mental suffering is not available for children.\nAs of 2017, approximately 40 patients per year received euthanasia due to mental illness, out of approximately 2,000 total yearly euthanasia deaths.\nIn 2020, a Belgium court acquitted three doctors, who had euthanized Tine Nys, a physically healthy 38-year-old woman with autism, of manslaughter charges. Nys' sister Sophie Nys had filed a lawsuit alleging that the doctors did not properly attempt to treat her condition, and that Nys had not been incurably ill as the law required.\n\n\n=== Netherlands ===\nEuthanasia for mental illness has been legal since 2002 in the Netherlands provided the patient has \"unbearable suffering with no prospect of improvement\" and has requested to die in a way that is \"voluntary, well considered and with full conviction\", among other criteria. In 2020, the Supreme Court of the Netherlands ruled that physicians could euthanize patients with dementia if they had expressed a wish to die before the onset of their condition.\nIn 2023, 138 people in the Netherlands received euthanasia due to psychiatric conditions, a 20% increase from 2022. The first minor euthanized for a psychiatric condition was in 2023.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Baldersbæk is a house and forest estate 25 km northwest of Vejen, Denmark. Planted by Holger Petersen in the 1890s, Baldersbæk Plantation is the largest of the so-called \"Copenhagener Plantations\" (Danish: Københavnerplantager). The plantations were created in the years around 1900 by wealthy Copenhageners to promote Soil melioration in Western Jutland. Billa Baldersbæk was constructed for him in 1910. The adjacent park features a number of monuments by Anders Bundgaard as well as other features. The estate is now owned by the Holger Petersen Foundation. The park is open to the public.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1880, Holger Petersen co-founded of Plantningsselskabet Staushede. In 1891, he bought an old farm and planted the Baldersbæk plantation, which was more than 500 hectares (1,200 acres). In 1895, he also purchased Hølund in partnership with Christian Dalgas. On a journey to the area in 1892, he also convinced other wealthy businessmen to invest in plantations. He became a board member of Hedeselskabet in 1907 and was its vice chairman from 1910.\nIn 1910, Petersen constructed a country house on the Baldersbæk estate. He also commissioned the sculptor Anders Bundgaard to design a number of sandstone monuments for the park.\nAfter Holger Petersen's death, Baldersbæk was passed to the Holger Petersen Foundation. In 2013–14, Baædersbæk's park was refurbished with funding from Realdania.\n\n\n== House and park ==\nBilla Baldersbæk was constructed to designs by Bernhard and Valdemar Ingemann with inspiration from Grederiksdal House.\nThe park was designed by the landscape architect Erstad-Jørgensen. Geatures comprised a carp pond, winding paths, cottages, monuments and fountains.\nAnders Bundgaard's sandstone monuments include a statue of Holger Petersen and the Three-Hundreds-Stone. The three-metre-tall  Three-Hundreds-Stone from 1912 stands at the spot where the three historical hundreds of laugs, Malt and Skads meet. The three men depicted on the stone are Hedeselskabet-founder Enrico Dalgas, innkeeper in Hovborg J. K. Sørensen and chief forester J. C. Sørensen. They all made significant contributions to  the planting of the heaths aroundHovborg.\nOther features include some of the original sandstone sculptures from Børsen in Copenhagen. Petersen sponsored a renovation of the building and was given some of the ornaments that were renewed.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Rxternal links ==\n\nOfficial website",

After a series of chance and unfortunate incidents he meets his village neighbour Jan and slowly begins to see life in a different light.\n\n\n== Publishing history ==\nAfter its initial publication in Australia by UWA Publishing in 2016, the novel was reprinted as follows:\n\nSerpents Tail, UK, 2018 and 2019\nTin House Books, USA, 2018\nUWA, Australia, 2020\n\n\n== Dedication and epigraph ==\nDedication: \"For Christopher Hill, who understands.\"\nEpigraph: \"Who is prepared to deprive life of a significant dénouement?\" Jean Améry\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nIn The Saturday Paper reviewer \"LS\" noted: \"There is great sensitivity and heart in this story of redemption and Wilson can be blackly funny...Despite Fred’s advanced years, Extinctions is akin to a coming-of-age story. Will he mature into a good person? Wilson attempts too much, but Extinctions is a rich and humane novel peopled with compelling characters.\"\nRoslyn Jolly, in The Sydney Review of Books, comments: \"Frederick Lothian is a deeply flawed, emotionally stunted, at times repellent character. He has grave sins, both of omission and commission, on his conscience. He has contributed, with varying degrees of responsibility, to the destruction of three young lives. To speak of relationship breakdown does not begin to cover the amount of damage he has done to his marriage. Watching Fred grope his way towards self-insight and accountability is an experience both painful and fascinating, and I found his character convincing as the product of a particular childhood in particular historical conditions.\"\n\n\n== Awards ==\n2017 Miles Franklin Award, winner\n2017 Colin Roderick Award, winner\n\n\n== See also ==\n2016 in Australian literature\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "On 9 September 2001, Ahmad Shah Massoud was assassinated by two al-Qaeda operatives posing as journalists in Khwaja Bahauddin District, Takhar Province, Afghanistan.\nMassoud, a pivotal guerilla fighter nicknamed The Lion of Panjshir, had led insurgent forces against the governments of Daoud Khan, communist government under the People Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA), invading Soviet forces, and the 1990s Taliban de-facto regime. At the time of his assassination, Massoud commanded the forces of the Northern Alliance, backed by the United States, India, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Iran, fighting against Taliban forces, backed by Pakistan. Massoud remained a vocal critic of Pakistani interference in Afghanistan (through the Taliban) and Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, including publicly warning President George W. Bush five months prior to 9/11 that the situation in Afghanistan, if unresolved, \"will also affect the United States and a lot of other countries\".\nShortly after a press conference in the European Parliament, in which Massoud denounced Pakistani interference, the Taliban, and al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden called for volunteers to \"deal with Ahmad [Shah] Massoud\". From their training camp in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, al-Qaeda's Ayman al-Zawahiri and Abu Hani al-Masri planned and prepared the operation. Two Tunisian Arab attackers in Europe, Abd as-Sattar Dahmane and Rachid Bouari el-Ouaer, were brought to Afghanistan where they were provided a stolen television camera and battery belt, packed with explosives. With an interview fraudulently arranged by Zawahiri and al-Masri, the two assassins were escorted by Taliban to the Panjshir Valley, flying by helicopter to join Massoud at his rear headquarters in Khwaja Bahauddin. After weeks of failed attempts, Massoud agreed to sit with the Arabs and conduct the interview. After peppering Massoud with questions about his condemnation of bin Laden, al-Ouaer detonated his camera battery belt, mortally wounding Massoud. Despite a timely medical evacuation by helicopter to a military clinic in Tajikistan, Massoud was pronounced dead on arrival.\nThe timing of Ahmad Shah Massoud's assassination has drawn significant attention, taking place only two days before the September 11 attacks in the United States. Though the attackers lacked any control over the exact date, waiting weeks for Massoud to make time for the purported interview, many still debate whether Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri had planned Massoud's assassination with the intention of disabling the Northern Alliance before 9/11, after which the United States would join them in a campaign to topple the Taliban regime. A partially-declassified U.S. intelligence report in November 2001 revealed that Massoud's intelligence apparatus had \"gained limited knowledge regarding the intentions of [Osama bin Laden] and his terrorist organization al-Qaida to perform a terrorist attack against the U.S. on a scale larger than the 1998 bombing of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.\"\nThough al-Qaeda claimed responsibility for the attack, debates continue over allegations of Pakistani (Inter-Services Intelligence, ISI) covert support to, or complicity in, the assassination of Ahmad Shah Massoud.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== 1973 Afghan coup d'état ===\n\nIn July 1973, the last and longest-serving king of Afghanistan, Mohammad Zahir Shah, was deposed in a bloodless coup led by his cousin and prime minister, Mohammad Daoud Khan. With Zahir Shah exiled in Italy, Daoud Khan declared the end of Kingdom of Afghanistan, replaced by the Republic of Afghanistan, and announced that he would lead the country as president. Daoud, with a focus on Afghan nationalism, attempted the herculean tasks of administering the fiercely-independent Pashtun tribal areas, reuniting the two factions (Khalqis and Parchamists) of the Afghan communist party (PDPA), and reducing Soviet influence in Afghanistan in pursuit of Non-Aligned Movement ideals.\n\n\n=== 1978 Afghan coup d'état ===\n\nIn April 1978, Daoud was replaced in a coup by left-wing (communist) military officers of the Khalq communist faction, led by Nur Mohammad Taraki. The new but unpopular communist government, in contravention of Daoud's non-aligned policy, quickly sought a close relationship and support from the Soviet Union. Taraki's communist policies, to include substantial land reform, bloody purges of opposition by the secret police, and extreme social reform, ignited a fierce insurgency by socially and Islamically conservative anti-communists. Alongside an internal civil war between the Khalq and Parcham factions of the communist government. Both urban and tribal groups fighting against Taraki's government, united on shared Islamic values and envisaged a religious struggle (jihad) against the atheist Marxist-Leninist government, collectively known as the mujahideen (مُجَاهِدِين, lit. 'those who conduct jihad').\n\n\n=== Soviet-Afghan War ===\n\nThreatened by the insurgency, in December 1978, Taraki and Deputy Prime Minister Hafizullah Amin signed a friendship treaty with Moscow to secure a promise of Soviet military intervention should the government fear toppling. In mid-1979, with the mujahideen uprising only growing, the Soviet Union sent a limited contingent troops to Bagram Air Base, north of the capital Kabul, also prompting the CIA to begin non-lethal support to the mujahedeen movement. With the situation rapidly deteriorating and supporters of Amin executing Taraki (enraging Moscow), the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in a last-ditch effort to save the faltering fledgling communist government.\nTo counter the Soviet's December 1979 invasion of Afghanistan, often described as a reversal of the Soviet arming of the Viet Cong in the American war in Vietnam, the United States initiated Operation Cyclone (depicted in the book and film Charlie Wilson's War), which armed the mujahideen movement against the Soviet Union and its communist government in Afghanistan.\nIn the late 1980s, having failed to suppress the mujahideen insurgency, amounting staggering casualties, lacking territorial control outside urban areas and the ring road, and with the ultimate collapse of the Soviet Union only two years away, the Soviets withdrew in a substantial political defeat.\n\n\n=== Afghan Civil War ===\n\nFollowing the December 1989 withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan, the Afghan mujahideen continued their campaign against the communist PDPA government until its collapse in 1992. The power vacuum created by the fall of the PDPA government transitioned Afghanistan into a second civil war between insurgent factions, largest among these being the Tajik-Pashtun Jamiat-e Islami led by Berhanuddin Rabbani and Hezb-e-Islami (Gulbuddin) led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. These warlord-led insurgent factions ruthlessly shelled Afghan urban areas, none more than Kabul.\nHaving fought against Daoud Khan's government, Taraki's communist government, Soviet forces in Afghanistan, and the remaining communist government from his base in the Panjshir Valley, Ahmad Shah Massoud joined Rabbani's Jamiat-e Islami as his military commander where he earned the title \"Lion of the Panjshir\".\nDuring both the Soviet-Afghan War and CIA-led Operation Cyclone, Pakistan's military and its intelligence service, Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), played the most outsized role in supporting political Islamist mujahideen groups. The Pakistani government, namely under the dictatorship of Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, sought to create a Pashtun-dominated Islamist government in neighboring Afghanistan that would anchor its foreign policy to the Islamic and Pashtun-friendly Pakistani establishment, as opposed to Pakistan's paramount adversary, the secular and Tajik-friendly India. Despite more than a decade of support as ISI's most-favored group to assume power in Kabul, Hezb-e Islami (Gulbuddin) failed each attempt to take control of Kabul and bled popular support under its persistent and bloody shelling of the city.\n\n\n=== Taliban conquest ===\n\nLosing confidence in Gulbuddin's group, and committed to opening Afghanistan's Central Asian land trade routes (once part of the Silk Road) the ISI turned to the infant but promising Taliban movement. Pashtun, conservative, Deobandi, and Islamist, the Taliban movement in Kandahar appealed greatly to the Pakistani ISI after demonstrating it could seize the Spin Boldak border crossing from a variety of mujahideen who had setup informal chain tolls along Afghan roads. As the route for Pakistani trucking opened, support from the ISI increased and replaced Gulbuddin's faction as Pakistan's most favored group to take power in Afghanistan. After Spin Boldak, the Taliban captured Kandahar Airport, Kandahar City in November 1994, and western Herat in 1995.\nWith the rising Taliban threat to Kabul, Rabbani and Massoud's Jamiat-e Islami united with other mujahideen groups in Kabul and the north to form the United Islamic Front for Salvation of Afghanistan, better known as the United Front or (in the West) the Northern Alliance. Despite a number of tactical successes against the Taliban, Massoud was forced to withdraw his forces north from Kabul into the Panjshir, ceding the capital city to the Taliban in 1996.\n\n\n=== Northern Alliance resistance ===\n\nHolding the northern portion of the country, principally the Panjshir Valley to the north of Kabul and Mazar-e-Sharif in the northwest, the Northern Alliance was recognized by its backers (India, Iran, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, the United States, and Uzbekistan) as the lawful and representative, though displaced, government of Afghanistan with Rabbani as President and Massoud as Minister of Defense. Fighting against the de-facto rulers of Afghanistan, the Pakistan-backed Taliban, Ahmad Shah Massoud continued to vocally denounce Pakistani involvement in Afghanistan.\nFollowing the 1992 Aden hotel bombings, 1993 World Trade Center bombing, 1995 car bombing of American troops in Riyadh, 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, and October 2000 bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen, a number of governments became especially concerned with the Taliban's post-1996 hosting of Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaeda training camps. After the East African embassy bombings, the United States conducted Operation Infinite Reach, bombing al-Qaeda targets in Sudan (where bin Laden had stayed prior to 1996) and Afghanistan. In early 2001, prior to the September 11th attacks in America, the CIA, R&AW, IRGC, and SCNS routinely met with Ahmad Shah Massoud in Afghanistan to coordinate support to the Northern Alliance against the Taliban and al-Qaeda.\n\n\n== Speech in Strasbourg ==\n\nOn 2 April 2001, President of the European Parliament Nicole Fontaine announced that she had invited Ahmad Shah Massoud, describing him as the \"Vice-President of the Islamic State of Afghanistan\", to Strasbourg, France to discuss human rights under the Taliban including the disenfranchisement of and violence against women and their destruction of the revered Bamiyan Buddhas, which had occurred one month prior. The 5 April 2001 visit, Massoud's first to Europe, comprised a meeting with Fontaine, Presidents of the French Senate (Christian Poncelete) and National Assembly (Raymond Forni), and later a press conference in the European Parliament during which he received a standing ovation. Fontaine's invitation was not without opposition within the French government, the strongest of which came from the French Foreign Minister, Hubert Védrine, who had thrice met with Taliban ministers, and eventually agreed to a short breakfast meeting with Massoud before the latter's press conference.\n\nSpeaking at the press conference, Massoud advocated for humanitarian aid to Afghans and calls for democratic elections, but extensively discussed the foreign backers of the Taliban to include Saudi Arabia, but primarily Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), warning of the dangers of growing Islamic extremism in Afghanistan. Massoud detailed the sweeping military, political, and economic support the Pakistani ISI provided various Islamic fundamentalist groups in Afghanistan after the Soviet withdrawal to include both the Taliban, and since 1996, Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda foreign fighters in Afghanistan. Citing bin Laden specifically, Massoud warned that he posed a threat to Afghanistan and the larger world, specifically the United States, often termed 'prophetic' following the September 11 attacks months later.\n\nBehind the whole situation in Afghanistan, and all those extremist groups, there is the regime in Pakistan, and especially the military part of the regime and its intelligence service, which is supporting all these extremist groups... My message to President [George W.] Bush is the following: If peace is not re-established in Afghanistan, if he doesn't help the Afghan people, it is certain that the problem of Afghanistan will also affect the United States and a lot of other countries... Their objectives are not limited to Afghanistan. They consider Afghanistan as the first phase to a long-term objective in the region and beyond.\nLater reflecting on her decision to invite Ahmad Shah Massoud, Fontaine wrote \"As head of the largest democratic parliament in the world, which represents 380 million citizens, I feel completely in solidarity with the resistance against the most hateful fanaticism... We expected a warlord. What we saw was someone who was seeking a political solution, as a true architect of peace. I will never forget that day.\"\n\n\n=== Bin Laden's response ===\nRebuking Massoud's public criticism, Osama bin Laden asked his followers \"Who will take it upon himself to deal with Ahmad [Shah] Massoud for me, because he harmed Allah and his sons?\" according to Abu Jandal, a later-disillusioned personal bodyguard to bin Laden who was told \"a few brothers volunteered to assassinate Massoud and be rewarded by Allah.\"\n\n\n== Attack preparations ==\n\n\n=== Assassins ===\nThe operation's two attackers were Tunisian Arabs: 39-year-old Abd as-Sattar (var. Abdessattar) Dahmane (عبد الستّار دحمان; lit. 'servant-of-the-Veiler Dahmane') under the alias Karim Touzani and 31-year-old Rachid Bouari el-Ouaer (راشد بوعري الوائر) under the alias Kacem Bakkali. For the operation, Dahmane was designated to be the leader of the two and to play the role of interviewer with el-Ouaer as camera operator.\nDahmane was born 27 August 1962 in the coastal city of Gabès, Tunisia's sixth-largest city. Dahmane grew up in the poor Tunisian town of Jendouba in the country's northwest until traveling to the capital city of Tunis to pursue a journalism degree. Dahmane's professors describe him as a quiet student and it was at the university where he fell in love with one of his peers, described by Massoud's biographer, Sandy Gall, as \"a very pretty Tunisian girl with long brown hair.\" Dahmane and his lover moved to Belgium on a residence permit and eloped there.\nDahmane attempted to graduate from three universities, including the prestigious French-speaking UCLouvain, but failed to graduate from any of the three. With little prospect for completing his education or finding stable work, Dahmane was close to bottoming-out and losing his Belgian residency, making him a ripe candidate for recruitment by al-Qaeda in the mid-to-late 1990s. It was then that Tarek Maaroufi, a Tunisian Islamic extremist whose Europe-based group was later responsible for the 2000 Strasbourg Cathedral bombing plot, suggested to Dahmane the prospects of jihad in Afghanistan. Further, the Syrian jihadist Sheikh Bassam Ayachi, head of the Centre Islamique Belge in Molenbeek-Saint-Jean which Dahmane frequented, introduced Dahmane to the Moroccan-born Malika el-Aroud (later infamous as one of Europe's most prominent online jihadists) and officiated their wedding after three months. Without money and without a job, Dahmane quickly became conservative in his faith: growing out his beard, discarding his Western clothes, declining to shake women's hands, abandoning alcohol, and even walking out on a family dinner upon discovering that his brother was a Shia Muslim.\nLittle is known of Bouari el-Ouaer, described only as \"bigger, stronger, and [looking] like a boxer.\"\n\n\n=== Obtaining the camcorder ===\n\nOn 24 December 2000, Jean-Pierre Vincendet had been filming Christmas Eve decorations on store windows in the southeastern French city of Grenoble for TF1 when, \"faced with five threatening individuals\", he had his Sony Betacam BVW-200 AP camcorder stolen. Vincendet followed the individuals to note their getaway car's registration number before reporting the theft and vehicle to police.\nAccording to Waheed Muzda, the stolen camcorder, along with a load of office supplies, were picked up in Quetta, Pakistan and driven across the Spin Boldak–Chaman border crossing to al-Qaeda's cultural office in Kandahar, Afghanistan. Muzda, who had worked for the post-1996 Islamic Emirate's (Taliban) Foreign Ministry and frequently attended meetings between the Taliban government and Osama bin Laden, told Fiona Gall in an interview that Abu Hani al-Masri and the two journalist had carefully unpacked the camcorder with Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, Abu Hafs Kabir, Saif al-Adl, and Mahfouz Ould al-Walid. Later in a Facebook post, Muzhda would explain that he could not understand either the seeming importance of the two journalists or why they were so careful in unpacking the camcorder until after Massoud's assassination.\nThough French police closed the theft case in May of 2001 without result, Vincendet eventually received a call from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) sometime after Massoud's assassination, reportedly stating \"We found your camera, but it's in pieces,\" having matched the destroyed camera's serial number to Vincendet's case. Vincendet later learned that the getaway car used was not reported stolen, but was owned by a resident of a town in Roussillon who \"disappeared\". On September 10th, 2021, the provincial French-language newspaper Le Dauphiné libéré published a podcast with Vincendet in which he recalled the night his camcorder was stolen and the period of depression after learning how his camcorder was used in the assassination of Ahmad Shah Massoud.\n\n\n=== Arranging the interview ===\nIn July 2001, approximately three months following Massoud's speech to the European Parliament, Ayman al-Zawahiri, the Egyptian cofounder of al-Qaeda and number two in the organization, wrote a fraudulent letter in faulty French to Massoud purporting to be from the Islamic Observation Centre in London, requesting two journalists to interview Massoud. In the same month, following up on the letter, Pashtun leader Abdul Rasul Sayyaf (eponym for Abu Sayyaf Group), a close associate of bin Laden from the Soviet-Afghan War who had later allied with Massoud's Northern Alliance, received an 'out-of-the-blue' phone call from Abu Hani al-Masri, a senior al-Qaeda shura council member and friend from the jihad against the Soviets. Abu Hani told Sayyaf that he was talking via satellite phone in Bosnia, where many Afghan Arab jihadists traveled after the Soviet withdrawal, and in two separate calls, asked for help arranging an interview for two Arab journalists with Massoud.\nThe telephone number from which Abu Hani al-Masri called Abdul Rasul Sayyaf was discovered written on a document carried by Bouari el-Ouaer, the purported cameraman in the assassination operation. With it, American intelligence officials traced the call to reveal that Abu Hani had not called from Bosnia, as he told Sayyaf, but from Kandahar, where al-Qaeda planned both the September 11th attacks and Massoud's assassination. Abu Hani had left his work fighting and propagandizing jihadism in Bosnia, Chechnya, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Somalia to join Osama bin Laden when the latter returned to Afghanistan from Sudan in 1996. Following the September 11th attacks, Abu Hani al-Masri traveled to Malaysia where he was arrested in 2005 and extradited to his home country of Egypt. Abu Hani was imprisoned for six years under the Mubarak administration until, as officials from the new Afghan government arranged a trip to interview him in Egypt about the assassination, he was freed with thousands of other prisoners during the Arab Spring. Abu Hani fled to Syria to join Ahrar ash-Sham as a senior commander, allied with al-Qaeda's Syria branch, until his death in a February 2017 U.S. drone strike in Idlib Governorate.\n\n\n== Assassins' travel ==\n\n\n=== Darunta training camp ===\n\nDahmane, at a low point, was recommended by a Tunisian friend and later founder of the Tunisian Combatant Group, Tarek Maaroufi, to travel to Afghanistan for jihad. With encouragement from his similarly-radicalized wife, Malika al-Aroud, Dahmane explained that he would travel first, and that she was to join him later. Another Tunisian Belgian, Adel Tebourski, who performed logistics for al-Qaeda, provided Dahmane and his wife with the necessary finances and travel tickets. Provided with Belgian passports stolen from the Belgian Consulate in Strasbourg and the Belgian embassy in The Hague, Dahmane and his fellow-operative Bouari el-Ouaer collected one-year, multiple-entry Pakistani visas supposedly issued by the Pakistani High Commission in London. Days later, the two boarded a flight at London Heathrow, landing at Islamabad International Airport, and drove through the Khyber Pass and Torkham border crossing into Afghanistan's Nangarhar Province. The two settled at al-Qaeda's Darunta training camp, only a few miles outside the provincial capital of Jalalabad, where al-Qaeda recruits trained with weapons, explosives, and conducted physical fitness training.\nMalika al-Aroud joined Dahmane at Darunta in January 2001 where the two were provided a house by al-Qaeda. In August 2001, the month prior to the assassination, Dahmane explained to his wife that he would be leaving soon and that he had been given a camera and was being dispatched as a journalist to report from within Massoud's camp, adding \"Perhaps I will not return from the front.\"\n\n\n=== Panjshir Valley ===\n\nDahmane and al-Ouaer departed the Darunta training camp on 12 August 2001, driving northwest through Taliban-controlled Afghanistan to the Northern Alliance-held Panjshir Valley. Following an alternate route from Surobi along the Tagab Valley, the Arabs' reached Gulbahar, an entrance to the Panjshir Valley, where their Taliban escort departed and the two were received by the Panjshiri mujahideen. With the interview already approved by Massoud following Zawahiri's forged letter to Abdul Rasul Sayyaf purporting to be from the London-based Islamic Observation Centre, the Northern Alliance commander responsible for that region, Bismillah Khan, had ordered a car prepared for the Arabs. From the initial checkpoint they were driven to a second checkpoint and brought into Sayyaf's office. According to Amrullah Saleh, the Arabs reportedly instructed the Panjshiri driver to drive carefully to avoid damaging their equipment. Shortly after, the Arabs stayed with commander Bismillah Khan in Charikar, Parwan, who made arrangements for the two to tour the Northern Alliance's front lines in Panjshir.\nJust over a week after the Arabs' arrival, they conducted interviews with the top leaders of the Northern Alliance, including Ahmad Shah Massoud, President Burhannudin Rabbani, Shia leader Sayed Mustafa Kazemi, and Pashtun leaders Haji Abdul Qadeer and Abdul Rasul Sayyaf, who had all gathered at Sayyaf's office for a meeting. According to Ahmad Jamshid, Massoud's personal secretary and cousin, \"They [the Arabs] were always asking Sayyaf, 'We would like to interview Massoud, where is Massoud, when can we see him?'\". The Arabs failed to meet with Ahmad Shah Massoud despite his attendance at the meeting.\nSeveral days later, the Arabs were driving north up the Panjshir Valley were they were housed at a VIP guest house used for significant visitors, including at times CIA officials.\n\n\n=== Helicopter to Takhar ===\nWith Massoud's return to his Khawja Bahauddin headquarters in the northern province of Takhar, Dahmane overheard British traveling writer Matthew Leeming speaking over a satellite phone and later approached him to ask if he knew of Ahmad Shah Massoud. When Leeming responded in the affirmative, Dahmane asked \"We are doing a television documentary about Afghanistan, and we need to get on a helicopter to Khawja Bahauddin. Do you have General Massoud's [phone] number?\", to which Leeming offered an explanation for why Massoud likely did not openly share his number.\nAt a high operational tempo, Massoud continued to fly back-and-forth between his northern (rear) headquarters in Khwaja Bahauddin, where he'd meet with CIA, RAW, Tajik officials, and other foreign backers, and the Panjshir Valley to meet with his operational commanders. Shortly before departing one of his stops in Panjshir, Massoud invited the Arabs to join him on the helicopter ride north to Takhar, but the Arabs were too slow arranging their luggage and missed the flight, a delay Amrullah Saleh believes to be caused by their attempts to set or modify the bomb.\nHaving missed Massoud's original helicopter flight north, the Arabs joined a second helicopter trip north two days after, along with French journalists to include Françoise Causse, who managed to take a photograph of Bouari el-Ouaer, who attempted to cover his face with his right hand. Causse later recounted how she, suspicious of the two, interrogated Dahmane in French, who told her he represented an information agency of the Arab world based \"in London — but independent of governments and states.\" When asked \"Who finances you?\", Dahmane answered \"I don't know. I am a simple journalist. I don't have access to this type of information. Those things are kept secret.\" Another passenger onboard the aircraft, French-Afghan university professor Shoukria Haider, recalled the Panjshiri security guards angrily searching the Arabs' bags and clothing twice, but found nothing.\n\n\n=== In Khwaja Bahauddin ===\nThe Arabs waited nine days in Khwaja Bahauddin, impatiently waiting for an opportunity to interview Massoud. Waiting on Massoud's invitation, they stayed with The Christian Science Monitor correspondent Edward Girardet who recalled his own suspicion towards the Arabs, including asking the Northern Alliance's intelligence officer, Asim Suhail, who they were and where they said they came from. Suhail showed Girardet the letter forged by Zawahiri. Girardet later wrote that he had never heard of the organization and that the Arabs had tried for weeks to conduct their interview with Massoud. While waiting, the Arabs went out to purportedly shoot footage around Khwaja Bahauddin, but when asked by Girardet how the recording was going, was always met by dejected and unenthusiastic responses.\n\n\n== Assassination ==\n\nHaving stayed awake to read the poetry of the Persian poet Hafez until anywhere between 1:00 to 3:30 AM (AFT) with his close friend Masoud Khalili, Ahmad Shah Massoud awakened later in the morning of 9 September 2001. Receiving reports the night before that Taliban forces had launched a number of attacks against the Northern Alliance on the Shomali Plain, Massoud had issued orders to have his helicopter ready by morning to fly southward to Charikar, on the western ridge of the plain, so that he could meet with his commander, Bismallah Khan, and review the operational progress. After waking, however, new reports conveyed that Taliban operations had eased, prompting Massoud to call off his previous plans and instead drive to review forces in Khwaja Bahauddin District of Takhar Province.\nOn his way to Khwaja Bahauddin, Massoud passed the guest house in which Khalili and the two Arabs were staying. The house, approximately 9 × 7 meters in size, was previously the home of one of Massoud's commanders who had provided it to Massoud for meetings with important guests. The exact location of the building remains publicly unknown. Shifting plans once more, Massoud decided to stop and conduct the interview and sent his bodyguards back to the group's headquarters. Entering the house between 11:00 and 11:30 AM, Massoud found his intelligence chief, Engineer Arif, briefing Khalili. Massoud instructed Khalili that they would conduct the interview with the Arabs and then drive north to the Amu Darya (Oxus) River, which delineates Afghanistan's northern border with Uzbekistan and Tajikistan.\n\n\n=== Interview ===\nMassoud sat in the upstairs room with Khalili, his protocol officer Engineer Asim, intelligence chief Engineer Arif, and personal secretary Jamshid sitting shoulder-to-shoulder on his right. Mohammad Fahim Dashty, a close associate and later spokesman of the post-2021 National Resistance Front under Massoud' son, was also present in the room with a small camera. The two Arabs entered the room and, after Massoud apologized for the delay, Abd as-Sattar Dahmane (playing the role of interviewer), from Francophone Tunisia asked \"My English is not good, can you speak French?\" Told no, Dahmane instead spoke in slow, broken English through Khalili, who translated for Massoud in Dari. Khalili asked Dahmane what newspaper he represented, to which Dahmane responded that he did not belong to any paper, instead belonging to the Islamic Centre in London. Khalili warned Massoud \"He is not a journalist,\" but Massoud encouraged him to continue.\nPrior to filming the supposed interview, Massoud asked the journalists about the areas under Taliban control, to which Dahmane responded \"They criticize you and you criticize them... We belong to the Islamic Centre and we want to find the problem [sic] of the Muslim people in the world.\" Massoud asked for the list of questions to be asked, was handed a sheet of paper by Dahmane, and read all fifteen questions, eight or nine of which were about Osama bin Laden. Khalili later recalled in his statement to Scotland Yard the following questions:\n\n\"If you take Kabul, what do you do with Osama?\"\n\"If you capture Osama, what do you do?\"\n\"Why did you say Osama was a bad Muslim in France?\" referring to Massoud's speech to the European Parliament\n\"Why do you say there is a difference between moderate and fundamentalist Islam?\"\n\"Why don't you consider him [Osama] a leader?\"\nHaving quietly reviewed the questions, Massoud told Khalili in Dari that he was ready, and that the Arabs should begin filming. Khalili relayed the message in English and Bouari el-Ouaer (in the role of cameraman), \"pulled the table away very harshly,\" prompting a laugh from Massoud. He setup the camera's tripod at its lowest level approximately half-a-meter (around 1.5 feet), in front of Massoud, which Khalili remembered as being far too close to properly film. Massoud, in likely his final words, instructed Khalili \"Tell him to ask the question.\" Dahmane asked in English \"What is the situation in Afghanistan?\", and, as Khalili translated the first word to Massoud, Bouari el-Ouaer detonated the explosives-packed camera battery belt he wore.\n\n\n== Immediate aftermath ==\nThe explosion tore the two Arab assassins apart and its shrapnel prompted severe blood loss across Ahmad Shah Massoud's front and torso. Though Massoud took the majority of the blast, Masood Khalili, sitting to Massoud's right, sustained serious injuries and shortly fell unconscious, losing functionality of one of his eyes and one of his ears. Thinking the explosion part of a Taliban air raid, Massoud's guards rushed upstairs from the ground floor to find him on the ground bleeding. Massoud reportedly instructed the guards to find his friend and close advisor, Masoud Khalili, before attending to him. As Massoud's intelligence chief Engineer Arif and personal secretary Jamshid ran upstairs, they observed guards carrying Massoud, who was also missing part of his right-hand ring finger, downstairs to drive him via a Toyota Land Cruiser to the heliport for medical evacuation. Massoud and others wounded were loaded into the helicopter, fortunately having just landed and still fully operational, and flown northward across the border into Tajikistan to a field hospital in Farkhor.\nFarkhor, a small Tajik border town with a population of 25,300, hosts Farkhor Air Base. Five years before Massoud's assassination, India's intelligence and covert action agency, the Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW), secretly negotiated with the Tajik government under president Emomali Rahmon and foreign minister Talbak Nazarov to use the air base (India's first abroad) for intelligence gathering, medical aid, and military resupply to Massoud's Northern Alliance. Massoud and others wounded in the assassination were taken to the secret, Indian military-operated field clinic for treatment, landing in the garden. There, an Indian doctor pronounced him dead on arrival, suggesting Massoud had died only minutes after the explosion.\n\n\n== Concealing news of Massoud's death ==\n\nMassoud's body was moved north to Kulob as his colleagues quietly arranged for all those in Massoud's inner circle to rendezvous in Kulob and decide a way forward. Engineer Arif called General Fahim Khan, Massoud's top military commander, on a satellite phone stating \"Something's happened to Khalid,\" using their codeword to describe Massoud, and instructions on how to get to the hospital in Kulob. Massoud's nephew also placed a call to Amrullah Saleh, providing him curt details to arrive at the hospital. Engineer Arif and other accompanying Panjshiri leaders decided that Massoud's death should, at least temporarily, be kept a secret. The leaders feared that if word got out to both the Taliban and Massoud's fighters in the Panjshir Valley, the Taliban would capitalize on Massoud's death and his Northern Alliance fighters would fall into a panicked retreat.\nAmrullah Saleh appeared first in Kulob to join four to five of Massoud's commanders around his corpse. Shortly after top commander Fahim Khan arrived, followed by Engineer Arif, a member of Tajikistan's intelligence service, the State Committee for National Security (SCNS), followed by an officer of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), and Abdullah Abdullah, a medical doctor and foreign policy advisor to Massoud recalled from a trip to New Delhi. Discussing how to keep secret news of Massoud's death, the IRGC officer present offered that the IRGC and SCNS could covertly fly Massoud's corpse to Mashhad, Iran to help \"keep his death secret for one month, six months, whatever you need.\" Some suggested flying Massoud's body back to the Panjshir. Finally, SCNS officer suggested they could use a nearby morgue for a few days, upon which all agreed.\nMassoud's colleagues called the displaced president of Afghanistan, Burhanuddin Rabbani, who was living in the northeastern province of Badakhshan, to break the news of Massoud's death. Rabbani quickly agreed with Massoud's colleagues to cover up Massoud's death, suggesting that he should be described as only slightly injured and in a hospital in Tajikistan. Rabbani also agreed to appoint General Fahim Khan to succeed Massoud as the military head of the Northern Alliance.\n\n\n=== Informing international partners ===\nWith both crucial decisions made, for Fahim Khan to succeed Massoud, and for Massoud's death to be concealed, the group agreed to explain the truth of the situation to the six governments providing the most critical support to the Northern Alliance against the Taliban: the United States through the CIA, Russia through the FSB, Iran through the IRGC-QF and VEVAK, India through the RAW, Tajikistan through the SCNS, and Uzbekistan through the NSS (today, SSS).\nAmrullah Saleh, was tasked with passing word to the CIA, calling Counterterrorist Center (CTC)'s chief, Rich Blee, on an encrypted line. Saleh provided the same message as the other contacted governments, later recalling the message essentially stating \"If resistance to the Taliban and al-Qaeda means something to you, we can hold. We can fight. We will fight. Bu if you wanted to help Commander Massoud only — he is not with us anymore. To compensate for his loss, we need more help than in the time when he was alive.\" Saleh also stressed to Blee that word must not get out about Massoud's death, to prevent a collapse of the Northern Alliance's military lines. Blee, dutifully notified the White House of the news. After only a few hours, news services were openly reporting that Massoud had been killed, citing confirmations from anonymous Bush administration officials. Saleh called Blee back, stressing the difficulty that the White House leak had created. Returning to questions of support from the U.S., Saleh told Blee \"The decision is that we will fight. We will not surrender. We will fight to our last man on the ground. This resistance was not about Massoud. It was about something much much bigger. We will hold... What can you do for us?\" Blee, on Monday, 10 September 2001, needing a few days to plan, told Saleh \"Let me come back to you on this.\"\nAlso on the day following Massoud's assassination, one day before the September 11th attacks, bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri were attending a vigil for the father of former Taliban interior minister. At the gathering, two Saudi-born al-Qaeda members bragged to the Taliban deputy interior minister, Mullah Mohammed Khaksar, that Massoud had been killed. Khaksar rebuffed the news, citing the Northern Alliance's statement that he had only been wounded. The Saudis responded \"No, believe me, he is gone\" and boasted that it had been done at the order of bin Laden.\n\nOn Tuesday, 11 September, al-Qaeda would conduct the deadliest terrorist attack in history and prompt a multi-decade Global War on Terrorism, beginning with an American-led invasion of Afghanistan. The timing of the attack, two days before the September 11th attacks has garnered significant attention. The exact date of the attack was not dictated by the attackers who were on their ninth day in Northern Alliance guesthouses awaiting an invitation from Massoud or his associates to conduct the interview. Insufficient evidence is available to prove or disprove the claim that Massoud's assassination was planned tactically to disable the American-allied Northern Alliance before a potential post-9/11 American invasion of Afghanistan.\n\n\n=== International reporting ===\nOn 10 September 2001, the British Broadcasting Company (BBC) was the first major outlet to discuss news of the assassination. The BBC's Afghanistan correspondent, Kate Clark, published a profile on Massoud, noting an \"assassination attempt\" that had only left Massoud \"wounded.\" Unaware of the attack's success, almost certainly the result of Massoud's colleagues' decision to conceal news of his death, the article nonetheless explains:\n\nIt is difficult to over-estimate how serious a blow it would be for the alliance if it transpires that he has been seriously injured or killed in the attack... So far, despite some intense fighting, neither side has gained much territory. But the loss of Ahmed Shah Massoud would push the balance, perhaps, decisively, in the Taleban's favor.\nThe only major U.S. newspaper to publish news of the assassination prior to the September 11th attacks was The New York Times. On the fourteenth page of the International section on September 11th, written and printed before the attacks began, the Times published an article titled Reports Disagree on Fate of Anti-Taliban Rebel Chief. The article first provides the Northern Alliance statement, with assurances from Massoud's brother Ahmad Wali Massoud, that Ahmad Shah Massoud was lightly wounded but recovering in a hospital in Dushanbe where \"doctors are very optimistic.\" The article then, indicative of White House and State Department leaks contrary to the express pleas by Amrullah Saleh in notifying the CIA of the truth, states:\n\nUnited States intelligence officials said today that they strongly believed that Mr. Massoud had been killed in the attack. They said the Central Intelligence Agency had reliable reports that after the bombing, Mr. Massoud died on a helicopter en route to Dushanbe, the capital of next-door Tajikistan. The White House and State Department remained cautious on the matter. \"I personally can't say he's dead,\" one White House official said.\nConfidence in reports of Massoud's death came on 14 September 2001, three days after the September 11th attacks, following a statement by French Foreign Minister Hubert Védrine to Agence France-Presse (AFP): \"It appears to be confirmed that Ahmed Shah Massoud, the head of the Afghan opposition, has died.\" Védrine's statement was widely republished on 15 September, amplified by the fallout of the September 11th attacks.\n\n\n== Official investigations ==\n\n\n=== Scotland Yard ===\nAt the request of Massoud's brother and Afghan ambassador to London, Ahmad Wali Massoud, Scotland Yard initiated a formal investigation into the assassination. The service justified its jurisdiction citing Yasser al-Siri's residence in London. Al-Siri, granted political asylum in Britain 1994 after receiving an in-absentia death sentence for the attempted murder of the Egyptian prime minister, was well-known to British security services as a close friend of al-Qaeda co-founder Ayman al-Zawahiri.Residing in London, Zawahiri's fraudulent letter authenticating the operatives as members of the Islamic Observation Centre, bore al-Siri's signature as head of the center.\nTeams from Scotland Yard traveled to Kabul to begin interviews and photographing evidence. Though evidence had been collected and al-Siri arrested by the British, Pakistani President General Pervez Musharraf quietly asked Britain to drop the case and it did. This request for intervention continues to spur suspicions of Pakistani involvement or complicity in the assassination.\n\n\n=== Belgium ===\nOn 26 November 2001, Belgian and French police detained 14 accused of connections to Osama bin Laden. Six were charged and eight released.\n\nOn 30 September 2003, a court in Brussels sentenced Tarek Maaroufi, who had urged Dahmane to travel to Afghanistan in pursuit of jihad, to six years on charges of aiding in the assassination of Massoud through his involvement in a fraudulent passport ring.\nIn February 2005, Malika el-Aroud, the widow and of lead attacker Abd as-Sattar Dahmane who had encouraged her husband's plans to travel to Afghanistan and joined him at al-Qaeda's Darunta training camp near Jalalabad, was charged by Belgian police along with her second husband, Moez Garsalloui, for their ties to al-Qaeda. Despite al-Aroud's outspoken support for the group and a CNN interview in which she explained how she ran an online forum for al-Qaeda announcements and propaganda, el-Aroud was acquitted. In June 2007, however, Garsalloui was found guilty of inciting violence and support for criminal organizations while el-Aroud was found guilty for aiding and abetting him.\nReceiving only a suspended sentence, el-Aroud was detained once more in December 2008, and, in May 2010, was found guilty and convicted of \"leading a terrorist group linked with al-Qaeda\" which principally involved the recruitment of fighters in Belgium and France and facilitation of their travel to Afghanistan.\n\n\n=== France ===\nFrench police, using the serial number provided by French journalist Jean-Pierre Vincendet, identified the camera used in the assassination as the one stolen from Vincendet in December 2000.\nOn 18 May 2005, three French residents: Adel Tebourski, Abder Rahman Ameroud, and Youssef el-Aouni, were sentenced to 2–7 years for providing logistic support to the two assassins, including funding and the provision of stolen passports. Facing a maximum of 10 years, the three men convicted were said to have operated a France-based al-Qaeda network training in the Forest of Fontainebleau (south of Paris), in the French Alps, and on the coast of Normandy. Two other suspects, Ibrahim Keita and Azdine Sayeh, were acquitted. In the investigation, which the presiding judge clarified was not the investigation into Massoud's assassination, Tebourski (41) admitted to investigators that he had helped finance Dahmane's travel to Afghanistan, but wasn't aware of their operational target (Massoud). On 7 August 2006, Tebourski was deported to Tunisia on assurances of humane treatment from the Tunisian government but with protest of Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch citing fears of torture by Tunisian police. Upon arrival in the capital Tunis, Tebourski was briefly questioned by border police and promptly released.\n\n\n=== Republic of Afghanistan ===\nIn April 2003, Afghan President Hamid Karzai established a special commission, to be headed by then-Afghan interior minister Ali Ahmad Jalali, to investigate Massoud's assassination. It is not apparent the results of the commission or if it ever convened.\n\n\n=== United States ===\nA November 2001 Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) report partially declassified through a Freedom of Information Act request on Massoud's assassination analyzed the connection between the assassination of Ahmad Shah Massoud and the September 11th attacks days later. The report suggests Massoud's intelligence apparatus had collected information about an attack planned by Osama bin Laden, larger than the 1998 East Africa embassy bombings, but key details remain classified.\n\nThrough Northern Alliance intelligence efforts, the late commander Massoud gained limited knowledge regarding the intentions of the Saudi millionaire, Usama bin Laden (UBL), and his terrorist organizatiion al-Qaida, to perform a terrorist act against the U.S. on a scale larger than the 1998 bombing of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania [REDACTED]. In April 2001, Massoud addressed the French and European Parliaments in Paris. In his televised speech he warned the U.S. government about UBL [REDACTED].\nAlthough Commander Massoud was fighting the Taliban forces over the control of Afghanistan, he was not a threat to UBL and the al-Qaida organization. To Massoud, UBL was a Saudi citizen, exiled to Afghanistan due to his challenge to the legitimacy of he Saudi monarchy. After the terrorist strikes on the U.S. embassies in Africa, and receiving intelligence for his forces regarding UBL's future attacks, Massoud began to warn the west of UBL and al-Qaida [REDACTED].\n\n\n== Allegations of Pakistani involvement ==\n\nThough the validity remains publicly unknown, Pakistan's chief intelligence and covert action agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), faces allegations of involvement in or prior knowledge of the assassination of Ahmad Shah Massoud. Most of these sources cite a combination of factors to include ISI's post-1994 comprehensive support and loyalty to the Taliban against the Northern Alliance, ISI's well-documented history of clandestine support to South Asian Islamist jihadist groups (including al-Qaeda), Massoud's position as a vocal critic of Pakistani support to the Taliban and interference in Afghan affairs, Massoud's friendly relationship with rival India's intelligence services, and Pakistan's quiet request to have the British investigation of the assassination squashed in its infancy.\nMassoud's close friend and advisor Masoud Khalili who wrote:\n\nWhen I was in my hospital bed in Germany [following the explosion]... I thought very carefully about who would be behind this attacks because I did not want to blame someone else. I realize what I say is conjecture based on circumstantial evidence: I believe Osama bin Laden and the Pakistani ISI were behind the murder. This originated from Massoud's trip to France in May 2001... Osama bin Laden wanted to create a religious depth within Afghanistan as well as Central Asia and could not do this without removing Massoud. The ISI wanted strategic depth in Central Asia and again Massoud stood in their way... The murder of Commander Massoud would be a gift to Mullah Omar, the Taliban leader, and the Pakistani ISI.\nMassoud's friend and biographer, Sandy Gall, is assured of ISI's involvement, writing \"They were provided with one-year multiple-entry visas — virtually unheard of for visiting journalists. A few days later, they flew to Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan. All this would seem to confirm that the whole operation had been carefully planned and that Pakistan's ISI was deeply involved.\" In an interview, Gall asked an unnamed former Afghan intelligence chief if the heads of ISI were privy to the plot. The intelligence chief stated \"I am 100 percent sure. Without the ISI, it couldn't have happened. And this is my question: if they weren't involved, why did they stop Scotland Yard's investigation?\"\nBeyond Masoud Khalili and Sandy Gall, other prominent proponents for this theory include Ahmad Wali Massoud (brother of Ahmad Shah and then-Afghan ambassador to London), Northern Alliance and National Resistance Front leader Mohammad Fahim Dashty, and Afghanistan's first vice president and later longest-serving spy chief, Amrullah Saleh.\n\n\n=== Pakistani response ===\nIn 2001, Pakistan's deputy high commissioner in London, Attiya Mahmood, stated that an investigation of their records showed the Pakistani visas used by the two operatives \"must have been forged\" and denied that they had been issued by Pakistani consulates in Britain.\n\n\n== Commemoration ==\n\n\n=== Burial and tomb ===\nWith news of Massoud's death widely-known, Massoud's body was flown by helicopter (presumably from Tajikistan) to the Panjshir Valley where he was buried in his home village of Bazarak on 16 September 2001, exactly one week after his death.\n\n\n==== Reports of Taliban desecration ====\nShortly after the Taliban's recapture of Afghanistan following the complete withdrawal of NATO forces, videos emerged of the glass structure over Massoud's tomb shattered, days after the Taliban entered the Panjshir Valley. The Taliban also posted videos rummaging through Massoud's mausoleum. On 15 September 2021, Pakistani news channel Geo TV sent a reporter to Massoud's tomb who denied claims that damage had been done to the tomb. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid denied reports of the tomb's desecration.\n\n\n=== Massoud Day ===\n\nPrior to the 2021 Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, September 9 was celebrated as an Afghan national holiday under the names \"Massoud Day\" or \"Martyr's Day\" (Dari: روز شهدا). The week in which it takes place was at times referred to as \"Martyr's Week\".\nTypical annual celebrations of Massoud Day included parades through downtown Kabul, wreath laying ceremonies at Massoud's tomb attended by senior government officials, popular gatherings at Kabul's Massoud Square, and parties hosted in Massoud's native Panjshir Valley.\nIn 2002, on the first anniversary of Massoud's assassination, Afghan President Hamid Karzai traveled to Massoud's tomb in Panjshir to pay his respects, stating \"We are here to day because of what [Massoud] did before he lost his life for Afghanistan.\" In 2011, on the tenth anniversary, Afghanistan's first vice president, Mohammad Qasim Fahim, called Massoud \"Afghanistan's national hero and a defender of his country\" at an event hosted in a Kabul school. In 2015, on the fourteenth anniversary, Massoud's brothers Ahmad Wali and Ahmad Zia attended a wreath-laying ceremony in Kabul's Massoud Square. Ahmad Wali used the events to call for blood donations in support of Afghan security forces.\nOn the 20th anniversary of Massoud's assassination (in 2021), Sandy Gall, a Scottish journalist and close friend of Massoud, published the principle biography of Massoud Afghan Napoleon, which includes a detailed account of the assassination.\nOn the 22nd anniversary, members of the Austrian Parliament held a conference, led by the Ahmad Shah Massoud Foundation to commemorate Massoud and discuss the post-2021 Taliban-run Afghanistan.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nNational Resistance Front (NRF)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nGall, Sandy (7 September 2021).

She has been profiled by UN Women and chosen as one of the BBC's 100 inspirational women in 2022.\n\n\n== Life ==\nSagyn was born in Talas in 1989. She went to take food technology at the Kyrgyz-Turkish Manas University and learnt Turkish, but she realised at the end of the first year that she wanted to study software engineering. She was trained in Moscow at the British Higher School of Design.\nIn autumn 2022 she was included in the 100 women that the BBC consider most influential that year. The BBC broadcast in several languages and they ask their different language services to choose someone who has been influential that year. Sagyn had been chosen earlier in 2022 by UN Women. They had profiled her and four other women for the lead they were showing in mitigating the effect of climate change. She had founded a company called Tazar which means going greener. The product was a mobile application which unites people with waste products with the people who can recycle them. She has a business partner named Aimeerim Tursalieva. Another app is called Tazar Bazaar which allows women users to sell their products.\nIn April 2024 she was one of the members of a team called Kadam that arranged for the creation of four pieces of streetart made out of bottle tops. The subject of the art are all unknown heroes. One is a street vendor, another a  press secretary, another a film projectionist and the last is the transformative architect Ulan Zhaparov. Sagyn worked with the journalist Rakhat Asangulova and the artist Dimitri Petrovsky.\n\n\n== References ==",

He left England with his family for the United States, arriving in New York City at the age of 14. He was a boy soloist at Trinity Church in Manhattan as a teenager.\nAfter working as church choir director and organist at several different churches, Robjohn took up a career on the stage as an actor in 1862; touring the northern part of the United States for a six-year period. In 1868 he returned to New York City where he was active as music critic, music teacher, pianist, and conductor. In 1870 he adopted the name Caryl Florio in response to his family's objections to his career choice. His the music textbook A Textbook of Practical Harmony was published by the London music publishers Morgan & Scott in 1892.\nIn 1896 Florio left New York City for Asheville, North Carolina to take a position as organist at the newly built Cathedral of All Souls; a church established by George Washington Vanderbilt II. He remained in that position through 1901, and was afterwords active as a music teacher and choir conductor in Asheville.

        "content": "Iran de Santana Alves (born November 7, 2001), better known as Luva de Pedreiro and sometimes called Iran Ferreira, is a Brazilian internet personality, YouTuber and footballer who in 2022 broke records in virtual content focused on football in the Americas and became the Brazilian influencer of the sport with the most followers on Instagram, being the only Brazilian to be followed by the official social network account.\nInitially stereotyped as a meme, he achieved success in Brazil and abroad by publishing amateur football videos on his social networks, where he demonstrates his skills in the sport by making references to famous teams and players, celebrating his goals using catchphrases such as \"Receba!\" (Receive!) and \"Obrigado, meu Deus\" (Thank you, God\") which quickly began to be reproduced by several internet users and world celebrities from football and other sports.\nHis nickname came from playing football using construction professionals' gloves, referencing the cold-weather gloves used by European players.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nIran de Santana Alves was born in the village of Tábua, in Quijingue, a city with less than 30 thousand inhabitants in the interior of Bahia. Of humble origins, he used to play as a child with cloth balls made by his mother or with coconuts he found in the backyard, where he started playing association football and fell in love with the sport, becoming a Vasco da Gama fan thanks to his family's encouragement. Despite his desire to become a professional player, he ended up putting his dream aside to help his father work on the farm as a boy. Due to everyday situations, he could attend school until the eighth year of elementary school.\n\n\n== Influencer career ==\n\n\n=== 2021: The Beginning ===\nIn 2021, at the age of 20, he started recording his own videos, as he wanted to watch himself on his cell phone. Later, with the help of friends and neighbors, he started recording videos more frequently. That same year, his videos became successful on the internet, but it was at the beginning of the following year that they began to be recognized nationally and internationally, with this Iran began to reconcile his work routine in the field with the production of virtual content with the aim of ensure a source of income for your family.\n\n\n=== 2022-present: Fame, son and football-based content ===\nIn 2022, during a participation in the TV program, Encontro com Fátima Bernardes, Iran revealed his intention to become a football coach in the following years. In September 2023, Iran announced that he would be a father, drawing attention to the name of his future son, which, according to the influencer, would be called \"Cristiano Ronaldo Jr.\" Later, in an interview with the Podpah podcast, he explained that the child's full name would be \"Cristiano Ronaldo da Gama Laurino Santana\", mixing the names of the player of the same name and the Vasco da Gama sports team. On March 7, 2024, his firstborn, Davi Cristiano Ronaldo Gomes de Santana Alves, was born. The first child is the result of his relationship with biologist Távila Gomes.\n\n\n== Football career ==\nIn 2023, Iran was signed by Grêmio's \"futebol 7\" team. Upon joining \"Tricolor Gaucho\" (Grêmio), he soon provoked rivalry and arguments between Grêmio and Internacional. In a video published on Instagram, when asked if he was being sought by \"Colorado\" (Internacional), Iran replied that he “only plays for a big team”.\n\n\n== See also ==\nIShowSpeed\nFootball in Brazil\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nLuva de Pedreiro's channel on YouTube",

        "content": "Óscar Álvarez González (1 May 1902 – 11 June 1972) was a Spanish footballer who played as a goalkeeper for Real Oviedo. He later worked as a manager. He was also a member of the Spanish football squad that competed in the 1924 Summer Olympics, but he did not play in any matches.\n\n\n== Club career ==\nBorn in Oviedo, Óscar started his football career in his hometown club Stadium Ovetense, where he began playing as a goalkeeper by chance, replacing a teammate who had been injured during a match, and he soon demonstrates great qualities that made him stand out between the posts. In 1926, he was one of the main promoters of the merger between Stadium and the neighboring club Deportivo Oviedo, which resulted in the birth of Real Oviedo.\nÓscar was named the club's first-ever captain and he defended the Real Oviedo shirt from the first day of its existence until the Spanish Civil War interrupted football competitions in 1936. During this period, he recovered in 1930 from a broken collarbone that threatened the end of his football career. In total, he played 198 official matches; 103 in the League, 3 in promotion matches, 30 in the Copa del Rey, and 62 in the Regional Championship.\nAt the end of the war he was imprisoned and later released for having clearly positioned himself in favor of the republic.\n\n\n== International career ==\nBeing a Real Oviedo player, Óscar was eligible to play for the Asturias team, being one of the eleven footballers that played in the team's first-ever game on 4 June 1922, in a friendly against St Mirren F.C., which ended in a 3–7 loss. The regional Asturian team then played seven official games between 1922 and 1926 in the Prince of Asturias Cup, winning the 1922–23 edition, largely thanks to Óscar's heroic performances in the semifinals, keeping a clean-sheet in a 1–1 win over Catalonia, which was mostly made-up of players of the so-called golden generation of FC Barcelona, such as Ricardo Zamora, Vicente Martínez, and Josep Samitier. In the final on 25 February 1923, he started in a 3–1 victory over Galicia at Coia.\nÓscar was a member of the Spanish football squad that competed in the 1924 Summer Olympics, but he did not play in any matches. In total, he was called up for the national team 11 times, 9 being a Stadium player and 2 as an Oviedo player, but he was unable to make his debut because of the great competition that there was for the goalkeeping position, where mainly Ricardo Zamora blocked his way.\n\n\n== Managerial career ==\nÓscar began his managerial career at the helm of Racing de Ferrol, which he coached in 1940–41. In July 1941, he took charge of Real Oviedo, replacing Cristóbal Martí to become the club's 10th coach, a position that he held for only a year until 1942, when he was replaced by Manuel Meana. After another one-season stint at Real Avilés CF (1943–44), he gave up from coaching, but eventually returned following a 7-year hiatus to take charge of another Asturian team in the Segunda Division, Caudal Deportivo, and this time he lasted two seasons. He then returned to Real Avilés in 1954, and then to Real Oviedo in July 1955, but left in October after only three months at the helm of the club. His last season as coach was in 1957–58 with CP La Felguera.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nAsturias XI\nPrince of Asturias Cup:\nChampions (1): 1922–23\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Philotanus is a poem written around 1719 by Jean-Baptiste Willart de Grécourt and first published in 1720 in Paris, France. It was written in response to the passage of the Papal bull Unigenitus in 1713, which banned Jansenist teachings. Its Latin translation is attributed to Abbé Denis Bizot.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe poem begins with the narrator finding a sleeping demon on the side of the road while on a walk. It wakes after being bound with a cordon blessed in the name of Francis of Assisi, and after being threatened with holy water by the narrator, agrees to answer their questions regarding the passage of Unigenitus.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIn 1722, the Archbishop of Bougres excommunicated those who read the poem,  and in July of the same year, those who made the woodcuts and distributed copies were fined and exiled for three years after a trial held in Paris.\nThe author Nicolas Jouin wrote a sequel in 1733 titled Le Porte-Feuille du Diable, ou le Suite de Philotanus which elaborates on the conspiracy and names Beelzebub and Astarot as having also been involved in the passage of Unigentus. These two poems would often be published together in multiple books from then on.\n\n\n== References ==",

It reveals that Fonda, under the radar for 40 years, is a special bassist. And it continues the recording comeback of a major drummer.\"\nKarl Ackermann of All About Jazz wrote: \"Free improvisation is often license for an abrasiveness that can obscure the substantial intelligence and effort involved in a project but Altschul, Irabagon and Fonda shine in this environment. Their objectives on Tales of the Unforeseen are clear and carried out with considerable refinement amidst all the intricacy.\" AAJ's John Sharpe commented: \"the threesome proves exceptionally well-attuned... Altschul confirms himself a master of free-bop... Fonda is likewise surefooted, purposeful and, crucially, able to conjure structure out of thin air... in Irabagon you have one of the most fluent improvisers on the scene today.\"\nWriting for Point of Departure, Troy Collins noted \"the threesome's virtually telepathic interplay,\" and remarked: \"Altschul has long been an advocate of the all-inclusive 'From Ragtime To No Time' concept; nowhere else in Altschul's oeuvre has this idea been as fully realized as by the 3dom Factor.\"\nThe Chicago Reader's Peter Margasak called the album \"terrific,\" and stated that it \"displays the trio's range, opening with a lengthy group improvisation of breathless reach and moving inside with a smoldering rendition of Monk's 'Ask Me Now.'\"\nBret Saunders of The Denver Post included the album in his ten best jazz releases of 2015, writing: \"an endlessly energetic drummer propels his trio to beautiful old and new places.\"\nWriter Raul Da Gama stated: \"A perfectly appropriate term to describe this well-functioning unit would be 'a power trio' for the visceral and exciting energy that this band generates... The playing here is... polished, characterful and extremely rewarding.\"\nIn an article for Something Else!, S. Victor Aaron remarked: \"As the musicians in Barry Altschul's 3Dom Factor get better acclimated with each other, the telepathy and audacity gets better, too. The suite-like approach taken for Tales of the Unforeseen strings together the divergent parts into a connected whole. That old school guy Barry Altschul remains on the edge of jazz as much as he ever was.\"\nDaniel Spicer of Jazzwise noted that the album is \"less an exercise in pure sonic experimentation and more one of knitting together various different well-established modes and moods,\" and observed: \"it's clear just how much fun everyone's having.\"\nTales of the Unforeseen was listed as one of the year's top jazz releases in the 2015 NPR Music Jazz Critics Poll.\nThe editors of The Free Jazz Collective awarded the album a full 5 stars, and reviewer Stefan Wood described the album as \"vibrant improvised music, hard edged yet very uptempo,\" commenting: \"There is a sense of empathy and tightness of the trio that recalls the seemingly telepathic communications of Jimmy Giuffre's heralded trio from the early 60's. In some ways, it feels like the 3Dom Factor is a contemporary version of that group.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"As the Tale Begins\" (Barry Altschul, Jon Irabagon and Joe Fonda) – 26:35\n\"A Tale of Monk: Ask Me Now\" (Thelonious Monk) – 5:53\n\"The Tale Continues\" (Barry Altschul, Jon Irabagon and Joe Fonda) – 4:17\n\"Annette's Tale of Miracles\" (Annette Peacock) – 5:36\n\"A Drummer's Tale\" (Barry Altschul) – 4:49\n\"And the Tale Ends\" (Barry Altschul, Jon Irabagon and Joe Fonda) – 10:39\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nBarry Altschul – drums, percussion\nJon Irabagon – tenor saxophone, soprano saxophone, sopranino saxophone, flute\nJoe Fonda – double bass\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Law on the Interruption of Pregnancy was a law passed by the Volkskammer, the parliament of the German Democratic Republic (GDR), on March 9, 1972, to regulate abortion. With its adoption, a fundamental revision of the law on abortion was introduced in the GDR in the form of a time limit solution, in contrast to the previously applicable indication-based regulation. This gave women the right to decide on their own responsibility whether to terminate a pregnancy within twelve weeks of its onset. According to the law, the doctor involved was obliged to advise the pregnant woman on the medical significance of the procedure and the future use of contraceptive methods and substances.\nThe law met with criticism and rejection from the churches of both confessions and parts of the medical community in the GDR, but there was no public debate. Until the political change in 1989, however, the resolution on the law was the only vote in the history of the Volkskammer that was not unanimous, as there were 14 votes against and eight abstentions. The legal situation created by the law in the GDR, which was the first time in German legal history that a time limit for abortion came into force, subsequently influenced the debate on the amendment of Section 218 of the German Criminal Code and the resulting legislative initiatives in the Federal Republic of Germany, as well as the revision of Section 218 of the German Criminal Code following German reunification.\n\n\n== Origin and content ==\n\n\n=== Legal development ===\nUntil 1943, the legal basis for abortion in Germany was the Reich Criminal Code passed in 1871 with Sections 218–220, the punishment for which had been softened in a new version passed in 1926. In a ruling on March 11, 1927, the Reich Court also added a strict medical indication as an exception formulated by the judiciary to the provisions of the Criminal Code, which represented a general ban on abortion without defined indications. According to this ruling, the existence of a \"present danger to the pregnant woman that could not be eliminated in any other way\" was considered a justification in the form of a supra-legal state of emergency. In the Third Reich, the view on the normative basis of the ban on abortion changed fundamentally, as the killing of the expectant or unborn life was no longer the primary justification. Instead, deprivation of the father and the state and, from 1943, \"impairment of the vitality of the German people\" were now regarded as the basis for criminal liability.\nFurthermore, with the exception of medical indications, the strict ban only applied to pregnancies that were desirable in terms of racial hygiene. In the case of parents who were considered \"hereditarily ill and inferior\" according to National Socialist ideology, however, eugenic indications were also permitted and even advocated. From 1943, abortion was punishable by death if \"the vitality of the German people continued to be impaired\". For other cases of abortion, the prison sentence of up to 15 years was restored. However, it could only be imposed on the pregnant woman in particularly serious cases, which were not defined in the law; imprisonment remained possible against third parties in less serious cases.\nAfter the end of the Second World War, the legal situation in the individual states of the Soviet occupation zone was replaced between 1945 and 1948 by new regulations with extended indication models. Due to the consequences of the war, these included a specific criminological indication for pregnancy after rape or sexual abuse, for example in Thuringia by the \"Law on the interruption of pregnancy caused by a moral crime\" of August 29, 1945, and, with the exception of the law of Saxony-Anhalt, also a social indication in the case of existing or impending social hardship, for example in Thuringia through the \"Law on the interruption of pregnancy\" of December 18, 1947. In Mecklenburg, the embryopathic indication was also introduced in 1947. In addition, the punishment was considerably reduced compared to the previous legal regulations.\nAround a year after the GDR was founded, the Law on Mother and Child Protection and Women's Rights came into force on September 27, 1950, which introduced a uniform regulation of the indications for abortion in Section 11, which was more restrictive than the previous regulations. According to Section 11, an abortion was only permitted on medical or embryopathic grounds \"if carrying the child to term would seriously endanger the life or health of the pregnant woman or if one of the parents was afflicted with a serious hereditary disease\" and permission had been granted by a commission made up of doctors, representatives of health care bodies and the Democratic Women's Association. In addition to promoting equal rights for women and increasing their employment, the aim of the Law on Mother and Child Protection and Women's Rights was in particular to promote births as part of population policy. In the following years, the legal situation in the GDR from 1950 onwards led to one of the lowest rates of approved abortions in the world on the one hand, and on the other to an increase in the number of illegal abortions and to women turning to doctors in West Berlin for abortions until the construction of the Berlin Wall.\nIn March 1965, an internal circular of the Ministry of Health, without changing the text of the law, extended the application of Section 11 to include a criminal and a social indication. The other cases of abortion remained prohibited and punishable, and the criminal provisions of the state laws initially continued to apply and were replaced in 1968 by Sections 153-155 of the GDR Criminal Code.\n\nWith the 1972 law on the interruption of pregnancy, the indication-based legal situation was then completely replaced by a time limit regulation. Even after the law was passed and promulgated in the GDR Law Gazette on March 15, 1972, Sections 153-155 of the GDR Criminal Code remained in full force and unchanged, as an interruption of pregnancy was considered illegal under criminal law if it was performed \"contrary to the statutory provisions\". In contrast to Section 218 of the German Criminal Code, the specific definition of the requirements for permissibility was therefore not part of the provisions of the StGB-GDR, but was instead set out in the corresponding laws of 1950 and 1972. The main reasons for the new regulation in 1972, as with the extension of the indications in 1965, were the high number of unreported illegal abortions, the increasing demands for women's self-determination as well as the rejuvenation and increase in the proportion of women among doctors in the GDR. In addition, a \"race\" with the reform efforts of the social-liberal coalition in the Federal Republic of Germany may have played a role in the timing. Both in the context of legal history and in an international comparison[15], the recognition of the decision to terminate a pregnancy as a woman's right was particularly new; a comparable formulation can only be found in the regulation adopted in Denmark one year later.\nWith the Unification Treaty of August 31, 1990, § 1 para. 1, § 4 para. 2 and § 5 of the Act on the Termination of Pregnancy were repealed.\nThe Act ceased to apply in full in 1993 following the decision of the Federal Constitutional Court to reorganize the legal situation on abortion throughout Germany.\nAccording to the preamble of the law on the interruption of pregnancy, which consisted of five paragraphs, the possibility of deciding on pregnancy and carrying it to term was regarded as a requirement of the \"equal rights of women in education and work, marriage and family\" and thus as a contribution to achieving this goal within the framework of the women's and family policy of the GDR. According to Section 1 (1), women were therefore given \"in addition to the existing contraceptive options, the right to decide on the interruption of a pregnancy on their own responsibility\" in order to determine the number, the time and the chronological order of births.\nAccording to Section 1 (2), a pregnant woman was entitled to have the pregnancy terminated within twelve weeks of its onset \"by means of a medical intervention in an obstetric-gynecological facility\". According to Section 1 (3), the doctor involved was obliged to \"inform the woman of the medical significance of the procedure and advise her on the future use of contraceptive methods and means\".\nAccording to Section 2, the termination of a pregnancy of more than twelve weeks was subject to the decision of a commission of medical specialists and was only permitted if the woman's life was at risk or if there were other serious circumstances.\nAccording to Section 3 (1), abortion was not permitted if the woman was suffering from an illness that could lead to serious health-threatening or life-threatening complications.\nAccording to Section 3(2), abortion was inadmissible if the last abortion had taken place less than six months previously, unless the Medical Specialists Commission granted an exemption.\nAccording to Section 4 (1), the preparation, execution and follow-up treatment of a permissible abortion were \"treated in the same way as a case of illness in terms of employment and insurance law\".\nIn addition, Section 4(2) of the Act provided for the free provision of medically prescribed contraceptives to women on social security.\nThe provisions on the entry into force of the Act and its effect on other laws, in particular the repeal of the previous restrictions on the permissibility of abortion, were contained in Section 5.\n\n\n== Reactions ==\n\n\n=== Reactions in the GDR ===\nThe joint decision of the GDR Council of Ministers and the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party on the planned law, announced on December 23, 1971, came unexpectedly, and there was hardly any public discussion beforehand or afterwards. Representatives of both confessions of the churches in the GDR expressed their rejection of the law even before it was passed. In a pastoral letter read from all pulpits on January 9, 1972, the Catholic Church emphasized that it was the task of every state to provide special protection for developing life. The eight Protestant bishops in the GDR expressed their \"deepest dismay\" and their rejection of the proposed law in a \"Word of the Bishops of the Protestant Regional Churches in the GDR\" published a few days later, which was addressed in particular to the individual members of the churches and \"to all who want to hear it\". Protest also came from free church groups such as the Seventh-day Adventists, whose community published a corresponding statement and distributed it in their congregations.\nThere was also criticism from doctors and members of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), but this did not spread to the general public. Helmut Kraatz, one of the most important gynecologists in the GDR, expressed a positive opinion of the new regulation, as it \"removed the ground from the hands of medical practitioners\", but also described abortion as the \"most unpleasant method of family planning for women and gynecologists\".\n\nThe draft law on the interruption of pregnancy was the result of joint deliberations by the Constitutional and Legal Committee, the Committee for Health Care and the Committee for Labor and Social Policy of the People's Chamber. During the vote in the People's Chamber on March 9, 1972, which took place by a show of hands,[24] after speeches by the President of the People's Chamber, Gerald Götting, the Minister for Health Care, Ludwig Mecklinger, and Hildegard Heine from the Committee for Health Care, the bill was passed. March 1972, following speeches by the President of the Volkskammer, Gerald Götting, the Minister of Health, Ludwig Mecklinger, and Hildegard Heine, a member of the Health Committee, the result was not unanimous for the first and only time before the political change in 1989; 14 members of the Christian Democratic Union of Germany - around a quarter of the parliamentary group - voted against the law and eight members abstained. The proportion of votes against was less than three percent of the total number of representatives in the Volkskammer, which was elected through a single list of the National Front with a fixed distribution of seats. The inconsistent opinions within the CDU on the proposed law and the planned divergent voting behavior of the deputies concerned were known to the party leadership around its chairman Gerald Götting in advance and were communicated to the SED leadership via Albert Norden, a member of the Politburo of the SED Central Committee, around a month before the resolution was passed. Accordingly, Health Minister Ludwig Mecklinger, a member of the SED, also addressed the concerns of church circles in his comments on the law.\nPreviously, there had been isolated opposing votes in local parliaments in the GDR, such as the demolition of the ruins of the Potsdam Garrison Church and the demolition of the Leipzig University Church in 1968. The CDU did not make an official statement on the law or the behavior of its representatives; the non-unanimous result was welcomed by church officials of both denominations. In the reporting of Neues Deutschland, the most important daily newspaper in the GDR as the nationwide central organ of the SED, the outcome of the vote was described as an \"absolute majority\" and it was emphasized that \"the rights and dignity of women were fully guaranteed\". The SED used the result for propaganda purposes to upgrade the Volkskammerr and as proof of the freedom that the members of parliament would have when casting their votes, especially for all other unanimous decisions. The state authorities subsequently tolerated the refusal to perform abortions in the GDR's existing hospitals run by Catholics or Protestants. However, the Catholic hospital in Heiligenstadt in the Catholic-dominated Eichsfeld region had to hand over its gynecology department to a state clinic, as there would otherwise have been no possibility of abortion in the town. An organized right-to-life movement did not exist in the GDR; corresponding protest activities remained marginal and limited to individuals, especially Christians in social and medical professions.\n\n\n=== Reception in the Federal Republic of Germany ===\n\nThe law on the interruption of pregnancy and, in particular, the result of the vote in the Volkskammer also met with great interest in the West German media. For example, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) reported on the day after the vote under the headline \"Dead silence in the Volkskammer. No votes in the plenary chamber for the first time\". The comments on the significance of the vote varied. While the Süddeutsche Zeitung described it as a \"remarkable event\" that might have to lead to a distortion of the prevailing image of the Volkskammer in the Federal Republic as an \"approval machine of the SED\", the FAZ suspected that the voting behavior of the dissenting CDU representatives had been carried out in agreement with the SED. [33] The Evangelical Press Service regarded the admission of the no votes as a sign that the GDR would approve abortion but not propagate it.\nThe new version of the legislation on abortion in the GDR also put pressure on the social-liberal coalition under Chancellor Willy Brandt and Justice Minister Gerhard Jahn in the Federal Republic of Germany in their efforts to reform Section 218 StGB. This led to the adoption in June 1974 of a solution comparable to the new legal situation in the GDR, replacing the originally planned limited indication regulation. However, following a constitutional complaint by members of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group and five state governments, the new regulation was declared unconstitutional by the Federal Constitutional Court in February of the following year and replaced in June 1976 by a model with four different indications, in which the social indication was newly included in addition to the previously permitted exceptions. After German reunification, the Act on Education, Contraception, Family Planning and Counselling of July 27, 1992 introduced a time limit regulation with mandatory counselling and indications as a new nationwide regulation of the legal provisions on abortion, which represented a compromise between the time limit solution of the GDR and the indication model in the Federal Republic. Following an objection by the Federal Constitutional Court, this amendment came into force in 1993 in a modified form and was finally amended by the legislature in 1995.\n\n\n== Consequences ==\nThe number of authorized abortions in the GDR, which had been 860 in 1962 and thus three years before the 1950 extension of the indication regulation, initially rose significantly to around 119,000 in 1972 immediately after the introduction of the deadline solution, but had already fallen again to around 83,000 by 1976. In contrast, before the new regulation, 70 to 80 women per year died as a result of improperly performed abortions. Immediately after the law was passed, hospitals in the GDR were often overwhelmed due to insufficient equipment; in the Women's Clinic of the Charité in Berlin, for example, the procedure was initially performed in several shifts. In later years, almost all hospitals in the GDR had special departments for performing abortions. The increase in abortions caused by the new regulations and the free distribution of contraceptives introduced at the same time led to a persistent population decline in the GDR until the end of the 1970s due to the resulting loss of births and had a corresponding effect on the age structure in the following years.\nAs a result of this development, a series of birth-promoting social policy measures were adopted by the state from the early 1970s, partly at the same time as the law on interrupting pregnancy, which included in particular regulations to improve the situation of families with children and working mothers. These included, for example, subsidized rents for low-income families, reduced weekly working hours with full pay and a higher leave entitlement for women with at least three children, the extension of paid leave after a birth from two to three months and, for young married couples, the introduction of an interest-free loan of 5,000 marks with a long term, the repayment of which was reduced when children were born. From the beginning of the 1980s, the number of births again exceeded the number of deaths; around 74,000 abortions were carried out in 1990. Due to a higher birth rate compared to the Federal Republic, the number of abortions in relation to pregnancies carried to term was comparable in both countries at the end of the 1980s, with around three births per abortion.\n\nAfter the political change in the GDR, the \"right to self-determined pregnancy\" was included in the Round Table's draft for a new GDR constitution. For the newly formed Independent Women's Association, which ran in the Volkskammer elections in March 1990 in an electoral alliance with the East German Green Party, the retention of the current regulation on the time limit was a decisive issue. On the one hand, the CDU campaigned on the basis of the rejectionist stance of its 14 MPs in the 1972 vote, but also stated in its election manifesto that \"abortion bans and threats of punishment ... are not an aid to life\". With the exception of the newly founded German Social Union (DSU), politicians from all parties represented in the newly elected Volkskammer, including the CDU, supported the retention of the abortion ban, which was also included as a demand in the coalition agreement of the newly formed government consisting of the CDU-led electoral coalition Alliance for Germany, the SPD and the liberal Association of Free Democrats. Kurt Wünsche from the Liberal Democratic Party of Germany (LDPD), who served as GDR Minister of Justice from January to August 1990 under Prime Ministers Hans Modrow and Lothar de Maizière, suggested that the right to abortion should be included in a new all-German constitution[44] or that different legal situations should continue to exist.\nIn February 2008, Wolfgang Böhmer, then Prime Minister of Saxony-Anhalt and, during the GDR era, head of gynecology at a Protestant hospital in Wittenberg, triggered a controversial public debate on the late effects of the 1972 law by linking the legal situation on abortions in the GDR with a \"frivolous attitude towards developing life\" and infanticide in the new federal states in the news magazine Focus. His statements on the connection between abortions in the GDR and the frequency of infanticide in East Germany, which he qualified a few days later in an interview in the newspaper Die Welt, were largely rejected by politicians of all parties. However, there were also different comments from psychiatrists and political scientists as well as approval from some affected women, church representatives and pro-life initiatives such as the CDU organization Christian Democrats for Life with regard to his statements on the GDR legislation on abortion.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nThietz, Kirsten (1992).

It was released through Keeled Scales on April 12, 2024.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nThe album has received generally favorable reviews.\n\"Under The Radar Magazine's\" Caleb Campbell said, \"Comeback Kid as a whole finds Kearney occupying a spacey and liminal style of indie pop, joined by layers of vintage synths and atmospheric production. The opening moments of the title track strip these layers back even further, accompanying Kearney’s vocals with only a distant thrum of piano. As the song unfurls, Kearney is joined by an immersive rhythm section and dreamy backing vocals, elevating the track into a wistful and hazy reverie. Yet, she also anchors these evocative aesthetic touches with organic instrumentation and yearning melodies, bringing them a sense of grounded intimacy.\"\nMatt Collar of \"All Music\" wrote: \"It's an eclectic vibe she's ... championed on her solo work, including 2017's \"Won't Let You Down\" and 2023's \"Snakes of Paradise\" albums that found her embracing a mix of melodic rock and sophisticated indie pop. With 2024's Comeback Kid, she further hones this end of her pop career, crafting memorable songs that are as likable and infectious as anything she's done with...\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nAlbum and track listing information taken directly from album cover, liner notes, and, digital distribution medium.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nThese people contributed to the album:\n\nBridget Kearney: vocals, bass, keyboards, guitars\nDan Molad: drums, percussion, keyboards, guitars\nZach Tenorio: additional keyboards on \"Roman Sunset\" and \"I Feel So Bad For You\"\nRobin MacMillan: percussion on \"Don't Think About The Polar Bear\"\nRob Shelton: keyboards on \"Security Camera,\" \"Don't Think About The Polar Bear\" and \"Obsessed\"\nAdam Brisbin: guitar on \"Obsessed\"\nPeter Lalish: slide guitar on \"I Feel So Bad For You\"\nJon Joseph: piano on \"Not A Game To Me”\nJeremy Udden: saxophone on \"Don't Think About The Polar Bear\"\nDan Molad: keyboards on \"Obsessed Interlude\"\nRob Shelton: keyboards, vibes on \"Obsessed Interlude\"\nTechnical\n\nProduced by Dan Molad\nMixed by Dan Molad\nMastered by Emily Lazar at The Lodge Mastering\nEngineered by Rob Shelton at Altamira Sound, Alhambra, CA (2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 9) and by Jon Joseph at Squid Rag Dry Fly in San Pedro, CA (1, 5, 7, 10 and 11)\nNote: tracks 8–12 on the digital edition are 7–11 on the album\nDesign\n\nPhotography by Jeremy Herron with direction by Phineas Alexander\nAlbum Art by Anna Watson\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Alexandru Sorin Biris is an associate professor in the Department of Applied Science at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock and the Director/Chief Scientist at the Center for Integrative Nanotechnology Sciences. He claimed himself a researcher who specializes in nanoscience and nanotechnology. His major research topics include developing electrodynamic screens for space exploration in collaboration with NASA, inventing techniques to mass-produce high-purity carbon nanotubes, and designing and developing filters based on carbon nanostructures which can efficiently remove biochemical contaminants from air and water, and also include advances in how cancer cells can be targeted and destroyed through drug delivery.\nBiris was one of seven winners of the 2011 faculty excellence award for research at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, where he leads the Center for Integrative Nanotechnology Sciences. It was officially claimed that within 5 years Biris has been published in more than 240 journals, presented at numerous international conferences, and been granted more than 33 U.S. patents. He is on the editorial board of \"Particulate Science and Technology: An International Journal\", \"Journal of Nanomedicine & Nanotechnology\"  and is an advisory board member for ISOS Group LLC, an international company that focuses on green energy technologies.\nHe has also been accused of scientific misconduct, including plagiarism and massive data fabrication. As of 2013, a total of 4 of Biris' research papers have been retracted. An independent organization investigated scientific misconduct in his research. Biris did not respond to several phone calls or email messages, and a spokesperson for the university for UALR did not return calls for comment. \n\n\n== Personal life and education ==\nAlexandru S. Biris was born into a middle-class family (Lidia and Alexandru – Radu Biris) in Cluj, Romania on May 14, 1974. He is the eldest of two children, and has a younger sister, Gabriela. \nHe received his B.S. in physics in 1996 and M.S. Material Science in 1997 from the University of Cluj – Napoca, Romania. In 2004, he obtained his Ph.D. in Engineering Science from the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, where he studied under Professor Malay K. Mazumder. His Dissertation title is “Appearance and Texture Control of Powder Coated Films”. After receiving his PhD, he was hired as a research assistant in the Department of Chemistry at ULAR, where he studied nanotechnology.\nBiris' father, Alexandru Radu Biris, is a professor and researcher at the National Institute for Research and Development of Isotopic and Molecular Technologies in Romania.  His father helped him with lots of publications.   His mother, Lidia, is a physics teacher. His younger sister, Gabriela, works for Johnson & Johnson in Romania.  His first marriage with Renalda Ioana Rusu on July 19, 1997, only lasted one year, and divorced on Nov. 23rd, 1998. At Little Rock, he married his former colleague Glediana Rexha as his second wife.\n\n\n== Career ==\nBiris has been the Chief Scientist of the UA Little Rock Center for Integrative Nanotechnology Sciences (CINS) since it began in 2005, serving as director since 2009. In 2007, Biris became an assistant professor in the Department of Applied Science at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock.\nBiris claims his expertise including nanotechnology, Raman spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction, planetary instrumentation (Mars dust analyzer), particulate science, nanoparticle and carbon nanotube generation, nanomedicine, nanocomposite materials for space exploration, surface technology, nano-sensors and bio nano-sensors, materials science and engineering, coating technology, hydrogen interaction with metals, alloys, and carbon nanostructures.\nHe holds thirty-three patents in nanotechnology, tissue engineering, bio-nanotechnology, space exploration and materials science. He is working on patents in energy and sensors for military applications. Among his research achievements are the design of carbon nanostructure-based filters to remove biochemical contaminants from air and water and the development of a tissue regeneration system to grow bone tissue, already successfully used in 33 clinical trials.\nIn 2011, even under the awareness of his scientific misconduct, the University of Arkansas at Little Rock still named Alexandru Sorin Biris as a winner for the faculty excellence award for research.\n\n\n== Scientific misconducts ==\n\n\n=== Published peer-reviewed works ===\nBiris's research into nanomaterials and nanotechnology has been a subject of cheating due to concerns regarding reproducibility.\nIn 2007, Biris published a paper on “Influence of the RF Excitation of the Catalyst System on the Morphology of Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes” in J. Phys. Chem. C 2007, 111, 48, 17970–17975. This paper by Biris et al., DOI: 10.1021/jp0740346, was retracted at the request of the Editor-in-Chief due to violations of the Ethical Guidelines to Publication of Chemical Research of the American Chemical Society for reason of unacceptable redundant inclusion of text and graphics contained within a previously published paper in Chemistry of Materials (DOI: 10.1021/cm062237l)  and duplicated in The Journal of Physical Chemistry C and ACS Nano (DOI: 10.1021/nn900887m). \n\nData fabrication was found in many of Biris’ publications. For instance, In his article “Catalyst excitation by radio frequency for improved carbon nanotubes synthesis”,  Biris simply fabricated his Chemical Physics Letters 429 (2006) 204–208 article by coping Fig1a  and Fig2a in Carbon 44 (2006) 2032–2038 - also shows up in as Fig2a (left), and Nanotechnology 21 (2010) 045301 as Fig1a. Additionally he also used Fig3b in Chemical Physics Letters 429 (2006) 204–208 for Fig2a in Journal of Biomedical Optics 14 (2) , (2009) 021007, and Fig1b in Nanotechnology 21 (2010) 045301, although the experimental methods are quite different in these publications.\n\nBesides data fabrication, Biris also published the same results in multiple journals.  His articles “Graphitic materials for RF thermal ablation of tumors”,  and “Cobalt nanoparticles coated with crystalline graphitic shells as high efficient and localized RF absorbers for tumor thermal ablation”,  are the same.  His article on “‘One Step Synthesis of Ceramic Carbon Nanotube Composites with Nanojunctions’ in Nanosci. Nanotechnol. Lett. 1, 107 (2009)” was retracted due to the duplication of “‘Novel synthesis process for ceramic carbon nanotube nanocomposites with nanojunctions’ in Phys. Status Solidi A 206, 2826 (2009)” Figure 1, 2 and 3ab in NNL are copied from Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6c and Figure 7 in Phys. Status Solidi A.\n\nBiris never received punishment for his integrity issues, but instead received a lot of encouragement from the university administrators. “I am pleased that Dr. Biris has been recognized for his remarkable research as an ARA Fellow,” said UALR Chancellor Joel Anderson. “His record as a researcher, teacher, and mentor speaks for itself. In a state with limited resources, Dr. Biris has been a facilitator for leveraging funds, and his belief in nurturing the next generation of scientists is evident in his work with students.” Biris became a gem at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. Mary Good, dean of UALR's Donaghey College of Information Science and Systems Engineering, praised Biris \"did some really neat work.\" \"He just clearly was the right person to be the scientific driver behind it. He is a bit unique in the sense that we do not normally hire our own graduates. But he is an extraordinary young man and we've made an exception, and so far, our judgment has been more than borne out as being a good one.\" \"He doesn't want to do for others, he's an encourager and he helps, but it's important for them to do the work themselves,\" says Bill Walker, UALR's vice chancellor for advancement, who considers Biris a friend as well as a colleague.\n\n\n=== Spin-out company NuShores Biosciences LLC ===\nIn 2014, Alexandru Biris formed a startup company called NuShores Biosciences. This was designed to exploit patents held by Biris and the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. NuShores Biosciences, LLC (NuShores),  was formed to commercialize patented bone and tissue regeneration technologies developed at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock from over $12 million in grant research to date. Biris won a $1.7 million Fast Track grant from the National Institutes of Health to support NuShores’ bone regeneration research. \nBiris holds the position of Chief Technology Officer at the company.\n\n\n== References ==",

The first children's book by the author, published in 1969, it tells the story of a color known as Flicts, that does not seem to fit anywhere on planet Earth alongside the other colors.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAccording to Ziraldo's daughter, Daniela Thomas, the book was conceived when the author, in search of help to publish his comic Jeremias, o Bom, approached editor Fernando de Castro Ferro, who asked Ziraldo if he instead had a children's book ready to be published. He lied and said yes, and spent the next two days designing what would become Flicts.\n\n\n== Major themes ==\nPublished in 1969 during the military dictatorship in Brazil, some national authors, such as Pedro Bandeira and Roger Mello, have compared the feeling of exclusion felt by the book's protagonist to the persecution of artists during that time by the government.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nBrazilian poet Carlos Drummond de Andrade published a review of Flicts on Jornal do Brasil where he called it \"wonderful\", saying he lacked the words to truly define what the book was, concluding by saying that's \"exactly one of the wonders of Flicts: it doesn't need defining. It is.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Love, Prison, Wisdom and Heartaches is a studio album by American country artist Connie Smith. It was released on April 11, 2024, via Fat Possum Records. It is the 37th solo studio album in Smith's recording career and is a collection of 12 tracks. The album contains covers of songs previously recorded by artists. Since its release, the album has received positive reviews from critics.\n\n\n== Background ==\nConnie Smith has been considered among country music's most \"underrated\" and \"influential\" artists. She first became known for a string of top ten singles beginning with 1964's eight-week number one US country song \"Once a Day\". After her commercial success waned in the late 1970s, she settled into domestic life and but continued to sporadically return to her country career. This was in part due to the personal and professional collaboration she developed with Marty Stuart beginning in the 1990s. Since 1998, she has released four studio albums with her most recent being 2021's The Cry of the Heart (issued on Fat Possum Records). Fat Possum would also release Love, Prison, Wisdom and Heartaches.\n\n\n== Recording and content ==\nLove, Prison, Wisdom and Heartaches was produced by Smith's husband and musical collaborator Marty Stuart. It was recorded at East Iris Studios in Nashville, Tennessee. Unlike her most recent album projects, the collection is a series of cover songs. However, Smith herself did not describe the album as a covers disc. \"I’m singing on behalf of my friends. Hoping to share them while passing along their songs.\" The album features songs first recorded by Merle Haggard, Loretta Lynn, George Jones and Dottie West.\n\n\n== Release and critical reception ==\nLove, Wisdom, Prison and Heartaches was given a surprise digital release on April 11, 2024. The physical version of the album will be released on May 24, 2024. The album has since received positive reviews. Billboard wrote, \"Smith’s voice is still an instrument of formidable power and style, while this gorgeous record is an essential listen for fans of old-school country.\" The Kingsport Times-News gave the disc a positive review as well, commenting, \"Embedded within the tears and fears and aching breaking heart of Smith’s new album stands like a statue the quest for hope.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nAll credits are adapted from the liner notes of Love, Prison, Wisdom and Heartaches. All session players are credited under the title \"musician\".\nMusical personnel\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

He joined as the film's composer in 2018. The album consists of all eleven songs, which 5 of them are theme songs and composed by Anirudh Ravichander and The lyrics were penned by Vivek, Ku. Karthik, Dhanush and Karthik Subbaraj.The first single track, \"Marana Mass\" was released on 3 December 2018, followed by \"Ullallaa\" which released on 7 December 2018.

Behindwoods rated the album 3.25/5 stating that \"Anirudh has crafted a pakka 'marana mass' album filled with Rajini-ism!\".OnlyKollywood rated the album 3.5 out of 5, with a verdict \"Petta sounds very different and powerful on the first hearing itself, and takes various routes thereon. Being such a large assembly of songs and themes, it’s fair to have variable favorites, but the common point here is the Thalaivar factor that is maintained throughout. This is a brave and fresh stride for Anirudh who reduces his EDM influences and concentrates on a meter which collaborates retro sounds with top-notch arrangements. While the songs are freewheeling and enjoyable, the themes form an album of their own and help us visualize the characters and backgrounds. For most parts, this is a soundtrack that will rule our playlists in the days to come.\"  Cinemakaramkapi called it \"a power packed album with a running time of 28 mins. Addictive and will remain in memory for long, am quite sure.\". Moviecrow rated the album 3 out of 5 and stated \"Petta is what you call a feast of an album! Anirudh and Karthik Subbaraj gloriously let their inner Superstar fans serve a soundtrack that's a delight to hear!.\"Studioflicks rated the album 3 out of 5, and stated \"On the whole, Petta is completely a tribute from Anirudh and his entire team for Thalaivar Rajnikanth. Apart from all the other factors of analysis, Petta does an impeccable justice to the Rajinikanth fans league.\" Karthik Srinivasan of Milliblog expressed some discontent and stated that \"Karthik Subbaraj’s shift from Santhosh Narayanan, for his biggest film, seems like a blunder.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nThe tracklist of the film was released in the form of a Jukebox on 9 December 2018, through the official YouTube channel of Sony Music India..The Audio Launch was held in a grand manner on 9th December 2018 in a private College where the audio was launched with much fanfare.\n\n\n== Album credits ==\n\n\n=== Producer(s) ===\nAnirudh Ravichander\n\n\n=== Songwriter(s) ===\nAnirudh Ravichander (Composer, Arranger)\nVivek, Ku.

        "content": "Diaboliad (Russian: Дьяволиада) is a short story by Mikhail Bulgakov. It was the only story of his to be published as a book in his lifetime.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1923 Mikhail Bulgakov met Nikolai Semenovich Angarskiy, who was the senior editor and manager of the almanac Nedra. After making acquaintance, Angarskiy subsequently began publishing Bulgakov's stories in the journal, such as The Fatal Eggs and others. Bulgakov read the story to Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy, who liked it very much, however Bulgakov himself noted in his diary twice that he himself was not pleased with the story. Diaboliad was first published in 1924. In 1925, the story was published separately as Bulgakov's own book. Two months after publication, the Joint State Political Directorate of the USSR confiscated the edition, although Angarskiy secured approval from the Glavlit to publish a second edition of the book. In 1926, it was successfully published again, however Bulgakov then cut ties with the publishing house. Literary critic Yevgeny Zamyatin lauded the story for its cinematic structure and blend of the fantastic and everyday.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nVarfolomey Korotkov, the main character, is a clerk in a match factory. The factory is marked by disorder - employees receive their wages with constant delays; they are paid not with money, but with matches; and the management changes inexplicably often for unknown reasons. One day, a new manager is appointed to the factory. He immediately fires Korotkov for a minor mistake, who in return tries to justify himself. Suddenly it turns out that there are two completely identical managers of the factory, a shaved one and a bearded one. Korotkov attempts to talk to a singular manager in regards to his position are in vain. Korotkov finally goes insane, and jumps from a high-rise building while being chased by criminal investigation.\n\n\n== Themes ==\nThe story's main character, Korotkov, is portrayed as the classical \"little man\" literary hero that appeared in Russian literature during the realism epoch. Korotkov is portrayed as a victim of the Soviet bureaucratic machine. Bulgakov also uses references and literary techniques of both Nikolai Gogol and Fyodor Dostoevsky.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "This is a glossary of mereology. Mereology is the philosophical study of part-whole relationships, also called parthood relationships.\n\n\n== A ==\n\nanti-symmetry of parthood\nIn mereology, a principle stating that if A is part of B and B is part of A, then A and B are identical, reinforcing the notion of precise part-whole relationships.\n\natomic mereology\nA branch of mereology that deals with wholes that are ultimately composed of indivisible parts, or atoms, focusing on how such atomic parts combine to form larger wholes.\n\natomless gunk\nSee gunk.\n\n\n== B ==\n\n\n== C ==\n\ncalculus of individuals\nBecause mereology applies to individuals, it is called the calculus of individuals, in contrast to set theory, which is called the calculus of classes.\n\nclassical mereology\nClassical mereology is the mereological theory obtained by assuming that the parthood relation is a partial ordering, and that the unrestricted fusion principle holds.\n\ncomposition\nThe relation that connects many things to a single thing that includes whatever is in the many things, and nothing extraneous to them.\n\ncompositional universalism\nA position in mereology that holds any collection of entities, regardless of how disparate, can constitute a whole, leading to the possibility of any entities forming a composite object. Also called \"mereological universalism\".\n\n\n== D ==\n\n\n== E ==\n\nextensional mereology\nA branch of mereology that focuses on the relations of parts to wholes based on the extensions of the parts, without regard to the nature or properties of the parts.\n\nextensionality\nThe principle in mereology stating that two objects are identical if they have the same proper parts.\n\n\n== F ==\n\nfusion\nSynonym for \"mereological sum\".\n\n\n== G ==\n\ngeneral extensional mereology\nGeneral extensional mereology is the mereological theory obtained by assuming that the parthood relation is a partial ordering and that the strong supplementation principle, and the unrestricted fusion principle, hold.\n\nground mereology \nGround mereology is the mereological theory obtained by assuming that the parthood relation is a partial ordering.\n\ngunk\nAn object or substance whose parts all have proper parts, which means the object is divisible into parts indefinitely, with no simplest parts or atoms. (Short for \"atomless gunk\".)\n\ngunky\nAdjective describing entities, or worlds, made out of atomless gunk – that is, objects all of whose parts have proper parts.\n\n\n== H ==\n\nharmony\nThe principle that an object x is part of an object y if, and only if, the region in space occupied by x is part of the region in space occupied by y.\n\nhunky\nAdjective describing a possible world that is both gunky and junky.\n\n\n== I ==\n\nidentity of indiscernibles\nA principle often discussed in the context of mereology, stating that no two distinct objects have exactly the same properties, thus differentiating even similar wholes by their specific parts.\n\n\n== J ==\n\njunk\nA state of affairs where all objects are proper parts of something else, which means objects are composable into further objects indefinitely, never forming a complete \"world\". (Short for \"worldless junk\"; coined as the converse of \"atomless gunk\".)\n\njunky\nAdjective describing a possible world with junk in it, i.e., a world where every object is a proper part of something else.\n\n\n== K ==\n\nknug\nTerm coined by John Parsons for what is more commonly called \"junk\"; coined to be \"gunk\" written backwards.\n\nknunk\nA proposed term for structures that are junky and all their members are gunky; coinage by Giberman, inspired by Parsons's \"knug\", to reflect what must have been meant by the coiners of \"hunky\", since, if worlds are taken to be concrete objects, no gunky-and-junky worlds are possible.\n\n\n== L ==\n\n\n== M ==\n\nmereological continuity\nThe principle in mereology that suggests wholes are continuously divisible into smaller and smaller parts, with no abrupt discontinuities in the structure of the objects.\n\nmereological essentialism\nThe view in mereology that parts are essential to the wholes they constitute; that is, a whole cannot exist without having precisely those parts.\n\nmereological extensionality\nThe principle in mereology stating that two objects are identical if they have the same proper parts.\n\nmereological fusion\nSynonym for \"mereological sum\".\n\nmereological harmony\nSee harmony.\n\nmereological monism\nThe view that, in a large and significant domain of things, classical extensional mereology is the only correct theory of parthood and composition. Not to be confused with monism.\n\nmereological nihilism\nThe philosophical position that denies the existence of composite objects, asserting that only basic, partless entities exist.\n\nmereological sum\nAn object that is composed of all and only the entities in a given collection, according to the principles of mereology.\n\nmereological universalism\nThe view that two objects always compose a third, which is to say, that mereological composition is unrestricted. Also called \"compositional universalism\".\n\nmereology\nThe study of the relationships between parts and wholes, and the principles governing the composition of objects.\n\nminimal mereology\nMinimal mereology is the mereological theory obtained by assuming that the parthood relation is a partial ordering, and that the weak supplementation principle holds.\n\nmonism\nThe view that there is only one fundamental object, which is the cosmos, and that all other objects (its parts) derive their reality from it. Formally, \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        ∃\n        !\n        x\n        )\n        B\n        x\n         \n        &\n         \n        B\n        u\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (\\exists !x)Bx~\\&~Bu}\n  \n, where \n  \n    \n      \n        u\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle u}\n  \n represents the cosmos, and \n  \n    \n      \n        B\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle B}\n  \n represents the status of being a basic actual concrete object, i.e., an object that is concrete and does not depend on anything concrete. Not to be confused with senses of \"monism\" outside of mereology, or with mereological monism.\n\n\n== N ==\n\nnon-well-founded mereology\nAn approach to mereology where parts and wholes can form circular or self-referential structures, challenging traditional, well-founded notions of parthood.\n\n\n== O ==\n\noverlap\nIn mereology, the relation between objects or sets that share at least one part in common.\n\n\n== P ==\n\nparthood\nThe relation between an entity and a composite object of which it is a part, central to mereology, the study of parts and wholes.\n\nproper parthood\nA relation between two entities where one is a part of the other but not equivalent to it, indicating a strict subset relationship in the context of mereology.\n\npluralism\nThe view there are more than one fundamental object; opposed to monism. Not to be confused with senses of \"pluralism\" outside of mereology.\n\npriority pluralism\nAnother term for pluralism, emphasizing that pluralities are metaphysically prior to wholes, although wholes exist.\n\n\n== Q ==\n\n\n== R ==\n\nreflexivity of parthood\nThe property according to which everything is part of itself.\n\n\n== S ==\n\nsimple\nIn mereology, a simple is an object that has no parts other than itself, often considered in discussions of mereological nihilism and the debate over the existence of composite objects.\n\nstrong supplementation principle\nA principle in mereology stating that if an object is not part of another, then there must be a part of the latter that does not overlap with the object, emphasizing the distinctness and separability of parts within wholes.\n\n\n== T ==\n\ntransitivity of parthood\nThe property where if A is part of B, and B is part of C, then A is part of C, emphasizing the chain-like nature of part-whole relationships.\n\n\n== U ==\n\nunderlap\nA concept in mereology where two objects do not share any parts in common, opposite of overlap, emphasizing the disjointness of the objects.\n\nunrestricted fusion\nA principle in mereology allowing for the existence of a composite object consisting of any collection of parts, regardless of how dispersed or unrelated those parts may be.\n\n\n== V ==\n\n\n== W ==\n\nworldless junk\nSee junk.\n\n\n== X ==\n\n\n== Y ==\n\n\n== Z ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nGlossary of set theory\nMereology\n\n\n== References ==",

She signed to the Profile label in 1988 and one of her first recordings, \"One Man\", reached no. 16 in the UK chart in March 1989; a remixed version made the top 50 in December 1994.  The chart performance earned her a place on the 16 March 1989 edition of Top of the Pops.\nThe single also reached no. 70 in the Billboard R&B charts two months later.\nIt was her only charting single.  After a hiatus to raise a family, she returned to the music industry in 2011, and has continued recording and performing without ever having a follow-up hit.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Gary Taylor (born Graham John Taylor, 28 November 1947) is an English bass guitarist and vocalist. His career was at its peak in the 1960s/1970s as a member of The Herd, Fox, Yellow Dog, and The Hank Wangford Band.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 1965–1969: The Herd ===\nTaylor formed the pop group The Herd in South London in 1965 with Terry Clark (vocals and rhythm guitar), Louis Cennamo (bass guitar), and Tony Chapman (drums). They signed on with Parlophone records and released three singles during 1965–66; all singles were unsuccessful. After the three singles, Clark, Cennamo, and Chapman all left the group. Stepping in for the previous personnel were Mick Underwood (briefly) on drums (who was later replaced by Andrew Steele), Andy Bown on keyboard, and a sixteen year old Peter Frampton on guitar and vocals. Taylor was originally the guitarist for the band, but he switched to bass when they were unable to find a new bassist.\n\nBetween 1967 and 1968, the Herd had a number of hit songs around the world. Their break-through song was \"From the Underworld\" in August 1967; the song went to number six in the United Kingdom. The song was based on the legend of Orpheus, and managed to get as far as it did due to copious amounts of play time on Pirate radio. The song also went to number two in the Netherlands. Their next single, \"Paradise Lost\", was released four months after From The Underworld, and despite charting in lesser countries than F.T.U., managed to chart in New Zealand. Their last major song \"I Don't Want Our Loving to Die\", released on 29 March 1968, was the highest-charting song of theirs in the UK, Netherlands, and Ireland, placing in the top 5 in all three regional charts. Taylor plays the flute solo on the song.\nBy the end of the year, Steele and Frampton left the band, the latter leaving to form Humble Pie. For the next year, Taylor and Bown carried on with new member Henry Spinetti, and also as a trio. When the Herd disbanded in 1969, Bown and Spinetti formed prog rock band Judas Jump. In 1971, Taylor and Steele reunited as \"The Herd\" to record a one-off single, titled \"You've Got Me Hangin' from Your Lovin' Tree\", which flopped.\n\n\n=== 1970–1981: Fox and Yellow Dog ===\n\nIn the early 1970s, Taylor worked as a session musician, and with Andrew Steele (formerly of the Herd), recorded with Scottish band Stealers Wheel. As a session musician, he is also said to have worked on records by Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich, Demis Roussos, Jerry Lee Lewis, Frankie goes to Hollywood, and The Proclaimers. He also worked in the band \"Kid Gloves\" with Steele. Around this time, Taylor took up a job working as a disc jockey at BBC Radio 1. He soon left the radio station to join the band Fox. Led by American songwriter Kenny Young and fronted by Australian singer Noosha Fox, they had three top 20 hits on the UK Singles Chart - \"Only You Can\" and \"Imagine Me, Imagine You\" in 1975 and \"S-S-S-Single Bed\" in 1976, the latter song topping the Austrian charts, entering number five in the UK, and later being covered by duo Bananarama.\nIn the mid-1970s (c. 1977), Taylor, with Fox members Kenny Young and Herbie Armstrong formed the group Yellow Dog. The band is considered a One-hit wonder, as their only commercial song was \"Just One More Night\". It ends on a humorous note with a telephone call in which the protagonist (a woman) continues to beg to be allowed to stay \"just one more night\" after being told emphatically \"No!\", and for this reason is considered something of a novelty song. Overall, Yellow Dog released three studio albums, only one of which charted (at number 50 in Australia), and included many famous musical figures, such as Gerry Conway of Fairport Convention, session guitarist Phil Palmer, and multi-instrumentalist and public speaker Mo Foster. Yellow Dog faded out of obscurity, and quietly disbanded around 1981.\n\n\n=== 1981 onwards: recent years ===\nIn the 1980s, Taylor moved away from pop and rock music, to play folk and country; he toured with Hank Wangford's backing band. He recorded with the band in the 1980s, including Hank's album \"Hank Wangford – Cowboys Stay On Longer\" in 1980. They performed at the Cambridge Folk Festival in 1982, and were nominated for a Edinburgh Comedy Award for \"Best Comedy Show\" in 1984. After moving to Australia in the late 1980s, he started working as a jingle writer and a voice over artist for companies in both Australia and Singapore.\nWhile in Australia, he met Hank Marvin, who also migrated to the country a few years before Taylor. He asked Taylor to play guitar and bass on his album \"Hank plays Cliff\", released on compact disc in 1995.  Taylor still performs today, in Australia. He is currently a member of Marvin's group \"The Hank Marvin Gypsy Quartet\". He is also a freelance music teacher, teaching people how to play guitar and bass. Taylor co-owns \"Sh-boom\" studios in Perth with Trevor Spencer, who in the 1970s was one half of the Tarney/Spencer Band with Alan Tarney.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nGraham Taylor was born in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey in 1947. Taylor moved to Perth, Western Australia in the 1980s, and used to be Hank Marvin's neighbour. He still lives in Australia.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "On 5 July 1942, the German battleship Tirpitz, sailing as part of a squadron under the command of Admiral Otto Schniewind to intercept convoy PQ 17, was attacked by the Soviet submarine K-21, commanded by Captain Second Rank Nikolai Lunin. The submarine fired four torpedoes from a considerable distance. The result of the attack was not directly observed by Lunin, but the sounds of explosions were noted, which he interpreted as the result of torpedo hits. This was the basis for Soviet press claims that the battleship had been damaged. However, no torpedo hits were noted on the German squadron, and moreover, the attack itself was not detected. The German ships continued on their original course for approximately five hours, after which they turned back due to the inherent riskiness of the operation and the futility of continuing it against a convoy that had effectively ceased to exist as a unified entity.\nIn the Soviet Union, literature aimed at the masses was dominated by an opinion of the success of the attack. This was based on the Sovinformburo report and wartime press articles. The historiography of foreign countries initially concurred that the Tirpitz had not been struck by torpedoes, given the absence of documentary evidence attesting to the success of the attack. This evidence was not present in German documents or the memoirs of the participants on the German side. Following the return of the squadron, the battleship Tirpitz did not require repairs. A British-led team, including a Soviet specialist, conducted an examination of the hull of the battleship, which had been sunk in 1944. The examination revealed no evidence of torpedo hits or repairs on the ship. A contemporary reconstruction, based on the fullest available evidence, demonstrates that the attack had no theoretical possibility of success, given that the torpedoes were launched from a distance exceeding their maximum range. Nevertheless, the event is of significant historical importance to the Russian Navy, as it represents the only instance of Soviet submariners launching an attack against a heavy (larger that a destroyer) enemy warship.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nOn 27 June 1942, the convoy PQ 17, one of the Arctic convoys that delivered weapons and resources necessary for the war effort to the USSR, commenced its journey from Iceland to Arkhangelsk. The 35 transports of the convoy carried cargo consisting of 297 aircraft, 594 tanks, over 4,000 vehicles and more than 156,000 tonnes of other cargo. Convoying this convoy entailed a significant degree of risk. The German aviation, which had numerical superiority in the Barents Sea area, was able to operate around the clock due to polar day and favourable weather conditions. The utilisation of enemy submarines and surface ships was also greatly facilitated by this circumstance. Nonetheless, for political reasons (in the summer of 1942, the situation at the front for the Soviet Union was critical and the country was in dire need of assistance), the British War Cabinet, headed by W. Churchill, decided to send the convoy. Its protection was provided by a close protection force of 19 warships and two submarines, a close protection cruiser force of four heavy cruisers and two destroyers, and a long-range protection force of an aircraft carrier, two battleships, two cruisers and 12 destroyers. Furthermore, a curtain of 13 submarines – comprising eight British, four Soviet and one French vessel – was positioned in the vicinity of potential German surface ship transit routes. At the same time, there were significant limitations on the use of these forces - the cruiser and long-range cover detachments could not operate east of Bear Island due to limited fuel reserves and the risk of enemy aircraft attack.\n\nSimultaneously, the German military was formulating a strategy to thwart the convoy. In addition to the deployment of aircraft and submarines, the plan included the use of large surface vessels. The operation, designated as Rösselsprung, or \"Horse Walk,\" permitted the utilization of all available heavy German naval vessels in Norway, including the battleship Tirpitz, heavy cruisers Admiral Scheer, Lützow, and Admiral Hipper, and their respective escorts.\nOn 1 July, the convoy was identified by German aerial reconnaissance, and by the evening of 2 July, the German ships commenced their transit from Trondheim and Bogen Bay to the forward base in Altafjord. The concentration was concluded on 4 July, with the heavy cruiser Lützow and three destroyers sustaining damage from rock landings and being withdrawn from the operation. Following the refuelling of the German squadron under Admiral Otto Schneewind in the afternoon of 4 July, the squadron was prepared to embark on a sea voyage. However, due to the lack of information regarding the location of the convoy's long-range covering squadron, the order to commence the operation was postponed. Concurrently, British intelligence had received reports of German heavy ships leaving the Trondheim base, but had no precise information on their further whereabouts. Given the speed of the German ships, they could have overtaken the convoy by the late evening of 4 July, risking the complete destruction of the convoy itself, as well as the forces of direct protection and close cover. In view of this, the First Sea Lord (Chief of the Naval Staff) of Great Britain, Admiral Dudley Pound, ordered on the evening of 4 July that the convoy be scattered and that the close-cover cruiser group be recalled to the west.\nFrom that point on, Operation Rösselsprung was pointless, since the task of destroying the ships in the convoy, which were travelling separately, could be done much more effectively by submarine and air attack (which was eventually done). However, the Germans did not have full information about the convoy's break-up and believed it had split into two groups. On the morning of 5 July, after a German reconnaissance plane had spotted a long-range convoy escort moving westwards and posing no threat at that distance, the German command decided to launch the operation. At 11:55 on 5 July, the Tirpitz lifted anchor and the German squadron began to set sail.\n\n\n== German squadron before the attack ==\n\nThe German squadron that set sail consisted of the battleship Tirpitz, heavy cruisers Admiral Scheer and Admiral Hipper, destroyers Z4 Richard Beitzen, Z14 Friedrich Inn, Z24, Z27, Z28, Z29, Z30, and torpedo boats T7 and T15. Schneewind selected the fairway to the west of Rolvsøy Island as the optimal route for accessing the open sea, rather than the eastern skerry fairway prescribed by the higher command, which afforded access to the open sea in the vicinity of Porsangerfjorden. Schneewind's reasoning was that he considered the eastern channel to be more dangerous, both in terms of enemy submarines and the risk of mines being detonated. However, the route chosen by Schneewind took the German squadron into the area of the patrolling submarine K-21. At 16:06, the squadron commenced its transit across the open sea, increasing its speed to 24 knots and reorganising its formation in accordance with the anti-submarine defence protocol. This entailed a frontline formation with torpedo boats positioned at the flanks, preceding the heavy ships. Such a formation forced the submarine attacking from a forward course (and attacking fast surface ships was only possible from a submarine's underwater position) to lower its periscope and increase its depth to avoid being detected and attacked by the destroyers; but after passing the destroyers, the submarine had no time to organise a successful attack on the protected heavy ships. An attempt by a submarine to evade the order had a similar result - it simply did not have enough time to get within torpedo range of the attacked ships, the squadron literally whizzed past the submarine. To reduce the risk of torpedoing the destroyers, at 16:46 Schneewind ordered them to move in a small zigzag. The heavy ships continued to move without zigzagging. Furthermore, the Ar 196 seaplane was launched from the battleship Tirpitz with the objective of searching for enemy submarines. The squadron proceeded on a course of 30° (north-northeast), with the intention of reaching a distance of 25 miles from the coast as expeditiously as possible, given that the risk of submarine attack was greatest in this area. The distance between the heavy ships was initially 2,000 metres, but at 16:47 it was increased to 3,000 metres.\n\n\n== K-21 before the attack ==\nIn accordance with the operation to provide escort for the PQ-17 convoy, the Soviet Northern Fleet allocated four submarines to attack German heavy ships: K-2, K-21, K-22 and Shch-403. Of these, submarine K-21, commanded by Hero of the Soviet Union, Captain 2nd Rank Nikolai Lunin, was assigned position No. 2A, situated in proximity to the Norwegian coast and tasked with obstructing the fjord exits between the islands of Sørøya and Jelmsøya. By this time, Nikolay Lunin had accrued considerable experience as a submariner, having completed seven combat missions (five of which he commanded the Shch-421 and two the K-21). He claimed the destruction of eight enemy transports, although a post-war study of German documents revealed that only one ship, the 2975 grt displacement transport Konsul Schulte, had been sunk. By mid-1942, Lunin had developed his own tactical style, characterised by, among other things, active search for the enemy, maximum use of acoustic observation data, preference for firing from long and even extreme distances with full bow or stern salvos, poor use of the periscope after the initial detection of the target (the commander concentrated on observing only the selected target, which often led to the detection of only part of the enemy convoy or formation), excessive use of aft torpedo tubes, exaggerated assessment of the enemy's anti-submarine defence capabilities (which led to firing from long distances and frequent refusal to observe the results of attacks), careless attitude to facts and maximally optimistic assessment of the results of his torpedo attacks (all observations were interpreted solely to confirm success, and facts to the contrary were not taken into account.)\nThe submarine K-21 commenced its fifth combat cruise on 18 June 1942. The primary objective of the campaign was to detect and attack heavy enemy surface vessels. Consequently, four of the six torpedoes in the bow torpedo tubes were configured with a 5 m depth of travel setting, which ensured that deep-seated battleships and cruisers were hit in the vulnerable part of the hull below the armour belt. The remaining torpedoes (two in the bow torpedo tubes and four in the stern torpedo tubes) were set to a depth of 2 metres. On the morning of 19 June, the submarine was travelling in a surface position in low cloud conditions when it was attacked by an enemy aircraft. Two aerial bombs exploded approximately 30–40 metres from the boat. The concussion caused damage to the K-21, resulting in the inability to use the fast dive tank and equalisation tank No. 1. This limited the submarine's manoeuvrability in the underwater position. On 27 June, K-21 was subjected to a second attack by enemy aircraft. However, the bombs that were dropped near the board failed to detonate, limiting the damage to eight bullet holes in the light hull. On the night of 28 June, following the receipt of an order, K-21 proceeded to position No. 2A, where it conducted patrols over the following days, having no contact with the enemy until 5 July.\n\n\n== The attack ==\n\nAt 16:30, K-21 hydroacoustician A. Smetanin heard a noise, which he identified as the sound of ships' propellers. At that moment, the K-21 was in an underwater position at a depth of 20 metres and was sailing at a speed of 3 knots. The hydroacoustician reported that the target was located at a distance of 12 miles from the submarine, with a heading angle of 30° on the starboard side. The reconstruction presented by N. Skrynnikov and M. Morozov (hereinafter referred to as the reconstruction) indicates that the actual distance between the German squadron and K-21 at that moment was approximately 35 miles, with a course angle of 3°. This suggests that the German squadron proceeded directly towards K-21. The watch commander of K-21 at the time of the acoustic contact was Senior Mate F. Lukyanov, the boat commander was asleep in his cabin. At 16:40 K-21 surfaced under the periscope, but nothing could be seen on the horizon. At 17:00, the submarine altered its course in order to proceed directly towards the noise source. Concurrently, the periscope was elevated, through which an adversarial submarine, identified as a German U-boat, was observed approximately 4–5 miles away. This was in fact the upper masts of the German fleet, which, according to the reconstruction, were situated approximately 22 miles away. The capacity to observe vessels at such a considerable distance was a consequence of refraction over the surface of the sea. A torpedo attack was announced on the boat, and a command was issued to prepare torpedo tubes for firing. At approximately the same time, Lunin, who had been awakened by a messenger, entered K-21 control.\nAt 17:02, K-21 commenced a left turn, and at 17:10, it increased its speed to 5 knots, preparing to engage the enemy \"submarine\" with its stern torpedo tubes. At 17:12, Lunin altered the target identification, assuming that instead of a submarine, he was observing two torpedo boats in a ledge formation at a distance of 6–7 miles. He then proceeded to attack one of them, also utilising the stern torpedo tubes. In point of fact, Lunin continued to observe the tops of the masts of the German heavy ships, which, according to the reconstruction, were at that time approximately 17 miles away. At 17:18, the submarine commander finally correctly identified the target, estimating the distance to the German heavy ships to be 10–12 miles (14–15 miles according to the reconstruction).\nAt 17:02, the submarine deviates to the left, which results in her deviating from the course of the German ships. At 17:23, Lunin estimates the composition of the enemy squadron to be the battleship Tirpitz, the heavy cruiser Admiral Scheer, and eight torpedo boats. Additionally, he notes the presence of a seaplane Ar 196 over the squadron. The heavy cruiser Admiral Hipper is not identified until the end of the attack. The course of the German squadron as recorded in the K-21 logbook is erroneously depicted as 85° (east), rather than the true course of 30° (north-northeast). Such a gross error in determining the course of an experienced commander in conditions of excellent visibility is difficult to explain; the reconstruction concluded that it was most likely not a mistake, but a deliberate distortion of the facts by Lunin to present his actions in a more favourable light to the higher command.\n\nAt 17:25, K-21 commenced an attack course, increasing speed to 6 knots. This was ordered by Lunin, who had previously instructed the submarine to put the rudder on the starboard side. Based on the true course of the German squadron, such a course would have allowed the submarine to attack the Admiral Scheer on a course of departure from the aft torpedo tubes. However, the entries in the K-21's logbook gave the impression that the submarine intended to attack the squadron from the bow torpedo tubes on a course of approach. Concurrently, the lids of the bow torpedo tubes (Nos. 1 and 2) were never opened, thereby confirming the intention to launch the attack with the stern torpedo tubes. The authors of the reconstruction have determined that this decision was erroneous. They contend that Lunin incorrectly determined the distance to the German squadron and laid on a course of departure instead of a course of rapprochement. As a result, the K-21 moved too far away from the course of the German squadron. It is notable that between 17:23 and 17:46, the K-21 watch log is devoid of any information regarding the target bearing, and there are no entries in the acoustic watch log between 17:23 and 17:33. The authors of the reconstruction posit that these data did not correspond to Lunin's ex post facto version of the attack and, therefore, were not included in the documents (completed after the attack). At 17:29, K-21 slightly corrected its course, changing it by 5°.\nThe attack prepared by Lunin from aft torpedo launchers was thwarted. However, at 17:35-17:37, the German squadron, maintaining the front line, began a right turn to a course of 90° – the general course to the east. This course was believed by Schneewind to lead the German ships to the convoy. The speed was reduced to 21 knots for the duration of the turn. This manoeuvre is reflected in numerous German documents, particularly in the combat logs of all German ships that were part of the squadron. The K-21's logbook offers a markedly disparate account, with Lunin stating that by 17:36, the German squadron had executed a 90-100° left turn, reorganising itself into a column. Due to the intricate manoeuvring of German ships during the turn, as well as the limited observation through the periscope, it can be assumed that Lunin may have lacked an accurate understanding of the situation.\nAt 17:38, the Admiral Scheer, which is in the process of turning, is on a course aimed directly at the submarine at a distance of approximately seven miles. At 17:40, the K-21 submerges, sharply turning the rudder to the starboard side and, by 17:46, setting a new course, rapidly approaching the enemy. Concurrently, the submarine's watch log reveals a discrepancy between the course of the Tirpitz and other German ships and the information provided in German documents. At the time in question, the German vessels were facing the submarine with their bow or left cheekbone and were moving in a front-to-east formation, rather than in a north-northwest-bound column as indicated in Lunin's records. Given the implausibility of such a gross error occurring at such a distance (approximately five miles) in conditions of good visibility, the authors of the reconstruction have concluded that Lunin's fictitious parameters of the German squadron are the most probable explanation. According to the reconstruction, Lunin intended to attack the Admiral Scheer, but made a mistake, considering the intermediate course of 60° taken by the heavy cruiser in the process of turning for the new general course.\n\nAt 17:50, K-21 once again raised her periscope. By this time, the German squadron was in the final stages of the turn. The Admiral Scheer was observed to be positioned to the left of the submarine at a distance of 4.5 miles, while the Admiral Hipper was observed to be approaching K-21 from a distance of 3.5 miles. In silhouette, especially when viewed from the bow, this heavy cruiser was very similar to the battleship Tirpitz, and for this reason, as the authors of the reconstruction suggest, was mistaken for it by Lunin. To explain the observed position of the squadron, Lunin states in the log that at 17:50 the German squadron allegedly made a \"sudden\" turn to the right, quickly reorganising itself from a column to a front. Lunin promptly lowered the periscope, increased the diving depth to 20 metres and rotated the K-21 90° to the right in order to launch an attack with the aft torpedo tubes. Meanwhile, the German squadron had completed the 90° turn by 17:55 and increased speed to 24 knots.\nAt 17:57, according to the reconstruction, K-21 had missed the destroyers above her and was in a favourable position to attack the cruiser Admiral Hipper, which was only 0.7 miles away. Attacking the battleship Tirpitz was no longer a viable option, as the distance to it was 2.4 miles, which exceeded the maximum range of torpedoes, and continued to increase. However, an opportune moment for the salvo was missed. Lunin was reluctant to ascend to periscope depth in order to ascertain the situation and make a decision to launch torpedoes, given his proximity to the destroyer escort. Consequently, the anti-submarine formation of the German squadron was able to fulfil its task. Following 17:57, the distance between the K-21 and the Admiral Hipper began to increase rapidly, accompanied by a corresponding increase in the angle of the torpedo encounter. This resulted in the submarine and the squadron \"running away\" from each other.\nAt 18:00, the K-21 surfaced to periscope depth. According to the reconstruction, by this time the Admiral Hipper was at a distance of 1.6 miles and was actually showing the stern to the Soviet submarine commander. At the same time, the Tirpitz was at a distance of approximately three miles from the K-21, which created the illusion that it could be hit. In fact, the maximum range of K-21 torpedoes, which was 2.2 miles, rendered it impossible to hit the battleship. According to the recollections of an eyewitness of the attack, Lieutenant A. Kotov, the submarine commander expressed doubt as to the expediency of launching torpedoes:\n\nLunin - shoot, don't shoot? It's a long distance. And the XO: \"Shoot, Comrade Commander, shoot!\"\n\nAfter a brief period of deliberation, Lunin reached a decision. At 18:01, he turned the boat to the left in order to provide the necessary angle of anticipation. At 18:01:30, he launched four torpedoes at four-second intervals from the stern torpedo tubes at the battleship Tirpitz. The watch log indicates that the distance between the K-21 and the battleship was estimated to be between 1.8 and 2 miles, which is close to the maximum range of the torpedoes. The reconstruction indicates that the distance between the submarines was 3.3 miles, which precluded the success of the attack. Upon launching the torpedoes, Lunin lowered the periscope and increased the submarine's sinking depth to 30 metres, subsequently returning it to its original course and leading away from the German squadron. The refusal to observe the results of the attack was argued by Lunin on the basis of a sharp turn of one of the destroyers towards the submarine, which is not confirmed by German documents. The authors of the reconstruction posit that this manoeuvre was a manifestation of reasonable caution. Following the launch of torpedoes, the probability of detection of the submarine, especially from aircraft, was increased. Conversely, Lunin realised the unlikelihood of success and saw no point in continuing observations through the periscope.\nAt 18:04, as indicated in the K-21's logbook, two minutes and 15 seconds after the torpedoes were launched, the sub heard two explosions. In response, K-21 slightly changed course and increased the diving depth to 40 meters. This was evidenced by the noise of destroyers sharply increased to the right and left of the submarine. Subsequently, between 18:08 and 18:10, K-21 continued to alter its course, leaning to the west. Concurrently, the logbook recorded the noise of destroyers in front and on the sides of the boat. The data regarding the noises emitted by the destroyers appears to be at odds with the findings of the K-21 acoustic watch log, which, as of 18 August, indicated only vague noises on the aft corners of the starboard side. These noises were reminiscent of the sound of a submarine passage. The German squadron did not record any explosions and did not search for the enemy submarine, as the attack was not detected. The German ships continued to move in the same direction, at the same speed and in the same formation as before. According to the reconstruction, the K-21 torpedoes crossed the Hipper's wake about 1.5 miles astern of the cruiser and sank.\n\n\n== Actions of the K-21 and the German squadron after the attack ==\nAt 18:31 (i.e. half an hour after the attack), K-21 surfaced at periscope depth, observing the smoke and mast tops of the departing German squadron (the distance between the submarine and the German squadron had by this time reached 16 miles). At 18:31, 18:32, and 18:38, the submarine's watch log records the occurrence of muffled rolling explosions, each lasting approximately 20 seconds. The acoustic watch log indicates that two explosions were recorded at 18:25 and 18:27. At 19:05, K-21 once again surfaced at periscope depth. Having found no evidence of the attack, it rose to the surface and commenced transmitting a radiogram at 19:09. The exact text of the radiogram remains classified, but it can be reconstructed from records in other documents:\n\nAt 18.00 at W=71°25'N D=23°40'ost attacked enemy ships consisting of battleships \"Tirpitz\", \"Scheer\" and eight destroyers, heading for Nord-Ost. Went out to attack the LC \"Tirpitz\". Heard two explosions. The commander of the \"K-21\"\nIn this instance, both the trajectory of the German squadron and the coordinates of the point of attack were determined with a certain degree of inaccuracy. Having received confirmation of the receipt of the radiogram, the submarine submerged once more. The subsequent voyage of the submarine proceeded without incident, and on 9 July 1942, K-21 returned to its base.\nThe K-21 radiogram was decoded at the Northern Fleet Headquarters at 19:55 on 5 July. The content of the radiogram was immediately transmitted to the British military mission, which at 20:04 transmitted the corresponding radiogram to the Admiralty, as well as to the ships of the British fleet. Subsequently, a report on the enemy was transmitted by an unencrypted message \"on the fleet\" working on long wavelengths to a powerful radio station located in Cleethorpes. This message was received by both British ships and submarines, as well as by the German squadron.\n\nOn 5 July at 19:16, the German squadron was detected by the crew of the Il-4 reconnaissance plane, under the command of Captain I. Y. Garbuz. However, the observations made by Captain Garbuz were not entirely accurate. He determined the composition of the German squadron to be 11 ships, without identifying their specific classes. Furthermore, he made an error in determining the coordinates and speed of the squadron, indicating that it was moving at a speed of 10 knots. The radiogram transmitted by the aircraft was decoded almost simultaneously with the K-21 radiogram. Its content was also communicated to the British mission and served as the basis for a new message transmitted by the Cleethorpes radio station. At approximately 20:24, the British submarine HMS Unshaken detected the Schniewinda squadron, identifying its composition as Tirpitz, Admiral Hipper and six destroyers, travelling at a speed of 22 knots. Due to the unfavorable mutual position of the submarine and the squadron, the commander of the Unshaken, C. E. Oxborough, was unable to launch an attack. Consequently, he transmitted a radiogram of enemy sightings shortly after 22:00.\nConcurrently, the German fleet command conducted an assessment of the potential for continuing the operation. The receipt of reports from the radio station in Cleethorpes provided clear evidence of the squadron's detection, thereby increasing the probability of establishing a permanent surveillance. Concurrently, German air reconnaissance lost contact with the British long-range cover detachment, which included an aircraft carrier. This created the potential risk of the German squadron being intercepted. Finally, from submarines, aviation and radio intelligence, numerous reports were received indicating the disbanding of the convoy and the dispersal of its ships at great distances from each other. This made the continuation of the operation pointless. After a period of indecision, the commander of the Kriegsmarine, Grand Admiral E. Raeder, gave the order to cease the operation. At 22:51 on 5 July, the battleship Tirpitz commenced a change of direction, and at approximately 11:40 on 6 July, the German squadron arrived at the forward anchorage in Altafjord. Following the replenishment of fuel, the squadron proceeded to its permanent base in Bugen Bay, completing the transition at approximately 04:00 on 8 July. Further Tirpitz exercises were conducted in the Vestfjorden between 27 July and 31 July, 17 September and 21 September, 14 October and 15 October, 28 September and 1 October, 19 October and 22 October, and 23 October and 24 October. On 23 October and 24 October, the vessel passed from Bugen Bay to Trondheim.\n\n\n== Evaluation of the results of the attack ==\n\n\n=== Initial period (July–August 1942) ===\nOn 8 July 1942, a report was issued by the Sovinformburo, which stated that a Soviet submarine had attacked the Tirpitz, hitting it with two torpedoes and causing significant damage to the battleship. The following day, more detailed articles were published in the newspapers Pravda and Krasny Flot, in which the name of the boat commander was mentioned. It was stated that, due to damage to the battleship Tirpitz, the German squadron was forced to abandon the attack on the convoy and return to port. This information was also disseminated in the media of the anti-Hitler coalition countries, and foreign news agencies were officially given Lunin's photo.\nOn or before 30 July 1942, Lunin prepared a report on the results of the attack, in which he expressed his opinion:\n\nUndoubtedly hit 2 torpedoes during the attack on the LC \"Tirpitz\" is reliable, which should be established by reconnaissance, but at the same time I admit the possibility that the lead destroyer, turned at the time of the shot on the countercourse with the battleship intercepted torpedoes on themselves, in favor of this assumption testify to the subsequent large explosions.\nThe conclusions drawn from the submarine brigade headquarters documents posit that one torpedo struck the battleship and another the destroyer, following the sinking of the latter. It is postulated that the explosions heard 20–30 minutes after the attack were the result of depth bombs detonating. Soviet intelligence also received information about a single torpedo hitting the stern of the battleship Tirpitz; Morozov and Skrynnikov note that Soviet intelligence reportedly had no agents in the area where the German battleship was based and received information through German patriots communicating with the local population. It is likely that the distorted information received was based on the damage caused by the landing on the rocks and subsequent repair of the heavy cruiser Lutzow.\nBy August 1942, scepticism prevailed in the Soviet Navy leadership that the attack had been unsuccessful or had resulted in minimal, quickly repaired damage to the German battleship. On 24 August 1942, an order was issued to award the K-21 crew combat decorations for the submarine's fifth and sixth combat tours, and Lunin and 16 other crew members were awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Battle, which was not among the highest honours. The proposal of the Northern Fleet Command to award the K-21 the rank of Guard was changed by the decision of the Navy Commissar N.G. Kuznetsov to the Order of the Red Banner of Battle, which was considered less prestigious; the K-21 never received the title of Guard. At the same time, the submarine was credited with the destruction of the destroyer Tirpitz (with its inclusion in the number of victories inscribed on the deckhouse of K-21), but was not included in the official lists of losses inflicted on the enemy.\nBy the afternoon of 6 July, the British naval command had already concluded that the K-21 raid was ineffective; later, the study of aerial reconnaissance data and the decoding of German communications intercepts reinforced this opinion, which was communicated to the Soviet side at its request.\n\n\n=== Between the fall of 1942 and the early 1960s ===\nIn early 1943, the Submarine Department of the USSR People's Commissariat of the Navy prepared a methodological document analysing the actions of Soviet submarines. Lunin's actions during the attack on Tirpitz were criticised, and the result of the attack was described as a \"minor combat success\". The document was distributed to fleets, command authorities and naval training establishments.\nFollowing the conclusion of the Second World War, a team of British specialists conducted an investigation into the hull of the battleship Tirpitz, which had been sunk by British aircraft in November 1944. A representative of the Shipbuilding Directorate of the USSR People's Commissariat of the Navy participated in this work at the invitation of the British side. The investigation revealed that no traces of repair work had been carried out to repair damage caused by torpedoes. Concurrently, the British provided the Soviets with an extract from the battleship's combat log, which made no mention of the K-21 attack. Nevertheless, the textbook for students and cadets of naval educational institutions, published in 1953–1954, reiterated the information that as a consequence of the attack, the Tirpitz was damaged and the destroyer was sunk.\nIn 1957, the French historian Cloade Ewan published an article in the magazine La Revue Maritime entitled \"Operation of the German Navy against the convoy PQ-17.\" One of the sections of the article was devoted to the attack of the K-21. Ewan relied on German documents and his correspondence with the participants of the operation from the German side to reach the conclusion that the attack was unsuccessful. In the same year, the article was translated into Russian and subsequently entered the library of the Historical Department of the General Staff of the USSR Navy. In 1959, the military-historical work The Navy of the Soviet Union in the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945, published under the \"secret\" cover, reached the conclusion that the attack of the K-21 ended in a miss, based on the analysis of the extract of the log of battleship combat operations and the examination of publications in the foreign press. At the same time in 1960, the first edition of the memoirs of Admiral Arseny Golovko, who commanded the Northern Fleet in 1942, was published. In this work, the attack was described in detail with reference to diary entries and claimed its success. Concurrently, the original diary entries of Golovko do not mention the K-21 attack. According to the memoirs of the admiral's relatives, the text of the memoirs was altered in preparation for printing without the author's consent.\n\n\n=== Between the early 1960s and the early 1990s ===\nFollowing the publication of Golovko's memoirs, a contradiction emerged within Soviet historiography between official sources intended for the elite and those intended for the masses. During the 1960s, there was no unified position, with various publications either citing the Sovinformburo report, mentioning the attack itself without assessing its result, or simply omitting any mention of the attack. In the 1966 publication by the Naval Academy teachers A. I. Kozlov and V. I. Kozlov and V. S. Shlomin, entitled The Northern Fleet, as well as in the 1969 textbook for higher naval schools, the authors asserted the ineffectiveness of the attack. The same conclusion was reached by the authors of the study Combat Activity of Submarines of the USSR Navy in the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945, published in 1969 under the cover of secrecy.\nIn 1968, the English writer D. Irving's work The Defeat of the PQ-17 Convoy was published in English. It was subsequently translated into Russian and published in the USSR in 1971. In the Russian edition, the book was subjected to selective edits, with a particular focus on the removal of a fragment in which the author expressed a critical attitude towards the results of the K-21 attack. In the same year, 1971, the first edition of Admiral N. G. Kuznetsov's memoirs was published, in which the submarine attack was mentioned, but the author refrained from assessing its results.\nV. S. Pikul's novel Requiem for Convoy PQ-17, the first edition of which was published in 1970, had a significant impact on the formation of public opinion on the discussed issue. The novel asserted the success of the attack and harshly criticised foreign historians, as well as suggesting that the combat log of the battleship Tirpitz had been falsified. Morozov and Skrynnikov posit that Pikul's novel gave rise to a kind of conspiracy current, whose adherents believe that the K-21 attack was successful and its denial is the result of a vast anti-Russian conspiracy. They further argue that Soviet official historiography since the mid-1970s has established the practice of mentioning the K-21 attack but not its result, under the influence of Pikul's novel. In 1991, the first part of K. Yuan's book, The Soviet Navy in the War, was published in Paris. In this work, the author attempted to reconstruct the scheme of the K-21 attack at the tactical level. However, due to the lack of access to Soviet archives, K. Yuan was constrained to rely on general data from open Soviet sources.\n\n\n=== Between the early 1990s and the late 2010s ===\nFollowing the dissolution of the USSR, Russian historiography initially continued the practice of Soviet historiography, including the K-21 attack without specifying its results. This information is presented in the three-volume edition Three Centuries of the Russian Navy 1696-1996. In 1997, Professor V. D. Dotsenko of the Naval Academy dedicated a separate chapter to the attack on K-21 in his work Myths and Legends of Russian Naval History, which was subsequently republished on multiple occasions. In this chapter, Professor Dotsenko noted several key facts regarding the attack, including the following: Despite the prevailing opinion that the attack on K-21 was unsuccessful, there is no evidence that the participants in the campaign, including members of the crew of the battleship Tirpitz, suffered any torpedo hits after returning to the base for repairs. He based this conclusion on the evidence presented. In 1999, A.V. Platonov, senior lecturer (later professor) at the Naval Academy, in his book Commanders of Soviet Submarines 1941-1945, also noted the failure of the attack and suggested that Lunin had either adjusted the distance of the torpedo launch or the timing of the explosions. The same year saw the publication of the book Lunin attacks the Tirpitz by K.M. Sergeev, who served on the K-21 from April 1943 to December 1944. In this edition, for the first time, extensive extracts from the log book of the K-21 and the recollections of eyewitnesses of the attack were published. The materials of the book were used in the 8-part TV series Convoy PQ-17 (K.M. Sergeev was one of the historical advisors of the series), released in 2004, which presented a version of the success of the K-21 attack.\nIn 2006, M. E. Morozov, Candidate of Historical Sciences, Head of the Department of the Institute of Military History of the Defence Ministry of the Russian Federation, published an appendix to the book Bismarck and Tirpitz Battleships by A. A. Malov and S. V. Patyanin. V. Patyanin's book Battleships Bismarck and Tirpitz contains an article devoted to the analysis of the K-21 attack. The author's analysis of the movement patterns of the Soviet submarine and German ships leads to the conclusion that the attack had no theoretical chance of success due to the excessive distance between the launching of the torpedoes and their maximum range of travel. In 2019, M. E. Morozov and N. R. Skrynnikov published a monograph on the attack, entitled The Unknown Attack of Commander Lunin. In this work, the authors analysed a large number of sources and performed a computer reconstruction of the attack. Their conclusions were as follows:\n\nFrom our point of view, on July 5, 1942, the following happened in the Barents Sea: despite all the efforts and courage of the crew of the \"K-21\", due to the imperfection of equipment, insufficient training of sailors (first of all, the boat commander), as well as objective difficulties that arose during the attack of a fast, well-protected ship formation, the torpedoes fired by the submarine did not hit anything. Instead of analyzing the reasons for the failure, it was followed, as has happened many times in our recent past, by declaring it a major victory.\n\n\n== Origin of explosions ==\nThe source of the detonations heard on K-21 remains uncertain. The German squadron did not conduct acoustic surveillance due to the ineffectiveness of such an operation when travelling at full speed, and no detonations were observed visually. German ships did not utilise depth charges. The calculations indicate that the torpedoes fired by K-21 could have reached the bottom (after which their detonation from impact with the rocky bottom was possible) at approximately 18:07-18:14. This is inconsistent with the recorded times of both the first two explosions at 18:04 and the subsequent rolling explosions at 18:25-18:27. Concurrently, there is a possibility that the torpedo launched from Torpedo Apparatus No. 8 could have reached the bottom much earlier, given that the submarine crew's report indicates that it was defective, leaking air.\nMorozov and Skrynnikov posit that the explosions recorded at 18:04 were most likely the result of an auditory aberration by one of the sailors. However, they do not rule out the possibility that one of the torpedoes exploded when it hit the bottom. Additionally, Morozov and Skrynnikov examined Lunin's reports on previous attacks, noting that, in general, he reported the sounds of torpedoes exploding after the attacks. In the overwhelming majority of cases, the German side's documents not only failed to record any losses, but also failed to record the fact of the attack itself. The case of the attack on 31 March 1942 is illustrative. K-21, under the command of Lunin, fired six torpedoes at \"the enemy transport of the type of German dry cargo ships \"Cordoba\" of 7400 tonns displacement\" from a distance of 2.2 miles. The commander did not observe the result of the attack, but recorded two explosions after 2 minutes and 56 seconds, which served as a sufficient reason for the higher command to confirm the success. However, German documents deny the presence of any ships in the area at the time in question.\nThe origin of the rolling explosions recorded at 18:25 and 18:27 is also unclear. One hypothesis suggests that they could be explained by German naval sappers detonating drifting or landed sea mines on the Norwegian coast. Another hypothesis suggests that they could be explained by a German aircraft attacking an imaginary target (a submarine). However, neither of these hypotheses has been substantiated by documentary evidence.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nСкрынников, Н.Р.; Морозов, М.Э. (2019).

        "content": "Rock and Read (stylized as ROCK AND READ, abbreviated to RR) is a Japanese music magazine, of Mook format, published bimonthly since 2004. Its publisher is Shinko Music Entertainment and its editor is Koji Yoshida, representing Axel Communications. It features long interviews with musicians mainly from the visual kei scene.\nIn 2004, the music magazine Band Yarouze ceased publication. Koji Yoshida, who had been editing it, launched Rock and Read in the same year, initially called Real Read and published independently. Previously, he had published a magazine called Read in 2003 as a separate version of Band Yarouze.\nYoshida aimed to create a magazine with the opposite concept: instead of several \"disorganized\" photographs, he wanted to create it in book format with long and in-depth interviews with artists exclusively from visual kei scene. He also said that he looks for interviewees who \"have had recent events or incidents\", and not because they \"have released a new record\".\nIn 2012, the first separate edition of Rock and Read was released, named Rock and Read eyes. It was created to have the opposite concept of RR, featuring more photos than text. Two years later, Idol and Read edition started publication, featuring Japanese idols.\nIn July 2017, the Rock and Read Band edition was created, focused on interviewing bands as a whole. In November, an edition of the magazine starring vocalists was launched, called Rock and Read Vocal.\nIn 2019, Rock and Read Girls featuring female artists was created. A edition with interviews with comedians, Owarai and Read, began serialization in 2021.\nIssue no. 39 featured a collaboration between Hitsugi (Nightmare) and designer and musician Tatsuya Ishii. Issue no. 100 had Kirito on the cover, as he was on the cover of the magazine's early edition, Read.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRock and Read magzines at Shinko Music Entertainment",

        "content": "Guido Faba (c. 1190 – c. 1245) was a notary, scribe and teacher of rhetoric from Bologna. At least eleven works are attributed to him, all on rhetoric, mainly the ars dictaminis (art of letter writing). Although he wrote mainly in Latin, two of his works contain advice for using vernacular Italian in formal settings.\n\n\n== Life ==\nGuido included a short autobiography of himself in the preface to his Rota nova in 1225–1226. It is the most improtant source for his life.\nGuido was born in Bologna in or shortly before 1190. His father's name was Niccolò. In some manuscripts of his work, he is called Guido de Lombardia. According to his own account, he received the nickname Faba as a child \"because of the effect of his antics\". It comes from the Latin expression fabas dicere, to be a jokester. It has, however, been suggested that he was related to Aliprando Faba, to whom he dedicated his Summa dictaminis.\n\nBy 1210, Guido had a master's degree. According to his autobiographical account, he took a two-year hiatus from his original studies at the University of Bologna:The malice of the adversary of old began to envy Guido's future wisdom and the service he would perform for humanity to such an extent that he had to abandon his literary studies in which he had achieved great proficiency, and descend to learning, in addition, the blacksmith's art. In this he had advanced for two years when he was recalled by three miracles from God.Ernst Kantorowicz interprets this passage as an allegory describing how Guido quit the humanities (literary studies or humanistic letter) to study law for two years before returning to his former studies. This probably took place in 1211–1213. For financial reasons, he became a notary, probably around 1216. He appears as a notary with the Bolognese delegation to the papal legate Ugo da Ostia at Viterbo in 1219–1220. In his autobiography, he describes his notarial turn allegorically as being \"handed over to the solace of the tanners\". He further claims that he served \"for two years as the scribe of the bishop of Bologna\", and this is confirmed by documents for the period 1221–1222 under Bishop Enrico della Fratta.\nDisappointed, according to his account, by the worldliness of the bishop's court, Guido returned to scholarly practice around 1223. Before 1225–1226, he became a teacher of rhetoric attached to the chapel of San Michele in Mercato di Mezzo, which he reorganized. At some point before 1227, Guido seems to have visited Rome and also served as a papal judge delegate. He took holy orders and in his works describes himself as a master (magister), chaplain (cappellanus), canon (canonicus), priest (sacerdos) and presbyter of San Michele.\nAugusto Gaudenzi proposed, on the basis of Guido's Parlamenta et epistole, that Guido relocated to Siena after 1239 for political reasons, being a Ghibelline. Guido died after 1243. Gaudenzi proposed that he died between 1245 and 1250, because in a manuscript from that period there is an obelus beside his name.\n\n\n== Works ==\n\n\n=== Dictaminal canon ===\nThe central canon of Guido's writings consists of six Latin works, all on rhetoric, often transmitted together.\n\nSumma dictaminis, written in 1228–1229 and dedicated to Aliprando Faba, is Guido's major theoretical work. An epitome is known under the title Summula de alto stilo, propter rudes et non vitiosos. The section listing 104 biblical sentences for use in exordia (introductions) was sometimes copied separately under the titles De sapientia Salomonis e De proverbiis Salomonis.\nDictamina rhetorica, written around 1226–1228, is a collection of 220 model letters for writing to everybody from a student to the emperor. It was highly influential.\nExordia, sometimes erroneously called Proverbia inter amicos et socios, is a collection of 330 suggested opening sentences for letters. It is divided into nine sections. In some manuscripts, each opening is given a corresponding continuatio, a sentence to connect the exordium (introduction) to the narratio (body). In other manuscript, the continuationes are separate. An Italian version of the Exordia is also known.\nArenge is a collection of model speeches for use by statesmen, judges, ambassadors and churchmen. It was written before 1240–1241, when a revised version with six additional long speeches appeared. An Italian version is also known.\nSumma de vitiis et virtutibus (also Tractatus de vitiis et virtutibus or Exordia de vitiis et virtutibus), written after the Exordia, is a collection of exordia and continuationes organized by the seven virtues and seven deadly sins. Each virtue or sin has six exordia. An Italian version of the Summa is known.\nPetitiones is a collection of model letters for supplications to the pope. Its date is uncertain. It is known from ten manuscripts.\n\n\n=== Minor and vernacular works ===\nGuido's other works all circulated much less widely, but the Gemma and Parlamenta are important in the history of the Italian language.\n\nGemma purpurea, written in Latin between 1239 and 1248, is a guide to letter writing, including technical and stylistic aspects and terms of address. It includes model exordia in both Latin and vernacular Italian, making it the earliest evidence for formal letter writing in the vernacular in Italy. There are nine complete manuscripts and two that omit the vernacular examples.\nParlamenta et epistole, written around 1242–1243 and generally considered Guido's last work, is another work that mixes Latin and the vernacular. It contains 26 model vernacular speeches (parlamenta), each accompanied by up to three Latin letters (epistole) for a total of 95 rhetorical models. Each chapter is designed for a given situation (e.g., a father to his son at university). The three Latin letters represent three different levels of \"rhetorical complexity\". The complete work is found in three manuscripts. In a concession to popular taste, Guido included one exchange of letters between Lent and Carnival—a popular allegorical genre at the time. It is found in one other manuscript.\nEpistole, written in 1239–1241, is a collection of Latin model letters preserved in a single manuscript.\nLibelli ecclesiastici, like the Petitiones, is a collection of model petition letters on ecclesiastical topics. It was written between 1226 and 1234.\nIn addition, an anonymous Proverbia, a collection of Latin proverbs in eighteen thematic chapters, has been attributed to Guido on the basis of its structure and the sole manuscript that preserves its, in which it immediately follows a copy of Guido's Arenge. Its date is uncertain.\n\n\n=== Rota nova and related works ===\nRota nova ('New Wheel'), written around 1225–1226 and preserved complete in a single manuscript (partially in three others), is an introductory Latin text on the art of letter writing. The long preface contains a short autobiography in the third person. The main body is divided in two sections, one on errors to avoid and the other on rules to follow. The title, a play on Boncompagno's Rota veneris ('Old Wheel'), refers to the wheel of fortune. Guido explains:It deserves to be called 'The New Wheel,' because, just as the status of anyone goes through many changes with the advent of something new, so through the aforesaid mutation Guido ascended from a lower to a higher position. And sitting enthroned in the seat of the wheel, he holds in his right hand two wings, which he received from the archangel [San Michele]. In one of these wings the vices of all letter writing are cut away, and in the other wing are contained the rules which constitute the knowledge of dictamen and of the ornate style ...The Rota nova probably represents the new curriculum Guido introduced at San Michele. The two parts of the text are called ala prima (first wing) and ala secunda (second wing). Each is introduced by a illustration.\nSeveral short works by Guido are found only in Oxford, New College Library, MS 255, the same manuscript containing the complete text of the Rota nova. They are \"supporting texts\", but have been treated as part of the Rota nove by the manuscript's editors.\n\nLittere stili secularis\nLittere prosaici dictaminis stili ecclesiastici\nLittera quam magister Guido Sancti Michaelis Bononie misit scolaribus in suo principio, et lecta fuit per omnes scolas\nInvectiva magistri contra scolares malitiosos et tenaces\nLittera carnisprivii contra quadragesimam adversariam suam, a letter from Carnival to his adversary Lent\nInvectiva quadragesime contra carnisprivium inimicum suum, a letter from Lent to his enemy Carnival\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Editions ===\n\n\n=== Secondary literature ===",

        "content": "Urceolus alenizini (alternatively spelt alenizinii) is a species of flagellates. It was described by Konstantin Mereschkowsky in 1877 as the type species of the genus Urceolus. It is a rare species only recorded by its author once in the White Sea, in northern Russia. It is distinguished by other members of the genus by the lack of spiral stripes in its cell surface.\n\n\n== Description ==\nUrceolus alenizini is a species of flagellates, single-celled protists that have flagella for movement. Members of the genus Urceolus are distinguished by the presence of a 'neck' at the anterior end of their oval-shaped cell, followed by a wide aperture or 'mouth' into a deep canal where the feeding groove and the flagellum originate. Like other euglenids, their pellicle is composed of stripes that run spirally along the surface. However, this particular species, U. alenizini, is distinguished from other species of the genus because it lacks said spiralling stripes, and presents a smooth cell surface instead. In addition, it has a cylindrical neck with margins abruptly truncated, not turned outward as in other species such as U. cyclostomus. The author of the species, Konstantin Mereschkowsky, measured the cell size as 0.039’’’ in length, and 0.024’’’ at the greatest width, without using any symbol of the metric system.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe species Urceolus alenizini was described by Russian biologist Konstantin Mereschkowsky, in a memoir on the protozoa found in northern Russia published in 1877, later translated into German in 1879. It was described from a rare flagellate seen only once by Mereschkowsky in the White Sea, near the Solovetsky Monastery, distinguished by the unique neck-shaped anterior end of the cell. As the first species of the genus Urceolus, it became its type species.\nThe generic name Urceolus, from Latin  urceolus 'pitcher', references the flask or pitcher-shaped cells. The specific epithet alenizini is named in honour of an individual named Woldemar Alenizin, referred by Mereschkowsky as \"highly respected\". In later publications and electronic sources such as AlgaeBase, the epithet appears written as alenizinii instead.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Atheris acuminata, the acuminate bush viper, is an arboreal species of viper found in Western Uganda, closely related to the viper species Atheris hispida. The species gets the name 'acuminate' and 'acuminata' from the long dorsal scales on the back of its head and the front half of its body, which present as long hollow curves which thin to a sharp point. As with all vipers, A. acuminata is venomous.\n\n\n== Description ==\nAtheris acuminata is distinguished from A. hispida by its pentagonal rostral shield with its two large suprarostrals (of which the A. hispida has three), its enlarged frontal shield, its five interorbitals (of which the A. hispida has 6–10), six supralabials (of which A. hispida has 7-10) and its acuminate spines which go down to its midbody (while A. hispida only has them on its head and neck).\nAside from distinguishing it from A. hispida, A. acuminata has 3 internasals, 10 maximum transverse head scales, 11 or 12 circumorbital scales, no interoculabials, 1 interocunasal, 7 or 8 infralabials and 1 pair of sublinguals.\n\n\n== Reproduction ==\nAtheris acuminata is ovoviviparous.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nAtheris acuminata is found in the trees of a forest near Nsere Lodge within Kyambura Game Reserve, Ankole District, Western Uganda\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "İbrahim Kafesoğlu (1914–1984) was a Turkish historian and academic who is known for his role in the development of the Turkish–Islamic synthesis. He was a faculty member of Istanbul University and Atatürk University. He cofounded the conservative think thank Intellectuals' Hearth and was its president from 1970 and 1974. \n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nHe was born in Tefenni, Burdur, in January 1914. His father was killed in the East front in World War I.\nHe graduated from the Teachers' College, Izmir, in 1932. He started his master's degree at Ankara University in 1936 completing his studies in Hungarology, medieval history and Turkish Language at the Faculty of Language, History and Geography. He was sent to Budapest for his Ph.D. studies, but he could not complete the program due to World War II. He managed to return Turkey in April 1945. After working at Ankara University for a brief period he continued his studies at Istanbul University where he obtained his Ph.D. in 1949. His thesis was entitled Büyük Selçuklu Sultanı Melikşah (Turkish: Malik Shah, Sultan of the Seljuk Empire), and his advisor was Mükrimin Halil Yinanç. \nHis notable teachers at Ankara University and Istanbul University included Fuat Köprülü, Zeki Velidi Togan, Sadri Maksudi Arsal and Reşit Rahmeti Arat.\n\n\n== Career and activities ==\nKafesoğlu was promoted to associate professor in 1953. He was the chair of the History Department at Istanbul University between 1954 and 1955. Then he joined Atatürk University where he worked until 1962. He became a full professor of history in 1962 at Istanbul University and served as the chair of the Department of General Turkish History from 1970 to January 1983 when he retired from his teaching post. Kafesoğlu succeeded Zeki Velidi Togan as the chair of the department.\nKafesoğlu served as the undersecretary of culture in the Prime Ministry and was a member of the advisory board at the Ministry of Culture. He was made a member of the Turkish Historical Society in 1983.\nKafesoğlu was the founding president of the IH and held the post from May 1970 to 30 January 1974. He was succeeded by Süleyman Yalçın in the post.\n\n\n=== Work and views ===\nKafesoğlu published various books on history of the Seljuk Empire and Pre-Islamic Turkish history and culture. He also published a book on the Turkish–Islamic synthesis in 1985. He contributed a nationalist conservative magazine entitled Turkish Culture (Turkish: Türk Kültürü) and shaped its ideology.\nKafesoğlu was the major ideologue of the IH and had a significant role in the formulation of the Turkish–Islamic synthesis. For him Islam is a matter of conscience and does not a political or legal system. He stated that a state ruled in accordance with the Islamic principles is not consistent with Turkish traditions. To support his position Kafesoğlu added \"Turks never founded an Islamic State because Turks kept their pre-Islamic Turkish understanding of sovereignty, social rights, and toleration in religious life, land regime and the military character for their states.\" For Kafesoğlu \"Turkish nationalism is not racism, but it is not about a religious cause either.\"\nKafesoğlu argued that the necessity condition for the scientific advancement and the welfare of people in Turkey was the enrichment of national culture. He opposed humanism regarding it as a threat on the grounds that it was not compatible with national culture and that it was a Western idea.\nKafesoğlu described Turkish youth as \"the bearer of a 4000-year-old history\" and \"the representative of a long and glorious struggle.\" He also developed a definition of intellectuals stating \"Obviously, we do not regard those who turn their backs to liberty and scorn national mores as intellectuals.\"\n\n\n== Personal life and death ==\nKafesoğlu married Müzeyyen Hanım in 1946 and had three children from this marriage. He was fluent in Hungarian, English, French, German, Persian and Arabic.\nKafesoğlu died in Istanbul on 18 August 1984 and was buried in Edirnekapı Martyr's Cemetery.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"The Peace\" (German: Der Friede. Ein Wort an die Jugend Europas. Ein Wort an die Jugend der Welt, lit. 'The Peace: A Word to the Youth of Europe: A Word to the Youth of the World') is an essay by the German writer Ernst Jünger. It was intended for Allied readers in the event of a German rebellion against the Nazi Party during World War II. It lays out a peace proposal and further visions that involve the creation of a European federation, which could take inspiration from Switzerland and the United States. Similarly to Novalis in Christianity or Europe, Jünger argued that serious engagement with theology is more important than a constitution for upholding peace in Europe.\nThe text marked Jünger's last direct involvement in political life. According to his diaries, he finished the final revisions on 9 November 1943. Illegal typescripts of the text circulated in Germany toward the end of the war. Unofficial prints were created from 1945 until the first authorised version was published by Verlag Die Argonauten in Amsterdam in 1948.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "UGC 1775 or Arp 10 is a ring galaxy in the constellation Cetus. The galaxy lies about 400 million light years away from Earth, which means, given its apparent dimensions, that UGC 1775 is approximately 220,000 light years across. The galaxy is included in Halton Arp's Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies in the galaxies with split arms category.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nThe galaxy features a bright ring with a faint bar. Its nucleus is off-centre and it is surrounded by a bright ring of HII regions where new stars are formed. One fainter outer ring or shell also hosts a faint arc of HII regions. The hydrogen emission of the galaxy shows a large disturbed hydrogen disk extending for 2.7 times the optical diameter of the galaxy and features shells. The galaxy has a high star formation rate, which was estimated based on the H-alpha emission to be 5.4 M☉ per year, while based on the infrared luminosity, it is 11.2 M☉ per year. The mid-infrared emission is associated with the nucleus and the star forming regions of the ring.\nThe ring is considered to have been created by another galaxy passing through the disk of the galaxy near its centre about 85 million years ago. As there are no similar mass galaxies visible in the vicinity of UGC 1775 it has been proposed that the non-linear kinematics of the gas in the galaxy are the result of the accretion of a smaller galaxy by a gas-rich spiral galaxy. However more detailed observations indicate that the smaller galaxy is visible as a knot next to the nucleus of the main galaxy. Another small galaxy lying along the minor axis of the galaxy is a background object.\nThe galaxy is seen nearly face-on, at an inclination of 22 degrees.\n\n\n== Supernova ==\nOne supernova has been observed in UGC 1775, SN 2000dx. SN 2000dx was a type Ia supernova discovered a few days before maximum located 7\".9 east and 12\".3 south of the\nnucleus of UGC 1775. It had an apparent magnitude of 17.1 to 17.3 upon discovery.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nUGC 1775 on WikiSky: DSS2, SDSS, GALEX, IRAS, Hydrogen α, X-Ray, Astrophoto, Sky Map, Articles and images",

        "content": "Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) is a benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of language models. It consists of about 16,000 multiple-choice questions spanning 57 academic subjects including mathematics, philosophy, law and medicine. It is one of the most commonly used benchmarks for comparing the capabilities of large language models.\nThe MMLU was released by a team of researchers in 2020 and was designed to be more challenging than then-existing benchmarks such as GLUE (2018) on which new language models were achieving better-than-human accuracy. At the time of the MMLU's release, most existing language models performed around the level of random chance (25%), with the best performing GPT-3 model achieving 43.9% accuracy. The developers of the MMLU estimate that human domain-experts achieve around 89.8% accuracy. As of 2024, some of the most powerful language models, such as Claude 3 and GPT-4, were reported to achieve scores in the mid-80s. Google's Gemini Ultra model achieved a score of 90%, the highest yet recorded.\n\n\n== Examples ==\nThe following examples are taken from the \"Abstract Algebra\" and \"International Law\" tasks, respectively.

        "content": "Morning in America is a vinyl and download only EP by American rock band Mudhoney, released on September 20, 2019, by Sub Pop. It contains tracks recorded during the sessions for 2018's Digital Garbage, but not included on that album, plus a couple completed at a later time.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAlthough guitarist Steve Turner has described Morning in America as an \"EP of leftovers\" from the Digital Garbage sessions, singer Mark Arm don't feel the tracks are lesser songs necessarily; \"they're just songs that for whatever reason didn't make the record,\" he said in 2023. \"There are some that could have been swapped out for songs based on feel.\"\nThe album title alludes to a television commercial, known for its opening line, \"It's morning again in America.\" The ad was part of the Ronald Reagan 1984 presidential campaign.\n\n\n== Content ==\n\"Vortex of Lies\" and \"Ensam I Natt\" were previously released in 2018 on a limited edition European tour single. \"Ensam I Natt\", which translates to \"Lonely Tonight\", is a cover of Swedish rock band the Leather Nun with lyrics translated in English. \"One Bad Actor\" was previously released as a 2018 limited edition split single with fellow Sub Pop label mates Hot Snakes. \"Creeps Are Everywhere\", \"Morning in America\" and \"Snake Oil Charmer\" are previously unreleased, while \"Let's Kill Yourself Live Again\" is an alternate version of the Digital Garbage track \"Kill Yourself Live,\" and was previously released as the bonus track for the Japanese CD edition of that album.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nIn his updated edition of the book Mudhoney: The Sound and the Fury from Seattle, Keith Cameron writes that together with Digital Garbage, the EP \"offered a scathing eco-political health check while retaining all the elements one could want from Mudhoney: rowdy riffs, heroic yowl, frequent outbreaks of bad taste.\" Brad Cohan, writing for Bandcamp Daily, felt that the vibe on Morning in America, specifically on tracks such as \"Vortex of Lies,\" \"Morning in America\" and \"One Bad Actor,\" \"lurches and grinds with stoner rock mettle, a Stooges-like wah-wah slow burn that's been creeping into the Mudhoney sound since 2002's Since We've Become Translucent.\"\nThe Arts Desk's Guy Oddy called the music \"magnificent throughout,\" writing that \"the genesis of Morning in America may have emerged from the leftovers of Mudhoney's previous album but it is a record with plenty of the zest and boisterousness, saturated in black humour, that we've come to expect from Mark Arm's crew.\" Mark Deming of AllMusic wrote, \"this music sounds as fierce and committed as anything Mudhoney ever committed to plastic,\" while ClashMusic's Will Fitzpatrick described it as \"wilder, punkier and even funnier\" than Digital Garbage.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nAdapted from the album liner notes.\n\nMudhoney\nMark Arm – vocals, guitar\nSteve Turner – guitar, vocals\nDan Peters – drums, percussion, vocals\nGuy Maddison – bass, synthesizer, vocals\nAdditional personnel\nJohnny Sangster – piano, vocals, producer, engineer, mixing\nJon Roberts – engineer\nBob Weston – mastering\nDusty Summers – art direction, design\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Zhrebchevo Reservoir (Bulgarian: Язовир Жребчево) is a large dam and reservoir in central Bulgaria, situated between the Sub-Balkan valleys of Kazanlak and Tvarditsa that lie between the Balkan Mountains to the north and the Sredna Gora mountain range to the south. Administratively the reservoir is located in the municipalities of Gurkovo and Nikolaevo of Stara Zagora Province and Tvarditsa and Nova Zagora of Sliven Province. Close to its shores are the towns of Gurkovo and Nikolaevo, as well as the villages of Panicherevo, Banya and Asenovets.\n\n\n== History and geography ==\nThe dam was constructed between 1959 and 1966 on the river Tundzha, the longest tributary of the Maritsa. Its main purpose is to level the river discharge and to provide water for irrigation in the northeastern parts of the Upper Thracian Plain, as well as to the Sliven Valley and Yambol Field. Part of the water is used for industrial water supply. Zhrebchevo Reservoir is owned by the state company \"Irrigation Systems\". The reservoir has an area of 25 km2 and a volume of 400 million m3.\nIn the dam wall is located the small Zhrebchevo Hydro Power Plant with installed capacity of 15.4 MW, powered with two Francis turbines. On average the power plant processes 332 million m3 of water and produces 32.6 GWh annually. It is owned by Minstroy Holding JSC.\n\n\n== Landmarks and fishing ==\nZhrebchevo Reservoir flooded the former villages of Zhrebchevo, Zapalnya and Dolno Panicherevo. In its northeastern part are located the semi-submerged ruins of the 19th century Church of St John of Rila, the only remaining structure of Zapalnya. The iconostasis, the bell and part of the inventory were moved to churches in nearby villages. The church is accessible for a walk in summer, when the water level drops.\nDue to its irregular shape, the reservoir has many arms and inlets with convenient fishing spots. It is rich in native fish species, such as European perch, zander, wels catfish, northern pike, Eurasian carp, crucian carp, Prussian carp, Common bream, Danube bleak, common rudd, etc., as wells as alloctonous ones like grass carp.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\nГеоргиев (Georgiev), Владимир (Vladimir) (1981).

        "content": "A hotend is a component used in fused filament deposition 3D printers. Its purpose is to heat up and melt filament material for depositing into the intended shape.\nThe hotend is usually made of a bulk heat-conductive material with an internal resistive heater, coupled with a thermistor for precise temperature control. In common desktop 3D printer designs, the heater is located near the nozzle, and a heatsink is attached upstream (on the colder side). A heat break component made of dissimilar metals can be used to limit heat transfer to filament above, increasing the controllability of the melted filament.\n\n\n== Nozzle ==\nThe nozzle is an interchangeable tip attached to the hotend with a small diameter hole through which the melted filament is extruded. In desktop fused filament deposition printers, different sized nozzle holes can be used to balance between printing speed and precision. Common large sized ones (1.0mm) extrude more material per travel length whereas smaller sized nozzles (0.2mm) result in higher quality.\nIn consumer desktop printers, the nozzle is often made of brass or stainless steel. Desired characteristics include abrasion resistance, as the nozzle frequently slides across the printed object, and thermal conductivity. To improve thermal conductivity, nozzles can be perforated with multiple holes on the intake side, forming an internal structure with more contact area between the heated nozzle body and the filament. This results in a higher maximum volumetric flow, which can improve printing speed.\n\n\n== See also ==\n3D printer extruder\n\n\n== References ==",

The KNA was formed as the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army (DKBA) in December 1994 after the insurgent group split off of the Karen National Liberation Army. Shortly after, the DKBA signed a ceasefire agreement with the Myanmar Army, officially joining the army as the Karen Border Guard Force (Karen BGF) alongside the Karen Peace Force in 2009. In January 2024, after intensified rebel operations throughout Myanmar, the Karen BGF began distancing itself from the ruling military junta, eventually splitting off from the Army and rebranding themselves the \"Karen National Army\" by April.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== DKBA ===\n\n\n=== Karen BGF ===\n\n\n== Tensions with Junta & Rebranding ==\n\nAfter splitting away from the Tatmadaw, the KNA acquires revenue via taxation of gambling and scam businesses in Shwe Kokko.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The University of North Texas (UNT) is a public research university in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. UNT's main campus is in Denton, Texas, and it also has a satellite campus in Frisco, Texas. It offers 114 bachelor's, 97 master's, and 39 doctoral degree programs. UNT is the flagship member of the University of North Texas System, which includes additional universities in Dallas and Fort Worth.\nUNT offers 112 bachelor's, 94 master's, and 38 doctorate degree programs as of 2024. These are organized into  14 colleges and schools. UNT has been accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools since 1924. As of 2020, the university was home to 37 research centers and institutes.\n\n\n== Fourteen colleges and schools ==\n\n\n=== College of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences ===\nThe College of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences houses 22 academic departments and programs and five public services (including a psychology clinic and a speech and hearing clinic), and eight student services (of which seven are labs).\n\n\n=== College of Science ===\nUNT has been offering Bachelor of Science degrees for 106 years, Master of Science degrees (in biology, mathematics, chemistry, and economics) for 88 years, and Doctor of Philosophy degrees in several scientific disciplines—including chemistry, biology, and physics—for 59 years. UNT is a sponsoring institution member (Ph.D.-granting) of Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU), a consortium of 105 major research universities that leverage scientific research through partnerships with national laboratories, government agencies, and private industry. It has been a member of the consortium since 1954.\n\n\n=== G. Brint Ryan College of Business ===\n\nThe College of Business is host to five academic departments: (i) Accounting, (ii) Finance, Insurance, Real Estate and Law, (iii) Information Technology and Decision Sciences, (iv) Marketing, Logistics, and Operations Management (v) Management. It offers seven undergraduate programs, fourteen M.B.A. and master of science programs, and six Ph.D. programs. In Fall 2011, the college moved into a new state-of-the-art Gold LEED certified $70 million facility named the Business Leadership Building. The college is accredited in both business and accounting by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business—accreditation for the former stretches back sixty-two years (1961) and the latter, thirty-six years (1987).\nThe college of business was renamed in 2019 to the G. Brint Ryan College of Business following a gift from alumnus G. Brint Ryan, alumnus and UNT System Board of Regents Chairman. The $30 million gift awarded by Ryan and his wife Amanda will create at least six endowed chairs and provide funding for academic program initiatives over seven years. Among the areas of focus are taxation and tax research, entrepreneurship, finance, logistics, information technology, cybersecurity and behavioral accounting.\nIn 2018, 5,093 students were enrolled as business majors at the undergraduate level.\nIn 2018, 691 students were working on graduate degrees. The college is host to two research centers (ii) the Institute of Petroleum Accounting and (iii) the Murphy Center for Entrepreneurship. U.S. News & World Report's \"2021 Best Online Programs\" ranked UNT 31st in the nation among the Best Online Graduate Business Programs.\n\n\n=== College of Education ===\nThe College of Education is a legacy of the university's founding as a teachers college one hundred and thirty-three years ago. The college is organized as four departments and one center: (i) Counseling and Higher Education, (ii) Educational Psychology, (iii) Kinesiology, Health Promotion and Recreation, (iv) Teacher Education and Administration, and (v) The Kristin Farmer Autism Center. The college offers 12 bachelor's degrees, 19 master's degrees and 15 doctoral concentrations. As of the 2010–2011 school year, the college certified over 1,147 teachers, the second largest number in the state by a university. In 1979, the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board approved renaming the \"School of Education\" to the \"College of Education.\"  At that time, the college was the largest in Texas and the Southwest, the largest doctoral program in the state, and the twenty-fifth largest producer of teacher certificates in the United States. Its prior name, \"School of Education,\" dates back to 1946, when the teachers college outgrew itself and reorganized as six schools and colleges.\n\n\n=== College of Engineering ===\n\nThe College of Engineering was founded in 2003, and is host to three research centers, one of which being the Net-Centric Software and Systems Center (launched February 24, 2009), a research consortium hosted by UNT and organized as a National Science Foundation Industry-University Cooperative Research Center (NSF I/UCRC). It is primarily funded by industry members (which as of 2012 consist of 16 corporations) and universities (which as of 2012 consist of 5). The focus is developing computing models for the future—models that go beyond applications with preordained fixed capabilities—models capable of services that are dynamically created, verified, and validated in the field and on the fly.\n\n\n=== College of Information ===\nThe College of Information was created in October 2008 by consolidating two existing academic units: Learning Technologies (formerly within the College of Education) and the School of Library and Information Sciences. The School of Library and Information Services was created in 1970 as an outgrowth of its former structure as the Department of Library Services. The college sponsors three research centers, one being The Texas Center for Digital Knowledge.\n\n\n=== College of Merchandising, Hospitality and Tourism ===\nThe College of Merchandising, Hospitality and Tourism houses the largest merchandising program in the nation and one of the largest hospitality and tourism management programs. The college offers bachelor's degrees with majors in digital retailing, home furnishings merchandising, hospitality management, event design & experience management, and merchandising, and master's degrees in hospitality management, international sustainable tourism and merchandising. It has the nation's first bachelor's in digital retailing and master's in international sustainable tourism. The college was formerly known as the School of Merchandising and Hospitality Management.\n\n\n=== College of Music ===\n\nThe College of Music is a comprehensive institution of international rank. Its heritage dates back one hundred and thirty-three years, when North Texas was founded. The college has the largest enrollment of any music institution accredited by the National Association of Schools of Music. It has been among the largest music institutions of higher learning in North America since the 1940s. The music library, founded in 1941, has one of the largest music collections in the United States, with over 300,000 volumes of books, periodicals, scores, and approximately 900,000 sound recordings. North Texas was first in the world to offer a degree in jazz studies. U.S. News & World Report ranked the jazz studies program as the best in the country every year from 1994, when it began ranking graduate jazz programs, to 1997, when it retired the category. The One O'Clock Lab Band has been nominated for 7 Grammy Awards.\n\n\n=== College of Health and Public Service ===\nPreviously called the College of Public Affairs and Community Service (PACS) and before that the College of Community Service, the college adopted its current name in Fall 2017. The college is organized in seven departments: Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology; Behavior Analysis; Criminal Justice; Emergency Management and Disaster Science; Public Administration; Rehabilitation and Health Services; and Social Work.\nThe department of public administration is home of the nation's first comprehensive degree program in emergency and disaster management that launched in 1983. The degree incorporates interdisciplinary curricula from other colleges that include applied philosophy and environmental ethics. The degree is tailored for both management practitioners and researchers and is collaborative with the Federal Emergency Management Agency Region VI—based in Denton—which oversees Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. Denton became home to FEMA when its predecessor, the Office of Civil Defense and Mobilization, constructed the nation's first Federal underground defense center in 1959.\nThe college is host to five research institutes, one being the Turkish Institute for Police Studies (TIPS). The institute has, since its founding in 1999, been based at North Texas. Its institution is a collaboration between the Turkish National Police (TNP) and U.S. universities in areas of terrorism, organized crime, narcotics, administration, intelligence, and investigation.\nUNT and Texas Women's University began a joint Master of Social Work (M.S.W.) program in 2017.\n\n\n=== College of Visual Arts and Design ===\nThe College of Visual Arts and Design has the 10th largest enrollment of any art and design school accredited by the National Association of Schools of Art and Design, and the second largest of any that awards doctorates. The college name changes reflect the curricular expansion of programs. In 1992, what then had been the \"Department of Art\" within the College of Arts and Sciences, became \"School of Visual Arts;\" and in 2007, it became the \"College of Visual Arts and Design.\" Art classes began at UNT in 1894, four years after its founding. Master's degrees were initiated in the 1930s and the first Master of Science degree in art was awarded in 1937. Since 1972, the college has served as curator and custodian of the Texas Fashion Collection that was started by Stanley Marcus in 1938.\n\n\n=== Honors College ===\nThe Honors College offers academic enrichments, including honors seminars and exclusive classes for high-achieving undergraduates. Its objective is to challenge exceptional students at higher levels and to promote leadership. The college is an autonomous collegiate unit on equal footing with the other collegiate units. Academically, it offers no degrees; but its courses are integrated with the baccalaureate programs of the other ten constituent colleges and the journalism school. Graduates are awarded a special medallion.\n\n\n=== Mayborn School of Journalism ===\nCurricular journalism at North Texas dates back to 1945. As a department, Journalism eventually became part of the College of Arts and Sciences. The Graduate Division of Journalism began in the fall of 1970 under the direction of Reginald Conway Westmorland. In 1999, twelve years after the death of Frank W. Mayborn, its graduate program was renamed the Frank W. Mayborn Graduate Institute of Journalism. On September 1, 2009, the entire program was elevated as its own collegiate unit and named the Frank W. and Sue Mayborn School of Journalism. Eight Pulitzer Prizes have been won by five of its alumni, among whom are Bill Moyers and Howard Swindle. Other notable alumni include Samir Husni and Cragg Hines. Since 1969, the news-editorial sequence has been accredited by the Accrediting Council on Education in Journalism and Mass Communications; and since 1986, the entire program has been accredited. The school is in its nineteenth year as founding host of the annual Mayborn Literary Nonfiction Conference.\nVirginia Ellison (née Virginia Jones Paty; 1920–2009)—a North Texas alumna (BA, English, '41) who also taught English and journalism, sponsored the Student Press Club, and served as director of publicity at North Texas from 1942 to 1944—won a Pulitzer Traveling Fellowship in 1945, the year she earned a degree from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism.\n\n\n=== Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science ===\n\nTAMS is a two-year residential early college entrance program that has, since 1987, served exceptionally qualified Texas students who otherwise would be attending high school as juniors and seniors. It was the first of its kind in the nation and, as of 2012, the only in the state and one of five in the nation.\n\n\n=== Toulouse Graduate School ===\nThe Toulouse Graduate School, founded seventy-seven years ago, is the academic custodian and administrator of all graduate programs offered by nine colleges and one school. It maintains records, administers admissions, and serves various roles in recruiting. It was renamed in 1990 in honor of Robert Bartell Toulouse, EdD (1918–2017), who joined in 1948 as a professor in the College of Education, then served dean of the Graduate School from 1954 to 1982. Toulouse, before retiring as professor emeritus, had served other roles at the university, including provost and vice president of academic affairs from 1982 to 1985.\n\n\n== Libraries ==\n\nUNT Libraries are made up of four public service points and two remote storage facilities. Willis Library is the main library on campus, housing the business, economics, education, humanities and social sciences collections along with microforms and special areas such as the Music Library, Government Documents, the Digital Library Division, Archives, and the Rare Book and Texana collections. The Media Library in Chilton Hall houses a large collection of audiovisual materials, including films, audiobooks, and video games (see Game Design, above). Video recording equipment and gaming consoles are available for checkout. The Sycamore Library houses the government documents, law, political science, geography and business collections. It also houses the Collaboration and Learning Commons, a place to study in groups, create multi-media projects, and record presentations. The Discovery Park Library supports the College of Engineering and the College of Information, Library Science, and Technologies. It covers multiple areas of engineering, library and information science, and learning technology.\n\n\n== The Intensive English Language Institute (IELI) ==\nEstablished in 1977, IELI is the largest intensive English program (IEP) in North Texas, serving international students who wish to learn academic English in preparation for university studies in the United States. IELI is a constituent of UNT International Affairs, an interdisciplinary unit and exponent of globalization in higher education that provides leadership and support of international teaching, research, and study-abroad initiatives. As of July 2015, IELI has been located in Marquis Hall on the UNT Denton campus.\n\n\n== References ==",

It was released in 2003 by Anne Carrière.\nThis novel depicts the dreams of emigration of young Senegalese people to France.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn Strasbourg, the narrator must inform her half-brother Madické on the telephone of the progress of the football matches of the Italian national team which he cannot follow on television on the island of Niodior, off the coast of Senegal. He plans to come to France to become a famous and rich footballer, identifying with some brilliant Senegalese playing in French clubs.\nThe book is an incessant back and forth between Senegal and France, where the narrator uncompromisingly describes the situation faced by immigrants who quickly become illegal, facing racism and threats of expulsion, \nShe is clear eyed with her village of origin, where illiteracy, the situation of women, the power of marabouts, the tendency to demand everything from those who have expatriated, are discussed openly. Likewise, colonial inequality is underlined between the French who can do tourism in Senegal without a visa, and the Senegalese for whom obtaining a visa for France is a journey strewn with difficultiesl..\n\n\n== Themes ==\nFrance represents paradise for the people of Niodior.\nFatou Diome's work describes the question of identity, divided between France and Senegal.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nDiome, F.

        "content": "The The Poor of Poland (Polish: Biedota Polska, BP) was a Polish political party founded on 31 May 2001 in Zgierz. It was founded shortly before the 2001 Polish parliamentary election, which it decided to participate in. The party became a part of the political coalition Alternative Social Movement. The Alternative Social Movement was composed of 37 parties, trade unions and associations in total, with the total number of members amounting to 500,000. In the 2001 election that took place in September, the coalition won 54,266 votes for the Sejm, which amounted to 0.42% of the total popular vote. After the election, the Alternative Social Movement was re-registered as a far-left, socialist party Polish Labour Party - August 80, which The Poor of Poland became a part of. However, officially the party did not dissolve until the next year, in August 2002.\nThe main goal of the party was to represent the interests of the poorest and weakest groups of the Polish society. As a sign of protest against high membership fees for mainstream parties, its monthly membership fee was between 1 PLN and 2 PLN, with particularly impoverished members having no obligation to pay for their membership at all. The Poor of Poland believed that the priority of public governments was to create more workplaces. Apart from that, it had a utopian program which argued that the elimination of poverty is possible. It was ideologically left-wing and opposed austerity measures as well as capitalism, which it saw as the main reason behind wealth inequality and poverty. The party eventually became a part of the Polish Labour Party - August 80, which has a radically socialist, anti-liberal and anti-capitalist program.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe party was created out of a local anti-poverty protest movement in Łódź Voivodeship that was active in small towns of Zgierz and Skierniewice. It was then registered on 31 May 2001 as The Poor of Poland, having gained signatures and support of over 1000 people. At the time of its founding, it was reported to have 15 members.\nThe small town of Zgierz was chosen as the headquarters of the party. In its declaraton, the chairwoman of the party Ewa Majkowska stated that it would defend the interests of the poorest parts of Polish society. The Poor of Poland then focused on attracting new members and creating subdivisions in other voivodeships. The party attracted attention through its protest against membership fees in mainstream parties - the membership fee in The Poor of Poland was nominal and amounted to between 1 PLN and 2 PLN a month, with particularly poor party members having no obligation to pay the fee at all.\nIn August 2001, the party joined the electoral coalition Alternative Social Movement. The Alternative Social Movement was composed of several parties and trade unions, and had a contradictory ideological nature as it included both Catholic nationalists as well as left-wing nationalists. The ideological common ground of its members was however the opposition to the centre-right government of Jerzy Buzek and his Solidarity Electoral Action. The coalition attacked neoliberal reforms of Buzek such as privatization and austerity measures, and called for his resignation.\nThe Alternative Social Movement was temporarily deregistered by the National Electoral Commission in August 2001, citing legal irregularities. The leadership of the coalition claimed that the deregistration of the coalition was an attempt by the Solidarity Electoral Action to suppress its political opponents, an accusation that was extensively circulated by the press.\nThe coalition was re-registered on 14 August 2001, as the Supreme Court of Poland annulled the decision of the National Electoral Commission, finding no irregularities that would prevent the Alternative Social Movement from registering itself and registering its own electoral committee for the 2001 Polish election. The 14 August was also the last day in which political parties could register their electoral committees for the upcoming election, meaning that the Alternative Social Movement only had 9 hours to do so.\nBy the time of its registration, the Alternative Social Movement was composed of 37 parties, trade unions and associations in total, and had a total membership count of 500,000. It presented itself as a movement for impoverished, frustrated and dissatisfied voters, and cooperated with steelworkers and mining unions, including individual groups of striking workers. It also opposed Polish membership in the European Union, arguing that Poland would be outcompeted by Western economies and that the European Union and its neoliberal free market would aggravate wealth inequality in Poland.\nIn July 2001, during the 2001 Polish floods, the MPs of the Alternative Socialist Movement donated their deputy salaries to flood victims. One of the leaders of the coalition, Mariusz Olszewski, also set up a special telephone line to coordinate transport of aid to the flood victims. The telephone line was run by the members of the party and would pick up aid packages from those who wanted to help the flood victims but had no time or were located too far away to do so in person.\nThe main ideological points of the coalition were agreed to be opposition to the United States and the European Union and their policies, as well as Catholic nationalism and left-wing nationalism. However, as the 2001 continued, the coalition would become increasingly left-wing, and the 'national left' faction represented by trade unions as well as The Poor of Poland, would establish a dominating role within the Alternative Social Movement.\nFor the 2001 Polish parliamentary election, the Alternative Social Movement fielded 865 candidates for the Sejm and 11 candidates for the Senate. Overwhelming majority of the candidates belonged to left-wing trade unions such as August '80, whereas 9 candidates for the Sejm were members of the Poor of Poland.\nThe election was held on 23 September 2001, and the Alternative Social Movement received 54,266 votes, or 0.42%, and did not receive any parliamentary seats. After the election, the Alternative Social Movement became re-registered as a political party Polish Labour Party - August 80, which The Poor of Poland also became a part of. The new party is far-left, heavily based on trade unions, and is ideologically socialist, anti-capitalist and anti-liberal; it also reappropiated some of the rhetoric of the Alternative Social Movement, such as its opposition to the European Union and the United States.\nDespite being formally a part of the Polish Labour Party - August 80 since November 2001, The Poor of Poland still existed as a stand-alone party. It was deregistered 9 months later, on 12 August 2002.\n\n\n== Election results ==\n\n\n=== Sejm ===\n\n\n=== Senate ===\n\n\n== Ideology ==\nThe Poor of Poland was a left-wing party, and it was ideologically opposed to austerity as well as capitalism, condemning both as the main causes of poverty and wealth inequality. The party pointed to the side effects of socioeconomic transition of Poland from socialism to free-market capitalism, which divided Polish society into classes and layers, with few becoming wealthy and many being plunged into poverty. The party argued that the capitalist system is inherently unfair, stating that an overwhelming majority of low-income groups in Poland are the 'hard-working poor' which nevertheless 'have it tough all their lives'.\nThe party believed that one of the priorities of any government should be to ensure more workplaces and reduce the problem of unemployment. The Poor of Poland also argued against 'defeatist' attitudes regarding poverty, stating that despite the perceived inevitability in it, an appropriate socioeconomic system will make it possible to eliminate poverty completely. As part of the Alternative Social Movement, the party was particularly critical of the centre-right government of Jerzy Buzek, which it identified as the main reason behind financial hardships of Poles, given the policies of Buzek such as privatization, deregulation and austerity, along with the membership in the neoliberal European Union.\nThe Poor of Poland became a part of the Polish Labour Party - August 80, which calls for free education and healthcare, demands a complete halt to privatization, an establishment of an extensive welfare state in Poland, and a 35-hour working week and a high minimum wage that would be fixed to 68% of the national average. The party identifies itself as radically socialist, anti-capitalist and anti-liberal, and promotes itself as the \"true left\" as opposed to the \"caviar left\", which it identifies as the social-democratic Democratic Left Alliance.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSelf-Defence of the Republic of Poland\nLeague and Self-Defence\nAlternative Social Movement\nPolish Labour Party - August 80\nSocial Justice Movement\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Notes ==",

        "content": "Tan Suo San Hao (simplified Chinese: 探索三号; traditional Chinese: 探索三號; lit. 'Discovery Three') is a Chinese icebreaking research vessel under construction for the Institute of Deep-sea Science and Engineering of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.\nAs of 2024, Guangzhou Shipyard International is building a slightly smaller Polar Class 6 research vessel, Ji Di, at the same time.\n\n\n== Design ==\nTan Suo San Hao measures 104 metres (341 ft) in length overall and 19.7 metres (65 ft) in beam, draws 7 metres (23 ft) of water, and displaces about 10,000 tonnes (9,800 long tons). The vessel has a multidisciplinary scientific outfit with accommodation for up to 80 persons as well as ability to deploy China's deep-sea research submersibles Striver, Deep Sea Warrior, and Jiaolong. A 6 by 4.8 metres (20 by 16 ft) moon pool allows deploying and recovering autonomous underwater vehicles in ice-covered waters.\nTan Suo San Hao's diesel-electric propulsion system consists of four 3,000-kilowatt (4,000 hp) six-cylinder Wärtsilä 6L32 main diesel generators that power the ship's two 4.5-megawatt (6,000 hp) ABB Azipod DI1400 azimuth thrusters. This will give the vessel a maximum speed of 16 knots (30 km/h; 18 mph) in open water and enables it to break 1.2-metre (3.9 ft) level ice with a 20-centimetre (7.9 in) snow cover at a continuous speed of 2 knots (3.7 km/h; 2.3 mph) in both ahead and astern directions.\nTan Suo San Hao is built to Polar Class 4, an ice class intended for year-round operation in thick first-year ice which may contain small inclusions of old sea ice that has survived at least one melting season without melting completely.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Development and construction ===\nTan Suo San Hao is claimed to be the first research vessel of its kind developed indigenously in China. The ¥800 million ship has been jointly funded by the People's Government of Hainan, Sanya Yazhou Bay Science and Technology City, and the vessel's future operator, Institute of Deep Sea Science and Engineering of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.\nThe construction of the vessel began with a steel cutting ceremony at Guangzhou Shipyard International, a subsidiary of the China State Shipbuilding Corporation, on 25 June 2023 and Tan Suo San Hao was floated out on 20 April 2024.\n\n\n=== Career ===\nTan Suo San Hao is planned to enter service in 2025.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 1995 NCAA Division I women's basketball championship game was the final game of the 1995 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament. It determined the champion of the 1994–95 NCAA Division I women's basketball season and was contested by the Connecticut Huskies and the Tennessee Lady Volunteers. The game was played on April 2, 1995, at Target Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota. After trailing 38–32 at halftime, No. 1 UConn defeated No. 3 Tennessee 70–64 to capture the NCAA national championship, and complete the second unbeaten season in women's NCAA history (Texas, 1986). Connecticut's Rebecca Lobo was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player.\n\n\n== Participants ==\n\n\n=== Tennessee Lady Volunteers ===\n\nThe Lady Vols, representing the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, Tennessee, were led by head coach Pat Summitt in her 21st season at the school. Tennessee began the season ranked No. 1 in the AP Poll. The team's first loss of the season was at No. 2 UConn on January 16. The team swept through the SEC regular season before losing to Vanderbilt in the SEC tournament championship game. The Lady Vols finished No. 3 in the final AP poll, behind No. 1 UConn and No. 2 Colorado.\nEntering the NCAA tournament at 29–2, Tennessee held the No. 1 seed and hosted their games in the Mideast region. They defeated No. 16 seed Florida A&M, No. 9 seed FIU, No. 4 seed Western Kentucky, and No. 2 seed Texas Tech to reach the Final Four for the first time since the championship after the 1991 season. In the National semifinals, the Lady Volunteers easily defeated the No. 3 seed from the Midwest region and fellow SEC rival, Georgia, 73–51.\n\n\n=== Connecticut Huskies ===\n\nThe Huskies, who represented the University of Connecticut in Storrs, Connecticut, were led by head coach Geno Auriemma, in his 10th season at the school. UConn opened the season ranked No. 4 in the AP poll, and worked their way to the No. 2 ranking ahead of a showdown with No. 1 Tennessee on January 16 in Storrs. UConn knocked off the Lady Vols to wrestle away the top spot in the rankings – a place they remained for the rest of the season. Connecticut closed out a perfect regular season, including an 18–0 record in the Big East, before winning the Big East tournament to improve to 29–0 overall.\nIn the NCAA tournament, the No.1 seeded Huskies defeated No. 16 seed Maine, No. 8 seed Virginia Tech, No. 4 seed Alabama, and No. 3 seed Virginia to reach the second NCAA Final Four in program history. They won 87–60 over the West region's No. 2 seed Stanford in the national semifinal to reach the national championship game with a 34–0 record.\n\n\n== Starting lineups ==\n\n\n== Game summary ==\n\n\n== Media coverage ==\nThe game was broadcast on CBS with Sean McDonough on play-by-play duties and Ann Meyers as the color analyst.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe Connecticut Huskies cemented their place as a program that could compete at the highest level of NCAA women's basketball. The Huskies joined the 1985–86 Texas Longhorns as the only two teams to complete a season an unbeaten National champions. UConn would return to the Final Four in 1996, but watched as Tennessee not only won the title in 1996, but went on to three-peat by winning in 1997 and 1998. In addition to those three titles to close out the 1990s, under legendary head coach Pat Summitt, the Lady Volunteers would also win National championships in 2007 and 2008. The Huskies then took over women's basketball in the 2000s and 2010s. Head coach Geno Auriemma would lead the program to National titles in 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2009, 2010, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016. With a combined 19 championships and 41 Final Fours, these two programs have set the standard for excellence in women's college basketball and showcased a fierce rivalry that spanned multiple decades.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==",

They compete in the BUIHA (British Universities Ice Hockey Association) Checking Division 1 as the most northern team in the league. Founded in 2011, they host the most popular event in the BUIHA, the Jonny Wookey Memorial Game to over 1,500 students.\nThe Typhoons have had success since their founding in 2011, with four conference titles and two league titles, most recently in 2022. They will be playing in the BUIHA National Championship on April 27, 2024.\n\n\n== Jonny Wookey Memorial Varsity Game ==\nThe Jonny Wookey game started in 2013 as a remembrance of team co-founder Jonny Wookey, who died in Cypress just before graduating in 2012. The game is played against the Edinburgh Eagles with all proceeds going to the Jonny Wookey foundation set up by the family. The first game hosted over 550 people to watch a 6-3 victory, the following year (2014) doubling this attendance for another 6-3 victory. The record attendance is over 1,500 people. The Typhoons have won the Jonny Wookey game 8 times in total, most recently in 2023.\n\n\n== Influential Past Players ==\nJonny Wookey - One of the founders of the Typhoons from Toronto, Canada. Tragically dying before his graduation, his impact is felt years later. The Jonny Wookey Memorial Game is played in his memory and the teams' jerseys still display a maple leaf with JW written on it in his memory.\nKieran McCann - A first year hockey player from Los Angeles California who tragically died in St Andrews in 2015. He is memorialized in the Jonny Wookey game and at the annual Kieran Memorial Dinner.\nOllie Cutting - A co-founder of the Typhoons who was also picked to play for Team Great Britain in 2014.\n\n\n== Current Team Roster ==\nWhile the team is built around students from the University of St Andrews, the team is also open to all university students in Fife, Dundee and beyond.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Helen Caldwell Day Riley (1926–2013) was a nurse, author, and Catholic Worker hospitality house founder in the United States. Her three books— an autobiography and its sequel, and a third about the Catholic Union of the Sick — were all published between 1951 and 1956. She was African American.\n\n\n== Birth and education ==\nBorn Helen Emmilyne Caldwell in Marshall, Texas, to Velma and George (G. O.) Caldwell. At the time of her birth her mother was a kindergarten teacher, and her father, a violinist and choir director, was a professor of music at Bishop College. The family moved around to his various positions at HBCUs until he settled at Rust College in Holly Springs, Mississippi. The family included her aunt of the same name, \"Big Helen,\" an older half-sister, Clara, from her father's previous marriage, an older brother, George Jr., and a younger brother, William. Her father also trained as a pharmacist, so while the family was of modest income it was never destitute. Of the money situation, Catholic Worker Amanda Daloisio wrote, \"He believed that his gifts and talents as a musician and as a professor should be of service to the southern Black community, despite never being paid much more than a laborer’s salary.\" Her parents divorced and remarried other people.\nA Memphis paper claimed she was from Memphis, but the city only had a partial claim on her given how much the family moved around. She said they lived in Missouri, Iowa, Mississippi, and Tennessee. She began grade school in Iowa City, Iowa and recalled that she did not experience racial discrimination there. She loved the public library and began to use it and check out books when she was six. It was a traumatic shock when the family moved to Mississippi and she encountered more racially charged schools in the heavily segregated deep south. She started college early, at age 16, attending Rust College, the HBCU where her father taught music. In 1944 she enrolled in its military cadet nurse corps program that was still operating toward the end of WWII. In February 1945 she entered the nursing training program at Harlem Hospital in New York.\nTuberculosis interrupted her studies during her senior year at the former Cumberland Hospital, around the same time her son Butch was diagnosed with polio. She wrote her first autobiography during 19 months in a tuberculosis sanatorium first in Memphis and then at Stony Wold, New York. She was able to work as a nurse after her recovery, but only as a practical nurse (RPN), since illness had interrupted her RN training.\n\n\n== Conversion to Catholicism ==\nWhen she was a student nurse, she encountered the Catholic faith when trained to baptize dead and dying babies born to Catholic parents. When she was briefly hospitalized with appendicitis, a hospital chaplain, Fr. Francis Meenan, asked if she wanted to become Catholic, and she said yes. After the birth of her son, whom she left with her mother while she finished school, she moved back to New York and volunteered at the Mott Street house of hospitality, sponsored by Servant of God Dorothy Day and Peter Maurin via the Catholic Worker. She sang, and was part of a group of young people whom Dorothy Day said formed an apostolate and \"managed to have a grand time.\"\n\n\n== Hospitality house founder ==\nIn 1951 a fire in Memphis took the lives of two Black children whose mother had left them home alone. The tragedy and need for childcare for working mothers led Day Riley to open Blessed Martin's House of Hospitality on January 6, 1952 (the feast of the Epiphany) a storefront at 299 S. 4th Street, in the tradition of Catholic Worker houses. It was named for now-Saint Martin de Porres, and the nursery was named in full for the saint. Dorothy Day attended the opening, breaking segregation laws by staying at the house itself. It was intended to provide shelter for the poor, particularly women and their children. Day Riley received anonymous letters challenging her authority, but Father John J. Coyne S.S.J. of the Josephites, a congregation organized specifically to work among African-Americans, supported her and rallied the group around her. He blessed it with holy water at the opening when Dorothy Day was present, and he was the spiritual director of the house. In 1950 they got approval for the house from Bishop William Adrian, and he also gave them $200 in startup funds. The house opened on January 6, 1952, in a run-down store property near Beale Street. They soon had 15-16 children whom they cared for while their mothers worked. Dorothy Day helped them purchase a house in 1954, and Day printed a fundraising appeal in The Catholic Worker. Although Bishop Adrian initially did approve the house, he also became one of many white voices asking her to be less political and not try to go so quickly or be so outspoken. The house had a clothing room, a library, and it offered sewing lessons. A woman named Ida who lived across the street came in to help every day.\nThe house was supported by an interracial Catholic Action study and discussion group called The Blessed Martin House Outer Circle. Day Riley co-founded it with a white man from a well-off family in Memphis who arranged to meet her at Riverside Park in 1950 to discuss the group's formation. The police broke up the meeting because the park was for whites only.\n\n\n== Author of articles and books ==\nWhile recuperating from tuberculosis in Memphis, she contributed an occasional column called \"Looking Things Over\" to the Memphis World, an African-American newspaper. A letter she wrote to friends about being turned away from the segregated Holly Springs church where she used to worship was published in The Catholic Worker, bringing her to the attention of Catholics who began an interracial study group with her in Memphis. Publisher Maisie Ward wrote about Day Riley's three books for her publishing house, Sheed & Ward, in her autobiography Unfinished Business. \"How profound is Helen Day’s prayer about the problems of being a negro in the deep South. 'Not just a plain old wooden cross,' she prays — Yes, she will carry a cross, but it must be more clearly a cross, heavier perhaps, certainly of her own choosing. 'I’ll send you a specification' she hears herself saying to God.\" From 1963 to 1970 she was listed on the masthead of The Catholic Worker as one of its editors. Day Riley  went on speaking engagements to support the books throughout the south, as much as she was able with her other duties.\n\n\n=== Book: Color, Ebony (Sheed & Ward, 1951) ===\nThe reception of Day Riley's first book was positive, and her second and third gradually drew more acclaim. It was serialized in the Biloxi, Mississippi Sun Herald before publication. The New York Times noted Color, Ebony, but said little other than it had appeared. Daniel Cantwell of the Catholic Labor Alliance in Chicago reviewed it for The American Catholic Sociological Review, writing that it \"will help white Catholics know their fellow Catholics of color, their human problems, their human yearnings, their heartaches, their hurt feelings, their problems of Faith, their spiritual depth is an important book. Helen Day in telling the story of her life as she looks back upon it at the age of twenty-three from a bed in a New York tuberculosis sanatorium does all this - and does it superbly well.\" Writing for The Catholic Worker, Jack English wrote that it \"is a simply written book, one which is full of hope of what can be accomplished through the Christian techniques inherent in the doctrine of the Mystical Body of Christ. It is a mature book, surprising in one so young, and it is a book which could only be written by a generous person who has been peculiarly formed and blessed by the Holy Spirit. For a deep and penetrating analysis of what it is to be a Negro in this country, Color, Ebony is to be recommended.\" The Durham Herald-Sun (North Carolina) said neutrally Color, Ebony is \"not intended to inflame, but to light a darkened pathway.\" However, the Commercial Appeal (Memphis, Tennessee) called it \"both refreshing and important.\" In The Tidings, the official archdiocesan newspaper for Los Angeles, John S. Kennedy wrote, \"you will probably agree it is one of the most engrossing and inspiring life stories you have ever taken up,\" and \"an altogether exceptional work, this must be on your reading list for the fall and winter.\" He later added it to his recommended list of Christmas books, calling it \"heart-breaking and heart-lifting.\" The News & Observer (Raleigh, North Carolina) had the most negative reaction, summarizing the book in few words and calling it \"A bill of complaint.\" The Tampa Tribune only gleaned from it that \"white people are not all bad.\" Norman Cousins accorded it the honor of running excerpts in his periodical, The Saturday Review of Literature. Alma Savage, the Children's Page Editor for Our Sunday Visitor, met the author, saying that she \"is as inspiring to meet as the book is to read.\" Virginia Beck Smith later called Day Riley \"A really brilliant writer\" in the same publication. Charles Alexander in the Albany Democrat-Herald called it \"a moving autobiography that rates among the most engrossing life-stories of recent times\" and \"an altogether exceptional work.\"\n\n\n=== Book: Not Without Tears (Sheed & Ward, 1954) ===\nThis second book was reviewed in more Catholic journals, nine in total, than its predecessor was, demonstrating the growth of the author's impact. John E. Coogan, S. J., reviewing for The American Catholic Sociological Review, wrote, \"What does a Negro mother say when hospital Sisters of her own faith close their doors against her polio-crippled child needing an operation? What when her canon-law pastor tells her his is a White church— that he would not answer her summons even to give her the Last Sacraments?... Helen Day here shows us how to become a saint ? and love it. Her story of meeting Christ in a Memphis alley brings no scent of magnolias but there's deep laughter in her eyes.\" Writing for Our Sunday Visitor, John S. Kennedy said \"The further journey is even more interesting, and the new book even better.\" The Chattanooga Daily Times wrote that \"She has written it with a fine restraint, with intelligence, kindness, and humor.\"\n\n\n=== Book: All the Way to Heaven (Sheed & Ward, 1956) ===\nHer third book was based on the Catholic Union of the Sick. The Catholic Standard and Times ran a positive review, concluding, \"May this book be read widely.\" Virginia Rohr Rowland, affiliated with Friendship House and a contributor to America magazine, reviewed it on the radio. The St. Louis Register wrote, \"This is a wonderful, moving book. The sick will receive comfort and inspiration from it, and undoubtedly a generous acceptance of trials, which can crush the hardiest soul.\" A later review, however, praised it but labeled it \"overly sentimental.\" A. K. C. writing for The Catholic Worker raved, \"Helen Day does not lower her ideals when the going gets rough, or talk in terms of a modified spirituality more 'suited' to work in the world. Her courage is admirable, her example inspiring.\"\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nCirca 1946 Day Riley (then Caldwell) met a Navy sailor named George Day, with whom she shared what she called \"a grand passion,\" and they were secretly married and she became pregnant. Her husband was arrested by the Navy for desertion, and she obtained a quick divorce before their son, MacDonald Francis Day (known as Butch), was born. The Associated Negro Press included a photo of her and Butch in some newspapers. Butch had polio while she was recovering from tuberculosis, and they experienced health disparities when he was denied admission to three hospitals before they found one that would take a Black child. He also suffered an eye injury and developed glaucoma when yet another hospital would not take him in time. Day Riley's mother raised her son while she finished nursing school.\nIn 1955 she married a man from the hospitality house community, Jesse Richardson Riley, whom she noted was a fervent Catholic like her. The couple tried to keep the Blessed Martin House open, but they were forced to close it for financial reasons in 1957, and they then moved to Barstow, California. In addition to Butch from Day Riley's previous relationship, they had four children together. She and her husband were married for 58 years, and she worked as the children's librarian at the public library in Barstow. Although she was no longer the same type of activist, she remained involved in volunteer work, and in 1986 she and her husband hosted members of the Great Peace March for Global Nuclear Disarmament. She continued to practice her Catholic faith, and she and her husband were active in the Knights of Columbus.\nShe died December 15, 2013, in Barstow, California.\n\n\n== References ==",

The album was originally slated for release in 1999 before being shelved by Beyond, leading to the release of Sponge's third album, New Pop Sunday.\n\n\n== Production ==\nSponge recorded most of Planet Girls while they were still with Columbia Records, with the help of producer Kevin Shirley (Aerosmith, Journey, The Black Crows). The label was not interested in releasing it however, so the band decided to finish the album themselves and attempt to release it through Beyond instead, before its eventual shelving in 1998. Sponge had re-recorded the album and subsequently released New Pop Sunday in place of Planet Girls. On April 20, 2024, to coincide with Record Store Day, Sponge partnered with Sound City Records to release Planet Girls on vinyl, initially through in-store purchase, and then online purchase starting April 21. The album appeared on streaming the same day.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Band members ==\nVinnie Dombroski - vocals\nMichael Cross - guitars/backing vocals\nTim Cross - bass/backing vocals\nJoey Mazzola - guitars/backing vocals\nCharlie Grover - drums\n\n\n== References ==",

This allows a standard data structure for which data analysis tools can be consistently built around.\nImportance: Cited over 1,500 times, this effort for tidy data has been described by David Donoho as having \"more impact on today’s practice of data analysis than many highly regarded theoretical statistics articles\". In the context of data visualization, this publication is said to support \"efficient exploration and prototyping because variables can be assigned different roles in the plot without modifying anything about the original dataset\".\nData Organization in Spreadsheets\n\nAuthor: Karl W. Broman and Kara H. Woo\nPublication data: \nOnline version: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989\nDescription: This article offers practical recommendations for organizing data in spreadsheets, like Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets, to reduce errors and lower the barrier for later analyses due to limitations in spreadsheets or quirks in the software.\nImportance: Influences teaching both data and non-data practitioners to create more analysis-friendly spreadsheets, and has been described to outline \"spreadsheet best practices\".\n\n\n== Data visualizations ==\nQuantitative Graphics in Statistics: A Brief History\n\nAuthor: James R. Beniger and Dorothy L. Robyn\nPublication data: \nOnline version: https://www.jstor.org/stable/2683467\nDescription: Outlines history and evolution of quantitative graphics in statistics, going through spatial organization (17th and 18th centuries), discrete comparison (18th and 19th centuries), continuous distribution (19th century), and multivariate distribution and correlation (late 19th and 20th centuries).\nImportance: Helps put into perspective for learning data practitioners the recency of graphics that are used.\n\n\n== Tooling ==\nHidden Technical Debt in Machine Learning Systems\n\nAuthor: D. Sculley, Gary Holy, Daniel Golovin, Eugene Davydov, Todd Phillips, Dietmar Ebner, Vinay Chaudhary, Michael Young, Jean-François Crespo, Dan Dennison\nPublication data: \nOnline version: https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2015/file/86df7dcfd896fcaf2674f757a2463eba-Paper.pdf\nDescription: This paper argues that it is \"dangerous to think of [complex machine learning] quick wins as coming for free\" and overviews risk factors to account for when implementing a machine learning system.\nImportance: All authors worked for Google, article is cited over 1000 times, and helped practitioners thinking about quickly implementing a machine learning tool without understanding the long-term maintenance of the tool.\nA few useful things to know about machine learning\n\nAuthor: Pedro Domingos\nPublication data: \nOnline version: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2347736.2347755 https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~pedrod/papers/cacm12.pdf\nDescription: The purpose of this paper is to distill inaccessible \"folk knowledge\" to effectively implement machine learning projects because \"machine learning projects take much longer than necessary or wind up producing less-than-ideal results\".\nImportance: Cited over 4,000 times to influence the common set of knowledge for data practitioners using machine learning.\n\n\n== Teaching data science ==\nThe Introductory Statistics Course: A Ptolemaic Curriculum\n\nAuthor: George W. Cobb\nPublication data: \nOnline version: https://escholarship.org/uc/item/6hb3k0nz\nDescription: This paper argues for a rethinking of how teachers of statistics should structure their introductory statistics courses away from the technical machinery based on the normal distribution and towards simpler alternative methods based on permutations done on computers.\nImportance: Cited over 300 times, this paper influenced teachers of statistics in the 21st century to reconsider teaching the mere mechanics of statistics, while the use of computers can be leveraged for doing more with less.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLists of important publications in science\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPapers and tech blogs by companies sharing their work on data science and machine learning in production.",

        "content": "The Bentonsport Bridge is located on the Des Moines River connecting Bentonsport to Vernon, Iowa, and is on the National Register of Historic Places. It is located in the Bentonsport National Historic District.\nThe truss bridge dates to 1882.  The King Iron Bridge and Manufacturing Company of Cleveland, Ohio fabricated and erected the wrought iron trusses.  The bridge is composed of five 146-foot, pinned Pratt trusses.  The bridge is 730 feet long and 16 feet wide.  Local masons Snyder and Kramer did the stonework for the piers.  The cost in 1882 was $33,309. \nIn 1903, a major flood on the Des Moines River washed away a middle span of the bridge.  Local folklore suggests that the replacement was erected on the frozen river during the winter and hoisted into place with derricks with help from elephants from a traveling circus troupe who were wintering nearby in northeast Missouri.\nIn 1972, parts of Bentonsport and Vernon - and the bridge were designated a National Historic District.\nThe Bentonsport bridge carried vehicle traffic until 1985 when a new bridge was completed just upriver.  Since that time the old truss bridge has continued to be used by pedestrians.\nIn 2024, the Iowa Transportation Commission awarded $1.6 million to Van Buren County to rehabilitate the aging structure, including structural improvements and an expanded pedestrian walkway.  Work is expected to be completed in 2025.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Natalia Idrisova is a Tajikistani green energy consultant whose work was recognised in 2024 when she was one of the BBCs 100 most inspiring women.\n\n\n== Life ==\nIdrisova was born in about 1987 in Dushanbe. Her family were natural conservationists and they brought up their children to think the same. They cared for animals, they did not pick flowers or waste food. In time, her brother started a small non-profit which he named \"Little Earth\". She became an enthusiastic supporter of her brother's initiative in 2014.\nLittle Earth works in the mountainous areas of her country where the people have insuffient energy for their own heating. Both firewood and electricity are in short supply. They deliver training and solar powered lights and cookers and energy saving devices like pressure cookers. The local women's time is filled with caring for their livestock and children and gathering firewood. The new ideas and equipment create some free time and ideas, but the decisions are traditionally made in the society by men. She and Little Earth encourage women to feel empowered. She believes that public understanding of environmental issues is low which strengthens the hands of larger companies. She gives the example of trees being cut down. Profit is made, but the locals may have casualties from a landslide that would have prevented by tree roots. People can influence decisions if they are better informed about the underlying issues. Idrisova is on the committee of a pressure group called CANEECA - who try to tackle climate related issues. She sees a large barrier to change in under developed countries is the balance of power. She says that activists in poor countries do not make climate related decisions.\nShe is a critic of her country's energy policy. In per-capita terms her country is the poorest in central Asia. The majority of the power comes from hydro sources but the topping up is achieved by fossil fueled power stations and China was funding the building of more capacity. Tajiskan is committed to improving its contribution to controlling climate. Electric cars are being adopted but Idrisova suspects that they may be running on electrity formed in a fossil fuel based power station.\nJournalists can influence decisions and she led a master-class on climate related issues in May 2023. In autumn 2023 she was named as one of the BBC's 100 women of influence.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Cielo Magno is a Filipino academic who is a former Undersecretary of the Department of Finance. She served as the Undersecretary for the Fiscal Policy and Monitoring Group from August 2022 to September 4, 2023. She also served as the Chairperson of the Philippine Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, the Fiscal Incentives Review Board (FIRB) Technical Committee, and the Inter-Agency Investment Promotion Coordination Committee (IIPCC) Technical Committee. She resigned from her post after she criticized Executive Order No. 39 of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. which imposed the price ceiling on rice prices. She posted the basic graph of supply and demand curve on her Facebook page with the line showing how the price cap can lead to rice supply shortages and may negatively affect farmers and consumers. Her post earned the ire of Malacanang with Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin issuing a statement saying that \"she clearly does not support the administration and its programs for nation-building.\" Her controversial post earned her the reputation \"for speaking her mind\" especially on careless policies that may significantly affect the people's welfare.\nMagno is a tenured associate professor in the University of the Philippines School of Economics before she was seconded to the Department of Finance to serve as Undersecretary under the leadership of Secretary Benjamin Diokno.  She was also recently selected to represent the civil society in the Global Steering Committee of the Open Government Partnership.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\n\nCielo Magno was born in Gapan City, Nueva Ecija Philippines to Dr. Crispin Magno, an optometrist and Lorenza Diaz a businesswoman. Her family resides in San Isidro, Nueva Ecija. She grew up with her grandparents, Judge Julio P. Magno and pianist Dominga Magno who taught her how to play the piano when she was only four years old. She recently took up playing the saxophone.\nMagno is a product of public education having attended San Isidro Central School, eventually transferring to Gapan North Central School where she graduated as class valedictorian. She completed her high school at Divina Pastora College where she also graduated as class valedictorian. Magno entered the University of the Philippines Diliman in 1994. She graduated from the UP School of Economics with degrees in Bachelor of Science in Business Economics and a Masters in Economics.\nWhile a student at the University of the Philippines Diliman, she was elected as the Chairperson of the University Student Council. She was the third woman to be elected chair since the University Student Council was founded in 1913. She was also a member of the world renowned UP Concert Chorus and was part of the1996 international touring batch of Dean Reynaldo Paguio.\nIn 2005, Magno was awarded the Fulbright Scholarship for a PhD in Law and Public Policy at Northeastern University in Boston Massachusetts with a dissertation examining how pharmaceutical companies influence doctors' decisions on prescribing medication.\n\n\n== Career ==\nMagno is an associate professor in the University of the Philippines’ School of Economics. She has more than twenty years of experience in research and policy work with the public and the private sector including local and international agencies. Her research and interests focus on public finance; law, health, institutional, and resource economics; and industry regulation. Her publications include discussions on health, pharmaceutical competition and access to medicine,  corruption, foreign investments, decentralization and local public finance, transportation policy, energy and mining, civic space and human rights, natural resources, economic and social development, mental health and spirituality, and the court system.\nEarly in her career she served as the Executive Director of the National Movement of Young Legislators (NMYL). NMYL is a local government league of young legislators. She served as the National Coordinator of Bantay Kita/Publish What You Pay Philippines, the coalition of civil society organizations calling for transparency and accountability in the mining and oil and gas sector from 2012 to 2016 and helped found the Philippine EITI.\nMagno served as a member of the international board of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative for seven years. During her tenure as a board member, the EITI Standard has evolved to include disclosures on social and environmental impacts of extractive industries, contracts, beneficial ownership and free prior and informed consent on top of the financial disclosure required by the transparency and accountability organization.

        "content": "Ixone Andreu Egia (born in Santurtzi in 1995) is a Basque social worker, expert on violence against women and politician.\nShe is currently a councillor of the Santurtzi City Council. In addition, she is also a member of the Local Government, as delegate councillor for Social Action and Equality, being the youngest councillor in the history of the municipality.\n\n\n== Biography and career ==\nIxone Andreu was born in Santurtzi, Basque Country, in 1995. She was born into a Basque nationalist family. He studied at the Asti Leku Ikastola school in Portugalete, where he studied primary education, secondary education and the Spanish Baccalaureate.\nShe studied a bachelor's degree in social work at the University of Deusto (2013–2017) and also studied a bachelor's degree in social education at the University of Deusto. She later studied a master's degree in intervention in violence against women at the University of Deusto. Her final master's thesis was \"The influence of sexuality and gender mandates in the construction of pornography\" (\"Sexualitatea eta genro mandatuen eragina pornografiaren eraikuntzan\"). She has worked in different areas related to violence against women and she has also participated in different campaigns in that area such as Beldur Barik of the Basque Government, among others.\nIn 2006, at just eleven years old, Andreu was a contestant on the successful talent show Egin Kantu! from the Basque network ETB1, presented by Nerea Alias and with Joxe Mendizabal as singing coach. She reached the end of the contest and was a finalist.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nSince she was young she has been affiliated with the youth organization Euzko Gaztedi Indarra (EGI) and the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV). In the 2023 Spanish local elections, she was a candidate for councillor of the Santurtzi City Council on the list of the Basque Nationalist Party. She was elected councillor, becoming the youngest person to be a councillor in the history of the municipality.\nIn the 2023-2027 legislature, Karmele Tubilla was elected mayor of Santurtzi. Tubilla appointed Andreu as a member of the Local Government Board and delegate councillor for Social Action and Equality, succeeding Itziar Carrocera Fernández as head of this area, and becoming the youngest person to be appointed delegate councillor. At the head of the area of social action and equality, Andreu set his priority as the fight against sexist violence, improving anti-sexual assault protocols, the Women' Empowerment School, drug addictions plans or the inclusion of the elderly in the digital sphere.\nAndreu studied at the Asti Leku Ikastola school and there she had Miren Matanzas as a teacher, and in 2023 they met again in the Santurtzi City Council, each representing a different political party. Furthermore, in the plenary session of the constitution of the Santurtzi City Council, Andreu and Miren Matanzas had to be at the age table, as they were the youngest and oldest councillors of the City Council.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nImanol Pradales\nSanturtzi\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nIxone Andreu at IMDb",

Each division has a best-of-three series in the first round to determine the top 16 teams for the division semifinals, with various teams receiving byes based on regular season performance.\nThe 16 teams that remain—four from each division—will play a best-of-five series in the division semifinals, with the playoffs continuing with another best-of-five series for the division finals and a best-of-seven series for the conference finals and Calder Cup finals.\n\n\n== Playoff Format ==\nThe AHL will continue to use the same playoff format used in the previous playoffs. The playoff field will include the top six finishers in the eight-team Atlantic Division, the top five finishers each in the seven-team North and Central Divisions, and the top seven teams in the 10-team Pacific Division. First Round match-ups will be best-of-three series; the two highest seeds in the Atlantic, the three highest seeds in each of the North and Central, and the first-place team in the Pacific will receive byes into the best-of-five Division Semifinals, with the First Round winners re-seeded in each division.

Aged 21, his uncle, Fox Maule-Ramsay, 2nd Baron Panmure (later the 11th Earl of Dalhousie), then Secretary at War, appointed him as his private secretary. He held the post when Lord Panmure was briefly President of the Board of Control in 1852, and when he was Secretary of State for War in Viscount Palmerston's cabinet.\nIn 1854, Ramsay was elected as secretary of the Royal Commission of Promotion in the Army. In 1855, his uncle appointed him assistant director of Army Stores and Clothing. In 1883, he became Director of Army Clothing, a post he held for 30 years. In that role, he was credited for the introduction of khaki.\nSir George was appointed a CB in 1882 and was knighted in 1900. In retirement, he (with Sir George Douglas) edited the papers of his uncle, which were published in two volumes.\nHe married in 1864 Juliet Charteris Crawfurd, daughter of John Crawfurd, FRS. They had one daughter. Lady Ramsay died in 1918.\n\n\n== References ==",

It stars Oscar Martínez alongside Ingrid García-Jonsson and Carlos Areces.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nInitially reluctant, widowed architect Bernardo accepts to fulfill his dead wife's wish of scattering her ashes in her Spanish homeland travelling from Buenos Aires to the Costa del Sol, where he finds out about her wife's secrets while coming across real estate agent Abi and Amalia.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe film is a Películas Grupo Tranquilo and AZ Films Spanish-Argentine co-production and it had the participation of Canal Sur and Movistar+. Shooting locations included Seville, Sotogrande, Marbella, and Buenos Aires.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe film was presented at the Málaga Film Festival on 21 March 2019. It was also set to open in Argentine theatres on 21 March 2019. Distributed by ConUnPack Distribución, it was released theatrically in Spain on 26 July 2019.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nPablo O. Scholz of Clarín gave the film a 'good' rating, pointing out that Martínez carries the whole film, while citing that \"little, minute by minute, scene after scene, [the film] loses the consistency it had at the beginning\".\nMirito Torreiro of Fotogramas rated the film 3 out of 5 stars, highlighting Martínez's performance as the best thing about the film.\nJavier Ocaña of El País assessed that \"there is never a sense of unity\" in the screenplay, and the promising first half hour is scuppered.\n\n\n== Accolades ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Argentine films of 2019\nList of Spanish films of 2019\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Yehezkel Nisanov (Hebrew: יחזקאל ניסנוב; 1886-1911) was a Mountain Jewish Zionist and early immigrant in Eretz Israel.\nHe became involved in the Russian Social Democratic Party and was one of the early founders of the Bar Giora group and later Hashomer\n\n\n== Life ==\nNisanov was born in 1886 in Tamir-Khan-Shura to a family of Mountain Jews. Growing up in poverty, he began working at a young age and later moved to Baku to study sewing, where he became involved in the Russian Social Democratic Party and eventually the Poalei Zion movement. Because of Zionist aspirations he immigrated to Ottoman Palestine in 1906, together with his family. He played a significant role as one of the early founders of the Bar Giora militia and later Hashomer. Settling in the Galilee, he dedicated himself to land guarding and acquisition.\n\n\n== Death ==\nNisanov was killed by Arab thieves on February 13, 1911, near Yavne'el and Beit Gan (now part of Yavne'el) after refusing to give up his cart and mules. Israel Giladi, one of the leaders of Hashomer, wrote of his death:Of course, he preferred to be killed rather than to give up his mules to the Arabs. When they stole the animals from some farmer Nisanov would reproach him bitterly: \"How is it that you are still alive and your animals are gone? Shame on you!\" And now he has shown that he was as good as his word.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Mustafa Moien Mahmoud Ayyash, commonly known as Mustafa Moien Ayyash or Mustafa Ayyash, is a Palestinian journalist. He is the founder and director of the Palestinian news channel Gaza Now.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nMustafa Moien Mahmoud Ayash was born in the Nuseirat refugee camp in the middle of the Gaza Strip on September 18, 1992 in a Palestinian muslim family. He studied radio and television, business administration, and Palestinian studies and research. He completed his higher studies from the University College of Applied Sciences affiliated with the Islamic University of Gaza. He moved on to complete his university studies at the Al-Ahliyya Amman University in Jordan, then he moved on to complete his studies at the Karabük University in Ankara, Turkey. He completed his studies at the Palestinian Refugee Academy in Britain.\n\n\n== 2023 Israel-Hamas War ==\nGaza Now, the news agency established by Mustafa Ayyash in 2005, played a vital role to publish news about the 2023 Israel-Hamas war. His family was killed in an Israeli airstrike on the Nuseirat refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip, after Israeli aircraft targeted his home on November 22, 2023. His father, mother, spouses, children, sisters and their spouses and children, along with other displaced persons in his family home were killed. His brother Muhammad Ayyash, the photojournalist of the Gaza Now, was also killed during the attack. The Permanent Observer of Palestine at the United Nations Salah Abdel-Shafi and Chairman of Hamas Political Bureau Ismail Haniyeh mourned the death of his family. The United Nations mistakenly used the name of Mustafa Ayyash instead of Muhammad Ayyash in a report on the killing of journalists in the Israel–Hamas war. The killing of Mustafa Ayyash was not published anywhere except the UN report. The Israeli media used the report to make doubt on the Gaza Now after announcing the US sanction. Ayyash tried to file a complaint against Israel after his family was killed but the authorities declined to receive a complaint against Israel.\n\n\n== Arrest and sanctions ==\nThe United States Department of the Treasury announced a sanction against Mustafa Ayyash on 27 March 2024. Britain also announced sanctions against him on the allegation of providing financial services to Hamas.\nMustafa Ayyash was arrested by the Austrian Police on April 18, 2024 after the sanctions of the United States and Britan. The Austrian police also accessed his WhatsApp account, which was followed by 300,000 users, and closed it, in addition to closing the channel's Facebook pages and accounts, which were followed by 8 million users.\n\n\n== See also ==\nYahya Ayyash\nGaza Now\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMustafa Moien Ayyash on Twitter\nMustafa Moien Ayyash on Telegram\nOfficial website of Gaza Now\nGaza Now on Telegram",

        "content": "Karl Volkmar Stoy (22 January 1815, Pegau - 23 January 1885, Jena) was a German educator and pedagogue, a representative of Herbartian pedagogy. \n\n\n== Biography ==\nKarl Volkmar Stoy was born on 22 January 1815, in Pegau, the son of Karl Gottlob Stoy, the archdeacon of Pegau. He received his early education at the prestigious St. Afra Latin School in Meißen, where he excelled in his studies. At the age of 18, he enrolled in the University of Leipzig to pursue a degree in theology, philology, and philosophy. His academic achievements were recognized with a doctorate in philosophy in 1837.\nStoy's intellectual journey continued to Göttingen, where he came under the tutelage of the renowned philosopher Johann Friedrich Herbart. This encounter had a profound impact on Stoy's thinking, shaping his views on education and pedagogy.\nIn 1839, Stoy embarked on his teaching career at the educational institution founded by Karl Friedrich Bender in Weinheim. His passion for education was evident in his approach to teaching, emphasizing practical experiences and hands-on learning.\nIn 1843, Stoy's academic pursuits led him to the University of Jena, where he obtained his habilitation and became a private lecturer. A significant turning point came in 1844 when he took over the private boys' educational institution established by the late Ernst August Heinrich Heimburg. This institution encompassed an alumni association, an elementary school, a secondary school branch, and a gymnasium branch.\nStoy's vision extended beyond the confines of the traditional classroom. In the same year, he established a pedagogical seminary with an attached elementary school, effectively merging theoretical and practical teacher training. His dedication to education was further recognized in 1845, when he was appointed associate professor, and in 1857, when he became Grand Ducal Saxon School Councilor and Honorary Professor.\nStoy's reputation as an educator reached new heights in 1865 when he was called upon to fill the newly created chair of pedagogy at the University of Heidelberg. This prestigious appointment necessitated the dissolution of his Jena institutions between 1866 and 1868.\nDespite his relocation to Heidelberg, Stoy's commitment to his Jena roots remained strong. In 1867, he took a temporary leave of absence to establish an evangelical teacher's seminary in Bielitz, located in the Austrian part of Silesia.\nIn 1874, Stoy decided to return to Jena, resigning his position in Heidelberg. He resumed his role as honorary professor of pedagogy and re-established the pedagogical seminary. In 1880, his son Johann Heinrich Stoy took over the management of the educational institution.\nStoy's involvement in the field of education extended beyond his academic and institutional contributions. He actively participated in the Association for Scientific Pedagogy, serving as its vice-chairman from 1870 onwards. However, in 1876, he stepped down due to a persistent disagreement with the association's chairman, Tuiskon Ziller, regarding publication matters.\nOn January 23, 1885, just one day after his 70th birthday, Karl Volkmar Stoy died in Jena. He left behind a remarkable legacy, having dedicated his life to advancing the field of education and shaping the minds of countless individuals. His contributions continue to resonate today, inspiring educators and educational institutions worldwide. \n\n\n== Publications ==\nDer pädagogischen Bekenntnisse erstes bis neuntes Stück.

Forman met the band while playing in a Jazz band, after being invited to jam with some musicians at a Long Beach party. Forman only played with the band when he was home at Summers from studying.\nForman did not perform with Sublime full-time due to his disdain of frontman Bradley Nowell's heroin addiction, which he died of in 1996. After studying at Harvard, he went to medical school at UCLA, and received a master's degree in medical education from USC. He set up a medical practice in Long Beach in 2005 with his mother. Before opening his practice he a professor of Clinical Medicine at Keck School of Medicine of USC.\nFollowing Sublime's break-up in 1996, Forman initially joined other former bandmates in the Long Beach Dub Allstars, but he departed soon after, having met his future wife Kristen, and starting to pursue his medical career. He did not play music for another seven years until he received blessing from his wife in 2006 to get back into music.\nForman initially played local gigs before he joined Sublime with Rome in 2009, a band founded by surviving Sublime band members Eric Wilson and Bud Gaugh. Forman received a phone call four days before the band's first show, asking for him to audition. He toured the world with Sublime in Rome from October 2009 till April 2011.\nForman is also the founding member of Jelly of the Month Club, the band also consisting of Forman on saxophone, clarinet and organ, Mike “Mic Dangerously” de la Torre on vocals, lead guitar and bass, Scott Wittenberg on drums and Chris “Mr. Crumb” Caplan handling vocals, piano, organ, ukulele, accordion, spoons and guitar.

Despite the lyrical content of Sublime songs, Forman is against recreational drug use, saying \"Kids have to understand that drugs take people away. Even if they don’t die, they become ghosts. Drugs take them away from their lives.\"\n\n\n== Discography ==\nSublime and Sublime with Rome\n40oz. to Freedom (1992)\nSublime (1996)\nYours Truly (2011)\nOther artists\nDel Noah & The Mt.

        "content": "Ralph DeLuca (born in 1976 in East Hanover, New Jersey) is an American art advisor and collector specializing in contemporary art and vintage movie posters, based in New York City and Las Vegas. His clients include individuals, corporations, foundations, and institutions. Amongst his clients are actors Leonardo DiCaprio, Sylvester Stallone, and co-founder of Tinder, Sean Rad. \n\n\n== Life and Career ==\nA lifelong collector, DeLuca purchased his first print, from Salvador Dalí’s The Divine Comedy suite, using his birthday money at age 13.  \nWhile working in investment banking, DeLuca began to  grow his collections in both vintage movie posters and contemporary art. Realizing his rapidly-growing collections were quickly amassing value as financial assets themselves, he switched career paths and became an art advisor. \nDeLuca's collections both in art and entertainment memorabilia have garnished worldwide attention. In 2012, DeLuca received widespread media coverage for paying $1.2 million for nine rare and early film posters, including the world's highest-valued poster of the 1927 film Metropolis.  \nDeLuca has loaned several posters from his collection for exhibitions at MGM Resorts, Salon 94, Poster House, and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. He is known for having one of the world's largest collections of vintage movie posters.\nIn 2014, Artnet named DeLuca as one of 20 of the World’s Most Innovative Art Collectors and as one of the Top 200 Art Collectors Worldwide in 2015. \n\n\n=== Art Advisory ===\nDeLuca is known for his education-based approach to building his clients' collections. He has stated that informed collectors build the strongest collections and are happier with their decisions and urges the importance of equipping art collectors with knowledge.“You're going to make very costly mistakes on your own, or you pay an advisor a fee to save you from those mistakes.\"\n\n\n== Affiliations ==\nConsultant; Los Angeles County Museum of Art\nConsultant; The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences\nConsultant and Curator; MGM Resorts International\nPoster and Pop Culture Expert; Pawn Stars\nArt Consultant; The Family Stallone\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Marietta Sherman Raymond (née, Sherman; 1862–1949) was an American musical educator and orchestral conductor, as well as a successful violinist. In 1892, in Boston, Raymond was regarded as the most successful violin soloist, among women, while noting, too, that she conducted an orchestra of 50 young women, many of whom were prominent in Boston society. She was the leader and manager of the Beacon Orchestral Club and the Raymond Orchestra.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nMarietta (nickname, \"Etta\") Ruth Sherman was born in Lowell, Massachusetts, July 5, 1862.\nShe showed a strong liking and talent for music, and at the age of seven, she began the regular study of the art. With her parents, she removed to Boston, and at the age of nine, commenced the study of the piano and organ. After a short course on the piano, she began the study of the violin, with William Shultz, formerly first violin of the Mendelssohn Club. She afterwards studied with Julius Eichberg and Charles N. Allen, being with the latter for ten years.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAs teacher of violin, she joined the faculty of Wellesley College of Music, 1891–96. In addition, she had about 50 private pupils.\nIt is as leader of the Beacon Orchestral Club that she was best known. That club grew from six young women at its starting point of 1881, to 50 under Raymond's training and direction. Of these, however, many were amateurs, so it did not number a strictly professional membership of over 25. Many of the members belonged to the most prominent families of Boston. The players presented a striking appearance in costumes of white silk, with gold cord trimmings. They won success during various seasons, playing in New York City for the Frank Leslie magazine's Doll Fair, for the Woman's Charity Club in the Boston Music Hall, and for many weddings and receptions given by society people. Their repertory was extensive, and embraced both popular and classical music, with solos by the different instrumentalists. The opinion of the press in the various towns and cities where the club appeared was that it was justly entitled to the claim that \"it is the finest ladies' orchestra in the world.\" During the summer months, Raymond divided the club and furnished music in the various hotels.\nWith rare executive ability, and large orchestral experience, she made this club one of the most artistic and attractive musical organizations before the public in that era. An orchestral club composed entirely of women was certainly something very new and unique. It was especially remarkable for two things: First, the players were, for the most part, American, and secondly, it possessed a large number of performers on wind instruments. Women who play, much less play well, on wind instruments, at that time, were very rare.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nShe made her headquarters in the Hoffman House, Boston.\nOn March 24, 1892, in Boston, she married J. Maxfield Raymond.\nMarietta Sherman Raymond died in Brookline, Massachusetts, September 22, 1949.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Works related to Woman of the Century/Marrietta R.

        "content": "The 6th Cavalry Museum is a military history museum located in Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia. The museum is dedicated to the 6th Cavalry Regiment, a regiment of the United States Army that began as a regiment of cavalry in the American Civil War, and is still active today. It is focused on those who served at the U.S. Army Post at Fort Oglethorpe from 1902 to 1946. The museum was established in 1981 by veterans who served in the cavalry.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1981, the museum was established. By 2005, the veterans who were currently running the museum hired Chris McKeever, the museums first executive director, as they were getting too old to run it themselves entirely. McKeever retired and was succeeded by Jenny Pack in 2022. Also in 2022, the museum was updated to be a part of the Fort Olgethorpe Historic District.\n\n\n== Collections ==\nThe displays of the museum include uniforms, weapons, photographs and vehicles from the regiment. Seminars on military history are sometimes given at the museum. The museum's collection includes artifacts that were discovered in Latvia from the Eastern Front of WWII. The museum also hosts World War Two reenactments. Most activities of the museum were closed, and it operated mainly through its now closed website during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.\n\n\n== References ==",

Its flowers are bright lilac or claret-purple, and its flowering period is late spring to early summer. It is pollinated by bees.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe specific name karelinii honours the Russian explorer and naturalist Grigory Karelin (1801–1872).\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nDespite its common name \"Afghan\", Aquilegia karelinii is not native to Afghanistan, but to Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Xinjiang. It grows in damp ravines, wooded mountain slopes, forest meadows, and alpine zones at altitudes of 900–3600m.\n\n\n== References ==",

In the summers of 1952 and 1953, Elm continued working as a swimming instructor for the Radburn Association while still a student at Indiana University. He held the National Junior 50-yard freestyle championship, and Indiana State AAU championships.  At Indiana, Elm swam under Head Coach Robert Royer, a former IU swimmer and 1928 graduate who had served as Chairman of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).   Royer had coached Indiana since 1931, until becoming ill in 1957 when he was replaced by Hall of Fame Coach Doc Counsilman, who had served as an Assistant Coach by 1957.\nElm would later serve as a swimmer/coach in the Marine Corps.\n\n\n== AAU age group coaching ==\nOne of his first coaching assignments was at Summit, New Jersey's YMCA where his men's team won 68 consecutive meets, and his girls team won 70 consecutive meets.  He coached the outstanding AAU age group team, the Scarlet Jets, associated with Rutgers, which became known as the Central Jersey Aquatics Club when it merged with Coach Bill Palmer's Shore Athletic Club in the early 1970's.  Palmer became Head Coach of the combined team, but Elm continued coaching the club, usually at a separate location in Middlesex.  The Central Jersey Aquatic Club was sold by Palmer in 1988 and came under new management.\nElm taught at Memorial Junior High in Fairlawn, New Jersey before coaching Rutgers.\n\n\n== Coaching Rutgers ==\nReplacing Men's Coach Otto Hill, Elm coached Rutgers teams from 1961 though 1993, simultaneously for a period with his AAU age group team, the Scarlet Jets, known as the Central Jersey Swim Club in the early 70's.  From 1961 through 1972, his Rutger's men's team captured 11 consecutive winning seasons, achieving an overall record of 79–42.  After 1972, the Men's team had significantly fewer wins with mostly losing seasons.\nElm started the Rutger's Women's team, coaching them from 1974 through 1993 simultaneously with the Men's team.  Judy Melick, from the class of 1977 was the first woman to swim for Rutgers. Impressively, Elm's women's team started with three successive undefeated seasons from 1975 to 1977, and dominated the Eastern Championships. At the 1977 National Championships, they became the only Eastern team in the East to place in the top ten.  An exceptional early record, Elm ended the 1970’s with his women's team achieving an impressive 70-20 record.\nNearing the end of his tenure, Elm coached Rutgers during the building of the Busch Campus Sonny Werblin Recreation Center, having some input into its design.\n\n\n== International coaching ==\nElm served on the staff of three U.S. Olympic Teams, as an Assistant in 1968 and 1976, and as Head Coach in 1980.  During his time at Rutgers, he coached the U.S. Pan American Games team in 1967.  He coached a couple of U.S. National Teams that in 1975 toured Japan, and in 1981 toured the Soviet Union.\n\n\n== Top swimmers ==\nWhile coaching Rutgers, Elm mentored swimmers who made the Olympics, including two gold medal winners.  He coached several swimmers who competed in the Pan Am Games, with five winning gold medals.   Elm's swimmers, Elliot Chenaux, a 1964 Olympian from the class of 1968, and Jose Ferraioli, from the class of 1969, swam for Puerto Rico in Olympic competition.  Elm worked with 1964 Tokyo Olympian Phil Riker in the 200-meter butterfly, another native of Paterson, New Jersey.  As mentioned later here, Elm also worked for many years with 1972 Munich Olympic competitor in the 400-meter medley relay Judy Melick.  \n\n\n=== Men ===\nThe Eastern Seaboard Championships, created in 1965 improved Rutger's Athletics, with the contributions of top swimming performers Bill Clark in 1963, Larry Jones and John Wasylyk in 1964, Don Galluzzi, and Marty Flickenger in 1965, and diver Roy Nicholas, an Eastern Champion, in 1964.  Gregg Anderson, of the class of 1970, was the high points scorer for Rutgers in the late 1960's, and was an All-American in 1968 and 1969.   In the 1968 Eastern Championships, Rutgers placed fourth with top six finishes by Bob Chenaux of the Class of 1966, Dave Feigley of the Class of 1966 in diving, All American sprinters Bruce Ball of the Class of 1967 and Dick Woodrow of the Class of 1966, and Eastern Champion in Diving, Peter Hibbard of the Class of 1967.  \n\n\n=== Women ===\nJudy Melick, coached by Elm at Rutgers and in High School with the Scarlet Jets, originally swam with the Rutger's men's team, and was the first Captain of the newly established women's team. As a 1972 Munich Olympian, she swam the breaststroke leg for the gold medal-winning U.S. team in the preliminary heats of the women's 4×100-meter medley relay.  However, she was ineligible to receive a medal under the 1972 rules because she did not compete in the event final. Individually, she also competed in the women's 100-meter breaststroke, finishing fifth in the event final with a time of 1:16.34.  Fifteen of Elm's Rutger's women were the recipients of All-American honors, many becoming stars.  Top women swimmers for Rutgers coached by Elm included Ellen Wallace, a 1972 Olympic trial qualifier and a swimmer at the 1975 World Championships and Pan Am Game, Debbie Franks, Maureen Mortell and Robin Locklair.\n\n\n=== Honors ===\nElm was inducted into the American Swimming Coaches Hall of Fame in 2004, and the Rutgers Athletics Hall of Fame in 1998.  In a more uncommon distinction, in 1973, he was a recipient of the Master Coaches Award from the Swimming Coaches’ Association of America in 1973.  Rutger's annual “Frank Elm Invitational” swim tournament named in his honor was hosted through 2017.  In 1965, Elm was appointed to the Selection and Nominating Committee for Fort Lauderdale's Swimming Hall of Fame. \nHe died on the evening of November 30, 2021, in New Jersey at the age of 92.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 1986 NCAA Division I women's basketball championship game was the final game of the 1986 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament. It determined the champion of the 1985–86 NCAA Division I women's basketball season and was contested by the USC Trojans and the Texas Longhorns. The game was played on March 30, 1986, at Rupp Arena in Lexington, Kentucky. After leading 45–35 at halftime, No. 1 Texas defeated No. 3 USC 97–81 to capture the NCAA national championship, and complete the first unbeaten season in women's NCAA history. Clarissa Davis was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player.\n\n\n== Participants ==\n\n\n=== USC Trojans ===\n\nThe Trojans, represented the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, California, were led by head coach Linda Sharp in her 9th season at the school. After a disappointing season that followed back-to-back national championships, the Women of Troy began the season ranked No. 7 in the AP Poll. The team's first loss of the season was at No. 1 Texas. They lost at No. 2 Louisiana Tech a month later, and then lost their only home game to No. X Long Beach State by a single point on January 28. After peaking at No. 2 in the polls as the calendar turned over to 1986, the team finished the regular season at No. 3.\nFor the third time in four seasons, USC was the top seed in the West region of the NCAA tournament and defeated Montana, No. 16 North Carolina, and No. 4 Louisiana Tech to reach the third Final Four in program history. In the National semifinals, USC easily defeated No. 15 Tennessee, 83–59. After National championships in 1983 and 1984, the 31–4 Trojans entered the matchup with No. 1 and undefeated Texas as the underdog.\n\n\n=== Texas Longhorns ===\n\nThe Longhorns, who represented the University of Texas in Austin, Texas, were led by head coach Jody Conradt, in her 10th season at the school. Texas opened the season ranked No. 1 in the AP poll, a place they remained for the entirety of the season. The team earned ten wins over ranked opponents including a win over No. 4 USC on December 10.\nIn the NCAA tournament, Texas defeated Missouri, No 19 Oklahoma, and No. 11 Ole Miss to reach the first NCAA Final Four in program history. They won 90–65 over No. 5 Western Kentucky in the national semifinal to reach the national championship game with a 33–0 record.\n\n\n== Starting lineups ==\n\n\n== Game summary ==\n\n\n== Media coverage ==\nThe game was broadcast on CBS.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "In 1941, Syria became an independent country and was recognized by Switzerland four years later. From 1946 to 1958, Switzerland's diplomatic representation in Damascus consisted of a chancery, which was later replaced by a consulate general. Finally, in 1962, this was elevated to the status of a full embassy. In September 2005, the Swiss ambassador Jaques de Watteville described his country's relations with Syria as \"very good relations.\" On 18 August 2011, the Syrian ambassador to Bern was summoned for consultations against the backdrop of escalating violence. As a result of the Syrian conflict, the Swiss embassy was closed in 2012. On 8 March 2022, Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad received the credentials of the non-resident Swiss chargé d'affaires.\nOn 3 March 2023, the Swiss Federal Council announced the easing of sanctions on Syria.\n\n\n== See also ==\nForeign relations of Syria\nForeign relations of Switzerland\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "L&T-class Cadet Training Ship are a series of three cadet training ships (CDTs) being built for the Indian Navy by L&T Shipbuilding in Kattupalli Shipyard near Chennai, India.\n\n\n== Design ==\nThe L&T-class training vessels have a length of 122 meters and a beam of 18 meters with a displacement of around 4,700 tonnes and a design speed of over 20 knots. These vessels will have an endurance of 60 days. The ship has a range of 1,2070 km at 15 knots. The ship can accommodate 20 officers, 150 sailors, and 200 cadets. The training vessels will have three classrooms with space for 70 cadets each, a chart house, and special training bridges for cadets. The CTS will feature a quick-reaction team room, magazines and weaponry supplies, and distinct spaces for mechanical and aircraft. Additionally, they will have logistical areas like quarter-decks, boat decks, accommodation ladders, and galleys. The ships will have an automatic \"Helo landing and traversing system\" for on-board helicopter operations. Armaments include OTO Melara 76 mm naval gun, 2 AK-630 CIWS  and 12.7 mm calibre machine guns equipped with each Fire Control System. The vessels are based on an GSL's in-house design.\nFollowing the basic training, these ships will support the at-sea training of officer cadets, including female cadets, to fulfil the future requirements of the Indian Navy. In an effort to improve diplomatic ties, the ships would also train cadets from friendly nations. The ships can also be used for evacuation of people and Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR).\n\n\n== Construction history ==\nOn 7 March 2023, the Ministry of Defence awarded the contract for three Cadet Training Ships to Larsen & Toubro. The cost of the project amounts to ₹3,108.09 crore (US$390 million). Under the Buy (Indian-IDDM) Category, L&T will design, develop, and manufacture these ships indigenously. As per the contract, the delivery of the ships will commence from 2026.\nThe main contractor is L&T Defence, while the ships will be built in the facilities of L&T Shipbuilding. Bharat Electronics signed a ₹8.47 billion (US$110 million) contract with L&T in March 2024 to supply 14 types of communications and electronic warfare systems for the cadet training ships.\nOn 25 February 2024, the keel of the first Cadet Training ship was laid. The ceremony was presided by Rear admiral Ravi Kumar Dhingra, Flag Officer Tamil Nadu and Puducherry Area and presence of other important officers.\nOn 20 April 2024, steel cutting ceremony of the third ship was held in Kattupalli Shipyard.\n\n\n== Ships in class ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nINS Tir (A86)\nFuture of the Indian Navy\nTraining ships of the Indian Navy\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Capture of St. Michael (Danish; Kapre af St. Michael) or the Seizure of St. Michael, was a Danish seizure of a Bengali ship in the Bay of Bengal. The Danes captured the Bengali ship and the vessel was subsequently incorporated into the Danish Navy given the name St. Michael.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nIn 1625 the Danish vessel, Jupiter was lost off the coast of Odisha in Bengal along with its men and goods, which resulted in the imprisonment of the captain and his crew by local Bengali authorities. Similar events happened to Nattergalen in 1626 and St. Jacob in 1640. Such considerable losses could not be tolerated by Danish India, and in 1642 governor Bernt Pessart declared war on the Mughal Empire to retaliate for their initial losses. Pessart was afterwords deposed, and Willem Leyel assumed office.\n\n\n== Capture ==\nLeyel resumed privateering against the Bengalis, when he put the vessel Fortuna at sea. At sea it confronted a Bengali ship, which was on is way home from the Maldive islands. On board were coconut fibre and Crownies, which in ancient time were used as jewellery and as local Indian currency. When the Bengali captain (a Nakoda) saw the Fortuna he figured that resistance was to be useless, and so he jumped into a boat with some ambergris and other goods and fled. The Bengali captain also took the sails, presumably in the hope that the Danes would have hardship to remove the ship.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nDespite new sails the ship still sailed very slow, so Leyel sailed ahead to Emeldy, where he would wait a fortnight before the prize arrived. When arriving at Emeldy the prize was incorporated into the Dano-Norwegian Navy, and since it was seized on St. Michael's Day, it received the name St Michael.\n\n\n=== St Michael in Danish service ===\nDuring the rest of Leyel's regime St Michael would be one of four Danish ships that were active in the East Indies. In October 1644 St Michael was nearly wrecked in a storm. It lost both anchors and the crew were stranded on a coast near Narasapuram, though they managed to safe the ship by cutting the mainmast. In February 1645 it was sent to a Dutch shipyard at Cotiari to be repaired, and later in 1645 it would set sail for Queda (Kedah) on the basis of trade.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTillali Massacre – Massacre and Battle in Tillali, India 1756\nDannemarksnagore – City/town in West Bengal, IndiaPages displaying wikidata descriptions as a fallback\nBengal Subah – Subdivision of the Mughal Empire\nCattle War – Conflict between Danish India and the Thanjavur Maratha kingdom\nLoss of the St. Jacob – Seizure of a Danish ship by Benglis\nDano-Mughal War – Danish colonial conflict against the Mughal Empire\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Book sources ===\nWellen, Kathryn (2015).

        "content": "Battle of Zabłocie - Battle fought between the Peasant Battalions and Home Army and the Ukrainian Police and SS Galizien division and German forces, which ended in a Polish Victory\n\n\n== Before battle ==\nDespite the advent of temporary calm after the previous battles, before the battle of Zabłocie,  describe this temporary calm as the calm before the storm. The partisan unit of \"Rysia\" (Stanislaw Basaj) was already in practice a battalio, because apart from our 5 platoons the unit of \"Rysia\" was joined by the unit of the Civil Self-Defence from Iwanicz, from beyond the Bug River. Such a well-armed detachment became the subject of efforts of both the Home Army and us BCh to incorporate it into their ranks.The temporary situation supported by the efforts of \"Rysio\" and \"Stępień\" (Stanisław Hulak, the head of the Headquarters of \"Rysio\"), made the Volhynian detachment go over to Rysio. Reinforced in this way, the \"Rysia\" Battalion decided to strike at the USN(Ukrainian Self-Defence)UPA base in Sahryń. This village was manned by a strong 22-strong detachment of Ukrainian police and served as a recruitment base for the 14th SS-Galizien Rifle Division. It was also a food base. Nestled in Sahryń were hidden USN-UPA units nested in Sahryń. From here, there were constant raids on villages iinhabited by the Polish population. This had to be stopped, so \nIn the evening of 13 February 1944, a flurry of activity broke out in the platoons. A rumour spread that they were to strike Sahryn. Many of them also, received orders to organise a sledge - the reason for this action. Horses with sledges were hired from Lachowski Jozef of Zablocie to carry out the action. A total of 10 sledges + 3 of the Battalion's own wagons were organised. The first sledges including went to the assembly point in Modryń. In the end, the operation on Sahryń did not take place, as the Germans' actions thwarted the plans. In the morning of 14 February 1944, a detachment of SS police arrived in Mircz from the direction of Hrubieszów. SS police. At the same time, from the southern side, from Łasków, gendarmes broke in mi from Dołhobyczów and auxiliary forces of Ukrainian police. The German detachment from Mircz began a march towards the village of Górka (left wing) and towards the Laskowski forest (right wing). Somewhere from Kryłów lurked the detachments of the guns closing the ring of encirclement. The 4th platoon of \"Szczygieł\", which remained on guard, was inside it The IV platoon of \"Szczygieł\" (Feliks Zwolak) and the Volhynian team of \"Kozak\". After the three columns reached the Zabłocie colliery, an unequal battle began - the defence of Zablocie by the \"Szczygieł\" platoon (40 partisans) against about 270 SS men armed to the teeth with machine guns. Attacking from three sides,The Germans were pushing towards Zablocie the BCh and Home Army posts they encountered on the way, as well as small groups and individual partisans. In this way, the incomplete platoon of \"Hardy\" (Mieczysław Olszak) was thrown out of Olszynka into the Wólczański forest. Pew number of partisans from the Łasków colony made their way to the Małkowski forest. Still others, like the Home Army post from Górki with one machine gun, withdrew directly to the.\nThe partisans therefore occupied the lyser of the Małków forest preparing for an assault. The Germans at this time moved towards . Górka penetrating the last street from the Zabłocie side. The assault began with shouts of \"Hurrah\". The partisans threw themselves into the attack. Boldly striking, they conquered an area of several hundred metres stretching to the west of the forest. The Germans, with the guerrillas in their sights, hidden behind the ruins and partly behind the buildings, pressed them down into the snow with massive machine-gun fire. The positional battle became for the partisans disastrous.\n\n\n== Battle ==\nThe team from Prehoryłe withdrew from the fight. To make matters worse, the AK platoon of \"Hardy\" with an erkaem did not enter the fight, because Hardy\" himself decided to make a wide detour to avoid the Germans who were giving the on Górka. However, he was too late with this manoeuvre. A small group of \"Szczygieł\" managed to, however, managed to enter the Birkenau area on Górki with its left wing, without erkaem and other machine guns and could do little. In this catastrophic situation came to the aid of the assault group commanded by \"Rysio\" and \"Kozak\".  found myself in the morning of 14 February 1944 in the colliery Modryń. Here the sounds of battle and news messengers arrived too late. The command hesitated. We had to leave Modryń col. Detachment towards the battle to the east of the road, meant discovering the concentration of the Detachment. Thus the trump card for jumping the base in Sahryń was dropped. Increasing gunfire and news from there tipped the scales. Sahryń was postponed and it was decided to clarify the situation in the eastern theatre of the battle. Ryś\" was afraid for his poorly armed men in Zabłocie. They rushed to help.\n\nIncreasing gunfire and news from there tipped the scales. Sahryń was postponed and it was decided to clarify the situation in the eastern theatre of the battle. Ryś\" was afraid for his men in Zabłocie, who were poorly armed. They rushed to help. With about 25 partisans on three sledges, armed with 3 erkaemes, we crossed the road, heading for the southern tip of the Szychowicki forest. To the south of the forest, separated by meadows and a ditch and then fields, rising slightly uphill, was the Górki col. There one could hear the dense firing of machine guns and individual rifles. Somewhere there was a fierce battle going on.\nThe Germans began to retreat to the west, and at the level of the buildings of Szczur's farmhouse to turn south-west, towards Laskowski forest.  The right wing commanded by \"Kozak\" clashed directly with the Germans. Wounded was \"Kozak\", partisans were killed, others wounded, seriously and lightly. The \"Kozak's\" strike smashed the Germans' defence but failed to close the way for them westwards towards Mircz. It only penetrated their section of the defence. And so a group of Germans, located more to the east was surrounded by the left wing of \"Rys\" from the east and part of the right wing of \"Kozak\". From there the mentioned group of 50-odd Germans found themselves in the eastern cauldron - between \"Szczygiel\" from Zabloo from the south-east, between \"Rys\" from the east and \"Koźak\" from the east. - from the east and \"Kozak\" - from the west. The encircled group of Germans was threatened with destruction. Therefore, the only way out of the cauldron was in the direction of Szczur - south-west. Another conclusion is that the manoeuvre group of \"Hardy\" from the Home Army, did not had not yet managed to close the road for the Germans on the retreating direction (to Szczur), to the Łasków forest\nFor the time being, the Germans retreating with the Ukrainians from Gorki along the Krylov road to Mircze split into two groups. The first one went along the road to Mircze, and the second one was still fighting with \"Kozak\", acting as a covering group for the retreating Germans. The first group of retreating Germans to the village of Mircze fought a short and fierce battle with a barrage group of partisans near Brzozowski's mill. This group managed to slipped out of the western cauldron to the north, at an altitude of about 500 metres behind west of the Szychowice forest headland. After retreating to the Mircze meadows, the Germans took up  defensive positions over a deep ditch running from west to east. A positional battle began. The partisans attacked and the Germans defended themselves. There were about 20 of them with one machine gun\nThis was the main danger for the Germans - not a single partisan. So he could finally reach for the German rifle. This game with the Germans was interrupted by an unusual event. It saved the Germans from inevitable death or captivity. For the Germans had apparently run out of ammunition. They fired infrequently, even very infrequently. Then salvation came to them from the south - a lucky lottery ticket, a rare visitor to the battlefields. From the south - a determined attack of an unrecognised enemy, wielding machine guns, came at the partisans from behind from the Malkowski forest. It looked as if the partisans had turned from a hunter into a hare. By encircling the Germans defending themselves in the meadow, they themselves were in turn encircled. Perhaps it was a group of Germans who had organised the survivors from under the Brzozowski mill and now came to the relief of the Germans in the meadow. The partisans of the barrage group gave up fighting the Germans. As one, they picked themselves up from the ground and began to withdraw from the fields and meadow of kol. Mircze to the north - in the direction of Anusin.\n\n\n== Aftermatch ==\nAfter the battle, it turned out that it was not the Germans who attacked the barrage group, but the platoon of \"Hardego\" (Mieczysław Olszak) platoon. It joined (as we remember) the barrage group in the Wólczański forest. From there it was to carry out an entry manoeuvre to the rear of the Germans, who, after burning down Zabłocie, had moved to the Górki colliery. This manoeuvre, unfortunately, he did not made it in time. This way, he could not block the path of the first German group retreating to Lodz. retreating to Łasków from the eastern cauldron, nor could he block the way for the second group from the western cauldron, from the mill.the western one, from under the Brzozowski mill. To make matters worse, he mistakenly attacked the barrage group, helping a third group of Germans to leave the western cauldron, escaping from the Mircze meadows \nDespite the escape of the Germans, the strength of the Home Army and the peasant battalions managed to stop the pacification of the villages , and still inflict heavy losses on the Germans, and the only thing that saved the Germans was the mistaken recognition of the Home Army who mistook their own forces for the Germans.\n\n\n== References ==",

Prior to the first meeting, a St Louis fan podcast, the Soccer Capitol Podcast, became the center of attention and heightening tensions between supporters. A series of emails from Sporting Kansas City's front office arrived in the inbox of the podcast's Gmail account. The club believed the Soccer Capitol Podcast was infringing on the trademark “The Soccer Capital of America,” which was registered to Kansas Training Partners LLC, an affiliate company of Sporting Kansas City. St. Louis City won the first meeting at CityPark in May 2023, but Sporting KC won the second meeting at Children's Mercy Park in September of that year.

Farmer recorded new vocals for some of the older tracks, which were originally released from 1986 to 1995; this is likely due to the fact that Universal Music retains the rights to the original versions of these songs.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRemix XL at Discogs (list of releases)",

        "content": "The Worker: Dominion and Form (German: Der Arbeiter. Herrschaft und Gestalt) is a 1932 book by the German writer Ernst Jünger.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nInfluenced by the experience of World War I and the fragility of the Weimar Republic, Jünger sought to formulate a sustainable model for modern life through something he called the \"worker\". A central argument in the book is that what may appear as nihilism may instead be understood as failures to recognise shifts in the dominating metaphysics of a society, and the worker is presented as someone who keeps up with the shift away from bourgeois values. The arguments of the book are related to concepts Jünger had developed in his 1930 essay \"Total Mobilisation\".\n\n\n== Reception ==\nScholars and critics have discussed what the book means with its terms \"worker\" and \"Gestalt\", and how its content relates to the Enlightenment, bourgeois society, history and the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche. The book had significant influence on Martin Heidegger's philosophy of technology.\nJünger published a comment on The Worker in 1964 titled Maxima–Minima. In this and other later works, such as An der Zeitmauer (1959) and Der Weltstaat (1960), he developed his views of technology and the worker. He argued that war is what drives technology and science, and that the logic of war, which is the basis for the logic of the worker, cannot be tamed by rules and laws, and the worker is by extension in conflict with both the nation state and the individual.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNorthwestern University Press",

        "content": "Center of the Universe is an album by the American band Giant Sand, released in 1992. It was the first Giant Sand album to receive wide distribution and a traditional promotional campaign. It was also the band's first album for Restless Records, which had rereleased a couple of older Giant Sand albums. The band supported Center of the Universe with a North American tour.\n\n\n== Production ==\nRecorded in Venice, California, the album was produced by the band; they did not want a traditional producer suggesting or correcting musical ideas. Giant Sand entered the studio with songs for half an album, and had to finish the rest of the songs during the sessions. Many of the songs are about characters on the fringes of society. Vicki Peterson and Susan Cowsill, credited as the Psycho Sisters, provided backing vocals on some of the tracks. Victoria Williams contributed vocals to the title track.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nThe Philadelphia Inquirer noted that \"leader Howe Gelb continues to write ragged songs that refuse to adhere to a narrative track.\" Robert Christgau praised \"Thing Like That\" and the title track. Trouser Press said that \"the heads-down rockism of the loud'n'proud Center of the Universe is clearly descended from Crazy Horse, particularly when Convertino and bassist Joey Burns lock into a groove as primordial as the one that propels the harsh 'Seeded ('tween Bone and Bark)'.\" The Washington Post deemed it a \"post-punk version of country-rock.\"\nUSA Today noted that the band \"embraces both pop structure and punk abandon.\" Spin determined that the album \"opens with an explosion of pointy guitar noise worthy of the meanest Lower East Side cluster-hunch, and coalesces into a wide brainful of songs describing the world as seen from the window of a mobile home falling through deep space.\" The Vancouver Sun opined that \"Gelb songs sound likes he's using guitar strings about the size of trans-Atlantic cable, plucked with chunks of floor tile and sung in a borderline psychotic drawl.\"\nAllMusic wrote that Giant Sand \"assays another fascinating set of desert-fried rock & roll, serving up one winner after another on this excellent album.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Nadia Ahmed (born 15 June 2000), known professionally as Nxdia, is an English alt-pop musician. Born in Heliopolis in Egypt, they moved to Manchester aged eight, and began producing their own music after taking a course taught by Everything Everything. Ahmed released the EPs IDC and In the Flesh, and then the single \"She Likes a Boy\", which charted at No. 74 on the UK Singles Sales Chart. A member of Loud LDN, Ahmed's music makes regular use of Arabic and vocal runs.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nNadia Ahmed was born in Cairo on 15 June 2000, and grew up next to Roxy Cinema in Heliopolis. Their grandfather is of Sudanese descent. Their father listened to AC/DC and their mother listened to traditional Arabic acts such as Umm Kulthum, and would take Ahmed to Free Palestine protests from the age of eleven. Their first song was a whimsical track about Hawaii, which they had not yet been to; by nine, their tracks were about identity and self-perception. Nxdia and their family moved to the UK at the age of eight, relocating to Manchester from Egypt; upon arrival, they took up African drumming at a local community centre in Hulme. Their first works were uploaded to YouTube and Instagram, and aged sixteen, they enrolled on Levi Music Project, a two-week group course in which the band Everything Everything taught twelve young people how to produce their own music.\nIn 2020, they began uploading content to TikTok, including music and discussion of race; by September 2022, they had over 700,000 subscribers on the platform. They released a single, \"Ouch!\", in 2021, about disappointment with being upset with a friend, followed by the single \"Get Between It\", released later that year. They released an EP, IDC, in 2023, followed by another EP In the Flesh that August, which dealt with overthinking; the latter's focus track, \"Decay\", was written about the 2021–present United Kingdom cost-of-living crisis. After discovering old diary pages which detailed their teenage infatuation for a girl and their disappointment at finding that she was attracted to a boy, they wrote \"She Likes a Boy\", which made reference to Katy Perry's \"Teenage Dream\". They began uploading snippets of the song to TikTok in November 2023 and released the track in January 2024; DIY described the track as a \"queer anthem\", and the following month the track spent a week at No. 74 on the UK Singles Sales Chart. A subsequent track, \"Jennifer's Body\", described their experience of a toxic relationship, and took its name from the Megan Fox film of the same name on the grounds that watching the film helped them frame their thoughts.\n\n\n== Artistry ==\nIn an interview with the Spotlight On podcast in November 2023, Ahmed stated that they listened to My Chemical Romance and Fall Out Boy as a teenager, and that they found Pink's androgynous appearance gamechanging, having discovered her via her music video for \"So What\". They also mentioned that they were fans of Hole and the Smashing Pumpkins, and that they spent a period obsessed with a cover version of the traditional Arabic song \"Betnadini Tany Leh\" by Donia, on the grounds that she had not changed the lyrics from male to female. They also noted in a July 2023 interview with 15questions.net that they also listened to Babymetal and Jon Bellion around this time. They told NME in March 2024 that their sound had been inspired by the likes of Paramore, My Chemical Romance, and Simple Plan, and that they took further inspiration from Marina Diamandis's \"weirdly operatic\" voice and from the bilingualism of Stromae, specifically finding the latter's androgynous appearance in the music video \"Tous les mêmes\" helpful in discovering their own identity. In an interview with Dork the following month, they cited Paramore, Fall Out Boy, Stromae, and My Chemical Romance for their \"big choruses, catchy but often sad lyrics, and driving guitar parts\".\nAhmed's music constitutes alt-pop, alternates between English and Arabic, and includes regular vocal runs. They told NME that they sung in Arabic to share the language, as they had previously only used the language to converse with their mother. Ahmed is a member of Loud LDN, a collective of London-based women and genderqueer musicians founded in May 2022.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nEPs\n\nIDC (2023)\nIn the Flesh (2023)\nSingles\n\n\"Ouch\" (2021)\n\"She Likes a Boy\" (2023)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ali bin Mujathal al-Mughaidi (Arabic: علي بن مجثل المغيدي) was the ruler of 'Asir Province and the Tihamah in the 19th century, starting in 1826 and ending with his death in 1833. Ali bin Mujathal, alongside his maternal brother and cousin Sa'id bin Musalat, resisted against the forces of the Ottoman Empire that were led by Muhammad Ali Pasha.\n\n\n== Reign ==\nAfter the death of Sa'id bin Musalat in the year 1826, the people of 'Asir pledged allegiance to Ali bin Mujathal, which officially started his reign. Ali bin Mujathal's rule was described as a generally peaceful one, and he also managed to fight off several attempted invasions by the Ottoman Empire. His growing power and influence approaching Yemen was worrying to Muhammad Ali Pasha, who ordered his own governors and nobles to write letters discouraging him from entering Yemen. Ali bin Mujathal disregarded the criticisms and invaded Yemen anyways, securing his rule over several parts that were previously taken by the Ottomans. His rule would eventually extend, its influence reaching all the way until Najran in the southeast.\n\n\n== Religious views ==\nAli bin Mujathal was a devout Sunni Muslim. Like the majority of the citizens of 'Asir, he was a follower of the Shafi'i school of thought. He was also an Athari in his creed, and followed the doctrine of Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab. The emergence of the Salafi movement in 'Asir also occurred during his reign.\n\n The religion is a middle ground between us and those who claim it. Following [a practice in religion] must be backed with evidence. What Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, and his companions were upon in their time, and heresy is what was introduced after them.\n    - Ali bin Mujathal al-Mughaidi, to the scholar Ibrahim bin Ahmad al-Hafzi  \n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nAli bin Mujathal contracted an illness in 1833 after his return from Yemen. He died in the same year. He was succeeded by Aidh bin Mar'i al-Yazidi, who founded the Al Aidh Emirate. He has a son named Abdullah whose descendants, the Al-Mujathal family, are still around and they live in 'Asir Province.\n\n\n== See also ==\nIdrisid Emirate of Asir\nAl Aidh Emirate\nEmirate of Diriyah\nOttoman-Wahhabi War\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Texas Flood is a Serbian blues rock band formed in Belgrade in 2006. In the years following the formation, the band have established themselves as one of the most prominent blues rock acts of the Serbian rock scene.\n\n\n== History ==\nTexas Flood was formed in 2006 by guitarist and vocalist Nenad Zlatanović, a former junior wrestling state champion and chief of security in a number of Belgrade clubs. Zlatanović chose the name for the band after the blues standard \"Texas Flood\" by Larry Davis. After a number of lineup changes, the band got a permanent drummer when it was joined by former Riblja Čorba and Bajaga i Instruktori member Vladimir Golubović.\nThe band released their debut album, entitled Grinnin' In Your Face, in 2009. All the songs on the album were authored by Zlatanović, and it was produced by Vladimir Negovanović, also a former Bajaga i Instruktori member. The title track is a cover of a song by Son House, and the album also included a cover of the song \"Mr. Big\" by Free. Bass guitar on the album was played by Bata Božanić (formerly of Suncokret) and Dragan Ivanović, and the album featured guest appearances by American musician Billy Gibson on harmonica, Austrian musician Raphael Wressnig on organ, and Hungarian musician Little G Weevil on guitar and vocals. Following the album release, the group performed on a number of blues festivals, and on 18 October 2009 they performed as the opening band for ZZ Top on their concert in Belgrade Arena.\nIn 2013, Zlatanović released the solo album Naked Blues under the name Mr. Swagger, on which he recorded his own songs, as well as covers of blues classics in acoustic arrangements. In 2009, Texas Flood released the album Tražim ljude kao ja (I'm Looking for the People Like Me), named after a verse from the song \"Negde daleko\" (\"Somewhere Far Away\") by Pop Mašina. The album featured covers of songs by Yugoslav rock acts Bijelo Dugme, Tihomir \"Pop\" Asanović, Pop Mašina, Rok Mašina, Lačni Franz, Time and Azra, as well as one song composed by the Zlatanović, \"Da budem tvoj\" (\"To Be Yours\"). The lyrics for the song were co-authored by Ivan Ristić and Irie FM frontman Vukašin Marković.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nGrinnin' In Your Face (2009)\nTražim ljude kao ja...

        "content": "The former municipality of Sant Gervasi de Cassoles (in Spanish, San Gervasio de Cassolas), annexed to Barcelona in 1897, extended over a large part of the former district III of Barcelona, to the northwest of the city, between the municipalities, also formerly independent, of Sarrià, Les Corts de Sarrià, Gràcia and Horta.\nCurrently the old nucleus of Sant Gervasi de Cassoles is divided into two neighborhoods of the district of Sarrià-Sant Gervasi called: Sant Gervasi-La Bonanova and Sant Gervasi-Galvany. The oldest and most central part of Sant Gervasi de Cassoles is located in the district of Sant Gervasi - la Bonanova, in the Sant Gervasi sector of this district, and in Sant Gervasi-Galvany is the lowest part of the old municipality.\nThe name of Sant Gervasi de Cassoles corresponds to the invocation of a primitive rural chapel or church, named already in 987 (actually, the invocation was to the saints Gervasi and Protasi, twin martyrs). The origin of Cassoles is more uncertain, being able to come from:\n\nFrom a derivative of \"isolated houses\" (casas aisladas) added to \"solas\" (the fogatge — direct tax created by Pedro IV of Aragon— of 1359 there were only seven houses). Thus, it would be a contraction of isolated houses + solas: cassoles.\nOf the possible existence of brickworks who made cassoles.\nOf casules (small houses, which were named as cassolas by the rector Gaietà Llaró, when answering in 1789 to the questionnaire made by Francisco de Zamora).\nIn 1789 most of the houses were isolated masías surrounded by woods, fields and vines; crops were mainly rainfed and there were six pairs of oxen to till the land; the main farms were wheat, barley and millet.\nThe chapel of Saints Gervasius and Protasius has kept its original location (where the Bonanova church is), and until the 18th century the main dedication, since an altar was added with an image of the Mare de Déu dels Afortunats or Bonanova, which displaced the cult of the twin saints.\nThe primitive nucleus of the village was formed around the church and the road that led to it (today's Sant Gervasi de Cassoles street).\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n The consensus on this census chart does not allow the addition of census data to the chart, so the data following the 2021 census will be the 2031 census.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFormer Municipalities of Barcelona\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Additional references ===\n\"«Alteraciones de los municipios en los Censos de Población desde 1842»\".

        "content": "Eolipotes is an extinct genus of marine \"river dolphin\" of the family Lipotidae. It is the oldest known member of the family, having lived in what is now Japan during the Tortonian stage of the Late Miocene. Fossils of this animal are known from the Tochigi prefecture (Ogane or Tanokura Formation) and the Gunma prefecture (Haraichi Formation). Eolipotes was a small cetacean, with the skull indicating a length of around 2.17 m (7 ft 1 in). In spite of its name, Eolipoteshas been found to be more closely related to the genus Parapontoporia, which could indicate that some species of Paraprotoporia and the baiji became freshwater animals independently from one another. However it is also possible that they all evolved from ancestors that already inhabited estuaries, with Eolipotes simply becoming more marine. The genus only includes a single species: E. japonicus.\n\n\n== History and naming ==\nEolipotes was described in 2024 on the basis of two fossil specimens discovered in the Kanto region of Japan, specifically the prefectures of Gunma and Tochigi. The holotype specimen was discovered in 2012 by Yukinori Hamada and subsequently excavated by the combined efforts of the Kaijo Junior & Senior High School's geology club and the Tochigi Prefectural Museum. The material, which consists of a skull and other assorted fossil material, clearly belonged to at least two individuals given the presence of three tympanic bullae recovered from the site. The second specimen, designated the paratype and consisting of a partial skull, was collected by Hajime Nakajima from outcrops near the Usui River in the Gunma Prefecture, south-west of where the holotype originated. The holotype was found in the Kinugawa River, with the geology of the locality indicating that it stems from either the upper parts of the Ogane Formation or the lower units of the Tanokura Formation, both of which indicate that the material is Tortonian in age. The paratype also dates to the Tortonian, with the specific sediments providing more a more precise age estimate, narrowing the age down to 11.29 – 11.25 million years. However, the paratype stems from the Haraichi Formation, which is part of the Annaka Group.\nThe name Eolipotes is a simple combination between the Latin word \"eo\" meaning early and Lipotes, the genus name of the Holocene Baiji or Yangtze river dolphin, drawing attention to the fact that Eolipotes is the oldest precisely dated member of the family Lipotidae. The species name references the fossils country of origin, Japan.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe skull of Eolipotes has been noted for its small size, with the holotype specimen only meassuring around 14.4 cm (5.7 in) across the widest point of the skull. The rostrum is not fully preserved in either specimen, making it impossible to say how long the snout would have been, but it does show that it was proportionally narrow, widening the closer it gets to the facial region. The rostrum displays a noticeable construction at its base, corresponding to the endpoint of the alveolar groove, before the skull widens abruptly around the maxillary eminence.\nThe premaxillae dorch over the dorsal-most surface of the rostrum, initially convex but gradually transitioning to having a concave surface towards the back as they contribute to the central basin, a shallow depression in the skull. The extent of the basin is similar to what is seen in other lipotids, with the depth being most similar to that of Parapontoporia wilsoni. A unique feature of the skull of Eolipotes that differentiates it from other lipotids is that the nasals actually come into context with the nasal bones, which could be a basal trait lost in the other genera of the family. The maxillae form the majority of the rostrum and house the alveolar groove, though the individual dental alveoli are poorly known due to what might be preservation. A deep medial sulcus stretches across the ventral surface of the rostrum, giving the crosssection the shape of an upside-down U. Such a sulcus is especially well developed in longirostrine cetaeans like the related Parapontoporia and eurhinodelphids and may serve to strengthen the rostrum. Around the base of the rostrum, the maxilla forms an elliptical structure interpreted to represent the maxillary eminence, at which point the bones widen significantly as they transition to the facial region. Just behind and next to the eminence there is a small ridge, thought to be the maxillary crest which is better developed and Parapontoporia and Lipotes. The left maxilla features two dorsal infraorbital foramina, the more anterior of which is similar in its location to that in modern baijis. The posterior limits of the maxillae on the underside of the skull might preserve the contact between maxillae and palatines, which in turn informs the limit of the pterygoid sinus fossa. Judging from this, the fossa may have ended at or behind the antorbital notch, making it shorter than that of other lipotids. Towards the back of the skull the maxillae approach each other again and come into contact with the raised frontal bones that forms part of the cranial vertex.\nThe nasal bones are the second element that contributes to the cranial vertex and are wide towards the front and narrow towards the back, with the fronals extending between the two nasals. The contact between nasals and frontals is difficult to observe on account of these bones having almost fused into a singular element. When viewed from above, the vertex as formed by nasals and frontals is roughly triangular in shape, with the point facing towards the back. The frontal part of the vertex is pinched. While this is similar to what is seen in other lipotids, the same can be seen in some members of Inioidea and certain \"kentriodontids\".\nThe periotic bone, specifically the anterior bullar facet, is distinct in lipotids and serves to differentiate them from other dolphin groups. The anterodorsal part of the anterior process is especially noteworthy in Eolipotes, as it clearly sets it apart from Lipotes and Paraprotoporia. Whereas in Lipotes this region is rounded and in Paraprotoporia its notably less developed, the anterodorsal aspect of the anterior process is distinctly angled, which gives this element a rectangular appearance in profile view. The process further lacks the prominent ridges that are seen in the periotic of the baiji.\n50 teeth have been found around the holotype skull of Eolipotes, yet have not been assigned to the holotype. Regardless, these teeth are small and slender, with the tips curving back.\n\n\n=== Size ===\nSince the bizygomatic width of the skull is not known, Kimura and Hasegawa calculated the body length of Eolipotes based on the width across the postorbitals, reasoning that the values are generally similar in delphinids. Their results indicate that Eolipotes may have grown to a length of 2.17 m (7 ft 1 in).\n\n\n== Phylogeny ==\nThe type description conducted a phylogenetic analysis based on the supermatrix established by the authors in 2019, itself based on prior supermatrices by Lambert et al. (2017) and Peredo et al. (2018). The two specimens were combined into a single operational taxonomic unit representative of the species for the analysis rather than being scored individually. Finally the analysis was conducted both with equally weighting and implied weighting, tho the trees of both results are much the same and conform with prior results.\nThe results differ primarily in the relationship between Lipotids and other dolphin groups, with equal weighting placing them as the sister group to Inioidea (South American river dolphins) and Delphinoidea (dolphins and porpoises) while implied weighting suggests them to form a monophyletic clade with inioids as well as some select \"kentriodontids\". Regardless of the relation between lipotids and other dolphins as a whole, both methods agree in the fact that Lipotidae is restricted to Lipotes, Eolipotes and Parapontoporia, with the latter two emerging as each other's closest relatives.\n\n\n== Evolutionary significance ==\nThough once thought to represent a single group, modern research has shown that the four Holocene river dolphin groups; Lipotidae, Iniidae, Platanistidae and Pontoporiidae; all represent independent instances of once marine forms invading freshwater habitats.\nAll three known lipotids show a different degree of affinity for freshwater, serving to show how members of a group could adapt to such vastly different environments. Eolipotes appears to have been the most marine taxon, whereas the baiji is only known from freshwater. Parapontoporia represents a mix of the two. While it was originally thought to be exclusively marine, more recent excavations have recovered Parapontoporia fossils from non-marine environments, leading to the idea that at least some may have been facultative or obligate freshwater animals. The significance of this becomes clear when considering the phylogeny, linking Eolipotes with Parapontoporia. Assuming that their ancestors were marine, this would mean that Eolipotes maintained their ancestral lifestyle whereas Lipotes and Parapontoporia represent two independent freshwater invasions within the same family. However Kimura and Hasegawa highlight how this interpretation is not set in stone, as it is also possible that ancestral lipotids could have already been inhabitants of river deltas as is seen in some modern dolphin populations. Should this be the case, the freshwater occurrences of some lipotids might just represent various degrees of additional specialisation rather than fully independent invasions into freshwater.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Mirza Ali (Persian: میرزا علی; c. 1509–1575) was a painter of Persian miniatures in the 16th and 17th centuries. He was the son of the prominent painter Sultan Mohammed (fl. 16th-century). Born in Tabriz, he was raised at the city's scriptorium, which belonged to the Safavid shah (king) Tahmasp I (r. 1524–1576).\nAccording to the contemporary Safavid historian Budaq Monshi Qazvini, Mirza Ali \"left for India after his father's death and prospered there\". Persian and Mughal art specialist Barbara Brend also suggests that Mirza Ali traveled to India in order to work in the Mughal court, even though she does not quote the source for this claim. Martin Bernard Dickson and Stuart Cary Welch suggest that Mirza Ali's career continued in Iran until around 1575, while Abolala Soudavar suggests that Mirza Ali accompanied Humayun to India and returned to Iran after the latters death in 1556.\nBrend considers Mirza Ali and Abd al-Samad to have been the same person, due to their stylistic similarities.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nCanby, Sheila R.

The Australian live music industry suffered significantly throughout 2020 and 2021 with many venues forced to close, and concert tours either cancelled or postponed. Goodrem's own tour for her album Bridge over Troubled Dreams (2021) was originally scheduled to occur in 2021, but was forced to reschedule twice due to ongoing restrictions. It eventually took place in 2022.\nThroughout the lifespan of the concert series, Goodrem and guitarist Matthew Copley livestreamed to Goodrem's social media platforms every Thursday evening from her house in Sydney. In a relaxed and impromptu manner, Goodrem engaged with fans and performed requests. Songs performed regularly included b-sides, rarities and album tracks from across her career, as well as unreleased songs and covers, usually centred around a theme for the week.\nOf the series, Goodrem said, “Every week people tuned in and we stayed connected. I got into music for unity – music is about bringing people together.”\n\n\n== Performances ==\n\nNotes:\n\n\n== See also ==\nImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the music industry\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Joan DelFattore (born 1946) is a professor emerita of English and legal studies at the University of Delaware. She is known for her advocacy of academic freedom and for her 1992 book What Johnny Shouldn't Read: Textbook Censorship in America; the book won the American Library Association's Eli M. Oboler Memorial Award (which is awarded for \"the best published work in the area of intellectual freedom\" ). She has also received awards from the Spencer Foundation, the Gustavus Myers Center, the American Educational Research Association, and the Delaware state affiliate of the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBorn in Newark, New Jersey, Joan DelFattore graduated in 1970 with a B.A. from Caldwell College (renamed in 2014 Caldwell University) and in 1976 with an M.A. from St. Bonaventure University. At Pennsylvania State University, she graduated in 1978 with an M.S. in clinical psychology and in 1979 with a Ph.D. in English. In 2011, as president of the Delaware chapter of the American Association of University Professors, she pointed out that the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution does not necessarily protect the freedom of speech of professors at public institutions and that, instead of relying on the First Amendment, professors at public institutions should consider \"defining academic freedom as a professional standard embodied in university policies.\" She was for more than thirty years a professor at the University of Delaware, During her academic career, she published three books with Yale University Press and many articles about freedom of speech. In 2014, she became professor emerita and established a program called \"Writing as Healing\" at Delaware's Christiana Care Health System. In the program, she taught techniques for reducing stress using writing by the program's participants.\nIn 2011, DelFattore was diagnosed with advanced gallbladder cancer. She relied on her network of friends and extended family to help her as she underwent surgery at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. After the surgery was performed, she went for chemotherapy. Because DelFattore was unmarried, the first oncologist she consulted recommended a milder, rather than a more aggressive, course of treatment. The oncologist wanted to avoid serious side effects of the more aggressive treatment because he believed that single people have less effective social support than married people. DelFattore went to another oncology and was given the harsher, more effective chemotherapy by her new oncologist, who accepted DelFattore's insistence that she had the necessary support. The surgery and chemotherapy were successful. In September 2019, The New England Journal of Medicine published DelFattore's article Death by Stereotype? Cancer Treatment in Unmarried Patients. The article examines 84 medical articles that use a huge National Cancer Institute database to show that unmarried patients are significantly less likely to receive surgery or radiotherapy than patients who are married. DelFattore's article suggests that many physicians believe in cultural stereotypes that cause such physicians to make inappropriate recommendations for unmarried cancer patients.\nIn recent years, DelFattore has held an appointment as a scholar in residence at the New York Public Library. She is an active member of PEN America, the Cosmos Club, the Wilmington, Delaware Rotary Club of Rotary International, the International Women's Forum, the New York chapter of the Mystery Writers of America, and the Authors Guild,.\nDelFattore gave a 2017 TEDx talk, Sick While Single? Don't Die of Discrimination and was interviewed on All Things Considered. Her articles about unmarried life and other topics have appeared in the Washington Post, the New York Herald Tribune, Psychology Today, Health Psychology, Psych Central, Quartz, and other popular news publications. She has appeared on many talk shows, including 20/20, The Diane Rehm Show, Radio Times with Marty Moss-Coane, Talk of the Nation, and Fresh Air. She lives in Newark, Delaware and frequently commutes to New York City.\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\n\n\n=== Articles ===\nMagill, Frank N., ed. (1981). \"Chapter.

        "content": "The Sobieski Oak (Polish: Dąb Sobieskiego) is an over 400-year-old specimen of pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) located within the Łężczok nature reserve, within the administrative boundaries of Racibórz. It is the thickest and oldest tree in Racibórz, the Łężczok reserve, and one of the three oldest and most magnificent trees in the Rudy Landscape Park. By the decision of the Presidium of the Provincial National Council in Opole dated 14 April 1967, it was designated a natural monument. It is surrounded by a small, wooden fence.\n\n\n== Description ==\nAt a height of 3.5 meters, the thick base of the tree bifurcates into two main trunks. There used to be a third trunk, which most likely was broken by the wind. Today, a sizable crack remains in the tree where this trunk once was. The circumference of the tree measured at ground level slightly exceeds 850 cm, while the circumference of the oak at a height of 1.3 m is 690 cm, and its height is 33 m. The impressive size and venerable age (over 400 years) make this oak the thickest and oldest tree in Racibórz, within the Łężczok nature reserve, and one of the three oldest and most magnificent trees in the Rudy Landscape Park.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe oak tree grows in the Łężczok nature reserve, along the avenue running along the embankment separating the Grabowiec and Brzeziniak ponds, named the Polish Hussars Alley. This alley is unique in terms of natural features, with the Sobieski Oak standing out prominently. It is traversed by the Polish Hussars Trail, a red tourist trail connecting the localities through which the army led by John III Sobieski passed in 1683 during the Battle of Vienna. It also serves as the border between Racibórz and the Gmina Nędza – the oak is located on its southern side, within the administrative boundaries of Racibórz. Nearby the oak, there is also a historic hunting lodge from the 18th century and a wooden cross commemorating a forest guard killed by a poacher.\n\n\n== Name and legends ==\nThe oak's name comes from a legend according to which the tree was planted to commemorate King John III Sobieski's stay in those areas during his march to the Battle of Vienna in 1683. This tradition was reinforced in the interwar period by Andrzej Czudek in his publications, considering it quite probable. However, it is known that this contradicts the truth because in 1683 the tree was already about 100 years old. It was most likely planted by the Cistercians, who used trees, mainly oaks, to line communication routes and embankments of fishponds. On the other hand, Jan Duda, in his publication Natural Features of Racibórz from 2001, writes about a legend according to which King John III Sobieski allegedly stopped under the oak while traveling to Vienna. The oak fits into the well-known tradition of Sobieski trees in Upper Silesia.\n\n\n== Legal protection and conservation efforts ==\n\nIn 1922, the entire area of Łężczok, which was then within the borders of Germany, was legally protected. After World War II, Poles also decided to protect this area by establishing it as a nature reserve in 1957. Ten years later, by decision of the Presidium of the Provincial National Council in Opole on 14 April 1967, the tree was granted individual protection, becoming a natural monument. The decision to recognize the tree as a natural monument was also reaffirmed by the Silesian Voivode in a regulation dated 9 March 2006.\nIn the 1970s, the crack left by the third trunk was sealed with a concrete plug by Franciszek Polaczek, a forester from Nędza, on his own initiative. However, it turned out that this plug accelerated the decay of the trunk. Around the year 2000, the plug began to visibly collapse until it finally collapsed completely in the summer of 2002, revealing a hole with a diameter of 1 m. Also in the 1970s, two trunks were encircled with a metal chain at a height of 10 m to protect them from splitting. However, the use of the metal chain caused the two main trunks of the oak to die due to pressure on the vascular cambium. During subsequent procedures, a significant portion of the lower branches was removed, thus changing the shape of the tree, which is now devoid of branches up to a considerable height. From 1993 to 1994, conservation work on the old oaks in Łężczok was carried out by Stefan Kisielewski, a specialist in tree care and protection. In 1998, employees of Piotr Kamiński's Tree Surgery and Care Department from Żory performed a full range of crown cuts on the oak, removed metal caps from places where branches had been cut, and cleared deep cavities. Since the metal chain at a height of 10 m did not provide full protection, an elastic tape with a strength of up to 8 tons was also installed at a height of 20 m.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of individual trees\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nŻukowski, Aleksander (2006).

It is her first song in two years following \"Giant\" in 2020. Ward stated that \"the addition of Aloe elevated this song and added depth that only an artist of his caliber can.\"\nA second single, \"Baby Don't\" featuring DijahSB, was released March 10, 2023. A music video for the solo version of the song was released March 24. The video is part one of a series of videos written, directed, and produced by Adam William Ward.\nThe third single, \"Ride Or Die\" featuring Vic Mensa, was released May 3, 2023. It is part two of the music video series.   \nThe fourth single, \"Forget About Us\", was released June 16, 2023.\nThe fifth single, \"On One\" featuring Jean Deaux, was released July 28, 2023.

It is the finale of the music video series.    \n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nDirty Shine received widespread critical acclaim. Critics praised Ward's versatility in blending the blues rock and hip-hop genres and her overall performance. Pete Francis from Blues Rock Review called the album \"different in a great way\", giving it an 8.5/10. He also named \"Ride Or Die\", \"Dead Or Alive\", \"Baby Don't\", \"Tin Cups\", and \"Don't Let Me Down\" standout tracks.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Norketotifen is a pharmaceutical medication which is not yet approved for use and is undergoing clinical trials. It is a biologically active demethylated metabolite of ketotifen and has a similar potency as ketotifen as an antihistamine medication and a mast cell stabilizer, yet is devoid of severe sedative effects of ketotifen, potentially allowing for higher doses to be administered without sedation as a limiting factor. Norketotifen is researched for its potential anti-inflammatory activity caused by dose-dependent inhibition of the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α,  and for its other potential properties.\n\n\n== Pharmaceutical properties ==\nA prodrug of norketotifen is ketotifen which was patented in 1970 by Sandoz Pharmaceuticals (currently a part of Novartis), a Swiss company, and came into medical use in 1976. Ketotifen can be considered a sedating prodrug that is converted to norketotifen, a nonsedating metabolite with anti-inflammatory properties, when used as an anti-inflammatory medication.\n\n\n== Research directions ==\n\n\n=== Influenza ===\nThe potential future applications of norketotifen, including a treatment for non-complicated influenza are researched by Emergo Therapeutics, a US company.\n\n\n=== Malaria ===\nNorketotifen, the de-methylated metabolite of ketotifen, has shown promising potential as an antimalarial drug, but the research is in the very early stage. Norketotifen has been found to be a more potent antimalarial in vitro compared to ketotifen, and it exhibited equivalent activity in vivo against asexual blood and developing liver-stage parasites. After ketotifen dosing, norketotifen levels were much higher than ketotifen relative to the IC50s of the compounds against Plasmodium falciparum in vitro. This suggests that the antimalarial activity of ketotifen in mice is mediated through norketotifen. Given these findings, future research could focus on further understanding the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of norketotifen, as well as its mechanism of action against Plasmodium falciparum. It would also be beneficial to investigate the drug's efficacy against other strains of Plasmodium and in different animal models. If norketotifen continues to show promising results in future studies, it could potentially be developed into a new antimalarial drug. This could be particularly valuable given the increasing resistance of malaria parasites to existing drugs.\n\n\n=== Sedation ===\nBoth ketotifen and its active metabolite norketotifen exist as optically active atropisomers. They both have antihistaminic and anti-inflammatory properties. However, the S-atropisomer of norketotifen (SN) causes less sedation than ketotifen and the R-atropisomer of norketotifen (RN) in rodents. The lower sedative effect of SN in rodents is probably due to a combination of a lower uptake of norketotifen than ketotifen into the brain and less affinity of SN for histamine H1 receptors in the central nervous system. This research direction could potentially lead to the development of antihistamines with reduced sedative effects.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "Chiizu Gyudon (Japanese: チーズ牛丼, Hepburn: Chīzu gyūdon, lit. 'Cheese beef bowl'), or simply Chigyu (Japanese: チー牛, Hepburn: Chī gyū) is a Japanese internet slang used to refer to so-called \"otaku\", and \"uncool\", \"introverted\" and \"gloomy\" people. It always regarded as a term of taunt, abuse and despise.\n\n\n== Character ==\nA chigyu is described as \"a somewhat disgusting otaku\" or \"a gloomy character with little sense of presence\". The slang mainly refers to gloomy males, but sometimes also used to refer to females with similar personalities.\nThe characteristics of chigyu including wearing glasses, having a \"childish hairstyle\", \"not a domineering face\",  childlike appearance, spiritually childish, \"although active online, appears gloomy in reality\". Besides, the chigyu has also been used to refer to the appearance similar to individuals with developmental disabilities or enlarged adenoids.\nThe Paper analyzed the \"childish\" of chigyu \"violates the ideal definition of adult male's'masculinity' in society\", and the image of chigyu shows a gloomy person in a lower social class who lacks socialize. It described chigyu as a discriminatory term on gender, body, and class.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin ===\n\nIn 2008, a doujinshi artist \"ibiryo\" drew a self portrait as a high school student and uploaded it to his blog, which later became the generic appearance of chigyu.\nOn 9 July 2018, a user said on 5channel's \"Nandemo Jikkyo J\" board:\n\nThe interesting thing about employment support services is that young male customers all look the same\nThe gloomy face\nWearing glasses\nBlack hair\nChildish hairstyles\nNot a domineering face\nChildlike appearance (in a negative way)\nIt's really creepy that they look like a high school student despite being an adult\n8 out of 10 grow like this\nhttps://i.imgur.com/akAJmjk.jpg\n\nCan tell from a person's face\nLater he added:\n\nAlthough only retard use employment support services, all customers really look the same\n80% of young men look like this\nAlthough many people say that retard cannot be identified with the eyes\nThis is just because those people who always talk about discrimination are too annoying, and there is no one to reveal the truth\n\nYou know...\nThe user used a negative perspective to describe \"chigyu face\" and associated it with otaku, so there are also criticisms that he is a lookist.\n\n\n=== Popularity ===\nThe post has received a lot of responses, most of responders claim that \"there are indeed people around who look like this\", and other discussion boards have also shown related discussions. In April 2019, a summary website reprinted a related discussion thread, making the term chigyu more widely spread. In June 2019, three different styles of chigyu illustrations (samurai, juvenile delinquent, and ikemen) were disseminated online. On C97, a male cosplay as a chigyu.\nIn April 2020, there were an average of 500-1000 tweets per day mentioning the term \"Chiizu Gyudon\", while there were an average of 100 tweets mentioning \"Chigyu\" per day. By June, the average number of tweets mentioning \"Chigyu\" per day had reached 10000.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Gyūdon chain stores ===\nIn June 2020, Japanese news website J-CAST News interviewed Zensho Holdings, which runs Sukiya, about this slang. The company's publicity department responded: \"Of course we know what chigyu is. That's our top popular product No.1, 'Gyudon with 3 Cheeses'. We hope our customers will continue to enjoy our products in the future. We will launch a new product, 'Cheese Beef Rib Gyudon', and welcome everyone to try it out in person.\" Disability information collection website shohgaisha.com pointed J-CAST News' report did not mention the relationship between 'chigyu' and individuals with developmental disabilities, just instead introduced it as a meme that mocks dull men to avoid stirring up controversy. The website also thought Sukiya actually knew the meaning of \"chigyu\", but due to fear of online debates, it shifted the focus to new products.\n\n\n=== Buzzword award ===\nThe term Chiizu Gyudon has been nominated for the Internet Buzzword Award 2020, and won third place at the Instagram Buzzword Award 2020.\n\n\n=== Application ===\nHong Kong activist Joshua Wong was known by Japanese netizens as the \"chigyu around Agnes Chow\" due to his looks like the generic appearance of chigyu. Wong responded positively to this, and Chow said that Wong was \"very happy about it and didn't take it to heart at all\". Wong later collaborated with a restaurant selling cheese beef bowls which were named after him.\nOn 28 July 2020, during the live broadcast of the Puyo Puyo Championships, Toshihiro Nagoshi commented on the entrants that \"looks like they like to eat chiizu gyudon\" and sparking controversy. Sega deleted the live playback on YouTube and re-uploaded it after removing the \"unpleasant parts\". Host Ayana Tsubaki apologized on Twitter.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Cavatine for Trombone and Piano, Op. 144, is a chamber music composition by French composer Camille Saint-Saëns, written in 1915. The piece was dedicated to George W. Stewart, a trombonist and the musical director of the 1915 World's Fair in San Francisco, where Saint-Saëns had participated in several concerts. Composed immediately after Saint-Saëns' return to Paris from the United States, the cavatina showcases the lyrical and vocal qualities of the trombone, despite its technical demands. The work was well received by Stewart and has since become one of the most popular solo pieces in the trombone repertoire.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Cavatine was composed in 1915 in connection with the composer's participation in the World's Fair in San Francisco. Saint-Saëns spent seven weeks at the fair, conducting three concerts devoted exclusively to his own works, including the orchestral piece Hail! California, which was composed specifically for the occasion. The musical events at the World's Fair were organized by George W. Stewart, a trained trombonist and former member of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, who had previously planned the musical presentations of the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis.\nSaint-Saëns' successful journey and good relationship with Stewart likely inspired him to thank the trombonist with a composition for his instrument. After leaving San Francisco on July 9 and sailing back to France from New York on July 17, Saint-Saëns composed the Cavatine immediately upon his return to Paris, completing it by early August. In a letter to Stewart dated 7 August 1915, Saint-Saëns wrote: \"In New York, on the ship, in Bordeaux it was not possible for me to write the piece I promised you. But right after I returned home, it was the first thing I worked on. It now has to make the long journey to you. It is at the copyist's, and I hope that you will receive it before the end of the month\".\nThe composer had a copy of the score made and autographed for Stewart before sending it, demonstrating his high regard for the trombonist. Upon receiving the score, Stewart sent a telegram effusively thanking Saint-Saëns: \"Delighted beyond measure with Cavatina. It is unquestionably the most beautiful composition ever written for trombone.\" Saint-Saëns remarked to his publisher with self-irony, \"As one knows, it is easy for the one-eyed man to be king in the country of the blind!\", referring to the sparse solo literature for trombone at the time.\nThe autograph score was used as the engraver's copy for the first edition, published by Durand in October 1915. It is unknown if the Cavatine was premiered during Saint-Saëns' lifetime, or if Stewart ever publicly performed the work dedicated to him. However, in 1922, the piece was selected by the Paris Conservatoire as an examination piece for the trombone class in honor of the late composer, with the public examination performance on June 24, 1922, possibly serving as the premiere.\n\n\n== Structure ==\nThe Cavatine, titled in reference to a shorter, rather unadorned operatic aria, deliberately evokes vocal music, and is written in D♭ major. Although the opening triadic arpeggios and scales are instrumental in nature, Saint-Saëns emphasizes the lyrical-cantabile aspect throughout the piece, allowing the trombone's vocal qualities to shine.\nThe work is demanding in terms of range, spanning from A♭1 to d♭2, with the latter appearing only once as the final note and a♭1 provided as an alternative. While the high register is challenging, it is not unusual compared to the orchestral literature of the time. Saint-Saëns himself regularly wrote for the first and second trombones up to a1 and b♭1 in his orchestral works, such as Danse macabre and the Organ Symphony, and even demanded a c2 from the first trombone in the final movement of his First Symphony.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nWhen the Cavatine was selected as an examination piece for the trombone class at the Paris Conservatoire in 1922, Parisian music critics were unfamiliar with the work. One reviewer even believed it to be an earlier examination piece, given the technical difficulties and the often very high register of the trombone part. Despite the growth of the solo repertoire for trombone since its composition, the Cavatine has maintained its place among the most popular performance pieces for the instrument. The work \"helps the trombone's vocal qualities to come into their own\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCavatine (Saint-Saëns): Scores at the International Music Score Library Project",

        "content": "\"In The Mean Time\" is a song by Italian gothic metal band Lacuna Coil. It was released as the second single from their upcoming tenth studio album on 19 April 2024, by their record label Century Media Records and accompanied by a music video. This is the second Lacuna Coil single released since \"Never Dawn\", which was released on June 2, 2023. The song features a guest vocal appearance by Ash Costello from New Years Day.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe song serves as a reflection on societal disillusionment, highlighting the prevailing sense of turmoil in contemporary culture. It addresses the challenges of navigating through, as the band explains; \"mean times filled with unhappy people: lonely, anxious, depressed, destructive.\" Additionally, it emphasizes the impact of external pressures, which \"doesn't allow to see things with the right clarity.\" The lyrics convey a message of acceptance amidst adversity, acknowledging the difficulty of rebuilding oneself once broken. Despite the prevailing toxicity, the song encourages listeners to find solace in the recognition that \"there's so much more to this life... and know that in the meantime, everything cannot be aligned.\"\n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe music video, directed by Patric Ullaeus in Göteborg, Sweden, features actor Andreas Barås as the main subject. The storyline revolves around Barås's character, who, amidst life's struggles, embarks on a journey from his affluent home to The Abyss, a heavy metal-themed bar. Along the way, he grapples with inner turmoil, symbolized by contemplations of suicide and surreal hellscape experiences.\nUpon arriving at The Abyss, Barås encounters Lacuna Coil performing, providing a stark contrast to his troubled state. The video explores themes of inner hardship and the search for solace, resonating with the band's lyrical content.\n\n\n== References ==",

The galaxies make up the 195th object in the Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies which was created by Halton Arp. They fall into the category of galaxies with material ejected from nuclei.\nUGC 4653 has active nuclear regions which produce infrared (IR) emissions. These appear to be more like AGNs than HII regions.\n\n\n== Supernova ==\nType Ia supernova, SN 2008bv was discovered in UGC 4653 with a magnitude of 18.3.

        "content": "Dagmar Divjak (born 1975) is a linguist who is professor at the University of Birmingham, specializing in corpus linguistics and cognitive linguistics.\n\n\n== Education, career and honours ==\nDivjak studied at KU Leuven. She initially studied East European Languages & Cultures, receiving a BA in 1995 and an MA in 1997 along with an MA in Academic Teacher Training. After a study visit to the Jagiellonian University in Kraków in 1998, she pursued a PhD in East European Languages and Cultures along with Linguistics, which was awarded in 2004; the title of her doctoral dissertation was Degrees of Verb Integration: Conceptualizing and Categorizing Events in Russian.\nAfter her doctorate she held postdoctoral positions at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (2004–5) and at KU Leuven (2005–6). In 2006 she took up a position as lecturer at the University of Sheffield, where she was promoted to Senior Lecturer in 2011, Reader in 2012, and full professor in 2018. Since 2019 she has been Professorial Research Fellow in Cognitive Linguistics and Language Cognition at the University of Birmingham.\nDivjak has served as vice-president (2010–2014) and then president (2014–2017) of the Slavic Cognitive Linguistics Association. In 2020 she was elected ordinary member of the Academia Europaea.\n\n\n== Research ==\nDivjak's research agenda is to achieve a better understanding of how the structures and patterns we observe in language emerge from human and individual cognitive capacities. Her approach can be situated within usage-based and cognitive linguistics. She has worked on topics in morphology, syntax, lexical semantics and language learning, and has employed methods from corpus linguistics as well as experimental linguistics. Her recent research has received funding from the British Academy and the Leverhulme Trust.\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\nDivjak, Dagmar & Stefan T. Gries. 2006.

        "content": "Wang Cuiqiao (王翠翘) was a Gējì during the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty, and a native of Zibo, Shandong. Her story appears in the literature of the Ming and Qing dynasties.\n\n\n== Life ==\nWang Cuiqiao was from Linzi, Shandong, and her family was poor. She was sold to Ma's family, a Geji family. Wang Cuiqiao changed her surname to Ma and named her Ma Qiao'er (马翘儿). She learned the skills of singing, playing the flute and playing the pipa, and became a Gējì when she grew up. Her adoptive mother brought her to Jiangnan to perform, and she was very good at singing Wushe songs. She sings with clear enunciation, has a crisp voice, and plays musical instruments, attracting many audiences. Wang Cuiqiao has a calm personality and is not interested in prostitution. She doesn't approach rich people who are wealthy but uneducated.Her adoptive mother often scolded and beat her for this. Unbearable, she resolutely used her personal savings to regain her free status. Later, she changed her name from Ma Qiaoer to Wang Cuiqiao and went to Suzhou and Hangzhou to perform from time to time. Wang Cuiqiao and the chivalrous Anhui rich man Luo Longwen liked each other and married Luo Longwen.After being invaded by Japanese pirates, Luo Longwen successfully escaped, but Wang Cuiqiao was captured. She was presented to the pirate leader Xu Hai and remarried to the pirate Xu Hai as his wife. Wang Cuiqiao and Xu Hai were wandering on the sea, she listened to Hu Zongxian and persuaded Xu Hai to surrender to Hu Zongxian. Xu Hai was forced by Chen Dong and committed suicide by diving into the water. Wang Cuiqiao was escorted back by officers.In order to reward Peng Yinan for his efforts in quelling the Japanese pirates, and to save his face after losing his temper after drinking, Hu Zongxian rewarded Wang Cuiqiao to Peng Yinan. Wang Cuiqiao missed her old kindness and was so distraught that she jumped into the Qiantang River and committed suicide.\n\n\n== Record ==\nThe story of Wang Cuiqiao appears in many literary works of the Ming and Qing Dynasties, and the characters' experiences may be recorded differently.\"Wang Cuiqiao\", the sixth of Mao Kun's \"Ten Rap Songs and Drum Songs by the Great Sima Hu Gong\", record Wang Cuiqiao. From the end of Jiajing to the beginning of Wanli, Ming Dynasty historian Xu Xuemo wrote the first \"Biography of Wang Qiao'er\" for Wang Cuiqiao. Wang Shizhen wrote \"The Continuation of Yan's Different Edition Wang Qiao'er\". Wang Cuiqiao is also mentioned in Mei Dingzuo's \"Green Ni Lotus\". \"Wang Cuiqiao\" was written in Feng Menglong's \"Zhitan\". Dai Shilin's \"Li Cuiqiao\". Yu Huai's \"The Biography of Wang Cuiqiao\". Zhou Qingyuan's \"Hu Shaobao's Victory in Pinging the Japanese\". Lu Renlong \"President Hu made clever use of Hua Diqing, and Wang Cuiqiao's death was reported to Xu Mingshan\". \"The Biography of Jin Yunqiao\" written by Qing Xincairen in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties adapted Wang Cuiqiao's story into a novel. But the adaptation of \"The Legend of Jin Yunqiao\" adapted Wang Cuiqiao into a prostitute who was forced to engage in prostitution in a brothel.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Piano Trio No. 1 in F major, Op. 18 is a piano trio by French composer Camille Saint-Saëns. Written in 1864 during a trip to the Pyrenees and Auvergne, the trio is dedicated to Alfred Lamarche, a family friend who cared for Saint-Saëns's mother during his absences. The work, scored for piano, violin, and violoncello, was premiered in 1865 at Salle Pleyel in Paris and published in 1867. The trio consists of three movements: Allegro vivace, Andante, and Scherzo (Presto).\n\n\n== History ==\nCamille Saint-Saëns composed his Piano Trio No. 1 in F major, Op. 18 in October 1864 during a trip to the Pyrenees and Auvergne. The work is dedicated to Alfred Lamarche, a family friend who cared for Saint-Saëns's mother during the composer's absences. The trio is scored for piano, violin, and violoncello and was published in Paris by Jacques Maho in November 1867.\nThe première of the Piano Trio No. 1 took place on 20 January 1865 at Salle Pleyel, featuring Saint-Saëns and Pablo de Sarasate. Saint-Saëns himself performed the trio on various occasions, including concerts in St. Petersburg (1876), London (1876), Antwerp (1878), Edinburgh (1904), and Athens (1920).\nIn his correspondence, Saint-Saëns mentioned playing the trio with notable musicians such as Henryk Wieniawski, Jacques Thibaud, and Louis Hasselmans. He also expressed his satisfaction with the work, describing a performance in Edinburgh as \"delightful\". The trio was transcribed for piano duet by A. Benfeld in 1885.\n\n\n== Structure ==\nThe Piano Trio No. 1 is composed of three movements.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nWatson Lyle described the trio as expressing \"the pure happiness of a care-free mind amid congenial surroundings, rather than the confidence that is born of arrogance, or of the grim determination to succeed.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPiano Trio No. 1 (Saint-Saëns): Scores at the International Music Score Library Project",

According Vishnu Purana and Bhavishya Purana the name “Mithila” is derived from King Mithi, who established the city of Mithilapuri. He was also known as Janaka because he was born out of the body of his father. The title Janaka was later adopted by subsequent kings of Mithila. According to Bal Kand of Valmiki Ramayana, King Mithi had a son named as Udavasu who became successor of the kingdom after him.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe story of the birth of the King Mithi is described in Vishnu Purana, Shrimadbhagwat Purana, Ramayana, Devī Bhāgavata, Matsya Purana etc.\n\n\n=== Birth of Mithi ===\nAccording to the sixth chapter of Devi Bhagavata, once the King Nimi was cursed to death by the sage Vashishtha for performing Yajna in his absence. Then the other sages present there took the lifeless body of Nimi and after performing Yajna rituals and worshipping the gods, they started churning the body. After some time, a great, radiant, powerful and accomplished man was born from it. Since he was born by Mathana (churning) he was named Mithi.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Cataclismo is an upcoming real-time strategy tower defense video game developed and published by Digital Sun. In the game, the player is tasked with collecting resources and constructing a stronghold using a building system inspired by Lego during daytime, while defending against large hordes of enemies at night. The game is set to be released in July 2024 for Windows PC.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nCataclismo is a real-time strategy game with elements inspired by tower defense games. The game is set in a post-apocalyptic world in which a magical cataclysm created a suffocating poison mist that has spread all over the world. During daytime, players must explore and collect resources, construct fotresses and strongholds as well as training various types of troops. The game features a building system in which players can freely mix and match more than 100 building pieces to create towers, walls, and other defensive structures. Different environments and landscapes also provide various architectural challenges for the players. During daytime, players must also invest in technology to unlock new troop types, and expand their strongholds with new buildings, traps and facilities. Oxygen management is also important for maintaining a sustainable base.\nAt night, the player's settlement will be attacked by large hordes of mutating enenies known as the \"Horrors\", which seek to destroy the citadel, the player's stronghold command center. Units will automatically attack enemies that are in close approximation to them, but players need to guide them to strategic positions in order to gain tactical advantages over the attackers. The defense buildings constructed will slowly crumble when they are damaged, and sometimes collapse completely, decimating both the player's allies and enemies. According to Digital Sun, the game will feature a campaign mode, as well as three gameplay modes: Creative, Survival and Skirmish. Strongholds constructed by players can also be shared online through Steam Workshop.\n\n\n== Development ==\nCataclismo is currently being developed by Digital Sun, the studio behind Moonlighter and The Mageseeker. Lego significantly influenced the game's building systems. According to the developer, the game features 13 traditional buildings, but players can freely craft their building using the smaller building pieces, with each having their own rules of stability. Height of a structure and the choice of materials also affect the sturdiness of a building. Following feedback from playtesters during the game's early phase of development, the team made an effort to ensure the most effective buildings were also aesthetically pleasing by implementing a system that allowed players to place decorations which provide additional gameplay perks. The art styles of the game was inspired by works of Romanic painters such as Caspar David Friedrich and the works of Mike Mignola and Studio Ghibli, while the high-fantasy setting was inspired by Dark Souls. The RTS gameplay was inspired by Age of Empires II, Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos, and They Are Billions.\nIt will be Digital Sun's first self-published title, after the studio split with the game's original publisher Humble Games, which announced the title in May 2023. The studio launched a Kickstarter campaign for the game in October 2023, and the game reached its target fundings in a week. The game is currently scheulded to be released for Windows PC on July 16, 2023.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Beauty and the Beast is a 1986 studio album by Mark Murphy.\nBeauty and the Beast is the 24th album by American jazz vocalist Mark Murphy. It was recorded when Murphy was 53 years old and released by the Muse Records label in the United States in 1986. The recording is a collection of songs by jazz composers and standard ballads from the Great American Songbook. Murphy contributes lyrics to three songs on the album.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOriginally conceived as \"Mark Murphy Sings the Jazz Composers\", Murphy had been planning the album in early 1985, and was able to record it in September of that year. The original release did not include \"Spring Friend\" and \"Memphis Blues\", tracks 10 and 5, respectively, but they were included on a subsequent release in France on Vogue Records. In November 1986 \"Poem: Beauty and the Beast\" and \"Vocalise\" (tracks 1 and 9) were recorded.\nMurphy considered himself a rhythm singer and preferred working with pianists with a strong rhythmic sensibility. Murphy said, \"This rambling stuff with no rhythm, I don't consider jazz. I miss Erroll Garner like crazy. I use a lot of wonderful pianists as accompanists all over the world. I get tired of Bill Evans clones who have decided that they're going to lay back all their lives. I look around for a pulse and I don't get it, so I have to do all the work\". So working with Bill Mays was ideal for him. Mays had previously worked with a diverse group of singers including Sarah Vaughan, Barry Manilow, Marlena Shaw,  Maxine Weldon, Jaye P. Morgan, Andy Williams, Leonard Cohen, Larry Gatlin, Dionne Warwick, and The Manhattan Transfer, and would go on to work with many more including Frank Sinatra, Anita O'Day and Al Jarreau.\n\n\n== Recording ==\nMurphy is assisted by a quintet that includes keyboardist Bill Mays, trumpeter Brian Lynch and violinist Lou Lausche, a friend from Cincinnati. Mays explained to Murphy biographer Peter Jones in the book This is Hip: The Life of Mark Murphy that for Beauty and the Beast he had a small budget that would only allow for a rhythm section and two soloists. This is the second of four Murphy records with Mays on Muse Records. Mays had previously produced, arranged, conducted and played keyboard on Murphy's 1981 Bop for Kerouac, and would go on to produce, arrange and play keyboard on the 1989 Murphy album Kerouac, Then and Now, and play on the 1991 album One for Junior with Sheila Jordan. Bassist Steve LaSpina's wife went into labor during the recording and Michael Formanek was called in to complete the session recording. LaSpina would also return to play bass on Keuoac, Then and Now and later on the 2000 Some Time Ago release by Murphy. The album features frequent scat singing and improvisations by Murphy.\n\"Beauty and the Beast\" was written by Wayne Shorter for his 1975 album Native Dancer. Murphy recites the words he wrote to Wayne Shorter's \"Beauty and the Beast\" before singing the song. The release of the album was delayed by months while Murphy awaited approval from Wayne Shorter's representatives for the lyrics Murphy had written to the title track. Murphy also wrote lyrics to McCoy Tyner's \"Effendi,\" and Bill Mays' \"Spring Friend\". Other jazz compositions include Benny Golson's \"Along Came Betty\", Sonny Rollins's \"Doxy\", and W. C. Handy's \"Memphis Blues\".\nMurphy was known throughout his career for singing infrequently heard verses, introductions and unknown stanzas from well known standards. His version of \"I Can't Get Started\" is a good example. He sings two stanzas that Ira Gershwin wrote years after completing the original for the Ziegfeld Follies of 1936. Brian Lynch is featured in a trumpet solo.\n\"The Lady Who Sang the Blues\" was written by Edwin Duff, an Australian composer friend. \"Vocalise\", composed in 1915 for soprano singer Antonina Nezhdanova, contains no words. It is sung using only one vowel of the singer's choosing following the tradition of vocalises, a 19th-century practice of wordless technical etudes set to piano accompaniment. Heard more frequently in an instrumental arrangement, it is an ideal selection for scat singer and improviser Murphy. Murphy heard Rachmaninoff's \"Vocalise\" on the radio while driving in San Francisco. Murphy said, \"I had the classical station on, and when I heard it, I had to pull the car over. It sounded so modern\".\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nThe Rolling Stone Jazz & Blues Album Guide assigns the album 3 stars (meaning, average to good: Albums in the three-star range will primarily be of interest to established fans of the artist being discussed).\nThe Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music gives the album 3 stars (meaning, good, by the artist's usual standards and therefore recommended.)\nThe All Music Guide to Jazz assigns 5 stars. Scott Yanow writes, \"Mark Murphy takes plenty of chances on this date...A very interesting and colorful set\". In his own book The Jazz Singers: The Ultimate Guide, Yanow lists the album as \"one of the best individual Muse sets\", and writes of Murphy, \"A brilliant vocal innovator, Mark Murphy can turn a song inside out in his improvisations, jumping between falsetto and low bass notes, or he can treat a ballad with real sensitivity. Based in the bebop tradition, Murphy (like Betty Carter) came up with his own individual way of extending the music. He has also been a highly influential vocal teacher and a lyricist who has written words to the songs\".\nMusichound Jazz: The Essential Album Guide assigns 5 bones (i.e. 5 stars, \"5 bones is nirvana\").\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"Poem: Beauty and the Beast\" (Mark Murphy) – 2:32\n\"Beauty and the Beast\" (Wayne Shorter, Murphy) – 6:02\n\"I Can't Get Started\" (Vernon Duke, Ira Gershwin)   – 6:29\n\"Doxy\" (Sonny Rollins)  – 6:47\n\"Memphis Blues\" (William Christopher Handy, George A.

        "content": "The Cello Sonata No. 1 in C minor, Op. 32, is a cello sonata composed by Camille Saint-Saëns in 1872.  Dedicated to the French cellist Jules Lasserre, the sonata was premiered on 7 December 1872 at the Société nationale de musique in Paris, with Auguste Tolbecque on cello and the composer at the piano.\nThe work is composed of three movements: Allegro, Andante tranquillo sostenuto, and Allegro moderato. Known for its dramatic character and emotional depth, the sonata is often interpreted as a reflection of the composer's personal struggles and the historical events of the time, such as the Franco-Prussian War and the Paris Commune. The demanding and highly virtuosic writing for both instruments quickly earned the sonata a place in the concert repertoire, with numerous notable performances in the years following its premiere.\nStylistically, the sonata is reminiscent of Beethoven's music, particularly in its thematic construction and interconnection, as well as its choice of the key C minor. However, the work stands out among Saint-Saëns's chamber music output for its excitingly dramatic and unusual character, lacking the audience-pleasing traits often found in his other compositions.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Cello Sonata No. 1 was composed around the turn of the year 1872/73, along with several other important works for violoncello, including the Cello Concerto No. 1 in A minor, Op. 33 and the Allegro appassionato in B minor, Op. 43 for cello and piano. Saint-Saëns likely drew inspiration for these works from his musician friends, as they are dedicated to well-known French cellists of the day with whom the composer often performed, such as Auguste Tolbecque and Jules Lasserre. The work's bleak undertone is often interpreted as a reflection of the tumultuous events surrounding its composition, including the war recently lost against Germany, the subsequent turmoil of the Paris Commune, and Saint-Saëns's personal grief over the loss of his beloved great-aunt Charlotte Masson, who passed away in February 1872.\nThe Cello Sonata was completed in October 1872, and according to the recollections of Charles-Marie Widor, it had its first performance at one of Saint-Saëns's famous Monday soirées in Paris, where \"the listeners were thrilled, save for Clémence Saint-Saëns, the composer's mother, who branded the finale as 'worthless.'\"\nHowever, the composer was not satisfied with the original finale and wrote a new closing movement dated 31 December 1872. Saint-Saëns later wrote to his friend Charles Lecocq: \"When I wrote my sonata for piano and violoncello, the finale was just not up to scratch. So I had to put it back in the drawer for quite a while until I was able to write another one very different from the first.\" The first and last pages of the Andante movement reproduce textually the music of an improvisation played by Saint-Saëns the previous year on the organ of Saint-Augustin.\nThe definitive version of the Sonata, with the new finale, was premiered on 7 December 1872 at the Société nationale de musique, played by Auguste Tolbecque and Saint-Saëns. The work was published by Durand in May 1873 and was dedicated to Jules Lasserre, a violoncello virtuoso with whom Saint-Saëns often performed chamber music. The Cello Sonata quickly made its way into the concert repertoire and was recognized for its demanding and often highly virtuosic writing.\n\n\n== Structure ==\nThe Cello Sonata No. 1 is composed of three movements.\n\nThe overall style of thematic construction and interconnection in the Sonata is reminiscent of Beethoven's music, an impression further reinforced by the choice of the key C minor, often associated with Beethoven's works. Despite this, the Sonata lacks the audience-pleasing traits found in many of Saint-Saëns's other chamber works, instead presenting a more excitingly dramatic and unusual character for the French composer.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe Cello Sonata was well received by audiences and critics, who quickly recognized the stature of the demanding and often highly virtuosic work. The Sonata made its way into the concert repertoire, with numerous performances by notable cellists and pianists in the years following its premiere. Jules Lasserre, the work's dedicatee, performed the Sonata with Saint-Saëns in London on 6 July 1876, and later with Hans von Bülow on 18 June 1878 at the Musical Union.\nThe Sonata's emotional depth and dramatic character were also noted by critics and biographers. Watson Lyle wrote that \"the dramatic opening of this impressive sonata, indeed the emotions expressed during the whole of the composition, are surely influenced by the trials through which Saint-Saëns had just passed, from which, in fact, he was hardly free, at the time of its conception.\" Gabriel Fauré called it the only cello sonata from any country to be of any importance.\nÉmile Baumann wrote of the piece:\n\nWhen I was thirteen, I heard my father and cousin Émilie Lucas play the Cello Sonata in C minor. It was an unforgettable shock. [...]\nThe Sonata exalted my innate sense of the tragic. [...] In the themes and momentum of the Sonata, I perceived, obscurely, a state of mind that corresponded to my own. The Andante, with its liturgical calm, transported me beneath the naves of the nearby cathedral, that cathedral of Saint-Jean where I could never revisit without recognizing the architecture and color of my secret life.\nFinally, I found in the last movement a wild, nostalgic surge; my appetites for independence and limitless happiness were swept away on this torrent. I gazed, while listening, at a canvas by Isidore Flachéron depicting the inner courtyard of a mosque in Algiers. I saw tombs, a minaret, women in white, veiled, and an old date palm, bent by its tall stature, against the cerulean sky – a sky like the one I had never suspected existed in Lyon.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCello Sonata No. 1 (Saint-Saëns): Scores at the International Music Score Library Project",

It centres on a wealthy and influential  family at the helm of an evangelical megachurch in Auckland. \n\n\n== Plot summary ==\nA youth pastor, David (Bennett) challenges his father, Scott (Hall) to make their evangelical megachurch more socially inclusive. David teams up with his brother, Paul (Boyland), the prodigal son and Dana, a transgender podcaster. Together, they uncover historic abuse in the church.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nVinnie Bennett as David Jacobson\nAri Boyland as Paul Jacobson\nPaipera Hayes as Dana\nCraig Hall as Scott Jacobson\nJessica Grace Smith as Emmaline Jacobson\n\n\n== Reception ==\nTara Ward of The Spinoff concluded: \"performances are solid, with Bennett, Hall and Boyland particularly strong, and the series raises timely questions about the role of organised religion in our society (when did worship become entertainment, podcasters Eden and Dana wonder, and is being a queer Christian an oxymoron?). Testify is a dark, brooding big-budget series with plenty of promise, but it’s strongest when it delves into the more sinister, secretive side of organised religion.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTestify at IMDb",

        "content": "Nenad Milojičić (Serbian Cyrillic: Ненад Милојичић; born 1978) is a Serbian politician. He was the mayor of Smederevska Palanka from 2008 to 2010 and has served in the National Assembly of Serbia since February 2024. Formerly a member of the Democratic Party (DS) and the People's Party (Narodna), Milojičić is now with the People's Movement of Serbia (NPS).\nHe is the step-brother of Radoslav Milojičić, the founder of the Serbian Left (SL) party.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nMilojičić was born in Smederevska Palanka, in what was then the Socialist Republic of Serbia in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. He has a master's degree as an educator and has been a national champion in school competitions. From 2015 to 2018, he was principal of the Vuk Karadžić Elementary School.\n\n\n== Politician ==\n\n\n=== Local politics in Smederevska Palanka ===\nThe Democratic Party won fourteen out of forty-nine seats in Smederevska Palanka in the 2008 Serbian local elections, emerging as the largest party in the assembly though falling well short of a majority. The party afterward formed a local coalition government with the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS) and other parties, and Milojičić was chosen as the municipality's mayor. At the time, he was the youngest mayor in Serbia. He resigned unexpectedly in June 2010, saying that he did not want to \"be a puppet\" of party officials in Belgrade telling him how to run the community. Prior to his resignation, he was the leader of the Democratic Party's regional organization for the Podunavlje District.\nMilojičić later joined Vuk Jeremić's People's Party and led its electoral list for Smederevska Palanka in the 2018 local elections. Media reports noted that one of his electoral rivals was his step-brother, who was at this time the leader of the local Democratic Party organization. Milojičić was elected to the municipal assembly when the People's Party list won three seats. The Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) won a landslide majority victory, and he served afterward in opposition. \nMilojičić again led the People's Party list for Smederevska Palanka in the 2022 local elections and was re-elected when the list won four seats. The SNS once again won a majority government.\nThe People's Party experienced a serious split in 2023, and Milojičić was one of a number of prominent party members who joined the breakaway People's Movement of Serbia. \n\n\n=== Parliamentarian ===\nThe People's Movement of Serbia participated in the 2023 Serbian parliamentary election as part of the Serbia Against Violence coalition. Milojičić received the forty-second position on the coalition's electoral list and was elected when the list won sixty-five seats. The SNS and its allies won a majority victory, and he now serves in opposition as part of the NPS–New Face of Serbia (NLS) assembly group.\nMilojičić is a deputy member of the agriculture, forestry, and water management committee and the committee on labour, social issues, social inclusion, and poverty reduction.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Battle of Małków - The battle fought between the troops of the Ryś Battalion of Stanisław Basaj and the Ak Division \"Czarus\" from the Hrubieszów district and the 14th SS Grenadier Division, which took place on 29 January 1944.\n\n\n== Before the Battle ==\nOn 18 March 1943, the Ryś Battalion made a successful attack in the village of Górki against a detachment of Ukrainian nationalists; during the pursuit they managed to smash a German car clump, also destroying 2 enemy detachments. But this was not the end of the Ryś battalion's successes, on 3 April it attacked the village of Prehoryłe, defeating a detachment of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) and taking revenge for the massacres committed by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army. In early May it drove out the Ukrainians in Hołuba.\nSubsequently, the 3rd Platoon of the Ryś Battalion scored a decisive victory over the forces of the Ukrainian police and troops of the 14th Grenadier Division near the village of Mieniany. The battalion did not stop there either, attacking on 15 September in Sahryń, unfortunately unsuccessfully, but it was one of the few defeats of the battalion, which at that time faced the Ukrainian and German forces with ease.\n\n\n== Battle ==\n\nIn late autumn, Stanislaw Basaj's troops were quartered and gathering strength for further battles, but this calm was disturbed by the 14th SS Grenadier Division in the strength of 2 companies. They attacked the villages of Górka-Zabłocie and Małków, where Stanislaw Basaj's forces and the Home army were stationed, and easily dealt with the attack, The next day Ryś struck at the same forces that had attacked him, the Ukrainian forces were at a disadvantage, inflicting heavy losses on them, thus preventing the pacification of Malkov, but on 14 February probably 140 soldiers of the Ryś battalion and the Home Army fought a battle with German forces near Zabłocie, the day-long battle ended in a Polish victory and inflicting colossal losses on the Germans, thanks to which the Basaj's troops captured ammunition and weapons from the Germans. On 27 February, there was another skirmish near Malkov, where the battalion claimed victory over the SS Beyersdorf Battle Group and the Ukrainian National Self-Defence. Sparing the Polish population, they bravely attacked another detachment of the 14th Division's Granadiers and police; the Ukrainians were beaten in the villages of Górna and Łasków; on that day still, Basaj and \"Bold\" again went to Małków for ammunition, where they easily dealt with the Ukrainian militia there.\nThe battalion's commander, upon hearing that the village was being pacified, immediately set off to help the village in Małków, 3 platoons of the Home Army joined the battle, after pushing out the enemy forces, After pushing out the enemy forces, the German army found itself encircled from 3 sides, the German offensive ended in a defeat, which was sealed by the death of the commander, and the death of many soldiers on the side of the non-friend, on the side of the partisans the losses were much smaller, 6 soldiers were lost and 16 wounded, after this\nthe next day 3 platoons of \"Ryś\" battalion and an Home Army platoon (commanded by \"Huragan\") commanded personally by him in the village of Prehoryłe discovered an outpost of Ukrainian nationalists and smashed it, several dozen Ukrainians were killed, with their own smaller losses and the village was burnt down. during this action the UPA sotnia \"Bradiagi\" was smashed. On 5 March, 4 platoons from the Rysia battalion. 116. soldiers under the command of \"Rysia\" and an Home Army platoon from \"Czarusia\" company of 35 soldiers) were attacked in the area of Prehoryłe - Małków by strong units of the 14th SS Grenadier Division and Ortschutz; the attack was repulsed with small losses, equipment was captured.\n\n\n== After Battle ==\nOn 15 March 1944 \"Ryś\", surprised near the village of Proske, smashed a German patrol. On March 16/17 the 1st Battalion fought a battle with a pacification group consisting of gendarmes, SS men and Ukrainian police from the UPA \"Jahoda\" group, which attacked the village of Łasków, the Zabłocie colony and Małków. The battalion was supported by Home Army units of Olszak \"Hardy\" and Aleksandrov \"Brawura\". The attackers were smashed. The effectiveness of \"Ryś\" actions caused a strong German response. On 19 March, units of the 14th SS Grenadier Division, Ortschutz, Ukrainian police and partly Schupo and gendarmes, launched a large-scale operation against the Basaj battalion and the \"Wiktor\" AK battalion. When the Germans encircled one of the \"Rys\" platoons in the village of Łasków, the main forces of the Basaj battalion and the \"Wiktor\" battalion rushed to the aid of the encircled. \"Rys\" pushed out the enemy and captured the Mircze-Kryłów road. At the same time, \"Czarusia\" and \"Wiktor\" companies of the Home Army drove the enemy back from the Sokal-Hrubieszow road and captured Mircze; having achieved these objectives, the Polish units captured the last points of enemy resistance in the villages of: Modryń, Modryniec and Masłomęcz The third phase of operations attacked Ukrainian self-defence bases in the villages of: Mieniany, Kozodawy, Cichobórz and Kosmów, completely driving out their crews. Significant losses were inflicted on the enemy, but the \"Rysia\" battalion also lost several men.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Police Cops: The Musical is a comedy musical written by Zachary Hunt, Nathan Parkinson and Tom Roe, with music by Ben Adams. It was developed by Hunt, Parkinson and Roe, out of sketches they created while they were classmates at East 15 drama school. The show is a spoof of Hollywood action movies of the 1980s, and makes abundant use of dance numbers, physical comedy, sight gags, and audience participation.\nIn 2015, Police Cops received a five-star review from The Stage while playing at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. It steadily picked up a popular following, and has returned to Edinburgh several times. It has also toured extensively in the UK as well as abroad. The show played in London at the New Diorama Theatre in 2021, and at the Southwark Playhouse first in 2023 and then again in 2024, to critical acclaim and sell-out crowds.\nThe cast includes the show's creators Hunt, Parkinson and Roe, as well as Melinda Orengo and Natassia Bustamante, who play a variety of female roles.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Dhu Yazan (Arabic: ذي يزن) also known as Al-Yazanin were a prominent Arab tribal clan and elite ruling family of Yemen that were affiliated with the Sabaean Kingdom and later on, the Himyarite Kingdom. They were ultimately deprived from their elite status and ruling by the Sasanian Empire, which controlled Yemen from 570 CE until 678 CE. The Arabian genealogists and historians trace their lineage to a man named 'Amir ibn Aslam who was given the title Dhu Yazan and was a contemporary of the Himyarite ruler Abu Karib, although the Dhu Yazan clan has existed way back during the time of Dhamar Ali Yuhabirr.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Dhi Yazan clan aided the Sabaeans against the Kingdom of Hadhramaut in the late 3rd century. As a revenge attack, several Hadhrami rebels bombarded the city of 'Abadan, which was where the Dhu Yazan clan lived. Later in the 4th century, they formed a military force which served under the king Tharan Yuha'nim. The king's son, Malikikarib Yuha'min, married a woman from the Dhu Yazan clan. Members of the clan also raided a city at Al Mahrah Governorate in the year 515.\nDhu Yazan were prominent allies of Dhu Nuwas, helping him in his persecution of Christians in Najran and the war against the Aksumite Empire. Later, a portion of the Yazanites which included Sumyafa' Ashwa were ordered to fortify the fortress at Hisn al-Ghurab by Dhu Nuwas. After the Aksumites had invaded Himyar, Sumyafa' Ashwa and the Yazanites under him came out from hiding and made peace with the king Kaleb. The latter would hire Sumyafa' Ashwa as his viceroy and the vassal ruler of Himyar.\nIn 570 CE, the Yazanite prince Ma'adi Yakrib ibn Abi Murrah requested help from the Sasanian Empire to end the Aksumite rule over Yemen. The Sasanians agreed, and the Aksumite ruler Masruq ibn Abraha was defeated and then killed in battle, afterwards Ma'adi Yakrib was made the vassal ruler of Himyar for the Sasanian Empire. But Ma'adi Yakrib was assassinated by his own servants, afterwards the Sasanian Empire sent a Persian governor to rule Yemen. The Dhu Yazan family was completely deprived from ruling.\n\n\n== Religion ==\nAs early as the late 4th century, the Dhu Yazan family supposedly converted to Judaism. \n\n\n== Notable members ==\nSarah'il Yaqbul-Yaz'an, Himyarite military general who served Dhu Nuwas\nSumyafa' Ashwa, Yemeni convert to Christianity and temporary king of Himyar under the Aksumite Empire\nMa'adi Yakrib ibn Abi Murrah, Himyarite prince and later on the last king of Himyar, serving as a vassal under the Sasanian Empire\nTheyazin bin Haitham\n\n\n== See also ==\nTribes of Yemen\nList of rulers of Saba' and Himyar\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Senate elections will be held in the Czech Republic in October 2024. The first round will be held alongside regional elections, with a potential second round two weeks later. \n\n\n== Background ==\nThis Senate election is the second and last election to the Senate happening during the term of Petr Fiala's cabinet. The parties in the government coalition and their allies will defend 22 out of 27 seats. Opposition parties hold only two seats that are up for election, while three seats up for election are held by independents.\nImmediately after the 2018 Senate elections, two of the candidates elected as independents joined senate groups of parliamentary parties. Ladislav Faktor joined the group of ODS and TOP 09 and Jitka Chalánková become a member of the KDU-ČSL group. Only Pavel Fisher remained as formally independent. \nOnly one seat out of the 27 was contested in a by-election in the duration of the term, with the seat being the 32nd district – Teplice, originally held by ODS member and the President of Senate Jaroslav Kubera. Following his death, 2020 Teplice by-election was held with another ODS member, Hynek Hanza, winning the seat.\nSeveral unsuccessful candidates in the 2018 Czech presidential election and 2023 Czech presidential election will have their seats up to re-election, including Jiří Drahoš, Pavel Fischer and Marek Hilšer. Term of a one member of the Fiala Cabinet, the Minister of Education Mikuláš Bek, is ending; Bek has however decided to not to stand for a re-election.\n\n\n== Electoral system ==\nOne-third of the 81-member Senate is elected every two years, giving senators six year terms. Members of the Senate are elected in single-member constituencies using the two-round system. Candidates had to be nominated by one or more registered political parties or collect at least 1,000 signatures in their constituency. There are no term limits for incumbent senators. \n\n\n== Contesting parties ==\nSimilar to the 2022 election, several parties have decided to form more or less formal alliances in some or all seats.\n\n\n=== Spolu ===\nUnlike two years prior, parties of the Spolu alliance have not signed any pre-electoral memorandum and are standing candidates mostly individually. Exception is Jiří Drahoš in Prague, who is supported by all parties in the Fiala government and Leopold Sukovský from Ostravak, who's candidacy is also supported by all three parties.\n\n\n=== Pirates, SEN 21 and Greens ===\nThe Czech Pirate Party, SEN 21 and the Green Party have announced cooperation in 10 out of the 27 constituencies. Three candidates will be nominated by SEN 21, five by Pirates, two by Greens and one jointly by SEN 21 and Pirates.\n\n\n=== Přísaha and Motorists ===\nThe coalition of Přísaha and Motorists have agreed to stand the leader of Přísaha as their joint candidate. \n\n\n=== Composition of contested seats before the elections ===\nMost seats up for the election, 13 out of 27, are held by the Spolu aliance, with 10 of these being held by ODS, two by KDU-ČSL and one by TOP 09. STAN lead bloc will defend seven seats and progressive pack composed of Pirates, SEN 21 and the Greens will be incumbent in two districts, with Pirates and SEN 21 defending one seat each\nThe opposition only holds two up the seats up in 2024, including the sole Senate seat held by SOCDEM in Karviná.\nThree senators elected as independents will have their seats up for re-election, only two of them have chosen to contest the elections. \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Donald Oliver Hooker, better known by his street name C-Note (born December 13, 1965), is an American artist, poet, playwright, and musician known for his work confronting systemic injustice and advocating for prison reform. His art draws on his experiences within the criminal justice system, exploring themes of violence, redemption, and the resilience of the human spirit. He is a prominent figure in prison art and has been dubbed the \"King of Prison Hip Hop.\"\n\n\n== Artistic emergence ==\nC-Note discovered art as an outlet for self-expression and a way to confront the realities of prison life while incarcerated. Self-taught in drawing and painting, he began to explore various mediums, addressing themes of violence, addiction, redemption, and systemic flaws of the justice system through his art, which includes poetry, spoken word, drawings, and music.\n\n\n== Impact and recognition ==\nC-Note's artistic output and thematic impact have earned him significant recognition. He was ranked by Google Search as America's and the world's most prolific prisoner-artist in 2017. His work, like Incarceration Nation and the Paintoem  titled Today We Are Sisters, has been influential in raising awareness and advocating for issues like reparations for women forcibly sterilized in California prisons. His work has been featured in academic institutions, criminal justice reform initiatives, and numerous exhibitions, highlighting the role of art in advocating for social justice and change. His work has been published in art books and has led to significant social change, including efforts to end long-term solitary confinement, and forced sterilization in California prisons. As a leading figure in prison art, he has been instrumental in raising awareness about the injustices within the prison system.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nCategory:1965 births\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:American artists\nCategory:American poets\nCategory:American playwrights\nCategory:American musicians\nCategory:People from Los Angeles\nCategory:Artists from California\nCategory:Poets from California\nCategory:Musicians from California\nCategory:African-American artists\nCategory:African-American musicians\nCategory:American adoptees",

        "content": "Sauver l'amour is the eighth and final studio album by French singer Daniel Balavoine, released in October 1985. It became his biggest commercial success, selling over 1.2 million copies.\n\n\n== Background and release ==\nThe album was written and composed by Balavoine and nearly all the songs deal with a political or social theme. Similar to his previous album, Loin des yeux de l'Occident, Balavoine wrote the majority of Sauver l'amour on his Fairlight CMI synthesiser at his home studio in Colombes in June 1985. The following month, the album was recorded at Highland Studios in Inverness, and it was mixed at the Studio du Palais des Congrès in Paris in August and September.\nFollowing the release of the album, Balavoine told RTL's Monique Le Marcis that he liked the album so much, he wished it would be his last. Prophetically, Sauver l'amour would be Balavoine's final album as he died in a helicopter accident in January 1986.\nThe first single released was \"L'Aziza\" and would become Balavoine's biggest hit with sales increasing considerably after his death. It would go on to become his only number-one and was also certified platinum. The song denounces racism and pays tribute to Balavoine's Jewish-Moroccan wife Corinne. The second single, \"Sauver l'amour\", looks at war and famine in the Third World. It was not as successful as his previous single, but still sold over 500 thousand copies and peaked at number 5 on the French Top 50. A third single, \"Aimer est plus fort que d'être aimé\", was also released in late 1986, but failed to make any impact.\nIn 1986, Balavoine was posthumously awarded the Victoires de la musique for best album that year for Sauver l'amour.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nMusicians\n\nDaniel Balavoine – vocals, keyboards\nMatt Clifford – keyboards\nJoe Hammer – drums, drum machine, backing vocals\nJohn Woolloff – guitar\nRené Morizur – saxophone\nAliss Terrell – backing vocals\nDiane Dupuis – backing vocals\nPaula Moore – backing vocals\nRoger Secco – backing vocals\nYves Chouard – backing vocals\nTechnical\n\nAndy Scott – producer\nFrédéric Defaye – assistant producer\nKen Browar – photography\nBill Butt and Haymo Kindler for Liaison Internationale – artwork design and concept\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Arlette Sombo-Dibélé (born 8 December 1958) is a Central African lawyer and politician.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nDibélé was born on 8 December 1958. She earned a law degree and continued her postgraduate education at the University of Bangui, taking a private law degree specializing in judicial careers.\n\n\n== Judicial career ==\nDibélé joined and worked at the Central African Bar for over ten years. She was also employed at the Central African Constitutional Court for seven years and four months. After Touadera was declared as the winner of the 2020–21 Central African general election, she received appeals from 10 candidates over the election fraud and filed those pleas.\nThroughout her judicial career, she has been a lawyer to Karim Meckassoua, Dieudonné Ndomaté, Juan Rémy Quignolot, Aurélien Simplice Zingas, Thierry Georges Vackat., Yvon Konaté, Thierry Savonarole Maleyombo, and Moussa Kitoko. In 2022, she managed to acquit Ludovic Ngaïfé, Maleyombo, Konaté, and Ndomate.\nApart from that, she is also the founder of a civil organization of the Group of Action of Civil Society Organizations for the Defense of the Constitution of March 30, 2016 (G-16).  \nOn 15 June 2019, an alleged presidential guard personnel threw a grenade at her, and she survived an assassination attempt. Apart from that, she also received death threats from a Touadera supporter, Euloge Doctrouvé Koï, on 19 September 2022.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nSarandji appointed Dibélé the Minister of the Environment, Sustainable Development, Water and Forests, Hunting and Fishing on 11 April 2016. As the environment minister, the Central African Republic sided with the Egypt-led group, which implored the industrialized countries' transparency and traceability in their contributions to financing climate change programs. She also endorsed the Paris Agreement. Other than that, during the Green Fund workshop that was held on 13 December 2016, she recommended to the private sector operators \"to review their legal text and to give importance to acquiring procedures allowing them to access financing from the Green Fund.\"\nDibélé stepped down as minister on 12 September 2017 and was not included in the Sarandji II Cabinet. She claimed that her dismissal was due to her attempt to suppress the embezzlement.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nOubangui Medias named Dibélé one of the top 10 Central African women in 2022.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Henry Ferriss  (1 August 1917 – 16 August 1940) was a British flying ace who served in the Royal Air Force (RAF) during the Second World War. He is credited with having shot down at least eleven aircraft.\nBorn in Lee, Ferriss joined the RAF in 1937 and was posted to No. 111 Squadron the following year after completing his training. Still with the squadron at the time of the outbreak of the Second World War, he flew extensively in the Battle of France and the subsequent Battle of Britain. Flying a Hawker Hurricane fighter, he claimed a number of aerial victories during this time. He was killed on 16 August 1940 in a mid-air collision with a German bomber that he was attempting to shoot down.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHenry Michael Ferriss was born on 1 August 1917 at Lee, a south-eastern suburb of London, in England. He was educated at St Joseph's Academy in Blackheath, subsequently going on to attend Stonyhurst College. By 1935 he was studying at the University of London and then commenced medical training at St Thomas's Hospital Medical School. As a student, he flew with the University Air Squadron.\nA lack of finance meant that he gave up his studies and in July 1937 Ferriss joined the Royal Air Force on a short-service commission. Appointed as an acting pilot officer on probation in September 1937, he trained at No. 6 Flying Training School at Netheravon. Once his training was completed, Ferriss was posted to No. 111 Squadron in May 1938. His new unit was stationed at Northolt and was equipped with the Hawker Hurricane fighter, the first RAF squadron to receive the type. He was confirmed in his pilot officer rank a few months later.\n\n\n== Second World War ==\n\nShortly after the outbreak of the Second World War, No. 111 Squadron moved north, initially to Acklington and then to Drem in Scotland, from where it patrolled along the coastline. On 12 January 1940, Ferriss was promoted to flying officer. The next month No. 111 Squadron shifted again, this time to Wick, where it provided the Royal Navy base at Scapa Flow with aerial cover. It was occasionally scrambled to counter Luftwaffe bomber attacks. On 8 April, Ferriss claimed a half share in a Heinkel He 111 medium bomber destroyed near Scapa Flow, although this was not confirmed. Two days later, flying in the same vicinity, he shared in the destruction of another He 111, of Kampfgeschwader 26 (Bomber Wing 26).\n\n\n=== Battle of France ===\nBy mid-May, No. 111 Squadron was back in the south of England, from where it regularly flew to France following the invasion of that country. On 18 May Ferriss destroyed three Messerschmitt Bf 110 heavy fighters to the east of Douai, and also claimed another Bf 110 as damaged. At least some of the aircrew of the aircraft he destroyed had taken to their parachutes and Ferriss reported that he had fired upon them, believing that they would make territory held by the Germans. From late May and into early June, No. 111 Squadron flew in support of Operation Dynamo, the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force from Dunkirk. During this time, on 31 May, Ferriss shot down a Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter north of Dunkirk.\nOnce the evacuation was completed, the squadron provided escorts for the Fleet Air Arm's bombing operations over the French coast and on 6 June, Ferriss destroyed two Bf 109s near Abbeville.\n\n\n=== Battle of Britain ===\nA period of rest at Croydon followed for No. 111 Squadron; this allowed for training up of replacement pilots. During this time Ferris was recognised for his successes in the previous weeks with an award of a Distinguished Flying Cross. This was gazetted on 20 June and the published citation read:  \n\nDuring two consecutive days in May, Flying Officer Ferriss shot down a total of four Messerschmitt 110's although heavily outnumbered. Later, he shot down a further three Messerschmitt 109's. In these combats he has displayed outstanding ability.\nThe squadron soon commenced patrolling over the English Channel. On 10 July, he shared in the destruction of a Dornier Do 17 medium bomber off Folkestone, and also shot down a Bf 109 in the same vicinity. The fighter crashed into the sea but the pilot was subsequently rescued. Ferriss meanwhile was attacked by another Bf 109 and as a result, his Hurricane was damaged and he was lightly wounded. Patrolling 10 miles (16 km) to the west of Boulogne on 28 July, Ferriss caught a Heinkel He 59 floatplane of the Luftwaffe's Seenotdienst (sea rescue service) on the surface of the sea; it was attempting to rescue the crew of another He 59 that had been shot down by pilots of No. 111 Squadron. Making strafing attacks on the He 59, Ferriss caused major damage and wounded two of the crew.\n\nOn 13 August Ferriss destroyed one Do 17 and damaged a second over Seasalter. Two days he claimed a Do 17 as probably destroyed near Dover. The next day, No. 111 Squadron was scrambled to intercept bombers approaching the Kent coastline. Making a head-on attack on of one of these bombers, a Do 17, near Marden, Ferriss collided with the aircraft he targeted. The wreckage of his Hurricane landed on a nearby farm. He and the crew of the bomber were killed.\nFerriss is buried at St Mary's churchyard in Chislehurst, England. He is credited with having shot down eleven German aircraft, two of which were shared with other pilots. Another shared aerial victory was unconfirmed. He is also credited with one aircraft probably destroyed and two damaged.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nBishop, Patrick (2003). Fighter Boys: Saving Britain 1940. London: HarperCollins.

        "content": "The Chinese Civil War was fought between the Kuomintang-led government of the Republic of China and the forces of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), with armed conflict continuing intermittently from 1 August 1927 until 7 December 1949, resulting in a CCP victory and control of mainland China in the Chinese Communist Revolution.\nThe following is a chronological timeline of the history of the Chinese Civil War (1912–1949):\n\n\n== Background (pre 1927) ==\n\n\n== First phase: Communist insurgency (1927–1937) ==\n\nFrom August 1927 to 1937, the First United Front collapsed during the Northern Expedition, and the Nationalists controlled most of China.\n\n\n== Interlude: Second Sino-Japanese War period (1937–1945) ==\n\nFrom 1937 to 1945, hostilities were mostly put on hold as the Second United Front fought the Japanese invasion of China with eventual help from the Allies of World War II, although co-operation between the KMT and CCP during this time was minimal and armed clashes between the groups were common. Events below are related to the Chinese Civil War during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945).\n\n\n== Second phase: resumption of civil war (1945–1949) ==\n\nThe CCP gained control of mainland China and proclaimed the People's Republic of China in 1949, forcing the leadership of the Republic of China to retreat to the island of Taiwan. \n\n\n== See also ==\nOutline of the military history of the People's Republic of China\nOutline of the Chinese Civil War\nList of wars involving the People's Republic of China\nList of Chinese wars and battles\nList of wars involving the Republic of China\nList of wars involving Taiwan\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\nBernstein, R.

        "content": "The Vijayabahu dynasty of Sri Lanka is a storied lineage that spans centuries, leaving an indelible mark on the island's history and culture. \n\n\n== History ==\nFounded by King Vijayabahu I in the 11th century, this illustrious dynasty rose to prominence during a pivotal period in Sri Lanka's history, marked by political upheaval and territorial conquests.\nThe dynasty's seat of power was located in the ancient city of Polonnaruwa, a UNESCO World Heritage site renowned for its archaeological treasures and architectural wonders. Here, the rulers of the Vijayabahu dynasty presided over a flourishing kingdom, fostering trade, agriculture, and the arts, and leaving behind a legacy of innovation and prosperity.\nThe Vijayabahu dynasty is celebrated for its military prowess and strategic acumen, successfully repelling foreign invaders and expanding the kingdom's borders through a series of military campaigns. Under the leadership of kings such as Parakramabahu I and Nissanka Malla, the dynasty reached its zenith, establishing Sri Lanka as a regional power and cultural hub in South Asia.\nArt and architecture flourished during the reign of the Vijayabahu dynasty, as evidenced by the magnificent monuments and religious edifices that dot the landscape of ancient Sri Lanka. From the awe-inspiring ruins of Polonnaruwa to the sacred city of Anuradhapura, the dynasty's architectural legacy continues to inspire awe and admiration to this day.\nReligion also played a central role in the Vijayabahu dynasty, with Buddhism serving as the spiritual and cultural cornerstone of Sri Lankan society. Kings patronized the construction of Buddhist temples and monastic complexes, endowing them with lavish donations and royal patronage, and fostering a climate of religious tolerance and pluralism.\nDespite facing numerous challenges and dynastic struggles over the centuries, the Vijayabahu dynasty endured, leaving an enduring imprint on the collective memory of the Sri Lankan people. Today, their legacy lives on in the rich tapestry of Sri Lankan culture, from its vibrant festivals and traditions to its timeless monuments and architectural marvels.\n(written with Chatgpt)\n\n\n== List of Monarchs of the Vijayabahu Dynasty ==",

        "content": "Lau How Teck (Chinese: 刘孝德; pinyin: Liú Xiàodé; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Lâu hàu-tek) is a Bruneian businessperson and politician of Chinese descent who was among the members of Brunei's Legislative Council (LegCo) appointed in 2023. He is a member of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce's 43rd (2024–2026) Honorary Advisory Group in Brunei.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nPossibly inspired by his father's agricultural activities, Lau showed an early interest in farming that would become a lifelong passion and job. He showed a special interest in geography while attending St. Andrew's School (SAS); this interest in geography was probably related to his passion with the quality of soil for growing fruits and vegetables. After finishing his fifth year at SAS, Lau committed himself to helping his father on the farm, laying the foundation for his future agricultural pursuits.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Business career ===\nThe Brunei Agriculture and Agrifood Department has twice awarded Lau's farm the Best Farm Award and the Best Advanced Farm Award, demonstrating the farm's remarkable accomplishments under his direction. As the farm's president, he has made sure that the Hua Ho Department Store receives the majority of the produce—which includes fruits, vegetables, poultry, and eggs—grown on the property.\nAfter his father passed away in 2018, Lau assumed control of the Hua Ho Agricultural Farm and became its director. He has gradually replaced conventional farming with innovative methods on the land. He pioneered the closed-house method for raising poultry, the hydroponic and greenhouse systems for growing vegetables, and the protected culture and fertigation techniques for growing non-seasonal fruits.\nSince 2000, he has raised agricultural productivity, output, and sales by utilising innovative technologies. 2013 saw 117 metric tons of fruits and vegetables grown on the farm. On 15 April 2014, the Department of Agriculture and Agrifood recognised Hua Ho Agricultural Farm and Ladang Tunas Harapan, both managed by him, with the Brunei Darussalam GAP (Good Agricultural Practice) mark. The farm was generating over 129 metric tons by 2017.\nAmidst the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, Lau reported that the Hua Ho Agricultural Farm employed around 150 people and that the labor scarcity caused the output of chickens to drop by 10%. Seventy personnel are now needed, however their work permits are past due since they went back to China. Furthermore, around twenty workers will depart and go home within the following month.\n\n\n=== Political career ===\nOn 8 January 2022, the Brunei-China Belt and Road Promotion Association's 2nd (2022–2024) Council was sworn in, with Lau serving as one of the six vice presidents. He was among the distinct individuals appointed by Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah to the LegCo on 20 January 2023. As evidence of his ardent support for public welfare programs, he has a number of esteemed positions, including directorship and honorary consultancy at many Chinese associations, Chung Hwa Middle School (CHMS, BSB), Brunei Tengyun Hall, and the China Cultural Foundation.\nAfter giving a speech at the 20th LegCo meeting on 13 March 2024, Lau underlined the significance of actions taken by the Ministry of Education in fostering the development of future leaders. He praised young people who are proactive and involved in academic studies, notably undergraduates doing temporary jobs or internships, especially in the field of agriculture. In order to improve research foundations, he suggested a diverse strategy across higher education institutions and asked for clarity on the follow-up measures relating agricultural research and development initiatives.\nDuring the LegCo meeting on 21 March 2024, Lau questioned the Minister of Transport and Infocommunications, Shamhary Mustapha, on how the transportation and logistics department handles cargo-related difficulties, particularly at the Muara container terminal. According to him, there were issues with queue management when loading and unloading the products of the Brunei Fertilizer Industries, which made it take a while to finish the delivery of other containers. He also inquired about the difficulties of hailing a taxi from Brunei International Airport as well as the payment rates of visitors.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nBorn and raised in Brunei, Lau is a native of the country. The origins of his family may be found in Pengcheng, their ancestral home, from where his great-grandfather emigrated when Emperor Jiaqing ruled the Qing dynasty. They then made their home in Tong'an County before ultimately settling in Jinmen County's Lieyu. He is Pehin Lau Ah Kok's second son. Lu Xiuling and he have three boys. He is currently a grandfather since their oldest son, Sun Zhong, was married in 2021.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nLau was granted the Peladang, Petani dan Penternak Berjaya in association with Hari Peladang, Petani dan Penternak dan Nelayan in November 2011 for his accomplishments and contributions to the agricultural industry.\n\n\n== References ==",

It lies near to spiral galaxy NGC 4540, although the two of them are quite far. The object was discovered by Royal Harwood Frost on May 7, 1904. Although listed as a member in the Virgo Cluster Catalogue as VCC 1593, it is not a member of the Virgo cluster but a background galaxy.\n\n\n== Supernova ==\nSN 2001Z, a Type II supernova was discovered in IC 3528. It was located 0\".5 west and 11\".2 north of the nucleus.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sara Al-Saqqa (born c. 1992) is a Palestinian surgeon. She was the first woman surgeon in Gaza and she was recognised as a member of the BBC's 100 influential women in 2024. She became a de facto reporter on the Gazan medical effort during the humanitarian crisis involving a forced wave of Palestinian refugees in the armed conflict between Israel and Gaza in 2023 and 2024.\nHer coverage of the day-to-day hospital events and the care for Palestinian victims, before and during the war escalation of October 2023, gave her significant media attention.\n\n\n== Life ==\nAl-Saqqa was born in the Gaza Strip in about 1992. She studied medicine at the Islamic University of Gaza and she then obtained a master's degree in laparoscopic surgery at Queen Mary University in London. After graduating, she began working at the Al-Shifa hospital and she became the first woman surgeon in the Gaza Strip. There she lived with the harsh sanitary conditions and the scarcity of resources resulting from the Israeli restrictions. Her work brought her a salary of $300 every forty days at a time when the UN estimated that a thousand more doctors were needed to meet the health emergency.\nAfter the October 2023 attacks by Hamas and Israel's offensive air response there was a mass exodus of Palestinian civilians to northern Gaza. Al-Saqqa decided to remain at the hospital. She chose to continue both her medical work and her social media activity. She had used Instagram to spread news from Gaza. She began to report the Gazan emergency; the thousands of dead, the crisis in the management of the wounded and the destruction of a large part of the city.\n\nAl-Saqqa chose to start recording injuries (including to babies and toddlers) in the hospital. These were possible evidence of war crimes that she thought could constitute crimes against humanity. The Israelis alleged that the hospital complex was a military operations center for Hamas. One of her colleagues, Dr. Ayman Abu al-Auf, and all of his family, died during the attacks. She said that she was most upset by the children that they were unable to help, she said she went into paediatrics never expecting \"to feel so helpless in front of crying children\".\nShe was chosen as one of the hundred most inspiring and influential women by the BBC's 100 Women in autumn 2023. After this, Al-Saqqa refused Israel's orders to evacuate civilians to northern Gaza and continued working in hospitals in the south of the Strip. Conditions became worse with cuts to telephone communications, the internet and to the electricity supply. The cuts added to the problems caused by the accumulation of hundreds of wounded in the hospital and the damaged facilities. The priority became reconverting the facilities into an emergency center where citizens could seek refuge from the bombings,   Al-Saqqa assisted pregnant women as they gave birth after being rescued. The proximity of the artillery meant that in the beginning of 2024 she went to Rafah, in the south of Gaza, to continue practicing there as a surgeon near her family.\nIn February 2024 she reported on the end of care at Nasser Hospital, at what had been a major hospital.\nIn April 2024 the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) noted that dead bodies were being removed from Al Shifa hospital. Their news release used a photo of Al-Saqqa (of their staff) when they made an urgent appeal for $2.3 billion so that they could help 3.1 million people in the West Bank, Gaza and west Jerusalem. Even with those funds UNOCHA noted that they needed to be sure that their workers were safe and that they had access to visas and communications.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Canaletto Blick (lit.: Canaletto View) of Vienna (Austria) is a famous perspective of the city center of Vienna, seen from the Upper Belvedere Palace. It was popularized by a painting from Bernardo Bellotto, known as Canaletto.\n\n\n== The Painting ==\n\nThe original painting, which serves as the blueprint for this view, depicts Vienna in the mid-18th century. The domes of Karlskirche, St. Stephen's Cathedral tower, and the dome of the Salesian Nuns' Church serve as vertical landmarks. The foreground shows the gardens of the Belvedere Palace. Other prominent landmarks visible in Bellotto's oil painting that still exist today are the Schwarzenberg Palace and the Lower Belvedere Palace.\n\n\n== Symbolism ==\n\nThis representation served not only as a faithful cityscape but also carried political symbolism. The painting reflects Vienna's development under the Habsburg dynasty. The artist embellished the perspective of his work, likely to please his patron, Maria Theresa. Buildings associated with the patroness were slightly enlarged or repositioned, notably the dome of the Salesian Nuns' Church, whose foundation stone was laid at the birth of Maria Theresa. The tower of the Elisabethinenkirche, shown on the far right of the image, would not have been visible from this vantage point, but Canaletto included it, likely due to financial support from the empress. Two observatories, no longer in existence today, were also depicted to honor the Habsburgs as patrons of the sciences.\n\n\n== Impact and protection ==\nDespite Vienna's growth in the 19th century and the city's transformation from a fortified town, the overall impression of the Canaletto view remained largely intact and served as inspiration for numerous artists.\nThe Canaletto view has played a significant role in urban planning discussions, particularly in the debate over the construction of high-rises near Vienna's historical center. Plans to construct high-rises near Vienna's historical center have been a topic of discussion but are always tied to the protection of the Canaletto view. In 2017, UNESCO added Vienna to the watchlist after plans for a 75-meter-high-rise development (Heumarkt-Tower) within the confines of the cultural heritage site were approved. The World Heritage Committee ruled that the plans for the Heumarkt area threatened the characteristics that saw the city placed on the World Heritage List in 2001.\n\n\n== Similar views ==\n\nBellotto's original painting is now housed in the Museum of Art History in Vienna. Another Canaletto view based on Bellotto's cityscape can be found in Dresden. This view from the right bank of the Elbe River below the Augustus Bridge also played a significant role in urban planning discussions, particularly in the debate over the reconstruction of Dresden's city center, heavily damaged by air raids in 1945.\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nCanaletto View in the Vienna History Wiki (in German)\nVienna Cultural Heritage: Visual Relationships in the Cityscape (in German)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Frank Kenneth Milne (18 July 1885 – 3 October 1980), usually referred to as F. Kenneth Milne, was an Australian architect based in Adelaide, South Australia. He was regarded as one of the leading architects in the state in 1920, and continued to design buildings even in retirement. He went into partnership with a series of other architects over the course of his career, including John Richard Schomburgk Evans, Charles Alexander Russell, and Rolfe Vernon Boehm. he and his wife established the Kenneth and Hazel Milne Travelling Scholarship at the University of Adelaide in 1958.\nSeveral of his designs survive today, with many heritage-listed, including Woodards House in Waymouth Street, Adelaide, the remodelled Regal Theatre in Kensington Park, and his own home in Stanley Street, North Adelaide.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nFrank Kenneth Milne was born on 18 July 1885 in the eastern Adelaide suburb of Tusmore, the seventh of eight children of land agent John Milne and his wife Lucy Edith Macgeorge. His grandfather was Sir William Milne.\nHe attended both private school and state schools at Glenelg and North Adelaide. His art teacher at Mrs Kingston's school in Glenelg, Mary Overbury, taught him drawing.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\nMilne was articled to the Adelaide architect Alfred Wells from 1903 to 1906, being taught there by chief draftsman Stuart Clark.\nIn 1906 Milne moved to Sydney, and worked as a draftsman with G. B. Robertson & T. J. Marks for three years.\nAfter returning to Adelaide in April 1909, he set up a practice in Grenfell Street. His style became more and more eclectic, using elements of Art Nouveau, Beaux Arts Classicism, Art Deco, Gothic, and Italian Renaissance architecture. He designed many types of building, including banks, hotels, churches, houses, and picture theatres.\nFrom 1912 until 1946, he was contracted to the South Australian Brewing Company to supervise their building works.\nIn 1920 John Richard Schomburgk Evans joined his practice (F. Kenneth Milne and Evans), and in 1925 Charles Alexander Russell joined them, becoming Milne, Evans, and Russell. The practice was dissolved in early 1930.\nBy the 1920s Milne was regarded as one of the state's leading architects. In October 1928, architects Milne, Evans, and Russell submitted their plans for extensions and alterations to the Crown & Anchor Hotel in Grenfell Street. The work was completed in 1929, with the alterations costing £5,000. In 1928-9 Milne (then in practice as Milne & Evans) designed and supervised construction of an office building at 47-49 Waymouth Street, Adelaide, known as the Norwich Union Building (later Woodards House), for Norwich Union Fire Insurance Society, which Milne regarded as one of his finest works.  In the same year, the firm designed a large extension to the Kensington Gardens Bowling & Tennis Club.\nIn 1933-4 Milne travelled to Europe on a study tour, and was impressed by Georgian architecture, especially that of John and James Adam.\nIn 1936, he designed a home for his own family, at 229 Stanley Street, North Adelaide, called \"Sunnyside\". The home was state heritage-listed on the South Australian Heritage Register on 11 September 1986.\nIn 1941, he was engaged to do an extensive remodelling of the Ozone Marryatville (now the Regal Theatre, Kensington Park). The then Chelsea Cinema was state heritage-listed on 24 March 1983.\nLater associates in his practice, from the late 1940s onwards, included L. C. Dawkins and Rolfe Vernon Boehm (1946); Russell Stuart Ellis (1947); F. P. Bulbeck (by 1957); J. R. N. Twopeny (1960); and James Hodge (by 1964).\n\n\n=== Practice names ===\nMilne's practices operated under the following names:\n\nF. Kenneth Milne (1909–1920)\nF. Kenneth Milne & Evans (1920–1925)\nF.

He promoted the architectural profession in public lectures, and was a co-founder of the school of architecture at the University of Adelaide.\nHe also belonged to the English-Speaking Union and the Liberal and Country League of South Australia.\nHe was a fit man, and belonged to the Adelaide Rowing Club, the Amateur Sports Club and the South Australian Rugby Union. He also played Australian Rules football, tennis and golf, and excelled at swimming and diving, earning trophies in these as well as rowing.\n\n\n== Awards ==\n1944: Inaugural SAIA Merit Award for Domestic Architecture, for Sunnyside\n1953: Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal\n1970: Life Fellow, Royal Australian Institute of Architects\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nOn 12 March 1913 Milne married Hazel Muir Fotheringham (d.1968) at Chalmers Church (later Scots Church) on  North Terrace. They had one child, Kenneth Lancelot Milne, who was founding president of the South Australian division of the Australian Democrats in 1977 and was elected to state parliament in the South Australian Legislative Council.\n\n\n== Later life, death and legacy ==\nMilne semi-retired in 1957, but continued to undertake alterations to buildings designed by him, and some work for old clients until he finally retired fully in 1973.\nAt the age of 91, Milne rowed on the River Torrens with three family members as crew. He died on 3 October 1980, aged 95, at Calvary Hospital, North Adelaide, and was cremated.\nMilne and his wife Hazel gave £5000 to establish the Kenneth and Hazel Milne Travelling Scholarship in Architecture in 1958, which continues as of 2024. The scholarship, now worth A$20,000, is awarded to the selected \"graduates of the Master of Architecture to travel and undertake study abroad and then return to Adelaide\".\n\n\n== Selected works ==\n\n\n=== Norwich Union Building ===\nIn 1928-9 Milne (then in practice as F. Kenneth Milne, Evans & Russell) designed and supervised construction of an office building at 47-49 Waymouth Street, Adelaide, for Norwich Union Fire Insurance Society, which included ground floor offices for the Commercial Bank of Australia. Milne regarded this building as one of his finest works. The building contractor was prominent local builder Frederick Fricker, who died suddenly while on holiday, in Port Said, before the building was completed. The building was officially opened on 5 June 1929, after a dinner the previous night attended by many local dignitaries. Later renamed Woodards House, the building was state heritage-listed on the South Australian Heritage Register on 23 August 2013, and described as \"an outstanding example of a building constructed in the Inter-War Commercial Palazzo style\".

        "content": "The archaeological survey of Judea and Samaria and the Golan in 1968 or as it was called the \"Emergency Survey\" is the first comprehensive archaeological survey that was conducted in these areas.\nAfter The Six Day War, for the first time Israeli archaeologists had an opportunity to research these areas. They had information only about the ancient site located at the Golan region from Gottlieb Schumacher's book written at the end of the 19th century. In Judea and Samaria, with few exceptions, no sites were examined or identifications were incomplete.\nThe survey in the area began several months after the end of the Six Day War, due to the feeling that these areas would be returned to Jordan, Egypt and Syria as soon as possible. The archaeologist Avraham Biran who led the survey wrote: It was \"a sort of lightning strike that discovered sites about which nothing was known.\" Israel Antiquities Authority, the IDF, the Israel Police with many volunteers joined to help carry out the survey. Completion surveys were carried out in the Golan, the Samaria Mountains, North Sinai and the Jewish sites in the south of Mount Hebron.\nTo carry out the survey, the areas were divided into five sections with a responsible archaeologist per area. \nLand of Judah – Moshe Kochavi.\nThe Judean Desert and the Jericho Valley – Pessah Bar-Adon\nLand of Benjamin and Mount Ephraim – Zechariah Kalai\nLand of Ephraim and Manasseh – Ram Gophna and Yosef Porat\nThe Golan – Claire Epstein and Shmarya Guttman\n\n\n== The land of Judah ==\nThe survey covered an area of 800 square kilometers that were beyond the borders established at the 1949 Armistice Agreements at the end of the War of Independence. The survey included almost all of the Judean Mountains, the eastern foothills of the Shephelah and the northern edge of the Negev. There was little archaeological knowledge about the Judean region, on the other hand, there was a lot of information about it from Biblical and historical sources. Therefore, the teams decided the survey would be conducted in the following order of priority: \n1. Archaeological examination of sites for which historical identifications have been proposed.\n2. Examining the sites marked on the map as ancient sites.\n3. Continuous coverage of the entire area.\nA total of 208 sites were examined. Most of them are on the mountain ridge: domed mounds and mounds with an extension. Some of the sites from the Hellenistic period up to modern times were found destroyed, due to the removal of the stones for secondary use. Sites with unhewn stones, from earlier periods, were found preserved.\nBy dividing the sites according to the periods, it shows that there were fewer sites that preceded the Iron Age. The dense settlement began in the Iron Age by settlers who later became known as the Kingdom of Judah. At the end of the survey, the identification of many settlements was confirmed, among them: Betar, Tקkoa, Beth-zur, Halhul, Ziph, Carmel, Horvat Maon (Hebron Hills), Dvir, Keilah.\nFrom the Persian period, archeologists found settlements without a wall in the Bethlehem area and citadels along the southern border of the Yehud Medinata that protected against invaders from the south of the country.\nFrom the Hellenistic period a considerable increase in the settlement's density and strength is visible. It reminiscent the beginning of the settlement in the Iron Age. Most of the settlements in the south of Judean Mountains, among other things, around Adoraim which was the capital of Toparch.\nDuring the Roman period, the number of settlements continued to increase. Magnificent remains have been found in several places in addition to those known from Herodium and Hebron – Cave of the Patriarchs. The findings were evidence of a flourishing area during the Second Temple period. There are also remains of developed agriculture on terraces. A thorough excavation was carried out near Betar to locate the city's surrounding fortifications during the Bar Kokhba revolt.\nIn the Byzantine period settlements reach their peak in all of Israel and also in Judea there is an increased number of settlements. In total, evidence was found of the existence of 127 settlements in the Judaean Mountains(twice as many as in the Roman period) and another 26 – in the high plains. These settlements form a \"settlement bridge\" to today's settlements, most of which are inhabited to this day. Special emphasis was given to finding remains from the Jewish settlements in the south of the Hebron mountains in the area known as Droma.\nAnother topic discussed in the survey was the road network found in Judea.\n\n\n== The Judean Desert and the Jericho Valley ==\nThe surveyed area included part of the Judean Desert that was not included in the borders of the State of Israel, the Jericho plains and the Jordan Valley up to Gesher Adam – 1,400 square kilometers. Due to the limited time of the survey – four months, the large number of sites and the difficulties and effort involved in surveying the caves, the results were only partial. Before the survey, the known sites were Qumran, Ein Feshkha and Murba'at caves. After the survey 210 new sites were discovered. \"It seems that  the desert climate preserved prominent traces of historical occurrences and events, especially related to Jewish history and its wars for independence and freedom.\"\nThe survey did not raise hypotheses that would explain the following phenomena:\n· There are almost no remains of settlement in the Judean desert for more than two thousand years, between the Chalcolithic period – 4,000 BC to 3,150 BC and the second Iron Age between 1000 BC – 586 BC.\n· Its not possible to determine the dates of the fortified construction with walls throughout the desert, due to the lack of remains. Similar structures found in the Negev were dated to the Middle Canaanite period – 2200 BC – 2000 BC.\nA prehistoric site was found covering an area of ​​25 dunams, south of Alexandrium. It was a center for stone tools industry and preserved flints were found there.\nThe possibility of sites from the Chalcolithic period was known in light of a magnificent treasure found in Nahal Mishmar and the Chalcolithic temple of Ein Gedi. Several other sites were found in the desert: circular enclosures with a diameter of 30 to 50 meters with a stage inside. Presumably these were ritual sites. The surveyors also hypothesized that the name \"Gilgal\" does not refer to a specific place but to a ritual site with a circular structure with a platform – dozens of them were found in the survey.\nFrom the Israeli era, citadels, strongholds, and wall lines were found, one of them is 2.5 km long. The assumption is that this is a defensive system built during the Kingdom of Judah. ​​The authors of the survey believe that the defensive system was intended to protect flocks of sheep, pastures, agricultural crops, water cisterns, and trade caravans. In this context is a verse from the Book of Chronicles (2:26 – 10) about the days of King Uzziah \" He also built towers in the wilderness and dug many cisterns, because he had much livestock in the foothills and in the plain. He had people working his fields and vineyards in the hills and in the fertile lands, for he loved the soil\". These cisterns are still used today by the Bedouin tribes.\nFrom the Roman period, lines of fortifications and roads were found, along the same route chosen by the kings of Judah. The Romans added military camps and forts and other strongholds. It became clear in the survey to what extent the Roman army made an effort to block the path of the Jewish warriors. The romans-built forts and fortresses in the desert above streams and their origins to besiege the Jews and bring them to surrender.\nInformation and findings were also obtained about the aqueducts and many caves discovered in the cliffs. The caves, without exception, in the Judean desert and west of Jericho, were found almost empty of findings, the Bedouins probably preceded the survey teams. Pessah Bar-Adon, the director of the survey in the region, concludes: \"There is no doubt in my mind that the hidden exceeds the revealed, such is true for the entire survey area.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Nallıhan silk needlelace (Turkish: Nallıhan ipek iğne oyası) is a needle lace (Turkish: Oya) from Nallıhan in Ankara, Turkey handcrafted using a needle and silk thread.\nSilk farming has been done traditionally for centuries in Nallıhan. One room of almost every house in town is reserved for silkworm cocoons. Today, local women produce silk needle lace at home, and sale and export them through a cooperative they founded. A needle lace course is held for younger women of the region in order to include them in the traditional art.\nNallıhan was located northwestern of Ankara in Central Anatolia on the historical trade route Silk Road. For a long time, silkworms as well as rice and Angora goats were raised in the town. By silk farming and operating yarn processing facilities, Nallıhan maintained its importance  from the beginning until the middle of the 19th century. In the early 1900s, about 100-150 women were working in the silk yarn plant owned by an Armenian.\nThe silk needle lace, a folk art based on embrodery, was developed with techniques specific to the town in this period. In Turkey, knitting made using tools such as needles, crochet hooks and hairpins is collected under the name of oya. Among these, needle lace is usually made by knotting silk thread into a loop with a needle. Traditional needle lace is produced in many other places of Turkey despite the differences in style, color, construction technique and tools used.\nChanges in commercial value and cutting down of mulberry trees led to the gradual abandonment of silk farming in Nallıhan. Today, raw material for silk needlelace is rarely supplied locally or in households. Despite this, needle lace is part of the culture and economy of the town as a cultural heritage.\nSome of the needle laces are named in accordance with their motifs such as \"Çapkın Bıyığı\" (\"Flirtatious Mustache\"), \"Gönül Kurdu\" (\"Heartworm\"), \"Çalı Bakıldağı\" (\"Bushy Look\"), \"Elma Çiçeği\" (\"Apple Blossom\"), \"Hanım Penceresi\" (\"Lady's Window\"), \"Balık Kılçığı\" (\"Fishbone\"), \"Küpe Oya\" \"(Earring Lace\"), \"Garga Ağzı\" (\"Crow Beak\") etc.\nThe Nallıhan silk needlelace was registered as a Geographical indication of origin on 15 February 2018.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nÖzcan, Fatma (1997).

        "content": "Dedie Abdu Rachim (born 6 April 1966) is an Indonesian politician and former staff of the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) who served as the vice mayor of Bogor, West Java between 2019 and 2024, under Bima Arya Sugiarto.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nDedie Abdu Rachim was born on 6 April 1966 in Garut Regency, West Java. Although Rachim is a Muslim, he studied at the Catholic Regina Pacis School in Bogor. After graduating from Regina Pacis, he studied Industrial Design at the Bandung Institute of Technology. In 2013, Rachim received a master's degree from the University of Indonesia in public administration.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== KPK ===\nAfter completing his studies, Rachim worked as a private employee for some time. In 2005, he passed a selection to become a Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) staff and joined the organization. He was a regular functionary until 2009, then until 2017 he served as director or acting director of several KPK units, including its wealth reporting, research and development, public education, and government relations units. His duties at KPK were primarily public and inter-agency outreach.\n\n\n=== Politics ===\nIn December 2017, incumbent mayor of Bogor Bima Arya offered Rachim to become his running mate in Arya's bid for a second term. On 27 December 2017, Rachim resigned from KPK in order to do so, making him the first active KPK official to resign to take part in an election. Prior KPK officials which entered politics had only done so after retiring from KPK. Arya-Rachim, supported by a coalition of parties including National Mandate Party (PAN), Demokrat, Hanura, Golkar and Nasdem, won in the election with 215,708 votes (43.6%) in a four-candidate race. Rachim was sworn in as vice mayor on 20 April 2019.\nIn February 2024, Rachim joined PAN as a member, as the party gave its support to Rachim to run as mayor in the 2024 mayoral election. Arya and Rachim's term ended on 20 April 2024, and in a farewell speech Arya endorsed Rachim's bid for mayor.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2023–2024 Bangsamoro measles outbreak is an outbreak of measles affecting the autonomous region of Bangsamoro in the Philippines since 2023. An outbreak was first declared in Lanao del Sur on October 9, 2023, with a region-wide outbreak later declared on March 21, 2024.\n\n\n== Outbreak ==\n\n\n=== Outbreak in Lanao del Sur ===\nSince April 29, 2023, there are documentated cases of people experiencing measles symptoms Lanao del Sur. This was observed in the population of Marawi on June 6, 2023 primarily affecting people below ten years old. An increase of trend of measles cases in different provinces of Bangsamoro was observed from August 6 to Septmber 3, 2023 which led to the declaration of a measles outbreak on October 9, 2023 in Lanao del Sur and Marawi on October 9, 2023.\n\n\n=== Regional outbreak ===\nThe measles outbreak was declared in the Bangsamoro region by the local Ministry of Health (MOH) on March 21, 2024. The declaration came after 592 cases and 3 deaths were record in the Bangsamoro since January 1 of that year. Majority of the cases were in Lanao del Sur with 220 people infected.\nThe national Department of Health expressed confidence that no outbreak will happen in other regions of the Philippines. The national health department says that it was only the Bangsamoro region which has not attained herd immunity against measles and rubella with 50 percent coverage – the reason which it states that the outbreak has occurred in the region.\nBy April 17, 2024, 787 cases has been recorded in the Bangsamoro region or 48 percent of the 1,627 cases recorded nationwide for 2024 alone. On the same date, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council recorded 2,064 cases and 14 deaths since 2023 in the Bangsamoro region.\nBy April 23, 2024, 905 cases and 4 deaths been recorded in the Bangsamoro for the year 2024 alone.\n\n\n== Response ==\nThe Bangsamoro health ministry in cooperation of the national Department of Health launched a free measles vaccination drive for people in the region which began on April 1, 2024. By April 17, 2024, 981,805 individuals aged six to ten years old has been vaccinated under the program.\nThe Bangsamoro government also cooperated with the Regional Darul Ifta' of Bangsamoro which insisted through a fatwa that measles vaccines are halal to encourage people to get vaccinated in the Muslim-majority region.\n\n\n== Cases ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Cannabaygal (c.1770 – 17 April 1816), also known as Cannabayagal, Conibigal, Carnimbeigle or Kannabygle, was a warrior of the Gandangara people during the early stages of British colonisation of the Camden region in New South Wales. He was considered as one of the main leaders of local resistance to British occupation in the latter stages of the Hawkesbury and Nepean Wars. He was killed in the Appin massacre during a campaign by the British military in 1816 to subjugate the Gandangara people. His corpse was gibbeted in a tree and later beheaded, with his skull being sent to Scotland for anatomical study.\n\n\n== First meeting with Europeans ==\nCannabaygal first came into contact with European people in 1802 when the French-born ensign of the New South Wales Corps, Francis Barrallier, led a British expedition into the Blue Mountains west of Sydney. There was no direct interaction but Barrallier observed him and his clan hunting game with the aid of fire near the Nattai River. Other Aboriginal men who Barrallier communicated with said that this Gandangara clan was led by a prominent man named Cannabaygal.\nIn 1804, botanist George Caley led an expedition into the same region where he met with Cannabaygal. Caley's Aboriginal guides described Cannabaygal as a feared leader and powerful to the point of invincibility. In Caley's brief meeting with Cannabaygal, he described him as being tall, intimidating yet friendly.\n\n\n== Conflict 1814-1816 ==\nIn 1814, conflict between Aboriginal people and the British colonists in the Camden region flared. Aboriginal and British men, women and children were killed. Raids by Gandangara, Dharug and Dharawal people plundered and destroyed crops and stock. Cannabaygal was considered by the British as one of the main leaders of these raids.\nIn March 1816, Governor Lachlan Macquarie formulated the biggest military operation in the colony to date to bring an end to local Aboriginal resistance in that region. Macquarie declared that 'exemplary and severe punishment' was needed to drive these clans away, and he ordered 'strong detachments of troops...to strike them with terror'.\nThree detachments of the 46th Regiment were organised in April 1816 and sent out to make large sweeps of the region. Macquarie ordered any Aboriginal people found were to surrender as prisoners of war or be fired upon. The bodies of those killed were to be hung in trees to cause greater terror to the survivors. Macquarie also ordered children to be taken and given up to institutions to be taught European ways.\n\n\n== Death during a massacre ==\nThe detachment sent after the Gandangara was led by Captain James Wallis who was in charge of thirty-three grenadiers, two sergeants and several Aboriginal guides including one named Colebee. They tracked Cannabaygal's clan to the upper reaches of the Cataract River. In the early hours of the morning of 17 April 1816, Wallis' force approached the campsite of Cannabaygal's people but found that it was a deserted decoy camp. However, the cry of a child alerted the soldiers to the real camp nearby and they attacked. At least fourteen of the clan were massacred either by being shot or from injuries as they fled down the steep rocky hillside that bordered the camp. This has become known as the Appin massacre. \nCannabaygal was shot five times and killed. Another Gandangara leader named Dunelle also died. Most of the others killed were women and old men. In line with Macquarie's instructions, the corpses of Cannabaygal and Dunelle were gibbeted from a tree on a nearby prominent hill.\n\n\n== Skull sent to the University of Edinburgh ==\n\nNot long after his body was taken down from the tree, Cannabaygal's head was removed, as was that of Dunelle's and  also a woman who had been killed in the massacre. The heads were taken to Sydney where the colonial government bought them for 30 shillings and a gallon of rum each. The heads were removed of flesh to obtain the skulls of Cannabaygal and the others. These skulls were sent to the University of Edinburgh where Cannabaygal's was featured in an 1820 book on phrenology by Sir George Mackenzie. According to Mackenzie's take on the racist quackery of phrenology, the anatomy of Cannabaygal's skull displayed the weak reasoning powers and strong emotions of Aboriginal Australians.\nCannabaygal's skull was repatriated to Australia in 1991.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Indigenous Australian historical figures\n\n\n== References ==",

Taylor (January 28, 1927 – April 26, 2016) was one of the first African American principals in Los Angeles and went on to serve in the No. 2 position in the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD).\n\n\n== Background ==\nJames Brainard Taylor was the son of William Horace, a postman, and Louise Evangeline (Ponder) Taylor, a homemaker.\n\n\n== Early education and career ==\nTaylor graduated from Manual Arts High School in Los Angeles. From there he attended UCLA, where he received his bachelor's degree in mathematics. He also earned a master's degree in education at USC. \nHe served as a staff sergeant in the Army, where he taught math to fellow soldiers.\n\n\n== Educator and school administrator ==\nHis first job at the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) was as a math teacher at John Adams Junior High (now John Adams Middle School). That was followed by a stint at Hamilton High School.\nIn 1957, Taylor moved into administration when he was hired as a vice principal at John H. Francis Polytechnic High School in Sun Valley. When the principal retired in 1962, Taylor was promoted to fill his position.  This was the first time that a Black person was in charge of a high school in LAUSD with a predominantly white student body.\nIn 1967, he became the first principal of Alain LeRoy Locke High School in Watts.\nAfter his assignment at Locke, Taylor became a deputy superintendent at LAUSD. This was during a time of a divisiveness within the district over the issue of integration. Taylor advocated for a measured approach to integration. He favored voluntary programs such as magnet schools to achieve integration.\nAfter retiring from his post at LAUSD, he returned to Adams to teach math.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe Ánimo James B. Taylor Charter Middle School in Watts is named after him.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The monastery of Tazert is a Roman Catholic monastery in Tazert, Morocco. Originally founded by André Poissonnier, it is a priory of the Sisters of St. Francis of Assisi since 2019.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe monastery was founded in 1931 by André Poissonnier who, inspired by the life of Charles de Foucauld and the Franciscan missionaries in Morocco, decided to live as a hermit in Tazert. For this, he set up a dispensary and a chapel where he lived as a hermit until his death due to typhus in 1938.\nPoissonnier left the monastery to the Franciscans who continued to live in the monastery until the 1970s when a community of Poor Clares moved in. In order to be closer to the local population, they adopted the Melkite rite which is celebrated in Arabic.\nIn 2013, these nuns under their hegumenia Mère Assunta retired to the Monastery of the Burning Bush in Carcassone as there were no longer enough sisters to ensure a presence.\nThe monastery then went over into the possession of the diocese of Rabat which started to search for a new monastic community to settle in Tazert. Finally, in late 2019, the Sisters of St. Francis of Assisi, a congregation whose motherhouse is located in Montpellier and who have also a presence in Mohammedia, sent a group of African nuns to Tazert. The inauguration took place on 8 December 2019 under participation of the archbishop of Rabat, Cristóbal López Romero.\nToday the monastery serves as a place of prayer, offering spiritual retreat facilities with a guest house and educational opportunities for the surrounding Berber village of 3,500. As such, the nuns offer training in embroidery techniques as well as teaching literacy and computer science courses.\nThe monastery hosts interreligious dialogue sessions.\n\n\n== Reference ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nHenning, Christophe (13 December 2019). \"In Morocco, new life to Tazert monastery\".

        "content": "Cochemiea blossfeldiana is a species of Cochemiea found in Mexico.\n\n\n== Description ==\nCochemiea blossfeldiana typically grows alone, though sometimes in clusters. It has spherical to briefly cylindrical gray-green bodies, reaching 5 centimeters in height and 3 to 4 centimeters in diameter. Its conical warts lack milky sap, and its axillae are thinly woolly. The plant bears 4 dark brown to black central spines, 1 to 1.2 centimeters long, with the lowest one hooking outward and the upper ones straight. Additionally, it features 15 to 20 marginal spines, yellow with dark tips, measuring 0.5 to 0.7 centimeters long.\nIts funnel-shaped flowers, white with pink to crimson stripes, are 2 centimeters long and 2 to 4 centimeters in diameter. The club-shaped fruits are orange-red, containing black pitted seeds.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nThese plants grow in decomposing granite and gravelly soil in Baja California and Guadalupe and Cedros Islands, Mexico, at elevations of 0 to 150 meters. They thrive in arid plains near the coast in the Lower Sonora Desert zone, specifically at Santa Rosalillita, and on steep coastal slopes at Punta Baja, Boca Marrón, and Punta María. Further south, they can be found near Mezquital.\n\n\n== Subspecies ==\nThere are two recognized subspecies:\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nFriedrich Bödeker first described the plant as Mammillaria blossfeldiana in 1931, who named it in honor of German gardener Robert Blossfeld. Peter B. Breslin and Lucas C. Majure transferred the species to Cochemiea in 2021.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Cochemiea blossfeldiana at Wikimedia Commons\n Data related to Cochemiea blossfeldiana at Wikispecies",

        "content": "The Soul of Anna Klane is a 1977 Science Fiction novel by Terrel Miedaner. The plot centers on the trial of the scientist Anatol Klane, the father of Anna Klane, an exceptional ten-years-old child. Klane is accused of Anna's murder following a brain surgery she underwent; he claims his daughter's soul departed from her body in the surgery (to which he objected), and the defense line centers around trying to scientifically prove the existence of souls in humans.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe book received mostly mediocre reviews upon its release, with Kirkus Review  noting that \"If pop metaphysics am your game, there are a few sparks in the courtroom dialogue; otherwise... bzzzt\", and Newgate Callendar, in a review of several crime novels in The New York Times noting that while the opening is interesting, \"after a while the book bogs down in didacticism\". A more scorching review was published in The Wichita Beacon, calling the book an \"engagingly silly novel\" and cynically concluding that \"one suspects ... the author ate too much pizza before going to bed one night, with the resulting dreams turned into this book.\"\n\n\n== Discussions and adaptations ==\nTwo sections from the book, \"The Soul of Martha, a Beast\" (an excerpt from Chapter 13) and \"The Soul of the Mark III Beast\" (an excerpt from Chapter 23) were included in The Mind's I, with reflections about both provided by Douglas R. Hofstadter.\nThe section \"The Soul of Martha, a Beast\" was also the basis for the 1995 short film The Beast, which competed in the 1995 Cannes Film Festival short film competition.\n\n\n== Notes ==",

        "content": "The Sugarcane Development and By-Products Company (Persian: شرکت توسعه نیشکر و صنایع جانبی) is an Iranian holding company that operates in the field of sugar production and its by-products. This company is located in Khuzestan Province. The Sugarcane Development Company has seven subsidiaries with a total production capacity of 700,000 tons of sugar per year. The names of these seven subsidiaries are: Salman Farsi, Hakim Farabi, Imam Khomeini, Amir Kabir, Da'bal Khazaei, Mirza Kuchak Khan, and Dehkhoda. In 2021, the Haft Tappeh Sugarcane Agro-Industry Co. was taken from its private owner by a court ruling, and its management was handed over to the Sugarcane Development and By-Products holding company.\n\n\n== History ==\nConsidering Iran's need for sugar, the Sugar Council was formed in Iran in 1983. Through studies carried out by the Sugar Studies Fund from 1984 to 1986, the necessity of establishing the Sugarcane Development and By-Products Company was approved by the Islamic Consultative Assembly. Due to Iran's need for sugar and to prevent its import, the Sugarcane Development and By-Products Company was established in 1990 in Ahvaz. Based on a resolution by Iran's Islamic Consultative Assembly, the Ministry of Agriculture was obligated to establish 7 sugarcane agro-industrial units on lands with an area of 84,000 hectares to achieve self-sufficiency in supplying Iran's sugar. It also had to build sugar refineries, livestock feed plants, medium-density fiberboard (MDF) factories, paper mills, and required biotechnology plants such as yeast and alcohol with suitable capacity.\n\n\n== Subsidiaries ==\n\n\n=== Salman Farsi ===\nThe Salman Farsi Agro-Industry Company is one of the subsidiaries of the Sugarcane Development and By-Products holding company. This company is located on an area of about 12,000 hectares in the lands east of the Karun River and 40 kilometers southwest of the Ahvaz-Abadan road. The Salman Farsi Company has the capacity to produce 100,000 tons of sugarcane in each cultivation season and 100,000 tons of raw sugar.\n\n\n=== Hakim Farabi ===\nThe Hakim Farabi Sugarcane Agro-Industry Company is one of the eight subsidiaries of the Sugarcane Development and By-Products Company, established in 1994. The Hakim Farabi Company is located at kilometer 30 of the Ahvaz-Abadan road, east of the Karun River. The area of its cultivated lands is about 15,000 hectares, and its main objectives are sugarcane cultivation, production of raw sugar and refined (white) sugar, livestock feed, and paper.\n\n\n=== Imam Khomeini ===\nThe Imam Khomeini Sugarcane Agro-Industry Company is one of the eight subsidiaries of the Sugarcane Development and By-Products Company. It is located in the Shuaybiyeh region of Shushtar County, between the Shatit River (a branch of the Karun River) and the Dez River, 30 kilometers south of Shushtar County. The approximate area of the company is 15,300 hectares, bordered by the northern hills of Shuaybiyeh Plain to the north, the Dez River to the west, the Shatit River to the east, and the lands of Dehkhoda Agro-Industry Company to the south. The length of its cultivated lands is about 34 kilometers, with a width ranging from a minimum of 5 kilometers to a maximum of 15 kilometers.\n\n\n=== Amir Kabir ===\nThe Amir Kabir Sugarcane Agro-Industry Company, one of the eight subsidiaries of the Sugarcane Development and By-Products Company, is located at kilometer 45 of the Ahvaz-Khorramshahr road. The gross area of this agro-industry's lands is 15,000 hectares, and the net area is 12,000 hectares. The Amir Kabir Sugarcane Agro-Industry Company was inaugurated in 2000. This company produces raw (brown) sugar and refined (white) sugar.\n\n\n=== Da'bal Khazaei ===\nThe Da'bal Khazaei Sugarcane Agro-Industry Company is one of the subsidiaries of the Sugarcane Development and By-Products holding company operating in the field of sugarcane products. This company is located on an area of 12,000 hectares in the lands east of the Karun River and 25 kilometers southeast of the Ahvaz-Abadan road. This company has a production capacity of 100,000 tons of raw (Brown) sugar and 175,000 tons of refined (white) sugar per year.\n\n\n=== Mirza Kuchak Khan ===\nThe Mirza Kuchak Khan Sugarcane Agro-Industry Company is one of the eight subsidiaries of the Sugarcane Development and By-Products holding company operating in the field of sugarcane cultivation and its products. This company is located 75 kilometers southwest of Ahvaz, between the Karun River and the Ahvaz-Khorramshahr road. The lands of this company were recaptured from the Iraqi army along with Khorramshahr during the Operation Beit ol-Moqaddas in May-June 1982.\n\n\n=== Dehkhoda ===\nThe Dehkhoda Sugarcane Agro-Industry Company is one of the subsidiaries of the Sugarcane Development and By-Products holding company. This company is located on an area of 11,369 hectares in the north of Ahvaz, between the Andimeshk road and the Karun River, at kilometer 23 of the Doghagholeh road. The production capacity of this company is 100,000 tons of raw (Brown) sugar, 175,000 tons of refined (white) sugar, 30 to 38,000 tons of molasses and its products, and 330,000 tons of bagasse. The Dehkhoda Company was established with investments from Bank Saderat and Bank Melli.\n\n\n=== Haft Tappeh ===\nThe Haft Tappeh Sugarcane Agro-Industry Company was a national project under the ownership of the Ministry of Agriculture since its establishment. This company was inaugurated on December 9, 1961 in the presence of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, Ali Amini (Prime Minister), and Arsanjani (Minister of Agriculture). On the December 22, 1975, the articles of association for the Haft Tappeh Sugar Company affiliated with the Ministry of Agriculture, with an initial capital of 4 billion Rials, were approved by the National Consultative Assembly. According to the law, the government was obliged to valuate the company and sell up to 99% of its shares. After the Islamic Revolution, the Haft Tappeh Sugar Company was handed over to the National Iranian Industries Organization, and the company was again fully controlled by the Ministry of Industry, Mine and Trade. Years later, this company was entrusted to the Industrial Development and Renovation Organization of Iran (IDRO). The reduction in sugar import tariffs caused huge losses for this company. In 2015, the Iranian Privatization Organization transferred the Haft Tappeh Sugar Company through a deal to two private companies named Zeus and Aryak. The value of this deal was 2,910 billion Rials, but the buyers only paid 60 billion Rials in cash, and the remaining debt was installmentized over eight annual installments.\nFrom the very beginning, there were doubts and suspicions about the manner of privatization of the company. The problems of Haft Tappeh workers also began after the privatization of the company, to the extent that their salaries were always paid with a few months' delay after privatization. This led to the start of workers' protests.  \nAfter several years of workers' protests, finally some representatives of the Tehran parliament reacted to the protests of Haft Tappeh Company workers.\nEventually, September-October 2021, the management of the Haft Tappeh Sugarcane Company was handed over by the Industrial Development and Renovation Organization of Iran to the Sugarcane Development and By-Products Company. Since then, the Haft Tappeh Sugarcane Company has become the eighth sugarcane agro-industrial unit under the Sugarcane Development and By-Products holding company.\n\n\n== Shareholders ==\n40% of the shares of the Sugarcane Development and By-Products Company belong to Bank Saderat Iran, 40% to Bank Melli Iran, and 20% to the Ministry of Agriculture Jihad representing the government.\n\n\n== Sugarcane Development and COVID-19 ==\nThe Sugarcane Development Company has the largest alcohol production company in Iran. This company supplies a significant portion of Iran's disinfectant producers during the coronavirus outbreak.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Narcisse Mathias Juneau (November 14, 1821 – March 26, 1883) was an American farmer, interpreter, and pioneer of Wisconsin and Kansas.  He served two terms in the Wisconsin State Assembly, representing northeast Dodge County.  He was a son of Solomon Juneau, the founder of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  \n\n\n== Biography ==\nNarcisse Juneau was born in Green Bay, but raised in what is now the city of Milwaukee.  At the time, it was a few small settlements in what was then the Michigan Territory.  He received a basic education, and from an early age worked as an assistant and interpreter for his father in the fur trade.  His mother was half Menominee Indian, and Narcisse was raised speaking several different Indian languages, including Potawatomi, Menominee, Iroquois, Oneida, Chippewa, and Kickapoo.\nHe resided in Milwaukee until 1852, when he moved to the town of Theresa, in Dodge County, Wisconsin.  He was elected register of deeds of Dodge County in 1852, and was then elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly in 1854 and 1857.\nIn 1864, he was adopted into the Citizen Potawatomi Nation in Kansas and worked as an interpreter for the tribe.  He assisted the tribe's move to Oklahoma (then the Indian Territory) when they sold their land in Kansas.  Juneau remained in Kansas with his family, and farmed a plot of land in Shawnee County, Kansas, where he died on March 26, 1883.\n\n\n== Personal life and family ==\nNarcisse Juneau was the eldest son of Solomon Juneau and his wife Josette Vieau Juneau.  Solomon Juneau was a fur trader in the Wisconsin Territory and was one of the founders of Milwaukee, having established a settlement known as Juneautown on the land east of the Milwaukee River in 1818.  Josette was the daughter of French Canadian fur trader Jacques Vieau, the first white person to permanently settle in Milwaukee.\n\n\n== References ==",

When we got there, I pulled up this beat that me, WhoJiggi, and FckBwoy! made. I liked the beat drop, but it dropped too fast. So I'm like, \"I don't wanna hear the beat yet. Just loop this part for me,\" and then me and Bay jumped into the booth. We had girls in the booth, and we were just going crazy. One chick was annoying Bay Swag, and he was like, \"I'm trying to work.\" Then she asked me, \"I'm annoying you?\" I'm like, \"Nah, you're my inspiration.\" But it was fun, though. For me, making music is fun, so we didn't put too much thought into it. But we knew it was fire though.\n\n\n== Composition ==\nWith respect to style, the song has been described as \"sexy drill\". Cash Cobain performs in his signature slurry vocals, addressing a girl in the opening lines (which includes the lyrics \"And your ass fat, know you eat your rice and your cabbage too\"). The beat drops two minutes into the song, after the line \"Just like 'And this beat from Cash not from YouTube' – yup, that's me, magic.\"\n\n\n== Release and promotion ==\nCash Cobain teased the song on social media prior to its release. He and Bay Swag performed the song on the YouTube series From the Block, following which the video of their performance gained traction on YouTube and Instagram. The song received an official dance called the \"Reemski\", which led it to become a viral sensation on the video-sharing app TikTok. A number of celebrities have posted videos of themselves taking part in the dance, including Kai Cenat, La La Anthony and her son, and Lance Stephenson.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nAlphonse Pierre of Pitchfork gave a favorable review, describing the beat as \"dreamy yet jerky, the kind of slow-building rhythm that makes you want to fantasize about the last person you flirted with.\" He added, \"Then there's Cash and Bay Swag's killer back-and-forth. The two Queens boys sweetly—and very provocatively—blur the lines between thirst and romance\".\n\n\n== Remix ==\nOn April 18, 2024, a remix of the song featuring American rapper Ice Spice leaked online. It was uploaded to YouTube by DJ Akademiks, who had received an anonymous DM with the remix on April 18. On April 20, Cash Cobain and Ice Spice were seen filming a music video for the remix in New York City.\n\n\n== References ==",

REDEMPTION.\nIt originally ran for only a week at the Alexandra Theatre in Melbourne, and had an unsuccessful revival there in 1890 and in Sydney in 1893.\n\n\n== Rival versions ==\nDampier's production of the novel was not the only one available to audiences at the time. In 1886 there was a production adapted by George Leitch In 1887 there was another production in Sydney based on an adaptation by \"T. South\". Walter Baker also did an adaptation. However Dampier's was allegedly the only production which paid a royalty to Clarke's widow.\n\n\n== Second version of play ==\n\nDampier later worked on another version with Thomas Walker, His Natural Life, which had a more successful run in Sydney in 1895, with Rolfe playing Rufus Dawes, Alfred Dampier as Reverend North, and Lily Dampier as Sylvia Vickers. The play structured the story to emphasise the role of Reverend North.\nThe critic from the Sydney Morning Herald described it as:\n\nInferior to Robbery Under Arms [another novel adapted by Dampier] as regards dialogue and construction, the characters are for the most part the merest puppets of melodrama, and the dramatic situations are far from convincing. Against all this, on the other hand, the play has to its credit the advantage of an intricate plot clearly set out, of rapid action of a sensational kind and two of three beautiful tableaux – elements of good which caused it to be welcomed on Saturday with the most extravagant expressions of delight.\nThis play was often revived over the next few years. Alfred Dampier's last performance on stage was as Reverend North in a production of the play on 10 November 1905.\nThe play was still being revived in 1912 and 1913.\n\n\n== References ==",

Rogers Centre and Scotiabank Arena are the highest capacity venues in the city, and they host most of the shows by superstar artists. Additionally, Toronto has the third largest concert market in the world, after New York and Los Angeles.\nLive Nation Canada owns many of the large and mid sized venues in Toronto, including Budweiser Stage, History, The Opera House, The Danforth Music Hall, and Velvet Underground. This has been criticized by some as \"monopolistic\" and \"big-footing\". Supporters believe Live Nation is a benefit as it acquires venues that may otherwise go out of business, but critics say their practices push out independent venues and smaller promoters.\n\n\n== Map ==\nThe following is an interactive map of Toronto's music venues with concert capacities greater than 1,000 people.\n\n\n== Large venues ==\nThis section includes music venues with a capacity greater than 1,000 people.

It will be the 20th event under the Slammiversary chronology.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nSlammiversary is a professional wrestling pay-per-view event produced by Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) to celebrate the anniversary of the company's first event, which was held on June 19, 2002. As such, the event is usually held in the summer (June or July). The first event took place nearly a year after that event on June 18, 2003, and has since been considered one of Impact's premiere PPV events, along with Bound for Glory and – since 2020 – Hard To Kill, and Rebellion.\nOn April 20, 2024, at Rebellion, it was announced by TNA that Slammiversary would take place on July 20, 2024, at Verdun Auditorium in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.\n\n\n=== Storylines ===\nThe event will feature several professional wrestling matches, which involve different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds, plots, and storylines. Wrestlers portray heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminate in a wrestling match or series of matches. Storylines are produced on the company's weekly programs, Impact! and Xplosion.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "The Tête d'enfant de trois quarts à droite is a silverpoint drawing on paper by the Florentine painter Leonardo da Vinci. It belongs to the Codex Vallardi and is preserved at the Department of Graphic Arts of the Louvre Museum in Paris.\nThis small-sized drawing portrays the head of a very young child. This is a preparatory study for the head of the infant John the Baptist in the Louvre Museum version of The Virgin of the Rocks, which was commissioned by the Brotherhood of the Immaculate Conception. It was likely created around 1483 and is one of the last three known studies related to this painting.\nThe drawing is characterized by melancholy and introspection, and it falls within the artist's favored theme of depicting babies. This drawing exhibits all of Leonardo da Vinci's qualities as a draftsman. Although it underwent retouching, which may have raised questions about its authenticity, it remains an excellent example of his work.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe drawing of the Tête d'enfant de trois quarts à droite is on a paper sheet prepared with gray-beige. This sheet is irregularly cut and then pasted onto another, thicker paper sheet prepared with gray-brown. The ovoid-shaped drawing support measures 13.4 × 11.9 cm, while the sheet onto which it is glued measures 16.9 × 14.0 cm. The drawing was made using a metal tip enhanced with white, and it has been revised with ink using a quill and brush. The drawing depicts the head of a very young child, with prick marks around the contours of the eyes, nose, ear, and the top of the skull. On the back of the sheet, there are traces and annotations made with quill and brown ink.\nThere is a line under the middle of the chin marking a fragment of the left shoulder, but no indication of the rest of the body. Additionally, the position of the head implies a clockwise rotation. Furthermore, the light source appears to be coming from the right side of the viewer, as evidenced by the bright highlights on the child's forehead and cheeks.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Creation background ===\nLeonardo da Vinci created the Tête d'enfant de trois quarts à droite when he was thirty years old and had recently moved to Milan from the Florentine workshop of Verrocchio. Despite being a recognized artist, he lacked the connections to receive enough commissions to live off his art in Milan. Meeting Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis, a well-known painter at the court of Ludovico Sforza, also known as the Moor, was very beneficial. De Predis helped the author become known to the local aristocracy. Thus, the artist was commissioned to decorate the Immaculate Conception altarpiece, which was the centerpiece of a newly built chapel between 1475 and 1480 in the Church of San Francesco Maggiore in Milan. Three artists were involved in gilding the woodwork and sculpted parts, as well as painting the panels. Leonardo da Vinci was commissioned to create the central panel, which would later be titled The Virgin of the Rocks. The drawing is possibly a fragment of the original cartoon and is part of this creation.\n\n\n=== Attribution and date ===\n\nArt historians have long believed that the drawing originated from the circle of Leonardo da Vinci, including students or workshop members such as Ambrogio de Predis or Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio. This is due to the presence of certain technical treatments that are clearly not by the master's hand, such as the white highlights and ink revisions.\nHowever, it seems that these treatments were added after the creation of the work, as indicated by the presence of underlying drawings in these areas. The Tête d'enfant de trois quarts à droite may have served as a pedagogical support, as was common in the master's workshop. Thus, Leonardo is now universally recognized as the author of the artwork. The technical mastery displayed, such as the rendering of shadows on the cheek and temple, along with comparisons to other drawings of the painter, such as the Head of a Woman in Profile, a study dating from the early 1490s for the painting of the Madonna Litta, provide strong evidence for this attribution. Art historian Françoise Viatte summarizes this new state of research as follows: \"According to all researchers, this face is the creation of Leonardo and no one else\".\nThe technique used by the master places it within the Florentine period of his production. It is confirmed that the drawing is a study or even a cartoon for the face of the child John the Baptist in the Louvre's version of The Virgin of the Rocks, to which it almost perfectly superimposes. These elements allow it to be dated around 1483.\n\n\n=== Journey of the work ===\nThe drawing was acquired by the Louvre Museum in 1856 as part of a codex that bears the name of Giuseppe Vallardi (1784–1861), a print and antiquities dealer who had previously owned it. The codex is a collection of drawings by various Renaissance artists. Since then, it has been preserved in the Department of Graphic Arts at the Louvre Museum in Paris.\n\n\n== Creation ==\nThe Tête d'enfant de trois quarts à droite drawing was likely created as a preparatory cartoon for the Louvre version of The Virgin of the Rocks. The head almost perfectly aligns with that of the little Saint John the Baptist, except for the eyelids. The cartoon also features numerous prick marks along the head's contour, indicating a transfer to another support. However, this hypothesis remains uncertain as the transfer by pricks may have occurred after the creation of The Virgin of the Rocks, and therefore, it may not have been executed by Leonardo da Vinci himself, but by one of his students on their own production. Art historian Carlo Pedretti once suggested that the drawing was a study for a Madonna of the Cat, but later agreed with his colleagues' opinion.\nThe work's life did not end with its creation. It underwent several retouches, including the addition of white highlights on the ear, lower part of the chin, and cheek, as well as the reworking of certain features. However, the study indicates that a right-handed artist carried out the latter changes, making it impossible for Leonardo, who was left-handed, to have made them.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nOnly three studies for the Louvre version of La Vierge aux rochers have survived. These include a young woman's head, a drawing considered to be a preparatory study for the head of the archangel Uriel (preserved in the Royal Library of Turin), and another presumed by Leonardo for the angel's hand pointing to the infant John the Baptist (preserved in the Royal Library of Windsor Castle). Tête d'enfant de trois quarts à droite is located on the right.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Analysis ==\n\n\n=== Leonardo and the depiction of children ===\nLeonardo created the drawing for Tête d'enfant de trois quarts à droite (in Englishː Child's head, three-quarters right) around 1483. He was already practicing child portraiture and had learned the basic schemes from his master Verrocchio. Throughout his life, drawing babies remained one of Leonardo's favorite themes, from his early days in Florence to the end of his life in France. He demonstrated real virtuosity in depicting them, as evidenced by the various studies he produced throughout his career. The drawings were created within the secular framework of mythology, such as the representation of the winds. However, they were more commonly produced within the theme of the Madonna and Child, including the Nativity and Adoration of the Magi, as well as featuring Jesus and Saint John the Baptist, such as in La Vierge aux rochers and the Saint Anne group. In cases where the child's head is turned three-quarters to the right, the two figures often form an independent group, which the artist preferred to depict.\n\n\tExamples of drawings by Leonardo da Vinci on the theme of the child: secular subject, Virgin and Child and Jesus and John the Baptist.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== A melancholic work ===\nThe drawing is often described as conveying a sense of melancholy. The child's expression is introspective, with a pensive gaze. This may reflect the mystery of the encounter between Saint John the Baptist and Jesus, as depicted in La Vierge aux rochers.\n\n\n== Posterity ==\nLeonardo da Vinci is renowned for reusing his research from one work to the next. Scientific imaging reveals that he reused the drawing of the child's head in three-quarter view on the right in the underlying drawing of the London version of La Vierge aux rochers. This version presents a project for which the painter made initial sketches before covering them for the creation of his Virgin. The child in the sketches is identified by researchers as Jesus, with his features superimposed on him in mirror image.\nLikewise, Boltraffio, a renowned painter who borrowed certain motifs from Leonardo, used the drawing. In his painting, La Vierge à l'Enfant, the face of the infant Jesus is a clear reuse of the Child's Head drawing. It is unlikely that Boltraffio used the drawing in the Louvre, but rather a transferred copy of it.\nThis face is also present in a lunette frescoed in the cloister of the convent of the Church of Sant'Onofrio on the Janiculum (Italian: Chiesa di Sant'Onofrio al Gianicolo), in Rome. The fresco depicts a Madonna and Child with a donor, painted by Cesare da Sesto, another disciple of the Florentine master.\n\nThe drawing has been featured in numerous exhibitions in tribute to the painter, including one at the National Gallery in London from November 2011 to February 2012. The exhibition catalog 'Leonardo da Vinci: Painter at the Court of Milan', edited by Luke Syson and Larry Keith, was published on this occasion.\n\tLeonardo da Vinci's drawing served as a working basis for many of his followers.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Appendix ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n==== Books ====\nBlatt, Katy (2018).

        "content": "Barshyn (Kazakh: Баршын), also known as Barsen (Kazakh: Барсен), is a lake in Astrakhan District, Akmola Region, Kazakhstan.\nThe lake is located 35 km (22 mi) to the west of Astrakhanka, the district capital. The now abolished village of Kainarskoye (Kazakh: Қайнарское), part of the Uzynkol Rural District, was located by the southern shore. Three fishermen on a boat were lost in the lake in 2020. After a 3-day long search the bodies of two of them were located, but the body of the third was found only two weeks later.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nBarshyn is a freshwater lake part of the Ishim river basin. It is located about 4 km (2.5 mi) to the southwest of the Ishim river channel. The lake is exorheic; a watercourse flows from the southwestern end and the lake water drains through an intermittent riverbed towards the east.\nThe water of lake Barshyn is fresh. The lake is relatively deep. It usually freezes at the beginning of November and thaws by the end of April. Lake Uzynkol lies 9 km (5.6 mi) to the southeast.\n\n\n== Flora and fauna ==\nThe lakeshore is covered with reeds and there is much submerged aquatic vegetation. The reeds are harvested by local people. Fish and birds caught in the lake are important for the economy of nearby villages.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of lakes of Kazakhstan\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Barshyn at Wikimedia Commons\nТело пропавшего рыбака нашли в Акмолинской области (in Russian)",

        "content": "Curtis B. Piercy (born July 1, 1962 – March 21, 2004) was an American professional stock car racing driver. He competed in the ARCA Re/Max Series from 1992 to 2000.\n\n\n== Racing career ==\nPiercy began his racing career driving demolition derby cars.\nIn 1992, Piercy made his debut in the ARCA Hooters SuperCar Series at the DuQuoin State Fairgrounds dirt-track, driving the No. 88 Chevrolet for Ron Turpin, where he started and finished in 37th after running only nine laps due to engine issues. He then made another start at DuQuoin the following year, this time driving the No. 78 Oldsmobile, where he finished 36th due to a crash three laps in the race. It was also during this year that he tested a NASCAR Winston Cup Series car at Daytona International Speedway. Afterwards, Piercy made a start in the NASCAR Busch All-Star Tour at Mason Speedway, where he finished nineteenth. He then attempted one ARCA race in 1995 at Salem Speedway, but ultimately failed to qualify.\nIn 1996, Piercy ran fifteen ARCA races, primarily driving for Ron Turpin, where he achieved a best finish of sixth at Salem and finished tenth in the final points standings. He then made seventeen starts for Turpin the following year, this time getting a best finish of twelfth at the Illinois State Fairgrounds dirt-track, and finished eleventh in the points.\nIn 1998, Piercy ran the full schedule for Turpin, where he achieved two top-ten finishes, both at Springfield and DuQuoin, with a best result of eighth at the former event, on his way to finish seventh in the final points standings. He then ran full-time again the following year, where he achieved two top-ten finishes with a best result of fourth at Berlin Raceway on his way to finish eleventh in the points, before switching to a part time schedule in 2000. After getting two more top-tens that year, he retired from racing after Talladega Superspeedway, where he finished in nineteenth.\n\n\n== Personal life & death ==\nPiercy, alongside his wife Linda, owned both Piercy Auto Body and Piercy Powder Coating, companies based in Carlock, Illinois.\n\n\n=== Death ===\nOn March 23, 2004, it was reported that a plane that Piercy was flying had gone missing. Piercy, along with six other passengers, including his wife Linda, Don Maurer and his wife Amy, Brad Webb and his girlfriend Erica Edgington, were said to also have been on board the plane, as all six  were flying back from attending the NASCAR Nextel Cup Series race at Darlington Raceway held that week. The remains of the plane were found two days later in a wooded area of Little Black Mountain in Harlan County, Kentucky, where the bodies of Piercy and the other passengers were found dead in the plane.\n\n\n== Motorsports career results ==\n\n\n=== ARCA Bondo/Mar-Hyde Series ===\n(key) (Bold – Pole position awarded by qualifying time. Italics – Pole position earned by points standings or practice time. * – Most laps led. ** – All laps led.)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCurt Piercy driver statistics at Racing-Reference",

        "content": "Ourisia confertifolia is a species of flowering plant in the family Plantaginaceae that is endemic to high-elevations in the southern South Island of New Zealand. Mary Kalin Arroyo described O. confertifolia in 1984. Plants of this species of New Zealand mountain foxglove are perennial, small-leaved rosette herbs that have hairy, crenate leaves, and flowers single or in pairs in each node. The corolla tube is glabrous and yellow inside. It is listed as At Risk - Naturally Uncommon.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nOurisia confertifolia Arroyo is in the plant family Plantaginaceae. Mary Kalin Arroyo described O. confertifolia 1984.\nThe type material was collected by Mary Kalin Arroyo at Gertrude Saddle, Fiordland National Park, South Island, New Zealand. The holotype is housed at the Allan Herbarium of Manaaki Whenua – Landcare Research.\nOurisia confertifolia is morphologically similar to other New Zealand small-leaved species, namely O. sessilifolia, O. simpsonii, and O. spathulata, with which it shares irregular white corollas and having a mixture of glandular and non-glandular hairs on many plant parts.\nO. confertifolia can be distinguished from O. sessilifolia by its corolla tube that is yellow and glabrous (hairless) inside (vs. purple and with 1 or 3 lines of hairs), flowers and bracts in pairs only (vs. sometimes in whorls), irregular calyces (vs. regular), and leaves that are glabrous on the underside (vs. hairy).\nO. confertifolia can be distinguished from O. simpsonii by a number of characters including its smaller, narrower flowers (especially the style which is < 4.8 mm in O. confertifolia vs. > 4.9 mm in O. simpsonii) which are yellow inside the corolla tube (vs. yellow and sometimes purple in O. simpsonii). The glandular hairs on the pedicels of O. confertifolia are the same length as the non-glandular hairs (whereas they are much smaller in O. simpsonii). The two species have non-overlapping geographic distributions, with O. simpsonii in the northern South Island only.\n\nO. confertifolia can be distinguished from O. spathulata by its rosette habit (vs. leaves found along the stem), leaves with a silky appearance on the upper side (vs. densely glandular-hairy with a velvety appearance on the upper side, and usually shorter inflorescences (< 9 cm long vs. > 10 cm long).\n\n\n== Description ==\nOurisia confertifolia plants are perennial herbs. The stems are creeping, with leaves usually tightly packed into rosettes or subrosettes. Leaf petioles are 3.5–15.0 mm long. Leaf blades are 4.8–15.3 mm long by 5.5–16.3 mm wide (length: width ratio 0.7–1.3: 1), spathulate, broadly obovate or very broadly obovate, widest above the middle, with a rounded apex, cuneate base and obscurely and regularly crenate (or sometimes notched) edges. Leaves are densely hairy and silky with a mixture of long glandular and non-glandular hairs on the upper surface but mostly glabrous, densely punctate and with prominent veins on the lower surface. Inflorescences are erect, densely hairy racemes up to 105 mm long, with a mixture of glandular and non-glandular hairs, and with 1–3 flowering nodes and up to 6 total flowers per raceme. Each flowering node has 1–2 flowers and 2 sessile, clasping bracts that are oblanceolate to broadly obovate. The lowest bracts are similar to the leaves, 7.7–12.6 mm long and 3.8–7.6 mm wide, and become smaller toward the apex of the raceme. The flowers are borne on a densely hairy pedicel that is up to 21 mm long and has a mixture of glandular and non-glandular hairs. The calyx is 5.5–8.8 mm long, irregular, with 3 lobes divided to about one-quarter the length of the calyx and 2 divided to near the base, and densely hairy with a mixture of glandular and non-glandular hairs. The corolla is 14.5–19.4 mm long (including the 4.8–11.0 mm long corolla tube), bilabiate, tubular-funnelform, glabrous and white on the outside, and glabrous and yellow on the inside. The corolla lobes are 6.8–9.6 mm long, spreading, and obovate. There are 4 stamens up to 7.6 mm long which are didynamous, with two long stamens included inside the corolla or exserted, and 2 short stamens included inside the corolla or reaching the tube opening; a short staminode c. 0.2 mm long is also sometimes present. The style is 3.2–4.8 mm long, included inside the corolla tube or exserted, with an emarginate stigma. The ovary is 2.6–4.6 mm long and glabrous. Fruits are capsules 4.5–7.1 mm long and 3.3–4.8 mm wide with loculicidal dehiscence and pedicels up to 21.6 mm long. There are about 240 tiny seeds in each capsule, 0.7–1.0 mm long and 0.4–0.5 mm wide, with a two-layered, reticulate seed coat.\nOurisia confertifolia flowers from November to February and fruits from January to May.\nThe chromosome number of Ourisia confertifolia is 2n=48.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nOurisia confertifolia is a New Zealand mountain foxglove that is endemic to the South Island of New Zealand.  It is found in the regions of southern Westland, Fiordland and Southland in high-elevation habitats in herbfields, grasslands or rocky, sheltered habitats from 1200 to 2200 m above sea level.\n\n\n== Phylogeny ==\nAn individual of O. confertifolia was included in phylogenetic analyses of all species of the genus Ourisia using standard DNA sequencing markers (two nuclear ribosomal DNA markers and two chloroplast DNA regions) and morphological data. In all analyses, the sampled individual belonged to the highly supported New Zealand lineage, and in the nuclear ribosomal and combined datasets, it was strongly supported in a clade with two other southern South Island endemic species, Ourisia spathulata and O. glandulosa.\nIn another phylogenetic study using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), all four sampled individuals formed a highly supported clade that was in turn highly supported as being closely related to O. spathluata and O. glandulosa. The four sampled individuals of O. confertifolia also comprised one of the significant clusters in the Bayesian clustering analysis.\n\n\n== Conservation status ==\nOurisia confertifolia is listed as At Risk - Naturally Uncommon in the most recent assessment (2017–2018) of the New Zealand Threatened Classification for plants.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\tFlowers and fruiting plants of O. confertifolia\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Ourisia confertifolia at Wikimedia Commons\nOurisia confertifolia occurrence data from Australasian Virtual Herbarium",

        "content": "Santo Stefano or San Giovanni Battista e Santo Stefano is a mixed Romanesque-style, Roman Catholic rural parish church, located in the Piazza Don Renzo Gori in the frazione of Pieve, located south east of Camaiore in the province of Lucca, Tuscany, Italy.\n\n\n== History and description ==\n\nThis church is first documented in 817, as the Ecclesie S. Stefani in loco Campo Maiore. Tradition holds that this was one of the pieve erected in the sixth century by San Frediano, bishop of Lucca.  It was located near the via Francigena, and served as it main church in the until construction in 1255 of the church of Santa Maria Assunta in the center of town.\nOriginally it was consecrated only to St Stephen, in the ninth century the name of St. John the Baptist was added, since it acquired the privilege of having the baptismal font and the cemetery.\nThe layout is that of a Latin-cross and its façade is oriented to the west, while its semicircular apse to the east. The facade has a single portal added in 17th century. The rounded arch of a prior portal can still be seen. Above the portal is a statue of madonna and child, while in the upper register is a mullioned window. The stone bell-tower also has mullioned windows. A refurbishment of the church in 1938 restored the features as possible to the Romanesque origins. The mosaic floor consists of coloured marble geometric patterns. One item of note in the church is that an Ancient Roman sarcophagus (2nd or 3rd century) was reused to make the baptismal font. Bianco Bianchi (1464–1541), a chronicler from Camaiore, claimed that sarcophagi had originally contained the ashes of Lucio Imbricio, for whom Lombrici, where it was found, was subsequently named. The church also houses a fourteenth-century triptych by Battista from Pisa, depicting an Enthroned Madonna and Saints.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nBellato, Franco, Camaiore e dintorni, Comune di Camaiore, Camaiore, 1999\nDinelli, Pier Paolo, C’era una volta Campus Maior La storia raccontata dai ragazzi",

        "content": "In February 2024, the Australian Government announced a program to acquire eleven general purpose frigates for the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). These warships form part of a plan to expand the RAN and will, along with the larger Hunter-class frigates, replace its Anzac-class frigates. \nThe new general purpose frigates are intended to be 'Tier 2' vessels that are less expensive and capable than the Hunter-class frigates and Hobart-class destroyers. They will be used to escort other vessels, provide air defence and conduct attacks against surface targets. Four suitable designs were identified by an independent panel and the government intends to select a design in 2025 and commence construction of the ships in 2026. Three of the frigates are planned to be built overseas and the others will be built in Australia. \n\n\n== Planning ==\nThe 2023 Australian Defence Strategic Review raised concerns over the plans to acquire nine Hunter-class frigates for the Royal Australian Navy. The review also noted that other navies were tending to build larger numbers of smaller warships. In response, the Australian Government commissioned an independent review of the structure of the RAN's future surface fleet. The review panel was led by the retired United States Navy Vice Admiral William Hilarides and also included the retired Australian public servant Rosemary Huxtable and the retired Australian Vice Admiral Stuart Mayer.\n\nThe review and the government's response to it were released on 20 February 2024. Among a range of other recommendations, the panel called for the acquisition of \"at least seven, and optimally 11, Tier 2 ships, optimised for undersea warfare, to operate both independently and in conjunction with the Tier 1 ships to secure maritime trade routes, northern approaches and escort military assets\". They noted that the ships should be capable of operating a helicopter, be able to provide air defence \"through a limited number of point and self-defence systems\" and have the ability to attack targets on the land. Due to the deteriorating material condition of the Anzac-class frigates, the panel also recommended that the new ships be rapidly acquired.\nThe Australian Government accepted this recommendations, and announced as part of its response that eleven general purpose frigates would be built in order to \"address the risk presented by an ageing and increasingly fragile surface combatant fleet\". The government also agreed to reduce the number of Hunter-class frigates to be acquired from nine to six and to build six large optionally crewed surface vessels which will support the crewed warships. This will result in a fleet made up of nine 'Tier 1' warships (six Hunter-class frigates and three Hobart-class destroyers), with the general purpose frigates being among the navy's less capable 'Tier 2' warships.\nIn order to bring the general purpose frigates into service as quickly as possible, the government intends for the first three ships in the class to be built overseas, with the remainder being constructed at the Australian Marine Complex in Western Australia. Under the plans announced in February 2024, the government will select a design for the new frigates in 2025 and construction will begin in 2026. The first of the ships is planned to enter service by 2030. In April 2024 the government committed between $A7 billion and $A10 billion between the 2024–25 and 2033–34 financial years for the general purpose frigates, though at this stage the funding was unapproved.\n\n\n== Possible designs ==\nThe independent review identified four designs as \"combatant exemplars\" and recommended that they \"should form the basis of a deliberate selection process\". The government agreed to this. All four of these designs were under construction at the time for foreign navies. \nThe designs are the:\n\nSpanish ALFA3000\nSouth Korean Daegu class FFX Batch II or Batch III\nGerman MEKO A-200\nJapanese Mogami 30FFM\nBased on these designs, it is likely that the general purpose frigates will have a displacement of between 3,000 and 5,000 tonnes. This is similar to the Anzac class, which have a displacement of 3,600 tonnes, and much smaller than the Hunter class which will displace 10,000 tonnes. The frigates will have at least 16 vertically launched missile cells, twice as many as the Anzac class.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Commentary ==\nAustralian Financial Review journalist Andrew Tillet has written that the ALFA3000 and Mogami 30FFM designs best meet the government's requirements. He argues that this is because the two shipbuilders (Navantia and Mitsubishi respectively) have experience integrating the American Aegis Combat System and American missiles. Writing in the Asia-Pacific Defence Reporter, journalist Kym Bergmann argued that the panel had made a mistake by recommending both the Daegu class FFX Batch II and Batch III, as the two designs are quite different, and that the government was also mistaken in not identifying this error at the time it developed its response to the review. He argued that the Batch III is the only one of the two designs that meets the panel's specifications. Australian Strategic Policy Institute analyst Euan Graham suggested in February 2024 that New Zealand might join the frigate program in order to replace the Royal New Zealand Navy's pair of Anzac-class frigates.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFuture of the Royal Australian Navy\nAustralian light destroyer project\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Works consulted ===\nHilarides, William; Huxtable, Rosemary; Mayer, Stuart (2024).

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Red Jack Bird is a main fictional protagonist of Rovio's puzzle video games character Angry Birds and the computer animated film The Angry Birds Movie (2016). He is a desert cardinal where in the classic series, he currently lives on Piggy Island with some of his closest friends and takes care of the eggs. In the film series, he currently is a native to Bird Island, born as an orphan, was later accepted by the rest of the Birds and is currently praised as a hero. In the Summer Madness series, he seems to have parents.\n\n\n== Appearances ==\nRed is a cardinal with red feathers that cover most of his body, hence his name. In most of his game appearances, Red had a spherical body without showing any limbs at all, however, he has little stubby wings as seen in Egg's Day Out. He has a tuft of two red feathers on his head, and on his tail, there are three short black feathers with square ends. The feathers on his belly are peach-colored, and he has three small crimson spots ordered in a horizontal line across his face. In the Wreck the Halls short in late 2011, his design was slightly modified to make him more expressive. This design was not used very often until Angry Birds Toons in 2013, and has become the most common design since then.\nIn his appearances in the animated trailers by Kombo, his body is oval in shape, with three feathers on his head instead of two, visible feather texture on his sides, and three rounded black feathers similar to Stella Emily's.\nAfter the release of The Angry Birds Movie, he received an anthropomorphic, pill-shaped body with his head directly connected to his torso without a neck. His crest and tail feathers are also much longer and detailed than before. In addition, his irises were tinted brown. Future releases would occasionally switch between Red's new body and his old one.\nIn Angry Birds Dream Blast, Red was re-designed again to resemble a hatchling. In this game, he is much shorter, with a round body and small limbs. Angry Birds Journey uses a similar design for its trailers and promotional artwork, although it was somehow more simplified. In the levels of said game, he uses his design from Angry Birds Toons, though modified to have him with a small beak, large eyes, and brown irises.\n\n\n== Personality ==\nRed is extremely short-tempered. The angriest of all the birds, he is not above using violence when someone annoys him. He is someone who takes his duties very seriously, not willing at all to leave them aside. However, he also likes to discover new things when he is in a day off.\nDuring the events of the films, Red was an antisocial person who was rejected by the other birds. With an unstable anger (despite him trying to state otherwise), he had always hated being disrespected and made fun of, as he took jokes very seriously. This would result in him getting enraged and/or sad. As he grew up, he also became someone who could get frustrated by anything, acting rude in front of other people not matter how friendly they were towards him. However, after he stopped Leonard Mudbeard from cooking the eggs from Bird Island, Red became much more outgoing and was approved by the rest of the birds, which allowed him to control his anger issues much more than before. Nevertheless, even after these incidents, it was shown that Red could still get angry at anything, sometimes cursing himself for his actions, and showing an open hatred for ridiculous holidays.\nSince he moved to Piggy Island, Red has been very fond of the three eggs he sometime ago found there. As he believes that they will be very important for his species' survival, he takes good care of them and is not willing to leave them alone; once, he was shown spending entire seasons only looking after them. Whenever he is left alone with them, he softly strokes them and tells them bedtime stories, being one of the rare moments where he shows a soft side. Similarly, he spends hours in the morning cleaning and polishing his properties, specially the slingshot, and constantly checks that its band is perfectly elastic.However, he can easily lose his temper whenever something, such as an insect or a leaf,Carney, Ian; Boddy, Ashley (August 11, 2013). \"Egg's Day Out\". Angry Birds Toons. Season 1. Episode 22. touches either the eggs or the slingshot. He also returns to his usual serious self when others come in.\nEver since the first time he met them, Red has had a mutual dislike for the pigs, being skeptical about them during their stay on Bird Island. After he and his friends moved to Piggy Island, his hatred for them was just aggravated. As a result of all the times they tried to steal the eggs, Red has become even more determined to keep them safe, which has bordered him on schizophrenia when he is not near them; a notable example of this was shown when, while he was having a forced vacation, Red started to have hallucinations where he saw all surrounding objects as eggs. A similar case was when he saw everything round as pigs, though this was due to his rage after he defeated a group of them This also made him very paranoid, interpreting small things as a declaration of war, such as imagining the sound of the wind as a battle cry of the pigs. Despite his friends' best attempts of making him forget about them for a while, he never managed to take them out of his mind. He even is enraged by the smallest sight of green due to this.\nWhile serious and hostile, Red likes being with other people, and appreciates their company. He is afraid of losing his friends and being ignored by others, just like in his childhood and adolescence, though he keeps this fact a secret to everyone. It has been confirmed that Red never managed to get rid of this trauma; a notable example of this was when Chuck asked him if he feared something. While Red said that he was not scared of anything, he had some flashbacks of him being left alone by others. Another example was when his friends were preparing him a surprise party for his birthday. Unaware of this, Red thought that his friends had died during an incident, or that they had abandoned him. However, when he realized that they were completely fine, he was so happy to see them that he shedded a tear. Despite him sometimes treating his friends badly, Red respects and trusts them, and is not above leaving aside his duties to visit them, such as when he wanted to go to Rio de Janeiro to visit Blu and Jewel.\n\n\n== Powers and Abilities ==\nDespite not having undergone any notable training, Red is a very skilled and powerful fighter, having been able to break though Pig City on his own many times with no wounds or scratches. His strength is one of his most notable abilities; though most of the time he cannot break stones or wooden blocks, Red is strong enough to pick up and launch pigs with ease, nd has even been capable of breaking through many different walls and a metal wall within a few seconds with no additional equipment. In addition, his speed has let him run though entire mountains and onto water with no problem at all.\nRed has demonstrated to have a great durability and resistance against attacks. He has been able to survive massive explosions and falls from high heights, and even withstood atmospheric entry once.\nStrength and speed aside, in the movies, Red is able to hide all his limbs to turn himself into a ball akin to his classic design, though this ability has only been used once.\n\n\n=== Transformations ===\n\n\n==== Super Red ====\nBy passing though an extraterrestrial wormhole of some kind, Red can transform into Super Red.\nIn this state, Red has some different body features, the most notable of which is his black and white glasses, which he can use to track and analyze enemies. However, most of his abilities remain the same. This transformation first appeared in Angry Birds Space. If the screen is tapped, Super Red launches red soundwaves from both directions, aka, battle cries.\n\n\n==== Mighty Feathers ====\nBy using a few of the Mighty Eagle's feathers, Red can have a (so far), unnamed transformation. He looks the same as his normal counterpart, except that he is now surrounded by a few white and red feathers. In this state, Red can head himself towards any location he wants to. However, he can only use this ability once before losing the feathers. This transformation only appeared in the original Angry Birds Classic and it's Chinese version.\n\n\n==== Telebird ====\nThrough unknown means, Red can transform into the Telebird. In this state, he now wears a magenta and yellow helmet on his head. As the Telebird, Red now can teleport himself and surrounding objects to any place he wants to, allowing him to pass through solid objects. However, he can only use this ability once. This transformation only appeared in the international version of Angry Birds Seasons.\n\n\n==== Homing Bird ====\nBy unknown means, Red can transform into the Homing Bird, where he wears a gray radar on his head. In this state, Red automatically heads himself towards any pig that is near him. However, he can only use this ability once. This transformation only appeared in Angry Birds Seasons and its Chinese version.\n\n\n==== Pig ====\nWhen Chef Pig made a potion to transform the birds into pigs, so that they bring the Eggs to them. Red was used as the test subject and it was a success, as he gave the Eggs to Chef Pig and was about to cook them. However, this potion was temporary as he was turning back into a bird.  Chef Pig tried to make a new potion to make him a pig again, but Red blew the gas to him, which transformed him into a snail/tree/toy train/flower hybrid.\nWhen he was transformed into a pig, he appeared to look like a Minion Pig but with Red's signature eyebrows.\n\n\n==== Optimus Prime ====\nWhen the EggSpark hit Piggy Island, Red transformed into Optimus Prime, the leader of the Autobirds. He can shoot lasers towards Minion Pigs and hit structures. This transformation only appeared in Angry Birds Transformers.\n\n\n=== Weaknesses ===\nWhile not having any physical weaknesses, it is confirmed that Red is allergic to pollen. In addition, he can be scared quite easily by a scarecrow, and will be unable to do anything whenever he finds one.  He can also be distracted whenever he is trying to aim with the slingshot, being scared by almost any sound, including his own farts.\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nThis article incorporates material derived from the \"Red\" article on the Angry Birds at Fandom (formerly Wikia) and is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike License ().\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"So High School\" is a song by the American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift from the double album edition of her eleventh studio album, The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology (2024). Written and produced by Swift and Aaron Dessner, \"So High School\" has a 1990s-tinged production incorporating various rock styles like alternative rock, indie rock, and pop rock. The lyrics are about how a romantic relationship makes Swift relive the feeling of young love. Some critics praised the nostalgia-inducing production, but some others found the lyrical content lightweight.\n\n\n== Background ==\nSwift revealed The Tortured Poets Department at the Grammy Awards on February 4, 2024, while accepting the award for Best Pop Vocal Album for Midnights (2022). The album's physical edition would include \"The Manuscript\" as a bonus track. Subsequent editions with bonus tracks \"The Bolter,\" \"The Albatross,\" and \"The Black Dog\" were revealed during her Eras Tour shows in Melbourne, Sydney and Singapore, respectively. Two hours after the release of The Tortured Poets Department at midnight Eastern Time on April 19, Swift surprise-released The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology; the second volume of the double album. The Anthology added fifteen songs to the album, in addition to the songs on the first volume. \"So High School\" is the twenty-second track from the album.\n\n\n== Music and lyrics ==\n\"So High School\" is a song that combines 1990s musical styles such as alternative rock, indie rock, pop rock, and power pop, with touches of dream pop. The lively and melodic guitar instrumental is reminiscent of \"Hits Different\" from Midnights (2022). The lyrics of \"So High School\" revolves around careless teenage romance. Swift sings about youth experiences in the lines: \"I'm watching American Pie with you on a Saturday night\", \"Truth, dare, spin bottles\" and \"Touch me while your bros play Grand Theft Auto\". In the lyrics, she compares the public image of her love interest and herself to the feeling of young love and popularity encapsulated in high school romances.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nBryanna Cappadona of Today wrote that the song takes audiences \"back to feeling like you’re 16 again.\" Similarly, Bustle's Jake Viswanath said: \"ode to a new romance that will take you back to your youth.\" Reviewing the album as a whole, Mary Kate Carr of The A.V. Club said The Anthology feels repetitive or derivative due to its lack of new musical ideas making its songs indistinguishable from each other. \"So High School\" is a \"fun, poppy number that disrupts the whispery melancholy\"; such \"energy and freshness\" needed in the 31-track album to prevent it from becoming monotonous.\nWriting for Mashable, Elena Cavender found the track hilarious, attributing to its lyrical references, and said the line \"You know how to ball, I know Aristotle\" is a \"perfect depiction\" of her relationship with Kelce. In Billboard's ranking of all 31 tracks, \"So High School\" was placed seventh, with Jason Lipshutz writing: \"obvious back-half highlight, simply by flexing a little muscle amidst the nostalgia trip.\" Mark Richardson of The Wall Street Journal called it a highlight off of the album in his generally negative review, \"evoking bands like The Primitives and The Sundays, and it serves as a temporary respite from the word-drunk confessionals that dominate the record.\" Craig Jenkins shared a similar sentiment, \"Swift greets the ’90s alt-rock airs of 'So High School' with the gorgeous reediness of a Sheryl Crow or Aimee Mann.\"\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nTaylor Swift – lead vocals, songwriter, producer\nAaron Dessner – producer, songwriter, bass guitar, synth bass, drum programming, electric guitar, keyboards, percussion, piano, synthesizer\nSerban Ghenea – mixing\nBryce Bordone – mix engineer\nJonathan Low – recording engineer\nBella Blasko – additional engineer\nJames McAlister – drums, drum programming, recording, electric guitar, synthesizer\nBenjamin Lanz – synthesizer, sequencer, trombone\nRandy Merrill – mastering\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

His design of the Brady house, the Dilling Street house that was used for exterior shots in The Brady Brunch is among his most recognized works.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nLondelius married Jean Frances Burford on June 7, 1941, and they had one daughter. He spent his later years in Pasadena and San Juan Capistrano, California.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nLondelius passed away in 1999 in Orange, California, and was buried in Riverside, California.

        "content": "There are various intersections of cannabis and the restaurant industry.\n\n\n== Cannabis culture ==\n\n\n=== Cannabis-themed restaurants ===\nAmong cannabis-themed restaurants is the fast food chain Cheba Hut, which is named after the 1980s song about marijuana \"Cheeba Cheeba\". The Joint opened in Sanford, Florida, in 2023.\n\n\n=== Marketing and April 20 (\"420\") promotions ===\nSome restaurant chains have \"nodded\" to cannabis consumers on social media, including Chipotle Mexican Grill and Denny's. Notable chains that have offered specials on April 20, a date with significance in cannabis culture (\"420\"), include:\n\nIn New Mexico, a McDonald's franchise placed a billboard with the text, \"Usually, when you roll something this good, it's illegal!\" The parent company removed the ad and said in a statement, \"this local franchise's billboard does not meet our standards\".\n\n\n== On-site consumption ==\n\nCoffeeshops are establishments in the Netherlands where the sale of cannabis for personal consumption by the public is tolerated by the local authorities.\nIn Portland, Oregon, the World Famous Cannabis Cafe operated between 2009 and 2016.\n\n\n=== Cannabis-infused menu offerings ===\nIn 2023, CBD CBN began serving infused food and drinks in Edmonton, Alberta.\n\n\n==== United States ====\nIn 2018, USA Today said more restaurants in the U.S. were offering menus with cannabidiol (CBD)-infused options. The trade publication Nation's Restaurant News said, \"A few chefs in the 10 states, and the District of Columbia ... have thrown pot-laced dinners. Those meals are generally held offsite, and the edible marijuana products are provided by staff from licensed dispensaries, and guests have to add it themselves\". The same publication said in 2019, \"Restaurants are taking their relationship with hemp to the next level by adding CBD or cannabinoids to dishes.\"\nThe Original Cannabis Café, established as Lowell Cafe in West Hollywood, California in late 2019, was the \"first restaurant to legally sell pot for on-site consumption\" in the United States. Fried, a fast casual restaurant in St. Louis with CBD-infused sauces, opened in 2019. In 2022, Nashville's first cannabis restaurant began offering \"legal, hemp-derived THC-infused condiments, desserts and mocktails\", and the opening of Wild Montrose marked Houston's \"first entirely legal cannabis-infused dining experience\".\nIn 2023, the American cannabis magazine High Times said, \"there's a niche in the edibles industry that's continuing to grow: cannabis dining events. While there are still many limitations to cannabis infused dining, such as restrictive laws about public consumption or a lack of approved consumption lounges, many successful chef-led dining experiences are putting spotlight both on cannabis as an ingredient, as well as the consumer enjoying unique dishes infused with the herb.\" In 2023, Hi Flora! opened as Minnesota's first THC restaurant, and the San Antonio soul food restaurant MxiCanna Cafe gives patrons the option of adding drops of delta-8. In Houston, Ninfa's debuted a cannabis-infused margarita on April 20, 2024.\n\n\n== Industry impact ==\nIn 2014, Nation's Restaurant News said, \"pot tourism is inevitable, and the marketing possibilities are substantial for restaurants targeting visitors with the munchies\".\nIn 2018, The Denver Post said higher wages in the cannabis industry were \"eating into restaurant hiring pool\". In Maine, restaurants were reportedly losing workers to the cannabis industry in 2019.\n\n\n== Legal status ==\nIn 2023, Montgomery County health officials warned restaurants in Maryland not to sell cannabis-infused drinks or food, and Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill to legalize Amsterdam-style cannabis cafes in California.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCannabis edible\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nLyons, Billy (June 15, 2019). \"How to Eat, Drink, and Appreciate Cannabis at Restaurants\".

In 1898, the Romanians were transferred to the Pontifical Urban College for the Propagation of the Faith. In 1930, Pius XI began to lay the foundations for a college of their own, which was finally inaugurated on 9 March 1937.\nThe patron saint of the college is John of Damascus.\nThe college's first rector was Angelo Dell'Acqua, and other past rectors include Vasile Cristea, later Romanian bishop in exile, the Benedictine monk Olivier Raquez (1994–2004), and Claudiu-Lucian Pop (2007–2011).\n\nThe college was visited on 15 May 2015 by President Klaus Iohannis and on 12 May 2018 by Viorica Dăncilă, head of the Romanian government.\nIn May 2022, Pope Francis held an audience with members of the college to mark the eighty-fifth anniversary of its founding.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nAddress to the College by Pope Francis, May 2017",

        "content": "Johann Harper (August 1688, Stockholm - 4 December 1746, Potsdam) was a Swedish painter who worked at the Prussian Royal Court.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHe was the son of Jakob Harper, a merchant, and his wife Anna née Pohl. His first painting lessons came from Peter Martin van Mytens and David von Krafft in Stockholm. Then he studied with the court painter Benoît Le Coffre in Copenhagen. \nIn 1709, together with Ismael Mengs, eft Copenhagen for a trip to Germany, where he studied with Paul Heinecken in the Hanseatic City of Lübeck. After completing his studies, he became a popular miniature and enamel painter.\nFrom 1712, he worked in Berlin. In 1716, he was appointed court painter for the Hohenzollerns. There, he created portraits and decorations at Charlottenburg Palace. In the 1740s, he created the ceiling painting, \"'Flora and her Followers\" for the vestibule at the new Sanssouci palace in Potsdam, which underwent a restoration in 2016.\nHis first marriage was to Maria Barbara Wolffgang, the daughter of J. G. Wolffgang, a copper engraver. Their eldest son, Adolf Friedrich Harper, learned miniature and flower painting at home. Later, he became a landscape painter in Stuttgart. \nHis best known student was the portrait painter and etcher, Joachim Martin Falbe. Several of his works may be seen at the Nationalmuseum, Stockholm.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nKarl Heinrich Heinecken: Nachrichten von Künstlern und Kunst-Sachen.

        "content": "France and the League of Nations was a major theme of French foreign policy in the 1920s and 1930s. France and the United Kingdom were the two dominant players in world affairs and in League affairs, and usually were in agreement. The League proved ineffective in resolving major problems. In 1945 it was replaced with the United Nations, where France played a major role despite its much weaker status. However in the 1920s and 1930s the main themes of French foreign policy focused on defense against Germany, and took place outside of League jurisdiction.\nFrance played a significant role in the League of Nations, though its influence and commitment to the organization was complex. France was one of the founding members of the League of Nations and was represented on the League's Council as a permanent member.  As a major Allied power in World War I, France was instrumental in the creation of the League and the drafting of its Covenant. \nHowever, France's relationship with the League was often strained. While six members of the British Empire belonged to the League, Paris did not permit any of its colonies to join. France was wholly consumed with European affairs, and in its League work it largely ignored the affairs of Asia or Africa.  France in the 1920s supported the League's mission of collective security and disarmament and supported all the major decisions.\nHowever in the 1930s it  became disillusioned as the League failed to prevent the aggressions of Japan, Hitler's Germany and Mussolini's Italy .  France's leaders   prioritized appeasement of these aggressors over upholding the League's principles, contributing to the organization's decline.\n\n\n== 1920s and 1930s ==\nFrench foreign and security policy after 1919 used traditional alliance strategies to weaken German's potential to threaten France and comply with the strict obligations devised by France in the Treaty of Versailles. The main diplomatic strategy came in response to the demands of the French army to form alliances against the German threat.  Germany resisted then finally complied, aided by American money, and France took a more conciliatory policy by 1924 in response to pressure from Britain and the United States, as well as to French realization that its potential allies in Eastern Europe were weak and hard to coordinate.  It proved impossible to establish military alliances with the United States or Britain. A tentative Russian agreement in 1935 was politically suspect and was not implemented. The alliances with Poland and Czechoslovakia; these proved to be weak ties that collapsed in the face of German threats in 1938 in 1939.\n\n\n=== 1920s ===\nFrom 1925 until his death in 1932, Aristide Briand, as prime minister during five short intervals, directed French foreign policy, using his diplomatic skills and sense of timing to forge friendly relations with Weimar Germany as the basis of a genuine peace within the framework of the League of Nations. He realized France could neither contain the much larger Germany by itself nor secure effective support from Britain or the League.\nFrance avoided the League in its violent controversy with Germany over the payment of reparations demanded by the Treaty of France.  Instead the United States took the lead in resolving the bitter tension, with the Dawes Plan in 1924. It was an international effort chaired by the American banker Charles G. Dawes. It set up a staggered schedule for Germany's payment of war reparations, provided for a large loan to stabilize the German currency and ended French  occupation of the Ruhr distruct of Germany.  Germany was then able to meet its reparations payments under the new schedule.\nThe League helped arrange the Locarno Treaties of 1925 helped bring Germany back into the French good graces.  It guaranteed the border between France and Germany, but ignored Germany's controversial eastern border.  In Poland, the public humiliation received by Polish diplomats was one of the contributing factors to the fall of the Grabski cabinet. Locarno contributed to the worsening of the atmosphere between Poland and France, weakening the French-Polish alliance. Józef Beck ridiculed the treaties saying, \"Germany was officially asked to attack the east, in return for peace in the west.\" \nIn the 1920s, France built the Maginot Line, an elaborate system of static border defences, designed to fight off any German attack. The Maginot Line did not extend into Belgium, where Germany attacked in 1940 and went around the French defenses.  Military alliances were signed with weak powers in 1920–21, called the \"Little Entente\".\n\n\n=== 1930s ===\n\nBritish historian Richard Overy explains how the country that had dominated Europe for three centuries wanted one last extension of power, but failed in its resolve:\n\nIn the 1930s France became a deeply conservative,  defensive society, split by social conflict, undermined by failing and un-modernized economy and an empire in crisis. All these things explain the loss of will and direction in the 1930s.\nThe foreign policy of right-wing Pierre Laval (prime minister and foreign minister 1934–1936) was based on a deep distrust of Nazi Germany. He sought anti-German alliances.  He and Mussolini signed the Franco-Italian Agreement in January 1935.  The agreement ceded parts of French Somaliland to Italy and allowed her a free hand in Abyssinia, in exchange for support against any German aggression. In April 1935, Laval persuaded Italy and Great Britain to join France in the Stresa Front against German ambitions in Austria.  On 2 May 1935, he likewise signed the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance, but it was not implemented by Laval nor by his left-wing successors.\nAppeasement was increasingly adopted as Germany grew stronger, for France was increasingly weakened by a stagnant economy, unrest in its colonies, and bitter internal political fighting.  Appeasement was the fall-back position when it was impossible to make a major decision.  Martin Thomas says it was not a coherent diplomatic strategy nor a copying of the British.   When Hitler in 1936 sent troops into the Rhineland—the part of Germany where no troops were allowed—neither Paris nor London would risk war, and nothing was done. France also appeased Italy on the Ethiopia question because it could not afford to risk an alliance between Italy and Germany.\nHitler's remilitarization of the Rhineland changed the balance of power decisively in favor of the Reich. French credibility in standing against German expansion or aggression was left in doubt. French military strategy was entirely defensive, and it had no intention whatever of invading Germany if war broke out. Instead it planned  to defend the Maginot Line. Its failure to send even a single unit into Rhineland signaled that strategy to all of Europe. Potential allies in Eastern Europe could no longer trust in an alliance with a France that could not be trusted to deter Germany through threat of an invasion. Without such deterrence, the ally was militarily helpless.  Belgium dropped its defensive alliance with France and relied on neutrality. Paris neglected to expand the Maginot line to cover the Belgian border, which is where Germany invaded in 1940.  Mussolini had previously pushed back against German expansion, now he realized cooperation with France was unpromising, so he began instead to swing in favor of Berlin. All of France's friends were disappointed – even the Pope told the French ambassador that, \"Had you ordered the immediate advance of 200,000 men into the zone the Germans had occupied, you would have done everyone a very great favor.\"\nAppeasement in union with Britain now became the main policy after 1936, as France sought peace in the face of Hitler's escalating demands.    Édouard Daladier, prime minister 1938–40, refused to go to war against Germany and Italy without British support. He endorsed Neville Chamberlain who wanted to save peace using the Munich Agreement in 1938.  France's military alliance with Czechoslovakia was sacrificed at Hitler's demand when France and Britain agreed to his terms at Munich in 1938.\nThe left-wing Léon Blum government in 1936–37 joined the right-wing Britain government in establishing an arms embargo during the Spanish Civil War (1936–39). Blum rejected support for the Spanish Republicans because of his fear that civil war might spread to deeply divided France.  As the Republican cause faltered in Spain, Blum secretly supplied the Republican cause with warplanes, money and sanctuaries.  The government nationalized arms suppliers, and dramatically increased its program of rearming the French military in a last-minute catch up with the Germans.  It also tried to build up the weak Polish army.\nFrench foreign policy in the 1920s and 1930s aimed to build military alliances with small nations in Eastern Europe in order to counter the threat of German attacks.  Paris saw Romania as an ideal partner in this venture, especially in  1926 to 1939. During World War II the alliance failed. Romania was first neutral and then after Germany defeated France in 1940 it aligned with Germany. The main device France had used was arms sales in order to strengthen Romania and ensure its goodwill. French military promises were vague and not trusted after the sellout of Czechoslovakia at Munich in 1938. By 1938 France needed all the arms it could produce. Meanwhile, Germany was better poised to build strong economic ties.  In 1938-39 France made a final effort to guarantee Romanian borders because it calculated that Germany needed Romanian oil, but Romania decided war with Germany would be hopeless and so it veered toward Berlin.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFrance and the United Nations\nHistory of French foreign relations\nInternational relations (1919–1939)\nUnited Kingdom and the League of Nations\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nAdamthwaite, Anthony P.

Rangers, formed only a year earlier, were making their first appearance in the top tier. It was decided that the SWPL would change from a winter to a summer schedule, so the 2009 season was a transitional, shortened campaign with only one round of fixtures, it was determined that no promotion or relegation would take place, although a championship title was still awarded. Matches were played between August and November.\nGlasgow City won the championship with a perfect record (11 victories, 0 draw, 0 defeats) and qualified for the 2010–11 UEFA Women's Champions League. It was their third consecutive title, and fourth overall. No teams were relegated.\n\n\n== League standings ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nResults at Spartans FC Women\nWomen's League Competitions at Scottish Football Historical Archive",

When he returned to Malmö after his studies, his interest in making music would intensify thanks to the encouragement of his old schoolmates. A move to Barcelona and the end of a relationship, resulted in extended sessions and lots of watching of the classic American sitcom Seinfeld. Jakobsson took his stage name from that TV show, which had been as a temporary side project of the same name, but fully adopted 2016 when he released his first recording.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nIn his music, DJ Seinfeld uses sounds from movies or series, borrowings from acid house and deep house, as well as distortion effects.

Iraqi crime groups are active worldwide, especially in Iraq, Europe, and the Middle East.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Iraqi mafia are especially active in trafficking drugs, arms, humans, and oil, and also does illegal taxation, smuggling, extortion, robbery, and assassinations. The Iraqi mafia often operates based on Arab tribal structures. There have been instances of armed groups working with the Iraqi mafia.\nThe Iraqi mafia is known for human trafficking, including a type in which they make people pose as beggars in the streets and give all their earnings back to the mafia.\nThe Iraqi mafia also includes women, who were described as \"more crafty, skilful and require double police effort to arrest them.\"\nThe Iraqi diaspora is also active in organised crime which is linked to Iraq.\nThe Popular Mobilization Forces, in 2019, carried out \"the largest campaign in the history of Iraq\", raiding many casinos, drug rings, and prostitution clubs, and arresting the \"grand mafia leader.\"\nIn 2024, an Iraqi mafia leader in Baghdad was killed by an Albanian mafia operative who travelled from Sweden to commit the murder, and tried to flee Iraq before being arrested by Iraqi police and given the death penalty.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2010 Scottish Women's Premier League was the ninth season of the Scottish Women's Premier League, the top level of women's football in Scotland. 12 teams contested the championship. It was played as a double round-robin within the 2010 calendar year (matches were played between March and November), following a format change in 2009. As that 2009 season was a transitional, shortened campaign with only one round of fixtures, it was determined that no promotion or relegation would take place, although a championship title was still awarded, and the participants in 2010 were unchanged.\nGlasgow City won the championship with a near-perfect record (21 victories 1 draw, 0 defeats) and qualified for the 2011–12 UEFA Women's Champions League. It was their fourth consecutive title, and fifth overall. The bottom-ranked team, Aberdeen, was relegated to the Scottish Women's Football League First Division.\n\n\n== League standings ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nResults at Spartans FC Women\nWomen's League Competitions at Scottish Football Historical Archive",

It is hosted by political comedian and broadcaster Matt Chorley, with analysis from (Lord) Peter Mandelson, of the Labour Party, (Lord) Daniel Finkelstein, of the Conservative Party, and Polly Mackenzie, formerly of the Liberal Democrats and the Women's Equality parties. It is released on Tuesdays, and partially broadcast on Times Radio, within Chorley's daily Politics without the boring bits morning politics news analysis show. It was listed by The Week as one of the best political podcasts, and later one of the best podcasts overall of 2023.\nIn December 2023, Mandelson when discussing political donations said that the Labour administration had taken a £1 million donation from an animal rights group and later banned fox hunting. In March 2024, Mandelson was criticised for, when commenting in the show on how appearance mattered in politics, giving the comment that Keir Starmer \"needs to shed a few pounds\".\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe podcast's homepage\nThe podcast's playlist on YouTube\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "All That She Wants (stylized as All That She Wants: The Unbelievable Story of Ace of Base) is a limited-run documentary television series produced by Viaplay, and directed by Jens von Reis. The series explores the meteoritic rise of Swedish pop group Ace of Base; the highs and the lows, and where they are today. Former lead singer, Linn Berggren, breaks her silence in the form of a letter after 20 years in seclusion away from the public eye. Interviewees  include American record producer Clive Davis and Haitian rapper and musician Wyclef Jean. The series premiered in Australia on SBS On Demand 3 April 2024, in Greece on Vodafone Greece 30 April 2024, and on Viaplay, 1 May 2024, in all other territories.\n\n\n== Background and development ==\n\nThe Swedish quartet, Ace of Base, made up of siblings Jonas, Jenny, and Linn Berggren, along with their friend Ulf Ekberg, took the world by storm in late 1992 with their record-breaking debut album Happy Nation. With success came immense pressure to continue delivering hits and sales similar to that of their groundbreaking debut. By 1996, the stress brought the Gothenburg natives close to the breaking point. They would release three follow-up albums before taking a long hiatus in the early 2000s. The stress would eventually became to much for bandmember Linn Berggren to handle. She officially left the band in 2005, but not before taking a backseat as lead singer starting with the group's third album Flowers (1998) leading to much speculation about the star's personal life. In 2007, Ace of Base reunited as a trio to perform their first full-length concert since 1996 in Yekaterinburg, Russia. They embarked on a world tour entitled Ace of Base - Redefined!, which continued throughout 2008 and 2009. The set list included several new versions of their greatest hits. By 2010, Jenny Berggren set her sights on a solo career with Jonas and Ulf deciding to recruit two new female vocalists and continue as Ace of Base. This led to a rift between Jenny and her former bandmates. Beginning in 2011, Jonas Berggren, through the group's official Facebook account, and the website ReverbNation, began releasing previously unreleased material on a semi-regular basis; this was referred to as \"Ace Thursdays\". This would inspire an album made up of remastered unreleased material and b-sides, Hidden Gems (2015). In 2020, the band began to celebrate the band's 30th anniversary with a series of anniversary releases. A documentary went into production in 2022. Jenny Berggren continues to perform as Jenny of Ace of Base around the world performing the group's greatest hits. She released her memoir, Vinna hela Världen in 2009. Jonas Berggren continues to write music, while Ulf has moved into the world of technology. Much of the never-before-seen footage featured in the documentary comes from the latter's personal archives.\n\n\n== Episodes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAll That She Wants: The Unbelievable Story of Ace of Base on Viaplay\nAll That She Wants at IMDb",

By-elections were held on 5 seats of National Assembly, 12 seats of Punjab Assembly, two seats of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly and two seats of Balochistan Assembly.\n\n\n== Security measures ==\nThe federal government approved the deployment of Pakistan Army and Civil Armed Forces personnel during the by-elections. These forces functioned as a quick response force, deployed as a second and third tier behind the police. The exact number of troops and their deployment areas were determined by the ECP in consultation with all relevant stakeholders.\nAbout 13,800 police personnel were deployed to guard 921 polling stations. The ECP mandates security personnel, excluding the armed forces deployed in by-elections, to maintain impartiality, assist officers, ensure peace, avoid clashes, arrests or interference, report irregularities and, in particular, conduct counting. Instructed to maintain neutrality during the process.\n\n\n== Communication suspension ==\nThe Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) has announced that cellular service will be temporarily suspended in certain districts of Punjab and Balochistan on April 21 and 22 during the by-elections. The move was directed by the Ministry of Interior and aimed at ensuring the integrity and security of the electoral process.\n\n\n== Candidates ==\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n=== National Assembly ===\n\n\n=== Punjab Assembly ===\n\n\n=== Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly ===\n\n\n=== Balochistan Assembly ===\n\n\n=== Result by Constituency (National Assembly) ===\n\n\n=== Khyber Pakhtunkhwa ===\n\n\n==== NA-8 Bajaur ====\nThe general elections for Bajaur NA-8 had been postponed because of the murder of a candidate,Rehan Zeb Khan.\n\n\n==== NA-44 Dera Ismail Khan-I ====\nNA-44 Dera Ismail Khan, the constituency was vacated by Ali Amin Gandapur, who retained his provisional assembly seat to become KP’s chief minister.\n\n\n=== Punjab ===\n\n\n==== NA-119 Lahore-III ====\nLahore’s NA-119 was vacated by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, who preferred to become an MPA from PP-159\n\n\n==== NA-132 Kasur-II ====\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif won polls for two NA .

        "content": "The Badia San Pietro (Abbey of St Peter) was a former Benedictine monastery just northwest of the center of the town of Camaiore in the province of Lucca, Tuscany, Italy. the main remnant of the former monastery is the Romanesque-style, Roman Catholic parish church located on Via Badia #15.\n\n\n== History and description ==\nA monastery of this name in Camaiore is first documented in 761. The monastery grew in prominence due to its location along the pilgrimage route of the Via Francigena. In a bull from 1180, Pope Alexander III granted the monastery special privileges in the region, including jurisdiction ober the churches of San Michele in Camaiore, San Biagio in Lombrici and San Frediano in Pedona. The abbott was given the privilege to wear both a mitre and croiser, identifying his position as that of a bishop. In 1217 the Cistercian order of the Florians took control of the monastery. Over the next few centuries the fortunes of the monastery would ebb. A fire destroyed most of the frescoes in the church. The monastery fell under control of different orders until in 1527 it was suppressed by Pope Clement VII, and the property granted to the Ospedale di San Luca in Lucca.\nNearly all the monastic quarters were destroyed, part of the refectory remains, the church of San Pietro and a portal, once the entrance to the monastery with a statue of St Peter above.\nBetween 1856 and 1859 the architect Giuseppe Pardini restrored the structures, including the church and bell-tower. The latter was nearly entirely rebuilt. Some of the artworks from the Badia can now be seen at either the Museum of Sacred Art or the Archeological Museum in Camaiore.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nBellato, Franco, Camaiore e dintorni, ed.

        "content": "John B. Holway (born 1929) is a renowned figure in the field of baseball research, whose extensive contributions have spanned over several decades. With a career dating back to 1944, Holway has become a notable authority on various aspects of baseball history, particularly focusing on the Negro Leagues and international baseball.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHolway's interest in baseball began at an early age, leading him to embark on a lifelong journey of research and writing within the realm of the sport. After witnessing his first Negro League game in 1945 between Satchel Paige's Monarchs and Josh Gibson's Grays in Washington, DC, Holway's passion for baseball history was ignited.\n\n\n== Contributions to Baseball Research ==\nIn 1954, Holway wrote his first book, \"Japan Is Big League in Thrills,\" marking the first English-language publication on Japanese baseball. This was followed by \"Sumo\" in 1955, the first English book on the subject of sumo wrestling.\nThroughout his career, Holway has published numerous significant works on the Negro Leagues, including \"Voices from the Great Black Baseball Leagues\" (1975), a groundbreaking collection of interviews with legendary players such as Cool Papa Bell, Buck Leonard, and Willie Wells. He has also authored comprehensive books on individual players such as Josh Gibson, as well as broader topics like \"The Complete Book of the Negro Leagues\" (2001), considered one of the most ambitious projects in Negro League research.\nIn addition to his writings on baseball, Holway has delved into other areas of interest, such as his oral history of the Tuskegee Airmen, titled \"Red Tails, Black Wings.\"\n\n\n== Work and recognition ==\nHolway's dedication to baseball research has earned him widespread recognition, including the Bob Davids Award and the Casey Award for \"Blackball Stars,\" which was voted the best baseball book of 1988. He has served as the chairman of the Negro Leagues committee for the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR) and has contributed extensively to various publications, including The New York Times, Sports Illustrated, and Baseball Weekly.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThroughout his career, John B. Holway has played a pivotal role in preserving and promoting the history of baseball, particularly the often-overlooked contributions of players from the Negro Leagues. His meticulous research and dedication to uncovering hidden stories and debunking myths have enriched the understanding of baseball history for generations to come.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nOutside of his baseball research endeavors, Holway has worked as an economics analyst for the Voice of America and has covered international conferences around the world. He has also made appearances on television networks such as CNN, ABC-TV, and the History Channel.\n\n\n== Published works ==\n\"Japan Is Big League in Thrills\" (1954)\n\"Sumo\" (1955)\n\"Voices from the Great Black Baseball Leagues\" (1975)\n\"The Complete Book of the Negro Leagues\" (2001)\n\"Red Tails, Black Wings\" (oral history of the Tuskegee Airmen)\n\"The Last 400 Hitter\" (1991)\n\"The Baseball Astrologer and Other Weird Tales\" (1999)\n\"TED, the Kid\" (2006)\n\"Bessie Coleman Pioneering Black Aviator\" (2012)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Savoy Theatre is a historic Victorian-Style theatre, established in 1901, with the present theatre building dating from 1927, operating as an arts and culture centre in Glace Bay, Cape Breton Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia, Canada. It's main auditorium has a capacity of 761 including the balcony. The Savoy's foyer also hosts events (dinner theatres, weddings, reunions) for up to 100 people.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== The first Savoy Theatre ===\nThe original Savoy Theatre was built on Union Street in Glace Bay in 1901 by businessman John Connors as a vaudeville house.   It was at first an \"upstairs' theatre, on the second floor of an office building, and remained so until 1920 when it was remodeled and brought down to ground level.  It had an orchestra pit, balcony, and ornate domed ceiling. The large stage could easily accommodate a 24-foot boxing ring with ringside bleachers. Vaudeville was staged there, along with magic shows, musicals, concerts, both sacred and secular, political meetings, and rallies.\n\n\n=== 1927 fire and the new Savoy Theatre ===\nOn 27 March of 1927, the old Savoy was destroyed by fire which levelled an entire block of buildings as firemen were unable to contain the blaze to the theatre. \nJohn Connors quickly rebuilt its replacement.  The new Savoy Theatre, constructed to the specifications of the famed Victorian show houses with seating for 1,200 patrons, opened its doors on 11 November 1927, less that eight months after the fire that destroyed its predecessor. Built by MacSween Contractors, the new theatre was complete with elaborate decoration including rococo chandeliers.  The stage was equipped with a \"hemp\" fly system, (a.k.a. rope line common to the period), contained in the fly loft above the stage, as well as a fire curtain.\nFor the next few decades the Savoy operated both as a movie theatre and as a vaudeville house, and hosted many of the world's finest entertainers, including W.C. Fields, and a young Sammy Davis Jr. (in 1937 at the age of 12). The Savoy was also the preferred location for boxing matches, and other large-scale spectacles.\n\n\n=== Famous Players ownership ===\nIn the mid-1950s, owners John Connors, and later his wife, contracted with Famous Players Canadian Corporation to operate the Savoy as a Famous Players Movie Theatre. Sometime after that Famous Players assumed ownership and complete control of the venue and operated it exclusively as a movie theatre.\n\n\n=== 1974 purchase by the Town of Glace Bay and restoration ===\nIn 1974 the Town of Glace Bay purchased the theatre from Famous Players with the intention of restoring it for use by the community.  Both Federal and Provincial funding was secured, allowing the Town to begin a renovation program to restore the Savoy under the guidance of Mandel Sprachman, the Toronto architect who restored the city’s legendary Elgin and Winter Garden Theatres to their original splendour. \nThe renovations followed along the lines of the original building and no major changes were made to the superstructure. The ornate rococo chandeliers were retained and refurbished, and new sound and projection equipment was installed.  The stage equipment, including hemp line sets, Dressing-rooms and other facilities were updated.\n\nThe restored Savoy, now seating 875, was officially opened by Mayor Dan A Munroe and the Glace Bay Town Council on 17 May 1976, with Lieutenant-Governor Clarence Gosse, Premier Gerald Regan, and leader of the Opposition John Buchanan of Nova Scotia in attendance.\nA large contingent of patrons travelled from Sydney via the Devco steam railway with No. 42 arriving at the Glace Bay Station shortly after 7 p.m.  This group was escorted from the station to Union Street by the MacDougall Girl's Pipe Band.  Ann Terry provided live radio coverage of the event while the Donkin Band provided music in front of the theatre prior to show time. One special guest was CBC Newscaster Lloyd Robertson. The Glace Bay and Sydney Rotary clubs combined to mount a ten-day performance the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical The King and I, directed by Don Gillies, which at the time broke all box office records in the province.\n\n\n=== 1991 fire and 1993 reopening ===\nThe Savoy Theatre sustained damage as a result of a fire on Sunday, 2 June, 1991. The fire appeared to have originated in the wiring in or around a Floor Pocket (a receptacle set into the stage floor).  The fire ran under the stage floor to the rear wall of the stage house where it shot up the 60 feet toward the roof. The fire was reported by a passing taxi driver around 5:00 am that morning and firemen were able to extinguish the fire before the building was lost.  Most of the fire damage was contained to the dressing rooms located below the stage, the back wall, and a portable trailer located at the rear of the stage house.  The damage was extensive and costly.  There was smoke and water damage to other areas of the theatre but the structure remained sound.\nMandel Sprachman, the architect who oversaw the 1974 renovations, was flown in from the United States for an initial assessment of the damage. \nIn addition to the repairs required from the fire, the Savoy Theatre had additional upgrades completed at this time, including the addition of a Backstage Shop, Production Offices, and Green Room at the rear of the Stage House, upgrades to the dressing rooms, a restored and reopened Orchestra Pit, and replacement of both the sound and lighting systems. The balcony floor was further raised in tiers to improve sight lines.  Pembroke Construction was hired to carry out the restoration work which cost $1.3 million dollars.\nOn completion of the work a Grand Re-Opening was held as a 3-day celebration, and ran from 7 to 9 May 1993.\n\n\n=== 1997–1998 expansion ===\nA further 2.3 million capital expansion project in 1997 saw the addition of a 50' x 60' two story glassed annex with a portable stage for small events, seating up to 150.  The new addition moved the theater entrance to the corner of Union and Commercial Streets and included a new box office, a commercial kitchen, a gift shop, bar facilities, expanded washrooms including an accessible washroom, an elevator, along with a gallery space on the second floor, and expanded administration office space. A sprinkler system was installed and the main auditorium's ceiling was reconstructed and repainted with smaller details  including the fleur-de-lys and daisies from the original 1927 ceiling highlighted in silver. The Savoy stayed open through the 18 months of renovations and on completion a ribbon cutting and concert were held on 13 June 1998 to celebrate the new space.\n\n\n=== 2018-2019 upgrades ===\n\nThe most recent upgrades occurred between 2018 and 2019. With the help of $2.93 million in funding from the federal and provincial governments the Savoy modernized many key aspects of the theatre. These renovations included much improved insulation and modernized heating and air conditioning throughout the building, renovations to the lobby area, repairs to the foundation, new performer/production washrooms equipped with showers, remodeling of the dressing rooms and the Green Room, renovated public washrooms on both the main level and balcony level, upgrades to outdoor lighting and canopy, a new metal roof, and upgrades to all sound and lighting systems.\nThe Savoy remained open and shows continued while the upgrades were completed.\n\n\n== The Savoy Theatre today ==\nSince then, the Savoy has a wide variety of culture entertainment. Over 40,000 people attend performances at the Savoy Theatre each year.\n\n“The Savoy has been providing entertainment for Cape Breton for 90 years which is a big milestone,” says Pam Leader, executive director of Glace Bay’s Savoy Theatre. “There aren’t many other theatres this old - the Imperial in St. John may be 100 - the Savoy is definitely one of the oldest live theatre venues in Canada and we’re still going strong.”\nThe Savoy stage has been graced by a virtual Who's Who of Cape Breton and Canadian talent, including Rita MacNeil, The Rankin Family, The Barra MacNeils, Ashley MacIssac, The White Stripes, The Barenaked Ladies, Jeremy Dutcher, Raine Maida and Chantal Kreviazuk, k.d. lang, Mr. Dressup, Sarah McLaughlin, The Royal Winnipeg Ballet, Blue Rodeo, Liona Boyd, Harry Chapin, Melissa Etheridge, Leonard Cohen, and hundreds of others.\nRecent productions have included performances by Johnny Reid and Brett Kissel, as well as local productions of the musicals 'Dear Rita', 'Elf', and 'Jersey Boys', as well as Johnny Reid's new musical Maggie.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Savoy Theatre Site\nSavoy Video Tour",

        "content": "The Skagafjörður Folk Museum is an outdoor settlement museum that was established in 1948 when the National Museum of Iceland acquired the rights to use the old town of Glaumbær at Langholt. It is also a center for housing Skagafjörður artifacts.\nThe turf houses in Glaumbær were lived in up until the year 1947 when the National Museum of Iceland acquired the site. The Skagafjörður Folk Museum, founded on May 29, 1948, obtained the rights to use the town and opened an exhibition there on June 15, 1952. The museum's turf houses contain many items; most are tools related to domestic life and techniques used in an earlier era. The complex consists of thirteen turf houses, six with front-facing gables. The site is unique among Icelandic turf farms insofar as very small stones are used in the walls in a way that is rarely found in the municipality of Glaumbær.\nTwo old wooden houses have been moved to the museum site at Glaumbær. Áshús is from Ás in Hegranes. It was built between 1884–1886 to house Skagafjörður's women's school. It never fulfilled its original purpose and was used as a residence until 1977. It was then relocated to Glaumbær in 1991. The house is now a coffee shop, exhibit, and storage area.\nGilsstofa was originally built in Espihóll in Eyjafjörður in 1849. It was taken down in 1861 and moved to Akureyri. From there it was transported by boat to Kolkuós, re-built in Hjaltastaðir in Blönduhlíð, moved to Reynistaður in 1872, to Gil in Borgarsveit in 1884, and finally to Sauðárkrókur in 1891 where it stood until 1985 when it was moved to Kringlumýri in Blönduhlíð. It stayed there until 1996 and was reconstructed there to be as close to the original as possible, but little was left of the original wood after its many relocations. It now contains the museum shop and office, plus an area for the staff.\nIn 1998 the museum acquired artifacts from Sauðárkrókur to display. The museum there also has a permanent exhibition located in the old workshops from Krókurinn, as well as special exhibitions. There are offices for employees who conduct research and engage in the preservation and dissemination of findings, and the museum's main storage facility. The museum has set up many displays in Skagafjörður, such as in Hólar and Hofsós, and has published a variety of materials about the culture of Skagafjörður's buildings.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Patricio Pedro Escobal López (24 August 1903 – 25 November 2002), better known as Perico Escobal,  was a Spanish footballer who played as a defender for Real Madrid and Racing de Madrid. With the former, he played 82 official matches and won six regional championships. He was also a member of the Spanish football squad that competed in the 1924 Summer Olympics, but he did not play in any matches.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nPatricio Escobal was born on 24 August 1903 in Logroño to a Biscayan father from Galdames and a La Rioja mother from Nalda. He grew up among books and balls dreaming of one day being an engineer in the metropolitan area. He began his studies in his native Logroño, where he attended the first two years of high school, but then he moved to the capital, where he studied at Colegio de Chamartín and later graduated as an engineer while also excelling in football as a youth player at Colegio del Pilar.\n\n\n== Club career ==\n\nIn 1920, combining his studies in industrial engineering, he signed for Real Madrid, making his debut in Porto at the age of 18, and playing for the team until 1927, when he was diagnosed with an illness that ended his time as a Madrid player. He was advised to stop actively playing sports and although he remained linked to Madrid as an equipier, he continued playing football for Racing de Madrid, but when Racing withdrew from the championship, he joined CD Nacional de Madrid, and after a short-lived stint there, he finally returned to Real for the 1930–31 season. During his decade in Madrid, Escobal formed a famous and elegant defensive partnership with Félix Quesada, one of the most regular and efficient couples in the history of Real Madrid. It was said that Escobal took street girls for being handsome, cultured and elegant. Eventually, he earned the respect of sports critics, who nicknamed him \"the Fakir\".\nEscobal became captain of the Madrid team, as well as a regular participant in Madrid national team matches against foreign clubs. Likewise, he was present at all the great events that involved Real Madrid, such as at the inauguration of the Campo del Hipódromo.\nFollowing a three-year hiatus, Escobal returned to the active practice of football in his hometown Logroño, where he played for a season and a half, forming a defensive pair with Recarte. On 2 September 1934, he played his last game as an active player and then he left football to dedicate himself entirely to engineering, a profession in which he had a hopeful beginning in the Logroño City Council.\n\n\n== International career ==\nEscobal was a member of the Spanish football squad that competed in the 1924 Summer Olympics, but he did not play in any matches as Spain was knockout by Italy.\n\n\n== Professional career ==\nPerico was a young man with deep political concerns, affiliated with the Republican Left. He firmly believed that Spain would soon experience a period of great prosperity, but things went wrong and the hatred between the political factions soon acquired a dark, almost solid consistency, so Escobal sought refuge in his native Logroño where he took a position as an engineer in the City Council, married Teresa Castroviejo, daughter of a well-known dental professional in Logroño, and played in the local football club, which had just inaugurated the Las Gaunas field. He hung up his boots in 1934 to dedicate himself entirely to engineering, but he was able to keep his job as an engineer in the City Council for only four months since he was unjustly dispossessed in September 1934.\nEscobal then earned the dislike of the opposing sector of the Rioja political forces, as he fought for his place with the same intensity that he exhibited on the football fields, but that fight earned him his death in prison. Then with the electoral victory of the Popular Front, on 14 September 1936, he was reinstated in his position and compensated for unfair dismissal.\n\n\n== Civil War and exile ==\nEscobal remained in his job for four months again, until the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in July 1936. Escobal went to the street once again, but this time heading down a dark path of no return, since he did so by being accused of being a leftist and a Freemason and once again landing him in jail on the rebel side. He was then sentenced to 30 years in prison, but unlike his Republican co-religionists, he saved his life by escaping execution on four occasions not only because of the well-off and good position of his family, but also due to being a famous football player. According to historian Paul Preston, \"The scandal that his death could trigger\" was what saved him. His fame, however, did not prevent him from being subjected to torture and ill-treatment during his stay in prison. Those eighteen months that he spent sick with tuberculosis, in an infected cot, debased his soul as he witnessed the execution of many of his companions.\nIn 1940, Escobal hurriedly fled his homeland to board a ship in Portugalete, which took him and his wife, María Teresa Castroviejo, into exile to Cuba and later to the United States, and while in the latter, he wrote a book titled Las Sacas in which he recounted his terrible experience during the war. In the United States, Escobal worked as an engineer and was responsible for the lighting of Queens, for which he was awarded.\nAfter the death of Francisco Franco in Spain, Escobal achieved fame abroad because in 1968, his memoirs appeared in English in 1974 with the title \"Death Row\" and which, after some clandestine editions, were published in Spanish with the title Las Sacas.\n\n\n== Death ==\nEscobal died alone in New York on 25 November 2002, at the age of 99. His body remained abandoned in the New York morgue for months before someone buried him. In his hometown, Logroño, this fact went unnoticed, even among those who still remembered him as an extraordinary athlete.\nA few years later in 2005, with the latest reissue of his autobiography, Las Sacas, his memory returned to this Rioja land. In a brief note on its website in October 2005, Real Madrid reviewed this reissue in an article called \"The memoirs of Perico Escobal, Real Madrid captain sentenced to death\".\n\n\n== Honours ==\nMadrid FC\n\nCentro Championship:\nWinners (6): 1921–22, 1922–23, 1923–24, 1925–26, 1926–27, and 1930–31\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nPreston, Paul (2011).

However, similar to the 2018 bill provisions, a transgender person can be identified as male or female only after applying for a revised certificate to the district magistrate, post sex reassignment surgery.\n\n\n=== Ireland ===\nUnder the Gender Recognition Act 2015, Irish citizens are allowed to apply for a gender recognition certificate to change their gender on government documents through self-determination. The law does not require any medical intervention by the applicant nor an assessment by medical professionals.\n\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n\nIn the United Kingdom, citizens who seek to change their legal gender must appear before the Gender Recognition Panel, a national tribunal which issues a gender recognition certificate to applicants.

        "content": "The 1923 Draft Treaty of Mutual Assistance was an unsuccessful proposal made by the League of Nations to address the issue of disarmament and security in Europe after World War I. It was rejected by the British government in 1924 and was never adopted.\nThe Draft Treaty was an early attempt by the League of Nations to create a system of collective security and disarmament, but it was ultimately rejected by key member states, leading the League to pursue alternative approaches that also ultimately failed to gain traction.\n\n\n== History ==\nDisarmament was a high priority for the League, after the terrible experience of World War I. A leading British diplomat Lord Robert Cecil helped prepare the proposal for the League's Temporary Mixed Commission for Disarmament (TMC). \nNevertheless, it proved impossible to come up with a way to enforce disarmament. The dilemma was that if almost everyone was disarmed, the remaining armed power would be very dangerous. In the context of Europe in the 1920s, the specific fear was that Germany could quickly rearm and threaten the neighbour, and the disarmed members of the League would be helpless to stop it. Lord Cecil (at the time a delegate from South Africa) proposed a solution in 1922 called the \"Treaty of Mutual Guarantee\". Every country that signed, and had reduced its armaments according to the agreed schedule, would be protected. If anyone attacked it, the Treaty would guarantee that the victim would be immediately supported by all the other signatories. France and Britain, although quarrelling on many other issues, at first supported the proposal. As the other nations debated the proposal, confusion and difficulty arose – some governments said the proposal went too far, others said it did not go far enough, and few were actually satisfied with it. Latin American states ignored the issue as did the United States (which never joined the League.). The report of the Permanent Elements Commission, representing military leaders, said such a treaty would never work. Finally, in September 1923 a French draft retitled the \"Treaty of Mutual Assistance\" was supported by the majority, with a large dissenting minority. At the time Italy and Greece were at swords' points, so the proposed treaty was not just a hypothetical solution to imaginary problems. Lord Cecil, now a member of the British government, built up support. The new version would empower the Consul to designate an aggressor, apply economic sanctions, mobilize military forces, and supervise their action.\nIn 1924 the new British Labour government under Ramsay MacDonald reversed course and opposed the treaty, with support from Canada. The fear was that it would weaken the newly formed British Commonwealth of Nations by diverting military strength. Canada also feared it would be obliged to declare war on the United States. The proposal was now dead.\n\n\n== Contents ==\nThe key points were:\n\nIt proposed to make war of aggression illegal,\nand if a country was attacked, all League members would send troops to defend the victim.\nThe goal was to provide security assurances that would allow countries to disarm, as many were reluctant to disarm without guarantees of protection. The draft treaty was discussed at the League Assembly in September 1923, but was ultimately rejected, primarily due to objections from Great Britain, which feared committing troops that it wanted to keep in reserve to defend the British Empire.\n\n\n== Alternatives ==\nThe failure of the Draft Treaty of Mutual Assistance led the League to try a different approach in 1924 with the Geneva Protocol. It aimed to tie together security, disarmament, and compulsory arbitration of disputes. However, the Geneva Protocol also failed to gain acceptance.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDisarmament\nUnited Kingdom and the League of Nations#Treaty of Mutual Guarantee\nLocarno Treaties\nInternational relations (1919–1939)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nDeBenedetti, Charles. \"The Origins of Neutrality Revision: The American Plan of 1924.\" The Historian 35.1 (1972): 75–89.\nHenig, Ruth.

        "content": "On 16 April 2024, Érika de Souza Vieira Nunes, a 42-year-old Brazilian woman, brought the corpse of her 68-year-old uncle, Paulo Roberto Braga, to an Itaú bank branch in an attempt to withdraw a loan of 17,000 Brazilian reais. The incident occurred in the Bangu neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro and was recorded by bank employees.\nThe case garnered international attention, being reported in at least France, the United States, Argentina, Germany, Portugal, and Australia.\n\n\n== Incident ==\nOn 16 April 2024, Érika de Souza Vieira brought her uncle, Paulo Roberto Braga, to an Itaú bank branch. During the wait to be attended to, Érika sat down while holding Uncle Paulo's head with her hand; at one point, when she removed her hand from his head to rummage through her bag, Paulo's head slumped. At another moment, she went to the bathroom, where she stayed for about six minutes; during this time, a staff member had to support Paulo's head. Upon returning, Érika attempted to give water to her uncle; shortly after, she was finally attended to. Bank attendants recorded the moment; in the video, Érika was constantly trying to keep Paulo's head up while talking to him, asking him to sign the document to withdraw a loan of 17,000 Brazilian reais. The bank employees commented on Paulo's paleness, but his niece said, \"he's always like that\". Bank staff became suspicious of Érika's behavior and called the police. Emergency services were dispatched to the scene and determined that the man had been deceased, apparently for several hours; the doctor who attended to Paulo at the bank said that the elderly man showed livor mortis, discolorations that typically appear about two hours after death. Erika was arrested on the spot for attempted theft by fraud and desecration of a corpse.\nThe autopsy report stated that it was not possible to determine whether Paulo had died before or after arriving at the bank; security camera footage shows the elderly man entering the bank with his body already inert, lacking muscle control, and his neck slumped to the side. According to two experts who analyzed the video, Paulo was already deceased upon entering the agency.\n\n\n== Victim ==\nPaulo Roberto Braga (born 29 February 1956 in Rio de Janeiro) was a bus driver and had four siblings who lived in other states, so he had little contact with them. He had been living with his niece Érika and three of her children in the Bangu neighborhood for 15 years. Paulo had no children of his own and never married, although he had companions throughout his life. According to one of his nephews, Paulo had issues with alcohol consumption. According to the family, his health deteriorated because of drinking; Paulo even lost some of his mobility. He died at the age of 68 on 16 April 2024; according to a report from the Institute of Legal Medicine, this occurred between 11:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m due to bronchoaspiration of stomach contents and cardiac failure. He was buried in the Campo Grande Cemetery on 20 April, after his family obtained a free burial for those who claim they are unable to afford the costs.\n\n\n== Suspect ==\nAt the time of the incident, Érika de Souza Vieira Nunes (born 24 May 1981 in Rio de Janeiro) was 42 years old. She was arrested on the spot for attempted theft by fraud and desecration of a corpse. According to her family, Érika has psychiatric problems. In 2022, a report stated that she was dependent on sedatives, had symptoms of depression, suicidal thoughts, and auditory hallucinations. In 2023, another psychiatrist recommended Érika's hospitalization due to her dependence on sedatives and hypnotics. According to one of her children, she has attempted suicide several times.\n\n\n== Reactions ==\nThe incident involving the corpse of Paulo Roberto Braga garnered global attention. It was reported by at least The Guardian, CNN, NBC News, USA Today, The Times of India, Le Parisien, Diário de Notícias, Perth Now, Tag24, and Daily Mirror. In The Sun, the case was called a \"shameless scam\"; in the Daily Star, it was compared to the 1989 movie Weekend at Bernie's. The Argentine newspaper La Nación referred to the incident as \"horror en Brasil\". In the United States, Donald Trump ally Ryan Fournier compared Uncle Paulo to then-president Joe Biden. On X (formerly Twitter), he commented on the video showing Erika trying to get Paulo's corpse to sign a document. Fournier wrote, \"Make him President\"; in the 2024 presidential election, age was one of the central points of the dispute.\n\n\n== References ==",
