        "content": "Casimiro Mallorquí Tutusaus (11 October 1894 – 21 June 1966) was a Spanish footballer who played as a forward for Espanyol and Barcelona. He later worked as a football referee. He later worked as a football referee. He was one of the most outstanding footballers of the 1910s and 1920s.\n\n\n== Club career ==\nBeing the son of a well-off family in Valls, Mallorquí was sent to France to complete his studies, and while there, he developed a deep interest in football, playing this sport with CU Sportive Marais and Crédit Lyonnais in 1911–12. He returned to his homeland in 1912, at the age of 18, and in that same year, he joined the ranks of FC Espanya de Barcelona, where he formed an attacking partnership with Gabriel Bau and Antonio Baró, and quickly became a key element of the team. Even though the team's main source of power was its infamous backline made of Hermenegild Casellas and Eduardo Reguera, he also played a very important role in the team's rise to national dominance, competing head-to-head against the likes of Barcelona and Espanyol, helping FC Espanya win its first-ever pieces of silverware, the Catalan championship in 1912–13.\nHis great attacking performances eventually drew the attention of Barcelona, who signed him in 1913, thus becoming the first footballer from the Tarragona area to play for the club. At Barça, Mallorquí was mostly used as a substitute by then coach Jack Greenwell due to the presence of Vicente Martínez, Paulino Alcántara, Enrique Peris, and his former teammate Bau.\nIn 1916 Mallorquí signed for RCD Espanyol, the club where he spent the most time, playing a total of 7 seasons with them during three different stages, the first of which lasting only one year as he then joined FC Atlético de Sabadell in an equally short spell as he then returned to Espanyol at the end of the season. His second and third spells at Espanyol (1918–21 and 1923–26) both lasted three seasons, being interrupted by a two-year stay at FC Barcelona between 1921 and 1923, thus being a part of the club's first golden age that won two Catalan championships and one Copa del Rey between 1920 and 1923; however, he did not play a major role in these triumphs because that golden age prevented him from often playing in a first-team consisting of the likes of Vicente Piera, Josep Samitier, Ricardo Zamora, Alcántara and Sagi-Barba. Despite not being a prominent regular, Mallorquí played a match in the 1922 Copa del Rey, thus being a part of the squad that won the 1922 Cup title. In total, he played 25 official matches for Barça, scoring five goals.\nWhen he retired in 1927, at the age of 33, Mallorquí became a referee, a task he did until his early 40s.\n\n\n== International career ==\nLike many other FC Barcelona and RCD Espanyol players of that time, Mallorquí was eligible to play for the Catalan national team, scoring two goals in 9 matches between 1915 and 1921. In May 1915, he was a member of the team that participated in the first edition of the Prince of Asturias Cup in 1915, an inter-regional competition organized by the RFEF.\nOn 10 July 1927, Mallorquí was the subject of a tribute match along with José Maria Canals, which took place at the Sarrià Stadium between Catalonia and RCD Espanyol, playing for the former in a 1–4 loss.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nFC Espanya\n\nCatalan Championships: 1912–13\nBarcelona\n\nCatalan Championships: 1916 and 1922\nCopa del Rey: 1922\nCatalonia\n\nPrince of Asturias Cup runner-up: 1915\n\n\n== References ==",

In 1700, it was rebuilt as the Boyle School, a boy's grammar school endowed by Robert Boyle.  The building later became a rectory, and then in the late 20th century became a private house.  It has been Grade II* listed since 1954.\nThe house is built of stone, with quoins, and a stone slate roof with stone copings and shaped kneelers.  It has two storeys and seven bays, with a single-storey two-bay block at right angles connected by a wall.  In the centre is a full-height gabled porch containing a doorway with a rusticated surround and voussoirs, and a semicircular hood mould, above which is a four-light window and a carved tablet with a triangular hood mould.  In the ground floor are cross windows with sashes, and the upper floor contains double-chamfered mullioned windows.  At the rear is a six-light window with a round head and cusped lights.  In the rear block is a doorway with a four-centred arched lintel.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGrade II* listed buildings in North Yorkshire\nListed buildings in Bolton Abbey\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 1851 Avenwedde rail accident was a train derailment that occurred near Gütersloh, Germany on January 21st of that year.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1848, the \"Muenster\", a steam engine, was designed and built specifically for the Cologne railway. The distance between the axles and the wheelbases combined with the weight distribution of the engine and boiler caused a natural imbalance as the train would travel. In 1851, this type of train was being used during the fatal incident.\n\n\n== Accident ==\nOn January 21, 1851, a royal train carrying Prince Friedrich Wilhem was traveling near Gütersloh. As it passed through, Avenwedde, 3 kilometers away from Gütersloh, the engine began to wobble due to balance issues. The train then fully derailed, taking several coaches with it. Prince Wilhelm was among the injured, but survived. 3 people would die as a result of the accident. Among the dead were two crew members of the train, as well as well as a US secretary named John B. Andre who died while attempting to leap from his tipping carriage, only to be crushed as a result. It was the first German rail accident to result in multiple fatalities.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nOn June 21, 1865, the municipality of Avenwedde erected a memorial both in memorial of the lives lost in the accident, but also with gratitude that Prince Wilhelm had survived the ordeal. The memorial was placed at the site of the accident.\nThe \"Muenster\" train would also be redesigned as a result of the crash. The wheelbase of the train would expanded an additional five feet in diameter to a length around 14 feet and 2 inches to counteract the weight of the engine body. This redesign made the engines run more efficiently.\n\n\n== References ==",

While the joint forces were able to destroy the camp, some jihadists escaped.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Wagadou Forest in northern Mali was a hub for Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) during the early 2010s and late 2000s, and the group launched multiple raids against Malian and Mauritanian forces from the forest between 2005 and 2011. The killing of al-Qaeda emir Osama bin Laden in Pakistan by American forces in May 2011 emboldened the Mauritanian and Malian governments to launch an offensive that would defeat al-Qaeda's affiliate AQIM.\n\n\n== Battle ==\nMalian and Mauritanian forces launched the joint offensive at 5:45pm into the forest. AQIM jihadists were protected by deep trench networks and antipersonnel mines surrounding their base in the forest. Mauritanian special intervention groups, created to fight jihadist incursions, were powered by ultralight aviation. A Malian commander on the ground stated that fighting was \"very fierce.\" While Malian and Mauritanian forces were able to destroy the AQIM base, combing operations continued in the days following the battle for jihadists that had fled.\nThe Mauritanian Army released a statement announcing the deaths of two soldiers and seven injured, and that fifteen jihadists had been killed. The statement also claimed the injuries of several dozen jihadists, and that eleven more were captured by the Malian Army. AQIM claimed only fifteen of their fighters were present during the battle, and claimed the deaths of twenty Mauritanian soldiers and destruction of twelve vehicles. They also claimed that they had \"no news\" from two of their fighters.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Shuty is a series of 3D printed firearms created by Derwood, a 47-year-old West Virginia carpenter. The Shuty is a semi-automatic pistol that is mostly 3d printed but requires some factory-made gun parts. It is chambered in 9×19mm Parabellum.\n\n\n== Design ==\nThe Shuty V4 MP-1 pistol uses a closed bolt simple blowback action like the Heckler & Koch UMP. The lower and upper receiver are 3D printed, a Glock barrel, metal hammer, metal firing pin and screws and bolts from the hardware store are used. The AP-9 has a buffer tube sticking out of its back which houses the action similar to an AR-15. None of the components require registration in the US, making it a privately made firearm.\n\n\n== Variants ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of notable 3D printed weapons and parts\nPrivately made firearm\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Jennifer Pauline Ogilvie is a Canadian physicist and Professor of Physics, Biophysics, and Macromolecular Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan. She develops multidimensional spectroscopic and microscopy-based methods to exploit the interactions between ultrafast (~10−15 s) pulses and matter. She is interested in the ultrafast energy transport and conversion processes in light-harvesting systems.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nOgilvie is from Canada. She was an undergraduate student at the University of Waterloo, and moved to Simon Fraser University for her graduate research. Her doctoral research at the University of Toronto involved spectroscopic investigations into hemoprotein. She developed ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy to understand the dynamics of photodissociation. She demonstrated that when the carbon monoxide ligand breaks from myoglobin it establishes coherent oscillations that initiate motions along the protein function pathway. She developed phase-grating spectroscopy to study ligand escape from the myoglobin.\n\n\n== Research and career ==\nOgilive develops ultrafast spectroscopic and microscopic methods to better understand biological processes across a range of length scales. The processes that take place during photosynthesis occur on ultrafast timescales with high quantum efficiencies. Ogilive believes that by elucidating the design rules of systems involved in photosynthesis it will be possible to create more efficient artificial light harvesting systems.  She has explored organic synthesis as a strategy to design new molecular systems for quantum information science.\n\n\n== Select publications ==\nGregory D Scholes; Graham R Fleming; Lin X Chen; et al.

Before college he played for the Brooks Bandits of the Alberta Junior Hockey League. He was undrafted by the NHL, but after his college career ended in 2022 he was signed as a free agent by the Rangers.  The Rangers sent him to their American Hockey League affiliate, the Hartford Wolf Pack, where he played 15 games in the 2021–22 season, scoring no goals and one assist. In 61 games for the Wolf Pack in 2022–23, he scored 4 goals and had 11 assists.  In 2023-24 he again started the season at Hartford.  In February 2024 he signed a 2-year contract extension with the Rangers. He was recalled to the Rangers on March 18 due to an injury to Ryan Lindgren and made his NHL debut on March 26 in a game against the Philadelphia Flyers.\n\n\n== Career statistics ==\n\n\n=== Regular season and playoffs ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBiographical information and career statistics from Eliteprospects.com, or The Internet Hockey Database",

        "content": "Carter Alphonse Starocci (born February 8, 2001) is an American freestyle and former folkstyle wrestler who competes at 174 pounds. In freestyle, he was a U23 World bronze medalist in 2022.\nIn folkstyle, Starocci became the sixth four-time NCAA Division I National champion in history, and was also a two-time Big Ten Conference champion out of the Pennsylvania State University.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== High school ===\nStarocci was born and raised in Erie, Pennsylvania, where he started wrestling at the age of three, later on attending Cathedral Preparatory School. During his high school years, Starocci became a two-time PIAA state champion and a four-time state placer. In freestyle, he placed at multiple national tournaments and was a Fargo National champion as well as in Greco-Roman. One of the top-recruits in the country, Starocci committed to wrestle for the Penn State Nittany Lions, and closed out his high school career at 172–10.\n\n\n=== Pennsylvania State University ===\n\n\n==== 2019–2020 ====\nStarocci wore a redshirt during his first year in college, racking up an unbeaten 19–0 record and titles from the Southern Scuffle, the Edinboro Open, the Patriot Open and the Clarion Open while wrestling unattached.\n\n\n==== 2020–2021 ====\nCompeting as a freshman, Starocci recorded a 6–1 mark in dual meets during regular season, with a lone loss to DJ Washington though a notable victory over All-American Logan Massa. At the Big Ten Conference Championships, Starocci placed second, falling to Michael Kemerer from Iowa after defeating Nebraska's All-American Mikey Labriola to cruise to the finals. Starocci, the third-seed, then became the NCAA Division I National champion with a series of back-to-back wins, and a rematch-victory over Kemerer in the finals to top it off.\nAfter the season, Starocci went up 13 pounds and competed at the US Olympic Team Trials at 86 kilograms, having qualified by becoming an NCAA champion a month before. He was eliminated after losing back-to-back matches to U23 World champion Bo Nickal and NCAA champion Myles Martin.\n\n\n==== 2021–2022 ====\nIn September 2021, Starocci competed at the US World Team Trials at 79 kilograms, where after falling in the first round to US National champion Taylor Lujan, he racked up wins over the likes of teammate and three-time NCAA champion Jason Nolf and All-Americans Chance Marsteller and Evan Wick.\nBack to folkstyle, Starocci went 15–0 in dual meets as a sophomore, grabbed his first Big Ten Conference title and became a back-to-back NCAA Division I National champion with victories over fellow NCAA champion Mekhi Lewis, three-time All-American Hayden Hidlay and two-time All-American Michael Kemerer, closing out the year at 25–0.\nHe then competed at the US World Team Trials Challenge Tournament in May, where after falling to US National runner-up Chance Marsteller in a rematch, Starocci defeated three straight opponents, including Dan Hodge Trophy winner Alex Dieringer and three-time All-American David McFadden, to place third. A true-third match against fellow two-time NCAA champion Vincenzo Joseph was set to take place in June at Final X NYC, however, Joseph forfeited the match and Starocci earned a US National Team spot, which qualified him for the U23 World Championships.\nIn October, Starocci became a U23 World bronze medalist, with wins over U20 World medalist Abdulvasi Balta and U23 European medalist Valentyn Babii though a close loss to Daulet Yergesh in the semi-finals.\n\n\n==== 2022–2023 ====\nBack to folkstyle, Starocci went 16–0 in dual meets during regular season, claimed the Big Ten title and became a three-time 2023 NCAA Division I National champion. He closed up the year at 24–0, with five victories over All-Americans.\nIn April, Starocci reached the semi-finals of the US Open National Championships with a dominant win over four-time All-American Michael Kemerer, though was defeated by three-time NCAA champion Alex Dieringer in a rematch, and subsequently dropped out of the tournament to place sixth.\n\n\n==== 2023–2024 ====\nA senior, Starocci came in the season looking to become the sixth four-time NCAA champion in history, and looked fit to do so after picking up nine dual meet victories and a Journeymen Classic title. However, he suffered a knee injury right at the end of his last dual meet, and was forced to medical forfeit out of the Big Ten Championships, though earned an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament due to past accomplishments. After two forfeits which counted as losses, Starocci, the ninth-seed, earned four straight victories, including two over past NCAA champions Mekhi Lewis and Shane Griffith, before cruising to the finals and defeating Rocco Welsh to become a four-time NCAA champion.\nDue to COVID-19 protocols, Starocci has one more year of eligibility, though has not expressed interest in using it. He is set to compete at the US Olympic Team Trials in April.\n\n\n== Freestyle record ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCarter Starocci at the International Wrestling Database",

        "content": "Christ in the Garden of Olives is an oil on canvas painting by French painter Théodore Chassériau, from 1840. It was created following a commission from the Ministry of the Interior. The large format painting was presented at the Salon of Paris, in 1840. After a transfer from the church of Saint-Jean-d'Angély, in Charente-Maritime, it was moved to the Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon.\n\n\n== Description and analysis ==\nThe work depicts the Christian iconographic subject of the Agony of Jesus in the Garden of Olives. In this painting, Jesus Christ is accompanied by three apostles: Peter, John and James the Greater. After praying three times to God on Mount Gethsemane, Jesus receives, from three angels, the chalice and the symbols of the Passion of Christ. In the background, Roman soldiers are shown with Judas leading them to Christ.\nChassérieu had been a disciple of neoclassical master Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres was also an admirer of the romanticism of Eugène Delacroix. Not surprisingly, this work is influenced by both styles. Ingres' influence appears mixed with the dramaturgy of the moment. The traditional colors of Christ are shown in a chiaroscuro. Few geometric shapes and the aerial perspective demonstrate the influence of the romantic style.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "On July 1, 2020, Fulani militants attacked four Dogon villages in Mali's Bankass Cercle, killing at least thirty-three people.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThroughout the Mali War, inter-ethnic clashes have erupted several times between Dogon dozos and Fulani militants over land usage stemming from the Fulani's pastoralist lifestyles and the Dogon using their land for farming. When the Mali War intensified in the Mopti Region, the jihadist Katiba Macina movement attracted many young Fulani as it overthrew the traditional Fulani caste system. Around this time, Dogon dozos formed Dan Na Ambassagou militias in Dogon areas, which were armed by the Malian government. This made inter-ethnic conflict not just between Dogon and Fulani, but often also between the jihadist Katiba Macina and the larger Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin against the pro-government Dan Na Ambassagou. In the area of the massacres, Dogon militants had recently launched attacks against Fulani villages.\n\n\n== Massacres ==\nAround sixty motorcycles attacked the village of Pangadougou around 3pm, killing one person. The jihadists then moved onto the village of Djimdo, targeting residents who were returning to the village from their fields. In Gouari, sixteen people were killed and four others were injured. The last village attacked by the jihadists was Dialaikanda, although nobody was killed or injured in the attack. An elder from Gouari who survived the massacre stated that there were no security forces in the town between 3pm and 9pm, and chastised the Malian army for never being able to prevent an attack by jihadists. The residents' livestock was seized by the attackers, and several buildings were burnt down in Gouari and Djimdo.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nNo group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. However, Fulani militants of Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin were suspected to be responsible. An anonymous Malian official stated that at least thirty people were killed in the massacres, with that number later rising to thirty-three people killed and five others injured, as well as an unknown number of residents missing. Amnesty International stated thirty-two people had been killed in a 2022 report.\nA Malian military unit was dispatched to the area the following day, and helped bury thirty-one bodies. On July 3, Malian forces received information about a renewed attack in Gouari, and sent a contingent of soldiers to the village. However, the village was deserted, and nine Malian soldiers were killed and two others were injured in an ambush.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Fotballklubben Union Carl Berner is an association football club from Grünerløkka, Oslo, Norway.\nThe club was founded as FK Fremad Famagusta in 2008 as a team for people from the Lillehammer region residing in Oslo. Mirroring the old team FK Fremad from Lillehammer, the \"Famagusta\" moniker was also added to honour Anorthosis Famagusta. Chess champion Magnus Carlsen notably played for the team as a hobby.Fremad Famagusta experienced several promotions and managed to reach the Fourth Division, but withered during the COVID-19 pandemic in Norway when, among others, the entire 2020 season was annulled below the Second Division. Contesting the 2021 Fourth Division, the team decided to fold. The club was however resurrected under a new identity, Union Carl Berner. The name is inspired by Union Berlin and the geographical area around Carl Berners plass, but also the pub Carls co-owned by Union Carl Berner chairman, former agent Lars Petter Fosdahl.Winning repromotion to the 2023 Fourth Division, Union Carl Berner promptly constructed a rivalry with Grüner IL, the respective clubs representing different parts of Grünerløkka borough. The rivalry was dubbed \"Bydel Classico\". In 2024, Union Carl Berner reached the first round of the Norwegian Football Cup for the first time. Facing Vålerenga, they opted to play at Vålerenga's historical home ground Jordal Idrettspark.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Beatrice Lilias Rennie (21 September 1893 – 4 September 1971) was an Australian co-founder and the headmistress of Queenwood School for Girls in Sydney.\n\n\n== Life ==\nRennie was born in 1893 in Dubbo. Her parents were Lilias (born Millar) and a draughtsman named Charles Edward Rennie. They had both been born in Australia. She was their sixth child and they had two more. In time her family moved to Sydney ending up in the suburb of Mosman. She graduated from the University of Sydney in 1916.\nIn 1918 she first met Grace Lawrence who was the headmistress of the Glennie Memorial School in Queensland. Rennie was teaching the P.E, and humanities as an assistant headmistress. They got on well and went on a trip together in 1921 to Europe. They went to see leading schools for girls together. Rennie continued to teach at the school, looking after the library and the school magazine. \nIn 1925 she and Grace Lawrence left the Glennie Memorial School and they bought a large house in Sydney. There they started a school for girls that they called Queenwood. The school was founded on 21 September which was Rennie's birthday and the school's roll listed the names of five girls. In 1928 the other significant figure in the schools history, Violet Medway, was employed.\nRennie shared her leadership role with Violet Medway in 1942. Rennie continued to live at the school after she retired in 1962.\nRennie died in Mosman in 1971. The Queenwood school continued noting Lawrence and Rennie as their founders. The school holds a tradition of \"raising the flowers\" on the school's and Rennie's birthday.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBiography at ADB",

        "content": "\"Too Much\" is a song recorded by Norwegian singer-songwriter Girl in Red from her second studio and debut major-label album I'm Doing It Again Baby! (2024). The song was released on 9 February 2024 through Columbia Records as the lead single from the album. A pop-rock song written and produced by the artist along with Matias Tellez, it marked her first music material released in a two-year period, since her 2022 single \"October Passed Me By\". In parallel, a music video was also released.\n\n\n== Background ==\nGirl in Red released a song titled \"October Passed Me By\" in 2022, which served as the sequel of to her 2018 single \"We Fell In Love In October\", and as the follow-up of her debut studio album If I Could Make It Go Quiet, released on 30 April 2021. At the beginning of 2024, she confirmed that she was working in new music material, for the first time in two years, by sharing an snippet of a track in a video of her on a set dancing to an unreleased song, which she labeled \"the song of the summer\". On 29 January, she posted another snippet of an audio file on her social media accounts. On the following day, she confirmed that it was part of \"Too Much\", when she announced its release alongside her second album, I'm Doing It Again Baby!.\n\n\n== Composition ==\n\"Too Much\" is a pop-rock song, described by Billboard as a \"kiss-off to a lover who just cannot understand [the artist's] idiosyncrasies\". It contains a pop-punk guitar blast and a \"pumping\" dance beat. While describing the song as epic and empowering, writing for NME, Liberty Dunworth interpreted that she \"explores the theme of being in love with someone who is emotionally unavailable, and the empowerment that can come by embracing your vulnerability and releasing your self worth\". According to Clash, it is a song about \"being pushed into a corner, about being told their your emotions need to be minimised, or in some cases not heard at all\". About the inspiration behind the track, Girl in Red stated: \"I've always been told I'm too much. Throughout my whole childhood and in my adult years. Getting shut down when I'm at my happiest or most excited made me feel self-conscious, alienated, and weird. It wasn't until I encountered the same feeling in my relationships, that I realised how much it actually hurt me to never feel fully accepted for who I am. As well I think culturally people tend to be too cool to have fun or to show true excitement and emotions, and I'm so tired of that facade\".\n\n\n== Music video ==\nA music video for \"Too Much\", directed by Fiona Jane Burgess and produced by Smuggler, was released on 9 February 2024. In the \"artsy\" video, the singer \"is seen getting increasingly frustrated as she tries to reason with a cruel partner, even taking her pleas to the theatre stage\".\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Overgrown Pond is a landscape painting by Russian painter Vasily Polenov (1844–1927), completed in 1879. The painting, which measures 80 × 124.7 cm, is part of the State Tretyakov Gallery's collection in Moscow (Inventory No. 10460).\nThe view depicted on the canvas summarizes the artist's different experiences. Polenov made several studies for the painting in 1877 when he visited his parents in the village of Petrushki near Kyiv. The canvas was completed in early 1879 in Moscow.\nThe painting Overgrown Pond was exhibited at the Moscow part of the 7th exhibition of the Association of Traveling Art Exhibitions (\"Peredvizhniki\"), opened in April 1879. For several decades the canvas was in private collections, and then, in 1928, it was acquired by the State Tretyakov Gallery.\nTogether with two other Polenov's works of the late 1870s – paintings Moscow Courtyard and Grandmother's Garden – canvas \"Overgrown Pond\" refers to \"a kind of lyrical and philosophical trilogy of the artist\". According to the art historian Aleksei Fedorov-Davydov, in the painting \"Overgrown Pond\" Polenov managed \"with the greatest force and picturesque beauty\" to express \"real, but wrapped in a kind of romance poetry of nature\". Art historian Tamara Yurova noted that this painting \"completed a certain stage of Polenov's work, marked the onset of creative maturity\".\n\n\n== History ==\nFrom 1873 to 1876 Vasily Polenov lived and worked in Paris and then returned to Russia. In 1876, having joined the Russian volunteer army to take part in the First Serbian–Ottoman War, he traveled to the area of combat operations, where he created several drawings based on his battle impressions. In June 1877, the artist came to Moscow and rented an apartment in Durnovsky lane (now Composer street) near the Church of the Transfiguration of the Savior on Peski. It is supposed that there, in the summer of the same year he started working on the paintings \"Moscow Courtyard\" and \"Grandmother's Garden\".\n\nOn July 5, 1877, the artist's parents, Dmitriy Vasilevich Polenov and Maria Alekseevna, invited him to their dacha, which was located in the village of Petrushki near Kyiv. During a trip to Kiev Governorate, most likely in August, Polenov created several sketches, which were later used by him when working on the canvases \"Overgrown Pond\" and \"Summer\". September 1877 Polenov spent in Olshanka, in the estate of his grandmother Vera Nikolaevna Voeikova, located in Borisoglebsky Uyezd Tambov Governorate. There he painted a small painting \"Pond in the Park. Olshanka\" (wood, oil, 24 × 33.6 cm, State Tretyakov Gallery, Inventory No. 11149).\nIn late 1877 – early 1878 Polenov was again in the area of military operations. This time, he went to the Bulgarian front of Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878), where he served as an artist at the headquarters of the Russian army. After returning to Moscow, Polenov rented another apartment in Olsufiev's house on Devichye Pole in Khamovniki District. The artist lived there from July 1878 to the fall of 1881, and it was there, at the beginning of the summer of 1878, that he worked on the canvas \"Overgrown Pond\", completing it in early 1879.\nOn February 23, 1879, the 7th exhibition of the Association of Traveling Art Exhibitions opened in Saint-Petersburg and lasted until March 25 before moving to Moscow, where it continued on April 22. At the St. Petersburg part of the exhibition painting \"Overgrown Pond\" was not presented, while the catalog mentioned three other paintings by Polenov – \"Udilshchiki\", \"Grandmother's Garden\" and \"Summer\". Canvas \"Overgrown Pond\" was exhibited at the Moscow part of the 7th traveling exhibition, together with Polenov's paintings \"Grandmother's Garden\", \"River\" and \"Summer Morning\" (it is not confirmed whether it was an alternative title for \"Summer\" or another canvas). An art critic from \"Moskovskie Vedomosti\" wrote that in the painting \"Overgrown Pond\" Polenov showed himself as a romanticist: \"it is not a pond 'in general'\", it has \"its own story\", \"it is what the Germans call  Stimmungsbild, such paintings are designed to give you, above all, a 'mood', and constitute in painting approximately the same thing that in poetry is \"elegy\".\n\nThe following year the painting \"Overgrown Pond\" was exhibited at the St. Petersburg part of the 8th traveling exhibition, which opened on March 6, 1880. The painting was also included in the exposition of the All-Russian Industrial and Art Exhibition of 1882, held in Moscow. In the future, the owners of the painting \"Overgrown Pond\" were E. A. Sapozhnikova and Y. I. Acharkan. The latter canvas was acquired in 1928 by the Tretyakov Gallery.\nThe painting was exhibited at several other exhibitions, including Polenov's exhibitions held in 1969 in Leningrad and in 1994–1995 in Moscow and St. Petersburg. In 1971-1972 the canvas took part in the exhibition \"Landscape Painting of the Peredvizhniki\" (Kyiv, Leningrad, Minsk, Moscow), timed to coincide with the centenary of the Peredvizhniki. With exhibitions the painting visited several foreign cities — Belgrade (1970), Bucharest (1973), Warsaw (1973), Berlin (1976), Washington, Chicago, Boston, Los Angeles (1986–1987), Cologne, Zürich (1990) and Wuppertal (2005–2006). The canvas was one of the exhibits of the anniversary exhibition for the 175th anniversary of Polenov, held from October 2019 to February 2020 at the New Tretyakov Gallery on Krymsky Val.\nThe painting \"Overgrown Pond\" is currently exhibited in Hall No. 35 of the main building of the State Tretyakov Gallery in Lavrushinsky Lane.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe view depicted in the painting \"Overgrown Pond\" summarizes different impressions of the artist. The painting depicts a part of the pond with bridges near the right edge. In the foreground, you can see the bank with green grass and wildflowers, in the background — the trees surrounding the pond park. The impression of the park's vastness is achieved by the canvas showing only the lower parts of trunks and branches leaning to the water, the artist \"cuts off the tops of the trees with a frame, as if bringing the whole image closer to the viewer\". In addition, in the gap on the left, the continuation of the park is outlined, considerably distant in perspective from the coastal trees. The biggest part of the painting, including the surface of the water and vegetation, is painted using various shades of green color. The mirror surface of the pond is studded with islets of the white waterlily.\nA small piece of blue sky with clouds can be seen in the upper left corner of the painting. Its light reflection on the water surface is in the lower part, near the left edge of the canvas. The bridges and the paths approaching them are also depicted in light colors. Due to this, the viewer's eye is directed into the depths, where a young woman in a light-colored dress sits on a bench, whose figure is almost \"dissolved\" in the landscape. Her pensive appearance is in harmony with the surrounding nature, staying in a \"state of inner immersion\". Vera Dmitrievna Khrushchova (1844–1881, there is also the spelling \"Khrushcheva\"), a twin sister of the artist, served as the model for the figure of a seated woman.\n\n\n== Etudes and repetitions ==\n\nSeveral sketches for the painting \"Overgrown Pond\" were painted by Polenov in 1877, when he was visiting his parents in the village of Petrushki near Kiyv.\nPolenov also painted a smaller version of the canvas \"Overgrown Pond\" (1880, canvas, oil, 44 × 64.5 cm, State Russian Museum, inventory No. Ж-4212), which depicts the figure of a standing woman. The model for it, as well as for the large canvas, was Vera Khrushchova. This version, previously a part of the collection of V. I. Dvorishchin, arrived to the State Russian Museum in 1946 through the Leningrad State Purchase Commission.\nAnother version of the painting \"Overgrown Pond\" (canvas, oil, 30 × 58 cm, Inventory No. Ж-293) is kept in the Odesa Fine Arts Museum. According to one experts, it is an author's repetition, according to others — a study.\nAnother author's repetition of the painting \"Overgrown Pond\" is kept in a private collection. In addition, it is known about the existence of a variant called \"Overgrown Pond\" (1880) from the collection of the Moscow collector A. M. Koludarov, which was exhibited during the personal exhibition of Polenov in 1950 in Moscow.\n\n\n== Reviews ==\nArt historian Olga Lyaskovskaya wrote that when working on the painting \"Overgrown Pond\" Polenov \"strove for a balanced composition, for the overall impression of pictorialism\". According to her, the artist \"peculiarly and truthfully\" conveyed the texture of grass and leaves, as well as beautifully summarized \"shrouded in fog distant clumps of trees and a corner of the blue sky with a cloud, reflected in the water\".\n\nIn a monograph on Polenov's work, art historian Tamara Yurova wrote that the painting of \"Overgrown Pond\", almost entirely based on gradations of green color, \"reveals Polenov's high skill as a colorist\", and \"the finely developed green scale in shades is characterized by exceptional beauty and richness of nuance\". This creates the impression that \"no two tones in the landscape are exactly the same\", and there is also no \"somewhat neutral paint, which solidly covered individual pieces of canvas in \"Moscow Courtyard\".\" According to Yurova, the painting \"Overgrown Pond\" \"completed a certain stage of Polenov's work, marked the onset of creative maturity\".\n\nAccording to art historian Aleksei Fedorov-Davydov, in the painting \"Overgrown Pond\" Polenov managed \"with the greatest force and picturesque beauty\" to express \"the real, but laden with a kind of romanticism poetry of nature\". According to him, \"for all the intimacy of the motif,\" Polenovsky landscape turned out not at all  chamber, but on the contrary, elevated and especially significant \"in its synthetic generalization of the image\". Fyodorov-Davydov noted that \"both the well-known soundness of the colors, and the strict planning, and, finally, the moment of romanticism, which is perceptible in this landscape\", allow us to speak of its \"kinship\" to the landscapes of Fyodor Vasilyev.\nAccording to art historian Eleanora Paston, painted in the late 1870s Polenovsky paintings \"Moscow Courtyard\", \"Grandmother's Garden\" and \"Overgrown Pond\" constitute \"a kind of lyrical and philosophical trilogy of the artist\". In a monograph on the work of the artist, she noted that in the landscape \"Overgrown Pond\" \"in the depiction of the old park, solemn in its monumental grandeur, prevails sublimely dreamy mood,\" which is \"emphasized by the fragile motionless and pensive figure of a woman standing alone against the background of dark trees, spreading a mighty tent and as if serving as a safe haven for her.\" Paston wrote that \"the theme of withdrawal from the hardships of reality into the world of nature,\" begun by Polenov in this painting, later developed in his works of the 1880s and 1890s, as well as in the work of one of Polenov's young friends Mikhail Nesterov.\n\n\n== See also ==\nVasily Polenov\nPeredvizhniki\nTretyakov Gallery\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nАтрощенко, О.Д.; Бодунова, В.

        "content": "Fourth Down and Love is an American romantic comedy sports TV film that premiered September 9, 2023, on the Hallmark Channel. Directed by Allan Harmon, the film stars Pascale Hutton and Ryan Paevey. The film was originally broadcast as part of the Hallmark Channel's \"Fall Into Love\" seasonal programming.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nMike Hanson (Ryan Paevey) is a player on the professional football team The Whalers, but when he gets seriously injured for the second time in the season, he is forced to go onto the injured reserve. While nursing his broken ribs, Mike returns to his hometown to stay at his brother's (Dan Payne) house. During this time, Mike is convinced to help coach his niece's (Piper Scott) all-girl flag football team.\nSingle mother Erin Allen (Pascale Hutton) is a real estate agent whose 12-year-old daughter Kiera (Sophia Powers) also plays in the flag football league. One day while sharing the field with another team during practice, Kiera notices the all-girl flag football team and asks her mother to let her join it and she agrees. When Erin goes over to ask the coach to let her daughter join, she realizes that Mike, her ex-boyfriend from college that she broke up with, is the one coaching the all-girl team. As Erin and Mike begin to spend time together again, their romantic past begins to resurface.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nPascale Hutton as Erin Allen\nRyan Paevey as Mike Hanson\nSophia Powers as Keira Allen\nDan Payne as Jimmy Hanson\nSteve Bacic as Richard\nHeather Doerksen as Danielle Hanson\nKalyn Miles as Georgina\nDarlene Tait as Gertie Hanson\nFred Henderson as Gus\nPiper Scott as Zoey Hanson\nIan Ronningen as Bucks Flag Coach\nDarby Steeves as Kristina\nCole Fairbank as Lucas\nAaron Joseph as Referee\nGemma Martini as Whaler Team Doctor\nDavid Stuart as Whaler General Manager\nKimberley Sustad as Sideline Reporter\nBenjamin Wilkinson as Announcer\nAdil Zaidi as Commentator\n\n\n== Production ==\nPrincipal photography took place entirely in Vancouver between May and June of 2023. The football stadium used in the film was the McLeod Athletic Park in the Township of Langley.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nFourth Down and Love debuted on the Hallmark Channel to 1.58 million viewers.\nSouthern Living presented the film as follows: \"In addition to the rekindled romance, Mike bonds with the young women on the team and teaches them how to gain more confidence on and off the field.\" Decider compared the film with other productions, \"There’s a lot of Hallmark’s Hearts in the Game here, especially the fact that the leads start as exes rather than strangers. If the movie focused more on the kids and Coach Mike, the pro-coaches-kids storyline could feel more Mighty Ducks-ish\" and wrote that the film offered \"no real surprises plot-wise and pretty much adheres to every trope you expect from both a Hallmark romance and a kid-centric sports movie.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFourth Down and Love at Hallmark Media International\nFourth Down and Love at IMDb",

        "content": "Charles Peters (1695–1746) was an English physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nPeters was the son of John Peters of London. He was born in 1695. He matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford on 31 March 1710, graduated B.A. in 1713 and M.A. not till 1724. Dr. Richard Mead encouraged him to study medicine, and lent him a copy of the rare editio princeps, printed at Verona in 1530, of that Latin poem of Hieronymus Fracastorius entitled ‘Syphilis,’ which has provided a scientific name for a long series of pathological phenomena. Peters published an edition of ‘Syphilis sive Morbus Gallicus’ in 1720. It is a quarto finely printed by Jonah Bowyer at the Rose in St. Paul's Churchyard, and has a portrait of Frascatorius engraved by Vertue for frontispiece. The contents of the dedication to Mead indicate that the mind of the editor was more occupied with literary than with scientific questions, for the only allusion he makes to the contents of the poem is to offer emendations of three lines (bk. ii. ver. 199 and 428 and bk. iii. ver. 41). He is said to have graduated M.D. at Leyden in 1724, but his name does not appear in Peacock's ‘Index.’ He was elected a Radcliffe travelling fellow on 12 July 1725, and graduated M.B. and M.D. at Oxford, on 8 Nov. 1732. In 1733 he was appointed physician-extraordinary to the king, and was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of London on 16 April 1739, in which year he was also appointed physician-general to the army. He was physician to St. George's Hospital from April 1735 to February 1746, and was a censor in the College of Physicians in 1744; but illness prevented him from serving his full period. He published in the ‘Philosophical Transactions’ (vol. xliii.) in 1744–5, ‘The Case of a Person bit by a Mad Dog,’ a paper on hydrophobia, in which he expresses a favourable opinion as to the usefulness of warm baths in that disease. He died in 1746. There are two letters in his hand to Sir Hans Sloane in the British Museum referring to his fellowship.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Moore, Norman (1896). \"Peters, Charles (1695-1746)\".

        "content": "The McGill Fight Band (also known simply as Fight Band), is the pep band for the McGill University Redbirds and Martlets in Montréal, Québec, Canada. The band performs and cheers at one or more athletic events each week. In fall semesters, these include rugby, soccer and Redbirds football games. In winter semesters, these include basketball, Martlets volleyball and Martlets hockey games. Fight Band performs at every McGill Redbirds hockey home game at McConnell Arena in both semesters.\nOther performances include McGill Open Air Pub, Blues Pub, Gerts Student Bar, McGill Relay for Life and other campus events. The band also organizes several social events each year.\nThe band comprises brass, percussion, and woodwind instruments played by students from varying faculties on campus, and is led by a president and executive as well as a brigade leader who is also responsible for \"creat[ing] an extremely hostile environment for enemy schools to play\" by starting cheers at games. The band is open to anyone without audition, and regardless of skill level. Fight Band rehearses on Tuesdays in the McGill Gym complex.\n\n\n== History ==\nFight Band was founded in 2006 by Ted Smith with a group of friends at Bar des Pins, Inspired by Japanese Ōendan. The band originally had less than 12 members and practiced in an office building on Sherbrooke Street. Members were allowed to drink during games, which gave the band its rowdy reputation and led to the creation of the \"root beer magic\" drink mix. In response, McGill Athletics formalized an agreement with the band that provided funding and banned drinking at games. In the following years, the band grew to over 30 members from a variety of faculties, while expanding its repertoire and maintaining its spirit and \"edge.\"\n\n\n== Composition ==\n\n\n=== Instrumentation ===\nThe band consists of members from various faculties at the undergraduate and graduate levels at any of the McGill University campuses who play woodwind, brass and percussion instruments. The instrumentation includes both marching band and concert band instruments.\n\n\n=== Executive team ===\nFight Band is organized by an executive team of elected band members. Fight Band's executive positions are president, vice-presidents administrative, finance, internal, external, alumni and ultra. Each year, a brigade leader is appointed to lead cheers. The band is overseen by McGill Athletics and Recreation.\n\n\n=== Sudbury Saturday Nights ===\nWhile Fight Band plays at Friday night hockey games, the \"Sudbury Saturday Nights\" band (SSN) performs at all other Redbirds hockey games. The band is named after the Stompin' Tom Connors song of the same name. SSN is organized by Fight Band's VP Ultra. SSN is connected to Fight Band but it is directly affiliated with the Redbirds hockey team instead of with McGill Athletics.\n\n\n== Performance ==\n\n\n=== Performance style ===\nFight Band is known for their rowdy and boisterous performance style. The band will often chirp the opposing team's players during the game and lead cheers to support McGill. Band members stand in the bleachers while they play. The conductor or brigade leader pick songs that match the energy of the game. Popular songs include Hey! Baby!, Bad Romance, and Sweet Caroline.\n\n\n=== Hockey games ===\nFight Band plays at every stoppage of play at hockey games instead of a DJ. Rather than playing a song through, the band plays a short section between the referee's whistle signalling a stoppage and the next puck-drop.\nFight Band occasionally plays at Redbirds away games, particularly the annual Corey Cup game against the Concordia Stingers at Ed Meagher Arena. The band also travels to support the Redbirds at the U Sports national championship when they qualify.\n\n\n=== Notable performances ===\n2012 Rick Mercer Report\n2017 U Sports University Cup in Fredericton, NB\n2018 U Sports University Cup in Fredericton, NB\n2024 U Sports University Cup in Toronto, ON\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 1996 Summer Paralympics torch relay, also referred to as the NationsBank Paralympic Torch Relay to reflect the event's lead sponsor, was held between August 5 and August 15, leading up to the 1996 Summer Paralympics in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. It was the first Paralympic torch relay held in the United States, beginning at the King Center in Atlanta, then being run from Washington, D.C., back to Atlanta.\nUnlike the 1996 Summer Olympics torch relay, which had been conveyed part of the way by motor vehicles and trains, organizers described the Paralympic torch as being moved by \"people power only\". This included runners on foot and in wheelchairs, cyclists, as well as horseback riders, water-skiiers, kayakers, and a rider on a specialized lawn mower.\n\n\n== Relay ==\n\nThe relay began in Atlanta on the morning of August 5. The flame was received from the eternal flame at the tomb of Martin Luther King Jr. at the King Center for Nonviolent Social Change. King's son Dexter Scott King lit a torch from the eternal flame, then passed it to Atlanta Paralympic Committee president Andrew Fleming.\nThe flame was then flown to Washington, D.C., for a ceremony at the White House on the morning of August 6, where President Bill Clinton spoke before the lighting of the first torch. The flame was then run down the National Mall to the United States Capitol and the Lincoln Memorial before crossing out of the District to Arlington National Cemetery.\nProceeding southward from Washington, the torch passed through Woodbridge, Virginia and ended its first day in Richmond. On August 7, the flame was carried from Richmond to South Boston.\n\nCrossing into North Carolina, the torch stopped for a mid-day celebration in Durham before leaving for Burlington and spending the night of August 8 in Greensboro. The next day, the relay passed through Kernersville on its way to a morning celebration in Winston-Salem, then traveled through Clemmons, Cooleemee, Mooresville, Davidson, Cornelius, and Huntersville before stopping for the evening in Charlotte. Charlotte mayor Pat McCrory was among those who carried the torch in the city.\n\nOn August 10, the flame left Charlotte, passing through Belmont, Gastonia, and Kings Mountain before leaving the state at Grover. In South Carolina, the torch was carried through Blacksburg, Gaffney, and Cowpens on its way to a mid-day celebration in Spartanburg.\nThe torch was originally scheduled to stop in Greenville, South Carolina, on the evening of August 10. However, this plan was canceled after the Greenville County Council passed a resolution condemning homosexuality. The Olympic torch relay had similarly shunned Greenville after the resolution was passed, driving the flame through the county, shielded from view, before entering and after leaving Greenville city limits. The Paralympic torch relay organizers went further, bypassing Greenville entirely by traveling southward from Spartanburg to Switzer, Enoree, and Laurens, before turning west toward Hickory Tavern, Princeton, Honea Path, and Belton, and stopping for the day in Anderson. This made August 10 by far the longest day of the relay in terms of distance traveled, with a total length of 147 miles.\n\nOn August 11, the flame returned to Georgia, with a handover ceremony planned in the middle of Lake Hartwell. Catherine Fletcher, a paraplegic kayaker, was to pass the torch to fellow kayaker Will Carlton two miles from the shore. However, while she was attempting to hand it over, Fletcher's kayak capsized. Fletcher came up unharmed, but the torch was extinguished and lost at the bottom of the lake. A backup flame was passed to Carlton and the relay continued, passing through the towns of Hartwell, Hull, and Colbert before ending the day in Athens.\nThe relay route on August 12 traveled through Watkinsville, Madison, Monticello, and Gray on its way to Macon. The next day, IWWF disabled waterski champion Steve Hodges skiied with the torch across Lake Tobesofkee. The relay then passed through Yatesville, Thomaston (where quadraplegic local resident Jeff Vinings carried the torch on his custom riding lawnmower), Woodland, and Manchester. It spent the night of Warm Springs, at the newly opened Center for Therapeutic Recreation at the Roosevelt Institute, which was being used as a training facility for Paralympic athletes.\nOn August 14, the torch left Warm Springs and traveled north through Woodbury, Gay, Alvaton, Haralson, and Senoia, entering the Atlanta suburbs at Fayetteville. Local disabled residents in McDonough protested the decision to have 10 non-disabled runners and only two disabled torchbearers carry the flame through their town. From McDonough, the relay continued to Stone Mountain (stopping at City Hall and not visiting the Confederate monument for which the town is named, despite the fact that the monument park was the venue for some Paralympic events).\nThe relay's final day took the torch through Clarkston and past the DeKalb County Courthouse in Decatur. Entering the city of Atlanta, mid-day celebrations were held at Phipps Plaza and the Shepherd Spinal Center before the relay finished at Atlanta City Hall. That evening, in the opening ceremony at Centennial Olympic Stadium, the cauldron was lit by paraplegic climber Mark Wellman, who ascended a 120-foot rope with only the use of his arms, the torch attached to his legs, in order to light it.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Louise Thoron MacVeagh (1898-1987) was an American painter and illustrator who studied with Leon Bakst and was known for her painted murals.\n\n\n== Education and Career ==\nLouise Warder Thoron was born in 1898 in Lenox Massachusetts, the home of her father’s mother’s family, the Wards. Her parents were Ellen Nancy Warder (1871-1959) and Ward Thoron (whose full name was Marie-Joseph Paul Louis François Firement Samuel Ward Thoron) (1867-1938). She attended Westover School, Colorado College (1916–1919), Cooper Union (1919) and the Art Students League (1919–1923; 1925). In 1922 she studied under Leon Bakst, the Ballets Russes set designer and artist, helping him, at the invitation of her aunt Alice Warder Garrett, decorate rooms, including a Modernist private theatre, at Evergreen House, her home in Baltimore. Bakst then invited Louise to Paris to assist him in the painting of the ceiling of the Opera. She declined, and in 1923 she was married. Throughout her career, Louise made paintings, murals paintings, embroidered tablecloths, and illustrated books.\n\n\n== Book illustrations ==\nLouise provided illustrations for the Great Fables by Manuel Komroff, (Dial Press, New York, 1928), reprinted in 1936, and \"How you Began\" by Amabel Williams-Ellis (Coward, McCann, Inc. 1929).\n\n\n== Murals ==\nSometime after 1927 Louise painted a mural on West 85th street in New York at the Three Arts Club, a residence for women studying music, painting and drama. In around 1931, probably through the new Headmaster, Reverend Edric Amory Weld, the Holderness School near Plymouth, NH, commissioned Louise to paint eight murals. These murals depict winter sports and the terrain of the nearby White Mountain National Forest. In 1956 Louise was chosen to paint a mural of a riverbed with its flora and fauna, wading birds and horses, for a niche over the swimming pool at the Colony Club on 62nd street and Park Avenue.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\n\n== Art Appreciation ==\nLouise was raised in a family who appreciated and supported the arts. Her mother grew up in the Warder Mansion designed by H. H. Richardson, whose stone doorway went to the Smithsonian. On her father's side, she can trace her relatives back to the Thorons of Carcasonne, including Pierre Antoine THORON (1708-1773), Mayor of Carcassonne. Her paternal great-great-grandfather William Ward commissioned a large version of Hiram Powers's sculpture The Greek Slave, now at the National Gallery; and her grandfather, Samuel Gray Ward, who was a founder of the Metropolitan Museum, commissioned a 24-inch replica of it, which went to the Corcoran Gallery. Additionally, Louise's paternal aunt and namesake, Marie Louise Thoron (1864-1958), \"Loulou\" (Mrs. William Crowninshield Endicott Jr.) and her aunt's mother-in-law, Ellen Peabody Endicott (1833–1927), were painted by John Singer Sargent (in 1903 and 1901).\nIn addition to being an artist all her life, Louise served as Art Editor of the Junior League Magazine from 1931-1937. In 1933 she covered the Michael Friedsam collection at the Metropolitan Museum, the Worcester Museum and the International 1933 (CAA). In 1939 served on the women's committee for a benefit for the building fund of the new Church of the Epiphany (Episcopal, Manhattan) helping to organize a performance by the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo at the Metropolitan Opera\n\n\n== Marriage and children ==\nIn 1923 Louise married Ewen Cameron MacVeagh (1895–1971), son of Charles MacVeagh in the Bethlehem Chapel of Washington Cathedral. They spent their summers in Dublin, New Hampshire, where they lived at Fasnacloich built by Ewen's father. There, Louise was permitted by her mother-in-law to paint in the old cider house which became her studio. She and Ewen had three daughters and seven grandchildren.\nLouise was a member of the National Association of Women Artists and is listed in Who's Who in American Art of 1931. She did not, as a rule, sign her paintings.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Francis Penrose (1718 – 17 January 1798) was an English surgeon and medical writer.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nPenrose was born in 1718. He was a surgeon who practised for many years at Bicester in Oxfordshire. He purchased a property in the adjoining village of Chesterton, where, at the enclosure of the parish in 1767, he was the owner of a quarter of a yard of land, in lieu of which he received an allotment measuring 2 acres 3 roods 1 perch. He afterwards purchased the house and grounds now called Chesterton Lodge, which he greatly improved. The estate was sold after his death. Mr. Dunkin, the local historian, says of him in 1823 that he is chiefly remembered for his attempt to investigate the ruins of Alchester, the Roman station at the junction of two roads adjoining Chesterton. There, in a wood on the west side of the castrum, he discovered in 1766 the remains of a large building, within which were a tesselated pavement and a hypocaust. This building he described as the Prætorium. He left Bicester about 1782, and went to live in Stonehouse, Plymouth, but he did not practise his profession in Devonshire.\nHe died at Hatfield 17 Jan. 1798, in the house of his son, James Penrose (1750–1818), who was appointed surgeon-extraordinary to the king in November 1793, in succession to John Hunter. Father and son were buried in the churchyard at Hatfield, though no trace of their tombstone exists.\nPenrose was a voluminous writer of pamphlets upon scientific subjects cognate to medicine. His works do not, as a rule, repay perusal. They are: \n\n‘A Treatise on Electricity, wherein its various Phenomena are accounted for, and the Cause of Attraction and Gravitation of Solids assigned, by Francis Penrose, Surgeon at Bicester, Oxfordshire,’ Oxford, 8vo, 1752.\n‘An Essay on Magnetism, or an endeavour to explain the various properties and effects of the Loadstone, together with the causes of the same,’ Oxford, 8vo, 1753.\n‘Physical Essay on the Animal Economy, wherein the Circulation of the Blood and its causes are particularly considered with the Diseases which attend a disordered state of the Circulation,’ London, 8vo, 1754, and Oxford, 8vo, 1766. This is a poor work, in which old physiological theories are revivified.\n‘Dissertation on the Inflammatory, Gangrenous, and Putrid Sore Throat, also on the Putrid Fever, together with the diagnostics and method of cure,’ Oxford, 8vo, 1766. This is a practical treatise, in which the writer narrates cases he has himself seen in the course of his practice.\n‘Letters Philosophical and Astronomical, in which the following operations of nature are explained in the most simple and natural manner, according to Sir Isaac Newton's opinion, viz., the creation, the deluge, vegetation, the make and form of this terraqueous globe,’ &c., Plymouth, 8vo, 1789. These letters were originally written to John Heaviside, M.D., and were dated from Stonehouse in 1783. They are dedicated to Sir Joseph Banks and to the fellows of the Royal Society. The critical reviews in December 1788 say of them that ‘the Mosaic account of the creation is here explained and defended, as well as the deluge, and gravity is accounted for by hot and cold ether.’\n‘Letters on Philosophical Subjects,’ London, 8vo, 1794. This is a second edition of the previous work, with an amended title. It is dated from Stonehouse, Plymouth, 30 June 1788.\n‘Essays Physiological and Practical, founded on the modern chemistry of Lavoisier, Fourcroy, &c., with a view to the improvement of the practice of medicine,’ by Francis Penrose, M.D., London, 8vo, 1794. These essays were severely handled in the first volume of the ‘Medico-Chirurgical Review,’ the reviewer either believing, or affecting to believe, their author to be a recently qualified practitioner of medicine. In the title-page of this work he styles himself M.D. for the first time; he is supposed to have obtained the degree at some German university.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Power, D'Arcy (1895). \"Penrose, Francis\".

        "content": "Caroline Amy Hutton (1861 – October 6, 1931) was a British archaeologist known for her work on Greek terracotta figurines.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHutton was born in New Zealand to Howard Hutton and Emma Kenrick. Her mother's family were well-to-do proprietors of an iron foundry in Denbighshire. This allowed her financial independence that made possible a career path not then ordinarily open to women, though she often had to work unpaid or poorly paid. From 1879 to 1883 she studied Classics at Girton College, Cambridge University, where archaeologist Eugénie Sellers and classical scholar Katharine Jex-Blake were among fellow students who became her friends. For a time after leaving Girton she taught at Allenswood Boarding School, a school for young women.\nIn 1892 she began to lecture about Greek sculpture and history at the British Museum, where she went on to carry out her own research for many years. With the encouragement of archaeologist Alexander Stuart Murray, who headed the museum's department of Greek and Roman antiquities, Hutton undertook research and restoration work on ceramics from the ancient Egyptian city of Naukratis. This resulted in Hutton's first academic publication, \"Inscriptions on Pottery from Naukratis.\" As with subsequent publications, she used her initials for her author name, publishing as C.A. Hutton.\nIn the late 1890s, Hutton traveled to Paris and Berlin to study Greek terracotta figurines in local collections. In 1896-97 she had a scholarship to undertake similar research at the British School at Athens, only the second woman (after Sellers) to be allowed to work at the School. This research led to her 1899 book Greek Terracotta Statuettes, which focused on the British Museum collections and was the first book in English to survey the subject, covering the centuries from the Archaic to the Hellenistic periods.\nHutton continued to research and write about Greek antiquities for many years thereafter, though at a slower pace, and devoted more of her energies to editorial and administrative work. From 1906 to 1926, she served as co-editor of the Annual of the British School at Athens, working with archaeologist Cecil Harcourt Smith.\nIn addition, after joining the London-based Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies, Hutton served the society in various administrative capacities for more than two decades. Notably, she was acting librarian from 1891 to 1899 and again during World War I, keeping the Hellenic Society open despite the conflict. In 1927, she published the first article about the Hellenic Society's Wood Collection, an important archive of notebooks and other material related to a Syrian expedition undertaken by Robert Wood, James Dawkins and John Bouverie. She later spent a decade as the society's Honorary Secretary before retiring in 1930 due to poor health.\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\nGreek Terracotta Statuettes. Macmillan, 1899.\n\"Inscriptions on Pottery from Naukratis.\" The Classical Review, 1893.\n\"Votive Reliefs in the Acropolis Museum.\" The Journal of Hellenic Studies, 1897.\n\"A Collection of Sketches by C.R. Cockerell, RA.\" The Journal of Hellenic Studies, 1909.\n\"The Greek Inscriptions at Petworth House.\" Annual of the British School at Athens, 1916.\n\"The Travels of 'Palmyra' Wood in 1750-51.\" The Journal of Hellenic Studies, 1927.\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nDyson, Stephen L. \"Hutton, Caroline Amy (1861–1931)\".

        "content": "Ray Burns was a British singer, active in the 1950s, who had a top five hit single in 1955.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBurns was born of Russian ancestry as Reuben Klot in the east end of London in 1923.  During the Second World War he served in the Royal Air Force.\n\n\n== Singing career ==\nBurns entered showbusiness when a friend of the comedian Issy Bonn heard him singing in a barber shop; Bonn took Burns on as a dresser, taught him singing techniques, and had him perform a song during his stage shows. Burns' career took a step forward in 1949, when the orchestra leader Ambrose heard him sing at a London club and offered him a job.\nBurns was a regular singer with the BBC Show Band, under the leadership of Cyril Stapleton, in the 1950s, and recorded a number of singles for Columbia Records between 1953 and 1958, two of which made any of the UK singles charts.  The bigger hit, a cover of the Bob Holt/David Wells song \"Mobile\" (with the Eric Jupp Orchestra), which had been a hit in the United States for Julius La Rosa, reached number 4 in both the New Musical Express and Record Mirror charts in March 1955.  The second, \"That's How A Love Song Was Born\" (with The Coronets), reached number 14 of the NME charts later in the year; at the time Record Mirror only had a top 10 chart, expanding to a top 20 in October 1955, just as the single dropped out of the NME top 20. \nBurns' career turned to cabaret and smaller scale performances as the musical scene changed, but he made one final television appearance on Barrymore in the 1990s.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nBurns and his wife Tilly had two children, Larry and Gillian.  Gillian performed with her father in a double act in the 1970s, and won an episode of New Faces in 1977.  \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Painting in Rio Grande do Sul, as an independent art, developed at the end of the 19th century. It originated in the port cities of Porto Alegre, Pelotas and Rio Grande. The first evidence of pictorial art in Rio Grande do Sul appeared as decoration for religious temples, public buildings and palaces.\nUntil the beginning of the 19th century, Rio Grande do Sul was an area still in the process of settlement with ill-defined borders and an incipient culture. The most significant cultural episode occurred between the 17th and 18th centuries during the Jesuit Missions in the northwest of the state, at the time under Spanish possession. The different political and military turbulences throughout the 18th and 19th centuries hindered the locals from having enough time, resources and educational bases to develop their culture.\nIn the 1920s, modernism began to spread, clashing with academic tradition and conservative cultural sectors, and triggering a public controversy that lasted until the 1950s. At the same time, especially through the actions of the Institute of Fine Arts, painting as an autonomous artistic genre  become established and prestigious. The market developed, researchers and critics multiplied, updates from abroad were increasingly incorporated and an original character for southern production emerged for the first time. Between the 1960s and 1970s, painting in Rio Grande do Sul entered a crisis. New aesthetics emerged, such as pop art and the new figuration. Other avant-gardes that questioned the primacy of painting and the concept of a work of art also appeared. They focused on the idea, the creative process and the hybridization of different techniques and materials used in unusual combinations.\nIn the 1980s, painting in Rio Grande do Sul made a significant comeback, revisiting the past critically while globalizing and consecrating plurality as the typical current language. By the end of the 20th century, it had become a national reference, following national and international trends. At the same time, important artists remained unmoved by the appeals of regionalism and focused on the mythical figure of the gaucho and on historical scenes and characters. Rio Grande do Sul developed a vast and richly diversified collection of paintings, a public to appreciate them and a large group of institutions capable of studying, preserving and exhibiting them. Porto Alegre remains the most important center, while amateur painting flourishes in the countryside. There is a large bibliography on specific aspects of painting in Rio Grande do Sul, but general studies are still lacking.\n\n\n== Beginning and first stage ==\n\nUntil the beginning of the 19th century, Rio Grande do Sul's history was characterized by militarism. The territory was controlled by Spain and the government's main concern was to stabilize and defend the borders. Until 1821, the most remarkable cultural event in the area was sponsored by Spanish Jesuits, who founded several missions in the central-northwestern region in the 17th century to acculturate indigenous people, which favored the creation of a hybrid culture guided by the missionaries. In Porto Alegre, there were few conditions for art to prosper, a situation that remained unchanged until the Ragamuffin War, a military incident that lasted from 1835 to 1845. The first notices about painting date back to the late 18th century and mention artisanal painters who left mural decorations in churches, although their names have not been kept.\nIn the middle of the 19th century, traveling artists began to arrive. They were the first to contribute to the painting of Rio Grande do Sul. The most notable were João de Deus, from São Paulo, the first famous set designer to work in the state; Alphonse Falcoz, a Frenchman who graduated from the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts; Manoel José Gentil, from Bahia; Eduardo Timoleon Zalony, who was active in Rio Grande and Porto Alegre, and introduced the technique of painting on glass; Jean-Baptiste Debret, a member of the French Mission, and Herrmann Wendroth, a German mercenary.\nAt the time, many people interested in art had established in Pelotas and Porto Alegre, including Guilherme Litran and Frederico Trebbi. They laid the foundations for education and the formation of a small market, and trained several disciples who would continue their legacy. However, the scene was mainly dominated by amateurism until the 1890s. The situation began to change with the work of Antônio Cândido de Menezes, the first successful painter born in the state. He graduated from the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts and worked extensively in Porto Alegre as an artist and teacher.\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, Rio Grande do Sul's economy was reasonably structured and society began to express varied interests in art, including theatrical performances, classical music, opera and literary soirees. The large influx of European immigrants provided the cultural elements to spark the first significant movements in painting, although it occurred almost exclusively in Porto Alegre. A bourgeoisie with purchasing power, who could afford to buy art and decorate their homes with murals, began to emerge. The creation of the Sociedade Partenon Literário, formed by the intellectual community of Rio Grande do Sul, and the first art salon in 1875, included in the Exposição Comercial e Industrial, where Grasselli, Menezes and Theodor Bischoff exhibited, were important. In 1883, the idea of creating a school of arts in Porto Alegre based on the European academies was proposed by set designer Oreste Coliva, but it failed.\nThe first generation of female painting teachers, including Edilia Azarini, Margarida Ahrons and Dorothea Alruz, emerged. At the time, women represented the majority of practitioners, whose participation in the salons was acclaimed and production approached the decorative arts and domestic gifts. A more erudite group includes the important series of official portraits of benefactors of the Beneficência Portuguesa and Santa Casa de Misericórdia. Smaller, isolated, semi-amateur figures such as Pietro Stangherlin and Antônio Cremonese also practiced painting in Caxias do Sul and Farroupilha.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Creation of an identity ==\n\nFrom the end of the 19th century, native painters emerged, such as Augusto Luiz de Freitas, author of monumental canvases, and Pedro Weingärtner, the greatest figure of the first generation of painters from Rio Grande do Sul. Weingärtner trained in Europe and developed an internationally renowned career until the 1920s. He worked on a wide variety of themes, such as genre scenes, mythological scenes, landscapes and regionalist scenes. Weingärtner and Freitas pursued the traditions of great academic painting, combining neoclassical, realist and romantic references.Positivism also influenced the arts in Rio Grande do Sul by pursuing progress and democracy in order to achieve a significant and peaceful social life. The arts were valued as an instrument of social education, but the system was precarious. There were no art museums or structured academies; in 1893 the first gallery in Porto Alegre opened as a separate room in the Ao Preço Fixo bazaar. Despite the limited support structure and the small market, the press regularly reported the novelties in painting. At the time, Porto Alegre counted hundreds of painters, both professional and amateur. Many offered classes and private schools provided an introduction to the basic techniques of painting and drawing, while decorative mural painting in homes and public buildings became fashionable. Painting became known and appreciated. Dozens of painters, many from the countryside, participated in the 1901 exhibition in Porto Alegre.\nThe next generation of artists was born in the 1800s, but their work flourished in the first decades of the following century. Oscar Boeira, Afonso Silva, Libindo Ferrás and João Fahrion joined the group. Foreign artists such as Eugenio Latour, Francis Pelichek and Luiz Maristany de Trias also made significant contributions. Leopoldo Gotuzzo exhibited in Porto Alegre but pursued most of his career in Rio de Janeiro. Their distinctive feature was their ability to assimilate important lessons from impressionism, evident especially in the work of Boeira and Maristany. They eased the academic rigor in drawing and the organization of space, using the stain as an expressive resource and showing a new sensitivity to the effects of light, which prepared the way for the more radical innovations of the moderns.\nIn 1903, the first event entirely dedicated to the plastic arts, promoted by Gazeta do Commercio and featuring Weingärtner, Romualdo Prati, Francesco Manna, Augusto de Freitas and Libindo Ferrás, occurred. According to Damasceno, it was \"the first event to grant the arts of Rio Grande do Sul an autonomous status, [...] legitimizing them as an object of social approval and distinction\".\n\n\n=== Institute of Fine Arts ===\n\nIn 1908, the prestige of the plastic arts among official and cultural elite circles led to the foundation of the Free Institute of Fine Arts, later the Institute of Fine Arts (IBA), predecessor of the current Institute of Arts at UFRGS, which concentrated the production of erudite art in Porto Alegre and was the most significant institutional reference in Rio Grande do Sul until the mid-1950s regarding the study, teaching and production of painting. For a long time, the place remained the stronghold of academicism due to the connection with the government and the conservative elite. Researcher Círio Simon, who compiled the history of the institution, stated that \"it was created by art amateurs as the culmination of the civilizing project formed by the free higher education schools that were the origin of the first university in the region\", but soon professionals joined in and \"assumed their role as agents, beginning to express the autonomy of art, taking advantage of their institutional place\".\nDespite the promotional role played by the IBA, prejudice against professional artists remained strong. The classes were seen as leisure or social adornment by society. Although the Painting program had been planned since the IBA's creation, it was approved in 1926. The institution's orientation applied criteria derived from the traditional 19th century schools and the connection with the state government remained intact. Libindo and Pelichek taught painting at the institute until the 1930s, including special guests such as Weingärtner, Boeira and Torelly.\n\n\n== Modernism ==\n\n\n=== Beginning ===\n\nThe relative isolation and peculiar characteristics of Rio Grande do Sul's economy and cultural background created the conditions for the renewal of modernism to proceed in a different way. In the state, the synthesis between 19th century academic schools and positivist ideological painting was considered the most modern art, while the schools of the international avant-garde, such as expressionism and cubism, were gradually introduced through the illustrations published in magazines such as Máscara, Revista do Globo and Revista Kodak. The graphic arts were a good alternative market for the more inquisitive painters of the time. Photography also contributed to the development of a new approach to painting, as reflected in Weingärtner and other portrait painters who were active at the time.\nOther signs of modernization emerged through the influence of João Fahrion, who had returned from training in Europe, where he frequented the avant-garde and became a respected illustrator and teacher. Helios Seelinger's presence in Porto Alegre also gathered a group of artists, leading to the conception of the 1924 Autumn Salon, which would publicly open the debate between tradition and modernity and establish a local link with the renewal movements occurring in Brazil's central region. Weingärtner's last exhibition happened in 1925, but despite being well received by the press, the reviews mentioned the overall changes. The number of visitors was low and the show closed early without many sales. The painted stained glass windows produced by Casa Genta and Casa Veit  became popular and were used in banks, town halls, homes, schools and churches. The field, as well as traditional sacred painting, is still little studied.\nOfficial institutions and the general public opposed the bolder and more challenging manifestations of the modern era. The society of Rio Grande do Sul developed on an agricultural model, maintained mainly by landowners who had no interest in changing the situation. Commerce and industry were beginning to become economically important forces, but their principles were equally conservative. Modernism delayed establishing a presence in Rio Grande do Sul and only became a dominant force decades later. Encouraged by the Rio-grandense Republican Party and expressed in literature and the plastic arts, a local mythology began to be formulated about the figure of the gaucho, an artificially constructed stereotype that synthesized the local ethnic differences and generated a cultural cohesion capable of driving the state forward politically on the national scene. A symbol of identity, freedom, courage and virility, the gaucho, who is also a typical representative of conservatism, founded a symbolic identity that still has wide popular appeal and defines many public actions.\n\nIn 1936, when Libindo Ferrás moved to Rio de Janeiro, the Institute of Fine Arts was incorporated into the University of Porto Alegre. In 1939, the curriculum was expanded and reformed, and João Fahrion, José Lutzenberger, Luiz Maristany de Trias became professors. In the same year, a salon was organized with the participation of national artists, especially teachers from the National School of Fine Arts, which promoted the dissemination of local art in the center of Brazil. Another incentive emerged with the founding of the Associação Riograndense de Artes Plásticas Francisco Lisboa in 1938, formed mainly by artists who were dissatisfied with the established art system. They also created an annual salon of great tradition, whose partners were Carlos Scliar, Guido Mondin and Carlos Alberto Petrucci. Exhibitions were proliferating in the city, despite still being held in stores and banks.\nThroughout the 1930s and 1940s, painting of Rio Grande do Sul gained credibility and the consumer market grew. There was also an intensification of the theoretical-ideological debate between the supporters of modernism and those who defended the traditional schools. Art criticism, still incipient and relatively amateurish, despite praising the innovative spirit of the modernists, still adhered to humanist criteria inherited from the 19th century based on supposedly perennial values in art and regional symbolism. Ângelo Guido and Aldo Obino, two of the most important art critics of the time, heavily attacked the modernists, basing their opinions on the alleged negative moral effects that art had on the public. For them, modernist art was subversive, deformed, superficial, unpleasant and disseminated values that threatened the established social order, while academism was seen as a style that provided aesthetic pleasure due to the fidelity to ideal models of perfection and plastically represented a peaceful and harmonious social model. In 1942, some members of the Associação Francisco Lisboa signed an anti-modernist manifesto, accusing the moderns of being a destructive influence on society and local traditions, due to their alleged affiliation with socialism and their lack of ethical and Christian values. They created the Modern Fine Arts Salon to mark their protest, which was organized to ridicule modern art.\nA more consistent defense of modernism came from Manoelito de Ornellas, who had participated in the Verde-Amarelo Group, and organized the Newcomers' Salon in 1944, through the State Department of Press and Propaganda, with the aim of stimulating avant-garde research. At the same time, Scliar, one of the most active proponents of aesthetic renewal, along with Manoel Martins, stood out with the first works with a social background. Other artists active at this time were Benito Castañeda, João Faria Vianna, Edgar Koetz and Gastão Hofstetter; the last two were linked to the illustration workshop of Revista do Globo, where Ernest Zeuner was a key figure, creating an important school of graphic artists.\n\n\n=== Consolidation ===\n\nIn the 1950s, Porto Alegre consolidated its leadership of the state in artistic matters. Society had more access to education and information, IBA renewed the teaching staff and artists received more respect. In Pelotas, the School of Fine Arts was founded, the salons expanded, the first important galleries appeared, abstract painting experiments began with Paulo Flores and Glauco Rodrigues, and two new presences had a major impact on the art scene: Ado Malagoli and Aldo Locatelli. In 1954, the Rio Grande do Sul Museum of Art (MARGS) was created.\n\nMalagoli came from São Paulo to teach at the IBA and took over as head of the Culture Division of the State Education Department, where he guided the state's public art education, and as head of the Museum of Art. At MARGS, he acquired the first group of paintings for the museum's collection using state funds. His approach was progressive and the first art exhibitions promoted by the museum favored modern art. He invited painters such as Portinari, Frank Schaeffer, Di Cavalcanti, Manabu Mabe and Tikashi Fukushima. As a teacher, he assembled a team of talented painters known as the Núcleo Malagoli, whose influence lasted until the 1970s, especially on Rubens Cabral, Alice Soares, Alice Brueggemann, Joel Amaral, Regina Silveira, Fabrício Marques Soares, Iná Fantoni, Paulo Porcella, Suelly Kelling, Nelson Wiegert, Maria Lídia Magliani and Marilene Pieta.\nLocatelli brought from Italy the muralist tradition derived from Michelangelo, also influenced by Piero della Francesca and the Italian Futurists, such as Umberto Boccioni. He also taught at the IBA, where he tried to develop in his students an appreciation for idealistic art with a social function. He created works such as the sacred decoration of the Church of San Pelegrino in Caxias do Sul, the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Conception in Santa Maria and the regionalist panels in the Piratini Palace. He and Emilio Sessa, his collaborator, were great exponents of mural and religious painting in the state, genres rarely practiced in Brazil.\nIn the 1950s, there was an affirmation of regionalism, which had national repercussions through the graphic arts, the activities of the Bagé Group and the Bagé and Porto Alegre engraving clubs. Danúbio Gonçalves, Plínio Bernhardt, Glênio Bianchetti and Glauco Rodrigues were printmakers and painters who called their painting \"terrorist, absurd and without technique\", typifying the more experimental modernism. The group's activity influenced others such as Carlos Alberto Petrucci, as well as contributing to greater general acceptance of modernist principles.\n\nAt the end of the 1950s, with modernism established and without opposition from the IBA, which had been the academic stronghold, official efforts turned to the goal of bringing Rio Grande do Sul up to national standards, such as São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. In 1958, a Brazilian Arts Congress was held with the participation of Pietro Maria Bardi, Quirino Campofiorito, Mário Pedrosa, Sérgio Milliet to debate a variety of topics. There was also the Pan-American Salon, whose aim was to emulate the São Paulo International Art Biennial. However, the local possibilities were overestimated and the project didn't continue. Other artists emerging during this period were Geraldo Trindade Leal, Vitorio Gheno, Yeddo Titze, Sobragil, Edy Carollo and José de Francesco. Neiva Bohns summarized the conditions of Rio Grande do Sul art at the end of the 1950s as follows: In the 1950s, the most diverse tendencies came together, not always peacefully, in the same territory, and in the same period of time: artists and teachers with a classical-academic background were still active, while modernists from different factions were settling in more and more solidly. Contesting both, and displeasing everyone, more radical manifestations began to emerge that would lead, a short time later, to the dissolution of the boundaries between artistic languages and the contestation of the institutions that consecrated art and artists. In other words, when Rio Grande do Sul was finally able to boast of having an \"art system\" in the process of consolidation, made up of schools, museums, galleries, critics and a buying public, the art that was being produced was already fundamentally contesting the validity of these institutions. \n\n\n=== Other centers ===\nIn 1922, Santa Maria created a School of Arts and Crafts, where Frederico Lobe and Salvatore Parlagreco taught. In 1963, the University of Santa Maria launched the Faculty of Fine Arts, attracting students from all over the region. Eduardo Trevisan, besides being a painter, was one of the founders of the Municipal Institute of Culture.\nSince 1949, Pelotas had an active School of Fine Arts supported by Locatelli and Emilio Sessa, which was later annexed to the University of Pelotas. In 1967, the University of Caxias do Sul incorporated the painting course offered for some years by the City Hall. Locatelli made an impression in Caxias do Sul when he created several billboards in the city. These centers showed conservative tendencies and catered to a small audience, but they were already the basis of regional centers for the teaching, production and consumption of art. The other cities in the state offered little in this field; their most promising talents, such as Glauco Pinto de Moraes, from Passo Fundo, and Iberê Camargo, from Restinga Seca, sought education and training in Porto Alegre.\n\n\n== Decline of modernism and new avant-gardes ==\n\nThe 1960s witnessed the real modernization of painting in Rio Grande do Sul and the beginning of individualization and the affirmation of specific characteristics. According to Marilene Pieta, overcoming the inconsistency of previous research and the continuous oscillation between progressive and outdated formal models, the avant-garde, previously marginalized, \"forces social endorsement and awaits the new artistic status that will allow its aesthetic project to be permeated and absorbed by society.\"\nIn 1961, Iberê began a cycle of lectures and painting classes at the Porto Alegre City Hall's Atelier Livre, commercial galleries sprang up and abstractionism gained popularity with Flores, Iberê, Titze, Rodrigues, Petrucci, Ênio Lippmann and Suelly Kelling. Despite official funding, the institutions were still lacking in many aspects. The tensions between tradition and modernity had not settled completely and limited the expansion and self-sustainability of the market, which was small and restricted almost exclusively to Porto Alegre.\nThe 1960s and 1970s witnessed an upsurge in cultural movement, especially in Porto Alegre, the main center of progress and debate. New aesthetics, such as conceptual art, concretism, pop art and new figuration, emerged in the state during international conflicts. New artists appeared, such as Leo Fuhro, Jader Siqueira, Léo Dexheimer, Carlos Carrion de Britto Velho, Antônio Soriano, Paulo Peres, Clara Pechansky, Nelson Jungbluth, Cláudio Carriconde and Waldeny Elias. Pedro Escosteguy is also notable for being the pioneer of Brazilian conceptual art, although he worked for most of his career in the center of Brazil.\nThe new aesthetics gave additional impetus to research into new plastic forms and languages and new means of expression. Following the international movement, hybrid works incorporating techniques, procedures and materials alien to traditional painting appeared. The subject matter diversifies and begins to address problems of the big city and politics; the human body is often portrayed in ways that are not flattering or ideal and becomes a support for painting, and the whole system of education, production, signification and circulation of art is questioned. During this period, an interest in the process developed to the detriment of the product. These aspects were further developed by artists linked to the KVHR Group, the Nervo Óptico Group and Espaço N.O. at the end of the 1970s, who ventured into radical innovation.\n\nDespite the emergence of new horizons regarding research after the military regime was established in 1964, artists perceive a regression in other areas. A major achievement was the consolidation of Atelier Livre as an alternative space for the creation and study of painting and other arts. Originating from lectures given by Iberê Camargo in 1961, it began its activities as a painting studio at the top of the Public Market, but in 1978 it was installed in new, spacious and equipped premises. It was a free and very democratic space of intense activity with workshops, theaters and courses for various artistic techniques that served as a school for many prominent names and as an alternative to the official education, with more restricted access, offered by the Institute of Arts at UFRGS. Ana Alegria, Regina Ohlweiler, Fernando Baril, Paulo Porcella, Danúbio Gonçalves, Henrique Fuhro, Vera Wildner and Britto Velho, all important names in Rio Grande do Sul painting, studied there.\nIn the 1970s, the Visual Arts Salon of the Institute of Arts at UFRGS was created, where abstraction gained official recognition. The creation of the Ernesto Frederico Scheffel Foundation in Novo Hamburgo, which houses the large collection of Ernesto Frederico Scheffel, is a unique case in the state. Naïve painters such as Paulina Eizirik, Otaciano Arantes, Maria di Gesù, Carlos Alberto Oliveira and Olegário Triunfo also appeared, while Carlos Mancuso and Nathanael Guimarães made their mark as watercolorists.\n\n\n== Postmodernism ==\n\nThe conceptual and practical controversy between the avant-garde and the academics, which began in the 1920s and 1930s with the introduction of modernism and was exacerbated by the political, social and aesthetic transformations of the 1950s and 1970s, continued into the 1980s. The most interesting development was the change in the objectives of artistic practice, as changes in the relationship between the artist and the public, in the concept of the work and also in the market, fueled by an increasingly voracious and internationalizing capitalism, led to the search for a regional artistic identity.\nThe change in perspective led some artists to think that \"gaucho art\" had existed in the past, but had dissolved because of the internationalization of contemporary art and the globalization of culture in general. Others bet on regionalism, associating it with folklore and popular art, or distinguishing certain specific procedures and identifying them as peculiar to Rio Grande do Sul. In the field of criticism, it was a period of decline, with the notable exceptions of Carlos Scarinci, Angélica de Morais and Luiz Carlos Merten, while academic research was gaining strength and the search for further training beyond graduation became more frequent among artists.\n\nThe easing of the military regime and the dynamism of the national economy also favored activity in the field of art. In 1984, the exhibition Como Vai Você, Geração 80? took place in Rio de Janeiro, where painting re-emerged in a celebratory spirit from an unstable and painful period, influenced by European and American schools such as the pioneers of action painting, neo-expressionism and fauvism, heralding the postmodern movement, dominated by reinterpretation and revival of historical styles. In 1985, the São Paulo Biennial organized the Grande Tela, a show in which painting was dominant. Two years later, Iberê Camargo became the center of a group of artists featured in the Viva a Pintura show at Rio's Petit Galerie.\n\nAt that time, Mário Röhnelt, Milton Kurtz and Romanita Disconzi, linked to Nervo Óptico and Espaço N.O., and Alfredo Nicolaiewsky, elaborating elements of conceptual art towards a new pictorial visuality, exploring the relationship between painting and the graphic arts, photography and mass culture in a pop atmosphere, stood out. Maria Lídia Magliani began a successful career tackling the oppressed condition of women, Antônio Soriano, Clébio Guillon Sória and Antônio Gutierrez cultivated regionalist figurativism and Maria Tomaselli Cirne Lima used imagery inspired by Brazilian folklore and indigenous traditions. Galleries opened a few years earlier, such as Guignard (1970), Eucatexpo (1975), Delphus (1978) and Cambona (1978). The first art auctions took place, the Oficina de Arte Gallery was able to keep artists under contract and several art books and catalogs began to circulate.\nRenato Heuser, Karin Lambrecht and Regina Ohlweiler followed the principles of informal abstraction; Gisela Waetge engaged with drawing; Petrucci and Ivan Pinheiro Machado focused on hyper-realism; Yeddo Titze pursued modernism; Heloísa Schneiders da Silva and Ruth Scneider revived expressionist figuration, and Fernando Baril and Britto Velho updated surrealism. They formed a large and dynamic generation of excellent painters and active teachers. In 1986, MARGS held an exhibition of contemporary painters from the Berlin School, which had a major impact on the new generation of painters from Rio Grande do Sul.\nIn the 1990s, popular artists solidified their careers and young artists made their debut in galleries such as Tina Presser and Arte&Fato, and in the João Fahrion Project, run by MARGS and the State Institute of Visual Arts (IEAVI). Many of them sought to form independent collective projects, showing their work in spaces that allowed them more autonomy and freedom and questioning the institutionalized system of art production, exhibition and consecration. The Plano B (1997) and Remetente (1998) exhibitions stand out as proposals for renovating collective actions, although not exclusively dedicated to painting. The generation includes Richard John, Marilice Corona, Chico Machado, Ubiratã Braga, Nelson Wilbert, Teresa Poester, Tatiana Pinto, Paula Mastroberti, Elton Manganelli, Alexandre Arioli, Eduardo Vieira da Cunha, Hô Monteiro, René Ruduit, Eduardo Haesbaert, Adriano Rojas, Eduardo Miotto, Gelson Radaelli, Antônio Augusto Frantz Soares, Cynthia Vasconcellos and Ricardo André Frantz.\nThe new generation was also characterized by its presence at major national salons, exhibiting assiduously in other states and abroad, by being aware of the latest developments on the international circuit, by having a strong sense of individualism and professionalism, consciously planning their careers, and by actively seeking better intellectual preparation by joining postgraduate courses and research groups. At the time, the Museum of Contemporary Art (MACRS) had an intensive program with exhibitions by national painters such as Dudi Maia Rosa, Carlos Vergara and Marcos Giannotti; the Chamber Salon and the Young Artist's Salon held their most popular editions; the Gasômetro Power Station Cultural Center and the Mario Quintana House of Culture became major cultural venues, and the Iberê Camargo Foundation was created. Rio Grande do Sul also hosted the Mercosur Biennial, which has been held in parallel with the Biennial B since 2007.\nCurrently, painting in Rio Grande do Sul is committed to multiplicity and freedom and works under the impact of globalization, with changes in the art system that remove the local scene as an effective leader and sponsor and suffers from competition from new media and a shrinking market. Retrospective exhibitions of local historical figures were organized by Caixa Econômica Federal (Caixa Resgatando a Memória, with shows by Trindade Leal, Petrucci, Boeira, Libindo, Pelichek, Koetz, Peres) and MARGS (Gheno, Escosteguy, Malagoli, Danúbio and Weingärtner). These retrospectives represented a significant advance in theoretical studies on the history of painting in Rio Grande do Sul, reaching a level of high professional qualification.\nMARGS also held large national historical exhibitions with collections from the National Museum of Fine Arts and the Museum of Modern Art in Rio de Janeiro, and presented international exhibitions such as Florença - Tesouros do Renascimento with Italian paintings, and Arte na França 1860-1960: o Realismo, with French collections. Postgraduate courses in Visual Arts at the Institute of Arts and the Specialization Course in Plastic Arts at Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul (PUC) were consolidated. However, a general history of painting in Rio Grande do Sul was not collected and the available studies are all limited to some specific aspects or certain historical periods.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== News ==\n\nCurrently, painting in Rio Grande do Sul is developed in several cities, such as Santa Maria, which holds a Latin American Salon and has an important university; Pelotas, with UFPel Arts Institute, Leopoldo Gotuzzo Museum, Leisure and Tourism Foundation, Rogério Prestes and Lenir de Miranda; Montenegro, with FUNDARTE courses and the Montenegro Art Museum; Passo Fundo, with the work of Ruth Schneider and the Ruth Schneider Museum; Novo Hamburgo, with FEEVale's post-graduate course in Visual Poetics, and Caxias do Sul, with a large group gathered around NAVI. Painting exhibitions are often held in smaller towns, demonstrating the widespread popularization in Rio Grande do Sul.\nOver the last years, graffiti has become a popular form of art, especially in Porto Alegre. Despite being an illegal practice, it has spread to other cities and influenced the cultured production of several artists from the younger generation. In central Brazil, graffiti developed an artistic quality recognized by a number of critics and attracted the attention of the curators of the São Paulo International Art Biennial in the 1980s.\nIn Rio Grande do Sul, graffiti has become an important method for strengthening social and cultural ties between young people, citizenship training, education about respect for diversity, and aesthetic, political and heritage awareness. It receives frequent media coverage and integrates projects developed by different institutions, such as the painting of Trensurb trains, Santander Cultural's Transfer exhibition and the installation of a Street Art Public Gallery at the Trensurb Bus Station. The exhibition Metropolitanos - A Nova Urbanidade em Exposição, held in 2012 by the MACRS, invited a large group of painters linked to street art. In 2013, the Pão dos Pobres Institute promoted the Aproximação festival, dedicated to urban art combined with talks, exhibitions and street activities.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistory of Rio Grande do Sul\nBrazilian painting\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Temple Na-Ri-VéH 777 is a Haitian Vodou temple located in downtown Port-au-Prince, Haiti, in the Grand Belair neighborhood, which was part of a maroon colony during the colonial period. The Temple is rooted in the tradition of Lakou Jisou. It was founded in 1997 by Jean-Daniel Lafontant, a Sèvitè (servant) of the lwa (spirits), who still serves as the temple's guardian. The Temple houses artistic and traditional objects, some pre-Columbian and others dating from the colonial period and the Haitian Revolution. In that spiritual eclectic amalgam, contemporary works of art cohabitate with ritual objects, with each piece or object taking on a sacred character, as they are believed to be appropriated by the Lwa themselves.\n\n\n== References ==",

The all-vocalist trio is formed by JAM Project's Ricardo Cruz, Rodrigo Rossi and Larissa Tassi.\nThe group was founded in 2017 when they released their first single in a partnership with Brazilian manga-publishing company JBC, which was releasing Katsuhiro Otomo's Akira in Brazil. The single had three songs inspired by the world of Akira, including the title one called \"Neo Tokyo\". The following year, they released \"Space Runners, Go\", theme of Brainstorm Chimp's game Space Runners. Still in 2018, they partnered with JBC again to release \"Yume\", in honor of its founder. The partnership bore more fruit with the song \"Somos Heróis\" (we are heroes), theme for the Combo Rangers comic book \"Somos Iguais\" (we are the same); and with \"Lembranças\", to celebrate the release of Makoto Shinkai's Your Name's movie and manga in Brazil.\nIn 2020, the trio was responsible for the Brazilian Portuguese versions of the opening and ending themes of Saint Seiya: Soul of Gold.\nSince its creation, the trio has performed all over Brazil in events like Anime Friends and Anime Summit.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n2017 Neo Tokyo (inspired by Akira)\n2017 Lembranças (inspired by Your Name)\n2018 Space Runners, Go (from Space Runners)\n2018 Somos Heróis (from Combo Rangers: Somos Iguais)\n2018 Yume\n\n\n=== Other releases ===\nSoldier Dream ver.

It is the first work that Mañanós would make as part of a series of six works on political life that make up his most interesting contribution to Spanish art.\nThe painting, an oil on canvas measuring 92 x 142 cm, faithfully reproduces the Conference Hall, or Salón de los Pasos Perdidos, of the Palace of the Senate of Spain. In it are a series of politicians and personages of the time, as well as two of the actual paintings found in the room: The Oath to the Constitution (on the left) and The Surrender of Granada (on the right), the latter whose restoration Martinez had helped with.\nThe painting itself is housed in the Palace of the Senate.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Vikturia Illivna Baginska-Gurji (c. Vectokria Ilynichna Baginskaya; born Gurdjik; June 30, 1926, Krasnodar, USSR – January 7, 2012, Russian Federation) was a Soviet and Russian writer, teacher, collector of songs and folklore of the Krymchaks, one of the last speakers of the living Krymchak language.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nViktoriya Baginskaya was born in the family of Crimeans Ilya Yakaulevich and Vera Petrovna Gurdzhi, who came to Krasnodar from Kerch (Crimea) in the famine year of 1921.\nIn 1974 she was invited to cooperate in the popular in the USSR \"Teacher's Newspaper\" [ru] after winning (1st prize) in the All-Union Literary Competition of Essays \"Teacher of Our Days\", dedicated to the 50th anniversary of the Teacher's Newspaper. Articles B. Baginsky about non-standard lessons, techniques and methods of education, essays, novels, etc. until recently were printed in the Teacher's Newspaper.\nMore than 250 articles were published in All-Union and regional periodicals: in the magazines \"Literature at School\", \"Literature Lessons\", \"Family and School\", \"Friendship of Peoples\", \"Soviet Woman\" (later \"Women's World\"), \"Nature and man\", \"Science and life\" and many others; in the central newspapers: \"Nastavnitskaya gazeta\", \"Pravda\", \"Hudok\" and other publications. Viktoriya Baginskaya is a laureate of five literary contests for the best essay: International (two first and one third prizes), All-Union (first and third prizes).\n\n\n== Creativity and accomplishment ==\nAll seven members of the Gurdji family, who lived far from the Crimea, spoke Crimean at home, knew Crimean songs, protected and popularized songs, proverbs and sayings, stories and myths of Krymchaks, did not forget national customs and traditions.\nIn the early 1960s Baginska sent 12 Crimean songs to the State Museum of Ethnography of the USSR – in the original and with her own translation into Russian. The museum institution accepted it as members of the council for the promotion of the Museum.\nIn 1983 the newspaper Pravda published V. Baginskaya's article \"I belong to the source\", where she spoke for the first time about her people and stressed the need to preserve the people's creativity of the Krymchaks.\nBaginskaya collected 100 songs, 230 proverbs, parables, fairy tales and proverbs, translated them into Russian, but it was not possible to publish it for decades. In 2003, Baginskaya, with the help of her husband and sons, managed to publish 100 copies of the collection \"Folk Songs and Proverbs of the Krymchaks\" at her own expense. The collection was gifted to folklore lovers. The book is catalogued by the United States Library of Congress.\nBaginskaya translated Alexander Pushkin's poetry collections into the Krymchak language.\nVictoria Baginskaya made a miniature copy of I.K. Aivazovsky's  paintings, She painted the works of some authors(AN Tolstoy, \"Aelita\"; AR Belyaev, \"Amphibian Man\" and others). In the literary genre, she specializes in science fiction poetry and short stories (\"Contact\", \"Calling\", etc.).\n\n\n== Poetry ==\nMy village ship Archived 2010-03-14 at the Wayback Machine, Teacher's Newspaper;\nThe first selection of poems B.

However, in recent years they have lost seats to the Conservatives, UKIP and Liberal Democrats. The seats up for election this year were last elected in 2021. In that election, Labour lost 9 seats, The Conservatives gained 6 and Liberal Democrats gained 4.\nIn 2022, Labour defied speculation they would continue to haemorrhage, Leader Graeme Miller commented that \"It was a good night\" for his party because they \"stopped the rot\".\nSince the last election, three councillors defected from the Liberal Democrat, two to Labour and one to Independent. A Labour councillor (elected as a Conservative) now sits as an Independent councillor after being accused of forcing a woman to marry.\n\n\n== Result summary ==\n\n\n== Council Composition ==\nIn the last council, the composition of the council was:\n\n\n== Results by ward ==\nAn asterisk next to a candidate's name denotes an incumbent councillor.

Born c. 700, he was blind from birth, but became a leading disciple of the Shi'a imam Muhammad al-Baqir, and is recorded as a Tabi'un transmitter of hadith and commentator of the Quran, although later Sunni and Twelver Shi'a traditions disparage him as unreliable. Abu'l-Jarud was a supporter of the failed revolt of Zayd ibn Ali in 740, and in its aftermath he refused to acknowledge al-Baqir's son, Ja'far al-Sadiq, as imam. This earned him the hostility of later Twelver Shi'a scholars, who nevertheless accept some of the traditions relayed by him, whereas Sunnis generally reject him as unreliable. He died sometime after 757/767.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nHaider, Najam I. (2021). \"al-Jārūdiyya\".

Its mission is to halt the environmental degradation of the planet and build a future in which humans live in harmony with nature, through the protection and conservation of biodiversity and the reduction of the ecological footprint.\n\n\n== Beginnings ==\nThe WWF was founded in 1961 with the main goal of raising funds and acting in the defense of endangered natural species around the world. One of the WWF's first and most ambitious goals was to buy land in Doñana to preserve the wild marshes from imminent industrialization.\nThe Spanish section of WWF was created on 30 July 1968 under the name ADENA, which stands for Asociación para la Defensa de la Naturaleza. Naturalist Félix Rodríguez de la Fuente was one of its founders and served as its vice president until his death in 1980.\n\nRodríguez de la Fuente fought for the creation of natural and national parks, the protection of endangered species—such as wolves, the Eurasian griffon vulture, and the peregrine falcon. Thanks to him, it was possible to save the Tablas de Daimiel wetlands from drying out, to prevent the construction of an urban development in the Albufera de València, and to enforce the legal protection of the Doñana and Cabrera parks. Therefore, the creation of ADENA is closely linked to the creation of the Doñana National Park, one of the most biodiverse places in Europe. The organization later joined the WWF network and became known as WWF/Adena. Since 2009, it has been known as WWF Spain. \nADENA's way of working focuses on conservation projects on the ground and with local communities, seeking solutions to environmental problems, in contrast to the other major environmental organizations working in Spain, such as Greenpeace and Ecologists in Action, which work more on denunciation at a global and local scale, respectively. WWF's global logo, the giant panda, has become an icon that the public identifies with nature conservation.\n\n\n== The 1970s ==\nADENA launched the first campaign for the conservation of amphibians in Spain and took part in campaigns against poisoning, for the protection of the wetlands of La Mancha, against illegal hunting, and other causes. In 1973, it participated in the First Working Meeting of Wolf Specialists and of the First International Conference on Conservation of the Wolf held in Stockholm, Sweden. In subsequent years, it created the Birds of Prey Refuge of Montejo de la Vega. Moreover, in order to preserve the Mediterranean fauna, it launched a campaign in defense of the mountain ranges and forests of Extremadura and proposed the creation of the Tablas de Daimiel National Park.\n\n\n== The 1980s ==\nIn 1983, Adena launched the first issue of its magazine Panda, and began taking part in projects to study the Iberian lynx and the white stork, studying the ecology of many other animal species, and actively fighting for their conservation. Furthermore, it created a database of plants endemic to the Spanish Mediterranean and launched the awareness campaign Salvemos las plantas que nos salvan a nosotros, an unprecedented initiative for the conservation of forests. It also created the La Encantá Botanical Micro-reserve in Villarrobledo, Albacete; launched environmental education activities; dealt a hard blow to the poaching of bears in Asturias; continued to work for the protection of the Doñana National Park; and decried the construction of the Costa Doñana residential development.\n\n\n== The 1990s ==\nWWF helped complete the list of natural areas to be included in the Natura 2000 network.\n\n\n== The 21st century ==\n\n\n=== Honorary presidency ===\nIn 2012, a controversy arose surrounding an elephant hunting safari in Botswana involving then King Juan Carlos I of Spain, who had been the honorary president of WWF Spain since its founding in 1968. The king had been going on these safaris since 2006, but the news came to light when the government announced harsh economic cuts for the Spanish people. On 21 July 2012, via a special assembly, the organization decided by 226 to 13 votes to remove the position of honorary president from its statutes.\n\n\n== See also ==\nWorld Wide Fund for Nature\nFélix Rodríguez de la Fuente\nDoñana National Park\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website of WWW España\nWebsite of WWW España's Panda magazine",

        "content": "Tim MacMahon, nicknamed Banned, is an American sportswriter for ESPN.com who covers the National Basketball Association (NBA). He covered the Dallas Cowboys, Dallas Mavericks, and Texas Rangers for the Dallas Morning News before moving to ESPN in 2009. He is known for having his media credentials revoked by the Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban in 2016 and for interactions with Jason Kidd and Luka Doncic.  He is the author of the forthcoming book \"The Wonder Boy: Luka Doncic and the Curse of Greatness\"MacMahon started out studying business and playing basketball at a Division II school in Florida. When he realized he would be riding the bench as a basketball player he transferred to the University of North Texas to major in broadcast journalism. At UNT he worked for the Denton Record-Chronicle and Dallas Morning News. After college he moved to ESPN Dallas.In 2016, MacMahon's role at ESPN changed, moving from being a full-time Mavericks beat writer to covering all the NBA. Cuban was unhappy with this change, and revoked the media credentials of MacMahon and Marc Stein.   The credentials were later restored. In 2023, in response to a question about improvement in the team compared to the previous year, Jason Kidd said “You wanted to make a big deal about it last year, but you’re not making a big deal about it this year because shit’s going good,” Kidd said. “So write some positive shit.” In January 2024, Luka Dončić and MacMahon clashed over an interaction between a fan and Dončić, and MacMahon's reporting of the incident, which Dončić considered biased.He is a regular on the Hoop Collective Podcast with Brian Windhorst, where he is introduced as \"Banned MacMahon\" and given his own theme song.\n\n\n== References ==",

It premiered at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival and received very positive reviews.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nFilmed at the Centre hospitalier Le Vinatier in Bron near to Lyon, the title derives from a French law that states that patients who are involuntarily committed to a psychiatric institution must have their case reviewed by a judge within 12 days of their committal.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n12 Days received a 95% score on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 23 reviews. In The Guardian, Wendy Ide wrote \"The extraordinary level of access and intimacy begs the question, if someone is not deemed fit to leave a psychiatric ward, can they really agree to participation in a documentary? […] However empathetic the approach and honourable the intent, questions of consent and the spectre of exploitation lurk at the edge of the frame. Moral questions notwithstanding, this is a remarkable piece of work,\" and gave it four stars out of five.\n12 Days was nominated for the César Award for Best Documentary Film at the 43rd César Awards.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n12 Days at IMDb \n12 Days at Rotten Tomatoes",

        "content": "Sir George Hornidge Porter (24 November 1822 –  15 June 1895) was an Irish surgeon.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nPorter was born in Kildare Street, Dublin, on 24 November 1822, was the only son of William Henry Porter (1790–1861), by his wife Jane (Hornidge) of Blessington, co. Wicklow. The father, son of William Porter of Rathfarnham, co. Dublin, was president of the Irish College of Surgeons in 1838, and professor of surgery in the College of Surgeons school of medicine in Dublin. He was a very popular teacher in the times when the old system was in vogue by which apprenticeship to a well-known surgeon was one of the portals to the profession of surgery. He was also a good anatomist, and made occasional contributions to surgical literature, some of which were of distinct merit. An operation on the femoral artery called Porter's, now, however, rarely practised, owes its name to him. A brother, Frank Thorpe Porter, stipendiary magistrate at Dublin and raconteur, wrote ‘Grand Juries in Ireland,’ Dublin, 1840, and a well-known book of anecdotes, ‘The Recollections of an Irish Police Magistrate’ (2nd edit. 1875).\nGeorge Hornidge Porter studied at Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated M.D. at the College of Surgeons, Ireland. In 1844 he became a fellow of the latter body, and in 1849 was elected surgeon to the Meath Hospital, Dublin, to which institution his father was attached in the same capacity. He early attained the reputation of a bold and successful operator. He contributed to the medical papers, chiefly to the Dublin ‘Journal of Medical Science,’ many records of surgical cases and operations. He was a man of popular manner, and ambitious of social distinction, and was for many years one of the best known men in his native city. He was president of the College of Surgeons of Ireland during 1868–9, and for a long time a member of the council of that college, where he exercised great personal influence. In 1869 he was appointed surgeon-in-ordinary to the queen in Ireland. He was knighted in 1883, and received a baronetcy in 1889 in recognition of his distinguished professional position. The university of Dublin conferred upon him in 1873 the honorary degree of master of surgery, and in 1891 the post of regius professor of surgery. The university of Glasgow gave him in 1888 the honorary degree of LL.D. In his earlier years he frequently gave expert evidence in the coroner's court, and in 1882 he was one of those who were called upon to examine the bodies of Lord Frederick Cavendish and Thomas Henry Burke, who were murdered in the Phœnix Park. Sir George Porter was attached to many of the Dublin hospitals in an honorary or consulting capacity, and was an active member of numerous charitable and other boards. He acquired by purchase landed property in co. Wexford, and was proud of his position as a country gentleman, and especially of being high sheriff of the county. He died of heart-disease at his residence, Merrion Square, Dublin, on 15 June 1895.\nHe married Julia, daughter of Isaac Bond of Flimby, Cumberland, by whom he had one son.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPorter baronets\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Norman, Conolly (1896). \"Porter, George Hornidge\".

As the DEFA studio for animated films was relocated to Dresden and Rietschel did not want to leave Berlin, she applied to the comic magazine Mosaik. She was hired in 1960 after the illustrator Nikol Dimitriades left for West Germany. Lona Rietschel quickly became the magazine's most important illustrator and worked on over 400 issues. She designed the main characters Dig, Dag and Digedag (the final version) as well as Ritter Runkel and secondary characters such as the notorious band of buccaneers \"Teufelsbrüder\" (German for \"Devils Brothers\").\nWhen Hannes Hegen left Mosaik in 1975 in a dispute with the publisher and took his characters, the Digedags, with him, new characters were created. Lothar Dräger invented the names and characters of the Abrafaxe and Lona Rietschel took care of the character development. She remained loyal to the monthly magazine until 1999 and regularly drew her Abrafaxe until old age. Both the covers of the anthologies and the motifs for the 2006 calendar were drawn by her. Last but not least, Lona Rietschel's timeless design and her drawing skills made Mosaik a comic legend.\nIn May 2013, Rietschel was awarded the PENG!Prize for her life's work.\n\n\n== Literature (chronological order) ==\nMatthias Friske: Die Geschichte des 'MOSAIK von Hannes Hegen': A comic legend in the GDR.

        "content": "Leonard Poe (1590 – 4 April 1631) was an English physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nPoe whose family came originally, it is said, from the Rhenish Palatinate, was in 1590 in the service of the Earl of Essex. Essex, after many vain appeals to the College of Physicians, secured from that body on 13 July 1596 a license enabling Poe to practise medicine (Hist. MSS. Comm. 8th Rep. pt. i. p. 228). Although he was thereby permitted to treat venereal, cutaneous, and calculous diseases, gout and simple tertian ague, in all other fevers and in all severe diseases he was required to call to his assistance a member of the college (Munk, College of Physicians, i. 149). On 30 June 1598 he was ordered to be imprisoned and deprived of his license, but soon made terms with the college. Despite the suspicion with which the profession regarded him, his practice was large in fashionable society, and his reputation stood fairly high. On 11 December 1606, at the suggestion of the Earls of Southampton, Northampton, and Salisbury, all restrictions on his license were removed. On 12 January 1609 he was made ordinary physician of the king's household (State Papers, Dom. index to warrant book, p. 77), and on 7 July the persistent influence of his aristocratic patrons led to his election as fellow of the College of Physicians (Hist. MS. Comm. ubi supra). He had a mandate on 22 July 1615 to be created M.D., and apparently obtained the degree at Cambridge.\nIn April 1612 he was one of the three physicians in attendance on Lord-treasurer Salisbury (State Papers, Dom. James I, lxviii. 104), and was present at his death on 24 May following (Hist. MSS. Comm. 10th Rep. part iv. p. 16). On 6 June 1625 he attended the death of Orlando Gibbons, the musical composer, and made the post-mortem (ib. Car. I, iii. 37). He died on 4 April 1631, when Sir Edward Alston was elected a fellow in his place. His son Theophilus matriculated from Broadgate Hall, Oxford, 1623–4, 6 Feb., æt. 15.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Shaw, William Arthur (1896). \"Poe, Leonard\".

        "content": "Ingeburg Herz, née König (born February 23, 1920  Hamburg; - September 30, 2015) was a German entrepreneur and philanthropist. The wife of Tchibo founder Max Herz was one of the richest Germans with an estimated fortune of over five billion euros in 2005.\n\n\n== Life ==\nIngeburg König, who lived in Hamburg, married Max Herz in 1939; they had five children together: Günter Herz (* 1940), Joachim Herz (1941–2008), Michael Herz (* 1943), Wolfgang Herz and Daniela Herz-Schnoeckel.\nAfter the death of the company founder in 1965, the entire estate passed to his wife and children, but the will did not clearly regulate the company's succession. A dispute arose between the children. Günter Herz, as the eldest, took over the management of the Tchibo company, while the mother and the other children held further shares.\nIngeburg Herz turned to charitable work and established the Max and Ingeburg Herz Foundation, which primarily supports facilities for the medical treatment and care of the elderly, but is also active in other areas, such as awarding scholarships to German students.\nAt the beginning of 2001, Günter Herz had to resign as chairman of the management board of the then Tchibo Holding AG (now maxingvest ag) due to ongoing disputes within the family. For months, the dispute also paralyzed the company and the intended acquisition of a majority stake in the cosmetics group Beiersdorf AG. In August 2003, the family members signed a contract that made mother Ingeburg Herz and the three brothers Michael, Wolfgang and Joachim the sole owners of the family group. Former boss Günter Herz and his sister Daniela were paid out an estimated four billion euros.\nIngeburg Herz died in Hamburg on September 30, 2015, at the age of 95.\nThe asteroid (185164) Ingeburgherz was named in her honor.\n\n\n== References ==",

She was one of the few female directors who were successful in the GDR. From the 1960s onwards, she produced more than 60 films, some of which won awards at festivals.\n\n\n== Life and work ==\nThe daughter of a dairy owner, she graduated from high school in Blankenburg (Harz). Nickel studied at the Humboldt University of Berlin Pedagogy and German studies. She completed her studies in 1957 with the state examination.\nShe then gained her first experience in the film business as an assistant director at DEFA. From 1959, she was also involved in the production of feature films in this capacity. In 1963, she moved to the studio for newsreels and documentaries. She again worked as an assistant director, primarily with Karl Gass. Two years later, she directed her first own film, We Understand Each Other.\nIn the following years, she increasingly shot documentaries in the Soviet Union. She was also interested in everyday life in the GDR and captured this in several productions. She worked almost exclusively with cameraman Niko Pawloff.\nFor GDR television, Nickel directed several cinematic portraits, including a film about the director Konrad Wolf in 1977. She let the people portrayed speak for themselves and largely refrained from commenting.\nSince 1972 she was a member of the board, since 1977 of the presidium of the Association of Film and Television Professionals of the GDR.\n\n\n== Filmography (selection) ==\n1965: Wir verstehen uns\n1967: Sibirien, mein Haus\n1968: Lieder machen Leute\n1969: Hier und dort\n1970: Sie\n1971: Palucca / Gret Palucca\n1972: Heuwetter.

In July 1984, an investigation was opened against Herklotz on suspicion of fraud and embezzlement, investigating whether the Association for Civic Education she led had used forged signature lists for \"ghost seminars\" that were not held to raise 40.000 to 50,000 DM in state subsidies with the help of forged signature lists for \"ghost seminars\" that were not held, and whether these funds were passed on to the SPD and Workers' Welfare.\n\n\n== Party ==\nHerklotz joined the SPD in 1946 and soon became chairwoman of the SPD women's organization in the Palatinate. She later became a member of the district executive of the SPD in the Palatinate and the Rhineland-Palatinate state committee as well as the central women's committee of the federal SPD. From 1958 to 1962, she was a member of the party executive. In 1970, she was elected to the party's control commission. From 1974 to 1978, she was local chairwoman of the SPD in her hometown of Speyer.\n\n\n== Member of Parliament ==\nLuise Herklotz was a Landtagsabgeordnete in Rhineland-Palatinate from 1949 to October 5, 1957. In 1954, the state parliament elected her as a member of the second Federal Assembly, which re-elected Theodor Heuss as federal president. She was a member of the German Bundestag from September 24, 1956, when she replaced Hermann Trittelvitz, until 1972. From 1966 to 1973, she was also a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.\nShe was later a member of the European Parliament from 1979 to 1984.\n\n\n== Honors ==\nOn September 6, 2003, the city of Speyer awarded her the honorary citizen right. In 1973, she was awarded the Cross of Merit First Class, which she had refused to accept in 1969, and in June 1984 the Great Federal Cross of Merit of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany. In 1986 she received the Marie-Juchacz-Plakette of the Workers' Welfare Association, in 1990 the Medal of Merit of the City of Speyer and in 1999 the Order of Merit of Rhineland-Palatinate.\n\n\n== External links ==\nPersonal profile of Luise Herklotz in the European Parliament's database of members\n\n\n== References ==",

There she met Hans Thoma; she soon became his model and, a year later, a painting pupil. On 19 June 1877, she married Thoma in Säckingen and moved into a flat with him and his mother and sister Agathe in Frankfurt/Main. As the marriage remained childless and Cella cared for her niece Ella, they adopted her in 1878. Together, the four of them moved to Kronberg im Taunus in 1899, where Thoma became a member of the Malerkolonie there. When Thoma received a call to Karlsruhe in 1901, the flat was given up. Cella only lived in Karlsruhe for a short time, as she succumbed to the consequences of appendicitis while travelling in Constance in the same year.\n\nCella Thoma continued to devote herself to art after her marriage and was known as a flower and still life painter.\nOn 23 November 1901, Cella Thoma died in Constance at the age of 43.\n\n\n== Works (selection) ==\n1875: Alpine roses, oil on paper\n1878: Still life with fruit and two glasses, oil on canvas, 30 × 37 cm\n1880: Fruit Still Life\nStill Life with Vegetables and Fruit, oil on paper on wood, 48 × 76 cm\nFlowering Branches in a Handled Basket\nRose Still Life\nAnemones\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Literature ==\nThoma, Cella.

        "content": "William Irvine (1776 – 23 May 1811) was a Scottish physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nIrvine was the son of William Irvine, professor of chemistry at Glasgow. He was born there in 1776. He studied medicine in the university of Edinburgh, where he took the degree of M.D. 25 June 1798. His thesis, ‘De Epispasticis,’ was based upon an unpublished essay of his father's on nervous diseases (Preface to Chemical Essays, 1805). He became a licentiate of the College of Physicians of London 25 June 1806, and his professional life was spent in the medical service of the army as physician to the forces. In 1805 he published his father's ‘Essays, chiefly on Chemical Subjects.’ In 1808 he was stationed in Sicily, and in 1810 his most important work appeared, ‘Some Observations upon Diseases, chiefly as they occur in Sicily.’ This book is based upon observations on malarial fever and dysentery made in the general army hospital at Messina, and contains several acute remarks, such as that abscess of the liver is associated with dysentery, that it may burst through the diaphragm into the lung, and the patient nevertheless recover. Shingles was then confused with erysipelas, but he notes accurately a difference in the results of treatment which is due to the definite duration of the former disease. He had carefully compared his own observations with those of George Cleghorn and of James Currie on similar fevers, and had studied minutely the observations of Hippocrates on diseases of the Mediterranean region. He died of fever at Malta, 23 May 1811. After his death were published in 1813 his ‘Letters on Sicily.’\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Moore, Norman (1892). \"Irvine, William (1776-1811)\".

        "content": "\"You Need Me Now?\" is a song by Norwegian singer-songwriter Girl in Red and American singer Sabrina Carpenter. Written by the artists along with its producer Matias Tellez, the song was released on March 22, 2024, as the third single from Girl in Red's second studio album, I'm Doing It Again Baby! (2024).\n\n\n== Background ==\nBetween 2023 and 2024, Girl in Red and Sabrina Carpenter were opening acts for Taylor Swift's sixth concert tour, the Eras Tour. Girl in Red first teased \"You Need Me Now?\" at an event for her fans in New York City. In an interview with the New York Times Popcast, the singer stated that, after sharing Carpenter's song \"Feather\" on her Instagram stories, they reached out and offered her to be a part of \"You Need Me Now?\".\n\n\n== Composition ==\n\"You Need Me Now?\" is a rock-infused pop song. On the track, according to NME, Girl in Red \"calls out an ex's bad behaviour and 'games'\", singing: \"I'm tired of waiting around / Letting you let me down / I'm done being yours\". Derrick Rossignol, for Uproxx, said that Carpenter's feature on the song \"is done in a fourth-wall-breaking, super-fun way\". She enters the song after a spoken bridge, where Girl in Red says: \"You know what would be really fucking cool on this? Sabrina\".\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "José María Barreiro Manjón (August 20, 1793 – October 11, 1819) was a Spanish military officer who fought in the Peninsular War and in the Colombian War of Independence. In 1819 at the rank of colonel, he was commander of the III Division of Expeditionary Army of Costa Firme (Royalist Army) in New Granada during Simon Bolivar's campaign to liberate New Granada. He commanded his army against the Independence Army at the Battle of Vargas of Swamp, where he would be defeated, and at the Battle of Boyacá, where he would be captured along with remnants of the III Division and the end of Spanish control over New Granada.\nBarreiro would die at the age of 26, when he and 37 other Spanish officers who had been taken prisoner were executed by firing squad in the main plaza of Santa Fe by orders of General Francisco de Paula Santander on October 11, 1819, as a result of the Decree of War to the Death.\n\n\n== Early career ==\nJosé María Barreiro Manjón was born on August 20, 1793, in the port city of Cádiz in the Kingdom of Spain. His father was artillery colonel José Barreiro and his mother Antonia Manjón Micón. At the age of 12, on January 7, 1806, he enrolled as a cadet at the Real Colegio de Artillería de Segovia (Royal Artillery School in Segovia) and graduated on November 2, 1808, with the rank of sub-lieutenant.\n\n\n=== Peninsular War ===\nHe participated in the defense of Madrid against Napoleon after the Battle of Somosierra in December 1808, where he would be wounded and taken prisoner, however he managed to escape three months later. The Supreme Central Junta granted him the rank of second lieutenant. On May 24, 1809, he was assigned to the 2nd Army of the Right, and fought in Catalonia, where he was promoted to second lieutenant on April 25, 1810, and to lieutenant on the following August 26. He fought in the Siege of Valencia, against the troops of Marshal Suchet, and was able to retreat to Alicante, after the capitulation of that city on January 9, 1812.  He was adjutant major of the 3rd artillery regiment (August 4, 1812), being incorporated into the 4th army, receiving the rank of captain on December 13 of that year.  He was then assigned to the Reserve Army of Andalusia, and was promoted to captain of Horse Artillery (February 5, 1813), fighting at Pancorbo and in the Siege of Pamplona.\n\n\n== Colombian Independence War ==\nIn December 1814 Barreiro was assigned to the 10,000 strong Expeditionary Army of Costa Firme under the command of Field Marshall Pablo Morillo, this expeditionary army was created with the goal of reconquering the Viceroyalty of New Granada and the Captaincy General of Venezuela which had been in open rebellion since 1810. The expedition set off from Cadiz in February 1815 arriving off the coast of Venezuela in early April 1815. From Venezuela Morillo then took his force to New Granada and began a campaign to reconquer New Granda in which most of the country had been in control of republican forces since 1811. This campaign started off with Spanish Forces putting the port city of Cartagena under siege in August 1815 for 105 days. Barreiro participated in some of the assaults on republican positions during the siege. The city surrendered to the Spanish in December, and in acknowledgement for his actions during the siege Barreiro was promoted to Colonel on December 15, 1815. After the capture of the capital, Santa Fe, in May 1816 Barreiro returned with the bulk of the army to Venezuela in order to fight off a renewed campaign by Simon Boilvar.\n\n\n=== Commander of Royalist Forces in New Granada ===\nWhen Juan de Samano was named Viceroy of New Granada in March 1818,  the III Division of the Expeditionary Army of Costa Firme, now stationed in Santa Fe, was left without a commanding officer, with Colonel Warleta ill and Colonel de la Calzada commanding the V Division in the plains of Apure, General Morillo named Barreiro commander of the division in January 1818. Barreiro upon hearing this news marched from Venezuela to Santa Fe with reinforcements composed of local Venezuelan troops for the capital, these troops were seen by Spanish leaderships as valuable as the European troops Morillo had brought. Upon arriving to Santa Fe on August 4, 1818, Barreiro decided to organize and discipline his troops, the III Division was composed of some 3000 troops organized into four infantry battalions along with 600 cavalry men.\nWhen Barreiro assumed command in late 1818, New Granada had been largely pacified as a result of its reconquest by Spanish forces in 1815–1816 with the exception of small guerilla groups operating in central New Granada, things would begin to change in the coming year. In early 1819, Morillo became concerned about the intelligence he received about New Granadan General Francisco de Paula Santander who had been dispatched by Simon Bolivar to the region with the task of organizing an army in the eastern plains region of Casanar. Morillo ordered Barreiro to conduct an invasion of that province in order to clear it of rebel presence. In March 1819 Barreiro gathered a force of 1,800 troops and crossed the cordillera oriental and invaded the province, however the campaign was not successful as the lack of supplies and inhispotable climate hampered his force as well as a Santander's strategy of retreating further into the plains. In mid April Barreiro and his exhausted forces withdrew back towards central New Granada and garrisoned in the city of Tunja to wait out the rain season.\n\n\n=== Bolivar's Campaign to Liberate New Granada ===\nWith Barreiro's forces back in central New Granada, the rainy season set in and the Spanish thought it impossible for any army to march in those diiffcult conditions, however in late May 1819 after receiving news from Santander about barreiro's failed offensive in Casanare, Bolivar marched his forces from the plains of Apure towards Santander's forces in Casanare to meet up and begin their campaign to liberate New Granada. This two armies would meet in Tame on June 15, 1819, and would march together towards the Cordillera Oriental with the aim of crossing the Andes through the Paramo de Pisba. Barreiro was informed about the reunion of Bolivar and Santander on July 25 and their intentions of penetrating central New Granada, the same day he informed Viceroy Juan de Samano of the situation. He then considered several paths through which Bolívar could cross the mountains: La Salina, Paya (Pisba), Pueblo Viejo, Medina, Miraflores, Tenza valley and Cáqueza. He discarded the first four, considering them too difficult and costly in human lives, especially in the winter season. He also ruled out penetration through Cáqueza, because it was located too far to the south. He assumed that Bolívar would choose the one in the Tenza Valley as the most appropriate and sent a number of force there to guard the pass. Meanwhile, the only Spanish forces that Barreiro had left on the other side of the Andes was a small garrsion of 2 companies; some 300 men under the command of  seargant major Juan Figueroa y Ladron garrsioned in the town of Paya. This force would come into contact with the Patriot Army's vanguard division under the command of Santander on July 27 and skirmished with them. Upon realizing they were facing a larger army, the Spanish withdrew towards Labranzagrande where the main mountain pass lay, Figueroa upon this encounter immediatey wrote a letter to Barreiro informing him of the situation.\nBarreiro's soon found himself in a difficult situation: he did not dare to cross the mountain range and attack Bolívar, because he feared opening any other passage for him on a front that extended almost 250 kilometers. Furthermore, he did not see the possibility of maintaining his troops on the other side of the mountains, practically cut off from Tunja and the capital. He therefore chose to wait, while alarming and contradictory reports arrived  such as one that informed that Bolívar was going to meet Páez in Píedecuesta. He tried to gather, as far as the security of the Kingdom allowed, several detachments of his army, stationed at widely dispersed points. Finally, on July 5 he received news that 500 cattle were led from Paya to Pisba and on the 6th, that the enemy army had moved towards the moor towards Pisba and Socotá. When Bolivar had arrived in Socha on July 6 his army was in a weaknened state and at its most vulnerable, however Barreiro preferred to stay garrisoned and concentrate his forces that had been dispersed throughout the region in Tunja at the time. Viceroy Samano grew frustrated with this approach and decided to relieve Barreiro of his command and replace him with Colonel Sebastian de la Calzada, who was commander of the 400 strong European Aragon Battalion which guarded Santa Fe, as commander of the III Division. Barreiro however refused this order as it would \"Stain his honor as a military officer\" and that only General Pablo Morillo had the authority to relieve him of his command, he ordered de la Calzada to return to Santa Fe.\nAt dawn on July 8, Barreiro finally moved in the direction of Sogamoso and led his army to meet the patriot forces. On July 10 a series of skirmishes and combats began between the two armies at Corrales and Gameza. In his reports to the Viceroy, Barreiro claims victories over the Patriots. On the July 11 a larger battle occurred again at Gameza, during the battle a large group of Patriot troops were taken prisoner, Barreiro subsequently ordered their execution by bayonet in order to conserve ammuntiton, he justified this in a letter to the Viceroy stating that this action was necessary stating that \"The kind of soldiers we have need to get bloodied in order to get fired up.\"\n\n\n==== Vargas Swamp ====\nAfter these skimirshes Bolivar decided that a frontal assault on Sogamoso was impossible for the time being until he regained the full strength of his army.  Bolivar then decided to perform a flanking action through the ceniza valley, Barreiro upon realizing this pulled back from the Sogamoso area and took the town of Paipa. The two armies would not face each other until July 25. On July 20 Barreiro received reports that Bolivar was on the move again, on the 25th spies informed him of the Patriot Army difficulty in trying to ford the Chicamocha river near the area of Puente de Balsa, Bolivar was trying to march towards Paipa, with the Bolivar's army delayed by the crossing Barreiro moved quickly, his army now some 1,800 srong,  to the area of Vargas Swamp positiing his force on the choke point of the main road that was bordered by the swamp on the left and series of tall hills on the right. Bolivar's forces arrived at 12pm and immedialtey engaged in what would be known as the Battle of Vargas Swamp, Barreiro had set up his HQ at the Casa de la seis ventanas where he observed and gave orders during the battle.The Royalists and the Patriots fought for 5 grueling hours as the partiots tried various times to dislodge the Spanish from the hills and the road, around 5pm the Patriots began fall back in dissaray Barreiro ordered a frontal assault along with a flanking maneouvre by his cavalry to deal the final blow. Bolivar in desperation ordered the last of his reserve cavalry and infantry to attack the Spanish line, this was spearheaded by Colonel Juan Jose Rondon and his 14 lancers with more units joining alongside them, they charged uphill on Cangrejo hill where the Spanish infantry and thr Hussars of Ferdinand VII who had dismounted to help the inftantry were caught be surprise and dislodged from the hill this action was done in tandem with an infantry attack on the taller Picacho hill by Santander's vanguard force and the British Legion under Colonel James Rooke dislodging the Spanish forces as well. Around 6pm a heav tropical rainstorm set in putting an end to the battle which Barreiro used to cover his forces as his reorganzied them and withdrew towards Paipa with the Tambo infantry Battalion covering their withdrawal while Bolivar's army returned towards the Chicamocha River. The Battle had been bloody and narrow but indecisive victory for the Patriots, however both sides suffered heavily with the Royalists having suffered 500-400 casaulties and the Patriots around 300–400. In his communications with the Viceroy Barreiro claimed and grand vicotry over his enemies but that the rain storm had prevented hm from effectively destroting Bolivar's forces. However he informed the Viceroy that he was runnig low on supplies and requested ammuniton as well as 3 cannon to bolster his force. The next few days would see both armies race towards the capital Santa Fe.\n\n\n==== Boyaca ====\nAfter Vargas Swamp Bolivar's army had been left non-operational due to the losses suffered and would not move until August 3 after he placed a levy on the local population for men to be conscripted into the army. On August 3, still camped in Paipa the Spanish observed Bolivar's forces near the Chicamocha River near Paipa and then at night observed him by candlelight retreat to his original positions across the river as if he were retreating towards Venezuela. The Spanish then rested unaware of Bolivar's feint, as he ordered a nocturnal countermarch crossing the river again and taking the alternate route to the city of Tunja through the Toca Road. Barreiro would not become aware of this feint till August 5 and hurriedly marched down the Camino Real (Royal Road to Santa Fe) towards Tunja and midday that day he rendezvoused with Colonel Juan Lono who provided him with 12,000 cartridges and 3 artillery pieces (2 howitzers and 1 cannon) and reinforcements, Barreiro's III Division now had 2,670 troops. Bolivar occupied Tunja that same day August 5, upon learning that Bolivar had taken the city and seeing that his line of communication with the capital was cut, he ordered his army march around Tunja through the mountains northwest of the city at night through roads deemed impassable during the rainy season to avoid detection and gain the lead once gain. This march began in the town of Combita at 1 am August 6 and then proceeded to Motavita through a heavy downpour reaching the town at 11:30am where the army camped for the night. Marching through Motavita was considered a wise move strategically for the Spanish, due to its higher elevation one is able to observe Tunja from it. However Barreiro's movement did not go undetected and patriot spies informed Bolivar of their movements. On August 7, the two forces clashed at the Battle of Boyaca, early morining that day Barreiro split his forces and ordered his vanguard force to secure the bridge while the main bulk of the army would march not too far behind. Bolivar's forces intercepted them around 2pm of 7 August. Bolivar's republican troops were composed of approximately 2,850 men, which caught Barriero by surprise and successfully divided 2,670 royalist soldiers with Colonel Francisco Jimenez pinned down by the bridge by Santander and Barreiro desperately fending off a frontal assault by General Anzoategui. While Barreiro's infantry fought valiantly, his cavalry Company of Mounted Grenadiers (an all European unit) abandoned the battelfield and fled, his 3 artillery pieces were rendered useless and as only one cannon was able to be armed and fired 3 salvos before its gun carriage collapsed. The battle lasted two hours with Barreiro unable to effectively maintain order as his troops where hammered by a combined Patriot infantry and cavalry onslaught. The battle resulted in the 66 Patriot casaulties,  250 royalists killed or wounded, as well as the capture of approximately 1,600 of the remaining royal troops. Barreiro himself was captured by a young boy, Pedro Pascascio Martinez.\nViceroy Samano was caught by surprise when he was informed of the defeat and capture of Barreiro and the army on August 8 as all the communications he had sustained with Barreiro had only mentioned victories over the patriots. Samano quiclky fled the capital the next morining August 9 to Cartagena along with other Royalist offcials while Colonel de la Cazlada the 400 soldiers of the Aragon Battalion destroyed the gunpowder supply and retreated towards Popayan.\n\n\n== Imprisonment and Execution ==\nOn August 11 the Patriot Army entered Santa Fe triumphantly with Barreiro and his captured officers along with them, Barreiro and his officers were imprisoned. On 9 September, before departing for Venezuela, Bolivar sent a letter to Samano and proposed a prisoner exchange for the patriot officers being held in Cartagena.\nThe precarious situaution that led up to the execution of Barreiro and the other royalist officers was of vulnearbility, despite having captured Santa Fe royalist sentiment was still strong in some regions of New Granada, the Spanish still had control over the Caribbean coast with Viceroy Samano in Cartagena and in south as well in Popayan and Pasto. On August 10, Spanish Colonel Antonio Pla and his small force tried to infiltrate the city by entering it from behind eastern mountains through Monserrate, he and his force were captured however. With the bulk of the Patriot Army with Bolivar in Venezuela as he attempted to defeat Morillo one last time, Santander now Vicepresident in Santa Fe became worried as he had few troops to defend such a large amount of territory.  By October 10, the tension became unbearable, one of the officers tried to escape disguised as a woman. From Cartagena news came: Sámano refuses to accept the prisoner exchange proposed by Bolívar. and orders the shooting of MacGregor's troops captured in Panama and Riohacha.  Suddenly, on the night of the 10th, the guard is changed. All are unknown to royalists. Two Capuchin friars arrived sbortly after telling the prisoners: \"My sons, very serious decisions have been made...\".\n\nOn October 11, 1819, Jose Maria Barreiro alongside 37 other Royalist officers composed of 25 Spanish and 13 Spanish-American were ordered to be executed by firing squad in the main plaza of Santa Fe by orders of  Vicepresident Francsico de Paula Santander stating.Santafé, October 11, 1819.\nThe Viceroy having refused to enter into talks with the government, the clamors of the people against the prisoners continued and it was fair to take with them the side that they used to take with our own. I order you that on the day, your exellency. that they be put to death all the prisoner officers of the King's army.\n\nGod save your excellency. Signed,   F. de P. Santander Barreiro was the first to be executed, his last words were reportedly \"Long live Spain\" (\"Viva Espana\"). Barreiro's body as well as those of the 37 other executed officers were buried in a mass grave in a sacred groud in the western outskirts of the city.\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== References ==\nAlbi de la Cuesta, Julio (2019).

        "content": "Helga Wex (née Schimke, July 5, 1924 Buxtehude - January 9, 1986 Mülheim an der Ruhr) was a German CDU politician.\n\n\n== Career ==\nHelga Wex came from a social democratic family; her father Hugo Schimke was active in local politics for the SPD in Buxtehude. After studying philosophy, Helga Wex (Schimke) completed her doctorate in 1950 in Hamburg on the subject of The farewell motif in German love poetry from the Middle Ages to the end of the 18th century. She then completed additional courses of study at the Europa-Kolleg in Bruges and at the Academy of International Law in The Hague.\nFrom 1953 to 1957, Wex was a ministerial advisor in the representation of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia to the federal government. She joined the CDU in 1961 and was a city council member of Mülheim an der Ruhr from 1961 to 1973. She lived there with her husband Günther Wex and their two children.\nShe became a member of the 5th German Bundestag on April 28, 1967, which she left at the end of 1969. She rejoined the Bundestag at the beginning of the 7th parliamentary term in 1972 and remained a member until her death on January 9, 1986, in the 10th parliamentary term. She reached the Bundestag via the state list of the North Rhine-Westphalian CDU.\nFrom 1969 to 1977, she was deputy federal chairwoman of the CDU and, as successor to Aenne Brauksiepe, a member of the executive committee.\nFrom 1971 to 1986, she was Chairwoman of the Women's Association of the CDU, today's Frauen Union. In this office, she declared \"the end of modesty\" for the female section of the CDU and called for greater participation of women in the party. She raised issues such as the compatibility of family and career and fought for the right to submit motions at party conferences for the women's association, which it finally received in 1975.\nIn 1979, she ran against Richard von Weizsäcker for vice-president of the Bundestag within the party, but lost by a clear margin. In 1983, she became deputy chairwoman of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group.\nIn 1984, she became coordinator for German-French relations at the Foreign Office and held this office until her death. In this position, she campaigned for the expansion of reciprocal language teaching in France and Germany.\nDuring the first CDU party donation scandal involving illegal party funding via the Staatsbürgerliche Vereinigung, Helga Wex also encouraged, among others the Gerling Group to donate money directly to her CDU district association in Mülheim an der Ruhr, bypassing the tax office and the federal party.\n\n\n== Honors ==\nGrand Federal Cross of Merit\nHelga-Wex-Platz in Buxtehude\nHelga-Wex-Weg in Mülheim an der Ruhr (December 2022)\n\n\n== Literature ==\nFrank Bösch: Macht und Machtverlust.

        "content": "William Wotherspoon Ireland (27 October 1832 – 17 May 1909) was a Scottish physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nIreland was born at Edinburgh on 27 October 1832. He was the son of Thomas Ireland, a publisher of Edinburgh. Through his father's grandmother he was a lineal descendant of John Knox through Mrs. Welsh, daughter of the reformer. His mother was Mary, daughter of William Wotherspoon, writer to the signet, and first manager and secretary of the Scottish Widows' Life Assurance Society. Ireland was educated at the Edinburgh high school, and afterwards at the university, where he graduated M.D. in 1855. He then studied for a short time at Paris and became resident surgeon at the Dumfries Infirmary. He was appointed an assistant surgeon in the East India Company's service on 4 August 1850, was attached to the Bengal horse artillery, and was present at the siege of Delhi, where he treated the wounds of Lieutenant (now Lord) Roberts. He took part in the battles of Bedli-Ka-Serai and Najafgarh. He was himself wounded by a bullet which destroyed one of his eyes and passed round the base of the skull towards the opposite ear. He also had a second wound though of a less serious character; a ball entered the shoulder and lodged in his back. In the list of casualties in the East India Register and Army List for 1858 he is shown as 'killed before Delhi 26 August 1857.' He received the medal and clasp and was granted three years' furlough counting as service; but after two years' convalescence he was retired from the service with a special pension. After ten years' work, partly spent at Madeira and partly on the continent of Europe, he was from 1869 to 1879 medical superintendent of the Scottish National Institution for Imbecile Children at Larbert. In 1880 he opened a private home for the treatment of cases of arrested mental development, first at Stirling, afterwards at Prestonpans and Polton. In 1905 he was the recipient from his friends of a jubilee gift and an illuminated address presented to him by Dr. T. S. Clouston. He retired to Musselburgh after the death of his wife and died there on 17 May 1909.\nHe married Margaret Paterson in 1861, and left one son and a daughter.\nIreland, a man of striking individuality, became an authority upon idiocy and imbecility. He had a wide knowledge of literature and history and was well acquainted with the French, German, Italian, Spanish, Norse, and Hindustani languages. His most original and interesting work was the application of his medico-psychological knowledge to explain the lives and actions of many celebrated men. These sketches are contained in 'The Blot upon the Brain, Studies in History and Psychology' (Edinburgh, 1885; 2nd edit. 1893; New York, 1886; translated into German, Stuttgart, 1887), where he considers the hallucinations of Mohammed, Luther, and Joan of Arc; the history of the hereditary neurosis of the royal family of Spain, and kindred subjects. A companion volume 'Through the Ivory Gate, Studies in Psychology and History,' Edinburgh, 1889, deals with Emanuel Swedenborg, William Blake, Louis II of Bavaria, Louis Riel, and others. His 'Life of Sir Harry Vane the Younger, with a History of the Events of his Time,' 1905, Is a careful study from original documents.\nBesides the works mentioned, Ireland published:\n\n'A History of the Siege of Delhi by an Officer who served there,' Edinburgh, 1861.\n'Randolph Methyl, a Story of Anglo-Indian Life,' 1863, 2 vols.\n'What Food to eat,' 1865.\n'Studies of a Wandering Observer,' 1867.\n'Idiocy and Imbecility,' 1877, 2nd edit, renamed 'The Mental Affections of Children: Idiocy, Imbecility, and Insanity,' London and Edinburgh, 1898; Philadelphia, 1900.\n'Golden Bullets, a Story of the Days of Akber and Elizabeth,' Edinburgh, 1891.\nTo the 'Journal of Mental Science he contributed literary and psychological studies of Torquato Tasso, Auguste Comte and Friedrich Nietzsche.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Power, D'Arcy (1912). \"Ireland, William Wotherspoon\".

The season began on 5 April and is scheduled to end on 14 October 2024, and the fixtures for the season were drawn on 28 November 2023.\n\n\n== Format ==\n16 teams take part in the competition, which is played under a double round-robin system with teams playing each other twice, once at home and once away for a total of 30 matches. The top two teams at the end of the season will be promoted to the Paraguayan Primera División for the 2025 season, while the bottom three teams in the relegation table at the end of the season will be relegated: teams located within 50 kilometres of Asunción are relegated to Primera División B, while teams from outside Greater Asunción and the Central Department are relegated to Primera División B Nacional.\n\n\n== Teams ==\n\n\n=== Team changes ===\n16 teams compete in the season: 11 teams from the previous División Intermedia season plus the two teams relegated from Primera División in its 2023 season (Guaireña and Resistencia), the 2023 Primera División B champions Tembetary, the 2023 Primera División B Nacional champions 12 de Junio, and the 2022–23 Campeonato Nacional de Interligas champions Encarnación.\n\n\n=== Stadia and locations ===\n\n\n== Standings ==\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n== Relegation ==\nRelegation is determined at the end of the season by computing an average of the number of points earned per game over the past three seasons. The three teams with the lowest average were relegated to Primera División B or Primera División B Nacional for the following season, depending on their geographical location.\n\n Updated to match(es) played on 19 April 2024.

        "content": "Jaiden Kamil Bartolo (born 10 February 2006) is a Gibraltarian footballer who plays as a forward for Wealdstone. Born in England, he represents the Gibraltar national football team at international level.\n\n\n== Club career ==\nBartolo spent his youth playing for various youth teams in Spain, for teams around Cádiz and La Línea de la Concepción just across the border from Gibraltar, before joining Manchester 62. He made his debut for their Gibraltar Intermediate League under-23 team on his 16th birthday, scoring 4 goals as a substitute in a 7–4 win against Lynx under-23. 2 days later, on 12 February 2022, he scored on his first team debut for the Red Devils of Gibraltar, in a 2–0 win against College 1975. He made a further 5 appearances, including a hat-trick against Lynx, as his side won the GFA Challenge Trophy.\nThe next season was spent largely attending trials in the UK, though he returned over winter to play twice for Manchester 62. After reportedly attracting interest from Watford, these trials eventually resulted in a move to Wealdstone in July 2023, to play for their academy. There, his form caught the eye and saw him regularly train with the senior team from August. After scoring 16 goals in 6 games for their under-19 team and 8 goals in 4 games for their under-23 team, on 18 December 2023 it was announced that Bartolo had been offered professional terms and been promoted to the Stones first team, appearing on the bench for the first time on 13 January 2024 in the FA Trophy match against Chelmsford City.\n\n\n== International career ==\nBorn in England to parents of Sri Lankan and Maltese descent and raised in Gibraltar, Bartolo is eligible to represent England, Sri Lanka, Malta and Gibraltar. He made his debut for Gibraltar under-17 on 10 September 2021, scoring in a 2–1 victory over Faroe Islands. He captained them for the first time on 25 August 2022 in a friendly against Liechtenstein, scoring a hat-trick in an 8–2 victory - a record win for Gibraltar at any level since joining UEFA in 2013. His under-21 debut came on 15 June 2023, in a 3–1 defeat to Moldova after playing in an unofficial friendly against Iraq under-20 3 months prior.\nHe received his first call up to the senior team in March 2022's preliminary squad, but was left out of the final squad. He eventually made his full international debut on 26 March 2024, in a 1–0 defeat to Lithuania.\n\n\n== Career statistics ==\n\n\n=== Club ===\nAs of match played on 14 February 2024\n\n\n=== International ===\nAs of match played 26 March 2024.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nManchester 62\nGFA Challenge Trophy: 2021–22\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nBartolo was born in Slough in the United Kingdom, but moved to Gibraltar at the age of 2 when his parents relocated. His younger brother, Kai, is also a footballer who plays alongside him at Wealdstone's academy as well as for Hayes and Yeading United.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Daniel Cox (died January 1750) was a British physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nCox proceeded M.D. at St. Andrews on 8 November 1742, was admitted licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians on 26 June 1749, elected physician to the Middlesex Hospital on 16 October 1746, resigned 23 May 1749, and died in January 1750. He wrote ‘Observations on the Epidemic Fever of 1741, … with Remarks on the use of Cortex,’ published anonymously 1741; ‘with new cases, and on the benefit of the cool method,’ 1742; third edition, ‘with … the benefit of bleeding and purging,’ 1742. Cox is said by Munk to have died in January 1750; if so, he cannot have written, as Munk says, ‘An Appeal to the Public on behalf of Elizabeth Canning’, 1st and 2nd editions 1753; the introduction to Lorenz Heister's ‘Medical and Anatomical Cases,’ 1755; letter on the subject of inoculation, 1757, 1758; and ‘Observations on the Intermittent Pulse,’ 1758. To this Daniel Cox, Munk and the compilers of the catalogue of the Library of the Royal Medical Society attribute ‘Family Medical Compendium,’ published at Gloucester. This appears to be an error; for the ‘Medical Compendium’ seems to have been first published about 1690, and an enlarged and improved edition in 1808, by D. Cox, chemist and druggist, of Gloucester. It is dedicated to Sir Walter Farquhar, and the 1808 edition ends with advertisements of the author's wares.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Henderson, Thomas Finlayson (1886). \"Blackadder, William\".

        "content": "Mike DeGeorge (born 1969 or 1970) is an American basketball coach who is the current head coach of the Cal Poly Mustangs. He played college basketball for the Monmouth Fighting Scots and has previously coached the Beloit Buccaneers, Lawrence Vikings, Grinnell Pioneers, Eureka Red Devils, Cornell, Rhodes Lynx and Colorado Mesa Mavericks.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nDeGeorge was born in Colorado Springs, Colorado, the son of coach Ed DeGeorge. He grew up in Wisconsin. DeGeorge attended Monmouth College in Illinois where he played four years of basketball and two years of golf, helping the basketball team win two conference championships with two NCAA Division III tournament appearances. He received a bachelor's degree in psychology from Monmouth in 1992 and later received a master's degree from Viterbo University in 1999. Prior to his coaching career, DeGeorge spent two years as a teacher, first at Marmion Academy in 1992, and then at Durand High School in 1993, both schools in Illinois.\n\n\n== Coaching career ==\nDeGeorge began his coaching career as an assistant to Bill Knowlton with the Beloit College basketball team in the 1993–94 season. He subsequently was an assistant for the Lawrence Vikings from 1994 to 1999 and for the Grinnell Pioneers from 1999 to 2000. He was the recruiting coordinator at Grinnell and learned the run-and-gun playstyle there, which he utilized later in his career as a head coach.\nDeGeorge received his first head coaching job with the Division III Eureka Red Devils in 2000, serving four seasons in the position. He brought the team from having had a mere two wins the year before he arrived to 17 wins by his final season, which was their best record in over 10 years. DeGeorge then was hired by the Cornell Rams and served with the team from 2004 to 2009, helping them have their first NCAA tournament appearance. He helped the 2008–09 Cornell team win the Iowa Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (IIAC) championship, with DeGeorge being chosen the IIAC's Coach of the Year.\nDeGeorge was hired as the head coach of the Rhodes Lynx in 2010. He served in the position for eight seasons, coming in after the team had recorded 10 straight losing seasons. He helped them share the Southern Athletic Association (SAA) championship in 2012–13 and repeated in 2014–15. He was named the SAA Coach of the Year for the 2016–17 season, in which his team were the national leaders in assists, won the SAA championship, and made their first NCAA Division III Tournament appearance in 24 years.\nIn 2018, DeGeorge became the head coach of the Division II Colorado Mesa Mavericks. They had won 19 games total in the two seasons before his arrival, but he led them to 19 wins in his first season there. He then helped them win consecutive Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference (RMAC) championships in his second and third seasons, which were the first RMAC titles in school history. He ultimately served six seasons with the Mavericks and reached five NCAA tournaments while having an average of 23 wins per season; DeGeorge was the RMAC and NCAA West Region Coach of the Year in 2020–21 (when he helped Colorado Mesa finish the regular season ranked first nationally) and received the RMAC Coach of the Year award a second time for the 2022–23 season.\nIn March 2024, DeGeorge received his first Division I coaching job, being named the head coach of the Cal Poly Mustangs.\n\n\n== Head coaching record ==\n\n\n== References ==",

Japan's first private spaceport, it is operated by Space One, who are using it to launch their solid-fuel rocket KAIROS. As of 26 March 2024, only one launch attempt has been made on the site on 13 March, which ended up being a failure.\n\n\n== Location and construction ==\nSpaceport Kii's location is located near the southernmost tip of Honshu and is only a two-minute (1.9 kilometer) drive from Kii-Uragami Station in Nachikatsuura.\nThe launch site was funded by several Japanese corporations, including Canon Inc., Shimizu Corporation (who also constructed the site), and IHI Corporation. Ground broke on 19 November 2019.\n\n\n== Launches ==\nThe first launch attempt of the KAIROS rocket was scheduled on 8 March 2024, however it was delayed to the 13th due to a ship in too close of proximity. It launched on the 13th, but disintegrated just seconds later.\nSpace One has stated that it plans to have around 20 launches of KAIROS a year.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSpace One official website",

        "content": "The International Film Festival of St Andrews, known in full as Sands: International Film Festival of St Andrews, is an annual film festival held in St Andrews, Scotland. It is co-produced by the Byre Theatre and the Film Studies Department at the University of St Andrews with lead sponsorship from Joe Russo through his production company, AGBO. The festival is a three-day event showcasing international cinema to local, national and international audiences, as well as hosting film-related events and workshops for filmmakers and creators. \n\n\n== History ==\nSince his daughter's enrolment at the university to study film in 2014, Joe Russo had developed affection for Scotland and a close relationship with St Andrews. This included working with the university's film academics to judge student film festivals and delivering guest lectures. Impressed with his experience and engagement with the community, he eventually approached the university to start a film festival.  \n\n\n== Editions ==\n\n\n== Other Film Festivals in St Andrews ==\nThe event is not to be confused with the two student-run film festivals in St Andrews, the St Andrews Film Festival founded in 2018 and the St Andrews Green Film Festival founded in 2013.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "George Darling (1782? – 30 March 1862) was a Scottish physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nDarling born at Stow, near Galashiels, was educated at the university of Edinburgh, and, having made two or three voyages as surgeon in the East India Company's service, settled in London in general practice. At the end of four years he began to practise as a physician, having become a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians in London. He had a considerable intimacy with artists, David Wilkie, Benjamin Haydon, Thomas Lawrence, and Francis Leggatt Chantrey being both his patients and his friends. In 1814 he published anonymously ‘An Essay on Medical Economy,’ which he dedicated to his friend and fellow-countryman Sir James Mackintosh. The title of this ably written book was not well chosen, for it enters into the whole question of medical reform, as regards the education, practice, and status of medical men, and anticipates many of the changes which have since taken place in the profession, such as the establishment of a university in London and the conjoint scheme of medical examination. Darling was of a singularly retiring disposition, and published this essay anonymously. At a later period he interested himself about the making of bread by the disengagement of carbonic acid by chemical means, and printed a pamphlet on the subject, ‘Instructions for Making Unfermented Bread.’ This, like the book just mentioned, was anonymously published. It first appeared in 1846, and the seventeenth edition is dated 1851. He died on 30 March 1862, in his eightieth year.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Dixon, James (1888). \"Darling, George\".

        "content": "The Strisciuglio clan is a criminal organization, originating from the city of Bari, having its stronghold mainly in the northern area of the city. The clan is considered the most powerful and bloodthirsty criminal organization operating in the Bari area.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe criminal organization was born at the late 1990s as an offshoot of another clan operating in Bari, the Capriati clan. From the beginning, the Strisciuglio clan was commanded by Domenico Strisciuglio, nicknamed \"Mimmo la luna\" who is in jail from 1999 in the 41 bis regime. In August 2003, Franco Strisciuglio, Mimmo's brother, was killed in an ambush outside his home, at the age of 33. At that time, Franco was considered the number two in the criminal group, after Mimmo, and consequently the most important free member of the clan. In 2021, Vincenzo Strisciuglio, known as Chachino , another brother of Domenico, was sentenced to 7 years and 4 months in prison.\nAccording to the investigators, due to the very restricted regime in which Domenico Strisciuglio finds himself, the reins of the clan would have passed to his brother Sigismondo, known as Gino, who despite having spent years behind bars, was subjected to a less restricted regime compared to the one of Domenico, which would have allowed him to continue managing the clan's affairs. Gino, in fact, after 22 years in prison was released in 2022, however he was arrested again in April 2023 and released in January 2024.\n\n\n== The clan's activities ==\nAccording to the investigators, the main action that characterizes the clan is its strong expansionist vocation, in particular in the creation of new \"subgroups\", where it can operate with its illicit trafficking and therefore increase the related revenues. Furthermore, the clan's activities are also characterized by an asphyxiating control of the territory which manifests itself through the extortion exercised against numerous small entrepreneurs and artisans. According to the Strisciuglios, they also focus on the activities of the gaming market through the installation of slot machines and video lotteries.\n\n\n== See also ==\nOrganized crime in Italy\nSocietà foggiana\nCapriati clan\n\n\n== References ==",

Her indie rock music is characterized by its emotional stream-of-consciousness lyrics. Francis of Delirium has toured with The 1975, Soccer Mommy, Horsegirl, and Kings of Leon. She is a prominent artist in Luxembourg, where the alternative music scene has historically been relatively inactive, and frequently plays live shows in Europe.\n\n\n=== Lighthouse ===\nFrancis of Delirium released her debut album, Lighthouse, on 22 March 2024 with Dalliance Recordings. Ahead of the album she released four singles: “Real Love”, “First Touch”, “Blue Tuesday”, and the album's closing track \"Give It Back to Me\". Each of the singles for Lighthouse had its own cover art, each of which was a linocut print made by Bahrich.\nPaste described the album as a whole as hopeful and bittersweet, characterizing it as a \"thematically poignant\" and \"sonically captivating\" coming-of-age album and comparing it to Melodrama by Lorde. DIY gave it four out of five stars and described it as a confident debut. \n\nThe album's first track, “Ballet Dancers (Never Love Again)”, was praised by Paste as an \"effortless\" song that gradually builds momentum, and \"one of the best album intros of 2024 to date\". DIY compared it to Weyes Blood. Catherine Marks, who has worked with boygenius, produced the tracks “Real Love” and \"First Touch\". The final song, \"Give It Back to Me\", was praised by DIY as an \"almost cinematic\" conclusion to the album that reflects \"the level of musicality that’s clearly demonstrated throughout\".\nFrancis of Delirium is scheduled to tour Europe and the United Kingdom with her new album in April and May 2024.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Works cited ===",

        "content": "The Capriati clan is a criminal organization, originating from the city of Bari, operating mainly in the historic centre of the city.\n\n\n== History ==\nActive at least since the early 1990s, the criminal organization has historically been led by Antonio Capriati, known as Tonino, currently in prison where he is serving a life sentence.\nThe clan is mainly dedicated to extortion and drug dealing, and for a certain period under the leadership of Tonino's nephews, Filippo and Pietro, the group tried to expand into other areas beyond its stronghold in Bari Vecchia, having also committed thefts in the region of Basilicata. Furthermore, the clan also managed to infiltrate a company that manages internal roads in the Port of Bari, and according to the investigations, the Capriati aimed to infiltrate the economic fabric of the city.\nIn 2018, the then head of the organization, Filippo Capriati, was arrested and sentenced to 16 years in prison. In September 2023, a \"top-down and hierarchical\" structure was dismantled by the Carabinieri, based on the presence of various territorial structures operating under the aegis of the Capriati clan, which allegedly ensured and managed \"upstream\" the trafficking of narcotic substances in the South of the Bari area, in the territories of Putignano, Castellana Grotte, Noci, Alberobello, Locorotondo, Acquaviva delle Fonti. 60 people were arrested in the operation. In October 2023, 600,000 euros were seized from a member of the clan, the man was the \"representative\" of the Capriati clan in the control of the slot machine market and would then have used the clan's sums of money for real estate investments and financial, by registering assets to their trustees.\nIn March 2024, a photo of the then mayor of Bari Antonio Decaro appeared on social medias, with the sister and niece of the boss Antonino Capriati. The photo caused a stir among the population and political parties, who asked the mayor for explanations. After the photo went viral and appeared in national newspapers, the mayor defended himself by saying that he didn't know who they were and after investigating he discovered that despite belonging to the Capriati family, the women are unrelated to the clan's activities, while the niece of the Capriati boss, Annalisa Milzi, denied any relationship between her and her mother and the mayor, claiming that this photo is from the Feast of the Patron Saint Saint Nicholas in 2023, and that it was taken after asking the mayor if she could take a selfie with him. On 25 March 2024 arrived in Bari the access commission of the Interior Ministry, to evaluate hypotheses of mafia infiltration in the city.\n\n\n== See also ==\nOrganized crime in Italy\nSocietà foggiana\nStrisciuglio clan\n\n\n== References ==",

Added sodium acetate acts as an acid scavenger for the hydrogen bromide that is formed. The elemental bromine can also be prepared in situ by oxidizing sodium bromide in an aqueous caffeine solution with hydrogen peroxide. Yields of 85% have been reported.\n\n\n== Properties ==\nThe caffeine derivative is a white and odorless solid with a melting point of 206 °C.\n\n\n== Uses ==\nThe substance acts as a radiomodulator, especially as a radiosensitizer In the radiotherapy of brain tumors, an increased sensitivity of the tumor cells, induced by 8-bromocaffeine, was observed.\n\n\n== References ==",

Wilson reviewed the game for Computer Gaming World, and stated that \"While not perfect, Stellar Conquest definitely has something going for it. It could even become \"addictive,\" if some effort were spent in fixing some of the problems. Some suggested improvements would include: the ability to create a new starbase after having the team's original one blown up; being able to communicate with a named player; and giving the teamless player more power. Even so, Stellar Conquest is worth playing now and could get even better.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Cesáreo Galíndez Sánchez (23 September 1894 – 15 March 1990) was a Spanish businessman and the 17th president of Atlético Madrid between 1947 and 1952. The presidency of Cesáreo Galíndez is considered one of the most fruitful in the club's history because, under his leadership, the club won two league titles and the Copa Eva Duarte. Another of Galíndez's achievements was the creation and consolidation of the club's handball section, one of the most important in the club's history.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nCesáreo Galíndez was born on 23 September 1894 in the Biscayan town of Gordexola, later settling in the capital of Spain, where he became a jeweler industrialist by profession.\nIn 1931, Galíndez joined the board of directors of Atlético Madrid as a member, when Rafael González Iglesias was elected president. Later, and once the Spanish Civil War was over, he became one of the representatives of the club during its merger with Club Aviación Nacional, a process that led to the so-called Club Atlético Aviación, of which Galíndez would be secretary of the Board of Directors since October 1939.\nIn July 1947, Galíndez was appointed as the 17th elected president of the club, which a few months earlier had changed its name to the current Club Atlético de Madrid, after breaking up the ties that linked it to the Air Force. The presidency of Cesáreo Galíndez is considered one of the most fruitful in the club's history because, under his leadership, the club won two league titles in 1949–50 and 1950–51 and the Copa Eva Duarte in 1951. His mandate began during the period of the so-called Delantera de Seda (José Juncosa, Antonio Vidal, Alfonso Silva, Juan Escudero, and Campos), one of the most remembered in athletic history. Other notable players signed during his presidency were Larbi Benbarek (1948) and technicians joined as Helenio Herrera (1949). In fact, when the former played a friendly match for Stade Français at the Metropolitano on 6 May 1948, someone in the box, which many believe to have been the president Galíndez himself, exclaimed: \"We have to sign the black man!\".\nGalíndez created the club's handball section in 1948, back when 11-a-side handball was played on football fields. Atlético were champions of Castilla twice in 1949 and 1950, and the runners-up of the Spanish Championship three years between 1949 and 1951. Starting in 1952, indoor handball began to be played in Spain with seven players and Atlético were champions of Castilla in 1952 and of Spain in 1952 and 1954. It has since won 11 Spanish Leagues and 10 Spanish Cups between 1952 and 1987.\nAnother of Galíndez's achievements came in April 1950, when Atlético acquired ownership of the Metropolitan Stadium, where it had been playing its matches since 1923. The club paid eleven million eight hundred thousand pesetas for it, which meant the consolidation of its assets for the club.\nOn 16 June 1952, Galíndez ran for new elections to revalidate his mandate, with the aim of addressing the remodeling and reform of the Metropolitan, but he lost them to his treasurer Luis Benitez de Lugo, Marquis of Florida, who got 2.795 votes against Galíndez's 2.488.\nCesáreo Galíndez served as vice president of the Royal Spanish Football Federation between 1954 and 1956, during the presidency of the former president of Atlético de Madrid, Juan Touzón.\n\n\n== Death ==\nGalíndez died in Madrid on 15 March 1990, at the age of 95.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "John Ford Davis (1773 –  1 January 1864) was an English physician. He was also mayor of Bath in 1830.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nDavis was born at Bath in 1773, and, after education at the school of the Rev. Edward Spencer, studied medicine, first in London and afterwards in Edinburgh, where he graduated M.D. on 24 June 1797 (Dissertation). He became a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians of London on 30 September 1808, and soon after began practice at Bath. He was elected physician to the General Hospital there in 1817, and held the office for seventeen years. He died at Bath on 1 January 1864. His published works are his graduation thesis, ‘Tentamen Chemico-Medicum inaugurale de Contagio,’ Edinburgh, 1797, and ‘An Inquiry into the Symptoms and Treatment of Carditis or the Inflammation of the Heart,’ Bath, 1808. The thesis is based upon Isbrand van Diemerbroeck's well-known treatise on the plague, on James Carmichael Smyth's ‘Jail Distemper,’ and on several of the chemical works of that time. It contains no original observation on fever, and, excepting two or three chemical conjectures, is a mere compilation. A copy in the library of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society of London has an inscription to Dr. Bostock in the fine pointed handwriting of the author. The book on carditis shows a good deal of reading, but contains only three cases, the last of which alone was observed by Davis himself. The book is, however, interesting as showing what, and how very little, was known of diseases of the heart ten years before the publication of the first edition of Laennec's treatise on auscultation. The anatomical appearances of pericarditis are exactly described, and, though the passages on diagnosis are of course imperfect, it is clear that a great advance in knowledge had been made since Mead, in 1748, had written all that he knew of heart disease upon a single page.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Moore, Norman (1888). \"Davis, John Ford\".

        "content": "Udelartitan is an extinct genus of saltasauroid titanosaurian sauropod dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous Guichón Formation of Uruguay. The genus contains a single species, U. celeste, known from fragmentary remains of at least two individuals.\n\n\n== Discovery and naming ==\nThe Udelartitan fossil material was discovered in 2006 within sediments of the Guichón Formation (Araújo locality), near Quebracho in Paysandú Department, Uruguay. The holotype specimen, FC-DPV 3595, consists of the first three caudal vertebrae in approximate articulation. Additional bones representing an older individual (specimen FC-DPV 1900), including sixty caudal vertebrae, an incomplete left coracoid, the proximal and distal ends of the tibiae the proximal end of the fibula, six metatarsals, and two astragali, were also referred to Udelartitan. Many of the bones of the referred specimen were preliminarily described by Soto, Perea & Cambiaso in 2012, who also identified several purported osteoderms. However, Soto et al. (2024) found no evidence to support this assessment, arguing that they can more confidently be described as concretions.\nIn 2024, Soto et al. described Udelartitan celeste as a new genus and species of titanosaur sauropod based on these fossil remains. The generic name, Udelartitan, combines \"UdelaR\", an acronym for the Universidad de la República (whose collection of vertebrae fossils includes those assigned to Udelartitan), with the word \"titan\", a common suffix for giant sauropod names, referencing the pre-Olympian gods of Greek mythology. The specific name, celeste, is a Spanish word for sky blue, referencing the nickname given to some Uruguayan athletic teams.\n\n\n== Description ==\nBased on other titanosaurs known from more complete skeletons, Soto et al. (2024) suggest that Udelartitan was about 15–16 metres (49–52 ft) in body length.\n\n\n== Classification ==\nIn their preliminary description of some of the Udelartitan fossil material in 2012, Soto, Perea & Cambiaso used the general morphology of the caudal vertebrae and astragalus to suggest that it likely belonged to a derived lithostrotian titanosaur—likely a non-saltasaurine saltasaurid—related to Pellegrinisaurus, Baurutitan, and Alamosaurus. They further cautioned that the Saltasauridae clade has historically had a very variable composition, comprising either very few or many species, depending on the analyses performed.\nIn 2024, Soto et al. used phylogenetic analyses to find the most likely position for Udelartitan within the Titanosauria. Similar to the previous work, they found support for a position within the Saltasauroidea. They used two data-matrices  to assess the phylogenetic position of Udelartitan, and recovered it either as a non-saltasaurid saltasauroid or a basal saltasaurine. Their results are displayed in the cladograms below:\n\n\n== Palaeoenvironment ==\n\nUdelartitan is known from the Late Cretaceous Guichón Formation of Uruguay. The exact age of this formation is uncertain. Some authors have historically suggested a Lower Cretaceous (Aptian–Albian) age due to similarities with the Migues Formation. However, the overlying Mercedes Formation dates to the Campanian–Maastrichtian ages of the Upper Cretaceous, so this would introduce a significant gap in time. The discovery of dinosaur eggshells in the formation similar to Sphaerovum prompted later researchers to favor a Late Cretaceous age for the Guichón Formation.\nOther fossils from the Guichón Formation include several specimens of Uruguaysuchus—a crocodyliform closely related to Araripesuchus—as well as the teeth of indeterminate iguanodontians and theropods. The younger Asencio Formation of Uruguay also contains titanosaur specimens, including the centrum of a caudal vertebra referred to Aeolosaurus sp.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ivey Dickson  (1 November 1919 – 8 November 2014) was a British pianist, music examiner and the second musical director of the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain from 1966 until 1984.\nDickson was born in Filton, Bristol, and started playing piano at the age of three. By 14 she had won over 200 prizes at festivals across the country. She studied at the Royal Academy of Music. In 1938 she appeared at Queen's Hall as soloist in the Emperor Concerto with Sir Henry Wood conducting, leading to five appearances at the Proms, including a performance of Alexander Mackenzie's Scottish Concerto at the Last Night in 1943 when she was still only 23. Her first solo recital was given at the Wigmore Hall in June 1940. During the war she gave recitals at the National Gallery and toured the country with a series of lecture recitals for the forces with baritone Hervey Alan.\nAfter the war Dickson became a music teacher at Clifton High School in Bristol, and later at St Felix School, Southwold. In 1960 she joined the staff of the Royal Academy of Music and became an examiner for the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music, travelling internationally. As an accompanist she performed with Dennis Brain, Léon Goossens, Frederick Thurston and others. She married Jack Stoddart in 1962.\nDickson first became involved with the National Youth Orchestra from its inception in 1948 as a woodwind coach. In 1966 she took on the role of musical director, following on from its founder and her friend, Dame Ruth Railton. She auditioned candidates for the orchestra around the country and emphasized the training function of the orchestra, moving players gradually up the orchestral ranks until they were ready to take on more demanding soloist roles. She broadened the repertoire to cover the 20th Century, including performances of Stravinsky, Bartok and Shostakovich.\nBy the end of the 1960s Dickson was living at 40, Avondale Avenue, Worcester Park in Surrey. She was appointed OBE in 1979. She retired from the orchestra in 1984 and was succeeded by Derek Bourgeois. Her husband died in 1990. Dickson died in Surrey in November 2014 at the age of 95.\n\n\n== References ==",

It was built from 131 to 121 BC as part of the Via Popilia, which led from Reggio Calabria to Capua, to cross the river Savuto.\nIt was built in two arches with stone from a nearby quarry. It has a width of 3.45 m, height of 11 m and length of about 25 m.\nThe bridge is thought to have been destroyed by the Romans themselves during Carthaginian commander Hannibal's campaign against Rome in the Second Punic War, to stop his escape towards his ships at sea. It was rebuilt with the same building material and in the same form by Hannibal for the passage of his army.\nIt is one of the oldest bridges in Italy together with the Pons Fabricius on the Tiber island (69 BC) and the Pons Aemilius (179 BC).\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2002 Winter Paralympics torch relay, known as the Journey of Fire, was held between March 1 and March 7, leading up to the 2002 Winter Paralympics in Salt Lake City, Utah, United States. Paralympic flames were lit in 15 Utah cities and merged in Salt Lake City, with the resulting fire then carried around the city to the opening ceremony on March 7.\n\n\n== Relay ==\n\nPlans for the Paralympic torch relay were announced on December 12, 2001. Initially, 16 Utah cities were announced as planning to host flame lighting ceremonies, but North Ogden's ceremony was later canceled.\nThe Paralympic flame was lit in 15 separate ceremonies in various Utah cities, using a variety of means. With no standardized procedure like the lighting of the Olympic flame at Olympia, Greece, Salt Lake Organizing Committee president Mitt Romney encouraged the various communities to ignite their fires in their own unique ways. For example, the flame in Springville was lit by a \"mountain man\" capable of igniting a fire with his bare hands in six seconds. At the Salt Lake County Ice Center in Murray, Canadian sledge hockey captain Todd Nicholson activated the flame by scoring a goal.\nThe first flame was lit on Friday, March 1 in Woods Cross, with additional lighting ceremonies taking place later the same evening in Brigham City, American Fork, and Moab. Four more flames were ignited on March 2, in Heber City, Kaysville, Cedar City, and Sandy. On March 4, another four flames were lit in Park City, St. George, Layton, and West Valley City. The final three flames were lit on March 5 in Murray, Centerville, and Springville.\nOn the evening of March 6, the 15 community flames were merged into a single cauldron in front of the Salt Lake City and County Building. The torch run began the following morning, taking the flame past the Delta Center and the Utah State Capitol, through Liberty Park, and to Shriners Hospital on its way to the opening ceremony at Rice–Eccles Stadium. The 100 torchbearers who ran across the city included Utah savant Kim Peek, who inspired the film Rain Man. The flame was brought into the stadium by Erik Weihenmayer, the first blind person to climb Mount Everest, and his guide dog. Weihenmayer passed the torch to skiers Muffy Davis and Chris Waddell, who lit the cauldron.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Fiona Pender is an Irish woman who disappeared from her home in Tullamore, County Offaly on 23 August 1996 at the age of 25. She was seven months pregnant at the time of her disappearance. Gardaí suspect she was murdered.\n\n\n== Background ==\nFiona Pender was the only daughter of Sean and Josephine Pender and she had two brothers, Mark and John. Mark passed away in 1995. Prior to her disappearance Fiona had worked as hairdresser and as a model. She had lived in Croydon, London for a time where she worked in a hotel before returning to Ireland.\nShe was living with her partner, John Thompson, in a flat in Tullamore, County Offaly at the time of her disappearance. She was seven months pregnant.\n\n\n== Disappearance ==\nOn the day before her disappearance, Fiona had spent the day with her mother where they went shopping for baby clothes. She was described as being happy and looking forward to the birth of her child.\nOn 23 August 1996 Fiona was last seen at 6am by her partner John at their home on Church Street, Tullamore when he left to work on his family farm. A friend of Fiona's visited the home later that day but received no answer at the door. She was reported missing the following day.\n\n\n== Investigation ==\nNumerous searches for Fiona were conducted including searches of the Grand Canal and Tullamore River. Searches for Fiona included Garda sub-aqua units, Air Corps helicopters, members of the civil defence, and tracker dogs. All maternity units in Ireland and the UK were notified of Fiona's disappearance as she was pregnant at the time of her disappearance. To date, not trace of Fiona or her baby have been found.\nFiona's partner, John Thompson, along with his three sisters and father were arrested for questioning by Gardaí in April of 1997. They were released without charge. John Thompson was identified as a suspect in the case. John Thompson married in 2004. It was reported that he moved to Canada in 2012.\nIn May 2008, a makeshift cross was found in Monicknew woods in the Slieve Bloom mountains reading \"Fiona Pender. Buried here, August 22nd, 1996.\" This discovery lead to searches in the area for Fiona but nothing was found. However, Gardaí do not believe the cross was placed there as a hoax. Gardaí noted that the cross stated that Fiona was buried on the 22nd, despite her being reported last seen on the 23rd.\nIn 1999, Gardaí included Fiona Pender in Operation Trace, an inquiry into a number of high-profile disappearances of women in the 1990s.\nIn 2014 it was reported that the main suspect in Fiona's disappearance was arrested abroad. It was also reported that the current partner of the main suspect in Fiona's disappearance was cooperating with Gardaí. The woman told police in the country she now resides in that her partner had threatened her and claimed to have killed Fiona. This information led to further searches for Fiona that ultimately did not recover her body.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nFiona Pender's disappearance was highly publicized in Ireland and often included in connection with disappearances collectively known as Ireland's Vanishing Triangle.\nIn 2014, a memorial and walking trail were created to commemorate Fiona Pender in Offaly. Fiona's Way is 4.5km walk along the canal in Tullamore. In 2022, Ashling Murphy was murdered while jogging on Fiona's Way.\nIn 2016, Fiona's mother Josephine revealed that Fiona's father Sean had died by suicide as he struggled to cope with the loss of Fiona, her baby, and his son Mark who had died a year before Fiona's disappearance.\n\n\n== Media ==\nFiona Pender's disappearance was highly publicised and covered in the true crime books Missing by Barry Cummins, Missing, Presumed by Alan Bailey, and The Vanishing Triangle by Claire McGowan.\nHer disappearance was also covered on multiple occassions on Crimecall, an Irish television show which seeks public assistance in solving unsolved crimes. It was also featured in the documentary television series Six Silent Killings: Ireland’s Vanishing Triangle.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Thomas Davies (1792 – 30 May 1839) was a Welsh physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nDavies was born in 1792 in Carmarthenshire, and, after some schooling in London, was apprenticed to his maternal uncle, then apothecary to the London Hospital. He became an apothecary, and practised at the east end of London, but after two years had symptoms of phthisis. He went to Montpellier for his health, and afterwards to Paris, where he learned the then new art of auscultation, under René Laennec, its inventor. He graduated M.D. at Paris 8 December 1821, came back to London, was admitted a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians 30 September 1824, and began practice at 30 New Broad Street, London, as a physician. He lectured at his house on diseases of the lungs and heart, and explained all he had learned from Laennec. The lectures brought him professional repute, and he was elected the first assistant physician to the London Hospital 5 December 1827, and became a fellow of the College of Physicians 4 July 1838. He was made lecturer on the practice of physic at the London Hospital, and printed in the ‘London Medical Gazette’ a course of lectures on diseases of the chest, which he published in an octavo volume of more than five hundred pages in 1835, entitled ‘Lectures on the Diseases of the Lungs and Heart.’ The book shows that its author had mastered and tested for himself all the observations of Laennec and of Hope, but he added nothing to what they had taught, and though he writes at length on pericarditis, and had examined many examples post mortem, he was ignorant of the existence of a pericardial friction-sound in such cases. He was married and had several children, but his chest disease returned, and he died of it 30 May 1839. He used habitually to say to his patients ‘Keep up your spirits,’ and had sad experience of the need for such advice in his own last illness, when he suffered much from mental depression. He was buried in the churchyard of St. Botolph's, Bishopsgate.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Moore, Norman (1888). \"Davies, Thomas (1792-1839)\".

The song will be featured on her upcoming EP, No Hard Feelings.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\"Stealin' Love\" was first teased in June 2023, during an interview with British Vogue, after Leigh-Anne spoke about her challenges with motherhood and revealed some details about her debut album. The song was originally set to be included where she said:\"It's about somebody stealing love away from you – you give so much and they're taking it and not giving enough in return. There's stuff that I'm going to be unveiling about our relationship that's scary. I'm getting married, he's the love of my life, but we've been through shit. Fully showing something for what it is is a really vulnerable thing to do and that does petrify me, but at the same time, it's life. Relationships are frickin' hard work. If something is good enough to fight for then that's the main thing\".In March 2024, she announced a separate music project that was different to her upcoming solo album. It would feature five tracks which would \"fit together in their own world\". \"Stealin' Love\" was first teased across her social media pages where she explained that the song had seen so many different versions since it was first written in 2020. A visualiser for the track along with an additional video of Leigh-Anne performing choreography with a dancer was released.\n\n\n== Composition ==\n\"Stealin' Love\" has been described as a R&B and electropop track, with lyrics exploring themes of love and growth.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "A building fire in Luliang City broke out at around 6:50 a.m. on November 16, 2023 in the Yongju Coal Industry Joint Construction Building, Shanxi Province, Lishi District, People's Republic of China. The building on fire has four floors, and the fire point is located in the bathroom on the second floor. As of the afternoon of the same day, the number of people killed rose to 26, and 38 people were injured. A total of 70 people were evacuated in the accident. The cause of the fire is under investigation, it is reported that the fire started from the locker room hanging basket.\nThe People's Republic of China officially called it \"'Yongju Coal Industry Office Building“ 11.16 ”Major Fire Accident\"'.\n\n\n== Background and experience ==\nYongju Coal Industry is a private enterprise under Luliang Dongtai Group, with an approved production capacity of 1.5 million tons per year, and is mainly engaged in coal mining, washing and sales.The company has been involved in a number of labor dispute litigation cases, and problems were found in two random inspections in 2018 and 2019.\nThe fire occurred in the Lianjian Building of the enterprise. It has four floors on the ground and is a reinforced concrete frame structure with a total construction area of 6,920 square meters. The first floor is the comprehensive service area for workers, the second floor is the staff bathroom, the third floor is the office area for management personnel, and the fourth floor is the dispatch center. The fire point is located in the bathroom on the second floor.\nThe bathhouses of coal mine workers use hanging baskets to place miners' clothes. There are many flammable substances such as cotton overalls and coal dust carried on the clothes in the hanging basket, and at the same time, there is sufficient oxygen, which has a greater risk of fire. And the bottom of the hanging basket is very high from the ground, usually on the roof, making it more difficult to extinguish the fire. At the beginning of the fire, the employees extinguished the fire on their own. Most of the people were unknown and no people were evacuated.\n\n\n== Government response ==\nOn November 17, the Safety Commission of the State Council supervised the investigation and handling of the fire accident in Luliang, Shanxi.\n13 people, including the actual controller, main person in charge, and other responsible persons of Luliang Yongju Coal Industry, were taken into criminal compulsory measures.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "SS Vigilancia was a merchant steamship that was built in Pennsylvania in 1890. She sailed between New York and Brazil via the West Indies until 1893, when her original owners went bankrupt. The New York and Cuba Mail Steamship Company, commonly known as Ward Line, owned her from 1894 until 1914, and ran her between New York and Mexico via Cuba. In 1898 she was a troopship in the Spanish–American War.\nVigilancia was a passenger and cargo ship until 1915, when she was bought by a company in Georgia to export US cotton to Germany. In 1916 she was bought by a new company that exported US trucks to the Entente Powers. In March 1917 a U-boat sank her in the North Atlantic, killing 15 of her crew, including six US citizens. This is one of several German attacks on US merchant ships that helped to provoke the US to declare war on Germany.\n\n\n== Building ==\nIn 1890 the Delaware River Iron Ship Building and Engine Works of Chester, Pennsylvania built a pair of sister ships for the United States and Brazil Steam Ship Company. They were named Seguranca and Vigilancia, meaning \"Security\" and \"Vigilance\". Vigilancia was said to have cost between $400,000 and $450,000.\nVigilancia was built as yard number 259 and launched on 17 September 1890. She was of mixed iron and steel construction. Her registered length was 321.3 ft (97.9 m), her beam was 45.3 ft (13.8 m), and her depth was 27.3 ft (8.3 m). Her tonnages were 4,115 GRT and 2,934 NRT. As built, she had berths for 160 passengers: 118  in first class, and 42 in steerage.\nShe had a single screw, driven by a three-cylinder triple-expansion engine that was rated at 339 NHP or 2,900 ihp. She had two funnels, two masts, and was rigged as a barquentine.\n\n\n== United States – Brazil service ==\nThe US and Brazil SS Co registered Vigilancia in New York. Her US official number was 161643 and her code letters were KHSN. By December 1891 her route was between New York and Río de la Plata via St Thomas in the Danish West Indies; Barbados; and ports in Brazil. By 1892 the US and Brazil SS Co was offering fortnightly sailings between New York and Brazil, and Vigilancia's ports of call included Santos; Montevideo; Buenos Aires, and Rosario. By 1893 she also served Martinique.\nIn December 1892 Vigilancia passed a trial for a contract to carry mail between the US and Brazil. The contract required her to maintain 12 knots (22 km/h). She achieved 13.89 knots (25.7 km/h) with 1,500 tons of cargo in her holds.\n\n\n=== Bankruptcy, seizure and sale ===\n\nIn April 1893 the US and Brazil SS Co went bankrupt, and its five ships were seized in lieu of debts to suppliers and unpaid wages to crew. EH Ludlow and Company bought four of them at auction, including Vigilancia for $81,000 and Seguranca for $125,000.\nOn 1 November 1893 it was reported that the Brazilian Government had bought ten US merchant ships to convert into auxiliary cruisers to fight against the Revolta da Armada. They included Seguranca, Vigilancia, and three other former US and Brazil SS Co steamships.\n\n\n== Ward Line ==\n\nIn 1894 Ward Line bought both Seguranca and Vigilancia. By December 1894 Vigilancia's route was between New York, Tampico, and Progreso via Havana, Cuba. By October 1896 Vigilancia's ports of call included Vera Cruz. On 1 November Fitzhugh Lee, US Consul-General, left Havana for New York aboard her.\nOn 11 June 1897 Vigilancia was steaming from Havana to New York when a passenger in her second-class accommodation died. He was buried at sea. There was no ship's doctor aboard, and the cause of death was unknown. When the ship reached New York on 14 June, 11 passengers from second class were quarantined on Hoffman Island as a precaution against yellow fever.\n\n\n=== Troopship ===\nIn the Spanish–American War in 1898 Vigilancia was converted into Transport No. 23, with capacity for 45 officers and 800 enlisted men. On 14 June that year she left Tampa carrying the 71st New York Infantry Regiment. She arrived off Cuba on 22 June, and disembarked her troops at Siboney two days later. On 24 August that year she left Pacific Street, Brooklyn carrying 875 men of the 23rd Regiment, Kansas Volunteers. This was an African-American regiment, with an African-American commander, Colonel James Beck. She had rough weather on the voyage, and disembarked her troops at Santiago de Cuba on 31 August. On 6 September she left Santiago carrying 140 soldiers who were described as \"convalescents\". Three of them died at sea. Two were buried at sea, and the third was brought ashore for burial on land. On 13 September she disembarked her troops at Camp Wikoff at Montauk, Long Island. 12 of her patients were brought ashore on stretchers.\n\n\n=== San Ciriaco hurricane ===\nOn 9 August 1899 Vigilancia left New York with 50 or 60 passengers. On 12 August she ran into the San Ciriaco hurricane. She hove to for two days, then turned north to get out of the storm. She then sighted the Morgan Line steamship Winifred, which was disabled with her engine room flooded, superstructure damaged, and her funnel and lifeboats lost. Vigilancia towed Winifred to Nassau, Bahamas, where the pair arrived on 18 August. Vigilancia had been due in Havana on 13 August, and since 15 August there had been fears that she had foundered in the hurricane.\n\n\n=== Aground off Cuba ===\nOn 10 January 1901 Vigilancia left Vera Cruz for New York via Progreso and Havana. On 15 January she grounded in fog on a reef called Los Colorados, about 80 nautical miles (150 km) west of Havana, and 6 nautical miles (11 km) from land. She was lying in 11 feet (3 m) of water forward and 14 feet (4 m) aft. Her boilers were displaced, but she was not leaking. Another Ward Line steamship, Orizaba, went to her aid; took off the passengers, cattle and cargo she was carrying were taken off; and landed the 58 passengers at Havana. By 17 January a high north wind and heavy rain were pounding Vigilancia, and it was feared she would be wrecked. She was on the reef until 3 June, when she was refloated and towed to Havana.\n\n\n=== Two fires ===\nOn 12 May 1906 Vigilancia was en route from New York to Havana, carrying 62 passengers, when a fire was discovered in her cargo hold. She was near Cape Lookout Lightship at the time, and a boat from the lightship went alongside her. Her stores were destroyed, and her cargo was badly damaged by flooding her holds to extinguish the fire. She reached Havana on 15 May, a day late.\nBy 1909 Vigilancia's ports of call included Guantánamo, Manzanillo, and Santiago. At 11:55 hrs on 25 July 1909 she reached New York from the West Indies and Cuba; docked at Pier 18 at the foot of Joralemon Street; and disembarked 54 passengers. At 15:20 hrs her Second Officer discovered a fire in one of her forward holds. By 1909 she was equipped with wireless telegraphy, so her wireless operator transmitted a distress signal to call the New York City Fire Department.\n\nThe fireboats Abram S. Hewitt and David A. Boody fought the fire, pouring water into her forward holds. Engine Company 124 also fought the fire, along with a dozen men of the Fourth Division of the United States Navy Reserve's Second Naval Battalion, who arrived in a launch. Later, Seth Low relieved Abram S. Hewitt. Eventually Vigilancia was afire from amidships to her bow, listing to starboard because of the water the firefighters poured into her, and her masts and one of her funnels collapsed. At 21:30 hrs she broke her after mooring line, sank in 24 feet (7 m) of water, and righted herself as she settled on the bottom. By October 1909 Vigilancia had been raised and repaired, and was back in service.\n\n\n=== Rescuing Atlas passengers ===\n\nBy July 1911, Seguranca and Vigilancia's scheduled route was between New York and Tampico in Mexico, via Nassau. On 22 November 1911 the Hamburg America Line ship Prinz Joachim grounded off Samana Cay in the Bahamas. Seguranca rescued her 84 passengers and took them to Nassau. There, all but eight of them transferred to Vigilancia, which took them to Jamaica.\nBy 1912 Vigilancia's ports of call included Cienfuegos. By 1914 her wireless call sign was KWV. In September 1914 she was still in Ward Line service.\n\n\n== Cotton to Germany ==\nBy January 1915 Walker, Armstrong & Co had bought Vigilancia, registered her in Savannah, and had her converted into a cargo-only ship to export cotton to Europe. Walker, Armstrong & Co had bought several ships, and planned a regular service between Savannah and Europe. A different shipowner, Edward N Breitung, was negotiating to buy Seguranca for the same purpose.\n\nOn 22 February Vigilancia left Savannah with her first cargo of cotton for Bremen in Germany. She bore neutrality markings, including the Flag of the United States painted prominently on both sides of her hull, and a large US flag suspended between her foremast and mainmast. The next day a mine sank Carib, another of Walker, Armstrong's ships, off the German island of Norderney in the North Sea. Walker, Armstrong routed Vigilancia around the north of Scotland into the North Sea, claiming that this was to avoid minefields. By 10 March a Royal Navy cruiser had intercepted her and taken her to Kirkwall in Orkney to inspect her cargo. Another US ship carrying cotton to Germany, Pass of Balmaha, was likewise detained. The British inspected the cargo of both ships, and then allowed them to continue.\n\n\n== Trucks to the Entente ==\nIn June 1916 the Gaston, Williams and Wigmore Steamship Corporation (GW&W) bought Vigilancia. She was registered in Wilmington, Delaware.\nGW&W had been founded in October 1914 with the support of the Guaranty Trust Company. It planned cargo-only services, both transatlantic between New York and Archangelsk; and transpacific between San Francisco and the Far East. By February 1916 GW&W claimed to have bought six ships, chartered another six, and ordered six new ones to be built. GW&W shipped large numbers of US-built motor vehicles to the Entente Powers, including Packard and Peerless trucks. By October 1916 GW&W was operating the Globe Steamship Company, with five ships, and GW&W stock was listed by the New York Stock Exchange. In December 1916 GW&W paid its staff a 10 percent bonus. In February 1917 GW&W bought 35, 37 and 39 Broadway, on which to build a new six-storey headquarters.\nOn 13 November 1916 Vigilancia reached Norfolk, Virginia from Bordeaux, France. On 9 January 1917 she left Lisbon, Portugal, for New York, where she was due on 23 January.\n\n\n== Loss ==\nDespite US neutrality, the Central Powers sank a number of US merchant ships. On 1 February 1917 Germany announced it was resuming unrestricted submarine warfare. On 3 February U-53 captured and scuttled the cargo ship Housatonic, and on 12 February U-35 did the same to the schooner Lyman M. Law. On 26 February President Woodrow Wilson addressed both houses of Congress, asking for the power to arm US merchant ships defensively, and to give those ships gunners to crew them. Also on 26 February, Vigilancia was due to leave New York for Le Havre in France. Just after she left her pier, 35 members of her crew of 45 refused to sail; went over her side; and boarded a tug to return to shore, because her owners refused to pay war bonuses of 75 percent for deck crew and 100 percent for engine room crew.\nVigilancia left New York on 28 February. Her Master was a Captain Frank A Middleton, and her crew had 43 or 45 members (sources differ). 20 including Captain Middleton were US citizens; another five were Puerto Ricans; and the crew also included at least four other nationalities. She carried a cargo of sugar and other foods, and had orders to sail via São Miguel in the Azores, where she was to bunker if necessary. Her neutrality markings included her name and \"NEW YORK\" painted on both sides of her hull in white letters five feet high, was well as the US flag painted on both sides of her hull.\nAt 10:00 hrs on 16 March 1917 Vigilancia was in the Southwestern Approaches, making about 11 knots (20 km/h), when U-70 fired a torpedo at her without warning. It missed, passing astern of her. Between seven and ten minutes later U-70 fired a second torpedo, which hit her starboard side in way of her Number 3 cargo hatch. Her crew lowered two lifeboats, but one of them capsized, throwing 25 men into the sea. Their shipmates in the other lifeboat rescued ten of the men, but the other 15 drowned. The capsizing was variously attributed to a heavy swell, or to there being no time to stop her engine before abandoning ship, so she was still under way when her boats were launched. The ship sank 145 nautical miles (269 km) west of Bishop Rock at position 48°57′N 9°34′W.\nThe survivors were in the lifeboat for about 36 hours. Hypothermia paralysed one of the engine room staff. At night Captain Middleton fired several distress flares. These elicited no response, so at 16:00 hrs on 18 March the lifeboat reached St Mary's, Isles of Scilly by the survivors' own effort. The US Consul at Plymouth, England reported that the dead were five US citizens, five Spaniards, two Greeks, one Peruvian, one Puerto Rican, and one Venezuelan.\n\n\n== Context and consequences ==\n\nOn 17 March, the day after Vigilancia was sunk, U-boats stopped and sank to the cargo ship City of Memphis and the tanker Illinois. In those two cases the U-boats had followed surfaced; forced the ship to heave to; and allowed the crew to abandon her without loss of life before sinking her. However, one of the five lifeboats that City of Memphis launched became separated from the others. For at least 24 hours this caused fear that its occupants must have died or been captured. Three sinkings within two days, added to earlier sinkings such as the cargo ship Algonquin on 12 March, had an effect on public and political opinion in the US. Newspapers called it an act of war, or words to that effect.\n\nIn Germany, writing in the Deutsche Tageszeitung, the former naval officer Ernst Graf zu Reventlow welcomed the sinkings. \"It is good that American ships have been obliged to learn that the German prohibition is effective and that there is no question of distinctive treatment for the United States...\". The Dusseldorfer General Anzieger was also said to have welcomed the sinkings. About the same time as Reventlow's comments were published, either a U-boat or a mine sank the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey's tanker Healdton on 21 March. 21 members of her crew were killed, including seven US citizens.\nOn 2 April, President Wilson asked Congress to declare war against Germany. During the congressional debate of the proposal, news came that a U-boat had sunk Aztec, causing the death of 28 of her crew, including 11 US citizens. On 6 April, Congress passed the motion by an overwhelming majority, and the US declared war on Germany.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBureau of Navigation (1917).

The Taliban-led government of Afghanistan also rejects Afghan involvement in the attack.\nThis was the third attack on Chinese interests in Pakistan in the past week, as a Pakistani naval base and a port used by China were also attacked by Baloch separatists. The Chinese Embassy in Pakistan told Chinese nationals in Pakistan to stay alert.\nAftab Khan Sherpao, Central Chairman of Qaumi Watan Party, expressed concern in a tweet, saing that the attack was \"proof of the rising tide of terrorism.\"\nOn 29 March, Chinese investigators arrived in Pakistan to join a probe into the attack.\nOn 1 April, Pakistani police said that they had arrested 12 people in connection with the attack.\n\n\n== See also ==\n2021 Upper Kohistan bombing\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Luis Juan Francisco Benítez de Lugo y Ascanio Enrich (10 March 1916 – 21 December 2008) was a Spanish athlete who presided over a total of 17 National Federations, including Swimming (1968–1972). He founded and directed around thirty companies and societies, but he is best known for being the 18th president of Atlético Madrid between 1952 and 1955.\nHe held the noble title of Marquis of Florida.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nLuis Benitez de Lugo was born on 10 March 1916 in Madrid, as the son of Luis Benítez de Lugo y Brier, 8th Marquis of Florida, and his wife Juana de Jesús de Ascanio y García. His family was of Canarian descent and possessed several noble titles, including, among others, the marquisate of Florida since 1685, which was given by King Charles II of Spain to Don Francisco del Hoyo y Calderón Lugo y Benítez de Vergara, Perpetual Ruler of Tenerife.\n\n\n== Military career ==\nBenítez de Lugo began his law studies in the mid-1930s, but when the Spanish Civil War broke out, his activism in the Falange made him take refuge in the French embassy to save his life. After fleeing Madrid, he joined the rebel side, in which he fought as a provisional second lieutenant (Alférez provisional), in the Tabor de Regulares, Mérida, Palma, and Cádiz, being wounded in the battles of Teruel and Ebro, obtaining various decorations, such as the collective military medal and the medal of suffering for the Fatherland.\nAfter the war, Benítez de Lugo held several positions related to his military character, successively those of president of the Brotherhood of Provisional Ensigns of the Canary Islands and founding president of the National Brotherhood of Provisional Ensigns, founding president of the European Confederation of Ex-combatants, co-founder of the National Confederation of Ex-Combatants and, since 1999, the president of the later. He was a Knight Legionary of Honor and was in possession, among other decorations, of the Grand Cross of Military Merit.\n\n\n== Sporting career ==\nDuring his youth, Benítez de Lugo stood out as a great athlete, standing out as a top-class tennis player, being a champion of the Copa del Rey de tenis in 1946 and 1947, at the age of 30 and 31. During this period, one of his ball boys was the future US Open champion Manuel Santana. He was also a prominent international swimmer and hockey player. He also played football as a starter in the Madrid Law School team, which Santiago Bernabéu was then coaching, with whom he obtained the title of Spanish Champion in 1935.\nIn 1949, Benítez de Lugo, at the time treasurer and member of Atlético Madrid, played a crucial role in the creation of UD Las Palmas when he mediated with the Castilian Federation, who was the most reluctant to the incorporation of the club. He was present on the day the club was founded on 22 August 1949, in which he spoke words of encouragement and loyalty to the president of the management company, José del Río Amor, later ratified as first president.\nDuring his years as Atlético's treasurer, Benítez de Lugo generated the signing of several Canarian footballers, such as Durán, Campos, Arencibia, Farias, Hernández Lobito Negro, Miguel and, above all of them, Alfonso Silva, a figure for whom the marquis always felt a special predilection. In the elections held on 16 June 1952 for the presidency of Atlético Madrid, Benítez de Lugo defeated the person who had held the position since 1947, Cesáreo Galíndez, whose board he had been part of as treasurer. His management at the head of the club was not very good and the fans did not forgive him for not maintaining the team's level of the previous presidency, which had won the league in 1950–51. On 20 May 1955, after a confrontation with the Delegación Nacional de Deportes, due to his intention to take the team on a tour of America to raise funds with the government opposition, he was dismissed as president, being replaced by Jesús Suevos.\nHe was president of the Hogar Canario de Madrid for eight years, between 1959 and 1966. Benítez de Lugo presided over a total of 17 National Federations, including Swimming (1968–1972), which led him to obtain a silver medal from the Royal Order of Sports Merit. However, the sporting aspect that he cultivated the most, and in which he achieved the greatest success, was equestrian, where he used the toponymy of the Canarian geography on the majority of the forty horses in his stable since most of them were named after islands, such as Bajamar, Morro Jable, Teide, Orotava, El Guanche, Tazacorte, El Médano, Gran Canaria, Roque Nublo and, above all, Maspalomas. \n\n\n== Later life ==\nThe weekly Spanish magazine Sábado Graphico reported in February 1958, with photographic illustrations, that he presided over a company formed for the creation of a tourist complex in the heart of the Costa Brava, specifically in Pola Giverola on an area of three beaches, projecting a sports port under the direction of the Spanish architects Emiliano Castro and Raúl Martín and the Swiss Marc Saugey. Thus, a new coastal tourist town would emerge on the Girona coast with a 60 percent Spanish investment and the remaining forty of Swiss origin.\nIn 1961 Benitez de Lugo joined the Association of Hidalgos a Fuero de España. In 2004 he received the \"Víctor Pradera\" Award from the Círculos San Juan.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nOn 5 June 1937, Benitez de Lugo married María del Rosario Massieu y Fernández del Campo, 3rd Marchioness of Arucas (1917–2003). The couple had five children, with their first-born inheriting their noble titles, Luis Felipe Benítez de Lugo y Massieu (1938–), 19th Marquis of Lanzarote, 11th Marquis of Florida, 5th Marquis of Arucas, with descendants. The other four were María del Carmen, María del Rosario, Juan José, and Francisco de Borja Benítez de Lugo y Massieu.\nDespite being born in Madrid, he never forgot the Canary Islands, the land of his ancestors, acting as a Canary Islander and even boasting about his Canarian heritage. He lived there in the last few decades of his life.\n\n\n== Death ==\nBenitez de Lugo died at the Insular University Hospital of Gran Canaria in the Canary Islands on 21 December 2008, at the age of 91.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nRodríguez Jiménez, José Luis (1994).

        "content": "William Gibbons (25 September 1649 – 25 March 1728) was an English physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nGibbons was born at Wolverhampton 25 September 1649, was the son of John Gibbons of that town. From Merchant Taylors' School he went to St. John's College, Oxford, graduating B.A. in 1672, M.B. in 1675, and M.D. in 1683. He practised as a physician in London, joined the Royal College of Physicians in 1691, became fellow in 1692, and censor in 1716. He is not remembered by any writings, but chiefly as the Mirmillo of the ‘Dispensary’ of Sir Samuel Garth. He was one of the few college fellows who opposed the project of dispensaries for the poor, and so incurred the satire of Garth, who makes him say:\nWhile others meanly asked whole months to slay,\nI oft despatched the patient in a day.\nHe is described by a contemporary (Nichols, Lit. Illustr. ii. 801) as ‘pretty old Dr. Gibbons,’ and as taking his fees with alacrity. The Harveian oration of the year following his death (1729) ascribes to him erudition, honesty, candour, love of letters, piety, benevolence, and other Christian virtues. According to William Wadd (Mems., Maxims, and Memoirs, p. 148), the credit of making mahogany fashionable belongs to Gibbons. His brother, a West Indian shipmaster, brought home some of that wood as ballast, and gave it to the doctor, who was building a house. The carpenters finding it too hard for their tools, it was thrown aside; but some of it was afterwards used to make a candle-box, which looked so well that a bureau of the same wood was taken in hand. When finished and polished, the bureau was so pleasing that it became an object of admiration to visitors, among others the Duchess of Buckingham, who had one made like it and so brought the wood into fashion. Gibbons left no writings. He died on 25 March 1728. He was a liberal benefactor to Wolverhampton, his native place. A portrait of him was placed at St. John's College, Oxford.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Creighton, Charles (1890). \"Gibbons, William\".

        "content": "Analytics Engineering sits at the intersection of Business, Data Analysis and Data Engineering. It is responsible for bringing modeled, robust, efficient, and integrated data products to life. A practitioner of Analytics Engineering interfaces with the Business and collects Business Requirements and then models the data in the Data Warehouse to reflect the Business. Once the data is modeled in the Data Warehouse they are responsible for bringing the data to Information Mart, which then is consumed by Data Analysts and Business Intelligence team to produce Charts and Dashboard as per business requirements. In short, Analytics engineers provide clean data sets to end users, modeling data in a way that empowers end users to answer their own questions.\n\n\n== Tools ==\nAn Analytics Engineer is not responsible for extraction of the data from the source systems. That is usually handled by Data Engineering team. As such, tools that are used by Analytics Engineers are more geared towards Business Requirement collection, Data Modelling and Data Warehousing. To use the metaphor from Dataform, \"Data engineers build the cupboard, they gather together the wood and the tools and put it together. The Analytics Engineers open the cupboard and start putting in the plates, mugs, bowls, and arrange them in a certain order. This could be arranging them into particular colours, shapes or sizes. Data analysts then go into the cupboard and they know where everything lives as it is arranged nicely. They can then grab the small blue mug they were looking for and go make a cup of tea!\"\n\n\n=== Modelling ===\n\n\n==== Conceptual Modelling ====\nThis is typically the starting point and requires understanding of Business from the Subject Matter expert in each area. Typically mind mapping tool and other business requirement gathering tools are used for Conceptual Modelling. In conceptual modelling, we decide what is the structure of the business reality and what are the terms we use for our business objects. Customers, Orders, Invoices...\n\n\n==== Logical Modelling ====\nLogical Modelling as it relates to Analytics Engineering involves modelling of business processes and entities.\n\n\n==== Warehouse Modelling ====\nThis requires modelling of actual storage structures depending on the Warehousing Modelling methodology being implemented. For e.g. Data vault modeling will require defining the HUB, LINKS and Satellite to reflect the Business.\n\n\n=== Storage ===\nData is stored in a variety of ways, one of the key deciding factors is in how the data will be used. Data engineers optimize data storage and processing systems to reduce costs. They use data compression, partitioning, and archiving.\n\n\n==== Data warehouses ====\nMain article: Data warehouse\nIf the data is structured and online analytical processing is required (but not online transaction processing), then data warehouses are a main choice. They enable data analysis, mining, and artificial intelligence on a much larger scale than databases can allow, and indeed data often flow from databases into data warehouses. Business analysts, data engineers, and data scientists can access data warehouses using tools such as SQL or business intelligence software.\n\n\n==== Data lakes ====\nA data lake is a centralized repository for storing, processing, and securing large volumes of data. A data lake can contain structured data from relational databases, semi-structured data, unstructured data, and binary data. A data lake can be created on premises or in a cloud-based environment using the services from public cloud vendors such as Amazon, Microsoft, or Google.\n\n\n== See Also ==\nData Engineering\nData Warehouse\nData Vault modelling\nBusiness Intelligence\nAgile Business Intelligence\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Frio is an unincorporated community in Castro County, Texas, United States. According to the Handbook of Texas, the community had an estimated population of 15 in 2000.\n\n\n== History ==\nIt was reported that the Frio Draw was the source of the community's name. In the early 1900s, a Baptist congregation was established in the region. Local sources suggest that the population of the surrounding area grew until the 1920s, even though no demographic numbers for the village were available until the 1970s. Herman Coe and L. T. Field of Wayland College led a religious revival that resulted in the official organization of the Frio Baptist Church in 1930. The site's buildings were dispersed, according to a 1936 map. Frio's population was estimated to be 65 in 1971. Up until the 1980s, the church remained the center of the village; in 1990, Frio was home to roughly sixty individuals. The population had fallen to fifteen by 2000.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nFrio is located on Farm to Market Road 1055 on the Frio Draw, 12 mi (19 km) northwest of Dimmitt in northwestern Castro County.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe Frio school, which was first founded in 1899 in a dugout on the northwest side of Frio Draw, served as the community's original hub. In 1903, a new schoolhouse was constructed through public subscription. The community constructed a brand-new, four-room brick schoolhouse in 1929. It was marked as a school on a map from 1936. Following the 1948 closure of the Frio school, the Frio Baptist Church started using the old schoolhouse as a means of fostering communal cohesion. The church eventually moved into a new structure in 1957, situated around half a mile north of the former school.\nToday, the community is served by the Hereford Independent School District. Children who live in the community attend West Central Elementary School, Hereford Junior High School, and Hereford High School.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Second Coonan Cross Oath\nThe Second Coonan Cross Oath was a significant event held on October 6, 2019, by the Jacobites Church in Kerala, India. It served as a powerful symbol of protest and a reaffirmation of their identity.\n\n\n== Context and Grievances ==\nHistorical Echoes: The oath echoed the original Coonan Cross Oath of 1653, where Saint Thomas Christians resisted external control by Portuguese missionaries.\n\nDispute with Malankara Orthodox Church: Recent court rulings transferring churches to the Malankara Orthodox faction triggered feelings of dispossession among the Jacobite faithful.\n\n\n== The Ceremony ==\nSimilar to the 1653 oath: \n\nThousands of Jacobite Christians gathered at the Marthoma Cheriyapalli church in Kothamangalam. They tied a long rope to the stone cross in the church courtyard, mirroring the action taken in Mattancherry during the historical oath.\n\nPledging Allegiance: Holding onto the rope, which stretched for kilometers (reaching Nellikuzhy, 5 km away), the participants pledged their allegiance to the Patriarch of Antioch. This act reaffirmed their connection to the Syriac Orthodox Church.\n\n\n== Significance ==\nReaffirmation of Heritage:The oath served as a public declaration of loyalty to the Syriac Orthodox Church and its Patriarch in Antioch. It emphasized the Jacobite faction's distinct theological and ecclesial identity in relation to the Malankara Orthodox Church \n\n\n== Highlighting Ongoing Issues ==\nThe event brought renewed attention to the Jacobite faction's grievances against the Malankara Orthodox Church. These include demands for an independent Jacobite bishop and concerns about changes in traditions.\n\nProtest and Pressure:The Second Coonan Cross Oath served as a powerful protest against perceived injustices faced by the Jacobite faction. It also put pressure on the leadership of both factions within the Syro-Malabar Church to seek a resolution to the ongoing disputes.",

        "content": "James Gibbs (died 1724) was an English physician and poet.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nGibbs was the son of James Gibbs, vicar of Gorran in Cornwall. He was a student of Exeter College, Oxford. In a letter to Archbishop Tenison, preserved among the manuscripts in Lambeth Library, he solicits Tenison's ‘favour and assistance’ in promoting ‘a new metrical version of the Psalms.’ The letter is undated, but in 1701 the first fifteen of the psalms were published in London, and a second edition followed in 1712. A copy of the latter was discovered in Swift's library, containing some severe marginal criticism by the dean. Gibbs died at Tregony, Cornwall, in 1724.\nHe published: \n\n‘A Consolatory Poem, humbly addressed to Her Royal Highness, Upon the much lamented death of His Most Illustrious Highness, William Duke of Gloucester,’ London, 1700, fol.\n‘The First Fifteen Psalms of David, translated into Lyric Verse, propos'd as an essay, supplying the Perspicuity and Coherence according to the Modern Art of Poetry … With a Preface containing some observations of the great and general Defectiveness of former Versions in Greek, Latin, and English,’ London, 1701, 4to. The title-page of the second edition (1712) states that ‘some of the lords spiritual freely proposed to recommend’ it to ‘parliament and convocation.’\n‘Observations of various eminent cures of scrophulous distempers, commonly called the King's Evil, such as tumours, ulcers, curiosity of bones, blindness, and consumptions … to which is added An Essay concerning the animal spirits and the cure of convulsions. …’ Exeter, 1712, sm. 4to. It contains an essay written in vindication of a trial at Launceston in 1710 concerning the cure of a lad from Plymouth. Some of the cases relate to persons living at Tregony, Gorran, and other places in Cornwall.\nIn manuscript are: \n\n‘Carmen in honorem principis Poetarum, doct. Gibbesii, cum diploma a Cæsarea Majestate in Musarum templo concessum est,’ Worcester Coll. MS. No. 58, pp. 99–101;\n‘Proposal of J. Gibbs to the Archbishop of Canterbury for a New Translation of the Psalms, with a printed translation of the first and second Psalm into English verse,’ Lambeth MS. 937, art. 24, 25.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Wentworth-Sheilds, Wentworth Francis (1890). \"Gibbs, James (d.1724)\".

        "content": "In 2024, two separate rounds of by-elections in Japan are due to be held in order to fill vacancies in the National Diet of Japan, one on 28 April, and another in October.\n\n\n== April by-elections ==\n\n\n=== Tokyo 15th district ===\n\nMito Kakizawa, who has run for and been elected (proportionally in 2009 and 2021) in every election since 2009, was indicted for illegal financing during a Tokyo mayoral election. He resigned soon after, leaving the seat open for a by-election. Four political parties have nominated candidates, all of which are listed below. The field grew to seven candidates in late March.\n\nYui Kanazawa is running with the support of Nippon Ishin no Kai, as party leader Nobuyuki Baba announced on February 1. Kanazawa was already announced as the Ishin candidate for the district in the next general election. She is a former office worker.\nAkari Iiyama is running with the support of the Conservative Party of Japan, the first ever by-election for the party. She is a visiting professor at the Reitaku University Center for International Studies.\nRina Yoshikawa received the endorsement of Sanseitō. She works as a nurse. She was also already announced as the candidate for the party in the next general election.\nFormer House of Representative member Tsukasa Akimoto is planning to run in the by-election, but the legality of his candidacy is challenged due to his convictions for corruption. He has stated his intent to seek recognition from the LDP.\nNatsumi Sakai is planning to running with the support of the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan. Sakai formerly ran for the Kōtō mayoral election in December 2023, but lost. Kenta Izumi has stated his intent to collaborate with the Japanese Communist Party in support of Sakai.\nHirotada Ototake is running with the support of First no Kai. Ototake is known for his autobiography, No One's Perfect. The LDP did not endorse him. Komeito has been resistant to back him. The Democratic Party for the People endorsed him.\nGenki Sudo, who serves as a political independent in the House of Councilors but was elected with support from the CDP, announced his intention to run as an independent on 2 April.\nAdditionally, three other people have been rumored, or have planned previously, to run.\n\nYuriko Koike, current Governor of Tokyo and former Kibō no Tō and LDP member, has been continuously rumored to have interest in the by-election. She has stated that \"The answer is the same as always. The budget is currently being deliberated by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government and the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly. We are working hard to advance the Tokyo Metropolitan Government.\" It has been similarly stated that the local LDP branch wishes to cooperate with Governor Koike, especially due to the current precarious stance of Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's low approval ratings.\nMari Takahashi had originally planned to run for the Democratic Party for the People, but following the confirmation of the possibility of legal issues in her financing and registration, canceled its endorsement. Takahashi withdrew.\nHigashi Kozutsumi was announced as the Japanese Communist Party candidate on February 13. Kozutsumi currently serves as party chair for the Kōtō District Committee. He was already announced as the JCP candidate for the district in the next general election. He dropped out after the JCP and CDP had come to an agreement to support Sakai.\nThe LDP were resistant to field a candidate. The LDP had previously began searching for a candidate, but paused, stating that \"adjustments were needed.\" It also stated its expectation in support from Yuriko Koike and Komeito. The CDP has stated interest in fielding a candidate, and did so in late March, nominating Natsumi Sakai. Eventually, on 2 April, party secretary Toshimitsu Motegi announced that it would not field a candidate, instead endorsing Hirotada Ototake, citing the slush fund scandal as potentially wounding the chance of LDP candidates. With the LDP refusing to endorse a candidate, they have effectively lost the by-election by default.\n\n\n=== Shimane 1st district ===\n\nHiroyuki Hosoda, who served as Speaker of the House of Representatives, announced his intention to resign due to health problems, and stepped down in September. He died a little over a month later. He has represented the district since the first introduction of FPTP districts in 1996, and previously served Shimane in a multimember district starting from 1990. Shimane is viewed as an LDP stronghold. Two candidates have registered for the by-election.\n\nThe Liberal Democratic Party Shimane Prefecture Federation publicly recruited candidates in December 2023. Fumishiro Sakurauchi, a former member of the House of Representatives, and Koumasa Nishikori, a former director of the China Finance Bureau, filed for motions to run. On January 16, 2024, the prefectural federation decided to support Nishikori. On January 24, the party headquarters decided to officially recognize Nishikori.\nAkiko Kamei was announced as the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan's candidate on January 9, 2024. The Democratic Party for the People Prefectural Branch endorsed her on January 27. Party leader Yuichiro Tamaki supported the move. The SDP announced it would support her on March 22.\nNobuo Sasaki, an 85 year old who serves as chairman of a social welfare corporation in Yamaguchi Prefecture, announced his intention to run on February 29. He has applied for recognition from the Conservative Party of Japan.\nAdditionally, there was one other candidate who has since dropped out.\n\nEriko Muraho, a former high school teacher and member of the Japan Communist Party Shimane Prefecture Committee, applied for recognition from the Japanese Communist Party. He was also named the candidate for the constituency's next election. He initially received recognition to run in the by-election, but support was withdrawn on March 18, 2024, after the Prefectural Committee of the JCP decided it would instead unify around Kamei instead. He voluntarily supported Kamei.\nWhere as Shimane is usually extremely loyal to the LDP brand, with neither of its two seats having elected a single opposition member since the electoral reform took place in 1996, the LDPs power in the prefecture has waned due to extreme controversy faced by Hiroyuki Hosoda, who is alleged to have been involved in sexual harassment and to have also dealt with the Unification Church.\nAdditionally, with the death of Noboru Takeshita and Wataru Takeshita, who both held strong sway over the politics inside the prefecture, the LDP has struggled to deal with the consequences. The CDP also believe in the potential seat as a flip, and believe it to serve as a bellwether for the next general election; Kenta Izumi, Katsuya Okada and Yukio Edano have traveled to the district to drum up support Kamei's candidacy. LDP party secretary Toshimitsu Motegi has stated that it will not run a candidate in either of the two other by-elections occurring concurrently, citing its want to focus on the contest in the district.\n\n\n=== Nagasaki 3rd district ===\n\nYaichi Tanigawa, who represented the district from 2003 onward (with exception for 2009, where he was elected proportionally), was indicted by Tokyo Police for receiving over ¥40 million in kickbacks from the Seiwa Seisaku Kenkyūkai. He resigned on 19 January, and left the LDP.\nSo far, two candidates have been announced.\n\nKatsuhiko Yamada, who serves as a member of the House of Representatives for the Kyushu proportional representation block, was announced as the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan candidate for the by-election on January 30. On February 13, the Nagasaki Prefectural Committee Japanese Communist Party branch announced its support of Yamada. The Social Democratic Party endorsed Yamada on February 21. The Nagasaki Prefectural branch of the Democratic Party for the People endorsed Yamada on March 5, in a move backed once again by party leader Yuichiro Tamaki.\nShoichiro Inoue was nominated by Nippon Ishin no Kai. He runs a cram school. He was endorsed by FEFA.\nThe LDP has yet to field a candidate. There has been controversy inside the party on if to field one or not; Nagasaki 3rd is set to be eliminated at the next election due to reapportionment of districts, and Tanigawa's scandal has severely damaged the image of the party inside the district. Chairman of the Nagasaki Prefectural Federation, Yuichiro Koga, and Secretary-General of the Liberal Democratic Party Toshimitsu Motegi have met on several occasions to discuss the possibility of sitting out the election, with Motegi reportedly in support of sitting out and Koga willing to follow the party line. It has been reported that Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has been reluctant to side with Motegi, due to murmurs of Motegi wanting to take down Kishida and his faction going into the future. The party has yet to make an official statement. Party secretary Toshimitsu Motegi confirmed that it would not run a candidate, citing the fact the district would be eliminated, and also due to the wish to focus on the contest in Shimane 1st.\n\n\n== See also ==\nElections in Japan\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

The Select Committee after thorough deliberation on the situation in the country, and in the light of the report of various tribes, resolved to appoint a Drafting Committee to prepare a draft for the political Settlement within the purview of the first Naga Peoples’ Convention at Kohima.\n\n\n== Third Naga People's Convention ==\nDuring the third session of the convention, the Sixteen Points Resolution was adopted making it the basis of negotiation with the Government of India for Naga political settlement. The sixteen-point proposal was placed for approval before the third Naga Peoples’ Convention which met at Mokokchung from 22 to 26 October in 1959.\nDr Imkongliba Ao was one of the most instrumental figures in the drafting of the 16 Point Proposal that culminated in the successful creation of Nagaland state. After deliberation on various recommendations of the committee, the Working Committee was entrusted to select a Negotiating Body and accordingly, the committee had selected around 18 members of the Negotiating Body.\nThe most historic meeting between the then Prime Minister, Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru and delegates from Nagaland happened in 1960, 26 July which conducted a thorough study on 16-point Memorandum. The question to replace “Nagaland” with the pure Naga word and the inclusion of the Reserved Forests and contiguous areas inhabited by the Nagas were discussed. But no such better nomenclature alternatives could be given at that point of time. They were referred to the provisions in Articles 3 and 4 of the Constitution, prescribing the procedure for the transfer of areas from one state to another”\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Siege of Vijayanagar was a military campaign by the Bahmani Sultanate, led by Ahmad Shah I Wali, against the Vijayanagar empire, ruled by Vira Vijaya Bukka Raya III, beginning in 1423 in present-day Karnataka. The campaign resulted in a victory for the Bahmanis, leading to the recapture of all territories that had fallen into the hands of Vijayanagar during the war of 1420.\nAfter their triumph in the war with the Bahmanis in 1420, the Vijayanagar empire carried out a massacre on the civilian population, violating the treaty signed between them during the war of 1367. Following the coronation of Ahmad Shah Wali after the death of his brother Tajuddin Firuz Shah, Ahmad sought revenge for his brother's defeat by assembling an army. Vira Vijaya, the king of Vijayanagar, opposed them with a vast army, supported by Velama Chiefs. However, they were repelled from Tungabhadra, and at one point, the Vijayanagar king was taken as a prisoner of war, though he later managed to escape.\nAhmad Shah retaliated by massacring the Vijayanagar population, seeking retribution for their actions in the earlier war. This led to the Vijayanagar ruler seeking peace, which he achieved by paying a large indemnity as a tribute and returning the lands taken from the Bahmanis in the war of 1420.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nDuring the Bahmani-Vijayanagar war of 1419, the majority of Bahmani territories were safeguarded by Ahmad Shah Wali, the brother of Tajuddin Firuz Shah, the Bahmani ruler. Following the war's failure, Firuz, weakened by illness and burdened by his own shortcomings and the stark contrast with Ahmad's successful defense of the kingdom, came to a stark realization. He understood increasingly that neither he nor his son Hassan could effectively govern the Sultanate without Ahmad's support. Consequently, he delegated more and more of the state affairs to his brother.\nIn 1413, a great saint, Hazrat Gesu Daraz, arrived in the capital of the Bahmanis, Gulbarga from Delhi and began to attract a large following to his place of retreat near the fort on the western side. An inevitable conflict arose between the Firuz and the saint, as Firuz, despite his scholarly knowledge, began to question the saint's intellectual worth. As tensions escalated, the saint relocated to the spot where his tomb now stands, a couple of miles from his khanqah. Meanwhile, Firuz's brother, Ahmad, recognized the spiritual and moral influence wielded by the saint and endeavored to garner favor with his disciples. \n\n\n=== Fall of Firuz Shah ===\n\nThe close relationship between the saint and Ahmad sparked jealousy among Firuz's entourage, leading them to scheme against Ahmad. Two courtiers, Hoshiyar Ainul Mulk and Bidar Nizamul Mulk, advised the Sultan to blind Ahmad in order to eliminate him as a threat. Ahmad learned of this plot and discreetly left the capital with his trusted companion, Khalaf Hasan of Basrah, accompanied by only 400 horsemen. \nHowever, Ahmad soon found himself supported by an army of more than twenty thousand soldiers. In any case, there were individuals of influence around Firuz who had not aligned themselves with Ahmad and opted to resist forcefully. Ahmad gathered his supporters, comprising a majority of the army, and advanced towards Gulbarga. This led to a sporadic civil war, which the devastated country could scarcely sustain. Khalaf Hasan devised a clever strategy: he gathered four hundred oxen from the local banjaras and drove them directly into the enemy's camp. Under the cover of night, he launched a surprise attack on the Bahmani royal army, with real cavalry support from the rear. The army of Bahmani was overwhelmed by the stampede of its own elephants, and Ahmad emerged victorious, marching towards the capital.\nFiruz, realizing the gravity of the situation, met Ahmad five miles outside the city. There was no fighting, as a significant portion of the royal army had defected to Ahmad's side on the battlefield. On September 22, 1422, the gates of the capital were opened for Ahmad. In a poignant moment, Firuz accepted the changed circumstances and led his victorious brother to the throne room. There, he ceremoniously fastened the sword of state to Ahmad's waist and assisted him in taking his seat on the turquoise throne.\nThe emotional confrontation between the two brothers culminated in a heartfelt embrace, with Firuz overcome with tears. Burhan-i Ma’asir vividly depicts the poignant scene as follows: \n\nAhmad: Your Majesty, I did all this for no other reason but to save my life.Firoz: God be praised that the Kingdom is going to the rightful man. It was my fault that having a brother like you I tried to hand over the kingdom to a less worthy person. My last desire is that you should treat your nephew Hasan Khan with kindness as befits a man like you and regard my progeny with the love similar to that which I bear for you.\nFollowing these events, Firuz passed away within two weeks on September 28, 1422. Ahmad demonstrated great consideration for his nephew Hassan, with whom rumors suggested he had been negotiating even during the conflict. Despite advice from Ahmad's ministers, particularly Gesu daraz, urging the new Sultan to either confine the young prince strictly in prison or have him executed, Ahmad took a different approach. He appointed Hassan to a senior command in the army and granted him his father's palace at Firuzabad along with a generous estate. Additionally, he permitted Hassan to enjoy activities such as hunting and leisure in the vicinity, provided he sought permission before leaving. Hassan opted for these privileges over the challenging task of restoring the Sultanate's fallen fortunes, which demanded a focus on matters of war. During his uncle's reign, Hassan contentedly spent his time in quiet pursuits, accompanied by his wives, scholars, and horses. After his succession to the throne, Ahmad Shah moved the Bahmani capital from Gulbarga to Bidar, making Firuz the last ruler of the Bahmanis of Bidar.\n\n\n=== Struggles at Vijayanagar ===\nThis internal conflict within the Bahmani Sultanate may have appeared to present Vijayanagar with an opportune moment to dismantle the Sultanate entirely. However, the Vijayanagar Empire was not in a position to capitalize on it. In the same year, 1422, the Palace of Vijayanagar was also embroiled in internal turmoil. It is possible that Deva Raya II's return from his campaigns north of the Krishna was prompted by awareness of the impending power struggle in Vijayanagar, thereby inadvertently aiding the Bahmanis. Additionally, Ahmad's cautious bid to seize the throne from his brother may have been influenced by the unfolding events in Vijayanagar, presenting him with an opportune moment. Alternatively, this convergence of events may simply have been one of the unpredictable twists of history.\n\n\n== Prelude ==\n\nAfter the significant loss of civilian lives in the Bahmani-Vijayanagar war of 1367, both Vijayanagar and Bahmani rulers recognized the need to minimize civilian casualties in future conflicts. They agreed to a treaty aimed at protecting innocent civilians during wars between them, which was signed by Muhammad Shah I and Bukka Raya I. This policy of avoiding harm to civilians was followed by Firuz Shah during his conflict with Vijayanagar in 1398. The policy was breached by Vijayanagar, as following Deva Raya's triumph in the war of 1420, he massacred the local Bahmani population, thus violating the treaty. In response, Ahmad Shah sought to avenge the massacre of non-combatants, which was the primary reason for launching the campaign. Therefore, Ahmad was determined to seek retribution for his brother's defeat during the final years of his reign. \n\n\n=== Preparations of the Bahmanis ===\nAhmad focused primarily on strengthening the army, a task he was well-versed in. In addition to bolstering the royal forces and mobilizing troops from provincial governors and local tributary chiefs, he actively recruited mercenaries from across the Islamic world. However, he was unwilling to delay striking at Vijayanagar until his forces were fully reinforced. He and his advisors believed it was imperative to act while the Empire was experiencing disorganization at the highest levels. \nAhmad meticulously defined the status and authority of the kingdom's high-ranking officials more than his predecessors. Each provincial governor held the rank of commander of 2000 horse, although the size of their provincial troops was not limited to this number. When Ahmad went to war, these forces were augmented by significant contingents from the prominent fief-holders. Following a display of strength towards his northern frontier, which repelled a force that had invaded the Deccan from Gujarat, Ahmad led a march with 40,000 horse to confront Vira Vijaya.\n\n\n=== Preparations of the Vijayanagar ===\nFeeling the weight of his isolation, Bukka III, the ruler of Vijayanagar, wisely recognized the need for assistance and dispatched messengers to Anapota Velama of Telangana for aid. In response, Anapota sent his forces, likely under the command of Linga, to support Vijayanagar, his southern neighbor. Vira Vijaya, aided by the Velamas of Telangana, commanded an army, comprising nearly a million infantry and gunners, to the southern bank of the Tungabhadra River. His intention was to block the passage of the Bahmanis.\n\n\n== The campaign ==\n\nAhmad advanced to the northern bank of the river and, after forty days of unsuccessful attempts to entice the enemy into crossing, decided to take the offensive. During the night, a division of 10,000 men was dispatched upstream to cross the river above the enemy's camp. Their mission was to create a diversion by launching an attack on the enemy's left flank or rear. Ahmad anticipated a decisive engagement, but the Vijayanagar forces chose not to engage in battle and instead retreated to their own territories. The Vijayanagar ruler sought refuge in the sugarcane plantations. As the Bahmanis were harvesting the sugarcane for themselves and their horses, Vira Vijaya, fearing capture, stealthily slipped out and hid himself among the standing crop. Some of the Bahmani troops stumbled upon him, mistaking him for a gardener tasked with carrying the sugarcane. Unaware of his true identity as the Vijayanagar king, they took him into custody. \nAs the main Bahmani army commenced crossing the river, the leaderless Vijayanagar host, already under attack from the division that had captured their king, began to scatter in retreat. While the Bahmanis looted the camp, the Vijayanagar king managed to escape. However, feeling exhausted and demoralized, he opted not to attempt rallying his army and instead joined them in their flight back to Vijayanagar.\nThe Vijayanagaris now had cause to regret their violation of the humane treaty between Muhammad I and Bukka I, as never before in a long series of wars had either army exhibited the ferocity displayed by Ahmad's troops in this campaign. Although not naturally inclined towards cruelty, Ahmad's temper was inflamed by the atrocities committed by the Vijayanagar troops following the disastrous campaign of Pangul in 1420, and he sought to exact his revenge. Avoiding a siege of Vijayanagar, which was deemed an unprofitable endeavor, he led his forces through the kingdom, massacring men and enslaving women and children. An account of the massacre was meticulously kept, and whenever the tally of victims reached 20,000, Ahmad would pause to commemorate the event. On one such occasion, while he was out hunting, a group of enemy soldiers ambushed him. His bodyguard bravely held their ground until reinforcements arrived, driving off the Vijayanagar troops. Impressed by the valiant defense put up by the foreign archers of his guard, Ahmad ordered the principal foreign officer in his service, known as Malik Tujjär, to raise a corps of three thousand of them. This decision would ultimately have a profound and enduring impact on the history of Muslims in the Deccan.\nThroughout his campaign, Ahmad engaged in the destruction of temples and the slaughter of cows, aiming to inflict maximum harm on the natural affections, patriotism, and religious sentiments of the Vijayanagaris. In March 1423, he paused by an artificial lake to observe the festival of the Nauruz and celebrate his own exploits. During a hunting excursion, he pursued an antelope relentlessly, leading him twelve miles from his camp where he encountered a body of five or six thousand enemy horsemen. In the ensuing fierce attack, half of his immediate bodyguard of 400 men were killed, but Ahmad managed to find refuge in a cattle-fold. There, his 200 foreign archers held off the Vijayanagar attackers for some time, despite the partial destruction of the enclosure wall. However, aid arrived unexpectedly when a loyal officer, ‘Abd-ul-Qadir, led two or three thousand royal guards in search of Ahmad, and they swiftly engaged the Vijayanagar forces. The Vijayanagar troops initially stood their ground, but after inflicting casualties on their assailants, they eventually fled, leaving a thousand of their own dead on the battlefield. After this, Ahmad himself marched towards Vijayanagar, and the Vijayanagar King, seeing the sufferings of his people, sued for peace accepting the terms offered by Ahmad Shah.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nAhmad dispatched a messenger to the Vijayanagar King, stipulating that one of the conditions for peace would be the delivery of all arrears of tribute, loaded onto the backs of elephants from the Vijayanagar stables. This procession was to be led by the Crown Prince of Vijayanagar himself, with bands playing in front. The Raya promptly complied, and when the procession reached the Sultan's camp, it was received with great pomp by the Bahmani nobles and escorted to the king's presence. The king then adorned the Crown Prince of Vijayanagar with royal robes and a bejeweled dagger, and bestowed upon him Arab and Turkish horses, elephants, greyhounds, and three falcons. After these ceremonial gestures, the king escorted the Crown Prince back towards the Krishna River, bidding him farewell. Vira Vijaya then returned the Doab and other territories had taken from the Bahmani Sultanate in the war of 1420.\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nMajumdar, Ramesh Chandra (1949).

        "content": "Shujayi Moithu Musliyar was a prominent figure in traditional Islam, dedicating his life to social reform and contributing significantly to Arabi-Malayalam literature. His multifaceted roles as a religious scholar, poet, Sufi, polyglot, historian, educator, and orator marked him as a key influencer in the 19th-century Kerala Ulama activism.\n\n\n== Family Background ==\nBorn in 1861 AD (1278 AH) in Andathod, near Ponnani in the Malabar region, Shujayi Moithu Musliyar was the son of distinguished religious scholar Kulangara Veetil Abdul Kadir. He passed away in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in 1919, leaving behind two children, Abdulla Kutti Musliyar and Muhammed Musliyar, who later served as a teacher at Kayamkulam Hasaniyya College. His sister was also a scholar.\n\n\n== Education ==\nHis initial religious education was received from his father, and he continued his academic journey in Eramangalam, Veliyankod, and Ponnani. Shujayi Moithu Musliyar showcased creative talents during his time in Ponnani, engaging in pursuits such as reading, exploring renowned scholars, and maintaining connections with them. To finance his education, he ventured into the perfume business.\nProficient in languages such as Arabic, Farsi, Urdu, Tamil, and Malayalam, Shujayi Moithu Musliyar served as a teacher in Andathod, Veliyankod, and Ponnani. He played a vital role in reforming the Arabi Malayalam script, elevating its academic significance.\n\n\n== Socio-Political Career ==\nBeyond academia, he demonstrated social responsibility by allocating a portion of his land to a Harijan family. Actively involved in Islamic teaching, leadership, and propagation, he contributed to the anti-colonial movement through impactful writings rather than direct involvement in the forefront.\nShujayi Moithu Musliyar incorporated Urdu, alongside Arabic and Arabi Malayalam, in resisting British colonialism. His Hindustani language learning book, \"Gurusthani\" (1891), held substantial significance, becoming part of Dars syllabi. His writings offered practical solutions to contemporary issues faced by the Muslim community in Malabar. Notably, he courageously opposed the exploitation of spirituality within religion, exemplified by his stance in the \"Kondotty-Ponnani Kaitharkam.\n\n\n== References ==",

Current exoplanet discovery techniques are more likely to yield planets in tighter orbits around their stars. The sizes of the planets are at correct relative but not to absolute scale. The colors of the planets denote their estimated temperatures.  All planetary systems seen in the animations have more than one transiting object, and the latest version was created by astronomy graduate student Ethan Kruse. In the description of the video Kruse said the size of the orbits are all to scale, but the size of the planets are not. The orbits are all synchronized such that Kepler observed a planet transit every time it hits an angle of 0 degrees (the 3 o’clock position on a clock).\n\n\n== 3rd Orrery Animation (Daniel Fabrycky) ==\nThe third and latest installment of the mesmerizing Kepler Orrery videos by Daniel Fabrycky from the Kepler science team. It shows the relative sizes of the orbits and planets in the multi-transiting planetary systems discovered by Kepler up to November 2013 (according to the Kepler site, 3,538 candidates so far.) According to Daniel \"the colors simply go by order from the star (the most colorful is the 7-planet system KOI-351).\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of exoplanets discovered by the Kepler space telescope\nVisualization (graphics)\nOrbital mechanics\n\n\n== External links ==\nKepler Orrery III at The Planetary Society\nKepler Orrery II at NASA\n\n\n== References ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Oklahoma Gamefowl Commission is a nonprofit advocacy group that promotes the interest of game fowl owners, or cockfighting bird owners, and lobbies for cockfighting in the Oklahoma legislature. They are a \"a pro-cockfighting political action committee.\" \nIn Oklahoma, a cockfight historically has been a \"bloody affair and almost always ended in the death of one of the chickens.\" Oklahoma was one of the last states to outlaw cockfighting, and it is illegal at the federal level.\n\n\n== Structure ==\nThe president is Anthony DeVore. Josh Tadysh is their vice president. \nTheir website states that their goal \"is to unify members into a single political group that will influence legislative actions and form a voting power house that will positively impact Gamefowl owner’s rights in Oklahoma and across the United States.\"\n\n\n== Lobbying activities ==\nThe Oklahoma Gamefowl Commission has \" given campaign contributions and advocated for laws to reduce the penalties for cockfighting.\" Cockfighting was banned in Oklahoma in 2004. Several bills have been introduced \"to reduce the cockfighting penalty from a felony to a misdemeanor in the first two instances or to give individual counties the right to do so. One bill made it through the state's House of Representatives this past spring, but has not been picked up by the state Senate.\"\nThey have \"donated more than $70,000 to Oklahoma lawmakers in a push to decrease penalties for participating in the illegal sport, although the group does not report the source of its funds.\"\n\n\n=== House of Representatives ===\nJustin Humphrey has made several efforts to introduce cockfighting legislation that has led to the outcry from animal rights advocates and the former attorney general. Oklahoma has been called the \"Cockfighting Capitol of the United States.\" In 2023, Humphrey introduced HB 2530,  to allow county-specific elections to reduce from felonies to misdemeanors the criminal penalties related to cockfighting. He argued the bill as a criminal justice reform measure. The bill advanced out of the House Criminal Judiciary Committee on Feb. 22. HB 2530 died on April 13, 2023, for the second year in a row. In 2022, Jon Echols amended a previous bill of Humphrey's about cockfighting that was later changed to include issues of loitering. The Oklahoma Gamefowl Commission, \"a pro-cockfighting political action committee,\" donated $1,000 to Humphrey \"and he is listed on one report as receiving support from the organization when it spent $178.12 on a checkbook from First United Bank in Durant.\" \nIn 2023 Dave Rader co-authored House Bill 1792 with Mike Osburn that would lessen the penalties of and cockfighting dogfighting in Oklahoma, which sparked pushback from animal rights advocates. Also in 2023, Lonnie Paxton authored Senate Bill 1006 which died in the Senate. It would have also lessened the penalties for cockfighting in the state, similar to House Bill 2530, authored by Justin Humphrey and Paxton, which also died in the same timeframe.\nOn such bills, Tulsa District Attorney Steve Kunzweiler said he was glad cockfighting remained a felony. In early 2024, cockfighting rings have been operating illegally in the state, with the \"Oklahoma state director for Animal Wellness Action and a native of Adair County\" saying that \"'enforcement of state cockfighting laws has been mixed even though the cruel practice is associated with a host of other crimes, such as illegal gambling, drug trafficking, gang activity, illegal weapon sales, and violence.\"' \n\n\n=== Oklahoma Governor interactions ===\nIn November 2023, Governor Kevin Stitt appeared in a prerecorded video at the Oklahoma Gamefowl Commission's annual meeting, saying: \"You all know Oklahoma's long and storied history with gamefowl, from statehood to today. Oklahomans like yourselves remain dedicated to the spirit of competition and camaraderie that runs deep in our communities.\" The statement was criticized by former Governor Frank Keating, former attorney general Drew Edmondson, and animal rights groups as an endorsement of the commission's efforts to reduce the penalty for cockfighting in Oklahoma to a misdemeanor. A Stitt spokesperson responded: \"The governor of course does not support animal cruelty. He supports Oklahoma agriculture and often records videos for ag groups around the state... [the governor] has not seen or endorsed any legislation on this topic.\" YouTube later took the video down for violating community standards by promoting animal cruelty. After Stitt's video message, the Gamefowl Commission asked its members to oppose the nomination of Sara E. Hill to the federal judiciary, saying, \"our governor, Kevin Stitt, has asked that we call and email Senators Lankford and Mullin to rescind their approval of Ms. Sara Hill as a federal judge in Northern Oklahoma.\" Stitt had previously opposed Hill's nomination. The governor's office denied requesting that the commission oppose Hill's nomination. The communications director, Abegail Cave, said that the governor will not support bills that lessen cockfighting penaltities.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nWayne Pacelle, president of Animal Wellness Action, \"which two decades ago worked to turn out Oklahoma voters and outlaw the activity,\" said that the  Oklahoma Gamefowl Commission \"'tried to make an official sounding name'\" but that '\"they’re just a bunch of cockfighters.\"' \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Marvin Borowsky (September 28, 1907 – July 5, 1969) was an American novelist and a screenwriter of movies for RKO Studios, Columbia Pictures, Warner Brothers, 20th Century Fox, and others.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nMarvin Sidney Borowsky was born on September 28, 1907, in the Atco neighborhood of Waterford Township, New Jersey. His parents were Abraham Borowsky and Rae Borowsky (née Friedman). During his early years, he grew up in Waterford Township; and later in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. After finishing his schooling, Borowsky entered as an English major at Lehigh University. However, his passion lay in the arts, specifically the theater. This led to him direct plays during his summer vacations and under his direction, \"the Arden Theater developed into a highly successful professional theater.\"\nWhen he finished his bachelor's degree in 1929, Borowsky went to the Yale School of Drama (since renamed as the David Geffen School of Drama at Yale University) and majored in play writing for two years. Then, he moved to New York, where he worked in different jobs throughout the years such as special lightning consultant, play reader and stage manager. In addition, \"he wrote and sold two plays\". \"While impatiently awaiting their production, he developed an interest in writing for motion pictures, and fed up with the procrastination of New York producers, he and his wife went to Hollywood\" in 1940.\n\n\n== Later career ==\nThe two plays he sold in New York were never produced, but it did lead for him to get his first job at MGM Studios as a screenwriter. In the following years, he wrote around seven screenplays for different studios. Moreover, he also helped other screenwriters solve \"their script problems\", which led him to the decision of wanting to teach others \"the art of screenwriting.\" Borowsky first \"lectured on play writing\" at the University of Southern California and then joined the \"UCLA's Theater Arts Department as professor of creating writing\" in 1961.\nIn addition, Borowsky was \"a member of the board of directors of the Writers Guild of America and the Motion Picture Relief Fund\" for many years. Aside from being a screenwriter, he was also a novelist as he wrote an Arthurian novel titled The Queen's Knight in 1955; and he was a \"talented painter\" whose art works were exhibited in several museums in California. On 1968, Borowsky took a sabbatical and traveled throughout Europe and Israel. During that period of time, he gathered material for a book he was writing, did interviews and lectured in \"at the Tel Aviv Screen Center, and acting as a consultant to Israeli screenwriters.\"\n\n\n== Personal life and death ==\nIn 1931, Borowsky married Maxine Levy, and they had a daughter and a son.\nBorowsky died on July 5, 1969, in Los Angeles, California after a \"two-month illness.\"\n\n\n== Works ==\n\n\n=== Screenplays ===\nFree and Easy (1941)\nReunion in France (1942)\nEscape in the Desert (1945)\nPride of the Marines (1945)\nSomewhere in the Night (1946)\nBig Jack (1949)\nGambling House (1950)\n\n\n=== Novels ===\nThe Queen's Knight (1955)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMarvin Borowsky at IMDb",

        "content": "Vrachneika railway station (Greek: Σιδηροδρομικός Σταθμός Βραχναίικων, romanized: Sidirodromikos Stathmos Vrachneika) is a railway station in Vrachneika, in Patras, Peloponnese, Greece. The station is on the former Patras–Kyparissia line and is served by Proastiakos Patras Services.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe station opened originally opened on 15 December 1888 as the fourth intermediate stop on the Patras-Kyparissia railway line, serving Vrachneika, Dresthena and Monodendri communities. The station closed during World War I, but it's unclear when, however, the line continued to be used. In 1970 OSE became the legal successor to the SEK, taking over responsibilities for most of Greece's rail infrastructure. On 1 January 1971, the station and most of Greek rail infrastructure were transferred to the Hellenic Railways Organisation S.A., a state-owned corporation. Freight traffic declined sharply when the state-imposed monopoly of OSE for the transport of agricultural products and fertilisers ended in the early 1990s. Many small stations of the network with little passenger traffic were closed down. In 2005 operations from the station were suspended due to the reconstruction works of the OSE railway network in the region. In 2009, with the Greek debt crisis unfolding OSE's Management was forced to reduce services across the network. Timetables were cut back, and routes closed as the government-run entity attempted to reduce overheads. The station reopened on 9 July 2010 as part of the Proastiakos Patras services, served by trains between Agios Andreas and Agios Vassilios stations. Since the suspension of regional services on the metre-gauge railways of the Peloponnese in 2011, In 2017 OSE's passenger transport sector was privatised as TrainOSE, currently, a wholly owned subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane infrastructure, including stations, remained under the control of OSE. It reopened on 29 February 2020 as the fifth stop of Line 1 of the Patras Suburban Railway, with an operating with the extension of its routes to the town of Kato Achaia\nIn 2020 employees of the Cleaning, Lighting and Greenery services in Patras, completely cleared and remodelled Old Railway Station garden, thus creating a wonderful recreation area, in which even civil weddings can take place. On Saturday 27 June 2020, Achaean actor Alexandros Bourdoumis and Patrini actress Lena Drossaki were married at the station.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\nThe station building is set back from the tracks, which includes a through road (El. Venizelou) passing through the station. The station itself is unstaffed, with few facilities, aside from seating in the old building. At platform level, there are no sheltered seating but no Dot-matrix display departure, arrival screens or public address (PA) systems; however, timetable poster boards on both platforms are available.\n\n\n== Services ==\nSince 1 August 2023, when line numbers were introduced, Vrachneika is served by Line P1 of the Patras Suburban Railway between Agios Andreas and Kato Achaia or Kaminia, with up to one train per hour, in each direction.\nLine P2, accessible via Agios Andreas, has two bus connections at Kastellokampos: one for Agios Vasileios, and another for the General University Hospital of Patras via the University of Patras.\n\n\n== See also ==\nRailway stations in Greece\nHellenic Railways Organization\nHellenic Train\nProastiakos\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Tom Wisner (June 29, 1930 – April 2, 2010) was an American folk musician, activist, and educator. Known as the \"Bard of the Chesapeake,\" Wisner wrote hundreds of poems and songs about life around the Chesapeake Bay.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nTom Wisner was born in 1930 in Washington, D.C. He grew up in D.C. and in Prince George's County, spending time with family along the James River in the Chesapeake Bay watershed.\nHe graduated from Anacostia High School in 1950 and volunteered for the Korean War, fighting with the U.S. Air Force, at his father's urging. After returning in 1954, he obtained a bachelor's degree in biology from Hartwick College. He later pursued some graduate studies in ecology at Cornell, but left before obtaining a doctorate, instead working as a naturalist in California. \nWisner then returned to Maryland, where he eventually became an educator at the University of Maryland's Chesapeake Biological Laboratory until his retirement in the late 1990s.\n\n\n== Music ==\nWisner established himself as a folk singer beginning in the mid-1960s, writing and singing songs about the Chesapeake Bay. Over his career, he produced hundreds of poems and songs on the subject, earning him the title \"Bard of the Chesapeake.\" He was primarily interested in the bay's ecology, flora, and fauna, and the water itself. \nHis albums about the bay included Chesapeake Born, Equilibrium, We've Got to Come Full Circle, and Made of Water. The 1979 album Chesapeake Born was recorded by Folkways Records, and some of its songs were included in Smithsonian Folkways' Classic Maritime Music compilation. Some have argued its title track should be Maryland's state song.\nFor his contributions, Wisner received the 2002 John Denver Award of the World Folk Music Association\n\n\n== Educator and activist ==\nWisner was a committed environmentalist who sought to fight pollution and other threats to the Chesapeake Bay. He also strove to educate young and old about the watershed's importance.\nEarly in his career, Wisner had taught high school biology. Then, in the 1980s, he worked with students at Hollywood Elementary School on art projects and to record music. In that period, he also taught a course about the Chesapeake at the University of Maryland, College Park.\nIn 1999, he co-founded Chestory, the Center for the Chesapeake Story.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nWisner died in 2010 at age 79. The following year, his collaborator Sara Ebenreck Leeland published a book of Wisner's writings, titled Gather ’Round Chesapeake: Tom Wisner’s Vision.\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Tom Wisner Papers at Smithsonian Folklife\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Taboo is an album by the American musician Ronald Shannon Jackson. It was released by Venture Records in 1990. Jackson supported the album with concert appearances in the UK.\n\n\n== Production ==\nRecorded in the mid-1980s, the album was coproduced by Bill Laswell. Vernon Reid played guitar on all of the tracks. Jackson employed two bass players and a horn section.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nThe Calgary Herald wrote that the \"generous use of horns—and Vernon Reid's smooth guitar—keep it all together while Jackson teaches a lesson in what can be done with percussion.\" The Edmonton Journal said that, \"tight, up front, or in behind he is always trying something, maybe just in response to the bright Coleman-style discord of the band... Sax and guitar take their own stretch with a jazzy message.\" Robert Christgau opined that the \"first side's a suite that'll string you along but good—kind of like Mingus, so to speak.\" The Los Angeles Times stated that \"high horns playing Middle Eastern-tinged melodies over bubbling bass and limber, forceful drumming.\" The Guardian praised the \"deliciously full ensemble thrashes.\"\n\n\n== In other media ==\n\"Challenge to Manhood\" and \"Taboo\" appear on a mixtape compiled by the title character of the Alan Warner novel Morvern Callar.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Philip Attwood (born 23 March 1954) is a British numismatist associated with the British Museum Department of Coins and Medals, where he served as chief curator until his retirement in 2020. \nHis brother is David Attwood (film director). \n\n\n== Biography ==\nPhilip Attwood graduated in Ancient History and Archaeology from the University of Birmingham in 1975.  \nHe joined the British Museum in 1978, initially as an assistant in the Department of Greek and Roman Antiquities, before becoming a curator in the Department of Coins and Medals the following year. In 2010, he was appointed chief curator of this department, succeeding Joe Cribb. \nAs chief curator, Attwood was responsible for the department's acquisition program. During his tenure, notable acquisitions included a gold medal by British sculptor Alfred Gilbert (1854–1934) and a significant donation by his departmental colleague Marion Archibald, which was realized following her death in 2016. \nAttwood specialized in the Italian Renaissance medallic history of the 16th century and British medallic history of the 19th century. \nSince 2012, he has served as the president of the International Art Medal Federation (FIDEM) and was also named an honorary member of the Royal Numismatic Society of Belgium. \nAttwood retired on May 1, 2020, after 41 years of service at the Department of Coins and Medals of the British Museum. \n\n\n== Awards ==\n(1992 and 2003): Lhotka Prize, awarded by the Royal Numismatic Society.\n\n\n== Publications ==\n(1992).

        "content": "Aida Petit Jean (November 1957) is a Mexican artist, whose work has been recognized with membership in Mexico's Salón de la Plástica Mexicana (Hall of Fine Arts) and through the federal government's Pago en Especie (Payment in Kind) programs which allows noted artists to settle tax debts through the donation of artworks. Petit Jean is particularly known for her depiction of ghosts and other supernatural beings which she says appear to her.\n\n\n== Education ==\nIn 1980, Petit Jean studied fine arts and art history at the Universidad de las Américas, A.C.. Later, she attended Art and Art History Experimentation Workshops of the Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Monterrey in 2014.\n\n\n== Early career ==\nBy the end of the 1990s, she was represented by the prestigious Misrachi Gallery in Mexico City with various exhibitions in Mexico City including with the Mexico City Metro and Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education - Mexico City campus. In 1998, she was accepted into the Salón de la Plástica Mexicana honor society. In 2001, her work became part of the Mexican federal government collection through its Pago en Especie (Payment in Kind) tax payment program.\n\n\n== Hiatus and return ==\nBut her father's death in 2000 affected her deeply, causing her to leave the art world to explore various spiritual paths, spending 20 years as a nun in the Ishaya order. She returned to art during the pandemic in part because her sister saw an earlier work of hers on display at a museum in Querétaro.\n\n\n== Artistic expression ==\nHer early works had a strong tendency towards abstract expressionism, but in the 1990s she shifted to abstract figurativism, a style she maintains today. She says she prefers the “dark side” of things, and her looks have been compared to that of Stevie Nicks of Fleetwood Mac.  Today, she works in oil mixed media and digital impression, but what has remained constant is the depiction of the supernatural, often ghosts and spirits. “They simply appear.” she says. The paintings of ghosts have had recent success in social media sites like TikTok.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Anatoliy NestorovYch Palamarenko (Ukrainian: Анатолій Несторович Паламаренко; born 12 July 1939) is a Ukrainian singer, actor and professor who is a recipient of both the Hero of Ukraine and Shevchenko National Prize.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBorn on 12 July 1939, in the Ukrainian town of Makariv. He first developed an interest in creative reading as a young boy after hearing Rostislav Ivitsky's radio talks. He was taught for the first time by Volodymyr Nelli.\nBetween 10 July 1941 until 7 November 1943, when the Germans occupied Makariv, Anatoliy's father served as a liaison between the partisan unit and the local underground. He was taken prisoner by the Gestapo in the summer of 1943 and taken to the concentration camp at Buchenwald. It was not until the summer of 1945 that he went home. His sister Anatoly Sophia was sent to Germany as slave laborers in the summer of 1942, while his older brother Alexei was drafted into the Soviet army in 1943.\nFollowing his graduation from Bilhorod-Dnistrovsky Cultural and Educational College, he attended Makarivka High School. Anatoliy later graduated as a drama artist from the Kyiv National I. K. Karpenko-Kary Theatre, Cinema and Television University in 1961, and began performing professionally at the Khmelnytskyi Theatre. He has performed as a pop artist with the National Philharmonic of Ukraine since 1962.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\nDue to the audience's appreciation of the play The Power of Darkness by L.M. Tolstoy, which Anatoliy portrayed as the lead for the following thirty years, it was clear that he had potential. The Khmelnytskyi Theatre marked the beginning of the route for a professional artist. He prepared twelve roles, all of which were quite successful. He found artistic reading particularly appealing at the time, as seen by the acclaim that greeted his introductions from spectators.\nAnatoliy was a performer in the Khmelnytskyi Regional Music and Drama Theater from 1961 until 1962. He has been employed as a conversational artist at the National Philharmonic of Ukraine since 1962. Vadym Kryshchenko was initially known to me as a songwriter by Anatoliy, who also introduced him to his poetry. Subsequently, he played Kryshchenko's poetry pieces at the Palace \"Ukraine\" with success.\nThe writings of Taras Shevchenko, Nikolai Gogol, I.Nechuy Levitsky, Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky, Ostap Vyshnya, Sergei Dovzhenko, Borys Oliynyk, Yuriy Tyutyunnyk, and other classics of Ukrainian literature have been voiced on stage. The greatest source of inspiration and expertise for Anatoliy was the inventiveness of the Kobzar. The poet's prose and poetry, as well as his correspondence with Anatoliy during a sixteen-year period from 1978 to 1994, point to the creation of the literary work Duma Kobzarev.\nAnatoliy voice-acted Ukrainian cartoons, including Mykyta the Fox (2005–2007), Three Ladies are in house (1990), and Three Pankas at the Fair (1991). At the National Philharmonic of Ukraine's 140th concert on 17 September 2003, Anatoliy alongside others performed the Haydamaky poetical-musical performance, which centered on the poem of the exact same name by Taras Shevchenko.\nThe academic title of professor of the Department of Ukrainian Literature was granted in 1995 by the Academic Council of the Ukrainian Pedagogical University. He joined the International Personnel Academy as a full member, or academician, in 2017. He teaches pupils the craft of creative reading and acclimates them to handling the \"Word\" responsibly through his lectures.\nThe Kyiv National University of Technologies and Design Supervisory Board had its last meeting on 27 December 2023. During the debate of the rector's report, Anatoliy, a supervisory board member, referred to the university as the flagship of Ukrainian education.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nElizaveta Oksentivna and Nestor Tymofeyovych, communal farmers, were his parents. Anatoliy was the youngest of the family's four growing up.\n\n\n== Awards and recognitions ==\nAnatoliy has received awards and recognitions such as:\n\n Hero of Ukraine Order of the State (12 July 2009)\n Order of Merit First Class (2 May 2018)\n 25 Years of Independence of Ukraine Medal (19 August 2016)\nLeonid Gavish Prize (2019)\nShevchenko National Prize (1993)\nPeople's Artist of the Ukrainian SSR (1979)\nAll-Ukrainian Literary and Art Award's Kyiv Book of the Year (2023)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "Gustave de Ponton d'Amécourt (16 August 1825 – 20 January 1888, Trilport, France) was a French inventor, archaeologist, and numismatist.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nGustave de Ponton d'Amécourt hailed from an ancient bourgeois family bearing the surname Ponthon. The lineage traced back to Augustin de Ponton (1736–1808), a commissioner of the Navy and later inspector general of the king's farms, who married Louise Maille in 1768. His parents were Jean-Baptiste de Ponton and Louise Machet de La Martinière.\nGustave de Ponton d'Amécourt was the son of Antoine de Ponton d'Amécourt, an officer, and Marie Élisabeth Madeleine Collette de Baudicour. He married Anne-Marie Dumont de Signéville, daughter of François Dumont de Signéville and Victoire Haudos de Possesse.\n\n\n=== Numismatics ===\nGustave de Ponton d'Amécourt, an erudite who studied mathematics, Sanskrit, Greek, and Latin, was a numismatist and archaeologist. He founded the French Numismatic Society and became its first president in 1865. Notably, he conducted extensive studies on Merovingian coins delivered to the Historical and Archaeological Society of Maine, of which he was a member. In 1857, he acquired the treasure of Imphy, consisting of around a hundred Carolingian deniers. In 1886, his numismatic collections were sold, and in 1881, a collection of 1,131 Merovingian coins was acquired by the Cabinet des Médailles of the Bibliothèque nationale de France.\n\n\n=== Aeronautics ===\n\nHe successfully invented one of the first prototypes of a helicopter by designing his \"dear propeller\" in 1861, with his friend Gabriel de La Landelle, an experimental small prototype of a \"heavier-than-air\" aerostat with counter-rotating rotor with two coaxial aerial propellers, and a bicarbonate steam engine (whose boiler was one of the first uses of aluminum), inspired, among other things, by the aerial screw and the ornithopter from Leonardo da Vinci's manuscripts of the 1480s, the Chinese bamboo-copter of the 4th century, and their early study prototypes of aerial propeller, the \"spiralifers\".\nHe coined the term \"helicopter\" from the ancient Greek έλιξ, έλικος or 'helix' (\"spiral\", \"propeller\") and πτερὸν or 'pteron' (\"wing\"). This term first appeared on 3 August 1861 in a patent application in the United Kingdom, then on 16 April 1862 in an additional certificate to patent 49,077 originally filed on 3 April 1861 in France, which only mentioned the term \"aircraft\". By analogy with the word \"navigation\", he also coined with Gabriel de La Landelle the word \"aviation\", \"derived from the verb 'avier', synonymous with flying in the air.\"\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nThe device was photographed by their friend Nadar in 1863 (a pioneer of aerial photography in 1858). Together, they founded the society for the encouragement of aerial locomotion by means heavier than air, in Paris, in 1863, with their famous visionary novelist friend Jules Verne, who drew inspiration from this invention to create the imaginary flying ship albatross of 30 meters long, for 37 masts, propelled by 74 double aerial propellers with electric motors and two electric motors with front and rear propellers, for his science fiction novel Robur the Conqueror of 1886 (followed by Master of the World of 1904). The \"dear propeller\" contributed to the progress of future aircraft propulsion.\n\n\n== Distinctions ==\nKnight of the Legion of Honour (15 August 1868)\nKnight of the Order of Saint Gregory the Great (Vatican)\nKnight of the Order of Christ (Portugal)\n\n\n=== Legacy ===\nA commemorative stele is erected in the park of the commune of Trilport near Paris, where he served as mayor from 1855 to 1876.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHelicopter\nHistory of aviation\nTimeline of aviation\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nGustave de Ponton d'Amécourt, \"Les monnaies mérovingiennes du Cénomannicum,\" in the Revue Historique et Archéologique du Maine, Le Mans, 1881–1882, volumes X, XI, and XII.\nVte De Ponton d'Amécourt, La conquête de l'air par l'hélice, Chez tous les libraires, Paris, 1863.",

        "content": "India Street is a downtown street and neighborhood in Portland, Maine, United States. Situated near the western foot of Munjoy Hill, it runs for around 0.28 miles (0.45 km), from Congress Street in the northwest to Commercial Street and Thames Street in the southeast. It was the city's first street, and the location of the first settlement of European immigrants to the city (then called Falmouth) in the 17th century. There are thirty handmade bricks in the sidewalk commemorating the neighborhood's notable events. In 1680, when Thomas Danforth was Deputy Governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, the street was known as Broad Street. After the incorporation of the Town of Falmouth in 1718, the street was known as High King Street.\nThe neighborhood has been home to Europeans (1600s), African Americans (1700s), and Irish, Jews, Scots, Russians, Swiss and Portuguese (late 1800s).\nOne of Portland's four stations for the Portland and Forest Avenue Railroad Company was located at the foot of India Street, at its intersection with Commercial Street and Thames Street. Known as the Grand Trunk Station, it was built in 1903, when it was one of the two stations in the city, the other being the Union Station, on Saint John Street, which was demolished in 1961. Grand Trunk Station was demolished five years later, having stood for sixty-three years; its clock tower had been taken down in 1948. Its office building remains intact, at the corner of India Street and Thames Street, in use as a Gorham Savings Bank as of 2024. \nClay Cove, the home of early shipyards, stood at the foot of India Street in the 19th century. Atlantic Railroad Wharf formerly stood at the foot of India Street. It was demolished in the early 20th century, when Maine State Pier was constructed.\nAfter Portland's great fire of 1866, a fire house was built at 97 India Street.\nIn the early 1950s, the newly created Slum Clearance and Redevelopment Authority highlighted Bayside and East Bayside as target neighborhoods due to its high number of immigrants and the decaying buildings caused by redlining. Residents of these neighborhoods resisted the discriminatory campaign. In 1958, the Authority demolished the Little Italy neighborhood, which spanned from the India Street neighborhood to the East Bayside neighborhood, razing 92 dwellings and 27 small businesses. Another 54 dwelling units were razed for the Bayside Park urban renewal project, an area that now includes Fox Field and Kennedy Park public housing. The first phase of the Kennedy Park was built in 1965. Several streets were truncated in an attempt to limit access to outside traffic. The razing of Franklin Street began in 1967; 130 homes and businesses were demolished and an unknown number of families relocated or were displaced.\nThe India Street Historic District was designated by Portland City Council in 2015 after a unanimous (8–0) vote. As a result, maximum building heights of 50 feet (15 m) were introduced on India Street, as well as parts of Commercial Street, Middle Street and Congress Street. The following year, the Historic Preservation and Planning Board recommended that the boundaries of the India Street Historic District be expanded to include 96 and 100 Federal Street as contributing buildings. Portland City Council passed the motion in June.\nEtz Chaim Synagogue sits across from the head of India Street, at 267 Congress Street.\n\n\n== Intersections ==\nThe following streets intersect with India Street (from north to south):\n\nCongress Street\nFederal Street\nNewbury Street\nMiddle Street\nFore Street\n\n\n== Notable addresses ==\n\nMicucci Grocery Store, 45 India Street (opened by Emilio and Iris Micucci in 1951)\nAmato's Sandwich Shop, 71 India Street (original store, opened in 1902 by Giovanni and Michelina Amato)\n93–95 India Street\nEngine House, 97 India Street (1867)\nPortland's first masonic hall stood on King Street (where 35 India Street is today). The ground floor was the home of Dr. Nathaniel Coffin; the second floor was the \"Assembly Room\", rented to the Freemasons in 1795 and 1796. \nThe Grand Trunk Smoke Shop formerly stood at 30–36 India Street (with an alternative address of 199–205 Fore Street).\nThe former home of Elias and Elizabeth Widgery Thomas, at the corner of India and Congress Street, has a granite marker on the Portland Freedom Trail. The home was destroyed in the 1866 fire.\nSanitary Meat Market (established in 1914; later Jordan's Ready to Eat Meats) formerly occupied the western corner of the Fore Street and India Street intersection. It is now a parking lot.\n\n\n== Public transportation ==\nGreater Portland Metro's route 8 (Peninsula Loop) serves India Street.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Italian-American neighborhoods\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nIndia Street Neighborhood Association – City of Portland",

He was born in 1729 at Charlestown, but came to England at an early age and entered St. Paul's School. Proceeding to the university of Edinburgh about 1770, he took the degree of M.D. on 12 June 1775, his dissertation being on erysipelas. He became a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians in 1786, and subsequently practised in the city of London. A good linguist and classical scholar, he was one of the originators of the Literary Fund, and from 1790 he acted for many years as registrar to the society. He died at his house in Devonshire Square, Bishopsgate, on 21 February 1816, and was buried in Bunhill Fields.\n\n\n== See also ==\nThomas Dale House\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Boulger, George Simonds (1888). \"Dale, Thomas (1729-1816)\".

        "content": "NGC 2444 is a peculiar lenticular galaxy in the constellation Lynx. The galaxy lies about 135 million light years away from Earth, which means, given its apparent dimensions, that NGC 2444 is approximately 50,000 light years across. It was discovered by Édouard Stephan on January 18, 1877. The galaxy interacts with another galaxy, NGC 2445, whose shape is distorted and has large star formation regions.\nNGC 2444 has collided with another galaxy, NGC 2445. As a result of the collision, a bridge of young blue stars has formed between the two galaxies, and while the galaxy itself has been stretched, NGC 2444 contains old stars and no new starbirth because it lost its gas long ago, well before this galactic encounter.\nOne supernova has been observed in NGC 2444/5, SN 2016bam. The supernova occurred between the two galaxies, about 3.5 arcseconds away from a HII region of NGC 2445. It was a type II supernova which had magnitude 16.1 at discovery.\nNGC 2445 and NGC 2444 (which lies about one arcminute away) form a pair, known as Arp 143. The pair is part of a galaxy group known as LGG 148. Other members of the group include the galaxies NGC 2476, NGC 2493, NGC 2524, NGC 2415, UGC 3937, and UGC 3944.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nNGC 2444 on WikiSky: DSS2, SDSS, GALEX, IRAS, Hydrogen α, X-Ray, Astrophoto, Sky Map, Articles and images",

However, a Norwegian club won the race to sign Nwokoma. He would join Lillestrøm SK after the 2022 season was over. Lillestrøm had a history of having Nigerian players, of whom Nwokoma was compared to Mathew Ifeanyi.He made his Lillestrøm debut in March 2023, in the postponed 2022 Norwegian cup match against Sogndal, and was an unused substitute in the 2022 Norwegian Football Cup final. He made his Eliteserien debut in April 2023 against Viking. Not entirely satisfied with the chances given to him in his first season, which impacted him mentally, Nwokoma vowed to be a stronger player in 2024.\n\n\n== References ==",

He was apprenticed to a surgeon at Malling, Kent, and in 1803 was admitted a member of the College of Surgeons. He became a surgeon in the army, and after serving for several years, resigned his commission and took a house in London in 1817. He received the then easily obtained medical degree of the university of Aberdeen, 26 September 1823, and became a licentiate of the College of Physicians of London 22 December 1823. He gave up all practice but midwifery, became physician to the British Lying-in Hospital, and was also for some years lecturer on midwifery and the diseases of women and children in the medical school of St. George's Hospital. He edited a tenth edition of Dr. Michael Underwood's useful ‘Treatise on the Diseases of Children’ in 1846. His additions are marked by his initials, but they are rarely of much value, while he has spoiled the simplicity of the original work by numerous interpolations from other authors. He also published ‘The Young Wife's Guide,’ London, 1844. Deafness incapacitated him from practice in 1851, and he retired into the country, but returned to London in a year, and there died 9 January 1862.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Moore, Norman (1888). \"Davies, Henry\".

        "content": "The 2024 Astrakhan Oblast gubernatorial election will take place on 8 September 2024, on common election day. Incumbent Governor Igor Babushkin is running to a second term in office.\n\n\n== Background ==\nDeputy Presidential Envoy to the North Caucasian Federal District Igor Babushkin was appointed acting Governor of Astrakhan Oblast on 5 June 2019, replacing previous acting Governor Sergey Morozov. Morozov unexpectedly asked for resignation just eight months after his appointment in September 2018, and prior to the dismissal was viewed as a favourite to win the upcoming gubernatorial elections. Despite the gubernatorial rotation, elections for a full term remained scheduled for September 2019.\nBabushkin ran for a full term as an Independent and overwhelmingly won the September 2019 election with 75.63% of the vote, defeating his nearest challenger, Communist State Duma member Nikolay Arefyev by 63 points. Despite the convincing margin of victory, the election was initially viewed as competitive until Babushkin's main opponent, A Just Russia State Duma member and former gubernatorial candidate Oleg Shein, failed to qualify as an Independent. During most of his first term Babushkin nominally remained an Independent, joining United Russia only in June 2023 and immediately being elected to lead the regional party office.\nIn April 2024 during a meeting with President Vladimir Putin Governor Babushkin announced his intention to run for a second term and received Putin's endorsement. \n\n\n== Candidates ==\nIn Astrakhan Oblast candidates for Governor can be nominated by registered political parties or by self-nomination. Candidate for Governor of Astrakhan Oblast should be a Russian citizen and at least 30 years old. Candidates for Governor should not have a foreign citizenship or residence permit. Each candidate in order to be registered is required to collect at least 7% of signatures of members and heads of municipalities. In addition, self-nominated candidates should collect 1% of signatures of Astrakhan Oblast residents. Also gubernatorial candidates present 3 candidacies to the Federation Council and election winner later appoints one of the presented candidates.\n\n\n=== Declared ===\nIgor Babushkin (United Russia), incumbent Governor of Astrakhan Oblast (2019–present)\n\n\n== See also ==\n2024 Russian regional elections\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Battle of al-Kura (Egyptian Arabic: معركة الكورة) was a military clash in medieval Egypt between an army of the Mamluks ruling Egypt and an army of the Ayyubids ruling Syria. The battle occurred on February 2, 1251, on a stretch of land called al-Kura, near the town of al-Salihiyya on the eastern edge of the Nile Delta.\n\n\n== Background ==\nWith the assassination of the Ayyubid Sultan of Egypt al-Mu'azzam Turanshah by his own military slaves (Mamluks) in May 1250, Ayyubid rule in Egypt was ended. The Mamluks now took power themselves; their first sultan was al-Mu'izz Aybak. In Syria, however, the Ayyubids were able to assert themselves in the person of Sultan an-Nasir Yusuf. He was not prepared to accept the change of power in Egypt and, as a descendant of the dynasty's founder Saladin, claimed the throne in Cairo. However, according to the tradition of the historian Ibn Wasil, Sultan an-Nasir Yusuf was not of a particularly warlike nature and tried to avoid a military confrontation. The actual driving force behind the war preparations is said to have been his closest confidant and vizier, Shams ad-Din Lu'lu' al-Amini.\n\n\n== Battle ==\nOn December 11, 1250, an-Nasir Yusuf and his army marched from Damascus and reached Gaza on December 28. As was common among rulers of the Islamic world at the time, his own army consisted mainly of slave warriors, i.e. Mamluks, consisting of the Aziziyya Regiment founded by his father and the Nasiriyya Regiment founded by himself. The military command over them was held by Shams ad-Din Lu'lu'. Also in the army were the cousins of Sultan an-Nasir Yusuf, the lord of Hama, al-Mansur II Muhammad, and the former ruler of Homs, al-Ashraf Musa.\nIn Cairo, Sultan al-Mu'izz Aybak mobilized his troops. On January 2, 1251, the general (amīr) Husam ad-Din with an advance guard was the first to leave Cairo for Palestine. The following day, General Faris al-Din Aktay set out, leading the particularly strong Bahriyya and Jamdariyya regiments. The two generals combined their forces on January 5th near the town of al-Salihiyya, where they also set up camp. Sultan Aybak joined them on January 23 with his Mu'izziyya regiment.\nDuring this time, an-Nasir Yusuf had already continued his march from Gaza to Egypt and on February 2nd surprised his enemy, who was still in his camp. Initially, the Syrian forces managed to inflict heavy attacks on the enemy, and some Egyptian troops were routed. But then a counterattack by Faris al-Din Aktay brought about the turning point, who held the position with his Bahriyya Regiment and ultimately routed the Syrian troops. The final victory for the Egyptians was ultimately decided by the betrayal of the Ayyubid military slaves, who defected to their Egyptian peers during the battle. An-Nasir Yusuf then fled and took refuge in Gaza. His cousin al-Ashraf Musa as well as his general Shams ad-Din Lu'lu' were taken prisoner by the Egyptians, of whom the latter was beheaded in front of Sultan Aybak.\nThe victorious Mamluks of Egypt were able to move back into Cairo on February 4, 1251.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nOn March 22, 1251, Faris al-Din Aktay led an attack on Palestine and captured Gaza, creating a protective forecourt for Egypt. The militarily weakened an-Nasir Yusuf withdrew to Damascus and sought an alliance with the Crusader states in the Levant against the Mamluks of Egypt. Even if this, under the reign of the French King Louis IX, did not enter into a formal alliance with him, this political maneuvering between Cairo, Damascus and Acre created a balance of power in the Orient for years to come. The Mamluks were able to stabilize their rule in Egypt, while the Ayyubids remained limited to Syria. Through the mediation of Caliph al-Musta'sim, this situation was deepened in a contract between Damascus and Cairo in April 1253, and Gaza was also returned to an-Nasir Yusuf.\nIt was not until 1260 that the Mongol invasions of the Levant brought about a fundamental change in the situation. They ended Ayyubid rule in Syria, only to be subsequently defeated by the Mamluks at the Battle of Ain Jalut. They were then able to permanently unite Egypt and Syria under their rule.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nIbn Wasil: Mufarrij al-kurub fi akhbar bani Ayyub, BnF Paris, ms.

She then became a student representative on the general council of the University of Porto, the university's governing body, and is also a member of the general assembly board of the Portuguese Nutrition Association. From 2022 she became a member of the Conselho Nacional de Educação (National Education Council), an advisory body on educational matters. \nCabilhas has been a regular contributor to newspapers and magazines, notably through a weekly column in the Jornal de Notícias and in the Sábado magazine.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nCabilhas is a member of the Social Democratic Party (PSD). She is the co-ordinator of the committee on \"Long-life and health\" of the PSD National Strategy Council. For the March 2024 national election the PSD formed a coalition with two smaller parties, known as the Democratic Alliance (AD). Cabilhas was placed 12th on the AD's list of candidates for the Porto constuency, which elects a total of 40 of the 230 members of the parliament. The AD won 14 of the seats and she was duly elected. The AD won the largest number of seats in the national parliament but failed to secure an overall majority. At the end of March 2024, it was nevertheless asked by the president Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa to form a government.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Pianoboy is the solo project of Ukrainian musician Dmytro Shurov, former keyboardist of Okean Elzy, Esthetic Education, Zemfira. Created in 2009. Performs songs in Ukrainian, Russian and English. Dmitry's sister, Olga Shurova, a graduate of the Kyiv National Linguistic University, also takes part in the project.\n\n\n== History of Project ==\n\nAt the beginning of 2009, Dmitry Shurov began working on the opera “Lion and Leia,” part of which was performed at the fashion designer Alena Akhmadullina's show in Paris. During the work, Shurov came up with the idea of creating his own group. His sister Olga Shurova, a graduate of the Kyiv Linguistic University, helped him in working on the project, called “Pianoboy”.\nDmitry Shurov's first performance as Pianoboy took place in September 2009 as part of the second Moloko Music Fest. In addition to Dmitry and Olga as a backing vocalist, another backing vocalist Lida Tutuola, guitarist Ilya Galushko and drummer Andrei Nadolsky took part in it. After that, Pianoboy performed at the fashion show of Liliya Litkovskaya's collection, opened the week of British cinema with his set, and played a concert at the birthday celebration of Harper's Bazaar magazine in Kyiv.\nIn November 2009, the first song, “Smysla.net,” premiered on radio and television, and on December 29, 2009, Pianoboy played his first full-fledged solo concert in Kyiv, where a video for this song was also presented. The video was created by the father of the band's guitarist, theater artist Alexander Druganov Sr., together with Kyiv animator Dmitry Lisenbart, based on the drawings of artist Maria Druganova, Alexander's daughter.\nIn January 2010, Pianoboy began recording his debut album, and at the end of February he began a club tour in Ukraine. The first lineup of the group included the Shurovs, Tutuola, Nadolsky and guitarist Alexander Druganov. In February 2011, Pianoboy, together with the group Boombox, recorded the song “Floors”. After this, the group began collaborating with the Music for the Masses company and producer Alexei Sogomonov, who is also the producer of Boombox. In 2011, videos were recorded for the songs “Witch”, “Weekend”, “Leak Away” and “Floors” (the latter together with “Boombox”).\nIn March 2012, Pianoboy, thanks to the song “Witch,” won the “Discovery of the Year” category at the “Chart’s Dozen” award of the Russian radio station “Nashe Radio”. In May 2012, the group's debut album, “Simple Things,” was released. The album was released by Lavina Music. In August 2012, Pianoboy, together with Boombox and TNMK, recorded a cover of Micah and Jumanji's song “For You” for a tribute concert, and in January 2013 they released a video for this cover.\nIn September 2013, the album “Don't Stop Dreaming” was released. In April 2014, Pianoboy recorded a video for the song “Motherland”. In July 2014, the group's planned concert in Moscow was banned by the government of the Russian capital.\n\n\n== Group members ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nDmitry Shurov - vocals, piano\nOlga Shurova - backing vocals, keyboards, guitar, percussion\nNikolay Kistenev - bass guitar\nGrigory Oleinik - drums\nSergey Gryzlov - guitar\nMatvey Mironov - violin\nDenis Karachevtsev - cello\nSergey Vilka - flute\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nLida Tutuola - backing vocals\nAlexander Druganov - guitar\nNikolay Khomutov - drums\nMaxim Malyshev - drums\nAlexander Polyakov - drums\nAndrey Nadolsky - drums\nVladimir Pavlovsky - guitar\nMaxim Tsivina - director\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\"Simple Things\" (2012)\n\"Don't Stop Dreaming\" (2013)\n\"Take Off Archived March 31, 2017 on the Wayback Machine\" (2015)\nSense.net (2009)\nWitch (2011)\nFloors (2011)\nGreat Weekend (2011)\nLeak Away (2011)\nSimple Things (2012)\nSveta (2012)\nFor you (2013)\nBanderlog (2013)\nTrain Archived copy from August 21, 2019, on the Wayback Machine (2013)\nHomeland (2014)\nGrief is Barely Heard Archived November 20, 2017 on the Wayback Machine (2015)\nKohannya Archived copy from March 31, 2017, on the Wayback Machine (2015)\nMoles Archived March 31, 2017 on the Wayback Machine (2016)\nChampagne eyes Archived copy from November 19, 2017, on the Wayback Machine (2017)\nOn the Vershina Archived copy from March 25, 2019, on the Wayback Machine (2017)\nMidnight Sky Archived March 27, 2019 on the Wayback Machine (2017)\nEverything that doesn't bother you (2018)\nPidruchnik (2018)\nIcebergs(2019)\nKiss feat.

        "content": "William Denton (1605 – 9 May 1691) was an English physician and political writer.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nDenton was the youngest son of Sir Thomas Denton of Hillesden, Buckinghamshire. He was born at Stow in April 1605. He was educated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, of which he became a commoner in 1621, and was initiated into the practice of medicine by a noted physician, Dr. Henry Ashworth. At the age of twenty-nine he took his degree as doctor, and two years later was appointed physician to Charles I, whom he attended to Scotland in the expedition of 1639. During the Commonwealth he continued his medical practice in London and Westminster.\nOn the restoration of Charles II the king appointed Denton physician in ordinary to the royal household. Soon afterwards he was admitted a fellow of the College of Physicians. He lived into the reign of William and Mary, and to the latter he dedicated his book, ‘Jus Regiminis.’ His published writings show him to have been a very ardent Protestant, but they are not in any way connected with his profession. He is often mentioned by Wiseman in his ‘Chirurgical Treatises,’ and always with respect. His nephew, Sir George Wheler, knt., writes of him as ‘an ingenious and facetious [phasesious] man, and for his polite conversation among the court ladies of King Charles I he was called Speaker of the Parliament of Women’ (Genealogist, 1886, p. 47).\nHe died on 9 May 1691 at his house in Covent Garden, London, and was buried at Hillesden. A monumental inscription in the church declared that he married Catherine, daughter of Bostock Fuller of Tandridge Court, and that their only child, Anne, married George, son of Sir Edward Nicholas, principal secretary of state to Charles I and Charles II.\nHe was the author of: \n\n‘Horæ Subsecivæ; or, a Treatise shewing the Original Grounds, Reasons, and Provocations necessitating Sanguinary Laws against Papists made in the days of Queen Elizabeth,’ &c., London, 1664, 4to.\n‘The Burnt Child dreads the Fire; or, an Examination of the Merits of the Papists relating to England, mostly from their own Pens, in Justification of the late Act of Parliament for preventing Dangers which may happen from Popish Recusants,’ London, 1675, 4to.\n‘Jus Cæsaris et Ecclesiæ vere dictæ; or, a Treatise wherein Independency, Presbytery, &c., are discoursed,’ &c., London, 1681, folio. In the preface of this odd and rambling work the author mentions R. P., J. S., and P. W. to have written against his two former books. ‘But,’ says Wood, ‘whether either of those three was T. Blount of the Inner Temple, who answered one of them in a little treatise of one sheet [‘An Apology for the Liberty of the Press’], I cannot tell.’\n‘Nil Dictum quod non dictum prius. The Case of the Government of England established by Law, impartially stated and faithfully collected from the best Historians, Precedents of former Ages, and Authorities of Records,’ London, 1681, 8vo.\n‘Jus Regiminis: Being a Justification of Defensive Arms in general,’ &c., London, 1689, fol.\n‘Some Remarks recommended unto Ecclesiastics of all Perswasions,’ London, fol. He also translated from Italian into English ‘A Treatise of Matters Beneficiary,’ London, 1680, fol., generally thought to have been written by F. Paolo Sarpi.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Harrison, Robert (1888). \"Denton, William\". In Stephen, Leslie (ed.).

        "content": "Michael Spinks vs. Larry Holmes II, billed as Vindication in Vegas, was a professional boxing match contested on 19 April 1986, for the IBF and The Ring heavyweight championship.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn October 1985, shortly after Michael Spinks defeated Larry Holmes to win the heavyweight title, promotor Don King pitched to HBO Sports president Seth Abraham a  World Series style competition to unify the heavyweight division which had been without an undisputed champion since Leon Spinks in 1978. By mid January 1986 negotiations between King and the other promoters (including Spinks' promoter Butch Lewis) were completed and the Heavyweight unification series was set to began in March with Pinklon Thomas vs. Trevor Berbick. Spinks' first bout in this series would be a rematch with Holmes a month late.\nIn the build up the bout, Holmes sent a letter to IBF president Bob Lee listing the Judges he didn't want to officiate the rematch, Lee however declined to take Holmes' advice. Holmes would later described the judges from the first fight \"must have been drunk\" when they scored Spinks the winner.\nHolmes was a 7½ to 5 betting favourite.\n\n\n== The fight ==\nHolmes would start the fight strong, throwing many hard shots and left jabs while Spinks was focused on dodging punches and keeping out of range. As the rounds went on, Spinks would start using his jab and left hook to wear down Holmes.\nThe 14th round would start with Spinks scoring with a series of jabs and head punches, however with about a minute left in the round, Holmes suddenly badly hurt Spinks with a right high to the head. Spinks bent at the knee and almost went down. Holmes would land a couple more punches but he couldn't finish off Spinks, who as the round drew to a close threw a series of head shots that backed Holmes across the ring. Holmes would again hurt Spinks in the final round, with a right that had the champion backing into the ropes.\nJudge Joe Cortez scored the contest 144–141 in favour of Holmes, but the other two judges Frank Brunette and Jerry Roth scored it for Spinks 144–141 and 144–142 respectively, giving the champion a split decision victory.\nHBO's unofficial scorer Harold Lederman (who had been one of the three judges for the first bout) had it 144–141 for Holmes. The Associated Press also scored the bout for Holmes, 143–142.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nSpeaking in the ring afterwards Spinks said \"I had to stay cool and calm, then break his morale, Larry proved to be one hell of a champion. He was a die-hard out there tonight.\" In a post-fight interview with HBO, Holmes said, \"the judges, the referees and promoters can kiss me where the sun don't shine—and because we're on HBO, that's my big black behind.\nHolmes was taken to Valley Hospital, after breaking his right thumb in the third round. He would announce his retirement in November 1986.\n\n\n== Undercard ==\nConfirmed bouts:\n\n\n== Broadcasting ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Larry Holmes vs. Michael Spinks, billed as History: A September to Remember, was a professional boxing match contested on 21 September 1985, for the IBF and The Ring heavyweight championship.\n\n\n== Background ==\nBy mid 1985, Larry Holmes had made 19th successful defenses of the Heavyweight championship he won against Ken Norton in June 1978, following Leon Spinks' vacating of WBC title in order to have a rematch against Muhammad Ali. He was also one win away from tying Rocky Marciano's record of 49–0. Meanwhile Michael Spinks had successfully unified the Light Heavyweight division and was looking to move up to Heavyweight. In June 1985 the two of them came to terms to meet in September.\nHolmes, who was 6 to 1 favourite entering the bout, had previously beaten Michael's brother Leon in June 1981. No current or former Light Heavyweight champion had ever won the Heavyweight title, despite 13 having attempted to over the years. The last person to hold titles in both divisions was Bob Fitzsimmons who won the Light Heavyweight title nearly seven years after he lost the Heavyweight title to James J. Jeffries.\nVeteran trainer Eddie Futch, who had trained both fighters since 1981, opted to sit out the bout rather be in the corner of one or the other of them. As a result Holmes brought back former trainer Richie Giachetti, while Spinks' assistant trainer Nelson Brison led his team.\nDespite many boxing experts expecting Spinks to face a near 50 pound weight disparity against the champion, at the weigh-in he came in at 200 pounds, a meer 21½ Ib difference.\n\n\n== The fight ==\nDuring the first two rounds Holmes was able to control the pace using his jab. As the bout went on, Spinks was able to use unpredictable movement to throw flurries of punches from unexpected angles which scored points but never troubled the champion. By the last few rounds, pattern had formed, with Holmes coming forward, loading up, scoring with hard punches but never landing anything that looked like hurting Spinks. Spinks using movement to fight on the back foot, landing the odd flurry, before moving out of range. After 15 rounds, Lawrence Wallace scored it 145–142 while Harold Lederman and Dave Moretti had it 143–142, all three in favour of Spinks, giving him a unanimous decision victory. The Associated Press 144–141 for Holmes while United Press International had it 146–141 for Holmes.\nThe victory made Spinks the first ever Light Heavyweight champion to win the Heavyweight title, as well as one of the first pair of brothers to hold versions of the heavyweight title.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nSpeaking in the post fight press conference when asked about missing the chance to tie Rocky Marciano's record Holmes said \"I'm 35 fighting young men and Rocky was 25 fighting old men. To be technical, Rocky couldn't carry my jockstrap.\" The comment would cause some controversy and Holmes subsequently apologized.\nIn his 1998 autobiography Against The Odds, Holmes would recount that after suffering a pinched nerve in training, a nerve specialist told him that he had a slipped disc in his fifth vertebra and that he might be paralyzed for life any time I threw a punch with a right hand. This would be contradicted by other doctors who said that chance that he would get paralyzed were \"practically nil.\" Nevertheless, Holmes said that the specialist's comments affected his performance, \"I found that not only was I flat and listless, I was reluctant to pull the trigger on the right hand.\"\n\n\n== Undercard ==\nConfirmed bouts:\n\n\n== Broadcasting ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "NGC 2445 is a peculiar ring galaxy in the constellation Lynx. The galaxy lies about 200 million light years away from Earth, which means, given its apparent dimensions, that NGC 2445 is approximately 100,000 light years across. It was discovered by Édouard Stephan on January 18, 1877. The galaxy interacts with another galaxy, NGC 2444, and as a result its shape is distorted and new stars are formed.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nNGC 2445 is characterised by its distorted shape and star formation which is the result of the collision with another galaxy, NGC 2444. NGC 2444 has pulled gas away from NGC 2445 and as a result a bridge of young blue stars has formed between the two galaxies that gives the latter a triangular shape.\nThe interaction has also created a ring of star clusters and HII regions around the nucleus. The kinematics of the gas indicate that the ring has an age of 60 ± 15 million years.\nWhen observed in radio waves the galaxy is asymmetric, with emission being from the nucleus, three star-forming regions and a ridge towards NGC 2444. The northwestern region appears to have stronger magnetic field than the other two. Two giant molecular clouds are visible in the 12CO(J=1–0) emission to the west and northwest of the nucleus. In mid infrared are visible some arms connecting the ring with the nucleus.\nThe streamers between the two galaxies are among the first in what appears to be a wave of star formation that started on the galaxy's outskirts and continued inward. Researchers estimate the streamer stars were born between 50 million and 100 million years ago. The age of the star-forming knots in the ring is calculated to be 2-8 million years. Stars no older than one million to two million years old are forming closer to the centre of NGC 2445. Observations of carbon monoxide emission indicate that NGC 2445 still has abundant gas and star formation rates will increase.\nHubble Space Telescope has uncovered dark filaments of gas in the starburst galaxy's bright core. Those features may have been formed by outbursts of material, however the dust from the outbursts blankets the nucleus in the visible spectrum. When observed in radio waves the core isn't very compact and its spectrum indicates the presence of a starburst region with an age between 1.5 and 5 million years.\nA shell of hydrogen gas measuring 20 kiloparsecs across has been found at a projected distance of about 100 kiloparsec of the galactic system. A filament of this shells points towards the galaxies indicating that it is a superbubble associated with them or a tidal tail.\n\n\n== Supernova ==\nOne supernova has been observed in NGC 2444/5, SN 2016bam. The supernova occurred between the two galaxies, about 3.5 arcseconds away from a HII region of NGC 2445. It was a type II supernova which had magnitude 16.1 at discovery.\n\n\n== Nearby galaxies ==\nNGC 2445 and NGC 2444 (which lies about one arcminute away) form a pair, known as Arp 143. The pair is part of a galaxy group known as LGG 148. Other members of the group include the galaxies NGC 2476, NGC 2493, NGC 2524, NGC 2415, UGC 3937, and UGC 3944.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nNGC 2445 on WikiSky: DSS2, SDSS, GALEX, IRAS, Hydrogen α, X-Ray, Astrophoto, Sky Map, Articles and images",

        "content": "Samuel Dwight (1669? – 10 November 1737) was an English physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nDwight was born about 1669. He was possibly the son of the potter John Dwight. A brother Philip was vicar of Fulham from 1708 till his death in 1729. Another brother, Edmund, was born in 1676. In July 1687 the father is described as being then of Wigan, Lancashire (Oxford Matriculation Register, cited in Welch, Alumni Westmon. 1852, p. 207). Samuel entered Westminster School in 1686, matriculated a commoner of Christ Church, Oxford, 12 July 1687, when eighteen years of age, and as a member of that house proceeded B.A. 23 May 1691, M.A. 14 Feb. 1693 (Oxford Graduates, 1851, p. 201). Some verses of his occur among the academical rejoicings on the birth of James II's son in 1688; others are in the collection celebrating the return of William III from Ireland in 1690. He was admitted a licentiate of the College of Physicians 25 June 1731. On the title-pages of two of his medical treatises, published respectively in 1725 and 1731, he is represented as a doctor of medicine; but his degree was not recognised by the college (cf. Lists of Coll. of Physicians in Brit. Mus.) He practised at Fulham, and dying there 10 November 1737, was buried in the church on the 17th (Lysons, Environs, Supplement, p. 150). Dwight was the author of: \n\n‘De Vomitione, ejusque excessu curando; nec non de emeticis medicamentis, &c.,’ 8vo, London, 1722.\n‘De Hydropibus: deque Medicamentis ad eos utilibus expellendos, &c.,’ 8vo, London, 1725.\n‘De Febribus symptomaticis … deque earum curatione,’ 8vo, London, 1731. This last treatise is dedicated to Sir Hans Sloane, whom Dwight was accustomed to consult in cases of more than ordinary difficulty (cf. his letter to Sloane, 21 Nov. 1721, Addit. MS. 4043, f. 226). Dwight is sometimes wrongly credited (cf. Gent. Mag. vii. 702) with the inventions in pottery made by John Dwight\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Goodwin, Gordon (1888). \"Dwight, Samuel\".

        "content": "'Amr ibn Luhay (Arabic: عمرو بن لُحَيّ) was a pre-Islamic tribal chief of the Banu Khuza'ah tribe. 'Amr gained an infamous reputation in Islamic tradition, as he was supposedly the first person to change the religion of the Arabs living in the Arabian Peninsula by introducing idolatry and polytheistic practices. He is believed to have lived around the 3rd to 4th centuries CE. Some modern historians believe it was not 'Amr who introduced idolatry, but rather, Hudhayl ibn Mudrikah.\n\n\n== Lineage ==\nHis full name is 'Amr ibn Luhay ibn Qam'ah ibn Khindif, as stated in Sahih al-Bukhari. He was said to have been descended from the Jurhum tribe. 'Amr was a Qahtanite as well. Other sources record his name as 'Amr ibn Amir al-Khuza'i or 'Amr ibn Rabi'ah (with Rabi'ah said to be an alternative name for Luhay).\n\n\n== Time period ==\nClaude Addas believed that 'Amr lived around the 3rd century, citing Ibn al-Kalbi's story from the Kitab al-Asnam (Book of Idols). The Persian Muslim scholar and historian al-Shahrastani described in Al-Milal wa al-Nihal that 'Amr lived during the reign of Shapur II, hence placing 'Amr in the 4th century.\n\n\n== Introduction of idol worship into Arabia ==\nIslamic tradition cites 'Amr ibn Luhay as being the first to introduce idolatry and polytheism into the Arabian Peninsula. Two versions of the traditional story exist. However, they both agree 'Amr was formerly a pious tribal chief known for his righteousness and generosity.\n\n\n=== First version ===\n'Amr ibn Luhay travelled afar to search for a cure to his disease, reaching as far as the Levant. He met a group of people (in some sources, they were remnants of the Amalekites) who were worshipping idols. 'Amr inquired more on their religion, and the people managed to convince him that their idols were powerful and could serve him. 'Amr requested them to send him an idol, and so they did. They sent him the idol Hubal, and 'Amr returned to Arabia where he successfully persuaded his people to worship Hubal.\n\n\n=== Second version ===\nThe idols Wadd, Suwa', Yaghuth and Nasr had washed up on the shores of Jeddah. 'Amr discovered these idols and donated it to the chief of another tribe who built an altar and temple for these idols. Polytheism then spread to Arabia when 'Amr set up these idols in Mecca during the season of the Hajj pilgrimage. Everyone soon began to worship idols, forgetting the monotheism of their ancestor, Abraham. Another variation of this story is pretty much the same except for the introduction of a Djinn companion who guides 'Amr into locating the washed up idols.\n\n\n== The fate of 'Amr in Islamic tradition ==\nIn Sahih al-Bukhari, it is narrated from Abu Huraira that Muhammad said:\n\nI saw 'Amr ibn 'Amir Al-Khuza’i dragging his intestines in the Fire; he was the first one to release animals (for the idols).\nBukhari, Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj and Ibn Hajar classified this hadith as an authentic narration.\n\n\n== See also ==\nReligion in pre-Islamic Arabia\nHanif\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; round ears; and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, lions typically do not actively seek out and prey on humans.\nThe lion inhabits grasslands, savannahs, and shrublands. It is usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. During the Neolithic period, the lion ranged throughout Africa and Eurasia, from Southeast Europe to India, but it has been reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western India. It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African countries have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern.\nOne of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture, the lion has been extensively depicted in sculptures and paintings, on national flags, and in literature and films. Lions have been kept in menageries since the time of the Roman Empire and have been a key species sought for exhibition in zoological gardens across the world since the late 18th century. Cultural depictions of lions were prominent in Ancient Egypt, and depictions have occurred in virtually all ancient and medieval cultures in the lion's historic and current range.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe English word lion is derived via Anglo-Norman liun from Latin leōnem (nominative: leō), which in turn was a borrowing from Ancient Greek λέων léōn. The Hebrew word לָבִיא lavi may also be related. The generic name Panthera is traceable to the classical Latin word 'panthēra' and the ancient Greek word πάνθηρ 'panther'.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n\nFelis leo was the scientific name used by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, who described the lion in his work Systema Naturae. The genus name Panthera was coined by Lorenz Oken in 1816. Between the mid-18th and mid-20th centuries, 26 lion specimens were described and proposed as subspecies, of which 11 were recognised as valid in 2005. They were distinguished mostly by the size and colour of their manes and skins.\n\n\n=== Subspecies ===\n\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, several lion type specimens were described and proposed as subspecies, with about a dozen recognised as valid taxa until 2017. Between 2008 and 2016, IUCN Red List assessors used only two subspecific names: P. l. leo for African lion populations, and P. l. persica for the Asiatic lion population. In 2017, the Cat Classification Task Force of the Cat Specialist Group revised lion taxonomy, and recognises two subspecies based on results of several phylogeographic studies on lion evolution, namely:\n\nP. l. leo (Linnaeus, 1758) − the nominate lion subspecies includes the Asiatic lion, the regionally extinct Barbary lion, and lion populations in West and northern parts of Central Africa. Synonyms include P. l. persica (Meyer, 1826), P. l. senegalensis (Meyer, 1826), P. l. kamptzi (Matschie, 1900), and P. l. azandica (Allen, 1924). Multiple authors referred to it as 'northern lion' and 'northern subspecies'.\nP. l. melanochaita (Smith, 1842) − includes the extinct Cape lion and lion populations in East and Southern African regions. Synonyms include P. l. somaliensis (Noack 1891), P. l. massaica (Neumann, 1900), P. l. sabakiensis (Lönnberg, 1910), P. l. bleyenberghi (Lönnberg, 1914), P. l. roosevelti (Heller, 1914), P. l. nyanzae (Heller, 1914), P. l. hollisteri (Allen, 1924), P. l. krugeri (Roberts, 1929), P. l. vernayi (Roberts, 1948), and P. l. webbiensis (Zukowsky, 1964). It has been referred to as 'southern subspecies' and 'southern lion'.\nHowever, there seems to be some degree of overlap between both groups in northern Central Africa. DNA analysis from a more recent study indicates, that Central African lions are derived from both northern and southern lions, as they cluster with P. leo leo in mtDNA-based phylogenies whereas their genomic DNA indicates a closer relationship with P. leo melanochaita.\nLion samples from some parts of the Ethiopian Highlands cluster genetically with those from Cameroon and Chad, while lions from other areas of Ethiopia cluster with samples from East Africa. Researchers, therefore, assume Ethiopia is a contact zone between the two subspecies. Genome-wide data of a wild-born historical lion sample from Sudan showed that it clustered with P. l. leo in mtDNA-based phylogenies, but with a high affinity to P. l. melanochaita. This result suggested that the taxonomic position of lions in Central Africa may require revision.\n\n\n=== Fossil records ===\n\nOther lion subspecies or sister species to the modern lion existed in prehistoric times:\n\nP. l. sinhaleyus was a fossil carnassial excavated in Sri Lanka, which was attributed to a lion. It is thought to have become extinct around 39,000 years ago.\nP. fossilis was larger than the modern lion and lived in the Middle Pleistocene. Bone fragments were excavated in caves in the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and Czech Republic.\nP. spelaea, or the cave lion, lived in Eurasia and Beringia during the Late Pleistocene. It became extinct due to climate warming or human expansion latest by 11,900 years ago. Bone fragments excavated in European, North Asian, Canadian and Alaskan caves indicate that it ranged from Europe across Siberia into western Alaska. It likely derived from P. fossilis, and was genetically isolated and highly distinct from the modern lion in Africa and Eurasia. It is depicted in Paleolithic cave paintings, ivory carvings, and clay busts.\nP. atrox, or the American lion, ranged in the Americas from Canada to possibly Patagonia. It arose when a cave lion population in Beringia became isolated south of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet about 370,000 years ago. A fossil from Edmonton dates to 11,355 ± 55 years ago.\n\n\n=== Evolution ===\n\nThe Panthera lineage is estimated to have genetically diverged from the common ancestor of the Felidae around 9.32 to 4.47 million years ago to 11.75 to 0.97 million years ago. Results of analyses differ in the phylogenetic relationship of the lion; it was thought to form a sister group with the jaguar that diverged 3.46 to 1.22 million years ago, but also with the leopard that diverged 3.1 to 1.95 million years ago to 4.32 to 0.02 million years ago. Hybridisation between lion and snow leopard ancestors possibly continued until about 2.1 million years ago. The lion-leopard clade was distributed in the Asian and African Palearctic since at least the early Pliocene. The earliest fossils recognisable as lions were found at Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania and are estimated to be up to 2 million years old.\nEstimates for the divergence time of the modern and cave lion lineages range from 529,000 to 392,000 years ago based on mutation rate per generation time of the modern lion. There is no evidence for gene flow between the two lineages, indicating that they did not share the same geographic area. The Eurasian and American cave lions became extinct at the end of the last glacial period without mitochondrial descendants on other continents. The modern lion was probably widely distributed in Africa during the Middle Pleistocene and started to diverge in sub-Saharan Africa during the Late Pleistocene. Lion populations in East and Southern Africa became separated from populations in West and North Africa when the equatorial rainforest expanded 183,500 to 81,800 years ago. They shared a common ancestor probably between 98,000 and 52,000 years ago. Due to the expansion of the Sahara between 83,100 and 26,600 years ago, lion populations in West and North Africa became separated. As the rainforest decreased and thus gave rise to more open habitats, lions moved from West to Central Africa. Lions from North Africa dispersed to southern Europe and Asia between 38,800 and 8,300 years ago.\nExtinction of lions in southern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East interrupted gene flow between lion populations in Asia and Africa. Genetic evidence revealed numerous mutations in lion samples from East and Southern Africa, which indicates that this group has a longer evolutionary history than genetically less diverse lion samples from Asia and West and Central Africa. A whole genome-wide sequence of lion samples showed that samples from West Africa shared alleles with samples from Southern Africa, and samples from Central Africa shared alleles with samples from Asia. This phenomenon indicates that Central Africa was a melting pot of lion populations after they had become isolated, possibly migrating through corridors in the Nile Basin during the early Holocene.\n\n\n=== Hybrids ===\n\nIn zoos, lions have been bred with tigers to create hybrids for the curiosity of visitors or for scientific purpose. The liger is bigger than a lion and a tiger, whereas most tigons are relatively small compared to their parents because of reciprocal gene effects. The leopon is a hybrid between a lion and leopard.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe lion is a muscular, broad-chested cat with a short, rounded head, a reduced neck, and round ears; males have broader heads. The fur varies in colour from light buff to silvery grey, yellowish red, and dark brown. The colours of the underparts are generally lighter. A new-born lion has dark spots, which fade as the cub reaches adulthood, although faint spots may still be seen on the legs and underparts. The tail of all lions ends in a dark, hairy tuft that, in some lions, conceals an approximately 5 mm (0.20 in)-long, hard \"spine\" or \"spur\" that is formed from the final, fused sections of tail bone. The functions of the spur are unknown. The tuft is absent at birth and develops at around 5+1⁄2 months of age. It is readily identifiable at the age of seven months.\nIts skull is very similar to that of the tiger, although the frontal region is usually more depressed and flattened and has a slightly shorter postorbital region and broader nasal openings than those of the tiger. Due to the amount of skull variation in the two species, usually only the structure of the lower jaw can be used as a reliable indicator of species.\nThe skeletal muscles of the lion make up 58.8% of its body weight and represent the highest percentage of muscles among mammals.\n\n\n=== Size ===\nAmong felids, the lion is second only to the tiger in size. The size and weight of adult lions vary across its range and habitats. Accounts of a few individuals that were larger than average exist from Africa and India.\n\n\n=== Mane ===\n\nThe male lion's mane is the most recognisable feature of the species. It may have evolved around 320,000–190,000 years ago. It grows downwards and backwards, covering most of the head, neck, shoulders, and chest. The mane is typically brownish and tinged with yellow, rust, and black hairs. It starts growing when lions enter adolescence, when testosterone levels increase, and reach their full size at around four years old. Cool ambient temperatures in European and North American zoos may result in a heavier mane. On average, Asiatic lions have sparser manes than African lions.\nThis feature likely evolved to signal the fitness of males to females. Males with darker manes appear to have greater reproductive success and are more likely to remain in a pride for longer. They have longer and thicker hair and higher testosterone levels, but they are also more vulnerable to heat stress. Unlike in other felid species, female lions consistently interact with multiple males at once. Another hypothesis suggests that the mane also serves to protect the neck in fights, but this is disputed. During fights, including those involving maneless females and adolescents, the neck is not targeted as much as the face, back, and hindquarters. Injured lions also begin to lose their manes. \nAlmost all male lions in Pendjari National Park are either maneless or have very short manes. Maneless lions have also been reported in Senegal, in Sudan's Dinder National Park and in Tsavo East National Park, Kenya. Castrated lions often have little to no mane because the removal of the gonads inhibits testosterone production. \nRarely, lionesses (in the wild and in captivity) have been observed to grow manes. Increased testosterone may be the cause of maned lionesses reported in northern Botswana.\n\n\n=== Colour variation ===\n\nThe white lion is a rare morph with a genetic condition called leucism, which is caused by a double recessive allele. It is not albino; it has normal pigmentation in the eyes and skin. White lions have occasionally been encountered in and around Kruger National Park and the adjacent Timbavati Private Game Reserve in eastern South Africa. They were removed from the wild in the 1970s, thus decreasing the white lion gene pool. Nevertheless, 17 births have been recorded in five prides between 2007 and 2015. White lions are selected for breeding in captivity. They have reportedly been bred in camps in South Africa for use as trophies to be killed during canned hunts.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\n\nAfrican lions live in scattered populations across sub-Saharan Africa. The lion prefers grassy plains and savannahs, scrub bordering rivers, and open woodlands with bushes. It rarely enters closed forests. On Mount Elgon, the lion has been recorded up to an elevation of 3,600 m (11,800 ft) and close to the snow line on Mount Kenya. Savannahs with an annual rainfall of 300 to 1,500 mm (12 to 59 in) make up the majority of lion habitat in Africa, estimated at 3,390,821 km2 (1,309,203 sq mi) at most, but remnant populations are also present in tropical moist forests in West Africa and montane forests in East Africa. The Asiatic lion now survives only in and around Gir National Park in Gujarat, western India. Its habitat is a mixture of dry savannah forest and very dry, deciduous scrub forest.\n\n\n=== Historical range ===\nIn Africa, the range of the lion originally spanned most of the central African rainforest zone and the Sahara desert. In the 1960s, it became extinct in North Africa, except in the southern part of Sudan.\nIn southern Europe and Asia, the lion once ranged in regions where climatic conditions supported an abundance of prey. In Ukraine, the modern lion was present from about 6,400 to 2,000 years BP. In Greece, it was common, as reported by Herodotus in 480 BC; it was considered rare by 300 BC and extirpated by AD 100. It was present in the Caucasus until the 10th century. It lived in Palestine until the Middle Ages and in Southwest Asia until the late 19th century. By the late 19th century, it had been extirpated in most of Turkey. The last live lion in Iran was sighted in 1942, about 65 km (40 mi) northwest of Dezful, although the corpse of a lioness was found on the banks of the Karun river in Khuzestan province in 1944. It once ranged from Sind and Punjab in Pakistan to Bengal and the Narmada River in central India.\n\n\n== Behaviour and ecology ==\nLions spend much of their time resting; they are inactive for about twenty hours per day. Although lions can be active at any time, their activity generally peaks after dusk with a period of socialising, grooming, and defecating. Intermittent bursts of activity continue until dawn, when hunting most often takes place. They spend an average of two hours a day walking and fifty minutes eating.\n\n\n=== Group organisation ===\n\nThe lion is the most social of all wild felid species, living in groups of related individuals with their offspring. Such a group is called a \"pride\". Groups of male lions are called \"coalitions\". Females form the stable social unit in a pride and do not tolerate outside females. The majority of females remain in their birth prides while all males and some females will disperse. The average pride consists of around 15 lions, including several adult females and up to four males and their cubs of both sexes. Large prides, consisting of up to 30 individuals, have been observed. The sole exception to this pattern is the Tsavo lion pride that always has just one adult male. Prides act as fission–fusion societies, and members will split into subgroups that keep in contact with roars.\nNomadic lions range widely and move around sporadically, either in pairs or alone. Pairs are more frequent among related males. A lion may switch lifestyles; nomads can become residents and vice versa. Interactions between prides and nomads tend to be hostile, although pride females in estrus allow nomadic males to approach them. Males spend years in a nomadic phase before gaining residence in a pride. A study undertaken in the Serengeti National Park revealed that nomadic coalitions gain residency at between 3.5 and 7.3 years of age. In Kruger National Park, dispersing male lions move more than 25 km (16 mi) away from their natal pride in search of their own territory. Female lions stay closer to their natal pride. Therefore, female lions in an area are more closely related to each other than male lions in the same area.\nThe evolution of sociability in lions was likely driven both by high population density and the clumped resources of savannah habitats. The larger the pride, the more high-quality territory they can defend; \"hotspots\" being near river confluences, where the cats have better access to water, prey and shelter (via vegetation). The area occupied by a pride is called a \"pride area\" whereas that occupied by a nomad is a \"range\". Males associated with a pride patrol the fringes. Both males and females defend the pride against intruders, but the male lion is better-suited for this purpose due to its stockier, more powerful build. Some individuals consistently lead the defense against intruders, while others lag behind. Lions tend to assume specific roles in the pride; slower-moving individuals may provide other valuable services to the group. Alternatively, there may be rewards associated with being a leader that fends off intruders; the rank of lionesses in the pride is reflected in these responses. The male or males associated with the pride must defend their relationship with the pride from outside males who may attempt to usurp them. Dominance hierarchies do not appear to exist among individuals of either sex in a pride.\nAsiatic lion prides differ in group composition. Male Asiatic lions are solitary or associate with up to three males, forming a loose pride while females associate with up to 12 other females, forming a stronger pride together with their cubs. Female and male lions associate only when mating. Coalitions of males hold territory for a longer time than single lions. Males in coalitions of three or four individuals exhibit a pronounced hierarchy, in which one male dominates the others and mates more frequently.\n\n\n=== Hunting and diet ===\n\nThe lion is a generalist hypercarnivore and is considered to be both an apex and keystone predator due to its wide prey spectrum. Its prey consists mainly of ungulates, particularly blue wildebeest, plains zebra, African buffalo, common warthog, gemsbok and giraffe. In India, chital and sambar deer are the most common wild prey, while livestock contributes significantly to lion kills outside protected areas. They usually avoid fully grown adult elephants, rhinoceroses and hippopotamus and small prey like dik-dik, hyraxes, hares and monkeys. Unusual prey include porcupines and small reptiles. Lions kill other predators but seldom consume them.\nYoung lions first display stalking behaviour at around three months of age, although they do not participate in hunting until they are almost a year old and begin to hunt effectively when nearing the age of two. Single lions are capable of bringing down zebra and wildebeest, while larger prey like buffalo and giraffe are riskier. In Chobe National Park, large prides have been observed hunting African bush elephants up to around 15 years old in exceptional cases, with the victims being calves, juveniles, and even subadults. In typical hunts, each lioness has a favoured position in the group, either stalking prey on the \"wing\", then attacking, or moving a smaller distance in the centre of the group and capturing prey fleeing from other lionesses. Males attached to prides do not usually participate in group hunting. Some evidence suggests, however, that males are just as successful as females; they are typically solo hunters who ambush prey in small bushland. They may join in the hunting of large, slower-moving prey like buffalo; and even hunt them on their own. Moderately-sized hunting groups generally have higher success rates than lone females and larger groups.\nLions are not particularly known for their stamina. For instance, a lioness's heart comprises only 0.57% of her body weight and a male's is about 0.45% of his body weight, whereas a hyena's heart comprises almost 1% of its body weight. Thus, lions run quickly only in short bursts at about 48–59 km/h (30–37 mph) and need to be close to their prey before starting the attack. One study in 2018 recorded a lion running at a top speed of 74.1 km/h (46.0 mph). They take advantage of factors that reduce visibility; many kills take place near some form of cover or at night. The lion's attack is short and powerful; it attempts to catch prey with a fast rush and final leap, usually pulls it down by the rump, and kills with a clamping bite to the throat or muzzle. It can hold the prey's throat for up to 13 minutes, until the prey stops moving. It has a bite force of 1314.7 Newton at the canine tip and 2023.7 Newton at the carnassial notch.\nLions typically consume prey at the location of the hunt but sometimes drag large prey into cover. They tend to squabble over kills, particularly the males. Cubs suffer most when food is scarce but otherwise all pride members eat their fill, including old and crippled lions, which can live on leftovers. Large kills are shared more widely among pride members. An adult lioness requires an average of about 5 kg (11 lb) of meat per day while males require about 7 kg (15 lb). Lions gorge themselves and eat up to 30 kg (66 lb) in one session. If it is unable to consume all of the kill, it rests for a few hours before continuing to eat. On hot days, the pride retreats to shade with one or two males standing guard. Lions defend their kills from scavengers such as vultures and hyenas.\nLions scavenge on carrion when the opportunity arises, scavenging animals dead from natural causes such as disease or those that were killed by other predators. Scavenging lions keep a constant lookout for circling vultures, which indicate the death or distress of an animal. Most carrion on which both hyenas and lions feed upon are killed by hyenas rather than lions. Carrion is thought to provide a large part of lion diet.\n\n\n=== Predatory competition ===\n\nLions and spotted hyenas occupy a similar ecological niche and compete for prey and carrion; a review of data across several studies indicates a dietary overlap of 58.6%. Lions typically ignore hyenas unless they are on a kill or are being harassed, while the latter tend to visibly react to the presence of lions with or without the presence of food. In the Ngorongoro crater, lions subsist largely on kills stolen from hyenas, causing them to increase their kill rate. In Botswana's Chobe National Park, the situation is reversed as hyenas there frequently challenge lions and steal their kills, obtaining food from 63% of all lion kills. When confronted on a kill, hyenas may either leave or wait patiently at a distance of 30–100 m (98–328 ft) until the lions have finished. Hyenas may feed alongside lions and force them off a kill. The two species attack one another even when there is no food involved for no apparent reason. Lions can account for up to 71% of hyena deaths in Etosha National Park. Hyenas have adapted by frequently mobbing lions that enter their home ranges. When the lion population in Kenya's Masai Mara National Reserve declined, the spotted hyena population increased rapidly.\nLions tend to dominate cheetahs and leopards, steal their kills and kill their cubs and even adults when given the chance. Cheetahs often lose their kills to lions or other predators. A study in the Serengeti ecosystem revealed that lions killed at least 17 of 125 cheetah cubs born between 1987 and 1990. Cheetahs avoid their competitors by hunting at different times and habitats. Leopards, by contrast, do not appear to be motivated by an avoidance of lions, as they use heavy vegetation regardless of whether lions are present in an area and both cats are active around the same time of day. In addition, there is no evidence that lions effect leopard abundance. Leopards take refuge in trees, though lionesses occasionally attempt to climb up and retrieve their kills.\nLions similarly dominate African wild dogs, taking their kills and dispatching pups or adult dogs. Population densities of wild dogs are low in areas where lions are more abundant. However, there are a few reported cases of old and wounded lions falling prey to wild dogs.\n\n\n=== Reproduction and life cycle ===\n\nMost lionesses reproduce by the time they are four years of age. Lions do not mate at a specific time of year and the females are polyestrous. Like those of other cats, the male lion's penis has spines that point backward. During withdrawal of the penis, the spines rake the walls of the female's vagina, which may cause ovulation. A lioness may mate with more than one male when she is in heat. Lions of both sexes may be involved in group homosexual and courtship activities. Males will also head-rub and roll around with each other before mounting each other. Generation length of the lion is about seven years. The average gestation period is around 110 days; the female gives birth to a litter of between one and four cubs in a secluded den, which may be a thicket, a reed-bed, a cave, or some other sheltered area, usually away from the pride. She will often hunt alone while the cubs are still helpless, staying relatively close to the den. Lion cubs are born blind, their eyes opening around seven days after birth. They weigh 1.2–2.1 kg (2.6–4.6 lb) at birth and are almost helpless, beginning to crawl a day or two after birth and walking around three weeks of age. To avoid a buildup of scent attracting the attention of predators, the lioness moves her cubs to a new den site several times a month, carrying them one-by-one by the nape of the neck.\nUsually, the mother does not integrate herself and her cubs back into the pride until the cubs are six to eight weeks old. Sometimes the introduction to pride life occurs earlier, particularly if other lionesses have given birth at about the same time. When first introduced to the rest of the pride, lion cubs lack confidence when confronted with adults other than their mother. They soon begin to immerse themselves in the pride life, however, playing among themselves or attempting to initiate play with the adults. Lionesses with cubs of their own are more likely to be tolerant of another lioness's cubs than lionesses without cubs. Male tolerance of the cubs varies—one male could patiently let the cubs play with his tail or his mane, while another may snarl and bat the cubs away.\n\nPride lionesses often synchronise their reproductive cycles and communal rearing and suckling of the young, which suckle indiscriminately from any or all of the nursing females in the pride. The synchronisation of births is advantageous because the cubs grow to being roughly the same size and have an equal chance of survival, and sucklings are not dominated by older cubs. Weaning occurs after six or seven months. Male lions reach maturity at about three years of age and at four to five years are capable of challenging and displacing adult males associated with another pride. They begin to age and weaken at between 10 and 15 years of age at the latest.\nWhen one or more new males oust the previous males associated with a pride, the victors often kill any existing young cubs, perhaps because females do not become fertile and receptive until their cubs mature or die. Females often fiercely defend their cubs from a usurping male but are rarely successful unless a group of three or four mothers within a pride join forces against the male. Cubs also die from starvation and abandonment, and predation by leopards, hyenas and wild dogs. Male cubs are excluded from their maternal pride when they reach maturity at around two or three years of age, while some females may leave when they reach the age of two. When a new male lion takes over a pride, adolescents both male and female may be evicted.\n\n\n=== Health and mortality ===\n\nLions may live 12–17 years in the wild. Although adult lions have no natural predators, evidence suggests most die violently from attacks by humans or other lions. Lions often inflict serious injuries on members of other prides they encounter in territorial disputes or members of the home pride when fighting at a kill. Crippled lions and cubs may fall victim to hyenas and leopards or be trampled by buffalo or elephants. Careless lions may be maimed when hunting prey.  Nile crocodiles may also kill and eat lions, evidenced by the occasional lion claw found in crocodile stomachs.\nTicks commonly infest the ears, neck and groin regions of the lions. Adult forms of several tapeworm species of the genus Taenia have been isolated from lion intestines, having been ingested as larvae in antelope meat. Lions in the Ngorongoro Crater were afflicted by an outbreak of stable fly (Stomoxys calcitrans) in 1962, resulting in lions becoming emaciated and covered in bloody, bare patches. Lions sought unsuccessfully to evade the biting flies by climbing trees or crawling into hyena burrows; many died or migrated and the local population dropped from 70 to 15 individuals. A more recent outbreak in 2001 killed six lions.\nCaptive lions have been infected with canine distemper virus (CDV) since at least the mid-1970s. CDV is spread by domestic dogs and other carnivores; a 1994 outbreak in Serengeti National Park resulted in many lions developing neurological symptoms such as seizures. During the outbreak, several lions died from pneumonia and encephalitis. Feline immunodeficiency virus and lentivirus also affect captive lions.\n\n\n=== Communication ===\n\nWhen resting, lion socialisation occurs through a number of behaviours; the animal's expressive movements are highly developed. The most common peaceful, tactile gestures are head rubbing and social licking, which have been compared with the role of allogrooming among primates. Head rubbing, nuzzling the forehead, face and neck against another lion appears to be a form of greeting and is seen often after an animal has been apart from others or after a fight or confrontation. Males tend to rub other males, while cubs and females rub females. Social licking often occurs in tandem with head rubbing; it is generally mutual and the recipient appears to express pleasure. The head and neck are the most common parts of the body licked; this behaviour may have arisen out of utility because lions cannot lick these areas themselves.\n\nLions have an array of facial expressions and body postures that serve as visual gestures. A common facial expression is the \"grimace face\" or flehmen response, which a lion makes when sniffing chemical signals and involves an open mouth with bared teeth, raised muzzle, wrinkled nose, closed eyes and relaxed ears. Lions also use chemical and visual marking; males spray urine and scrape plots of ground and objects within the territory.\nThe lion's repertoire of vocalisations is large; variations in intensity and pitch appear to be central to communication. Most lion vocalisations are variations of growling, snarling, meowing and roaring. Other sounds produced include purring, puffing, bleating and humming. Roaring is used to advertise its presence. Lions most often roar at night, a sound that can be heard from a distance of 8 kilometres (5 mi). They tend to roar in a very characteristic manner starting with a few deep, long roars that subside into grunts.\n\n\n== Conservation ==\nThe lion is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. The Indian population is listed on CITES Appendix I and the African population on CITES Appendix II.\n\n\n=== In Africa ===\n\nSeveral large and well-managed protected areas in Africa host large lion populations. Where an infrastructure for wildlife tourism has been developed, cash revenue for park management and local communities is a strong incentive for lion conservation. Most lions now live in East and Southern Africa; their numbers are rapidly decreasing, and fell by an estimated 30–50% in the late half of the 20th century. Primary causes of the decline include disease and human interference. In 1975, it was estimated that since the 1950s, lion numbers had decreased by half to 200,000 or fewer. Estimates of the African lion population range between 16,500 and 47,000 living in the wild in 2002–2004.\nIn the Republic of the Congo, Odzala-Kokoua National Park was considered a lion stronghold in the 1990s. By 2014, no lions were recorded in the protected area so the population is considered locally extinct. The West African lion population is isolated from the one in Central Africa, with little or no exchange of breeding individuals. In 2015, it was estimated that this population consists of about 400 animals, including fewer than 250 mature individuals. They persist in three protected areas in the region, mostly in one population in the W A P protected area complex, shared by Benin, Burkina Faso and Niger. This population is listed as Critically Endangered. Field surveys in the WAP ecosystem revealed that lion occupancy is lowest in the W National Park, and higher in areas with permanent staff and thus better protection.\nA population occurs in Cameroon's Waza National Park, where between approximately 14 and 21 animals persisted as of 2009. In addition, 50 to 150 lions are estimated to be present in Burkina Faso's Arly-Singou ecosystem. In 2015, an adult male lion and a female lion were sighted in Ghana's Mole National Park. These were the first sightings of lions in the country in 39 years. In the same year, a population of up to 200 lions that was previously thought to have been extirpated was filmed in the Alatash National Park, Ethiopia, close to the Sudanese border.\nIn 2005, Lion Conservation Strategies were developed for West and Central Africa, and or East and Southern Africa. The strategies seek to maintain suitable habitat, ensure a sufficient wild prey base for lions, reduce factors that lead to further fragmentation of populations, and make lion–human coexistence sustainable. Lion depredation on livestock is significantly reduced in areas where herders keep livestock in improved enclosures. Such measures contribute to mitigating human–lion conflict.\n\n\n=== In Asia ===\n\nThe last refuge of the Asiatic lion population is the 1,412 km2 (545 sq mi) Gir National Park and surrounding areas in the region of Saurashtra or Kathiawar Peninsula in Gujarat State, India. The population has risen from approximately 180 lions in 1974 to about 400 in 2010. It is geographically isolated, which can lead to inbreeding and reduced genetic diversity. Since 2008, the Asiatic lion has been listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. By 2015, the population had grown to 523 individuals inhabiting an area of 7,000 km2 (2,700 sq mi) in Saurashtra. In 2017, about 650 individuals were recorded during the Asiatic Lion Census.\nThe presence of numerous human settlements close to Gir National Park resulted in conflict between lions, local people and their livestock. Some consider the presence of lions a benefit, as they keep populations of crop damaging herbivores in check.\n\n\n=== Captive breeding ===\n\nLions imported to Europe before the middle of the 19th century were possibly foremost Barbary lions from North Africa, or Cape lions from Southern Africa. Another 11 animals thought to be Barbary lions kept in Addis Ababa Zoo are descendants of animals owned by Emperor Haile Selassie. WildLink International in collaboration with Oxford University launched an ambitious International Barbary Lion Project with the aim of identifying and breeding Barbary lions in captivity for eventual reintroduction into a national park in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco. However, a genetic analysis showed that the captive lions at Addis Ababa Zoo were not Barbary lions, but rather closely related to wild lions in Chad and Cameroon.\nIn 1982, the Association of Zoos and Aquariums started a Species Survival Plan for the Asiatic lion to increase its chances of survival. In 1987, it was found that most lions in North American zoos were hybrids between African and Asiatic lions. Breeding programs need to note origins of the participating animals to avoid cross-breeding different subspecies and thus reducing their conservation value. Captive breeding of lions was halted to eliminate individuals of unknown origin and pedigree. Wild-born lions were imported to American zoos from Africa between 1989 and 1995. Breeding was continued in 1998 in the frame of an African lion Species Survival Plan.\nAbout 77% of the captive lions registered in the International Species Information System in 2006 were of unknown origin; these animals might have carried genes that are extinct in the wild and may therefore be important to the maintenance of the overall genetic variability of the lion.\n\n\n== Interactions with humans ==\n\n\n=== In zoos and circuses ===\n\nLions are part of a group of exotic animals that have been central to zoo exhibits since the late 18th century. Although many modern zoos are more selective about their exhibits, there are more than 1,000 African and 100 Asiatic lions in zoos and wildlife parks around the world. They are considered an ambassador species and are kept for tourism, education and conservation purposes. Lions can live over twenty years in captivity; for example, three sibling lions at the Honolulu Zoo lived to the age of 22 in 2007.\nThe first European \"zoos\" spread among noble and royal families in the 13th century, and until the 17th century were called seraglios. At that time, they came to be called menageries, an extension of the cabinet of curiosities. They spread from France and Italy during the Renaissance to the rest of Europe. In England, although the seraglio tradition was less developed, lions were kept at the Tower of London in a seraglio established by King John in the 13th century; this was probably stocked with animals from an earlier menagerie started in 1125 by Henry I at his hunting lodge in Woodstock, Oxfordshire, where according to William of Malmesbury lions had been stocked.\nLions were kept in cramped and squalid conditions at London Zoo until a larger lion house with roomier cages was built in the 1870s. Further changes took place in the early 20th century when Carl Hagenbeck designed enclosures with concrete \"rocks\", more open space and a moat instead of bars, more closely resembling a natural habitat. Hagenbeck designed lion enclosures for both Melbourne Zoo and Sydney's Taronga Zoo; although his designs were popular, the use of bars and caged enclosures prevailed in many zoos until the 1960s. In the late 20th century, larger, more natural enclosures and the use of wire mesh or laminated glass instead of lowered dens allowed visitors to come closer than ever to the animals; some attractions such as the Cat Forest/Lion Overlook of Oklahoma City Zoological Park placed the den on ground level, higher than visitors.\nLion taming has been part of both established circuses and individual acts such as Siegfried & Roy. The practice began in the early 19th century by Frenchman Henri Martin and American Isaac Van Amburgh, who both toured widely and whose techniques were copied by a number of followers. Van Amburgh performed before Queen Victoria in 1838 when he toured Great Britain. Martin composed a pantomime titled Les Lions de Mysore (\"the lions of Mysore\"), an idea Amburgh quickly borrowed. These acts eclipsed equestrianism acts as the central display of circus shows and entered public consciousness in the early 20th century with cinema. In demonstrating the superiority of human over animal, lion taming served a purpose similar to animal fights of previous centuries. The ultimate proof of a tamer's dominance and control over a lion is demonstrated by the placing of the tamer's head in the lion's mouth. The now-iconic lion tamer's chair was possibly first used by American Clyde Beatty (1903–1965).\n\n\n=== Hunting and games ===\n\nLion hunting has occurred since ancient times and was often a royal tradition, intended to demonstrate the power of the king over nature. Such hunts took place in a reserved area in front of an audience. The monarch was accompanied by his men and controls were put in place to increase their safety and ease of killing. The earliest surviving record of lion hunting is an ancient Egyptian inscription dated circa 1380 BC that mentions Pharaoh Amenhotep III killing 102 lions in ten years \"with his own arrows\". The Assyrian emperor Ashurbanipal had one of his lion hunts depicted on a sequence of Assyrian palace reliefs c. 640 BC, known as the Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal. Lions were also hunted during the Mughal Empire, where Emperor Jahangir is said to have excelled at it. In Ancient Rome, lions were kept by emperors for hunts, gladiator fights and executions.\nThe Maasai people have traditionally viewed the killing of lions as a rite of passage. Historically, lions were hunted by individuals, however, due to reduced lion populations, elders discourage solo lion hunts. During the European colonisation of Africa in the 19th century, the hunting of lions was encouraged because they were considered pests and lion skins were sold for £1 each. The widely reproduced imagery of the heroic hunter chasing lions would dominate a large part of the century. Trophy hunting of lions in recent years has been met with controversy, notably with the killing of Cecil the lion in mid-2015.\n\n\n=== Man-eating ===\n\nLions do not usually hunt humans but some (usually males) seem to seek them out. One well-publicised case is the Tsavo maneaters; in 1898, 28 officially recorded railway workers building the Uganda Railway were taken by lions over nine months during the construction of a bridge in Kenya. The hunter who killed the lions wrote a book detailing the animals' predatory behaviour; they were larger than normal and lacked manes, and one seemed to suffer from tooth decay. The infirmity theory, including tooth decay, is not favoured by all researchers; an analysis of teeth and jaws of man-eating lions in museum collections suggests that while tooth decay may explain some incidents, prey depletion in human-dominated areas is a more likely cause of lion predation on humans. Sick or injured animals may be more prone to man-eating but the behaviour is not unusual, nor necessarily aberrant.\nLions' proclivity for man-eating has been systematically examined. American and Tanzanian scientists report that man-eating behaviour in rural areas of Tanzania increased greatly from 1990 to 2005. At least 563 villagers were attacked and many eaten over this period. The incidents occurred near Selous Game Reserve in Rufiji River and in Lindi Region near the Mozambican border. While the expansion of villages into bush country is one concern, the authors argue conservation policy must mitigate the danger because in this case, conservation contributes directly to human deaths. Cases in Lindi in which lions seize humans from the centres of substantial villages have been documented. Another study of 1,000 people attacked by lions in southern Tanzania between 1988 and 2009 found that the weeks following the full moon, when there was less moonlight, were a strong indicator of increased night-time attacks on people.\nAccording to Robert R. Frump, Mozambican refugees regularly crossing Kruger National Park, South Africa, at night are attacked and eaten by lions; park officials have said man-eating is a problem there. Frump said thousands may have been killed in the decades after apartheid sealed the park and forced refugees to cross the park at night. For nearly a century before the border was sealed, Mozambicans had regularly crossed the park in daytime with little harm.\n\n\n=== Cultural significance ===\n\nThe lion is one of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture. It has been extensively depicted in sculptures and paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature. It is considered to be the monarch of the beasts; symbolizing power, royalty and protection. Several leaders have had \"lion\" in their name including Sundiata Keita of the Mali Empire, who was called \"Lion of Mali\", and Richard the Lionheart of England. The male's mane makes it a particularly recognisable feature and thus has been represented more than the female. Nevertheless, the lioness has also had importance as a guardian.\nIn sub-Saharan Africa, the lion has been a common character in stories, proverbs and dances, but rarely featured in visual arts.  In the Swahili language, the lion is known as simba which also means \"aggressive\", \"king\" and \"strong\". In parts of West and East Africa, the lion is associated with healing and provides the connection between seers and the supernatural. In other East African traditions, the lion represents laziness. In much of African folklore, the lion is portrayed as having low intelligence and is easily tricked by other animals.  In Ancient Egypt, lions were linked both with the sun and the waters of the Nile. Several gods were conceived as being partially lion including the war deities Sekhmet and Maahes, and Tefnut the goddess of moisture. Shu, god of the air, was depicted kneeing between two lions while holding a headrest. The lions mark where the sun rises and sets and symbolise yesterday and tomorrow. In Nubia, The lion-god Apedemak was associated with the flooding of the Nile.\n\nThe lion was a prominent symbol in ancient Mesopotamia from Sumer up to Assyrian and Babylonian times, where it was strongly associated with kingship. The big cat was a symbol and steed of fertility goddess Inanna. Lions decorate the Processional Way leading to the Ishtar Gate in Babylon which was built by the Nebuchadnezzar II in the 6th century BCE. The Lion of Babylon symbolized the power of the king and protector of the land against enemies, but was also invoked for good luck. The constellation Leo the lion was first recognised by the Sumerians around 4,000 years ago and is considered to be the fifth sign of the zodiac. Lions are frequently mentioned in the Bible, notably in the Book of Daniel, in which the eponymous hero refuses to worship King Darius and is forced to sleep in the lions' den where he is miraculously unharmed (Dan 6). In the Book of Judges, Samson kills a lion as he travels to visit a Philistine woman.(Judg 14). The power and ferocity of the lion is invoked when describing the anger of God (Amos 3:4–8, Lam 3:10) and the menace of Israel's enemies (Psalm 17:12, Jer 2:30) and Satan (1 Pet 5:8). The book of Isaiah uses the imagery of a lion laying with a calf and child, and eating straw to portray the harmony of creation (Isa 11:6–7). In the Book of Revelation, a lion, an ox, a man and an eagle are seen on a heavenly throne in John's vision;(Rev 4:7).\n\nIndo-Persian chroniclers regarded the lion as keeper of order in the realm of animals. The Sanskrit word mrigendra signifies a lion as king of animals in general or deer in particular. In India, the Lion Capital of Ashoka, erected by Emperor Ashoka in the 3rd century CE, depicts four lions standing back to back. In Hindu mythology, the half-lion Narasimha, an avatar of the deity Vishnu, battles and slays the evil ruler Hiranyakashipu. Though they were never native to the country, lions have played important roles in Chinese culture. Statues of the beast have guarded the entrances to the imperial palace and many religious shrines. The lion dance has been performed in China and beyond for over a thousand years. In Buddhist art, lions are associated with both arhats and bodhisattvas and may be ridden by the Manjushri.\nIn ancient Greece, the lion is featured in several of Aesop's fables, notably The Lion and the Mouse. In Greek mythology, the Nemean lion is slain by the hero Heracles who wears its skin. Lancelot and Gawain were also heroes slaying lions in medieval Europe. In some medieval stories, lions were portrayed as allies and companions. Lions continue to appear in modern literature such as the Cowardly Lion in L. Frank Baum's 1900 The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, and in C. S. Lewis's The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The lion's role as king of the beasts has been used in the 1994 Disney animated feature film The Lion King.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Books ===\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n Media related to Lion at Wikimedia Commons\nIUCN/SSC Cat Specialist Group. \"Lion Panthera leo\".\n\"Lion Conservation Fund\".\nThe Portugal News (2014). \"Rare desert lion killed in Angola after supplying unprecedented data\".

        "content": "The Mor Dimet Church (Turkish: Mor Dimet Kilisesi, Syriac: ܥܝܬܐ ܕ ܡܪ, romanized: ʿyta d mr) is a Syriac Orthodox church in Midyat, Mardin Province, southeastern Turkey. The Early Christianity church was restored, and reopened in 2021.\nThe Mor Dimet Church is a Syriac Orthodox church built in Early Christianity and located at the village (administratively: a neighborhood) of İzbırak (in Syriac: Zāz) in Midyat district, Mardin Province, southeastern Turkey.\nOnce, around one hundred Assyrian Turkish families lived in the village. In the early 1990s, the Assyrians of the last Zaz village in the Tur Abdin region left their village due to terrorist attacks. Following the emigration of the villagers to Europe and the United States, the village turned into a ghost town in 1993. A priest and a nun have been living in the church for years, and protected the village. In 2001, a house and a bell tower were built  in the church courtyard. The government decided the demolition of these additional structures in 2012. \nThe Assyrians, who returned home when peace was established in the region, started a project for the restoration of the church. After two years of work, the church was  reopened  for worship on 26 September 2021. A ceremonial worship took place on 11 October 2021 attended by the Midyat Metropolit and guest priests from various European countries.\nThere are various dates about when the church was built. Some sources give the date of completion as the 4th century, the 5th century, the time when the Assyrians accepted Christianity, or 7th century. \nGabriel Rabo from the University of Göttingen in Germany, a former village resident, states that \"there are also Akkadian cuneiform reliefs on the church building's outer walls, dating back to pre-Christian times. The name of Zaz village was mentioned as 'Zazabukha' in other tablets, and that this region was used as a military headquarters in a tablet dating back to 879 BC.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Roderick Macleod (died 1852) was a Scottish physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMacleod was a native of Scotland. He was educated at Edinburgh, where he graduated M.D. on 1 August 1816, his thesis being 'De Tetano.' After a brief career in the army, from which he retired on half-pay, he settled in London. By 1822 he was physician to the Westminster General Dispensary, to the Infirmary for Children, and to the Scottish Hospital in London. He was admitted a licentiate of the College of Physicians on 22 December 1821, and a fellow on 9 July 1836. In 1837 he read the Gulstonian lectures, and became consiliarius in 1839. On 13 Feb. 1833 he was elected physician to St. George's Hospital, and resigned that office in consequence of ill-health in 1845. Macleod, who was a member of the Medico-Chirurgical Society of London and of the Royal Medical Society of Edinburgh, died at Chanonry, Old Aberdeen, on 7 Dec. 1852.\nMacleod became in July 1822 editor and proprietor of the London 'Medical and Physical Journal,' which had been previously issued under the title of the 'Medical and Physical Journal,' Though the times were stormy for advocates of medical reform, Macleod conducted the paper with tact and ability. He was assisted in the editorship by John Bacot, M.D. In 1842 he published, with large additions, his Gulstonian lectures 'On Rheumatism in its various forms, and on the Affections of Internal Organs, more especially the Heart and Brain, to which it gives rise,' 8vo, London.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Goodwin, Gordon (1893). \"Macleod, Roderick\".

        "content": "Soviet Union and Democratic Republic of Afghanistan Air Force jet fighters and bombers would occasionally cross into Pakistani airspace to target Afghan refugee camps in Pakistan. To counter the Soviet jets, the United States started providing F-16 jets to Pakistan. These F-16 jets lacked the capability to fire radar-guided beyond-visual range missiles, and thus they were required to get close to their opponents in order to use their AIM-9P and more advanced AIM-9L Sidewinder heat-seeking or their 20-millimeter Vulcan cannons.\n\n\n== DRA-Soviet intrusions into Pakistani airspace ==\nDuring the war Soviet and DRA planes intruded many times into Pakistani airspace in order to bomb refugee camps set up in the Pakistani provinces of Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. These bombing campaigns led to the deaths of 300+ Afghan refugees. It was reported that DRA and Soviet planes intruded into Pakistani airspace more than 1300 times.\n\n\n== 1st March 1980 Il-26 interception ==\nA Soviet Ilyushin Il-26 on 1st March 1980 entered Pakistani airspace and was intercepted by PAF squadron 15 but the pilots were instructed not to engage.\n\n\n== February 1986 Mig-21 interception ==\nPAF fighters intercepted a couple of Mig-21s in February 1986. However, the PAF pilots were ordered not to engage them.\n\n\n== Second Battle of Zhawar ==\n\nThe second phase of the offensive was to be an airborne assault carried out by the Afghan 37th Commando Brigade and the 466th Commando Brigade. The initial assault group, transported by 6 Mi-8 helicopters, departed on 2 April, but they got lost in the darkness and accidentally landed on the wrong side of the Pakistani border. This force was quickly surrounded and atleast 120 commandos were taken prisoner. The Afghan and Soviet forces won a pyrrhic victory but took heavy casualties, as the Mujahideen claimed to have destroyed 24 helicopters and 2 jets, and captured 530 prisoners, while the Mujahideen themselves sustained a loss of 281 killed and 363 injured. Of the 500 Afghan prisoners, 78 officers were tried and executed by Haqqani and Khalis, including the commander of the 38th Commando Brigade, Colonel Qalandar Shah.\n\n\n== 29 April 1986 F-16 Shootdown ==\nOn 29 April 1986, the Afghan Air Force claimed to have shot down a Pakistani Air Force F-16 fighter jet after two jets intruded Afghanistan’s airspace and crossed into Paktia Province, more specifically into Khost. Afghan authorities claimed that the F-16s were warned and then fired upon, whereas Pakistani authorities claimed they never violated Afghan airspace and that six Afghan aircraft violated Pakistani airspace which resulted in two F-16s being sent to intercept them.\n\n\n== 17 May 1986 Su-17 shoot down ==\nOn 17 May 1986, two Pakistan Air Force (PAF) F-16 jets intercepted two Su-22M3K belonging to Democratic Republic of Afghanistan Air Force (DRAAF) near the Pakistani airspace. Pakistani officials insisted that both the fighter jets belonging to DRAAF were shot down while Afghan officials confirmed loss of only one fighter jet. Following the engagement, there was a major decline in the number of attacks on Afghan refugee camps in Pakistan.\n\n\n== 16 April 1987 Su-22 shoot down ==\nOn 16 April 1987, a group of PAF F-16s again chased down two DRAAF Su-22 and managed to shoot down one of them and capture its pilot.\n\n\n== Battle of Khost ==\n\nIn 1987, the Soviet Union reported that Pakistani fighter jets were roaming in Afghan airspace, harassing attempts to aerial resupply the besieged Afghan Army and Soviet Army garrisons in the province of Khost.\n\n\n== 30 March 1987 An-26 shoot down ==\nOn 30 March 1987, two PAF F-16s shot down an An-26 cargo plane, killing all 39 personnel on board the aircraft.\n\n\n== 1987 F-16 friendly fire accident ==\nAlso in 1987, two PAF F-16 jets ambushed four Mig-23 which were bombing Mujahideen supply bases. In the clash, one PAF F-16 was lost after it was accidentally hit by an AIM-9 Sidewinder fired by the second PAF F-16. The PAF pilot landed in Afghanistan territory and was smuggled back to Pakistan along with wreckage of his aircraft by the Mujahideen. However, some Russian sources claim that the F-16 was shot down by a Mig-23, though the Soviet Mig-23 were not carrying air-to-air missiles.\n\n\n== Capture of Alexander Rutskoy ==\nOn 8 August 1988, Colonel Alexander Rutskoy was leading a group of Sukhoi Su-25 fighter jets to attack a refugee camp in Miranshah, Pakistan. His fighter jet was intercepted and shot down by two PAF F-16. Colonel Alexander Rutskoy landed in Pakistani territory and was captured. He was later exchanged back to the Soviet Union.\n\n\n== September 1987 Mig-23 ambush ==\nIn September 1987, around twelve Mig-23 crossed into Pakistani airspace with the aim to lure into ambush the Pakistani F-16s. Two PAF F-16s flew towards the Soviet fighter jets. The Soviet radars failed to detect the low flying F-16s, and the Sidewinder fired by one of the F-16s damaged one of the Mig-23. However, the damaged Mig-23 managed to return home. Two Mig-23 engaged the two PAF F-16s. The Pakistani officials state that both Mig-23 planes were shot down. However, Soviet records show that no additional aircraft were lost that day.\n\n\n== 3 November 1988 Su-2M4K shoot down ==\nThe last aerial engagement took place on 3 November 1988, in which one Su-2M4K belonging to DRAAF was shot down by a Pakistani Air Force jet.\n\n\n== Stinger attacks by Pakistan army ==\nThe Pakistan Army fired twenty-eight Stingers at Soviet aircraft near the border destroying two DRA transport planes and killing 79.\n\n\n== Other confrontations ==\nIn the coming years, PAF claimed credit for shooting down several Mi-8 transport helicopters, and another An-26 which was on a reconnaissance mission in 1989.\n\n\n== Casualties ==\nDuring the conflict, Pakistan Air Force F-16 had shot down ten aircraft, belonging to Soviet Union, which had intruded into Pakistani territory. However, the Soviet record only confirmed five kills (three Su-22s, one Su-25 and one An-26). Some sources show that PAF had shot down at least a dozen more aircraft during the war. However, those kills were not officially acknowledged because they took place in Afghanistan's airspace and acknowledging those kills would mean that Afghan airspace was violated by PAF. In all, Pakistan Air Force F-16s had downed 3 Su-22,1 Su-25,2 Mig-23,2 An-26, and Several Mi-8 while 1 Mig-23 was damaged. Pakistani army also shot down 2 An-26 aircraft. Furthermore 6 Mi-6 and 120 personnel were captured during the Second Battle of Zhawar by Pakistani forces.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSoviet-Afghan war\nOperation Cyclone\nBadaber uprising\nAfghanistan-Pakistan skirmishes\n1970s operation in Balochistan\nOperation Curtain\nBattle for Hill 3234\nBattle of Jaji\nSiege of Khost\nOperation Magistral\nFirst Battle of Zhawar\nSecond Battle of Zhawar\nRaids inside Soviet Union during Soviet Afghan War\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Thomas Milner (1719 – 13 September 1797) was an English physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMilner was the son of John Milner, a presbyterian minister, was born at Peckham, near London, where his father preached and kept a school famous in literature from the fact that Goldsmith was in 1757 one of its ushers (Forster, Life of Goldsmith). He graduated M.D. at St. Andrews 20 June 1740, and in 1759 was elected physician to St. Thomas's Hospital. He became a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians 30 September 1760, but in 1762 resigned his physiciancy at St. Thomas's, and settled in Maidstone, where he attained to large practice and used to walk to the parish church every Sunday bearing a gold-headed cane, and followed in linear succession by the three unmarried sisters who lived with him. In 1783 he published in London ‘Experiments and Observations on Electricity,’ a work in which he described some of the effects which an electrical power is capable of producing on conducting substances, similar effects of the same power on electric bodies themselves, and observations on the air, electric repulsion, the electrified cup, and the analogy between electricity and magnetism. He died at Maidstone 13 September 1797, and is buried in All Saints' Church there.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Moore, Norman (1894). \"Milner, Thomas\".

He is supposed to have been educated at Trinity College, Dublin, and was entered at Leyden on 26 August 1745 (Peacock, Index, p. 72). Mushet was also a member of King's College, Cambridge, and proceeded M.D. there in 1746, becoming a candidate of the College of Physicians on 4 April 1748 and a fellow on 20 March 1749. He delivered in 1751 the Gulstonian lectures. He was made physician in chief to the forces, and served at the battle of Minden (1759), but declined an offer of a baronetcy for his services in that campaign.\nMushet was intimately connected with the Duke of Rutland, and had apartments for eleven years at Belvoir Castle. He died at York on 11 December 1792. A monument was erected to his memory by his daughter Mary in the church of St. Mary Castlegate, York, with a long inscription written by Sir Robert Sinclair, recorder of York.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Scott, Lucy Maude Manson (1894). \"Mushet, William\".

        "content": "BN (:B:N:, Biaz nazwy; Belarusian: БН, \"Бяз назвы\") is a Belarusian rock band founded in 1999 in Byaroza, in the Brest Region. The leader of the band is vocalist and guitarist Alaksandr Lutycz, the only member who has remained in the group continuously since its inception. The lyrics of BN's songs are written in the Belarusian language, with most of them authored by Siarhiej Maszkowicz. The band's musical style can be characterized as alternative rock with elements of grunge, punk rock, and alternative metal. Apart from Belarus, the group has also performed multiple times in Poland.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Beginnings and Nie trywaj (1999–2004) ===\nThe band was founded in December 1999 by vocalist and guitarist Alaksandr Lutycz. The original lineup also included drummer Ramuald Paźniak, guitarist Iwan Kiwatycki, and bassist Juryj Ściapanau, while the lyrics were written by Siarhiej Maszkowicz from the beginning. The first concert took place in Baranavichy together with the band Mlecznyj put'. In October 2000, Iwan Kiwatycki left the band and was replaced by Andrej Łuhaj. In December, the musicians participated in the Tri szurupa festival in Grodno. In 2001, the group won the Rok-koła festival in Novopolotsk with the song Woś takuju b... in the Best Lyrical Song category, and in August they made their debut at the Basovišča Festival of Young Belarusian Music. In November, Maksim Litwiniec replaced Andrej Łuhaj. In the spring of 2002, the band released a demo album titled Praz siabie, featuring ten compositions. That summer, BN performed at the Basovišča festival again, this time winning the Gmina Gródek Award. Thanks to this victory, the band appeared as headliners at many subsequent editions of the festival. In November 2002, Juryj Ściapanau left the band, and Maksim Szołachau took over as bassist.On 2 June 2003, the musicians began recording their debut album. In March 2004, the band appeared on two programs of the first channel of Belarusian state television – the telefestival Na skryžawańniach Jeuropy and the program Kropka. On April 21, the group released the single Harady on their website. Four days later, the band performed at the Hienierały ajczynnaha roku festival in Minsk. On 27 April 2004, BN released their first studio album, Nie trywaj. In addition to original tracks, the album also included four songs from the demo album in new arrangements. The album presentation was scheduled for May 15 at the Fłaminha club in Byaroza but was canceled due to reasons beyond the band's control.\n\n\n=== From Żywie rock'n'roll to Krok za krokam (2004–2012) ===\nOn 11 August 2004, the band released the single Spirali. In 2006, the group began collaborating with manager Igor Znyk, which resulted in an increase in the number of concerts. That summer, BN performed in Poland at the Union of Rock festival in Węgorzewo and the IV Fląder Pop Festival in Gdańsk. In the summer of that year, the band released their second studio album Żywie rock'n'roll!. On December 1, the album was presented at the Juła club in Minsk. In 2007, the band actively toured both in Poland and Belarus. They also participated in several festivals and galas, such as Rok-karanacyja, Adboryszcza, and Basovišča. In August, music videos for the songs Dażdżami and Kryły were filmed in Warsaw. Over the next two years, the band continued their concert activities.\nOn 20 November 2009, the band celebrated their tenth anniversary at the R-club in Minsk. The concert featured guest performances by the bands IQ48, Krok, Kalmary, Bee, as well as Alaksandr Kulinkowicz and Aleh Chamienka. In March 2010, the musicians announced the start of work on new material at the Siełach studio in Minsk. Alaksandr Lutych also announced that BN would record two songs in Russian for the first time in its history, but this ultimately did not happen. On June 24, the band released the single Żyćcio majo as a teaser for their upcoming album. On November 27, a joint concert of BN and IQ48 took place. On 30 July 2011, the band performed at the 3rd Rock Music Festival Rockowisko in Hajnówka as the only foreign band, receiving enthusiastic reception from the audience. On 4 April 2012, BN released the single Zrabi siabie sam, consisting of two songs from the upcoming album. On 20 September 2012, the band published their third studio album Krok za krokam on the Euroradio website. It featured fourteen original tracks and a cover of the song Czyrwonaja ruża by the Belarusian folk rock band Piesniary. The album presentation took place on 10 October 2012, at the Re:Public club in Minsk.\n\n\n=== Szukaj swajo and Kodżyccia (from 2013) ===\nOn 14 March 2013, the band released the acoustic single Nie trywaj, which served as a preview for the Acoustic EP album. The album was published on April 17, featuring six BN's hits in acoustic versions. In the summer of 2013, the band underwent another lineup change – guitarist Jury Bardouski and bassist Alaksandr Silicki replaced Maksim Litwiniec and Alaksandr Zajcau. On 7 October 2013, the band released a double A-side single Palusy/Wiartannie. In November 2014, the group presented the second part of the acoustic project, featuring piano arrangements.

On November 21 of that year, the band held a joint concert with the Polish rock band Lao Che, for which they prepared an electric version of the title track from the album Szukaj swajo. The studio recording of the electric version was published on 31 October 2016. Earlier, on 10 February 2016, the band released the single Chwali, featuring the drummer of IQ48 and beatmaker Tony Fadd, with lyrics written by the vocalist of IQ48, Jauhien Buzouski. On 17 September 2017, BN released another single Biaży za mnoj. Six days later, the band performed on the Belsat Music Live program, broadcast by the Belsat TV channel, where they performed five songs.At the turn of 2017 and 2018, the band recorded songs for a new album.

It is located a short distance north of Singhpur village in Ashoknagar district, Madhya Pradesh, India. The stepwell was built by Rājamatī who is named in the inscription inserted in one of the walls of the structure. \n\nThe inscription, composed in a mixture of Sanskrit and old Hindi, presents an unusual biography of Rājamatī, the patron. She is said by the text to have received gifts from the Sultans of the seven leading kingdoms of the time, and built the water facility for travellers as an honourable act of public piety (dānadharma). \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Theophilus Nii Kpakpo Allotey is a Ghanaian boxer. He started boxing at a very tender age and passed through the juvenile stage, Black Rocket before he was promoted to the senior level to be part of the Black Bombers.\nIn 2021, Allotey was selected to be part of Black Bombers, the Ghana boxing team. \nIn 2022, he won gold at the 2022 Individual Championships held at the Accra Sports Stadium and Bukom Boxing Arena. In June 2022, there were frustrations after he was left out of Ghana's squad for the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham. This was because the competition was also a selection event for the boxing team. These comments included ones from the coach of the Black Bombers, Kwasi Ofori Asare coming out publicly to say that Allotey was in the nine-member squad for the games, well endorsed by all stakeholders and therefore he had no idea why he had been dropped by the Ghana Boxing Federation.\nHe competed in the men's flyweight event at the 2023 African Boxing Olympic Qualification Tournament. He lost his semi-final bout with Ala Eddine Zidi and therefore lost a spot to qualify for the Olympics even though he secured a bronze medal by reaching the semi-finals. \nIn March 2024, Allotey competed in the 2024 World Boxing Olympic Qualification Tournament 1 in Italy. He competed in the 51 kg winning his first two bouts before being eliminated. \nIn 2024, He competed in the flyweight boxing category during the 2023 African Games hosted by Ghana. He was highly rated amongst the top boxers to possibly earn Ghana a gold medal but he fell short after being defeated by Olympic-bound Patrick Chinyemba in the semi-final. The defeat meant he had to settle for the bronze medal.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBoxing record for Theophilus Allotey from BoxRec (registration required)",

        "content": "The Church of St Gregory of Tigran Honents, or Church of Saint Gregory the Illuminator is a medieval religious structure located in Ani, in Turkey's Kars province next to the closed border with Armenia. It was built by the Armenian Tigran Honents under the Zakarids in 1215, according to an inscription in Armenian on the exterior of the church.\n\n\n== Context ==\nThe building of the church came at a tumultuous period: in 1064 the city of Ani had been captured by the Seljuks from the Byzantines, who granted it to a Kurdish line of muslim emirs known as the Sheddadids. Then in 1199, the Zakarids, vassals of the Kingdom of Georgia, captured Ani with a combined Georgian and Armenian army. Their reconquest of Ani and a large part of historical Armenia greatly revived the fortunes of the region, essentially thanks to increased trade. The actual extent of the Zakarians' vassalship towards the Georgian crown remains unknown, but it may have been purely nominal, especially since as they adopted \"the trappings of both Christian and Muslim royal power\", as shown in their adoption of the title \"Shahanshah\" (king of kings) for their names and titles. In the dedicatory inscription of Tigran Honents, the Zakarians are referred to as the only \"overlords\", and the \"powerful masters of the universe\".   \nAfter only a few dedades of restored Armenian control, Ani was then captured and destroyed by the Mongols in 1239, during the disastrous campaign leading to the Georgian–Mongolian treaty of 1239.\n\n\n== Construction ==\nThe Zakarids were active builders of religious monuments as shown by the church of Tigran Honents, or the Church of Kizkale, also in Ani.\n\n\n=== Style ===\nThe interior of the church is covered in frescoes, which all follow Byzantine styles and layout. A large cycle (17 out of 18 scenes) is dedicated to Saint Gregory the llluminator, who was the evangelist of Armenia, but the murals also include one scene devoted to Saint Nino, the evangelist of Georgia. The various pictorial scenes are identified exclusively with painted labels in Greek and Georgian. \nInscriptions in Armenian are found engraved on the walls outside of the church, and are dedicatory in nature. Numerous sculptures, mainly representing animals and decorating walls and pillar capitals also have Armenian inscriptions: each carved stone in the church is engraved with a letter in the Armenian alphabet, probably used as mason's marks. \nThe church has a large quantity of murals, many of them depicting the events of the life of Tiridates III of Armenia (\"Trdat\"), the first Christian ruler of Armenia. The paintings are focused on the main feasts of the Chalcedonian Church. They may have been completed a few years after the construction of the church, but they are still the earliest known fresco program in Ani. The paintings, exclusively labelled in Georgian, may have belonged to a Georgian artistic tradition, as suggested by style, technique (intense blue backgrounds), and iconographical details.\nIslamic features have also been identified in the muqarnas decorative elements of some of the capitals, and in the sculptures on the outside of the church, especially in the animal repertoire.\n\n\n=== Attribution ===\n\nAni and its region had mixed confessional identities, with Armenians being mainly Monophysites, and Georgians and Greeks mainly Chalcedonian Christians, and relations were often conflictual. But the boundaries were moveable: Ivane I Zakarian had converted to Chalcedonism in the early 13th century, and a significant number of Armenians had followed him, voluntarily or not.\nIn St Gregory of Tigran Honents, the combination of scenes with the myths of the evangelists of Armenia and Georgia might suggest a conflation of Armenian Monophysite and Georgian Chalcedonian rites. Still, the dedication by Tigran Honents is Monophysite in nature as it is made in the name of the \"three holy councils and the nine choirs of angels\". The style and iconography of the paintings does borrow from Georgian art and uses inscriptions in Georgian only, but several characteristics are decidedly Armenian and relate to Monophysism. Armenia relatively lacked a tradition of monumental painting at the time, so there is a possibility that Georgian artists had to be hired in order to accomplish the pictorial program.\nSince the donator was identified as Armenian Monophysite in his inscription, but on the other hand the artistic program rather reflected the Chalcedonian faith, the church may also have belonged to a Chalcedonian community of Armenians, who had chosen to adopt Georgian styles and practices. Prefering to only take into account the style of the murals, one author has simplistically presented the church as a \"Georgian church\".\nAlternatively, although the donator of the church was Armenian, the church may have served a larger community of both Armenians and Georgians. The Zakarids may also have promoted a level of ambiguity between the two faiths, and voluntarily mixed elements from both, minimizing differences, possibly as a political expedient helping them better rule their realm. This may be seen in the light of their other known efforts at church councils to bring together the Monophysite and Chalcedonian faiths, especially at the level of their outward expression, such as procedures and visual elements.\n\n\n=== Dedication ===\nThe church was dedicated by the Armenian Tigran Honents (Dikran Honents), as declared in an inscription in Armenian on the southern wall of the church:\n\nIn the year 664 [1215], by the mercy of God, when the powerful master of the universe Amirspasalar and Mandaturtukhutsesi Zakare and his son Shahnshah became masters of this city of Ani, I Dikran, servant of God, son of Sulem of the Smpadawrents, of the Honents clan, for the sake of the long life of my lords and their sons built this monastery of St. Krikor, which used to be called \"Mother of God of the Chapel\", which was at a precipice and with wooded places, which I bought with my legitimate treasure from the hereditary owners, and by means of much labor and treasure I enclosed this church with a wall all around. I built this church in the name of Saint Krikor the Enlightener and adorned it with many ornaments, with symbols of salvation, with holy crosses of gold and silver, and painted images, adorned with gold and silver and jewels and pearl, and with lanterns of gold and silver, and with relics of the holy apostles, of the martyrs, and with part of the dominical cross that has received God, and with all kinds of utensils of gold and silver, and with numerous ornaments. I built all kinds of habitations for the monks and princes, and arranged in them priests who celebrate the mass of the body and blood of Christ to perform mass without obstruction for the long life of my lords Shahnshah and his sons, and for the absolution of my sins; and I gave this gift to this monastery of St. Krikor land which I had bought with treasure and by decision of the masters of the land, and which I had built from the foundation... [list of gifts] Now, if any of the great or small of my [people] or of foreigners attempt to obstruct what is written in my inscription, or usurp things from the products which are established in it, or obstruct the memory of this sinning servant of God for any reason, let such an individual be excluded from the glory of the son of God and inherit the punishment of Cain and Judas on his person and be anathematized by the three holy councils and the nine orders of angels and be responsible for our sins in front of God; and those who are obliging and keep firm are blessed by God. Israegh [Israel] the Scribe.\nTigran Honentsis also known to have sponsored the renovation of a staircase in the Cathedral of Ani in 1213, and the building of the Monastery of the Virgins, also at Ani.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nKalas, Veronica (2008). \"The Georgian Aspects of Medieval Architecture at Ani in the Thirteenth Century: The Church of Tigran Honents and the Mosque of Minuchir\".

        "content": "Oleh Petrovych Korostelyov (Ukrainian: Оле́г Петро́вич Коростельо́в; born 9 November 1949) is a Ukrainian engineer, research and professor who is a recipient of both the Hero of Ukraine and Order of Merit. Since 2003, he has been the director general of Luch Design Bureau. His areas of expertise include guided weapons systems and automated operation of specialized aircraft equipment.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBorn on 9 November 1949, in the Ukrainian city of Kirovohrad. He started attending secondary school No. 6 m. Kirovohrad in 1956. He received a silver medal upon graduating from high school in 1966. He enrolled at the Kyiv Institute of Civil Aviation Engineers (now National Aviation University) in 1967 and earned his electronic computer degree with honors in 1972.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1978, Korostelyov resumed his employment at the Octava company. Since 2003, he has transitioned from engineer-designer to director-general of the Luch Design Bureau. Under his direct supervision, automatic control tools for special aviation equipment were developed that meet international standards. The Gurt complex, in particular, is now effectively operating in over 30 nations.\nKorostelyov has been personally involved in research and development since 1997, working on items related to the following topics: Combat, Stugna, Edge, Coper, and R-360 Neptune. Based on this, Luch Design Bureau went on to produce a range of highly accurate weaponry, including Barrier and Skif. He has been the company's director general and general designer since December 2003.\n\nFollowing the annexation of Crimea and War in Donbas in 2013, Korostelyov-led Luch created the first Ukrainian UAV, known as Sokil-2. The Ukrainian Ground Forces now uses it with success. Additionally, the bureau is completing the creation of the Sokil-200 UCAV, which has a cutting-edge navigation system and four anti-tank missiles. In addition, he turned the Soviet Union's Smerch into the Alder and built the country's Bayraktar, and the Sokil-300 UCAV.\nSince 2016, the company's profit has climbed by 25 times to 516 million UAH, while its income has increased by 13 times to 6.7 billion UAH. Three-quarters of the company's clients are overseas, mostly from the Middle East; the remaining 65% are state consumers. In 2018, the Ukrainian Armed Forces adopted the Vilkha. Later on, Vilkha-M, the improved version, emerged. In April 2019, Alder-M had its initial testing.\nAdopted in 2020, the R-360 Neptune was announced to have the potential to become a weapon of mass destruction. The government contemplated creating a position of Deputy Prime Minister for the him in March that same year, and Korostelyov was the lone applicant taken into consideration. He also declined to take a role in the incoming Cabinet of Ministers in spite of this. He consented to take on the role of chairman of National Aviation University's supervisory board on 6 December 2023. Ten scholarships have been awarded by the National Association of Defense Industry Enterprises of Ukraine to assist students wishing to attend National Aviation University.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nKorostelyov was born into a military family. He has three flats in Kyiv, a property in Novi Petrivtsi, the hamlet where Viktor Yushchenko was born, many land parcels in the Kyiv Oblast, an unfinished dacha, and two pricey SUVs, a Mercedes-Benz GLS350 and a Nissan Pathfinder. His salary is around 600,000 hryvnias per year.\n\n\n== Awards and recognitions ==\nHe received the Ministry of Defence's distinction in 2015 and an honorary breastplate for his contributions to the Ukrainian Armed Forces in 2016. Notably, he was awarded the title of Candidate of Technical Sciences in 2002, and later the Doctor of Technical Sciences with a focus on Arms and Military Equipment in 2008. Korostelyov has received awards and recognitions such as:\n\n Hero of Ukraine Order of the State (22 August 2020)\n Order of Merit First Class (2 May 2018)\n Order of Merit Second Class (21 August 2015)\n Order of Merit Third Class (19 August 2008)\nHonored Machine Builder of Ukraine (24 September 2004)\nState Prize of Ukraine in Science and Technology (1999)\nKyiv Badge of Honor (23 November 2022)\nHonorary Aircraft Builder of Ukraine\nDoctor of Technical Sciences (2008)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

The election was held as part of the statewide local elections in Queensland, Australia.\nIncumbent mayor Les Tyrell chose to retire from politics and did not recontest his position. Councillor Jenny Hill narrowly won the mayoralty with 51.58% of the vote after preferences, however Townsville First won a majority on council.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nAt the previous election in 2008, the Labor Party, which had controlled the council for 32 years − the longest-serving Labor administration in Australia − was defeated in a landslide by the conservative Team Tyrell, which won all but one of the councillor positions. Incumbent mayor Tony Mooney was among the ALP members defeated.\nLess than a year after being elected, Team Tyrell councillor Rob McCahill announced his resignation on 9 October 2008, claiming that a \"political witch-hunt\" was threatening to destroy his family. As the council was unsubdivided, the entire LGA had to vote in the by-election on 22 November, which was won by independent candidate Trevor Roberts. Team Tyrell did not contest the election.\nChanges to the council's structure were brought in for the 2012 election, with 10 single-member wards (also known as divisions) introduced.\n\n\n== Candidates ==\nIncumbent mayor Les Tyrell announced on 27 October 2011 that he would retire from politics after 32 years, which included 17 years as Thuringowa mayor.\nCouncillor Dale Last, who was elected on the Team Tyrell ticket in 2008, announced he would run for mayor and lead the Townsville First group, which ran candidates − including six serving Team Tyrell councillors − in all wards. Trevor Roberts also stood for the group.\nLabor did not contest the election. Jenny Hill, the only sitting Labor member on council, also ran for the mayoralty and formed Team Jenny Hill.\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n=== Mayor ===\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Frank S. Jorga (30 December 1968) is a German businessman and investor. He pioneered the online video identification system. He is the founder and managing director of WebID Solutions.\n\n\n== Education and career ==\nAfter initially establishing an IT company with his brother, Jorga transitioned into banking, pursued studies in business administration and law, and completed his Master of Business Administration. Following his second Staatsexamen in law, he joined the German-American Chamber of Commerce and worked as a consultant for various companies in Silicon Valley.\nAfter his return to Germany, Jorga worked on the liquidation of the merger of Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank. As Head of Strategy and Digital at GFKL Financial Services AG, Jorga launched a process that enabled online stores to offer purchase on account, credit, and direct debit. At the beginning of the 2010s, Jorga considered developing an alternative to Deutsche Post's analogue PostIdent procedure, which so far required new customers of banks and brokers to attend in person to verify their identity.\nIn 2012, Jorga founded WebID Solutions. After deliberations with the Federal Ministry of Finance, Jorga obtained approval for the identification via video chat procedure he invented in January 2014. Under his management, WebID Solutions developed additional identification procedures, such as authentication of online identities.\nWith the expansion into Spain in 2023, Jorga became CEO of WebID Spain. In the same year, the city of Wiesbaden introduced online changing of address through video identification based on WebID's software, as a follow-up project to the digital registration for marriage in 2021.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nJorga is originally from Lübeck and lives in Hamburg and Berlin. He has been married since late 2023.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "WebID Solutions is an international financial technology company based in Berlin that offers products and services for legal transactions conducted online. These include, in particular, personal identification and online signatures. According to Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, the company is considered the inventor of online identification.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe company was founded in Berlin in 2012 by Frank S. Jorga. The company developed a method for video identification (VideoIdent), which was approved by Bafin in 2014 after repeated deliberations with the German Federal Ministry of Finance. WebID was the first online-ID provider on the German market, which resulted in Bafin basing their security regulations for video identification on the WebID procedure and standards.\nIn the two years following the approval of the method, the company expanded internationally and founded several subsidiaries in Switzerland, Austria, Spain, the US, and India. WebID Solutions patented their online identification in the United States in 2018 and opened an office in New York City.\nWebID Solutions was in a legal dispute with a competitor for several years. The competitor accused WebID Solutions of patent infringement, which was proven right in the first instance in 2017. In 2020, however, the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court dismissed the action as unjustified.\nIn September 2021 the British investor Anacap took over the majority of WebID Solutions, which was meant to lead towards establishing the company outside of Europe. The establishment in Europe was nevertheless continued, with expansion into Spain in 2022.\n\n\n== Corporate structure ==\nWebID Solutions has offices in Kiel, Solingen, Frankfurt, Berlin, and Hamburg. In Solingen, WebID Solutions maintains a call center. WebID also runs its own security center for online identification procedures, where employees are regularly trained by criminal investigators. The WebID Solutions Group consists of the German parent company WebID Solutions GmbH and subsidiaries in Austria, Switzerland, the US, India and, since 2022, Spain.\n\n\n== Products and services ==\nThe company focuses on products and services for legal transactions conducted via the internet. This includes seven methods of personal identification: via video call (VideoID), via online ID (eID), online banking (AccountID), digital authentication (TrueID) or with the help of AI and biometrics (AutoID), as well as age verification (avsID) and online contracting (SignID). These methods are offered and used in sectors such as banking, financial services, healthcare, telecommunications, e-commerce, mobility, gaming, and entertainment.\nIn Wiesbaden, WebID also introduced digital resident registration and digital registration for marriage, for the first time in Germany, in 2023.\nThe online personal identification procedure was developed as an alternative to the long-established Postident procedure of Deutsche Post. It is the first of its kind. WebID customers include banks such as Deutsche Bank, ING, DKB and Santander, as well as companies such as Trade Republic, Amazon and Apple. In Germany, around 80% of the leading German banks are WebID customers.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Website WebID Solutions",

        "content": "Volpi is an Italian–American salumeria producing cured meats based out of The Hill in St. Louis, Missouri. For over 120 years, the company has been family-owned and operated.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe John Volpi Salami Manufacturing Company was founded in 1902 by John Volpi, an Italian immigrant from Milan. Having learned to cure meat and make sausage in Italy, he started by making cacciatore, a small salami to fit in the pockets of local coal miners.\nJohn Volpi and his wife Maria Pasetti—a midwife who delivered innumerable Italian children—had no children themselves. They wrote back to Italy to find a relative who could help out at the family business and eventually take over. Armando Pasetti came to St. Louis in 1938 at the age of 14. After John Volpi died in 1957, Pasetti grew the business nationally.\nArmando Pasetti met his future wife, Evelina, at his brother's wedding in Italy. Their daughter, Lorenza Pasetti, studied business and became the CEO of Volpi Foods in 2002.\nIn addition to being used at local restaurants like Gioia's Deli, Volpi meats are sold at deli counters at local grocery stores, such as Schnucks. In total, Volpi sells about 130 different products, all dry-cured meats.\nIn 2017, Volpi's shop was remodeled and expanded. Its expansion allowed more of its pre-packaged products to become available in nationwide in grocery stores like Trader Joe's and Publix, as well as convenience stores like Circle K and 7-Eleven. Volpi has also started selling into international markets.\nOver 120 years after its founding, the company still operates at its original location on The Hill in St. Louis. The company is family-owned and has passed to the third and fourth generations of ownership and operation.\nIn 2020, Volpi's Heritage Prosciutto was a Good Food Awards winner.\n\n\n== See also ==\nThe Hill, St. Louis\nSalumeria\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Kwale Island (Kisiwa cha Kwale, in Swahili) is a protected island located in Fumba ward of Mjini District in Mjini Magharibi Region, Tanzania. The island is included in the marine conservation area of Menai Bay (Menai Bay Conservation Area).\n\n\n== Tourism and conservation ==\nLocated on Zanzibar's western coast, Kwale Island is a popular tourist destination that offers snorkeling, dolphin viewing, and sandback activities. Numerous small boats, including tour boats (Safari Blue) and local fishing boats, may be seen along the Fumba beach. The tour boats transport visitors to Kwale Island and around Menai Bay. Plastics are among the many various types of garbage that severely damage the beach. The samples were collected from the main Kwale Island picnic area, the beach outside the settlement, and the island near Fumba Beach. It is thought that the location is somewhat contaminated.\nSince there are no laws governing the harvesting of wild bivalves, anyone can gather bivalves of any size; the residents of Fumba have also identified sine netting near the sand banks of islands like Pungume, Kwale, and Ukombe as a threat to biodiversity, even though this practice is carried out covertly. In spite of the island's status as a marine sanctuary, fishermen have been using sharp iron rods, known as \"umangu\"' to catch Octopuses, which destroys coral reefs.\n\n\n== Coral bleaching of 1999 ==\nWith the exception of the Chume Reef, which is south of Zanzibar town, where coral cover dropped from 51.9% in 1997 to 27.5% in 1999, and Kwale, where coral cover dropped to 29.7% in 1997 and 13.3% in 1999, Unguja reefs did not appear to be seriously impacted by coral bleaching. According to the 1999 coral reef assessment and monitoring, the significant bleaching event had an impact on every reef evaluated. Approximately 80% of the corals on Tutia, Mafia Island, and the reefs on Misali Island near Pemba perished, as a result of severe or catastrophic coral mortality. 30% to 55% of hard corals at Chumbe and Kwale in Zanzibar and Mnazi Bay in Mtwara had intermediate levels of coral mortality.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Presidential elections are scheduled to be held in Guinea-Bissau in November or December 2024. Incumbent president Umaro Sissoco Embaló is eligible for a second term.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 2019, Umaro Sissoco Embaló won the runoff vote against Domingos Simões Pereira, 54% to 46%. Simões Pereira disputed the results. Although neither the supreme court of Guinea-Bissau nor the parliament had given its approval for the official swearing-in ceremony, Sissoco Embaló had organized an alternative swearing-in ceremony in a hotel in Bissau to announce himself as legal president of Guinea-Bissau. Several politicians in Guinea-Bissau, including prime minister Aristides Gomes, accused Sissoco Embaló of arranging a Coup d'état, although outgoing president Vaz stepped down to allow Embaló to take power.\nIncumbent president Embalo dissolved the opposition controlled parliament on 4 December 2023, saying an \"attempted coup\" had prevented him from returning home from COP28 climate conference. This was the second early dissolution by Embalo, with his first dissolution of parliament being in 2022, leading to an opposition victory in the 2023 parliamentary election. In response to the dissolution, parliamentary speaker Domingos Simões Pereira accused the president of carrying out a \"constitutional coup d'etat.\" Incumbent president Embalo would go on to fire the prime minister Geraldo Martins, who was appointed by the PAIGC-led National Assembly and instead appoint Rui Duarte de Barros by presidential decree.\n\n\n== Electoral system ==\nThe President is elected using the two-round system. Article 33 of Guinea-Bissau's Electoral Law prohibits the publishing of any opinion polls.\n\n\n== Issues ==\nVarious opposition parties have criticized incumbent president Embalo, accusing him of authoritarianism and wanting to establish a dictatorship. Beyond the outcome of the elections, the broader narrative in Guinea-Bissau in 2024 will revolve around the imperative of establishing and maintaining momentum for a stable system of governance. Central to this narrative will be the efforts to fortify institutional frameworks that serve as guardrails against the abuse of power.\nAccording to observers, the conditions for elections in 2024 have not been met due to organisational challenges. One major issue is the expiration of the terms of the commission members responsible for overseeing elections. Typically, these members would be appointed by parliament, however since the parliament has been dissolved, there is no entity in place to facilitate the appointment of new commission members.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Snap parliamentary elections are scheduled to be held in Guinea-Bissau in June 2024. Incumbent president Umaro Sissoco Embalo dissolved the opposition controlled parliament on 4 December 2023, saying an \"attempted coup\" had prevented him from returning home from COP28 climate conference.\nThis was the second early dissolution by incumbent president Embalo, with his first dissolution of parliament being in 2022, leading to an opposition victory in the 2023 parliamentary election. In response to the dissolution, parliamentary speaker Domingos Simões Pereira accused the president of carrying out a \"constitutional coup d'etat.\" Incumbent president Embalo would go on to fire the prime minister Geraldo Martins, who was appointed by the PAIGC-led National Assembly and instead appoint Rui Duarte de Barros by presidential decree.\n\n\n== Electoral system ==\nThe 102 members of the National People's Assembly are elected by two methods; 100 by closed list proportional representation from 27 multi-member constituencies and two from single-member constituencies representing expatriate citizens in Africa and Europe.\n\n\n== Issues ==\nVarious opposition parties have criticized incumbent president Embalo, accusing him of authoritarianism and wanting to establish a dictatorship. Beyond the outcome of the elections, the broader narrative in Guinea-Bissau in 2024 will revolve around the imperative of establishing and maintaining momentum for a stable system of governance. Central to this narrative will be the efforts to fortify institutional frameworks that serve as guardrails against the abuse of power.\nAccording to observers, the conditions for new elections have not been met due to organisational challenges. One major issue is the expiration of the terms of the commission members responsible for overseeing elections. Typically, these members would be appointed by parliament, however since the parliament has been dissolved, there is no entity in place to facilitate the appointment of new commission members.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "On 22 January 1988, 20-year-old Bangladeshi national Mohamed Shafiqul Islam, alias Mohd Abdul Islam, was found murdered at a construction site at Bukit Timah, with his genitals being severed off. Within the following month, the police managed to apprehend two Bangladeshi workers, who were responsible for causing Mohamed Shafiqul's death. The two suspects - Mohamed Bachu Miah and Mohamed Mahmuduzzaman Khan - were revealed to have killed Mohamed Shafiqul after the former's younger brother was arrested for illegally working in Singapore due to Mohamed Shafiqul allegedly reporting the matter to the police, which made Mohamed Bachu angered and therefore conspired with Mahmuduzzaman to kill Mohamed Shafiqul. After standing trial for 18 days in March 1991, Mohamed Bachu and Mahmuduzzaman were both found guilty of murdering Mohamed Shafiqul and sentenced to death by the High Court. Both the murderers were hanged on 23 July 1993 after their appeals were rejected by the higher courts and the President of Singapore.\n\n\n== Murder ==\n\nOn 22 January 1988, at a construction site located in Jalan Kampong Chantek off Dunearn Road, Bukit Timah, several workers were clocking in for work at around 8am when they found that the door to a storage container was still locked. Even though the workers repeatedly knocked on the door, there was still no response and therefore, the workers decided to force the door open. After they broke the door open, the workers discovered the dead body of a man inside the container.\nThe deceased, a Bangladeshi construction worker named Mohamed Shafiqul Islam, was found with his head smashed in, his shirt unbuttoned and his blue jeans unzipped, but the most shocking aspect of the discovery was, Mohamed Shafiqul's genitals were also found to have been chopped off and placed beside his corpse. Mohamed Shafiqul, also known by the alias Mohd Abdul Islam, was 20 years old at the time of his death. This was the second murder case within less than one year where a man was found murdered with his genitals severed; in May 1987 at Yishun, a Malaysian sub-contractor named Ang Pai Chiou was also killed and had his genitals cut off by three robbers from Malaysia; two of the perpetrators, Ahmad Shukor and Zainudin Mat Zin, were arrested, convicted and sentenced to death for murder in 1990, while the third suspect \"Rosli\" remains at large till today.\nSources revealed that Mohamed Shafiqul was last seen alive at 7.45pm the night before, after he was given a lift to a nearby hawker centre for dinner. Three Thai workers, who left at 8pm to meet their friends before returning at 1am, hours before the discovery of the corpse, were interviewed and they stated that they never noticed something amiss, and never knew what could have happened. Additionally, Mohamed Shafiqul's employer, 66-year-old Ng Keng Lim of Ong Huat Construction Company, told the press that Mohamed Shafiqul was a good and hardworking worker, and he worked in the site for only eight months.\nDr Clarence Tan, the forensic pathologist, conducted an autopsy on the victim. In his report, Dr Tan found skull fractures on the head, which were caused by multiple blows to the left side of Mohamed Shafiqul's face and head, and these were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, and the victim's neck was similarly broken, and it was also fatal as well. A bloodstained crank handle was also recovered at the scene, and the police believed it was the murder weapon used by the killer(s) responsible for Mohamed Shafiqul's death.\n\n\n== Investigations ==\nHaving classified the case as murder, the police conducted their investigations by interviewing the foreign workers who knew Mohamed Shafiqul. They also found that a wallet and a pair of shoes belonging to the victim was missing from the workplace. With this clue, the police were eventually able to capture a suspect, who was found wearing the same shoes that were stolen from Mohamed Shafiqul.\nOn 2 February 1988, a police spokesperson announced to the public that the investigations led to the arrest of three suspects altogether for the murder of Mohamed Shafiqul, and two of them would be charged in court with murder while the third was still assisting in investigations at that point. It was pieced together through the facts uncovered that the killing was done out of a possible motive of revenge, as there was an illegal immigrant from Bangladesh being repatriated after being arrested by the immigration authorities, and one of the perpetrators was the older brother of the immigrant, and the victim was suspected to have reported the immigrant to the police. On that same day, the two suspects, Mohamed Bachu Miah and Mohamed Mahmuduzzaman Khan, were charged with murder, and both men were ordered to be remanded for further investigations and to await trial. Both the two men were illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and had worked here prior to the murder.\nBy June 1988, the murder of Mohamed Shafiqul Islam was one of the 15 murder cases to occur during the first half of the year. In January 1989, the murder of Mohamed Shafiqul was cited as the only murder case where police were able to solve without any physical evidence, and the case was among the 81% of murder cases cracked by the police during the year of 1988.\nIn July 1988, after a preliminary hearing, a district court ordered that both Mohamed Bachu and Mahmuduzzaman should stand trial for murdering Mohamed Shafiqul on a later date to be decided.\n\n\n== Murder trial and sentencing ==\n\nOn 4 March 1991, three years after their arrest, both Mohamed Bachu Miah and Mohamed Mahmuduzzaman Khan were brought to trial for the murder of Mohamed Shafiqul Islam back in 1988. Standing trial at the High Court before two trial judges (Judicial Commissioner M P H Rubin and Justice T. S. Sinnathuray), Mahmuduzzaman and Mohamed Bachu, who were both represented by counsel in court, were prosecuted by Deputy Public Prosecutor Yang Ing Loong.\nThe trial court was told that, based on the men's confessions, both Mohamed Bachu and Mahmuduzzaman had conspired with one another to murder Mohamed Shafiqul. Reason being, at least one month before the murder itself, Mohamed Bachu's younger brother was arrested alongside many other people for working illegally in Singapore, and it was also apparent that Mohamed Shafiqul, himself also an illegal worker, acted as an informant to the immigration authorities to assist them in arresting the illegal foreign workers. Due to this, Mohamed Bachu harboured a great sense of hatred towards Mohamed Shafiqul for having snitched on his younger brother and other fellow Bangladeshi nationals, and thus in December 1987, a month before the murder, Mohamed Bachu and Mahmuduzzaman collaborated with one another to murder Mohamed Shafiqul. Mohamed Bachu even proposed to three other compatriots at one point to help him kill Mohamed Shafiqul, and the payment would be S$1,000 for the job. One of the two defendants even told his two colleagues that he wanted to kill Mohamed Shafiqul.\nOn the eve of the murder, Mohamed Bachu and Mahmuduzzaman took a taxi to look for Mohamed Shafiqul after they met up at Bukit Timah, and they met Mohamed Shafiqul at his workplace in Jalan Kampong Chantek off Dunearn Road. Mohamed Shafiqul, Mahmuduzzaman and Mohamed Bachu went out together to Jalan Kayu to collect money from some Thai workers, and along the way back, the trio consumed several bottles of stout and beer, and went to Circuit Road to look for a prostitute. The trio subsequently engaged the services of a 56-year-old woman, who had sex with all the three men, and according to the prostitute, she testified that the three men appeared to be friendly with one another and Mohamed Shafiqul had paid her S$25. Thereafter, the trio returned to Mohamed Shafiqul's workplace, where Mahmuduzzaman first attacked the victim by sitting on his chest and strangling him, but Mohamed Shafiqul put up a fierce resistance and bit Mahmuduzzaman's fingers. In order to help Mahmuduzzaman, Mohamed Bachu wielded a crank handle and battered Mohamed Shafiqul on the head several times, resulting in the victim's death. Additionally, to make sure that Mohamed Shafiqul had indeed died, both Mohamed Bachu and Mahmuduzzaman tried using their hands to remove his genitals, but they were unable to, and so Mohamed Bachu used the pliers to dismember the genitals from Mohamed Shafiqul's corpse instead. The above were hence the details of the prosecution's case based on the statements of the pair.\nHowever, both Mahmuduzzaman and Mohamed Bachu denied that their statements were made accurately or voluntarily to Inspector Yeoh Bak Sek, and a trial within a trial was therefore conducted to verify the voluntariness of the statements. After the hearing, the trial judges ruled that the confessions were made voluntarily and they were admissible as evidence. In spite of this setback, the two men elected to put up their defence and stated that after they went out together for drinks and pimping, the two accused and the victim got into a drunken brawl and it unexpectedly caused the death of Mohamed Shafiqul, and there was no premeditation or conspiracy to actually kill Mohamed Shafiqul, and the defence counsel representing both men argued that their cilents should be convicted of a lesser offence of manslaughter, which was not punishable by death but warranted life imprisonment as the maximum penalty.\nIn rebuttal, the prosecution argued that based on the autopsy report of Dr Clarence Tan, the brutality of the attack had caused Mohamed Shafiqul's death by both a broken neck and skull, and there was clearly severe force inflicted during the assault, and the evidence showed that the murder was done in cold blood and out of vengeance, given that Mohamed Bachu and Mahmuduzzaman were angered at Mohamed Shafiqul for his role as an informant that caused many of their compatriots, especially Mohamed Bachu's brother, to be deported from Singapore for illegal immigration. And therefore, the prosecution sought a guilty verdict of murder for both men.\nOn 27 March 1991, after a trial lasting 18 days, Justice T. S. Sinnathuray and Judicial Commissioner M P H Rubin delivered their verdict. In the judgement, the two trial judges found that the prosecution had proven the murder charge against both accused beyond a reasonable doubt, and they accepted that the two men had indeed conspired to cause the death of Mohamed Shafiqul due to the victim's direct responsibility behind the arrest of Mohamed Bachu's brother and his role as an informant, and also rejected the defence's accounts of the murder. Therefore, 32-year-old Mohamed Bachu Miah and 26-year-old Mohamed Mahmuduzzaman Khan were both found guilty of murder, and sentenced to death by hanging. At the time of 1993, Singaporean law mandated the death penalty for murder, and judges in Singapore had no discretion to opt for any other punishments aside from death.\n\n\n== Appeals ==\nOn 11 September 1992, the Court of Appeal's three judges - Chief Justice Yong Pung How, and two Judges of Appeal L P Thean (Thean Lip Ping) and Chao Hick Tin - rejected the appeals of Mohamed Mahmuduzzaman Khan and Mohamed Bachu Miah. Both the appellants earlier argued that there was no intention or conspiracy to commit murder, and per Mohamed Bachu's case, he was drunk and therefore fought with each other, and thus caused Mohamed Shafiqul to die, while Mahmuduzzaman claimed he only tried to break up the fight between Mohamed Bachu and Mohamed Shafiqul. Also, the defence counsels of the duo again argued that the confessions were inadmissible on the grounds that the translator did not do a good job and it was not legally obtained. The three judges however, found that there was no error made in recording the police statements and it was legally done, and that the pair were able to converse smoothly in English. Plus, the three judges pointed out that based on the statements, it was clear that there was a motive and conspiracy between both appellants to kill Mohamed Shafiqul. The Court of Appeal therefore dismissed the appeals of Mohamed Bachu and Mahmuduzzaman, and in turn confirmed the death penalty for both the appellants, who remained on death row at Changi Prison awaiting their executions.\nMeanwhile, human rights group Amnesty International caught attention of the case, and in March 1993, the group made a plea to the Singapore government to commute the death sentences of Mohamed Bachu and Mahmuduzzaman to life imprisonment.\nAs a final recourse to escape the gallows, Mahmuduzzaman made a final death row plea for presidential clemency, and if successful, Mahmuduzzaman's death sentence would be commuted to life imprisonment. Inside the plea, Mahmuduzzaman included a letter from Mohamed Bachu, who affirmed that he was solely responsible for the murder and not Mahmuduzzaman. The petition was, in the end, rejected by then President Wee Kim Wee and Mahmuduzzaman's death sentence was therefore finalized. It was unknown if Mohamed Bachu had appealed for clemency like Mahmuduzzaman did.\n\n\n== Executions of the duo ==\nMohamed Bachu Miah and Mohamed Mahmuduzzaman Khan were both hanged in Changi Prison on 23 July 1993. Four days later, Amnesty International confirmed that the double executions were carried out as scheduled in the duo's death warrants.\nIn a 1994 report, Amnesty International revealed that there were minimally 26 death sentences - three for murder and 23 for drug trafficking - imposed by the courts and at least five, including Mahmuduzzaman and Mohamed Bachu, were put to death in Singapore, and critical of the use of both caning and capital punishment and the restriction orders of former prisoners of conscience like Chia Thye Poh and Vincent Cheng Kim Chuan, Amnesty International urged the Singapore government to abolish both caning and the death penalty, and commute all the remaining death sentences to life imprisonment, as well as lifting the restriction orders imposed on the former prisoners of conscience. Both Chia and Cheng were detained indefinitely for suspected communist activities in 1966 and 1987 respectively under the Internal Security Act, and the restrictions on both men were eventually lifted by the end of November 1998.\nOfficial prison statistics in Singapore revealed a total of seven people were executed in Singapore during the year 1993. Out of these seven convicts, five people, including Mohamed Bachu, Mahmuduzzaman and a cleaner named Maksa bin Tohaiee, were hanged for murder; Maksa was hanged on 26 November 1993 for robbing and murdering an Italian housewife back in October 1990, while the remaining two, identified as Hongkongers Raymond Ko Mun Cheung and Chiu Sum Hing, were hanged for drug trafficking.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCapital punishment in Singapore\n\n\n== References ==",

The island is part of the Menai Bay Marine Conservation Area.\nDespite being a marine sanctuary, the island's reefs have been threatened by fishermen using sharp iron rods, known as umangu, to catch octopuses, which destroys coral reefs. Since there are no laws governing the harvesting of wild bivalves, anyone can gather bivalves of any size. The inhabitants of Fumba have also identified sine netting near the sand banks of islands like Pungume, Kwale, and Ukombe as a threat to biodiversity, even though this practice is carried out secretly.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Double Mountain is a 5,899 ft (1,800 m) summit in Alaska, United States.\n\n\n== Description ==\nDouble Mountain is located in the Alaska Range in Denali National Park and Preserve. It is situated nine miles (14 km) northwest of Fang Mountain on the divide separating the Sanctuary and Teklanika rivers. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains west into the Teklanika River and east into the Sanctuary River, which are both part of the Tanana River drainage basin. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises 3,050 feet (930 meters) above the Teklanika River in 1.75 miles (2.8 km). This mountain's local descriptive name was shown on a 1916 USGS document, and the toponym has been officially adopted by the United States Board on Geographic Names.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nBased on the Köppen climate classification, Double Mountain is located in a tundra climate zone with long, cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Winter temperatures can drop below −20 °F with wind chill factors below −30 °F. The months May through June offer the most favorable weather for climbing or viewing.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of mountain peaks of Alaska\nGeology of Alaska\nIgloo Mountain\n\n\n== Gallery ==",

        "content": "A nationwide referendum is scheduled to be held in Moldova on 20 October 2024 on whether the country should amend the Constitution of Moldova to include the Moldovan citizens' wish for European Union membership, in order to prevent future governments from derailing the country from its pro-European trajectory.Incumbent president Maia Sandu is campaigning for the \"yes\" side in the referendum.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nIn March 2022, following Russia's invasion of neighboring Ukraine, Moldova submitted an application for EU membership. Subsequently, in June of the same year, Moldova was granted the status of a candidate country by the European Council. In December 2023, the European Council announced its decision to open accession negotiations with Moldova. Moldova set a target date of 2030 for EU accession.President Sandu had announced in 2023 her intention to seek re-election.  Additionally, Sandu announced the launch of an online platform aimed at promoting the referendum and advocating for the benefits of EU membership to the country. Observers noted Sandu is gearing up to focus her efforts on EU integration, an area where she and her party PAS have experienced consistent success in order to be re-elected.The Parliament of Moldova will determine the date for the referendum, although Sandu expressed her hope that it will coincide with the presidential elections scheduled for the autumn. Sandu said; \"It is important to hold a referendum now because it is a historic occasion, awaited for three decades. The European Union member states are more open than ever, we have the necessary political will for this step, and our citizens want to be part of the EU.\"On 21 March 2024, the Parliament endorsed a resolution of 54-to-0 to continue the efforts to join the European Union. The declaration asserted, \"Only joining Europe can ensure the future of the country as a sovereign, neutral, and fully democratic state\". During the vote, all opposition parties in parliament walked out.\n\n\n=== Gagauzia ===\nOn 2 February 2014, the Autonomous Territorial Unit of Gagauzia held two referendums on European integration.  In one, 98.4% voted in favour of joining the Customs Union of Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Russia, while in the second 97.2% opposed further integration with the EU. 98.9% also supported the proposition that Gagauzia could declare independence if Moldova unified with Romania. There is concern in Gagauzia that Moldova's integration with the EU could lead to such a unification with EU member Romania, which is unpopular in the autonomous region.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "MV Dali is a Neopanamax container ship built in 2015 by Hyundai Heavy Industries, South Korea. On 26 March 2024, by then operated by Synergy Marine of Singapore, she collided with the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, Maryland, United States, causing a catastrophic structural failure of the bridge.\n\n\n== Description ==\nDali is a Neopanamax container ship with a length overall of 299.92 metres (984 ft), beam of 48.2 metres (158 ft 2 in), moulded depth of 24.8 metres (81 ft 4 in), and summer draft of 15.03 metres (49 ft 4 in).  Her gross and net tonnages are 91,128 and 52,150, respectively, and her deadweight tonnage is 116,851 tonnes. Her container capacity is 9,971 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU).\nDali is propelled by a single low-speed two-stroke crosshead diesel engine coupled to a fixed-pitch propeller. Her main engine, a 9-cylinder MAN-B&W 9S90ME-C9.2 unit manufactured by Hyundai Heavy Industries under license, is rated 41,480 kW (55,630 hp) at 82.5 rpm. Her service speed is 22 knots (41 km/h; 25 mph). For maneuvering, Dali has a single 3,000 kW (4,000 hp) bow thruster. Electricity is generated onboard by two 3,840 kW (5,150 hp) and two 4,400 kW (5,900 hp) auxiliary diesel generators.\n\n\n== Construction ==\nOn 14 May 2013, Hyundai Heavy Industries was contracted to build two container ships based on the \"Hyundai 9000 wide beam\" design that was modified by relocating the wheelhouse from three-quarters aft to a more forward position to increase the container capacity from 9,034 to 9,962 TEU. A further two similar ships were ordered for CMA CGM and four for Maersk later in 2013.\nThe construction began in Ulsan, South Korea, in July 2014 and the hull with the yard number 2678 was laid down on 10 October 2014 and launched on 27 December of the same year. On 5 January 2015, Dali and her sister ship Cezanne were named for painters Salvador Dalí and Paul Cézanne.\n\n\n== Service ==\nDali was delivered to Stellar Marine LLC, a subsidiary of the Greek shipowner Oceanbulk Maritime SA, on 5 March 2015 and registered in Majuro, Marshall Islands. In October 2016, she was sold to Grace Ocean Pte. Ltd. and placed under the management of Synergy Marine Pte. Ltd., both based in Singapore where the ship was also reflagged. The ship has been chartered to the Danish shipping and logistics company Maersk since it was delivered in 2015.\nWhile in the port of San Antonio, Chile, in June 2023, port state control inspection revealed a single deficiency related to \"gauges, thermometers etc.\" in the ship's machinery, subsequently clarified as a monitor gauge for fuel pressure which was rectified prior to departure. The ship was not detained, and at the follow-up inspection in the United States, three months later, no problems were identified.\n\n\n== Incidents ==\n\n\n=== Port of Antwerp 2016 ===\nOn 11 July 2016, Dali collided with the berth at the container terminal in the Port of Antwerp, Belgium, causing significant damage to her stern and transom. The berth was also damaged and closed for cargo handling operations. No injuries or water pollution were reported.\n\n\n=== Francis Scott Key Bridge 2024 ===\n\nOn 26 March 2024, Dali departed the Port of Baltimore in the United States, bound for Colombo, Sri Lanka, while under charter to Maersk, with a crew of 22 and two pilots. Shortly after leaving the port, the ship lost power, but was able to broadcast a mayday call. Soon afterwards, she collided with a support pillar of the Francis Scott Key Bridge, causing the major part of the bridge to collapse, with one span falling onto the ship's forecastle. None of the 24 on board were seriously injured. All moving traffic had left the bridge, but six construction workers died. The National Transportation Safety Board is conducting the investigation of the data recorder and interviewing the crew. There are 56 containers on board with 764 tons of hazardous materials, among the total load of nearly 4,700 shipping containers.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLake Illawarra, the bulk carrier that collided with the Tasman Bridge in 1975\nMarine Floridian, the tanker that collided with the Benjamin Harrison Bridge in 1977\nSummit Venture, the bulk carrier that collided with the Sunshine Skyway Bridge in 1980\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to IMO 9697428 at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "Marina Arruti (born 23 May 1972) is a Spanish professional golfer. She played on the Ladies European Tour 1995–2011, and won the Ladies Austrian Open in 1999.\n\n\n== Early life and family ==\nArruti was born in San Sebastián in 1972, where her father José Arruti Lizaso and his twin brother Jesús were club pros at Real Golf Club de San Sebastián. Her older sister Amaia is also a preofessional golfer who played on the Ladies European Tour, and her uncle's son Jesús María Arruti has played on the European Tour.\n\n\n== Amateur career ==\nIn 1993, Arruti won the Portuguese International Ladies Amateur Championship. She represented Spain at the 1993 European Ladies' Team Championship and 1994 Espirito Santo Trophy.\nArruti won gold at the 1993 Mediterranean Games in Languedoc-Roussillon, France in the team event together with Estefania Knuth and Laura Navarro, and a bronze individually.\n\n\n== Professional career ==\nArruti turned professional in January 1995 and joined the Ladies European Tour, where she finished 13th on the Order of Merit in her rookie season.\nIn 1999, she won the Ladies Austrian Open after birdieing the final three holes, and was runner-up at the Ladies Italian Open, a stroke behind Samantha Head. In 2001, she lost a playoff at the Biarritz Ladies Classic to Rachel Kirkwood.\nArruti's best result at a major came in the 2001 Women's British Open at Sunningdale Golf Club, where she tied for 7th.\nLater in her career, Arruti also played on Spain's domestic Banesto Golf Tour, where she won the event at Sant Cugat near Barcelona back to back in 2010 and 2011, and topped the Order of Merit in 2010. The 2011 event was co-sanctioned by the Women's European Satellite Tour (WEST), an attempt by the Spanish and Swedish golf federations to establish an LET feeder tour, which was folded into the LET Access Series in 2012.\n\n\n== Amateur wins ==\n1993 Portuguese International Ladies Amateur Championship\n1994 British U-23 Amateur Championship\nSource:\n\n\n== Professional wins (3) ==\n\n\n=== Ladies European Tour (1) ===\n\n\n=== Women's European Satellite Tour (1) ===\n\n1Co-sanctioned by the Banesto Golf Tour\n\n\n=== Banesto Golf Tour wins (2) ===\n2010 Banesto Golf Tour Sant Cugat\n2011 Banesto Golf Tour Sant Cugat1\n1Co-sanctioned by the Women's European Satellite Tour\n\n\n== Team appearances ==\nAmateur\n\nEuropean Ladies' Team Championship (representing Spain): 1993\nEspirito Santo Trophy (representing Spain): 1994\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMarina Arruti at the Golfdata official site (in Swedish)",

He followed it with a series of similar travel books.The Bulletin said \"It supplies a pitilessly realistic picture of a human pest; one who is restless, inquisitive, in love with life, interested in everything, the bane of all in authority; a dry humorist, as senselessly malignant as a child, as quick-thinking as a good criminal defender, as combative and courageous as a bull-ant.\"Clune later had a show on ABC radio in 1939 called Try Anything Once.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Agneta Wrede's vestibule is a room in the upper floor of Åkeshov Palacee in Bromma, outside Stockholm, Sweden. The room is named after Baroness Agneta Wrede af Elimä (1718–1800), and who lived in the palace during 1747–1800.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1720, Åkeshov palace was bought by the at the time Chancellor of Justice, Baron Gabriel Stierncrona, who converted it with subordinate farms in Spånga and Järfälla parishes. The next owner was the then only eight-year-old son David.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe decoration of the suite that was to be used by the wife became more peaceful and idyllically rural. In the room known as Agneta Wrede's vestibule, an entire interior remains authentic. The wall fields are painted in flowing rich Rococo style.\nThe paintings in Agneta Wrede's vestibule were stored at the beginning of the 20th century, but were found after many years in St. Erik's hospital, rolled up in the attic. With the help of the Stockholm City Museum it was possible to restore the wallpaper in the vestibule. During the restoration, Agneta Wrede's vestibule were restored and the paintings in the upper hall skillfully copied by the artist John Broberg and Brita Juel-Soop.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

He reigned between 1856 and 1864.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nIn 1855, the 7th ruler of Khiva, Muhammad Amin Bahadur Khan, tragically died in a battle against the Turkmen Teke tribe near Serakhs. After his death, power in Khiva passed to his son Abdullah Khan (1855), who, however, also died in the battle against nomadic tribes six months later. Then his brother Kutlugh Murad Khan (1737–1856) ascended the throne but was soon assassinated.\nIn 1856, their great-uncle Sayyid Muhammad Khan, the son of the 4th ruler of Khiva Mohammed Rahim Khan, came to power in the Khiva Khanate, and he was able to restore order in the state and prevent further attacks by the Turkmen nomadic tribes.\nDuring his reign, diplomatic relations were maintained with Russia, the Ottoman Empire, Iran, and Afghanistan. In 1858, the Russian envoy Nikolay Pavlovich Ignatyev visited Khiva.\nIn 1863, Said Muhammad Khan also received the famous Hungarian traveler Ármin Vámbéry.\nDuring the reign of Sayyid Muhammad Khan, an official reception hall (Kurinishkhana), was built in Khiva. During these years, the historian Agahi wrote the history of Khorezm. Among the famous people under his reign was the composer, calligrapher and painter Kamil Khorezmi (1825–1899).\nAfter his death in 1864, his son Muhammad Rahim Khan II, who had received a careful education, succeeded him.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nGulomov Kh.

The song reached number 1 on the Russian Airplay Charts and appears on Walker's fourth studio album, Walkerworld.\n\n\n== Background ==\nWalker says of the song: \"Over the past few weeks I have felt so much joy, unity, and compassion from our small community. Since I published 'Walkerworld' you have showered me with kind words and wonderful theories about what is to come. Thus, I am glad to surprise you in return. The single \"Heart Over Mind\" features vocalist Daya and also includes a brand new music video that takes us back to the story of World of Walker.\"\n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe music video for the song was directed by Mads Neset and has over 10 million views on YouTube.\nDirector Neset said of the music video, \"Alan is very aware of this worldview and has to follow many characters, timelines, and various established themes, which is most enjoyable. It's like stepping into a very established IP and staying true to it. I tried to bring the video to life within the world that Alan created, but at the same time to have an underlying theme that I think we can all relate to a little bit in our daily lives,\" he said.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n=== Weekly charts ===\n\n\n=== Monthly charts ===\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Jay Johnson (born December 30, 1948) is an American business executive and former model. In 1967, Johnson arrived in New York from California with his twin brother Jed Johnson and they were soon absorbed into artist Andy Warhol's social circle. Johnson pursued modeling and supported projects at The Factory. He became President of Jed Johnson Associated Inc. following his brother's death in 1996, he created Jed Johnson Home in 2006.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nJay Johnson was born in Alexandria, Minnesota on December 30, 1948. He was the third of six children, born 15 minutes before his fraternal twin brother Jed Johnson. His family moved to Scottsdale, Arizona when he was 10 years old before settling in Fair Oaks, California. His father was a physician and an amateur pilot with his own airport. Johnson dated future Playboy model Barbi Benton in high school. He graduated from Bella Vista High School in 1967. \nIn 1967, Johnson and his brother Jed dropped out of college and hitchhiked with an AWOL soldier from Sacramento, California to New York City. They found an apartment in the East Village, Manhattan through a heroin addict, got robbed, and lost all their money. When they went to collect money their mother had sent them through Western Union, they were offered a job as messengers. In 1968, Jed delivered a telegram to artist Andy Warhol's Factory and was offered a job on the spot as a custodian by director Paul Morrisey. Morrissey had promised them parts in the film Lonesome Cowboys (1968), but those plans fell through.\nWarhol helped the brothers move into an apartment in a safer neighborhood and they were quickly assimilated into his entourage. Jed would become Warhol's live-in boyfriend for 12 years, edited films produced by Warhol and Morrissey, and eventually directed a film. Johnson became a Warhol superstar and pursued professional modeling while assisting with projects at the Factory. Johnson posed for renowned photographers such as Cecil Beaton, Richard Avedon, Jack Mitchell, and Francesco Scavullo. He also modeled jewelry made by Robert Mapplethorpe in 1970.\nJohnson said that when he and Jed first lived in New York City they \"had not yet recognized that they were gay.\" The Factory photographer Billy Name helped them come to terms with their sexuality. Soon after arriving in New York City, he dated Jane Forth, whom he introduced to Warhol and she became a Warhol superstar.\nIn the early 1970s, Johnson became the muse and assistant of fashion designer Giorgio di Sant'Angelo. Johnson was feistier than his soft-spoken twin and considered the \"bad boy\" of the duo. He struggled with drinking and drug addiction. By 1977, Johnson's brother Jed had begun a decorating business. After Johnson went to rehab he worked as a bookkeeper for his brother's company.\nIn 1996, Johnson's brother Jed was killed as a passenger aboard TWA Flight 800 when the plane exploded off the coast of Long Island, New York. Johnson took Jed's decorating business Jed Johnson & Associates. In 1997, Johnson nominated Jed's protégé Arthur Dunnam as design director. The company's name was changed to Jed Johnson Associates and later to Arthur Dunnam for Jed Johnson Studio.\nIn 2006, Johnson created Jed Johnson Home and continues to produce fabrics and furniture for the collection. His longtime partner Tom Cashin is the co-director. They reside in New York City and Brookhaven Hamlet, New York.\nIn 2022, Johnson appeared in the Netflix docuseries The Andy Warhol Diaries.\n\n\n== References ==",

He is mostly known for having been a long-time general secretary of the Communist Party of Argentina.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nÁlvarez was born in to a family of poor doc workers and from 1913, he worked first as a farm laborer on a plantation, then at a refrigeration plant, and as a loader in the port. In 1925 he joined the Argentine Communist Party and was a member of its trade union. In 1927, he led the leadership of strikes protesting the execution in the United States of Sacco and Vanzetti.\nUntil 1930, he held low positions in the party in the port city of Avellaneda but began to climb the ranks within the party soon after. In 1933, he became a member of the party's Central Committee, leaving physical labor and switching entirely to party work. From 1930 to 1932, during the dictatorship of General Uriburu (and then during the Second World War), he was underground engaging in the organization of trade unions. At the end of 1933, he was sent by the party to Moscow, where he studied at the International Lenin School and, according to some sources, participated in the construction of the Moscow Metro. He returned to his homeland in 1935.\nFrom 1935 to 1937, he headed the party organization in Buenos Aires; in June 1938, he joined the executive committee of the Communist Party and soon became its general secretary after being endorsed by Victorio Codovilla who was in Paris. For his activities, he was arrested by the authorities in 1930, 1931, and in February 1943. He remained Secretary General until the end of his life and was re-elected for the last time in 1973. Published a number of works on the history of the labor movement in Argentina.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The chancellor of the University of Nebraska Omaha is the chief administrator of the University of Nebraska Omaha and is selected by the University of Nebraska system president and approved by the Board of Regents. The position has been held by Joanne Li since July 2021.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== University of Omaha (1909–1930) ===\nThe University of Nebraska Omaha, originally called the University of Omaha, was founded as a private, nonsectarian, religious institution in September 1908; however, the University of Omaha did not choose a president until a year later when classes began in September 1909. The Rev. Daniel Edwards Jenkins was appointed acting president in September 1909 and was made full president in 1910. At the time he was appointed, Jenkins served as professor of systematic theology and apologetics on the faculty of Omaha Presbyterian Theological Seminary. Jenkins served 17 years as the president of the University of Omaha before ill health due to overwork brought about his departure in December 1926. He was expected to return as president, but he never did and instead died in November 1927. W. Gilbert James, dean of the University of Omaha, served as interim president in Jenkins' absence until a successor could be found.\nIn July 1927, Jenkins was made president emeritus of the university when the board announced that it had hired 34-year-old Rev. Karl Frederick Wettstone, the president of the University of Dubuque, to succeed him. However, Wettstone's short tenure was tumultuous, with students hanging him in effigy and demanding his resignation after he refused to ratify a student-body election. Consequently, Wettstone resigned after only one year, citing his inability to raise funds and to obtain accreditation for the university. The university then hired E. Wesley Emery, then president of York College, to succeed Wettstone. Emery's tenure was also short since, as the university sought accreditation, the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools required that heads of universities it accredited have a Doctor of Philosophy degree, and Emery only had a Doctor of Divinity degree. Thus, after only two years of service, Emery departed, and W. Gilbert James was once again appointed acting president of the university.\n\n\n=== Municipal University of Omaha (1930–1968) ===\nIn 1930, the city of Omaha took control of the University of Omaha, turning it into a public municipal institution rather than a private, religious university. In 1931, after an eight-month search, the Board of Regents named William E. Sealock, then dean of the teachers' college at the University of Nebraska, president of the newly created Municipal University of Omaha. Sealock was hired with the agreement that the university would move to a new location. Sealock soon ran into disagreements with the Board of Regents, leading to his removal as president four years later in June 1935. However, two regents resigned in protest, some faculty threatened to quit, and a large group consisting of students, faculty, and community members, displeased with the board's decision, rallied to ask them to reconsider and reinstate Sealock. Several days later, after being informed that the Board of Regents was unlikely to change its mind, Sealock committed suicide by ingesting poison on July 7, 1935. Close friend of the Sealock family John G. Neihardt traveled back from Missouri to attend his funeral. After Sealock's ouster, the Board of Regents failed to name an interim president and was threatened with an investigation by the American Association of University Professors. As the highest ranking officer of the university, Edgar A. Holt, dean of the college of arts and sciences, was the de facto interim president, although the Board of Regents refused to officially appoint him due to his ardent support of Sealock after his removal. Homer W. Anderson was rumored as a possible candidate for acting president, but he declined, offering instead to act only in an advisory role.\nOn August 15, 1935, the Board of Regents unanimously named Rowland Haynes, former Nebraska administrator for the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, president. After serving as president for 13 years, Haynes retired due to a state law for which he had advocated that required heads of universities to retire at age 70. Haynes was named president emeritus, and the Board of Regents then appointed Milo Bail, dean of the college of education at Butler University, to succeed him. Bail would go on to become widely recognized as one of the university's most influential presidents, serving for 17 years. To succeed Bail, the Board of Regents appointed Leland E. Traywick, the formerly ousted president of Southwest Missouri State University, on February 1, 1965. However, Traywick lasted only two years before he resigned to pursue other scholarly activities. The board then appointed Kirk E. Naylor, the dean of administration at the university, to become acting president. He was later named president on June 5, 1967.\n\n\n=== University of Nebraska at Omaha (1968–present) ===\nIn 1968, the Municipal University of Omaha was merged into the University of Nebraska system, creating the new University of Nebraska at Omaha (UNO). Three years later, after disagreements with the Board of Regents and University of Nebraska President D. B. Varner, Kirk Naylor was fired by the Board of Regents. It was at this time that the Board of Regents also changed the title of the post from \"president\" to \"chancellor,\" and thus John V. Blackwell was appointed the acting chancellor until a replacement for Naylor could be found. Ronald Roskens, the executive vice president at Kent State University, was hired as the next chancellor of UNO in July 1972. Roskens later resigned his position as chancellor in 1977 to become D. B. Varner's replacement as President of the University of Nebraska. Roskens then hired Del Weber, a native Nebraskan who was serving as the dean of the college of education at Arizona State University, as his replacement as UNO chancellor. Weber went on to become the longest-serving chancellor at UNO, serving in the position for 20 years before retiring. In 1986, Weber initially accepted the top administrative position at the University of Nevada, only to turn it down the next day to remain at UNO after the faculty senate asked him to stay. Upon his retirement, a UNO campus building was named after him: the Del and Lou Ann Weber Fine Arts Building.   \nIn 1997, Nancy Belck was appointed as UNO's chancellor. The first woman to serve in this position, she was previously the chancellor at Southern Illinois University. Nine years later, Belck resigned after controversy over how the budget of the athletic department was handled as well as allegations that she falsified an expense report. In the wake of Belck's resignation, vice chancellor for academic and student services John E. Christensen was appointed interim chancellor and was later made full chancellor. He was the first chancellor to have also been an alumnus of UNO. After Christensen's retirement, Jeffrey P. Gold, chancellor of the University of Nebraska Medical Center, was appointed interim chancellor of UNO and was later made full chancellor as well. After Gold stepped down to become the executive vice president and provost of the University of Nebraska system, Joanne Li, the first Asian-American to hold the position, was appointed UNO's 16th chancellor.\n\n\n== List of chancellors of the University of Nebraska Omaha ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Siege of Mayyāfāriqīn in 1259–1260 was a Mongol siege against the last Ayyubid ruler Al-Kamil Muhammad in his city of Mayyāfāriqīn (modern Silvan, Diyarbakır). The Siege of Mayyāfāriqīn closely followed the 1258 Siege of Baghdad and marked the beginning of the Mongol campaigns in Syria.\nIn spring 1259, the Armenian Prince Prosh Khaghbakian, together with his Armenian Zakarid suzerain Shahnshah, led a large force of Georgians and Armenians to support a much smaller force of Mongol troops of Hulegu in the Siege of Mayyāfāriqīn (Diyarbakır), which was defended by its last Ayyubid ruler Al-Kamil Muhammad. Military units of Cilician Armenia also participated, and would soon after participate to the Mongol Siege of Damascus (1260) as well. The son and successor of the Turkic Zengid ruler  Badr al-Din Lu'lu', named Isma'il ibn Lu'lu' (1259–1262), continued in his father's steps and also supported the Mongol troops of Hulagu in the Siege of Mayyāfāriqīn with troops and siege engineers.\nThe horrors of the long siege were recounted by the contemporary Armenian historian Kirakos:\n\nThey ate clean and unclean animals and then started to eat people when there was no more food. The strong ate the weak. When the [supply of] poor people was exhausted they turned against one another. Fathers ate sons, and women ate their daughters; and they did not spare the fruit of their wombs. Lovers renounced their loved ones and friends, their acquaintances. And the food supply had so diminished that one litr of human flesh sold for seventy dahekans. Men and food were entirely exhausted, and not just there [in the city], but danger threatened many other districts for those who were besieging the city harassed the land already subjugated by the Tatars with tax collecting and with conveying food and drink for them. Many people died from the extreme cold of the snow which covered the mountains in wintertime.\nWhen the city was captured at last after a siege of two years, the Muslims were massacred, but the Christians were spared. Christian relics were collected and brought back to Armenia, particularly to the Haghpat Monastery.\nThe Armenian Prince Sevata of Kachen was killed in the conflict. According to the Armenian writer Vartan, he \"won the immortal crown, ever faithful to God and to the il-khan; he will share the triumph of those who shared their blood for Christ\".\nFinally the Ayyubid ruler Al-Kamil Muhammad was killed when Mayyafariqin fell to the Mongols on 7 April 1260 (23 Rabia II 658).\nMeanwhile Hulegu continued his conquest of the rest of Syria, accompanied by the forces of Hethum I of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia and the Crusaders of Bohemond VI of Antioch. The Georgian ruler David VII declined to commit more Georgian-Armenian troops for these Mongol campaigns in Syria, on account that he had suffered huge losses in the 1258 Siege of Baghdad. Of the remaining Ayyubid states in Syria, Aleppo fell in the Siege of Aleppo (1260), while Homs, Hama and Damascus submitted peacefully.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "On March 26, 2024, at 1:28 a.m. EDT (05:28 UTC), the main spans and the three nearest northeast approach spans of the Francis Scott Key Bridge across the Patapsco River in the Baltimore metropolitan area of Maryland, United States, collapsed after the container ship Dali struck one of its piers. Four members of a maintenance crew working on the roadway were killed and another two are presumed dead, while two more were rescued from the river.\nThe collapse blocked most shipping to and from the Port of Baltimore. Maryland Governor Wes Moore called the event a \"global crisis\" that had affected more than 8,000 jobs. The economic impact of the waterway's closure has been estimated at $15 million per day.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe Francis Scott Key Bridge was a steel arch-shaped continuous truss bridge, the second-longest in the United States and third-longest in the world. Opened in 1977, the 1.6-mile  (2.6 km; 1.4 nmi) bridge ran northeast from Hawkins Point, Baltimore, to Sollers Point in Dundalk in Baltimore County, Maryland. Before being damaged, it carried Interstate 695, a beltway around Baltimore; its four lanes (two in each direction) were used by some 34,000 vehicles each day, including 3,000 trucks, many of which hauled hazardous materials barred from the two harbor tunnels.\nThe bridge crossed one of the busiest shipping routes in the United States: the lower Patapsco River, which connects the Port of Baltimore to the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. In 2023, the port handled more than 444,000 passengers and 52.3 million tons of foreign cargo valued at $80 billion. It was the second-largest U.S. port for coal, and had been the leading port for automobiles and light trucks for 13 straight years, handling more than 847,000 vehicles in 2023. It employed 15,000 people and indirectly supported 140,000 others, annually helping to generate $3.3 billion in wages and salaries, $2.6 billion in business revenue, and $400 million in state and local tax revenue.\nMV Dali is a container ship registered in Singapore, and at the time of the collision (in legal terms, allision) was operated by Synergy Marine Group and owned by Grace Ocean Private Ltd, both based in Singapore. A Neopanamax vessel completed in 2015, Dali has a length of 980 feet (300 m), a 157-foot (48 m) beam, and a 40-foot (12.2 m) draft. Danish shipping company Maersk chartered Dali upon its delivery. Once in service, Dali had undergone 27 inspections at ports globally, including two in 2023: one in June in San Antonio, Chile, where a fuel-pressure gauge was repaired; and the second in September by the U.S. Coast Guard in New York, which found no problems. \nIn March 2024, Dali was crewed by 20 Indian nationals and one Sri Lankan. The ship traveled from Panama to New York, arriving on March 19, then sailed to the Virginia International Gateway in Portsmouth, Virginia. The ship left Virginia on March 22 and the following day arrived in Baltimore, where it underwent engine maintenance. An anonymous source told the Associated Press that an alarm on the ship's refrigerated containers went off while the ship was docked, likely due to an inconsistent power supply.\nWhen the bridge was completed in 1977, the largest container ships could hold 2,000 to 3,000 twenty-foot equivalent unit (TEU) containers. After the Panama Canal expansion began to allow the passage of 14,000-TEU vessels in 2016, the Maryland Port Administration installed new cranes and dredged the harbor to enable the port to accommodate the larger ships. At the time of its collision, Dali was loaded nearly to its 10,000-TEU capacity with 4,700 forty-foot containers.\nIn 1980, a ship roughly one-third the size of Dali struck and lightly damaged one of the bridge's piers. After the bridge collapsed in 2024, anonymous former agency officials told The Washington Post that the Maryland Transportation Authority (MDTA) did not consider studying the possibility of a collision with a larger ship, and instead spent decades studying how terrorists might attack the bridge after the September 11 attacks or inspecting for structural flaws similar to those that caused the I-35W Mississippi River bridge collapse in 2007. In 2018, the World Association for Waterborne Transport Infrastructure issued a report that noted that ship collisions with bridges are not infrequent and regularly cause damage that varies in significance, but do not typically result in catastrophic collisions that cause bridge collapses.\nFederal regulations for protecting bridges from ship collisions were updated in 1991 after the Sunshine Skyway Bridge collapse in 1980, but existing bridges were exempted by a grandfather clause, and the Francis Scott Key Bridge piers lacked the level of fender system or island barriers required of newer bridges. However, engineering experts debate whether such bridge protection systems could have prevented the collapse given Dali's size. While federal regulation requires that the design of national highway bridges conform to standards established by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), standards with minimum specifications for the strength of bridges in withstanding ship collisions were not promulgated by AASHTO until 1994.\n\n\n== Collapse ==\n\nDali left the Port of Baltimore at 12:44 a.m. EDT (04:44 UTC) on March 26, 2024, bound for Colombo, Sri Lanka. The ship had two local harbor pilots on board. Following standard operating procedure in Baltimore, tugboats that piloted the ship from its berth were released once the ship was in the channel. At 1:24 a.m., the ship suffered a \"complete blackout\" and began to drift out of the shipping channel; a backup generator supported electrical systems but did not provide power to the propulsion system. At 1:27 a.m., a mayday call was made from the ship, notifying the Maryland Department of Transportation that the crew had lost propulsion and control of the vessel and that a collision with the bridge was possible.\nOne of the pilots requested that traffic be stopped from crossing the bridge immediately. The ship's lights went out and came on again some moments later; then again went off and returned just before impact as smoke once again began rising from the funnel. At the pilot's request, the MDTA Police dispatch asked officers to stop traffic in both directions at 1:27:53 a.m.; outer loop (eastbound/northbound) traffic was stopped at the south side after 20 seconds. Inner loop (westbound/southbound) traffic was stopped at the north side by 1:28:58 a.m., around the time of the collapse. The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) reported that the ship dropped  anchor before hitting the bridge, as part of its emergency procedures. \nAt 1:28:45 a.m., the ship struck the southwest pier of the central truss arch span, at roughly 8 knots (9.2 mph; 15 km/h). AIS data showed the ship traveling at a speed of 8.7 knots (10.0 mph; 16.1 km/h) at 1:25 a.m. before departing the channel and slowing to 6.8 knots (7.8 mph; 12.6 km/h) by the time of the collision two minutes later.\nWithin seconds of the collision, the bridge broke apart in several places, leaving sections protruding from the water and the roadway's approaches cut off. The main span fell onto the ship's bow and a section of it came to rest there. The bridge strike and partial collapse were recorded on video.\nMultiple vehicles were on the bridge at the time it collapsed, though initially no one was believed to be inside them. Workers were repairing potholes on the bridge and were in their vehicles on a break at the time of the collapse. A resident living near the bridge recalled being awakened by deep rumbling that shook his residence for several seconds following the collapse, which he said \"felt like an earthquake\".\nEmergency teams began receiving 911 calls at 1:30 a.m. The Baltimore Police Department was alerted to the collapse at 1:35 a.m. Large rescue and recovery efforts were begun. The Coast Guard deployed boats and a helicopter as part of rescue efforts. Fifty public safety divers in eight teams were dispatched to search for people who fell into the river.\n\n\n=== Damage ===\n\nThe bridge's continuous truss relied on its overall structure to maintain integrity; in engineering terms, it was fracture critical, meaning it had no redundancy against removal of support of any particular part of it. The collision destroyed its southwest main truss pier, causing the south and central spans to collapse, which led to the collapse of a northern span. Each failure sequence took seconds, and within 30 seconds the entirety of the trussed spans, and three others, had fallen.\nThe bridge was determined to be fully compliant with the building code when it collapsed. The bridge had dolphin and fender protection against ship impact, but these protections were insufficient.\nOf Dali's 4,700 shipping containers, 13 were damaged in the collision. Two fell into the water, neither of which carried hazardous substances. Dali sustained hull damage above the water line and the ship was impaled by remnants of the bridge superstructure (estimated to be 3,000 to 4,000 tonnes of bridge wreckage), which pressed it against the channel floor. The ship remained watertight, and the shipping company initially claimed there was no water pollution directly from the ship. Authorities installed 2,400 feet (730 m) of water containment booms around the ship after a sheen was detected in the waterway, which was believed to have been produced by 21 US gallons (17 imp gal; 79 L) of oil that leaked from a bow thruster on the ship. On March 27, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) announced an investigation into a hazmat spill resulting from breached containers aboard Dali, including some of the 56 containers that carried about 764 tons of hazardous materials: primarily corrosives, flammable substances (including  lithium batteries), and Class 9 materials.\n\n\n== Casualties ==\nNOAA reported a water temperature of 47 °F (8 °C) at the time of the collapse. Two people were rescued from the river: one was in \"very serious\" condition and the other uninjured. One of those rescued was a Mexican national. The lawyer of one of the survivors later said that his client was in his car at the time of the collapse, but was able to roll down the window of his vehicle, which was on manual, in order to escape. Six people, all part of the maintenance crew working on the bridge, were reported missing and presumed dead following the suspension of a Coast Guard search. One was identified as a Honduran national, two were from Guatemala, and the others were from El Salvador and Mexico.\nFive submerged vehicles, including three passenger vehicles and a transit mixer, were detected using sonar. Emergency services also used drones and infrared technology in the search. The bodies of two of the maintenance crew were recovered from inside a red pickup truck: a 35-year-old Mexican national and a 26-year-old Guatemalan national. They were found at a depth of 25 feet (7.6 m) below the mid-section of the bridge. The search was suspended based on the condition of the debris and risk of further collapse. On April 5, the body of a 38-year-old Honduran national was recovered from a submerged vehicle. A 35-year-old Guatemalan national, a 49-year-old Salvadoran national, and a Mexican national remain among the missing. On April 14, the remains of a fourth worker were found in one of the construction vehicles. Whilst they have been positively identified, their family has requested their identity be withheld.\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration regulations require that construction companies keep skiffs available at construction sites over waterways. Coast Guard officials said they were unaware of whether the company that employed the highway workers had one available, and satellite imagery at the time of the bridge collapse does not appear to show one present at the bridge. The company declined to respond to press inquiries about whether a boat was available.\nDali's crew and the two pilots were accounted for and did not sustain any serious injuries. One crew member was slightly injured and required some stitches. Groups such as the Baltimore International Seafarers' Center made efforts to support the crew members as they remained on the boat, including providing them with Wi-Fi hotspots.\n\n\n== Investigation ==\n\nThe NTSB began an investigation and sent a team to the site. The agency is expected to release a preliminary report two to four weeks after the collapse, and later issue urgent safety recommendations, while its investigation could take between 12 and 24 months. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was also deployed to the scene, but said that terrorism was not suspected in the incident. On March 27, a Unified Command Joint Information Center was established to coordinate the investigation and salvage. The command includes team members from the U.S. Coast Guard, Maryland Department of the Environment, MDTA, Maryland State Police, and Synergy Marine, as the primary stakeholders. \nAs the flag state, Singapore's Transport Safety Investigation Bureau (TSIB) and the MPA sent personnel to Baltimore to help in investigations. The MPA said it offered support to the NTSB and the Office of Marine Safety.\nNTSB personnel boarded the ship late on March 26 and obtained the voyage data recorder (VDR), which would help investigators develop a timeline of events leading up to the collision. Several possible factors were being considered, including the possibility that contaminated fuel or an improper grade of fuel had caused the loss of the ship's power. At a Senate Commerce Committee hearing on April 10, NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said the agency would not likely issue its preliminary report until the first week of May. She said investigators were gathering data about the ship's electrical system, examining its circuit breakers with the assistance of Dali shipbuilder Hyundai Heavy Industries, and comparing the bridge's design and pier protection to current regulatory standards.\nOn April 15, FBI agents searched Dali in a criminal investigation to establish whether the crew left the port aware that the ship had problems with its electrical or mechanical systems.\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\nThis timeline is based mostly on NTSB's preliminary analysis of events from the ship's VDR and the MDTA Police log.\n\n\n=== Impact force ===\nThe force of the impact with the pier was estimated by The New York Times writers using equations from the AASHTO publication Guide Specifications and Commentary for Vessel Collision Design of Highway Bridges as between 120 and 230 meganewtons. In comparison, Saturn V rockets generated 35 meganewtons of thrust at launch.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe debris from the collapse has blocked maritime access to virtually the entirety of the Port of Baltimore; nearly 30 ships had signaled the port as their destination, and more than 40 were trapped. Only one part of the Port of Baltimore was unaffected: the Tradepoint Atlantic marine terminal at Sparrows Point, on the seaward side of the Key Bridge. Tradepoint Atlantic said on April 3 that it began preparing for an influx of redirected ships and estimated that it would unload and process 10,000 vehicles over the next 15 days.\nMaryland governor Wes Moore declared a state of emergency shortly thereafter, and Maryland Secretary of Transportation Paul Wiedefeld ordered the suspension of all shipping to and from the Port of Baltimore until further notice; trucking facilities remained operational. At 4:15 a.m., the Federal Aviation Administration imposed a 5-nautical-mile (5.8 mi; 9.3 km) temporary flight restriction around the incident site. Maersk, which chartered the vessel, saw the price of its shares decline by about 2% when trading opened at Nasdaq Copenhagen on March 26.\n\n\n=== Salvage ===\n\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is taking the lead in removing the fallen portions of the bridge. The U.S. Navy is planning to remove the submerged portions using barges with heavy-lift cranes, including the \"largest crane ship on the East Coast\": the Chesapeake 1000 of the Donjon Marine Co., able to lift 1,000 short tons (890 long tons; 910 t). The designated salvor is Resolve Marine. Thirty-two USACE personnel and 38 Navy contractors were deployed to the scene. More than 1,100 engineering specialists were to join them. Seven floating cranes, ten tugboats, nine barges, eight salvage vessels, and five Coast Guard boats were deployed around the bridge. \nOn March 30, engineers began removing the first piece of the bridge from the river. On April 1, the Coast Guard opened a temporary passage for commercial work vessels involved in recovery and clearing efforts, with a controlling depth of 11 feet (3.4 m), a horizontal clearance of 264 feet (80 m) and a vertical clearance of 96 feet (29 m), and was approving ships' passage case by case. The next day, the first work vessel used the alternate channel: a tugboat pushing a fuel barge to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware. A second channel was opened the next day, as work continued on a third channel. On April 7, salvage crews started removing containers from Dali. By April 16, the salvage operation had removed more than 1,000 tons of steel from the waterway.\n\n\n=== Supply chain disruptions ===\nExcept for the Sparrows Point terminal, Baltimore's marine terminals closed to shipping and shall remain so until a channel is cleared. This led shipping lines to seek alternate ports for ships en route to Baltimore and forced shippers to attempt to arrange for land transportation from those ports before unloaded cargoes would incur late fees: namely, detention and demurrage charges.\nOn March 26, three shipping lines—CMA CGM, then COSCO and Evergreen—declared force majeure in terminating their contracts of carriage with clients once cargo is delivered to diversion ports. On March 28, the Mediterranean Shipping Company followed suit, while Maersk announced that it would provide transport from diversion ports to its clients. Maersk paused all service to Baltimore indefinitely.\nStellantis and General Motors said they will divert vehicle imports to other ports, and Toyota reported that some of their exports could be affected. The bridge collapse also isolated the terminals of Mercedes-Benz, CSX at Curtis Bay, and Consol Energy. On April 1, CSX announced a new route for diverted Baltimore imports arriving at the Port of New York and New Jersey. CSX completed its first diverted cargo shipments on April 4, while Norfolk Southern announced a dedicated service for diverted imports from New York to Baltimore on April 3.\nWhilst economists said the port closure was unlikely to reduce U.S. economic growth, Dun & Bradstreet estimated the weekly cost of the supply chain disruptions caused by the port closure to be $1.7 billion. On March 28, New York governor Kathy Hochul and New Jersey governor Phil Murphy offered the use of ports in their states in handling affected cargo shipments to minimize supply chain disruptions.\nUSACE initially estimated that clearing the channel to reopen the port would probably take weeks rather than months, and experts familiar with the salvage operations said the reopening could happen as early as May. On April 4, USACE announced a tentative schedule to open a limited-access one-way channel for barges and roll-on/roll-off ships by the end of April and the entire Fort McHenry Channel by the end of May. By April 20 three temporary alternate channels had been opened, named after immediate local landmarks – from north to south – Sollers Point, Fort Carroll, and Hawkins Point Shoal. They are estimated to allow approximately 15% of pre-collapse economic activity to resume.\n\n\n=== Local effects ===\n\nI-695 remains closed between the MD 173 and MD 157 interchanges. Traffic is being detoured along I-95 and I-895, which cross Baltimore Harbor respectively at the Fort McHenry and Baltimore Harbor tunnels; vehicles carrying hazardous loads are not permitted in either tunnel. Vehicles with hazardous loads and those exceeding the tunnels' vertical clearances are being detoured along the western section of I-695, bypassing from the north and west the entire city of Baltimore. Warnings of traffic delays were issued to motorists as far away as Virginia.\nCruise ships originally bound for Baltimore docked in other cities. For example, Carnival Legend docked in Norfolk, Virginia, on March 31 and seventy buses took passengers back to Maryland. On April 4, Vision of the Seas was diverted to Norfolk, where its 2,200 passengers boarded buses for Baltimore.\nGovernor Moore said that 8,000 jobs could be affected by the bridge's collapse and called the disaster a \"global crisis\". The waterway's closure is causing an estimated daily loss of $15 million. On March 30, the Small Business Administration (SBA) announced that it would make low-interest and long-term loans of up to $2 million to small businesses hurt by the bridge collapse in the Mid-Atlantic states, and the SBA received 500 applications by April 4.\n\nIn the Maryland General Assembly, Bill Ferguson, the president of the Maryland Senate, and state delegate Luke Clippinger introduced emergency legislation to provide money to workers and local businesses affected by the disaster. After discussions with the Moore administration, Ferguson added a provision to establish a state scholarship for the children of the maintenance workers killed in the collapse. On April 8, the General Assembly passed a bill to draw upon the state's rainy day fund to pay port employees who were thrown out of work and are not covered by state unemployment insurance; the governor may also use the fund to help some small businesses avoid layoffs and to encourage companies that shift to other ports to return to a reopened Baltimore port. Governor Moore signed the bill the following day. On April 12, Moore issued an executive order under the law to start a $12.5 million program operated by the Maryland Department of Labor to prevent layoffs by port businesses.\nRepublican state senators Bryan Simonaire and Johnny Ray Salling introduced another bill to allow the governor to declare a year-long state of emergency after damage to critical infrastructure, but it would also have eliminated the authority to seize private property for government use, as now allowed under a state of emergency; Simonaire withdrew the bill after discussions with the Moore administration.\n\n\n=== Litigation and insurance ===\nBarclays, Morningstar DBRS, Fitch Ratings, and the Insurance Information Institute estimated that the insured losses from the collision could range from $1 billion to $4 billion, potentially surpassing the losses from the 2012 Costa Concordia disaster. Lloyd's of London chairman Bruce Carnegie-Brown said the claims could become the largest marine insurance loss in history. Wrongful death liabilities were estimated to total $350 million to $700 million. Moody's Ratings officials said most claims would likely fall on reinsurance companies, about 80 of which provide some $3 billion in coverage to Dali's insurers. The Maryland state government's insurance for the bridge covers up to $350 million for damage, while the bridge cost $60 million to construct in 1977 (about $302 million in 2023).\nOn April 1, Grace Ocean Private and Synergy Marine Group filed a joint petition in the Maryland U.S. District Court to limit their liability to about $43.6 million under the Limitation of Liability Act of 1851. Chief judge James K. Bredar is overseeing the proceedings. Grace Ocean and Synergy Marine are represented by Duane Morris and Blank Rome. The legal process could last up to a decade and has been described as likely being \"one of the most contentious marine insurance cases in recent decades\". On April 17, Grace Ocean Private filed a general average declaration to require cargo owners to cover part of the salvage costs.\nOn April 15, the city of Baltimore hired personal injury firm Saltz Mongeluzzi & Bendesky and civil rights firm DiCello Levitt to pursue legal action against Grace Ocean Private, Synergy Marine Group, and Maersk.\n\n\n== Responses ==\n\nPresident Joe Biden was briefed on the disaster within hours of the collision. U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg contacted Maryland governor Wes Moore and Baltimore mayor Brandon Scott to offer his department's support. Moore addressed the families of the victims in Spanish, saying, \"Estamos contigo, ahora y siempre [we are with you, now and always]\". Maryland Center for History and Culture vice president David Belew said, \"Our harbor, port and many families are fundamentally changed\" by the disaster. On March 27, Moore and Biden thanked Dali's crew for transmitting the mayday call warning of the ship's power failure and the impending collision. On March 28, three officers of the MDTA were recognized at the opening game of the Baltimore Orioles for their role in stopping traffic before the bridge collapsed.\n\nBiden visited the site on April 5; he surveyed the wreckage from Marine One and was later briefed by officials from the local government, the Coast Guard and USACE. He pledged the support of the federal government for a bridge replacement and the recovery effort \"every step of the way\", adding that \"the nation has your back\". He also met with families of the victims. On April 11, Moore announced that the state government had launched a website with information about federal, state, and local government programs related to the bridge collapse.\nThe Mexican embassy in the U.S. is providing consular assistance to the families, with a dedicated phone line for affected Mexican nationals. Mexican president Andrés Manuel López Obrador said the disaster highlighted the contribution of migrants to the US economy and \"demonstrates that migrants go out and do risky jobs at midnight\". Rafael Laveaga Rendón, head of the consular section, travelled to Baltimore to help the workers’ families. It has been confirmed that one of the rescued was from Michoacán, while the two Mexican nationals who are still missing are from Michoacán and Veracruz. \n\n\n=== Replacement bridge ===\nIn an address on March 26, Biden said that he would ask Congress to fund a replacement bridge. On March 28, the federal government released an initial $60 million in emergency aid under the Emergency Relief (ER) Program of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) that is subsidized by the Highway Trust Fund. Buttigieg also urged Congress to provide funding for a replacement bridge. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said that it was the federal government's responsibility to absorb the costs.\nOn April 5, the House Freedom Caucus issued a statement listing demands for their support of funding for a replacement bridge, including that the federal government seek maximum liability from the shipping companies upfront. Ben Cardin, U.S. senator from Maryland, vowed to hold those responsible for the bridge collapse accountable, but argued against waiting for related litigation to be resolved and insurance claims to be approved, saying \"We're not going to delay opening our channel or rebuilding our bridge with the lengthy process that may take\", with which Buttigieg agreed. On April 8, Moore said he would talk with members of Congress the following week about funding a replacement bridge. At an April 10 hearing of the Senate Commerce Committee, ranking member Ted Cruz of Texas said the federal government \"needs to help rebuild the bridge,\" but also argued that legal protections to protect taxpayers from the costs of litigation should be implemented and expressed concern about potential bureaucratic delays.\nWhile some engineering professors suggested that replacing the bridge could take as long as 10 years and cost at least $350 million, a report issued by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) noted that replacement bridges can qualify for a Categorical Exclusion (CE) under the National Environmental Policy Act to accelerate regulatory review and project delivery. The report also noted that the I-35W Saint Anthony Falls Bridge that replaced the I-35W Mississippi River bridge was completed in 11 months with the help of a CE, while repairs to the Sunshine Skyway Bridge took five years to complete.\nThe CRS report notes that a replacement bridge project could be eligible to receive up to 80% of its funding from the FHWA ER Program since the bridge was a state highway, 90% if the expenses cause the state government to exceed its federal-aid highway program funds for the fiscal year, or 100% of the project cost if Congress makes an exception for the project from the ER Program rules (which Congress did for the I-35W Saint Anthony Falls Bridge), while any state funds received from an approved insurance claim would offset funding awarded from the ER Program. However, the ER Program has a $2.1 billion backlog of emergency relief reimbursements to states and only $890 million on hand. Other transportation-policy scholars have suggested that a replacement bridge could qualify for funding under the Bridge Investment Program created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.\nOn April 9, the Maryland congressional delegation announced that they would introduce a bill to make an exception to the ER Program rules for a replacement bridge. On April 11, Cardin and Maryland senator Chris Van Hollen introduced a bill in the Senate (S. 4114; referred to the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee), while Maryland representatives Kweisi Mfume, Steny Hoyer, Dutch Ruppersberger, John Sarbanes, Andy Harris, Jamie Raskin, David Trone, and Glenn Ivey introduced a bill in the House (H.R. 7961; referred to the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee).\n\n\n=== Bridge safety regulation ===\nOn March 27, Buttigieg said that the U.S. Department of Transportation would apply the findings of the NTSB investigation of the bridge collapse to \"regulation, inspection, design or funding of bridges in the future\". He noted that the bridge was not designed to withstand the impact of a vessel of Dali's weight (about 95,000 tonnes empty). In 2022, the FHWA finalized new data specifications for state inspectors to use for bridge pier protections that are scheduled to take effect in 2026.\nAccording to a Wall Street Journal analysis of the National Bridge Inventory, there are eight U.S. bridges that are fracture critical (a condition flagged by the NTSB in its investigation) and have similar vertical clearance as the Francis Scott Key Bridge: the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, the Lewis and Clark Bridge over the Columbia River, the St. Johns Bridge, the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, the Golden Gate Bridge, the George Washington Bridge, the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, and the Chesapeake Bay Bridge.\nWhen reporters asked about a proposal to require tugboats to pilot vessels around critical maritime infrastructure, officials with the Coast Guard, the Department of Transportation, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Joint Information Center either referred the inquiries to different agencies or said their agencies lacked jurisdiction to create such a regulation. By April 11, the Maryland Port Administration had begun consulting tugboat operators about potential modifications to protocol, which would depend upon recommendations from the NTSB and the Coast Guard.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of bridge failures\nSevern Railway Bridge accident – a similar incident in the UK in 1960\nTasman Bridge disaster – a similar incident in Australia in 1975\nAlmö Bridge collapse – a similar incident in Sweden in 1980\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Works cited ===\nFrittelli, John; Goldman, Ben; Lohman, Ali E.

        "content": "Ren's Toothache is the 3rd  episode of the second season of The Ren & Stimpy Show that originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on 22 August 1992.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nRen's teeth are in a deplorable state owing to his lifelong rejection of dental hygiene. As his teeth decay, he is in increasing pain until his teeth shatter completely. As only the nerve endings for his teeth are left, Ren has difficulty eating while a group of flies festering in Stimpy's litterbox complain about the bad smells coming from Ren's mouth. Stimpy tells Ren to wait for the Old Man Hunger aka the Nerve-Ending Fairy who will leave $300 for his nerve endings. Ren pull outs his nerve endings with a plier and leaves out them at night, but only receive lint from the Nerve Ending Fairy. Finally, Stimpy donates one of his teeth to Ren.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRen-voice of John Kricfalusi\nStimpy-voice of Billy West\nThe Beaver-voice of Vincent Waller\nFlies-voice of Billy West\nOld Man Hunger-voice of Billy West\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe showrunner, John Kricfalusi, created Ren's Toothache to be a grotesque and unpleasant episode. Ren's Tootache was one of the few episodes from season two to be delivered on time for its scheduled premiere date in August 1992. The episode was heavily censored by the Nickelodeon network, which removes the scene Stimpy collects his spit into jars.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe American critic Hayden Mears wrote: \"One of the show's defining elements was its texture. When Ren learns the putrid perils of his unbrushed chompers in “Ren's Toothache,” you smell the stench coming from his mouth. Thanks to some vivid close-ups, you feel a cartoon character's rotting tooth\". Likewise, the American critic Gary Kramer wrote that Ren's Tootache with its close-up shots of Ren's decaying teeth and gums was a prime example of the show's tendency to focus on the gross and disgusting.\nThe American critic Martin Goodman wrote the Ren & Stimpy Show explored fears of illness, decay and death as the show \"featured filth, illness, disease and mutilation to an unprecedented degree, making these horrors an integral part of the show\" with Ren's Toothache being a prime example as \"exposed nerve endings writhe\" in Ren's mouth. Goodman argued that the appeal of such disgusting images to young people was that young people know that their youth will not last and eventually they will grow old, their bodies will decay and finally they will die. Goodman argued that the presentation of images of sickness and bodily decay in The Ren & Stimpy Show was a way for young people to confront fears of their own eventual coming bodily decay in a comical context. The American critic Calvin Kemph wrote that Kricfalusi often featured repulsive images, adding: \"Ren’s Toothache stands out as a primary example, where a rotted mouth of teeth turns grotesque, sharply detailing the smell and abject horror of a nightmare.\"\n\n\n== Books ==\nDobbs, G.

        "content": "Sanctuary Mountain Maungatautari, is a protected natural area in Waikato Region, New Zealand where the biodiversity of 3,400 ha of forest is being restored. The sanctuary covers the mountain peak, Maungatautari.\nMost of New Zealand's ecosystems have been severely modified by the introduction of land mammals that were not present during the evolution of its ecosystems, and have had a devastating impact on both native flora and fauna. The sanctuary, surrounded by a pest-exclusion fence, is a good example of an ecological island, which allows the original natural ecosystems to recover by minimising the impact of introduced flora and fauna.\n\n\n== Ecological area ==\n\nMaungatautari, as an eroded volcano was chosen as a suitable site for a major ecological project for a number of reasons, including the diversity of its terrain, the relative integrity of natural areas in spite of some human engineered changes, the commitment of surrounding communities, and the feasibility of fence-construction given surrounding developed terrain.\nSome elements of the diversity of Maungatautari took scientists by surprise. In April 2006, the discovery of 100 silver beech trees caused considerable excitement in the botanical community. The tree, native to southern New Zealand, had not previously been believed to be present on Maungatautari, although researchers who came to investigate emphasized that the tree had probably been established during the last ice age. The largest of the trees were estimated to be several centuries old. Jim Mylchreest, Maungatautari Trust's chief executive, pointed out that the trees were not only exciting in themselves, but also for the fungi and insects they might host that also may not have been expected to be present on Maungatautari.\n\n\n=== Species found ===\nIn December 2004, eleven endangered Hochstetter's frogs were found living on Maungatautari in a rocky region. There had already been discussions about potentially reintroducing the Hochstetter's frog to the preserve, and the rare discovery of the small population in an environment being prepared to protect them excites the scientific community.\nA dead Duvaucel's gecko was found in a mouse trap in March 2010; this was the first sighting of this species on mainland New Zealand for almost 100 years, probably indicating a surviving population of the gecko within Maungatautari.\n\n\n=== Ecological restoration plan ===\nBecause poisons and trapping, traditional methods of pest control, have limited success and seldom last long, the creators of the plan decided to enclose the 34 square kilometres of bush with a 47 km pest-exclusion fence to create an ecological island. When the environment was rendered suitable, the area was to be repopulated with the entire suite of charismatic species that may now be locally extinct, such as North Island brown kiwi, North Island kōkako, kākāriki, tuatara and many others. Kākā already visited regularly and were likely to become resident if suitable methods are employed.\nIn November 2003, the Trust constructed two exclosures, at the north and south of Maungatautari, totalling 1.1 square kilometres.  The Trust used these areas to demonstrate the fence's feasibility and to test pest removal methods, which were launched in September 2004. The exclosures are now predator-free and were used as holding areas for native species while the main fence was being built.\nIn November 2005 a 3 hectare area adjacent to the Southern Enclosure, the Tautari Wetland, was gifted to the Trust by the Tauroa family for takahē and other wetland birds. A Tuatarium for the future was designed and planted inside the area.\n\nIn July 2004, the Trust began constructing the Xcluder fence. In September 2006 the Trust completed fencing the entire 34 square kilometres to exclude all pests (and was able to take advantage of parts of the exclosures' fencing constructed at Stage 1). Then the Trust began eliminating pests by dropping poison, starting with brodifacoum in November 2006. A second application was made in December 2006. The combined effect of the poison, trapping and hunting eliminated brown rats, black rats, stoats, cats, weasels, ferrets, red deer, fallow deer, pigs, goats, possums, hedgehogs, rabbits and hares. In 2007 the sole remaining pest species was mice, and poison was dropped a third time, in September that year, to eradicate them. This failed, and in 2011 the trust introduced a new policy, focusing on controlling rather than eradicating mice.\nOne of the greater challenges facing the designers of the Xcluder fence adopted for the purpose was addressing entry at streams. Since water levels fluctuate and a fence needed to address both debris and fish migration, the Xcluder was outfitted with an electronic surveillance system to alert the Trust if a watergate fails to properly close. There have been other challenges with the fence, including storm damage in July 2007 that was quickly repaired.\nIn July 2006, a viewing tower was constructed near a northern rata grove in the southern exclosure.\n\n\n=== Species reintroduction ===\nSince the beginning of the project, native species have returned to the area either naturally or through reintroduction. In July 2007, a 300% increase was discovered in the native beetle population of the southern enclosure.\n\nIn December 2005 Maungatautari witnessed its first kiwi call in approximately a hundred years. Radio signals in April 2007 suggested that the kiwi may be sitting on an egg, but that nest was found to be bare. In September 2007, two kiwi eggs were discovered. Although one proved infertile, the other hatched in December 2007, the first kiwi egg known to have hatched on Maungatautari in a century. \nAs of 2021, 320 founders of the North Island brown kiwi (Apteryx mantelli) western taxon have been introduced.\nIn June 2006, the Trust began reintroducing species, starting with a pair of critically endangered takahē. In April 2007, three species of endangered whitebait (kokopu or native trout) were reintroduced. In May, kākā were put into a special enclosure to allow them to acclimatise before they were released; they quickly attracted wild companions. In November of that year, seven kākā were released from the aviary.\nOn 3 December 2007, the trust announced that they planned to reintroduce North Island robins, North Island kōkako, tuatara, popokatea (whiteheads) and hihi (stitchbirds) in 2008. March 2009 saw the release of 60 whiteheads (popokatea).\nBetween 2009 and 2011, 155 hihi (stitchbirds) were released over 3 translocations (135 from Tiritiri Matangi Island and 20 from Little Barrier Island).\n2011 saw the release of 40 North Island robins from Pureora Forest with a further 40 in 2012.\nIn 2012 and 2013 200 Mahoenui giant weta (Deinacrida mahoenui) were introduced into the sanctuary. Also in 2012, 50 tuatara from Stephens Island were reintroduced.\nIn 2013, 40 North Island saddleback were translocated from Tiritiri Matangi Island.\nIn 2015, 40 North Island kōkako were translocated from Pureora Forest.\nIn 2021, 80 riflemen (titiponamu) were translocated from Pirongia and Pureora.\nOn July 20, 2023, four kākāpō were reintroduced to the sanctuary, becoming the first kākāpō living in mainland New Zealand in almost 40 years. Despite extensive improvements to the perimeter fence, in October 2023, one of the kākāpō escaped by using a downed tree to climb out. The bird was located using the signal from its GPS transmitter and returned to the sanctuary. A second group of six birds was introduced to the sanctuary in September. However, two further kākāpō found a way over the fence, and in November the Department of Conservation temporarily removed three birds from the sanctuary to a southern predator-free island, leaving the kākāpō population in the sanctuary at seven. The department commented that \"“Kākāpō are flightless but are excellent climbers who can use their wings to parachute from treetops\".\n\n\n=== Native species ===\n\n\n==== Mammals ====\nNew Zealand long-tailed bat (Chalinolobus tuberculatus)\n\n\n==== Birds ====\n\nGrey teal (Anas gracilis)\nAustralasian shoveler (Anas rhynchotis)\nGrey duck (Anas superciliosa)\nNew Zealand bellbird (korimako) (Anthornis melanura)\nNorth Island brown kiwi (kiwi) (Apteryx mantelli)\nAustralasian bittern (Botaurus poiciloptilus)\nShining cuckoo (Chrysococcyx lucidas)\nAustralasian harrier (Circus approximans)\nWhite-faced heron (Egretta novaehollandiae)\nNew Zealand falcon (kārearea) (Falco novaeseelandiae)\nGrey warbler (riroriro) (Gerygone igata)\nNew Zealand kingfisher (Halcyon sancta)\nWood pigeon (kererū) (Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae)\nWelcome swallow (Hirundo neoxena)\nMorepork (Ninox novaeseelandiae)\nStitchbird (hihi) (Notiomystis cincta)\nNorth Island tomtit (Miromiro) (Petroica macrocephala toitoi)\nWhitehead (pōpokotea) (Mohoua albicilla)\nBlack shag (Phalacrocorax carbo)\nLittle pied cormorant (Phalacrocorax melanoleucos)\nNew Zealand dabchick (Poliocephalus rufopectus)\nTakahē (Porphyrio hochstetteri)\nPūkeko (Porphyrio porphyrio)\nNorth Island fantail (Piwakawaka) (Rhipidura fulginosa placabilis)\nKākāpō (Strigops habroptila)\nParadise shelduck (Tadorna variegata)\nSilvereye (Zosterops lateralis)\nTūī (Prosthemadera novaeseelandiae)\nKākā (Nestor meridionalis)\n\n\n==== Amphibians ====\nHochstetter's frog (Leiopelma hochstetteri)\n\n\n==== Reptiles ====\nCopper skink (Cyclodina aenea)\nForest gecko (Hoplodactylus granulatus)\nPacific gecko (Hoplodactylus pacifica)\nAuckland green gecko (Naultinus elegans elegans)\nDuvaucel's gecko (Hoplodactylus duvaucelli)\n\n\n==== Fish ====\nNew Zealand longfin eel (Anguilla dieffenbachii)\nGiant kokopu, (Galaxias argenteus)\nBanded kokopu, (Galaxias fasciatus)\nShortjaw kokopu, (Galaxias postvectis)\n\n\n==== Invertebrates ====\nOnychophora\nMecodema oconnori\n(Survey yet to be done)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSanctuary website",

According to the Handbook of Texas, the community had an estimated population of 30 in 2000.\n\n\n== History ==\nOriginally, Flagg was a portion of the 52,000 acres (21,000 ha) 7-UP Ranch, which was founded in 1884 by James W. Carter, the first person to live in the county. Because of the way the acreage was laid out, C. T. Herring named the property Flag (Flagg) Ranch when he purchased it in 1904. Herring decided to divide the property into 160 acres (65 ha) lots in 1925 and market them as farms. Together with his partners, he planned a townsite and built a two-story hotel with a post office. Some buyers traveled long distances to choose their allotments. By year's end, Flagg operated a lumberyard, a blacksmith shop, a land office, and two stores. Still, the existence of this little agricultural shopping area on Running Water Draw was brief, primarily due to the proximity to Dimmitt and better roadways. There were perhaps ten people living there in the early 1930s. In 1947, the post office was shut down. Local groups like the Ladies' Aid Society amalgamated with Dimmitt's clubs as well. Two miles west on Farm Road 1055 are a fertilizer industry, a grain elevator, and a cotton gin; the original townsite is deserted. Flagg recorded a population of fifty between 1940 and 1990. The population in 2000 was thirty.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nFlagg is located at the intersection of Farm to Market Roads 1055 and 1524, 12 mi (19 km) southeast of Dimmitt, 34 mi (55 km) east of Bovina, and 23 mi (37 km) south of Hereford in southwestern Castro County.\n\n\n== Education ==\nIn 1925, Flagg had a one-room school that was also used as a union church. In 1929, the Flagg school district was formally established, and the following year, a four-room brick structure was finished. The community joined the Dimmitt Independent School District in 1945.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Nelson Wayne Carr is an American businessman and Mississippi politician who has served on the Mississippi Public Service Commission for the Southern District since 2024 after defeating incumbent Dane Maxwell in the primary. Prior to his role on the commission, he served in the contracting and development business as an electrician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nCarr was born and raised in Gulfport, Mississippi. He graduated from Gulfport High School in 1977 and entered the construction industry as an electrical apprentice. He was licensed by the Mississippi Board of Contractors Electrical and Builders Licenses and has worked as a building contracting agent.\nCarr ran in the 2023 Mississippi elections in the Republican primary for the Mississippi Public Service Commission for the Southern District. He ran against incumbent and former mayor of Pascagoula Dane Maxwell, who he alleged had violated campaign finance law for improperly reporting campaign donations. He expressed support for diversifying fuel sources and protecting against supply shortages and price spikes on his campaign website.\nIn the election, he voiced support for scrutinizing rate cases and taking a closer look at out-of-state companies. He encouraged more solar companies in Mississippi \"to promote competition\" and supported net metering. He critiqued excessive federal regulations from the EPA on coal and disputed the need for a consumer advocate watchdog. He supported the idea of modular nuclear power units for grid stability.\nHe won the primary 52% to 47%. He ran uncontested in the general election.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "\"Terminus\" is a science fiction short story  by Polish writer Stanisław Lem first published in 1961 in the collection Księga robotów. It is a story of a robot which was damaged in a spaceship accident and started performing eerie actions it was not aware of, as if it was somehow \"possessed\" by the spaceship crew that had perished in the same accident.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nPirx becomes a spaceship captain, and his first appointment is an old renovated ship which had been destroyed in a collision with a meteor swarm nineteen years ago, and its crew had perished, marooned without oxygen. On the ship Pirx runs into a robot named Terminus repairing leakages from ship's nuclear engine, and to his surprise Pirx recognizes Morse code in robot's tapping, which appears to carry communications with each other of the long dead crew, isolated in separate cabins. Terminus is unaware of what happens to it. It seems that the memories of the crew got imprinted in robot's circuits, otherwise primitive and lacking any mental abilities. Pirx tries to tap a message himself and gets a frantic response: it appears that these memories began a life of their own, not just a record. Unfazed with the macabre situation, Pirx, typical of his personality, looks for a rational explanation of why would a primitive \"iron madman\" seem to suffer from PTSD. Eventually realizing the pointlessness of this kind of \"communication with the dead\", Pirx decides to scrap Terminus.\n\n\n== Discussion ==\nWojciech Orliński describes the story as a superb example of the transfer of the macabre atmosphere characteristic of Stefan Grabiński, a \"Polish Poe\", to science fiction.  Lem himsef in an interview admits the influence of Grabiński's horror stories on his early works, including Terminus. As Dominika Oramus puts it: the tale of Terminus \"is told in a mis-en-scene of horror with supernatural innuendoes. A gigantic, empty ship, rusty machinery, a murky past and dusty pilot seats set the mood at the very beginning.\"\nJerzy Jarzębski and Dominika Oramus cite Terminus among the examples of Lem's robots who got destroyed by an infusion of humanness into them (see \"Stanisław Lem and robots\" for more on this issue). \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Milivoje Đurković (Serbian Cyrillic: Миливоје Ђурковић; born 1936) is a Kosovo Serb politician. He was the mayor of Dečani in the 1990s and served in the National Assembly of Serbia from 1997 to 2001. During his political career, Đurković was a member of the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS).\n\n\n== Private career ==\nĐurković has worked as a salesperson.\n\n\n== Politician ==\n\n\n=== Mayor of Dečani ===\nRelations between Kosovo's Serb and Albanian communities were generally very poor in the 1990s, and most of the Albanian community boycotted Serbia's political institutions in favour of their own parallel structures. Even prior to the 1998–99 Kosovo War, the population of Dečani was predominantly Albanian.\nĐurković served as mayor of Dečani after the December 1992 Serbian local elections. In August 1996, he said that unknown individuals had used explosive devices to target a housing complex in the village of Babaloć for Serb and Montenegrin refugees from [[Albania].\nThe Socialist Party of Serbia won an overwhelming victory in Dečani in the 1996 local elections, and Đurković was confirmed afterward for another term as mayor. \nForces of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) took control of much of Dečani in the early period of the Kosovo War. In April 1998, Đurković said that by Serb villagers in remote areas were leaving their homes and moving nearer the town. The following month, he told the media, \"with the exception of the town itself, all the surrounding area is held by increasingly aggressive terrorists.\" In March 1999, just before the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, he said that the region had returned to a state of relative calm.\nSerbia lost control over Dečani after the Kosovo War, and almost all of the area's Serbs fled the area. \nĐurković was for time placed on a list of persons who could not obtain visas for European Union (EU) countries. This occurred during a period of broader sanctions against the regime of Yugoslavian president and SPS leader Slobodan Milošević.\n\n\n=== Parliamentarian (1997–2001) ===\nĐurković appeared in the fourteenth position (out of fourteen) on the Socialist Party's electoral list for the Peć division in the 1997 Serbian parliamentary election. From 1992 to 2000, Serbia's electoral law stipulated that one-third of parliamentary mandates would be assigned to candidates on successful lists in numerical order, with the remaining two-thirds distributed to other candidates at the discretion of the sponsoring parties or coalitions. The Socialist Party won twelve seats in the division, and Đurković was assigned one of the \"optional\" mandates. The Socialist Party won the election and afterward formed a coalition government with the far-right Serbian Radical Party (SRS) and the Yugoslav Left (JUL), and Đurković served as a government supporter.\nSPS leader Slobodan Milošević fell from power in October 2000, and a new Serbian parliamentary election was held in December of that year. Đurković was not a candidate, and his term ended when the new assembly convened in early 2001. Online sources do not indicate his activities after this time.\n\n\n== References ==",

A fortress was built there, probably as early as the late 13th century. The fortress was gradually improved to become more of a castle, Lillöhus. In the war of 1657 - 1658 Denmark lost the province of Scania to Sweden and Lillöhus was demolished. It has remained a ruin ever since. The fields and wetlands surrounding the ruin are rich in bird life.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Easter is an unincorporated community in Castro County, Texas, United States. According to the Handbook of Texas, the community had an estimated population of 30 in 2000.\n\n\n== History ==\nWilliam Frank Easter, who made his home there in the early 1900s, is honored by the name. Originally constructed as a church and community center, it was later transferred and transformed into a private home. At the townsite, a cotton gin, a fertilizer store, and a grain elevator were constructed in the 1950s. The Easter Lion's Club was founded in 1965, and two miles west on Farm Road 1055, the club constructed a new community center in 1967. This initiative helped to revitalize the spirit of the town. Ever since, the yearly Easter \"Oprey\" and other noteworthy occasions have taken place there. There was a hamburger shop next to a grocery store that was near the gin. Hereford provided mail delivery services to the community. From 1984 to 1990, Easter had a population of 91, which went down to 30 in 2000.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nEaster is located on Farm to Market Road 2397, 2 mi (3.2 km) east of Farm to Market Road 1055 in northwestern Castro County.\n\n\n== Education ==\nWilliam Frank Easter gave the land for the construction of a one-room schoolhouse in 1901. This school restarted in 1915 after being dissolved in 1912. There were Sunday school lessons and church services held here. North of the original building, a new two-room school was constructed in 1919 and 1920 and later expanded. The Easter school system was combined with the Dimmitt Independent School District, located twenty miles southeast, after the building burned down in 1940.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Geonemertes rodericana, the Rodrigues terrestrial ribbon worm, is an extinct species of terrestrial nemertean. It was endemic to the island of Rodrigues, east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean.\n\n\n== Details ==\nG. rodericana was one to three inches long. Its body was dark green above with a narrow white streak down the middle, and a streak on each side. Its underbelly was white. Its head was a lighter green than the body, with four white spots on the front of the snout. Unlike its hermaphroditic relative Geonemertes pelaensis, G. rodericana was dioecious, with separate male and female sexes. This species lived in damp woods on rotten wood and under decaying leaves.\nG. rodericana was discovered in 1874, and last seen in 1918. During the 19th and 20th centuries, all forest habitat on Rodrigues was cleared for agriculture and development (though small areas have been replanted since then); this deforestation most likely caused the extinction of G. rodericana, and searches in 1993 failed to find the species.\n\n\n== References ==",

The trio credited their departure due to their desire to found a company with more \"creative opportunities\" and the ability to have \"actual ownership of the content\" made.\nThe company is majority-owned by the trio. They received funding from Neuro, a caffeinated energy gum company; Boba Guys, a bubble-milk tea chain; and Steve Chen, a YouTube co-founder.\nWatcher Entertainment gained its name from the infamous true crime case of The Westfield Watcher, from which Madej and Bergara had recently done a Buzzfeed Unsolved episode covering.\nThe trio began the company as co-CEOs, however, Bergara and Madej stepped down from the role in 2023 to focus on content creation.\n\n\n=== Watcher Entertainment (2020–present) ===\nWatcher Entertainment was launched in January 2020. The company debuted with seven series and a weekly interactive talk show; Homemade, Grocery Run, Weird Wonderful World, Puppet History, Tourist Trapped, Top 5 Beatdown, Spooky Small Talk, and Watcher Weekly. The channel reached over 300,000 subscribers within the first month of launching. They were signed by talent agency CAA in the same year.\nPuppet History, a comedy educational game show, quickly became a success and gained a significant audience. The show, which stars Madej as a fluffy blue puppet, has spanned five seasons and led to the creation of a variety of merchandise.\nThe company premiered its first horror series in July 2020 with Are You Scared?.\nFollowing the end of Buzzfeed Unsolved: Supernatural in 2021, the studio premiered its highly anticipated successor, Ghost Files, just months after. The show followed a similar format, with Bergara and Madej investigating reportedly haunted locations and attempting to find evidence of the paranormal. The show had significant success, with critics noting the improved production value and design from its predecessor.\nIn 2023, Bergara and Madej went on a tour across the United States to premiere episodes of the second season. The series was renewed for a third season, which they will be premiering with a United Kingdom tour in 2024.\nThat year, Watcher premiered a light-hearted successor to the graphic Buzzfeed Unsolved: True Crime, with Mystery Files. In this rendition, Bergara or Madej present unusual crime or supernatural mysteries with a collection of theoretical solutions. The show was met with great success by audiences and was quickly renewed for a second season.\nWatcher launched a second channel, WatcherPodcasts, in October 2023. The channel features podcasts hosted by Lim, Bergara, and Madej.\nOn April 19, 2024, the company launched its Watcher streaming service. Going forward, some content would be released exclusively on the service and the company plans to transition away from YouTube.\n\n\n== Channels and shows ==\n\n\n=== Watcher ===\n\n\n==== Current shows ====\nPuppet History (2020–present)\nA whimsical puppet host walks through history's wildest tales as two guests compete for the title of history wizard.\nMaking Watcher (2020–present)\nWhat happens when 3 creators with no business experience decide to make their own company?

        "content": "Silence is a free, open-source messaging encryption software, based on a fork from TextSecure software. It allows the secure exchange of SMS and MMS-type messages with other Silence or TextSecure users. The program allows message encryption and identity verification between correspondents by comparing the fingerprint of the encryption keys.\n\n\n== History ==\nTextSecure started as an application for sending and receiving encrypted SMS messages in 2015. However, its beta version was released in May 2010, by Whisper Systems, a startup co-founded by security researcher Moxie Marlinspike and roboticist Stuart Anderson.\nThe software was therefore published under a free and open-source license, under the terms of the GPLv3 in December 2011. Marlinspike left Twitter to create Open Whisper Systems as a collaborative open-source project, enabling the development of TextSecure.\nThe Open Whisper Systems institutional website was presented to the public in January 2013. The port of TextSecure to iOS started in March 2013.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Betsy-Tacy Houses are a pair of historic houses in Mankato, Minnesota that were the childhood homes of author Maud Hart Lovelace and her childhood friend, Frances Kenney. Lovelace used these houses as inspiration for the settings of her \"Betsy-Tacy\" book series. The houses are owned and operated together as a museum by the Betsy-Tacy Society.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe childhood homes of Maud Hart Lovelace (Betsy) and Frances Kenney (Tacy) in Mankato, Minnesota, are not only significant for being their residences but also for inspiring the beloved \"Betsy-Tacy\" book series. Both houses are located on Center Street located in the historic Lincoln Park neighborhood of Mankato, Minnesota and are within shouting distance of each other, reflecting the close proximity and friendship between Betsy and Tacy in the books.\n\n\n=== Betsy's House ===\nMaud Hart Lovelace's house located at 333 Center Street her home from 1892 to 1906. Now a museum run by the Betsy-Tacy Society they offer tours that recreate the atmosphere of Maud's childhood. There is a historical marker outside the house commemorating its significance.\n\n\n=== Tacy's House ===\nFrances Kenney's house located at 332 Center Street is directly across from Maud's house, this was her home from 1898 to 1911. Though not a museum itself, the house stands as a companion to Maud's house, and serves as an interpretive center and gift shop.\n\n\n== Restoration ==\nThe Society purchased and restored Frances Kenney's home in 1995 and Maud's home in 2001. Maud's home's restoration was featured on the PBS television program “Hometime.” Restorations to the homes aimed to recreate the look and feel of the houses during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They even used illustrations from the Betsy-Tacy books to guide the restoration, ensuring details matched the fictional descriptions. While some original items from Maud's family home are present, most furniture and decor are period-appropriate reproductions.\n\n\n== Literary Landmark ==\nOn May 20, 2010, Betsy's House, the childhood home of Maud Hart Lovelace, alongside Tacy's House, the childhood home of her best friend, Frances \"Bick\" Kenney was designated as a Literary Landmark by the Association of Library Trustees, Advocates, Friends and Foundations, a division of the American Library Association (ALA).\n\n\n== Betsy-Tacy Society ==\nThe Betsy-Tacy Society was founded in 1990 by a group of fans in Mankato, Minnesota. Their mission was to promote awareness of the books and preserve the local landmarks depicted by Maud Hart Lovelace.Concerned about the Betsy-Tacy series going out of print, to bring the books back the Society launched a letter-writing campaign successfully convincing HarperCollins to reprint the first four books by 1992. Their efforts ultimately led to all ten Betsy-Tacy books and three Deep Valley books being back in print and still available today.After their successful efforts getting the books back in print the Society purchased and restored the childhood homes of Maud Hart (Betsy) and her best friend, Frances Kenney (Tacy) and opened the homes as museums for fans to experience the real-life settings of the books. Currently the Betsy-Tacy Society has over 700 members and an annual Betsy-Tacy convention.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBetsy-Tacy (novel)\nBetsy-Tacy and Tib\nList of museums in Minnesota\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Karasu (Kazakh: Қарасу; Russian: Карасу) is a river in Karkaraly District, Karaganda Region, Kazakhstan. It is 57 kilometres (35 mi) long and has a basin of 661 km2 (255 sq mi).\nThe Karasu is one of the longest rivers flowing into endorheic lake Karasor. There are no settlements near its banks. The nearest inhabited place is Koyandy village, 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) to the southeast of the river's mouth. A bridge crosses the river 1.5 kilometres (0.93 mi) upstream from its mouth. \n\n\n== Course ==\nThe Karasu has its sources in the southern slopes of the highest part of the Zheltau Massif, central Kazakh Uplands, at the border of Pavlodar Region. It heads roughly southwards as a mountain river. In its middle course it bends westwards and in this last stretch it flows roughly parallel to the Taldy to the south. Finally it enters Karasor close to the northeastern corner of the lake.\nThe left bank of the Karasu river channel is steep. There are small salt lakes by the right bank of the middle reaches of its course. A few kilometers upstream of its mouth the channel becomes wide. The riverbanks in the lower basin are used for local livestock grazing. The Karasu is fed by snow and groundwater. Usually it is at its highest level in mid April, with the melting of the snows. The water in the channel usually flows all year round and freezes between early November and early to mid April. The river has 15 tributaries with a total length of 49 kilometres (30 mi). The longest is the 18 kilometres (11 mi) long Zhandar.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of rivers of Kazakhstan\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Karasu (Karasor) at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "I. H. Hawkins was a chain of department stores in California during the 1920s and 1930s owned by its namesake, Isaac Horace Hawkins.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nHawkins was born March 16, 1888, in Supply, Randolph County, Arkansas and died January 20, 1975, in Redondo Beach, California.\nHe moved west and worked in a dry goods store in Needles, California then opened his own store there. He then sold the store and bought another, this time in Redlands, now near the eastern edge of the Greater Los Angeles suburbs.\nHawkins operated \"The Hub\" at 120 N. Pacific Redondo Beach starting in 1923, closed it at some point (it is not among his stores listed in 1928) and reopened it in 1943.\nHawkins also operated the White House store during the 1920s at 126 N. Pacific.\nBy June 1928 Hawkins and partners operated:\n\n2 Hawkins & Co. stores in:\nRedondo Beach\nDinuba, Tulare Co.\n3 Hawkins Sample Stores in:\nCompton\nInglewood\nPorterville: 220 N. Main. Later the site of the Craven Department Store.\n3 Hawkins & Oberg Sample Stores in:\nRedondo Beach\nTorrance\nSan Pedro (July 2, 1928) 408 W. 6th St.\n1 store branded The Low Down, Inglewood\n4 additional locations that opened after June 1928 included:\n\nHanford (February 9, 1929 – May 13, 1933), 109 E. Seventh\nSanta Ana (April 15, 1931), 301–3 E. Fourth St. at Spurgeon. Jack Lansdowne was manager and part owner.\nAnaheim (October 1932), 124 W. Center, purchased Ormsby's, prior to that Falkenstein's Department Store.\nBakersfield, 2006 Chester Av., closed March 1933, taken over by Combs Dry Goods Co. (later Stovall's, Urners, Minnette's (1953), Sorority Shop, Pallets for Days). Premises damaged in 2020 fire.\nBy early 1933, Hawkins operated a total of 16 stores, but τhe 1933 Long Beach earthquake on March 10 of that year damaged stores in Compton, Santa Ana and elsewhere in Southern California. By 1933, 8 of the 16 locations had closed.\nBy 1941 he had sold all of the stores except the one in Redondo Beach on North Pacific Avenue. As mentioned above, he reopened The Hub store in Redondo Beach in 1943. Hawkins served as mayor of that city shortly thereafter. He served as a delegate to the 1952 Democratic National Convention.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Hermanus \"Manus\" van Diermen (Baarn, 26 September 1895 – 14 October 1946) was a Dutch football player.\nHe played with VV Baarn, Blauw-Wit Amsterdam and the Dutch national team. His nickname was \"Het Kanon\" ('the canon'). \n\n\n== Biography ==\nVan Diermen was born in 1895 as the son of Gerardus van Diermen and Geertruida van Rouwendaal. He married to Johanna Maria Dijs.\nVan Diermen became the first ever international footballer for Blauw-Wit in 1920. He made this debut on 5 April 1920 in Amsterdam against Denmark in the match that was won. He had good technical movements, a very good overview and especially great left sided shots. In total Manus played five matches for the national team between 1920 and 1921. In September 1920 it was announced he would possibly move from Blauw-Wit to De Spartaan, but as of December 1922 he stil played with Blauw-Wit. A knee injury plagued him and in 1923 he had to retire as a football player. Van Diermen played a total of 128 matches with Blauw-Wit. He received numerous offers to become a trainer and signed a contract with B.V.C. (Bussum).\nOn 14 October 1946, Van Diermen died at the age of 51 in Baarn. In newspaper Algemeen Dagblad of 15 October 1946, he was mentioned as a: “by chance forgotten footballer”. On 18 October 1946 he was buried at the de Nieuwe Algemene Begraafplaats in Baarn. The financial situation of his family was so bad that on 31 oktober 1946, the newspaper 'Het Volk' appealed to football friends to help Van Diermen's family. Ultimately, a \"Fonds Van Diermen\" ('Van Diermen relief fund') was founded.\nIn 1948 the “Van Diermen veteran tournament” was held in memory of him.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Evan Roden is a campaigner for legislative changes in organ donation laws in New York, advocating for mandatory organ-donation education, increased benefits for living organ donors, and implementing a presumed consent system. Roden founded the organization Youth Coalition for Organ Donation (YCOD) in 2017.\n\n\n== Background ==\nWhile in high school, Evan Roden contributed to drafting and advocating for legislation promoting a presumed consent system of organ donation, which was introduced in 2019 by Assembly member David DiPietro. Roden has addressed potential concerns about informed consent in the organ-donation process.In 2017, Roden co-founded the Youth Coalition for Organ Donation (YCOD), which campaigned for an “opt-out” organ donation system in New York that would be similar to those in several European nations and Nova Scotia, Canada. In 2019, YCOD presented an initial proposal, which did not become law. In 2022, YCOD, in partnership with Waitlist Zero, achieved legislative success with the Living Donor Support Law in New York State.Roden also campaigns using platforms to raise awareness about the importance of organ donation and encourages youth participation in political advocacy. His efforts have been locally and nationally recognized. In 2021, Tulane University invited Roden to present at their TEDx program, speaking on youth political advocacy and his own experience with YCOD.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nRoden received the Real Heroes Award from the American Red Cross in 2022, in partnership with former Erie County Executive Joel Giambra, who had recently received a donor from a constituent in the community.In 2023, Loyola University of New Orleans invited Roden to join a team of students in submitting a redesign of the neighborhood New Orleans East and placed among winners. The Mayor of New Orleans invited Roden to present the group's design plan. Roden joined the Organ Donor Awareness Corporation's series of fireside chats in 2023.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Ultraviolet Explorer (UVEX) is an upcoming wide-field ultraviolet space telescope from NASA scheduled to launch in 2030. UVEX will build off of previous ultraviolet space telescopes, specifically GALEX, conducting surveys of the entire sky in both near- and far-ultraviolet light. UVEX will study the evolution of low-metallicity stars and how they affect the evolution of low-metallicity and low-mass galaxies. The probe can also be used for quick-turnaround observation of cosmic events, such as merging stars. UVEX's data will be able to complement other all-sky survey programs in different wavelengths of light, notably those by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, the Roman Space Telescope, and the Euclid telescope. Compared to earlier ultraviolet space telescopes, UVEX will feature more capable instrumentation and a larger mirror, enabling it to obtain higher-resolution data and observe fainter objects.\n\n\n== Spacecraft ==\n\n\n=== Science payload ===\nUVEX will contain one instrument, consisting of the UV-optimized optical telescope array (OTA) and the UV Instrument Module (UVIM). The OTA consists of a 75 cm (30 in)-diameter primary mirror in a three-mirror anastigmat configuration which will capture and redirect light to three different sensors. \n\nTwo of these belong to the imager, with one featuring coatings to only accept near-ultraviolet (NUV) light, with its counterpart accepting only far-ultraviolet (FUV) light. Both sensors, each consisting of nine 4k x 4k CMOS detectors arranged in a 3 x 3 pattern, are identical apart from their coatings and will receive light from a dichroic, which splits the light beam from the OTA to send each sensor its corresponding wavelengths of light. The dichroic allows both sensor assemblies to image simultaneously. Due to the low focal ratio of the OTA and the large sensors, the imager can capture 3.5° x 3.5° images of the sky at once.\nThe third sensor, a single 4k x 4k detector, belongs to the long-slit spectrograph. Light from the OTA would reach the detector by bypassing the dichroic and passing through the slit and grating. The spectrograph has a length of 2° and can achieve a maximum resolving power of roughly R = 3500.\n\n\n=== Spacecraft bus ===\n\n\n== Mission ==\nUVEX is classified as a Medium-Class Explorer (MIDEX) in NASA's Explorers Program and is planned to launch in 2030. After a period of orbit corrections and instrument commissioning, the probe will begin a two-year series of full-sky surveys. Because of its larger primary mirror, which can capture more light at once than the smaller mirrors of its predecessors, UVEX will observe dimmer and further objects. The probe will reach AB magnitudes greater than 25.8, comparable to the ground-based Vera C. Rubin Observatory. UVEX will also perform weekly surveys of the Magellanic Clouds, something its predecessors struggled with because of their brightness.\nUVEX's science goals are divided into three \"pillars:\"\n\nStudy low-metallicity stars and their effects on the evolution of their host galaxies. Low-metallicity low-mass galaxies make up about half of the universe's mass, and they are believed to be very similar to the first galaxies that formed. Studying these objects can give insight into how the first stars and galaxies formed just after the Big Bang\nStudy ongoing and new events in the universe with time-domain surveys, allowing quick follow-up to sudden events like stellar mergers. This will provide additional data to ongoing studies of gravitational waves.\nCreate a dataset of ultraviolet all-sky surveys for use by current and future scientists, complementing similar surveys by telescopes in other wavelengths of light (primarily infrared and visible light)\n\n\n=== Orbit ===\nUVEX will operate in a highly elliptical lunar resonance orbit called P/2. This type of orbit is currently in use by the TESS spacecraft, which is also performing whole-sky surveys, although TESS is primarily searching for exoplanets. The P/2 orbit is in a 2:1 resonance with the Moon, meaning that the spacecraft completes two orbits of Earth for every one orbit of the Moon. Because of this resonance, which enables occasional gravitational interactions with the Moon, the orbit is extremely stable. In addition, the orbit avoids the Van Allen belts entirely, drastically reducing wear on spacecraft components. Because of its high altitude and eccentricity, UVEX will take 13.7 days to complete one orbit.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nExplorer program – Ongoing United States space exploration programPages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets\nUltraviolet astronomy\nGALEX – NASA UV space telescope of the Explorer program, operated 2003-2013\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "John Moore Neligan (1815 – 24 July 1863) was an Irish physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nNeligan was the son of a medical practitioner, was born at Clonmel, County Tipperary, in 1815. He graduated M.D. at Edinburgh in 1836, and began practice in his birthplace. Thence he moved to Cork, where he lectured on materia medica and medical botany in a private school of anatomy, medicine, and surgery in Warren's Place. In 1840 he took a house in Dublin, and in 1841 was appointed physician to the Jervis Street Hospital. He also gave lectures on materia medica from 1841 to 1846, and on medicine from 1846 to 1857, in the Dublin school of Peter Street. He published in 1844 ‘Medicines, their Uses and Mode of Administration,’ which gives an account of all the drugs mentioned in the London, Scottish, and Irish pharmacopœias, and of some others. Their sources, medicinal actions, doses, and most useful compounds are clearly stated; and the compilation, though containing no original matter, was useful to medical practitioners, and went through many editions. He enjoyed the friendship of Robert James Graves, the famous lecturer on medicine, and in 1848 edited the second edition of his ‘Clinical Lectures on the Practice of Medicine.’ In the same year he published ‘The Diagnosis and Treatment of Eruptive Diseases of the Scalp,’ which was printed at the Dublin University Press. He describes as inflammatory diseases herpes, eczema, impetigo, and pityriasis, and as non-inflammatory porrigo, and gives a lucid statement of their characteristics in tabular form; but he was ignorant of the parasitic nature of herpes capitis, as he calls ringworm, and seems not to have noticed the frequent relation between eczema of the occiput and animal parasites. From 1849 to 1861 he edited the ‘Dublin Quarterly Journal of Medical Science,’ and published many medical papers of his own in it. In 1852 he published ‘A Practical Treatise on Diseases of the Skin,’ and, like most men who attain notoriety as dermatologists, issued in 1855 a coloured ‘Atlas of Skin Diseases.’ His treatise is a compilation from standard authors, with a very small addition from his own experience. The subject is well arranged, and so set forth as to be useful to practitioners. It was much read, and led to his treating many patients with cutaneous affections. His house in Dublin was 17 Merrion Square East. He married in 1839 Kate Gumbleton, but had no children, and died on 24 July 1863.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Moore, Norman (1894). \"Neligan, John Moore\".

        "content": "John Northleigh (1657 – 17 January 1704) was an English physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nNorthleigh born at Hamburg in 1657, was son of John Northleigh, merchant, of Exminster, Devonshire. Another account makes him born at Cadeleigh, Devonshire. He matriculated as a sojourner from Exeter College, Oxford, on 23 March 1674–5, aged 17, and in 1681 graduated B.C.L. In 1682 he became a student of the Middle Temple, and was in the same year incorporated LL.B. at Magdalene College, Cambridge (Foster, Alumni Oxon. 1500–1714, iii. 1078). He was subsequently chosen fellow of King's College, Cambridge, proceeded LL.D. in 1687, and eventually became M.D. In May 1688 he was an unsuccessful candidate for a fellowship at All Souls' College, Oxford. He was an adherent of James II, and wrote ably in his defence. For many years he practised at Exeter, but apparently devoted more attention to polemical theology than to his profession. He was an ardent supporter of the church of England, and distinguished himself by various writings against the independents and presbyterians. He died on the 17th and was buried in Exeter Cathedral on 24 January 1704–5, leaving by his wife Frances (d. 1715) a son John (1701–1726). A monument to their memory was placed on the south side of the lady-chapel in Exeter Cathedral.\nNorthleigh wrote:\n\n‘Exercitationes Philologicæ tres: prima Infanticidium, poema credulam exprimens matrem … prolem suam interfecisse. Secunda Spes extatica … Tertia Philosophia vindicata,’ &c., 4to, Oxford, 1681.\n‘The Parallel, or the new specious Association an old rebellious Covenant; closing with a disparity between a true Patriot and a factious Associator’ [anon.], folio, London, 1682, highly commended by Dr. Laurence Womack in his ‘Letter containing a farther Justification of the Church of England against the Dissenters,’ 1682 (p. 59).\n‘A Genteel Reflection on the Modest Account [by Lord Shaftesbury], and a Vindication of the Loyal Abhorrers from the calumnies of a factious pen,’ folio, London, 1682.\n‘The Triumph of our Monarchy over the Plots and Principles of our Rebels and Republicans, being Remarks on their most Eminent Libels,’ 8vo, London, 1685.\n‘Parliamentum Pacificum, or the Happy Union of King and People in an healing Parliament,’ 4to, London, March 1688. This ingenious, smartly written defence of James II elicited three answers in Dutch, besides being translated into French and Dutch. Gilbert Burnet, afterwards bishop of Salisbury, who had been assailed in it on account of his letter addressed from the Hague to Lord Middleton on 3 May 1687, replied in a ‘Vindication of himself,’ whereupon Northleigh rejoined with\n‘Dr. Burnet's Reflections upon a Book, entituled “Parliamentum Pacificum” ... answered,’ 4to, London, July 1688.\n‘Topographical Descriptions, with Historico-Political and Medico-Physical Observations made in two several Voyages through most parts of Europe,’ 8vo, London, 1702 (reprinted in vol. ii. of J. Harris's ‘Bibliotheca,’ edits. 1705 and 1744). A second volume was to have contained Italy, and a third Germany, Hungary, Denmark, and Sweden, but only the first volume, containing the Netherlands, France, Savoy, and Piedmont, appeared. There is no indication of the periods at which the tours were made.\nTwo letters from Northleigh to Archbishop Sancroft, dated respectively 2 June 1688 and January 1692–3, are among the Tanner MSS. in the Bodleian Library (xxviii. 92 and xxv. 420). A copy of the second letter is in Rawlinson MS. C. 739, f. 138.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Goodwin, Gordon (1895). \"Northleigh, John\". In Lee, Sidney (ed.).

        "content": "William Northcote (died 1783?) was a British naval surgeon.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nNorthcote passed on 20 October 1757 an examination for naval surgeons at the Surgeons' Company in London, and was declared to be fit to act as `second mate to a fourth rate.' On 18 October 1759 his name again appears as having been examined and ‘found fit to act as first mate to a first rate.’ He never became a member of the company, but on 8 February 1771 he was certified by the Surgeons' Company to be ‘qualified to act as surgeon to a first rate.’ His first warrant is dated 11 February 1771, and he is said to have served in the Dublin. His professional works, compiled for the guidance of naval surgeons, show that he was engaged on active service in all parts of the world, and he professed to be specially conversant with the treatment of diseases occurring in tropical countries. He is marked as dead in the admiralty list for 1783.\nNorthcote's writings are of little medical interest, as he does not cite cases, and rarely describes any of his own methods of treatment. Their titles are: \n\n‘The Marine Practice of Physic and Surgery,’ in two vols. London, 1770. This is Northcote's chief work; and it exhibits, in the rare instances of allusion to his personal experiences, descriptive powers of a high order. The preface is dated from Cornwall 12 June 1769. The most interesting part of the work is an appendix containing ‘Some brief Directions to be observed by the Sea Surgeon previous to and in an Engagement,’ in which the author related in a most graphic manner the difficulties attending the practice of his art at sea when the ship was under fire.\n‘The Anatomy of the Human Body, for the Use of Naval Practitioners,’ London, 1772.\n‘A Concise History of Anatomy,’ London, 1772. * ‘Methodus Prescribendi,’ London, 1772—a copy of the pharmacopœias of the London, Edinburgh, Paris, and St. Petersburg Hospitals, with the formulæ in use in the English and Russian fleets, and in the British army.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Power, D'Arcy (1895). \"Northcote, William\".

        "content": "View 34 (formerly known as Rivergate) is a 35-story apartment building in the Murray Hill neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City. Occupying the full block bounded by First Avenue, FDR Drive, East 34th Street and East 35th Street, the high-rise was constructed on the former site of a Coca-Cola bottling plant and sparked the redevelopment of the eastern part of Murray Hill from industrial to residential uses beginning in the 1980s.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1978, developer Donald Zucker entered into an agreement with the Coca-Cola Bottling Company of New York, Inc. to purchase its bottling plant located at 425 East 34th Street for $6 million and redevelop the site with a high-rise containing 800 residential units. He retained architect Paul Rudolph to design a residential and commercial rental property on the site. Although the building would require a change in zoning from manufacturing to residential use, Zucker had hoped to begin construction on the project in the spring of 1980. However, the sale of the bottling plant would not occur until July 1980 because of delays associated with Coca-Cola getting a clear title to the property; a covenant in the land deeded from the city in 1847 required the title holder to maintain the streets around the property. On February 21, 1980, the New York City Board of Estimate voted to grant a waiver to Coca-Cola from the provision with a payment of $175,000 for back street repairs under the condition that the company relocate to a former Canada Dry plant in Maspeth, Queens, keeping the jobs in the city.\nZucker originally planned to construct a 42-story residential tower on the block, and allocated part of the site for a playground to appease the local community and to obtain a zoning bonus allowing for additional floor area from privately owned public space. An environmental impact statement for the proposed project was completed in May 1981. The project was initially opposed by Manhattan Community Board 6 and the New York City Planning Commission, which questioned if the building's proposed density would fit in adjacent to an interchange on the FDR Drive and the Kips Bay Generating Station, but negotiations led to the developer agreeing to reduce the size of the project by 20 percent and modify the design of the structure facing the East River. A park was also included on the First Avenue side of the building to upgrade public space in Community District 6, which had the least amount of parks compared to other community districts in the borough.\nA groundbreaking ceremony was held on March 7, 1983, and attended by several city officials including Mayor Ed Koch, Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin and Borough President Andrew Stein. Originally named Rivergate, the $30 million project was designed by Samuel Braverman and Costas Kondylis of Philip Birnbaum & Associates and planned to include 700 rental units consisting of one- and two-bedroom apartments. The building was completed at the beginning of 1985. By March of that year, one hundred tenants had moved in and another hundred had signed leases. The Rivergate project sparked the redevelopment of the eastern part of Murray Hill from industrial to residential uses; after the site's zoning was changed from manufacturing to residential, the City Planning Commission rezoned other sites in the area to allow for high-density residential development.\nThe original design for the 23,700-square-foot (2,200 m2) public plaza on the west side of the site was made by Thomas Balsley Associates. A unique feature of the plaza was a 102-by-52-foot (31 m × 16 m) ice skating rink. Rivergate Ice Rink opened in December 1985 and was the first outdoor rink to be constructed in Manhattan since 1966 when Lasker Rink opened in Central Park. The northern side of the plaza included a basketball court and a children's playground. The ice rink was subsequently removed in 1996 in a redesign of the plaza by Landgarden Landscape Architects and converted into a passive recreation area with a lawn surrounded by a brick track with trees and shrubs around the perimeter.\nIn July 2011, Rivergate was sold by the Zucker Organization to UDR, Inc. for $443 million. The new owner began renovating the apartment complex the following year and subsequently changed the name of the building to View 34. As part of the building renovations, the total number of residential units was increased from 706 to 740 by internal subdivisions of one-bedroom apartments into studio apartments. In 2014, the building owner filed an application to construct a 4,000-square-foot (370 m2) retail building at the northwest corner of the public plaza. As originally constructed, the size of the plaza had exceeded its required area, which allowed some of the public space to be converted to private use. The proposed plans also involved modifications to other parts of the plaza, including the addition of a dog run, a turf area on a platform and additional seating areas. Discussions with the City Planning Commission and Community Board 6 led the developer to decrease the footprint of the new retail area to reduce the loss of public open space. The new retail building and public plaza were designed by MuCh Architecture in collaboration with SiteWorks and include a 3,000-square-foot (280 m2) restaurant, outdoor seating areas with an elevated turf lawn, a children's playground, a basketball court and a 5-by-3-by-6-foot (155 cm × 100 cm × 180 cm) mirror polished stainless steel sculpture by David Fried titled Stemmer.\n\n\n== Design ==\nThe building forms a U-shape with a narrow courtyard facing the East River and has a step design with three deep setbacks on the east side of the structure that form roof terraces for some of the apartments facing the river. It has a 6,000-square-foot (560 m2), three-story glass atrium lobby with an indoor garden, waterfalls and a 32-by-8-foot (9.8 m × 2.4 m) painting by Frank Stella titled Damascus Gate Variation I. Other building amenities include a health club and roof deck. The windows of apartments in the building contain insulated glazing to reduce interior noise given the building's location adjacent to the FDR Drive and near the East 34th Street Heliport.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Red Pepper is a musical in two acts with music by Albert Gumble and Owen Murphy, lyrics by Howard Emmett Rogers, and a book by Edgar Smith and Emily Young. Staged on Broadway in 1922 after a premiere in Baltimore in 1921, the musical was created for the comedy duo of McIntyre and Heath, who were famous for their performances in blackface. \nSet at a racetrack in Havana, Cuba, and in the Southern United States, Red Pepper takes its title from a race horse who is featured in the musical's storyline. It was one of the earliest musicals to use a musical score rooted in jazz, marking a shift away from operetta and ragtime which had dominated the musical theatre landscape previously in the 1910s and into the early 1920s.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nAt a racetrack in Havana, Cuba, Juniper Berry and Jimpson Weed conspire to get rich quick by influencing the outcome of an impending horse race. They bet against the favored winner, the thoroughbred horse Red Pepper, with the intent of drugging the horse to prevent it from winning the race. Their plans get sidetracked and several side adventures occur. The pair follow the horse to Arizona and then Georgia in the hopes of successfully implementing their scheme. \n\n\n== History ==\n\nTheatre scholars John Bush Jones and Nathan Hurwitz describe Red Pepper as a \"leisure-time musical\", a type of musical common in the 1920s which set its story in the world of sports and leisure-time activities familiar to American audiences of the period. In this case, the musical's first act was set at a racetrack in Havana, and the choice to place the musical in this context was partially due to the recent popularity of Man o' War, a thoroughbred race horse, who had captured the American consciousness in the 1920s.\nProducers Lee and Jacob J. Shubert oversaw the creation of Red Pepper as a starring vehicle for the comedy duo of McIntyre and Heath. As with their previous musicals, such as The Ham Tree and In Hayti, Red Pepper was crafted around their blackface tramp personas that they originally created in minstrel shows in the late 19th century and had then transferred into the mediums of vaudeville and the Broadway musical. Thomas Kurton Heath portrayed Jimpson Weed, a \"Colored Gentleman of Misfortune\", and James McIntyre performed the role of Juniper Berry, a \"Get-Rich-Quick Wallingford of the Colored Race\"; a pair of tramps who scheme together to get rich quick off the racehorse \"Red Pepper\".\nDirected by Frank Smithson,  Red Pepper premiered in Baltimore on November 28, 1921 at the Auditorium Theatre. The production then went on tour, arriving at Broadway's Shubert Theatre on May 29, 1922. It ran there for just 24 performances, closing on June 17, 1922. Despite its relatively short run in New York, the work had a long life as a touring show at theaters nationally, and was financially profitable for its producers.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nCritics of Red Pepper were largely critical of the plot, which lacked a focused storyline and had a loose structure which was targeted at featuring the wide variety of talents among its cast. The New York Evening World said \"the plot was terrible\" but hailed the show as \"a novelty\" for its combination of the aesthetics of a Wild West show and a minstrel show. Likewise, The Brooklyn Daily Eagle described the musical as a \"hybrid concoction\" of \"burlesque, vaudeville, circus, Cheyenne roundup, Winter Garden extravaganza, and high grade cabaret\".\nRed Pepper was written at a time when jazz was beginning to change the music composition aesthetic of the Broadway musical; a change which caught at least one critic by surprise. This sudden shift in musical tastes was reflected in the review of Gumble and Murphy's jazz rooted score in the New York Post whose critic wrote, \"There's nothing in the piece that is real music. Jazz, yes. Any amount of it, but jazz isn't music. Not by a long shot.\"\n\nAs forward thinking as the musical score was for its period, the comedic writing was less so. The New York Times critic wrote, \"To comment on the work of the well known pair who head the cast, [Mcyntire & Heath], is superfluous. They get the laughs with the lines they have – they would get more laughs with better lines. Some of their jokes – well, they really should give that one about the whole shirt on the back a bonus and let it retire. And while they are about it they might provide for some more veterans. Why don't they form an old-jokes home and make them all comfortable?\"\nDespite this negative criticism, Heywood Broun was much more complimentary of McIntyre & Heath's comedy in his review in the New York World, who found the pair \"funnier than ever\". Likewise, The Brooklyn Daily Eagle review described the pair as \"two bright ebony spots in the long and variegated performance.\" \nThe New York Times review gave high praise to the performance of actress Mabel Elaine in the blackface role of Lilly Rose, particularly citing the strength and appeal of her singing and dancing in the songs \"Bugaboo\" and \"Strut Your Stuff\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nBloom, Ken (1996). \"Red Pepper\".

        "content": "John Mackie (1748 – 29 January 1831) was a  Scottish physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMackie was the eldest of a family of fifteen children, was born in 1748 at Dunfermline Abbey in Fifeshire. In 1763 he commenced his medical studies at Edinburgh and on leaving the university he settled at Huntingdon. About 1792 he removed to Southampton, and there practised with great success till 1814, when he left for a ten years' tour on the continent, where he only practised his profession occasionally, but numbered among his patients the queen of Spain, the ex-king of Holland, and other persons of rank. In 1819 he printed anonymously at Vevay for private distribution a 'Sketch of a New Theory of Man,' which was translated into French, and reprinted in English at Bath, 1822. On his return to England, after passing several winters at Bath, he removed to Chichester, where he died 29 January 1831 at the age of eighty-three. He married in 1784 the daughter of a French clergyman, who translated into English the 'Letters of Madame de Sévigné,' published in London, 12 mo, 8 vols. 1802. She died at Vevay in 1819, leaving one son and one daughter. Mackie was a religious man and an attached member of the church of England, notwithstanding his Scottish parentage and education. He was most liberal to his patients, and at Southampton showed great kindness to numerous French emigrants. He was fond of reading, and was very popular in society. Miss L. M. Hawkins, in her 'Memoirs, Anecdotes,' &c. (i. 310), calls him a most agreeable conversationist. A fine portrait of him was painted in miniature by George Engleheart in 1784 (the date of his marriage); another by Marchmont Moore in 1830 was engraved by Samuel Freeman in the same year, and a drawing in water-colours was executed by Slater in 1808.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Greenhill, William Alexander (1893). \"Mackie, John (1748-1831)\".

        "content": "Luis Saura del Pan (8 June 1890 – 18 March 1980) was a Spanish footballer who played as a forward for Athletic Bilbao and Madrid FC. He served as both the 10th president of the Spanish Football Federation between 1940 and 1941, and the 12th president of the National Committee of Referees from 1951 to 1952.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\n\n\n=== Early career ===\nLuis Saura del Pan was born in Madrid as the son of Pedro Saura y Coronas (1851–1943), a doctor, and Luisa del Pan. He developed a deep interest for football from a young age and became a Real Madrid member in 1905, at the age of 15. However, it was with Athletic Bilbao that he began his football career in 1908, scoring once in the only Copa del Rey match that he played for the club, a 2–4 loss to Club Ciclista in the quarterfinals of the edition.\nSaura del Pan then joined Real Sociedad, which participated in the 1910 Copa del Rey under the umbrella of local club Vasconia Sporting Club (since the club was not a year old as the tournament statutes required), and in his first season with the club, Saura del Pan helped the club reach the final, which ended in a 0–1 loss to his former club, Athletic Bilbao, courtesy of a goal from Remigio Iza.\n\n\n=== Madrid FC ===\nSaura del Pan stayed at Madrid FC for five seasons between 1912 and 1917. In his first season in 1912–13, he played only one cup match, starting as a forward in the semifinals against his former club Athletic Bilbao, which ended in another loss, this time by 0–3. In the following season, he scored twice in four matches in the regional championship, and after a two-year hiatus, he returned for the 1916–17 season, playing four cup matches and scoring once, in a 1–3 loss to FC Espanya in the second leg of the semifinals. Saura did not play the subsequent replay, which ended in a 2–2 draw, but then played in the second replay, helping his side to a 1–0 victory, thus reaching the 1917 cup final against Arenas Club. Despite forming an attacking partnership with René Petit and Sotero Aranguren, the match ended in a goalless draw, and he was then not called up for the replay which Madrid won 2–1.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nDuring the years of the Second Spanish Republic (1931–39), Saura del Pan was a military doctor, national category referee, and secretary of the National Committee of Referees.\nIn 1940, Saura del Pan was appointed as the 10th president of the Spanish Football Federation (replacing Julián Troncoso), a position that he held for one year until 1941, when he was replaced by Javier Barroso.\nIn 1951, the 61-year-old Saura del Pan was appointed as the 12th president of the National Committee of Referees, replacing Pedro Escartín. By the time he reached this position, he had been registered as a Real Madrid member for almost 50 years, since 1905. He held the presidency for one year until 1952, when he was replaced by Arturo Espinosa.\n\n\n== Death ==\nSaura del Pan died in Valencia on 18 March 1980, at the age of 89.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nReal Sociedad\n\nCopa del Rey:\nrunner-up 1910\nReal Madrid\n\nCopa del Rey:\nWinners: 1917\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Charles Maclean (fl. 1788–1824) was a British medical and political writer\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMaclean was educated as a physician, and early entered the service of the East India Company. In 1788 he was surgeon of the William Pitt, and afterwards of the Northumberland and of the Houghton, all East Indiamen, and in this capacity visited Jamaica and made several voyages to India. About 1792 he settled in Bengal, where he had charge of a hospital, apparently at Calcutta, He also served before 1798 as medical officer to troops in Batavia and at Bencoolen. His travels gave him exceptional facilities for the study of fevers, and in 1796 he published the results in a 'Dissertation on the Source of Epidemic Diseases/ Calcutta, 8vo. In the spring of 1798 he made in an Indian newspaper an insinuation 'against a magistrate, which the government resented, and Maclean was ordered by Wellesley to leave India. After some resistance he submitted, and was conveyed to Europe in the Mildred. An intention to visit Spain in 1800 in order to study the fevers prevalent there was frustrated by the war. In 1801 he was at Hamburg, and on the conclusion of peace he proceeded to Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and Paris to advocate an international institution at Constantinople for the study and treatment of the plague (Alger, Englishmen in the French Revolution, p. 265). He was one of the prisoners forcibly detained by Napoleon in 1803, but was allowed to leave Bordeaux 13 December 1803, on proving that he had not visited England for ten years.\nIn April 1804 Maclean applied for a post on the hospital staff for the British army, and was placed in the York Hospital, Chelsea, where he remained till 15 January 1806, when he was ordered to Chelmsford. His theory that epidemics were not contagious does not seem to have inspired the authorities with much confidence in him, and delay in promotion led him to send in his resignation, which was not accepted. After an unsuccessful application for a post on Sir James Craig's Mediterranean expedition, Maclean left the service, and his name appeared in the 'Hue and Cry' as a deserter. No further steps were taken against him, but he became a bitter opponent of the government. In 1806 he virulently attacked the Marquis of Wellesley in a series of letters, entitled 'The Affairs of Asia considered in their Effects on the Liberties of Britain,' which soon reached a second edition. He was supported in the House of Commons by his friend James Paull. In 1809 Maclean applied for a post on the Walcheren expedition, naturally without success. Soon after he became lecturer on the diseases of hot climates to the East India Company, and championed the company's cause against the proposals of the government to throw open the trade to India in 'A View of the Consequences of laying open the Trade to India,' 1810. From 1815 to 1817 he travelled in Spain, Turkey, and the Levant, and studied the plague at the Greek Pest Hospital at Constantinople, in the service of the Levant Company. He endeavoured to prove the futility of the quarantine laws, but the government and the College of Physicians, which Maclean charged with a 'flagrant abandonment of public duty,' refused to adopt his recommendations or repay his expenses. In 1818 Maclean resumed his lectures in England, and projected a series of volumes entitled 'The Archives of Health,' which never appeared. In 1820, in 'Specimens of Misrule,' he attacked the holy alliance and tory government of England. In 1824 he delivered a lecture at Liverpool on the quarantine laws, which was subsequently published. His death probably occurred soon after.\nMaclean's chief works, besides those already mentioned, are:\n\n'An Excursion into France,' &c, 1804, 8vo.\n'Analytical View of the Medical Department of the British Army,' 1810, 8vo.\n'Evils of Quarantine Laws,' 1818, 8vo.\n'Practical Illustrations of the Progress of Medical Advancement during the last Thirty Years,' 1818, 8vo.\nHe was also the author of several pamphlets.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Pollard, Albert Frederick (1893). \"Maclean, Charles\".

        "content": "James Mackenzie (1680? – 7 August 1761) was a Scottish physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMackenzie was born about 1680. He was educated at Edinburgh University, was entered at the university of Leyden 15 March 1700 (Leyden Students, p. 64), and was subsequently elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians at Edinburgh. He practised for many years in Worcester 'with nigh reputation and success,' and he gained many learned and influential friends, including L. M. da Costa [q. v.] and Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. In 1745 he was consulted, together with Philip Doddrige by Isaac Maddox, then bishop of Worcester, respecting the foundation of Worcester Infirmary, and he was attending physician at that institution from its establishment until his retirement from practice in 1751, when he settled in Kidderminster. The bishop wrote him an affectionate letter as a stimulus 'to usefulness, even in retirement,' and in 1758 he responded by producing 'The History of Health and the Art of Preserving it,' Edinburgh, 8vo, dedicated to the bishop, commencing with a succinct account of man's food before the fall, and containing summaries of the general rules of health laid down by eminent physicians from Moses onwards. There are some curious notes on British writers on health, including Sir Thomas Elyot, Thomas Morgan (CoganP), Edmund Hollyngs, William Vaughan, Thomas Venner, Edward Maynwaring, Robert Phayre, William Bullein, and lastly, John Arbuthnot and Richard Mead. A third edition appeared also at Edinburgh in 1760, bearing fruits of Mackenzie's friendship with the Wortley Montagus in the shape of an appendix, containing 'A Short and Clear Account of the Commencement, Progress, Utility, and Proper Management of Inoculating the Small Pox as a valuable branch of Prophylaxis.' A French translation had appeared at the Hague in 1759. Mackenzie also wrote 'Essays and Meditations on Various Subjects,' a pious volume published posthumously at Edinburgh in 1762, and he contributed 'History of a Complete Luxation of the Thigh' to 'Essays and Observations, Physical and Literary' (1756, ii. 817). Mackenzie died at Sutton Coldfield, Warwickshire, on 7 August 1761.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Seccombe, Thomas (1893). \"Mackenzie, James (1680?-1761)\".

Competing in the light middleweight division, he was the international champion and European champion of the IBF.\n\n\n== Professional career ==\nIn 2011, Nimani turned pro and fought his first professional fight on 12 February against Thomas Freitag. Nimani was able to win the fight by knockout after just 58 seconds. He also won the following six fights by knockout. On 15 October, he was allowed to fight for the International German Championship against Hervé Mbongo-Starr. He won the fight in the Velten Ofen-Stadt-Halle - and thus his first professional title - on points after 10 rounds. On 18 November 2012, Nimani qualified for the IBF European Light Middleweight Championship after successfully fighting four fights in just under seven months. He defeated Sandor Micsko with a seventh-round knockout and won his first international title. Nimani achieved his greatest success on 31 May 2014 in Bielefeld when he brought Mike Miranda to his knees in the first round and thus became the new IBF International title holder. Nimani lost on 11 April 2015 against the French Frank Horche Horta by technical knockout in round 4. This fight was followed by longer breaks due to injuries. After a year-long break, Nimani celebrated his comeback in March 2019 with a win against Teemu Tuominen. He fought his last bout on 14 December 2019 in Hamelin against Adnan Zilic.\n\n\n== Personal life and death ==\nNimani had been in the headlines several times during his boxing career. In December 2012, he was sentenced to a fine for assault. During a violent confrontation in downtown Bielefeld the following year, he was hit by two gunshots. In 2016, he was arrested for domestic violence against his wife, but was released after a short time. On 9 March 2024, Nimani was killed with several shots while leaving a hairdressing salon in downtown Bielefeld. He was 38.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sheikh Ma'ruf Cemetery (Arabic: مقبرة الشيخ معروف), also known as Maqbarat Shuniziyyah, is a historic cemetery located in the neighborhood of Karkh in Baghdad, Iraq. The cemetery's name is derived from Ma'ruf Karkhi, a Sufi mystic who is buried in here. Several historic mausoleums are present in the cemetery, such as the Zumurrud Khatun Mosque and Mausoleum.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n\n=== Sheikh Ma'ruf Mosque ===\nThe Sheikh Ma'ruf Mosque was built around the grave of the renowned ascetic Ma'ruf Karkhi between the years 1215 to 1216. In 1225, the Abbasid Caliph Al-Nasir renovated the mosque. In the Ottoman era, the mosque was restored and refurbished twice, first by the governor Ahmed Pasha and later on Ahmed Pasha. In 2001, the mosque was fully reconstructed in a modern, futurist style, which also doubled the area of the mosque and replaced the old minaret with a new one.\nThe mosque has a large prayer hall. A room at the end of the prayer hall contains the tomb of Ma'ruf Karkhi, while some rooms at the sides of the prayer hall serve as private mausoleums for the Suwaidi and Qashtini families.\n\n\n=== Zumurrud Khatun's mausoleum ===\n \nThe mausoleum of Zumurrud Khatun was first built in 1202 by Sayyida Zumurrud Khatun herself. It was later developed into a mosque, known as the Haza'ir Mosque. The mosque has two prayer halls, one for the Hanafi school of thought and the other for the Shafi'i school. The mausoleum sports a tall muqarnas conical dome and fine brickwork.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Tomb of Bahlool ===\nBahlool, real name Wahhab ibn 'Amr, was a former qadi during the Abbasid Caliphate who served the Caliph Harun al-Rashid. He eventually became insane so that he would be excused from signing an approval to execute his friend Musa al-Kadhim. Bahlool was buried in this cemetery, and a shrine was built for him during the Ottoman rule in 1893.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nIn the courtyard of Bahlool's tomb is a small gurdwara for the Sikh community, known as the Baba Nanak Shrine. It dates back to at least 1511, and it is believed that Guru Nanak visited Baghdad in the same year. The shrine was damaged in 2003, during the Iraq War.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Tomb of Sheikh Mashi'uh ===\nSayyid Abdullah al-Assaf al-Ithawi, nicknamed Sheikh Mashi'uh by his followers, was a Sufi mystic who followed the Rifa'i and Qadiri Sufi orders. He was buried in 1835.\n\n\n== Controversy ==\nIn 2023, an order was made from the Iraqi government to exhume some of the bodies and transfer them to a different cemetery, as a highway would be built passing through the territory of the cemetery. This would be done to reduce traffic congestion. The decision was met with outrage amongst locals, despite a fatwa from the local clerics that approved of the exhumation and transfer of the deceased. Locals gathered outside the cemetery and protested against the exhumation. Due to these protests, the government eventually decided to build a bridge which passed over the cemetery instead.\n\n\n== Notable burials ==\nAisha Khatun (d. 18th century) the mother of Ahmed Pasha the governor of Baghdad under the Ottoman Empire\nMahmud al-Alusi (1802–1854) Hanafi scholar and author of Ruh al-Ma'ani\nRashid Hassan al-Kurdi (1882–1954) Preacher and Salafist theologian\n\n\n== See also ==\nQarafa necropolis\nTakht-e Foulad Cemetery\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sir William Linton  (1801 – 9 October 1880) was a Scottish army physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nLinton was the eldest son of Jabez Linton of Hardrigg Lodge, Dumfriesshire, by Jane, daughter of William Crocket of Grahamshill in the same county. He was born in 1801 at Kirkpatrick Fleming. He was educated at Edinburgh University, and graduated L.R.C.S. in 1826. But he had already utilised four summer vacations as surgeon on a whaler in the arctic regions. He entered the army medical department in 1826, graduated M.D. at Glasgow in 1834, and became staff surgeon of the first class in 1848. After serving in Canada, the Mediterranean, and the West Indies, he was appointed deputy inspector-general of hospitals of the first division of the army in the Crimea, was present in every action up to the battle of Balaclava, and had care of the barrack hospital in Scutari shortly after its establishment in 1854 until the British forces came home. On his return in 1856 he was created C.B. In the following year he proceeded to India as inspector-general of hospitals, to which was soon added the post of principal medical officer of the European army. He held the offices throughout the Indian mutiny. His unremitting zeal was rewarded by his being in 1859 enrolled among her majesty's honorary physicians, and in 1865 he was advanced to the dignity of K.C.B. Linton retired from the active list in 1863, and died unmarried at his residence of Skairfield, Lockerbie, Dumfriesshire, on 9 October 1880.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Seccombe, Thomas (1893). \"Linton, William (1801-1880)\".

        "content": "Winterton Lifeboat Station is a former Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) station, which was located in the town of Winterton-on-Sea in the county of Norfolk.\nA lifeboat was first stationed here by the Norfolk Association for Saving the Lives of Shipwrecked Mariners (NASLSM) in 1823, and transferred to the RNLI in 1858. The station closed in 1925.\n\n\n== History ==\nA lifeboat was sent to be stationed at Winterton in 1823 by the newly formed Norfolk Association for Saving the Lives of Shipwrecked Mariners. Built in 1822, she was a 32-foot 12-oared non-self-righting lifeboat. Launched to the aid of the vessel Mariners in 1829, the lifeboat was badly damaged, and the lifeboatmen had to take refuge aboard the casualty boat until all could be rescued by other local boats.\nIn 1857, the NASLSM made a request, that the RNLI take over responsibility for all their lifeboat stations, including Winterton. This was formally agreed in 1858. A new 30-foot 10-oared lifeboat was ordered for Winterton from Forrestt of Limehouse, London, costing £185-3s-5d. The new boat was sailed up from Great Yarmouth, having been towed there from London by steamer. This unnamed boat would only serve at Winterton for 3 years. She was disliked by the crew, and was subsequently transferred to Rye Harbour.\nThe Winterton lifeboat crew requested a wide beam boat, a Norfolk and Suffolk-class lifeboat, as used at Gt. Yarmouth, and similar to their own fishing boats. An order was placed with Beeching for a 32-foot lifeboat, and was delivered on 5 January 1861. This boat would come to be named Ann Maria (ON 15) in 1867, after a gift of £420 from Capt. E. W. Harris of Roehampton, and then 11 years later, renamed Edward Birkbeck after the RNLI Chairman.\nThe lifeboatmen, however, were still not entirely happy with this new boat, as it wasn't long enough for all their requirements. Their further request for another boat was declined by the RNLI, so in 1868, the crew, known as the Winterton Boatmen, acquired their own 42-foot Norfolk and Suffolk-class lifeboat Rescuer from the Gorleston Rangers lifeboat company, purchased by William Burnley Hume of Hill House, Winterton.\nAt a meeting with the RNLI in 1879, the Winterton crew explained that for certain calls, they preferred a longer boat than the Ann Maria, and also that they could no longer afford to maintain Rescuer. A 36-foot 14-oared Norfolk and Suffolk-class lifeboat, Husband (ON 16), was transferred from Corton Lifeboat Station in Suffolk, which had just closed, replacing Rescuer as the Winterton No.2 lifeboat. Two years later, a double boathouse was constructed, to house both lifeboats.\nIn 1896, the station received a new No.1 lifeboat, also to be named Edward Birkbeck (ON 397). The No.2 lifeboat Margaret (ON 270) was sent for an overhaul, with Reserve No.1 (ON 233) on relief duty. Reserve No.1 seemed to find favour with the Winterton crew, who requested that it become their permanent No.2 lifeboat. In 1899, the names were exchanged, with Reserve No.1 becoming Margaret (ON 233), and Margaret (ON 270) being renamed Reserve No.1.\nThe activity at Winterton Lifeboat Station came to rather an abrupt end. In October 1924, the No.1 lifeboat station was closed when the Edward Birkbeck (ON 397), was withdrawn. A month later, the No.2 lifeboat, by then the Eleanor Brown (ON 589) was also withdrawn, and a replacement No.2 lifeboat, a 38-foot Liverpool-class (P&S) lifeboat Reserve No.9 (ON 516) was placed at the station. Unfamiliar with this type of lifeboat, and being considered completely unsuitable for the locality, the crew absolutely refused to use the boat. On 18 December 1924, after 100 years of service, the RNLI decided to close the station completely, with the removal of the lifeboat completing the closure on 5 January 1925.\n\n\n== Notable service ==\nOn 26 November 1830, Lt. Thomas Leigh, RN, Chief Officer of Winterton Coastguard, was in charge of the lifeboat, rescuing 7 from the Annabella. Only a month later, Lt. Leigh and his crew rescued another 4 from the Henry. On 19 March 1833, Leigh and his crew went to the aid of the Crawford Davison, rescuing 16 passengers and crew. Then, on 30 April 1835, in a severe gale, Leigh and the crew rescued 3 survivors off the Blackbird.In a 5-year period, Lt. Thomas Leigh, RN, was awarded the RNLI Gold Medal, a Second-Service RNLI Gold Boat, the RNLI Silver Medal, and the Silver Medal of the Royal Humane Society.\n\n\n== Station honours ==\nThe following are awards made at Winterton\n\nRNLI Gold Medal\nLt.

        "content": "Stephen Luke (1763 – 30 March 1829) was an English physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nLuke second son of Stephen Luke, was born at Penzance, Cornwall, in 1763. He was sent to the school of the Rev. James Parker, was then apprenticed to Richard Moyle, apothecary, of Marazion, and subsequently studied medicine in London and Paris for three years, becoming a member of the Corporation of Surgeons. After a short period of practice in London he returned to Cornwall and practised at Helston. He obtained the degree of M.D. from the university of Aberdeen, 24 June 1792, and settled as a physician at Falmouth, where he soon attained a large practice and was elected mayor in 1797. He was captain of the Pendennis volunteer cavalry in the same year and the original promoter of the Pendennis artillery volunteers. He became an extra-licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians 23 July 1806. He entered in 1808 at Jesus College, Cambridge, and in 1811 took a house in Exeter for a short stay. Practice, however, came to him, and he stayed there nearly four years. He was admitted a licentiate of the College of Physicians 26 June 1815, and took a house in Cavendish Square, London. He graduated M.B. at Cambridge later in 1815 and M.D. in 1821. In 1828 he was made physician extraordinary to George IV. He died in London 30 March 1829. He married Harriot, daughter of Philip Puron Vyvyan of Tresmarrow, South Petherwin.\nLuke contributed an essay on nitrous acid in dropsy to Thomas Beddoes's ‘Contributions to Physical and Medical Knowledge,’ 1799. In this he describes a single case of cirrhosis of the liver in which, after tapping, nitrous acid was of use as a diuretic. He also added ‘Observations on the Diseases of Cornwall’ to Richard Polwhele's ‘History of Cornwall,’ 1806.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Moore, Norman (1893). \"Luke, Stephen\".

        "content": "Schuetzen Park (or Schützen Park) was a 19th-century recreation area in Washington, D.C. in the United States. The \"picnic and pleasure ground\" was founded by a German-American community group called Schuetzen Verein. The spacious, walled park was located on the east side of Georgia Avenue (then Seventh Street) between Hobart and Kenyon streets, Established in about 1866, on land where the 2nd Connecticut Regiment had camped during the American Civil War, Schuetzen Park survived until 1891, after which the area was developed into the neighborhood of Park View.  \nAttractions and ornaments of the park included a bust of Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben, who had helped the colonists win the American Revolutionary War. The popular Schuetzen Fest was held at the park every summer and featured target-shooting events, drinking, and performances by such as a tightrope-walker and the Marine Band. The winner of the shooting contests was named the Schuetzen King for the year. Regular-season activities, in addition to target shooting, included dancing and bowling. A fire in 1879 destroyed much of the infrastructure and several old trees, but Schuetzen Verein rebuilt. The park closed for good in part because the city had banned the sale of alcohol within a mile of the nearby Soldiers' Home.\n\n\n== References ==",

After the dissolution of the monasteries he became an apothecary in London, and supplicated for the degree of B.M. from the university of Oxford on 6 November 1553. He was admitted to the degree and to practice on 27 November 1554 (Oxf. Univ. Reg., Oxf. Hist. Soc., i. 222), but the College of Physicians of London informed the university of his incompetence in medicine, and he was excluded from the privileges of his degree. He went to Cambridge, but met with no better fate. The vigilant Dr. John Caius caused a letter to be sent to the authorities stating that Ludford had been examined by the College of Physicians on 12 February 1553, and found ignorant, not only of medicine but of philosophy and letters, and that he was without any trace of a liberal education. These rebuffs seem to have stimulated him to study, and he was admitted M.D. at Oxford on 26 June 1560. On 7 April 1563 he was elected a fellow of the College of Physicians of London, and he was chosen a censor in 1564, 1569, and 1572. His copy of the works of Avicenna is in the library of the college with some others of his books. His only extant composition is a manuscript copy of verses written on a blank space at the end of the preface of Charles Estienne's ‘De dissectione partium corporis humani libri tres,’ Paris, 1545, and descriptive of the book. Ludford had paid 8s. for the book, and states he was in want of money at the time. He died in 1574.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Moore, Norman (1893). \"Ludford, Simon\". In Lee, Sidney (ed.).

In 1907, he went to the French Third Republic to study the Catholic social movement there and, from 1907 to 1909, the labour movement, translating French sources to Spanish for the Center of Catholic Publications.

        "content": "Hoylake Town Hall is a former municipal building in Market Street in Hoylake, a town in Merseyside, in England.\n\n\n== History ==\nFollowing significant population growth, largely associated with the fishing industry, a local board of health was established in the area in 1891. The local board of health was replaced by Hoylake and West Kirby District Council in 1894. The new council decided to commission dedicated council offices: the site they selected was open land on the southeast side of Market Street.\nThe new building was designed in the Edwardian Baroque style, built in red brick with terracotta finishes and was completed in 1898. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage of 13 bays facing onto Market Street. The central bay featured a round headed doorway with an architrave and brackets supporting a semi-circular balustraded balcony: there were fine carvings below the balcony and there was a French door on the first floor. The wing sections of four bays each, which were surmounted by stepped gables, were fenestrated by four tall windows on the ground floor, two tall windows on the first floor and two smaller windows at attic level. The end sections of two bays each were fenestrated by pairs of tall windows on both floors. The bays were separated by pilasters surmounted by finials. Internally, the building accommodated a council chamber, offices for council officers and garaging for the town's fire brigade. \nIn September 1914, at the start of the First World War, the building was used as the venue for a recruiting drive for the 13th (Service) Battalion, the Cheshire Regiment, known informally as the \"Wirral Pals\". At the end of the war a large procession walked from the town hall to the public hall in West Kirby to honour the service of Captain Cyril Edward Gourley of the Royal Field Artillery who was awarded the Victoria Cross for bravery during the Battle of Cambrai.\nThe council was succeeded, in 1933, by the Hoylake Urban District Council, which continued to use the building as its headquarters. During Warship Week in 1942, local people raised funds to pay for a destroyer, HMS Verdun; a plaque was subsequently placed in the town hall to acknowledge the fund raising effort. The town hall ceased to be the local seat of government when the enlarged Wirral Council was formed in 1974. The building then accommodated a jobcentre until it closed in 2017.\nThe building was subsequently sold to a developer, Hylgar Properties, who announed plans to convert it into an arts centre, cinema, cafe, restaurant and shops. The developer secured financing of £3.6 million from the Coastal Communities Fund in February 2018 and planning consent from Wirral Council in August 2018.\nInitial work on the project, which included internal demolition and new roofing, started in late 2019. However, as of October 2022, because of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, limited progress had been made on the second stage of the project, which included the fit-out of the arts centre, cinema, cafe, restaurant and shops.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Feminism in Senegal became prominent in the 1980s with the creation of Yewwu-Yewwi. A second wave in the 1990s was more individual and pan-Africanist. A third wave in the 2000s and 2010s was more intersectional, accepting both the LGBT community and the wearing of the hijab, and extensively using online social networks.\n\n\n== Chronology ==\nResearchers Barrel Gueye and Selly Ba view Senegalese feminism in the form of three waves: overt elite feminism with Yewwu-Yewwi in the 1980s; a more covert, pan-African wave in the 1990s; and an intersectional wave more insistent on Senegalese and African identity in the 2000s and 2010s.\n\n\n=== Post-independence ===\nPrior to Gueye and Ba's three waves, the Union des Femmes Sénégalaises was created several decades earlier, in 1956, before merging into what later became known as the Socialist Party of Senegal, the party that held political power in Senegal for several decades. Other women's organisations were created, including the Association des Femmes Africaines pour la Recherche et le Développement (AFARD) established in 1977, some of whose members were key in creating Yewwu-Yewwi.\n\n\n=== 1980s and 1990s ===\nYewwu-Yewwi (YY) was created in 1984, by founders including the sociologist Marie Angélique Savané. YY was overtly feminist, calling for \"resistance and struggle\" against patriarchal norms and institutions in both private and public life. YY opposed polygamy, support women's rights of contraception and abortion, equal rights for women and men in politics and in salaries. Gueye and Ba see YY as having successfully created \"national and international momentum\" in improving women's status.\nAccording to Gueye and Ba, YY membership was mostly elite and leftist. It was verbally attacked by Islamists as the \"henchmen of Satan\" and \"corrupting\" society, as \"ugly women\" and as \"easy women\", and some were physically attacked. YY did not grow to include wider social groups or youth, leading to its eventual dissolution.\nThe second wave of Senegalese feminism benefited from the YY wave, but was more individual and covert, while also including a more pan-Africanist outlook. Specific issues of the second wave included continued actions to oppose female genital mutilation and child marriages.\n\n\n=== 2000s and 2010s ===\nThe third wave is seen by Gueye and Ba as further insisting on a diverse, intersectional, Senegalese form of feminism that is not the Western model of feminism, which is open to the LGBT community, does not oppose polygamy, and does not see wearing the hijab to be oppressive. Gueye and Ba view the third wave as achieving feminist aims through compromise with the patriarchal status quo as a practical strategy rather than through provocation.\nThe dominant use of online social networks by the third wave, without contact with large numbers of illiterate women without internet access, was seen by Gueye and Ba as limiting the wave's ability to achieve major changes.\nIn a March 2015 discussion on Senegalese feminism, Marie-Angélique Savané objected to discussion of gender replacing discussion of oppression. She viewed the younger generation as failing to maintain the gains of YY, and said that accepting the wearing of the hijab was not part of Senegalese culture.\n\n\n=== 2020s ===\nIn April 2023, Feminist sociologist Fatou Sow supported the creation of the Réseau des féministes du Sénégal (English: Network of feminists in Senegal). She commended the organisations in the network for overtly declaring themselves to be feminist, as stated in the \"Charter of feminist principles for African feminists\" created during the 2009 African Feminist Forum held in Accra; and for the organisations' willingness to network together despite diverse interests and conflicts. Sow argued that Africa is the only continent to have a women's rights convention, the Maputo Protocol.\n\n\n== Legislative achievements ==\nThe third wave of Senegalese feminists were credited with several legal changes. In 2004, Law 91-22 of 16 February 1991 on education was modified to make education obligatory for all children from the age of six to sixteen. In 2010, Law 2010-11 of 28 May 2010 established \"absolute parity\" in all institutions that are \"partially or totally\" electoral. Lists of candidates have to alternate candidates of \"the two sexes\". The law was implemented, with the 2012 parliamentary election resulting in 64 women parliamentarians out of 150 seats in total (43%) and the 2022 election resulting in 73 women out of 165 seats (44%). In 2020, Law 2020-05 of 10 January 2020 criminalised rape and paedophilia.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAfrican feminism\nWomen in Senegal\n\n\n== References ==",
