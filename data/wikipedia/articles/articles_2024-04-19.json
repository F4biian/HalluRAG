        "content": "Juliana Chan is a biologist, a science communicator, the founder of Asian Scientist, and the founder and CEO of Wildtype Media Group.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nChan graduated from the University of Cambridge with both a BA and an MA in natural science. She graduated from MIT in 2010 with a PhD in biology. After graduation, Chan interned at Changi General Hospital before coming to the realization that medicine was not her calling. She sought out an education scholarship, receiving a fellowship from A*STAR, a Singaporean research institute, which led to a $750,000 startup grant; Chan was able to use this to start her own lab at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and the Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine.\n\n\n== Career ==\nWhile working as a biomedical researcher at NTU, Chan started a blog called Asian Scientist. She cited the need to escape from the \"insularity and isolation\" of scientific research in starting the blog. The blog became popular enough to lead to a partnership with the publishing house World Scientific Publishing, enabling Chan to turn Asian Scientist into a magazine and serve as its editor-in-chief.\nChan founded Wildtype Media Group in 2018, leaving both her role as editor of Asian Scientist and running her research lab at NTU; Chan recognized the risk of taking on an entrepreneurial career but said she found a calling in helping to \"make Asian scientists household names\". Wildtype is described as the first \"STEM-focused media company in Singapore that provides professional science communication services to government agencies, industry, and academia in Singapore as well as the broader Asian region\".\nChan holds 4 patents in the United States and has designed nanoparticles for drug delivery and developed systems to grow blood capillaries in microfluidic devices. In 2015, Chan was appointed as a Young Global Leader, a program created by the World Economic Forum to recognize highly accomplished professionals in their field.\nChan transitioned Wildtype to full remote work in August 2023, citing the impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and calling remote work \"the future of work\".\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\nIn 2011, Chan was the recipient of an L’Oréal For Women in Science National Fellowship award\nIn 2013, Chan won the Singapore Youth Award\nIn 2014, Chan was recognized by MIT Technology Review as one of the top 10 Innovators Under 35\nIn 2018, Chan was recognized by Tatler Asia's Gen.T list which honors future Asian leaders\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The bed of nails defense and the related pebble fan defense are anti-ballistic missile concepts intended to defend missile silos against attack.\nThe bed of nails consists of a field of 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) long steel rebars rising vertically out of the ground in a pattern in front of the silo to be defended. Warheads aimed at missile silos will hit at least one of the rebars before hitting the ground, potentially destroying the warhead before it can trigger. The pebble fan is a similar concept consisting of a long strip of gunpowder topped with steel balls which would be triggered to fly into the air and produce a \"curtain\" of pellets.\nAlthough neither system is wholly effective, they cost almost nothing to build and are effective enough to increase the number of failed attacks and thus demand a larger number of warheads be expended in an attack on the US ICBM force. This would leave fewer warheads to use on other targets. Moreover, the results of their attack would be much less predictable, making such an attack less valuable to the Soviets.\nThe question of the survivability of the Minuteman missile force was repeatedly raised by the Department of Defense (DOD) after 1969. Although these systems could be deployed rapidly and for almost no cost, there was practically no interest on the part of the DOD or US Air Force to do so. Much of this appears to be due to the desire to replace Minuteman with the MX missile.\n\n\n== Counterforce attacks ==\nModern ICBM reentry vehicles (RVs) are shaped like a cone to have low hypersonic drag. This reduces the time they spend flying through the atmosphere during reentry, lowering the effect of unknown winds, and reducing the time they and are vulnerable to counterattack. For instance, a high-drag RV falling at about 100 metres per second (330 ft/s) would take a minute to cross the last 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) of the atmosphere, in a 30 kilometres per hour (19 mph) wind, the RV would be blown off course by 500 metres (1,600 ft). At that speed, it would also be a target for conventional short-range anti-aircraft guns like the M61 Vulcan.\nTo destroy a Minuteman missile silo, a 1 MT explosion has to take place within about 500 metres (1,600 ft) with enough of the explosion's energy going into the ground to be effective. This demands the warhead explode at very low altitude, ideally around 250 metres (820 ft). In the early 1970s, Soviet RVs were thought to have accuracy on the order of 1 nautical mile (1.9 km; 1.2 mi), just enough to get one into the lethal radius if two are fired at every silo.\nAfter travelling in a ballistic path, enemy RVs would approach the silos from the north at an elevation angle of about 22 degrees above the horizon. While the accuracy of the guidance system is enough to get them within range in terms of ground radius, that same accuracy is far too low to ensure it would be at the correct altitude as it passed over the silo. Some form of direct measurement of altitude would be needed.\nAssume one uses a barometer type altimeter set to trigger at 250 m; if the sensor is 1% inaccurate in measuring altitude based on a nominal 14.7 psi atmospheric pressure, that represents an altitude difference of 120 metres (390 ft). This would still be lethal in terms of altitude. However, travelling at a 22 degree angle means that the time it takes to cross that 120 m altitude inaccuracy will have it move 250 metres (820 ft) laterally, which may take it outside the lethal radius.\nAnother possibility is to use a radio altimeter or similar device which directly measures the distance to the ground and thus can accurately trigger. The problem with this approach is that the defenders could send out signals from ground-based radios that would either confuse the altimeter or cause it to trigger prematurely. Such a system would be \"the height of foolishness given American jamming prowess.\"\nAs a result, based on the technology of the 1970s, the only effective way to attack a silo is with contact fusing. Inaccuracy is that of the RV's internal guidance, but when exploded on the surface it puts the maximum amount of energy into the ground and thus maximizes that lethal radius.\n\n\n== Bed of nails ==\nThe bed of nails was a concept that was intended to counter contact-fused weapons. It consisted of a field of conventional steel rebars each 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) long and driven into the ground about 0.6 metres (2 ft 0 in). They were arranged in lines with the bars 1 metre (3 ft 3 in) apart in a row about 600 metres (2,000 ft) long. 150 such rows were arranged 5 metres (16 ft) apart. The result was a field 600 m wide, 450 m long, and about 1.4 m high.\nGiven the low approach angle, any warhead aimed at the silo that would fall close enough to be lethal would strike one of the rebars and be destroyed. There is a chance that the fuse would hit the bar and trigger, or that the RV would survive the strike and hit the ground and trigger, but these are relatively small possibilities. In an all-out counterforce attack scenario, the system would at least ensure a good population of US missiles would survive, ensuring a counterstrike capability and that mutually assured destruction would not be compromised.\nBest of all, the system costs practically nothing, estimates were about $60,000 per silo in 1976.\n\n\n== Pebble curtain ==\nThe closely related pebble curtain concept can be thought of as an active version of the bed of nails. This consists of a 300 metres (980 ft) wide stripe of propellant, normally gunpowder, with many 10 grams (0.35 oz) steel pellets on top. In total, there would be about 10 short tons (9.1 t) of pellets, costing about $2,000, and 1 ton of propellant. When triggered, the pellets are thrown vertically into the air, forming a \"curtain\" of balls. Like the bed of nails, an RV hitting one of these pellets would likely be destroyed. The main advantage of this system is that as it is buried, it is much more difficult to destroy.\nUnlike the bed of nails, which is entirely passive, the pebble curtain would have to be triggered at the right moment. This would normally be accomplished by placing a radar a short distance north of the silo. As the radar is looking up at the side of the RV as it passes, the return is some 1000 to 10,000 times greater than looking at it nose-on. This means even a very small radar system would have the required performance. If the balls are replaced by small darts, the amount of propellant is reduced and the vertical coverage increases, a concept known as a porcupine. It is otherwise identical in concept.\n\n\n== Countermeasures ==\nThere is a simple way to defeat these systems, although it is at the cost of adding one more warhead to the attack. In this system, two warheads would be aimed at the silo, one with a barometer type altimeter that arrives first, and then a second that is contact fused. The goal of the first warhead is to explode above the silo and flatten the bed of nails. This does not require high accuracy and thus a barometer would work. The second RV would then be able to contact fuse.\nThe pebble bed, being buried, is much more robust and would likely survive such an explosion. But because the defense cannot know what any particular warhead is doing, any RV approaching the silo would require the system to be triggered. After a short time, the pellets fall back to the ground and the following warheads will not be intercepted.\nIt was assumed that two warheads would need to be aimed at every US silo to ensure at least one would hit close enough to be lethal. Because the dust thrown up by one warhead will destroy any following behind, both have to impact as close as possible in time. Thus one could not use one of the two existing RVs aimed at the silo for this purpose, a third dedicated to this role would be needed. However, that first warhead is not attacking the silo and does not have to be very accurate, a single warhead would be enough to ensure this part of the attack worked. Thus, adding these defenses might demand three warheads per silo rather than two.\n\n\n== Never built ==\nFrom 1969, the US Department of Defense (DOD) began to raise the concern that future Soviet RVs, from the 1970s, would be powerful and accurate enough to attack the Minuteman missile force a practical possibility. They began to study new solutions to ensure the ICBM force would survive such an attack in enough numbers to ensure that an effective counterattack would be possible. This led to the MX missile project and its many changes in basing strategy as the nature of the threat changed.\nDespite the DODs comments on the pressing nature of the problem, and the fact that the bed of nails could be deployed immediately and for vanishing cost, the DOD and US Air Force expressed almost no interest in doing so. At the time the concept was proposed, it was noted that \"Such systems, perhaps because of the old-fashioned technology employed or because they are incapable of defending a large spectrum of targets, arouse little interest within the Defense Department. This is surprising in the view of the enormous emphasis given by the Secretaries of Defence, among others, since 1969 to the question of Minuteman vulnerability.\" He later added that the lack of interest was likely due to such a system making the advancement of the MX more difficult to justify.\nThe only comments about the systems were from the Ballistic Missile Defense Agency deputy program manager, who stated that the concepts were \"difficult to synthesize and still meet the criteria of low cost, rapid deployability and adequate effectiveness.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nGarwin, Richard (Autumn 1976). \"Effective Military Technology for the 1980s\".

        "content": "Southern Pacific No. 1298 is a preserved 0-6-0 steam locomotive on display at Harvey West Park in Santa Cruz, California.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Revenue Service ===\nSouthern Pacific No. 1298 was built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for the Arizona Eastern Railroad in 1917 as their No. 39. It was built as the second to last 0-6-0 Switcher for the Arizona Eastern. In total, up to 27 were built for the railroad between 1913 and 1917. The S-10 also came equipped with a superheater in the boiler.\nIt operated in Miami and Bowie, Arizona as a switcher and maybe in short-distance freight trains. By 1924, it was renumbered to No. 1298 after the Southern Pacific, which leased the Arizona Eastern since 1905, swallowed up the line. They renumbered all of their locomotives and No. 1298 was reassigned out of Arizona to San Diego, California. Just three years later, No. 1298 returned to Arizona for a rebuild to increase her running time. No. 1298 went to Yuma, Arizona, and the rebuild was completed on March 10th, 1927 and went back to San Diego, working there until the early 1950s, after which No. 1298 was reassigned to Oakland, where No. 1298 operated for a few more years. \n\n\n=== Retirement ===\nThe engine was retired in September of 1956, and was placed in storage in Oakland. At the same time, Harvey E. West, a philanthropist, and a local lumber magnate donated several acres of his land to create a park on the westside of Santa Cruz tucked away in the redwoods. The park was created on May 30th, 1959. Shortly after the park was opened, the Southern Pacific Railroad donated the locomotive to the City of Santa Cruz. In 1963, No. 1298 arrived at Harvey West Park and with some rails underneath her, was placed down via a crane and sat as a playground. Platforms were added to the locomotive and it became a play structure.\nIn 1987, the City of Santa Cruz voted to sell all of No. 1298. The stipulations of that agreement would’ve been No. 1298 sold off into private ownership. However, public backlash to the arrangement led to the city only selling the tender of the locomotive. The tender would go to the newly formed, Eccles & Eastern Railroad. The Eccles and Eastern Railroad wanted to rebuild the Mountain Division that the Southern Pacific  previously operated between Santa Cruz and San Francisco and Oakland that was used for the Suntan Special. The railroad planned to have an excursion service on the line. The locomotive that the railroad acquired was Southern Pacific 2706 from Ramsey Park in Watsonville, California. The tender of 2706 needed a backup as a just in case since 2706 and 1298’s tender were the same oil-based Vanderbilt styled. The tender of No. 1298 was removed in mid-1989 and was taken to Swift Street siding in Santa Cruz along with 2706. But internal problems with the railroad led to excursion plans falling through before the locomotive was even restored. The tender of 1298 was shipped to Colusa, California, along with 2706 to be restored. Since then, 1298 has been sitting at Harvey West Park, without a tender.\nToday, the locomotive is still on display at Harvey West Park in poor condition.\n\n\n== References ==",

It was originally named the \"George and Dragon\", and succeeded an earlier building, named by John Leland in the 16th century.  The building was altered and extended in the late 18th century.  In the late 19th century, it was converted into a private house, but in the 20th century was converted back into a hotel, the \"Bridge House Hotel\", also spending some time as the \"Catterick Bridge Hotel\".  It was undergoing renovations in 2014, when it was badly damaged in a fire.  It was then further damaged by vandals, and was sold in both 2022 and 2023.  In 2024, plans were submitted to demolish the worst-affected parts of the building, at the rear, and mostly dating from the 20th century, restore the remainder, convert it into apartments, and build additional housing on the rest of the site.\nThe building is roughcast and has pantile roofs with stone copings and shaped kneelers, and there are two storeys.  The central part has a U-shaped plan, with a range of two bays and projecting gabled wings with attics, and there are later added ranges.  In the middle is a doorway with pilasters and a segmental pediment containing a coat of arms, and the windows are sashes.  In the right range is a semicircular-headed porch and a canted bay window, and in the left range are oriel windows.  It has been grade II listed since 1977.\n\n\n== See also ==\nListed buildings in Brough with St Giles\n\n\n== References ==",

This the first single from the album, People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm. The song contains a sample of \"Running Away\" by Roy Ayers (1977). This song calls out toxic masculinity, drug dealers, and domestic abusers.\n\n\n= Critical reception =\nAn account named OGNickMarsh commented on Focus Hip Hop, \"This was A Tribe Called Quest’s very first single. It’s starting now. The beat’s pretty dope. The first verse from Q-Tip was cool. Damn… He actually murdered that second verse. That was probably his best verse on the whole album to be honest. He finally kinda switched up his flow. He sounded great. Oh. Okay, the song’s pretty much over now. There’s a LONG ass instrumental outro.

        "revision_id": 1219805813,
        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "The climate of Triton encompasses the atmospheric dynamics, weather, and long-term atmospheric trends of Neptune's moon Triton. Although the atmosphere of Triton is rather thin, with a surface pressure of only 1.4 Pa (1.38×10−5 atm) at the time of Voyager 2's flyby: 873  but heavily variable, it still drives active, global weather and climate cycles and heavily influences Triton's glacial activity.\nTriton's climate is dominated by extreme seasonal fluctuations that induce global volatile transport between its polar caps, leading to variable atmospheric circulation. The atmosphere of Triton also supports the formation of atmospheric haze and clouds, both of which remain poorly-studied. While Triton's climate is similar to the climate of Pluto, important differences separate the two, such as Triton's more chaotic climate cycles and colder atmosphere.\n\n\n== Atmospheric properties ==\n\nTriton's atmosphere possesses a mean surface pressure of roughly 1.4 Pa, or roughly 1⁄70,000 that of Earth's sea level pressure. The mean surface pressure varies significantly with respect to Triton's seasons; by 1997, Triton's atmospheric surface pressure had risen to approximately 1.9+0.18−0.15 Pa and the surface pressure may have reached a maximum of roughly 4 Pa by 2010 (though there were no direct measurements via occultation between 2007 and 2017). Nevertheless, by 2022 the surface pressure dropped back to 1.454 ± 0.047 Pa, nearly exactly what Voyager 2 recorded in 1989. Triton's atmosphere is composed mainly of nitrogen (~99%), with minor contributions from other compounds such as methane (~0.02%) and carbon monoxide (~0.01%), similar to the atmosphere of Pluto and, to an extent, the atmosphere of Titan.\n\n\n=== Temperature ===\nMeasurements of Triton's surface temperature by Voyager 2 range between 34 and 44K (−239 and −229°C), with an extrapolated surface temperature of 37.5K (−235.7°C) based on an atmospheric thermal profile. These measurements are consistent with the observed atmospheric surface pressure of ~1.4 Pa by Voyager 2, which is close to nitrogen's vapor pressure at 37.5K. Over the decade following the Voyager 2 flyby, Triton's surface temperature increased to 39.3K (−233.9°C) by 1997.\n\n\n== Atmospheric phenomena ==\n\nDespite the thin and heavily variable atmospheric surface pressure, Triton's atmosphere hosts a variety of global phenomena. Triton appears to host a distinct troposphere, which may be thermally-defined by the atmosphere's vertical temperature profile. Alternatively, Triton's lower atmosphere may be dynamically-defined by wind shear.\n\n\n=== Winds and circulation ===\nMost information about Triton's winds come from the numerous dark streaks which mark its southern polar cap that appear to follow prevailing winds in the region. Over 100 of these streaks have been observed, with most extending to the northeast from narrow points—presumably their points of origin. Two active plumes, the Hili and Mahilani Plumes, were also observed; the plume columns abruptly streak westward at an altitude of roughly 8 km, possibly marking Triton's tropopause.: 873  The direction of the plume streaks may indicate anticyclonic circulation around Triton's south pole, with winds blowing within an Ekman layer where wind direction is governed by a balance of the pressure gradient force, Coriolis force, and drag. A temperature gradient drives a thermal wind which eventually weakens eastwards winds before reversing direction with increasing altitude.: 874  The observations of the active plume columns show that Triton's atmosphere is capable of wind-driven material transport, but the speed of Triton's winds are poorly constrained. Early estimates shortly after the Voyager 2 flyby estimated westerly wind speeds of 5-15 m/s near Triton's south pole, but subsequent modelling resulted in much weaker westerly winds of < 0.5 m/s. \nTriton's atmospheric circulation is dominated by the sublimation and deposition of nitrogen. Models of Triton's global circulation during its southern hemisphere summer, where nitrogen sublimates from the southern polar cap and deposits on the northern polar cap, result in a general south-to-north flow. The Coriolis force deflects these winds, leading to retrograde winds that blow up to 10 m/s above Triton's equator. However, the apparent reversal of winds ~8 km above Triton's south polar cap, as indicated by the plumes observed by Voyager 2, remains largely unexplained.\n\n\n=== Clouds ===\nImages of Triton's limb and terminator by Voyager 2 discovered multiple clouds. Distinct, east-to-west crescent-shaped clouds roughly 10 km wide and hundreds of kilometers long were observed beyond Triton's terminator, with the clouds estimated to be 1-3 kilometers above the surface. Up to one-third of Triton's limb near its southern regions were covered by clouds. The clouds on Triton are likely composed of condensed nitrogen crystals suspended in Triton's atmosphere.: 873 \n\n\n=== Haze ===\nAs with the atmospheres of Pluto and Titan, Triton's atmosphere supports layers of organic atmospheric haze. The haze is relatively sparse; Triton's atmosphere is about as hazy as the Martian atmosphere when there are no dust storms are in progress.\n The haze primarily occurs in Triton's lower atmosphere, extending up to ~30 km above Triton's surface, though possibly extending further, due to Voyager 2's detection limitations. The haze is likely formed by the action of ultraviolet light on atmospheric methane and nitrogen,: 873  and may be influenced by the presence of carbon monoxide the condensation of hydrocarbon ice. The resulting material aggregates into particles about 100-200 nm in size, largely composed of a variety of hydrocarbons and nitriles termed tholins.: 873  Despite the broad similarities between the atmospheres of Triton and Pluto in composition and pressure, models of haze formation indicate that the atmospheric haze on Triton significantly differs from the atmospheric haze of Pluto. This may be due to Triton's lower atmosphere being significantly colder than Pluto's atmosphere by 20-40K, alongside differences in methane abundance in the upper atmospheres of each.\n\n\n== Seasons ==\n\nTriton's seasons are very long, owing to Neptune's orbital period of 164.8 years. Neptune's orbit is also nearly circular, with a low eccentricity of 0.0097; as such, each season on Triton lasts roughly 40 years, and Triton's seasonal variations are almost entirely governed by the tilt of its rotational axis relative to the Sun. Triton is tidally locked, with one hemisphere facing Neptune at all times; Triton's rotational period is 5 days and 21 hours and it has nearly zero axial tilt with respect to its orbital plane around Neptune.: 866  However, Triton's orbit is retrograde and significantly inclined with respect to Neptune's equatory, at roughly 23°, and Neptune itself has an axial tilt of roughly 28°. Triton's orbit also experiences rapid precession, with a nodal precession period of 637 ± 40 years. The combination of these factors results in complex seasonal cycles which vary significantly between each Neptune year, with its summer solstice subsolar latitude varying between 5° latitude to 50° latitude over a 140-180 year period.\nSimilar to the seasons of Pluto (and, to a lesser extent, the seasons of Mars), Triton's seasons strongly affect its volatile cycles and nitrogen ice caps. Triton's volatile cycles are largely controlled by the sublimation and deposition of nitrogen and other volatile compounds. Freshly-deposited nitrogen is expected to be bright as observed in Triton's southern polar cap and the bright, blue equatorial surface frost observed by Voyager 2. However, despite large regions of Triton being comparatively darker, ground-based spectral observations indicate that Triton's surface is mostly covered in a layer of transparent or translucent nitrogen ice; furthermore, modelling fails to replicate the observed distribution of bright and dark surfaces. It has been suggested that small, freshly-deposited grains of nitrogen ice eventually metamorphize into a clear, transparent layer within a Triton season. Conversely, freshly-deposited nitrogen ice may be translucent, before later shattering as seasonal swings in temperature induce repeated phase changes between solid nitrogen's α- and β-phases, brightening older ice.\nAt the time of Voyager 2's arrival, Triton was experiencing an unusually intense southern hemisphere summer. Triton's southern polar cap extended nearly or entirely up to the equator, covering large swathes of Triton's lower latitudes. To extend so far indicates that Triton's southern polar cap likely maintains a large, permanent sheet of nitrogen ice (as opposed to completely seasonal polar caps). Triton's northern polar cap was not observed directly, but it is presumed to exist, albeit at a significantly smaller extent than Triton's southern cap. Modelling of Triton's seasonal cycles support the existence of a permanent northern polar cap with a thickness of at least several hundred meters, and that Triton's southern polar cap is likely to be over a kilometer thick at its maximum.\nThe extreme southern hemisphere summer which coincided with the Voyager 2 flyby may have contributed to the significant increase in surface temperature and atmospheric surface pressure observed from 1989 to 1997; this increase in atmospheric surface pressure continued until at least 2007, before returning to Voyager 2 levels by 2017. Climate models predicted a steady decrease in atmospheric pressure through 2005-2060 as sublimated nitrogen from the southern polar cap migrates to and deposits in the expanding northern polar cap, so the causes of the rapid fluctuations in pressure remain unclear.\n\n\n== See also ==\nClimate of Pluto – Types of climate on the dwarf planet Pluto\nClimate of Mars – Climate patterns of the planet Mars\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Freccia (\"Arrow\") was an Italian Lampo-class destroyer. Commissioned into service in the Italian Regia Marina (Royal Navy) in 1902, she served in the Italo-Turkish War, during which she was wrecked in 1911.\n\n\n== Construction and commissioning ==\nFreccia was laid down at the Schichau-Werke in Elbing in the German Empire in 1899. She was launched on 23 November 1899 and completed on 25 May 1902. She was commissioned in May 1902.\nFreccia and her five sister ships formed the first class of destroyers built for the Regia Marina, their only predecessor, Fulmine, having been a one-off. Designed by the German Schichau-Werke shipyard, they were seaworthy, robust, fast, and reliable, although they were afflicted by serious problems with seakeeping. \n\n\n== Service history ==\nFreccia participated in the Italo-Turkish War, which began on 29 September 1911 with the Kingdom of Italy′s declaration of war on the Ottoman Empire. On 12 October 1911, a few days after Italian forces occupied Tripoli in Ottoman Tripolitania, Freccia struck rocks while attempting to leave Tripoli during a storm, then ran aground on a sandbank at the entrance of the port. Her entire crew survived, and initially the ship was considered to be in good condition and the Italians hoped to refloat her quickly. However, she sank by the bow a few days after running aground, coming to rest partially submerged. A steam launch struck the wreck on the evening of 21 October 1911, and damage to the wreck progressed until ultimately she was deemed beyond salvage.\n\n\n== References ==",

He was a judge of the appellate court, and the mayor of Warsaw, Poland, in 1994.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMieczysław Bareja was born on 18 October 1939 in Siedlce, Poland.\nHe had graduated the law from the University of Warsaw, and begun working in the jurisprudence in 1963. In 1981 he became the secretary of the Warsaw committee of the Alliance of Democrats. He unsuccessfully attempted to get its mandate to run for the office of a member of Sejm of Poland in the 1989 parliamentary election. In 1990 he became a judge of the Appellate Court in Warsaw, and was also a leader of the Warsaw Voivodeship Electoral Commission. From 1990 to 1997 he was a chairperson of the Warsaw Regional Electoral Commission.\nOn 5 October 1994, he was appointed as the mayor of Warsaw by an informal short-lived political coaltion in the Warsaw City Council, consisting of the Democratic Left Alliance and Rigth Together. On 3 November 1994, he was dismissed from his position, after the coucil had rejected the cabinet proposed by him. The same day was formed a new coaltion, consisting of the Democratic Left Alliance and the Freedom Union. Marcin Święcicki was then appointed as the new mayor.\n\nIn the 1990s Bareja was a judge in the Lustration Court. He was accused of committing lustration, by allegedly not reveling his past connections to the Security Service. Bareja died on 10 February 2003, on the day of his trial. He was posthumously found not guilty, and his supposed connections to the Security Service dismissed. Bareja was burried at the Bródno Cemetery in Warsaw, in the grave no. 68E-1-23.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "John Butkovich (September 16, 1956 – July 31, 1975) was a Croatian American young man who disappeared on July 31, 1975. He was a victim of American serial killer and sex offender John Wayne Gacy, who murdered, raped and tortured at least 33 young men and boys between 1972 and 1978. Butkovich was killed by Gacy on the day of his disappearance, and remained missing for three years before his body was unearthed from Gacy's home on December 22, 1978, and his remains were conclusively identified a week later on December 29, 1978.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nJohn Butkovich was born on September 16, 1956, in Slavonski Brod, Croatia, to parents Marko and Terezia Butkovich. His father, Marko Butkovich, was an immigrant from Yugoslavia. At some point later in their lives, the family moved to the United States, residing in the state of Illinois.\nAround c. 1973, when Butkovich was 16 and still in high school, he was working in a hardware store when a man named John Wayne Gacy offered him a construction job in his PDM Contractors business. Gacy stated that Butkovich was a \"tireless kid\" who \"learned fast.\" Gacy's wife, Carole Hoff, described Butkovich as a \"very nice boy\" who was at Gacy's house several times and had dinner with the couple. Hoff would nickname Butkovich as \"Little John\" and Gacy as \"Big John.\" When Gacy's mother moved to Arkansas to be with Gacy's sister, Karen, and the rest of Karen's family, Butkovich helped her move there. During Butkovich's time working for Gacy, his and Hoff's marriage worsened, which led to Hoff doing much travelling with her daughters, who were stepdaughters to Gacy. In July 1975, she and the kids travelled to Arkansas to help Karen look after her and Gacy's mother, who had broke her hip. Hoff never saw Butkovich alive again.\n\n\n== Disappearance and murder ==\nUnbeknownst to Butkovich, Gacy had previously committed at least two known murders; he killed a 16-year-old teenager called Timothy McCoy in January 1972 as well as an unidentified victim in 1974. In the evening of July 30, 1975, Butkovich arrived at one of his father's apartments, complaining to him that Gacy had not been paying him his check for the last two weeks worth of work. The elder Butkovich suggested that if Gacy continued to not pay him, John should inform authorities. Gacy claimed in a later account that in the morning of July 31, Butkovich and three other friends arrived at his house, threatening to \"kick his ass\" unless he gave him the check, with Gacy saying he would pay him after he got Butkovich's files. According to Gacy, things later calmed down and he presented the files on Butkovich, which stated that he owed Gacy $300. They eventually reached a compromise, with Gacy claiming that they all proceeded to smoke marijuana and drink beer before Butkovich and his friends left and Gacy fell asleep in his chair.\nIn the evening of that same day, Gacy was said to encountered Butkovich exiting his car, waving to attract his attention. The drunk young man said to Gacy: \"I wanna talk to ya,\" with the also drunk Gacy telling him to get in his car. He drove Butkovich back to his house, which was located in Norwood Park Township. When they arrived, Gacy stated that Butkovich started shouting at him, demanding for his check. Gacy managed to calm Butkovich down and then conned him into allowing his wrists to be handcuffed behind his back. Butkovich threatened Gacy by saying: \"When I get these cuffs off, you're a dead man.\" Gacy told Butkovich that he wouldn't take the cuffs off until he \"sobered up\", adding: \"If anyone gets killed, it's you John [Butkovich].\" Gacy later admitted to having \"sat on the kid's chest for a while\" before laying down besides Butkovich and \"kept the angry, drunken boy company until he came to his senses.\" Gacy confessed to strangling Butkovich to death; he was 18 years old.\n\n\n=== Aftermath ===\nAfter Butkovich's death, Gacy stowed body in his garage, intending to bury the remains of Butkovich later in his crawl space along with Timothy McCoy's body. However, when his wife Carole Hoff and her daughters returned home from their trip to Arkansas earlier than expected, Gacy was forced to bury Butkovich's body under the concrete floor of the tool room extension of his garage in an empty space where he had originally intended to dig a drain tile. Gacy told Hoff that Butkovich had quit his job at PDM and had run away.\nButkovich's father, Marko Butkovich, later found his son's car abandoned with the keys in the ignition, which made him suspicious as his son would always park his car in the garage, but he didn't touch the car as he feared he could destroy evidence if he did. Marko then dialed the police, mentioning that his son had intended to confront Gacy the night before. When the police arrived, they checked inside the car and found John Butkovich's jacket as well as wallet containing $40. Gacy was then questioned by police, saying that John and two friends had arrived at his house demanding the overdue pay, but they had reached a compromise and all three had left and had likely disappeared after that. The police believed Gacy and told the Butkovich family that John was probably a runaway, but the family was sure he hadn't run away and feared for his life. For this reason, Marko directly phoned Gacy, who claimed he was happy to help search for his son but was sorry John had run away. For the next three years, Butkovich's parents called police over 100 times, urging them to investigate Gacy further, but police soon refused to take anymore calls from them.\nButkovich was only Gacy's third known victim. Between 1976 and 1978, Gacy would go on a killing spree, murdering at least 30 more victims, evading capture from the police for three years until his final arrest in December 1978.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\nButkovich's whereabouts remained a mystery for over three years. However, after 15-year-old Robert Piest mysteriously vanished without a trace in December 1978, Gacy would immediately become a suspect as he was one of the last people seen with Piest. The Des Plaines Police did a check of John Wayne Gacy's criminal background and found out that Gacy had a battery charge in Chicago and had also been sentenced to 10 years in prison in 1968 in Waterloo, Iowa, after being found guilty of sodomizing a then 15-year-old boy named Donald Voorhees Jr., who was the son of Donald E. Voorhees, in 1967, five years before Gacy murdered McCoy. As police suspected Gacy may be holding Piest hostage in the same house Butkovich was killed, the Des Plaines Police obtained a search warrant on December 13, 1978. They could not locate Piest, but they did find suspicious items, leading them to confiscate Gacy's vehicles and putting Gacy under surveillance.\nOn December 15, Des Plaines investigators obtained further details of Gacy's battery charge, learning Jeffrey Rignall had reported that Gacy had lured him into his car, then chloroformed, raped and tortured him before dumping him in Lincoln Park in March of that 1978. In an interview with Gacy's former wife, Carole Hoff who was fond of Butkovich, the same day they had learned of Butkovich's disappearance. Four days later, on December 19, investigators began compiling evidence to obtain a second search warrant for Gacy's house. The same day, Gacy's lawyers filed a $750,000 lawsuit against the Des Plaines police; the hearing for the suit was scheduled to take place on December 22. On December 21, the Des Plaines Police were granted a second search warrant. After police informed Gacy of their intentions to search his crawl space for the body of Piest, Gacy denied the teenager was buried there, but admitted to killing a young man in self-defence whose body was buried under his garage, whom he would later name as John Butkovich. Gacy was later arrested that day, and Butkovich's body was found under the garage, along with 26 other victims stored in his crawl space who were unearthed over the next week, with two others also being unearthed elsewhere on his property.\n\n\n== Investigation ==\nButkovich was the second overall victim of to be recovered, being labelled as Body 2. Just a week after being discovered, Body 2 was conclusively identified as John Butkovich on December 29, 1978; he was among the first victims to be identified. On February 6, 1980, Gacy was brough to trial. On March 13, Gacy was found guilty of 33 counts of murder, as well as one count of indecent liberties with a child and deviate sexual assault. He was sentenced to execution and was transferred to the Menard Correctional Center, where he remained on death row for 14 years before being executed by lethal injection at the Stateville Correctional Center on May 10, 1994, aged 52.\n\n\n== Funeral ==\nSoon after his identification, a funeral was held for Butkovich and he was buried at the Queen of Heaven Cemetery in the village of Hillside, Illinois. His tombstone depicts an angel praying to Jesus Christ; it also contains his father's name, who passed away in 1998. The inscription upon his tombstone reads: \"Eternal Rest, Grant Unto Them O'Lord. Our Son Johnny.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nCrime in Illinois\nJohn Wayne Gacy\nList of solved missing person cases: pre-2000\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Cited works and further reading ==\nAmirante, Sam L.; Broderick, Danny (2011).

Meanwhile, the party's president is Bermin Meškić.\n\n\n== Activities ==\nThe party nominted Armin Hodžić for the 12th Minority District in which members of the Albanian, Bosniak, Montenegrin, Macedonian and Slovenian national minorities elect a common representative for the 2024 Croatian Parliamentary election. Hodžić defeated Ermina Lekaj Prljaskaj of the Union of Albanians by a margin of 47-32. Independent candidate Šoip Šoipi received nearly 20% of the vote.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Boule-de-Neige is an opéra bouffe in three acts premiered in 1871 with music composed by Jacques Offenbach to a French libretto by Nuitter et Tréfeu adapted from that by Eugène Scribe and Henry Boisseaux for Barkouf (1860). The opera's title refers to a bear which becomes a ruler.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAfter the upheaval of the Franco-Prussian war and personal attacks on him, Offenbach attempted to re-launch his career with Le Roi Carotte in collaboration with Victorien Sardou; at the same time he got Nuitter and Tréfeu to write a new libretto with which he could re-use music from Barkouf., which had sunk without trace at the Opéra-Comique in 1860 after seven performances.. In a letter to the press, Nuitter pointed out that he and Tréfeu originally had an idea for an opera subject after reading the August 1871 edition of the Revue britannique which had an article on the cult of animals in Scandinavia. When Offenbach pointed out that this legend had formed the basis of Barkouf the approached the widows of Scribe and Boisseaux who agreed to an adaptation of the Barkouf libretto. Offenbach had already worked with Nuitter and Tréfeu, on single-act works Il signor Fagotto (1863), L'amour chanteur, Le fifre enchanté and Jeanne qui pleure et Jean qui rit (all 1864), Coscoletto, ou Le lazzarone (1865) and the full-length Princesse de Trébizonde just before the war. The original title was to be Balabrelock, the name of the prime minister. Offenbach was busy at this time: Le roi Carotte was premiered at the Théâtre de la Gaîté a month later, and three days after that Fantasio was first seen at the Opéra-Comique.\n\nKeck asserts that musically Boule-de-Neige inhabits a different genre to Barkouf. Boule-de-Neige has attractive numbers but is generally accessible for the audience of the Bouffes, melodic and familiar in tone as opposed to the daring harmonies in Barkouf, often surprsing from the composer. He concludes that when working for the Salle Favart, Offenbach had taken greater care with the music. Yon notes that the libretto has merit and is very amusing. The confrontation between Boule-de-Neige and three ministers in act 3 uses the musical theme \"Prenez garde! la Dame blanche regarde!\" from Boieldieu's popular opera. The device of having a man disguised as the bear while reducing the bite of the plot (from the dog in Barkouf) made the piece more acceptable to the public.\n\n\n== Performance history ==\nThe opera featured well-established Offenbach performers, such as Berthelier, Désiré, Montrouge and Thierret and the press reception was mixed. Offenbach went to Vienna and Pest to supervise productions.\nThe Dezède database records performances by an amateur group in November 2014 at the Théâtre Saint-Léon, Paris.\nTwo excerpts, including the Act 3 finale, were recorded in 2006 using an edition prepared by Jean-Christophe Keck as part of an Offenbach anthology.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe hero of the opera is a white bear called “Boule-de-Neige” (snow-ball), and the work takes place in a seemingly ungovernable kingdom in Asiatic Russia. \nThe first act is set in a market-place where the glazier Kachmir and fur merchant Schamyl  meet and discuss their loves, respectively the bear-trainer Olga and Grégorine, daughter of the senior minister Balabrelock. After another revolution in which Kachmir is nominated ruler, the Grand Khan arrives and has him arrested by the Caporal. To punish the recalcitrant city, the Khan makes the bear - who makes his entrance in a golden cage - ruler in the hope that fear of being ruled by such a ferocious creature will calm the will of a population too keen on revolutions. \nThe second act, now in a palace, has the courtiers and solicitors protected from Boule-de-Neige. When the Khan makes a surprise visit with Olga behind, she recognizes the bear as one which was stolen from her, and succeeds in calming it. The bear signs with his paw – by intermediary of his trainer Olga – increasingly grotesque decrees. It is however Olga's lover, Kachmir, in a bear-skin to evade the police, acting for the animal. Balabrelock and senior officials discover the ruse and vow to replace Boule-de-Neige. \nThe third act is in the palace gardens. Olga and Schamyl stop a conspiracy to get rid of the bear. At the moment that Olga manages to expose the plot the bear escapes and causes mayhem in the palace. The Khan, aware of the deceits and plots and rules that Olga and Kachmir should reign together and all ends well.\n\n\n== Original cast ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\nLibretto in WikiSource (in French)",

        "content": "Catterick Bridge is a historic bridge over the River Swale in North Yorkshire, in England.\nThe bridge was constructed between 1421 and 1425, with funding from William de Burgh and seven other local nobles.  In 1505, St Anne's bridge chapel was built to the east of the south end of the bridge.  The southern pillar of the bridge fell into disrepair, and in 1562 Roger Burgh and two other nobles agreed to fund repairs.  These were completed in 1590, but in 1674 the bridge was again recorded as being in poor repair.\nIn 1792, John Carr of York widened the bridge by 13 feet, on the downstream side, and demolished the chapel.  He also refaced the north and south arches on the upstream side.  In 1914, the Catterick Camp Military Railway was laid across the western carriageway of the bridge, but in 1922 a dedicated railway bridge was constructed a little further upstream.  In 1969, the bridge was grade II* listed.\n\nThe bridge now carries Catterick Road, the A6136.  It is built of sandstone and consists of three arches, slightly pointed on the older, upstream, side.  It has triangular cutwaters with hollow chamfered tops, rising to canted pedestrian retreats, a band, and parapets with triangular coping, ending in circular bollards.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGrade II* listed buildings in North Yorkshire\nListed buildings in Brough with St Giles\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Conflict between William Leyel and Bernt Pessart (Danish; Conflikten mellem Leyel og Pessart) refers to the tensions and minor civil war between Willem Leyel and Bernt Pessart over the governorship of Tranquebar and the Danish East India Company. The conflict led to the escape of Bernt Pessart, and the command at Tranquebar accepted Willem Leyel as governor of Danish India.\n\n\n== Background ==\nDuring the Age of Exploration various European nations sought to establish themselves in the Indian subcontinent to expand commerce and trade. Christian IV of Denmark (r 1588-1648) sought to expand Denmark's international presence and economy and subsequently established the Danish East India Company in 1616. In 1618, on the basis of an un-ratified treaty with Senarat of Kandy, Ove Gjedde was sent to India to establish a monopol on Ceylon. \nSenerat did no longer desire the Danish monopol when Gjedde arrived. Instead Gjedde succeded in signing a treaty with the nayak of the Thanjavurian kingdom, which by a annual tribute gave the Danes the right to the small fishing village of Tharangambadi.\n\nDuring the 1620's and 30's trade flourished, and a far-flung string of Danish factories and outposts were established in Bengal, the Coromandel Coast and Sunda Islands. Though in the late 1630's and early 40's the company would start to owe large debts, and in response governor Bernt Pessart unsuccessfully made numerous risky voyages to make money. Pessart would ignore the Danish company's most profitable contacts such as Tanjore and Makassar, and even Tranquebar which fell into chaos. Pessart would, in favour of Tranquebar, reside in Bandar which were the center of trade in plain cotton goods. Here Pessart would become involved in diamond trade.\n\n\n== Prelude ==\nBecause of the situation in India, Christian IV sent captain Willem Leyel to Dansborg to investigate the company's affairs. Leyel arrived on 5 September 1643 in Dansborg. Here he fulfilled his royal orders and investigated Tranquebar; He noticed heavy damage to Fort Dansborg and found the warehouse empty. Pessart explained that Danborg was no longer of much use, and that the warehouse was emptied to load off two ships that were sent to the Sunda Islands.\nWhen Pessart informed Leyel that he was going to Bandar, Leyel opted to join because he distrusted Pessart's intentions. When leaving tranquebar, distrusted Leyel put a couple of men loyal to him on each of Pessart's ships and left others at Dansborg.\n\n\n=== Joint voyage to Bandar ===\nWhen at sea Pessart insisted to visit the English station at Madras, where he had accounts to settle with Francis Day. Here they stayed in four days, until Leyel got impatient and gave orders to sail. When Pessart heard they were about to weight anchor he was obligated to get on board, yet was furious at Leyel's decision. On 25 September they reached Bandar, Leyel was pained to hear about the debts and credits of the Danish Company in the town. Leyel and Pessart then continued to Emeldy. Here on 10 October Pessart tried to get the vessel, The Bengali Prize nearer to shore so it could unload, yet it ran aground and was badly damaged. Pessart carelessly put up a tent and began to drink\n\n\n== Conflict ==\nOne night several men secretly came to Leyel and told him that Pessart was planning to take Valby and sail off with his men. In response on 28 October Leyel sent Jørgen Hansen with eight unarmed men over to Valby where they went on board and cut the cable. This move was a minor risk; If Pessart had found out what was happening, he might have came out of his tent with his 20 armed men and a fight might have occured, which Leyel wished to aviod.\nWith the intent to arrest Pessart, Leyel went ashore and advanced on Pessart's tent with a party of armed men. Yet when they entered the tent, they found out that Pessart had already fled with 16 men. Leyel found out, that Pessart not only had intentions to seize Valby but also to set Leyel's ship, Christianshavn, on fire. \n\n\n=== Chase of Pessart ===\nLeyel immediatly sent off Jørgen Hansen with a longboat and a strongly armed crew to try overtake Pessart's barge. Hansen did overtake Pessart during the night and shouted to Pessart that he must return and declare his arrest, to which Pessart shouted that he would rather die. Hansen now gave orders to fire on Pessart's barge, yet the heavy sea made it hard to aim properly. Hansen persued Pessart all the way to the Pedapulivarru reef, where he would give up because of Pessart's readiness to fight. Pessart would continue down to Dansborg.\n\nLeyel and his men would stay at Emeldy during monsoon, while Pessart would reach the Santhome and later Dansborg. Leyel reached Fort St. George in early April and received a warm reception by Francis Day.Fort St. George. On June 11, 1644, Leyel, with Christianshavn and Valby, reached Dansborg, yet the city showed no sign of life. Unsure of the situation, Leyel sent letters to the commander at Dansborg, Jacob von Stackenborg, and chaplain, Niels Andersen with no response. Leyel suspected that Pessart had odered to close to fort to Leyel and his men, and therefore Leyel wrote in one of his letters:\n\nYou may be sure that i will use even the most extreme measures, as is meet and proper, and to perform which i shall not lack the means … To punish rebels and perjurers, as both the Dutch and the English have promised me every assistance; still, i hope that it will not prove necessary to resort to such extreme measures.After some time Leyel was still denied access to Tranquebar, and was therefore in need of fresh provisions, so he left for Karaikal, where he would sent Portuguese Antonio Pacheco to Dansborg for negotiations. Pacheco was not well received in Dansborg, and when Leyel again anchored near Dansborg, Pacheco would successfully try to sail out to him, though under fire from Dansborg.\n\n\n=== Siege of Dansborg ===\n\nSince Dansborg was still seald off, Leyel went ashore on June 22 with 70 armed men and two guns. He was received well by the local inhabitants and the Thanjavur Nayak kingdom, who feed his soldiers and offered to help. The siege lasted for some time. Finally the commander, Frantz Erkmand came out and admitted that there now was a shortage of almost everything in Dansborg. Erkmand would surrender on the terms that he would be pardoned, which Leyel accepted.\n\nLeyel now inspected the town and fort to which he concluded that it had been left by Pessart in poor conditions. As response to the poor conditions and \nconflict with Pessart, he summoned a coincil meeting which ended in the recognition of Leyel as the new governor.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nMeanwhile Pessart had left for Japan, though he was intercepted by the Dutch of the Malacca Strait. Pessart would be imprisoned for 6 month, after which he would be sent on a joint Dano-Dutch expedition to the Spanish Philippines. When Leyel got word of this, he quickly notified the Spanish governor. Though this would be unnecessary, since Pessart would be killed by a native Philipino near the Bay of Manila.\nLeyel would now focus on the damages left by Pessart on the Danish Company. He would sent annual voyages to the Danish outposts in Bantam and Makassar, and would actively privateer against the Mughal Empire.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCattle War – Conflict between Danish India and the Thanjavur Maratha kingdom\nOve Gjedde – Danish nobleman and Admiral of the Realm\nMasulipatnam – city in Krishna district, Andhra Pradesh, IndiaPages displaying wikidata descriptions as a fallback\nConquest of Koneswaram Temple – Colonial controntation between the Portuguese and the Danish\nDano-Mughal War – Danish colonial conflict against the Mughal Empire\n\n\n== References ==",

The building was first proposed in 2016, began construction in 2019, and was completed in 2022. The building is attached to an elementary school that was built alongside the development of the tower itself.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2014, L+M Development Partners and the Paulus Hook Community Housing Corporation signed a deal for the sale of the 163-unit affordable housing Paulus Hook Towers and the adjacent parking lot. In the deal, the existing apartments were to have $3 million invested into them by L+M, including new windows and façade renovations. In exchange, L+M was allowed to develop a tower on the parking lot.\nIn 2016, a $370 million proposal by L+M Development Partners to build a 60-story tower on the site was first announced, which had been used as a parking lot for residents of the Paulus Hook Towers at 100 Montgomery Street, which would also include 750 residential units as well as retail, parking, and a public plaza, with the addition of a new public school.\nIn 2017, the city approved a version of the tower that was 52 stories, the public school, four storefronts, and a public plaza.\nIn 2019, the tower began construction, and was dubbed a new name, The Charlotte. By this point, the tower was to be built to its current 57-story height, along with other slight modifications. The development was to include 750 units, including 244 studios, 249 one-bedrooms, 224 two-bedrooms, and 33 three-bedrooms, with 37 apartments set aside for affordable housing. The building is to have 17,000 sq ft of retail space split amongst four storefronts, as well as a 36,000 sq ft elementary school, which was to be sold to Jersey City for $1. Additionally, a public plaza on the corner of Columbus Drive and Warren Street.\nIn 2022, the building was completed.\nIn 2023, the owner of the property refinanced the building for $340 million.\n\n\n== Amenities ==\nAll units within the building contain quartz-countertop kitchens with full-height backsplashes. They all include modular closets, in-unit washer and dryers, smart thermostats, and video intercom systems. Additionally, some units\nThere is a large outdoor rooftop deck with various amenities on it. This includes fire pits, grilling stations, cabanas, foosball tables, billiard tables, and an outdoor amphitheater. The building contains a 60 by 35 foot pool, which includes a spa. There is also a pet spa and dog run.\nInside the building, there are various other amenities. The building contains a fitness center, spin and yoga studios, co-working area with conference rooms, and a terrace with private dining. Additionally, the building contains lots of creative and entertainment amenities, including a makerspace, chef's kitchen, karaoke lounge, bowling alley, game room, golf simulator, and children's playroom.\nThe building is smoke-free, and contains an app that shares data on the building's energy usage and carbon footprint.\nWithin the parking garage, there are electric vehicle charging stations on each floor, as well as 375 bicycle parking spaces.\nThe building also contains a 24-hour concierge and a WiFi enabled cafe.\nHaus25 is located near two PATH stations, two Hudson-Bergen Light Rail stations, several NJTRANSIT bus stops, two Hudson-Bergen Light Rail stations, as well as two ferry stations serving the NY Waterway and Seastreak.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of tallest buildings in Jersey City\nList of tallest buildings in New Jersey\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2024 Fortaleza mayoral election will take place in the city of Fortaleza, Brazil on 6 October 2024. Voters will elect a mayor, a vice mayor, and 43 councillors. The incumbent mayor, José Sarto, a member of the Democratic Labour Party (PDT), was elected in 2020 for his first term and intends to run for reelection.\nIf the most voted candidate on the first round doesn't achieve more than 50% of the votes, a second round will happen on 27 October 2024. The mayor's term will begin on 1 January 2025 and end on 31 December 2028.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== 2020 Fortaleza mayoral election and Sarto's government ===\nThe last mayoral election in Fortaleza, held in 2020, resulted in the victory of the physician José Sarto Nogueira (PDT) in the second round. Sarto obtained 668,652 votes (51.69% of the valid votes), compared to the 624,892 votes (48.31% of the valid votes) obtained by Capitão Wagner (PROS). Sarto's victory represented the victory of a \"government of continuity\", since the incumbent mayor at the time, Roberto Cláudio, who is also a member of the party, was his main electoral canvasser throughout the election.\nStarting in January 2021, Sarto's government was disapproved by more than 50% of the citizens of Fortaleza in opinion polls, and, despite his approval ratings improved throughout 2023 due to a program of investments and interventions in the city, his government disapproval rating was ranked in fourth among the mayors of the 26 Brazilian capitals in a report published by Atlasintel in January 2024. On this opinion poll, Sarto's government was disapproved by 45% of those who were interviewed and only 25% approved his government.\n\n\n=== Electorate ===\nIn 2024, Fortaleza has 1,765,629 people eligible to vote, which corresponds to around 73% of its total population (2,428,708) according to the 2022 Brazilian demographic census. The city is divided into 17 electoral zones (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 80th, 82nd, 83rd, 85th, 93rd, 94th, 95th, 112nd, 113rd, 114th, 115th, 116th, 117th and 118th), with 669 polling stations and 5,400 electoral sections.\n\n\n== Candidates ==\n\n\n=== Presumptive candidates ===\n\nIn The Workers' Party, alongside Leitão's name, some of the party members were divided between supporting traditional names, such as Luizianne Lins, mayor of Fortaleza from 2005 to 2013 and candidate in 2016 and 2020, and some of them also supported new political figures; for example, the state deputies Larissa Gaspar and Guilherme Sampaio. The advisor of the government of Ceará, Artur Bruno, was also one of the names who were supported in the dispute.  Cid Gomes' and his allies decided to join the Brazilian Socialist Party (PSB) in February 2024, a move that made it easier for the party to support the Workers' Party candidacy; since this decision, it was announced that the Brazilian Socialist Party will nominate the running mate on the Brazil of Hope's ticket. In April 2024, Evandro Leitão obtained the support of the majority of Workers' Party delegates to be the party's nominee for mayor, defeating Luizianne Lins and the other candidates who were in the race. Since the 2022 elections, the Communist Party of Brazil (PCdoB), the Workers' Party and the Green Party (PV) joined the coalition Brazil of Hope. Their main goal is to elect more councillors with the entry of Leitão's political group into the coalition. There is also negotiations between the Workers' Party and the Social Democratic Party (PSD) to form an alliance in the 2024 elections.\n\n\n=== Workers' Party's primaries ===\nWorkers' Party (PT) – Nominee\n\nEvandro Leitão – Member of the Legislative Assembly of Ceará (2015–present).\nEliminated in primary\n\nLuizianne Lins – Councillor of Fortaleza (1997–2002); Member of the Legislative Assembly of Ceará (2003–2004); Mayor of Fortaleza (2005–2013) and Member of the Chamber of Deputies from Ceará (2015–present).\nGuilherme Sampaio – Councillor of Fortaleza (2005–2021) and Member of the Legislative Assembly of Ceará (2021; 2023).\nLarissa Gaspar – Councillor of Fortaleza (2017–2023) and Member of the Legislative Assembly of Ceará (2023–present).\nPrimaries results\n5,813 members of the Workers' Party of Fortaleza participated in the internal elections to choose a nominee for mayor. The primary was held on 7 April 2024.\n\n\n=== Potential candidates ===\nAbout two years before the election, Sarto stated that he could run for re-election as long as it was a Democratic Labour Party's decision. Throughout 2023, his candidacy was taken for granted by political figures of the party such as Roberto Cláudio, the interim national president of the party André Figueiredo and the former governor of Ceará Ciro Gomes. At the same time, Ciro's political group had internal disputes in the state directory with his own brother Cid Gomes, who is an ally of the governor Elmano de Freitas, from the Workers' Party (PT).\nElmano supported an alliance between the two parties, since this political alliance has been broken in a state level since the election for governor in 2022 (which was won by Elmano) and since 2012 in mayoral elections. This issue made some of the state deputies of Ceará support the candidacy of the president of the Legislative Assembly of Ceará, Evandro Leitão, for mayor in 2024. Since Leitão didn't had any space in the party to run for mayor, he left the Democratic Labour Party and joined the Workers' Party afterwards in order to run in the 2024 elections.\nIn February 2023, the politician Capitão Wagner, now a member of Brazil Union (UNIÃO), announced that he could run again for mayor of Fortaleza in 2024, a position for which he ran in 2016 and 2020. His optimism came from the fact that he lost the last election to Sarto by a small margin of votes and by the fact that he was also the most voted candidate in Fortaleza in the 2022 Ceará gubernatorial election. Wagner even supported an alliance with names from the conservative right in Ceará, such as the federal deputy André Fernandes, from the Liberal Party (PL), and the senator Eduardo Girão, from the New Party (NOVO). Both Fernandes and Girão announced their own candidacies in 2023. Their political groups are linked to the former president Jair Bolsonaro and to the opposition in a statewide and city level.\nAmong other parties, the Socialism and Freedom Party (PSOL) started a debate to launch their own candidacy or to invite parties and social movements to join its ticket, even though Adelita Monteiro's, a member of the party, is part of Elmano's government as a state secretary. The party announced Técio Nunes as a candidate in February 2024. The parties that are aligned with the Socialism and Freedom Party are the Brazilian Communist Party (PCB) and Sustainability Network (REDE); a party which is aligned with the socialists in the PSOL REDE Federation.\nBrazil Union (UNIÃO)\n\nCapitão Wagner – Member of the Legislative Assembly of Ceará (2011–2012; 2015–2018); Member of the Municipal Chamber of Fortaleza (2013–2014) and Member of the Chamber of Deputies from Ceará (2019–2023).\nDemocratic Labour Party (PDT)\n\nJosé Sarto – Councillor of Fortaleza (1989–1995); President of the Municipal Chamber of Fortaleza (1990–1992); Member of the Legislative Assembly of Ceará (1995–2020); President of the Legislative Assembly of Ceará (2019–2020) and Mayor of Fortaleza (2021–present).\nLiberal Party (PL)\n\nAndré Fernandes – Member of the Legislative Assembly of Ceará (2019–2023) and Member of the Chamber of Deputies from Ceará (2023–present).\nNew Party (NOVO)\n\nEduardo Girão – Senator for Ceará (2019–present).\nSocialism and Liberty Party (PSOL)\n\nTécio Nunes – Cultural entrepreneur.\n\n\n== Electoral calendar ==\n\n\n== Outgoing Municipal Chamber ==\nThe result of the last municipal election and the current situation in the Municipal Chamber is given below:\n\n\n== Opinion polls ==\n\n\n=== First round ===\n2024\n\n2023\n\n\n=== Second round ===\nCapitão Wagner and Luizianne Lins\n\nCapitão Wagner and José Sarto\n\nCapitão Wagner and Evandro Leitão\n\nJosé Sarto and André Fernandes\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Dardo (\"Dart\") was an Italian Lampo-class destroyer. Commissioned into service in the Italian Regia Marina (Royal Navy) in 1901, she served in the Italo-Turkish War and World War I. She was stricken in 1920.\n\n\n== Construction and commissioning ==\nDardo was laid down at the Schichau-Werke in Elbing in the German Empire on 17 August 1899. She was launched on 7 February 1900 and completed on 16 March 1901. She was commissioned in March 1901.\nDardo and her five sister ships formed the first class of destroyers built for the Regia Marina, their only predecessor, Fulmine, having been a one-off. Designed by the German Schichau-Werke shipyard, they were seaworthy, robust, fast, and reliable, although they were afflicted by serious problems with seakeeping. \n\n\n== Service history ==\n\n\n=== Italo-Turkish War ===\nDardo participated actively in the Italo-Turkish War, which began on 29 September 1911 with the Kingdom of Italy′s declaration of war on the Ottoman Empire. On 13 November 1911 she conducted a reconnaissance of the Ottoman Libyan coast up to the border with Tunisia, finding no smugglers but bombarding and damaging the Ottoman fort of Forona. On 17 November 1911 she opened fire on a group of Arabs near Zuara on the coast of Ottoman Tripolitania, putting them to flight. On 22 November 1911 she captured two boats loaded with supplies and ammunition off Zanzur on the coast of Ottoman Tripolitania, and on 27 November 1911 she bombarded and destroyed an Ottoman guard post in Falena in Ottoman Libya. The war ended on 18 October 1912 in an Italian victory.\n\n\n=== 1913–1914 ===\nOn 29 January 1913, amid high political tension between Italy and the Ottoman Empire, Dardo escorted the battleships of the 1st Division (Regina Elena, Roma, and Vittorio Emanuele) from La Spezia to Augusta, Sicily. On 1 February 1913, she escorted the three battleships from Augusta to Syracuse, Sicily.\nIn August 1914, with the Principality of Albania shaken by revolts and inter-ethnic conflicts, Italy, which aimed to occupy strategic points on the Albanian coast, sent Dardo, under the command of Capitano di corvetta (Corvette Captain) Bernotti, and the torpedo cruiser Agordat to the Albanian port of Vlorë (known to the Italians as Valona), where they \"showed the flag\" and contributed to the protection of Albanian refugees from riots that broke out in the city. On 31 October 1914, Dardo brought Contrammiraglio (Counter Admiral) Patris to the Albanian island of Sazan (known to the Italians as Saseno), and Patris took possession of the island on behalf of the Kingdom of Italy.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\n\nWorld War I broke out in 1914, and the Kingdom of Italy entered the war on the side of the Allies with its declaration of war on Austria-Hungary on 23 May 1915. At the time, Dardo, still under Bernotti′s command, and the destroyers Euro, Lampo, Ostro, and Strale made up the 4th Destroyer Squadron, under the command of Capitano di fregata (Frigate Captain) F. Gambardella. Dardo was based at Vlorë. By 1915, the Lampo-class destroyers were of antiquated design and had only limited military usefulness, but during World War I, they were modified, having equipment installed to carry and lay 12 mines, drop depth charges, and tow explosive paravanes. The Lampo-class ships spent the war on escort duty.\nAt the end of 1915, Dardo collided with the Italian submarine Velella, which suffered sigaificant damage and required drydocking for repairs.\nDardo continued her World War I service without taking part in any significant actions. By late October 1918, Austria-Hungary had effectively disintegrated, and the Armistice of Villa Giusti, signed on 3 November 1918, went into effect on 4 November 1918 and brought hostilities between Austria-Hungary and the Allies to an end. World War I ended a week later with an armistice between the Allies and the German Empire on 11 November 1918.\n\n\n=== Post-World War I ===\nDardo was stricken from the naval register in either January or March 1924. She was discarded on 18 March 1920 and subsequently was scrapped.\n\n\n== References ==",

The 6 who receive the fewest votes move into the Villa to compete with another 64 candidates (including both celebrities and civilians) for the remaining 10 spots, bringing the total number of contestants up to 20. \n\n\n=== Stage 2 ===\nIn the Villa, the 70 candidates live in three houses (starting with 32 in the Orange house, 22 in the Blue house and 16 in the Green house), having to share beds and limited supplies for 12 days, while facing a series of challenges and mass evictions. The last 20 to survive in the Villa compete in the final challenge, in which the public decides whether the winner secures a place in the next stage of the game. Then, the remaining candidates face the final public vote for the last spots in the Mansion.\nOn May 7, 2023, 5 celebrities were announced in advance: Nathan Camargo, Hulk Magrelo, Blade, Fernanda Medrado and Natália Deodato. While a few others were also spotted during the preview, the full lineup was only revealed during the series premiere.\n\n\n=== Stage 3 ===\nThe 20 selected contestants move into the Mansion on week 2. Each week, two contestants become the Mansion's owners and delegate the weekly tasks, while three contestants are voted into the Risk Zone (the Owners' nominee, the Secret vote nominee between the two Owners and the Mansion's face-to-face vote nominee among all eligible contestants), where they compete in the Safety challenge to escape eviction.\nThe Safety winner is exempt from nominations, however, they must replace themselves with another contestant of their choice in order to determine that week's set of nominees who would face the public vote.\n\n\n== Contestants ==\n\n\n== Future Appearances ==\nIn 2023, Erick Ricarte appeared in the Warehouse of A Fazenda 15, which didn't enter.\n\n\n== The game ==\n\n\n=== Owner selection's results ===\n\n\n=== Tasks ===\n\n\n=== Voting history ===\n\n\n==== Notes ====\n\n\n== Ratings and reception ==\n\n\n=== Brazilian ratings ===\nAll numbers are in points and provided by Kantar Ibope Media.\n\nIn 2023, each point represents 268.083 households in 15 market cities in Brazil (76.953 households in São Paulo).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nA Grande Conquista 1 on R7.com",

        "content": "Canout Theatre (Spanish: Teatro Canout) is a theatre located at Petit Thouars Avenue in Miraflores District, Lima, Peru. It was inaugurated on March 24, 1954, as a cinema-theatre, and since then it has been the scene of a wide variety of shows, from film screenings to plays, concerts and cultural events. Set to be closed and demolished in 2021 due to the economic effects of the then-ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Peru, it was rented by two local comedians and purchased two years later.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe story of Canout begins in mid-1936, when Clara Canout Cevallos, widow of Muro, from Lima, daughter of a French engineer who settled in Peru after installing rice mills, made a promise to her father that she would make his surname last. in the time. Such a promise could be carried out thanks to the fact that she was co-heir to one of the largest fortunes in the department of Lambayeque, coming from her father-in-law, Francisco Muro Niño Ladrón de Guevara, a landowner in Ferreñafe. Under the financial support of the testamentary Muro, during a trip to Paris, Clara had the idea of installing a cinema-theatre behind her mansion that would bear her father's last name.\nSince it opened its doors, the Canout experienced resounding success, becoming one of the most prominent cinema-theatres in Lima. In addition, various theatrical performances, concerts and cultural activities were offered on this stage. In 1979, the theatre underwent a transformation when it stopped showing films and became a dedicated exclusively to plays. Since then, it has been the scene of a wide variety of shows, from classic plays to independent productions.\nIn 2021, the theatre was on the verge of being demolished due to high maintenance costs and the inability of the then owner, Efraín Aguilar, to pay for them. However, it managed to be preserved thanks to the initiative of comedians Jorge Luna and Ricardo Mendoza, who rented the place to present and record their online show. Later, under the direction of their production company, they continued to perform other shows at the theatre. Finally, years later, they made its purchase official.\nCurrently, despite being a private property that serves as a venue for shows produced by its owners, the theatre is also rented for theatrical performances and various cultural events.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTheatre in Peru\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Embassy of Sweden, The Hague is the diplomatic mission of Sweden in The Hague. The Netherlands is the first country with which Sweden exchanged permanent ambassadors, a relationship established in 1614. The embassy's primary role is to monitor, represent, and advance Swedish interests within the Netherlands and international organizations based in The Hague. Its responsibilities include providing services to Swedish authorities, businesses, organizations, and citizens. The embassy regularly reports to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in Stockholm, offering insights into political and economic developments, as well as the country's stance on global events. A key focus is promoting Swedish economic interests by aiding Swedish companies and attracting foreign investments to Sweden, collaborating closely with Business Sweden in The Hague and the Swedish Chamber of Commerce in Amsterdam. Additionally, the embassy handles consular matters. It also engages in promoting Sweden through seminars, exhibitions, and cultural events.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1614–1869 ===\nDuring the 17th century, Sweden established its first permanent embassies, although temporary diplomatic assignments had been common prior to this period. The inaugural permanent embassy was established in The Hague during the reign of Gustav II Adolf. The choice of the Netherlands was logical, given the significant importance of the bilateral relations to Sweden's foreign policy. In April 1614, a peace and friendship treaty was ratified between Sweden and the Netherlands, stipulating, among other provisions, the exchange of ambassadors. Jacob van Dijck (1567–1631), a seasoned diplomat with Dutch roots who had participated in the negotiations leading to the treaty, was appointed as Sweden's first ambassador to the Netherlands. Van Dyk's primary objective as ambassador was to negotiate loans essential for Sweden's payment of the Älvsborg Ransom. Following the Treaty of Knäred in 1613, Sweden had incurred substantial debts to Denmark to regain control of the Älvsborg Castle. Additionally, funds were required to support Sweden's military campaign in Poland during that period. van Dijck successfully secured Dutch loans, but encountered difficulties during the repayment process, leading to his recall by Gustav II Adolf in 1620.\nNils Gyldenstolpe's familiarity with European, particularly Dutch, affairs was a key factor in his appointment as the Swedish envoy to The Hague in 1679. The Hague, known as a hub of European politics, held significant importance in Swedish diplomacy during that period. Gyldenstolpe's tenure in The Hague coincided with a pivotal shift in Swedish foreign policy towards an anti-French stance, spearheaded by the new President of the Court of Chancery Bengt Gabrielsson Oxenstierna. In 1681, Gyldenstolpe played a pivotal role in cementing this shift by negotiating the crucial guarantee treaty between Sweden and Holland, later joined by the Emperor and Spain. Additionally, he contributed to the formulation of a specialized convention in 1683, which further delineated the provisions of the guarantee treaty. In 1686, Gyldenstolpe facilitated the renewal of alliances and trade pacts between Sweden and Holland.\nDuring the Age of Liberty (1719–1772), the Swedish diplomatic mission in The Hague lost much of its political significance but emerged as a hub for Sweden's commercial and technological knowledge. Joachim Fredrik Preis, with his extensive legal and practical expertise and wide-ranging connections, provided valuable insights to the Swedish government and the National Boards of Trade and Mines. He had a critical eye for the often fantastical plans that arose and showed a keen interest in fisheries, contributing to the establishment of a Swedish fishing company. Preis partially influenced the fishing regulations of the 1750s, drawing on Dutch models. He also relayed knowledge of new technology to Sweden, including detailed descriptions of steam engine technology for mine water pumping. Emanuel Swedenborg likely discussed similar matters with Joachim Fredrik Preis during a trip to the Netherlands in the 1720s.\nCarl Johan Creutz was appointed as Sweden's representative to the States General of the Netherlands in 1760 due to his extensive service in the country. However, he faced criticism for not meeting expectations in his early dispatches. Gustav III replaced him with a younger diplomat due to his preference for a more personal approach. Creutz's dispatches during his tenure contained mainly political rumors from The Hague. He authored three reports on the Netherlands, particularly focusing on the years 1765 and 1769, providing a comprehensive account of the Dutch Republic's affairs.\nEmanuel de Geer efficiently managed state loan transactions and trade negotiations in the Dutch Republic, despite their lack of direct political significance. Elis Schröderheim praised his mission to The Hague, noting its importance and benefits. De Geer's keen observation of political shifts in The Hague proved crucial, especially in the late 1770s when the Netherlands and Sweden aimed to protect trade against English privateers. However, his lavish household in The Hague drained his resources, pushing him to the brink of ruin. Coupled with health issues aggravated by the country's climate, he took leave in February 1779 and resigned from his ministerial post later that year.\nGustaf Johan Ehrensvärd was offered the ministerial post in The Hague in July 1779, formally settling by the turn of 1780. Despite concerns about his finances, he received a gratuity and started his diplomatic mission in September 1780. His role involved negotiating the potential accession of the Netherlands to the Nordic armed neutrality during the Anglo-French War. In September 1781, he requested six months' leave to return home but was instead asked to travel to Paris, though he stayed in The Hague due to conflicting responses from his superior. Ehrensvärd played no major political role and was transferred to the ministerial post in Berlin in April 1782.\nDuring his time in The Hague (1816–1834), Abraham Constantin Mouradgea d'Ohsson served as a capable diplomat for Sweden. He was known for his skillful and loyal approach to his duties. One notable achievement was his handling of the dispute over Prince Gustav's title in 1828, where he demonstrated both firmness and tact. Overall, his tenure in The Hague was marked by effective diplomacy and earned him a reputation as one of Sweden's finest diplomats of the 19th century.\n\n\n=== 1869–present ===\nFrom 1869, the legation in Brussels, Belgium was shared with The Hague, located in the latter city and covering both states. Until 1921, the minister in Brussels had a dual accreditation in The Hague. In 1921 the position was divided, and a Swedish minister was accredited to The Hague. The reason was that the embassy position in The Hague has gained new importance due to the permanent location of the Permanent Court of International Justice there. Special qualifications in international law and related aspects of international politics were therefore necessary for the incumbent of this position to fully fulfill their duties.\nFrom 1 April 1944, Gunnar Hägglöf served as envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to the Belgian government in exile and the Dutch government-in-exile in London. In 1945, it was reported that Gunnar Hägglöf would completely transfer to The Hague, and the position in Brussels would be filled again.\nIn September 1956, due to agreements between the Swedish and Dutch governments regarding the mutual elevation of their missions to embassies, envoy Sven Dahlman was appointed as ambassador. On 11 October 1956, Ambassador Dahlman presented his credentials as ambassador to Queen Juliana at the Huis ten Bosch palace in The Hague.\n\n\n== Tasks and staff ==\nThe embassy works to monitor, represent and promote Swedish interests in all areas in the Netherlands and within the international organizations in The Hague. The embassy's duties consist of providing services to Swedish authorities, businesses, organizations, and individual citizens. Regular reports are sent to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in Stockholm with information and analyses of, for example, political and economic developments and the country's stance on international events. A prioritized task for the embassy is to promote Swedish economic interests by assisting Swedish companies and encouraging foreign investments in Sweden. In this area, the embassy works closely with Business Sweden in The Hague and the Swedish Chamber of Commerce in Amsterdam. Another part of the embassy's work involves consular issues, meaning assistance to Swedish citizens abroad who have, for example, been victims of crime or lost their passports. Informing about Sweden is also included in the embassy's duties. This is done, for example, through seminars, exhibitions, and cultural events.\nThe embassy staff consists of the ambassador, minister counsellor, three first secretaries, defence attaché, trade secretary, as well as locally employed staff in the form of assistant to the defence attaché, caretaker/receptionist, ambassador's secretary, receptionist/consular officer, officer for communication, culture and Sweden promotion, and a treasurer.\n\n\n== Buildings ==\n\n\n=== Chancery ===\nFrom 1869 to 1921, the Swedish legation in Brussels was shared with The Hague and thus the chancery was located in Brussels. With the German occupation of Brussels in 1916, the mission moved to Hotel des Indes in The Hague, Netherlands, which was neutral during the war. Here it stayed until 1918 before returning to Brussels in 1919. From 1920, a chancery was operating in the The Hague. In 1920, the chancery was situated at Mauritskade 73 in The Hague Center. From 1921 to 1922, it was situated at Wassenaarschekade 8 On 1 Augusti 1922, the chancery moved to Koninginnegracht 53. It remained here until 1930.\nFrom 1931 to 1940, the chancery was situated at Lange Voorhout 28. From 1940 to 1947, no adress was given. From 1948 to 1968, the chancery was situated at Jan van Nassaustraat 26 in the neighborhood of Benoordenhout in the district of Haagse Hout. From 1969 to at least 1979, the chancery was situated a few blocks away at Neuhuyskade 40. The chancery later moved to Johan de Wittlaan 7 in the Zorgvliet neighborhood where it remains today.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Residence ===\n\nThe residence at Lange Voorhout 28 in the old city centre of The Hague was acquired by the Swedish state in 1929 for 120,000 SEK, which, according to the National Board of Public Building (Byggnadsstyrelsen), was considered advantageous even considering that some modernizations and repairs needed to be undertaken at a cost of around 63,000 SEK. The proposal for the property purchase came from the Swedish minister Patrick Adlercreutz. The architect Peder Clason conducted the inspection of the property. In addition to the main house, there was a recent addition constructed on the courtyard, consisting of one floor, which housed a dining room and more.\"\nConstructed in 1736, the building is one of many private residences built along the street Lange Voorhout, \"the long forest,\" by members of Holland's leading families. The name originates from the medieval period when there was a forested area here, just outside the city limits and adjacent to the ramparts around the castle. Like several properties along Lange Voorhout from that period, the residence has been greatly influenced by the buildings of the French-born architect Daniel Marot in The Hague. In 1962, the property was expanded through the purchase of Lange Voorhout 30 and 32, as well as additional buildings at the back with facades facing Kazernestraat 35–37. This purchase also included access to a larger garden. Kazernestraat 35–37 is standing two stories high, with garages and storage spaces. The intervening garden is approximately 600 square meters. Since 1967, Lange Voorhout 28 has been listed as a national heritage site.\nThe residence's baroque facade in red brick facing Lange Voorhout bears clear traces of Louis XIV and France. The influence of the French king also characterizes the interior, with state rooms modeled after French town palaces featuring wall paintings, fireplaces, and ceilings adorned with stucco ornaments. The residence comprises four residential floors and a basement. The ground floor is often used for receptions. The two floors above are the ambassador's private residence. The staircase hall features marble pilasters, an aged balustrade, an oak staircase, and light filtering in from a roof lantern, originally designed to admit light from skylights but now supplemented with electric lighting. Hanging in the staircase are plaster medallions with profile portraits of famous Swedes from the 18th century.\nOver the years under Swedish ownership, the residence has undergone maintenance and improvements. A renovation completed in 1993, designed by architects Bo Myrenberg and Hando Kask, included the installation of district heating, a new kitchen and laundry room, as well as a wine cellar and storage spaces. The facade has been regularly renovated, and in 2006, the entire garden was redesigned. During the renovation, only one tree remained in the garden, around which the new garden was designed. In 2012-2013, the reception area was renovated, including radiator replacement and extensive painting work. A careful renovation was undertaken in 2015 with the assistance of White Arkitekter.\n\n\tLange Voorhout 28\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Heads of Mission ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nNetherlands–Sweden relations\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nStal, Kess; Sillén, Katarina af; Dumas, Charles, eds.

        "content": "Jane Bruce Guignard (October 30, 1876 – January 11, 1963) was an American physician, suffragist, and philanthropist, based in South Carolina.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nGuignard was born in Aiken County, South Carolina, the daughter of John Gabriel Guignard and Jane Bruce Salley Guignard. Her father was a Confederate States Army veteran of the American Civil War. She was a student at The College for Women in Columbia in Columbia, South Carolina, and trained for teaching at Peabody College in Tennessee. She graduated from the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania in 1904. Writer Frances Guignard Gibbes was a cousin. \n\n\n== Career ==\nGuignard taught in Columbia as a young woman. She was one of the city's first women physicians, beginning her practice there in 1905, specializing on obstetrics and pediatrics. She was also physician on staff at the College for Women and Columbia College. Delivering babies at home exposed her to the health risks faced by the city's poorer residents, and she opened a small maternity home in the 1920s. She worked with Columbia Hospital to improve services for women and children, and created a training program for black midwives. She was a member of the Medical Women's National Association.\nGuignard was president of the Columbia Equal Suffrage League. After suffrage was won, she was co-founder of the Columbia League of Women Voters, and state chair of the Social Hygiene Department of the South Carolina League of Women Voters. She wrote an open letter to a mayoral candidate about vice in Columbia in 1922. She was active in Altrusa, and was honored by the local chapter in 1959, for her many years of service to the community.\nGuignard gave eugenic cautions about mate selection along with other prenatal advice in a lecture at a community baby clinic in 1924. Matilda Evans, a Black woman physician in Columbia, admired Guignard as a colleague, saying Guignard was one \"whose soul is in the work of caring for and helping suffering humanity.\" \nGuignard and her sister Caroline funded a lecture series at the University of South Carolina as a memorial to their brother, Gabriel Alexander Guignard, who died in 1926. Late in life, Guignard donated a family property called Still Hopes to the local Episcopal diocese to use as a retirement home. She attended the ground-breaking for Trinity Home, as the project was named, in 1960.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nGuignard died from leukemia in 1963, at the age of 86, in Columbia, South Carolina. Still Hopes Retirement Community remains in operation as of 2024, with the skilled nursing portion of the facilities named for Jane Bruce Guignard.\n\n\n== References ==",

He totalled 219 games and 30 goals in Serie A for Udinese, Fiorentina, Catania and Atalanta.\n\n\n== Career ==\nMilan was born in Mirano, Province of Venice. He began his career at nearby Venezia in Serie B from 1956 to 1959. His first Serie A season was 1959–60 with ten goals for Udinese, earning a move to Fiorentina.\nWith Fiorentina, Milan won the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in its inaugural edition, 1960–61. In the two-legged final against Rangers of Scotland, he scored both goals of the first leg in Glasgow, plus one more in the 2–1 win in the second leg. It was the first time that an Italian team won a UEFA competition. In the same season, he was top scorer with four goals as they won the Coppa Italia, including against Juventus (semi-final) and Lazio (final).\nMilan left Fiorentina in 1962, and following one year with Catania, he joined Atalanta for a six-season spell. From 1973 to 1990 he worked as a manager, starting at Olbia and Prato.\nMilan died on 8 December 2023, two days before his 86th birthday. Atalanta wore black armbands in his memory the following day. His funeral took place at the Chiesa dei Sette Santi Fondatori (Firenze).\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Aubrey Gardner Weaver (October 12, 1882 – March 11, 1944, nicknamed \"Kingfish\") was a Virginia lawyer and politician who served in both houses of the Virginia General Assembly.\n\n\n== Early and family life ==\nThe third generation of his family to live in Front Royal, he was the middle of three sons born to the former Emma Hanson (1851-1920) and her husband William Cass Weaver Sr. (1849-1934). His eldest brother, William C. Weaver Jr. (1879-1941) became a merchant, and their sister Mattie Grey Weaver (1888-1904) died as a teenager. The youngest brother, Henry Byrne Weaver (1883-1956) proved the longest-lived. After a primary education nearby, Weaver enrolled at Randolph Macon Academy and then completed his legal studies at the University of Virginia Law School.\nHe married Pearl Davis Kenner and they had two daughters who survived their parents. Evelyn Hanson Weaver Carson (1906-1999) married Irish immigrant Joseph Malcolm Carson (1901-1991) who rose to become a Rear Admiral in the U.S. Navy during World War II and the Korean conflict. Her sister Winnie Davis Weaver Nicholls (1914-1977) remained in Front Royal after her marriage.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAfter admission to the Virginia bar, Weaver practiced in Front Royal, the Warren County seat, as well as in adjoining counties, ultimately becoming president of the State Board of Law Examiners. He was also active in the Masons, Shriners, and Odd Fellows, and became an honorary member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars.\nA Democrat and member of the Byrd Organization, Weaver first won election to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1911, representing Warren and adjoining Clarke counties part-time beginning in the session that began the following January. He won re-election, but after the 1915 election was succeeded by Kenneth Newcomer Gilpin of Clarke County. Weaver was a presidential elector in 1916, and he voted for Virginia-born Woodrow Wilson, and also attended the Democratic National Conventions in 1928 and 1932. As the Great Depression began, Weaver won election to the Virginia Senate, representing a district in the middle of the Shenandoah Valley, including  Page, Rappahannock, Rockingham, and Warren Countiese as well as Harrisonburg. Voters re-elected him until his death.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nWeaver died in 1944 and was buried in the family plot in Prospect Hill cemetery in Front Royal.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) is a medical condition in which acute psychological stress can trigger a transient myocardial ischemia, which is a state of reduced blood flow to the heart muscle, often without the presence of significant coronary artery disease (CAD). It is distinct from conventional stress ischemia caused by physical exertion or pharmacological agents. MSIMI is often silent and detected through specific cardiac function tests during mental stress challenges.\n\n\n== Mechanism ==\nThe condition involves abnormal microvascular vasoreactivity and inflammation, with increased brain activity in regions that modulate autonomic nervous system reactivity to emotional stress, depression, anxiety. Emotional responses and certain psychological traits may influence the occurrence of MSIMI. MSIMI can occur at lower cardiac workloads, independent of hemodynamic changes, and is not directly related to the severity of angiographic CHD. It can occur in patients with normal cardiac stress testing and is often silent.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\nMSIMI is associated with a twofold increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) compared to those without MSIMI. It is particularly prevalent among young women with myocardial infarction (MI) and those with psychological comorbidities.\nStudies have found that young women who have had a myocardial infarction are twice as likely to develop mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) compared to men of similar age.\n\n\n== Diagnostics ==\nVarious techniques like electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiography, and positron emission tomography (PET) are used to assess MSIMI. The incidence of MSIMI has varied across studies due to different assessment methods and mental stressors.\n\n\n== Treatment ==\nCurrent research focuses on understanding stress pathways in CAD and integrating mental health, behavioral medicine with routine cardiology care to improve patient outcomes.\n\n\n== Epidemiology ==\nApproximately 30% of CAD patients experience MSIMI under mental stress, which typically is silent and not related to the severity of CAD.\n\n\n== See also ==\nEndothelial dysfunction\n\n\n== Referencs ==",

        "content": "Kenneth Newcomer Gilpin (February 14, 1890 – June 21, 1947) was a military aviator in both World War I and World War II, as well as served three-terms in the Virginia House of Delegates and bred thoroughbred horses.\n\n\n== Early and family life and military service ==\nBorn in Baltimore to the former Hattie Newcomer (an heiress) and her merchant husband Henry Brooke Gilpin. His father's family could trace their ancestry to the American Revolutionary War and a farm near Bedford, Pennsylvania, as well as the distinguished Brooke family of Maryland. By 1907 his mother desired a country estate, and the family moved to Clarke County, Virginia within four years, after noted Baltimore architect Howard Sill constructed a massive mansion in the America Country Movement style, called Scaleby after the ancestral Gilpin family estate in Britain. Kenneth received a private education suitable to his class, first at Gilman's School, then St. James School. He then traveled to Charlottesville to study at the University of Virginia.\nGilpin met Isabella McGhee Tyson, sister of his classmate and friend McGhee Tyson, whom he married before traveling to Europe to fight in World War I. Their father was a West Point graduate descended from Virginia gentry who became a Tennessee manufacturer (upon marrying an heiress) and rose to become Brigadier General during World War I and later U.S. Senator. Both McGhee Tyson and Kenneth Gilpin became military aviators during the conflict. However, McGhee Tyson died after crashing into the North Sea a month before the armistice. Gilpin would name his son McGhee Tyson Gilpin (1919-2000) after his friend (and both father and son would serve in the U.S. Army in World War II, Gilpin as Major in the Air Corps and his McGhee Gilpin as Captain in Army Intelligence). Their other son was Kenneth N. Gilpin II (1923-1996), who became an actor after his military service. Their daughter Betty Brooke Gilpin was born in 1935. His granddaughter (McGhee Gilpin's daughter), Drew Gilpin Faust would become President of Harvard University.\n\n\n== Career ==\nUpon moving to Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, Gilpin bred horses, and was also active in veterans' organization, the Episcopal Church, Blue Ridge Hunt Club, Blue Ridge County Club, Commonwealth Club and Maryland Club.\nVoters from Clarke and adjacent Warren county elected him as their representative in the Virginia House of Delegates in 1915, and re-elected him until 1922.\nAfter retiring from politics, Gilpin concentrated on breeding thoroughbred racehorses. Although the Scaleby estate was once 200 acres, by 1941, when he helped found the Virginia Thoroughbred Association and became its first president, he listed his address as the approximately 50 acre Kentmere estate.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nGilpin died on June 21, 1947, during a business trip to Manhattan in New York City. His remains were returned to Virginia, where they were buried in historic Old Chapel cemetery in Millwood. His son McGhee Gilpin would continue the family's thoroughbred breeding enterprises while residing at Lakeville nearby. Scaleby remained owned by Gilpin's descendants until 1986, was placed on the Virginia Landmark Register and National Register for Historic Places in 1990, and is now in the Chapel Rural Historic District. The Gilpin family papers are held by the University of North Carolina.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Mieko Chikappu (チカップ 美恵子 Chikappu Mieko, also rendered as Chikkap or Cikap Mieko, September 9, 1948 – February 5, 2010), born Mieko Iga(伊賀 美恵子 Iga Mieko), was an Ainu embroiderer, artist, poet, essayist, and Indigenous activist. She was born in the city of Kushiro on the island of Hokkaido, Japan. \"Chikappu\" is a rendering of the Ainu language word \"cikap\" (チカㇷ゚) meaning \"bird.\"\n\n\n== Biography ==\nChikappu was born in Kushiro to an Ainu family. Her uncle was the well-known Ainu elder (ekasi) Tasuke Yamamoto. From childhood, she learned Ainu embroidery as well as the Ainu folk music called upopo from her mother, the poet Fude Iga. Her older brother, Kazuaki Yamamoto, was also an Ainu activist. As a girl, she appeared in the 1963–1964 NHK-produced documentary film series The World of the Yukar (ユーカラの世界 Yūkara no sekai).\nMoving to Tokyo, she began work as a colorist for animated works. Later, in 1983, she was one of the founders of the Rera Association for the Consideration of the Present of the Ainu People (アイヌ民族の現在を考えるレラの会 Ainu minzoku no genzai o kangaeru rera no kai)—eventually renamed to the Rera Assocation (レラの会 Rera no kai)—an association of ethnic Ainu living in the Tokyo area, and became heavily involved in Ainu rights movements. Around this time, she also started to make a living as a well-known embroidery artist of Ainu patterns, and eventually moved to Sapporo.\nEarlier, in 1969, a scholarly book called Ainu Ethnography (アイヌ民族誌 Ainu minzokushi) was published, in which a photograph of Chikappu as a young girl in Ainu clothing was used without permission with the caption describing the Ainu as a \"dying race\" (horobiyuku minzoku). When she learned of this, she wrote a letter of protest to the authors of the book, including the well-known Hokkaido poet Genzō Sarashina. Unsatisfied with their apology, in 1985 she filed a lawsuit against the authors and publishing company of this book for defamation and the violation of her portrait rights, a landmark case that came to be known as the \"Ainu People Portrait Rights Trial\" (アイヌ民族肖像権裁判 Ainu minzoku shōzōken saiban). The case was settled in 1988 with an apology to Chikappu and further conditions. The case caused a stir in Japan and started conversations regarding the state of ethnological and anthropological research on the Ainu people.\nShe continued to publish books and speak publically about the dignity of the Ainu people, the establishment of their official status as an Indigenous people, and other issues from an Ainu perspective. Many of her writings centered on explaining the depth of Ainu culture, particularly embroidery. Other writings indicted modern Japan's exploitation and oppression of the Ainu. In regards to the Kuril Islands dispute, unlike the views of the dominant Ainu organization, the Hokkaido Utari Association, Chikkap and her association took the position of condemning Japan for driving the Ainu out of these \"northern territories\" in the 19th century and demanding their return. She was also an active participant in Peace Boat, a Japan-based non-government organization.\nFrom April 13 to June 27, 2012, an exhibition of her works entitled \"Mieko Chikappu Exhibition: From the World of Ainu Pattern Embroidery and Poetry\" (Chikappu Mieko ten~Ainu mon'yō shishū to shi no sekai kara~) was held at the Kushiro Art Museum, Hokkaido in her hometown of Kushiro.\n\n\n== References ==",

It ran between 1985 and 2001 featuring Chet Baker, Hubert Laws, Little Richard, Chuck Berry, BB King, Al Green, James Brown, Etta James, Nina Simone, Chick Corea, Sarah Vaughan, Pat Metheny, Toots Thielemans, Bobby McFerrin, Sonny Rollins, Ernie Watts, Joe Pass, and McCoy Tyner and Stanley Jordan alongside Brazilian musicians Moacir Santos, Heraldo do Monte, Egberto Gismonti, Uakti, Marcio Montarroyos, Paulo Moura, and Sivuca.\nThe festival was founded by Monique and Sylvia Gardenberg, two sisters from Rio de Janeiro new on the Brazilian music scene. They secured sponsorship from Pan Am and the tobacco company Souza Cruz, a subsidiary of British-American Tobaccos, who made “Free” cigarettes, naming the festival Free Jazz Festival.\nThe success of the festival increased sales of jazz records in Brazil, influencing EMI and WEA Brazil  to release more American jazz artists and Brazilian instrumental musicians.\nThe Free Jazz Festival was forced to close due to the anti-smoking laws.\n\n\n== References ==",

Azzarello posted a manifesto to his Substack before the incident, describing his intent to bring attention to a \"totalitarian con\" and that the U.S. government is \"about to hit us with an apocalyptic fascist world coup.\"\nHe traveled from his Florida home to New York just days before the trial. Before setting himself on fire, Azzarello threw leaflets into the air. He had also protested with signs the day before and gave an interview critical of the American government. Officers arrived after a few minutes and extinguished the blaze before he was loaded into an ambulance and taken to Weill Cornell Medical Center, where he died hours later.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of political self-immolations\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Didier Segers (born 21 February 1965) is a Belgian former footballer who played as a defender or midfielder.\nHe spent his entire career playing in Belgium, featuring in the Belgian Pro League for Lierse, Antwerp, Mechelen and Lommel. With Antwerp, he played in the 1993 European Cup Winners' Cup final. After his career, he suffered from financial problems and alcoholism.\n\n\n== Career ==\nSegers was born in Berchem-Sainte-Agathe in the Brussels Capital Region and raised in nearby Molenbeek by his father. As a child, he felt that he was too overweight to be a footballer, so he ran and cycled to lose 10 kilograms. In 1984, he transferred from his local R.W.D. Molenbeek to K. Stade Leuven in the third division.\nSegers moved to the second division club Lierse S.K. where he achieved promotion to the Belgian Pro League and a transfer to Royal Antwerp F.C. in 1992 for a fee of 35 million Belgian francs, roughly equivalent to €1 million. He and Francis Severeyns were the only two players signed by manager Walter Meeuws that summer, as he did not want to make changes to his squad. He contributed to the team finishing as runners-up in the 1992–93 European Cup Winners' Cup, with a goal in a 4–2 second round win away to FC Admira Wacker Mödling in Austria and marking Valery Karpin in a semi-final win over FC Spartak Moscow. He played in the final., a 3–1 loss to Parma AC at the original Wembley Stadium.\nAfter the end of his Antwerp contract in 1994, Segers spent most of the rest of his career at K.V. Mechelen and Lommel S.K.. He never left Belgian football, but had an offer from Dutch club Willem II during his Lierse days, falling through due to a broken foot. In March 2003, Lommel forfeited with 11 games remaining due to bankruptcy, and their players were given permission to join new clubs; Segers joined Tempo Overijse of the fourth division but suffered a knee injury three minutes into his debut, and retired aged 38.\n\n\n== Post-playing career ==\nSegers never considered taking a coaching licence while he was still playing, meaning that he would have had to pay €10,000 for it instead of it being free for players. He worked for a newsagent, a post office and a pipe manufacturer.\nAfter a divorce cost him financially and lost him the custody of his daughters, Segers suffered from alcoholism. Having been warned by his doctor that he had two years to live, he quit the addiction.\nIn 2010, Segers opened a café with his new wife, having worked in his grandparents' café as a child. He said in 2017 that he felt tempted to sell the business due to its exposure to alcohol. In 2023, he told Het Nieuwsblad that he had Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and painful arthritis.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Hubei State Security Department (HSSD; Chinese: 湖北省国家安全厅) is the regional branch of the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) responsible for national security and secret policing in Hubei province of central China. Founded in 1993, it is headquartered in the provincial capital of Wuhan, with subordinate offices in cities and towns across the province.\nThe department is best known for operating the advanced persistent threat (APT) 31.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Hubei State Security Department was established on November 29, 1993, after the province was included among the localities approved by the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the State Council to receive a dedicated unit during the fourth and, to date, final round of major expansions of the MSS. Among the dignitaries in attendance for the department's inaugural meeting were Jia Chunwang, then–Minister of State Security; and Guan Guangfu, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee.\n\n\n== Advanced persistent threat ==\nThe Hubei State Security Department is widely understood to be the operator behind the advanced persistent threat designated APT 31 by Mandiant, also known as Judgment Panda by CrowdStrike, Zirconium or Violet Typhoon by Microsoft, RedBravo by Recorded Future, Bronze Vinewood by SecureWorks, TA412 by Proofpoint, or Red Keres by PricewaterhouseCoopers.\nThe APT is run directly by the Hubei SSD, likely without much input from MSS headquarters, with the group staffed by intelligence officers of the Hubei SSD as well as outside contractors employed through cutout organizations and front companies. APT31 is known to have successfully executed attacks against targets in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Norway, Finland, Mongolia, Russia, and throughout Eastern Europe.\nAccording to the United States, in 2010, the HSSD established Wuhan Xiaoruizhi Science and Technology Company, Limited (Chinese: 武汉晓睿智科技有限责任公司, aka Wuhan XRZ) as a front company to carry out cyber operations. This activity resulted in the surveillance of U.S. and foreign politicians, foreign policy experts, academics, journalists, and pro-democracy activists and their families, as well as persons and companies operating in areas of national importance. In 2018, employees of Wuhan XRZ conducted a cyber operation on a Texas-based energy company, gaining unauthorized access. \n\n\n=== Indictments and investigations ===\n\n\n==== United States ====\nIn March 2024, the United States and United Kingdom jointly indicted and sanctioned members of the Hubei SSD for a wide range of cyber operations against the two countries.\nThe U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) designated Zhao Guangzong and Ni Gaobin as Specially Designated Nationals. OFAC charged that as a contractor for Wuhan XRZ, Zhao was behind the 2020 APT 31 spear phishing operation against the United States Naval Academy and the United States Naval War College’s China Maritime Studies Institute. Additionally, Zhao is charged with conducted numerous spear phishing operations against Hong Kong legislators and democracy advocates. Ni Gaobin is charged with assisting Zhao in his most high profile malicious cyber activities while Zhao Guangzong was a contractor at Wuhan XRZ. \nThe US Department of Justice also unsealed indictments charging Zhao Guangzong, Ni Gaobin (倪高彬), Weng Ming (翁明), Cheng Feng (程锋), Peng Yaowen (彭耀文), Sun Xiaohui (孙小辉), and Xiong Wang (熊旺) for their involvement in malicious operations coordinated by Wuhan XRZ over a span of roughly 14 years. Ending in January 2024, these operations targeted U.S. critical infrastructure, as well as U.S. businesses and politicians, in support of China's foreign intelligence and economic espionage objectives. \n\n\n==== United Kingdom ====\nJoining US officials in revealing their public indictment, the UK Foreign Office accused the group of targeting British Parliament, hacking the GCHQ intelligence agency, and breaching systems of the UK's Electoral Commission. \n\n\n==== Finland ====\nOne day after the US and UK charges, the Finnish Security and Intelligence Service revealed APT31 as the actor responsible for a cyber breach of the country's parliament disclosed in March 2021. The country revealed that the National Bureau of Investigation is pursuing charges including aggravated espionage against members of the group.\n\n\n==== Russia ====\nIn August 2022, Moscow-based Positive Technologies attributed a cyberattack on Russian media and energy companies to APT31 based on a range of consistencies in attack methodology and software used in similar attacks.\nIn 2023, Moscow's Kaspersky assessed that APT-31 was capable of exfiltrating data from air-gapped systems.\n\n\n== List of directors ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Pertti Lauri Juhani Kaukonen (born June 5, 1942 Helsinki, Finland) is a Finnish Ambassador.\n\n\n== Family ==\nKaukonen's father is Secretariate Counsellor Lauri Kaukonen and mother is Philanthropist Elsa Kaukonen.\n\n\n== Education ==\nKaukonen graduated as Bachelor in Political Science in 1965 and Master in Political Science in 1966 from the University of Helsinki.\n\n\n== Career ==\nKaukonen joined the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland in 1965. His first positions were in Paris and Bucharest as an attache and a secretary. He was promoted to Embassy Secretary in 1970. \nIn 1972, Kaukonen was promoted to Divisional Secretary at the Ministry. In 1973 President of Finland Urho Kekkonen invited the first President of Senegal Léopold Sédar Senghor to Finland. President Senghor conferred the Officer of the National Order of the Lion award upon Kaukonen.\nIn 1973, Kaukonen was promoted to First Secretary at the Finnish Embassy in Copenhagen, Denmark. For his efforts towards strengthening the relationship between Finland and Denmark, Kaukonen received two awards - the Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog and the Knight 1st Class of the Order of the Dannebrog, from Queen Margrethe II of Denmark in 1973 and 1977, respectively.. \nIn 1976, Kaukonen was promoted to the position of Divisional Chief at the Ministry. That same year, President of Finland Urho Kekkonen awarded Kaukonen the Knight 1st Class of the Order of the Lion of Finland. He was later promoted to Counsellor in 1978.\n\n\n=== Head of Diplomatic Mission in South Africa ===\nIn 1980, Kaukonen started serving as the Chargé d'affaires in Pretoria, South Africa. Although Finland and South Africa had established diplomatic relations in 1949, Finland never supported South Africa's apartheid system. In 1984, Kaukonen was honored with the Commander of the Order of Good Hope award.\n\n\n=== Deputy Head of Mission in the United States of America ===\nIn 1984, Kaukonen was transferred to the Finnish Embassy in Washington, the United States of America, and into the role of Deputy Head of Mission. In practice, Kaukonen led the Finnish Embassy due to financial ambiguities with the Finnish Ambassador and the Ministry. Kaukonen served in the position until 1986. \nFrom 1986 to 1992, Kaukonen worked as a Counsellor at the Ministry in Finland.\n\n\n=== Ambassador in Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates ===\nIn 1992, Kaukonen was promoted to Counsellor for Foreign Affairs. That same year, President of Finland Mauno Koivisto appointed Kaukonen as the Ambassador of Finland to Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. As the head of state, the President of Finland made his first official visit to Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates in 1996. A Nobel Peace Prize laureate Martti Ahtisaari was the President of Finland between 1994 and 2000. Kaukonen held this position until 1998.\nIn 2004, a parliamentary delegation from Kuwait visited Helsinki in Finland. At a dinner banquet hosted by the Secretary General of the Finnish Parliament, Seppo Tiitinen, Ambassador Kaukonen gave a speech in which he described Kuwaiti diwaniyas as the best form of democracy.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nIn 1998, Kaukonen was awarded the Military Merit Medal by the Finnish Defence Forces.

However, the teams split amidst alleged contract breaches on the part of Isotta Fraschini, who later partnered with Duqueine Team.\n\n\n== Racing record ==\n\n\n=== FIA World Endurance Championship ===\n\n\n=== 24 Hours of Le Mans results ===\n\n\n=== European Le Mans Series ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

A critic from Times Now gave the film the same rating and wrote that \"Boomer Uncle has very little to offer in terms of entertainment and comes across as an insipid, poor comedy film\". A critic from Dinakaran wrote that \"In a story that moves as a comedy gala, all the characters keep talking is boring. Subhash Dandapani's cinematography is colorful. The background score by Shanthan and Dharmaprakash carries the film. Yogi Babu's die-hard fans may laugh\". On the contrary, a critic from Thina Bhoomi wrote that \"Without looking at any logic, this comedy gala performed with an army of comedy stars will definitely make the fans laugh till their stomachs hurt\" and concluded that \"Boomer Uncle is a Hollywood comedy riot\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBoomer Uncle at IMDb",

The author of the lyrics was Lina Wertmüller, and the music was written by Bruno Canfora, who was also the artistic director of the program at that time..\nDespite the fact that the song was aired back in June, it was released as a single only in December, so it reached only number 17 on the chart. In 2021, the song received a gold certificate from Federazione Industria Musicale Italiana for digital sales since 2009.\nThe B-side was the song \"Tu non credi più\" (words by Alberto Testa and Mogol, music by Tony Renis, arranged by Augusto Martelli), which in 1967 was performed by Mina in the program Sabato sera and later included in the album Sabato sera – Studio Uno '67.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n7\" single\nA. \"Mi sei scoppiato dentro il cuore\" – 3:05\nB. \"Tu non credi più\" (Alberto Testa, Mogol, Tony Renis) – 3:07\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications and sales ==\n\n\n== Usage in media ==\nThe song was used in a commercial for Pasta Barilla (directed by Piero Gherardi), which aired in early 1967.\n\n\n== Cover versions ==\nIn 2011, singer Annalisa performed the song live on the show Amici and included this version in her debut album Nali.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Mi sei scoppiato dentro il cuore\" at Discogs\nMi sei scoppiato dentro al cuore (1967) regia e costumi Piero Gherardi on YouTube",

        "content": "Palace of Varieties was a British radio programme produced by the BBC and broadcast regularly on the Light Programme between 1937 and 1958.\n\nThe programme was devised by Bryan Michie and produced throughout its run by Ernest Longstaffe.  The shows highlighted music hall performers, in the style of theatrical shows earlier in the century.The programme consisted of five or six artistes, each singing a song with full verse and chorus. Then, at the end of the programme, they came back and sang the chorus of another popular song with which audiences could join in. There was usually a well-known \"top of the bill\" in every show, but Longstaffe preferred most of the programme to feature artistes who were normally featured lower on a variety bill and, in some cases, entertainers who had never broadcast before. Longstaffe found that these people often gave a more faithful reproduction of songs in the manner of the original music hall performers and were better suited to creating the atmosphere of an old-time theatre.\nArtists who performed included Nellie Wallace, Randolph Sutton, G. H. Elliott and Hetty King, although most of those appearing were less prominent entertainers.   The compere was always referred to as as \"Mr Will Tipple\" or \"Will Philpot\".  Initially, the shows were introduced by actor Bill Stephens; later chairmen included Nosmo King (Vernon Watson), Rob Currie, George Street, and Tod Slaughter.   Longstaffe insisted that all the performers wore stage costume when broadcasting, and claimed that King George VI had told him that the programme was his personal favourite. \nAn LP, Palace of Varieties, with introductions by Longstaffe, was produced in the 1960s and reissued on CD in 2012.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "John Campbell Orr was an association football player and administrator, who was the most important figure of the promotion of the game in Birmingham in the 1870s.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nCampbell Orr was born in Gorbals, Glasgow, the son of John Cunningham Orr (a bookseller and printer) and Wilhelmina, née Campbell.  He was brought up in Cupar in Fifeshire and educated at Smeaton's School in St Andrews, recording 100% in the mathematics examinations in 1868.  He matriculated at St Andrews University,  which was a stronghold of rugby football, that year, and he represented the university at rugby; his final rugby match recorded, against Edinburgh Academical in February 1870, featured six future rugby internationals.\nHe did not graduate, in part due to the collapse of his father's business, and instead worked for a year as a clerk to a writer to the signet.\n\n\n== Football ==\n\n\n=== Foundation of Calthorpe F.C. ===\nIn 1873, he moved to Birmingham with a business partner, John Carson, who had been a member of the Queen's Park association football club.  Campbell Orr and Carson formed a footballing club for the young clerks in the area, and, after some discussion, Carson's view that the new club - originally called the Birmingham Clerks Association - should adopt the association code was accepted.\nThe new club, soon re-named Calthorpe F.C. after the location of its matches (Calthorpe Park), had to hold between club members given the lack of opposition.  On 12 November 1873, the Birmingham Post published a letter from \"a clerk\" - almost certainly Campbell Orr, in his capacity as secretary to the Calthorpe club - stating:\n\n\n=== Administration ===\nThe evangelism worked as from at least 1874 Calthorpe was playing matches against other sides in the town, and, in 1875, after the formation of a dozen clubs in the town, he and Charles Crump of Stafford Road of Wolverhampton pushed to form the Birmingham Football Association.   The Birmingham FA duly set up the Birmingham Senior Cup, which was first played for in 1876–77. \nCampbell Orr was the first secretary of the Birmingham FA, a position he held for 2 years, before becoming treasurer; he took the secretaryship once more in 1886, after the previous secretary Joe Cofield died, and held the post until his death, as well as posts on the Football Association committee. Throughout his tenure the chair was held by Crump.  The two normally worked in parallel, but one difference between them was in the legalization of professionalism in 1885; Crump was strongly against it, but, despite the Calthorpe stance, Orr was in favour.\nThe Campbell Orr Shield, played off between members of the Birmingham County Inter-League and Association, and Birmingham & District Works Association, was one of his last innovations in football; he introduced the trophy in October 1921, a month before his death.\n\n\n=== As a player ===\nThe Calthorpe club, with strong links with Queen's Park, remained a staunch amateur side, unlike Aston Villa which adopted a hidden professionalism before the 1870s were out.  Campbell Orr played for Calthorpe in the first Senior Cup, the club beating Royal in the first round but losing to Wednesbury Town in the second; the club captain was Carson.  He did not however play in the club's first FA Cup tie in 1879–80, when Calthorpe was the first side from Birmingham to take part in the competition; he was one of the players who was attending \"a great Conservative gathering at Birmingham\" instead.  Orr would never play in the Cup - his final recorded match had been against Rushall Rovers a couple of weeks before.\nHis highest profile matches for Calthorpe were in annual friendlies against Queen's Park, although the disparity in status of the teams meant that the Queen's Park XI was a reserve side.  Campbell Orr scored the opening goal in the first match in Birmingham, in February 1877 at the Calthorpe ground, but the visitors won 4–3.  \nAs one of the pioneers of association football in Birmingham, he played in the Birmingham FA's first inter-association match, against the Sheffield Football Association at Bramall Lane in January 1876, but the experience of the Sheffield side was far too much for the Birmingham side, the final score being 6–0.\nHe was considered a good-quality forward, his rugby skills helping in a more physical era when charging between opponents was a more valuable attribute.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nCampbell Orr's football responsibilities ran alongside his professional life as a director of the firm of J. C. and W. Lord, general merchants based in the Horse Fair in Birmingham. \nHe married Ellen Marsh in Harborne on Christmas Day 1880.  He died on 16 November 1921, as a result of complications from influenza.  He left five sons and two daughters; his wife had pre-deceased him in April 1920. \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ghatixalus magnus, the large-sized Ghat tree frog, is a species of frog in the subfamily Rhacophorinae.  It is endemic to India, in the southern Western Ghat mountains, between the Palakkad Gap and Shencottah Gap.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nG. magnus may be the largest known rhacophorid frog in India.\nScientists described two male frogs, one 71.54 mm long in snout-vent length and the other 81.90 mm long. The skin of the dorsum is rusty yellow in color with small brighter yellow spots. The sides of the body are dark brown with white lines and purple-blue spots where the back legs meet the body. The tympanum is yellow. There is a bright yellow stripe down each side of the snout.  The iris is purple-gray in color with black venation. There are dark brown crossbars on the legs. The feet are turquoise blue with blue-brown webbed skin and yellow disks on the toes.\nExcept for its size, G. magnus resembles G. variabilis and G. asterops relatively closely. The larvae, however, differ significantly. G. variabilis and G. asterops tadpoles swim in rocky streams and have large oral suckers to allow them to adhere to surfaces despite strong water flow. G. magnus tadpoles, however, swim in stream pools during the summer, when the current is slower.  Although the tadpoles do have a \"large oral appendage\" on their mouths, scientists do not believe they use it to anchor themselves. G. magnus tadpoles also havethe greatest number of rows of teeth of any frog tadpole in Rhacophoridae: from 7/6 to 10/10. The rhacophorid average is 5/3.\nThe tadpoles undergo metamorphosis in May.\n\n\n== Habitat ==\nPeople have observed this frog in rainforests on mid-elevation mountains and nearby coffee farms.  This frog can live near cascades, where it perches on boulders and large rocks.  People have observed this frog between 1350 and 1800 meters above sea level.\nThe frog's range includes protected parks: Anamalai Tiger Reserve, Periyar Tiger Reserve, Eravikulam National Park, Indira Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary, Devermala in Achankovil Reserve Forests, and Meghamalai Wildlife Sanctuary. Scientists think that about half of all the living G. magnus frogs live in these places.\n\n\n== Threats ==\nScientists classify this frog as vulnerable to extinction because of habitat loss associated with deforestation for road-building and agriculture, especially cash crops, but also illegal farming and tree harvesting and small-scale traditional farming.  The frog can live on some types of farms, such as coffee plantations, but cannot tolerate the full opening up of its habitat or removal of leaf litter associated with ginger farming or traditional farming. These involve the removal of the understory and leaf litter that the frog needs to lay its eggs.\nScientists also cite climate change as a threat to this frog because its mountain habitat would make migration very difficult.\nScientists have observed the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis on some of these frogs, but they have not observed morbidity or mortality associated with the fungal disease chytridiomycosis.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThis frog's Latin name means \"great,\" referring to its large size relative to its congeners.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Bicycle Day is a global holiday on April 19th celebrating the psychedelic revolution and commemorating the first psychedelic trip on LSD by  Dr. Albert Hofmann in 1943, in tandem with his famous bicycle ride home from Sandoz Labs. It is commonly celebrated by ingesting psychedelics and riding a bike, sometimes in a parade, and often with  psychedelic-themed festivities. The holiday was first named and declared in 1985 by Thomas Roberts, a psychology professor at Northern Illinois University, but has likely been celebrated by psychedelic enthusiasts since the begining of the psychedelic era, and celebrated in popular culture since at least 2004.\n\n\n== History ==\nOn April 19, 1943, Albert Hofmann ingested 0.25 milligrams (250 micrograms) of LSD. Between one and two hours later, Hofmann experienced slow and gradual changes in his perception. He asked his laboratory assistant to escort him home. As was customary in Basel, they made the journey by bicycle. On the way, Hofmann's condition rapidly deteriorated as he struggled with feelings of anxiety, alternating in his beliefs that the next-door neighbor was a malevolent witch, that he was going insane, and that the LSD had poisoned him. When the house doctor arrived, however, he could detect no physical abnormalities, save for a pair of widely dilated pupils. Hofmann was reassured, and soon his terror began to give way to a sense of good fortune and enjoyment, as he later wrote:\n\n... Little by little I could begin to enjoy the unprecedented colors and plays of shapes that persisted behind my closed eyes. Kaleidoscopic, fantastic images surged in on me, alternating, variegated, opening and then closing themselves in circles and spirals, exploding in colored fountains, rearranging and hybridizing themselves in constant flux ...\nThe events of this first LSD trip, now known as \"Bicycle Day\", after the bicycle ride home, proved to Hofmann that he had indeed made a significant discovery: a psychoactive substance with extraordinary potency, capable of causing significant shifts of consciousness in incredibly low doses. (The term trip was first coined by US Army scientists during the 1950s when they were experimenting with LSD.) Hofmann foresaw the drug as a powerful psychiatric tool; because of its intense and introspective nature, he could not imagine anyone using it recreationally. Bicycle Day is increasingly observed in psychedelic communities as a day to celebrate the discovery of LSD.\nThe celebration of Bicycle Day originated in DeKalb, Illinois, in 1985, when Thomas B. Roberts, then a professor at Northern Illinois University, invented the name \"Bicycle Day\" when he founded the first celebration at his home. Several years later, he sent an announcement made by one of his students to friends and Internet lists, thus propagating the idea and the celebration. His original intent was to commemorate Hofmann's original, accidental exposure on April 16, but that date fell midweek and was not a good time for the party, so he chose the 19th to honor Hofmann's first intentional exposure.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Al-Nahdayn Mountain is one of the mountains that overlooks the Yemeni capital Sanaa from the south and directly overlooks the Presidential House from the south as well. The mountain consists of two separate hills and is considered a medium-height mountain, as it rises about 300 meters above the surrounding area.\n\n\n== Strategic importance ==\nThe mountain and the Presidential House have been a frequent target of the Arab coalition forces throughout the years of the war that has been ongoing since 2015, after the Houthis took control of the capital Sanaa in September 2014, and it was bombed multiple times. The mountain was one of the strategic locations overlooking Sanaa during the seventy-day siege in 1967, the competition to occupy and control it was fierce between the royal forces on one hand and the republican forces defending Sanaa on the other, this is due to its closeness to the capital Sanaa and the ability of the artillery stationed there to easily select and hit its targets inside the capital. Today, the mountain is in the center of the capital and within the Al-Sabeen district, surrounded by houses and population clusters from all sides due to the great urban expansion that the capital witnessed after the September 26 Revolution in 1962. The royal forces took control of the mountain more than once at the beginning of the Battle of Al-Sabeen and launched strikes toward multiple targets inside the capital, however, Republican forces drove the royal forces from the mountain more than once, and a group of Central Security Forces was stationed on the mountain led by Major Abdulkarim Hamid, and Captain Abdulmalik al-Sayani, commander of the Al-Nahdayn site. They were able to hold it throughout the siege and repel the royal forces attacks coming from the south and southwest of the capital, thus protecting the capital from penetration from the southern side until the siege ended with the defeat of the royal forces and they were pushed away from the periphery of Sanaa and other areas and the victory of the republican side in February 1968. The seven-year civil war in northern Yemen came to a halt after the revolution and the declaration of the republic.  \nAt the beginning of his reign, former president Ali Abdullah Saleh built the presidential palace, called the Presidency House, directly below the mountain, to protect the palace and the surrounding area, also a Republican Guard camp and weapons depots were stationed on the mountain. Inside the Presidency House is the Presidency House Mosque, which is also called the Al-Nahdayn Mosque after the mountain. That mosque was bombed in June 2011 during the protests against Ali Abdullah Saleh, known as the Youth Revolution, within what I call the  Arab Spring Revolutions. Also, there was an attempt to assassinate the president while he was attending Friday prayers at the mosque and it was known as \"Al-Nahdayn Incident\". The president and a large group of high-ranking officials were injured in the incident, while several attendees at the mosque were killed.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Montana Wesleyan University (1889-1923) was an American university in Helena, Montana, established by the Methodist Episcopal Church (MEC). The school was organized in August, 1888, at an annual conference held at Missoula, Montana, and Rev. R. E. Smith was appointed its first president and agent. Fred Gamer furnished the stone for the foundation and plowed the first furrow in 1889. John Paulson was the architect, and D. P. Wortman contractor. The school was opened the fall of 1890. A name change occurred in 1898 to Montana Wesleyan College. A 1923 merger of Montana Wesleyan and College of Montana formed Intermountain Union College (now Rocky Mountain College).\n\n\n== Early history ==\nThe MEC was one of the first religious institutions to become permanently part of the mining population of early Montana Territory. Churches in nearly all the larger cities had already celebrated their semi-centennials. Hand in hand with religious worship, Montana Methodists gave an unusual share of their attention and means to the cause of education. In the minutes of the first Montana MEC Conference, August 2, 1877, there was voiced a demand for the establishment of a school of higher grade \"to meet the wants of the people who are unable to bear the expense of sending their children to eastern schools.\" Five years later, in 1882, a committee was appointed to consider the manner of starting an educational institution. In 1888, a field agent was appointed and in 1889, the Conference determined to locate a school at Helena. The first president of the board of trustees was Col. Wilbur F. Sanders, and the first treasurer was Fred Gamer.\n\n\n== Prickly Pear campus ==\n\nMontana Wesleyan University opened its doors to students in 1890 after the completion of a building in the valley about 6 miles (9.7 km) north of Helena. After street car service was discontinued to the Prickly Pear Valley, the location was isolated, but the school did not close its doors. The panic of 1893 and the slow development of the state in the matter of population were the principal reasons why the institution did not sooner realize the hopes of its projectors.\n\n\n== Klein campus ==\n\nIn 1900, the school was moved to temporary quarters in the center of Helena, and against many adverse circumstances, it continued its work until January 1914, when it was moved to its present location at Klein Campus. Through the generosity of Mr. Henry Klein a donation of over US$16,000 came to the school. It was from this fund that the trustees were able to secure a tract of ground 22 acres (8.9 ha) in extent 21⁄2 blocks from the capitol grounds, calling it the Klein Campus out of respect to the name of the generous donor. In the meantime, the original building in the valley, costing about US$7,000, was leased to the Deaconess Association, and served as the home of the Montana Deaconess School.\nIn 1908, the assets of the institution were as follows:\n\nTwo buildings in the city of Helena: Mills Hall, 645 to 649 North Ewing street, which served as a dormitory and office building, and College Hall, corner of Warren street and Helena avenue.\nSix blocks and two fractional blocks in the city located between Lenox and the depot within two squares of the campus of the capitol building, designed for a new campus site.\nA ranch consisting of 155 acres (63 ha) in Fergus County, Montana, known as the Sweetland ranch.\nThree lots in Whitehall, Montana, donated by Worthy Noble through Rev. George D. King.\nSome 150 acres (61 ha) of land in Prickly Pear valley almost 4 miles (6.4 km) north of Helena, with a large unused building on it. An additional 50 acres (20 ha) located near the Fred Gamer ranch.\nFor the 1909 year, the course of study was revised and modernized to conform to the requirements of the State University, the county high schools of Montana, and the preparatory schools connected with the leading eastern colleges. Steps were taken to place all courses on a four-year basis. The work in these departments was being carried on by the faculty and teaching force, numbering eleven in all.\n\n\n== College campus ==\n\nDuring the period of 1916-1921, in spite of rising costs and other difficulties that confronted trustees of educational institutions all over the country, Montana Wesleyan reached a degree of building and other equipment that enabled it to fulfill the purposes and ideals of the founders thirty years prior. The campus now contained two excellent examples of school architecture, the main administration building being known as Helena Hall, and in 1920, a new dormitory for women, Mills Hall, was completed and occupied. Other buildings convenient to the campus were utilized for dormitory and other purposes, and the students also had access to the many advantages of the capital city, including the State Historical Library, the State Laboratories, the City Library, YMCA, and all the varied social, religious and civic advantages of Helena.\n\nMontana Wesleyan had a complete faculty organization of specialists in their lines of work, and the educational facilities embraced not only the general academic and college course, but special scientific departments, domestic science department, music and commercial department.\n\nThe college was founded by and was the property of the Methodist Episcopal Church, from which it also derived its support. Yet it was denominational only to the extent that its discipline was in harmony with the views of the church which founded and supported it. The school was based on broad Christian principles such as were commonly held by Protestant churches. It had a positive Christian spirit and atmosphere, neither dogmatic nor sectarian.\n\n\n== Presidents ==\nRev. R. E. Smith, president and agent one year\nRev. F. P. Tower, D. D., president five years\nProf. J. C. Templeton and Mary S. Cummins were in charge four years\nRev. Thomas Van Scoy, D. D., president for two years and died in February of his third year\nRev. George D. King, A. M., president from February to June\nDr. J. W. Morris, president one year\nC. W. Tenney, principal and president five years\nRobert P. Smith, chancellor; president one year\nC. W. Tenney, president\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nLaura E. Howey, teacher, Montana Wesleyan University\nWilbur F. Sanders, first president of the board of trustees, Montana Wesleyan University\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMontana Wesleyan at Internet Archive\nThe Prickly Pear yearbook: (1915), (1916), (1917), (1918), (1919), (1922), (1923)",

        "content": "Strale (\"Javelin\") was an Italian Lampo-class destroyer. Commissioned into service in the Italian Regia Marina (Royal Navy) in 1901, she served in the Italo-Turkish War and World War I. She was stricken in 1924.\n\n\n== Construction and commissioning ==\nStrale was laid down at the Schichau-Werke in Elbing in the German Empire on 7 November 1899. She was launched on 19 May 1900 and completed on 6 July 1901. She was commissioned in July 1901.\nStrale and her five sister ships formed the first class of destroyers built for the Regia Marina, their only predecessor, Fulmine, having been a one-off. Designed by the German Schichau-Werke shipyard, they were seaworthy, robust, fast, and reliable, although they were afflicted by serious problems with seakeeping. \n\n\n== Service history ==\n\n\n=== Italo-Turkish War ===\nStrale participated in the Italo-Turkish War, which began on 29 September 1911 with the Kingdom of Italy′s declaration of war on the Ottoman Empire. However, she did not take part in any significant actions during the war, which ended on 18 October 1912 in an Italian victory.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\n\nWorld War I broke out in 1914, and the Kingdom of Italy entered the war on the side of the Allies with its declaration of war on Austria-Hungary on 23 May 1915. At the time, Strale, under the command of Capitano di corvetta (Corvette Captain) Marsilia, and the destroyers Dardo, Euro, Lampo, and Ostro made up the 4th Destroyer Squadron, under the command of Capitano di fregata (Frigate Captain) F. Gambardella. Strale and her sister ship Euro were based at Tobruk in Italian Cyrenaica. By 1915, the Lampo-class destroyers were of antiquated design and had only limited military usefulness, but during World War I, they were modified, having equipment installed to carry and lay 12 mines, drop depth charges, and tow explosive paravanes, and Strale had her bridge raised. The Lampo-class ships spent the war on escort duty.\nOn 11 July 1915 Strale, the protected cruisers Marsala and Quarto, the auxiliary cruiser Città di Palermo, the destroyers Animoso, Ardente, Ardito, and Audace, and the torpedo boats Airone, Arpia, Astore, Calliope, Cassiopea, and Clio took part in the occupation of the Palagruža (known to the Italians as the Pelagosa) archipelago in the Adriatic Sea. After Strale and the torpedo boats swept the waters of the Zadlo anchorage for mines, Città di Palermo landed Italian troops on the islands. The operation went smoothly: Two Austro-Hungarian signalmen, who first hid from and then surrendered to the Italians, made up the archipelago's entire garrison.\nAt 04:00 on 17 July 1915 Strale, Ardito,  Airone, Arpia, Astore, Calliope, Clio, the armored cruisers Giuseppe Garibaldi and Vettor Pisani, and the torpedo boats Alcione, Centauro, and Cigno took part in a bombardment of the Ragusa–Cattaro railway. The Italian force broke off the bombardment when Vettor Pisani sighted an Austro-Hungarian submarine at 04:25. The Italians had begun their return voyage to Brindisi when the Austro-Hungarian submarine U-4 attacked the formation at 04:40 and torpedoed Giuseppe Garibaldi, which sank within minutes.\nStrale continued her World War I service without taking part in any other significant actions. By late October 1918, Austria-Hungary had effectively disintegrated, and the Armistice of Villa Giusti, signed on 3 November 1918, went into effect on 4 November 1918 and brought hostilities between Austria-Hungary and the Allies to an end. World War I ended a week later with an armistice between the Allies and the German Empire on 11 November 1918.\n\n\n=== Post-World War I ===\nStrale was stricken from the naval register on 13 January 1924. She subsequently was scrapped.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nFavre, Franco. La Marina nella Grande Guerra.

The first brick buildings were constructed in the 1870s and 1880s to house offices and stores.  Other commercial buildings continued to be built through the 1920s, most in simple style but some with Victorian details.  The current passenger depot was built in 1910 in Spanish Revival style.\nThe district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.\n\n\n== References ==",

Ziller was influenced by the educational ideas of Johann Friedrich Herbart and played a significant role in the development and dissemination of Herbartian pedagogy.\nZiller emphasized the importance of moral and intellectual education, arguing that education should focus on the development of both character and intellect. He advocated for a systematic and organized approach to teaching, based on clear educational objectives and the careful selection and presentation of material. Ziller also emphasized the importance of individualized instruction, tailoring teaching methods to the needs and abilities of each student.\nIn addition to his work in education, Ziller made significant contributions to the field of psychology, particularly in the areas of educational psychology and child development. He conducted research on topics such as attention, memory, and learning, and his work helped to shape the emerging field of educational psychology in the late 19th century.\nOverall, Tuiskon Ziller is remembered as an influential figure in the history of education, pedagogy and psychology, whose ideas continue to have an impact on educational theory and practice today.\nTuiskon Ziller died on April 20, 1882, in Leipzig at the age of 64.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nEinleitung in die allgemeine Pädagogik (Leipzig 1856)\nDie Regierung der Kinder (Leipzig 1857)\nGrundlegung zur Lehre vom ergehenden Unterricht (Leipzig 1865, 1884)\nHerbartische Reliquien (Leipzig 1871)\nVorlesungen über Allgemeine Pädagogik (Leipzig 1876, 1884)\nAllgemeine philosophische Ethik (Leipzig 1880)\nAllgemeine Pädagogik, 1892\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sportclub Wacker was an Austrian football club based in the Obermeidling district of Vienna. It was established between 1906 and 1908 at the initiative of schoolboy Max Freund and continued to operate until the 1971 merger with Jedlesee Sports club SK Admira Vienna, which resulted in the formation of FC Admira/Wacker. This new entity succeeded both clubs as their legal successor. The club colors of Wacker Vienna were black and white, and the team played its home matches in the 20,000-capacity stadium on Rosasgasse (Wackerplatz) near Schönbrunn Palace.\nIn 53 years competing in the first division, the Meidling Buam achieved 478 victories. The club reached its historical pinnacle in 1947 when it became champions and won the cup final against Austria Wien by a score of 4–3. The club's most notable success at an international tournament occurred in 1951 when it advanced to the Mitropacup final. Nevertheless, Wacker achieved notoriety as the \"eternal runners-up\" in the league. If one considers the abbreviated championship in 1945, Wacker finished the season in second place eight times, but only once in first place.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1906-1912: The first years of the Meidling Buam ===\n\nSC Wacker Vienna was established by Max Freund, a soccer enthusiast from Meidling. Freund was a member of the Vienna AC youth soccer team and found the lengthy and costly journeys from Meidling to the Prater for training to be a significant inconvenience. He collaborated with his friend Oskar Wittek to recruit numerous pupils, with whom they met regularly to play soccer next to the Meidling slaughterhouse. In 1906, Max Freund finally proposed the establishment of his soccer club, which he named \"Wacker.\" However, this ambitious endeavor ultimately failed due to the lack of an appropriate legal age among the prospective members, who were unable to register the club with the authorities. The issue was temporarily set aside, and the young footballers initially focused on establishing their clubhouse and procuring their club uniforms. A suitable location was swiftly identified in the laundry room at Aichholzgasse 33, where the Wacker players could now store all their belongings, including goalposts. Additionally, the pupils persuaded a mother to have black and white shirts made for the entire team. The club colors were selected because the majority of the young athletes had previously worn black cloth trousers and a white rowing shirt when playing soccer.\nIn 1907, the individual deemed suitable to assume the role of club chairman was identified in the form of Mr. Rudolf Krones, thus paving the way for the formal establishment of Wacker Wien. The innkeeper Nitsch provided the club with a sports ground in the form of a sand pit, which was initially leveled by the club members and prepared for the inaugural match in 1909 against ASV Hertha Wien. The inaugural match on the club's pitch resulted in a 3:1 defeat against the visitors from Favoriten. In the same year, the Wacker players achieved admission to their newly founded club to the Austrian Football Association. Starting in the third and therefore lowest class, Wacker was able to play its way unbeaten into the second-class \"2nd Class A,\" where it competed against clubs that are largely unknown today. In this period, the Meidlingers were pitted against formidable opponents, including Blue Star, Red Star, Wiener Bewegungsspieler, Donaustadt, Nußdorfer AC, Ober St. Veit, and Hernalser Sportfreunde. Despite facing considerable challenges, the Black & Whites demonstrated resilience and competitiveness in their inaugural season, ultimately claiming the championship title in their second year in the second division in 1911/12. In Franz Twaroch, the Meidlingers also had their first \"star\" and crowd favorite in the team, who even made an appearance for the Austrian national team, which had been in existence since 1902. This was the first player from a second division club ever to do so.\n\n\n=== 1912-1934: Up and down in the championship ===\nTo be promoted to the first division, the Black & Whites were required to play a relegation match against the penultimate team in the first division, SpC Rudolfshügel. The Wacker players entered the match with a great deal of respect for the Rudolfshüglers, but ultimately lost by a score of 0:6. However, just one season later, Wacker was once again at the top of the second division table and was subsequently challenged by Hertha Vienna in the relegation match. The results against the favorites were 0:2 and 2:2, which resulted in Wacker once again missing out on promotion to the first division. With an impressive goal difference of 102:15, Meidling 1914 secured the second division championship for a third consecutive year. That year, the relegation matches were also abolished at Vienna's request. This was surprising, as the Döblingen side had unexpectedly been relegated themselves at the end of the season. Wacker was finally in the first division. However, the First World War soon overshadowed the joy of promotion to the highest level. Almost the entire Wacker team was called up as soldiers, and around half of them did not return. The club did not play a major role in the war championships. In its first season as a first division club, Wacker was only able to win a single game, but relegation was suspended during the war. Despite finishing at the bottom of the table in the inaugural post-war season in 1919, the club was able to avoid relegation by being promoted to a higher division. The club's rapidly growing popularity in Meidling soon made the construction of a new, larger stadium necessary. On October 8, 1921, the stadium on Rosagasse, which could hold 20,000 spectators, was finally opened with a championship match.\nThe Wacker fans were able to celebrate their first major success shortly thereafter. With a remarkable 4:2 victory over Rapid Vienna, the Meidlingers advanced to the 1923 Cup final, where they suffered a 3:1 defeat at the hands of Wiener Sport-Club in front of 20,000 spectators at the Hohe Warte. Feigl played in goal for Wacker, Kolndorfer, and Huber as backs, Klicka, Resch, and Pellet in the half-back line, and Liebhardt, goalscorer Kowanda, Wana, Röscher and Stach as forwards. Throughout the championship, the Wacker players achieved consistent mid-table finishes, yet were unable to challenge for the title. The most notable achievements of the season were the individual matches in which the team was able to compete with the top clubs. In 1924, professional football was introduced in Austria, marking the inception of the championship as a professional league. Despite achieving a seventh-place finish in the inaugural professional year, the team subsequently secured ninth and eighth-place finishes in the lower half of the table. The appointment of renowned coaches such as Rigo Kuthan and Jenő Konrád did not yield immediate results. In 1928, however, the club commenced its inaugural season with a noteworthy 4:1 victory over the then-current record champions, Rapid. This result ultimately positioned the club in 4th place in the table, a provisional club record. The away win on June 11, 1929, against the then top European club Slavia Prague 3-0 under coach Ferdinand Feigl, who had been in goal at the 1923 Cup final, is also recorded as particularly valuable in the Wacker chronicle. After this brief high, the team soon returned to mid-table. The majority of the players on the Wacker team at the time were from Meidling, and the majority of them remained loyal to the club for the remainder of their careers. The club was fortunate to have exceptional players such as Karl Zischek, who enabled them to remain consistently at the top of the Austrian league despite their great successes in the national team. In 1934, Wunderteam right winger Zischek and Johann Walzhofer participated in the World Cup in Italy. Despite Austria's advancement to the semi-finals, the team ultimately placed ninth in the tournament and did not compete in the international Mitropacup.\n\n\n=== 1934-1947: Rise, Second World War and winning the double ===\nThe ascent to become a top national club commenced in the late 1930s. In their twentieth year as a first division club, the Meidlingers achieved a fourth-place finish in the championship, equaling their best result of 1928. This was followed by even more impressive performances in the subsequent years. The club confirmed its upward trajectory with two additional fourth-place finishes in 1937 and 1938. Following the annexation of Austria by the German Reich on March 12, 1938, the professional national league, which was deemed \"unworthy of a German man,\" was replaced by the amateur championship in the Gauliga XVII. In the face of these adverse circumstances, the club was able to maintain its position for the time being. In the 1938/39 season, Wacker was able to challenge the then series champions Admira Vienna for the first time under coach Otto Haftl. The club temporarily climbed to the top of the table and faced Admira in a direct duel at the Praterstadion on March 19 in the deciding match for the title. Although the Meidlingers suffered a 2:4 defeat in front of 38,000 spectators, they were runners-up for the first time in the club's history. The Black & Whites also finished runners-up in the following years, 1940 and 1941, but were beaten by Rapid on both occasions. However, they were able to build up a comfortable lead thanks to Franz Binder. The club was unfortunate in the 1939 DFB Cup. Wacker advanced to the semifinals of the German Cup, where they faced SV Waldhof Mannheim. The first match in Mannheim ended in a 1–1 draw after extra time. The second match in Vienna ended in a 2–2 draw after extra time, and the third match on a neutral pitch in Munich ended in a 0–0 draw after extra time. A draw was agreed upon, which favored Mannheim. Wacker was eliminated from the competition with a perfect record. The club suffered increasingly from the consequences of the Second World War. A significant number of players were lost to the war, including national goalkeeper Alexander Martinek and Wacker international Josef Pekarek, who lost a leg. The stadium was badly damaged by bombs. In 1944, the club was confronted with the relegation battle, but narrowly won the relegation match against SG Reichsbahn 2:1. The club had to cancel all matches in the 1945 spring championship.\nIn the week preceding Germany's capitulation, a soccer match was held at Wacker-Platz on May 1, 1945. This match was part of a May Day celebration for the Soviet occupying forces, during which the Meidlingers played against a team from the Vienna Czechs (8:0). The Black & Whites were bolstered by the addition of Marischka and Hahnemann from Admira, and they finished third in the inaugural Austrian post-war championship in 1945/46. The two Admira veterans' arrival had a profound impact on the club's history, but it was the result of a peculiar turn of events at the time. The pitch of Admira was situated on the Russian side of a divided Vienna, while that of Wacker was in British territory, where Marischka and Hahnemann also resided. In order to be able to continue training regularly, the two joined Wacker. In 1947, the history of the Meidling district club finally reached its climax. In the championship, the then three-time runners-up were typically in first place. This time, they successfully mastered the deciding match against Wiener Sport-Club on June 8, 1947, with a 4:0 victory. Double goal scorer Turl Wagner was instrumental in this outcome. Wacker were champions, and just three weeks later on June 29, the Meidlingers faced Vienna Austria in the cup final. This deciding match was far more dramatic. Wacker's top scorer in 1942, Ernst Reitermaier, provided the Meidlingers with an early lead, but Pepi Stroh equalized for the Violets shortly thereafter. After Hahnemann gave Meidling the advantage once more, the lead changed hands to Austria just minutes later thanks to a brace from Dolfi Huber. Finally, a further two goals each from Reitermeier and Hahnemann in the final minutes of the match made the final score 4:3 in favor of Wacker in front of 35,000 spectators at the Praterstadion. The trophy was then presented to the winning team by Federal Chancellor Leopold Figl. In addition to the two players who scored two goals each, Pelikan and Wacker fielded a defensive line comprising Virius and Marischka, a midfield trio of Macho, Hanappi, and Brinek, and a forward line of Gerhard Hanappi, Licker, Kalcik, and Strobl. The latter trio was particularly lauded in the press, with Hanappi, in particular, being hailed as a promising talent.\n\n\n=== 1948-1956: Championship and Centropacup runner-up title ===\nAfter winning the double, Meidling were unable to defend or regain the title under new coach Edi Frühwirth, who brought the World Cup system to Meidling. The championship once again turned into a duel with Rapid. Wacker's 1-0 win over Sportclub in the final match of the season meant that Rapid had to win at least one point in their final match against Austria the following day. The 45,000 spectators at the Prater Stadium on June 6, 1948, included the entire Wacker team as well as many black and white fans. Austria quickly took the lead and after 60 minutes the score was 2-0 in favor of the Violets. But a goal by Knor put Rapid back in front 2-1, and just before the end of the game, the referee awarded a penalty to Rapid, Robert Körner stepped up and scored, making Rapid champions and Wacker runners-up. In addition to these direct and indirect duels, the transfer of Wacker legend Gerhard Hanappi to Rapid in 1950 added fuel to the fire, and many Wacker fans swore eternal enmity. After a fourth place and a third place, Wacker took the championship again in 1951. With Ernst Bokon, Richard Brousek, Walter Haummer and Turl Wagner, the club had one of the strongest attacks of the season, scoring exactly 100 goals in just 24 games for the Meidlingers. But once again, there was no way past Rapid, who scored 133 times. As runners-up, however, the club qualified for the Centro Cup, an attempt to revive the famous Mitropokal of the interwar years. Wacker made it to the final, where they again faced league rivals Rapid. In the semifinals, they were beaten 4-1 by Yugoslavian Cup winners Dinamo Zagreb. In the final on June 5, 1951, Wacker twice took the lead, but eventually lost 3-2.\nIn 1953, Wacker finished as runners-up for the sixth time, just one point behind Austria, this time scoring 101 goals in just 26 games. The decisive match of the championship came in the 24th round on June 7, 1953, in a head-to-head encounter between the two title rivals. In front of 45,000 fans at the Prater Stadium, the Meidlingers could only manage a 1-1 draw; a win would have secured the title. In the championship final, they did manage a 7-2 away win over SK Sturm Graz, but the Austrians went on to defeat Grazer SC 12-3. In the same year, Turl Brinek was called up to the FIFA World Cup squad, but this resulted in a move to AS Monaco. In 1954, Wacker finished third and Franz Pelikan, Walter Kollmann, Walter Haummer and Turl Wagner went to the World Cup in Switzerland, where Austria finished third, with the latter scoring three goals in the quarterfinals against Switzerland. After a fourth place finish in 1955, the Meidling team entered the title race for the last time in the 1955/56 season. Meidling led the league for 28 weeks before facing Austria on the final matchday at the Praterstadion. Their closest rivals were once again Rapid, but this time they had to hope that Meidling would make a mistake. In the decisive match against Austria, Wacker quickly took the lead, but still lost 3-1. Three shots on goal and a missed penalty added to the disappointment - Rapid were champions, Wacker only second for the seventh time. Nevertheless, Wacker's president, Alfred Frey, made sporting history that year: On March 18, 1956, he submitted a proposal to UEFA for the introduction of a European Cup Winners' Cup competition, which was eventually introduced in 1960.\n\n\n=== 1956-1971: Relegation fight and merger with Admira ===\nAfter failing to win the championship in 1956, SC Wacker Wien fell into financial difficulties. In the 1957 and 1958 seasons, the club did well on the field, finishing fourth twice, and Walter Kollmann and the brothers Ernst and Paul Kozlicek represented Wacker at the 1958 World Cup in Sweden. However, sporting success could no longer hide the company's financial shortcomings: In the fall championship of the 1958-59 season, several players - Pelikan, Hager, Schrottenbaum, Wagner I, Wagner II and Kozlicek II - refused to play in the championship match against Grazer AK. The reason was that the club was not able to pay the 100 Schilling bonus for a practice game. Although the strikers were severely punished, their departure from the club led to a significant weakening of the sport. When the team was in need, Hahnemann, now the coach of the Black and Whites, even had to substitute himself in a championship game against Vienna. Despite his 45 years, he scored a goal in that game. In the \"strike season\", the club ended up in eighth place, and SC Wacker was already relegated in 1961, although they were only one point behind non-relegated SV Schwechat and 1. Simmeringer SC in the final standings. The decisive match against Vienna in the last round was lost 2-0 in front of 8,000 spectators. After the first relegation in the club's history, the Meidlingers immediately took first place in the Regionalliga Ost, the second tier of the Austrian Bundesliga, and were promoted back to the Bundesliga in 1962. Once again, however, they fell one point short of staying in the league, this time losing the decisive away match to Wiener Sport-Club 4-2 at the Red-Star-Platz on June 16, 1963. A low point of the season was the abandonment of the home game against Grazer AK on October 7th, 1962 with a score of 1:2 in the 83rd minute due to blatant spectator riots, which resulted in a 0:3 defeat (sources: \"Arbeiterzeitung Wien\" of October 9th, 1962 ff). Another championship in the Regionalliga Ost in 1963/64 brought a return to the Austrian Bundesliga, where at the end of the season on June 20, 1965, the team was already 5 points short of staying in the top division. The picture remained the same for the Meidlinger: again champion of the Ost in 1966, again relegation in 1967, but the exit from the championship, now called National League, was extremely dramatic: this time, with 18 points each, only the worse goal ratio (28:50) compared to SK Sturm Graz (32:47) was decisive, whereby in the final round on June 24, 1967, even a 6:1 home win against bottom club SV Kapfenberg and the fact that Grazer AK won the Graz derby 1-0 did not help. With a nine-point lead, the almost obligatory victory in the second division was achieved again (1967/68), and Wacker changed levels for the eighth time in the eighth season.\nThis to-and-fro between the two leagues is probably unique in Austrian soccer history and tested the endurance of the fans. Attendance figures of up to 12,500 fans in those years were only exceeded by a few clubs such as Rapid or LASK. After avoiding relegation for two seasons, Wacker finished below the red line for the fifth time in ten years in 1971. In addition to sporting and financial problems, there were also difficulties with the stadium in Rosasgasse. The club decided to merge with Admira Energie from Maria Enzersdorf to form FC Admira/Wacker, which was based in Maria Enzersdorf, Lower Austria, at the Bundesstadion Südstadt. This merger was the result of numerous negotiations with various clubs: after relegation in 1966, Wacker was supposed to merge with SV Schwechat and move to Lower Austria, but this was prevented. Wacker's last championship match, not only in Austria's top league, but forever, was against FC Wacker Innsbruck on June 19, 1971 (2-4). Ernst Dokupil scored the final goal for the Black and Whites in the 79th minute, making the final score 2-4. However, the cameras of the reporters in attendance were focused on the visitors from Innsbruck, who were crowned Austrian champions for the first time.\n\n\n=== 1971-1973: Epilogue in Brunn am Gebirge ===\nIf one continues to follow the second division license of Wiener Wacker in 1971, it was initially given to FC Wacker/Admira, the second team of the new merged club FC Admira/Wacker (note the reverse order of the former club names). Although FC Wacker/Admira managed to stay in the second division of Regionalliga Ost with a lead over ASV Siegendorf, the first team to be relegated, they agreed to a joint venture with Brunn am Gebirge, known as Wacker Brunn, on July 5, 1972. Brunn am Gebirge managed to avoid relegation to the Lower Austrian Regional League, but on September 13, 1973, they ended the partnership, which meant the end of an independent \"Wacker\". In its only season, the club had finished 7th out of 14 teams in the regional league.\n\n\n== Stadium and courts ==\n\nWacker found its first permanent home in the \"Sandgrube\", owned by innkeeper Nitsch. Nitsch made his inn available to the club as a club room and allowed the club to build a soccer field on the adjacent property in Edelsinnstraße. The club made its debut on the new pitch in 1909, but lost 3-1 to Hertha in the opening match. Wacker's growing popularity after World War I meant that the club had to move to larger stadiums to accommodate the majority of fans. The construction of a new stadium with a capacity of 20,000 spectators was initiated. The only unused site in Meidling was the so-called \"Wildpark\" near Schönbrunn, which the club was able to acquire after lengthy negotiations.\nThe plans for the new stadium were drawn up by engineer Gold, and the construction work was carried out by the firm of Josef Takacs. The grand opening took place on October 8, 1921; the stadium at Rosasgasse eventually had standing room for 17,000 spectators and seating for 3,000. The first opponent was the old rival Hertha. However, the match had to be abandoned in the 28th minute at a score of 1:1 due to a heavy thunderstorm, and the opening was postponed to the following day, October 9, 1921. The invited team was SK Moravská Slavia from Brno, who were defeated 4-2. National player Johann Kowanda, who had already scored against Hertha, scored three goals. The team's location near Schönbrunn Palace soon earned them the nickname \"Schönbrunner\". Wacker remained in Rosasgasse until their demise in 1971; the pitch still exists today, though the auditorium no longer does. It is available for school sports as the \"Bundesspielplatz Schönbrunn\" (Wackerplatz).\n\n\n== Trainer ==\n\n Hungary Jenő Kalmár (1957–1958)\n\n\n== Players ==\n\nThree players stand out in the history of Wacker and have played a major role in the success of Austrian football: Karli Zischek became a Wacker legend in the 1930s. He was a member of the first Wacker team for almost twenty years, and also played in the 1947 national team. To this day, the striker is one of the top 10 scorers in the national team, and he became famous as the right winger of the Wunderteam. Turl Wagner followed in his footsteps as a top scorer for the '47 team. He made his grand entrance in the heat of Lausanne, the 1954 World Cup quarterfinal against Switzerland, where he scored three goals for Austria. They later finished 3rd. He is also one of the top 10 scorers for the Austrian national team. At that time, however, another Meidling footballer was making a name for himself: Gerhard Hanappi. The former record-breaking Austrian international was named one of the 50 best European footballers of the 20th century by the IFFHS.\nIn addition to Karli Zischek, two other Wacker players earned double-digit caps between the wars. One of them was the chubby Leopold Resch, who also played in the 1923 Cup final. He is described as a player who combined an athletic style of play with a wide range of movement and a mature technique. The famous striker Hansi Horvath also spent three seasons in Meidling in the 1930s. In addition to Turl Wagner, Admira import Willy Hahnemann made a name for himself internationally for Austria in the post-war championship. Wacker player Walter Haummer also made a name for himself as a striker for the national team. In midfield, Turl Brinek, known for his long-range shots, also shone alongside Hanappi. Defender Walter Kollmann made a name for himself with his speed and commitment. The last Wacker players to play for the national team were brothers Ernst and Paul Kozlicek, who played together in the '58 World Cup.\nAustrian national players:\n\nCalled up to the FIFA world team\n\n1953 Theodor Brinek Jr.\n\n\n== Meidling and its Schönbrunn residents - attempts at revitalization ==\nFor decades, Wacker was the figurehead of Meidling and made the \"twelfth blow\" famous throughout the country. The history of the club, which no longer exists, is featured prominently in the Vienna district museum of Meidling, where former players such as Ernst Reitermaier were involved. Soon after Wacker's departure and the merger, several attempts were made to revive the club.\nThe first attempt to re-establish SC Wacker Wien was made with Wacker 72, but this club only played in the Vienna lower leagues and was absorbed by ASK Liesing. Another attempt in the 1980s was crowned with temporary success: Under the traditional name of Wacker Wien, the new club at least managed to make headlines in the local press. In an effort to get the name Wacker back on the top flight scoresheet, Wacker Wien played in the fourth division of the Vienna City League in the 1987/1988 season and finished third. After merging with Groß Viktoria to form Wacker/Groß Viktoria, the club was promoted to the third division of the Regionalliga Ost a year later. But the rise was too fast, and financial problems brought the new Wacker to its knees. Three rounds before the end of the season, chairman Anton Cupak announced that despite a good mid-table position, the club would be voluntarily relegated and part ways with Viktoria.\nWacker then spent a few more years in the fourth-tier Vienna City League and even won the Vienna Soccer Cup in 1995, beating Gersthofer SV 4-2 in the final. This was certainly the most curious chapter in Wacker's history. After the newly founded club was forced to close its doors, Wacker Vienna moved to the small market town of Lichtenwörth in Lower Austria. In fact, the local ASK Lichtenwörth temporarily played as SC Wacker-Wien-Lichtenwörth from November 26, 1999. Another attempt to revive SC Wacker Wien was made in 2005: The newly founded club plays its matches at Wiener-Viktoria-Platz under its traditional name. In the 2009-10 season, Wacker won the championship in Austria's lowest division (Wiener 3. Klasse) and played in the second lowest division (Wiener 2. Klasse) from the 2010-11 season. However, on October 9, 2012, the club merged with Borussia Hetzendorf, which brought this attempt to an abrupt end. In 2018, SC Wacker Wien was revived: The newly formed club won promotion to the 1. Klasse A (Austria's seventh highest division) by finishing runner-up in the 2. Klasse A (Austria's eighth highest division), but had to abandon the championship midway through the season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

        "content": "The Movement for the Republic – Patriotic Camp (Polish: Ruch dla Rzeczypospolitej – Obóz Patriotyczny, RdR–OP) was a political party in Poland. It was a party that split from the Movement for the Republic (RdR), with the split being caused by differences of opinion in regards to the party's position and possible cooperation with the President Lech Wałęsa. The RdR–OP was led by Romuald Szeremietiew who supported cooperation with the President, and was narrowly elected the leader of RdR in 1993. However, the party leadership annulled the results of the election, and elected Olszewski in the name of Szeremietiew, prompting the split. The party was a right-leaning movement and was strongly supportive of not only the President Lech Wałęsa, but also the efforts to form a united centre-right front against the post-communist left in Poland.\nThe party participated in numerous coalitions and alliances with centrist and centre-right groupings. In 1994, it became a co-founder of a centre-right coalition Covenant for Poland (Polish: Przymierze dla Polski). Initially named \"Szeremietew's RdR\", the party also joined a federation of parties known as the Patriotic Camp (Polish: Obóz Patriotyczny) in 1996, and renamed itself Movement for the Republic – Patriotic Camp. In 1997, the party intensively participated in talks regarding a formation of a new coalition that would unite the Polish anti-communist and centre-right organisations. The project proved successful and became known as Solidarity Electoral Action (AWS). In December 1997, the RdR–OP dissolved to join the Social Movement, which became a political party uniting independents and minor parties that participated in AWS.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn December 1992, the Movement for the Republic (RdR) was founded by former prime minister Jan Olszewski and his supporters, protesting the downfall of Olszewski's cabinet and his abandonment by their erstwhile party, the centrist Centre Agreement. A year after the formation of Movement for the Republic, a national congress of the RdR was held on 12 December 1993, where Romuald Szeremietiew spoke against Olszewski and postulated closer ties with centrist and centre-right, to which Olszewski was sceptical. \nIn the elections for party chairman, Szeremietiew defeated Olszewski by a ratio of 106 votes to 100. Dissatisfied supporters of the former prime minister called a congress of the RDC in March 1994, at which they annulled the decisions of the previous one and elected Stanisław Węgłowski as the new chairman. Olszewski, who aspired to the role of leader of the entire right, preferred to remain non-partisan, was entrusted with the position of honorary chairman of the Movement. These decisions we not recognised by Szeremietiew, which sparked months of compromising disputes over the right to use the name RdR.\nSzeremietiew then split from the Movement for the Republic (RdR), and founded Movement for the Republic – Patriotic Camp together with RdR members who sought to cooperate with the incumbent President, Lech Wałęsa. Until 3 February 1996, the party operated under the name \"Movement for the Republic\" (Polish: Ruch dla Rzeczypospolitej), the same name as the party they split from, though in that period, it was commonly known as \"Szeremietiew's RdR\" (Polish: RdR Szeremietiewa).\nIn January 1994, it took part in many attempts at coalescing the \"center-right\" in Poland, mainly with the Centre Agreement (PC), Christian National Union (ZChN), Peasants' Agreement (PSL-PL) and Conservative Coalition (KK), which resulted in the founding of the Covenant for Poland (PdP). The party supported Lech Wałęsa in the 1995 Polish presidential election. In 1996, the party became part of the Patriotic Camp - a political party with a \"federative\" structure. \nHowever, the Covenant for Poland, co-founded by the RdR–OP, began to disintegrate in autumn 1994. This was influenced both by the conflict between Kaczyński and Szeremietiew (among other things, over the direction of the PdP's expansion), and by the battles within ZChN between the President's opponents and a strong pro-Pressident faction. Disputes within the coaltiion intensified when, in October 1994, the ZChN Wiesław Chrzanowski resigned from the post of party president, justifying it with his age. The chairman's duties were taken over by 31-year-old Ryszard Czarnecki, whose mandate was formally confirmed at the Fourth ZChN Congress in March 1995. However, the election of the moderate Czarnecki further accelerated the dissolution of the PdP. \nBefore the collapse of the Covenant of Poland, it managed to conclude a cooperation agreement with the 11 November Agreement (Polish: Porozumienie 11 Listopada) in January 1995, under which the joint programme principles were developed. While the Covenant of Poland became a dysfunctional coalition that was unable to cooperate, the 11 November Agreement gave way to further alliances between various centre-right parites. \nIn 1996, the approaching prospect of parliamentary elections and the lack of real chances for individual groupings to gain power in the next election spurred cooperation between centre-right parties, and the Solidarity trade union became involved in coordinating and forming a united centre-right front. Starting in 8 June 1996, Szeremietiew took part in the creation of the Solidarity Electoral Action. By 1997, RdR–OP dissolved as it became part of the Social Movement AWS.\n\n\n== Electoral results ==\n\n\n=== Presidential ===\n\n\n== Ideology ==\nThe Movement for the Republic – Patriotic Camp was considered a centre-right and a right-wing grouping. The party claimed to base its ideology on Catholic social teaching aswell as the preceding RdR and PPN. It believed in restructuring the seperation of powers, to include foreign policy and management of local governments within the reach of the Senate, while removing its legislative powers.\nEconomically, it supported free market economics, private ownership, privatization, reprivatization and integration with the European Union. The party considered it necessary for a development of a \"proper free market economy\" to carry out reprivatization, as well as deepening economic and military cooperation with Western organisations. The party also spoke out in favour of Poland's membership in NATO, along with maintaining friendly relations with Lithuania, Ukraine and Belarus. \nIt called for granting adults the right to own firearms and allowing for their use for self-defence on one's property. The party also postulated the introduction of compulsory 'general territorial defense' training, which would include all male citizens aged 18 to 55. The party's leader, Romuald Szeremietiew, was known for its hawkish rhetoric, advocating for compulsory military service and the territorial defence training, which became his trademark proposal. According to Szeremietiew and his party, the Polish military was to be composed of 100,000 soldiers, and the territorial defence of at least 120,000 active cadets.\nAs its main political objective, the RdR–OP aimed to unite conservative forces, which manifested itself in participation in many unsuccessful merger attempts and internal disputes, including with Akcja Polska represented by Antoni Macierewicz. In June 1994, the party signed the Memorandum for the Covenant for Poland, together with numerous centre-right and centrist parties. In 1996, it then co-founded the Solidarity Electoral Action, being one of the most active participants in the unification talks with other right-leaning parties.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMovement for the Republic\nChristian National Union\nCoalition for the Republic\nConfederation of Independent Poland\nMovement for Reconstruction of Poland\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Notes ==",

        "content": "Yasuji Okada (born 1968) is a Japanese molecular biologist and physician. He is a professor at the University of Tokyo. He is known for his research in single-molecule biology and bioimage informatics, notably discovering that kinesin can move as a single molecule. Collaborating with Olympus, he also developed a high-speed, high-resolution spinning disk super-resolution microscopy technique. He is the chief researcher at the University of Tokyo’s International Research Centre for Neurointelligence, leading the Information Physics of Living Matters project. This project had already secured 1.15 billion yen (approximately US$10 million) of government research grant before it started.\n\n\n== Career ==\nOkada entered Nada Junior High School in 1981 and Nada High School in 1984. Commuting by train from his home in Osaka, he spent his travel time reading extensively. During his high school years, he read \"Mechanics\" by Landau and Lifshitz, part of the Course of Theoretical Physics series, and \"The Feynman Lectures on Physics\". \nIn 1987, Okada matriculated at the University of Tokyo. Facing a decision in his second year there between the Medical School and the Department of Biochemistry in the Faculty of Science (Shinfuri), he chose Medicine following advice from Yoshinori Ohsumi. He began his doctoral studies in 1993. He focused on single-molecule biology using specialised optical microscopy to visualise the physical movements of individual molecules. While the prevailing theory was that kinesin motor proteins worked like two-legged walking, Okada discovered cases where a single molecule could move independently. Okada’s doctoral thesis was titled \"The motility mechanism of the single-headed kinesin motor, KIF1A\".\nAround 2005, he and his graduate students discovered the role of Kinesin-2, cilia, and flagella in determining the left-right asymmetry of the heart, a condition referred to as situs inversus. \nIn 2015, in collaboration with Olympus Corporation, he developed a super-resolution fluorescence microscope with approximately 100 nanometers spatial resolution and 10 milliseconds temporal resolution, named \"spinning disk super-resolution microscopy\". This technique was noted for being a hundred times faster than existing super-resolution microscopy methods and achieved the world's fastest shutter speed.\n\n\n== External links ==\nOkada-lab\nInternational Research Centre for Neurointelligence, University of Tokyo\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Bill Palmer was an American swim coach for the AAU Central Jersey Aquatic Club, coaching the team from 1961-1988, and leading them to an AAU National Championship in 1976.  Palmer's Shore Aquatic Club which he founded in 1961, became known as the Central Jersey Aquatic Club around 1972 when it merged with Rutger's swimming coach Frank Elm's Scarlet Jets, an AAU team.  During his long coaching career which included coaching the Durango Masters after 1996, Palmer coached five American Olympic swimmers including 1968 Olympic team alternate Cathy Corcione, 1976 Olympians Kathy Heddy, and gold medalist Wendy Boglioli.  South African swimmer Jonty Skinner swam with Palmer at the Central Jersey Aquatic Club and was a world record holder in the 100-meter freestyle in 1976.\n\n\n== Education ==\nPalmer was born on June 13, 1938, in West Long Branch, New Jersey to Hazel and Francis Palmer. During his High School Years, he attended the West Long Branch school system, as well as the Fishburne Military School in Waynesboro, Virginia.  His parents operated Marpal Disposal in Tinton Falls, New Jersey, where he worked between swimming assignments.  In college he went to the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, but graduated from Monmouth University, where several of his future New Jersey swimmers would compete.\n\n\n== Coaching swimming ==\nOne of Palmer's earliest swim coaching assignments after graduating Monmouth University, was his Driftwood by the Sea Swimming Team which won the Shore Junior Championships against eight other clubs at Driftwood Beach Club on the Jersey Shore in Seabright, New Jersey in late July 1959. In June 1960, as coach of Driftwood Swim Club, Palmer attended the National Indoor Championship at Yale University.  In August 1962, Palmer's Driftwood Beach Club Swimming Team soundly won the Quadrangular swimming meet championship at the Surfrider Beach Club for the third straight year, winning 12 of 20 individual events and taking seven of eight relay races.  In 1963, Palmer's had eight of ten of the local newspaper Daily Record's All Star Swim team members which included future stars Cathy Corcione and Sue Halfacre.\nHe began coaching swimming for his most memorable team, New Jersey's Shore Aquatic Club in 1961 in Monmouth County, New Jersey.  In 1963, the Shore Aquatic Club was unofficially ranked second among age group clubs in New Jersey behind the Summit YMCA team.  In the 1970's the team combined with the Scarlet Jets Club, coached by Frank Elms of Rutgers University, and Palmer continued coaching the new club to be known as Central Jersey Aquatic Club through 1988.  In 1968, Elms coached the American Olympic Women's team.  In 1972, Palmer's Shore Aquatic Club, having already become known as the Central Jersey Aquatic Club, and considered a top New Jersey program, met at the Peddle School pool in Nightstown, New Jersey, and in the summer met at an outdoor pool at Scabright, New Jersey.  Coach Palmer noted that the team suffered from a lack of swimming facilities in their area.    Palmer led the Shore Aquatic Club team then known as the Central Jersey Aquatic Club in 1976 to a National Championship of the American Athletic Union in both the senior women’s and the combined categories for men and women.\nIn 1988, Palmer sold the club, and two outstanding New Jersey Shore Aquatic Club former swimmers, Corinna Weinkofsky and Cathy Corcione took over as coaches.  Palmer moved to Durango, Colorado in 1996, and began coaching the Durango Masters Swim Team.\n\n\n== Outstanding swimmers ==\nThe most outstanding swimmer on Palmer's 1976 Central Jersey Aquatic Club team was Wendy Boglioli, who at the 1976 Montreal Olympics captured a gold medal in the 400-meter freestyle relay and won a bronze medal in the 100-meter butterfly. Kathy Heddy, who swam with Wendy Boglioli at Central Jersey Aquatic Club also swam in the 1976 Olympics. In total, Central Jersey Aquatic Club, under Palmer including its two prior programs, had three Olympic team members, but many who attended the trials.  An early swimmer with the Shore Aquatic Club under Palmer was John Clews, who swam for Red Bank High School and qualified for the State Finals in 1973, taking a second place in the 200-yard freestyle.\nJonty Skinner, who swam briefly for Central Jersey Aquatic Club under Palmer, set a World Record at the U.S. Senior National Championships in the 100-meter freestyle one week after the 1976 Montreal Olympics, breaking Olympian gold medalist Jim Montgomery's newly set record in the event. Corinna Weinkofsky, who took over coaching the Central Jersey Aquatic Club, also swam for the club under Palmer, and was a seven-time state High School champion and a four-time All American at Arizona State.\n\nCathy Corcione, who swam for Princeton, was the Shore Swimming Club's first Olympian under Palmer in 1968, ranking first in the world in the 100 freestyle, fifth in the 200 IM, and second in the 200 backstroke, an event in which she broke the American record. As a 15-year old Junior at Long Branch High School, Corcione qualified for the 1968 Mexico City Olympics in the 400-meter freestyle event as an alternate, but did not get the opportunity to swim in Mexico City due to an overabundance of talent that year.  Susan Halfacre, a 1972 Olympic Trial swimmer, swam for the University of Florida and for Palmer as well.  Ken Winfield was another outstanding swimmer for Palmer, who attended both the 1968 and 1972 Olympic Trials, swam for Red Bank High School, and Michigan State, and was ranked eighth in the world in the 200 butterfly, but did not swim in the Olympics.  Another outstanding swimmer for the Central Jersey Aquatic Club was Judy Melick, who participated in the 1972 Munich Olympics, but may have swam primarily under Central Jersey Aquatic Club Coach Frank Elm before his club was combined with Palmer's Shore Aquatic Club.\nBill's athletic pursuits included biking, skiing, and triathlons. He participated in nearly 200 triathlons, which included the Ironman in Kona, Hawaii.\n\n\n== Honors ==\nBill was honored as a Coach of the Year by United States Masters Swimming, both with his Central Jersey Aquatic Club team in New Jersey, and his Durango Masters team in Colorado.\nPalmer died on December 30, 2020, in Durango, Colorado.  He was survived by his wife, Mary Anne Nelson, and had four children, three girls and a boy.  He was survived by four grandchildren.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSwimswam magazine, Bill Palmer, Founder of Central Jersey Aquatic Club Dies\nDurango Herald, William Palmer, Obituary",

        "content": "The Dodge Challenger is a full-size automobile produced by American automobile manufacturer Dodge. The first use of the Challenger name by Dodge was in 1959 for marketing a \"value version\" of the full-sized Coronet Silver Challenger.\nFrom model years 1970 to 1974, the first generation Dodge Challenger pony car was built using the Chrysler E platform in hardtop and convertible body styles sharing major components with the Plymouth Barracuda.\n\n\n== Model history ==\nIntroduced in the autumn of 1969 for the 1970 model year, the Challenger was one of two Chrysler E-body cars, the other being the slightly smaller Plymouth Barracuda. Positioned to compete against the Mercury Cougar and Pontiac Firebird in the upper end of the pony car market segment, it was \"a rather late response\" to the Ford Mustang, which debuted in April 1964. Even so, Chrysler intended the new Challenger as the most potent pony car ever, and like the less expensive Barracuda, it was available in a staggering number of trim and option levels, and with virtually every engine in Chrysler's inventory.\nThe first usage of the \"challenger\" name was for a trim package in 1959 called the Dodge Silver Challenger which was a two-door coupe only.\nThe Challenger's longer wheelbase, larger dimensions, and more luxurious interior were prompted by the launch of the 1967 Mercury Cougar, likewise, a bigger, more luxurious, and more expensive pony car aimed at affluent young American buyers. The 110 in (2,800 mm) wheelbase was 2 in (51 mm) longer than the Barracuda's, and the Dodge differed substantially in its sheet metal, much as the Cougar differed from the shorter-wheelbase Mustang. Air conditioning and a rear window defogger were optional. With 1971 being the sole exception, the front ends of both cars differed from each other in that the Challenger had four headlights and the Barracuda had only two; a trend replicated by offerings from Chrysler's rivals. \n\nThe exterior design was penned by Carl Cameron, who was also responsible for the exterior designs of the 1966 Dodge Charger. Cameron based the 1970 Challenger grille on an older sketch of a stillborn 1966 Charger prototype that was to have a turbine engine. The pony car segment was already declining by the time the Challenger arrived. Sales fell dramatically after 1970, and though sales rose for the 1973 model year with over 27,800 cars being sold, Challenger production ceased midway through the 1974 model year. A total of 165,437 first-generation Challengers were sold.\n\n\n=== Model years ===\n\n\n==== 1970 ====\nFor its introductory model year the Challenger was available in two series, Challenger and Challenger R/T, and three models, two-door hardtop, Special Edition two-door hardtop, or convertible. The base model was the Challenger with either an inline-6 or V8 engine. The Special Edition hardtop, available on either the base Challenger or on the R/T, added a number of appearance, convenience, and comfort features. Produced for the 1970 model year only, this more luxurious SE specification included as standard a vinyl roof with a \"SE\" medallions on the pillars, a smaller \"formal\" rear window, leather and vinyl bucket seats, and an overhead interior console that contained three warning lights (door ajar, low fuel, and seatbelts). The standard engine on the base model was a 225 cu in (3.7 L) Straight-6. The standard engine on the higher trim models was a 318 cu in (5.2 L) V8 with a 2-barrel carburetor. For 1970, the optional engines included the 340 and 383 cu in (5.6 and 6.3 L), as well as the 440 and 426 cu in (7.2 and 7.0 L) V8s, all with a standard 3-speed manual transmission, except for the 290 hp (216.3 kW) 383 cu in. engine, which was available only with the TorqueFlite automatic transmission. A 4-speed manual was optional on all engines except the 225 cu in (3.7 L) Inline-6 and the 2-barrel 383 cu in (6.3 L) V8.\nThe performance model was the Challenger R/T (Road/Track), with a 383 cu in (6.3 L) \"Magnum\" V8, rated at 335 hp (250 kW); 300 hp (224 kW) for 1971, due to a drop in compression. The standard transmission was a 3-speed manual. Optional R/T engines were the 375 hp (280 kW) 440 cu in (7.2 L) Magnum, the 390 hp (291 kW) 440 cu in (7.2 L) Six-Pack and the 426 cu in (7.0 L) Hemi rated at 425 hp (431 PS; 317 kW) at 5,000 rpm and 490 lb⋅ft (664 N⋅m) of torque at 4,000 rpm. The R/T was available in either the hardtop or convertible. The Challenger R/T came with a Rallye instrument cluster that included a 150 mph (240 km/h) speedometer, an 8,000 rpm tachometer and an oil pressure gauge. The shaker hood scoop was not available after 1971.\nA mid-year introduction was the low-priced Challenger Deputy, a coupe with fixed rear quarter windows lacking some of the base car's trim with fixed rear side glass as the most notable identifier. This model was named after a \"sheriff-type\" character that was featured in television commercials by Dodge at the time.\n\n\n==== The 1970 Dodge Challenger T/A ====\n\nA special model only available for the 1970 model year was the Challenger T/A (Trans Am) racing homologation car. In order to race in the Sports Car Club of America's Trans American Sedan Championship Trans Am, Dodge built a street version of its race car (just like Plymouth with its Plymouth 'Cuda AAR) which it called the Dodge Challenger T/A (Trans Am). Although the race cars ran a destroked version of the 340, street versions took the 340 and added a trio of two-barrel carburetors atop an aluminum intake manifold, creating the 340 Six Pack. Dodge rated the 340 Six Pack at 290 hp (216 kW), only 15 hp (11 kW) more than the original 340 engine (which also had the same rating as the Camaro Z/28 and Ford Boss 302 Mustang). Air came in through a suitcase-sized air scoop molded into the pinned-down, hinged matte-black fiberglass hood. A low-restriction dual-outlet exhaust ran to the stock muffler location, then reversed direction to exit in chrome-tipped \"megaphone\" outlets in front of the rear wheels. Options included a TorqueFlite automatic or pistol-grip Hurst-shifted four-speed transmission, 3.55:1 or 3.90:1 gear ratios, as well as manual or power steering. Front disc brakes were standard. The special Rallye suspension used heavy-duty parts and increased the rate of the rear springs. The T/A was one of the first U.S. muscle cars to fit different size tires at the front and rear: E60x15 Goodyear Polyglas in the front, and G60x15 on the rear axle. The modified chamber elevated the tail enough to clear the rear tires and its side exhaust outlets. Thick dual side stripes, bold ID graphics, a fiberglass ducktail rear spoiler, and a fiberglass front spoiler were also included. The interior was identical to other Challengers.\nDodge contracted Ray Caldwell's Autodynamics in Marblehead, Massachusetts to run the factory Trans-Am team. Sam Posey drove the No.77 \"sub-lime\" painted car that Caldwell's team built from a car taken off a local dealer's showroom floor. When the No.76 was completed mid-season from a chassis provided by Dan Gurney's All American Racers, Posey alternated between the two. Both cars ran the final two races, with Posey in the #77. Ronnie Bucknum drove the No.76 at Seattle, Washington, and Tony Adamowicz drove it at Riverside, California.\nThe Challenger T/A's scored a few top-three finishes, but lack of a development budget and the short-lived Keith Black built 303 cu in (5.0 L) engines led to Dodge leaving the series at season's end. The street version suffered from severe understeer in fast corners, largely due to the smaller front tires. A total of 2,399 T/As were made. A 1971 model using the 340 engine with a 4-barrel carburetor was planned and appeared in advertising, but was not produced since Dodge had withdrawn from the race series.\n\n\n==== 1971 ====\nFor the 1971 model year the Challenger Coupe became the entry-level model, with either a straight-six or V8 engine. Like the Challenger Deputy it replaced, it had fixed rear quarter windows and a basic black steering wheel with horn button.\n\n\n==== 1972 ====\nFor the 1972 model year, the options lists (both for performance and appearance/convenience items) had been drastically cut back. The convertible version (though a sunroof was made available), most interior upgrade options (in particular leather seats), comfort/convenience items (in particular power windows and power seats), and all the big-block engine options were gone. The R/T series was replaced by the Challenger Rallye series. The Rallye model featured four simulated vents on the front fenders, from which exited matte black strobe tape stripes. Engine choices were down to three: the 225 cu in (3.7 L) slant-6, 318 cu in (5.2 L) V8, and a 340 cu in (5.6 L) V8 that was equipped with a 4-barrel carburetor, dual exhausts, as well as a performance-oriented camshaft and heads. All three engines were detuned to lower compression ratios in order to run on lead-free gasoline, and the horsepower ratings were lowered to reflect the more accurate Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) net horsepower calculations. Each engine could be mated to a 3-speed manual or automatic transmission, while the 340 could also be equipped with a 4-speed manual if so ordered. The performance axle ratios were also gone except for a 3.55 sure grip which could only be had with the 340 and the heavy-duty suspension. The 1972 models also received a new grille that extended beneath the front bumper, as well as new rear tail-lights. Toward the end of the 1971 model year, a few convertibles were made with the 1972 front end (grille, lights, etc.) and rear end (tail lights and their panel). The only way to ascertain these 1972 Challenger convertibles is to look at its fender tag. On the code line which gives the dealer order number, that number will start with an \"R\", which designates \"Special Meaning\" (in this case, a TV 'special promotions' car).\n\n\n==== 1973–1974 ====\n\nThe 1972 grille and tail-light arrangement were carried over for the 1973 (and 1974) model years, and the mandatory 5 mph bumpers were added. While the 225 cu in (3.7 L) six-cylinder engine was dropped, (leaving just the two V8s), all option lists otherwise were carry-overs from 1972.\nFor 1974, the 340 cu in (5.6 L) engine was replaced by a 360 cu in (5.9 L) version offering 245 hp (183 kW), but the pony car market had fallen off and production of Challengers ceased in late April 1974.\n\n\n=== Cosmetic variations ===\n\nAlthough the body style remained the same throughout the Challenger's five-year run, there were two notable changes to the front grille. The 1971 models had a \"split\" grille, while 1972 introduced a design that extended the grille (nicknamed the \"sad-mouth\") beneath the front bumper. With this change to the front end, 1972 through 1974 models had little to no variation. The only way to properly distinguish them is that the 1972s had flush-mounted bumpers with no bumper guards, (small bumper guards were optional), while both the 1973 and 1974 models had the protruding \"5 mph (8.0 km/h)\" bumpers (with a rubber-type filler behind them) in conjunction with large bumper guards. The 1974 cars had larger rear bumper guards to meet the (new for 1974 and on) rear 5 mph (8.0 km/h) rear impact law. These changes were made to meet U.S. regulations regarding crash test safety.\n\nThe 1970 taillights went all the way across the back of the car, with the backup light in the middle. In 1971, the backup lights were on the left and right instead of the middle. The taillight array also changed for 1972 onwards, with the Challenger now having four individual rectangular lamps.\n\n\n=== Collectibility ===\nAlthough few mourned the end of the E-body models, the passage of time has created legends and highlighted the unique personalities of both the Challenger and the Barracuda. With a low total production, as well as low survivability over the years, any Challenger is worth a substantial amount of money. In a historic review, the editors of Edmunds Inside Line ranked these models as: 1970 was a \"great\" year, 1971 was a \"good\" one, and then \"three progressively lousier ones\" (1972–1974).\n\n\n=== Export markets ===\nDodge Challengers were mainly produced for the U.S. and Canadian markets. Chrysler officially sold Challengers to Switzerland through AMAG Automobil- und Motoren AG in Schinznach-Bad, near Zürich. Only a few cars were shipped overseas each year to AMAG. They did the final assembly of the Challengers and converted them to Swiss specifications. There are few AMAG cars still in existence. From a collector's point of view, these cars are very desirable. Today, fewer than five Swiss Challengers are known to exist in North America.\nChrysler exported Dodge Challengers officially to France as well through their Chrysler France Simca operation, since Ford sold the Mustang in France successfully in small numbers. However, only a few Challengers were exported and Chrysler finally gave up the idea of selling them in France.\n\n\n=== Engines ===\nThe SAE gross horsepower ratings were determined testing the engine with no accessories, no air cleaner, or open dyno headers. In 1971 compression ratios were reduced in performance engines, except the 426 cu in (7.0 L) and the high performance 440 cu in (7.2 L), to accommodate regular gasoline. 1971 was the last year for the 426 cu in (7.0 L) Hemi.\n\n\n=== Production numbers ===\n\n\n== Racing ==\nThe Challenger was introduced to the SCCA Trans Am Series in 1970. Two factory-backed cars were prepared by Ray Caldwell's Autodynamics and driven by Sam Posey and Tony Adamowicz. The No.77 car was built at Autodynamics from a street Challenger T/A that was taken from a local dealer showroom. The No.76 chassis arrived mid-season from Dan Gurney's All-American Racers and was completed by Autodynamics.\nDodge's early to mid-1970s factory-supported \"Kit Car\" program for short-track late-model stock car racing offered a choice of Challenger, and a few (less than 12) were made, but in 1974 Dodge ended the Challenger line and they went to the Dodge Dart Sports and Dodge Aspen bodies over a steel-tube chassis.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nDodge Challenger (1970) at Curlie\nDodge Challenger: History of the Dodge Pony Car",

Scott was involved in the Apollo Program, and served as project chief for the Mars geologic mapping program, which was funded by NASA's Planetology Program Office.  He continued to publish scientific articles on Mars through the 1990s.\nAccording to Don Wilhelms in his 1993 book To a Rocky Moon:\n\n[The USGS Branch of Astrogeology was] able to consider hiring David Holcomb Scott, a former oil company chief geologist and chief of exploration.  [Scott] came up to me after a talk I gave in February 1966 at UCLA – which he missed – and said he wanted to do something new and interesting. He hurried through his Ph.D. and in a few years took on a mapping load that three ordinary geologists could not have upheld.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nScott, D.H.; Trask, N.J.

        "content": "Tran Gorge (Bulgarian: Трънско ждрело, also known as Lomnitsa Gorge or the Gorge of the River Erma) is a is a canyon-like gorge along the river Erma in the easternmost part of the Ruy mountain range of western Bulgaria. Administratively, it is situated in Tran Municipality of Pernik Province, lying some 3 km north of the municipal center Tran and just south of the Bulgaria–Serbia border. Tran Gorge is among the 100 Tourist Sites of Bulgaria of the Bulgarian Tourist Union.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nTran Gorge takes its beginning southeast of the village of Lomnitsa at an altitude of 677 m and heads northeast. In 300 m it reaches its narrowest section, some 100 m long and 5 m wide, where the altitude is about 650 m. At the narrowest section, some 120 m deep and 150 m long, two rocks tower over both shores the river Erma, called Tsarkvishteto (the Church) and Zhilav Kamak (the Hardy Rock).  Downstream the gorge widens and its slopes remain relatively steep. It ends southwest of the village of Bogoyna at an altitude of 630 m. The total length of the gorge is 2.8 km, with an average altitude of 650 m.\nThe river Erma has cut down about 120 m in the Upper Jurassic limestone foundations and the surrounding slopes are steep, at places vertical. Geologically, the gorge is cut in strong limestones with a complex and varied structure, formed about 200 million years ago in a sea basin. It is quite narrow at its base and the river forms karst channels and small waterfalls. Up to the middle section, the walls of the Tran Gorge are vertical, and their width does not exceed 10–15 m. It was formed over millions of years by an erosion process from the impact of the river, which little by little made its way through the rock.\n\n\n== Nature ==\n\nIt was declared a natural landmark in 1961 under the name Gorge of the River Erma to “preserve its unique rock formations”. The gorge is situated in a forested area of the small Ruy mountain range, just north of the Znepole valley, and is home to diverse flora and fauna. The surrounding area contains numerous bird species, including European honey buzzard, common buzzard, Long-legged buzzard, Montagu's harrier, golden eagle, booted eagle, Eurasian sparrowhawk, saker falcon, common kestrel, Eurasian hobby, European bee-eater, Eurasian eagle-owl, white stork, corn crake, European nightjar, common kingfisher, European roller, Syrian woodpecker, middle spotted woodpecker, woodlark, barred warbler, red-backed shrike, ortolan bunting, etc.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nThe gorge and its surroundings are picturesque and easily accessible from the capital Sofia via the second class II-63 road. The gorge lies about 3 km north of the town of Tran via a signed paved road. From the southern end of the gorge begins the 13 km-long Tran eco-trail; it takes about 8 hours to walk its entire length. Another starting point for the eco-trail is the village of Bankya, close to another natural landmark, the Yablanitsa Gorge. The trail contains a series of flat sections mostly along the river, but there are also many steep ascents and descents, bridges and stairs. There are alpine climbing routes on Tsarkvishteto and Zhilav Kamak rocks. A 200 m tunnel passes under Zhilav Kamak, excavated in the early XX century for a railway line between the towns of Tran and Tsaribrod, when the latter belonged to Bulgaria. There are trails leading to nearby villages, as well as to the summit of Ruy (1,706 m).\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== References ==\nМичев (Michev), Николай (Nikolay); Михайлов (Mihaylov), Цветко (Tsvetko); Вапцаров (Vaptsarov), Иван (Ivan); Кираджиев (Kiradzhiev), Светлин (Svetlin) (1980).

        "content": "Nicholas Stephanopoulos is an American legal scholar who is the Kirkland & Ellis Professor of Law at Harvard Law School. His scholarship primarily focuses on election law, constitutional law, and the interplay between law and democracy. Recognized as a leading expert in election law, his work has been cited numerous times by the United States Supreme Court. He has contributed significantly to the study of partisan gerrymandering and is a co-founder of PlanScore, a platform for evaluating district plans. He co-invented the efficiency gap, a metric used to measure potential gerrymandering in electoral systems, which quantifies the fairness of districting by calculating wasted votes. \nIn October 2022, Stephanopoulos was elected to the American Law Institute.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nStephanopoulos earned his AB in Government from Harvard College, graduating summa cum laude. He then obtained an M.Phil. in European Studies from University of Cambridge, followed by a JD from Yale Law School, where he was the Editor-in-Chief of the Yale Journal of International Law.\n\n\n== Legal career ==\nBefore his current position at Harvard, Stephanopoulos was a Professor of Law at the University of Chicago Law School. He has also been an Associate-in-Law at Columbia Law School and worked as an associate in the Washington, D.C., office of Jenner & Block LLP. Early in his career, he clerked for Judge Raymond C. Fisher of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\nStephanopoulos has contributed to the New York Times, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune, The Atlantic, The New Republic, Slate, and Vox. \nHe has played a significant role in several high-profile litigation efforts, including the Supreme Court case Gill v. Whitford. In the 2023 case Allen v. Milligan, the Supreme Court's decision heavily relied on an amicus brief submitted by the Election Law Clinic, representing Stephanopoulos and other scholars. This brief was cited several times in the Court's opinion. It provided empirical evidence about the effectiveness of Section 2 of the VRA and highlighted the potential consequences of undermining this provision, which aims to protect the electoral opportunities for communities of color.\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\nStephanopoulos, Nicholas (2019). \"Disparate Impact, Unified Law\" (PDF).

        "content": "Raw Material (German: Rohstoff) is a 1984 autobiographical novel by the German writer Jörg Fauser. Set in the 1960s, it follows the author's alter ego Harry Gelb as he lives as a heroin addict in Istanbul, as an alcoholic, menial worker and struggling writer in a Berlin commune, and as a squatter in Frankfurt. Gelb rejects everything he regards as insipid, hierarchical and doctrinaire, whether it is mainstream culture or left-wing revolutionary groups.\nFauser and Raw Material developed a cult following in Germany. The book has been compared to American beat literature and the works of Charles Bukowski. It was published in Jamie Bulloch's English translation in 2014.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Dodge Challenger is a full-size muscle car that was introduced in early 2008 originally as a rival to the evolved fifth generation Ford Mustang and the fifth generation Chevrolet Camaro.\nIn November 2021, Stellantis announced that 2023 model year would be the final model year for both the LD Dodge Charger and LA Dodge Challenger, as the company will focus its future plans on electric vehicles rather than fossil fuel powered vehicles, due to tougher emissions standards required by the Environmental Protection Agency for the 2023 model year. Challenger production ended on December 22, 2023, and the Brampton, Ontario assembly plant will be re-tooled to assemble an electrified successor.\n\n\n== Model history ==\n\nIn late 2005, Dodge teased spy photos of the Dodge Challenger prototype on the internet and it was announced on November 21, 2005, showing an official drawing sketch of the vehicle. The Dodge Challenger Concept was unveiled at the 2006 North American International Auto Show and was a preview for the 3rd generation Dodge Challenger that started its production in 2008. Many design cues of the Dodge Challenger Concept were adapted from the 1970 Dodge Challenger R/T.\n\n\n=== Initial release ===\nOn December 3, 2007, Chrysler started taking deposits for the 3rd-generation Dodge Challenger which debuted on February 6, 2008, simultaneously at the Chicago Auto Show and Philadelphia International Auto Show. Listing at US$40,095, the new version was a 2-door notchback coupe (seating 5 passengers with over 33 cubic feet (930 L) of rear passenger volume) which shared common design elements with the first generation Challenger, despite being significantly longer and taller. As with Chevrolet's new Camaro, the Challenger concept car's pillarless hardtop body was replaced with a fixed \"B\" pillar, hidden behind the side glass to give an illusion of the hardtop. A convertible version was planned, but cancelled over concerns with weight and a low market demand for convertibles. The LC chassis is a modified (shortened wheelbase) version of the LX platform that underpins the Dodge Charger (LX), Dodge Magnum, and the Chrysler 300. The LX was developed in America from the previous Chrysler LH platform, which had been designed to allow it to be easily upgraded to rear and all-wheel drive. Many Mercedes components were incorporated, or used for inspiration, including the Mercedes-Benz W220 S-class control arm front suspension, the Mercedes-Benz W211 E-Class 5-link rear suspension, the W5A580 5-speed automatic, the rear differential, and the ESP system. All (7119) 2008 models were SRT8s and equipped with the 6.1 L (370 cu in) Hemi V8 engine and a 5-speed AutoStick automatic transmission. The entire 2008 Canadian produced run of 6,400 US market cars were pre-sold and production commenced on May 8, 2008.\nChrysler of Mexico offered only 100 SRT8s, with a 6.1 liter V8 engine rated at 425 horsepower (317 kW; 431 PS) (SAE). Chrysler auctioned off two 2008 SRT8s for charity with the first car going for US$400,000 and a \"B5\" Blue No.43 car with a winning bid of US$228,143.43.\nThe base model Challenger SE was initially powered by a 3.5 L (214 cu in) SOHC V6 engine rated at 250 hp (186 kW; 253 PS) (SAE) and 250 lbf⋅ft (339 N⋅m; 35 kg⋅m) of torque which was coupled to a 4-speed automatic transmission for the first half of 2009, and was then changed to have a standard 5-speed automatic transmission. Several different exterior colors, with either cloth or leather interiors became available. Standard features included air conditioning, power windows, locks, and mirrors; cruise control, and 17-inch (430 mm) aluminum wheels. The Canadian market also sports the SXT trim, similar to the SE, but more generous in terms of standard features. Some of these features being ESP, an alarm system, and 18-inch (460 mm) wheels. Starting with the 2012 model year, the SE was replaced in the U.S. with the SXT model.\nPrevious to the 2012 model year, the SXT version of the Challenger was only sold in Canada and is a more well-equipped variation of the SE. It adds fog lamps, a rear spoiler, larger wheels, illuminated vanity mirrors, a security alarm, and a leather-wrapped shifter. In addition, the SXT has increased option packages available to it that aren't available on the SE, and are also available to the R/T.\n\n\n==== Challenger 500 ====\nChrysler Canada offered a further 670 SRTs uniquely badged as the Challenger 500 (paying homage to Charger and Coronet 500s) all of which were shipped to Canadian Dodge dealers.\n\n\n=== 2009 model year ===\n\nProduction of the limited edition 2008 SRT8s ended in July 2008, and production of the expanded 2009 line-up started in early August of the same year. The expanded offering was the same as had been unveiled earlier that spring at the 2008 New York Auto Show. Chrysler debuted the full Dodge Challenger line-up for 2009, with four different trims – SE, R/T, SRT8, and the SXT in Canada only. In addition to the SRT8, which remained unchanged except for the optional 6-speed manual and standard limited-slip differential, the line-up included the previously mentioned SE and SXT which offered the 250 hp (186 kW) 3.5 L V6. The R/T included a 5.7 L Hemi rated at 372 hp (277 kW; 377 PS) and 398 lb⋅ft (540 N⋅m; 55 kg⋅m) of torque when coupled with the 5 speed automatic, and 375 hp (280 kW; 380 PS) with 404 lb⋅ft (548 N⋅m; 56 kg⋅m) when matched with the same Tremec 6-speed manual transmission as the SRT8.\nNew for 2009 was the Rallye Package for the SE model. The package featured design cues including dual body stripes on the hood and the trunk, chromed fuel cap, decklid spoiler, 18-inch aluminum wheels, and Micro Carbon interior accents.\nThe mid-level Challenger R/T is powered by a 5.7 L (345 cu in) Hemi V8 coupled to a 5-speed automatic transmission or a Tremec TR-6060 6-speed manual transmission. On cars equipped with the automatic transmission, the engine features the Multi-Displacement System and is rated at 372 hp (277 kW; 377 PS) (SAE) and 398 lb⋅ft (540 N⋅m; 55 kg⋅m) torque. With the 6-speed manual transmission, the Multi-Displacement System option was deleted and the engine is rated at 375 hp (280 kW; 380 PS) (SAE) and 404 lb⋅ft (548 N⋅m; 56 kg⋅m) torque. Another feature was the Intelligent Deceleration Fuel Shut-Off (iDFSO) available for the automatic models only. The first to combine both a Multi-Displacement system and fuel shut-off. The final drive ratio was 3.06:1 on cars with the automatic transmission, 3.73:1 on cars with the 6-speed manual and 18-inch (460 mm) wheels or 3.92:1 with the 6-speed manual and optional 20-inch (510 mm) wheels. Also available on R/T was the \"Track Pak\" option group, which includes the Tremec manual transmission, a limited slip differential, and self-leveling rear shock absorbers.\nThe Challenger R/T Classic has retro aspects such as script \"Challenger\" badges on the front panels and black or white \"R/T\" stripes. It comes with a five-speed automatic standard, with an optional six-speed manual transmission including a pistol-grip-shifter. The wheels are Heritage 20-inch Torq-Thrust style specials. It became available in Brilliant Black Crystal Pearl, Bright Silver Metallic, Stone White, and in multiple \"heritage\" colors: Toxic Orange, HEMI-Orange, TorRed, B5 Blue, Plum Crazy Purple, Detonator Yellow, and Furious Fuchsia. Production started in February 2009.\nThe 2009 SRT8, while still equipped with the 6.1 L (370 cu in) Hemi V8, was virtually identical to its 2008 counterpart, with the main difference being the choice of either a 5-speed automatic or 6-speed manual transmission. Standard features include Brembo brakes, a sport suspension, bi-xenon headlamps, heated leather sport seats, keyless go, Sirius satellite radio, and 20-inch (510 mm) forged aluminum wheels in addition to most amenities offered on the R/T and SE models such as air conditioning and cruise control. In addition, the 2009 had a \"limited slip\" differential that was not offered on the 2008 model. A \"Spring Special\" SRT8 Challenger was also offered in B5 Blue, but due to rolling plant shutdowns, approximately 250 Spring Special Challengers were built before the end of the 2009 model year.\nThe Mopar '10 Challenger R/T is a limited version of the 2010 Challenger R/T with metallic pearl black body color, three accent colors (blue, red, silver) of stripes to choose from. In addition, these cars were available with black R/T Classic-style wheels along with a Hurst aftermarket pistol grip shifter, custom badging, Mopar cold air intake for a ten-horsepower increase, and a Katzkin-sourced aftermarket interior. The cars were built in Brampton Assembly and completed at the Mopar Upfit Center in Windsor, Ontario. There were 500 U.S. units and 100 Canadian units built. Of the 500 Mopar special edition U.S. versions, 320 had automatic transmissions, 180 had manuals, while 255 had blue stripes, 115 had red stripes, and 130 had silver stripes. A limited numbered run of 400 SRTs in 2010 were produced with \"Furious Fuchsia\" paint and white leather seats with horizontal fuchsia-colored slash bars on the backrests. Special badging on the passenger side dash script denotes the production number of each individual car ranging from the numbers 1 to 400. Dodge marketed this package as an homage to the original Panther Pink cars 40 years previous. These cars came with both automatic and Tremec six-speed transmissions.\nThe Drag Race Package is a race model designed for NHRA competition, based on the Dodge Challenger SRT-8. The car is 1,000 lb (454 kg) lighter than the street vehicle by eliminating major production components and systems. To accentuate the weight savings, they also feature added composite, polycarbonate, and lightweight components designed for drag racing that is part of the new Package Car program. The engine was repositioned to improve the driveline angle and weight distribution. The 116-inch (2,900 mm) wheelbase was shortened by ½ inch. The car also features a front cradle with bolt-in crossmember and solid engine mounts.\nAt least 50 Challenger Drag Race Package Cars were built to meet NHRA requirements. Engine options include a 6.1 L Hemi, 5.7  Hemi, and a 5.9 L Magnum Wedge. Manual or automatic transmissions are available, and the rear axle is solid (not IRS). An initial run of the required 50 cars was completed and over 100 of the \"2009 Challenger Drag Pak\" vehicles were produced. \"Big Daddy\" Don Garlits bought the first drag race package car and raced it in NHRA competition. The prototype cars shown at SEMA were built by MPR Racing of Michigan, who continue to modify the production cars as delivered from Chrysler.\n\n\n=== 2010 model year ===\nIn its second year of production, the Challenger received only a few minor feature and option changes. Electronic stability control is newly standard across the entire Challenger model line. R/T models gained the following standard features: automatic headlamps, an LED-lit cupholder, and door-handle lights. UConnect Multimedia and UConnect Navigation options now include steering-wheel audio controls while UConnect Multimedia features have been combined with the optional Sound Group.\nThe most significant new option for 2010 is the Super Track Pack, which brings a host of track-ready hardware and upgrades that includes:\n\n20x9 wheels with Goodyear F1 Super Car tires\nFront and rear Sachs Nivomat self-leveling shock-absorbers\nLarger rear stabilizer bar (20mm > 16mm stock)\nVariable displacement performance steering pump (standard on 6 speed)\n3.06 rear-axle ratio (n/a on 6-speed R/Ts which maintain 3.92 ratio)\nAnti-lock 4-Wheel disc heavy-duty brakes with performance brake linings\n\"ESP-off\" stability calibration. A limited-slip differential remained standard only on R/Ts equipped with the 6-speed manual transmission.\n\n\n=== 2011 model year ===\n\nThe Ram emblem disappeared with the 2011 model year (as the namesake truck was being spun off as its own brand), and Challengers received two new engines, the Pentastar, and a 392 Hemi.\n\nThe SE and SE Rallye received the new 3.6-liter Pentastar V6 engine rated at 305 hp (227 kW; 309 PS) and 268 lb⋅ft (363 N⋅m; 37 kg⋅m), dual rear exhaust with bright tips, a five-speed automatic transmission with AutoStick, 18-inch aluminum wheels, advanced brake systems including: four-wheel disc antilock brakes, brake assist, ready alert braking and rain brake support, electronic stability control (ESC), with hill start assist and all-speed traction control, a chrome fuel filler door, Uconnect 130 System with AM/FM radio, CD player, six speakers and auxiliary input jack, steering wheel-mounted audio and speed control, twin hood scoops, touring suspension, remote keyless entry, six airbags, active front head restraints, premium cloth seating, six-way power driver seat with four-way power lumbar adjust, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, air conditioning with automatic temperature control, keyless enter and go with proximity sensor and push button start, power windows, locks and mirrors along with a tilt/telescoping steering column and 60/40 folding rear seats that include a rear armrest with cup holders.\nIn 2011, the Challenger Rallye Package added dual red out-lined center stripes, premium leather interior with heated front seats, body-color rear spoiler, performance-tuned steering with sport suspension and handling package, further upgraded brakes, and unique Foose designed 18-inch Rallye wheels.\nThe R/T received revisions including a new bottom grille cutout and an updated suspension.\nThe new SRT8's chin spoiler was enlarged to create more downforce. It resembles the 1970 Challenger R/T. The SRT8 received a new 6.4-liter Hemi V8. The 392 was officially rated at 470 hp (350 kW; 477 PS) and 470 lb⋅ft (637 N⋅m; 65 kg⋅m) of torque. Dodge engineers stated they sacrificed peak horsepower ratings for low-end torque, stating a 90 lb⋅ft (122 N⋅m; 12 kg⋅m) increase over the outgoing 6.1-L (370 c.i.d.) Hemi V8 at 2,900 rpm. Two transmissions were offered: a 5-Speed Shiftable Automatic and a 6-speed manual. With the revised 6.4-liter engine, Chrysler engineers cited a quarter mile (~400 m) time of 12.4 seconds at 110 mph (177 km/h) – bettering the outgoing 6.1 L Hemi by 0.8 seconds, although that figure has varied wildly between automotive magazines. Car and Driver tested the 392 at 12.9 seconds at 114 mph (183 km/h) while Motor Trend tested it at 13.0 seconds at 111.3 mph (179.1 km/h) and Edmunds' number was far closer to Chrysler's claimed numbers at 12.6 seconds at 112.1 mph (180.4 km/h).\nTop speeds of the 2011 Dodge Challenger R/T and 2011 Dodge Challenger SRT8 were both rated at 170 mph (274 km/h). The R/T has a 0–60 mph (0–97 km/h) acceleration time of 5.00 seconds, while the SRT8 accelerates to 60 mph (97 km/h) in 4.50 seconds.\n\n\n=== 2012 model year ===\nThe base SE trim was renamed to SXT for consistency with the naming scheme of the remaining Dodge lineup. The SRT8 392 model gains a two-mode adaptive suspension system that features an Auto and Sport mode. The car uses a variety of sensors to measure inputs like vehicle speed, steering angle, brake torque, throttle position, and acceleration forces to instantly tune the suspension for the given condition depending on what mode is chosen. In addition, a new heated steering wheel featuring Chrysler's new paddle shifter system, new sport seats, and a 900 watt Harman Kardon audio system became available.\n\n\n=== 2013 model year ===\n\nFor 2013, a Rallye Redline package is available with Dodge Challenger V6 models. Based on the SXT Plus trim, the Rallye Redline package includes unique exterior accents, Black chrome 20-inch wheels with Redline Red accents, performance suspension and brakes, a 3.06 rear-axle ratio, and available Radar Red Nappa leather interior.\nThe Electronic Vehicle Tracking System (EVTS), a GPS-enabled stolen vehicle recovery system became available.\n\n\n=== 2014 model year ===\nThe Challenger largely soldiered on with minimal changes for 2014. A new performance package called the \"Super Sport Group\" was made available for V6 Challengers and included the performance-suspension, steering, and brakes from the R/T Challengers, a 3.07:1 axle ratio with 215mm rear axle for faster acceleration, rear spoiler, and 20-inch chrome wheels with wider P245/45R20 all-season performance tires. The \"Sinister Super Sport pack\" was a Super Sport Group but with black wheels instead of chrome. The Challenger SRT8 also gained a launch control system.\n\n\n==== Dodge Challenger 100th Anniversary Edition ====\nThe 100th Anniversary Edition is a version of 2014 Dodge Challenger SXT Plus with a Pentastar V6 engine or R/T Plus with a Hemi V8 engine, commemorating the 100th anniversary of brothers Horace Elgin Dodge and John Francis Dodge introducing the Dodge Model 30, with choice of 8 body colors (Pitch Black, Bright White, Billet Silver, Granite Crystal, Ivory Tri-Coat, Phantom Black Tri-Coat, Header Orange and an exclusive High Octane Red pearl), 20x8-inch polished five-spoke aluminum wheels with Granite Crystal pockets, \"Dodge Est. 1914\" bar-style front-fender badges, Dodge \"100\" logo on the center caps, a body-color rear spoiler, a red \"R/T\" heritage grille badge on R/T Plus model, sport seats with all-new Molten Red or Foundry Black Nappa leather upholstery, a custom cloud overprint at sport seats, center console armrest and door armrests; a unique three-spoke flat-bottom performance steering wheel with die-cast paddle shifters, brass-colored accent stitching on leather-wrapped surfaces, Dark Brushed Graphite center console bezels, Liquid Graphite steering-wheel accents, die-cast \"Dodge Est. 1914\" circular badges on front seatbacks, an embroidered anniversary logo on floor mats, all-new instrument panel cluster graphics (unique black-face gauges with white indication, stand-out red \"100\" mph indication), Electronic Vehicle Information Center and Uconnect touchscreen Radio with unique startup image, sport mode calibration, a performance-tuned suspension, 2 unique key fobs with 100th Anniversary Edition jeweled logo on the backside, a customized owner's kit, a special commemorative book celebrating the 100 years of Dodge heritage.\nThe 100th Anniversary Edition was unveiled in the 2013 LA Auto Show. The car was set to appear in Dodge showrooms during the first quarter of 2014. The Canadian model was set to appear in Dodge showrooms during the first quarter of 2014.\n\n\n=== 2015 model year (facelift) ===\n\nFor the 2015 model year, changes include:\n\nThe high-performance \"SRT-8\" trim was retired, replaced by SRT 392 and SRT Hellcat.\n5-speed automatic transmission replaced by a new 8-speed ZF 8HP automatic transmission\nPower output on the 6.4 liter Apache V8 increased by 15 hp (11 kW; 15 PS) and 5 lb⋅ft (7 N⋅m; 1 kg⋅m) for a total of 485 hp (362 kW; 492 PS) and 475 lb⋅ft (644 N⋅m; 66 kg⋅m)\nA slightly revamped exterior features a new grille with design cues from the 1971 Challenger, Quad LED 'Halo Ring\" headlights, LED taillights, and functional hood intakes on all models.\nInside, the Challenger gets a 7-inch (180 mm) TFT (thin film transistor) display with over one hundred possible configurations, 8.4-inch Uconnect touchscreen radio with available navigation, and a retro-styled gauge cluster.\nSix-Piston front Brembo brakes with Two-Piece 15.4-inch vented/slotted Rotors and 4-piston rear Brembo brakes on SRT 392 and SRT Hellcat models.\n\n\n==== SRT Hellcat ====\n\nThe Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat is a high performance variant of the Challenger equipped with a supercharged 6.2-liter Hemi engine rated at 707 hp (527 kW) and 650 lb⋅ft (881 N⋅m; 90 kg⋅m) of torque. This engine is also available in the Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat full-sized sedan, the Jeep Grand Cherokee Trackhawk SUV, and as the Hellcrate engine swap kit. The inner driving light on the left front has been removed to allow air to get into the engine resulting in more torque, and the wheel wells are different from the standard SRT to accommodate the 20-inch aluminum wheels. \nThe SRT Hellcat is equipped with two separate key fobs; use of the \"black\" fob limits engine output to 500 hp (373 kW), while the \"red\" fob enables full output capability. The Hellcat has a quarter-mile time of 11.2 seconds; this was accomplished with street legal drag tires. On stock tires the Hellcat was able to achieve 11.6 seconds at 125 mph (201 km/h) on the quarter-mile.\nThe Challenger SRT Hellcat can accelerate from 0–60 mph (0–97 km/h) in 3.6 seconds and can brake from 60–0 mph (97–0 km/h) in 109 ft (36 yd; 33 m). Top speed is 199 mph (320 km/h). The Challenger Hellcat has a lateral acceleration of 0.94 g.\nThe European-spec Hellcat is capable of accelerating from 0–62 mph (0–100 km/h) in 3.9 seconds, 0–124 mph (0–200 km/h) in 10.7 seconds, and 0–186 mph (0–299 km/h) in 38 seconds (although the speedometer appeared to be inaccurate by 10–15 km/h (6–9 mph)).\nThe Challenger Hellcat was able to complete its Gingerman Raceway lap in 1:45.8, the Hockenheim Short in 1:14.6  and the Motown Mile in 0:56.37.\n\n\n=== 2016 model year ===\n\nFor the 2016 model year, the Challenger received new Go Mango orange and Plum Crazy purple paint colors as well as the Blacktop appearance package.\n\n\n=== 2017 model year ===\n \nFor the 2017 model year, a GT model was introduced with an all-wheel drive (AWD) version of the SXT Plus, making the Challenger the only two-door muscle car with available AWD. The Challenger GT uses the same AWD system and suspension as the Dodge Charger Pursuit. It is available exclusively with the 3.6-liter V6 Pentastar engine and the 8-speed automatic transmission.\nThe AWD system includes both an active transfer case and front-axle disconnect system. The system defaults to rear-wheel drive (RWD) but can seamlessly transition between RWD and AWD if certain conditions are met, like low external temperature, rainfall, or loss of traction. No driver input is required. In Sport Mode, the car uses AWD exclusively. The AWD system in the Challenger GT is configured to be rear-biased (applies more power to the rear wheels). Only up to 38% of power is transferred to the front wheels.\nOther model additions include the 5.7-liter V8 equipped T/A and 6.4-liter V8 equipped T/A 392 models. T/A models include a black painted hood with center air intake, black roof, black decklid, bodyside graphics, a cold-air induction system through the front headlamps similar to that used in the Challenger SRT Hellcat, Houndstooth cloth performance seats, and white-faced gauges. T/A 392 models include everything on T/A models in addition to the more powerful 6.4 L V8, six-piston front Brembo brakes with two-piece 15.4-inch vented/slotted rotors and 4-piston rear Brembo brakes, and 20x9.5-inch wheels with 275/40ZR20 tires. Every Challenger gains an updated Uconnect infotainment system; the optional 8.4-inch touchscreen with navigation adds multitouch gestures.\nModels equipped with the 5.7-liter V8 now have an electronically controlled low-restriction active exhaust for a more aggressive exhaust note. Among the other additions are standard Houndstooth cloth seats on some models and revised paint choices. Green Go, Yellow Jacket, Destroyer Grey, and Octane Red are new colors, while White Knuckle and Contusion Blue are renamed carryovers.\n\n\n=== 2018 model year ===\nMinor changes were made for the 2018 model year. For SXT and R/T models equipped with the 3.6-liter V6 and 5.7-liter V8, a new Performance Handling Group package is available. This package adds 4-piston black Brembo brakes (a $500 option for red brake calipers is optional) in the front along with a Bilstein performance suspension, 20x9 inch wheels with 245/45ZR20 performance tires, and upgraded steering. The Challenger GT gains a new 19-inch wheel option while SXT Plus and R/T Plus trims equipped with the Super Track package come with Nappa leather and microsuede sport seats. The SXT, R/T, R/T Shaker, and T/A models receive a standard 7.0-inch Uconnect touchscreen. A backup camera is now standard. For exterior colors, new additions include F8 Green, IndiGO Blue, B5 Blue and Plum Crazy.\n\n\n==== SRT Demon ====\n\nThe Demon is a limited production wide-body and extreme (drag race level) performance variant of the already high-performance Challenger SRT Hellcat. It debuted during the New York Auto Show in April 2017.\nThe Demon uses an all-new 6.2-liter V8 engine equipped with a 2.7-liter supercharger, which is rated at 808 hp (603 kW; 819 PS) with 91 octane gasoline and 840 hp (626 kW; 852 PS) with 100 octane fuel or higher (both outputs are with the red key fob supplied with the car). Torque stands at 770 lb⋅ft (1,044 N⋅m; 106 kg⋅m) on 100 octane fuel. The car weighs 215 lb (98 kg) less than the Hellcat, the total being 4,254 lb (1,930 kg). The SRT Demon uses a set of road tires by Nitto Tire, called the NT05R. The tires are the 315/40R18 variations at both front and rear. The tires are targeted for the drag strip, but have enough tread pattern to make them legal for the road. This tire, although an NT05R consumer tire, is a variation built specifically to withstand the power output of the Demon. This makes the Challenger SRT Demon the first production car to contain a set of drag radial road tires. The SRT Demon contains a system that is used specifically for drag racing called transbrake. Dodge uses a unique transbrake that puts the transmission in 1st gear and 2nd gear  simultaneously, holding the Demon stationary. This is used along with the car's torque converter to build up hydraulic pressure before launch.\nThe power-to-weight ratio of the SRT Demon is 418 hp (312 kW; 424 PS) per ton on 91 octane gasoline and 435 hp (324 kW; 441 PS) per ton on 100 octane or higher.\nThe SRT Demon accelerates from 0–30 mph (0–48 km/h) in 1.0 second, 0–60 mph (0–97 km/h) in 2.3 seconds (2.0s with a rollout), 0–100 mph (0–161 km/h) in 5.1 seconds, a top speed of 168 mph (270 km/h) (factory limited), and the quarter mile (400 m (1,300 ft; 440 yd)) in only 9.65 seconds at 140.09 mph (225.45 km/h). This makes the Demon the fastest non-electric production car to reach 0-60 mph (0–97 km/h) and to complete a straight-line quarter mile at its time of announcement. The SRT Demon is also capable of accelerating at 1.8 G's of force at launch. The boost pressure of the supercharger can be increased to 14.5 psi (100 kPa; 1.00 bar) and redline up to 6,500 rpm. With this extreme power, and hard acceleration, the SRT Demon is the first production car to perform a wheelie. With the control module from the \"Demon Crate\" and high-speed tires, the Demon has attained a top speed of over 200 mph (320 km/h) in test runs.\nBecause of the lack of an NHRA certified roll cage, which is required if the quarter-mile time is under 10 seconds, the NHRA banned the SRT Demon from competition.\nLike the SRT Hellcat, it comes with both red and black key fobs, with the black fob limiting the power output to 500 hp (373 kW). With the red key and the use of 100+ octane gasoline, the Demon can utilize its full power potential. Only 3,300 cars were made, with production beginning in the summer of 2017 and market introduction happening in the fall of 2017.\nThe interior of the SRT Demon is the same as all other Challenger trims, but with changes that differentiate it to the other trims. The Demon only includes a front driver's seat as standard, and no other seats front or rear in the vehicle. However, the front passenger's seat, as well as a rear bench seat, can both be added back as options for one dollar each. To replace the rear seats, Dodge included rear roll bars, and has a 4-point harness installed on it for the driver seat. The dashboard display and the seats now have the Demon logo on them, and includes a performance display on it, as well as on the center console touch screen.\nDodge engineers reduced the curb weight of the 2018 Challenger SRT Demon to 4,237 lb (1,922 kg) versus the 4,469 lb (2,027 kg) curb weight of the SRT Hellcat, a difference of 105 kg (231 lb).\n Weight reduction was achieved by removing the front passenger seat (it could be added back), rear seat, speakers, trunk trim, parking sensors, and insulators, among other items.  The SRT Demon also uses lightweight aluminum alloy wheels, pistons, calipers, and brake rotors.\nThe SRT Demon was chosen as one of the Top 10 Tech Cars by the IEEE in 2018.\n\n\n===== Specifications =====\nSpecifications of the Challenger SRT Demon are as follows:\n\n6.2-liter supercharged Hemi V8 engine, includes 2.7-liter supercharger (840 hp (626 kW; 852 PS) and 770 lb⋅ft (1,044 N⋅m; 106 kg⋅m) using 100 octane racing fuel or higher, or 808 hp (603 kW; 819 PS) and 717 lb⋅ft (972 N⋅m; 99 kg⋅m) using 91 octane premium fuel\n8-speed ZF 8HP automatic transmission as standard, with steering wheel mounted shift paddles\nRuns on 91 octane premium fuel or 100 octane racing fuel\n1.8 g (17.7 m·s−2) of longitudinal g-force at launch\nTotal curb weight of 1,930 kg (4,255 lb) (98 kg (215 lb) less than SRT Hellcat)\nAir conditioning\nUconnect 8.4 in (21 cm) touchscreen audio system (with SRT performance pages)\nFront and rear fender flares (adds 3.5 in (9 cm) to overall width of car)\nAlcantara-wrapped steering wheel (with shift paddles mounted on it)\nStitched or embossed Demon emblems on front seatbacks\n200 mph (322 km/h) speedometer (with Demon-themed TFT reconfigurable instrument cluster)\nFactory-installed transbrake System\n18 in (46 cm) street-legal, Drag Radial Tires\nFactory-installed SRT \"Power-Chiller\" (a system that uses the vehicle's air conditioning to pre-cool the intercooler before the run and thus further compress air from the supercharger)\nFront passenger and rear bench seat delete with rear roll bar (items can be re-added for a dollar each)\nFunctional hood scoop (largest hood scoop in any production car)\n2-Speaker Audio System (Harman Kardon audio system is optional)\nThe last SRT Demon rolled off the assembly line in Brampton, Ontario, Canada on May 31, 2018. It was sold at a Barrett-Jackson auction in June 2018 alongside the final Dodge Viper.\n\n\n=== 2019 model year ===\nFor the 2019 model year, Dodge released new high-performance versions of the Challenger, trimmed the line-up down to six models, and made numerous other tweaks and changes. The model line-up for 2019 includes the following trims: SXT, GT, R/T, R/T Scat Pack, SRT Hellcat, and SRT Hellcat Redeye. Both SXT and GT models are now available in both rear and all-wheel drive, with the GT previously having been the only model available in AWD. GTs gain a more aggressive look with a performance hood, front splitter, steering and suspension while maintaining the optional performance handling group which includes wider wheels, performance summer tires, 4-piston Brembo brakes, and fixed-rate Bilstein suspension. The SXT model loses the performance handling group as an option, lacks the more aggressive exterior upgrades of the GT and has less aggressive gearing, making it the cheaper economical alternative. R/T Scat Pack models come with a new power-bulge aluminum hood standard. Shared with the SRT Hellcat, this hood features dual air extractors that cool the engine and help reduce lift. For 5.7L and 6.4L V8 R/T models, the rear seats can be deleted at the cost of $1 and have a net weight savings of 55 lbs. In addition, a second level of the performance handling group called the \"performance plus package\" is offered, providing 20-inch x 9.5-inch low-gloss black forged wheels, 275/40ZR20 Pirelli P Zero summer tires, and a limited-slip differential in addition to the upgrades found in the performance handling group which remains unchanged since its introduction in 2018.\nSRT Hellcat: A slight increase in power is present for 2019, with horsepower rising to 717 horsepower (535 kW; 727 PS) and torque to 656 lb⋅ft (889 N⋅m; 91 kg⋅m). A new dual-snorkel hood is introduced. Additionally, the 2019 model's starting price is more than $5,500 lower compared to the 2018 model. A 6-speed Tremec manual and ZF 8-speed automatic remain the sole transmission options.\n\nSRT Hellcat Redeye: Following the discontinuation of the Demon, the Redeye was developed to fill the void. Essentially a heavily upgraded Hellcat, the Redeye is equipped with a slightly less powerful (due to a smaller hood intake system) Demon engine: a supercharged 6.2L V8 rated at 797 hp (594 kW; 808 PS) and 707 lb⋅ft (959 N⋅m; 98 kg⋅m) of torque, an increase of 90 hp (67 kW; 91 PS) and 11 lb⋅ft (15 N⋅m; 2 kg⋅m) over the standard Hellcat engine. Other upgrades include reinforced ZF 8 speed automatic transmission, track-tuned suspension, torque Reserve and 41-spline heavy-duty half-shafts, SRT power chiller, and after-run chiller.\nScat Pack 1320 Package: Equipped with the 6.4L Chrysler Hemi Engine rated at 485 hp (362 kW; 492 PS) and 475 lb⋅ft (644 N⋅m; 66 kg⋅m), the Scat Pack 1320 adds 20-Inch x 9.5-Inch Low Gloss Black Drag Wheels, 275/40R20 102W drag radial tires, adaptive damping suspension, SRT-tuned drag suspension, air catcher headlamps, optional deletion of front and rear passenger seats, a special speed limited engine controller, extreme-duty 41-spline half shafts and a trans-brake. Specially developed Nexen 275/40R20l street-legal drag radial tires are available for better grip.\nThe Dodge Challenger R/T Scat Pack 1320 can be modified for NHRA competition in accordance with Stock and Super Stock class rules. It will feature a class weight break of 8.72 and carry a minimum weight of 3,400 pounds. Contestants intending to compete at an NHRA event must meet all regulations for the category entered.\nWidebody Package: For the 2019 model year, buyers can order the Challenger Scat Pack, SRT Hellcat, and SRT Hellcat Redeye with the \"Widebody Package\". When purchased, the Challenger gains the following:\n\nWidebody fender flares\n20x11 Devils Rim forged aluminum wheels\n305/35ZR20 Pirelli 3-season performance (P Zero Nero all-season) tires\n3-mode Bilstein adaptive damping suspension uniquely tuned for competition use\n6-piston calipers with 15.4 inch vented and slotted rotors in the front (standard on Hellcat and Hellcat Redeye models)\nStiffened anti-roll bars sized 34mm in front and 22mm rear (standard on Hellcat and Hellcat Redeye models)\n\n\n=== 2020 model year ===\n\nFor the 2020 model year, Dodge introduced a SRT Super Stock model slotting in between the Hellcat Redeye and the Demon. The engine is the same as the Redeye, but is slightly more powerful at 807 hp (602 kW; 818 PS). This is enabled by a revision of the powertrain calibration, which increases the redline from 6300 to 6400 rpm. Additionally, the Super Stock gains lightweight 18-inch wheels with the same drag radials as the Demon, along with a shorter final-drive ratio and drag-optimized suspension tuning for the Bilstein adaptive dampers in Track Mode. However, it uses four-piston Brembo and 14.2-inch rotors instead of the Redeye's six-piston Brembo and 15.4-inch rotors. A 50th Anniversary Package was also announced for GT RWD, R/T Shaker, R/T Scat Pack, and R/T Scat Pack Shaker Widebody models, as well as the SRT Hellcat and SRT Hellcat Redeye. The package includes a body paint matched Shaker hood scoop, 20-inch wheels in Gold School colour and matching 6-piston Brembo brake calipers on wide body models, and a special grille badge, with Nappa leather and Alcantara upholstery featuring gold sepia stitching, a serialized number 1/70 (one of seventy made) plaque, and carbon-fiber trim inside. Each model was limited to 70 units; colors include Frostbite, Hellraisin, Sinamon Stick, TorRed, F8 Green, Go Mango, and an exclusive Gold Rush.\n\n\n=== 2021 model year ===\n\nFor the 2021 model year, Dodge added Gold Rush on the T/A, T/A 392, SRT Hellcat, and SRT Hellcat Redeye models. R/T Scat Pack Shaker and T/A 392 models gain a wide-body option, while 20-inch wheels and tires are now standard on the GT AWD model. The Hellcat model is only available in the ZF 8-speed automatic, as the 6-speed Tremec manual has been removed as an option for the Hellcat pending revised calibrations by Dodge. The Manual transmission will continue to be available for the R/T, and R/T Scat Pack.\n\n\n=== 2023 model year ===\nFor its final model year, Dodge returned the 6-speed Tremec manual transmission to the Hellcat for the last time, making it the standard gearbox.\nSRT Demon 170\nUnveiled on March 20, 2023, the Dodge Challenger SRT Demon 170 produces 1,025 hp (764 kW; 1,039 PS) and 945 lb⋅ft (1,281 N⋅m; 131 kg⋅m), and has the highest launch force of any production car, with G-forces at 2.004 G's. With prices starting at $96,666 / £79,000 before the destination tax. Dodge plans to build 3,000 units for the US market and 300 for Canada, with orders opening on March 27. As of 2023, it is the fastest accelerating production car in the world, with a claimed 0-60mph of 1.66 seconds. It covers a quarter mile in 8.91 seconds, receiving a ban from the NHRA for setting a sub-nine second quarter mile without a roll cage or parachute. A Pitch-Black painted Demon 170 became the final Challenger ever produced on December 22, 2023.\n\n\n=== Limited production 3rd party variants ===\nIn addition to official Dodge concept cars, there have been numerous limited production and street legal variants created by third parties, based on stock cars that have been rebuilt with modified powertrains, suspensions, and interiors. These include the SMS 570 and (supercharged) 570X with up to a claimed 700 hp (522 kW), the Mr. Norm's Challengers with a claimed 637 or 900 hp (475 or 671 kW; 646 or 912 PS) horsepower, the supercharged SpeedFactory SF600R with around 600 hp (447 kW; 608 PS), the supercharged Richard Petty Signature Series with a claimed 610 bhp (455 kW; 618 PS), and the Legacy by Petty Convertible Challenger completely customized by Petty's Garage to include a one of a kind front end and NASCAR styled treatments. Some Challengers have been imported into Australia and converted to right-hand-drive.\n\n\n=== Dodge Challenger Convertible ===\nStarting August 16, 2022, the Challenger Convertible can be ordered at official Dodge dealers. Customers will then work with Drop Top Customs, the conversion firm, and the Dodge dealer to create their vehicle. The convertible option is open for 2022 Challenger R/T, R/T Scat Pack and all Challenger SRT models.\n\n\n=== Safety ===\n\n\n=== Sales ===\n\n\n== Racing ==\n\nBlackforest Motorsports has currently entered a Challenger in the Continental Challenge.\nThe Challenger R/T has been used as the Chrysler model for starting in 2010 NASCAR Nationwide Series competition.\nWith Dodge officially out of NASCAR at the end of the 2012 season, the remaining cars and racing parts have been bought up by \"privateer\" racing teams and continue to show up in Nationwide Series during the 2013 and 2014 seasons. J. J. Yeley indicated his two-car team would continue to field a Challenger in the series for as long as he can find parts to keep the cars running. The team stopped after the 2014 season after his No. 93 (later No. 28) regularly ran in the top-20 during races, though the Mike Harmon-owned No. 74 and the Derek White-operated No. 40 qualified and ran Dodges in 2015. Mike Harmon Racing ran a Dodge the entire season and also did so in 2016, and has raced in over half of the 2017 season so far. Likewise, White's MBM Motorsports team fielded the Nos. 13 and 40 as Dodges in some races. MBM continues to field Dodges into 2018 with Timmy Hill in the 66 (was the 13).\nIn late 2014 two Challengers fielded by Miller Racing with the support of SRT and Mopar driven by Cameron Lawrence and Joe Stevens started racing in the Trans-Am Series's TA2 class. Both cars used a spec Howe road racing tube chassis with fiberglass bodies. Powered by a Hemi 392 slightly modified for road racing extremes and restricted by class rules, the cars made around 500 horsepower. Except for slightly bulged fenders and large rear wing, the cars look very much like the stock/street version, despite being roughly 7/8s the size of the road car. Lawrence won four of 12 races in the 2015 season, finishing third overall in the Trans Am TA2 championship. \nJoe Stevens in the No. 11 \"Green Car\" finished sixth overall after a fourth place at the season finale at Daytona International Speedway. Joe Stevens also received the Cool Shirt Hard Charger award for his excellent rookie season performance. For the 2016 season, the Stevens-Miller Team fielded three Challengers in the TA2 series and ran in 16 events, scoring a few wins. The No. 77 car was painted in a throw-back paint scheme very similar to the 1970 No. 77 car driven by Sam Posey. The No. 12 car occasionally fielded a blue scheme paying tribute to the Plymouth Cuda Trans-Am car driven by Swede Savage.\nIn March 2017 the Challenger returned to the TA class in Trans-Am at Sebring after a nearly 40-year absence from Trans-Am's fastest class of racing. It was driven by Jeff Hinkle under the American V8 Road Racing team with John Debenedictis as crew chief. The car was orange and purple with stripes of many of the other challenger colors to celebrate the current stable of cars for the street. It is powered by a Penske Engines Mopar R5 / P7 carbureted engine producing 855 hp (638 kW). In its debut, it qualified 16th and finished 9th out of a field of 24.\nAt all Superbike World Championship races held in the United States, Fiat's Alfa Romeo safety car is replaced with Chrysler's Dodge Challenger.\n\n\n== Discontinuation and future plans ==\nOn August 15, 2022, Stellantis formally announced that Dodge Challenger, Charger, and Chrysler 300 production would end following the 2023 model year, stating tightening U.S. EPA emissions requirements as reasons for doing so. In response, the company announced a series of \"Last-Call\" models with special paint and unique trims in order to commemorate the Challenger and Charger. The final Dodge Challenger, a Pitch-Black Demon 170, rolled off the Brampton assembly line on December 22, 2023; it was also the very last vehicle built on a derivative of the long-running Chrysler LX Platform, which was introduced in 2004 for the 2005 model year. Following the end of production, the Brampton, Ontario assembly plant will be re-tooled to assemble electric vehicles as well as the next-generation Jeep Compass.\nWhile it is currently unknown whether the Challenger name will return on a future vehicle, Stellantis announced that an electrified successor to both the Charger and Challenger would be introduced in 2024 for the 2025 model year in the form of a three-door liftback, utilizing the Charger name. Moreover, the company announced that the all-new electric power plants will produce 455 horsepower on the base model and over 800 horsepower using the Banshee 800-volt power plant. An internal combustion version is rumored to be offered as well, utilizing the twin-turbocharged 3.0L Hurricane inline-6 engine, shared with the Jeep Wagoneer/Grand Wagoneer and 2025 Ram 1500; it is set to be paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission.\n\n\n== Explanatory notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website \nDodge Challenger (2008) at Curlie\nDodge Challenger: History of the Dodge Pony Car",

In an age where women are expected to be high-achievers, Sophie desperately wants to be a good widow - a graceful, composed Jackie Kennedy kind of widow. Alas, Sophie is more of a Jack Daniels kind. Guzzling cartons of ice-cream for breakfast, breaking down in the frozen food aisle of her local supermarket, showing up to work in her bathrobe and bunny slippers - soon she's not only lost her husband, but her job and her waistline. With nowhere to go but up, Sophie leaves California for Oregon and after several false starts opens her own fabulous bakery. Soon Sophie finds herself trying to cope with the demands of her eccentric mother-in-law and Crystal, a teenager with even less of a grip on life than Sophie. Juggling the success of the bakery, her friends and her new life, Sophie proves that with enough humour and chutzpah it is possible to have life after loss.\n\n\n== Commercial and critical reception ==\nIn her New York Times review, Janet Maslin wrote that Holly Winston treats matters of life and death with incongruous lightness and insistent lovability, capably rendered and extremely reader-friendly.\nThe novel was on the New York Times best sellers lists for more than 15 weeks.\n\n\n== External links ==\nPublisher's Website\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "In psychology and cognitive science, perceptual vigilance refers to a heightened state of awareness and attentiveness towards specific stimuli or information. This phenomenon involves individuals becoming more attuned to detecting and processing relevant sensory input or cues from their environment. Perceptual vigilance is influenced by various factors such as personal interests, goals, or expectations.\nThis heightened perceptual sensitivity plays a crucial role in cognitive processes such as attention, perception, and memory. It involves selectively focusing attention on certain stimuli while filtering out irrelevant or less salient information. This selective attention allows individuals to prioritize and respond effectively to important or meaningful stimuli in their surroundings.\nResearchers in psychology and cognitive science study perceptual vigilance to understand how attentional mechanisms operate and how they can be influenced by internal and external factors. By investigating the cognitive processes underlying perceptual vigilance, researchers gain insights into human perception, behavior, and decision-making.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPerceptual defense\nSelective perception",

The district is primarily residential, and extends south from the city's main commercial area.  The area began to develop in the 1850s, after the railroad was built through the town.  The earliest houses were built by merchants and tradesmen, many in Greek Revival and Vernacular styles.  Development slowed following the Civil War, but picked up in the economic boom of the 1880s, with merchants and professionals building modest houses including many Victorian cottages.  Two churches were also built: First Methodist church in the early 1880s, and St. Thomas Episcopal in 1896.  While development was mostly complete by 1910, infill bungalows continued to be built in the early 20th century.\nThe district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The siege of Mamora was a military operation launched in 1681 by Sultan Moulay Ismail with the aim of taking the place of Mamora, which had been occupied by the Spanish since 1614. The Moroccan forces eventually captured the Spanish fortress.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nOn August 1-2, 1614, a Spanish fleet commanded by Luis Fajardo captured Mamora. He fortified the town and left a good number of garrisons there. He then returned to Cádiz. The Moroccans attempted to recapture the lost city in 1628 and 1647; however, all of their attempts were failures. In 1680, the Moroccan sultan, Ismail Ibn Sharif, was busy with the siege of Tangier, so he dispatched Omar bin Haddou to capture Mamora.\n\n\n== Siege ==\nA large number of Moroccans besieged the city of Mamora and kept the garrison in suspense. Omar's plan was to break the garrison's spirit with a swift attack on their outer defenses and offer the garrison the option of surrender or death. First, Omar established spiked palisades, which stretched from the city walls to the river banks. As soon as night fell, Omar attacked and managed to capture two towers on the shore. Omar knew that the Spanish garrison was low in morale, so he offered the garrison commander, Juan de Peñalosa y Estrada, a promise not to be enslaved. Juan refused and insisted everyone fight, but his soldiers refused to obey, forcing him to accept the offer.\nThe Moroccan commander invited the Sultan to witness the fall of the city. On May 3, the city fell, and the Sultan watched his men capture the city. The Spanish commander was taken prisoner along with 308 men. 88 bronze cannons and 15 iron cannons have been captured, along with a large quantity of ammunition. Juan was forced to kneel and kiss the sultan's feet. The Sultan then entered the citadel of Mamora. The city was renamed Mehdya. The statue of Jesus was looted, and the sultan built a mosque, a madrasa, and an inn.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nErnest Mercier (1891), Histoire de l'Afrique septentrionale (Berbérie) dupuis les temps les plus reculés jusqu'à la conquête française (1830), Vol-III.[1]\nRevue africaine, journal des travaux de la Société Historique Algérienne, Vol-XVII.[2]\nJeremy Black (2022), A Brief History of the Atlantic.[3]\nGiles Milton (2012), White Gold.[4]",

        "content": "No Fags (German: Tunten zwecklos) is a 2021 German documentary film directed by Mirek Balonis and Jutta Riedel about the Hamburg Bollenmädels, a group of homosexual friends. The film premiered on October 23, 2021, at the Hamburg International Queer Film Festival in Hamburg and was shown in selected German cinemas from November 9, 2023. \n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe film follows the Hamburg Bollenmädels group over an extended period of time and portrays its nine members. Animated sequences complement filmic observations and interviews, which deal with their childhood, their (early or late) coming out, their relationship with their parents, their sexuality, experiences in the West German gay scene, the discrimination and stigmatization of homosexuals by society, the violence against them, the emergence of AIDS and the associated propaganda and repression by politics and the media against homosexual people in West Germany. The Bollenmädels also address their role in the German queer community today. One of the protagonists says that, as a gay man, he is \"old hat\" and that the term \"gay\" is \"too one-sided\" for younger LGBTQI people. They would prefer the term \"queer\".\nThe Hamburg Bollenmädels represent many German homosexuals who came out in the West German provinces in the early 1980s and escaped the conservative climate there. One member of the group provocatively poses the question of whether fags can \"represent the gays\" from the perspective of other homosexuals. After all, No Fags, the title of the film, used to appear frequently in the personal ads of German gay print media. The following descriptions by the Bollenmädels suggest that, in addition to the discrimination faced by society as a whole, fags were also rejected by parts of the West German gay scene.\nMost of the current group members of the Bollenmädels met in Hamburg at the end of the 1980s and became friends. They have very different professions. In 1995, the men founded the group as part of Christopher Street Day. In addition to monthly meetings, they like to perform as Schwarzwaldmädel at Hamburg Pride, the Hamburg CSD, but also in various Hamburg clubs and scene meeting places, but also in a variety of self-designed costumes, which always have a visual reference to the original Bollenmädel costume.\nThe Bollenmädels' commitment to an open and free society continues to this day. In 2018, at an official invitation, the group presented Manneken Pis with a self-made dirndl with a Bollenhut. The Bollenmädels' dirndl is the first female costume in the 400-year history of the Brussels landmark Manneken Pis. The dressing up on site spontaneously developed into a multicultural street party. This event also forms the conclusion of the documentary.\n\n\n== Production ==\nFilmmakers Mirek Balonis and Jutta Riedel realized No Fags with their Cologne-based production company Trawa Film. Filming took place in Belgium and Germany from July 2018 to March 2020. They received the money for the production and distribution of the film through a crowdfunding campaign and from the German film funding Film- und Medienstiftung NRW.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe reviews of the film so far have been positive. The German LGBTI online magazine Queer.de, for example, considered No Fags one of the \"most exciting films of 2022\" and Toby Frei from German ka-news praised the two filmmakers' \"sensitive interviews\".\nSome prominent cultural figures also praised the film. Some of their comments are included in the press material for the film.\nGerman director and screenwriter Wieland Speck, for example, gained the following insight from the film: \"I knew nothing about the Bollenmädels and so your film (addressed to the filmmakers) is a beautiful piece of history and contemporary history.\" And he also states: \"I think it's very important to show the subcultural pieces of the puzzle and thus the connections between emancipation, without which there would be no larger movement. The animations also raise the whole thing to a more universal level and the individual stories of the protagonists also provide a picture of the societies of origin, which include the change in family understanding, as the film shows.\"\nThe co-founder of the political gay and lesbian movement in the Federal Republic of Germany and filmmaker Rosa von Praunheim recommended the film for a cinema audience and praised it as an \"excellent and affectionate portrait of the original group of friends and activists 'Bollenmädels' from Hamburg.\"\n\n\n== Accolades (Selection) ==\n2022: Jury Prize in the category Best Documentary at the Romanian Wallachia International Film Festival\n2022: Best first time director documentary award at the French Festival du Cinema de Paris\n2023: Best LGBTQ Award at the Czech Brno Film Festival\n2023: Best Queer Award at the Spanish C L I M A X Festival Internacional de Cinema Independiente\n2023: Award Best feature-length Documentary at the Scottish film festival Close:Up Edinburgh Docufest\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNo Fags at IMDb \nOfficial website (in German)",

        "content": "Taiyin Xingjun (Chinese: 太阴星君) is the Chinese goddess of the moon. While often intertwined with the legend of Chang'e, Taiyin Xingjun is the true guardian of the moon.\n\n\n== Origin and legends ==\nTracing its origins, the emergence of Taiyin Xingjun is related to ancient Chinese worship of the moon. Taiyin Xingjun is also known as the Moonlight Goddess, Taiyin Xingjun, Moon Maiden, and Moonlight Bodhisattva. The worship of Taiyin Xingjun has a long history in China and is also a common phenomenon worldwide, rooted in celestial worship and primitive beliefs.\nDuring the Qing dynasty, Beijing's moon worship underwent some changes. It evolved from the early pure Taoist worship of Chang'e to a blend of Buddhism and Taoism, featuring the secular image of the Moonlight Bodhisattva and the Medicine-Pounding Jade Rabbit. The depictions of the Moon God were mostly inscribed by Taoist temples, titled \"Yuefu Suyao Taiyin Xingjun\" (月府素曜太阴星君, lit. 'the moon palace of Taiyang Xingjun').\nThe earliest recorded worship of the moon in ancient times can be found in the Book of Documents: Canon of Yao, which states: \"The sun, moon, and stars are celestial deities, and Mount Tai, the Yellow River, and the sea are terrestrial deities. The celestial and terrestrial deities together form the six gods.\"\nWhen Wang Yi annotated the Nine Songs: Regretful Chant in the Chu Ci, he said, \"The six gods refer to the gods of the six domains.\" This indicates that the moon had long been worshipped as a god by the people before this period. In fact, when the ancients sacrificed to the moon, they often did so in conjunction with the sun. They would worship the sun in the east and the moon in the west, distinguishing between the internal and external and establishing their respective positions. This phenomenon sufficiently demonstrates the ancient practice of \"worshipping the sun as the main deity and the moon as a supplementary deity.\"\nIn Qing dynasty Taoist Wugou's The Legend of the Eight Immortals, he annotated the origin of Taiyin Xingjun, stating, \"To know the purest essence in the world, it is none other than the moon. The realm within the moon, compared to the legendary Penglai of the seas or the immortal mountains, is particularly serene. No matter how beautiful Chang'e is or how elegant and refined she appears, the truth remains that her physical form is merely mundane, and she is already married, once the consort of a tyrannical Houyi. With such a history, her presence in the Moon Palace could hardly be considered pure. Even though you may not have achieved enlightenment, you surely know that Taiyin Xingjun is the ruler of the Moon Palace. She is the third princess of the Jade Emperor, residing by his side. Who can compare to her nobility? Yet her nature is quite different from others. She is often seen wandering alone in the heavenly palace, indifferent to the elegant company around her, as if she were dwelling among the mundane. She spends her days in quiet contemplation, away from worldly affairs. After much consideration, the Jade Emperor could find no one worthy of her presence, so he appointed her as the ruler of the Moon Palace and bestowed upon her a residence there. Only then could the princess find solace in her solitude. Her lofty and refined demeanor is truly remarkable, far surpassing even Chang'e in elegance. Without the princess, the heavens would lack refinement, and they would be unfit for habitation. The Jade Emperor had no choice but to grant her the title of Taiyin Xingjun and bestow upon her the Moon Palace as her residence. Her austere elegance and her profound nature—who can compare? Chang'e may be graceful, but she is incomparable to the purity and tranquility that surround Taiyin Xingjun. If we were to judge their characters, they are indeed different from ordinary people, possessing a sense of refinement and detachment. Furthermore, Taiyin Xingjun has always had a deep affinity for the moon, often longing to reside in the Moon Palace, her lifelong aspiration unfulfilled until now. In this regard, she shares a common bond with the moon and a kindred spirit with Taiyin Xingjun.\"\nAccording to Taiwanese media reports, Taiyang Xingjun and Taiyin Xingjun are often worshipped as the companion gods of the Jade Emperor.\nIn Taiwanese folk beliefs, people believe that the deity who governs the moon is Taiyin Xingjun. Taiyin Xingjun originated from natural worship in animistic beliefs and originally did not have an image. For example, in the Tiantan Temple, known as the first temple in Taiwan, there is only a wooden plaque inscribed with the words \"Taiyin Xingjun.\" However, with the spread of the myth of Chang'e flying to the moon, the connection between the pure white moon and Chang'e's beautiful and gentle image was formed, leading many to believe that Taiyin Xingjun is the incarnation of Chang'e. Most of the images of Taiyin Xingjun that we see today depict a woman dressed in palace attire, holding the moon high in her hand; she is also known as Taiyin Niangniang.\nAccording to some traditions, although Chang’e is also considered to be an accidental resident of the moon, she is not the moon’s rightful owner. Instead, Taiyin Xingjun, the moon goddess herself, graces the night sky with her luminous presence. Taiyin Xingjun is also known as Jielin, which means \"the immortal who races to the moon.\" \nThe Seven Sage Chronicles states: \"The Yu Hua (red text) dwells with the sun; the Jie Lin (yellow text) dwells with the moon. The Yu Hua is the essence of the sun; the Jie Lin is the essence of the moon.\"\nSometimes, Taiyin Xingjun is also seen as another aspect of the Queen Mother of the West. The Yúnjí Qīqiān states: \"The Xiwangmu is the primordial qi of the Taiyin. Her two breasts are the essence of the myriad gods, the vital fluids of yin and yang. Under her left breast is the sun, and under her right breast is the moon. It is the dwelling place of the King Father and the Queen Mother.\"\nThe Supreme Yellow Court Inner Scenery Jade Scripture states: \"Highly running towards the sun and moon is my supreme path, Yuhua and Jielin are mutually protecting.\"\nThe Commentary of Liangqiu Zi states: \"Yuhua is the immortal who runs towards the sun, while Jielin is the immortal who runs towards the moon.\"\n\nAccording to the poem Two Ghosts (二鬼) by Ming dynasty poet Liu Ji (刘基), the Jade Emperor, taking pity on the uneven distribution of labor and rest, which led to illness and ailments, appointed two ghosts to guard them, named Jielin and Yuhua. Yuhua clutches the foot of a three-legged crow, her feet treading on firewheels coiled with nine dragons. She chews on the five-colored essence of the wood spirit, and her body radiates with five-colored light. In the morning, she sets out from the Valley of the Rising Sun and returns to the branch of the Fusang tree in the evening. Cracking his whip, she drives dragons and rides the sea like a bird, stirring up clouds and boiling waves to cook fish and turtles. Her radiant brilliance illuminates the darkness, and the warm air nourishes the plants and flowers, causing them to grow fragrant and luxuriant. Jielin sits at the roots of the Guanghan Cassia tree, rinsing her mouth with the fragrant dew of cassia. She partakes of the spiritual medicine offered by the White Rabbit, leaping onto the back of the toad. She sketches light and plays with shadows, swirling in the Milky Way, sparkling like jewels and flowers.\"\nTaiyin Xingjun holds a position akin to the Chinese goddess of the moon, similar to Selene in Greek mythology. With the Mid-Autumn Festival's focus on lunar veneration, homage naturally gravitates towards Taiyin Xingjun. On the 15th day of the eighth lunar month, throughout China, people erect incense altars, light crimson candles, offer fresh fruits in four vivid hues, burn incense, and pay homage beneath the gleaming moonlight. This ritual intertwines reverence with leisure, as the moon's radiance bestows a mystical aura, evoking myriad enchanting narratives and profound contemplations. Amidst these tales, \"Chang’e Flies to the Moon\" remains among the most revered.\nIn Journey to the West, when Tang Sanzang passes through India on his journey, a demoness wants to marry him so that she can absorb his yang essence and increase her powers. Sun Wukong sees through her disguise and fights with her. Just as Sun Wukong is about to defeat the demoness, accompanied by the fairy Chang'e, Taiyin Xingjun descends on a colored cloud. The Monkey King hastily puts away his iron rod and bows, saying, \"Old Taiyin, where are you going? I, Sun Wukong, have been avoiding you.\" Taiyin replies, \"The demon you are facing is the Jade Rabbit, who guards the mystical frost elixir in my Guanghan Palace. She secretly unlocked the jade gate and escaped from the palace, and it has been a year since then. I foresee she is currently in grave danger, so I have come to save her. I hope the Great Sage will spare her for my sake.\" Sun Wukong reluctantly agrees, and Taiyin Xingjun takes the Jade Rabbit to the Moon and assigns her duties.\nIn Fengshen Yanyi, when Jiang Ziya was naming gods, Queen Jiang was appointed as Taiyin Xingjun.\n\n\n== Temple ==\nThere are not many temples in Taiwan dedicated to Taiyin Xingjun; the oldest one is the Guan Shengdijun Temple in Daxi, which has a history of over a hundred years and does enshrine her.\n\n\n== References ==",

He played a wide variety of traditional Chinese instruments, including Pipa, Guqin, Erhu, Xiao, and Jinghu. He was nicknamed \"Kreisler of Pipa\", and was a member of the 2nd to the 6th National Committee of the People's Political Consultative Conference.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nWei was born as Yin Bingtao (Chinese: 殷秉涛) in Shanghai County on 21 March 1908. Due to financial difficulty in his biological parents' household, he was adopted by a widow with the surname Wei, and was renamed Wei Chongfu. Starting in 1916, he enrolled in local schools, but dropped out in 1923 as the family could no longer afford tuition. He worked as an apprentice in several shops, and learnt to play xiao and flute in his free time.\nIn 1926, Wei became unemployed when the shop he worked at was closed. Later in the year, he joined Lelin Silk and Bamboo Society (Chinese: 乐林丝竹会) and Postal Union Chinese Orchestra (Chinese: 邮务工会国乐团). Wei joined a traditional Chinese music group called \"Union Music Club\" (Chinese: 大同乐会) in 1928, where he learnt to play Guqin, Pipa, Violin and other instruments. The founder of the Society Zheng Jinwen (Chinese: 郑觐文) personally instructed Wei, and advised him to change his name to Wei Zhongle.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1933, he played the musical pieces Ambush from Ten Sides and The Moon over the River on a Spring Night in a documentary produced by Mingxing Film Company. In 21 May of the same year, he performed Ambush from Ten Sides again on the opening ceremony of the Grand Theatre. In March of the next year, Wei took part in the recording of the album The Drunken Fisherman (Chinese: 醉渔唱晚) by Pathé Records, which is the earliest recording of guqin performance. Following the death of Zheng Jinwen in 1935, Wei took over as the deputy director of Union Music Club. Later the same year, he joined the Chinese Music Research Association (Chinese: 中国音乐研究会) founded by Aaron Avshalomov, Shen Zhibai and Zhang Mei.\nIn July of 1938, Wei was invited by the Hong Kong Women's War Disaster Relief Association (Chinese: 香港妇女救济兵灾会) to participate in charity performances along with Xu Guangyi, Luo Songquan and other musicians. They performed consecutively from August 6 to 7, and all proceeds were used to help the victims of the Second Sino-Japanese War. From 1938 to 1939, Wei traveled to the United States as part of a troupe, during which he performed a variety of instrumental solo and received the nickname \"Kreisler of Pipa\". He enrolled in Curtis Institute of Music to study western music, was invited to performed on NBC as the first traditional Chinese musician to perform on Television, and recorded the album Chinese Classical Music with Musicraft Records.\nAfter returning to China in late February of 1940, Wei became a professor of Chinese music at Hujiang University with recommendation from Shen Zhibai. At this time, the Union Music Club was relocated to Chongqing due to the ongoing war, and Wei established \"Zhongle Music Hall\" on its original site. In 1941, Wei co-founded a Chinese orchestra group along with Jin Zuli, Xu Guangyi and others. He also performed for foreign radio stations in Shanghai, including British Democracy Radio and the Voice of the Soviet Union Radio.\nIn 1949, Wei became a professor at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music. In 1954, he joined a Chinese delegation to South and Southeast Asia, in which he visited and performed in India, Myanmar and Indonesia. In 1956, Wei became the deputy director and later the director of the Folk Music Department of Shanghai Conservatory of Music. In 1962, he served as vice chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Musicians' Association.\nDuring the Cultural Revolution, Wei Zhongle was accused of and detained for being a \"reactionary academic authority\", partially for his complaints during the Great Chinese Famine. His disciple Tu Weigang bribed the guards to ensure that Wei could maintain a normal lifestyle.\nWei died of myocardial infarction in Huadong Hospital of Shanghai in 7 April 1997.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nPerformances of Wei Zhongle on Internet Archive",

        "content": "Emits Showers of Sparks is the second album by the American band Sixteen Deluxe, released in 1998. The first single was \"Purple\". The band supported the album with a North American tour that included film projection and a liquid light component. The album was delayed several months, and Warner Bros. Records eventually dropped the band, in part due to Sixteen Deluxe's reluctance to keep touring.\n\n\n== Production ==\nRecorded at Hyde Street Studios, in San Francisco, the album was produced by John Croslin. Most of the songs were written on acoustic guitar. Unlike on their debut album, Sixteen Deluxe were less concerned about burying their pop songs under effects and distortion. \"Large Animal Clinic\" uses Carrie Clark's lead vocal backed by her vocal harmonies.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nThe Salt Lake Tribune noted that \"the formula isn't new, a hard-edged guitar attack with pop melodies, laced with psychedelic effects.\" The San Diego Union-Tribune said that \"the most successful efforts here, 'Let It Go' and 'Captain Kirk's Z-Man House of Fun/Mixed Up', are bluesy, melodic and multilayered gems that culminate in slick psychedelic guitar noise.\" Entertainment Weekly opined that \"Sixteen Deluxe offers a witty pastiche of clean-cut '80s pop layered with up-to-the-second guitar-and-electronica distortion.\" USA Today labeled Emits Showers of Sparks \"warm classic pop made rugged by guitar fuzz, electronic static and ... barbed harmonies.\"\nThe Lincoln Journal Star stated that, \"through the entrancing, softly cool vocals of Carrie Clark and a gruffer variety from Chris Smith, Sixteen Deluxe mixes quality melodies with lots of noise, primarily from guitars, but gets extra depth from percussion and organ.\" The Los Angeles Daily News determined that the band \"create little dark musical corners in even the seemingly cheeriest places.\" CMJ New Music Monthly concluded that the album \"brings on uneasy relief by inducing alternating states of feverish anxiety and narcoleptic bliss.\" The Knoxville News Sentinel noted that, while \"Clark sprints over the blustery tracks with lithe melody, occasional lead vocalist Chris Smith is a weak and flavorless liability.\"\nAllMusic wrote that the \"lyrics are more prominent throughout ... no matter who is singing them, at times perhaps embracing a Generation X aesthetic a touch too closely.\" In 2009, Spin included Sixteen Deluxe on its list of \"The 100 Greatest Bands You've (Probably) Never Heard\", deeming Emits Showers of Sparks one of \"the 1990s' most pleasurably squalling albums.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Zapad 2013 (Russian: Запад 2013, lit. 'West 2013') military exercise was held by the armed forces of Russia and Belarus in Russia and Belarus from September 20 to 26, 2013.\n\n\n== Exercise ==\n\nZapad 2013 took place from September 20 to 26 in several training grounds in the Russian Federation and Belarus, including in the Arctic (Barents Sea), in the Kaliningrad enclave on the Baltic Sea and on the sea itself, as well as near cities of Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhniy Novgorod and Voronezh in central, western and southwestern Russia (Russian Western Military District). It involved  all branches of Russia’s armed forces, including special forces (Spetsnaz), with the singular exception of nuclear forces (which participated in Zapad 2009; however dual use Iskander missiles were launched during Zapad 2013). Official estimates for the number of troops participating were about 10,000; but international observes suggested it could have been as high as 60,000, 70,000 or 90,000 (Russia also conduced simultaneous Vzaimodeistiviye (“Mutual Action”) exercise with countries from the Collective Security Treaty Organization). Identified elements participating in the exercise included elements of the Russian Baltic Sea Fleet, the 6th and 20th Armies, as well as the 76th Guards Air Assault Division and the 31st Guards Air Assault Brigade. The exercises were supervised by Russian general Valery Gerasimov. Russian president Vladimir Putin and Belarussian president Alexander Lukashenko visited one of the training grounds where Zapad 2013 was taking place. \nThe exercise was officially described as having a counter-terrorism focus and aiming to test the Russian army command and control (C2) capabilities. Despite stated counter-terrorism focus with urban warfare elements, it also included training at repelling an amphibious invasion supported by naval and airborne elements, as well as anti-submarine warfare, electronic warfare, anti-aircraft warfare against bombers, and mobilization of reservists.\n\n\n== Analysis ==\n\nSeveral analysts presented their view on Zapad 2013  for the Jamestown Foundation. Stephen Blank noted that \"Russian exercises are important because they reveal where, against whom and in what form Russia is preparing to wage war\". He observed that the exercise showed some improvements in the Russian logistics, and also noted that their codename (Zapad, lit. West) may mislead foreign observers, as the exercise was very large in scale. Blank also pointed out that the \"enemy forces\", officially labelled as “Baltic terrorists” that invaded Belarus, were in fact representing NATO forces, and the exercise's real scope was not a preparation for counter-terrorism operations but for \"a large-scale war against a conventional army\". Pauli Järvenpää concurred with that assessment, noting that puzzlingly the exercise also included simulation of a conflict with the Finnish forces (at that time, not a part of NATO). Jörgen Elflying and Peter A. Mattsson noted that both Russian and international sources confirmed that Russian reforms to its C2 system still show need for further improvement. Ieva Bērziņa also agreed that there was an obvious mismatch between the official designation of the exercise as anti-terrorist and its large scale, concluding that it was a message of strategic deterrence to other countries (particularly NATO), as well as a reminder to the West that if Russia's wishes on the geopolitical arena are ignored, it is capable of enforcing them with force.\nGiangiuseppe Pili and Fabrizio Minniti writing for the Royal United Services Institute argued that Zapad 2013 was Russian attempt to \"integrate lessons learned from the 2008 war in Georgia\", focusing on flexibility and joint operations, as well as the use of smaller units (brigades rather than divisions) following recent Russian military reforms.\n\nAndrzej Wilk writing for the Centre for Eastern Studies called the exercise \"anti-NATO\" and noted that while it was a relatively regular event for the Russian army, it was the largest training activity for the Belarusian army in the last twenty years. He also suggested that one of the goals of Zapad 2013 was to create political fracture within NATO, by provoking politicians and media in NATO countries bordering Russia into making statements about Russian threat which would be dismissed as exaggerated by NATO members located further from Russia.\nAnna Maria Dyner writing for the Polish Institute of International Affairs suggested that the exercise was partially inspired by the Arab Spring and involved contingency planning in case of pro-democratic revolution in Belarus against Lukashenko, and aimed to discourage any foreign (non-Russian) intervention in such a conflict.\nBelarusian politician and dissent Andrej Sannikau argued that Zapad 2013 was a preparation for the 2014 annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation and War in Donbas.\n\n\n== International response ==\nRussia invited international observers and the official narrative stressed the transparent (as well as \"peaceful\" and \"defensive\") nature of the exercise. However, NATO observers were not invited. Some analysts also noted that the number and type of forces reported by the Russians to OSCE were significantly undercounted and certainly exceeded OSCE-agreed limits (of 9,000 soldiers). The exercise caused concern in Poland, Baltic states and Scandinavia. Officials and media in those countries described the exercise as destabilizing and intimidating, and \"not transparent\", criticizing the official narrative of Zapad 2013 as anti-terrorism while in reality it simulated a conflict with NATO members. Russian officials and media personalities dismissed the concerns from its neighbors as \"ridiculous\", although shortly afterward Russian actions in Ukraine have been seen as reinforcing these concerns.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Erika L. Dos Santos Ramos (Madrid, 1997), known artistically as Erika Dos Santos and Erika2Santos, is a Spanish rapper. She has been called a \"pioneer\" of women's freestyle and battle rap in Spain.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nErika Dos Santos was born in Madrid in 1997, into a family originally from Cape Verde. She lives in the San Cristóbal neighbourhood of Madrid. In 2016, Dos Santos gave the talk Cosas que hacer antes de morir at a TEDxYouth conference in Madrid. That same year, she won second prize in the Sanse Urbano festival, behind fellow rapper Alberto Robledo Bustos. In 2018, she participated in the Spanish edition of the X Factor television programme, obtaining four \"yeses\" for her performance and in which she was compared to Trinidadian rapper Nicki Minaj.\nDos Santos has participated four times in the Red Bull Batalla de Gallos. In 2017 she became the first woman to make it through the competition, reaching what at the time was called \"The Last Man\" (Spanish: El último hombre). This led the competition to change the name of the event to \"The Last Chance\" (Spanish: La última oportunidad), a name that has been maintained in subsequent editions. In 2019, she was a semi-finalist in the Batalla de Gallos. She was one of the first two women to make it through to the semi-final, along with fellow rapper Sara Socas.\nShe has also developed social projects that use rap as a form of social intervention. In 2018, she and Sara Socas gave workshops for teenagers at risk of social exclusion in high schools in the Community of Madrid. She has also promoted the Cypher School project to promote tolerance through rap, poetry and freestyle in La Parcería.\nIn 2023, on the occasion of International Women's Day, Dos Santos was one of eight women honoured by the Efeminista media for their women's rights activism.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Jake Rogers is a professional Australian rules footballer who was selected by the Gold Coast Suns with the fourteenth pick in the 2023 AFL draft.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nRogers was born in Melbourne to an Australian father and a South African mother. He moved with his family to the Gold Coast at five years of age and attended Varsity College throughout his upbringing. Rogers began playing junior football for the first time shortly after arriving in Queensland when he signed up to play for the Broadbeach Cats in the local Gold Coast under-6s competition. Rogers became a foundation member of the Gold Coast Suns when they entered the Australian Football League in 2011  and he joined the club's Academy at 13 years of age where he met future AFL teammates Jed Walter, Ethan Read and Will Graham. \nAlong with Australian rules football, Rogers also played rugby league for his school in the position of fullback. He made his senior QAFL debut for Broadbeach at 16 years of age in May 2021. In 2022, his club form was rewarded with selection to represent the Allies in the U18 National Championships as well as the Gold Coast Suns Academy in the U19 Talent League. His performances at the representative and club levels led to placement in the AFL's 30-player National Academy program on the eve of his draft year.\nIn 2023, he moved into top 20 draft calculations when he was awarded the best on ground award in the AFL U18 Academy's victory over Carlton's VFL team and also played a crucial role in the Allies' historic first U18 National Championship win which earned him a starting midfield position in the 2023 U18 All-Australian team. Rogers was drafted to his hometown team the Gold Coast Suns with pick 14 in the 2023 AFL draft after the Suns elected to match a bid from the Sydney Swans.\n\n\n== AFL career ==\nRogers will make his AFL debut for the Suns in round 6 of the 2024 season against the Sydney Swans at the Sydney Cricket Ground.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJake Rogers's profile on the official website of the Gold Coast Football Club",

        "content": "Ballysteen (Irish: Baile Stiabhna) is a small village and townland in County Limerick, Ireland. It is located in the civil parish of Iveruss and the historical barony of Kenry.\nEvidence of ancient settlement in the area includes a number of ringfort, enclosure and tower house sites in the townlands of Ballysteen, Beagh, Ballinvoher and Issane. Beagh Castle, an outpost fortification built in the 13th century by the FitzGerald family, is located close to Ballysteen village. Ballysteen House, an 18th-century country house, is reputedly built on the site of the former Ballysteen Castle. The Catholic church in Ballysteen, which dates to 1861, is in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Limerick. The ruins of a 15th or 16th-century chapel and churchyard are nearby in Beagh townland. Ballysteen's Carnegie library (constructed c. 1905) was restored in the early 21st century and is now a community and heritage centre.\nLocal sports clubs include Ballysteen GAA (a Gaelic Athletic Association club which fields teams in competitions organised by Limerick GAA), and Ballysteen AFC (an association football (soccer) club which participates in the Limerick Desmond League). The local primary school, Ballysteen National School, had an enrollment of 26 pupils as of 2024.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Florence Chatfield OBE (1 February, 1867 – 5 November, 1949) was an English-born Australian nurse. She was the matron of the Diamantina Hospital for Chronic Diseases for over 30 years. She was the first organiser of the Queensland Government Baby Clinics and she was a founding member of the Queensland branch of the Australasian Trained Nurses' Association.\n\n\n== Life ==\nChatfield was born in southern England in the town of Worthing in 1867. Her parents were Jane (born Porter) and William Chatfield who was a confectioner. She and her sister, Emily, left from Gravesend in 1885 and emigrated to Australia. They were on board the RMS Chyebassa with about 300 other immigrants. They were under the supervision of a matron. The rest of their family followed in 1887, although by this time their mother had died. They had arrived as domestic servants, but in 1889 and her sisters trained as nurses at Brisbane General Hospital.\n\nIn 1900 she became the matron of the Diamantina Hospital for Chronic Diseases. This was a role she would hold for 34 years.\n\nIn 1904, she was in charge of the very first meeting of what became the Queensland Branch of the Australasian Trained Nurses' Association (ATNA) and this was to receive her attention for the rest of her life. She and Ellen Barron were both ATNA council members and one year (1922-23) they job-shared the role of the organisation's secretary.\nChatfield was awarded an OBE in 1932 and in 1933 she gave a national broadcast on radio 4QG. She spoke about gender-roles and her belief that although barriers were being lowered between professions she believed that caring for the young and the sick would always be work undertaken by women.\nEllen Barron was still a colleague of Chatfield's and they lived together for part of their retirement. Chatfield died in the Brisbane surburb of Nundah in a private hospital in 1949. and Barron died in the War Veterans' Home at Caboolture on 8 July 1951.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBiography at ADB",

        "content": "Tittyshakers are sleazy grindin’ and shakin’ 45rpm records from the 1950s through to the mid-1960s that don’t fit comfortably within the boogaloo, funk and soul genres. Confusingly, the term can be appropriated to numerous genres, from Rockabilly to Go-Go music. Often Tittyshakers would be instrumentals.\nThe sound is fundamentally, as the name implies, any form of music that makes you want to “tear off your shirt and shake your titties, spinning the nipple tassels you are naturally wearing underneath your garments like the blades on a helicopter.”\nContrary to common misconception, the term tittyshaker is not representative of the contemporary culture of strippers and pole dancers, even if the two do obviously share origins.\nObvious reference points to the ‘shaker culture and style would be the early films of Russ Meyer, low-budget hot rod and rock’n’roll movies, sexploitation flicks, the Las Vegas Grind record compilations and certain WFMU radio shows.\nAmong the pantheon of tittyshaker tracks is the ferocious shaker is Buzz Saw by The Cee Gees. Other notable tracks include El Monkey by Saxie Russell and Camel Walk by The Original Starfires. A modern band associated with the genre is The Delusionaires.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe term \"tittyshakers\" was first used by writer and DJ Daddy Bones (Mark Allbones of Big Daddy Magazine) sometime during the late 1990s. In 2003, Tom Lawrie published an article in Soul Generation titled “Mommy What’s a Tittyshaker?”\n\n\n== Origins ==\nThe roots of tittyshaker can be traced back to 1950s America where in major cities through to backwater shacks and pit-stop bars the jukebox would wail out sleazy, lo-down and dirty rock ‘n’ roll or equally gritty jazz music.",

        "content": "ROCKS is an autonomous extended stand-off range air-to-surface missile developed by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems. Designed to engage high-value stationary and relocatable targets, the missile is particularly effective in GPS-denied environments. It incorporates technologies from Rafael's existing systems such as Popeye (missile) and SPICE.\nThe missile offers several key features, such as high accuracy with a Circular Error Probable (CEP) of 3 meters, day and night operation in all weather conditions, and resistance to electronic jamming. It is equipped with either a penetration or blast fragmentation warhead and can be deployed well outside of enemy air defense coverage.\nFor navigation and target acquisition, ROCKS uses a combination of inertial navigation system (INS), GPS, and an  electro-optical seeker. The terminal guidance employs scene-matching technology or anti-radiation homing to ensure target destruction, even in scenarios where GPS is compromised.\nThe missile was first revealed at the 2019 Aero India show in Bangalore.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "'Abd-Kulal al-Himyari (Arabic: عبد كلال الحميري), or 'Abd-Kalal, was a regent and former governor of Himyar who assisted during the rule of Sharhabil Yafar and later Sharhabil Yakkuf. 'Abd-Kulal was an Ebionite Christian who concealed his faith in secret as the Himyarites were generally hostile against Christianity. His son Marthad'ilan Yanuf would later become the ruler of Himyar starting from the early 6th century.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n'Abd-Kulal was the governor of Himyar, and a very experienced one as mentioned by the historian Al-Tabari. After the demise of Sharhabil Yafar, Sharhabil Yakkuf would have taken the throne, however Sharhabil Yakkuf was mentally unfit for the task due to conditions in his mental health. Hence, 'Abd-Kulal took over the leadership for him, fearing that someone from outside the royal family would usurp the ruling power. He was qualified enough to be a temporary ruler and regent, due to his commendable skills in governing as well as his popularity amongst the people. 'Abd-Kulal was not fond of leading invasions or conquests, and his reign was generally a peaceful one.\n\n\n== Religion ==\nThe historians Al-Tabari, Ibn al-Athir, and Jawad Ali stated that 'Abd-Kulal was an Ebionite Christian. 'Abd-Kulal was very focused on his religion and often declined to participate in worldy affairs, leading a very ascetic lifestyle. He was taught this form of Christianity by a man from Ghassan, who was executed by the Himyarites; to avoid the same fate, 'Abd-Kulal hid his religious affiliation from his superiors. However, another source mentions that he had hidden his religious affiliation to avoid an invasion from the Sassanian ruler Shapur II, who had attacked Constantinople out of his hatred against Christianity. \n\n\n== See also ==\nMarthad'ilan Yanuf\nList of rulers of Saba' and Himyar\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "John Michael Harrhy (born 1 September 1942) is a former motorcycle speedway rider from England.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHarrhy, born in Brandon, Warwickshire, began his British leagues career riding for Coventry Bees as a junior in 1968. The following season he broke into the first team but spent most of the season loaned out to Ipswich Witches during the 1969 British League Division Two season season. He made an immediate impact in Suffolk, topping the team's averages in his rookie season.\nHe enjoyed an even better season in 1970, helping Ipswich win the Knockout Cup (tier 2) and recording a 9.21 season average.  \nHe returned to the Coventry team in 1972, rising to third in the team averages and would remain with the Bees until the end of the 1976 season. Several issues during the 1976 season resulted in Harrhy stating that he was going to retire but he continued to the end of the season before missing the 1977 campaign.\nHaarhy returned to speedway for the 1978 National League season with Stoke Potters.\n\n\n== Retuirement ==\nAfter speedway, Harrhy bought Windmill Farm in 1979 and turned it into a hotel and golf venue. He later sold the Windmill Village Hotel and Golf Club for £7 million to businessman Roy Richards, who also owned the National Motorcycle Museum (UK).\n\n\n== References ==",

It originates from the 19th-century Spanish dish galantina de pollo (also known as pollo relleno in modern Latin America), which in turn is derived from the French galantine dishes. It is popularly served during Christmas dinner (noche buena) in the Philippines. It is typically eaten with white rice or with bread.\n\n\n== Description ==\nChicken galantina is prepared by first deboning the chicken and seasoning or marinating it with salt, pepper, calamansi (or lemon) juice, patis (fish sauce), and soy sauce. It is then filled with a mixture of ground pork (giniling), hard-boiled eggs, sausages (like chorizo de Bilbao, chorizo de Macao, or Vienna sausage), and various other ingredients, including, but not limited to: ham, bacon, minced red bell peppers, minced carrots, crushed pineapples, onion, pickle relish, raisins, mushrooms, garlic, paprika, butter, freshly ground black pepper, cheese, flour or soaked white bread, and beaten eggs, among others. The chicken is then sewn up and wrapped in cheesecloth or aluminum foil (depending on whether it is steamed or oven-roasted, respectively). If steamed, it is then refrigerated and flattened slightly before being sliced into rolls and served. If oven-roasted, it is just allowed to cool slightly for several minutes before slicing and serving.\n\n\n== See also ==\nEmbutido\nMorcón\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Antoni Matuszkiewicz (born 13 August 1945) is a Polish poet, prose writer, playwright, journalist, and promoter of literary life. As a poet, he expresses himself in a modern and, at the same time, spiritual manner.\nAn opposition activist during the Polish People's Republic, he was interned on 13 December 1981. Associated with Świdnica, and later with the eastern part of the Kłodzko Land. Since 2008, he has been living in Martínkovice in the Czech Republic.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHe was born on 13 August 1945 in Lviv into a family of teachers. In April 1946, his parents Władysław and Maria née Alexandrowicz moved with him to Olesno in Opolian Silesia, where they lived until 1948, then to Świdnica, where Antoni graduated from the Jan Kasprowicz High School. From 1963 to 1968, he studied history at the University of Wrocław, while also participating in the Interdepartmental Cultural and Educational Studies, and was a member of Polish Students' Association. From 1961 to 1980, he was a voluntary guardian of monuments for Polish Tourist and Sightseeing Society.\nFrom 1968 to 1970, he was the head of the collections department at the Cyprian Kamil Norwid Municipal Public Library in Świdnica. From 1971 to 1972, he was an instructor at the Świdnica Cultural Center. In 1976, he completed postgraduate studies in Museology at the Jagiellonian University in Kraków. From 1973 to 1979, he worked at the Museum of Old Merchants in Świdnica; from 1976 as its director. From 1979 to 1982, he was the head of the scientific and educational department at the District Museum in Wałbrzych.\nAfter the period of internment, he was released from the museum, and in 1982 he started working as a clerk at the Lower Silesian Graphic Works in Wałbrzych, then from 1983 to 1985 he worked as a laborer at the Galess candle factory in Świdnica; in 1985 he briefly worked at an antique shop. From 1987 to 1988, he was an instructor in the publishing department of the Provincial Center for Culture and Art \"Książ Castle\", and from 1989 to 1990, he was the deputy editor-in-chief of Niezależne Słowo.\nAfter the Polish Round Table Agreement, the birth of the Third Polish Republic, and the political changes, he founded the Pluton Publishing House, of which he was the owner from 1991 to 1994. He published 20 books by authors associated with the region and classics of literature, including Sándor Petőfi, János Pilinszky, Kahlil Gibran. In 1995, he worked at the Association of Friends of Sick Children Serce in Świdnica.\nIn 1996, he moved from Świdnica to Stronie Śląskie, then after a year to Stary Gierałtów in the Golden Mountains, and since 2008, he has been living in Martínkovice near the Polish border, near Broumov in the Czech Republic.\n\n\n== Social activism and activities in the opposition ==\nFrom 1973, he was involved in the informal Club of Catholic Intelligentsia in Świdnica (registered as a branch of Club of Catholic Intelligentsia in Wałbrzych from 1983). In September 1980, he was a co-organizer of the Founding Committee of Solidarity at the District Museum, later becoming the chairman of the plant committee. In 1981, he was the founder, editor-in-chief, author, and organizer of the independent publication Niezależne Słowo (until December 1981), and also contributed to Solidarność Dolnośląska. As a member of the Lower Silesian Board of the Wałbrzych Region of Solidarity from 13 December 1981 to 26 February 1982, he was interned in isolation centers in Strzebielinek and Kamienna Góra. In 1982, he was dismissed from his job, and from 1985 to 1987, he was unemployed. In 1989, he participated in the election campaign of the Solidarity Citizens' Committee.\nFor many years (until 1996 when he left Świdnica), he was a significant animator of literary life in Świdnica. He was involved in the Regional Society of the Świdnica Region, was an active member of the Association for the Sake of Man ITON, a member of the boards of ITON, the Association of Friends of the Biała Lądecka Valley Kruszynka in Nowy Gierałtów, and the Limestone Museum Association in Stara Morawa.\nHe was the guardian of the Świdnica Literary Club Logos. He promotes poets and writers, conducts poetry workshops, and provides introductions to the volumes of other poets. He translates Czech poets. He is a founding member of the Polish Writers Association. In the Kłodzko Land, he organized literary meetings as part of the Literary University. In the summer of 1999, he conducted a Literary Retreat on the Biała Lądecka river. From 1999 to 2000, he was the editor of the regional-artistic magazine Stronica Śnieżnicka published by the Union of Śnieżnickie Municipalities.\nWith Věra Kopecká, they have been co-organizers of Poetry Days in Broumov (Czech: Dny poezie v Broumově) for many years. At the 20th Poetry Days, they jointly published an anthology Pegas nad Broumovem, containing poems from participants of the Poetry Days from 2010 to 2019 (55 writers, mainly Czech, Slovak, and Polish, as well as from Bulgaria, Greece, Lithuania, Russia, Ukraine, and Vietnam), which were published in Czech, Slovak, and Polish. At the same time, seminars, meetings, and discussions were organized in Broumov, the Czech Republic (including Prague and Hradec Králové), and in Poland. The 22nd edition took place in 2021.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\nOfficer's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta (2021)\nCross of Freedom and Solidarity (2022)\nHonorary Member of the Polish-Czech Group of Poets '97 (2001)\nJohn Paul II Honorary Award for outstanding contributions to promoting understanding and international cooperation in the spirit of Christianity – awarded by the Organizing Committee of the Polish-Czech Days of Christian Culture (2020)\n\n\n== Works ==\nIn 1972, his poems were published for the first time in the monthly magazine Odra. He is the author of over thirty volumes of poetry, prose poetry, and dramas. He has also published almost a hundred articles, texts, and reviews in various periodicals including: Borussia (Olsztyn), Dialog (Warsaw), Format (Wrocław), Fraza (Rzeszów), Krasnogruda (Sejny), Tytuł (Gdańsk), W drodze (Poznań), Więź (Warsaw), and others.\nAntoni Matuszkiewicz's poetry is meditative, full of emotions, sensitive to detail, to the human environment and nature. He often describes the space of encounter with God and examines the biblical and Christian tradition in a new, very personal theology.\n\nPoet, writer, and literary critic Karol Maliszewski believes that Antoni Matuszkiewicz expresses himself in his own way (the poet of his own voice and one theme), avant-garde yet spiritually (as if a modern artist were trying to reconcile [...] inventive metaphor with something eternal, with something akin to mystical spiritual formation). Matuszkiewicz's poems constantly speak of love, yet:Matuszkiewicz does not renounce the body. [...] In the volume from 1989, titled \"New Year\", not only does the naked female body shine through, at times it speaks with a full voice. The poet allows it to express itself.An important feature of the poet's expression is the awareness of his Lviv roots and the ecumenical mythology of reconciliation between Poles, Ukrainians, and Jews. On the other hand, he follows the traces of the intertwining of Silesian cultures in their German, Czech, and Polish varieties, intrigued by the phenomenon of cultural proximity. He draws poetic realities from the neighborhood. Bielice (\"the last village on the edge of the homeland\"), Błędne Skały, Broumov, Gierałtów, Owl Mountains, Golden Mountains, Kłodzko, Nowa Ruda, Ślęża, Śnieżnik, and Wambierzyce are for the poet a reserve of locality open to universality.\n\n\n=== Chosen works ===\n\n\n==== Poetry ====\nTropy.

        "content": "Double Shot was an independant record label in the United States that was founded in 1966. Artists that recorded for the label include Count Five, Floyd and Jerry, Bobby Freeman, Kent & The Candidates, Señor Soul, Shirley & Shep, The Vanguards, Brenton Wood, and The Youngfolk.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe label was owned by Hal Winn and Joe Hooven. They were also the label's producers. \nThe vice-president for the label was Irwin Zucker.\nTheir headquarters were located at 6515 Sunset Boulevard, Hollywood California.\n\n\n== History ==\nIt was reported by Record World in the magazine's August 6, 1966, issue that Double Shot, a new label, had rejected twelve offers from major record companies for a hot record they had on their label. They decided to take care of the national business of the Count Five hit, \"Psychotic Reaction\" themselves.\nIt was reported in the April 15, 1967, issue of Record World that Brenton Wood's single \"The Oogum Boogum Song\" having broken as an r&b hit was now in the National Top 40. The label was also getting ready with a release by the Count Five with \"You Must Believe Me\". The Count Five's single which was a Curtis Mayfield cover had been reviewed earlier by Record World and was a four star pick. Also that year, Señor Soul signed to the label after Chuck Miller the founder of the group came into the label's office touting the band.\nIt was reported in the June 28, 1969, issue of Billboard that Irwin Zucker the vice president of the label had embarked on a 15-city tour promotion campaign for artists on the Double Shot label. They were Bobby Freeman, Brenton Wood, Count Five, Georgia Prophets and Bagdads. The campaign also included acts Señor Soul and The Vanguards which were on Double Shot's subsidiary, the Wizz label. Unfortunately for Zucker, on June 17, he was injured in a head on automobile collision whilst on the first leg of his tour. He suffered head injuries. With him was Stan Daniels, Promotion Manager of Record Sales Dist. Daniels the driver also suffered leg injuries.

        "content": "Harriet Elizabeth De Claire (née Billings; 1836–1927) was an American seamstress and writer. Born into a Puritan New Englander family associated with the abolitionist movement, she moved to Michigan and married Hector De Claire, with whom she had three daughters. After the death of their oldest daughter, Marion, they moved to St. Johns, where the family lived in extreme poverty. During their childhood, her daughters Adelaide and Voltairine developed a love of reading, which Harriet nurtured with the poetry of Lord Byron. But their financial situation also made Harriet emotionally distant from her children, which Adelaide would come to forgive, but Voltairine would not. After her children grew up, she kept in constant touch with Voltairine, even as her child's politics grew more radical and distant from Harriet's social conservatism. Her correspondence with Voltairine, which lasted up until her death, became a key primary source on her life and was collected in Harvard University's Ishgill Collection and the University of Michigan's Labadie Collection. Harriet De Claire spent the rest of her life in St. Johns, where she died in 1927.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life and family ===\nHarriet Elizabeth Billings was born on December 27, 1836, in Rochester, New York. The daughter of Pliny and Alice Billings, she was the youngest of eight children. The family were originally New Englanders of Puritan affiliation, who had moved to the burned-over district of New York State. Pliny was involved in William Lloyd Garrison's abolitionist movement and helped establish a link of the Underground Railroad in Rochester, where he helped slaves escape to Canada.\n\n\n=== Marriage and domestic troubles ===\nIn 1853, Billings moved to Kalamazoo, Michigan, where she met Hector De Claire, whom she married on March 28, 1861. They moved to Leslie, where they had three daughters: Marion (b. May 26, 1862), Adelaide (b. March 10, 1864) and Voltairine (b. November 17, 1866). Hector named their youngest after the French philosopher Voltaire, despite Harriet's protests due to her Puritan social views. In May 1867, their eldest daughter Marion went missing while playing. Harriet went looking for her and found her dead, having drowned in a nearby river. The loss of their first child was psychologically devastating for the De Claires, who subsequently decided to move away to a small house in St. Johns, where Harriet would live for the rest of her life.\nThe family was plunged into extreme poverty, with Harriet taking up work as a seamstress in order to supplement Hector's income as a tailor. Despite the financial difficulties, they managed to pay for their daughters' meager food, clothing and education. Unable to afford Christmas presents, Harriet's two daughters made gifts for her out of scraps. In a letter to the anarchist printer Joseph Ishill, Adelaide later wrote that her mother's life may have been a \"disappointment\" to her. Long stretches of poverty and malnutrition caused Harriet to develop a chronic condition of sinusitis. She also withdrew her affection from her daughters, with Voltairine writing in an 1889 poem:\n\nSome souls there are which never live their life;\nSome suns there are which never pierce their cloud;\nSome hearts there are which cup their perfume in,\nAnd yield no incense to the outer air.\nCloud-shrouded, flower-cupped heart: such is thine\nown:\nSo dost thou live with all thy brightness hid;\nSo dost thou dwell with all thy perfume close;\nRich in thy treasured wealth, aye, rich indeed—\nAnd they are wrong who say thou \"dost not feel.\"\n\nDuring their childhood, Adelaide and Voltairine enjoyed reading with Harriet, who particularly liked the poetry of Lord Byron. While putting her children to bed, Harriet would often read Byron's poetry to them, which became one of Adelaide's fondest memories of her. Byron's writing style would go on to be a key influence on Voltairine's own poetry. As Voltairine increasingly retreated into the family's maple trees, seeking privacy and a safe place to write her own poetry, Harriet wanted to cut the trees down, but was prevented from doing so by Adelaide. During the 1870s, Hector left the family home in order to seek work in Port Huron; he never returned, although he sent money in order to support them. In 1879, when Adelaide became seriously ill, Harriet was left unable to care for both her children alone and sent Voltairine away to live with her father. But Voltairine hated Port Huron, calling it a \"nasty hole\" in letters to Harriet, in which she expressed her desire to return home. In September 1880, Hector informed Harriet in a letter that he had enrolled Voltairine in a Convent, hoping it would instil discipline within her, \"as I doubt not you know she needs.\" Hector told Harriet that she would need to censor herself while writing to their daughter, as all correspondence was closely monitored by the nuns. After some time adjusting, Voltairine began to express greater happiness with her education in her letters to Harriet, who she reassured that Catholicism was not being imposed on her by the nuns. Due to Harriet's presbyterian affiliations, her daughter had been admitted as a protestant and granted certain privileges that were dnied to the Catholic students.\nOnce they had grown up, Harriet wanted to guide her daughters into appropriate areas of American society. Although Adelaide had wanted to work as a journalist for a newspaper, her mother pressed her to find work as a schoolteacher. Harriet also disapproved of Adelaide's conversion to a Baptist denomination, as well as her marrying two working class men. Adelaide later excused her mother's behavior towards her, attributing it to Harriet being the youngest of eight children, \"so she naturally grew up very self-centered.\" Voltairine herself, although she remained a devoted daughter throughout her life - regularly visiting Harriet and supporting her financially at great cost to herself - wasn't forgiving of her attitude:\n\nI couldn't fulfil your wishes for me, which were probably that I would have entertained your own principles, married some minister or doctor, or been one of them myself, and have a home, children, and a warm room for you—I mean the idea that the parent gives to the hild in youth and the youth returns to the parent in age. All that is utterly foreign to me. I have wanted even less of life than you, for myself. I have cared neither for a home nor any of its addenda. But I have wanted a whole lot of other things, and I've got some of them. I have wanted to travel and see the whole world; I've seen some. I've wanted to print the force of my will—not over-rating it-on the movement towards human liberty. And I have done that, to a certain extent. I have failed in one thing, and that was to hold a place in literature. And I think I have failed partly because I haven't cheek and persistence enough, and mostly because I've always had to do other things. But altogether I think [ve had more satisfaction in my forty years than you in your seventy.\n\n\n=== Letters from Voltairine ===\n\nAfter Voltairine graduated from the convent and began publishing her poetry, she started signing her name as \"Voltairine de Cleyre\". She wrote regularly to her mother about various topics, including her friends, her travels, her political thoughts and activism, and even advice on hair products. When Voltairine began advocating for \"new and strange ideas\", she initially hid from Harriet, but opened up to her about in December 1887, as she thought that she \"ought to know.\" She elaborated to Harriet of that she now rejected all religious, social and political authority, which was disturbing to Harriet, a socially conservative Presbyterian. Following a speech by Clarence Darrow that she had witnessed that same month, Voltairine wrote to her mother about her hatred of the \"coal-kings\" and \"salt-owners\", due to their creation of monopolies and their exploitation of labor. Voltairine admitted to her mother that \"it is so strange to me that you are so afraid of anarchy and socialism\"; although she considered herself neither an anarchist or socialist, she saw both as lesser evils to monopoly capitalists.\nAfter becoming a mother herself, Voltairine wrote to Harriet of her depression, and complained to her about how her son Harry wouldn't apply himself to his studies, at her own expense. In 1891, Voltairine began to write to Harriet about the poverty of Jewish immigrants who she taught English in Philadelphia: \"I will send you some of their compositions to read sometimes. There are times when I can’t speak for keeping back the tears when I am correcting them; they are mostly so pathetic—always on one subject—the misery of the poor.\" She herself began to experience greater poverty during this time, writing to Harriet that she hadn't bought a dress in three years and that malnutrition was exacerbating her chronic condition. Due to her financial situation, in 1893, she wrote to Harriet that she was considering marrying a man named Bentley, purely as a \"business transaction\". Still she also wrote to Harriet of how the Jewish children bought her Christmas presents, in spite of their own poverty. In response to the time she spent with them, she expressed to Harriet her desire to learn the Russian and Hebrew languages.\nWhen she met Johann Most in May 1894, she wrote to Harriet about his oratory abilities, which she found impressive even though she didn't sympathise with his communist politics. When Illinois governor John Peter Altgeld posthumously pardoned the Haymarket martyrs, she sung his praises to Harriet, calling him a \"brave man\" who had sacrificed his political career \"to save the poor workingmen\". In 1897, she reported to Harriet that her life had made her \"in a sterner mold than the original tendencies of childhood may have seemed to you to indicate\", declaring: \"I have my own principles, and should despise myself as a caitiff wretch did I not live in accordance with them.\"\nWhen she travelled to England, she wrote to Harriet of her discomfort on the boat, with its \"terrible food\", \"awful beds\" and \"disagreeable chattering lot of company.\" From London, she reported to Harriet of the sights she had visited, including the tomb of Lord Byron, telling her that \"I have seen your beloved Byron's own handwriting in a page of Childe Harold I think.\" She was particularly impressed by Stonehenge and its surrounding area, which she had always wanted to visit, telling Harriet that \"you would not have thought there was so lonely a place in England.\" In contrast, she wrote of London as an \"abominably dirty place\", where the air pollution made the temperature hotter, while also noting that \"the streets are kept cleaner than the American city streets on the whole.\" During her time in London, she also met refugees that had fled Spain and reported to Harriet in graphic detail of the marks of torture she had seen on their bodies. She wrote to Harriet that she was particularly impressed by Fernando Tarrida del Mármol, who became a key influence on her own anarchist theories. She then left London for Scotland, which she fell deeply in love with, telling her mother: \"O Scotland, bonnie, bonnie Scotland! I never loved a place so much as Scotland.\" She sent Harriet a copy of The Trossachs and Loch Lomond; she also wrote to her of her sadness that the \"once beautiful valley\" of Dundee had been \"disfigured by vomiting chimneys\" and reported of the child labor in the city's workhouses.\nIn the wake of the assassination of William McKinley, Voltairine reported to Harriet that she had become a target of a moral panic due to her anarchist affiliations, but believed the fervor would subside and personally expressed her regret that McKinley had died. But in a letter she sent to Harriet the following week, she expressed concern that the anti-anarchist rhetoric was turning violent; she began to wish that she would be deported and left to \"live in peace far from anything that would ever remind me of America.\" The following month, she expressed worry to Harriet that the affair was causing a rise in \"reactionary sentiments\", while also pointing out that such assassination attempts were an occupational hazard inherent to the position of head of state. She also expressed sympathy for the assassin Leon Czolgosz, telling Harriet that she hoped he would soon be at peace, wondering how unhappy he must have been to commit such an act.\nTo Harriet, Voltairine also expressed her distaste for the institutions of marriage, saying that to her: \"any dependence, any thing which destroys the complete selfhood of the individual, is in the line of slavery and destroys the pure spontaneity of love.\" She also expressed her skepticism of science to Harriet, saying that while it had done so much to advance knowledge, \"we know no more than did the ancient Greek\", and speculated of how in the future, present knowledge would be seen as \"foolish\" and \"mythical\".\n\n\n=== Later life and death ===\nBy 1898, Voltairine was overworked and her illness was worsening. When Harriet finally visited Voltairine in Philadelphia in 1899, she expressed a dislike for her daughter's anarchist friends such as Mary Hansen, and was disgusted by her cockroach-infested house. In a letter to Adelaide, she complained that Voltairine gave all her money away to other people, while neglecting herself, not even spending money on a decent dress. While Voltairine was away on a lecture tour, Harriet took the opportunity to clean her apartment and expressed her distaste for her daughters lack of housekeeping, remarking that she had \"only one knife, and that without a handle\". Voltairine attempted to seek respite from her stressful worklife in Atlantic City, but told Harriet that she had ended up hating the place. Increasingly seeking solitude, she told her mother that \"I think of myself in heaven when I have a long fair day ahead of me and nobody to talk to me for ten hours solid.\" She was able to find peace in the interludes between her busy schedule, occassionally visiting Harriet and Adelaide in St. Johns. \nBy the following year, Voltairine's financial situation had improved as she made more money from teaching, some of which she sent to Harriet. Over the years, Voltairine's income eventually grew to $13.50 per week, part of which she sent to her mother. Harriet complained that the amount she was sending her, which amounted to $1,000 in total, was \"impractical\". Although Voltairine's teaching work earned her a steady income, she confided to Harriet that it also physically exhausted her and left her without any free time, which was making her consider alternative career options. But alternatives to teaching were difficult to find, as she found objections to each possible option when discussing it with Harriet. She told her that she \"wouldn't mind my work, if only I wasn't obliged to be always at it to keep it together. She attempted to pursue a career in writing, but was unsuccessful, explaining to her mother that it was \"partly because I haven't cheek and persistence enough, and mostly because I've always had to do other things.\"\nDuring the 1900s, Voltairine's health began to sharply decline and she was hospitalised. For a period, Harriet moved to Philadelphia in order to care for her daughter, who was in constant pain. When she left again for St. Johns, she left Voltairine in the care of her student Nathan Navro. She wrote to her mother that Navro \"remains pure gold—in trouble or in joy always the same\". When Hector De Claire died in 1906, Voltairine said to her mother that \"he hadn't much out of his life either, had he?\" By 1908, Voltairine was complaining to her mother of constant headaches and inflammation. As Voltairine's physical health declined, so too did her mental health. In February 1909, she wrote to Harriet that it was pointless for her to seek happiness, as her view of the world had become completely alienated from any thought of joy. \nAs her health continued to decline, in the autumn of that year, Voltairine herself decided to stay with her mother in St. Johns, although she clarified that Harriet \"should not expect much help around the house\". Harriet's own health had improved over the previous years, with Voltairine speculating that \"her one disease is lonesomeness, outside of old age\" and worried that Harriet would become \"miserable\" after she left again. In April 1912, an infection again hospitalised Voltairine, who wrote to Harriet that the back of her nose had completely decayed. After Voltairine died in June 1912, Harriet travelled from St. Johns to Chicago, together with Adelaide, in order to attend her funeral. Her friend Annie Livshis, who had nursed Voltairine in her final moments, sent Harriet her fur cap. Harriet responded: \"it was what she wore the last sight I had of her living face. The dearest daughter that ever a woman had. I shall love you always because you were good to her.\"\nFollowing Voltairine's death, Harriet began signing her own name \"Harriet de Cleyre\", in honor of her daughter. Her correspondence with Voltairine was also collected by the Ishill Collection at Harvard University and the Labadie Collection at the University of Michigan. Harriet De Claire died in her home in St. Johns, in 1927, at the age of ninety.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==",

He is the first Christian to officially become the ruler of Himyar.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMarthad'ilan Yanuf was the son of 'Abd-Kulal, a former Himyarite governor who took the throne as a temporary regent acting for Sharhabil Yakkuf. He was a Christian, just like his father. In the early years of his rule, Marthad'ilan Yanuf allowed three ambassadors from Aksum to build a palace for themselves at Dhofar; the inscriptions also state that he provided support for the project. Marthad'ilan Yanuf appears to have reigned for 15 years based on inscriptions, while the Arab historians gave him a reign of forty years. He had a son named Wali'ah, who was a well-respected government official.\n\n\n== Alleged persecution of Christians ==\nSome sources have reported that Marthad'ilan Yanuf persecuted Christians, however with recent archaeological finds, this does not seem to be the case, as Marthad'ilan Yanuf himself was a Christian.\n\n\n== See also ==\n'Abd-Kulal\nList of rulers of Saba' and Himyar\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Sieges of Tranquebar (Danish; Belejringerne af Trankebar) or the War between Tranquebar and Thanjavur (Danish; Krigen mellem Trankebar og Tanjore) refers to the warfare between the Thanjavur Nayak kingdom and Danish Tranquebar between 1655 – 1669. The Thanjavurian sieges were repelled, mainly due to the new fortifications being build around Tranquebar, and a peace agreement was issued in 1669.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1643 the vessel Christianshavn would arrive in Tranquebar with proclaimed governor, Willem Leyel. Unbeknownst to the Danes in India would be that, this was the last ship from Denmark for 26 years: Because of the Dano-Swedish Wars Denmark did not have the means to send any new ship to India, so Tranquebar could therefore not be assited from Denmark. This led to financial difficulties and a general lack of Danish manpower.\nIn 1648 a mutiny broke out in Tranquebar and Leyel was subsequently arrested. He was succeded by Poul Hansen Korsør, who reigned until his death on 7 September 1655. Furthermore the first Danish East India Company was dissestablished in 1650, and the number of Danes remained only a handful.\n\nArriving together with the Christianshavn in 1643, Eskild Andersen (Kongsbakke) now became the new governor of Tranquebar. Andersen would try to preserve the economy by regularly sending ships to Makassar and Bantam, and wage privateering against the Mughal Empire.\n\n\n== Sieges ==\nThe Nayak of the Thanjavur kingdom, Vijaya Raghava, had waged war against the Gingee and Madurai and therefore needed sufficient money. The Thanjavurians took advantage of a weakened Tranquebar and in 1655 demanded to raise the early tribute paid by Tranquebar. When Tranquebar failed to fulfill this demand Raghava sent a force to besiege Tranquebar. Though, Andersen defended the attack by the help of the local Indians: The number of Danish settlers in Tranquebar was very small, and it was therefore necessary to hire Portuguese mercenaries and Indian Sepoys to defend Fort Dansborg.\nIn 1660 a new siege was initiated, which would last nine months. In response Andersen started to fortify the whole town. Previously Dansborg had been the only fortified place, and the Inhabitants of Tranquebar would usually seek shelter in the fort. This was now changed, and all of Tranquebar was fortified. Andersen made the locals build a Curtain wall around the city, with four additional towers.\nIn May 1669 the 29-year-isolation was over with the arrival of the frigate Farø at Tranquebar. Færø arrived with soldiers and goods under the command of Henrik Eggers. As a result of Færø's arrival peace was concluded with Vijaya Raghava.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nAs a result of the peace the nayak ceded the villages of Poreiar, Tillali and Erikutanchery, which greatly enlargened Tranquebar. Meanwhile, Færø would be sent to Java to reestablish trade connections with the local sultan.\n\n\n== See also ==\nWillem Leyel's siege of Dansborg – Siege of Fort Dansborg, 1644\nAmbush near the Bay of Manila – Ambush of Danish and Dutch sailors in the Phillipines, 1645\nTillali Massacre – Massacre and Battle in Tillali, India 1756\nDano-Mughal War – Danish colonial conflict against the Mughal Empire\n\n\n== Notelist ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ida Jimmy ǃHa-Eiros (1945–2024) was a Namibian independence activist and SWAPO politician. She is considered a national heroine of Namibia. \nJimmy was born on 16 November 1945 in Lüderitz, South West Africa. She became a SWAPO member in 1972 and became chairperson of the SWAPO Women Council in 1977. At that time she worked for a fishing company. She lost her job for her activism and was detained several times. Jimmy served a 5 months, 3 weeks prison sentence in Gobabis in 1978 and was then placed under house arrest in Lüderitz for one year. In 1980 she was arrested under the Terrorism Act and sentenced to 7 years in prison. Upon appeal, the sentence was reduced to the minimum sentence under that act, 5 years. She gave birth in prison to her son Richard Konjeleni who initially was not allowed to be taken out, but was then taken to Jimmy's mother. When Richard Konjeleni died in 1983 she was not allowed to attend the funeral.\nAfter Namibian independence Jimmy became councillor of Keetmanshoop constituency. She also became a member of SWAPO's central committee and politburo. For her activist work she received awards from Namibian presidents Sam Nujoma and Hifikepunye Pohamba, as well as from Cuban president Fidel Castro.\nJimmy died on 3 April 2024, reportedly a poor woman. President Nangolo Mbumba ordered three days of national mourning in her honour for 19–21 April 2024 and directed that she receives a Hero's funeral.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "For the article on smart cities see: Smart city\n\n\n== Concepts and failures ==\nAlthough smart cities in their modern manifestation are a new concept, utopian visions of how we could physically organise society and our cities can be found as early as the 16th century. Thomas More’s Utopia, a fictional island society in the New World is a landmark depiction of the future. Based around the challenges affecting urban England in the early 16th century, Utopia “manifests itself as a future state of affairs that stands in opposition to war, oppression, and in justice, by proposing a new social structure based on common ownership.” Others include Edward Bellamy’s own utopia based on the struggles of industrial 19th century United States which depict a world without a modern capitalistic system and instead a world of universal employment and total equality.\nOther earlier concepts originate from architecture and planners. One of the earliest concepts of what we can now refer to as a smart city came in the form of the Garden Cities, envisioned by Ebenezer Howard.  In reaction to overpopulation and industrial pollution, garden cities were envisioned as compact towns \"surrounded by rolling green belts and populated by self-contained and self-sufficient communities.\" They would grow into the countryside from cities, with the belief that this connection between cities and rural environments would set the ground for new developments and lifestyles, and allow more sustainable urban planning policies with the potential to end urban poverty. However, the garden city experiments have only failed, being incapable of building truly self-sufficient communities and properly aiding the needs of low-wage workers. Furthermore, its financial model was not conducive to attracting sufficient financial investments.\nHowever, despite their drawbacks, the ideals of the garden city movements did not disappear. Figures like Frank Lloyd Wright and Charles Edouard Jeanneret, better known as Le Corbusier were also stimulated by similar visions of the future.  \nLe Corbusier’s revolutionary Radian City city plan revolved around the idea that the unsustainable development patterns and shortcomings of 19th century cities could not evolve into modern cities for the 20th century, and instead that cities should be build anew. “These are the main features of the Radian City, which rises from a regular layout and a highly organised zoning system composed of the following parallel areas: satellite towns for hosting special functions, such as government buildings; the business center; railroad station and air terminal; hotels and embassies; housing areas segregated by income, which are split between middle-class apartments in monolithic skyscrapers or luxury high-density living arrangements and six-story buildings and modest accommodations for lower-income residents factories; warehouses; and heavy industry.” Le Corbusier felt that “the city of today is dying because it is not constructed geometrically. To build on a clear site is to replace the accidental layout of the ground, the only one that exists today, by the formal layout. Otherwise nothing can save us. And the consequence of geometrical plans is repetition and mass-production And as a consequence of repetition, the standard is created, and so perfection.\"\nHowever, attempts to replicate his vision in the real world failed. Studies of Chandigarh, a new city build developed in the 1950s around Le Corbusier’s Radian City, was by the 1980s an ‘incubator of poverty and injustice, uncovering the limitations of the utopian vision proposed by Le Corbusier. The project has been accused of having a “profound misunderstanding of human nature,’ a lack of concern for the lifestyle habits, and a misguided assumption that a one-size-fits-all design can fulfil everyone’s needs.\nApproaching cities with a new models was also the goal for Frank Lloyd Wright with his vision of Broadacre City. He believed that innovation and technologies would allow humans to leave industrial cities and adopt rural, lower-density settlements in more natural environments. It was meant to ‘reestablish the symbiotic relationship between human beings and natural environments.’\nThe projects conception began in 1924, building on similar foundations and philosophical principles as Howard’s garden city. They shared the same: “rejection of the big city, the same populist antipathy to finance capital and landlordism, and same anarchist rejection of big government, the same reliance on the liberating effects of new technologies, and the same belief in the homesteading principle and the return to the land.\" His goal was to assign each family an acre of land, and to move away from the vertical movement of cities upwards in the form of skyscrapers.\nAlthough he was never given the opportunity to build his city, critics comment that the US’s suburban expansion in the 1940s satisfies some of Wright’s ideals. However, as this has evolved and people move further away from cities, there have been some unsustainable consequences of land fragmentation, including: disrupting wildlife and biodiversity, hydrologic systems, and energy flows, decreasing agricultural productivity, increasing cost of public service provision and greater investment in the construction of roads. Furthermore, research has shown that residents who belong to sprawling areas are likely to weigh more, do less exercise, and are more likely to have high blood pressure.\nAlthough valuable in providing insight into the development and shortfalls of the concept of smart cities, these attempts demonstrate that the sustainable urban development which these “utopian visionaries like Wright, Howard and Le Corbusier were so passionately trying to reach cannot materialize through simplistic sets of universal rules and standards, because they will always fall short of understanding the complexity of urban life.” “For as many commenters suggest, approaching sustainable urban development by using autocratic and top-down visionary schemes can produce nothing but the illusions of a universal panacea for urban problems.”\n\n\n== References ==",

His publications comprise research articles and eight books including Teamwork and Project Management, How to Model it: Problem Solving for the Computer Age and New Paradigms for College Teaching. He is the recipient of the University of Minnesota Distinguished Alumni Award (2006), an Honorary Doctorate from the Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (2014) along with the Chester F. Carlson Award (2001), the Distinguished Service Award (2006), and the Lifetime Achievement Award (2015), all from the American Society for Engineering Education.\nSmith is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Society for Engineering Education, where he was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2023. He served as the Guest Editor of a Special Issue of the Journal of Engineering Education, and as the Editor-in-Chief of Annals of Research on Engineering Education (AREE).\n\n\n== Education and early career ==\nSmith earned a BS in Metallurgical Engineering from Michigan Technological University in 1969, subsequently working at an engineering firm in Moab, Utah. He returned to Michigan Tech to complete an M.S. degree in 1972 and then moved to Minneapolis for a research position at the University of Minnesota.\n\n\n== Career ==\nSmith continued his academic career as an Assistant Professor at the University of Minnesota in 1980, later becoming Associate Professor in 1986 and Professor in 2004. In 2011 he served as Distinguished Engineering Education Innovation (E2I) Fellow at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. He retired from the University of Minnesota in 2011 and between 2006 and 2022 he served as Cooperative Learning Professor of Engineering Education at Purdue University's School of Engineering Education. Also since 2011, he has held positions as an Emeritus Professor of Civil, Environmental, and Geo-Engineering, Morse-Alumni Distinguished University Teaching Professor, and Faculty Member at the Technological Leadership Institute at the University of Minnesota. Additionally, in collaboration with Tony Starfield, Alan Wassyng, Sam Sharp, and others, he developed the civil engineering systems and \"How to model it\" courses for upper division and first-year students, respectively, which, alongside his work in cooperative learning and teamwork with David W. and Roger T. Johnson, led to the creation of the Civil Engineering Project Management course and the Management of Technology Project and Knowledge Management course.\nBetween 1999 and 2004, he had a split appointment with Michigan State University where he served as a Senior Consultant to the Provost for Faculty Development. At the University of Minnesota, he was the Co-coordinator of the Bush Faculty Development Program for Excellence and Diversity in Teaching from 1996 to 1997, Director of undergraduate studies in the Department of Civil Engineering from 1999 to 2004, and executive Co-director and researcher in the STEM Education Research Center from 2012 to 2018. He was inducted into the Michigan Technological University Academy for Engineering Education Leadership in 2018.\n\n\n== Research ==\nSmith has focused his research on mineral processing technology along with engineering education by facilitating faculty and graduate student professional growth, exploring the role of cooperation in learning and design, addressing problem formulation, modeling, and knowledge engineering, and managing projects and knowledge.\n\n\n=== Engineering education ===\nSmith's contributions to engineering education encompass work in cooperative learning and knowledge engineering applications. He published a paper in the Journal of Engineering Education, in 1981, introducing cooperative learning in engineering literature. During the early 1980s, he conducted some of the first randomized design empirical studies on cooperative learning in engineering classes. Subsequently, in the late 1980s, he transitioned from engineering research to education research, particularly focusing on cooperative learning and structured controversy, as his emphasis shifted towards teaching and research on project and knowledge management. This research addressed the critical needs of enhancing student learning, deepening understanding, and fostering collaborative skills. Beyond cooperative learning, his work included structured academic controversy, aimed at facilitating comprehensive understanding of complex issues through argument development and cooperative learning strategies.\nSmith published books on this topic, including Active Learning: Cooperation in the College Classroom with David W. Johnson and Roger T. Johnson, providing strategies for college faculty to implement cooperative learning. They also co-authored Cooperative learning: Increasing College Faculty Instructional Productivity, in which they delved into the basics of cooperative learning, and he discussed how cooperative learning changed college teaching in New Paradigms for College Teaching that he co-edited with William E. Campbell. Later, in 2000, he wrote Teamwork and Project Management, where he emphasized key skills for engineering success, including teamwork, problem-solving, and project management.\n\n\n=== Mineral processing technology ===\nSmith worked on the development of technically and environmentally sound mineral and waste processing technologies. He laid the groundwork for various technical innovations, including the carbochlorination technique used in the processing of lunar anorthite. Alongside colleagues, he confirmed graphite's ability, with or without catalysts, to selectively reduce iron oxide in synthetic ilmenite, observed through isothermal weight loss over time from 850 °C to 1200 °C under argon atmosphere. Additionally, he explored reduction roasting processes using various reductants and desulfurizers to convert sulfide minerals to metallic form without sulfur dioxide emissions, capturing sulfur as either calcium sulfide or sodium sulfide.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n2001 – Chester F. Carlson Award, American Society for Engineering Education\n2006 – Distinguished Alumni Award, University of Minnesota\n2006 – Distinguished Service Award, American Society for Engineering Education\n2014 – Honorary Doctorate, University of Technology Malaysia\n2015 – Lifetime Achievement Award, American Society for Engineering Education\n2023 – Hall of Fame, American Society for Engineering Education\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Selected books ===\nHow to model it: Problem Solving for the Computer Age (1990) ISBN 978-0808779704\nActive Learning: Cooperation in the College Classroom (1991) ISBN 978-0939603145\nCooperative learning: Increasing college faculty instructional productivity (1991) ISBN 978-1878380095\nNew paradigms for College Teaching (1997) ISBN 978-0939603268\nTeamwork and Project Management, 4th edition, (2014) ISBN 978-0073534909\n\n\n=== Selected articles ===\nJohnson, D.

After his rule, there is a period of fifteen years with no named ruler in inscriptions, hence implying a period of political disorder after his demise.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nNot much is known about Marthad'ilan Yu'nim, and there is only one inscription which confirms his reign. Based on inscriptions, it appears that he is the son of Lakhni'ah Yanuf, a son of the Himyarite ruler Sharhabil Yakkuf. There is an inscription which describes the construction of a synagogue by Marthad'ilan Yu'nim.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of rulers of Saba' and Himyar\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Arnaud Maurice Michel Prost (born November 6, 1992) is a French engineer, test pilot, professional diver, and astronaut reservist in the European Astronaut Corps.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nProst entered École Polytechnique in 2012, after completing two years of preparatory classes in physics and chemistry at Lycée Thiers in Marseille. He underwent his initial military training as a Polytechnician officer candidate (EOX) in the French Army, being assigned the rank of aspirant and trained at the 1st Parachute Hussar Regiment. He obtained his military parachutist badge and began a career in sport parachuting, completing over 200 freefall jumps. Upon graduation, he was promoted to second lieutenant. He conducted research at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, studying potential landing sites for the Mars 2020 Perseverance rover.\nFrom 2015 to 2016, he worked as a professional diver and engineer at the Space and Innovation Department of the COMEX in Marseille, as part of the Moonwalk project, focusing on underwater Extra Vehicular Activity (EVA) simulations and astronaut-robot cooperation in analog environments.\nIn 2016, he was appointed as an engineer in the French Armament Corps within the Direction générale de l'armement (DGA).\nIn 2017, he received his engineering degree from ISAE-SUPAERO (conception and operation of space systems) and a master's degree in astrophysics, space sciences, and planetology from the Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier University. He conducted research at the Skobeltsyn Institute of Nuclear Physics at Moscow State University and the Moscow Aviation Institute in Russia.\nFrom 2017 to 2020, he underwent pilot training in the French Air and Space Force and obtained his fighter pilot certificate.\n\n\n== Career ==\nSince 2020, Prost has been assigned to the DGA Flight Tests Expertise Center in Istres. He initially worked on developing new features for flight simulators, using artificial intelligence in air combat, and preparing for future test campaigns of the Future Combat Air System (FCAS).\nSince the summer of 2022, he has been a member of the integrated flight test team for the Rafale combat aircraft program under the command of AI Magalie Gibergues, consisting of military and civilian pilot and navigator engineers. He has worked on Rafale's human-machine interfaces.\nHe also holds a commercial pilot license (CPL) and is qualified as a pilot in the technical corps of the DGA.\n\n\n== Astronautics ==\nIn November 2022, Prost was selected for the European Astronaut Corps of the European Space Agency (ESA) as a reserve astronaut. As such, he remains in his current position but must spend four to five weeks per year at the Astronaut Centre for training, scientific experiments, or communication operations.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nArnaud Prost. esa.int",

        "content": "Marjorie Woolcock (1898–1965) was an Australian painter and sculptor.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBorn in Ivanhoe as one of three sisters, Marjorie grew up learning the piano and experimenting with art. She was schooled at Presbyterian Ladies College. She would later perform at a party for the school with her sister Violet, who would accompany her piano with violin.\nWoolcock would travel south from her home to sketch in Mordialloc, which is how she once had a chance encounter with the artist Margaret Baskerville. The plen air tradition of painting would inspire her later landscape work of Corryong, Victoria.\nHer art training was far from formal, with private lessons from Frederick George Reynolds, and George Bell. She would continue to acknowledge the influence Bell had on her skill throughout her career. He opened her joint exhibition with artist Jessie Mackintosh in 1946, and \nShe would first develop her formal technique at sculpting, attending life class at the Victorian Artists' Society, and sculpture at the Workingmen's College. It wasn't until later that she would study painting, with her style being heavily influenced by Arnold Shore.\nMarjorie would exhibit her art frequently with the Melbourne Society of Women Painters. In 1953 she would take part in a spring exhibition at the Victorian Artists' Society which featured women as more than half the exhibitors shown. She was joined at this show by fellow artists Esther Paterson and Ola Cohn. Woolcock would have success as a temporary art teacher at a girls' school in Brighton during the Second World War.\nIn later life she would travel to coastal areas of Victoria to paint, with her favourite places being Wilson's Promontory and Phillip Island.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nMelbourne Society of Women Painters, 1937\nMelbourne Society of Women Painters, Athenaeum Gallery, 1941\nVictorian Artists' Society, Eastern Hill, 1944\nMelbourne Society of Women Painters, Athenaeum Gallery, 1945\nMarjorie Woolcock and Jessie Mackintosh, Athenaeum Gallery, 1946\nBallet Society exhibition, 1948\nMelbourne Contemporary Artists, Eastern Hill, 1949\nMelbourne Society of Women Painters, Athenaeum Gallery, 1950\nMelbourne Society of Women Painters, Athenaeum Gallery, 1951\nVictorian Artists' Society, 1954\n\n\n== Works ==\nYachts at Dromana (1970), National Gallery of Victoria\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nMarjorie Woolcock [Australian art and artists file], State Library Victoria\nForm and flowers : Maidie McGowan, Anne Montgomery, Marjorie Woolcock, State Library Victoria\nMarjorie Woolcock interviewed by Barbara Blackman [sound recording], National Library of Australia\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Swainsona oroboides, commonly known as variable swainsona or kneed Darling pea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae and is endemic to Australia. It is a prostrate or ascending perennial plant with imparipinnate leaves with 3 to 7 narrowly elliptic leaflets and racemes of 3 to about 16 purple flowers.\n\n\n== Description ==\nSwainsona oroboides is a prostrate or ascending perennial plant, that typically grows to a height of up to 15 cm (5.9 in) and has many stems. The leaves are imparipinnate, mostly 20–70 mm (0.79–2.76 in) long with 3 to 7 narrowly elliptic leaflets, the side leaflets 10–24 mm (0.39–0.94 in) long and 2–5 mm (0.079–0.197 in) wide with stipules mostly 3–5 mm (0.12–0.20 in) long at the base of the petioles. The flowers are purple, arranged in racemes of 3 to about 16, 50–150 mm (2.0–5.9 in) long, on a peduncle 0.5–1.5 mm (0.020–0.059 in) long. The sepals are joined at the base to form a tube about 1.5 mm (0.059 in) long, with lobes a little to much longer than the tube. The standard petal is 7–10 mm (0.28–0.39 in) long and 8–12 mm (0.31–0.47 in) wide, the wings about 5–8 mm (0.20–0.31 in) long and the keel about 6–10 mm (0.24–0.39 in) long and 2.5–3.0 mm (0.098–0.118 in) deep. Flowering occurs from June to September, and the fruit is a broadly oblong pod about 10 mm (0.39 in) long on a stalk about 1 mm (0.039 in) long, with the remains of the strongly curved style 3–4 mm (0.12–0.16 in) long.\n\n\n== Taxonomy and naming ==\nSwainsona oroboides was first formally described in 1864 by George Bentham in Flora Australiensis from an unpublished description by Ferdinand von Mueller.

        "content": "Aniela Wolberg (14 October 1907 – 11 October 1937) was a Polish anarchist activist.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nWolberg was born into a wealthy Polish-Jewish family in the town of Częstochowa, Congress Poland. After completing her matura she moved to Cracow to study at the Jagiellonian University. It was here that she is believed to have first encountered anarchist ideas through the group of Bulgarian anarchists who were active at the university during this time. Wolberg was one of the founders of the underground newspaper Proletariat, which espoused anarchism at a time in which it was illegal to do so in Poland. In 1926 she became a member of the Anarchist Federation of Poland, before moving to Paris, France, in that year.\nWhilst in France Wolberg became involved with Walka, a Polish journal of anarchism, and made links with French and Spanish anarchists. It was while in Paris that Wolberg would become acquainted with the Chinese anarchist writer Ba Jin, who would go on to pen two short stories about her, Yalianna (1931) and Yalianna Woboerge (1933).\nAfter gaining an MSc in chemistry at the University of Montpellier, Wolberg found employment as a chemical engineer at an automotive factory in Paris. In 1927 she was a delegate, alongside Peter Arshinov, Nestor Makhno and Wu Kegang, at a committee convened by the Platformists to discuss the proposal to form an anarchist international. However, the meeting was broken up by the police with all the delegates in attendance being arrested. Wolberg was eventually deported from France back to Poland by the French police due to her political activities. \nIn 1932 Wolberg returned to Poland where she once again became active in the Anarchist Federation of Poland, becoming the editor in chief of their publication Walka Klas. In 1934 she was arrested by the Polish police but released without charge. Due to increasing state repression of the anarchist movement Wolberg directed her attention to science, becoming first assistant to the Professor of Bacteriology at the University of Warsaw. During this time she also worked as the private tutor of Bernard Konrad Świerczyński.\nAt the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War Wolberg may have travelled to Spain to organise with the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo, although historical accounts differ.\n\n\n=== Death ===\nOn 11 October 1937 Wolberg died unexpectedly during a medical operation. An obituary written by Pierre Besnard expressed deep mourning at her loss on behalf of the IWA–AIT.\n\n\n== References ==",

It was signed into law by President Bola Tinubu on 3 April 2024, marking a historic step towards ensuring sustainable higher education and functional skill development for Nigerian students and young people.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe NELFUND was created to address the shortcomings of the previous Student Loan Act of 2023, which faced challenges related to governance, management, loan purposes, eligibility criteria, application methods, repayment provisions, and loan recovery.\n\n\n== Objectives ==\nThe primary objective of NELFUND is to provide financial support to qualified Nigerians for tuition and other fees, charges, and upkeep during their studies in approved tertiary academic institutions and vocational and skills acquisition institutions within Nigeria.\n\n\n== Structure and Governance ==\nNELFUND operates as a body corporate with the power to sue and be sued, acquire, hold, and dispose of property for its functions. It is governed by a board of directors comprising representatives from relevant ministries, regulatory bodies, and participating agencies, including the Federal Ministries of Finance and Education, among others. The management operations are distinct from governance functions, with a management team led by a managing director, Akintunde Sawyerr responsible for the day-to-day operations.\n\n\n== References ==",

The galaxy IRAS 14348-1447NE, is in the early process of merging with IRAS 14348-1447SW, causing gravity to pull stars from both galaxies and forming tidal tails. As the interaction takes place, molecular gas is swirled about and creating emission that is responsible for the galaxies' ultraluminous appearance. \nAccording to SIMBAD, IRAS 14348-1447, is a Seyfert 1 galaxy and has an active galactic nucleus, indicating certain activity in its supermassive black hole has awakened, possibly turning it into a quasar. \n\n\n== References ==",

It bears an inscription regarding the dedication of a chapel at Deerhurst, Gloucestershire. The building, known as Odda's Chapel, still exists.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe limestone slab bears an 11th-century inscription in Latin relating to the dedication of a chapel built by Earl Odda.\nThere is evidence that the stone remained fixed to the chapel for centuries, but it became detached.\nIn 1675 Sir John Powell discovered the stone on his property at Deerhurst. He gave it to the University of Oxford.\n\n\n== Inscription ==\nThe Latin text is available at the Ashmolean Latin Inscriptions Project. \nThe inscription translates as follows:\n\n\"Earl Odda ordered this royal hall to be built and dedicated in honour of the Holy Trinity for the soul of his brother Ælfric, taken up from this place. Ealdred was the bishop who dedicated the building on the second day before Ides of April in the fourteenth year of the reign of Edward, king of the English\".\n\n\n== Access ==\n\"Odda's Stone\" is on display in the Ashmolean Museum. A replica has been placed in Odda's Chapel, the building to which the inscription refers.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTeacher's information sheet",

        "content": "The Capture of Carolusborg (1658) was a capture by the newly recruited Hendrik Carloff on the Swedish fort of Carolusborg on the Gold coast.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== Establishment of the Swedish Africa company ===\nIn 1649, the Swedish African company would be created by Louis De Geer along with his son Laurens and other nobles with the priviledge to trade slaves, gold and ivory with a letter of privilege issued by Queen Christina. The majority of the share in the company was held by De Geer while others such as Gustaf Horn, Johan Adeler Salvius, and Peter Julius Coyet held smaller shares.\n\n\n=== 1650 Expedition ===\nIn 1650, the two ships, Christina and Stockholms Slott were prepared for an expedition into Africa. Queen Christina excitedly attended the preperations. The ships were loaded with fabrics, copper, iron, tin,\nglass beads, knives, mirrors and brandy in order to conduct trade on the Gold coast. When the ships arrived, the Swedes set up a trading post and returned to Sweden with gold, ivory and sugar.\nAn aide to De Geer, a man named Hendrik Carloff, was appointed governor of the colony, and quickly began preparations to construct a fortress.\n\n\n=== Establishment of Carolusborg ===\nAfter he had arrived on the Gold coast on 22 April 1650, Carloff quickly began working to renew an agreement that had previously been signed by a certain Gabbesen with King Bredeva of the Fetu. After this, despite protests from other natives he began construction of a fort he named Carolusborg.\n\n\n=== Hendrik Carloff's defection ===\nIn 1656, a fued between Hendrik and the Swedish Africa company rose up, and he later resigned in anger and offered his services to the Danish king, Frederick III after the Dano-Swedish War had broken out earlier, he was assigned a mission to capture Carolusborg from the Swedes.\n\n\n== Capture ==\n\nOn December 1, after signing an agreement with the Danish king, Carloff began sailing to the Gold coast from Glückstadt harbor. When he arrived at Gemoree on January 25, he showed the Swedish colors which prompted the local Swedish agent to send a man to him. However, Carloff detained the man in order to extract information from him about Carolusborg. From the information he received, he quickly sailed over to the nearby Fort Axim controlled by the Dutch to ask for help in taking the fortress. The Dutch quickly agreed to help Carloff, giving him 4 boats, 50-60 Remidors, and 22 sailors. During a march towards Carolusborg in the night, Carloff sent messages to all neighbouring tribes requesting aid in expelling the Swedes. The most important person he contacted was the brother of the King of the Fetu, Hennique.  \nHe was able to persuade the African chief to promise aid to Carloff, and under the cover of night he let Carloff into Ogua where the chief called together the slaves under the Swedish African company and promised them riches if they offered their assistance. \nIn the next morning, a dense fog covered the surrounding area of Carolusborg, and after the company slaves had picked up their tools and entered the fortress they knocked down a Swedish sentry and announced that those who didn't show resistance would receive their pay as normal. They also opened the gate allowing for the Dutch sailors and around 100 natives entered. Since the Swedish garrison only consisted of 16 men, resistance was all but futile. The Swedish commander and governor, Johann Philipp von Krusenstjerna, was captured along with the captain of the Stockholms slott when Johann was forced to lure him into the fortress. The Dutch support troops were able to persuade the Dutch sailors who made up the majority of the crew on the Stockholms slott to come to them, and since the remaining Swedish crew were not numerous enough to sail away, the Dutch were able to capture it. \n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe Swedes in the garrison who chose to enter into service under Carloff were permitted to do so, and Carloff gathered them in the hall of the fort and forced them to swear an oath of allegiance to himself and make a written confirmation of it. The Danish flag would eventually be hoisted, and the Danish artillery signal would be fired.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Cajetan Francis Pinto (born Caetano Francisco Pinto; 29 January 1941 – 5 November 2017), known mononymously as Caiti, was an Indian make-up artist who worked on the Konkani stage.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nCaetano Francisco Pinto was born on 29 January 1941 in the island of Vanxim, Goa in a Goan Catholic family. Vanxim was part of Portuguese India during the time of the Portuguese Empire. Pinto's father, Manoel Vicente Pinto, hailed from the island of Chorão and served as an employee of a company. His mother, Maria Angelina de Souza, originated from Aldonã and fulfilled the role of a homemaker. As the third child in a family of four siblings, Pinto grew up alongside his elder brothers Ricardo (born in 1936 in Bombay) and Luis (born in 1934). An additional sibling, who remains unnamed, was born in 1939.  Following the completion of his education in Goa, Pinto ventured to Bombay, where he pursued specialized training in typewriter mechanics. Since his early years, Pinto fostered an affection for tiatr, a distinctive form of Goan musical theater.\nDuring his time in Bombay, he made a concerted effort to attend tiatr performances, seizing every available opportunity to immerse himself in this cultural tradition. Eager to explore the intricacies of the art form, he frequently visited the green room, where he keenly observed the meticulous application of makeup on the actors. Driven by his passion and captivated by the transformative power of makeup, Pinto honed his skills as a tiatr make-up artist. His expertise allowed him to enhance the appearances of several tiatrists, ensuring that their physical portrayals aligned with their respective characters on the theatrical stage.\n\n\n== Career ==\nDuring the year 1961, Pinto commenced his collaboration with Valente Mascarenhas (1925–1999), a make-up artist who later transitioned into becoming a Konkani actor. Their partnership primarily revolved around providing makeup assistance to tiatrists (performers in a distinctive Goan musical theater form) based in Bombay (now known as Mumbai). A turn of events occurred when Valente was unable to fulfill his obligations for a tiatr performance, leading Konkani comedian Anthony Mendes to request Pinto's support as a replacement. This marked the emergence of Pinto as a make-up artist in his own right. Over the course of his career, Pinto extended his makeup services to a wide array of Konkani tiatrists from earlier generations. Known figures within the Konkani tiatr realm, including C. Alvares, M. Boyer, Remmie Colaço, Prem Kumar, Alfred Rose, Bab Peter, Chris Perry, Kid Boxer, and Robin Vaz, consistently sought Pinto's expertise in various locations such as Goa, Bombay, and beyond. Pinto's makeup artistry left a mark on several popular tiatrs, including Duddvanchem Sukh (Happiness of Money), Kednam Udetolo Tho Dis (When Will That Day Come?), and Vavraddi (Labourer).\nOn 8 February 2014, Pinto assumed the role of makeup artist for a Goan tiatr organized by the Vasai Konkani Welfare Association (VKWA). The theatrical production, written and directed by Tony Martins, took place at the YMCA Hall in Manickpur, Vasai, Maharashtra. Pinto's expertise extended beyond makeup application, as he also performed hairstyling for the tiatr artists. His contributions to the field of tiatr were further acknowledged when he shared his insights and experiences in Dr. Kyoko Matsukawa's scholarly article titled \"Tiatr's Bombay Days,\" which was published on Sahapedia in 2016. Pinto stood alongside professionals such as Valente Mascarenhas, Camilo Pinto of Aldona, Xavier Mascarenhas of Vasco da Gama, Goa, Premanand Pole, Zeferin Silveira from Calangute, Jocky de Curtorim, Mary Vaz, and C. D'Silva as one of the select few make-up artists on the Konkani stage during the 20th century.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nAfter finishing his training as a typewriter mechanic, Pinto settled in Dhobitalao, Bombay. The 2012 Directory of Tiatr Artistes mentioned that he lived at the Grand Club of Vanxim in Dhobitalao. Pinto worked as a typewriter mechanic by trade but found his true passion in being a tiatr make-up artist. Pinto received a monthly financial grant of ₹2,500 (equivalent to ₹5,600 or US$70 in 2023) from the Government of Goa under the Kala Samman Scheme in recognition of his contributions to the field of art and culture. The scheme aimed to support senior artists facing financial difficulties. Pinto was one of the artists chosen for this honor in the period of 2010–11, starting from September 2010. On 5 November 2017, Pinto died in Mumbai, Maharashtra, at the age of 76.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nPinto received several awards recognizing his contributions to the art form. In 2009, the Tiatr Academy of Goa honored him with the \"Lifetime Contribution Award\". Furthermore, on 17 November 2016, he was celebrated by the 125th Anniversary of Tiatr Celebrations Committee in Mumbai for his dedication to tiatr. Pinto was also acknowledged with the Kala Gaurav Puraskar for the year 2016–2017 specifically for his work in tiatr make-up.\n\n\n== References ==",

He made his first Welsh trials in 1949 while with St Luke's.\nA speedy winger, Maddocks spent most of his career with Neath. He was a regular try-scorer and had six in a single match against Ebbw Vale as captain in the 1956–57 season, which he finished with 27 tries. In the 1957 Five Nations, Maddocks won his solitary Wales cap against England at Cardiff Arms Park and conceded a first-half penalty when he was caught off-side, with Fenwick Allison's successful kick proving to be the only score of the match.\nMaddocks was an English teacher at St Boniface's School in Plymouth, Devon.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Wales national rugby union players\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKeith Maddocks at ESPNscrum",

She won the Oka Sho in 2024.\nShe was named after Stellenbosch, a town in South Africa.\n\n\n== Racing career ==\n\n\n=== Before debut ===\nStellenbosch was born at Northern Farm, located in Abira, Hokkaido. She is currently owned by Shadai Group Owners, for about 5 million yen per share, with Katsumi Yoshida as their representative. She was sent into training with Sakae Kunieda.\n\n\n=== 2023: two-year-old season ===\nStellenbosch debuted at the Sapporo Racecourse on July 23, 2023, in a two-year-old newcomer race on turf at the distance of 1,800 meters, ridden by Takeshi Yokoyama. Although she was the second favored horse, she won brilliantly by one and a half horse length. Ten weeks later, she raced in a 1-win class race, Saffron Sho. She settled in from behind and then moved up in the final straight but lost by a nose to Spring Nova. Seven weeks later, she raced in another 1-win class race, Akamatsu Sho, with Tom Marquand on her saddle. She settled in midfield this time, and in the final straight, she overtook Teleos Sarah to win by three quarters of a horse length.\nFor the last race of her two-year-old season, she was signed-up for the Hanshin Juvenile Fillies held at Hanshin Racecourse on December 10. This was her first graded stakes race, the first being a grade one. She was favored 5th in the race with Christophe Lemaire on her saddle. Settling in midfield from the start, she traveled well into the final straight but lost by a neck to Ascoli Piceno, finishing second place.\n\n\n=== 2024: three-year-old season ===\nStellenbosch entered straight to Oka Sho, the first leg of the Japanese Fillies' Triple Crown. With João Moreira on her saddle, she was the second most favored horse to win the race. She settled in midfield from the start, and in the final straight, she moved out ahead of Ascoli Piceno, winning the race by three quarters of a horse length.\n\n\n== Racing statistics ==\nBelow data is based on data available on JBIS Search, and NetKeiba.\n\n\n== Pedigree ==\n\nShe is related to 2023 Hopeful Stakes winner, Regaleira, through Land's Edge.\nLand's Edge's half brother is Deep Impact and Black Tide.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Penang Hill cable car is a proposed gondola lift in George Town, the capital city of the Malaysian state of Penang. The planned 2.73 km (1.70 mi) line will connect the Penang Botanic Gardens to the peak of Penang Hill and is intended to complement the existing Penang Hill Railway. The cable car line is projected to serve a capacity of 1,000 passengers per hour per direction. Construction of the line is scheduled to commence in the second quarter of 2024 and will be completed by 2027.\n\n\n== History ==\nA cable car system complementing the existing Penang Hill Railway was first announced by then Malaysian Minister of Finance Lim Guan Eng in 2019. The funicular railway had recorded a ridership of 1.74 million throughout 2018 and Penang officials were seeking an alternative mode of transportation to reduce the overdependence on the railway. The federal government allocated RM100 million for the cable car project in the 2020 budget, with additional costs to be borne by the Penang state government. The Penang Rifle Club, situated adjacent to the Penang Botanic Gardens, was selected as the ground station over other areas such as Teluk Bahang.\nA political crisis in 2020 led to the removal of the Pakatan Harapan-led federal government by the right-wing Perikatan Nasional. As a result, federal allocations promised for the cable car project were cancelled. Despite this, in 2021, the state's Chief Minister Chow Kon Yeow announced a request for proposal for the project, citing \"tremendous\" public support. The project was to be awarded through a public–private partnership framework, with the selected developer given a 30-year concession to design, finance, build, operate and transfer the system. Six proposals were received by the Penang Hill Corporation (PHC) and in 2022, Malaysian firm Hartasuma Sdn Bhd was awarded the project.\nAs the cable car project is to be undertaken on slopes between 25 and 35 degrees, federal government oversight was required, involving traffic impact (TIA) and environmental impact (EIA) assessments. To build and operate cable car systems at ecologically sensitive areas, the PHC sought technical expertise from Switzerland and Austria; Penang Hill had been inscribed as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 2021. In 2023, Chief Minister Chow announced that the cable car infrastructure would be provided by Doppelmayr/Garaventa Group.\nThe cable car project received approval from federal government environmental regulators in 2024. Construction is expected to begin in May or June 2024, and is estimated to be completed in two to three years.\n\n\n== Design ==\nThe cable car system is designed to cater to a capacity of 1,000 passengers per hour per direction, comprising 50 eight-seater carriages that travel at a speed of 6 m/s (20 ft/s). Citing extensive experience in ropeway engineering within UNESCO-designated sites, Doppelmayr/Garaventa Group has been selected to provide the cable car infrastructure.\nThe project will include the construction of 15 towers – five in the forests, and the other 10 near the upper and ground stations. The foundations are to be built using the hand-dug caisson method to reduce on-site clearing. The PHC stated that only 50 trees would be affected by the construction, primarily African tulip, royal palm and oil palm surrounding the lower end of the route.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAwana Skyway\nGenting Skyway\nLangkawi Cable Car\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Carole Vincent (1939 – May 2019) was an English painter, sculptor and teacher. She created works by commission for public spaces, and is known for her sculptures in concrete, particularly \"The Armada Dial\" in Plymouth.\n\n\n== Life ==\n\nVincent studied at Bath Academy of Art, and Chelsea College of Physical Education, and from age 21 she lived in Cornwall. She taught for many years at Sir James Smith's School in Camelford. Her early work was in painting, and she later moved to sculpture.\nFrom 1971 she was self-employed, and founded at her home in Boscastle \"Half Acre\", an artists' studio, garden and teaching location. She experimented with natural colour and texture in concrete for sculpture; in 2007 she became the first winner of the British Precast \"Creativity in Concrete\" award.\nShe was also a keen gardener, and her Blue Circle garden at Half Acre, which contains her sculptures, won a bronze medal at the Chelsea Flower Show in 2001.\n\n\n== Works ==\n\nVincent's works include the following:\n\"The Armada Dial\", a large sundial and fountain in Armada Way, Plymouth, was unveiled by Queen Elizabeth II on 22 July 1988. It was commissioned by Plymouth City Council to mark the \"Armada 400\" celebrations in the city. It is made of cast concrete with terrazzo, and stainless steel, and is 8.25 metres (27.1 ft) high. There are 24 granite plinths around the outside marked with numbers and with instructions for reading the sundial.\nFour copies of \"The Year of the Pedestrian\" were commissioned by Devon County Council, to be placed in Barnstaple, Torbay, Plymouth and Exeter. They are made of polished concrete, and were unveiled in 1989.\n\"The Bude Light\", designed by Vincent and Anthony Fanshawe, was commissioned by Bude-Stratton Town Council. It was unveiled in 2000 in Ergue Gaberic Way, Bude, Cornwall to celebrate the millennium, and to celebrate the invention of the Bude-Light in 1830 by Sir Goldsworthy Gurney.It is a slender conical structure made of coloured concrete, with a granite base; fibre optic lights on the cone create star constellations.\nThere are two sculptures by Vincent in St Helier, Jersey: \"Les jongleurs\" (1996) in Snow Hill and \"La citadelle\" (2004) in Ordnance Yard. They are owned by the Jersey Public Sculpture Trust, whose tenth anniversary was celebrated by \"La citadelle\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Carole Vincent at Wikimedia Commons\nHalf Acre Studios website",

        "content": "Balyktykol (Kazakh: Балықтыкөл; Russian: Балыктыколь) is a lake in Shortandy District, Akmola Region, Kazakhstan.\nThe lake is located 55 km (34 mi) to the west of Shortandy, the district capital.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nBalyktykol is an oval lake located on a slightly hilly plain roughly sloping to the north. Three intermittent watercourses flow into the lake from the west, southwest and the southeast. Approximately every three years —provided there is sufficient precipitation— Balyktykol becomes exorheic and drains through a roughly 12 m (39 ft) wide riverbed at the northern end. Its waters reach the left bank of the Kalkutan river, that flows 6.5 km (4.0 mi) to the north.\nThe lake lies about 30 km (19 mi) to the northeast of the Ishim, of which the Kalkutan is a tributary. The water of Balyktykol is fresh. The lake freezes in November and thaws by April. The ice thickness reaches between 1.2 m (3 ft 11 in) and 1.3 m (4 ft 3 in) in severe winters, but usually it is 0.8 m (2 ft 7 in) to 1 m (3 ft 3 in) thick in average winters.\n\n\n== Flora and fauna ==\nAbout two thirds of the catchment area of the lake are agricultural fields, the remaining area has steppe vegetation.\nThere is a continuous 200 m (660 ft) to 300 m (980 ft) wide strip  along the lakeshore in which reeds predominate. Further offshore there are submerged aquatic plants covering about 20% of the lake surface. There are fish living in the lake.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of lakes of Kazakhstan\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Balyktykol (Shortandy District) at Wikimedia Commons\nОзера и реки Казахстана (in Russian)",

It is located 500 million light-years away from the solar system and has a diameter of 290,000 light-years, making it slightly more massive compared to the Milky Way. The galaxy is moving away at a speed of 11,162 kilometers per second. \nUGC 4457 is interacting with the compact galaxy, PGC 23937. Together, they form Arp 58 and are classified under spiral galaxies that have small companions with high surface brightness. UGC 4457 shows disturbed spiral arms, indicating signs of velocity disturbance levels and regions of scattered ionized gas, typically normal for interacting galaxies. A faint spiral bridge can be seen thus representing the remains of an older mode of spiral waves. \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Idrottsföreningen Lödde is a Swedish association football club from Löddeköpinge.\nThe club was founded in 1942 after the association was able to buy land for a sports field. The sports field was owned by the municipality from 1970, who wanted to convert it into housing. In 2004 the conversion took place as IF Lödde moved to a newly constructed sports field near the Tolvåker School.\nThe men's football team plays in the Division 2, the fifth tier of Swedish football. The team won promotion from Division 3 in 2023, coached by Daniel Lindgren. When Lödde participated in the 2020–21 Svenska Cupen, there were COVID-19 restrictions on league play, and the restriction on Lödde playing had to be lifted specifically for them to play the cup match.\nThe women's team plays in Division 3.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nOfficial site\nSvenskfotboll.se",

        "content": "Beverly Joubert (born 12 January 1957, Johannesburg) is a South African-born wildlife photographer, filmmaker, conservationist and National Geographic explorer-in-residence.\nShe has been documenting, researching and exploring Africa for over 40 years with her husband, Dereck Joubert. Together, they have made over 40 films for National Geographic, with a strong focus on iconic species like big cats and elephants. Beverly Joubert's wildlife and landscape photographs have been showcased in a dozen or more National Geographic magazine features, international exhibitions, books and articles.\nJoubert is a co-founder of Great Plains Conservation. With lodges and tented camps in Kenya, Botswana and Zimbabwe, the company returns large tracts of land to nature through conservation tourism and community upliftment programs.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nJoubert was born in Johannesburg, South Africa. She met her husband, Dereck, in high school and the couple married in 1983. They have lived and worked in Botswana for over three decades.\nIn March 2017, the Jouberts survived a near-fatal Cape buffalo attack at their camp in Botswana's Okavango Delta.\n\n\n== Film career ==\nJoubert and her husband have co-produced over 40 films for National Geographic. During their shoots in remote locations across Africa, she focuses on stills photography and sound recording while her husband operates the camera.\nOver the years, the Jouberts’ discoveries in the field have challenged conventional wisdom about some of Africa's top predators. In 1992, the couple completed the documentary that won them international acclaim. It is estimated that Eternal Enemies: Lions and Hyenas has been viewed by more than a billion viewers in 127 countries.\nThe Jouberts’ films have received significant accolades including Emmys, a Peabody Award and Wildscreen Panda Awards. Their Emmy-winning 2006 film Eye of the Leopard follows the life of a single female leopard from infancy to maturity.  \nIn 2014, the couple received the prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award at the South African Film and Television Awards.\n\n\n== Photography ==\nA keen photographer from a young age, Joubert went on to specialise in African wildlife and landscape photography. Her images have appeared in numerous international exhibitions, National Geographic magazine features, books that she has coauthored with her husband, and thousands of articles.\nOne of her lion photographs taken in Botswana's Okavango Delta was selected for inclusion in the ‘National Geographic: 50 Greatest Wildlife Photographs’ exhibit at the National Museum of Wildlife Art in Jackson, Wyoming in 2022.\n\n\n== Conservation work ==\nThe Jouberts’ passion for conservation led them to establish Great Plains Conservation in 2006. The conservation and tourism organisation operates safari camps in Botswana, Kenya and Zimbabwe, and combines these with conservation initiatives and community projects.\nThe company's charity arm, Great Plains Foundation, focuses on preserving and protecting landscapes, wildlife and the communities that rely on them.\nIn 2009, the Jouberts founded the Big Cats Initiative with National Geographic, a long-term effort to halt the decline of big cats in the wild and protect the ecosystems they inhabit. This program has now transitioned to the Great Plains Big Cats Initiative, under the Jouberts’ leadership.\nTogether with her husband, Joubert is also co-founder of Rhinos Without Borders, an initiative that has moved 87 rhinos from high poaching areas to safety.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Jouberts established Project Ranger, an emergency intervention to secure the jobs of rangers and front-line conservationists across Africa.\n\n\n== References ==",

It is located 417 million light-years away from the solar system and was found by Stephane Javelle on 22nd of June, the same day he discovered IC 4461, a spiral galaxy. It is gravitationally interacting with IC 4461 and possibly might merge with the latter in the future. Both galaxies form Arp 95, which they are classified under galaxies that have elliptical companions. Sometimes the galaxy is confused with IC 4461. \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Głębokie Lake is a lake in the Lubusz Voivodeship, in the Międzyrzecz County, in the Gmina Międzyrzecz, approximately 5 km north of Międzyrzecz, located in the area of the Lubusz Lakeland and within the drainage basin of the Obra river. It is the largest non-drainage lake in the Lubusz Voivodeship.\n\n\n== Location and description ==\nGłębokie Lake is located in the western part of the Zbąszyń Ridge. The shores of the lake are mainly covered with coniferous forests. The northern and southern shores are marshy and boggy, while the higher eastern shore is occupied by recreational development. The shoreline of the body of water is poorly developed. The lake bottom is not very diverse, with very high water transparency, which promotes the growth of underwater vegetation. Głębokie has no permanent inflows or outflows. Next to the southern shore of the lake, there is the Głębokie Międzyrzeckie train station (railway line No. 367 connecting Zbąszynek and Gorzów Wielkopolski). To the east, at a short distance from the lake, runs the Expressway S3.\n\n\n== Hydronymics ==\nThe name of the lake appears in sources in 1321 as stagnum Glambek, and then as Glabok (1390), Glamboke (1418), Glembuch-see (1929), and Tiefer See (1934). On 17 September 1949, the name Głębokie (English: Deep) was introduced. Currently, the national register of geographic names also lists Głębokie as the name of the lake, while also providing the alternative name Jezioro Głębokie (English: Deep Lake).\n\n\n== Morphometrics ==\nAccording to data from the Inland Fisheries Institute, the surface area of the lake water mirror is 124.9 hectares (309 acres), while A. Choiński, through mapping on 1:50,000 scale maps, determined the size of the lake to be 112.5 hectares (278 acres). The uniform part of the lake's surface waters has an area of ​​115 hectares (280 acres).\nThe average depth of the water reservoir is 9.2 metres (30 ft), and the maximum depth is 25.3 metres (83 ft). The volume of the lake is 11,530.4 cubic metres (407,190 cu ft). The maximum length of the lake is 2,280 metres (7,480 ft), and the width is 825 metres (2,707 ft). The length of the shoreline is 5,800 metres (19,000 ft).\nAccording to the Atlas of Polish Lakes (ed. J. Jańczak, 1996), the water level is at an altitude of 50.4 metres (165 ft) above sea level, while according to the digital terrain model provided by Geoportal, the water level is at an altitude of 49.3 metres (162 ft) above sea level.\nAccording to the Map of the Hydrographic Division of Poland, the lake is located in the drainage basin of the sixth level – the drainage basin of the non-drainage Głębokie Lake. The Map of the Hydrographic Division of Poland identifier is 1878930. The direct drainage basin of the lake is small and covers an area of ​​5.7 square kilometres (2.2 sq mi).\n\n\n== Development ==\nIn the water management system, the lake forms a uniform part of waters with the code PLLW10378. The Polish Angling Association District in Gorzów Wielkopolski manages the fishery on the lake. The lake is inhabited by common bream (Abramis brama), vendace (Coregonus albula), common whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus), northern pike (Esox lucius), roach (Rutilus rutilus), tench (Tinca tinca), European perch (Perca fluviatilis), European eel (Anguilla anguilla), and common rudd (Scardinius erythrophthalmus).\nThe lake also serves recreational purposes, with a large recreation complex located on the eastern shore. Several centers offer bathing areas with piers, camping cabins, water sports equipment rental, and a forest camping area. The recreational buildings occupy about 15% of the lake's shoreline.\n\n\n== Water purity and environmental protection ==\nBased on research conducted in 1993 and 1999, the water of Głębokie Lake was classified as Class II purity. Studies conducted until 2013 indicated that the lake is one of the cleanest in the Lubusz Lakeland region. The values of biogenic indicators and chlorophyll a concentrations did not exceed the permissible values set for Class I. Both good chemical and biological conditions were observed, and there were no phytoplankton blooms in the lake. The high water transparency makes it attractive for tourism and recreation. Research from 2018 classified the lake's water quality as Class I, with a transparency of 5.7 metres (19 ft).\nThe latest studies from 2021 classified the water quality of the lake as Class II, with the condition of macrozoobenthos being the determining factor for this classification, while the condition of phytoplankton, macrophytes, ichthyofauna, and phytobenthos was assessed as very good. The water transparency of the lake was determined to be 4.8 metres (16 ft). Głębokie Lake, in terms of chlorophyll a content, was the cleanest of all lakes surveyed in the country that year. Chemically, the lake water was classified below a good condition due to exceeding Class I values for mercury compounds, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, and heptachlor.\nGłębokie Lake is moderately susceptible to anthropogenic influences and has been classified as Class II in terms of susceptibility to degradation. Most indicators positively affect the lake's resistance to degradation, especially its high average depth, location among forests, minimal percentage of water exchange throughout the year, and small area of direct catchment. The only issues are the excessive length of the shoreline compared to the lake's volume and low thermal stratification of its waters.\nThe lake is not covered by any form of nature protection.\n\n\n=== Drying up of the lake ===\n\nSince the beginning of the 21st century, the water level in the lake has decreased by approximately 120 centimetres (47 in). The causes of this phenomenon are unknown; according to preliminary expert opinions, the inflowing tributaries supplying the lake have dried up, and there has likely been seepage of water towards the west. There is also a hypothesis that deep wells belonging to recreational centers located along the shores of Głębokie Lake are responsible for lowering the water level. The least mentioned hypothesis is the interruption of water flow from the main catchment area of the lake due to the construction of the Expressway S3 (European route E65) located near the eastern shore of the lake.\nAs remedial measures, it is proposed to bring water to the lake from the Obra river, either through a pumping system or through the surrounding wetlands. An alternative solution would be to bring water from deep wells by excavating the lake and allowing the water to slowly seep into it, which would require aeration due to low oxygen saturation.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe water body was mentioned as early as 1390 when Wincenty of Chycina and his sons sold the villages of Kalsko and Rojewo along with five nearby lakes to the abbot and Cistercians in Zemsko for 300 grzywnas.\nGłębokie Lake, along with the neighboring Lake Grążyk and the surrounding forests, were mentioned on 16 April 1485, in a privilege granted to Międzyrzecz by King Casimir IV Jagiellon. Thanks to this, the residents of the city could in accordance with ancient custom, fish in the lakes called Strzeleckie (now Głębokie) and Linye (Grążyk) with the consent of leasing, similarly to the river with nets. Both lakes had similar surfaces and were rich in fish. The shallower Grążyk abounded in tench, carp, and roach. In the neighboring Głębokie, the most valuable fish was the vendace.\nIn the 18th century, a long-standing dispute over both lakes and the surrounding forests ensued between Międzyrzecz and the abbot of the Cistercian monastery in Bledzew. The monastery had long owned forests and fields near the nearby Kalsko and asserted claims to the urban properties. When the abbot demanded to see the royal privilege, the city council on 10 October 1647, sent a delegation with the document to Bledzew. The monks received the city councilors very hospitably and organized a feast. When the intoxicated councilors fell asleep, the royal privilege was stolen from them, and they had to return home empty-handed. For several decades, Międzyrzecz lost the lakes and surrounding forests, and the residents complained for a long time that the lords had drunk away the forest with the lakes.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nKamińska, Krystyna, ed.

It is scheduled to leave from Turkey in April 2024 and bring aid to the Gaza Strip amidst the Israel–Hamas war and Gaza Strip famine. In mid-April, activists from the United States traveled to Turkey with plans to join the flotilla.\nThe flotilla is overseen by İHH, a conservative Turkish GNGO. Fehmi Bülent Yıldırım, the president of IHH, stated in a press briefing that the convoy, with ships from Turkey, Lebanon, and Libya, plans to initially dock at the Egyptian city of Arish before heading to Rafah. Ynet reports that the initiative has received the green light from Turkish authorities, with Turkey's intelligence chief involved in its arrangement.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGaza flotilla raid\n\n\n== References ==",

His wife and his best friend are wondering if he is going crazy, but the damage done to the Jack's body is quite real.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nJoey Collins as Jack\nEna O'Rourke as Carol\nJesse Milliner as Billy\nMerryRose Howley as Suzy\nKelly Schwartz as Tricia\n\n\n== Reception ==\nMontiLee Stormer of Movie Reelist stated, \"There is a Monster is as simple a film as you can get. There is no flashy CGI and the effects are basic and practical. This isn’t a bad thing, as it allows the story and characters to be the focus. The downside to is when folks are expecting a horror movie, there should be more than a few jump scares and shadowy figures in corners. The low-budget feel of There is a Monster didn’t work against it, but you might want to dial down expectations.\" Nathaniel Muir of AIPT Comics commented, \"Ultimately, There Is a Monster tries to do more than is necessary. A revelation at the end tries to make sense of everything, but it feels too contrived. As a whole, the movie is never actively bad, but it ends up taking itself too seriously. This makes sense considering its inspiration, but it also takes away from what is otherwise a run of the mill thriller.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThere is a Monster at IMDb",

Major artists such as Los Darts, José Luis Rodríguez, Conexión, Azucar, Escena, Cacao Y Leche, Oscar D'León, Rudy Marquez and David Beigbeder recorded for the label. It was also a distributor for mainstream Western artists.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe label was founded and owned by Wilhelm Ricken who also presided over the Los Ruices, La Discoteca as well as the Cordica labels; Discomoda and Antor.\nThe label was responsible for José Luis's LP going to no. 1 in various South American countries as well as their Top Five sales lists. It even made an impression in some US territories.\nIn his Latin Notas section column in the March 22, 1986, issue of Billboard, Enrique Fernandez called the label powerful and independent.\nEssex entertainment Inc. who became the owners of the  Buddah Records, Inc. and Kama Sutra Records, Inc. catalogues published a notice in the November 9, 1991, issue of Billboard which included Discos Top Hits as one of their legitimate foreign licensees.\nWilhelm Ricken's key Lieutenant Carlos Vidal was the representative for Top Hits. In the United States West Coast, Pedro Mares was the label's chief of promotion.\n\n\n== History ==\nMusic trade magazine Record World wrote in their  July 3, 1971 issue that Top Hits had a group with potential to \"make it all over\". The group fronted by lead singer Edgar Castro was called Group C. That same year, Los Cazadores released their album The Hunters on Top Hits TH-1024. This was the first of six albums for the label.\nIn 1973, Los Darts had their Greatest Hits album issued on Top Hits THS 1043. Also the same year, Grupo Escena released their single, \"Altamira\" bw \"Triste\" which was produced by Rudy Márquez. It was released on Top Hits  H-3236. A young Pecos Kanvas was a member of the group for some time. Escena would have an influence on a Dutch Moluccan band, Massada.\nThe single, \"Prueba de amor\" by Top Hits artist Tania was on no. 2 in the New York section of the Latin American Hit Parade chart for the week of December 21, 1974.\nAs of June 1978, artists with the label included Chery Jimiez, Oscar D'León, Tommy Olivencia, José Luis, Paquito Guzmán, Rudy Máquez, Henry Salvat, Três Tristes Tigres and Luis Enrique (Luis Enrique Hernández).\nAs of 1979, artists with the label included Mirla, Wladimir Y Su Constelacion, Emir Boscán, Luis Conny, la Banda, Los Cazadores, Delia, La Grande, Tania,  La Critica, Tania, Grupo Acuario, Eddy Castro, Fernando Touzent, Luis Enríque, Tabaco Y Sus Metales, Trino Mora, Oscar D'León, José Luis Rodríguez, Henry Salvat, Los Tigres, Los Reales Brass, Noel Petro, Willie Salcedo, and Raquel. \nVenezuelan group Los Cañoneros signed with the label after leaving their previous label that was owned by a German, Ernesto Aue.

        "content": "The 1904 Oslo earthquake occurred on 23 October at 11:27 CET, in Oslo, Norway. The earthquake was the second strongest earthquake in Norway until 2008 Skåne County earthquake.\n\n\n== Impact ==\n\nThe earthquake was felt in the southern part of the Oslofjord, in the area between Moss, Halden, and Tønsberg, but was also very noticeable in Oslo, where it caused damage to Johannes Church, among other places.\nThe earthquake possibly had its epicenter in the Skagerrak, about one and a half miles from both Færder in Vestfold, Akerøya in Østfold, and Nordkoster in Strömstad. It could be felt as far away as Namsos, Pomerania (in present-day Poland), the Baltics, and Helsinki. The earthquake occurred during a church service, causing panic in many churches around the Oslofjord, in Sweden, and in Aalborg, Denmark, but no one died.\nJohannes Church in Oslo, which stood on a weak foundation and already had cracks before the earthquake occurred, was so heavily damaged by the tremor that it was closed and later demolished. Idd Church near Halden was also severely damaged, but it could be repaired. In Oslo, Olaf Norli's bookstore on Universitetsgata was damaged.\nThe earthquake is the strongest to have struck Sweden in modern times. The seismograph in Uppsala, installed earlier that year as the first in Scandinavia, was shaken so violently that the pendulum jumped out of its socket, rendering the seismograph unable to measure the quake. However, it was recorded by seismographs in Dorpat (Tartu), Leipzig, Göttingen, Hamburg, and Edinburgh, among others. Many chimneys collapsed, minor landslides were triggered, and tsunamis occurred both on the Swedish west coast and in Lake Vänern and other lakes. In two locations, unsecured railway wagons were set in motion, though they did not cause any accidents.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of earthquakes in 1904\nGeology of Norway\n2008 Skåne County earthquake\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Peter Tontonoz is a physician-scientist and academic. He is the Frances and Albert Piansky Endowed Chair and Distinguished Professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and of Biological Chemistry at the University of California, Los Angeles.\nTontonoz's laboratory focuses on studying regulatory pathways involved in cholesterol, fatty acid, and phospholipid metabolism, contributing to uncovering fundamental mechanisms through which animals maintain cellular and whole-body lipid homeostasis. His group has clarified pathways governing lipid uptake, transport, and efflux, demonstrating their impact on the function of immune cells and metabolic tissues in both physiological and pathological conditions. His h-index is 113, with over 240 research articles published and cited over 68,000 times.\nTontonoz is a member of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), the National Academy of Medicine (NAM), the American Society for Clinical Investigation (ASCI), and the Association of American Physicians (AAP). He is the recipient of national awards such as the Stanley J. Korsmeyer Award from the ASCI, the ATVB Distinguished Achievement Award and Jeffrey Hoeg Award from the American Heart Association (AHA), as well as the Richard Weitzman Award and Gerald D. Aurbach Award from The Endocrine Society.\nTontonoz served as the President of the ASCI from 2013 to 2014.\n\n\n== Education and early career ==\nTontonoz earned his BA from Wesleyan University and his MD and PhD from Harvard Medical School's MSTP program. He completed his clinical pathology residency at the University of California, San Diego, and a postdoctoral fellowship at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. During his time in Bruce M. Spiegelman's lab from 1990 to 1996, he discovered peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR)-γ as the key regulator of adipocyte differentiation. Following this, from 1996 to 1999, his postdoctoral work with Ronald M. Evans furthered his research in lipid signaling, connecting nuclear receptor pathways to macrophage biology and atherosclerosis.\n\n\n== Career ==\nTontonoz joined UCLA's faculty in 1999 as an assistant professor in the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, concurrently assuming the role of Investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in 2000, where he served until 2017. He was promoted to associate professor in 2002, then to Professor in 2006, and has held the position of Distinguished Professor in the Departments of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, as well as Biological Chemistry, since 2021. In addition, he has been holding an appointment as a Frances and Albert Piansky Chair in Anatomy at UCLA.\n\n\n== Research ==\nTontonoz's work has focused on the regulation of cellular and systemic lipid metabolism. His research has defined new transcriptional pathways for lipid homeostasis, uncovered mechanisms of cholesterol movement in health and disease, and revealed connections between lipid metabolism, inflammation, and immunity.\nTontonoz's early work on lipid-activated nuclear receptors PPAR and LXR established an understanding of the transcriptional regulation of metabolic gene networks: dietary lipids like fatty acids and sterols can directly control gene expression by binding to nuclear transcription factors. His work helped in defining LXR nuclear receptors as master regulators of the macrophage cholesterol efflux pathway. His group moved on to analyze a range of LXR target genes that collaborate systematically to facilitate cellular cholesterol removal, and to demonstrate the significance of these pathways for metabolic homeostasis in vivo.\nTontonoz's work also stimulated interest in LXRs as potential targets for cardiovascular disease treatment. His team was the first to establish a connection between LXR function and the development of atherosclerosis, as well as to demonstrate that synthetic LXR ligands inhibit atherogenesis in mice. In 2003, he discovered that LXRs regulate not only cholesterol metabolism but also influence the expression of inflammatory genes. Contributing to nuclear receptor biology, his research directed the field towards exploring links between cellular lipid metabolism and immune signaling pathways. He further uncovered significant functions of cholesterol balance in both innate and acquired immune cells, illustrating the importance of LXR transcriptional networks in macrophage reactions to bacterial pathogens and the removal of apoptotic cells. Additionally, he illustrated that disturbances in LXR signaling can result in autoimmune disease development.\nTontonoz has utilized the LXR pathway as a roadmap to unveil mechanisms involved in lipid homeostasis. In 2009, he identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase IDOL a new mechanism for post-translational control of the LDLR.\n He proceeded to elucidate IDOL's mode of operation, its species-specific functions in systemic cholesterol metabolism, and uncovered roles for lipoprotein receptors in Alzheimer's disease and cognitive functions such as learning and memory. In addition, he has also offered insight into LXR-dependent mechanisms that merge sterol and phospholipid metabolism, ensuring membrane homeostasis. He demonstrated LXRs' key role in shaping the acyl chain composition of biological membranes by regulating the phospholipid-remodeling enzyme Lpcat3, and showed that Lpcat3's ability to regulate membrane dynamics is vital for fundamental biological processes, such as the secretion of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins from the liver, absorption of dietary lipids, and proliferation of intestinal stem cells.\nIn 2018, Tontonoz addressed the issue of cholesterol transport between the plasma membrane and the ER by discovering a family of three previously unidentified proteins, which he named Asters, serving as innovative intracellular sterol carriers. He defined Asters as ER-resident proteins that form plasma membrane-ER contacts in response to elevated cholesterol levels in the plasma membrane, and demonstrated the critical role of Aster-B in transporting HDL-derived cholesterol from SR-BI to the ER in the adrenal cortex and liver, thus highlighting its essential function in vivo. He further showed that Asters facilitate dietary cholesterol absorption in the intestine by acting downstream of NPC1-L1.\nMore recently in 2023, Tontonoz identified CLSTN3β as a novel ER-lipid droplet contact protein that governs lipid utilization in adipocytes. He showed that the distinctive role of this protein in inhibiting lipid droplet coalescence resolves the question of why brown fat cells harbor numerous small lipid droplets while white fat cells possess a single large one.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n2005 – Richard E.

        "content": "Gentil Cardoso (5 July 1906 – 8 September 1970), was a Brazilian footballer and manager.\n\n\n== Player career ==\nAs a player, Gentil Cardoso had little renown, playing for minor football teams in Rio de Janeiro during the 1920s, most notably for São Cristóvão.\n\n\n== Managerial career ==\nGentil worked as a coach for several clubs, having started his career at Syrio and Libanez in 1930, the club with which he ended his career as a player. He won the Campeonato Carioca twice (in 1946 with Fluminense and 1952 with Vasco da Gama), in addition to being the coach of the Brazil national team in the 1959 South American Championship, held in Ecuador, and which included football representatives from Pernambuco state in the dispute. He also coached Sporting CP, winning the Taça de Honor and scoring the biggest defeat in European competitions, with a 16–0 victory over APOEL. He ended his career in 1969 at El Nacional de Quito.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nGentil ran away from home at the age of 13 to try his luck in Rio de Janeiro, working various odd jobs before becoming a player. As a coach he was marked by folkloric phases, the most folkloric being \"It's going to be a zebra\" (Portuguese: \"Vai dar zebra\"), referring to unusual results in football.\n\n\n== Death ==\nGentil Cardoso died on 8 September 1970, victim of a gastric ulcer.\n\n\n== Honours ==\n\n\n=== Manager ===\nFluminense\nCampeonato Carioca: 1946\nCorinthians\nTaça Cidade de São Paulo: 1948\nVasco da Gama\nCampeonato Carioca: 1952\nSport Recife\nCampeonato Pernambucano: 1955\nSanta Cruz\nCampeonato Pernambucano: 1959\nNáutico\nCampeonato Pernambucano: 1960\nPaysandu\nCampeonato Paraense: 1961, 1962\nSporting\nTaça de Honra: 1963–64\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGentil Cardoso at ogol.com.br (in Brazilian Portuguese)",

        "content": "Marie Jeanneret (13 January 1836 – 4 April 1884) was a Swiss serial killer who murdered at least six people.\nJeanneret was accused of having murdered six people by poison and poisoned three other people from the end of October 1867 to mid-January 1868 on 23 November 1868. According to the criminal code of the canton of Geneva, the death penalty could be imposed for these crimes. The President of the Court was Eugène Colladon (1805–1880), the public prosecutor was William Turrettini (1810–1876). Marie Jeanneret was defended by lawyer Gaspard Zurlinden (1838–1915).\nDuring the trial, she admitted that she had secretly administered atropine or morphine to all six of the deceased and the three other victims, although not with criminal intent, but out of medical interest in order to find out the effects of her experiments; In doing so, she did not consider the serious consequences. The jury reached a verdict that the defendant was found guilty, but under extenuating circumstances, so she was sentenced to the maximum sentence of twenty years in prison. The verdict led to the abolition of the death sentence in the canton of Geneva in 1871 after politician Marc Héridier campaigned for its abolition.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of serial killers by country\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Footnotes ===",

She was arrested by the Corruption Eradication Commission for bribing state auditors in 2022 and was sentenced to four years in prison.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nAde Yasin was born on 29 May 1968 in Bogor Regency to Yasin and Nuryati. Ade's father was an early founder of the United Development Party (PPP) in Bogor, and had served in the local legislatures of both Bogor Regency and Bogor City. She studied in Bogor, graduating from high school in 1987 and continuing her studies until she received her master's degree from Djuanda University. After graduating, she began to work as a lawyer.\n\n\n== Career ==\nShe took part in the 2009 Indonesian legislative election as a PPP member and was elected into the Bogor Regency Regional House of Representatives.

She also initiated a rural infrastructure funding program, which in 2021 and 2022 disbursed Rp 400 billion (US$26 million) to Bogor's villages – Rp 1 billion per village annually.\n\n\n== Arrest and prison ==\nOn 27 April 2022, Yasin was arrested along with 11 others in an operation by the Corruption Eradication Commission. She was found guilty for bribing auditors from the Audit Board of Indonesia in order to give the regency a pass in their audits. The Bandung District Court sentenced her to four years in prison, and the decision was withheld after two appeals.\n\n\n== Family ==\nYasin was married to Yanwar Permadi (d.2020), and the couple had three children. Two of Yasin's siblings, Rachmat Yasin and Zaenul Mutaqin, are also United Development Party politicians.

        "content": "On November 6, 2018, the U.S. state of Massachusetts held an election for each of the eight total seats for the Massachusetts Governor's Council. The ballot of voting was open from 7a.m. to 8p.m in each towns designated voting spot; which tends to be the public schools or town halls. As odd as it may seem, there isn't necessarily an ID needed for this type of election, once you go to the designated spot in the town they have a lsit of the towns citizens that allows the people working the polls access to if you are old enough or not to be voting.\n\n\n== Election ==\nWhen it came to the results of this election, Joespeh Ferreia won the democatric primary vote, while Thomas Keyes had won the overall republican primary vote. Robert Jubinville was the candidate who won the independent party for the District 2 of the 8. Marilyn Petitto Devaney is known to have won the vote for District 3, against Nick Carter by 10,000 votes. When it comes to District 4 Christopher Iannella had won by 76% against the other people who were involved in the district voting. There were three main candidates in District 5:  Eileen Duff,  Richard Baker, and Marc Mercier yet Duff had come out on top with over 100,000 votes. District 6 was against Terrence Kennedy and  Vincent Lawrence Dixon, but with Massachusetts being known as a blue states, Kennedy had come out on top with over 200,000 more votes than Dixion. Although Massachusetts is knwon as a democratic state, conservative politician Jennie Caissie won against Paul Deploy by a little over 20,000 votes; which can be very surprising to many politicians. Lastly, for District 8 Mary Hurley had won against Mike Franco by 68% against 23.1%.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Wizīdagīhā-ī Zādspram (or Vizīdagīhā-ī Zādspram), also known as the Anthology or Selections of Zadspram, is a Pahlavi language composition from the 9th-century Zoroastrian scholar and high priest Zadspram, who was primarily active ca. 880 AD. His works were composed closely in time to the Denkard and the Bundahishn and treats similar subjects, but is independent of them. The primary subject matters of the book include a description of Zoroastrian cosmology, the life of the prophet Zoroaster, and then the eschatological end. The work also delves into matters of medicine, astrology, and zoology. Some sections of the work derive from the Zend, an earlier Zoroastrian commentary.\n\n\n== Zoology ==\nThe third chapter of the Anthologies fixates on enumerating the different types of living species. This section is likely reliant on the lost Dāmdād nask (Division on Creation) from the Avesta. Zadspram also refers to a zoological book of his which is now lost.\n\n\n== Astrology ==\nThe thirtieth chapter discusses what is part of what has been called the microcosm and macrocosm theory, namely, the idea that there is a structural semblance between the human being (microcosm) and the cosmos (macrocosm). Zād 30.5–12 posits that the human body has seven innermost to outermost layers, and that each one of these is governed by one or two heavenly bodies, of the seven total heavenly bodies (the sun, moon, and the five known planets besides the Earth at the time). For the bone marrow, this is the descending lunar node and the moon. Mercuy governs the moon, Venus governs the flesh, the sun governs the nerves, Mars governs the veins, Jupiter covers the skin, and Saturn governs the hair. This type of description reflects what is known as melothesia or medical astrology, a subbranch of astrology that seeks to explain the influences of the seven signs of the zodiac onto the different parts of the human body, and has its roots in earlier forms of Greek astrology. The seven parts of the human body here are also listed in other examples of Pahlavi literature, like the Bundahishn. \n\n\n== Structure ==\nThe text contains 35 chapters. According to Tavadia, the book involves a three-fold division covering the cosmological/creation phase, a phase covering the life of Zoroaster, and finally the eschatological end. Gignoux-Tafazzoli propose a four-fold division to the work:\n\nChapters 1–3: Mazdean cosmogony and the phases of creation.\nChapters 4–26: Legendary events of the life of Zoroaster.\nChapters 27–28: The five characters of priests, the ten counsels for pious men, and the threefold division of religion.\nChapters 29–30: A separate third section. The composition of a human person according to a fourfold scheme.\nChapters 34–35: General eschatology and the events of the end of times.\n\n\n== Editions ==\nAnklesaria, B.T.

        "content": "Krav Avir (Hebrew: קרב אוויר) is a 2023 Israeli action drama film directed by Roy Hornshtein. The film stars Maor Schwitzer and Daniel Litman as Israeli Air Force pilots at the beginning of the Six Day War. It follows the two men and their operation that defeated the combined air forces of Egypt, Syria and Jordan in one day.\n\n\n== Plot summary ==\nA personal rivalry between two fighter pilots, Ran (Schwitzer) and Eitan (Litman) reaches its crescendo on the eve of the Six Day War. In an operational activity, Eitan's respected commander is killed. Ran steps into the role, supported by Eitan as deputy commander. Eitan feels  threatened by the sudden appearance of Ran, whom he finds inexperienced. Their power struggle impacts upon the squadron as it becomes dysfunctional.\nWhen the two crash land together in enemy territory, they are forced to learn to cooperate in order to survive. Upon their return to the squadron and the outbreak of the Six Day War, the two face a decisive battle and understand that only through cooperation will they be able to lead the squadron to victory. Eitan learns from his rival Ran how to overcome his fears and succeed.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nMaor Schwitzer as Captain Ran Nesher\nDaniel Litman as Lieutenant Eitan Rom\nLihi Kornowski\nGily Itskovitch\nAmir Shurush\nGal Amitai\nYonatan Uziel\nGaly Reshef\n\n\n== Production ==\nRoy Hornshtein, the director, began working in the film in 2007. After securing investors and writing a script, he applied to the Israel Cinema Fund and the Rabinovitch Fund for support of approximately 3 million shekels. The request was denied, for failing to give more emphasis on \"anti-war\" sentiments and for \"avoiding to touch on issues such as the horror of death and the destruction that war causes to both sides.\" According to Hornstein, these reasons were political and not professional. Hornshtein turned to Culture Minister Miri Regev and asked for an investigation on the subject, and it convened the subcommittee of the Film Council to examine his claims. In the end, Hornshtein received funding from the Yehoshua Rabinowitz Foundation for the Arts and the Shomron Cinema Fund, which was established as part of a reform passed by Regev.\nFilming took place at the Israeli Air Force Museum at the Hatzerim Airbase, Kibbutz Yakum and an industrial zone in Ariel.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe film had its first screening on 24 December 2023 at the fourth annual Shomron Film Festival. It then premiered on February 7, 2024, among the 26 Israeli films screened as part of Israeli Cinema Day. The film was released theatrically in Israel on 11 April 2024.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nMako gave the film three out of five stars, praising the period reconstruction and concluding: \"In conclusion and a movie, \"Krav Avir\" deserves to be watched on a big screen. It is clearly made for the audience, and for the most part warrants our attention.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nIMDB",

        "content": "On October 3, 1986, Kharkus of Khalistan Commando Force, a Kharku group led by Labh Singh, made an attempt on the life of Director General of Police in Punjab Julio Ribeiro in Jalandhar within the Punjab Armored Police headquarters. Ribeiro was wounded in the attack along with his wife. Ribeiro's wounds were minor, but his wife was hospitalized. 2 officers were killed and 2 were seriously wounded in the attack. All the attackers escaped unhurt.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Punjab Insurgency began with Operation Blue Star which saw a military attack on the Golden Temple and numerous other Gurdwaras. The aim of the Operation was to flush out Sikh militants from Gurdwaras, but it caused great damage to the Golden Temple and, according to independent estimates, 5,000 civilians were killed in the operation. The Operation was viewed by a large amount of Sikhs as an attack on the faith who became Kharkus and joined the Khalistan Movement and began an insurgency. Ribeiro was made the chief of Punjab Police in late 1985 to bring an end to the insurgency. He was created with making the \"bullet for bullet\" policy to combat Kharkus in reaction to Labh Singh's breaking out of prison.\nIn early 1986 Khalistan Commando Force was founded by the Sarbat Khalsa and Panthic Committee. It was the \"official\" army of Khalistan. Manbir Singh Chaheru was made the leader in February 1986. After his disappearance in police custody Labh Singh took over. The earlies goal of KCF was the killing of Ribeiro.\n\n\n=== Planning ===\nAccording to Harjinder Singh Jinda he and fellow members of KCF had always aspired to assassinate Ribeiro, but planning for such did not begin until Labh Singh took over KCF in August 1986. Wassam Singh and Dhanna Singh of the Panthic Committee were key members in the planning of the assassination. Labh Singh was said to be the mastermind. Multiple officers working at Punjab Armored Police headquarters in Jalandhar had joined KCF and began plotting with Labh Singh on how to kill Ribeiro. Gurcharan Singh, Constable Sardul Singh, Constable Balwinder Singh, Constable Dalwinder Singh, Constable Kewal Singh, Head Constable Ajit Singh, and Head Constable Kulwant Singh of the Punjab Police along with Labh Singh offered an Ardas on September 15 for their goal of killing Ribeiro in revenge for Ribeiro's role in fake encounters which targeted Sikh youth. The Kharkus would usually meet at Ajit Singh's home planning escape routes and details of the attack. Balwinder Singh acquired the weapons for the attack a few days before.\n\n\n== Attack ==\nOn October 3, 1986, 6 Kharkus attacked Ribeiro as he walked in the Punjab Armored Police's headquarters' garden along with wife. At 6:45 am Dalwinder Singh, Balwinder Singh, Sardul Singh and Ajit Singh armed with Carbines and Dhanna Singh, with a machine gun, drove to the gate of the headquarters in a police jeep, numbering 471 PAT, driven by Vijaypal Singh. All were in police uniform. One of them exited the jeep and asked an officer for their weapon to inspect it. Upon getting it he and 3 other Kharkus scaled a mound and opened fire on Ribeiro who ducked in cover. They further shot dead a sentry and injured another one. Over 50 rounds were fired. While fleeing they killed another officer and wounded one more. The Kharkus abandoned the jeep near the headquarters and fled in a truck. No officer fired a shot in retrun or attempted to chase the Kharkus. In the attack 2 officers were killed. Ribeiro escaped wounded, and his wife was hospitalized. 4 other officers were wounded.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe attack led to  criticism on Punjab Police's readiness. Chief Minister of Punjab Surjit Singh Barnala said, 'The complex should have been the best protected place in Punjab. There has been a definite, serious security lapse. The guards were not trained, they were not cautious. Somebody inside knew the entire set-up. The terrorists knew which side they should go, even the passage through the barbed wire. Since our increased onslaught on the terrorists, they have been eager for actions that will give them publicity mileage.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

He also passed on teachings from Reish Lakish and Rabbi Joshua ben Levi.\nHis colleagues were Rabbi Zeira and Rabbi Levi. Abaye, Rabbi Jonah, Rabbi Yossi bar Zavida and Rabbi Jeremiah (III) repeated teachings in his name.\n\n\n== Teachings ==\nMost of Rabbi Hama bar Ukva's teachings are in the field of Halakha, though in several places in the Talmud and Midrash his  Aggadic teachings are cited. \nIn Tractate Sukkah he explains in the name of his Rabbi Jose bar Hanina the reason that the Lulav is shaken in all directions: \"He moves them forward and backwards to stop harmful winds; upwards and downwards to halt harmful dew.\"\nIn Shir HaShirim Rabbah a statement of his is cited that deals with the importance of Torah learning. \"Words of Torah strengthen one who learns them fully.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Earl Eugene Kynette (June 18, 1893 – June 3, 1970) was an American police officer who led the Los Angeles Police Department Intelligence Squad under Chief James E. Davis during the Great Depression era. The Intelligence Squad was assigned to (among other things) \"spy on, compromise, and intimidate critics and foes of the department and the mayor\".\n\n\n== Career ==\nKynette was a native of Council Bluffs, Iowa who graduated from the University of Southern California. He worked as a druggist and a hotel manager before entering the Los Angeles Police Academy, from which he graduated around November 1925. Within 18 months he was a sergeant, working on raiding \"blind pigs\" (illegal Prohibition-era drinking establishments), among other tasks. \n\nKynette was first fired from the LAPD in 1927, after being charged with taking a bribe, but was rehired a few weeks later. After reinstatement he worked in Wilmington in the Harbor area for about three months before being transferred to the detective bureau downtown. In 1929 the downtown homicide bureau adopted a stray tabby cat; Kynette named her Madame Pompadour. By December 1929, Kynette was ranked as a detective lieutenant and was transferred to the Venice bureau. In August 1930 he was \"demoted\" and transferred to Boyle Heights, likely due to his involvement in the investigation of the murder of Motley Flint; \"For Kynette, at the time Frank Keaton shot and killed Motley Flint, prominent banker, was the only officer investigating the case to tell of the discovery of [Rev. Robert] Shuler's vitriolic booklet Julian Thieves found in the murderer's possession. There was much talk at the time of the finding of the booklet that it might have been a contributing factor in Keaton's desire to murder the banker. Kynette was subjected to much criticism by friends of the broadcasting pastor for telling newspaper men that Keaton had the booklet. Other officers lied deliberately or evaded questions of reporters about the pamphlet. No reason was given for Kynette's transfer. He was simply ordered to report in uniform Monday morning at the east side station.\" Julian Thieves in Politics was part of Rev. Shuler's involvement in publicizing the Julian Petroleum Corporation scandal.\n\nJulian executives defrauded local investors of $100–$200 million (nearly $3 billion in 2019 dollars) with the help of local businessmen and politicians. Grand juries indicted several of those involved, but the slow pace of the prosecutions led the Supreme Court of California to dismiss the charges en masse for failure to provide a speedy trial...Shuler blamed both the District Attorney of Los Angeles County, Asa Keyes, and Los Angeles City Prosecutor Lloyd Nix for the failure, implying on air that Keyes was in the pocket of the indicted businessmen and that Nix was negligent. Shuler's broadcast attacks forced Keyes to resign; the disgraced former district attorney would indeed later be convicted of taking a bribe from a Julian executive. Nix, also forced to resign, would eventually extract a measure of revenge on Shuler, but not before the imbroglio peaked with the killing of one of the indicted businessmen by a defrauded investor who carried a printed copy of one of Shuler's broadcasts in his pocket bearing the title Julian Thieves in Politics. Nix claimed during an interview on another radio station that Shuler had as good as pulled the trigger by inciting public outrage over the acquittals in the first place.\"\nAccording to the Los Angeles Evening Post-Record in 1930, describing Kynette and others criticized by Rev. Shuler, Kynette was an expert in poisons and chemicals, and \"As we know, Mr. Kynette has obtained the highest rating in the police school ever obtained by any policeman anywhere in the United States. He is a college graduate, an officer of the U.S. Army Reserves, a chemist and a man with a thorough scientific training. Besides that he has plenty of personal initiative and energy. He is the kind of man of whom the modern police executive is made.\" In 1935, the editorial page of Manchester Boddy's Post-Record intimated that Kynette and other members of the LAPD Vice Squad were being favored within the department: \"Apparently there is only one sure route to advancement on this police department. The candidate who would succeed in passing civil service examinations cum laude, so to speak, must pass his time in the intellectually more stimulating society of prostitutes, gamblers, hop-heads, small-time politicians, and the like who may be encountered regularly in the routine of a vice squad officer.\"\nA close ally of Chief Davis, Kynette was heavily involved in the department's unconstitutional diversion at the state line of migrants to California (\"Okies and Arkies\"), sometimes known as the Bum Blockade. In general, Kynette's career \"was as crassly cavalier and oblivious to individual rights as mayor Shaw's career as a public servant. A craggy, misshapen former pharmacist who had once worked for L.A.'s brothel meister Albert Marco, Kynette had already been fired and rehired hired once since his graduation from the police academy in 1925. Like Commander St. Charles, Kynette had been caught shaking down prostitutes, but in the days before mayor Shaw, a vice officer could be suspended and/or discharged charged for dunning whores. Fortunately for Kynette, LAPD standards had dropped since Chief Davis's reinstatement.\" In 1938 Kynette was charged with, and ultimately convicted of, conspiracy to commit murder in the bombing attack that maimed a private investigator and former San Diego Chief of Police named Harry Raymond. Raymond worked for an regional anti-corruption group, digging up evidence against the mayor and the police department. The trial was described by Time magazine as \"Southern California's biggest political circus\" and revealed that the Intelligence Squad was under direct control of the mayor's brother, and had spied on many local dignitaries including John Anson Ford (the mayor's political opponent in the most recent election) and Buron Rogers Fitts (the district attorney trying the case). The scandal led Chief Davis' departure from the police force.\n\nKynette served nine years in San Quentin prison. He was released on parole in 1948 with the \"proviso that he not return to Los Angeles County until 1952\". In 1951, Kynette was arrested in the San Francisco Bay area on a drunkenness charge, and then found to have \"an empirin compound and codeine\" in his hotel room, and as such, he was sent back to prison. He died in Los Angeles County in 1970.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nDomanick, Joe (1994). To Protect and To Serve: The LAPD's Century of War in the City of Dreams.

        "content": "Teenager is a numeric term used to describe a person from the ages of 13 to 19 years. Although it is used to distinguish people by the decade of their life, it excludes ages 10–12 even though they are part of the same decade, since the numbers 10-12 do not include the suffix -teen. Instead, people aged 10 to 12 years old are placed in the category of preteen, which was coined to recognize ages 10 to 12 as part of the same decade as 13-19 but linguistically separate due to the absence of the -teen numeral. The shortened form of teenager is teen, which is the only recognized form of the suffix used as a noun or adjective.\nAlthough teenager is primarily a numeric term, it is commonly used to describe a person in the process of transitioning from childhood to adulthood while experiencing the physical changes of puberty, and is conflated with adolescent. However, the developmental changes of adolescence, such as puberty (particularly in females) and the transition from primary to secondary school, typically begin around the preteens, while cognitive and physical maturation continue into the 20s. Thus, the teenage years only provide a very approximate age range of human adolescence.\nDespite its commonality in everyday usage, teenager is a relatively modern introduction to the English language which debuted in print around the 1910s, and did not become popular until around the late 1940s and early 1950s as a marketing neologism.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nTeenager is derived from the adjective teenage, which is named after the suffix -teen appearing in the numbers representing ages 13 to 19 and forming the name of said numerals.\nNot all languages include a morpheme in their spelling of numbers 13–19, so they may not have a numeric equivalent to teenager and may use the same word for adolescent in their translation for teenager. For example, teenager in Spanish translates to adolescente the same way adolescent does, since the Spanish language does not include a morpheme in its version of numbers 13–19. Meanwhile, people in these foreign cultures may just be considered children or young adults with no recognized intermediate stage.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe earliest recorded usage of the word teenager in print was in 1913 in a Wilmington, Delaware newspaper called Every Evening Commercial, Wilmington Daily, where it was capitalized and treated as two separate words (Teen Ager) and used in an article about county Sunday schools. The text read, \"Some of the best practical workers among 'Teen Agers' will be present and speak.\" However, during this time it was treated as a slang term and not recognized by the public due to its exclusive use in local newspaper articles. The word continued to be spelled this way or hyphenated in print until around 1941, where the Popular Science magazine was credited for the first usage of teenager as a singular conjoined term.\nBefore this, the adjective teenage gained its first recorded usage in an Evening Tribune newspaper from Albert Lea, Minnesota in 1912, where it was also treated as two separate words (teen age), similar to the later teenager. It was used in the sentence, \"Margaret Slattery [...] will deliver six lectures on the development of teen age boys and girls\". Much like teenager, the adjective did not see the treatment of a singular word until the early 1940s.\nEven earlier, the prototype to the noun was attested teener and coined in 1894.\nThe noun teen in reference to a person aged 13 to 19 years dates back to 1818, where it was first used in the title of a manual handbook called Advice to the Teens, Or Practical Help to Formation of the Character, though it was extremely rare until the 20th century when the marketing concept of the teenager came to momentum.\nNevertheless, the earliest age-related terminology based on the suffix is teens, referring to the life stage. The earliest recorded usage of teens in this sense dates to the 1590s. Although, it was spelled differently as Teenes, and did not gain its modern spelling until 1664 when The Cheats was published by John Wilson. The noun teen was first recognized in a pop culture title in 1919 when the comic strip Harold Teen was published.\n\n\n== Public recognition and marketing ==\nDuring 1944, teenager gained traction as a term used by marketers to emphasize on the spending powers of American high school students. After World War II, a new stage of life was being recognized due to the generation gap many youths experienced between their parents as a result of being brought up in a war generation. Marketers wanted to recognize this emerging phenomenon as a period involving rebellion and experimentation with youth subcultures, also taking note of America's compulsory schooling extension into high school after the 1938 ban on child labor. As such, the term teenager rose to popularity throughout advertising with several companies catering to the fashion, music, transportation, film, literature and magazine preferences of high schoolers, with several different subcultures being catered to.\nOne of the earliest mentions of the word ‘teenager’ in the British Newspaper Archive was in a fashion-related magazine article from The Sketch in 1945, called ‘Teen-age Triumphs.’ Another early usage comes from an advert for Nestlé's Milo in the West London Observer called 'Trouble With a Teen-Ager', published March 1950. The cartoon depicts a teenage girl and her mother, the latter of whom remarks ‘Sally’s so difficult these days.’ Her friend advises that like all teenagers, Sally simply ‘needs building up’ – naturally, with the help of Milo, a cup of which is sure to ‘bring a smile-o.’\nIn his short book The Teenage Consumer published in July 1959, the British market research pioneer Mark Abrams identified the emergence of a new economic group of people aged 13–25. Compared to children, people in this age range had more money, more discretion on how they chose to spend it, and greater mobility through the advent of the motor car. Compared to adults, people in this age range had fewer responsibilities and therefore made different choices on how to spend their money. These unique characteristics of this new economic group presented challenges and opportunities to advertisers. Mark Abrams rose the term to widespread use to describe this group of consumers aged 13–25 (even though ages 20–25 are numerically excluded from the dictionary definition of teenager despite many still going through the developmental stage of adolescence).\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nThomas Hine expressed in a 1999 American Heritage article called The Rise and Decline of the Teenager that he thought of the term as little more than a lazy way of describing young people and has connotations of ageism and infantilization. He wrote, \"The term encompasses a contradictory grab bag of beliefs, prejudices, and expectations. It can allow us to build a wall around an age group and to assume that its members’ problems can safely be ignored.\" Hine wrote in the same article under The Teenage Mystique chapter that the word embodies extreme ambivalence about the people it describes with a ride range of stereotypes that contradict society's expectations for them.\nRebecca Grant of The Guardian criticized the term for how many negative connotations it has for a word that is merely intended to describe the numeric order of an age group, bringing attention to the many prejudices older people exhibit to youth and stereotypes of irrational and dangerous behavior. She wrote of being more in favor of \"young people\" or any other label that acknowledges them as human beings rather than discrediting them based solely on their age.\nDr. Michael Platt wrote in issue #2 of Practical Homeschooling in a 1993 article called \"Myth of the Teenager\" that he thought of the term as a label that encourages young people to shun responsibility and delay their entry into adulthood.\nRichard Fisher wrote in a 2022 BBC Family Tree article that he thinks a new word describing young people between childhood and adulthood should be coined due to the outdated connotations associated with teenager and the evolution in youth culture from the last 100 years.\nThe Psychology Today article 'A 20-Second Experiment in Racial Stereotypes' points out that attributes of delinquency, emotional volatility, sex and rebellion immediately come to mind when describing teenagers in general without knowing anything about them on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Century House was an American publisher located in Watkins Glen, New York. It was established in 1942 and specialized in publications on American culture and history. The company published several academic reference works on American music and art. The company also published numerous books on American antiques and other Americana collectibles. The publishing company was established by husband and wife Larry Freeman (1904–1995) and Ruth Freeman (1907–2000), both of whom had careers in academics. Dr. Graydon Laverne “Larry” Freeman, Ph.D. was a psychologist who taught on the faculties of Northwestern University and Cornell University. The publisher was still listed as active as late as 1992 in R.R. Bowker's Publishers, Distributors & Wholesalers of the United States.\nThe Freemans also used their Century House company as the managing organization for a museum, Old Irelandville in Watkins Glen. In the 1930s the couple purchased a historic farm house built by Charles Potter. They then purchased more historic buildings, some of them from other locations, which were then moved to their property to create a historic village. These included a tavern dating to 1797 and a manor house dating to 1833. The museum opened shortly after the end of World War II in the late 1940s and was still in operation as late as 1972. Lack of funds caused the museum to cease operation.\n\n\n== References ==",

Pikauterangi raised an army of 10,000 men against Te Rauangaanga, Pōtatau Te Wherowhero's father, who rallied 3,000 men from Waikato Tainui and Ngāti Maniapoto to defend their home territories against invasion.\nPikauterangi was the oldest son of chief Te Maunu. He married two sisters, Te Kahurangi and Nihoniho, and their children became important chiefs in Ngāti Toa also. Together with his older brother, Wharerau, they formed a hapū within Ngāti Toa called Ngāti Kurī.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Andi Harun (born 12 December 1972) is an Indonesian politician of the Gerindra Party who has served as the mayor of Samarinda, East Kalimantan since 2021. Before being elected as mayor, he had been elected for five terms as a member of East Kalimantan's Provincial Regional House of Representatives.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nAndi Harun was born in Bone Regency, in South Sulawesi, on 12 December 1972. His parents were rice farmers and merchants at a local market. After completing high school in Sinjai, he received a degree in mining engineering at the Indonesian Muslim University in Makassar. He briefly moved to Jakarta after graduating before getting a job in mining and moved again to East Kalimantan in 1995.\nHe would later receive a bachelor's degree in law from the Indonesian Muslim University and a master's degree in economics from Mulawarman University.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1998, Harun took part in student protests in Jakarta leading up to the fall of Suharto, before returning again to East Kalimantan. There, he took part as a candidate in the 1999 legislative election and won a seat in the Provincial Regional House of Representatives as a member of the National Mandate Party (PAN). He was reelected to the body in 2004, still as a PAN member, and became its deputy speaker. During his time at PAN, he was deputy chairman of the provincial branch between 1998 and 2001, and chairman between 2001 and 2006. For the 2009, he moved to the Patriot Party and retained his seat in the legislature.\nHarun ran in the 2010 mayoral election for Samarinda with the support of Patriot, Golkar, and Gerindra, placing third out of seven candidates with 57,979 votes (19%). By 2013, he had moved to Golkar and became the party's branch chairman in Bontang the following year. He was elected for a fourth term in the provincial DPRD in 2014 as a Golkar member. In the middle of this term, he moved to Gerindra, and following a series of internal disputes and lawsuits Golkar replaced him in the provincial parliament on 4 September 2018. He was elected for a fifth term in 2019 as a Gerindra legislator, becoming deputy speaker for a second time.\nIn the 2020 Samarinda mayoral election, Harun ran again, with PDI-P cadre Rusmadi as running mate. The ticket won the election after securing 102,592 votes (36.12%) in the three-way race. Harun was sworn in as mayor on 26 February 2021. During his term as mayor, the city developed a new water treatment facility for freshwater needs and worked with the provincial government to improve infrastructure and housing in the city's slums.\n\n\n== Family ==\nHarun married Rinda Wahyuni in 1995, and the couple has three children. His eldest child Muhammad Afif Reyhan became a member of the Samarinda City Regional House of Representatives in 2021 as a Gerindra member replacing a resigning member.\n\n\n== References ==",

Her victories at major international races include the Tarawera Ultramarathon, Western States, and Ultra Trail Cape Town.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBorn on 15 January 1989 in Greymouth, on the West Coast of New Zealand's South Island, Croft grew up in the small town of Stillwater. She attended Rangi Ruru Girls' School in Christchurch, where she ran track and cross country. As a junior, she was the under-20 national champion and competed for New Zealand at the 2006 World Junior Championships in Athletics in the 3000 metres steeplechase. She also competed as a junior at both the 2005 and 2007 World Mountain Running Championships.\nAfter finishing high school, Croft briefly enrolled at Lincoln University near Christchurch, but returned home to the West Coast to work instead. She moved to the United States after receiving an athletic scholarship to run for the University of Portland in Oregon. After graduating from Portland, Croft moved to Taiwan to teach English. She lived there for five-and-a-half years, eventually moving to a job working in marketing for the technology company Garmin.\n\n\n== Professional ==\nCroft began competing in more trail races while living in Taiwan, and eventually became a sponsored athlete with Garmin. She won the Mt. Kinabalu International Climbathon 50k in Malaysia in 2013 and 2014. She also won the 100-km CCC event at UTMB in 2015, and followed that with a fourth-place finish at the highly competitive North Face 50 in San Francisco, California. She moved away from Taiwan in 2017, splitting her time between Europe and New Zealand.\nIn 2017, Croft won the Translatlantau 50K in Hong Kong, the 62-km event at Tarawera in New Zealand, and the 73-km Les Templiers event in Millau, France. She returned to Tarawera in 2021, winning the 100-km event in a course record time of 9:21:03. She won Tarawera again in 2024. She won the 55-km OCC in Chamonix in both 2018 and 2019. At the 2019 Trail World Championships in Miranda do Corvo, Portugal, Croft won the silver medal behind Blandine L'Hirondel of France. It was the first medal for a New Zealand athlete in trail world championship history.\nCroft competed in her first 100-mile race at Western States in 2021, having a successful debut in finishing second behind English runner Beth Pascall. She returned the next year to win Western States in a time of 17:21:30.\nCroft won the 100-km Ultra Trail Cape Town in South Africa in November 2023. She was scheduled to run UTMB in 2023, but came down with a virus days before the race and did not start.\n\n\n=== Non-racing ===\nCroft ran the length of the 125-mile Arctic Circle Trail in Greenland in 2022. In 2023, she ran the historic Nakasendo Trail in Japan along with Tim Tollefson and Olympians Magda Boulet and Desiree Linden.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nAs of 2021, Croft was studying for a career in naturopathy.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRuth Croft at ARRS\nRuth Croft at ITRA\nRuth Croft on Instagram",

        "content": "Quincy Luwokollie Borrowes (born  April 24, 1996 – March 3, 2017), known professionally as Quincy B, was a Liberian singer, songwriter and record producer. He gained recognition in 2013 after releasing his debut single \"My Dream\", which features rapper Scientific. In 2014, Quincy B released the Tan Tan B-assisted track \"State of Emergency\", which promotes awareness of the Ebola virus epidemic in Liberia. Quincy B's music explored hipco, R&B, and afropop. He primarily sung in Kolokwa English and took great pride in being Liberian. On March 3, 2017, Quincy B died in an automobile accident. His posthumous album, Mr. All the Time, was issued by ALM Records and released on March 11, 2017. It comprises thirteen tracks and consists entirely of previously released singles.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nQuincy Luwokollie Borrowes was born on April 24, 1996, in Liberia. He started singing in his church choir at an early age. Quincy B fled to Ghana with his family during the First Liberian Civil War. He attended Budumburam High School and studied music education at an unnamed university while residing in Ghana. He returned to Liberia in 2012 and made his music debut in 2013, achieving significant success in the Liberian music industry. Producer Infectious Michael is credited with helping him jump-start his music career. Prior to joining Lewiz McCarthy's ALM Records, Quincy B was signed to Michael's record label, Heart Beat Records.\nIn August 2014, Quincy B released \"State of Emergency\", a collaborative single he recorded with Tan Tan B. The song features soulful piano chords and raises awareness about Liberia's Ebola virus epidemic. \"State of Emergency\" addresses a public health crisis as exemplified by lyrics like \"Pull the alarm, turn on the sirens. I see my people dying, but nobody's firing\". In November 2014, Quincy B and rapper Scientific released their collaborative single \"Shawty\", which is composed of lyrics that uplift African women. He previously worked with Scientific on the single \"My Dream\", which was his debut single. Quincy B released the single \"Crazy\" in 2015. Sky Bar, a rooftop lounge in Sinkor, hosted a release party to commemorate the song's release. He performed \"Crazy\" along with the songs \"Tumba Baba\" and \"Shawty Bad\". The release party featured additional performances from singers Eric Geso, Cassi Money, Young Classic, Chilla Conani, and Kzee. \nThe Daily Observer newspaper revealed in June 2016 that Quincy B had agreed to serve as an ambassador for Lonestar Cell, an MTN Group company. On June 1, 2017, Lonestar Cell announced that they were looking for a new brand ambassador to replace Quincy B. In 2017, singer Kobazzie released the single \"Sleep for What\", which was produced by Quincy B and appeared on Press Play, a 2017 compilation album released by Bilikon Entertainment. In the songs \"Olukupay\", \"Mr. All the Time\", and the Gbehma-inspired \"Hitch\" (featuring Kzee), Quincy B extolled the virtues of Liberian girls. He released the song \"Liberian Girl\", dedicating it to women in Liberia, especially sisters and moms. Moreover, he acknowledged the Mandingo custom and noted the traditional name \"Fatumata\" on the record. \nQuincy B and Soul Fresh worked together on the songs \"Friend\" and \"Praise.\" In the former, Quincy B counsels young Liberians to choose their friends wisely. He released the Sweetz-assisted track \"I Pledge\", which was the last song he recorded before his death. Quincy B's posthumous album, Mr. All the Time, was issued by ALM Records, the label to which he was signed. The thirteen-track album, which was released on March 11, 2017, consists entirely of previously released singles.\n\n\n== Artistry and influences ==\nQuincy B's music explored hipco, R&B, and afropop. Quincy B sung in Kolokwa English and took great pride in being Liberian. Front Page Africa's James Giahyue commended him for being a \"true patriot\" and said he had a \"melodious voice and harmonious notes\". Moreover, Giahyue said the singer's career \"summed up voice quality, cultured lyrics and the power of the Liberian colloquial\". Gerald Koinyeneh acknowledged Quincy B for providing \"a therapeutic feeling bigger than entertainment\" and said his \"sonorous voice and deep lyrics healed people and rehabilitated others\". Quincy B cited John Legend, Ne-Yo, and Ryan Leslie as his key musical influences.\n\n\n== Personal life and death ==\nQuincy B had a child with Agnes Kollie, who was nine months pregnant at the time of his death. In an interview with Front Page Africa, Kollie said the singer did not inform his parents about the pregnancy. On March 3, 2017, Quincy B died in a car accident while driving home from a gig at Anglers Bar and Restaurant. His vehicle overturned in front of Monrovia City Hall when he lost control of it. The other occupants of the car, his friends Margas Gayflor, Cralorboi CIC, and Feouls Kaba, all survived the collision. CIC sustained a shattered leg, while the others remained unaffected. On March 24, a burial ceremony and vigil were held at the Antoinette Tubman Stadium. The funeral drew thousands of fans and featured a number of performers who paid tribute to him. Quincy B's remains were transported to Mount Barclay Cemetery and buried there.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nPosthumous albums\n\nMr. All the Time (2017)\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Liberian musicians\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "On 19 April 2024, at 5:23 a.m. IRST, the Israeli Air Force launched airstrikes targeting an air defense facility within Iran. The limited airstrikes targeted an air defense radar site near Isfahan, in central Iran. The attack was launched in response to the Iranian drone and missile strikes in Israel, which itself was an Iranian retaliation for the Israeli bombing of the Iranian embassy in Damascus.\nIranian media and social media reported minor explosions near Isfahan, where Iran has nuclear facilities, a drone manufacturing facility, and a major airbase. Iranian state media said that Israeli drones flying over the region were shot down by the Iranian Air Defense Force. Three Iranian officials confirmed to The New York Times that Israel was involved. US officials confirmed that at least three missiles from Israeli aircraft had struck Iran. No strikes were reported on Iran's nuclear sites.\nAccording to a senior US official speaking to ABC News, Israeli aircraft, operating beyond Iran's borders, launched three missiles targeting an air defense radar site guarding the Natanz nuclear facility. The official further stated that the assessment indicated the successful destruction of the targeted site. He also said that the objective of the strike was to communicate to Iran Israel's capabilities without escalating tensions further. An Iranian official told Reuters that the explosions were from Israeli drones being shot down, and claimed that there had been no missile attack on Iran. Israel struck bases of the Popular Mobilization Forces in Iraq later the same day.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== Middle East escalation ===\nOn 7 October 2023, Hamas, an Islamic militant group supported by Iran, carried out an attack in southern Israel, resulting in the deaths of 1,200 individuals and the kidnapping of at least 253 other Israeli and international citizens. Israel responded by launching the ongoing Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip.\nAfter 7 October, the Iranian-backed proxy Hezbollah in Lebanon began attacking northern Israel. There have been over 4,400 violent incidents recorded between Hezbollah and Israel since the start of the war, and about 100,000 Israelis have been evacuated from northern Israel since the beginning of the conflict. The Iranian-backed Houthi movement has launched dozens of drones and ballistic missiles towards Israel, and have hijacked and attacked ships in the Red Sea, severely restricting the flow of trade through the Suez Canal.\n\n\n=== Bombing of the Iranian Embassy in Damascus ===\n\nOn 1 April 2024, the Iranian consulate annex building adjacent to the Iranian embassy in Damascus, Syria, was struck by an Israeli airstrike, killing 16 people, including a woman and her son, and Brigadier General Mohammad Reza Zahedi, a senior Quds Force commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and seven other IRGC officers, in addition to six other militants belonging to Hezbollah and other Iranian supported groups. Soon after the attack, Iran vowed to retaliate, with reports suggesting this as a potential motive for the airstrike. The Jerusalem Post reported the building was inside the Iranian diplomatic compound, adjacent to the main embassy building.\nIn the weeks following the attack on the consulate, the United States, France, Germany and the United Kingdom all warned Iran not to retaliate to Israel and escalate the situation.\n\n\n=== Iranian strikes in Israel ===\n\nOn 13 April 2024, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), a branch of the Iranian military, in collaboration with the Iraqi Popular Mobilization Forces, Lebanese group Hezbollah, and the Yemeni Houthis, launched attacks against Israel using drones, cruise missiles, and ballistic missiles. Iran stated that the operation was done in retaliation for the Israeli airstrike on an Iranian consulate annex in Damascus, used by the IRGC, two weeks earlier. The operation was part of the Israel-Hamas war spillover and marked Iran's first direct attack on Israel since the start of their proxy conflict.\nIsrael stated that 99 percent of the drones and missiles were destroyed by a coalition during Operation Iron Shield, most before entering Israeli airspace, while a US official said that at least nine Iranian missiles had struck two Israeli airbases, causing minor damage. The missiles caused minor damage to the Nevatim Airbase in southern Israel, which remained operational. An international coalition, including the US, UK, France and Jordan assisted Israel in intercepting Iranian projectiles and in radar coverage. In Israel, a 7-year-old Israeli Bedouin girl was seriously wounded, and thirty-one other people either suffered minor injuries while rushing to shelters or were treated for anxiety. Jordan reported some shrapnel falling on its territory, causing no significant damage or injuries.  \nIran's attacks drew criticism from the United Nations, several world leaders, and political analysts, who warned that they risk escalating into a full-blown regional war. In recent days, Iran has intensified its threats, promising a strong retaliation to any strikes from Israel. Moreover, on April 18, Iran said that it might expedite its nuclear program if its nuclear installations come under attack.\n\n\n== Strikes ==\n\n\n=== Iran ===\nReports from Iranian media and on social media platforms indicated that there were explosions near Isfahan, in a province known for nuclear sites, a major airbase, and a drone manufacturing facility.\nSpecifically, the state-operated Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported that air defenses were activated at Shekari air base in Isfahan, which hosts Iran’s fleet of American-made F-14 Tomcats, which had been acquired prior to the Iranian Revolution in 1979. Additionally, air defense systems were activated in various provinces after unidentified aerial objects were spotted.\nIRNA reported that its journalists did not observe any significant damage or explosions throughout the nation, and no disturbances were recorded at any of Iran's nuclear sites.\nThree Iranian officials told the The New York Times that the strike hit the airbase. US officials later stated that a missile from Israel struck Iran.\nAccording to a senior US official speaking to ABC News, Israeli aircraft, operating beyond Iran's borders, launched three missiles targeting an air defense radar site guarding the Natanz nuclear facility. The official further stated that the assessment indicated the successful destruction of the targeted site. He also said that the objective of the strike was to communicate to Iran Israel's capabilities without escalating tensions further.\nSatellite imagery obtained by Umbra revealed damage sustained by an Iranian S-300PMU2 surface-to-air missile system 30N6E radar in Isfahan.\n\n\n=== Possible related strikes ===\n\n\n==== Syria ====\nSyrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that Israeli strikes hit Syrian Army radar positions in As-Suwayda Governorate and Daraa Governorate in southern Syria. In a statement, Syria's defense ministry confirmed the strikes, stating that Israel carried out an attack using missiles, targeting air defense sites in the southern region and causing material damage.\n\n\n==== Iraq ====\nExplosions were also reported in the morning in Baghdad governorate and Babil Governorate. Fighter jets were heard in Erbil and Mosul. The booster of an Israeli Sparrow air-launched ballistic missile was discovered south of Baghdad, indicating that Israeli aircraft had launched their missiles at Iran within Iraqi airspace.\nIsrael also struck multiple bases of the Iranian proxy  Popular Mobilization Forces in Iraq the same day.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nIran subsequently announced the suspension of commercial flights in Tehran and in the country's western and central areas. At Imam Khomeini International Airport in Tehran, loudspeakers reportedly informed passengers of the situation. Normal flight operations were later restored, according to Iranian authorities. Several airlines diverted their aircraft away from Iranian airspace; at least eight flights were rerouted. State media in Iran announced the temporary suspension of flights across the country, a restriction lifted later that morning. Details regarding the scope and impact of the attack remain unclear. \nIranian media reported that no casualties or damage had occurred. Iran's semi-official Tasnim news agency posted a video of a nuclear facility in Isfahan which did not show any damage or signs it had been hit. The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed that no damage has occurred to Iran's nuclear sites.\n\n\n== Analysis ==\nAccording to an analysis by The Jerusalem Post, the attack, strategically close to a nuclear site, was designed to send a deliberate message: that Israel has the capability to target more critical sites but chose restraint at this time. This approach demonstrated Israel's readiness to defend its interests whilst also signaling to Iran the potential for more severe action, thereby maintaining a balance of deterrence without provoking an immediate escalation into a broader conflict.\nThe BBC likewise noted that a calculated strike (which took place on Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's 85th birthday) on military targets associated with Iran's previous attack on Israel demonstrated the IDF's capabilities, including the capability of not using them in full. \nHaaretz opined that the strike was lackluster and muted, a placeholder measure demonstrative of Netanyahu's lack of strategy,  and a diversion from the primary issue of the Israel-Gaza War and the rescue of Hamas' hostages.\nThe New York Times gauged the limited strike as smaller than expected, which Iranian officials downplayed and indeed did not even ascribe to Israel, and that there was still room for miscalculation. The Wall Street Journal also noted that whilst the immediate escalatory spiral had been stopped, the fundamental dynamic between Israel and Iran remained, and that its new situation had unclear red lines.\n\n\n== Reactions ==\nThe Israel Defense Forces told CNN that they \"do not have a comment at this time.\" A senior United States official confirmed that Israel had conducted a strike and noted that the US was notified by Israel in advance of the operation. An Iranian official told Reuters that the explosions were due to the activation of Iran's air defense systems, and added that there had been no missile attack on Iran.\nIsrael minister of national security Itamar Ben-Gvir described the attack as \"feeble\" or \"lame\" on Twitter. BBC security correspondent Frank Gardener labeled the attack as \"limited, almost symbolic\".\nAustralia advised its citizens to leave Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories given that the security situation could deteriorate quickly, and the US limited the travel of its embassy personnel to metropolitan regions for similar reasons.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n2023 Iran drone attacks\nIsrael–Hamas war\nIsrael–Hezbollah conflict (2023–present)\nIran–Israel proxy conflict\nIranian seizure of the MSC Aries\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Iva Mabelle Miller (June 15, 1880 – December 5, 1951) was an American physician and medical missionary in China. She was medical director of a hospital in Tianjin (Tientsin) from 1909 to 1923, and later worked mainly on health education and public health projects, in China and in the United States.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nMiller was born in LaSalle County, Illinois, the daughter of Frederick Lee Miller and Lorena Sprague Miller. She graduated from Wesleyan University and trained as a physician at the Chicago College of Medicine and Surgery (1906). During a furlough in 1924, she studied at Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health. Her twin brother Ira also became a physician. \n\n\n== Career ==\n\nMiller interned at the Frances Willard National Temperance Hospital in Chicago, and was a resident at the Methodist Deacon Hospital in Spokane, Washington. She went to China in 1909, as a medical missionary under the auspices of the Methodist Episcopal Church. She was director of the Isabella Fisher Hospital at Tianjin until 1923; in her last years in China, she worked in the School Hygiene department of the Council on Health Education in Shanghai, and was acting director of the council in 1928. \"Health is positive! It is courage, hope, joy and achievement!\" she wrote of her work in 1928. \"The World War has taught us that the future of world civilization lies in the preservation of the child life of the world.\"\nMiller spoke about her work in China to American audiences, during furloughs in the United States in 1915 and in 1922. From 1932 to 1934 she was director of the Child Health Demonstration of Harlan County, Kentucky, a program sponsored by the International Save the Children Fund of America. She also spoke to professional and community groups about child health topics. She moved to New York in 1934, where she was assistant to the director of the American Women's Hospitals, a charity that supported medical facilities for women and children in several Southern states. \nIn 1947 Miller opened a practice in Indianapolis, specializing in arthritis and phlebitis care. She was a member of the Business and Professional Women's Club.\n\n\n== Publications ==\n\"Medical Work in Tientsin\" (1917)\n\"The Health of the School Child\" (1925)\n\"Health Education in China\" (1925)\n\"Beginnings of Health Education in China\" (1926)\n\"A Health Campaign in South China\" (!928)\n\"Amoy Seeks Health\" (1928)\n\n\n== Personal life and legacy ==\nMiller died in 1951, at the age of 71, in Indianapolis, Indiana. Ninety of her photographs from Tianjin are in the Hoover Institution Library and Archives at Stanford University.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Park Soo-il (Korean: 박수일; April 25, 1944 – January 10, 2008) was a South Korean former footballer and football manager who played as a forward. He was known for his bold breakthrough and constant mobility to create decisive opportunities during his time as a player. In addition, during his tenure as head coach of Soongsil University, he coached several star players such as Choi Jin-cheul and is largely credited for converting Choi Jin-chul from a forward to a defender.\n\n\n== Club career ==\nPark was born in Keiki-dō during the Japanese colonial period and he would begin his football career by playing in Hanyang Technical High School and played in a friendly match between Thailand that won the 1962 AFC Youth Championship and Hanyang Technical High School. In 1964, he joined Goldstar Textile, and in 1965, he scored a hat-trick against the Army Quartermaster Football Club in the 1965 Korean National Semi-Professional Football League, helping the team win the championship together. During his career with Goldstar Textile, he would enroll in Kookmin University and would pursue his studies around the same time. In 1966, he participated in the JP Cup China-Japan Football Tournament as a member of the Seoul Selection Team, where he scored a goal against the Republic of China's Juguang team, helping his team win the tournament. He then participated in the OB All-Star Game for Hanyang Technical High School and Dongbuk High School in the same year.\nHe later joined the ROK Marine Corps in 1967 and was discharged from the Marine Corps in 1969 and transferred to the Korea Exchange Bank in 1970 by the Exchange Bank Football Council, where he scored against Singapore's military-police joint team and Japan's youth national team in the Southeast Asia tour. He also scored the equalizer in the third overtime against Korea Development Bank in the quarterfinals of the Korean National Football Championship that year, but the team failed to advance to the finals after losing to the Republic of Korea Army in the quarterfinals. Later, in the 1971 Prime Minister's Cup Finance Club Football Tournament, he scored several points to help the team win the tournament, but he was warned by the Korea Business Football Federation for his impolite behavior by arguing with spectators in the stands during a match against Seoul Trust Bank during the spring tournament of the National Business Football Federation.

        "content": "Lengua estofado (lit. \"tongue stew\" in Spanish), sometimes known as lengua estofada or simply lengua, is a Filipino dish consisting of braised beef tongue in a sweet sauce with saba bananas, potatoes, or mushrooms. It originates from the similar Spanish and Latin American dish estofado de lengua but differs significantly in the ingredients. The dish is prominent in the regional cuisines of the Kapampangan, Ilonggo, and Negrense people. It is usually prepared for Christmas dinner and other special occasions.\n\n\n== Description ==\nRecipes of lengua estofado are extremely variable, ranging from preparations very similar to the original estofado de lengua to versions which use ingredients unique to the Philippines. A unifying similarity between the different lengua estofado recipes in the Philippines is that they use soy sauce, vinegar, and sugar for the sauce, which are absent in the Spanish versions.\nThe most distinctive variant of lengua estofado is found in Ilonggo cuisine in the Western Visayas islands. It typically uses a sauce made with muscovado or brown sugar, coconut vinegar (or palm wine, tubâ), black pepper, soy sauce, bay leaves, anisado wine, onion, and garlic. Its ingredients, other than beef tongue, typically includes potatoes, pineapple slices, and uniquely, saba bananas. Other lengua estofado recipes are closer to the Spanish version. Instead of bananas, they typically add mushrooms, as well as carrots, olives, paprika, and optionally, white wine. The sauce can optionally be tomato-based, in which case its preparation becomes very similar to other Filipino dishes like estofado and caldereta. The beef tongue component can be switched with meat, including beef, goat, pork, or even chicken.\n\n\n== Other variants ==\nLengua pastel from Pampanga is a variant that is cooked in a creamy white sauce with button mushrooms and young corn kernels. In Bulacan, lengua Sevillana or lengua a la Sevillana is a variant which adds sherry or red wine to the sauce and is typically eaten with bringhe.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMenudo (stew)\nMechado\nCaldereta\nChicken pastel\n\n\n== References ==",

The New York Times found the film to be \"an exercise in intellectualized scab-picking\" and its subject \"repellant\".  Variety described Caniba as \"a film made for post-screening debates on the liberal-minded documentary circuit, though what, if any, commercial potential distributors might see in it is another question.\"  RogerEbert.com stated that the film was \"undeniably fascinating\", but had some reservations about its approach: \"Victims too rarely get to tell their stories.  I don't know that what we need right now is to sympathize with monsters.\"  Slant Magazine, in a three-out-of-four-star review, praised the film's \"fundamental openness toward its subject by creating free space for engagement and contemplation\", but felt that it \"broaches ethical questions that it lacks the resources to address\" and that \"With no push to either interrogate or contextualize the man, the cool ethnographer’s detachment of the film comes to take on a sensationalistic tenor.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCaniba at IMDb \nCaniba at AllMovie",

Lopo Furtado de Mendonça, 1st Count of Rio Grande and 12th Lord of the Majorat of Quarteira (1661 – 20 November 1730) was a Portuguese nobleman and naval officer.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHe was born in 1661 to Jorge Furtado de Mendonça, mestre de campo of the Algarve and admiral of the fleet of the Junta do Comércio.\n\n\n== Portuguese Navy ==\nHe had several titles, such as commander of Borba in the Order of Avis and of Loulé in the Order of Santiago, captain of the Royal Guard, field marshal, counselor of the Council of War, count of Rio Grande, by jure uxoris, grande of Portugal, colonel of the Navy Regiment and vice admiral.\nHe fought, very young, in Mazagan, having also commanded the Terço da Armada Real. He embarked several times in the coast guard squadron. He was nominated admiral in 1702. In 1704, he fought against Spain, war in which he reached the rank of field marshal, even though he was already an admiral.\nIn 1716 he commanded a squadron that went to the Mediterranean Sea to fight the Turks, who were not seen. He returned to the Mediterranean in 1717, where he won the Battle of Matapan. In this battle, the ship Nossa Senhora da Conceição served as his flagship, the second commander of the fleet, the Count of São Vicente, had as his flagship the powerful Nossa Senhora do Pilar, other ships: Nossa Senhora da Assunção, Nossa Senhora das Necessidades, Rainha dos Anjos, commanded by Infante Francisco, São Lourenço and the Santa Rosa. There were around 500 cannons.\nDespite the superiority and excellence of the Portuguese fleet over the others in the coalition, Pope Clement XI issued a brief in which he handed over command of the coalition to the Lieutenant General of the French Navy, Bellefontaine, who hurried to personally deliver a copy of that brief to the Portuguese Admiral.\nWith the exception of the Portuguese, all the other fleets hurried to retreat to the coast upon sighting the Turks. Bearing this in mind, the French Admiral, sent a delegate of his on board of the Portuguese flagship with the mission of removing the Portuguese fleet. That delegate, upon realizing that the Portuguese Admiral was not willing to obey such nonsense, reminded the Count of Rio Grande that the brief obligated him to strict obedience.\n\nIt was then that Lopo Furtado de Mendonça remembered putting the copy of the brief, received from the hands of Bellefontaine, in his pocket. He took it out of his pocket, crumpled it into a ball, put it in the mouth of a bronze cannon, ordered the signal fire to be raised and exclaimed to the Frenchman, appalled:\"Go tell to the Bailli de Bellefontaine that I sent the Pope's brief to the Turks through the mouths of my cannons!\"\nAfter an hour of fighting, the Turkish fleet was put to flight. The Portuguese had won, alone, the Battle of Matapan. When the Portuguese ships, on their return, anchored in the port of Messina, to rest the garrisons and repair the damage, they were cheered upon disembarking, with the people of the riverside rushing with gifts to the sailors.\n\nKing John V showered him with benefits, nominating him Count of Rio Grande, by the bond of the title to which his wife was entitled for being the daughter of General Francisco Barreto de Meneses, who had expelled the Dutch from Pernambuco, and who, having received this title, had never used it. King John V also gave him the position of Chief Accountant of the Kingdom.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nIn addition to the daughters they professed, they had a son: José António Barreto Furtado de Mendonça e Meneses, captain from the Alentejo, born in 1688 and died unmarried on 2 August 1707.\nHe died in Lisbon, after a few days of illness, at 11:00 p.m., on 20 November 1730. The Gazeta de Lisboa described his career and funeral:\n\n\"...having served this Crown for close to sixty years, partly in the Stronghold of Mazagan, partly in the Fleets of the Coast, in the expedition of Corfu, and in the campaigns of the last war. He was buried in Chagas de Cristo Church, Chapel of the Seamen, where all the Nobility of the Court attended his funeral.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===",

It was preceded by one single.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe album was announced on April 18, 2024, with a release date set for May 31, by Verve Records. With the announcement came the lead single, \"Raat Ki Rani\", which Aftab said was about \"a person whose allure, magnetism, and charisma floats through a beautiful evening garden party.\" The song centers the piano, and marks Aftab's first use of Auto-Tune in her music. It was named after cestrum nocturnum, a flowering plant also known as night-blooming jasmine.\n\"Raat Ki Rani\" came with a music video directed by actor Tessa Thompson, her directorial debut, and produced by Kishori Rajan, the head of Thompson's production company Viva Maude. The video features two women either falling in love or \"starring in a Lynchian perfume commercial.\" Per Thompson, the video is \"about the fantasies we have sometimes about people we encounter. It's about the way we come to life in dark spaces. It's about how intoxicating something in bloom can be. I don't want to say much more because I am curious what people see in it. But it is also an homage to some films I am deeply influenced by.\" Thompson's father, Marc Anthony Thompson, contributed to the album under the alias Chocolate Genius, Inc.\n\n\n== Live ==\nWith the announcement of the album, Aftab also announced tour dates for June 2024 through January 2025 in Europe and the United States, including six shows in September and October supporting Khruangbin.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Luigi Capranica del Grillo (13 November 1821 – 7 January 1891) was an Italian novelist, dramatist, and patriot.\nHe was born in Rome to local nobility: his father was a descendant of the Marquis del Grillo through his father, and through his mother, principessa Flaminia of the Odescalchi family. While his parents intended him to study for advancement in the curia, he instead joined the guardia nobile of the pope. However, he developed interest as a writer and in 1848, he wrote La Congiura dei Fieschi and then Francesco Ferruccio. Soon Rome was immersed in revolution, and in 1849, Luigi fought alongside the Republicans against the French and Papal forces. With the defeat of the Roman republic, and the restoration of Pope Pius IX, he was briefly jailed, released, wounded in a duel, then exiled. Luigi made his way to Venice where he stayed over a decade. But often his revolutionary leanings led to renewed exiles. During this exile, he wrote the play Vittoria Accoramboni. Ultimately he moved to Milan in 1861 where he stayed for 3 decades and married the Contessa Maria Obniski. \nIn Venice, he had begun writing poetry and novels. The latter were mainly based on Italian agents in history: Giovanni dalle Bande Nere (1857), Congiura di Brescia, Fra Paolo Sarpi (1863), Donna Olimpia Panfili (1868), Papa Sisto (1877), Re Manfredi (1884), Maria Dolores, Le donne di Nerone (1890), and I Moderni Farisei.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Fulmine (\"Lightning\") was the Kingdom of Italy′s first destroyer. Commissioned into service in the Italian Regia Marina (Royal Navy) in 1900, she served in the Italo-Turkish War and World War I. She was stricken in 1921 and scrapped.\n\n\n== Design, construction, and commissioning ==\nFulmine was laid down at the Cantieri navali Odero (Odero Shipyard) in Sestri Ponente, Italy, on 14 July 1896. She was launched on 4 December 1898 and completed in October 1900. She was commissioned on 26 October 1900.\nDesigned by the inspector general of the Corps of Naval Engineering (Italian: Corpo del genio della Marina), Ernesto Martinez, Fulmine was inspired by British and German designs of the time. As Italy's first destroyer, Fulmine was an experimental ship with mediocre characteristics; while her armament was quite suitable, her hull had structural problems which prevented her from achieving the maximum speed of 26.5 knots (49.1 km/h; 30.5 mph) envisaged for her. However, designing and building the ship gave both Italian naval architects and the local shipbuilding industry experience in the design and construction of destroyers, a new ship type in the 1890s.\nFulmine quickly was surpassed by subsequent Italian destroyer classes, first the six-ship German-built Lampo class and then the Italian-built six-ship Nembo and 11-ship Soldato classes. During her service, however, her armament — originally five 57 mm/43-caliber guns and three 356 mm (14 in) torpedo tubes — was partially modernized, ultimately becoming one Cannon 76/30 Model 1915 gun, three 57 mm/43 guns, and two 356 mm (14 in) torpedo tubes.\n\n\n== Service history ==\n\n\n=== 1900–1910 ===\nBefore 1910, the Italian physicist Domenico Pacini used Fulmine for a series of experiments to study the ionization of air.\n\n\n=== Italo-Turkish War ===\nFulmine′s first opportunity to participate in combat operations came in the Italo-Turkish War, which began on 29 September 1911 with the Kingdom of Italy′s declaration of war on the Ottoman Empire. On 10 April 1912 Fulmine, the armored cruisers Carlo Alberto and Marco Polo, the auxiliary cruisers Città di Catania and Città di Siracusa and the torpedo boat Alcione bombarded Zuwarah, a smuggling center for war materials for Ottoman troops on the coast of Ottoman Tripolitania, which was followed by a fake amphibious landing simulated by the steamers Hercules, Sannio, and Toscana.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\nWorld War I broke out in 1914, and the Kingdom of Italy entered the war on the side of the Allies with its declaration of war on Austria-Hungary on 23 May 1915. At the time, Fulmine was not operational and was temporarily assigned to the 5th Destroyer Squadron, which also included the destroyers Aquilone, Borea, Espiro, Nembo,and Turbine. By 1915, she was of antiquated design and limited military value, and she spent the war engaged primarily in escort duties and antisubmarine warfare.\nDuring one escort operation Fulmine was involved in an incident that demonstrated problems that existed in the system the Allies had adopted for escorts in the Mediterranean Sea. The agreement between the Regia Marina, French Navy, and British Royal Navy divided the Mediterranean into areas of responsibility for each of navies, within which the escort of ships in transit was the responsibility of the navy that had jurisdiction over that area. While escorting the steamer Minas, loaded with troops and bound from Naples, Italy, to Thessaloniki, Greece, Fulmine reached the limit of Italy's escort zone about 200 nautical miles (370 km; 230 mi) east of Malta, where a British warship should have taken over the escort. Due to a mix-up, however, no British ship met Minas. Continuing her voyage unescorted, Minas was torpedoed by the Imperial German Navy submarine U-39 and sank at 36°25′N 018°24′E with the loss of 870 men on 15 February 1917.\nBy late October 1918, Austria-Hungary had effectively disintegrated, and the Armistice of Villa Giusti, signed on 3 November 1918, went into effect on 4 November 1918 and brought hostilities between Austria-Hungary and the Allies to an end. World War I ended a week later with an armistice between the Allies and the German Empire on 11 November 1918.\n\n\n=== Post-World War I ===\nFulmine was stricken on 15 May 1921. She subsequently was scrapped.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPhoto of Fulmine moored at La Spezia on Italian Wikipedia",

        "content": "Eliza Fanthome (born 1845) was a British woman best known for surviving the Indian Rebellion of 1857 as a girl. \n\n\n== Life ==\nEliza Fanthome was born to the Christian Anglo-French district clerk James Fanthome. \nIn 1857, she experienced the Siege of Cawnpore. During the Satichaura Ghat massacre, she was abducted by a private individual. Being the captive of a private individual, she avoided the Bibighar massacre. She later testified that she was held as a slave by the Muslim Meerun Jan, who subjected her to rape and forced her to live as his slave, ioundee, where she was forced to cook for him and wash the feet of his wife. She also testified that he forced her to live with the brother of one Meanjon Syed for about one year. \nThe British freed Eliza Fanthome from slavery by hiring two informers to rescue her from the rebel camp where she was being held, a task they succeeded in. Meerun Jan was never captured by the British, but Meanjon Syed was sentenced for complicity to fourteen years of deportation to the Andamans. \nShe was one of a few survivors of the Satichaura Ghat massacre. A handful of women were taken prisoner by individual captors, avoided being placed in the Bibighar, and therefore also avoided the Bibighar massacre. Of these known survivors were Ulrica Wheeler, Amelia Horne, the drummers wives Eliza Bradshaw and Elizabeth Letts, and Eliza Fanthome, who was twelve years old at the time.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nIn 1896, J.F. Fanthome published the novel Mariam: A Story of the Indian Mutiny of 1857 about a Christian woman, Mariam, and her daughter Ruth, during the rebellion.\nHe claimed the story was based on the notes of Ruth and that he had not published the novel until after the death of Mariam in 1892. The novel was likely based on the story of Eliza Fanthome: J.F. Fanthome was married to Winifred, daughter of Marie Le Maistre, who died in 1892, and was the paternal aunt of Eliza Fanthome. \nThe novel Mariam: A Story of the Indian Mutiny of 1857 was the basis of Ruskin Bond's A Flight of Pigeons, who in turn was the inspiration for the Hindi film Junoon (1978).\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Styphelia sulcata is a species of flowering plant in the heath family Ericaceae and is endemic to a small area in the south of Western Australia. It is a low, compact shrub with narrowly egg-shaped leaves and white flowers arranged singly in leaf axils.\n\n\n== Description ==\nStyphelia sulcata is a low, compact shrub that typically grows up to about 40 cm (16 in) high and wide. The leaves are narrowly egg-shaped and pressed against the stem, 4.0–8.2 mm (0.16–0.32 in) long and 0.8–1.6 mm (0.031–0.063 in) wide on a petiole 0.3–0.6 mm (0.012–0.024 in) long, and with a fine, but brittle point on the tip. Both surfaces of the leaves are more or less glabrous, the lower surface strongly grooved. The flowers are sessile and mostly arranged singly in leaf axils,with bracts 2.0–2.5 mm (0.079–0.098 in) long and bracteoles 2.8–3.5 mm (0.11–0.14 in) long at the base. The sepals are narrowly egg-shaped, 4.8–5.5 mm (0.19–0.22 in) long and hairy. The petals are white and joined at the base to form a more or less cylindrical tube 3.2–4.2 mm (0.13–0.17 in) long and 0.9–1.1 mm (0.035–0.043 in) wide, the lobes 3.2–4.5 mm (0.13–0.18 in) long and densely hairy on the inner surface. Flowering has been observed between May and June and the fruit is a more or less cylindrical drupe 3.2–4 mm (0.13–0.16 in) long and 1.2–1.6 mm (0.047–0.063 in) wide.\n\n\n== Taxonomy and naming ==\nStyphelia sulcata was first formally described in 2019 by Michael Hislop and Caroline Puente-Lelievre from specimens collected near Cascade in 2002. The specific epithet (sulcata) means \"furrowed\", referring to the lower surface of the leaves.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nThis species grows in sandy soils in mallee woodland near Cascade and Condingup in the Mallee bioregion in the south of Western Australia.\n\n\n== Conservation status ==\nStyphelia sulcata is listed as \"Priority One\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions, meaning that it is known from only one or a few locations where it is potentially at risk.\n\n\n== References ==",

The canal can be considered as a historical place, owing the point where it confluence Khlong Pla Mo (Thai: คลองปลาหมอ, pronounced [kʰlɔ̄ːŋ plāː mɔ̌ː]) was the place where the promoters planned to overthrow the power of Khun Worawongsathirat, the usurper Ayutthaya ruler, led by Khun Pirenthorathep (later King Maha Thammaracha), assassinated him while traveling to capture white elephant at Lopburi via royal barge procession.\nIn addition, Wat Chao Ya, the canalside Buddhist temple was also believed to be the place where Khun Worawongsathirat consort, Lady Si Sudachan, fled to shore and was slayed along with her daughter who born to Khun Worawongsathirat.\nWhen the rebellion was successful, the promoters invited Prince Thianracha to be King Maha Chakkraphat, the 15th king of Ayutthaya. These events took place in 1548.\nKhlong Sa Bua and Khong Pla Mo had all been main transportation routes since the early Ayutthaya period. Although nowadays they have been greatly reduced in importance. Wat Chao Ya is currently just an abandoned historical site.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nKhlong Sa Bua is an area situated off the Ayutthaya island (downtown Ayutthaya) to northwest about 5 km (3.1 mi).

It has an area of 4.65 km2 (2,906 rai).\nThe area is quasi-rural, Khlong Sa Bua is a main watercourse.\nBaan Thai Ayutthaya Khlong Sra Bua, the elegant traditional Thai house is commonly used as filming location and restaurant for tourists, lies just outside the Khlong Sa Bua boundary in the neighbouring Lumphli subdistrict.\n\n\n== Administration ==\nKhlong Sa Bua is administered by the Subdistrict Administrative Organization (SAO) Khlong Sa Bua (องค์การบริหารส่วนตำบลคลองสระบัว) and some of it depends on city of Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya.\nThe seal of SAO Khlong Sa Bua features three lotuses rose from the water.\nThe area also consists of six administrative muban (village).\n\n\n== Population ==\nIn 2021 it had a total population of 4,147 people (2,018 men, 2,129 women) in 1,201 households.\nMore than half of the population works as farmers.\n\n\n== Places ==\nWat Klang Khlong Sa Bua\nWat Chao Ya (ruin)\nWat Si Pho\nWat Phra Ngam (known as \"portal of time\")\nWat Takrai (ruin)\nWat Chong Klom (ruin)\nWat Kruttharam\nWat Mae Nang Pluem (ruin)\nWat Intharam\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "The Acadian Society of New Brunswick (French: Société de l'Acadie du Nouveau-Brunswick) (SANB) is a French Canadian advocacy organization representing Francophones and Acadians in the province of New Brunswick.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Société de l'Acadie du Nouveau-Brunswick (SANB), known in English as the Acadian Society of New Brunswick, is an organization representing Francophones and Acadians in New Brunswick, the only bilingual province in Canada and the largest Acadian population in the country. The organization, which has received federal funding, holds an annual general meeting. Presidency for SANB runs on democratic elections, and as of April 2024 there is a current election underway with three candidates.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn June 1973, the Société des Acadiens du Nouveau-Brunswick (SANB) was created in Shippagan, resulting from a meeting held the year prior. The following year, the organization became involved in efforts made to revive the French language in Moncton. In 1979, the organization was involved in the holding of a conference to discuss the creation of an Acadian province separated from New Brunswick, with proposals being made as early as 1976. During the 1980 Quebec referendum, SANB expressed support for voting 'yes', with president Jean-Claude Leblanc making an interpretation of the status quo being favored by those voting 'no', stating that it \"leads directly, quickly and undeniably to the assimilation of francophones and their disappearance in the more-or-less long term.\" In 1986, SANB participated in discussions regarding compensations for the Expulsion of the Acadians.\nSANB was previously based in Moncton. In 1980, the organization relocated to Petit-Rocher following a meeting held in Memramcook. In 1988, the organization was renamed to the Société des Acadiens et des Acadiennes du Nouveau-Brunswick (SAANB) and renamed again in 2008 to the Société de l'Acadie du Nouveau-Brunswick.\n\n\n=== Opposition to anti-bilingualism ===\nThe organization has expressed a strong opposition to anti-bilingualism, with then-president Michel Doucet labelling members of the Confederation of Regions Party, a now-defunct right-wing, anti-bilingual political party, as \"extremists\" in 1989. In 1998, the organization sent a complaint to the New Brunswick Judicial Council regarding one of their francophone judges for remarks she made towards Acadians during a court session in Tracadie, resulting in the judge being fired the following year.\nIn 2002, the Government of New Brunswick's proposition of Bill 17, related to the healthcare system, led to CANB filing a civil suit against them, stating \"nothing in the bill promises that all health services will be available in French.\" In 2022, SANB criticized the Progressive Conservative Party of New Brunswick for adding two new MLAs from the People's Alliance. The added politicians, Kris Austin and Michelle Conroy, have been described as expressing anti-bilingual opinions. Later that year, calls were made to Premier Blaine Higgs for the removal of Austin from an Official Languages Act examination group by multiple organizations including SANB. The organization also made further calls for a review to be conducted regarding the leadership of Higgs.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "The Collegiate Commons is a Collegiate Network-affiliated online student publication serving Indiana University-Indianapolis and the surrounding community. It is published by Collegiate Commons, Inc., a 501(c)(3) which aims to preserve the \"Christian intellectual and social tradition\" in higher education. The publication was launched in 2023, and its name was based off an older publication with a similar editorial stance known as The American Commons, which was founded in 2018 and started being published by Collegiate Commons, Inc. in 2024.\nThe publication also hosts online copies of historic student newspapers from the Indiana University Indianapolis extension campus (1916–1969), including the Indianapolis Student (1958–1969) and the Indiana University Onomatopoeia (1969–1971) that have not been indexed online yet by the Ruth Lilly Special Collections Archive at IUPUI.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Collegiate Commons was launched as a free online newspaper in August 2023. Initially conceived as being a voice for the consistent life ethic on the university campus, several of its early editors, reporters and advisors were involved in anti-abortion activism in the Indianapolis area and nationally. Having been launched the same month as Indiana's partial abortion ban went into effect, many early articles involved state and local responses to the new law.\nIn September 2023, the publication attracted national attention within the anti-abortion movement for exposing the identity of the owner of a Medium blog and Instagram account that published the personal information of anti-abortion activists.\nThe publication's editorial staff also joined other Christian student organizations at IUPUI in opposing Cindy Smock (\"Sister Cindy,\" known for her slogan \"Ho No Mo\" when preaching on college campuses), when she visited the campus in October 2023, stating in an editorial that \"we believe it is the duty of purportedly Christian individuals and organizations on campus to use their power of free speech and their organizing capabilities in a way that does not threaten their witness, nor the witness of other Christians to the world, and to confront those self-professed Christians who do.\"\nIn February 2024, the publication attracted national attention after publishing an article about a university-sponsored \"bondage workshop\" at IUPUI. Backlash from several community members led to the event being cancelled, and the story was subsequently picked up by local media as well as the New York Post, Breitbart, Campus Reform and others.\nThrough a Freedom of Information Act request, Campus Reform uncovered that IUPUI Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs, Dr. Eric Weldy called the publication \"illegitimate\" and requested staff members to not have any contact with the publication after the article about the bondage event was published, and that the IUPUI Office of Health and Wellness had spent more than $100 on 500 feet of nylon rope and other supplies on the event.\nThat same month, the publication attracted attention from the Indiana Daily Student for uncovering vast disparities in compensation of undergraduate student government officials at Indiana University Bloomington and Purdue West Lafayette as compared to IUPUI, despite their significantly larger size and budgets.\nLater that month, the publication published a letter to the editor criticizing Dr. Joshua W. Brown, Indiana University Bloomington professor of psychology and neuroscience, for praying over a student in front of a crowd and claiming to have healed him of \"left kidney pain\" at an event sponsored by several Christian organizations at IUPUI.\nIn April 2024, The Collegiate Commons published on opinion column supportive of the Indiana Graduate Workers Coalition, which suggested that Indianapolis students should consider the benefits of unionizing as well.\n\n\n== The American Commons ==\nThe American Commons was founded in 2018. Several of the founders were members of the American Solidarity Party or the And Campaign. The website largely published columns about national issues and their relation to the consistent life ethic, Christian Social Teaching, and Christian Democracy. It went inactive in 2022, but was restarted in 2024 by students and community advisors affiliated with The Collegiate Commons.\n\n\n== References ==",
