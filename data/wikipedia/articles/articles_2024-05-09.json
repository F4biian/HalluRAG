        "content": "Enrique Molina Soler (4 May 1904 – 15 July 1943) was a Spanish footballer who played as a midfielder for Valencia CF. Apart from football, he also played Basque pelota in Valencia, and was one of the organizers of the Volta a Peu del Mercantil Valenciano.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nEnrique Molina was born on 4 May 1904 in the Russafa neighborhood, which at that time had just been annexed to the city of Valencia, into a conservative and deeply Catholic family. It was a small district surrounded by orchards, in which his family worked and in which he began to play football, a sport that was beginning to enjoy some success in the city of Valencia.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\nFrom a very young age he stood out as an athlete and for his physical form, so at the age of 16, he joined the ranks of the now-extinct Unión Levantina. He remained there for two seasons, until 1922, when he joined Gimnástico FC, where he played alongside the likes of Silvino and Alfredo Arróniz. While there, he became the most notable midfielder in the city, standing out for his bravery on the field of play and his extraordinary ability to recover balls in the center of the field, pushing the team towards the attack with an energy never seen in those times.\nIn the summer of 1924, Molina was signed by Valencia CF, which meant greatly weakening its eternal rival, and in fact, they won the following three Regional Championships, with Molina playing a crucial role in those titles. In his first year, however, his performances were heavily affected by an illness, but he was at his best in the next nine, displaying great pride and consistency that was only interrupted in 1931 due to a knee injury and the enormous impact caused by the death of his wife, whom he had married only a year before. Molina became one of the first great players in the club's history, as he remained in the team for ten seasons, experiencing the first years of the club's professionalization in 1926, the debut in both the Copa del Rey and La Liga in its inaugural season in 1929, and the first promotion to the First Division in 1931, retiring in 1934, shortly before the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936. Together with Cirilo Amorós and Enrique Salvador, Molina formed what was known as the \"glorious media\", which achieved the first feats in national football. In 1929, with an economic crisis at the club, he agreed to reduce the fee and calmed down an attempted rebellion by the footballers against the coach.\nMolina was a very temperamental man; for instance, during his time as a referee, he assaulted a Correspondencia journalist. On another occasion, during a match in Torrero against Iberia, he was attacked with an umbrella by a spectator, and Molina, without flinching, snatched the weapon from him and ended up throwing the fan out of the stadium. He once even drove his car into the Mestalla Stadium to remove a referee who was threatened by the stands. \nAdmired by critics and caricaturists, Molina received thunderous ovations not only at Mestalla, but also in rival stadiums, notably in his farewell match in a League fixture in Vitoria-Gasteiz, when the entire audience at the Mendizorrotza stood up and paid a resounding tribute to him. In 1933, he was the subject of a tribute match, a friendly match against the Spanish national team in the Mestalla Stadium on 30 April 1933, a team for which he was permanently called up, but with which he unfairly never made his debut. In total, he played 323 games with the Valencia club.\n\n\n== Later life and death ==\nOnce he retired, Molina was able to start a small business with the little savings generated by his activity as a player.\nA Falangist since before the outbreak of the Civil War, Molina enrolled in the Blue Division as a volunteer, a militia that moved from Spain to provide support to the Army of Nazi Germany in the fight against the Soviet Union during the Second World War. He died after being attacked by cannon fire while transporting two Nazi Germany drivers on a motorcycle with a sidecar during the Siege of Leningrad on 15 July 1943. The chronicles of the time relate that he was hit by a shell and the shrapnel shattered his skull. He was buried in the Mestelevo cemetery.\nMolina's case was not the only one of a professional Spanish football player who joined the Blue Division, with Ramón Herrera, a player for Sporting de Gijón and Atlético Madrid, also going to fight in Soviet lands alongside Nazi Germany, but unlike Molina, Herrera had better luck and returned to Spain. \n\n\n== Honours ==\nValencia CF\nValencia Championship:\n\nWinners (7) 1925, 1926, 1927, 1931, 1932, 1933, and 1924\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Enrique Pardiñas y Barreiros was a Spanish sailor and sports leader who served as the second president of Real Sociedad between 1912 and 1915, and as the first president Unión Española de Clubes de Fútbol (UECF), the forerunner federation of the current Royal Spanish Football Federation between 1912 and 1914.\n\n\n== Sporting career ==\n\n\n=== Athlete ===\nAt the end of the 19th century, Pardiñas was a member of the Spanish colonial administration of Cuba (acting secretary), and at the beginning of the 20th century, he was a member of San Sebastián's high society. He stood out in the sport of sailing, both as a sailor, winning the first edition of the Argentine Yacht Club Cup in 1908, but also as a skipper, federator, and mainly as commodore of the Real Club Náutico de San Sebastián, a position he still held when he died in 1920.\n\n\n=== Presidencial mandates ===\nIn 1912, Pardiñas was appointed as the second president of Real Sociedad, replacing Adolfo Sáenz. As president of this club, he was one of the promoters and founders of the Unión Española de Clubes de Fútbol (UECF), a federation founded by the dissidents of the FECF, the current Royal Spanish Football Federation, following a disagreement about the venue of the 1913 Copa del Rey. He was elected president of this entity at the constitution assembly of this federation, held in San Sebastián at the end of December 1912. The Gipuzkoan teams joined it, with the notable exception of Racing de Irún, a part of the Catalans with FC Barcelona at the helm, and some clubs from other regions.\nDuring 1913, a great rivalry arose between both federations, and two parallel Copa del Rey tournaments were held in March 1913, an \"official\", organized by FECF in Madrid, and an \"unofficial\", organized by the UECF in Barcelona. Pardiñas' personal friendship with Queen Victoria Eugenia made it possible for the queen to \"donate\" a Cup for the Copa del Rey sponsored by this federation, and likewise, Pardiñas managed to get King Alfonso XIII to grant the title of \"Royal\" to the UECF, before he did the same as compensation to the FECF. This royal recognition gave the UECF a certain prestige and made it a serious rival to the FECF, although the number of clubs affiliated with it was considerably smaller. In the Copa del Rey sponsored by the UECF, Real Sociedad, chaired by Pardiñas himself, faced FC Barcelona in a double match for the title, and after drawing in both games, FC Barcelona won in the final third tiebreaker match. \nThe UECF tried to gain recognition from FIFA by holding an international match against a French XI, held on 25 May 1913 at the Amute in Hondarribia, which ended in a 1–1 draw and which is now considered to have been the first-ever (unofficial) match of a Spanish national team. The UECF's attempt to affiliate with FIFA caused the international federation to issue an ultimatum to the two Spanish federations forcing them to merge if they wanted to be recognized by FIFA. During the summer of 1913, arduous negotiations were carried out between the two federations that finally led to the creation of several regional federations and the new Royal Spanish Football Federation in September 1913. The Royal Spanish Union of Clubs, although without activity since September, it was not officially dissolved until 5 February 1914. The RFEF recognized the title obtained by Barcelona in the UECF tournament as part of the Cup's record, as the 1913 UECF Copa del Rey. \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Somalia–Syria relations refer to foreign relations between Somalia and Syria. Diplomatic relations were established when Syria opened its embassy in Mogadishu on 13 December 1964. Both nations are Arab League & Organisation of Islamic Cooperation members and maintain relations.\n\n\n== History ==\nDiplomatic relations between Iraq and Somalia was established on 13 December 1964, relations historically and currently are mutually affable. \nSomalia strongly opposed Israel's attack on Egypt & Syria in the Six-Day War in 1967 and their occupation of the Golan and is of the opinion that the Golan is sovereign Syrian territory. Conversely, Syria strongly supports the territorial integrity of Somalia and rejects the legitimacy of Somaliland, considering it to be Somali territory.\nSomalia also supported the Arab coalition in the Yom Kippur War in which Syria was the main belligerent on the Golan front.\nIn turn, Syria supported Somalia in the Ogaden War, sending a small expeditionary infantry force to assist Somalia's war effort even receiving President Siad Barre on a state visit to Damascus in 1977, despite Syria's exceptionally close relationship with the Soviet Union. During the latter half of the Cold War, President Hafez al-Assad viewed Somalia with some caution as Somalia had a very close relationship with Iraq, as Hafez and Iraq's President Saddam Hussein were vying for influence regionally and within the Ba'ath Party and both leaders despised each other.\nWhen the Somali government collapsed in 1991, Syria received many Somali refugees and extended privileges such as state-subsided healthcare to the refugees. \nNotably, Somalia did not fully cut relations with Syria as a result of the civil war in Syria unlike many other Arab or Muslim countries, merely temporarily vacating their embassy. In fact, relations are still warm between Somalia and Syria on account of Syria's past stances of Somalia, particularly Syria's support of Somalia in the Ogaden War and the government's positive reception of Somali refugees. Somalia's embassy on occasion sends diplomatic dispatches to affirm Somalia's support for Syria.\nThere are a significant amount of Syrian refugees in Somalia who are well received as they are perceived to be high skilled labourers and Somalia benefits from the additional labour force.\n\n\n== Diplomatic missions ==\nSomalia has an embassy in Damascus, and Syria maintains a non-resident embassy in Sanaa.\n\n\n== See also ==\nForeign relations of Somalia\nForeign relations of Syria\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Russian submarine Narval (Russian: Нарвал, lit. 'narwhal') was the lead ship of the Narval class of submarines of the Imperial Russian Navy. The boat was laid down in December 1911 and launched in April 1915, before undergoing sea trials and entering service in September [O.S. August] 1915. Just after being launched, Narval was inspected by Emperor Nicholas II. The submarine was built for the Black Sea Fleet, and its construction was accelerated after the outbreak of World War I. Narval took part in raiding Ottoman coal shipping along the Anatolian coast during the war, and was credited with destroying 31 ships for a total of 5,717 gross register tons (GRT), making it the second highest achieving Russian submarine in the Black Sea.\nAfter the Russian Revolution, the submarine remained in Sevastopol, where it was first captured by the Germans and then by the British and the White Army in the Russian Civil War. The British scuttled Narval and several other submarines near Sevastopol in April 1919 to prevent the Bolsheviks from taking them.\n\n\n== Design and construction ==\n\nAfter being defeated in the Russo-Japanese War, the Russian Empire began rebuilding its Navy. Initially the main focus of the naval arms programs was on the Baltic and Pacific fleets, but as tensions increased with Austria-Hungary due to the Bosnian crisis in 1908 and with Ottoman Turkey after the expansion of its navy, the Black Sea Fleet was given more attention. The 1911 naval program approved by the State Duma included the order of six submarines for the Black Sea Fleet, which ended up being three Narval-class boats and three Morzh class. The Nevsky Factory in Saint Petersburg developed the Narval class on the basis of a foreign design, the popular Holland type made by the American Holland Torpedo Boat Company. But there was a dispute in the Imperial Russian Navy before 1911 on which submarine type to purchase, the Narval class or the Morzh class that was designed by Ivan Bubnov, the chief submarine engineer of the Baltic Yard. Bubnov was supported by the Naval General Staff, while the foreign type was favored by members of the Naval Technological Committee, who argued that they needed to study foreign technological advancements. In the end, a conference led by Navy Minister Stepan Voevodskiy settled the matter by ordering three submarines of each class. \nThe Narval-class submarines were the most advanced Russian submarines at the time because unlike the rest they had crash-diving tanks for faster diving, internal bulkheads that provided more protection for the crew, and used natural flow to fill the main ballast tanks instead of pumps. A problem that arose during their construction was that the twin 1,140 horsepower (850 kW) diesel engines to power each boat had been ordered from Germany and were not delivered by the time World War I broke out, so they had to be replaced by four American-built engines that each provided 210 horsepower (160 kW). This meant that the designed 16-knot (30 km/h; 18 mph) surface speed could not be attained, and neither could the 12-knot (22 km/h; 14 mph) underwater speed. Narval had slightly different weaponry from the other boats in its class, being equipped with two Japanese 75 mm (3 in) deck guns and two 7.62 mm machine guns (the latter were installed in 1917). It also had four 450 mm (18 in) torpedo tubes and eight Dzhevetskiy torpedo-launching collars (reduced to four in 1917). It was heavier than the other two boats, having a displacement of 673 long tons (684 t) on the surface and 1,045 long tons (1,062 t) while underwater.\nConstruction of all three Narval-class submarines began in Saint Petersburg, where they were laid down in December 1911, before being transferred to the shipyards in Nikolayev for the final assembly. The engines were not delivered from the United States until January 1915. Narval was launched on 24 April [O.S. 11 April] 1915 and was inspected by Emperor Nicholas II several days later on 28 April. The submarine then carried out sea trials until August, which were accelerated to meet the demands of the war, and it was completed on 5 September [O.S. 23 August] 1915.\n\n\n== Service history ==\n\n\n=== World War I ===\nAt the time when Narval entered service with the Russian Black Sea Fleet, it was focused on disrupting the Ottoman merchant convoys transporting coal from the area of Zonguldak to Constantinople, which was the main source of fuel for the Ottoman Navy. The new Russian submarines that joined the fleet were tasked with patrolling the Anatolian coast and the entrance to the Bosporus. In December 1915 Narval experienced engine problems while on patrol near the Bosporus, and underwent repairs from January to April 1916 in Sevastopol. Its engines were modified with parts from those of unfinished AG-class submarines. Despite the engine issues, Narval and the other boats of its class became popular with Russian submarine crews. These three boats formed the 2nd Squadron of the Black Sea Submarine Brigade.\nBy late 1916, there were seven Russian submarines carrying out patrols in the Black Sea in total, which included Narval and the other boats of its class, the three boats of the Morzh class, and the submarine minelayer Krab. On 16 October 1916, Narval encountered a 4,000-ton Turkish transport that beached itself on the shore upon seeing the submarine, and destroyed it with torpedoes. The following day, it found the Turkish steamer Irmingard that also ran aground deliberately after hitting a mine, and also destroyed it. Narval destroyed a 3,000-ton steamer and multiple schooners in the Bosporus on 19 January 1917. The submarine crew tried to take one schooner that they captured to Sevastopol, but in bad weather the line connecting it to Narval was cut and it was lost at sea. After the February Revolution in 1917, the Black Sea Fleet and its submarines continued to be active as the Russian Provisional Government continued the war. Narval was still carrying out patrols near the Bosporus as of July 1917. In the autumn of 1917 all three of the Narval-class submarines underwent repairs and were put into the reserve.\nDuring the war, Narval became the second highest achieving Russian submarine in the Black Sea after Tyulen, sinking 31 ships with a total tonnage of 5,717 GRT.\n\n\n=== Russian Civil War ===\n\nAfter the October Revolution, on 9 February 1918 the Central Powers recognized Ukraine's independence and the German Army took control of Crimea by May 1918. The Central Powers wanted to divide up the ships of the Black Sea Fleet among themselves, and they were also claimed by the Ukrainian People's Republic. The crews of some ships raised the Ukrainian flag, including on the Narval. The submarine was then taken by the Germans, and after the end of the war in November 1918 the boat was acquired by the Western Allies and the White Russian forces. The British examined Narval on 26 December 1918 and decided that it was no longer seaworthy. They scuttled all three submarines of the Narval class near Sevastopol on 26 April 1919 to prevent them from being taken by the Bolsheviks.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Works ===",

        "content": "On May 3, 2024, United States Air Force serviceman Roger Fortson was fatally shot in his home by a Okaloosa County Sheriff's deputy in Fort Walton Beach, Florida.\n\n\n== Shooting ==\nPolice radio audio showed a disturbance report made on May 3, 2024, around 4.30 p.m., for a residential complex, where a deputy said: \"Don't have anything further than a male and female; it's all fourth-party information from the front desk at the leasing office\". \nBody camera footage shows an Okaloosa County Sheriff's deputy being told by a woman in a residential complex to go to Apartment 1401. The woman tells the deputy that \"two weeks ago\" when walking beside that apartment, she heard some \"yelling\" and profanities, as well as the sound of a slap, but she was not sure where that sound came from.  \nAccording to body camera footage, the sheriff's deputy arrived at Apartment 1401, and initially knocked without announcing who he is. The deputy then moves off to the side of the door, where it seems he cannot be seen from the apartment's peephole. About 30 seconds later, the deputy knocks on the door again, this time announcing: \"Sheriff’s office, open the door.\" Around 10 seconds later, the deputy knocks on the door another time, and again announces: \"Sheriff's office, open the door.\" According to Fortson's mother and girlfriend, who had been on FaceTime with him, Fortson heard a knock on his door and received no response when he asked who was at the door. His girlfriend also indicated that Fortson attempted to look through his peephole but was unable to see anyone through his peephole, and had armed himself believing that someone was breaking in.\nAccording to body camera footage, Fortson opens the door holding a gun in his right hand, with the gun held by his side and pointed downwards. As the door opens, the deputy tells Fortson to \"step back\" and immediately shoots Fortson who stepped towards the deputy instead. Five gunshots are fired. Around the time Fortson is shot, he lifts his left hand in front of his chest. Fortson falls to the floor, and it is only then that the deputy tells Fortson: \"Drop the gun!\"\nAfter the shooting, Fortson was brought to a hospital, where he died.\n\n\n== Response ==\nOn May 4, 2024, the Okaloosa County's Sheriff's Office said that the shooting occurred at an apartment after a sheriff's deputy responded to a call of a \"disturbance in progress\": \"Hearing sounds of a disturbance, [the sheriff's deputy] reacted in self-defense after he encountered a 23-year-old man armed with a gun and after the deputy had identified himself as law enforcement.\" The Sheriff's Office further said that the unnamed deputy had been put on \"paid administrative leave\". Body camera footage of the shooting was later released by the Sheriff's Office on May 9, 2024.\nOne of the family's attorney's stated that Fortson died due to officers knocking on the wrong door, and that while mistakes happen, good people own their mistakes. Benjamin Crump, who is also representing the family criticized the sheriff's account that was released prior to the video being released.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBodycam video shows Florida deputy shoot, kill Air Force Airman - footage of the shooting",

        "content": "\"Take It Easy My Brother Charles\" is a song composed by Brazilian singer and composer Jorge Ben. Released in November 1969, it is part of the studio album Jorge Ben and an EP.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThis song joins two others found on the same album that provide the genealogy of the character \"anjo\" (angel) in Jorge Ben's discography, \"Charles, Anjo 45\" and \"Descobri que Eu Sou um Anjo\". These songs refer to the story of the rebellious sailor Avelino Capitani, who participated in the Guerrilha do Caparaó and was imprisoned. After escaping from Lemos de Brito Penitentiary, he sought refuge on Morro do Livramento. With the persecution of the guerrilla fighter making headlines and becoming a topic of conversation throughout the city, Jorge Ben romanticized his story in these songs, constructing the character of the \"anjo,\" who is a vigilante.\n\n\n== Other versions ==\nA cover of this song is included in the self-titled debut album of the Brazilian band O Rappa, released in 1994.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nFeltran, Gabriel Sanctis.

        "content": "The fortress-tower of Mesía is a fortification dating from the late 13th or early 14th century, located in the village of Pobra, in the Galician municipality of Mesía. Since the 15th century, during the Ancien Régime, the jurisdiction of Mesía for the bishop of Santiago de Compostela was exercised from this castle. It was declared a Bien de Interés Cultural on November 17, 1994, by the Ministry of Culture.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe castle consisted of an inner walled tower, with exterior polygonal defenses, surrounded by a deep moat. Its current state of preservation is one of abandonment, and only part of the exterior defenses remains, which are rounded and reach a height of 18 meters at some points. The keep was much taller than the walls and likely had battlements.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe earliest historical records mentioning the castle date back to 1401, in a document by Gonzalo Díaz de Mesía, lord of this jurisdiction. Its name appears in an inscription that was on a lintel above the gate of the keep:ESTA CASA FEZO D. GONZLAVO (Gonzalvo) DÍAZ DE MESÍA E SUA MOLER M(María) PRES (Peres) Much of the castle was destroyed in 1467 during the Revolt of the Irmandiños, but upon being abandoned by them, Alonso II de Fonseca usurped ownership and restored it. In 1858, the construction was still intact, but two years later, the poet Ángel Corzo, in a personal letter, remarked:Two days ago I was in Mesía, I wanted to visit its ancient castle, and I found it destroyed by the pickaxe and the hoe of man.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBoga Moscoso, R.: Guía dos castelos medievais de Galicia, Edicións Xerais, 2003.\nSoraluce Blond, J.R.; Fernandez Fernandez, X.: Arquitecturas da provincia da Coruña, Cerceda, Frades, Mesía, Ordes, Tordoia e Trazo.

        "content": "Michael Sicklemore (born c. 1570s, died 1609) was an English gentleman, soldier and explorer. He was a colonist with the Jamestown first supply and led an unsuccessful expedition to find traces of Walter Raleigh's lost Roanoke Colony.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nIn October 1607, Sicklemore left England for the Colony of Virginia. He was a colonist with the first supply and a lieutenant in the Army. From June through September 1608, Sicklemore was one of the selected crew members on captain John Smith's boat Discovery Barge on its two expeditions throughout the Chesapeake Bay.\nIn late 1608, he was asked by captain John Smith to lead an unsuccessful expedition to find traces of Raleigh's \"Lost Colony\" at Roanoke, south into the Chowanoc country. He was accompanied by Warraskoyack tribal guides during his expedition.\nIn 1609, Sicklemore was deputized by captain John Martin to take charge at the Nansemond settlement in his absence during the Anglo-Powhatan Wars. Shortly afterwards, Sicklemore went on an expedition from the settlement in an attempt to trade for food. He was found dead within a few days' time.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "All Saints' Church is the parish church of Burythorpe, a village in North Yorkshire, in England.\nThe church sits on top of a hill, west of the village, with views in all directions.  The first church on the site was Mediaeval, described in 1848 as \"an ancient edifice with substantial buttresses\".  It was demolished in the 1850s, and replaced by a new building, designed by William and John Bownas Atkinson.  The building was grade II listed in 1966.\n\nThe church is built of limestone with a Welsh slate roof, and is in the Gothic Revival style.  It consists of a four-bay nave with a south porch, and a single-bay chancel with a north vestry.  The west front has angle buttresses, and a central buttress carrying a gabled bellcote, flanked by trefoil-headed lancet windows.  The porch has a pointed arch with a moulded surround.  In the nave are paired lancet windows, and at the east end are stepped lancets with a cinquefoil above.  Inside the church is a 12th-century tub font, and two marble wall tablets from the 1850s.  The east window, contemporary with the church, was designed by Alexander Gibbs.\n\n\n== See also ==\nListed buildings in Burythorpe\n\n\n== References ==",

He received his early education in Ratibor, and then attended the yeshivot of Hotzenplotz, Presburg, and Nikolsburg, and the University of Breslau. In 1852, he was called as rabbi to Neustadt bei Pinne, and in 1859 went to Mecklenburg-Strelitz as \"Landesrabbiner\". In addition to various articles and sermons, he published \"Geist der Hagada, Sammlung Hagadischer Aussprüche aus den Talmudim und Midraschim,\" Leipzig, 1859. This work, published by the Institut zur Förderung der Israelitischen Literatur, was intended as the first of a series, but was never continued. It may be regarded as the forerunner of the Jewish encyclopedia which he began to publish in 1862, under the title \"Realencyclopädie des Judenthums,\" of which three volumes appeared. The first part contains Biblical articles, the second Talmudic articles, and the third being supplementary. A second edition appeared in Leipzig in 1896.\nHamburger died at Strelitz-Alt on October 23, 1911.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWorks by or about Jacob Hamburger at Internet Archive",

        "content": "The Saint Petersburg Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences (Russian: Санкт-Петербургское отделение Российской академии наук), official acronym SPBRAS (more natural would be SPbB RAS, Russian: СПбО РАН) is the fourth territorial branch of the Academy established in 2023 by the Decree of the Government of Russia signed by its Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin.\nThe three earlier existing branches are the Ural, Siberian and Far Eastern ones.\nThe idea to create an additional branch was promoted by the Nobel prize laureate Zhores Alferov during many years until his death in 2019. Later, in 2022 this idea was approved by the general meeting of the Academy and finally by the Russian state authorities.\nAccording to the decision, the St. Petersburg branch should be engaged in participation and conduct of fundamental and exploratory scientific research, forecasting the main directions of development of St. Petersburg, the Leningrad Region and, to some extent, Russia as a whole from the point of view of the scientific sphere. The activities of the new branch were launched in autumn 2023. At that time the St. Petersburg branch included 187 members. As of May 2024, there were 182 members: 73 full (including 5 females) and 109 corresponding (including 11 females).\nThe elected chair of the St. Petersburg territorial branch is academician Andrey Rudskoy, a rector of the Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University personally specializing in material science. The branch comprises five joint scientific councils focusing on life sciences, natural sciences, humanities, applied industrial technologies and agriculture.\nThe office of the SPBRAS is located in the historical building (s. photo) in the Vasilyevsky Island in St. Petersburg.\n\n\n== References ==",

The type species Paleohoplias assisbrasiliensis was described in 2003, and was found in Solimões Formation in the State of Acre, Brazil, dating to Huayqueriense-Montehermoseuse (Late Miocene-Pliocene) age.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe generic name Paleohoplias is Greek for \"palaios\" which means old, and \"hoplias\", which is a closely related genus of fish in the same family Erythrinidae. The species name assisbrasiliensis is in reference to the city of Assis Brasil, which is near the type locality.\n\n\n== Classification ==\nPaleohoplias is one of four genera within the family Erythrinidae, and the only extinct genus. It is most closely related to the genus Hoplias.\n\n\n== References ==",

In 1968, he was awarded the Rome Scholarship in Architecture and studied for a year at the Accademia Britannica in Rome.  On returning to the UK, he became a lecturer at Kingston Polytechnic, later moving to the Polytechnic of the South Bank.  During this period, he wrote numerous newspaper and magazine articles on architecture, also producing illustrations for these outlets.  He also wrote books on English architecture, including The Shell Book of Cottages and The Georgian House.  Around the end of the decade, he became director of a major European research project, \"Learning from Vernacular Building and Planning\".\nIn 1984, Reid founded his own architectural firm, Richard Reid and Associates, based in Sevenoaks.  This won competitions for the masterplan of the Kleinzschocher district of Leipzig, the Bertalia-Lazzaretto District district of Bologna, and Nansha Bay in China.  His buildings, often in the postmodern style, include Finland Quay West, and Epping Civic Offices.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

According to the magazine, Medina was to become to be a great role model, which has since been confirmed by Pil. Pil's debut single \"Nattely\" was released on 9 March 2018, and the following year, on 18 October, she released the critically acclaimed EP, \"Når Du Går Herfra\". Pil released her debut album entitled, \"Kom Vi Flyver, Siger Du\" on 13 May 2022. The single \"Dronning af Månen\" was her most played number on DR up to 2023.\nPil co-wrote the Saba song Sand.\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\nIn 2021, Pil won the talent project, Karrierekanonen, at Danmarks Radio, with which a talent development course followed.

        "content": "Luis Gálvez Chipoco Stadium (Spanish: Estadio Luis Gálvez Chipoco) is a multi-purpose stadium in Barranco, Lima, Peru. It is also known as Parque Confraternidad, the name of the public park located there prior to its construction that partially served as the location of Barranco Zoo (Spanish: Zoológico de Barranco), the district's zoo from 1947 until its closure in 1970, when its animals were moved to the Parque de las Leyendas in San Miguel.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Park ===\nThe area where the stadium is currently located, located at the entrance of the district, near its limit with Miraflores, was originally a public park known as Parque Confraternidad, inaugurated in 1943 and featuring a lake. Under mayor Eduardo Núñez, who took office in 1956, the grounds for the stadium were used in festivities. From 1958 to 1966, a building at the park hosted the district's municipal library until it moved to its current premises in the district's main square.\n\n\n=== Zoo ===\nThe park's lake was located adjacent to Barranco Zoo (Spanish: Zoológico de Barranco), created in 1947 with the arrival of the animals previously part of the zoo located at the Parque de la Exposición, eventually developing into a full-fledged zoo with over 600 specimens in 1956.\nAt least two elephants were purchased from a circus by the district's municipality to form part of the zoo's collection: in 1959, it acquired six-year-old Mary Jumbo from the \"Tropicana\" circus at the Plaza Dos de Mayo—who refused to board a truck and walked from the historic centre of Lima towards the zoo—and in 1962 another elephant walked the same path, alongside a camel, and two lions, a puma and a siberian bear known as \"Chaplin\" who rode a bicycle as part of its performances. Additionally, a lioness known as \"La Reina\" arrived from Costa Rica in 1959, and two polar bears known as Karl and Hilda arrived from California on April 27, 1964.\nOther animals featured at the park included condors, hippos and sea lions in the lake, as well as jaguars and pumas. The aforementioned six-ton Mary Jumbo became well known for her calmness when being photographed alongside young visitors, as did a giant turtle originally from the exhibit at the Parque Neptuno. The zoo's collection often received donations from a number of different countries as a symbol of their friendship with Peru.\nBy the time it closed on May 15, 1970, its number of unique specimens had been reduced to around 250, with all of them moving to the Parque de las Leyendas, inaugurated in 1964.\n\n\n=== Stadium ===\n\nBoth the park and the zoo were replaced by a neoclassical stadium named after athlete and former CONSUDATLE President Dr. Luis Gálvez Chipoco (Arica; September 6, 1877 — Barranco; March 27, 1960), which was inaugurated on October 12, 1986, by then mayor Jorge del Castillo. It features a full-sized soccer field, an athletic track and a swimming pool. The park's remaining area has since become the Family Park (Spanish: Parque de la Familia), and it features an artificial lake populated by geese whose conditions have been criticised on numerous occasions.\nIn 2009, a modernised athletic track was inaugurated as part of Peru's bid to host the 2015 Pan American Games due to a design error at the renovated National Stadium.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMuseum of Contemporary Art, Lima\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "NGC 6365 is a pair of spiral galaxies in the constellation Draco. It consists of two galaxies, PGC 60174 to the south, and PGC 60171 to the north. These two galaxies are also designated respectively by the NASA/IPAC database as NGC 6365A and NGC 6365B. This pair of galaxies was discovered by German astronomer Lewis Swift in 1884.\n\n\n== NGC 6563A ==\nNGC 6563A is the northern counterpart of NGC 6563, and is a barred spiral galaxy. Its coordinates are 17h 22m 43.8s and 62° 09′ 57.9″. Its speed relative to the cosmic microwave background is 8,413 ± 4 km/s, which corresponds to a Hubble distance of 124.1 ± 8.7 Mpc (∼405 million ly).\nThe luminosity class of NGC 6365A is III-IV and it has a broad HI line. It is an active galaxy (AGN) of type Seyfert 2.\nWith a surface brightness equal to 14.00 mag/am^2, we can qualify NGC 6365A as a low surface brightness galaxy (LSB). LSB galaxies are diffuse (D) galaxies with a surface brightness less than one magnitude lower than that of the ambient night sky.\nTo date, nearly fifteen measurements not based on redshift give a distance of 111.469 ± 31.088 Mpc (∼364 million ly), which is within the values ​​of the Hubble distance.\n\n\n=== Supernova ===\nThe supernova SN 2003U was discovered in NGC 6365A on January 27, 2003, by Scottish astronomer Tom Boles. This supernova was of type Ia.\n\n\n== NGC 6563B ==\nNGC is the southern counterpart of NGC 6563, and is a spiral galaxy. However, the NASA/IPAC database and Professor Seligman indicate that it is Magellanic in type. Its coordinates are 17h 22m 43.5s and 62° 10′ 25.4″. Its speed relative to the cosmic microwave background is 7,975 ± 4 km/s, which corresponds to a Hubble distance of 117.6 ± 8.2 Mpc (∼384 million ly). The luminosity class of NGC 6365B is IV-V and it has a broad HI line. It also contains regions of ionized hydrogen.\n\n\n== Galaxy interaction ==\nThe pair of galaxies that make up NGC 6563 appear in Halton Arp's Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies under the designation Arp 30. Arp describes NGC 6365 as a spiral galaxy with an overdeveloped arm, but this has been recently confirmed by astronomers to be false. In the image used by Arp, PGC 60171 (NGC 6365B) appears to be part of PGC 60174 and to be one galaxy. But, they are actually two separate galaxies. According to redshift-based measurements, NGC 6365A is the most distant galaxy. However, given the uncertainties in the measurements, NGC 6365B could be the most distant galaxy. The image taken by the telescope at the Mount Lemmon observatory does not allow us to decide. There is no publication that is only speculative about their position and also about their interaction.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of NGC objects (6001–7000)\nAtlas of Peculiar Galaxies\nLists of galaxies\nList of supernovae\n\n\n== External links ==\nNGC 6563 at SIMBAD\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Everett Knoll Complex, also known as Everett Mound is a Hopewell site in Northeast Ohio near the unincorporated community of Everett within Cuyahoga Valley National Park. It consists of a ~16 ft (4.9 m) diameter mound directly south of Everett road and habitation sites surrounding it. \nDating from the late Hopewell period between 200 and 500 AD, the mound consists of a 2.5 ft (0.76 m) diameter pit containing a hexagonal limestone crypt topped with a layer of silty clay. Stone and copper artifacts and human and animal remains were recovered from the crypt within the mound. Pottery shards, stone artifacts, and charred animal bones recovered from the surrounding area indicate habitation. It is one of the few known Hopewell sites in northeast Ohio and is smaller than the Hopewell sites found in southern Ohio. \nThe complex was discovered in 1875 when artifacts were unearthed when building a schoolhouse. The site was excavated in detail by a team from Case Western Reserve University in 1970. \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Epping Civic Offices is a municipal building in Epping, Essex, a town in England. The building, which accommodates the headquarters of Epping Forest District Council, is a grade II listed building.\n\n\n== History ==\nAfter the Epping Union and Rural Sanitary Authority was succeeded by Epping Urban District Council in 1896, the council decided to use Epping Town Hall as its offices and meeting place. However, the company that had developed the town hall got into financial difficulties and the council had to use temporary facilities for its meetings, before relocating to Hawthorn Lodge on the opposite side of the High Street. Hawthorn Lodge continued to serve as the headquarters of the council for much of the 20th century, but ceased to be the local seat of government when the enlarged Epping Forest District Council was formed at No. 323 High Street in Epping in 1974.\nBy the late 1980s, the council needed more substantial offices. The council held a two-stage competition, judged by Piers Gough.  It received 51 entries, and the winner was Richard Reid and Associates, with a postmodern design. This incorporated the existing mid-19th century house, No. 323 High Street, which the council occupied, and an office block, built in the 1970s, which the council also occupied. Work on the new building started in 1987. Ove Arup and Partners acted as the structural engineers, and the building was completed in 1992.\nIn 2021, the council refurbished the building, removing some corridors to create open-plan offices, and creating a community hub and new meeting and conference spaces.  Following the refurbishment, the council sought to let the top floor to private companies.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe central part of the building is a three-storey office block, with a concrete frame, and brick and stone cladding.  To its south-west is a two-storey, three-bay former house, No. 323 High Street, converted into offices, and to its rear is a 1970s three-storey, rectangular office block.  The three are connected by first- and second-floor corridors, while at ground floor level there is vehicular access to the rear car park.  Attached to the front of the building is a tall red-brick tower, rectangular at ground level, but octagonal in top two stages.  The tower has a stone cornice, and minimalist clocks on four sides.  North-east of the tower is a brick arch, providing access to the reception area, with a balcony above, and stone steps providing direct access to the council chamber and its gallery.  These are in a bow-fronted section, clad in reconstituted stone, with ground floor pilasters.  Further to the north-east is a seven-bay section with two oriel windows, and then a four-bay section placed further forward, again clad in stone, containing the staff canteen and council members' room. \nAfter the building was completed a series of letters criticising the design appeared in local newspapers. However, the project won a Regional Award (East Anglia) from the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1993, and the architectural historian, Charles Jencks, described the design as a \"superb example…of contextualism\". The building was grade II listed in 2017.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "ADI Corporation (Advanced Data International) is a defunct Taiwanese manufacturing company active from 1979 to the 2000s. Its primary export was computer hardware—chiefly computer monitors—through its American subsidiary ADI Systems. For a time, it was the fifth largest monitor manufacturer in the world, with major customers including Apple, Compaq, and Optiquest.\n\n\n== History ==\nADI Corporation (an initialism for Advanced Data International) was founded in Taiwan in March 1979 by Liao Jian-cheng. The company was originally a diversified concern, manufacturing a number of disparate products, including footwear for Nike, Inc. By the time the company entered the market for computer hardware in the 1980s, ADI still had a contract with Nike to produce shoes. Its first computer-related exports were data terminals and computer monitors.\nIn 1986, Liao Jian-cheng merged ADI with his other corporation Cheng Chang Enterprises Co., Ltd. In 1987, the company went public on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. Around the same time, the company established Quimax Systems, an American subsidiary dedicated to importing the company's monitors and terminals manufactured in Taiwan. A major customer of Quimax in the 1980s was Esprit Systems, a seller of terminals that was spun off from Hazeltine Corporation within the decade. In 1989, ADI became a major shareholder in Espirit, and in 1990 the year they led a group of other Taiwanese companies in a takeover of Espirit that transformed the public American company into a privately owned venture.\nBy the turn of the 1990s, ADI was a leading manufacturer of terminals and displays in Taiwan. ADI began offering monitors under their own name starting in 1993, under the subbrand MicroScan. Major customers of ADI soon included Apple Computer, Compaq, and Optiquest.: 72 : 118  Of these customers, Compaq was by far the largest, ADI producing nearly all of their monitors in the 1990s. In November 1994, Compaq formed a joint venture with ADI to raise factories in Mexico, Brazil, and Europe to assemble and store ADI's monitors, helping reduce the travel time from Taiwan to ADI's major exports. Unit shipments increased from 1.1 million in 1993 to 1.6 million in 1994. Also in 1994, ADI piloted the production of an i486SX subnotebook, although it never came to fruition.\nIn 1998, ADI obtained the rights from Sony to sell monitors with Trinitron picture tubes, starting with the MicroScan 5GT. Around the turn of the millennium, the company began selling flat-panel monitors, chiefly LCDs.\nADI went defunct around the same time they let their American website domain name expire in December 2006.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website at the Wayback Machine (archived February 3, 1998)",

        "content": "Hiram Milton Northup (June 4, 1818 – Spring 1893) was an American businessman.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nNorthup was born on June 4, 1818, in Olean, New York. His father, Andruss Bishop Northrup, was also a banker, who died in 1892. His mother was Martha Northup, who died in 1820. Northup was of English descent.\nIn 1844, he moved to Kansas City, Missouri. There, he formed a partnership to trade with the Comanche. He later escaped to St. Louis after a mass death.\nIn St. Louis, he started a Native American trading business, which soon was shipping goods to Kansas City. He traded cloth products with Shawnee, Peoria, Piankeshaw, Pottawattami, Osage, Seneca, Sac and Fox and Cherokee peoples. He made a partnership with Silas Armstrong and Joel Walker of the Wyandot.\nAfter their partnership ended, he began a partnership with Joseph S. Chick (1828–1908) in 1844, forming Northup & Chick banking firm. On September 23, 1854, along with other Kansas City settlers, Northup & Chick helped pool US$1000 to start the Kansas City Journal-Post. The bank dissolved in July 1893.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nNorthup died in Spring 1893, at the age of 74. After Northup & Chick dissolved, it later became the NBKC Bank. In 2020, NBKC Bank had 424 employees and $150 million in net income. They originated over 20,000 mortgages with a value of $7.1 billion.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Bicycles on postal items includes bicycles on postal stationery and other postal items depicting bicycles such as postcards, first day covers and items delivered by bicycle mail. The collection of bicycles on postal items is commonly associated with collecting bicycles on stamps, or collecting the stamps and postal stationery of a specific country.\n\n\n== Definition ==\nThe definition of exactly what constitutes bicycles on postal items is open to debate. As the subject is extensive, each collector individually determines their own rules for what should be included in their collection.\nBicycles on postal items fall into one of the following categories:\n\nA piece of postal stationery depicting a bicycle. The official definition is: \"Postal stationery comprises postal matter which either bears an officially authorized pre-printed stamp or device or inscription indicating that a specific rate of postage or related service has been prepaid\".\nA stamped envelope\nA registered envelope\nA letter sheet\nA postal card (a card with an imprinted stamp or indicium signifying the prepayment of postage)\nA lettercard\nAn aerogram\nA wrapper\nA postal item which is not defined as postal stationery:\nA maximum card, that is a postcard depicting a bicycle with an affixed bicycle stamp\nA postcard depicting a bicycle with a non-bicycle stamp\nA first day cover depicting a bicycle in the design and/or on the stamp\nThe following types of material are excluded (although they may also be collected by enthusiasts): \n\nA bicycle stamp in isolation, that is without an accompanying postal item.\nA postal item with Cinderella, local, private or personal issues, i.e. unofficial stamps.\nItems with non-postal stamps, e.g. revenue stamps\nPostal items issued by non-existing/unrecognized countries and/or in excess of actual postal requirements.\n\n\n== Design ==\nIn all these cases the design includes one or more of the following elements:\n\nIt depicts a human-powered cycling machine. This includes a whole (or part of) bicycles, tricycles, unicycles, toy cycles, tandems, rickshaws, exercise/standing bicycles, etc. It excludes powered or unpowered wheelchairs and motor-driven or motor-assisted cycling machines, e.g. motorcycles, mopeds.\nIt depicts a bicycle or cyclist in a social context. For example, a cyclist in a street scene, cycling as an energy-efficient, green, mode of transport, or cycling promoting road safety.\nIt depicts a building used specifically for cycling sport, i.e. a velodrome.\nIt depicts a person notable for being a cyclist, e.g. a winner of the Tour de France, or cycling events at the Olympic Games.\nIt depicts the process of manufacturing a bicycle, or a notable bicycle manufacturer (individual or firm).\nIt depicts the word \"bicycle\" in the local language, even if the image of a bicycle is not included. The word triathlon without an image of a bicycle is excluded.\n\n\n== Depiction of bicycles on postal items ==\nSubjects depicted on bicycle postal items include:\n\nCycle sports\nIndoor\nCycle racing\nVelodromes\nOutdoor\nEvent racing, e.g. cycling to raise money for charities\nTour racing, e.g. the Giro d'Italia\nNon-sports uses\nThe history of the bicycle\nBicycle industrial manufacturing\nBicycle mail transportation and postal delivery\nBicycles for commercial delivery\nPeople transportation e.g. by rickshaw\nBicycle military use\nBicycles as toys\nBicycle tourism\nBicycles in street scenes\nBicycles to symbolize alternative, energy-efficient transport\nBicycles depicting or encouraging road traffic safety\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBicycle Philately: The home of bicycle stamps collectors\nBicycle Stamps Club\nFédération Internationale de Philatélie Postal Stationery Commission\nUnited Postal Stationery Society (USA)\nThe Postal Stationery Society (UK)",

As of 2024 she is the executive vice president of the American Geophysical Union.\n\n\n== Education and career ==\nAveryt received her bachelor's degrees in chemistry and marine science from the University of Miami. She has a master's degree from the University of Otago where she was a Fulbright Fellow who studied chemistry. She earned her Ph.D. from Stanford University in 2004 and then worked as a NOAA Sea Grant Knauss Fellow. Averyt moved to Colorado where she served as the director of the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Western Water Assessment program. She then became the associate director for science at the University of Colorado Boulder.\n\n\n== Work ==\nAveryt early research examined elemental ratios in marine barite. She was a lead author on the 2007 IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, which she worked on while she was in Colorado. She was one of the scientists who shared the 2007 Nobel Prize with Al Gore. Her work on water resources in the western United States includes explorations of water use by power plants and conditions leading to water stress. From 2017 until 2019 Averyt was the named president of the Desert Research Institute, making her the first woman to hold this position. Subsequently, she moved to the University of Nevada Las Vegas and concurrently worked for the state of Nevada on climate policy and as a climate advisor to Governor Steve Sisolak. In 2023 Averyt was appointed by the White House to serve on issues surrounding drought in the western United States, a position she held until January 2024.

He served as the head of the Russian Ecclesiastical Mission from 1928 to 1933.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nArchbishop Simon's secular name was Sergei Andreevich Vinogradov. He studied at seminary in Vladimir and later joined the Kazan Theological Academy where he met Anthony (Khrapovitsky), who was the rector of the seminary and the future Metropolitan of ROCOR. While at the academy he was tonsured a monk and took the name Simon and became a hierodeacon and later a hieromonk. After having graduated with a degree in theology in 1902 he was assigned to the Russian Ecclesiastical Mission in China. He was elevated to archimandrite in 1907.\n\n\n== Episcopacy ==\nIn the summer of 1922, Archimandrite Simon was ordained by ROCOR as the bishop of Shanghai, vicar to the Diocese of Beijing, and held this title until 1932. In 1931 upon the death of the previous head of the Russian Ecclesiastical Mission and bishop of Beijing, Metropolitan Innocent (Figurovsky), the ROCOR synod chose Simon to be his successor and elevated him to the rank of archbishop. Archbishop Simon held this title until his death in 1933 of pneumonia. He was buried in the crypt of the Church of All Martyrs in Beijing, alongside Metropolitan Innocent. Bishop Simon was in communication with the ROCOR during his episcopacy, rather than the Moscow Patriarchate.\n\n\n== References ==",

Each individual has two or four heterodynamic flagella, of equal or unequal length, emerging from a pocket in the anterior side of the cell. The cells are usually capable of extensive flexibility or metaboly, a characteristic of all spirocute euglenids. Every species of this family is phototrophic and found primarily in marine or brackish habitats, rarely in freshwater ecosystems.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Wolf (19 August 1987–2002) was a champion Chilean Thoroughbred racehorse who won the Chilean Triple Crown while undefeated, compiling a win streak of ten races, including six consecutive Group 1 wins, and was named the Chilean Horse of the Year in 1990 and 1991. According to articles by El Turf and Textual, Wolf is considered to be one of the best Chilean racehorses ever. Along with Gran Ducato, he was voted the Chilean Horse of the Decade of 1990. Wolf became known as the 'turf champion' of his home track, Club Hípico de Santiago.\n\n\n== Background ==\nWolf was a dark bay or brown horse with no markings and was bred by Haras Santa Amelia.\nWolf's sire Domineau was bred in the United States, where he spent his racing career, winning only 3 of 51 starts and $97,615, never advancing beyond the allowance level. Exported to Chile, Domineau found more success as a sire, becoming the leading sire in Chile in 1988 and 1990.\nWolf was sold at auction and purchased by trainer Hernán Miranda, who found some physical issues with Wolf's feet and returned him to his breeder. Haras Santa Amelia campaigned Wolf, with José Tomás Allende Fernández as his trainer.\n\n\n== Racing career ==\n\n\n=== In Chile (1990-1991) ===\nWolf debuted as a two-year-old on April 29, 1990, in a 1300-meter maiden race at Hipódromo Chile, which he won by five and a half lengths. A month later, he easily won the Group 3 Clásico Raimundo Valdés C. over 1600 meters, with a winning margin of nine lengths.\nWolf's third race was the Group 1 Clásico Alberto Vial Infante, also 1600 meters long. Along with being his first start at the highest level of racing, it was his first start on a yielding track, since all of this other starts were run under firm conditions. He didn't handle the yielding track well, with his trainer José Tomás Allende Fernández saying that he dropped in level on the surface. Wolf struggled in the race, but managed to defeat Mayfair by one and a quarter lengths.\nWolf returned to the races as a three-year-old in the Group 1 Clásico Nacional Ricardo Lyon, run over 2000 meters. He ran in fifth place in the early parts of the race before moving to the lead 400 meters from the finish, pulling away to win by an authoritative eight and a quarter lengths.\nA month later, Wolf ran in the Group 1 Clásico El Ensayo, one of the most important races on the Chilean calendar and first leg of the Chilean Triple Crown. Ten rivals faced Wolf, including Mayfair, who took the early lead in the 2400 meter race. Wolf ran the same way he did in the Clásico Nacional Ricardo Lyon, waiting in fifth place before making his move around the final turn. Once again, Wolf pulled away easily, winning by seven and a quarter lengths and setting a new track record of 2:23.1.\nThe Group 1 Clásico St. Leger, second leg of the Triple Crown, was Wolf's next race, run on December 1, 1990. It was his first race at a different track, Hipódromo Chile, and his first race on the dirt. The favorite for the race was Memo, then considered the best horse in training at Hipódromo Chile. The confrontation between the two colts was built up as the 'race of the century', with nearly one hundred thousand people attending the race.\nAs per his usual, Memo took the lead right out of the gates, but Wolf's jockey Luis Muñoz Ibáñez rode him much closer to the pace than usual, in third place, to avoid giving Memo too much of an advantage early on. Wolf moved into second place a little over 900 meters from the finish, and Luis Muñoz Ibáñez pushed him to stay on Memo's heels, despite so much of the 2200 meter race still being left to run. Coming into the homestretch, Wolf drew up next to Memo, and the two dug in for the final 400 meters. The two drew away from the rest of the field, by over twenty lengths. The two remained neck-and-neck until the final 150 meters, when Wolf began to open up on Memo, eventually winning by a length and a three-quarters. Afterwards, Wolf's trainer José Tomás Allende Fernández said \"This is the loveliest race I have ever seen in my life.\"\nWolf returned to Club Hípico de Santiago later that month to run in the Group 1 Gran Clásico Coronación, run over a distance of 2000 meters. He won the race by nine lengths in a \"walk\".\nThe third and final leg of the Chilean Triple Crown, the Group 1 Clásico El Derby, a 2400-meter long race at Valparaiso Sporting Club, was run February 3, 1991. Wolf was a strong favorite become the first horse since Prólogo in 1966 to win the Triple Crown, despite the return presence of Memo. Wolf performed as expected, and the race unfolded much like the St. Leger, although this time Wolf crossed the finish line five lengths ahead of Memo.\nFor his campaign in 1990 and 1991, Wolf was named the Chilean Champion Turf Two-Year-Old, Champion Turf Three-Year-Old, Champion Dirt Three-Year-Old, and Horse of the Year.\n\n\n=== In the United States (1991-1992) ===\nWolf's American campaign began July 29, 1991, in a mile long allowance race run over the Del Mar turf. Neil Drysdale had taken over training, and jockey Gary Stevens rode Wolf. Wolf was fractious and trailed the field for most of the race before rallying to finish second by two lengths. On October 4, he ran in a mile and one-eighth allowance at Santa Anita and won by three-quarters of a length.\nWolf then progressed to stakes races, running in the Grade 2 Citation Handicap, run over one and one-eighth miles on the turf at Hollywood Park, on November 30. Assigned 119 pounds, he was the co-highweight with Best Pal and two other entrants. Wolf ran third, just under two lengths from the winner.\nWolf didn't race again until September 10, 1992, when he contested a mile and one-eighth allowance race on the turf at Woodbine. He won handily by a half length. On October 4, he ran in the Grade 2 Niagara Handicap, one and one-quarter miles on the turf, as the favorite and highweight, assigned 117 pounds. He ran at the back of the field before making up ground late, but only managed to finish fourth. Two weeks later, he ran in the Grade 1 Rothmans Ltd. International Stakes over one and one-half miles on the turf. He made a bid, but hung in the late stretch to finish fourth.\nTwelve days later, Wolf ran again, this time in the listed Prized Handicap, run over one and three-eighths miles at Gulfstream Park. He was the favorite and 117-pound highweight, but only managed a mild rally in the stretch, finishing fifth of ten.\n\n\n== Race record ==\n\n\n== Stud career ==\nAfter retiring from racing, Wolf remained in the United States, where he entered stud at Lane's End Farm. In 1996, Wolf was acquired by the Turkish National Stud, where he died in 2002. He sired a few stakes winners in Turkey, but had limited success at stud.\n\n\n== Pedigree ==\nWolf is inbred 4D × 4D to Crescent, meaning Crescent appears twice in the fourth generation on the dam's side of the pedigree. Wolf is also inbred 4D x 5D to Seductor and 5S x 5D to Nogara.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTriple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing\nList of leading Thoroughbred racehorses\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Francis Higgins, also called the \"Sham Squire\", (1746 – 19 January 1802) was an Irish newspaper proprietor and spy.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHiggins was the son of humble parents, who migrated from Downpatrick in Ulster to Dublin. Higgins passed his early years in menial employments, became an attorney's clerk, was converted to Protestantism, and, by practising gross deception, married a respectable lady, whose relatives in 1766 prosecuted him for fraud. Higgins was convicted, and was for some time imprisoned. To this incident was attributed Higgins's sobriquet of the ‘Sham Squire.’ After his release he formed lucrative connections with lottery-offices and gambling-houses. He was admitted an attorney at Dublin in 1780, and secured the posts of deputy-coroner and under-sheriff. Higgins became owner of the newspaper styled ‘The Freeman's Journal,’ which, with his own services, he placed at the disposal of the administrators of the government at Dublin. Thenceforth Higgins continuously assailed in his paper the opponents of the government, and Henry Grattan denounced in parliament the mendacities and unscrupulous conduct of the journal. In 1788 Higgins was appointed a magistrate by Lord-chancellor Lifford. John Magee, in his paper, the ‘Dublin Evening Post,’ published numerous satires in prose and verse on Higgins and his associate, Richard Daly. Magee exposed Higgins's antecedents, and denounced him as a venal journalist, a corrupt magistrate, and a proprietor of houses of ill-repute. In 1790 Higgins prosecuted Magee for libel in the court of king's bench. Through Higgins's alleged influence with John Scott, earl of Clonmel, lord chief justice, he obtained, by authority of that court, writs styled ‘fiats,’ under which the defendants were liable to imprisonment till they found surety for the entire amount claimed as damages. These proceedings formed the subject of discussion in the House of Commons of Ireland. Lord-chancellor FitzGibbon removed Higgins from the magistracy in 1791, and in 1794 he was struck off the roll of attorneys. In 1795 he warned the government of a projected attack on the new lord-lieutenant, Lord Camden. Through the under-secretary, Edward Cooke, with whom he had had previous relations, Higgins secretly communicated to the Irish government in 1798 particulars as to persons connected with the revolutionary movements in Ireland. The governmental account of secret service money, under date of 20 June 1798, contains an entry of a payment of 1,000l. to ‘F. H.’ for the discovery of Lord Edward Fitzgerald. The initials are those of Higgins. Cooke recommended Lord Castlereagh to appropriate a pension of 300l. per annum to Higgins, on the ground that he had given him much information and all the intelligence which had enabled him to effect the arrest of Lord Edward Fitzgerald. Higgins died in affluence at Dublin on 19 January 1802, and was buried in the cemetery of Kilbarrack.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Gilbert, John Thomas (1891). \"Higgins, Francis (1746-1802)\".

As of April 2024, Thapa is the only Nepalese person to have been awarded the George Cross.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nThapa was born in western Nepal. He enlisted in the 2 Bn, 8th Gurkha Rifles in December 1920. He was married and had a son. \n\n\n== George Cross action and citation ==\nAt the rank of Naik, Nandlal Thapa was initially awarded the Empire Gallantry Medal (EGM) for the extraordinary bravery he displayed in conducting rescue operations right after the massive Quetta Earthquake of 31 May 1935. His EGM citation reads as the following: \n\"The KING has been graciously pleased to approve of the Award of the Medal of the Military Division of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire to the undermentioned for services rendered in connection with the recent earthquake in Baluchistan:– For Gallantry. No. 7506 Naik Nandlal Thapa, 2nd Battalion, 8th Gurkha Rifles, Indian Army. Naik Nandlal Thapa formed part of the leading detachment of the Battalion which was conveyed by Mechanical Transport from the Lines to Quetta City. There was no time for the party to collect tools. On arrival in the City the detachment was split up into small parties and worked with their hands for three hours, prior to the distribution of tools, extricating injured men and women from the débris. The area in which they worked was the junction of Bruce Road and Colvin Road, one of the parts most damaged by the earthquake. During this period minor shocks frequently occurred, causing further falls of masonry in the houses in which they were digging with their hands. Working with the party this Non-commissioned Officer showed conspicuous bravery in the manner in which he entered tottering buildings in search of living people and in the work and initiative he displayed in removing them. As a result of his disregard of danger ten people were rescued alive at considerable risk. He fully realised the risks he ran, but was always ready to enter any building where there was any possibility of anyone remaining alive. His conduct was a very fine example of courage and energy at a critical time.\"\nIn September 1940, following the creation of the George Cross, he was awarded a George Cross in place of the EGM. By that time, he had already retired from the army.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nAfter the completion of his service, Thapa returned to Nepal. He died at Dhaulagiri.\nHis George Cross is held in the collection of the Gurkha Museum, Winchester.\nHe finds a brief mention in J.P. Cross's autobiographical account of his life in Nepal. \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "John Magee (died November 1809) was an Irish journalist and lottery broker.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMagee became proprietor and printer in Dublin of ‘Magee's Weekly Packet’ in 1777, and of the ‘Dublin Evening Post’ at the beginning of 1779. Both papers were printed at 20 Dame Street. From the first these journals, and especially the ‘Evening Post,’ opposed the government measures, and showed whig sympathies, but during 1789 the proprietor's name became particularly prominent on account of a series of attacks made on the notorious Francis Higgins, a journalist in the government pay, and on other persons, among whom was John Scott, Lord Earlsfort, afterwards Earl of Clonmell, chief justice of the king's bench, Higgins's personal friend. Magee also charged Richard Daly, patentee and manager of the Crow Street Theatre, with tricking the former patentee out of his patent and with making money, in conjunction with Higgins, by dishonest means. Reflections on the character of Thomas Brennan, at that time on the staff of the ‘Freeman's Journal,’ but formerly a writer in Magee's own employ, and on a lady named Tracey, who was a ward of Higgins, and then lived with her aunt in Brennan's house at Kilmacud, appeared at the same time in the ‘Dublin Evening Post.’ On the affidavits of these persons fiats were issued by Lord Earlsfort in June requiring Magee to find bail to the amount of 7,800l., pending actions for libel. This he was unable to do, especially as it was requisite that the sureties should declare themselves worth twice the amount of the bail. He was consequently confined in a spunging-house. He continued while in confinement to conduct his newspapers, and Nicholas Lawless, first lord Cloncurry, sought to alleviate the hardships of his imprisonment.\nOn 3 July 1789 the trial of Magee for the libel on Higgins began before Lord Earlsfort. Magee was not present at the opening, a habeas corpus having been refused, and he was unrepresented by counsel. An order to bring up the body of defendant was, however, at length granted by the chief justice; but Magee, when he arrived, protested against the empanelling of the jury and the opening of the trial in his absence, and, refusing to plead, was at his own request ordered back into custody. No defence was offered. But Arthur Browne and other lawyers in court protested against the excessive fiats as unconstitutional (Browne, Arguments before King's Bench on admitting John Magee to Common Bail, 1790). Magee's charges were in popular opinion well founded. The jury at first brought in a verdict of ‘guilty of printing and publishing,’ but were sent back by the chief justice, and then returned a general verdict of guilty. Lord Earlsfort, who refused them a copy of the record, declared that ‘had they given any other verdict they would have acted in a manner shameful to themselves and disgraceful to their country.’ No good report of the trial is in existence. On his conviction he was set at liberty pending the pronouncement of his sentence. On 10 July 1789 the Dublin Volunteers passed a resolution approving ‘the firm conduct of our worthy fellow-citizen in a late transaction,’ and Hamilton Rowan wrote to Magee in his confinement offering to subscribe twenty-five guineas to a public subscription which it was proposed to raise in his behalf. Magee, however, refused to accept anything. On 30 July, Brennan, one of the men libelled by Magee, entered Magee's house and destroyed the furniture. He was arrested and tried on sworn information, but was acquitted.\nMeanwhile, Magee continued to lampoon Higgins and Lord Clonmell, and the ‘Freeman's Journal,’ which belonged to Higgins, replied with equal scurrility. To revenge himself upon the lord chief justice he arranged for Lammas day, in honour of the Prince of Wales's birthday, what he called a ‘Bra Pleasura’ in a field adjoining Lord Clonmell's house at Dunleary, or ‘Fiat Hill.’ Lord Cloncurry was an eye-witness, and an account is also given by Sir Jonah Barrington. A mob of several thousands assembled. A derisive programme of sports was performed. Dogs danced in barristers' uniforms, and asses raced with jockeys in wigs; and finally, in an ‘Olympic pig-hunt,’ the people followed the animals into Lord Clonmell's grounds and did much damage. The ‘Dublin Evening Post’ of 25 August announced an adjournment of further proceedings to 7 Sept., pending the arrival of the chief justice. On 27 August it declared that ‘there would be thirty thousand men at Dunleary.’ The chief justice, according to an informant of Fitzpatrick, in great alarm implored the viceroy to summon the privy council and obtain a suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act. The result was that Magee was arrested on 3 September by a warrant of Sir Samuel Bradstreet, judge of the king's bench, and, being unable to give heavy bail to keep the peace for five years, was committed to Newgate. On 29 October he was liberated in bail for 4,000l. On 3 October a petition to grant a commission of lunacy in the case of Magee was dismissed by the lord chancellor of Ireland, who said ‘he had observed Mr. Magee the whole time he had been in court, and he saw nothing insane in him.’ In its issue of 31 October the ‘Dublin Evening Post’ stated that ‘in the argument preparatory to Mr. Magee's liberation from his cruel and oppressive imprisonment the king's attorney-general avowed in open court that Magee's persecutions were entirely a government business.’\nA further period of imprisonment in Newgate between 5 and 27 November followed, owing to some difficulty respecting his bail, and on 2 December he was again committed on the warrant of 3 September. On 8 February 1790 he was sentenced to six months' imprisonment and a fine of 50l. for another offence—contempt of court in commenting on the proceedings in the court of king's bench.\nThe proceedings against Magee had now become a matter of public interest, and both Lord Clonmell and the administration generally of George N. T. Grenville, first marquis of Buckingham, had incurred great odium in consequence. The question of the legality of the fiats was brought before the Irish House of Commons on 3 March by Ponsonby. A resolution to the effect that they were unconstitutional was moved by the latter before the grand committee of courts of justice, but the government motion that the chairman leave the chair was carried by 125 to 91. Ponsonby's speech was subsequently published. An ‘Address to the Whig Club on the Judicial Discretion of Judges on Fiats and Bails,’ published anonymously, was written by Leonard McNally (Madden, Hist. of Irish Period. Lit. ii. 349). The practice of issuing fiats was afterwards limited to definite sums.\nThe case of Daly v. Magee came on for hearing on 28 June 1790. Curran was among the prosecuting counsel, and Ponsonby one of those for the defence. The damages claimed were 8,000l.; those given were 200l. and 6d. costs.\nBy the beginning of 1790 Magee was broken both in fortune and in spirit, and his attacks on Higgins and his friends ceased. Though himself brought to the verge of ruin, he had accomplished his ends. Higgins was removed from the commission of the peace in 1793, and afterwards struck off the rolls. Through his representations, too, the city magistrates took active steps in September 1789 against the Dublin gambling-houses, which he had charged Higgins with supporting. Lord Clonmell's reputation Magee had also permanently ruined. Magee, whose residence was at 41 College Green, died in November 1809.\nJohn Magee (fl. 1814), his eldest son, carried on the ‘Dublin Evening Post’ for several years on the same lines as his father. He was on 21 February 1812 found guilty of publishing a libel on the Dublin police (Ann. Reg. 1812, pp. 271–2), and on 27 July 1813 he was convicted of a libel on the Duke of Richmond (late lord-lieutenant), and sentenced on 29 November to a fine of 500l. and two years' imprisonment, and to give securities to keep the peace for seven years. His defence, conducted by Daniel O'Connell in a speech of three and three-quarter hours, is generally considered to have been O'Connell's finest forensic display. This and the other speeches at the trial were published with a preface in 1813 under the title ‘Trial of John Magee,’ &c. (see also Ann. Reg. 1813, pp. 269–274; Select Speeches of O'Connell. On 3 February 1814, John Magee, junior, was again convicted of libel, he having published in his paper certain resolutions of the Roman Catholics of Kilkenny. He was sentenced on 4 Aug. to a fine of 1,000l. and imprisonment for six months, to commence from the expiration of his former term (Gent. Mag. 1814, i. 189).\nJames Magee (d. 1866), a younger son, was brought up as a merchant, but (probably in 1815) began to conduct the ‘Dublin Evening Post.’ The line he took was so conciliatory to the government that he appears to have been refunded part of the money paid in fines by his brother. In December 1815 he obtained from Nicholas Purcell O'Gorman damages to the amount of 977l. 13s. 10d. with costs, the latter having induced him to publish an incorrect account of a trial—O'Dogherty v. O'Mullan and others—on account of which Magee had had to pay 500l. damages (Trial of an Action for Deceit, Dublin, 1816). James Magee, who became a Dublin police-magistrate, died in September 1866 (Fitzpatrick, Ireland before the Union, p. 148).\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Norgate, Gerald le Grys (1893). \"Magee, John\".

It was released on 10 May 2024 via BMG Rights Management and follows her 2021 covers collection Do It Again. It was preeceded by the release of two singles, \"A Place In Your Heart\" and \"Sorry\".\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nRetropop awarded 4 stars to the album and commended the \"broad range of influences\" on it while noting that it 'steps outside of all preconceived notions of a ‘Gabrielle album’ and offers up a body of work that feels current and relevant to the singer as she stands today\".Naomi Clark of The Independent rated the album 7 out of 10 and called it \"a varied offering full of soulful tracks\". However, she felt that the album \"narrowly falls short of the magic of her 90s classics\" and was specifically critical of the song 'Sorry', calling it 'distinctly unoriginal' and 'a middling pop ballad at best'.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n==Personnel== \nCredits adapted from the album's booklet.\nMusicians\n\nGabrielle – songwriter, lead vocals, backing vocals\nIan Barter – Mastering Engineer, Mixing Engineer, Producer, Drum Programmer, Electric Guitar, Keyboards, Recording Engineer, Bass\nTechnical\n\nLisaBennington – Management\nIanBarter – Co-writer&producer\nCraigLogan, Jonnie Blackburn & LisaBennington – A&R\nAngie Somerside – Marketing\nAdam Nash – ProductManager\nAlexChalk & MarvinFrancis – Hair&Makeup\nJahméne – photography\nStefanEvans & LewisShaw – Artwork\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Joseph Palmer, formerly Joseph Budworth, (1756 – 4 September 1815) was an English writer.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nPalmer  born in 1756, nephew of the Rev. William Budworth master of Brewood school, Staffordshire, was son of Joseph Budworth, originally of Coventry. At an early age he joined the 72nd regiment, or royal Manchester volunteers. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant, and proceeded with the regiment to Gibraltar. In the course of the siege of that fortress by the combined forces of France and Spain, he was severely wounded. He returned home with his regiment in 1783, and accepted a cadetship in the Bengal artillery, though he did not long remain in India. Subsequently, he retired from the service; but in the war occasioned by the French revolution, he volunteered as a captain in the North Hampshire militia. Shortly after leaving the army he married Elizabeth, sister of Roger Palmer, esq., of Rush, near Dublin, and of Palmerstown, co. Mayo, and succeeded, in her right, on the decease of her brother in 1811, to the estates and name of Palmer. He was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries on 4 June 1795 (Gough, Chronological List, p. 58). He died at Eastbourne, Sussex, on 4 September 1815, and was buried on the 14th in the churchyard of West Moulsey, Surrey, to which parish he had been a liberal benefactor.\nHis only daughter and sole heiress, Emma Mary, became the wife of W. A. Mackinnon, of Newtown Park, M.P. for Lymington. She died on 15 November 1835, aged 43 (Gent. Mag. 1835, pt. ii. p. 663).\nPalmer wrote much in the ‘Gentleman's Magazine,’ under the signature ‘Rambler.’ His works are: \n\n‘A Fortnight's Ramble to the Lakes in Westmoreland, Lancashire, and Cumberland. By a Rambler,’ London, 1792, 8vo; 2nd edit. 1795; 3rd edit. 1810; dedicated to William Noble, banker. To the latter edition were added ‘A Re-visit to Buttermere, January 1795,’ and ‘Half-pay.’ Many interesting anecdotes of the siege of Gibraltar, including particulars of his own military services, occur in pp. 358–82.\n‘Half-pay [a poem]. Written at Gibraltar on a very stormy evening, with the melancholy prospect of going upon Half-pay,’ 1794; dedicated to Colonel Hans Sloane, M.P.\n‘The Lancashire Collier-Girl. A true Story,’ in ‘Gentleman's Magazine,’ 1795, pt. i. p. 197. This tale was widely disseminated by the Society for Circulating Serious Tracts among the Poor, but with some alterations not approved by the author.\n‘The Siege of Gibraltar: a Poem,’ London, 1795, 4to.\n‘A View of the Village of Hampton from Moulsey Hurst. With the original “Lancashire Collier-Girl,”’ London, 1797, 12mo.\n‘Windermere: a Poem,’ London, 1798, 8vo.\nA memoir of his father, the Rev. William Budworth, and an account of an interesting conversation between Bishop Hurd and himself, are in John Nichols's ‘Literary Anecdotes,’ vol. iii.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Cooper, Thompson (1895). \"Palmer, Joseph\".

        "content": "FSV Barleben 1911 is a football club from the unified municipality of Barleben in the German state of Saxony-Anhalt. The home of the club is the sports field at Barleber Anger. The biggest success in the club's history is the winning of the national championship title 2014/15.\nThe first team has been playing in the Verbandsliga Sachsen-Anhalt since 2018 after the voluntary withdrawal from the southern relay of the Oberliga Nordost and has been trained by Christoph Grabinski since July 2021.\n\n\n== Prehistory ==\nThe chronicle of Barleber football goes back to 1911, when the first sports club with a football section was founded. In the early years, however, the association did not appear nationwide. After the end of the Second World War, the club was dissolved in 1945 at the instigation of the Soviet occupying power, but sports activities continued to exist. In the course of the reorganization of company sports on a production basis, the BSG VEM Barleben was created in 1948, a company sports community, which was joined by the sports community formed in 1945. In the following years, the club, renamed BSG Motor Barleben in 1950, achieved some success. For example, they belonged to the Bezirksliga Magdeburg from 1952 to 1954 and 1956/1957. From 1957 until the reunification of both German states, Barleben played continuously in the district class for many years, but in 1987/88 he was relegated to the district league. With the end of the GDR, the BSG Motor Barleben was refounded into SG Motor Barleben.\nAfter the introduction of the DFB league system in East Germany, SG Motor Barleben therefore found itself at district level for the 1990/91 season. In the mid-1990s, Barleber football managed to return to FSA level with the promotion to the state class.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1997, the footballers went their own way and left SG Motor Barleben and founded their own club. In tradition to the first Barleben football team, they called the club FSV Barleben 1911. At the end of the 2003/04 season, the FSV was relegated from the state class after long-standing affiliation. Only the absence of relegated in the Ohrekreisliga prevented the further decline of the club in 2005. It was not until 2008 that the Red-Blacks found they back in national football, whereby with a new promotion they even succeeded in the march into the now seventh-class state league. Although the club had to accept the direct relegation, the immediate re-promotion to the Landesliga Nord followed in the year of the 100th anniversary. After the placements three and four, FSV Barleben rose undefeated to the Verbandsliga Saxony-Anhalt with first place in 2014. In 2015, winning the state championship of Saxony-Anhalt succeeded in the first promotion to the Oberliga, so that the club was active for the first time in the fifth highest division of the DFB league system in the 2015/16 season. In the new league, the team of coach Mario Middendorf with ninth place already managed the safe class preservation with a few match days before the end of the season, which with a 13. Place was also realized in the following season. After the third season in the Oberliga, the first under coach Jörn Schulz, and the renewed sporting class retention, the club withdrew to the Verbandsliga for economic reasons.\n\n\n== Stadium ==\nThe club usually plays its home games on the sports field at Barleber Anger, which has a lawn (main square) and an artificial turf field. However, if games are due that require a higher level of security or if more than 1,000 spectators are expected to play at home, they will not take place on the home sports field.\n\n\n== Players and coaches of the men's team ==\n\n\n== Saxony-Anhalt Cup ==\n\n\n== Successes ==\nHall district master district of Börde (2007/08)\nDistrict Master District of Börde (2007/08)\nChampion State Class 4 (2008/09)\nChampion State Class 2 (2010/11)\nChampion Landesliga Nord (2013/14)\nNational Champion Saxony-Anhalt (2014/15)\n\n\n== External links ==\nwww.fsvbarleben.de\nHighlights: FSV Barleben - 1.

        "content": "Drifting is the second studio album by Norwegian saxophonist and composer Mette Henriette, released on ECM Records on January 20, 2023.\n\n\n== Critical Reception ==\nDownBeat critic Carlo Wolff describes the album as «contemporary chamber music of power and persuasion, that joins its musicians in a quest for serenity». AllMusic critic Thom Jurek referred to it as «sophisticated and spiritually resonant». Jazz Journal critic Simon Adams stated “It’s often dangerous to over-praise a set, but in its quiet, understated way, I would call this album faultless. Modern jazz chamber music at its finest.“. Jazzwise critic John Fordham describes the album as “Drifting may remind you of a dream, or an embrace, or a preoccupied woodland wander a lot more than a wild bop-blasting night in a jazz club, but that's what the unique Mette Henriette is all about.”\nThe Guardian critic John Lewis describes it as “Beautifully recorded low-volume acoustic music located somewhere equidistant from jazz, folk and contemporary composition.” All About Jazz critic Karl Ackermann wrote “A sound that is both ethereal and spiritual. It is an excellent album, timeless, with a circular quality, and best listened to in its entirety.” while All About Jazz critic Mike Jurkovic referred to it as “A quiet triumph.”. Pitchfork critic Jane Bua described Drifting as  “hushed, repetitive meditations unbounded by the pressures of time.”  and continued \"There is a certain comfort to be found in the passive energy of the album, which subtly unfolds according to its own timekeeping. It’s clear that Henriette’s pieces ask not for attention—merely patience and an open mind.\"\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\nAll tracks were recorded in Munch Museum in Oslo.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n\n====== Musicians ======\nMette Henriette – Tenor Saxophone\nJohan Lindvall – Piano\nJudith Hamann – Violoncello\n\n\n====== Technical ======\nPeer Espen Ursfjord – Recording engineer\nGérard de Haro – Mixing engineer\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Askania Bernburg is a German football club based in the city of Bernburg, located in the state of Saxony-Anhalt. The club was founded on March 15, 1909, and has a rich history in regional football competitions.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early Years ===\nAskania Bernburg was established in 1909 as FC Askania 09 Bernburg. The club initially played friendly matches against other local teams before joining competitive leagues. In the early years, Askania Bernburg primarily participated in local and regional competitions in Saxony-Anhalt.\n\n\n=== Post-War Era ===\nFollowing World War II, Askania Bernburg faced challenges due to the political and social changes in the region. The club managed to rebuild and resumed its football activities in regional leagues. Throughout the post-war era, Askania Bernburg competed in various divisions of German football.\n\n\n=== Rise to Prominence ===\nIn the 1990s, Askania Bernburg experienced success and achieved several promotions, climbing up the German football league system. The club reached its peak in the early 2000s when it competed in the NOFV-Oberliga Nord, the fourth tier of German football at the time.\n\n\n=== Recent Years ===\nIn recent years, Askania Bernburg has participated in regional leagues, including the Landesliga Sachsen-Anhalt. The club has maintained a presence in regional football and continues to compete against other teams in Saxony-Anhalt.\nOn July 25, 1952, the state parliament of Saxony-Anhalt passed the “Law on the further democratization, structure and functioning of state bodies in the state of Saxony-Anhalt.” This meant the dissolution of the previous state into the districts of Magdeburg and Halle and thus the formation of the Bernburg district in the Halle district. The result was the definition of new leagues. The first team of BSG Empor Bernburg became a founding member of the third-class Halle district league, which consists of a total of 12 teams. Below the district league there were the district and district classes, above the upper league and the DS league.[11]\nIn 1952 the club was renamed BSG Chemie Bernburg. As early as 1954 he was relegated from the district league. When competitive sports were separated from popular sports in 1954, all sports associations except SV Medizin and SV Post founded a sports club (SC), sometimes several. The chemistry, glass and ceramics union sector founded SC Chemie Halle-Leuna, today's SV Halle, in what was then the district town of Halle (Saale).\nIn 1957, BSG Chemie Bernburg, together with Stahl Helbra, managed to return to the district's top division, which this time was held for nine years until 1966. The best results were the runner-up championships won in 1959 and 1963 behind Motor Aschersleben and HSG Wissenschaft Halle, with which Chemie Bernburg narrowly failed to gain promotion to the Second GDR League.\nIn the period that followed, it was no longer possible to return to the district league; the BSG only appeared in the Halle district league until 1991. In 1990 the club renamed itself Askania Bernburg. From 1994 to 2014, Askania Bernburg operated consistently between the Saxony-Anhalt Association League and the state league. In 2014, as runners-up, they celebrated promotion to the fifth-class Oberliga Nordost and benefited from the renunciation of the champions BSV Halle-Ammendorf\n\n\n== Stadium ==\nAskania Bernburg plays its home matches at the Sparkassen Arena.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of football clubs in Germany\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

The football department rose to the NOFV-Oberliga in the 2016/17 season and stayed in this league for two seasons.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe club was founded in October 1950 as SG Brieselang. In October 1952, a sponsoring company was assigned to the association and it was now called BSG Chemie Brieselang. In GDR times, the club played in 1952/53 and from 1960 to 1966/67 in the third-class football district league Potsdam.\nOn the 22nd In July 1997, the club renamed itself SV Grün-Weiss Brieselang. In 2012, the promotion to the state class was successful, which was already won in the first season, so that Brieselang was promoted to the state league in 2013. After two years, the club managed to be promoted to the sixth-class Brandenburg League. After Brieselang was the table leader of the Brandenburg League in the 2015/16 season from the fifth matchday, the club finally won the league with an eleven-point lead over Breesener SV Guben-Nord and rose to the fifth-class Oberliga Nordost (season North).\nAfter two seasons in the Oberliga, the relegation to the Brandenburg-Liga followed at the end of the 2017/18 season and a year later the relegation to the Landesliga Nord.\nThe women's department of SV Grün-Weiss Brieselang won the AOK State Cup in 2023 by a 1-0 success after extra time over the BSG Stahl Brandenburg and thus qualified for the DFB Cup 2023/24.\n\n\n== Successes ==\nBrandenburg Football Champion: 2016\nParticipation NOFV-Oberliga: 2016/17, 2017/18\nParticipation in the DFB Women's Cup: 2023/24\n\n\n== Persons ==\nChristopher Lemke (* 1995)\nUwe Schulz (* 1960)\nJan Seidel (* 1984)\nSven Thoß (* 1966)\n\n\n== External Links ==\nHome of the Association",

He trained as a bookseller in Leipzig in 1792. After his training, in 1798 he was hired as an employee in the Berlin branch of Lange'sche Verlagsbuchhandlung, a bookseller and publisher, where he met and became friends with Georg Andreas Reimer. In 1804, he became managing director and silent partner at the Dieterich'sche Verlagsbuchhandlung publishing house and bookstore in Göttingen. As a volunteer in the Lützow Free Corps during the War of the Sixth Coalition, he was captured during the battle near Kitzen in June 1813. He was held as a prisoner of war in Fenestrelle and Sisteron until being released in April 1814.\nOn January 1, 1815, he acquired the publishing business founded by Julius Eduard Hitzig in 1808 and operated it under the name \"Ferd. Dümmlersche Verlagsbuchhandlung\" thereafter. Also in 1815, he married Caroline Friederike Reinhardt, sister of his friend Georg Andreas Reimer's wife. He had seven children with her, including the historian Ernst Ludwig Dümmler. Dümmler's publishing activities were varied. In 1819 he published The Life and Opinions of the Tomcat Murr by E. T. A. Hoffmann. To a certain extent, the publishing house specialized in comparative linguistics and published the writings of the Prussian Academy of Sciences on commission.\nFrom 1821, Ferdinand Dümmler was first elected as a deputy city councilor and then repeatedly as a member of the Berlin city council. From 1842 until his death on March 15, 1846, he was an unpaid city councilor.\nIn 1916, Antonio Lehmann (1871–1941) moved the publishing business from Berlin to Kaiserstrasse street in Bonn and renamed it \"Ferd. Dümmlers Verlag\". Starting in 1949, the company had a logo designed by Heinrich Hussmann. The company was sold to H. Stam Verlag in Cologne in 1999.\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nKelchner, Ernst (1877), \"Dümmler, Ferdinand\", Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie (in German), vol. 5, Leipzig: Duncker & Humblot, pp. 460–461",

        "content": "NGC 3799 is a barred spiral galaxy located in the constellation Leo. Its speed relative to the cosmic microwave background is 3,659 ± 24 km/s, which corresponds to a Hubble distance of 54.0 ± 3.8 Mpc (∼176 million ly). NGC 3799 was discovered by British astronomer John Herschel in 1832.\nNGC 3799 and NGC 3800 are two gravitationally interacting galaxies and appear in Halton Arp's Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies under the symbol Arp 83. Halton Arp describes these as an example of galaxies by presenting a bridge of matter between them and having a high surface gloss.\nThe luminosity class of NGC 3799 is II and it has a broad HI line. According to the SIMBAD database, NGC 3799 is a LINER galaxy, that is to say a galaxy whose nucleus presents an emission spectrum characterized by broad lines of weakly ionized atoms.\nTo date, a non-redshift measurement gives a distance of approximately 47,000 Mpc (∼153 million ly). This value is far outside the Hubble distance values. Note, however, that it is with the average value of independent measurements, when they exist, that the NASA/IPAC database calculates the diameter of a galaxy.\n\n\n== NGC 3800 group ==\nNGC 3799 is part of a group of galaxies that has at least 16 members which make up what is commonly known as the NGC 3800 group. Other   galaxies in this group are NGC 3768, NGC 3790, NGC 3800, NGC 3801, NGC 3802 , NGC 3806, NGC 3827 and NGC 3853. The other galaxies in the group are UGC 6631, UGC 6653, UGC 6666, UGC 6794, MCG 3-30-33 and MCG 3-30-388.\nAbraham Mahtessian also mentions the existence of this group, but only the galaxies NGC 3768, NGC 3790, NGC 3801 and NGC 3827 appear there. The galaxy NGC 3853 appears in Mahtessian's article, but under another entry where it forms a galaxy pair with UGC 6666, designated as 1139+1618 (CGCG 1139.7+1648). Similarly, the galaxies NGC 3799 and NGC 3800 are also listed under another entry in this article as a pair of galaxies.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of NGC objects (3001–4000)\nAtlas of Peculiar Galaxies\n\n\n== External links ==\nNGC 3799 at SIMBAD\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sir George Allan Madden  (3 January 1771 – 8 December 1828) was an English army officer in the British and Portuguese services.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMadden was the eighth son and fifteenth and youngest child of James Madden, of Cole Hill House, Fulham, Middlesex. He was born in London 3 January 1771, and was baptised at St. Martin's-in-the-Fields. After attending private schools, and accepting an engagement on trial in a merchant's office from September 1787, his father, in February 1788, obtained for him a commission in the army. He was appointed cornet in the 14th light dragoons in Ireland, 14 March 1789. On 30 June 1791 he purchased (from Arthur Wellesley, afterwards Duke of Wellington, then promoted in the 58th foot) a lieutenancy in the 12th or Prince of Wales's light dragoons, in which regiment he became captain 29 June 1793 and major 25 December 1800. After serving several years in Ireland, he embarked with his regiment at Cork in September 1793 for Ostend. Contrary winds drove them back, and the regiment was counter-ordered to Toulon, then just relieved by Admiral Hood. Adverse winds and defective supplies caused innumerable delays, and Toulon had been evacuated before the regiment arrived. Madden was with the mounted portion of the regiment, which was refused permission to land at Leghorn. At Porto Ferrajo, island of Elba, no forage could be found. At length, at the invitation of Pope Pius VI, it was put ashore at Civita Vecchia, 6 March 1794, the surviving horses, it is said (Services of Colonel G. A. Madden, p. 3), having then been nine months ashipboard. During the stay of the troops at Civita Vecchia gold medals were presented by the pope to the officers. It appears from the exergue that the medals were originally struck to commemorate the restoration of the port; but a subsequent order of the general commanding directed them to be constantly worn by the recipients, out of respect to the memory of the ill-fated pontiff. Pictures of the reception of the officers at Rome by Pius VI were placed at South Kensington, and in the officers mess 12th lancers. The regiment left Civita Vecchia in May 1794; took part in the operations in Corsica ending with the fall of Calvi in August, and was ordered home in November the same year. Madden's troop was shipwrecked on the coast of Spain. The men and horses were saved, and were assigned quarters by the Spanish government in one of the Puntales forts, near Cadiz, where they remained until a ship was sent out from England to fetch them home in August 1795 (ib. p. 4).\nMadden's conduct was warmly approved by the British authorities at Gibraltar. In January 1797 he went with his regiment to Portugal, and was stationed three years at Lisbon. In 1801 the regiment accompanied Sir Ralph Abercromby to Egypt, and took part in the battle before Alexandria and the advance on Cairo. During the latter, Madden, the youngest field officer of cavalry present with the army, was sent by Lord Hutchinson with detachments of the 12th and 26th (afterwards 23rd) light dragoons, on special service towards Rosetta. Throughout the march on Cairo Madden's activity and intelligence won Hutchinson's high approbation.\nThere was much want of harmony between Madden and the officer in temporary command of the regiment, Colonel Browne, afterwards General Browne-Clayton, K.C. (see Gent. Mag. 1845, ii. 197). An angry altercation on duty matters had taken place between them (see Trial of G. A. Madden, London, 1803, pp. 37–8), and in August 1801 Madden charged Browne with having committed perjury in a recent court-martial on a captain of the 12th dragoons. In consequence Madden was arraigned before a general court-martial on a charge of unofficerlike conduct and disrespect to his commanding officer. The court-martial, of which Major-general (Sir) John Moore was president, and Colonels John Stuart (of Maida), Alan Cameron of Lochiel, and other famous officers were members, was held in the camp before Alexandria, 31 August 1801. Two editions of the proceedings were printed. The court found Madden guilty of the charge, and adjudged him to be dismissed the service. Lord Hutchinson refused to confirm the proceedings. Eventually, Madden, who was very popular with his brother-officers, was sent home, and permitted to retire by the sale of his commissions (Lond. Gaz. 26 May 1802), all of which he had purchased. When the 12th light dragoons arrived in England three years later, a duel took place between Madden and Blunden, a major of the regiment, who had taken a part against Madden in the quarrel. Madden, after receiving his adversary's shot, fired in the air, and the matter ended.\nMadden was on terms of the closest intimacy with the margrave and margravine of Anspac, and lived with the family at Benham, Berkshire, and Brandenburgh House, Hammersmith, during the greater part of 1804–5. On 4 July 1805 he was, at the margrave's instance, appointed inspecting field-officer of yeomanry cavalry and volunteers in the midland district, with the temporary rank of lieutenant-colonel. On 17 May 1807 his appointment was renewed in the Severn district. He held the post until June 1809, when he was appointed a brigadier-general in the Portuguese army, with pay and allowances as in the British service\nOn 10 September 1809 Marshal Beresford gave Madden a Portuguese cavalry brigade. Five months later Lord Wellington inspected the brigade, and expressed the highest approval of its discipline and good order, to which it had been brought in the face of difficulties of every kind. In August 1810 Madden's brigade was sent into Spain, to be attached to the Spanish army of Estramadura, commanded by the Marquis de la Romana. Wellington, who thought highly of Madden, recommended him to Romana as ‘un officier Anglais de beaucoup de talent’ (Gurwood, v. 220). Madden's brigade remained with the Spaniards, under Romana and his successor, Mendizabel, throughout the French siege of Badajoz until its surrender to the French in March 1811 (see Napier, revised ed. vols. iii. iv.) At Fuente de Cantos, 15 September 1810, he saved the Spanish army—which, hard pressed by the French, was retreating in disorder, and like to disperse in flight—by most gallantly charging with his brigade a superior force of French hussars (ib. iii. 17). At Gebora, on the San Engracio heights, on 19 February 1811, when the Spanish army was routed, and Madden's Portuguese, following the dastardly example of the Spaniards, ran away (ib. iii. 97–8), he was allowed on all sides to have done all that man could do. His brigade was with Beresford's army before Badajoz, but a small portion only were engaged at Albuera, the rest being on detached duty with Madden, who was unaware of the likelihood of a battle; it was subsequently with the allied cavalry under General William Lumley, and with Wellington's army until the latter raised the second siege of Badajoz and retired behind the Caya. During the latter part of these operations Madden's command was augmented by two more regiments, raising the Portuguese cavalry under him to the strength of a division. When Wellington's army went into cantonments for the winter, the Portuguese cavalry was sent to Oporto, where it remained during the rest of the year. Early in 1812 it was ordered to Golegao, near Lisbon. The difficulty of procuring remounts decided Beresford to reduce the number of regiments, and to give up the idea of employing the Portuguese cavalry in brigades for a time. Madden thus found his occupation gone, and returned home in the early summer of 1812. In the meantime he had been reinstated in his rank in the British service, ‘at the special request of the Prince Regent and the government of Portugal, in recompense for his services in the army of that country’ (Lond. Gaz. 3 March 1812). In the ‘Annual Army List’ of 1813 his name reappears as lieutenant-colonel, late 12th dragoons, with seniority from 4 July 1805.\nMadden went back to Portugal in August 1812, and was appointed to command the 7th brigade of Portuguese infantry, which passed the winter of 1812–13 in villages about the Estrella mountains, and by arduous forced marches joined Wellington at Vittoria the morning after the great victory of 21 June 1813. Madden commanded the brigade, which was attached to the sixth British division, in the operations in the Pyrenees during the blockade of Pampeluna, including the affairs at St. Estevan and Sauroren. He attained the rank of marechal de campo, or major-general, in the Portuguese service, on 4 June 1813, but to avoid difficulties as to precedence, the promotion appears not to have been announced until after the arrival from home of the 4 June birthday ‘Gazette,’ by which he was promoted colonel in the British army. Notwithstanding the high character of his services with the Portuguese army—he had been third in seniority among the English officers, and had commanded a cavalry division—the precedence given by his Portuguese rank was regarded as unfair to the English colonels of equal standing, and he was directed to resign his brigade to the next senior officer, Sir John Douglas. After witnessing the assault on San Sebastian as a spectator, he repaired to Lisbon to await orders, and remained unemployed until the peace, when he returned home. He became a major-general in the British army 12 August 1819.\nMadden was made C.B. 4 June 1815, a knight commander of the Tower and Sword in Portugal 19 December 1815, and a knight bachelor 5 July 1816. He had, besides the papal medal, the Turkish order of the Crescent, the general officers' gold medal for the Pyrenees, and the Portuguese ‘Guerra Peninsular’ cross, decreed 1 July 1816, and given some years later to all officers effective in the six campaigns 1809–16 (see Naval and Mil. Gaz. 27 April 1844, p. 261). Madden died unmarried, on 8 December 1828, at the age of fifty-seven, at Portsmouth, at the house of his brother, Captain William John Madden, half-pay royal marines, who was father of Sir Frederic Madden. He was buried with military honours in Portsmouth Royal Garrison Church, where a tablet was placed in his memory.\nMadden's portrait was painted in 1817 by Miss Geddes, afterwards Mrs. Margaret Sarah Carpenter, and copied in oils by Samuel Cousins, R.A.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Chichester, Henry Manners (1893). \"Madden, George Allan\".

        "content": "Tackonekintaco (birth year unknown – c. 1620s) was a 16th and 17th-century leader of the Warraskoyack tribe of the Powhatan Confederacy, in what is now the U.S. state of Virginia. \n\n\n== Life and rule ==\nTackonekintaco was a respected leader within the Warraskoyack tribe. By the late 1590s, Tackonekintaco had become the new weroance of the tribe. The main village of the tribe was located in present-day Smithfield, Virginia. The tribe had at least 40 warriors and over 135 tribal members.\nIn December 1608, Tackonekintaco was visited by captain John Smith, with whom he had established friendly relations and gave corn to on an earlier trip. He cautioned Smith against continuing his journey in search of lost colonists, primarily due to the threat of violence from Powhatan. John Smith wrote that Tackonekintaco provided him with \"good counsel\" and he told the chief that he had his \"perpetual love\" and friendship. Upon Smith's departure, he left his page Samuel Collier with Tackonekintaco to learn the Algonquian language, and Tackonekintaco provided some local villagers as guides to accompany Michael Sicklemore on his journey south into the Chowanoc country. Tackonekintaco befriended Collier who lived with the tribe during that period.\nAs weroance, Tackonekintaco controlled the tribe's surplus stock of corn which was of great interest to colonists.\n\n\n=== Capture by Virginia Company ===\nAfter Smith's departure from Virginia, Tackonekintaco's time in leadership was met with threats of coercion and violence by colonists. In the summer of 1610, Tackonekintaco and his son, Tangoit were captured by colonists led by Christopher Newport, and held as hostages. To receive his freedom and his son's, he was forced to contract with the Virginia Company to exchange 500 bushels of wheats, beans, and peas for an indefinite quantity of copper, beads, and hatchets from the tribe. When Tackonekintaco refused to deliver the provisions, Governor of Virginia Baron De La Warr ordered his troops to attack their tribe and burn their main village. Tackonekintaco spotted the troops coming downriver, and gave the signal for his people to flee the village and take refuge in surrounding forests. \nIn 1623 in the aftermath of the Indian massacre of 1622, the tribe was attacked and later, an English fort was built within its borders.\n\n\n== Death ==\nRecords indicate that Tackonekintaco died c. 1620s and was the last recorded weroance of the tribe.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Špalkův obchodní dům (English: 'Špalek Department Store') is a modernist commercial building with apartments in Hradec Králové, Czech Republic. It was built at the beginning of the 20th century by architect Vladimír Fultner for the textile merchant Václav J. Špalek on the square Velké náměstí.\nAlthough the building has been referred to as a department store since its inception, it has always been primarily a residential building, with only its ground and second floors serving for commercial purposes. This is typical for Hradec Králové, where civic amenities were located on the ground floors of residential buildings due to the city's former military fortification status until 1893. Multi-story exclusively commercial buildings, such as Breda Department Store in Opava, did not emerge until the 1970s in Hradec Králové.\n\n\n== History ==\nMerchant Václav J. Špalek owned a house at the corner of Velké náměstí and Klicperova ulice, which burned down in July 1910. Špalek commissioned architect Vladimír Fultner to design a new building. Due to the narrow original medieval plot, Fultner decided to orient the main façade of the new building not towards the square but towards Klicperova street.\nŠpalek Department Store was designed as a five-storey corner house with two entrances and an ornamental façade. Despite facing critique from Klub Za starou Prahu (Club for old Prague) and the architect Jan Kotěra, who regarded the proportions of the construction unreasonable, the design was accepted and built by Josef Jihlavec in 1911. In the 1930s, the building was taken over by the company Baťa. The house was declared a cultural monument in 1958.\nIn the 21st century, the building was unused for several years and started to decay but a total reconstruction of the house and its conversion into living spaces took place in 2020.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe house has five floors. The façade towards the square is axially symmetrical, with an arcade in the ground floor and three large windows on the first floor. The higher floors are distinguished by a risalit with each storey containing five narrow windows. The roof forms a mansarda from which a dormer emerges. At the ends of the façade, there are two corner towers.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Savannah Marʻi Gankiewicz (born November 28, 1995) is an American model and beauty pageant titleholder who was crowned Miss USA 2023. Previously crowned Miss Hawaii USA 2023, Gankiewicz placed as the first runner-up at Miss USA, and took over the title after its original winner Noelia Voigt resigned in May 2024. Gankiewicz is the fifth woman from Hawaii to be crowned Miss USA.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nGankiewicz was born on November 28, 1995, on Oahu to parents Yvienne Tagorda Peterson and Mark Gankiewicz; her mother is from Maui and of Filipina descent, while her father is of Polish and Vietnamese descent. Her mother had a background in pageantry, having been crowned Mrs. Maui and serving as a director for the Miss Maui Filipina pageant. Gankiewicz spent the first six years of her life with her family on Maui, and later lived between Maui and Stephenson, Virginia, where her father relocated.\nGankiewicz was educated in Virginia, attending Sherando High School in Frederick County, Virginia and George Mason University in Fairfax County, Virginia. She later returned to Hawaii at age 21, settling in Kihei, Hawaii on Maui, where she began working as a professional model and a marketing coordinator at The Agency Maui.\n\n\n== Pageantry ==\nGankiewicz began competing in pageantry due to a desire to improve her public speaking skills and to develop a platform to promote self-love to other women, and was encouraged by her mother. Gankiewicz later moved to the Philippines to model and competed in the Filipino beauty pageant Mutya ng Pilipinas 2017, where she was a finalist and received the title of Mutya ng Pilipinas Overseas Filipino Communities for representing the Filipino-Hawaiian community. Following the pageant, she continued to live in the Philippines to work as a model for over a year.\nAfter a break from pageantry, Gankiewicz registered as a contestant for the Miss Hawaii USA 2023 pageant in January 2023, competing as Miss Wailea. She went on to win the title on her first attempt, and also was crowned Miss Photogenic. Aged 27 at the time of her win, Gankiewicz opted to compete in her final year of age eligibility as she had wanted to wait until she felt ready for the responsibilities of being a state titleholder. With her win, Gankiewicz became the first woman from Maui to be crowned Miss Hawaii USA in over 20 years.\n\n\n=== Miss USA 2023 ===\n\nAs Miss Hawaii USA, Gankiewicz became a contestant for Miss USA 2023, representing Hawaii. The competition was held on September 29, 2023, in Reno, Nevada and aired on The CW. During the state costume portion of the pageant, Gankiewicz wore a costume paying tribute to the victims of the 2023 wildfire in Lahaina, Hawaii on her home island of Maui, for which she won the Best State Costume award. Gankiewicz ultimately placed as the first runner-up in the competition, behind winner Noelia Voigt of Utah, and additionally won the Best in Interview award. Gankiewicz later crowned Breea Yamat as her successor at the Miss Hawaii USA 2024 pageant in April 2024.\nIn May 2024, Voigt announced that she was resigning her title as Miss USA, citing her struggles with mental health. Later that day, it was reported in the Hawaiian media that Gankiewicz had been asked to take over the Miss USA title. Due to pageant protocol, the first runner-up is asked to step in to fulfill the duties of Miss USA should the winner be unable to, and it was announced that Gankiewicz would assume the title of Miss USA 2023 on May 9, 2024. Following this, she became the fifth woman from Hawaii to be crowned Miss USA.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMiss USA official website\nMiss Hawaii USA official website",

        "content": "Archibald Maclaren (2 March 1755 – 1826) was a Scottish playwright.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMaclaren was born in the highlands of Scotland on 2 March 1755, entered the army, and served in the American war under Generals Moore and Clinton. His regiment returned to Scotland to recruit, and in 1783 Mr. Jackson's company produced his farce of the 'Coup de Main' at Edinburgh. On the conclusion of the war he was discharged, and joined Ward's itinerant troop of players at Montrose. He is said to have been a bad exponent of English parts, in consequence of his strong Scottish accent, but in Scottish, Irish, and French characters he was not unsuccessful.\nIn 1794 he enlisted as a sergeant in the Dumbartonshire Highlanders, and went with them to Guernsey, where he was engaged to act as prompter in the theatre, and where several of his pieces were performed. Thence his regiment proceeded to Ireland, and took part in the suppression of the rebellion. While in Ireland he wrote another farce, 'What News from Bantry Bay?' but it was not immediately produced, from fear of the United Irishmen. After the battle of Vinegar Hill he was discharged and went to London, where his dramatic writings afforded precarious support to his family till his death in 1826.\nThe following is a list of his works: \nI. Dramatic Pieces.—\n\nUnless otherwise specified, the above were all published in London.\nII. Prose.—‘A Minute Description of the Battles of Gorey, Arklow, and Vinegar Hill,’ 1798, 12mo, and ‘An Account of the Insurrection in Ireland,’ 1800.\nIII. Poetry.—\n\n‘The Repository’ (songs and poems), 1811.\n‘Coll and Rotha,’ a poem (published with the ‘Swindlers’), 1812.\n‘Poetical Trifles,’ 1825.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Legge, Arthur Edward John (1893). \"Maclaren, Archibald\".

Inaugurated in 1939, the Derby Day races are the oldest continuous bike race in the United States. The original route was a circuit around Lake Sammamish. A contemporary report claims \"everyone in general agreed that this festival should become an annual affair.\"\nThe Derby Days were not held from 1942 to 1945, due to World War II.\nThe 2020 Derby Days were initially cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The city later announced that the festival would be held online, in a \"2020 Virtual Edition.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "revision_id": 1223157838,
        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "In The Colonial Harem, (translated by Myrna Godzich and Wlad Godzich) author Malek Alloula reads Algerian postcards through a post-colonial, feminist lens. The book consists of ten chapters, each focusing and examining a different cliche of the postcard and how it brings the metaphor of the harem to life. Instead of using texts as evidence, Alloula analyzes the formal qualities of the postcards as evidence of the way France systematically devalued Algerian society in order to justify their colonial involvement. Alloula’s criticism of the photographer, a more general idea rather than a specific person, and his studio offers a different perspective to the systematic French colonization of Algeria. \n\n\n== Historical context ==\n\n\n=== French Algeria ===\nFrench Algeria describes the period of time, starting in 1830, where Algeria was under French colonial rule. It was fully annexed as a part of France, and therefore became a common destination for European colonists. \n\n\n=== Postcards ===\nThe postcards featured in The Colonial Harem fall within the Golden Age of Postcards which spans from 1890 to 1915. This time period aligned with the colonial presence of multiple European powers in Africa. Colonial officials, missionaries, and professional photographers were the main producers of postcard images of African colonies. Since postcards, as a medium, work to form visual identities of locations for an outsider audience, colonial postcards functioned as propaganda crafted by colonizers to justify their presence and involvement in foreign nations.\n\n\n== Book synopsis ==\n\n\n=== Introduction ===\nThe introduction is written by Barbara Harlow. She contextualizes the relationship between France and Algeria through depictions of women in the 1966 film The Battle of Algiers. She explains that the postcards collected and examined by Malek Alloula illustrate the colonial oppression and fetishization of Algerian women in the over century-long occupation leading up to the Algerian War for Independence. \n\n\n=== Chapter 1: The Orient as Stereotype and Phantasm ===\nAlloula positions the postcard as a form of photography which is rooted in colonialism. This is because the postcard has the ability to spread an image and identity of a place which is catered to the tourists, soldiers, and colonial powers. He states that his goal with this book is to turn the photographic gaze of the colonizers back onto themselves.\n\n\n=== Chapter 2: Women from the Outside: Obstacle and Transparency ===\nAlongside postcards of veiled Algerian women, Alloula posits that these women have a similar gaze to that of a camera or photographer because all of their body is obscured aside from their eyes. He suggests that photographers' obsession with capturing veiled women in colonial postcards is in part due to their desire to impose power over these women who deny photographer’s entitlement to a voyeuristic gaze.\n\n\n=== Chapter 3: Women’s Prisons ===\nThis chapter deals with the motif of women photographed with iron bars which imply the prison of the harem. Alloula makes clear that these women are models and these locations are sets, both of which work to construct an image of Algeria that caters to western fantasies and voyeurism.\n\n\n=== Chapter 4: Women’s Quarters ===\nAlloula argues that postcards differ from other forms of photography because they are meant to be interpreted as a reflection of reality, not an artistic or constructed image. However, he points out that the genre of Algerian women within their “quarters” is an exception to this claim of realism, because these photographs are so staged that the viewer is forced to consider the photographer’s position in the space.\n\n\n=== Chapter 5: Couples ===\nAttention is brought to the motif of couples within these colonial postcards. Alloula explains that these pairs are not at all representative of Algerian conceptions of family units at the time, and are instead formulated to illustrate justifications for colonialism in a visual language familiar to the French audience. In these completely staged photographs, western family units are constructed with young models burdened with children in order to imply a level of instability which positions the Algerian people as deserving of colonial occupation.\n\n\n=== Chapter 6: The Figures of the Harem: Dress and Jewelry ===\nIn this chapter, Alloula writes about how the women in the postcards were styled. The jewelry and clothes themselves are accurate separately, but the combination of them is where the photographer gets it wrong. By attempting to convey wealth, the photographer reveals the falsity of his postcard. Alloula also highlights who the audience is in this chapter, pointing to tourists, military persons, and colonizers.\n\n\n=== Chapter 7: Inside the Harem: The Rituals ===\nAlloula examines the fictional harem that the photographer creates in this chapter. As a woman-only space, the photographer must replicate the harem in his studio or harem-resembling area, which is a form of deception. The subsequent postcards tell the audience that the photographer has been let in, infiltrating the Algerian woman’s space as a participant. There are three motifs that are common in these postcards: the coffee ceremony (kaoua), the hookah, and the odalisque.\n\n\n=== Chapter 8: Song and Dance: Almehs and Bayaderes ===\nBuilding off of the previous chapter, Chapter 8 also examines rituals within the harem. Alloula writes about how the figures perform for the photographer in this series, rather than an audience. The figures in the images are mimicking dance, but the slow shutter speed of cameras at the time reveal how they are standing frozen rather than caught in motion. This series highlights the hierarchy of colonization and how aspects of Algerian life were eroticized in postcards. Alloula once again points to the postcard’s staged nature and how its image is a reduced representation of real life. \n\n\n=== Chapter 9: Oriental Sapphism ===\nIn this chapter, Alloula looks at sapphic imagery and why it was a common trope in postcards. The photographer’s idea of the harem includes the fact that it is a woman-only space and that this leads to sexual frustration, therefore sapphism is a theme he must include in his postcards. The production of these images was purely for the audience and its implied eroticism is easy to read. The overall image contributes to the generalization of Algerian women. \n\n\n=== Chapter 10: The Colonial Harem: Images of a Suberoticism ===\n\nChapter 10 focuses on breasts in the colonial postcard. Alloula describes three different portrayals the photographer uses. First, the “artistic variant,”where sheer fabric covers the breasts. Second is the “roguish distraction,” in which one breast or both are uncovered but the model is still clothed. Third is the “display,” where all clothing is removed and there are few accessories. The positioning of the photo is also intentional, often taken from the waist or hips up to keep the focus on the breasts. Moving to a broader examination, Alloula labels the postcard as an artistic means of expressing violence under colonization. Tying back into themes from Chapter 1, this last chapter reiterates the idea that the postcards are a form of compensation for the photographer and that they welcome colonists into Algerian society through their staged imagery.\n\n\n== Publication details ==\nOriginal French version, Le Harem Colonial: Images d’un sous érotisme, published in 1981 by Editions Slatkine, Genève-Paris.",

        "content": "Jean-Claude Yon, born Paris, 22 February 1966 is a French academic and historian. He has specialised in the world of 19th century theatre and opera, notably the work of Scribe and Offenbach. He is professor at the Université de Versailles-Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines.\n\n\n== Career ==\nYon entered the École normale supérieure de Fontenay-Saint-Cloud in 1987, obtaining a master's degree in contemporary history with his study Les notaires parisiens sous le Second Empire (Parisian notaries during the Second Empire) which went on to win the Prix Favard de Langlade offered by the Institut international d’histoire du notariat in 1993. His doctoral thesis examined Eugène Scribe, la fortune et la liberté (Eugène Scribe, destiny and freedom) and was defended in January 1994 at the université Panthéon-Sorbonne. Along with Jean-Christophe Keck, Robert Pourvoyer, Peter Hawig and Alain Fraison he was involved in the creation of the Offenbach Edition Keck, a new Offenbach critical edition to be published by Boosey & Hawkes and Bote & Bock. Yon, in his 2000 study, notably advanced understanding of Offenbach's place within the sociological history of his times.\nPrésident of the scientific committee of the 'Unité de formation et de recherche' (training and research unit) in Social Sciences and Humanities of the Université de Versailles-Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines (November 2006 to June 2010), he was elected in June 2009 to the council of UFR, then in October 2010 to the council of the Institut d’études culturelles (IEC) then the council of the Institut d’études culturelles et internationales (IECI).\nProfessor of contemporary history at the Université de Versailles-Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines (2012), in 2014 he became the Director of its Centre d’histoire culturelle des sociétés contemporaines (Centre for cultural history of contemporary society). He was also responsible for projects with the Musée d'Orsay from 1992 to 2006 and co-ordinator of twelve exhibition brochures from 1993 to 2000.\nAs 'Historien spécialiste de l'opéra, écrivain, professeur des universités' Yon was awarded Chevalier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in the summer of 2021.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nYon's preference is to work in collaboration with other fields \"in a multidisciplinary approach and to work with literature, musicology, language and theatrical studies specialists\". He believes that approaches can complement and enrich each other and at the heart of such a collaboration the historian must \"opérer la mise en contexte des œuvres\" (contextualize the works). In relation to Offenbach or Scribe he believes it preferable to confront them through history, literature, performing arts, musicology and law, in connection, for example, with censorship, or the right to whistle in theatres in the 19th century”.\nJean-Claude Yon has organized many symposia and study-days as well as participating in radio broadcasts. He is the author of many articles and books:\n\nOffenbach, exhibition catalogue edited with Laurent Fraison, Réunion des Musées Nationaux, Les Dossiers du Musée d’Orsay, n°58, 1996, 167 p.\nThéophile Gautier, la critique en liberté, exhibition catalogue co-edited with Stéphane Guégan, Réunion des Musées Nationaux, Les Dossiers du Musée d’Orsay, n°62, 1997, 176 p.\nEugène Scribe, la fortune et la liberté, Librairie Nizet, 2000, 390 p.\nJacques Offenbach, Gallimard, « NRF Biographies », 2000, 796 p.\nIn collaboration with Jacques-Olivier Boudon and Jean-Claude Caron, Religion et culture en Europe au XIXe siècle (1800-1914), Armand Colin, « U », 2001, 287 p.\nLe Second Empire, politique, société, culture, Armand Colin, « U », 2004, 256 p.\nHistoire culturelle de la France au XIXe siècle, Armand Colin, « U », 2010, 318 p.\nUne histoire du théâtre à Paris de la Révolution à la Grande Guerre, Paris, Aubier, 2012, 437 p.\nThéâtres parisiens : un patrimoine du XIXe siècle, photographs by Sabine Hartl and Daniel-Olaf Meyer, Paris, Citadelles et Mazenod, 2013\n\n\n== Awards ==\nGrand prix d'histoire du romantisme 2000 de la Maison de Chateaubriand, for Eugène Scribe, la fortune et la liberté.\nPrix Catenacci de l'Académie des beaux-arts et grand prix 2000 de littérature musicale de l'Académie Charles-Cros, for Jacques Offenbach.\nPrix Second Empire 2005 de la Fondation Napoléon et prix Napoléon III 2005 de la Ville de Boulogne-sur-mer, for Le Second Empire.

        "content": "Christian Lilly (died 1738) was a German military engineer.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nLilly commenced his military career in the service of the Dukes of Zelle and Hanover in 1685, and was under the command of Prince Frederick Augustus and of Lieutenant-general Chauvet. He served several campaigns against the Turks in Hungary, and was present at the battle of Grau and the sieges of Neuhausel, Caschaw, Polack, and Buda (1683–6). In 1688 he entered the service of William III, by whom he was naturalised as an Englishman. He served in Scotland in 1689, and in Ireland during the greater part of the war. He was posted to King William's Dutch train of artillery, and served first under Count Solmes at the battle of the Boyne on 1 July 1690, and afterwards under General Ginkell at the first siege of Athlone and the first siege of Limerick, raised on 27 August. On 3 September 1690 he was appointed ensign in Lieutenant-general Douglas's regiment, and quartermaster-general to the grand detachment of the army commanded by that officer. He again served under Ginkell at Ballymore in June 1691, was director of the approaches in the second siege of Athlone during the same month, took part in the battle of Aughrim on 11 July, was engineer at the short siege of Galway which followed, and during August and September at the second siege of Limerick, which ended the war.\nOn 1 May 1692 Lilly was appointed engineer of the office of ordnance, and was sent with the train of artillery upon an expedition under the Duke of Leinster, to make a descent upon the French coast, but this proving unsuccessful, a descent was made upon Flanders instead. By royal warrant of 4 August 1692 he was appointed engineer at 10s. a day to accompany a train of brass ordnance and mortars to the West Indies. In 1693 he was sent with the expedition under Sir Francis Wheler to Barbados, Martinique, the Leeward Islands, New England, and Newfoundland, where besides his post of engineer he had chief command of the artillery train, and was captain of a company of foot. On his return home he was appointed on 30 October 1693 captain in Colonel Lillingston's regiment of foot, and was sent into garrison at Plymouth.\nOn 12 October 1694 the Earl of Romney, master-general of the ordnance, appointed him engineer and to command the train of artillery for the West Indies. He went out with Colonel Lillingston in 1695, and served at the sieges of Cape François and Port à Paix in Hispaniola, which were taken from the French, and he was afterwards stationed at Jamaica. The town of Kingston, Jamaica, was built on plans prepared by Lilly after the old town of Port Royal had been destroyed by earthquake in 1692. On 19 May 1696 he was appointed fireworker to the artillery train, and the same year was sent to Cuba to report on the situation and strength of the Havana, after which he returned to England. On 17 November he was appointed chief engineer of Jamaica at 20s. a day. He repaired the fortifications of Port Royal, and strengthened the fortifications of other parts of the island under Sir William Beeston. In accordance with a warrant of the governor, dated 1 May 1698, Lilly proceeded with the squadron under Admiral Benbow to examine the Spanish ports on the coast of Peru. He visited Portobello, Carthagena, and the Scottish settlements, &c., and returning to England laid reports upon the capabilities of these ports for defence before the king.\nWhen on 24 May 1698 the artillery trains employed in Flanders and at sea were dismissed and a peace train ordered to be formed, Lilly was appointed one of the six engineers at 100l. per annum from 1 May 1698. By royal warrant of 28 June 1701 the king appointed him third engineer of England, his commission to date from 1 July, with a salary of 150l. per annum.\nOn 14 August the same year he was again appointed chief engineer at Jamaica, and accompanied Brigadier-general William Selwyn to the West Indies. He made surveys of Port Royal and other harbours of Jamaica, and was also engaged in repairing and improving the fortifications. On 10 November 1703 Acting Governor Thomas Handasyd appointed him lieutenant-colonel of artillery in Jamaica. On 4 May 1704 the board of ordnance appointed him chief engineer in the West Indies, and instructed him to fortify the island of Barbados under the orders of General Sir Bevil Granville, the governor. On 29 January 1705 Sir Bevill appointed him colonel of artillery at Barbados. In 1707 he was sent to Antigua, Nevis, and St. Kitts, to inquire under General Park into the military condition of those islands. He sent home projects and surveys showing what he considered to be necessary for their defence. On the completion of this duty he returned to Barbados, and resumed the superintendence of the construction of defence works there. On 12 May 1709 the board of ordnance appointed him keeper of the naval ordnance stores at Barbados.\nIn the summer of 1711, under a warrant of the board of ordnance dated 6 March, he proceeded to Newfoundland to report on the harbours of St. John and Ferryland, and to settle matters in controversy relating to the security and fortification of those ports. His reports were transmitted for the information both of the board of ordnance and the board of trade and plantations. He returned to England in 1712, but his friends having just gone out of power, he remained unemployed, receiving only the pay of his appointment of third engineer of Great Britain.\nOn the accession of George I, by royal warrant of 2 March 1714–5, Lilly was continued in the post of third engineer of Great Britain, and by a warrant of the board of ordnance, dated 22 March, was appointed to examine the fortifications of Portland, Dartmouth, Plymouth, Falmouth, and the Scilly Islands; and to survey, repair, and project what might be necessary to maintain and improve the defences of those places. His reports were approved by the board of ordnance, and the form of them was so good that it was adopted for general use. He was then appointed engineer in charge of the Plymouth division, embracing the coast from Portland to the Scilly Islands. This duty he continued to discharge until 1719, when he was called to London.\nFrom 1701 the question of the fire of bombs from mortars and howitzers had engaged Lilly's attention, and he had carried on experiments from time to time to determine a rule for the charges and elevations to be given to such ordnance, in order to secure certain definite ranges. In 1722 he obtained metal from the board of ordnance to construct a small experimental howitzer to carry out trials in a systematic manner. In the same year he petitioned for promotion in the service without success, and he attributed the neglect to his foreign origin, although he spoke English so well that he passed as a born Englishman, ‘except among his competitors for place and their patrons.’ In a fruitless petition for preferment in 1726 he described himself as the oldest engineer in the service, and mentioned that he had been present at fifteen battles and sieges in various countries.\nOn the accession of George II his appointment as third engineer of Great Britain was renewed by royal warrant of 23 December 1727, and his pay was increased from 150l. to 200l. per annum ‘for his further encouragement.’ This pay was independent of any pay for special service. Thus, when he was in Barbados he was drawing in addition 365l. as chief engineer, West Indies; 319l. 7s. 6d. as colonel of artillery; and 146l. as keeper of naval ordnance stores; or 980l. 7s. 6d. in all.\nIn November 1728, after much negotiation, Lilly went out to Jamaica as chief engineer to see after the fortifications and the proposed new settlement at Port Antonio. He arrived at Jamaica on 5 April 1729, to find that the anticipation of a Spanish invasion had led the people of Jamaica to bestir themselves in disciplining the militia and repairing the fortifications. On 4 May he accompanied Governor Hunter in H.M.S. Plymouth to Port Antonio to see what could be done for the security of the place, which was exposed to raids by the Spaniards from S. Jago in Cuba. Lilly remained at Port Antonio for nearly a year, preparing designs for the defences, and suffering much from fever and ague. He was so ill that it was reported home by the masters of some ships from Jamaica that he was dead, and he was in consequence struck off the books for salary for March quarter 1730. He continued, however, to reside in Jamaica, constructing Fort George at Port Antonio and superintending all the other works of defence and barracks in the island. Shortly after his reports and estimates for Fort George were sent in, a sharp contention arose between himself and the governor, who had himself designed a work, respecting the relative merits of their designs. This culminated in Lilly's suspension on 20 August 1733. He appears to have been soon reinstated, as he made official reports as usual to the board of ordnance. On 31 March 1734 Governor Hunter died, and was succeeded the following month by John Ayscough, who appointed Lilly to be captain of Fort Charles, ‘reposing especial trust and confidence in his experience, courage, conduct, fidelity, and skill in military affairs.’ Lilly died in 1738.\nThe following plans drawn by Lilly were placed in the British Museum: \n\n‘The Profile or Elevation of Fort Charles at Port Royal, Jamaica.’ Drawn 1699, 1 sheet.\n‘Drawn Plans and Sections of the Several Buildings in St. Nicholas Island,’ Plymouth, 1716, 1 sheet.\n‘A Drawn Plan of the South Coast of Great Britain, showing the Principal Harbours, Towns, and Fortifications, extracted from several of the best and most modern Surveys, as well as the proper Observations of Colonel Christian Lilly, Engineer,’ 1718, 2 sheets.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Vetch, Robert Hamilton (1893). \"Lilly, Christian\".

For its testimonial value, more than for its aesthetic values, the series of eight oil paintings embedded in the vault of the Colegio de San Albano (Valladolid) where the story of the Vulnerata Virgin, desecrated during the sacking of Cádiz by the English in 1596, deserves to be highlighted.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nCategory:Spanish Baroque painters\nCategory:Year of birth missing\nCategory:1697 deaths",

He was the seventeenth child of Colonel George Weldon (youngest son of Sir Anthony Weldon) and of his wife, Lucy Necton. He was born in London on 12 April (N.S.) 1674, and was christened at the Savoy. Being converted to the catholic religion by Father Joseph Johnstone, he made his abjuration at St. James's Chapel on 12 October 1687. He made his profession as a Benedictine monk in the convent of St. Edmund at Paris on 13 January 1691–2. Although a very learned man, he could never be induced to take priest's orders. He died at St. Edmund's on 23 November 1713.\nHe was the author of ‘A Chronicle of the English Benedictine Monks from the renewing of their Congregation in the days of Queen Mary to the death of King James II’ [London, 1882], 4to. The original manuscript, consisting of two folio volumes of ‘Chronological Notes,’ is preserved at Ampleforth, and there is an abridgment of it at St. Gregory's, Downside.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Cooper, Thompson_Cooper (1899). \"Weldon, Ralph\".

        "content": "Publius Helvius Pertinax the Younger (also Pertinax Minor; 180–212) was a Roman politician, suffect consul of 212 AD and son of Emperor Pertinax. After the latter came to power in 193 AD, the Senate wanted to proclaim Pertinax the Younger as Caesar, but the emperor rejected this proposal. Pertinax the Elder was killed on the 88th day of his reign. His son survived and under Septimius Severus became a flamen of his father's cult, and under Caracalla a suffect consul. He was later executed as a possible contender for Imperial power.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nPublius Helvius Pertinax the Younger was the son of Pertinax, a successful military commander in the Roman-Parthian and Marcomannic Wars, and a Provincial Governor of Moesia, Dacia, Syria and Britain. His mother was Flavia Titiana, daughter of the senator Titus Flavius Sulpicianus. A daughter was also born into this family, but is mentioned in only one source, but there is no information about her; even her name is unknown.\nPertinax the Younger first appears in connection with the events of January 193 AD, when his father was proclaimed emperor after the assassination of Commodus. The son of the new emperor was then still a teenager, so historians date his birth to approximately 180 AD. The senators, having proclaimed Pertinax the Elder emperor, wanted to make his wife Augusta and his son Caesar, but these honors were rejected: \"Let him deserve it\", Pertinax said about his son. Nevertheless, coins with his image and the title Caesar were minted for some time in the eastern provinces (in particular, in Egypt).\nDuring the reign of his father, Pertinax the Younger lived in the house of his maternal grandfather and remained a private citizen. At the end of March 193 AD, Emperor Pertinax was killed by the Praetorian guard, but his son's life was spared. The governor of Pannonia Superior, Lucius Septimius Severus declared himself avenger of the deceased emperor, occupied Rome, proclaimed himself emperor and won the civil war. Septimius Severus established the cult of Pertinax and made Pertinax the Younger a flamen (priest) of this cult.\nPertinax the Younger later served as suffect consul (presumably in 212 AD). However, in the same year he was executed by order of Caracalla. According to Julius Capitolinus, the emperor believed Pertinax was seeking power and that he was very popular and therefore dangerous. A mocking joke by Pertinax at Caracalla's expense made in connection with his murder of his brother Geta: Pertinax proposed calling the emperor the agnomen \"Getacus\" analogous to the title \"Germanicus\".\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Leo Thomas Cleary (June 15, 1894 – April 11, 1955) was an American character actor in radio and film, and a vaudeville comedian and singer, perhaps best known as Dizzy Dean's minor league manager in The Pride of St. Louis, as the Catholic priest in The Red Menace, and as the original Old Ranger on the radio series, Death Valley Days.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nBorn and raised in Boston, Massachusetts, Cleary was the only child of Benjamin Francis Cleary and Mary Clair Lyon. In 1909, the family relocated to Southern California, settling in Pasadena.\nNoted for his expert mimicry and mastery of dialects, Cleary initially employed the standard \"Jewface\" portrayal of that era as his signature routine. Billed variously as \"the Hebrew comedian,\" \"the Yiddish Gazotsky,\" \"the funniest Hebrew on the stage,\" and the \"Ghetto kid,\" while also garnering kudos for his singing, Cleary began performing professionally no later than 1917. By 1919, his wife of seven years, soprano Naomi Plant, had joined the act. \n\n\n=== Radio ===\nIn an interview conducted 14 years after his death, some measure of Cleary's contribution to Lux Radio Theatre's success was provided by former Billboard staffer Dean Owen, who dubbed Cleary the \"pillar [of] Lux Theatre's stock company.\"\nOn April 20, 1942, Cleary appeared in Lux Radio Theatre's adaptation of the 1941, Oscar-nominated biographical drama, One Foot in Heaven, portraying Preston Thurston, the part played by Gene Lockhart in the film. \nBetween 1935 and 1938, Cleary was part of a popular radio comedy team sometimes known as \"Nuts and Bolts\"—\"Nuts\" being Cleary and \"Bolts\" his fellow vaudeville alumnus, Ken Gillum. In March 1937, the pair went from being heard locally—on programs produced, respectively, in Los Angeles and New York—to being broadcast nationally over the NBC Blue Network.\nOne of Cleary's most substantial non-recurring roles was the protagonist of \"My Brother Abe,\" an episode of the short-lived series Proudly We Hail, featuring a tremendously wealthy centenarian and his impatient heirs; \"Abe\" refers not only to his late, lamented brother, who had died at Gettysburg, but to the like-named late President, with whom he had had the good fortune to correspond.\n\n\n=== Film ===\nNotwithstanding a film career confined strictly to small supporting roles, the lion's share uncredited, Cleary did manage, in at least two of the four films in which he received an onscreen credit, to elicit reviewers' acknowledgement of his good work; namely, the 1950 prison drama, State Penitentiary, in which he doubles as the Warden and Narrator, and the 1952 baseball biopic, The Pride of St. Louis, in which Cleary portrays Ed Monroe, Dizzy Dean's minor league manager.  \n\n\n=== Miscellany ===\nIn 1940, Cleary was invited to a gathering of 50 members of the local Rotary Club in Arcadia, California, convened to honor the branch's outgoing president, John Vanderbur, who, in turn, received the brunt of Cleary's \"ribbing,\" much to the amusement of those present.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n== Personal life and death ==\nFrom May 18, 1912 until his death, Cleary was married to Naomi Aloha Plant.  They had two sons, Jack and Richard. The latter had a brief acting career of his own during the late 1940s and early 50s, most notably with a substantial role in both the original Broadway run and subsequent tour of Stalag 17.\nAs of January 1920, and continuing through at least May of that year, Cleary owned the company, Leo's Auto Painting Shop, offering \"first class work\" and \"moderate prices\". \nJudging from an article published by The Pasadena Post in March 1920 (dubbing him \"the famous Elk comedian\"), Cleary was, at the very least, a member of the Elks Lodge for very near his entire adult life.\nOn April 11, 1955, Cleary died of kidney failure at Van Nuys Valley Hospital, Survived by his mother, wife, sons and four grandchildren, Cleary's cremated remains are interred at Rose Hills Memorial Park in Whittier, California.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nPalmer, Zuma (January 4, 1951). \"Studio Audiences Always Provide Interesting Studies in Behavior\".

        "content": "The Mladezhka reka (Bulgarian: Младежка река) is a 40 km long river in southeastern Bulgaria, a left tributary of the Veleka, which flows into the Black Sea. \nThe river takes its source at an altitude of 486 m some 800 m southeast of the summit of Batak Cheshma (509 m) on the Bulgaria–Turkey border. Along its whole course it flows in a deep densely forested valley, initially in direction northeast until the village of Mladezhko and then in direction southeast until its mouth. The Mladezhka reka flows into the Veleka at an altitude of 96 m about 2 m east of the historic locality of Petrova Niva. \nIts drainage basin covers a territory of 232 km2, or 23.3% of the Veleka's total. The river has typically Mediterranean characteristics with high water in February and low water in August. The average flow at the crossing of the first class I-9 road is 1.01 m3/s.\nThe Mladezhka reka flows entirely in Burgas Province. There one settlement along its course, the village of Mladezhko in Malko Tarnovo Municipality. Its waters are among the cleanest in Bulgaria and are not diverted for economic purposes. Its whole valley is part of the Strandzha Nature Park and its lower course is located in the Paroria protected area, which sheltered an important monastic community in the 14th century during the Second Bulgarian Empire. The historic locality of Petrova Niva at the mouth of the Mladezhka reka was the starting point of the 1903 Bulgarian Ilinden–Preobrazhenie Uprising against the Ottoman Empire in the Strandzha region.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\nМичев (Michev), Николай (Nikolay); Михайлов (Mihaylov), Цветко (Tsvetko); Вапцаров (Vaptsarov), Иван (Ivan); Кираджиев (Kiradzhiev), Светлин (Svetlin) (1980).

        "content": "John Jones, also known as Leander à Sancto Martino, (1575 – 17 December 1636) was a Welsh Benedictine monk.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nJones was born in 1575. He belonged to a family settled at Llan Wrinach, Brecknockshire, and was connected with the Scudamore family of Kentchurch, Herefordshire. Ralph Weldon asserts that Jones was removed from Wales to England when scarcely a year old (Chronicle of the Benedictine Monke, p. 100). His parents. who were Protestants, sent him to Merchant Taylors' School, London, in 1584, and there he studied with Lancelot Andrewes and William Juxon, afterwards bishop of London, On 15 October 1591 he was elected a scholar of St John's College, Oxford, where he was chamber-fellow with William Laud. He obtained a fellowship in his college, and was admitted to the degree of B.C.L. on 16 July 1600. 'His mind being much inclined to the Roman religion,' he quit the university, and within a few days of his arrival in London his parents died of the plague. Thereupon Jones left England for Spain, was received into the English Collage at Valladolid, then under the direction of the jesuits, 20 December 1596, and took the college oath on the feast of St. Alban, 1597. In October 1599 he was admitted into the Benedictine abbey of St. Martin at Compostella, and became a monk of that order, taking, in religion, the name of Leander à Sancto Martino. He passed brilliantly through his theological studies in the university of Salamanca, was ordained priest, and, after graduating D.D., continued his studies for about six years in Spanish monasteries.\nAlthough ordered to the English mission, Jones acted successively as novice-master at the abbey of St. Remigiua at Rhelms, and at St. Gregory's at Douay. He was also for nearly twenty-five years professor of theology, and taught Hebrew in the college of Marchiennes, or in that of St. Vedast, in the university of Douay. In 1612 he became vicar-general of the Anglo-Spanish Benedictines. When in 1619 the present English Benedictine congregation was formally approved by Pope Paul V, Jones was elected its first president-general for the usual triennial period, and wua re-elected in 1633. According to decrees of the general chapter of the Benedictine congregation, he acted as prior of St. Gregory's at Douay from 1621 to 1628, and from 1629 to 1633. In 1629 he was appointed abbot of Cisniar, and in 1633 received the titular diguity of cathedral prior of Canterbury.\nJones frequently visited England, and enjoyed special protection through the agency of his friends at court. When early in 1634 Urban VIII determined to send an accredited agent to England to open diplomatic relations he chose Jones for the important mission. Jones displayed a general spirit of good sense and moderation, and took the oath of allegiance on 17 December 1634, appending to it a declaration that the pope had no dispensing power in regard to the oath (Clarendon State Papers, 1. 210). In letlers addressed by him to Cardinal Barberini, he sought to refute charges of minimising the Pope's pretensions and the claims of the Catholics. The negotiations led to no practical result. But Francis Harris, a secular priest who had conformed to the established church, deposed in 1643, before the lords' committee appointed to take the examinations in the case of Archbishop Laud, that Father Leander, 'by the common report of papists and priests, both abroad and in England, was very familiar with the said archbishop, and came over on purpose into England ... to negotiate with the said archbishop about matters of religion, to make a reconciliation between the church of Rome and England' (Prynne, Canterburie's Doome, pp. 411, 412). Laud denied the truth of this accusation.\nJones died in London on 17 December (O.S.) 1636, and was buried in the chapel of the Capuchin friars in Somerset House. Wood describes him as 'the ornament of the English Benedictines in his time,' adding that 'he was a person of extraordinary eloquence generally knowing in all arts and sciences, beloved of all that knew him and his worth, and hated by none but by the puritans and jesuits (Athenæ Oxon. ed. Bliss, ii. 604).\nThe following works were written or edited by him : \n\n' Biblia Sacra cum glossa ordinaria, ordinaria, primum quidem a Strabo Fuldensi . . . nunc vero novis Patrum cum Græcorum tum Latinorum explicationibus locupletata, postilla Nicolai Lyrani . . . nec non additionibus Pauli Burgensis episcopi et M.

        "content": "Donia Abu Talib aka Dunya Abutaleb (born c. 1997) is a Saudi Arabian taekwondo competitor. She is the first Saudi woman to qualify for an Olympics on her own merit.\n\n\n== Life ==\nTalib was born in about 1997. At Saudi schools, girls were not allowed to exercise. When she was eight her father introduced her to the Korean sport of taekwondo which was an unusual sport in Saudi Arabia and particularly for a girl. She was in a club until she was thirteen but she was then banned from the club because she was a girl. However she continued to practice at home. Talib's status is unusual. As recently as 2012 Saudi Arabia were told that if they did not have any female athletes in the Olympics then they would not be invited to the competition. In 2012 there were two Saudi women to the Olympics in London. \nShe competed at the Saudi games and she was one of four athletes from Saudi Arabia who competed at the 2022 World Taekwondo Championships in Guadalajara, Mexico and she was the only female. The other three were Fahd Al-Samih, Riyad Al-Dhafiri and Ali Al-Mabrouk who compete in the 54, 58 and 80 kg categories. Talib's category is 49 kg. They share a coach who is Kurban Bogdaev and he is from Russia. She came third in the flyweight category in Mexico. At the 2022 Asian games she also came third in her category.\nIn 2024, her country's record on women's rights was reported as \"abysmal\". In the same year Talib became the first Saudi woman ever to qualify for a place at an Olympics. All women previously had been given a place because of quotas. Talib's place was entirely on merit and this news was welcomed by the Saudi Minister of Sport Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al Faisal. Her achievement and the minister's reaction were widely reported as a significant event.\n\n\n== References ==",

He made his first film A Hometown in Heart (1949) in South Korea before defecting to the North to pursue his filmmaking career.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nYoon was born in 1913 in Daegu, Korea, Empire of Japan. He defected to North Korea before the outbreak of the 1950–1953 Korean War, and worked as director of North Korea's National Film Studio (국립영화촬영소) in 1952.\nThe classic A Hometown in Heart, released on DVD in 2011 by the Korean Federation of Film Archives and on Blu-ray in 2023 by Blue Kino, was one of the most important films made in Korea after its liberation from Japan.

        "content": "Terry Allen Kupers M.D., M.S.P. is a psychiatrist and expert on correctional mental health and the detrimental effects of solitary confinement. He is known for his expertise in the fields of psychoanalytic psychotherapy, forensic psychiatry, and community mental health. He is Professor Emeritus at the Wright Institute in Berkeley, California. His forensic psychiatry experience includes testimony in multiple large class action lawsuits concerning jail and prison conditions, sexual abuse behind bars, and the quality of mental health services within correctional facilities.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nKupers was born on October 14, 1943, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the third of six children born to Edward Carlton Kupers, M.D. and Frances Shirley Kupers (nee Praissman).His father was a doctor who served in the Army Air Force during WWII and his mother was a nurse and caregiver to their six children. Kupers attended public schools in Los Angeles and graduated from Fairfax High School in 1960, where he was a member of the Ephebians honor society.\n\n\n== Education ==\nKupers graduated from Stanford University in 1964 with a BA in Psychology. In 1968, he graduated from UCLA School of Medicine. He completed an internship at Kings County Hospital and Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, New York in 1969. Following his internship, Kupers undertook a three-year Psychiatry Residency at the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute, spending an elective year at the Tavistock Institute in England studying object relations theory and brief psychotherapy. He later pursued a postdoctoral fellowship at the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute, specializing in social and community psychiatry, and earned his master's degree in Social Psychiatry in 1974.\n\n\n== Career ==\nSince 1977, Kupers has been actively involved in community mental health and forensic psychiatry. He began his forensic pscyhiatry career by providing expert testimony in the case of Rutherford vs. Pitchess, where prisoners sued Los Angeles County because their jail violated their human rights. He also provided testimony in the case of Ashker v. Brown, which ended the use of long-term solitary confinement at Pelican Bay State Prison in California.\nIn 1981, Kupers joined the faculty of the Wright Institute's Clinical Psychology program, where he is now a professor emeritus. Over the years, Kupers has taught a variety of courses, both at the Wright Institute and at other graduate schools in Los Angeles and San Francisco. Classes he has taught include Basic Psychoanalytic Concepts, Social Psychopathology, Brief Psychotherapy, and Forensic and Correctional Mental Health.\nKupers has served as a consultant for various human and civil rights campaigns, including those of Human Rights Watch and Disability Rights California.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nKupers is the author of five books and the editor of two others. He has also written nearly one hundred articles and book chapters. His first three books, Public Therapy, Ending Therapy, and Revisioning Men’s Lives, cover a wide range of topics, including public mental health, psychoanalytic theory, toxic masculinity and gender theory. His two most recent books, Prison Madness and Solitary, focus on mental health, the damaging conditions of confinement, and human rights issues in the carceral system, particularly in solitary confinement. Kupers also wrote an essay as part of the book Hell Is a Very Small Place, a collection of essays by those who have experienced solitary confinement and experts in the field.\n\n\n== Accolades ==\nKupers is a Distinguished Life Fellow of the American Psychiatric Association. He received the Exemplary Psychiatrist Award from the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) in 2005, the William Rossiter Award for his global contributions to forensic mental health from the Forensic Mental Health Association of California in 2009, the Gloria Huntley Award from NAMI in 2020, and the Judge Stephen Goss Lifetime Achievement Award from the Judges and Psychiatrists Leadership Initiative and the Council of State Governments in 2024.\n\n\n== Notes ==",

        "content": "Samuel Collier (b. around 1595, d. 1622) was an English boy who arrived in Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607 aboard the Susan Constant, one of the three founding ships. He served as the page to captain John Smith, and later as an Algonquian interpreter for the colony.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nCollier was born around 1595 in London, England.\n\n\n=== Jamestown colonist ===\nCollier is listed among the 104 colonists on the Virginia Company of London's manifest, and was one of four boys in the first group of settlers to Jamestown. He served as a servant and page to captain John Smith and accompanied Smith on his explorations into the unknown parts of Virginia. Collier was likely around 12-13 years old in 1607 which was a normal age for apprenticeships in England. Collier accompanied Smith for his first meeting with Powhatan and Pocahontas.\nAccording to contemporary historians, Collier was sent by Smith to learn the language of the Algonquian-speaking Warraskoyack tribe of the Powhatan Confederacy, and later served the colony as an interpreter. He befriended weroance (chief) Tackonekintaco during that period. Collier was held in high esteem by Smith as a respected member of the community.\n\n\n== Death ==\nAccording to Smith's accounts, Collier died in 1622 aged 26-27 due to accidental friendly fire of an English sentinel during the Powhatan Uprising.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nCollier's story has been fictionalized in several children's books and in young adult literature. The 2001 book Surviving Jamestown: The Adventures Of Young Sam Collier by Gail Langer Karwoski provides a fictional account of Collier's journey to the New World and his life in Jamestown.\nCollier is a character in the 2000 book titled 1609: Winter of the Dead by Elizabeth Massie.\nIn 2007, a children's historical semi-fiction book by Candice F. Ransom was published titled Sam Collier and the Founding of Jamestown, which describes Collier's adventures in Virginia.\nA children's book about Collier was written by Elisa Carbone titled Blood in the River, which centers on his travels with John Smith.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "If We Burn: The Mass Protest Decade and the Missing Revolution is a 2023 political history and journalism book by author and journalist Vincent Bevins. The book concerns the wave of mass protests during the 2010s decade and examines the question of how the organization and tactics of such protests resulted in a \"missing revolution,\" in that most of these movements appear to have failed in their goals and even led to a \"record of failures, setbacks, and cataclysms\". The title refers to a protest sign during the 2014 Hong Kong protests which quoted The Hunger Games line, \"If we burn, you burn with us.\"\nThe book begins by tracing the history of left wing activism from the end of the October Revolution, through the New Left and into the present day. In particular, it traces the history of Vanguardism in left wing movement politics and the shift toward distributed, horizontal structures in mass protest movements since the early 20th century. The final chapter assesses the problems with the horizontally-structured movements of the 2010s and observes that the lack of central leadership enabled media misrepresentation of movement interests which subsequently defused and dissipated the energy and efficacy of the movements. Simultaneously, the lack of leadership structure also allowed right-wing groups to coopt social movements for their own purposes, leading in part to a full reversal of momentum as in Brazil.\nThe book draws on four years of research and hundreds of interviews, including with many of the original organizers of major protest movements. Bevins admits to not being a neutral observer: he was an active participant in the Movimento Passe Livre in Brazil. The book stems in part from observations on the failure of that movement and Bevins is clear to indicate where his own actions alter the trajectory of the movement.\nMovements included in the book, inter alia:\n\nMovimento Passe Livre, in Brazil\nArab Spring, particularly in Tunisia and Egypt\nOccupy Wall Street, in the United States\n2014 Hong Kong protests\nEuromaidan, in Ukraine\n\n\n== Reception ==\nAccording to literary review aggregator Lit Hub, the book received mostly \"Positive\" reviews. It currently has a score of 4.31 stars on Goodreads.\n\"I was not expecting this, but I think If We Burn is even better than The Jakarta Method.\"—Benjamin Fogel, editor at Jacobin\n\nWriting for The New Republic, Osita Nwanevu agreed that future protest movements should take Bevins' conclusions into account, but critiqued the implicit horizontalism of the protest movements themselves:Lenin aside, this is all rather commonsensical—or at least it ought to have been for the movements surveyed. Change is best pursued with a particular tactical or ideological direction in mind, clearly; without a designated leader or group of leaders to set that direction—a \"vanguard,\" if one prefers—one cannot predict the direction a movement will ultimately take, or what ideas and actors might prevail in the aftermath of a movement toppling the existing political order.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "James Hutton (3 September 1715 – 3 May 1795) was an English Moravian minister and bookseller.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHutton the son of the Rev. John Hutton by Elizabeth Ayscough. He was born in London on 3 September 1715. The father, a nonjuring clergyman who had resigned his living, resided in College Street, Westminster, where he took Westminster boys to board. He was a friend of Dr. Burney. James Hutton was educated at Westminster, and was apprenticed to Mr. Innys, a bookseller of St. Paul's Churchyard. About 1736 he opened a bookshop of his own at the Bible and Sun, west of Temple Bar. But he never paid much attention to business. Before the end of his apprenticeship he had met the Wesleys at Oxford, and when they left for Georgia in 1735 he accompanied 'them to Gravesend; in 1738 and 1739 he published Whitefield's 'Journal.' In London Hutton soon started a small society for prayer, and corresponded with many Methodists; his mother remained a strong churchwoman, and wrote to Samuel Wesley, who was not of his brother's way of thinking, that John Wesley was her son's pope. But Hutton had in 1737 been introduced by John Wesley to Peter Bohler and two other Moravian brethren then on their way to Georgia, and thenceforth he inclined to Moravianism. In 1739 he set out for Germany, where he visited the Moravian congregations, and began a correspondence with Nicolaus Zinzendorf. When John Wesley was separating himself from the Moravians, he made a vain attempt in 1739 to induce Hutton to follow his example, and in 1740, after Wesley had induced several members of Hutton's society, which met then at the Fetter Lane Chapel, to abandon it for his Foundry Society, the disruption between Hutton and himself was complete. They were subsequently reconciled, and Wesley noted in his ‘Journal' after Hutton had paid him a visit that he believed Hutton would be saved, but as by fire.\nHutton was till his death an active Moravian leader. He often visited Germany, and in 1741 became, by August Gottlieb Spangenberg's advice, one of the founders of the Society for the Furtherance of the Gospel, and acted as 'referendary' for many years. 'Pray,’ Lord Shelburne asked him, in the course of an interview in which the projected Moravian mission to Labrador was discussed, 'on what footing are you with the Methodists? 'They kick us whenever they can,' answered Hutton. George III, the queen, and Benjamin Franklin were among Hutton's acquaintances. On 3 May 1795 Hutton died at Oxted Cottage, near Godstone, Surrey, where he had lived for nearly two years with the Misses Biscoe and Shelley. He was buried in the burying-ground adjoining the chapel at Chelsea. Hutton married at Marrenborn, 3 July 1740, Louise Brandt, a Swiss Moravian, whose grandfather had been advocate of Neuchatel, Zinzendorf performing the ceremony. He left no family. His wife seems to have lapsed occasionally, as on 4 November 1771 'a letter from Brother Hutton, apologising for the uncongregation-like fashion of his wife's gown, was read.' Hutton may be called the founder of the Moravian church in England, although Cominius and other teachers had visited this country before, A portrait of Hutton, with his ear-trumpet, by Richard Cosway, was engraved in mezzotint by John Raphael Smith in 1786; another engraving by W. Wickes is prefixed to Benham's 'Memoir.' Hutton wrote ' An Essay towards giving some just ideas of the Personal Character of Count Zinzendorf ...,' London, 1755, 8vo.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Archbold, William Arthur Jobson (1891). \"Hutton, James (1715-1795)\".

        "content": "Diario Expreso is a daily newspaper with national circulation in Peru. Founded in 1961, it is among the newspapers with the highest circulation in Peru.\n\n\n== History ==\nIt was founded on October 24, 1961, by Manuel Mujica Gallo, a wealthy owner linked to the banking and insurance business. For this purpose, the company Periodística Perú S. A. was established. In this first stage, its editors were Manuel Jesús Orbegoso, Raúl Villarán, José Antonio Encinas de Pando, among others.\nIn 1965, it was acquired by Manuel Ulloa Elías, who founded Editora Nacional S. A. The same company published the evening newspaper Extra. In this new stage, Efraín Ruiz Caro and Guillermo Cortez Núñez were editors-in-chief. Among his collaborators were Ciro Alegría, Carlos Cueto Fernandini, Manuel Mujica Gallo and Mario Vargas Llosa. A Sunday supplement entitled Estampas was also published; and as a contribution to education, the supplement El Escolar.\nWith the rise of a military government in 1968, difficulties began. On October 31 of that year, Expreso and Extra were closed by order of the regime of General Juan Velasco Alvarado. However, a protest by the Federation of Journalists of Peru forced the Government to allow the newspapers to reopen.\nOn January 2, 1970, Manuel Ulloa resigned as president of the board of directors of Editora Nacional S. A. because a Government decree prevented those who resided outside the country for more than six months from exercising such function. Ulloa, who had been an important minister of the overthrown Belaundista government, chose not to return to Peru after considering that a political persecution had been unleashed against him.\nOn March 4, 1970, Expreso and Extra were practically expropriated by the military government, with the excuse of handing over their administration to their own employees and workers, organized in cooperatives. However, people outside the newspapers took control of them. In this stage of expropriation, the following served as directors of Expreso: Alberto Ruiz Eldredge, Leopoldo Chiappo and Juan José Vega, all appointed by the government. Some time later, Velasco explained that he had given the newspapers to the communists to serve as \"mastiffs\" (prey dogs) in his \"fight against the oligarchy.\"\nAfter the revolutionary government ended on July 28, 1980, Expreso and Extra returned to their owners, and Manuel Ulloa took over again as president of the board of Editora Nacional S. A. The first director of Expreso, in this new stage, was Guillermo Cortez Núñez (1980–1988), who was succeeded by Manuel D'Ornellas (1988–1998). It then had a prestigious team of journalists, among which Jaime de Althaus, Jorge Morelli, Uri Ben Schmuel and Patricio Ricketts stood out.\nDuring the government of Alberto Fujimori (1990–2000), the newspaper's directors were committed to selling their editorial line to the interests of the regime. After the fall of Fujimori, the imprisonment of the newspaper's director, Eduardo Calmell del Solar, was ordered, accused of having received, together with Vicente Silva Checa (director of Cable Canal de Noticias), more than US$ 3,000,000 from presidential advisor Vladimiro Montesinos.\nIn 2002, a new organization came into operation under the direction of Luis García Miró, whose objective was to recover the prestige of the newspaper. Since 2024, the director is Antonio Ramírez Pando.\n\n\n== See also ==\nEl Comercio Group\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Babyjohn Choi Hon Yick (Chinese: 蔡瀚億; born Choi Ming Yin; 8 December 1986) is a Hong Kong actor. Debuting as Leung in the sports drama film The Way We Dance (2013), the role earned Choi Best New Performer in the 33rd Hong Kong Film Awards, and he later reprised it in the sequel The Way We Keep Dancing (2021). Choi went on to star in various productions after his first film role, including the horror film Twilight Online (2014), martial arts film Ip Man 3, crime film Imprisoned (both 2015), and comedy film The Yuppie Fantasia 3 (2017). He landed his first sole leading role as Tim Cheung in the horror film Vampire Cleanup Department (2017), followed by a breakout performance as a sacrificing policeman in the action film Shock Wave (2017). He also starred as Cel in the Storm Film Series, beginning with L Storm (2018) and concluded with the series finale G Storm (2021), and Lo Man Nai in the ViuTV drama series No One Lies (2023).\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBabyjohn Choi was born Choi Ming Yin on 8 December 1986 in Hong Kong. He grew up in Mei Foo and was raised by his grandparents. He began learning piano when he was three and later passed ABRSM Grade 8 when he was in Form 4. His parents changed his name to Choi Hon Yick while he was studying in primary school due to feng shui. He later attended Wah Yan College, Kowloon, and spent most of his time in secondary school joining bands and playing music. When he was in Form 2, he participated in a school drama performance of West Side Story, portraying the character Baby John. The experience sparked his interest in performing, and he changed his English name to Babyjohn after his first acting role to remind himself of his passion. He took business subjects for the Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination, but did not perform well, scoring only a pass in five subjects. Determined to pursue a career in acting, he intended to apply for the Hong Kong Academy of Performing Arts, but missed the deadline after receiving his HKCEE results. He then took a gap year to learn jazz music, guitar, and drums, and reapplied to HKAPA the following year. While in university, Choi formed a band and took part in the school's musical performances. He graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in performing arts in 2009. In the same year, Choi auditioned and won the role as Leung in the film The Way We Dance, but production did not begin until 2013. During the interval, he worked several jobs to make a living, including teaching music, performing in a theatre company, and filming advertisements. He left the theatre company after filming commenced.\n\n\n== Career ==\nChoi auditioned and won his debut role as Leung in the 2013 drama film The Way We Dance, where he portrayed the chairman of a university Tai Chi club who collaborated with a street dancer, portrayed by Cherry Ngan, to invent original dance choreographies incorporating Tai Chi moves. His performance was well received, for which he won Best New Performer in the 33rd Hong Kong Film Awards and was nominated for Best Newcomer in the 8th Asian Film Awards with the role. Choi began receiving film role offers after his breakout performance, starring in the lead role in the horror film Twilight Online, and voicing private investigator Bobby Mak in the animated comedy film McDull: Me & My Mum the following year. In 2015, Choi took on lead roles in the comedy film 12 Golden Ducks and crime film Imprisoned: Survival Guide for Rich and Prodigal, as well as minor roles in action films SPL II: A Time for Consequences and Ip Man 3. Choi was also cast in lead roles in the 2016 crime films House of Wolves and Fooling Around Jiang Hu.\nIn 2017, Choi was cast as the sole male lead in Chiu Sin Hang's horror romance film Vampire Cleanup Department, portraying Tim Cheung, a vampire hunter who posed as a street janitor and developed romantic entanglements with a female vampire played by Lin Min Chen. He also starred in lead roles in the comedy film The Yuppie Fantasia 3 and the drama film 29+1. Choi gained further recognition in the 2017 action film Shock Wave as an off-duty cop who sacrificed himself in a bomb attack by terrorists. The film's director Herman Yau handpicked Choi for the role after watching The Way We Dance and was impressed by his acting. Although the role was minor, Choi's performance received universal praise and was described as \"tear-jerking\". He also took on lead roles as Fung the gangster in the black comedy film The Sinking City Capsule Odyssey, starring alongside Pakho Chau and Louis Cheung, and as a wealthy playboy Si Tak Wah in the TVB drama series Oh My Grad, at the invitation of his APA classmate Wong Cho-lam.\nThe following year, Choi landed a recurring role as Cel, an ICAC officer, in the Storm Film Series, starting with the 2018 film L Storm and reprised his role in the 2019 sequel P Storm. Choi also took on a lead role in the mystery thriller film Guilt by Design, which featured an ensemble cast including Nick Cheung, Kent Cheng, Elaine Jin, Cecilia So, Jo Kuk, and Jiro Lee. He then starred in a main role in another TVB drama series, I Bet Your Pardon, produced by Wong Jing. In 2019, Choi ended his contract with his artist agency HMV Digital China and founded his own talent company, Made in Kami. He also became one of the regular hosts of the food-themed talk show Foodie Talkies on ViuTV since December 2019. He reprised a separate role in Shock Wave 2, a standalone sequel to the 2017 film, in 2020.\nIn 2021, Choi made a cameo appearance as a janitor, which resembles his character in Vampire Cleanup Department, in another Chiu Sin Hang's film One Second Champion. He also reprised his role as Leung in The Way We Dance's sequel The Way We Keep Dancing, and as Cel in G Storm, the final installment of the Storm Film Series. He did not receive any acting roles for a year during the COVID-19 pandemic and instead focused his time on writing screenplays. In 2023, Choi made his debut on ViuTV as the sole male lead in the drama series No One Lies, portraying Lo Man Nai, a morally dubious businessman who was drugged with truth serum. He also starred in supporting lead roles in the psychological thriller film Shadows and the action thriller film Death Notice.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nChoi is a Christian. He is also an enthusiast of the Japanese tea ceremony and has been practicing it for nine years.\nChoi married stage actress Donut Cheung in 2013, his classmate at Hong Kong Academy of Performing Arts, after being in a relationship for seven years.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBabyjohn Choi at IMDb",

        "content": "Lodge Plugs were a British manufacturer of spark plugs based in Birmingham and Rugby, Warwickshire.\nThe company had its origins in the work of Sir Oliver Lodge (1851-1940), who was a pioneer in the field of electromagnetism. Two of his sons Brodie and Alexander Lodge, decided to turn their father's discoveries onto a commercial venture. They set up business in Birmingham in 1904 as the Lodge Brothers. Initially, the Sphinz Sparking Plug Company produced spark plugs for them in Birmingham, but they later established their own factory.\nIn 1913 the Lodge Brothers amalgamated with the Mascot Company of Rugby, which had been founded by another inventor Bernard Hopps, who had left the British Thomson-Houston company in 1908 to start his own business. The new firm was called the Lodge Sparking Plug Company Ltd. Following the merger, production initially took place in part of the Hunter's Lamp factory in Lower Hillmorton Road, Rugby and later on in Albert Street, before a dedicated factory was opened on St Peter's Road, Rugby, in 1916, whilst the main offices remained in Birmingham. In 1919, the name was shortened to Lodge Plugs Ltd\nAlexander Lodge died in 1938, leaving Hopps and Brodie in control of the firm. In 1949 Brodie retired from the company after 45 years, and the company was launched on the stock exchange, with Hopps becoming its Chairman and Managing Director. In 1961 the company was purchased by Smiths Industries, who already owned KLG Plugs. The Lodge Plugs brand name continued to be used until 1982. The factory on St Peter's Road, continued under the name of Smiths Industries Ceramics, until 1992, when it was sold to Morgan Matroc.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"De Carolina\" (transl. \"From Carolina\") is a song recorded by Puerto Rican singer Rauw Alejandro and Puerto Rican producer DJ Playero for Alejandro's third studio album, Saturno (2022). It was written by Alejandro, while the production was handled by Caleb Calloway, Kenobi, Alejandro, and DJ Playero. The song was released by Sony Music on December 8, 2022, as the fourth single from the album.\n\n\n== Background and release ==\nRauw Alejandro released his second studio album, Vice Versa on June 25, 2021. The album debuted at number one on Billboard Top Latin Albums, giving Alejandro his first number one on the chart, and was ranked as the third-best album of 2021 and the best Spanish-language album of the year by Rolling Stone. In September 2022, he announced that he was going to release his third album in November and it would be titled Saturno. On November 10, 2022, he revealed the album's track list, mentioning it being set for release the following day. The album was released for digital download and streaming by Sony Music Latin and Duars Entertainment on the specified date, and \"De Carolina\" was included as the 17th track on the album. On December 8, 2022, the track was released as the fourth single from the album.\n\n\n== Music and lyrics ==\n\"De Carolina\", which translates to \"From Carolina\" in English, is a heartfelt homage to Alejandro's hometown, Carolina, Puerto Rico, where reggaeton thrived in the 1990s. He merges his modern reggaeton vision with Playero's classic style, incorporating rave-ready beats and a sped-up sample of \"La Gente Sabe\" to pay tribute to the city and the Puerto Rican duo Maicol & Manuel. The track is a fusion of old and new, with Playero's signature dembow beats enhanced by Alejandro's contemporary electronic flair, including bubbling synths, a pulsating bassline, and static blasts. The song was written by Alejandro, while the production was handled by Caleb Calloway, Kenobi, Alejandro, and DJ Playero. It runs for a total of three minutes and one second. The lyrics include, \"Somos de Carolina y venimos virao\" (\"We are from Carolina, and we are coming to party\").\n\n\n== Credits and personnel ==\nCredits adapted from Tidal.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"I Wanna Change the Score\" is a song by English musician Tony Banks featuring English singer Nik Kershaw. It was released by Virgin on 7 May 1991 as the lead single from Banks's third solo studio album, Still. The song was written by Banks and Kershaw, and produced by Banks and Nick Davis. It reached number 76 in the UK Singles Chart.\n\n\n== Background ==\nTony Banks collaborated with Nik Kershaw after getting in contact with him by phone. Banks became an admirer of Kershaw after getting a copy of his 1989 album The Works. He later recalled the album had \"some wonderful stuff on it\" and liked Kershaw's voice. Banks told Sound on Sound in 1991, \"He was very enthusiastic about working with me, and it was nice that he decided to sing my songs, seeing as he'd never sung for anyone else.\" Kershaw co-wrote two tracks with Banks and provided vocals on them and another track for Banks' album Still: \"Red Day on Blue Street\", \"I Wanna Change the Score\" and \"The Final Curtain\".\n\n\n== Release ==\nAlthough Kershaw's name appeared alongside Banks's on the single's picture sleeve, it was omitted on the vinyl's label by Virgin Records. Banks told Simon Mayo in 1991, \"I wanted to have the [single] as 'Nik Kershaw with Tony Banks' but the record company said people would probably think it was Nik's record anyway and they were worried it might not be associated with the [new] album. But they weren't supposed to go as far as leaving his name off!\"\n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe song's music video was directed by Nick Willing. It features Banks and Kershaw performing the song as the background changes to show them in different locations and settings.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nUpon its release as a single, Music & Media called \"I Wanna Change the Score\" a \"catchy track\". Andrew Hirst of the Huddersfield Daily Examiner noted that the \"artful chorus is badly let down by the bland bits inbetween\". Marcus Hodge of the Cambridge Evening News commented, \"Kershaw sounds remarkably like his protege, Chesney Hawkes, but he seems to have given Chesney his best song as this is quite dreary.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n7–inch single (UK and Europe) and cassette single (UK)\n\n\"I Wanna Change the Score\" – 4:29\n\"Hero for an Hour\" – 4:41\n12–inch single (UK and Europe)\n\n\"I Wanna Change the Score\" – 4:29\n\"Hero for an Hour\" – 4:41\n\"Big Man\" – 4:10\nCD single (UK)\n\n\"I Wanna Change the Score\" – 4:29\n\"Hero for an Hour\" – 4:41\n\"Big Man\" – 4:10\n\"The Waters of Lethe\" – 6:31\nCD single (Japan)\n\n\"I Wanna Change the Score\" – 4:29\n\"Hero for an Hour\" – 4:41\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\"I Wanna Change the Score\"\n\nNik Kershaw – vocals\nDaryl Stuermer – guitar\nTony Banks – keyboards\nJames Eller – bass\nGraham Broad – drums\nLuís Jardim – percussion\n\"Hero for an Hour\"\n\nTony Banks – vocals, keyboards, bass synth\nDaryl Stuermer – guitar\nMartin Robertson – saxophone\nVinnie Colaiuta – drums\nLuís Jardim – percussion\nProduction\n\nTony Banks – production (all tracks)\nNick Davis – production and engineering (\"I Wanna Change the Score\", \"Hero for an Hour\")\nMark Robinson – assistant engineering (\"I Wanna Change the Score\", \"Hero for an Hour\")\nSteve Hillage – production (\"Big Man\")\nSteve Chase – engineering (\"Big Man\")\nDavid Hentschel – production and engineering (\"The Waters of Lethe\")\nDavid Bascombe – engineering (\"The Waters of Lethe\")\nOther\n\nCarl Studna – photography\nWherefore Art – design\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Sushitsa (Bulgarian: Сушица) is a 24 km long river in southern Bulgaria, flowing through Smolyan and Plovdiv Provinces. It is a right tributary of the Yugovska reka, itself a right tributary of the Chepelarska reka of the Maritsa basin. \nThe river springs at an altitude of 1,425 m at the western foothills of the summit of Sini Vrah (1,536 m) in the Dobrostan Ridge of the western Rhodope Mountains. It flows in direction west–northwest in a narrow deep valley with numerous rocky escarpments and caves. The river flows into the Yugbska reka at an altitude of 556 m some 1.7 km southeast of the village of Yugovo. It drains the northwesternmost slopes of the Prespanski Ridge and the southwestern slopes of the Dobrostan Ridge.\nIts drainage basin covers a territory of 62 km2, or 18.7% of the Yugovska reka's total. The Sushitsa has predominantly rain–snow feed with high water in May and low water in August.\nThe river flows entirely in Plovdiv Province. There are two settlements along its course, the villages of Sini Vrah and Mostovo in Asenovgrad Municipality. Most of the river falls within the boundaries of the Chervenata Stena Reserve and fishing is forbidden. Raising over its high right banks north of Sini Vrah is located the plateau of Belintash, assumed to the an ancient Thracian cult site. \n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\nМичев (Michev), Николай (Nikolay); Михайлов (Mihaylov), Цветко (Tsvetko); Вапцаров (Vaptsarov), Иван (Ivan); Кираджиев (Kiradzhiev), Светлин (Svetlin) (1980).

        "content": "Società Sportiva Palestra Itália (Venetian: [soʧjᵊtᵃᵄɑ̆ː 'spoɾtiβɑ pall'eːs'tɾa ˈitaːλja]), known simply as Palestra or Palestra Itália, is a sports club based in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais. Although competing in a number of different sports, Palestra is mostly known for its association football team. It plays in the JK Stadium.\n\n\n== History ==\nPalestra's history is traced back to the Italian community living in Belo Horizonte, a city where already some Italian immigrants lived and their desire to set up a football club. Similar to the Italians of São Paulo (who founded Palestra Itália, now known as Palmeiras) the people of Belo Horizonte wanted the Italian colonies in Minas Gerais to have its own club as well.\nIn the sporting goods and footwear Augustine Ranieri's factory, located on the street of Caetés, it was decided the foundation of the club should tackle the three major capital: Atlético Mineiro, America-MG and Yale. Was born at that moment, the Società Sportiva Palestra Italia, established on 2 January 1921.\nThe meeting was attended by 95 founders present the shield and uniform that made reference to the Italian colors, and whose SSPI description would be recorded in the center shell. Another decision was that only members of the Italian colony could wear the shirt. Aurelio Noce was elected the first President.\nThe Palestra Italia emerged as the representative of the Italian colony. And is characterized as a team of Italian descent, Palestra also stood out by having elements of the Belo Horizonte working class, unlike Atlético and América, who had their consisting squad of college students coming from influential and wealthy families of the city.\n\nThe idea of the club being created took a big step when Yale, a sports team from the city, went through an administrative crisis. When some players left Yale over a dispute (Yale, which itself had connections to the Italian community), some went on to found the all Italian, Sociedade Esportiva Palestra Itália of Belo Horizonte. Until 1925 the club would only allow Italian men to participate, despite other teams in the nation accepting people of all skin colors and ethnicities.\nPalestra debuted in the Prado Mineiro Stadium with a 2–0 win in a friendly on 3 April 1921, against a combination from Nova Lima. The Nova Lima team united players from two teams from the city: Villa Nova, and Palmeiras, another team form Nova Lima. However, the first official match of Palestra was in a 3–0 win over future archrivals Clube Atlético Mineiro.\nIn January 1942, Brazil entered World War II and a decree of the federal government forbade the use of terms from enemy nations in entities, institutions, establishments, etc. With this, the Italian name was removed and the club could no longer call themselves Palestra Italia. The name was changed to Sociedade Esportiva Palestra Mineiro.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The New York Architectural Terra-Cotta Company was a manufacturer of architectural terracotta based in Queens, New York, U.S.\n\n\n== History ==\nBeginning in the 1870s, architectural terracotta grew in popularity in the United States after architects were drawn to its adaptability for various aesthetic styles and its inherent fireproof qualities. The initial companies to find success were the Chicago Terra Cotta Works and the Perth Amboy Terra Cotta Company, but New York real estate magnate Orlando B. Potter saw an opportunity for a company based closer to New York City to succeed and founded the New York Architectural Terra-Cotta Company with his son-in-law Walter Geer in 1886.\nThey recruited James Taylor, a ceramicist often described as \"the father of architectural terracotta\" in the United States, to act as superintendent of the new company's factory in Ravenswood, New York. Less than three months after the company began producing terracotta the entire factory was destroyed by fire. Taylor announced they would rebuild immediately and temporary sheds were built. A new factory, with an automatic sprinkler system, was built and operational in a few months and the company's rebirth was hailed by the community as \"Phoenix-like.\"\n\nIn 1892 the company constructed an office building, separate from its manufacturing facility, designed by architect Francis H. Kimball. As was often the case at the time the building was designed to showcase the various products the company was capable of producing, with a Renaissance and Tudor Revival design incorporating terracotta panels, chimney pots, and clay roof tiles.\nThe company was the fourth largest employer in Long Island City by 1915 and remained successful into the 1920s. A second manufacturing site was built in Old Bridge, New Jersey and the company went bankrupt in 1928–1929.\n\n\n=== After dissolution ===\nRichard Dalton, who had been president of the company from 1919 to 1928, formed the Eastern Terra Cotta Company in 1931 and used both of the New York Architectural Terra-Cotta Company's facilities. This new company remained in operation until the mid-1940s, after which the 1892 office was used by Dalton for his construction company. When he died in 1968 the Queens property was sold to Citibank, which demolished the remaining manufacturing works.\nDespite opposition from Citibank and Queens borough president Donald Manes, the 1892 building was designated a New York City Landmark in an unusually fast application process in 1982. Afterwards it drew increasing attention for its unique architecture and in 1999 it was purchased by Stuart Match Suna, president of Silvercup Studios. Historic preservationists were initially happy about this purchase due to Suna's wife being an architect on the Landmarks Commission, but Suna did not make efforts to maintain the structure until forced to by lawyers from the Landmarks Commission. In the 2020s the building underwent restorations to the interior and exterior of the structure.\n\n\n== Notable projects ==\nThe company produced architectural terracotta for many prominent buildings in and around New York City, including the Lincoln Building, the Corbin Building, the Schermerhorn Building, the Old Grolier Club, the Montauk Club, Carnegie Hall, and The Ansonia.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nArchitectural terracotta\nGlazed architectural terra-cotta\nAtlantic Terra Cotta Company\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Thecographa is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Graphidaceae. It has three species of corticolous (bark-dwelling) script lichens. The genus was circumscribed by Abramo Bartolommeo Massalongo in 1860. Although Massalongo did not assign a type species for the genus, David L. Hawksworth set Thecographa prosiliens as the type in 1981. Morphological characteristics of the genus include its sessile lirella (fruiting bodies), the lack of a thalline margin, and the complete carbonisation of the excipulum.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe genus Thecographa features apothecia (fruiting bodies) that are initially closed and embedded (hypophloedial), but later erupt to become open, elevated, and urn-shaped (urceolate). These apothecia often appear almost stalked, and are characteristically flexible, twisted, and angular. They are rarely and sparsely branched. The apothecia are equipped with a distinctive, carbonaceous excipulum that is cup-shaped. This structure is thin but consistent, enveloped by the thallus or tree bark on which the lichen lives. Over time, the covering epidermis may gradually disappear.\nThe disc of the apothecia is gelatinous, flattened, and tends to lose its colour, supported by a solid, almost papery base known as the hypothecium. The asci (spore-producing structures) are club-shaped and contain 2-4-8 spores, accompanied by paraphyses (sterile filaments interspersed among the asci).

The thallus of Thecographa is spread out and irregularly shaped, embedding itself into the substrate.\n\n\n== Species ==\nThecographa ceramia A.Massal.

        "content": "The Ambassador of Spain to Belgium is the Kingdom of Spain's foremost diplomatic representative in Belgium.\n\n\n== History ==\nFrom 1599 to 1603, Baltasar de Zúñiga was ambassador of Philip III of Spain to the court of Isabella Clara Eugenia and Albert VII, Archduke of Austria at the Palace of Coudenberg (today Brussels Park). Until the referendum on Spain's membership in NATO, the ambassador in Brussels represented the Spanish Government before the North Atlantic Council and President of the Spanish mission before the European Atomic Energy Community. On 28 October 1965, José Núñez Iglesias was replaced by Alberto Ullastres Calvo as President of the Spanish mission to the European Common Market.\nThe ambassador is appointed to the Council of Ministers, they direct the work of all the offices that depend on the Embassy, ​​based in Brussels. Likewise, it informs the Spanish Government about the evolution of events in Belgium, negotiates on behalf of Spain, can sign or ratify agreements, observes the development of bilateral relations in all fields and ensures the protection of Spanish interests and its citizens in Belgium.\nThe current ambassador is Alberto Antón Cortés, who was appointed by Pedro Sánchez's government on 27 September 2022.\n\n\n== List of ambassadors ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nForeign relations of Spain\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "NGC 3800 is an intermediate spiral galaxy located in the constellation Leo. Its speed relative to the cosmic microwave background is 3,653 ± 24 km/s, which corresponds to a Hubble distance of 53.9 ± 3.8 Mpc (∼176 million ly). NGC 3800 was discovered by German-British astronomer William Herschel in 1784.\nNGC 3799 and NGC 3800 are two gravitationally interacting galaxies and appear in Halton Arp's Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies under the symbol Arp 83. Halton Arp describes these as an example of galaxies by presenting a bridge of matter between them and having a high surface gloss.\nThe luminosity class of NGC 3800 is II and it has a broad HI line.\nTo date, four non-redshift measurements give a distance of 42.125 ± 1.162 Mpc (∼137 million ly), which is well outside the Hubble distance values. Note, however, that it is with the average value of independent measurements, when they exist, that the NASA/IPAC database calculates the diameter of a galaxy and that consequently the diameter of NGC 3800 could be approximately 32.8 kpc (∼107,000 ly) if we used the Hubble distance to calculate it.\n\n\n== NGC 3800 group ==\nThe galaxy NGC 3800 is part of a group of galaxies named after him. The NGC 3800 group has at least 16 members. Other New General Catalog galaxies in this group are NGC 3768, NGC 3790, NGC 3799, NGC 3801, NGC 3802, NGC 3806, NGC 3827 and NGC 3853. Other galaxies in the group are UGC 6631, UGC 6653, UGC 6666, UGC 6794, MCG 3-30-33 and MCG 3-30-38.\nAbraham Mahtessian also mentions the existence of this group, but only the galaxies NGC 3768, NGC 3790, NGC 3801 and NGC 3827 appear there. The galaxy NGC 3853 appears in Mahtessian's article, but under another entry where it forms a galaxy pair with UGC 6666, designated as 1139+1618 (CGCG 1139.7+1648). Similarly, the galaxies NGC 3799 and NGC 3800 are also listed under another entry in this article as a pair of galaxies.\nThe NASA/IPAC database indicates that NGC 3800 is possibly a field galaxy, that is, it does not belong to a cluster or group and is therefore gravitationally isolated. Scientists have concluded that this is most likely not the case.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of NGC objects (3001–4000)\nAtlas of Peculiar Galaxies\n\n\n== External links ==\nNGC 3800 at SIMBAD\n\n\n== References ==",

She was the longtime editor of the Estonian nature magazine Eesti Loodus.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nLinda Poots was born in 1929 in Tartu, Estonia.\nAfter high school, she attended the University of Tartu, where she began studying bats. She then studied zoology at Moscow State University, graduating in 1952.\nFrom 1948 onward, Poots made pioneering scientific observations of bats hibernating in Estonian caves. She went on to author many papers on bats in her country. At her urging, bat hibernation sites at Piusa and near Tallinn were protected by the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic in the 1980s.\nFrom 1952 to 1957, she taught in the Department of Zoology and Entomology at the Estonian Academy of Agriculture in Tartu, now the Estonian University of Life Sciences.\nShe was a co-founder and the longtime editor in chief of the nature magazine Eesti Loodus, from 1957 until her retirement in 1984. She wrote numerous articles on zoology and travel for this and other publications, and worked as an editor and translator of books on nature.\nIn 1966, Poots became a founding member of the Estonian Nature Conservation Society.\nAfter retiring from Eesti Loodus, Poots worked in the Tartu University Library from 1984 to 1999, helping classify zoological and medical literature.\nPoots married fellow scientist Viktor Masing in 1952. The couple's jointly written travelogue Tuhat tutvust tundrast kõrbeni was published in 1970. She also frequently collaborated with their son, biologist Matti Masing.\nShe died in 2015 at age 86.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Juan Carlos Beltrán Agoiz (born 17 December 1965) is a Spanish former footballer who played as a defender, and the manager of Utebo FC.\n\n\n== Career ==\nBorn in Mallén, Zaragoza, Aragon, Beltrán only played for clubs in his native region, representing CD Mallén, UD Fraga, AD Sabiñánigo and CJD Peralta, all of them in Tercera División (apart from two seasons in Segunda División B with Fraga). After retiring, he was named manager of SD Huesca in the fourth division in 2000, replacing Vicente Arilla, and led them to a promotion to the third level.\nIn 2001, Beltrán took over CF Figueruelas also in the fourth tier, but left in 2003 after their relegation. In March 2004, after being close to a return to Huesca in January (the club opted to appoint Ángel Chamarro instead), he was named at the helm of UD Barbastro.\nAfter a one-season spell at UE Tàrrega, Beltrán returned to Barbastro in 2005, but was sacked on 9 November of that year. He took over SD Ejea in 2007, leading the side to the top of their group in his first year but being dismissed in January 2009.\nIn 2009, Beltrán joined the structure of Real Zaragoza; initially a manager of the Juvenil B squad, he replaced Ander Garitano at the helm of the Juvenil A side when the latter was promoted to the reserves. He returned to the Juvenil B team ahead of the 2010–11 season, before departing the club on 13 May 2013.\nOn 21 June 2013, Beltrán was appointed CD Tudelano manager, but was relieved from his duties on 23 December. On 27 June 2015, after more than a year unemployed, he returned to Zaragoza after being named in charge of the Juvenil División de Honor squad.\nAfter leaving the Maños in June 2016, Beltrán spent nearly two years without a club before being named Utebo FC manager in June 2018. On 26 May of the following year, he was announced as SD Borja manager, but left the club at the end of the campaign.\nBeltrán returned to Utebo in 2021, and led the club to a first-ever promotion to Segunda Federación in his first year. On 9 March 2023, he renewed his contract with the club, and also reached two consecutive promotion play-offs in as many years.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJuan Carlos Beltrán at BDFutbol\nJuan Carlos Beltrán manager profile at BDFutbol\nJuan Carlos Beltrán at LaPreferente.com (in Spanish)\nJuan Carlos Beltrán coach profile at Soccerway",

He later joined a group of investors to purchase Rebel Speedway, renamed it to Autodrome Granby QC, and became a respected promotor and an authority in track surface preparation.\n\n\n== Racing career ==\nBob Gatien began his racing career in 1953 at age 17, racing his street car at Autodrome St. Guillaume. By 1955 he began focusing on running stock cars on the dirt ovals of Quebec, including\nAutodrome St-Grégoire,  Autodrome Saint Guillaume, Autodrome Sorel, Fury Speedway in Laval,  Kempton Park Raceway in La Praire, Mustang Speedway in Pike River, Sherbrooke Speedway, and Sainte Martine Speedway. Gatien claimed 9 track titles at Autodrome Drummond, and the 1969, 1970 and 1972 crowns at Rebel Speedway.\nGatien also ventured to the Brockville and Cornwall Speedways in Ontario and Devil's Bowl Speedway in West Haven VT. He occasionally traveled to the New York State venues, including Airborne Park Speedway in Plattsburgh,  Albany-Saratoga Speedway in Malta, Lebanon Valley Speedway, Orange County Fair Speedway, the Syracuse Mile and Weedsport Speedway.  He retired from driving in 1983 and returned to the sport two years later as part owner and promotor of Autodrome Granby.\nGatien was named Quebec's stock car athlete of the year in 1975, and was honored at the annual Gold Medal Gala in Montreal.  He was inducted in the Northeast Dirt Modified Hall of Fame in 2002.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Aegista tapeina is a species of air-breathing land snails, a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod in the family Camaenidae.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe diameter of the shell varies between 7.70 mm and 8.10 mm.\nThe shell is moderately large, exhibiting a robust, greenish hue. It is subdepressedly conoid and rather lenticular. It is widely umbilicate. The shell features faint oblique stripes with spiral markings that are not prominently defined. The spire is low and conoid. The shell comprises 6-7 whorls each somewhat flattened above. The body whorl is bluntly angulate at the periphery, rounded below, rounding out below and forming a subtle angle around the umbilicus before gently sloping downward. The aperture is slightly slanted and semicircular. The thin peristome is slightly turned outward. The columellar margin is simple and very slightly reflected.\nThe species displays variation in both the height of the spire and the angularity of the body whorl. Distinguishing itself from the aforementioned characteristics, it typically exhibits a narrower umbilicus, measuring less than 5 mm in width, while also boasting a slightly taller stature and a more pronounced angularity.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nThis species occurs in Myanmar, India, China and Java, Indonesia.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBenson, W.

        "content": "Josiah Maples (c. 1819 – September 22, 1876) was a 19th-century cotton plantation owner, bank director, and slave trader of Tennessee, Mississippi, and Arkansas in the United States (and the Confederate States during the American Civil War). Maples is notable as a slave-trading business partner of Nathan Bedford Forrest.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nJosiah Maples was born in Alabama in approximately 1818 or 1820. In July 1849 Maples was appointed to a \"committee of twenty\" in DeSoto County, Mississippi that produced a resolution that opposed the Wilmot Proviso, protested northern aggression, and \"Resolved, 5th. That while we cherish for the Union a lasting and warm regard, yet, we are not to be frightened from maintaining our just rights by being taunted with the name of disunionist feeling that whatever may be the result of this agitation it is chargeable not only on us who only stand on our rights under the constitution, but on those who have on this subject violated every guaranty of that sacred instrument.\" In 1851 Maples was the treasurer of the Masonic Lodge in DeSoto County. In 1852 the sheriff of Shelby County, Tennessee reported that his jail held a 23-year-old runaway slave named Philip, \"5 feet, 6 or 7 inches high, weighs about 140 pounds; belongs to Josiah Maples, of De Soto county, Miss.\" On or about October 1, 1853, Maples married Mary A. Marshall in Fayette County, Tennessee. On July 15, 1854, Maples patented 40 acres of land in Cherokee County, Alabama.\nMaples was one of three major business partners of slave trader Nathan Bedford Forrest, along with (serially, not simultaneously) Seaborne S. Jones and Byrd Hill. (Forrest's five brothers also worked in the business.) According to a history of DeSoto County, Mississippi produced by the WPA in the late 1930s, \"An interesting fact concerning Gen. Forrest, related by [Anna Maples of Olive Branch, Mississippi], was his having worked for Josiah Maples in his youth, on the old Evans place, a few miles from Pleasant Hill\". Maples and Forrest were in business together as Forrest & Maples from July 1854 to December 31, 1855.  In November 1854 they sold a nine-year-old girl named Page to Lavinia and Lemuel Smith for $600. On July 9, 1855, they sold Adisson, age 22, to V. Beckworth for $1,000. Also in 1855, Forrest & Maples sold Mary, age 15, for $800. On New Year's 1856 the Maples and Forrest partnership was dissolved. \nAt the time of the 1860 U.S. federal census, Maples, occupation \"planter,\" with personal property valued at $10,000, lived in Redfork Township, Desha County, Arkansas, in a household shared with an overseer, a housekeeper, and their respective families. The slave schedules show that 70 enslaved people worked on Maples' plantation. In March 1861, Maples was elected a director of the Bank of West Tennessee. During the American Civil War he sold some cotton that was later partially burned by Union troops; there was a lawsuit. The case Butler v. Maples \"established that buying cotton through an insurrectionary area through an agent licensed by the Treasury Department was legal\".\n\nMaples was enumerated as a resident of Desha County, Arkansas during the 1870 census, along with his wife, Mary A. Maples, and their three children, Lizzie, Marshall, and Clement. In 1875 he was described as \"one of the heaviest cotton planters of the Arkansas valley\". In 1876 Maples' primary residence was listed as Red Fork, Arkansas. Red Fork was described as \"a post office and landing on the Arkansas River, thirty miles above its mouth, and four miles from Watson, the county seat of Desha county\". Maples was considered a pioneer of Desha County,  and a leading, if not the leading, citizen of the area of fertile bottomland that was said to \"frequently [produce] two bales of cotton to the acre\".  \nMaples died in the Raleigh section of Memphis on September 22, 1876, after a long illness. Maples was buried in Rossville, Tennessee.\n\n\n== See also ==\nForrest's slave jail\nMemphis and Hernando Plank Road\nList of American slave traders\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===",

        "content": "Adolphe Garnier (27 March 1801 – 4 May 1864) was a French academic philosopher, the main disciple and continuator of Théodore Jouffroy.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHe studied at the Collège Bourbon, where he had Jouffroy as a teacher and won the first prize in philosophy in the concours général. He later became a lawyer while contributing to several literary and philosophical collections. \nIn 1827, he published a pamphlet on the death penalty that drew attention to him and brought him back to philosophy. After passing the agrégation in philosophy in 1827, he taught in Versailles, then in the Parisian colleges of Saint Louis (from 1833), Louis-le-Grand (from 1835 to 1838), and Henri-IV (1840–1841) as well as at the École normale supérieure (1834–1835).\nOn May 25, 1840, Garnier defended his two theses for the Doctorate of Letters at the University of Paris. The first, in French, is a critique of the philosophy of Thomas Reid. The second, in Latin, is a reflection on poetry.\nHe was appointed assistant professor of philosophy at the University of Paris Faculty of Letters in 1842, then succeeded Jouffroy in the chair of dogmatic philosophy in 1845 in this university. He was elected a member of the Académie des sciences morales et politiques in 1860.\nHis work on Social Morality was awarded a Montyon Prize in 1850. His Treatise on the Faculties of the Soul, considered his most important work, earned him his second Montyon Prize in 1853 and was hailed by the Revue des Deux Mondes as \"the best monument of psychological science of our time\". He also contributed to Le Globe.\nHe is buried in the Montmartre Cemetery.\n\n\n== Works ==\nDe la Peine de mort, 1827\nPrécis d'un cours de psychologie, 1831.

        "content": "The First Wall (also called The Old Wall) is one of three strong and fortified walls that were built for the defense of Jerusalem during the Second Temple Period. This wall was built during the Hasmonean period, but its foundations are older and were laid already in the First Temple period. During the time of the Return to Zion, the wall was rebuilt by Nehemiah, and in the days of the Hasmoneans, it was strengthened and even additional parts of it were built. The additional walls are the Second Wall - built during the days of the Hasmonean rulers John Hyrcanus or Alexander Jannaeus, and the Third Wall - construction began in the days of Agrippa I, and its construction was completed on the eve of the Great Revolt.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThroughout the entire Hellenistic period, the boundaries of the city hardly changed since the days of the Return to Zion. The Second Temple was located in the same place where it was initially in the days of the First Temple, and the city - the City of David - was to its south. In the 2nd century BCE, during the reign of the Hasmoneans, the city began to significantly expand towards the western hill, where the Hasmonean palace was built. The area was characterized by luxurious architectural style, and its inhabitants included the wealthy and respected. The new area, which with its expansion and establishment to the west, began to expand also to the north, was called \"the Upper City\" and around it a new wall was built, \"the First Wall,\" which actually enclosed the Lower City together with the Upper City. Both essentially constituted the main part of Jerusalem. Due to the city's location near the Kidron Valley to the east and the Valley of Hinnom to the south, which served as \"natural barriers\" for topographical reasons, the city was later expanded only towards the west and the north, while the eastern and southern boundaries remained unchanged.\n\n\n== The course of the wall ==\nWithin the first wall's boundaries included the City of David and Mount Zion, whereas most of the areas that are today within the boundaries of the Ottoman wall of Jerusalem were outside the first wall. The wall began in the area of the citadel (Tower of David) from there the wall descended along the southern ridge line of Mount Zion on a rocky cliff towards the Pool of Siloam, in the southern section of the wall the Essenes Gate was established which led to the desert. From there, the wall turned east and north on the eastern slope of the City of David, in a line parallel to the Kidron Valley. The wall passed through the Ophel area, and connected to the wall of the Temple Mount slightly north to the southwest corner, to allow entry to the Temple Mount from the east. The area of connection of the first wall to the Temple Mount wall is called \"the seam\" due to the meeting of two building styles. The northern part of the wall started from the Tower of David eastward to the Temple Mount parallel to the Tyropoeon Valley (David Street and Chain Street). In the northern wall were established several gates, among them \"the Hidden Gate\" and \"Garden Gate\". Above the remains of the first wall and more or less in the same course, about 400 years later, in the Byzantine period, a new wall was built by Empress Eudocia. The fact that two walls were built 400 years apart in the same course without their builders knowing about each other, proves that the topographic location of the first wall is the most correct for defending the city.\n\n\n== Additional fortifications along the wall ==\nIn the fortress area where the first wall begins, Herod strengthened the wall, Phasael Tower, and Tower of David, and built the Hippicus Tower ('Tower of David'). The section south of the fortress, where the wall was built on rock to protect the western part of the Upper City, was also fortified, and nearby, the palace was built. The wall served as a supporting wall of the structure, and an adjacent front wall was added with a thickness of up to 3.5 meters. This wall later served as the foundation for the Ottoman wall (remnants that exist to our days).\n\n\n== Remnants of the first wall existing today ==\nToday, there are clear remnants of the First Wall in these places:\n\nIn the area of the citadel, which is called today \"Tower of David\"\nIn the Mamilla area, west of the current wall, there are remnants of Hasmonean fortifications.\nIn the Jewish Quarter, close to the Israelite Tower and remnants of a gate which is probably \"Gennath Gate\".\nAt the base of the eastern wall of the Temple Mount.\nOn the southern slopes of Mount Zion.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Henry Rees (15 February 1798 – 18 February 1869) was a Welsh Calvinistic Methodist leader.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nRees was the eldest son of David Rees of Chwibren Isaf in the parish of Llansannan, Denbighshire, and Anne (Williams) of Cefn Fforest. He was born on 15 February 1798. William Rees (1802–1883) was his brother. His father, who moved in a short time to Rhyd Loew, and thence to Cae Du in the same district, was a lay officer of the Calvinistic Methodist connection, and Henry showed at an early age a deep interest in religious work. In May 1816 he left home to take employment on a farm near Bettws Abergele, and while in this district, in the spring of 1819, began to preach. Resolving to devote himself to the Calvinistic Methodist ministry, he came home to Cae Du in May, and then placed himself for two years under the tuition of Thomas Lloyd of Abergele. It was not the practice of the ministers of his connection at this time to depend wholly on the ministry for support, and accordingly, in 1821, he went to Shrewsbury to learn bookbinding. In the following year he was persuaded by his friends in that town to accept instead the charge of the Calvinistic Methodist church there in return for his maintenance. He was ordained to the full work of the ministry at Bala on 13 June 1827, and on 20 October 1830 married Mary Roberts of Shrewsbury (d. 1879). During his stay in Shrewsbury Rees rapidly won a position as one of the foremost preachers of his connection, and from this time until his death was almost always to be heard at the great preaching meetings of the North Wales Association. At the end of 1836 he accepted the superintendence of the Calvinistic Methodist churches in Liverpool, where he spent the rest of his life. He died on 18 February 1869 at Benarth, near Conway, his son-in-law's house, and was buried in Llan Dysilio churchyard, near Menai Bridge. He left one daughter, Anne, the wife of Mr. Richard Davies of Treborth, lord lieutenant of Anglesey.\nRees devoted himself to the two duties of preaching and connectional administration. After the death of John Elias in 1841 he was for a quarter of a century the recognised leader of the Calvinistic Methodists of North Wales, and had the largest share in forming the policy of the northern association. As a preacher he had scarcely a rival in the denomination, his sermons being marked by careful preparation, closeness of texture, and purity of diction, coupled with great earnestness and force. He distrusted rhetorical effect. A selection of his sermons was published at Holywell, in three volumes (1872, 1875, 1881).\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Lloyd, John Edward (1896). \"Rees, Henry\".

        "content": "Anna Arganashvili or Ana Arganashvili is a Georgian human rights lawyer. She was a Fulbright scholar and an MD Anderson Fellow. She successfully challenged her country's COVID-19 quarantine laws and she helped the European Court of Human Rights to request that the government should reconsider its support for children with disabilities. In 2024 the President of Georgia, Salome Zourabichvili, gave Arganashvili the Georgian Order of Honour.\n\n\n== Life ==\nIn 2007 she began work at the office of the public defender of Georgia. She became the head of their gender equality department and she left in 2013 and joined the NGO \"Partnership for Human Rights\" and she became its CEO. The organisation champions the rights of under-represented groups including children and people with disabilities.\nShe studied at the University of Texas, United States as part of a Fulbright scholarship from 2019 for a year. In 2020 she returned from studying in America during the COVID-19 pandemic when travel and quarantine laws were in place. She returned to Georgia with her husband and their eleven year old daughter on 27 June. The family were placed in two weeks of quarantine in a hotel in Akhaltsikhe. She complained via Facebook about the conditions. She mentioned the food and particularly the restricted room for her daughter. She received a reply from Natia Mezvrishvili who explained that the state could not afford five star accommodation, but the family were moved to a hotel in the capital. However issues of diet and exercise still caused problems and after her complaints gained support on-line she decided to take the case to the court of appeal. The court upheld her complaint on behalf of the child and the family were allowed to go home and self-isolate. This was the first successful appeal against the quarantine conditions and Irakli Chikovani, a spokesperson for the Prime Minister, said that similar cases involving children should be dealt with on a case by case basis.\nIn 2021 she was involved when the European Court of Human Rights made an interim order restraining the Georgian government. The government had passed a law that attempted to put limits on the kind of help that the state might give people with disabilities. In the case cited a mother was left to fend for herself with a violent child because the state had assessed that help was needed but it would require two people and that was outside the care offered. Arganashvili and her organisation said that all children should get \"a chance of social inclusion, access to education and a life free of violence\". The government agreed to think again.\nOn 8 March (International Women's Day) in 2024 the President of Georgia, Salome Zourabichvili, gave the Georgian Order of Honour to Anna and four other women. The four others were Babutsa Pataraia, Tamuna Museridze, Eliso Amirejibi and Nato Shavlakadze. They were all associated with human rights and the President gave them the award at the Orbeliani Palace.\n\n\n== Publications include ==\nShe published an article in 2016 titled, \"Empowering Women Against Discrimination in Labour Relations in Georgia\" in Anti-Gender Movements on the Rise?\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "John Hughes (11 February 1796 – 8 August 1860) was a Welsh Calvinistic Methodist minister.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHughes was born at Adwy'r Clawdd, near Wrexham, on 11 February 1796. His parents were Hugh and Mary Hughes. His father was a carpenter, and he himself followed the same occupation till he was nineteen. When a lad of twelve he joined the Sunday-school which was then introduced into the neighbourhood, and made great progress. In 1810 he joined the Calvinistic Methodist church at Adwy, and three years later began preaching. On 13 September 1815 he opened a school at Cross Street, near Hope, Flintshire, but in August 1817 he went to school himself to learn Latin and Greek. After a time he opened a new school at Wrexham, and prepared many young men for the pulpit. He preached every Sunday. In February 1821 he was authorised as regular preacher to visit all parts of Wales, and in 1822 he preached before the Methodist Association. On 17 June 1829 he was ordained at Bala. In 1835, owing to bad health, he gave up his school, and became a flour merchant, in partnership with a brother. In 1838 he went to Liverpool, attained considerable eminence there as a preacher, and became co-pastor with Henry Rees of the Welsh Calvinistic churches of Liverpool. He died on a visit to Abergele 8 August 1860. He was twice married.\nHughes's chief work is his 'History of Welsh Calvinistic Methodism,' in three large volumes (Wrexham, vol. i. 1851, vol. ii. 1854, vol. iii. 1856). A volume containing twenty-two sermons, together with a memoir by the Rev. R. Edwards and the Rev. John Hughes of Everton, and a portrait, appeared in 1862. Other works (all in Welsh, and nearly all published at Wrexham without date) are:\n'Companion to Scripture.'\n'Mirror of Prophecy' (reviewed in 'Drysorfa,' March 1849).\n'The Scripture Test.'\n'Catechism of Scripture History' (reviewed in 'Drysorfa,' January 1850).\n'Protestantism in Germany,' London, 1847.\n'An Essay on the Sabbath,' 1859.\nHe also translated several works for the Religious Tract Society.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Jones, Rees M.

        "content": "HD 32356, also designated as HR 1624, is an astrometric binary located in the northern circumpolar constellation Camelopardalis, the giraffe, near β Camelopardalis. The visible component is faintly visible to the naked eye as an orange-hued star with an apparent magnitude of 5.99. Gaia DR3 parallax measurements imply a distance of 557 light-years and it is currently drifting closer with a heliocentric radial velocity of −45.2 km/s. At its current distance, HD 32356's brightness is diminished by an interstellar extinction of 0.29 magnitudes and it has an absolute magnitude of +0.23.\nThe visible component has a stellar classification of K5 II, indicating that it is an evovled K-type bright giant that has ceased hydrogen fusion at its core and left the main sequence. It has 1.18 times the mass of the Sun but at the age of 4.27 billion years, it has expanded to 30.67 times the radius of the Sun. It radiates 300 times the luminosity of the Sun from its enlarged photosphere at an effective temperature of 4,111 K. HD 32356 A is metal deficient with an iron abundance roughly half of the Sun’s and it spins too slowly for its projected rotational velocity to be measured accurately.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "14 de Julho is a partially collapsed hydroelectric dam, formerly with around 100 MW of power, that is located in the Das Antas River between the municipalities of Cotiporã and Bento Gonçalves in Brazil. The dam had an estimated capacity of 55.18 million cubic meters before its collapse. Its construction project started in 2004 and subsequently entered into commercial operation in 2008.\n\n\n== Collapse ==\nOn May 2, 2024, the dam partially collapsed during heavy rains. After the collapse, the region has since been declared a state of emergency by Rio Grande do Sul state governor Eduardo Leite, and the Civil Defense issued a statement warning residents in regions around the Taquari River to leave their homes. The collapse of the dam created a two-meter (6.6-foot; 79-inch) wave that exacerbated the 2024 flooding of Rio Grande do Sul.\nThe Brazilian company Companhia Energética Rio das Antas (CERAN) later issued a statement stating that the dam collapse did not significantly alter the flow dynamics in the Taquari–Antas basin.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Weilburg palace (German: Schloss Weilburg) is a former neoclassical palace in Baden near Vienna, Austria. Constructed in 1820, it was a present from archduke Charles, duke of Teschen (1771–1847) to his beloved wife, princess Henrietta of Nassau-Weilburg (1797–1829). The neoclassical design was by the architect Joseph Kornhäusel (1782–1860). It became the seat of the Teschen branch of the Habsburg family. A fire broke out in April 1945, probably lit by retreating soldiers of the Wehrmacht and as the Red Army prohibited the fire to be extinguished, the palace was destroyed. Due to misunderstanding and ignorance, the ruins were blown up in the 1960s.\nToday, nothing is left from this beautiful palace except the coat of arms, which once decorated the palace. The palace was once considered the most significant example of Biedermeier style in Austria.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Archduke Charles of Teschen and princess Henrietta of Nassau-Weilburg: a palace as a gift of love ===\nArchduke Charles was the third son of Emperor Leopold II and his wife, Maria Luisa of Spain. He was also the younger brother of Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor. However, he had been adopted and raised by his childless aunt Marie Christine of Austria and her husband Albert of Saxe-Teschen. He was the heir to the Duchy of Teschen and would succeed in 1822.\nThe archduke was epileptic, but achieved respect both as a commander and as a reformer of the Austrian army. He was considered one of Napoleon's more formidable opponents and one of the greatest generals of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. He was the victor of the Battle of Aspern-Essling against Napoleon.\nOn 15 September/17 September 1815 in Weilburg, archduke Charles married princess Henrietta of Nassau-Weilburg. The bride was almost eighteen years old and the groom forty-four. But the marriage proved to be a happy one. Henriette has been known as the person who popularized the Christmas tree in Vienna after it was already introduced by Fanny von Arnstein in 1814 during the Vienna Congress.\nShortly, after the marriage he decided to construct a summer residence as a present for his wife. The location for the palace was in Baden near Vienna, a spa town favoured by the Viennese elite and members of the imperial family, who constructed extensive villas nearby. The chosen plot was at the entrance of the Helenental valley, at the foot of a hill dominated by the ruins of Rauheneck castle and opposite the ruins of Rauhenstein castle. The land was owned by the Doblhoff family, who sold it to the archduke.\nThe architect Joseph Kornhäusel made the neoclassical design, who also rebuilt large parts of Baden in a Biedermeier style after a fire destroyed large parts of the town in 1812. The laying of the foundation stone took place on 13 September 1820, after which construction started. On 24 December 1821, archduke Charles presented the palace to his wife Henriette. The palace could be moved into on 4 June 1823. The building was named after Henriette's hometown Weilburg.\nWith a front length of 201 meters, the Weilburg palace was one of the most significant neoclassical buildings in Austria. Moritz Gottlieb Saphir (1795–1858), a contemporary, called it \"a stone poem, an epic built by a hero,\" alluding to the builder's military glory.\nOn the north side of the house, a coat of arms designed in stone by Josef Klieber (1773–1850) was placed on the attic of the seven-axial portico, combining the lion of the House of Nassau with the heraldic animals of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, the eagle and the lion.\nOn the night of 29 to 30 December 1829, Henriette of Nassau-Weilburg died in Vienna. In her will, she bequeathed the Weilburg palace to her eldest son Albrecht, who was still a minor. The management of the property was entrusted to his father, Archduke Karl, who passed away on 30 April 1847.\n\n\n=== Archduke Albrecht of Teschen ===\n\nArchduke Albrecht (1817–1895) spent almost every summer in Baden and expanded the Weilburg estate by purchasing the forest area on Rauheneck Mountain from the Doblhoff lordship. His wife, princess Hildegard of Bavaria (1825–1864), had a lookout pavilion built there, named \"Hildegardruhe.\"\nIn July 1840, the street leading to the palace was described as being illuminated to such an extent during summer nights that \"the area resembles the Vienna glacis\", the old walls around the city.\nSchloss Weilburg's beautiful location often made it a subject for painters such as Jakob Alt, Thomas Ender, Balthasar Wigand, or Eduard Gurk.\nIn 1856, archduke Albrecht built a Neo-gothic chapel near the western wing of the palace. It was designed by the architect Anton Heft. The chapel was consecrated on 31 July 1858.\nArchduke Albrecht was honoured as a respected military leader with an equestrian monument in front of his Vienna palace, the Albertina. He passed away on 18 February 1895, leaving no male descendants. In his will, he appointed his nephew archduke Frederick (1856–1936), the eldest son of his brother Karl Ferdinand (1818–1874), as his heir.\n\n\n=== Archduke Frederick of Teschen ===\n\nDue to the inheritance of his uncle, archduke Frederick belonged to the wealthiest men in Austria-Hungary. Next to the Weilburg palace and the Albertina with its large art collections, he owned estates in Ungarisch-Altenburg (now Mosonmagyaróvár in Hungary), Belleje, Saybusch (now Żywiec in Poland), Seelowitz (now Židlochovice) and Frýdek in the Czech Republic, and the Grassalkovich Palace in Pressburg (now Bratislava in Slovakia). He was married to princess Isabella of Croÿ (1856–1931). Together, they had nine children.\nLike most Habsburg princes, archduke Frederick adopted a military career, and served creditably for many years. At the start of the First World War, he was appointed by Emperor Franz Joseph I (1830–1916) as the supreme commander of the Austro-Hungarian Army. The archduke thought it his duty to accept this heavy responsibility, but, modestly underestimating his own powers, left the actual exercise of the command to his chief of staff, Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf. In the performance of ceremonial duties, and as mediator for the settlement of the conflicting demands of the military, civil and allied elements, his services were undeniable. He was promoted to the rank of Generalfeldmarschall on 8 December 1914. In February 1917, emperor Charles I (1887–1922) himself took over the supreme command. The archduke, although the Emperor's representative, no longer appeared in the foreground, and devoted himself to the management of his estates.\nAfter World War I, Austria declared itself a republic on 12 November 1918. On 10 April 1919, the Habsburg Law came into force, which dethroned the House of Habsburg-Lorraine as rulers of Austria. The Habsburg family members had to declare themselves loyal citizens of the republic, or leave the country, otherwise their property would be confiscated. Archduke Frederick was not willing to do this. On 14 April 1919, he and his family left the Weilburg palace to move to Swizterland initially. Most of his properties in Austria and all in Czechoslovakia were confiscated, including the palaces in Bratislava and Vienna, including his art collection. However, he retained his properties in Hungary, where Miklós Horthy restored the monarchy without having a king. Also, the Weilburg palace remained his property.\nIn the end, archduke Frederick moved to Ungarisch-Altenburg (now Mosonmagyaróvár). A significant portion of the Weilburg's inventory was brought there. He was not allowed to re-enter the Republic of Austria since he did not make the declaration required by the Habsburg Law. The Weilburg palace remained empty in the following years.\nIn 1928, the social-democratic Vienna city administration expressed interest in acquiring the Weilburg as a \"home for accommodating sick children,\" but this plan was rejected by archduke Frederick, still the owner. In 1930, the rooms were used for the exhibition \"450 Years of the City of Baden\", and the city council negotiated the purchase of land to expand the beach. In 1934, the idea emerged to establish the planned Baden casino in the Weilburg. The idea was abandoned because the palace was too far outside the city.\n\n\n=== Archduke Albrecht Franz of Teschen ===\nArchduke Frederick passed away on 30 December 1936. He appointed his son archduke Albrecht Franz (1897–1955) as his heir, who received his estates in Hungary and the Weilburg palace. During the Second World War, archduke Albrecht lived in Budapest. When the Red Army advanced, he fled to Argentina, where he died in Buenos Aires on 23 July 1955.\n\n\n=== Second World War ===\nOn 31 January 1940, the Weilburg palace was placed under monument protection. On 1 April 1940, the Brandenburg Training Regiment was quartered there, followed by a mountain infantry unit. On 12 December 1944, the Wehrmacht evacuated the Weilburg palace, and on 2 April 1945, a fire broke out, destroying large parts of the palace and all of its furnishing. The fire was probably lit by retreating Wehrmacht soldiers. The advancing Red Army forbade the firefighters from extinguishing it. Rumors suggested that valuable war equipment and important documents were stored in the building, which could have been the cause of arson.\n\n\n=== Post war period ===\n\nRed army soldiers used the palace stables as barracks for several years. The chapel in the castle park, undamaged by the fire, served as a hay storehouse for them. The palace ruins, with still-standing walls, deteriorated rapidly.\nThe settlement of Albrecht's estate after his death was difficult. It ended in 1967 with the transfer of the (remains of the) Weilburg palace and other properties (e.g., the Halbturn palace in Burgenland), to his nephew, Paul Freiherr von Waldbott-Bassenheim (1924–2008), the son of his sister Maria Alice of Habsburg-Teschen (1893–1962).\nThe new owner's lawyers applied to have the monument protection of the palace lifted by the monument office in order to sell the property more favourably. After a lengthy process, their endeavours succeeded: in the first and second instances, the Federal Monuments Office and the Ministry of Education, decided to maintain monument protection at least for a part of the building, but the Administrative Court as the third and final instance lifted it, with the peculiar reasoning that the protected building had perished and the remaining ruins were not to be considered identical with it. Due to misunderstanding and ignorance, the remains of this beautiful palace were no longer protected.\n\n\n=== Modern times ===\n\nThe Baden municipality bought the Rauhenecker forest behind the palace, as well as the park. The location of the palace changed several times until it was used for the construction of a residential area starting in 1964.\nOn 19 August 1964, the remains of the palace ruins were blown up. Today, nothing remembers any more of the beautiful neoclassical palace, once presented by a loving archduke to his wife. Only, the coat of arms, which once decorated the palace, is left in the former palace park. It is popularly known as the “Gravestone of the Weilburg palace”.\n\n\n==== Gallery: Floor plans of Weilburg palace by Joseph Kornhäusel ====\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Literature ==\nde Martin, Waltraud (1987).

        "content": "John Hughes (1787 – 1 November 1860) was a Welsh clergyman.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHughes was the son and heir of John Hughes, esq., of Llwyn Glas, Llanfihangel Geneu'r Glyn, near Aberystwyth. He was born in 1787. After attending the grammar school of Ystradmeurig, he became classical master at a large school at Putney, London, where he remained about eighteen months. As a lad he aspired to become a preacher. Returning to Wales he was ordained by the Bishop of St. Asaph in 1811. He was curate first for six years at Llandrillo yn Rhôs, near Conway, and afterwards at Foleshill, near Coventry. At Foleshill he became very popular; but when the vicar died, in 1822, Lord-chancellor Eldon refused the petition of the parishioners to bestow the living on him. Hughes therefore left, and settled at Tiddington, near Oxford. Here again his fame as a preacher soon filled the church, and students from Oxford were often among his hearers. He became in 1837 vicar of Aberystwyth and curate of Llanbadarn Fawr. In 1834 the living of the mother church of Llanbadarn was conferred on him, with a prebendal stall in the collegiate church of Brecon, and in 1859 Bishop Thirlwall gave him the archdeaconry of Cardigan. In the course of that year he visited eighty parishes, preaching in each. He died on 1 November 1860, aged 73. He was for many years the most popular preacher of the established church in Wales.\nHe published in Welsh, besides sermons, translations of Henry and Scott's 'Commentary,' as far as Deuteronomy, 1834, of Hall's 'Meditations,' and 'Y Nabl' (i.e. the Psaltery), a collection of Welsh psalms and hymns.\nHis English publications include, besides sermons:\n'The Domestic Ruler's Monitor,' 1821.\n'Pastoral Visitation,' 1822.\n'Esther and her People,'1832.\n'Ruth and her Kindred,' 1839.\n'The Self-Searcher.'\n'Psalms and Hymns for the use of the Church at Aberystwyth.'\n'The Heathen's Appeal.\nA volume of sermons, with biography by his son, the Rev. R. Hughes, appeared at Liverpool in 1864.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Jones, Rees M.

        "content": "Banphaeo General Hospital (Thai: โรงพยาบาลบ้านแพ้ว), is a hospital located in Ban Phaeo district, Samut Sakhon province, Thailand. It is operated by the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) as a public organisation and is the only hospital in Thailand be run in this manner. It is also an affiliated teaching hospital of the Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University.\n\n\n== History ==\nInitially, Banphaeo Hospital opened as a community hospital in 1965 operated by the MOPH with a capacity of 10 beds and was eventually expanded to 30 beds. The idea of creating public organisations to improve the efficiency of the relatively backward governmental department management system emerged after the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997. After the enactment of the 8th National Social and Economic Development Plan devised by prime minister Chavalit Yongchayudh's cabinet, the MOPH reached out to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help revolutionize the operations of hospitals in the country and it was suggested that hospitals should be converted into public organisations to allow greater freedom of management as opposed to the traditional top-down approach.\nIn 1998, a research project partly funded by the ADB encouraged a shift of hospital operations towards public organisations, coining the term \"autonomous hospitals\" to avoid being considered as corporations. During this time, the Public Organisations Act of 1999 allowed the establishment of public organisations by the government to fulfill this aim. Seven hospitals were listed by the MOPH to be potential candidates for this shift:\n\nHatyai Hospital\nKhon Kaen Hospital\nSaraburi Hospital\nYala Hospital\nNakornping Hospital\nSatun Hospital\nBanphaeo Hospital\nOut of the seven hospitals, Banphaeo was considered the most prepared in terms of local community support and willingness to change. \nBanphaeo General Hospital became a public organisation on 1 October 2000 and remains the only hospital in Thailand under the MOPH to be operated in this way. It has since expanded to a capacity of 323 beds and also operates a number of smaller clinics in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHealthcare in Thailand\nHospitals in Thailand\nList of hospitals in Thailand\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Harry de Cleyre (1890–1974) was and American house painter and writer. The son of Voltairine de Cleyre and James B. Elliott, he was abandoned by his mother and neglected by his father during his childhood. He struggled to apply himself in his education and was forced to start work at the age of 10. After his mother's death, he devoted himself to studying her work and preserving her memory; he became a key primary source on her life, writing several letters about her to Joseph Ishill and Agnes Inglis.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHarry de Cleyre was born on June 12, 1890, in Philadelphia, the son of the anarchist Voltairine de Cleyre and the freethinker James B. Elliott. He was born by the name Vermorel Elliott, named after the Communard Auguste-Jean-Marie Vermorel. His mother was neither physically nor emotionally able to cope with raising Harry, so she left him in the care of his father. Feeling abandoned, Harry would refer to himself as a \"bastard\" throughout the rest of his life.\nDe Cleyre's mother remained a stranger to him during his early life, even though she lived close by. According to Harry's own daughters, \"he just did not fit into her life, her plans, at all.\" She briefly attempted to give him piano lessons, but he didn't apply himself, so she stopped. By the turn of the century, his father had succombed to mental illness and left him to fend for himself. He went to work at the age of 10, his income supplemented only by a small weekly allowance from his mother. His aunt Adelaide D. Thayer remembered him always feeling depressed, which she attributed to his mother. At one point, Thayer asked if she could take care of him; while his mother cared little for what was done with him, his father refused to relinquish custody. At the age of 16, he enrolled in a technical school, as he had grown up loving machines and wanted to learn mechanical engineering. Although he was financially supported by his mother, he failed to apply himself to his studies, so his mother refused to pay for any more of his education. He later went to work as a housepainter.\nHe became closer with his mother once he reached the age of 15. By 1906, he was living with his mother and for some time paid her rent. She later recalled his passion for repairs and machinery, and assured her sister that rumors he had become a priest were untrue, saying: \"he is an ignorant boy and an alcoholic wreck; they wouldn't take him in for a minute.\" According to Emma Goldman, while he was \"overawed\" by his mother's intellect, he was also \"repelled by her austere mode of living.\"\nIn the spring of 1912, when his mother was on her deathbed, he travelled to Chicago to be by her side when she died. After his mother's death, Emma Goldman speculated that Harry had gone his own way, becoming \"one of the 100% Americans, commonplace and dull.\" Although neglected by his mother throughout his life, he never stopped loving her, even naming his eldest daughter \"Voltairine\". He also dropped his father's surname and adopted his mother's. While the rest of his maternal family continued to spell their name \"De Claire\", Harry adopted his mother's fashion of spelling it as \"de Cleyre\". Although he never took up his mother's anarchist philosophy, he expressed pride in her \"stubborn defense of those being oppressed.\" He also inherited his parents' love of Thomas Paine, which he passed on to his own daughters, and treated his mother's Selected Works as his own personal Bible.\nLater in his life, he spent much of his time talking about his mother. In a letter he sent to Joseph Ishill on October 15, 1934, he pointed out a number of mistakes in Emma Goldman's biography of De Cleyre, including the date and circumstances of her death, the false assertion that her father Hector De Claire had wanted her to become a nun, and the details of her lingustics tutoring. Nevertheless, he still described Goldman's biography as a \"glowing tribute\". In the same letter, he also described his mother's student Nathan Navro as \"a man whose integrity is unquestioned\", praising him for being \"free of petty jealousies\", unlike some of his mother's other admirers. In an October 28, 1934 letter to Joseph Ishill, de Cleyre described his mother's time in a convent, where according to him, she was allowed access to the Bible, which \"was denied to those of the Catholic faith.\" In an October 12, 1947 letter to Agnes Inglis, de Cleyre described his grandfather as a \"petty tyrant\". He also mentioned about how, during her time in a convent, his mother had considered becoming a nun. On December 29, 1947, he told Inglis that his mother had confided to him that it was Dyer Lum who had smuggled an explosive to Louis Lingg, which had allowed him to committ suicide. Inglis herself didn't believe this, thinking the prison authorities had killed Lingg, but this hypothesis was disputed by Alexander Berkman. On February 15, 1948, he confessed to Inglis of how his mother had been acquitted in a trial for incitement to riot, after her co-defendant Chaim Weinberg had bribed a witness to not testify.\nHarry de Cleyre died in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, in April 1974.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==",

Carried by the daring lead performance from Roberta Colindrez, Ms. White Light is an early favorite as one of the best films of 2019.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMs. White Light at IMDb",

        "content": "John Somer, also known as John Semur or John Somerarius,  (fl. 1380) was an English Franciscan friar and astronomer.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nSomer belonged to the Franciscan house at Bridgewater, and was probably at Oxford in 1380. At the instance of Thomas Kingsbury, provincial minister of the order, he wrote a calendar with astronomical tables—‘Tertium Opusculum Kalendarii’—for Joan, princess of Wales, mother of Richard II; it is dated 1380. Of this there are many copies—the illuminated MS. Bibl. Reg. 2 B. viii. was perhaps the presentation copy. In it the cycles run from 1387 to 1462, but in the Cotton MS. Vesp. E. vii., which contains also some planispheres, the cycle is 1405 to 1481. Another copy, among the queen of Sweden's manuscripts at the Vatican, is dated 1384, and with it is a versification of the bible (Montfaucon, Bibl. Nova MSS. i. 46, No. 1423). Among the manuscripts of Alexandre Petau (Petavius) in the Vatican, the ‘Calendar’ is dated 1372, and the versification of the bible is ascribed, with the ‘Calendar,’ to John Semur (ib. i. 66). According to Bale, he wrote also a ‘Castigation of former Calendars collected from many sources’ (Scriptt. Brit. VII. viii.).\nIn the Cotton MS. Domit. A. II. is a ‘Chronica quædam brevis … de conventu Ville Briggewater’ ascribed to him. It contains only a slender chronology of early historical events, written in many hands into a calendar.\nJohn Somer's ‘Calendars’ were used by Geoffrey Chaucer, who, in his ‘Treatise on the Astrolabe,’ declares his intention of making a third part that shall contain divers tables of longitudes and latitudes, and declinations of the sun after the calendars of the reverend clerks, John Somer and Nicholas of Lynne. The third part, however, is wanting (cf. Chaucer, Works, ed. Skeat, iii. 353).\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Bateson, Mary (1898). \"Somer, John\". In Lee, Sidney (ed.).

        "content": "The Kingdom of Malwa was a monarchy in central India that was established by Jayavarman of the House of Aulikara in 350 AD. It was ruled by multiple royal houses discontinuously until it was finally conquered in 1562 by Akbar the Great, the Shahenshah of Hindustan, and annexed as the Malwa Province. \nThe Kingdom of Avanti of ancient India had been based in the region where the Kingdom of Malwa later came up. The Kingdom of Avanti was conquered by Indo-Scythia in 61 BC. Following this, the region was ruled by the Malava republic. During the period, the region's name gradually changed to Malava or Malwa. In 350 AD, Jayavarman established the Kingdom of Malwa in region and founded the House of Aulikara. Yashodharman, the King of Malwa between 515 and 545 AD significantly expanded the kingdom and conquered the territories of Huns. Following his death, Krishnaraja became the King of Malwa and founded the House of Kalachuri in 550 AD.\nThe Kingdom of Malwa was conquered and ruled by Harsha, the Emperor of Kannauj between 625 and 647 AD after which regained it's independence until being conquered by the Gurjara Empire in 755 AD. Hereafter it formed a part of the Gurjara Empire until it regained its independence in 948 under the House of Paramara until it was conquered by the Delhi Sultanate in 1305. In 1402, the governor of Malwa declared his independence and established the Sultanate of Malwa under the House of Khalji which reigned till its conquest by Akbar, the Shahenshah of Hindustan in 1562.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== House of Aulikara (350–530) ===\nThe region where the Kingdom of Malwa was established had earlier been part of the Malava republic. The Malavas had been a tribe from northwestern India who conquered and established their rule over the Malwa region sometime after the fall of the Kingdom of Avanti (61 BC). They formed an oligarchic republic and maintained their rule over Malwa until 350 AD. Jayavarman, a Malava chief, deposed the republican government and established the Kingdom of Malwa and the House of Aulikara. Taking advantage of the confusion created during the reign of Rudrasena III, the Saka Satrap of Gujarat for thirteen years, from 351 to 364 AD, Jayavarman seized the territory near Mandsor from the Sakas. In 423 AD, Viswavarman accepted the suzerainty of Kumaragupta I, the Emperor of Magadha. In 467 AD, following the succession crisis after the death of Emperor Skandagupta of Magadha, Prabhakara became an independent monarch.\nFurther north, the First Hunnic War began in 496 between the Hunnic Empire and the Magadha Empire and the Huns conquered parts of Central and Northwest India by 510. However, in 515 during the reign of Yashodharman, the Kingdom of Malwa joined the War in aid of Magadha and managed to defeat the Huns. The Hunnic King Toramana died from war injuries after a battle with the Magadhan Emperor Narasimhagupta.\nIn 520, the Second Hunnic War began after the son of Tomara, Mihirakula, King of the Huns invaded the Magadhan Empire once more and occupied and sacked Patliputra, the Magadhan capital. Following this, Malwa formed an alliance with the Kingdom of Thanesar and in 528, defeated the Hunnic Empire.\n\n\n=== House of Kalachuri (530–625) ===\nIn 530 AD, Yashodharman died without any heirs. Seeing this Krishnaraja seized power and became the King of Malwa and established the House of Kalachuri. His son, Shankaragana (r. 575–600) conquered parts of the Magadhan Empire. Shankaragana' son, Buddharaja (r. 600–625) was defeated by Chalukyas and lost southern territories and was ultimately defeated and conquered by the Kannauj Empire under Harsha.\n\n\n=== Kannauj Interregnum to Rashtrakuta feudatory ===\nHarsha of the Kannauj Empire conquered Malwa around 625 of which it remained a part until his death 647. Following this the history of Malwa is mostly unknown. In 756 AD, the Gurjara Empire conquered Malwa. In 786, the Rashtrakuta Empire conquered the region from the Gurjaras. During this period, Malwa was made a vassal kingdom under the House of Paramara.\n\n\n=== House of Paramara (947–1305) ===\nIn 947 AD, Siyaka, the ruler of Malwa and vassal of the Rashtrakuta Empire declared his independence. His son Munja defeated Sambhar, Mewar, Tripuri, Nadol and Gurjaratra. However, in 998, the Chalukya Kingdom of Kalyani defeated and conquered the southern territories of Malwa. His brother succeeded him and defeated Kalyani kingdom and took back the lost territories. His grandson Bhoja (r. 1010–1055) made extensive conquests. He made an alliance between the Kingdom of Tripuri, the Chola empire and the Kingdom of Malwa and defeated the Kingdom of Kalyani. In 1048, the Kingdom of Kalyani invaded and sacked the capital of Malwa, and forced to cede territories up till the Narmada.\nAfter his death, he was succeeded by his son. Jayasimha I was defeated by an alliance of Gujarat and Tripuri. Jayasimha's successor and Bhoja's brother Udayaditya was defeated by Chamundaraja, his vassal at Vagada. He repulsed an invasion by the King of Gujarat, Karna, with help from his allies.  Udayaditya's eldest son Lakshmadeva has been credited with defeating the Kingdom of Tripuri. Udayaditya's younger son Naravarman faced several defeats, losing to the Kingdom of Bundelkhand and the Gurjara king Jayasimha Siddharaja. By the end of his reign, one Vijayapala had carved out an independent kingdom to the north-east of Ujjain.\nYashovarman lost control of the capital Dhara to Jayasimha Siddharaja. His successor Jayavarman I regained control of Dhara, but soon lost it to an usurper named Ballala. The Gurjara king Kumarapala defeated Ballala around 1150 AD, supported by his feudatories the Naddula ruler Alhana and the Abu Paramara chief Yashodhavala. Malwa then became a province of the Gurjara kingdom. A minor branch of the Paramaras, who styled themselves as Mahakumaras, ruled the area around Bhopal during this time. Nearly two decades later, Jayavarman's son Vindhyavarman defeated the Gurjara king Mularaja II, and re-established the sovereignty of Malwa. During his reign, Malwa faced repeated invasions from the Hoysalas and the Yadavas of Devagiri. He was also defeated by the Gurjara general Kumara. Despite these setbacks, he was able to restore the Paramara power in Malwa before his death.\nVindhyavarman's son Subhatavarman invaded Gujarat, and plundered the territory. But he was ultimately forced to retreat by the Gurjara feudatory Lavana-Prasada. His son Arjunavarman I also invaded Gujarat, and defeated Jayanta-simha (or Jaya-simha), who had usurped the throne for a brief period. He was defeated by Yadava general Kholeshvara in Lata.\nArjunavarman was succeeded by Devapala, who was the son of Harishchandra, a Mahakumara (chief of a Paramara branch). He continued to face struggles against Gujarat and the Yadavas. The Sultan of Delhi Iltutmish captured Bhilsa during 1233-34 AD, but Devapala defeated the Sultanate's governor and regained control of Bhilsa. He was killed by Vagabhata of Ranthambhor, who suspected him of plotting his murder in connivance with the Delhi Sultan.\nDuring the reign of Devapala's son Jaitugideva, the power of Malwa greatly declined because of invasions from the Yadava king Krishna, the Delhi Sultan Balban, and the Vaghela prince Visala-deva. Devapala's younger son Jayavarman II also faced attacks from these three powers. Jayavarman II moved the Malwa capital from Dhara to the hilly Mandapa-Durga (present-day Mandu), which offered a better defensive position.\nArjunavarman II, the successor of Jayavarman II, proved to be a weak ruler. He faced rebellion from his minister. In the 1270s, the Yadava ruler Ramachandra invaded Malwa, and in the 1280s, the Ranthambhor ruler Hammira also raided Malwa. Arjuna's successor Bhoja II also faced an invasion from Hammira.\nMahalakadeva, the last known Paramara king, was defeated and killed by the army of Ayn al-Mulk Multani, a general of Alauddin Khalji of the Delhi Sultanate, in 1305 AD.\n\n\n=== Delhi Interregnum ===\nThe Sultanate of Delhi annexed Malwa following it's invasion and it remained a province of the sultanate for nearly a century until 1401, when the governor of Malwa declared his independence from the Sultan and re-established the independent Kingdom of Malwa.\n\n\n=== Ghurid dynasty ===\nDilawar Khan Ghuri, the governor of Malwa for the Delhi Sultanate asserted his independence in 1392, but did not actually assume the ensigns of royalty till 1401. Initially Dhar was the capital of the new kingdom, but soon it was shifted to Mandu, which was renamed Shadiabad (the city of joy). After his death, he was succeeded by his son Alp Khan, who assumed the title of Hoshang Shah.\nThe Muzaffarids under Zafar Khan Muzaffar Shah I accused Hoshang of parricide and invaded Malwa. Hoshang was defeated and captured as a prisoner, while a Muzaffarid governor was appointed in his pace at Dhar.\n\n\n=== Khalji dynasty ===\nThe Ghurid dynasty, founded by Dilawar Khan Ghuri, was replaced by Mahmud Shah I, who proclaimed himself king on 16 May 1436. The Khalji dynasty, founded by him, ruled over Malwa till 1531.\nThe kingdom saw heavy decline in 1519 after the continues invasions of Rajput king Rana Sanga of Mewar. Mahmud Khalji I was succeeded by his eldest son Ghiyas-ud-Din.\nThe last days of Ghiyas-ud-Din were embittered by a struggle for throne between his two sons, with Nasir-ud-Din emerging victorious over Ala-ud-Din and ascending the throne on 22 October 1510,  The last ruler Mahmud Shah II surrendered to Bahadur Shah, the sultan of Gujarat after the fort of Mandu fell to Bahadur on 25 May 1531.\nSince 1518, Mahmud Shah II was a vassal of the Gujarat Sultan. The last ruler Mahmud Shah II surrendered to Bahadur Shah, the sultan of Gujarat after the fort of Mandu fell to Bahadur on 25 May 1531. During 1531 – 1537 the kingdom was annexed under the control of Bahadur Shah, though the Hindustani emperor Humayun captured it for a short period during 1535–36. The Gujaratis regained Malwa giving allegiance to Bahadur Shah until 1542.\nIn 1537, Qadir Shah, an ex-officer of the previous Khalji dynasty rulers, regained control over a part of the erstwhile kingdom. But in 1542, Sher Shah Suri conquered the kingdom, defeating him and appointed Shuja'at Khan as the governor. His son, Baz Bahadur, declared himself independent in 1555. Darya Khan Gujarati, the ex-Wazir of Mahmud Khan of Gujarat ruled Ujjain.\nIn 1561, emperor Akbar sent the Hindustani army, led by Adham Khan and Pir Muhammad Khan, which attacked Malwa and defeated Baz Bahadur in the battle of Sarangpur on 29 March 1561, culminating in the Mughal conquest of Malwa. Akbar soon recalled Adham Khan and made over command to Pir Muhammad. Pir Muhammad attacked Khandesh and proceeded up to Burhanpur, but he was defeated by a coalition of three powers: Miran Mubarak Shah II of Khandesh, Tufal Khan of Berar Sultanate and Baz Bahadur. Pir Muhammad died while retreating. The confederate army pursued the Mughals and drove them out of Malwa. Baz Bahadur regained his kingdom for a short period. In 1562, Akbar sent another army, led by Abdullah Khan, an Uzbeg, which finally defeated Baz Bahadur. He fled to Chittor. It became the Malwa Subah (top-level province) of the Hindustani Empire, with seat at Ujjain and Abdullah Khan became its first governor.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMalwa\nList of Indian monarchs\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Jewish Community of Hamburg is one of the larger Jewish communities in Germany, with 2,289 members (as of 2021). It forms an independent state association within the nationwide Central Council of Jews in Germany. The chair of the community is Philipp Stricharz.\nIn addition to the Jewish Community of Hamburg, there is also the \"Liberal Jewish Community of Hamburg\" with over 300 members and the \"Jewish Educational Center Chabad Lubavitch Hamburg e.V.\".\n\n\n== History of the Jewish Communities ==\n\n\n=== Sephardim from 1590 to 1939 in Hamburg and Altona ===\n\nSephardim originating from Portugal settled in Hamburg from 1590 onwards, initially without founding a community. At first, many Sephardim, whose families had converted to Catholicism under threat of death, did not openly practice Judaism. In 1612, the Hamburg Council granted Sephardic Jews equal commercial rights to other Hamburg citizens through the \"Kaufmannshantierung\". The Sephardim founded three synagogue communities called Kether Thorah, Neweh Schalom and Thalmud Thorah, which they united in 1652 into the Holy Community of the Sephardim Beith Israel. One notable member was Herbert Pardo, who served multiple times as its chairman until 1933. The Sephardic community existed independently until it was forcibly incorporated into the Jewish Religious Association in Hamburg in July 1939.\nIn Altona, which had belonged to Hamburg since 1937, Sephardim had lived since before 1647. They founded the Holy Community Neweh Schalom only in 1770, which the few remaining members dissolved in 1887 due to too few members.\n\n\n=== Ashkenazim from 1610 to 1945 ===\n\n\n==== Hamburg until 1812 ====\nAshkenazim first gained the possibility of residence in Hamburg around 1610, provided they were employed as staff in Sephardic households or businesses. The Sephardim called the Ashkenazi Jews \"Tudescos\" (Portuguese for 'Germans'). Around 1661/1662 they founded the German-Israelite Community of Hamburg (DIG). The city of Hamburg granted residence permits very restrictively, so the DIG in Hamburg was smaller than its branch communities in Altona and Wandsbek (part of Hamburg since 1937). Ashkenazim without residence permits generally had to spend the night outside Hamburg and therefore officially chose their place of residence in the aforementioned, then Danish-Holstein cities. However, since they earned their livelihoods predominantly in Hamburg, they usually spent their days in Hamburg. From 1671 to 1812, the DIG formed part of the so-called Three Communities AHU (Altona, Hamburg, Wandsbek). From 1812 to 1938, the DIG existed independently and then merged into the Jewish Religious Association in Hamburg.\nIn 1710, the city of Hamburg issued the Regulations for the Jewish Community in Hamburg of both Portuguese and High German People. This came about through the mediation of Emperor Joseph I, who thus did not want to give up the old imperial Jewish regalia.\n\n\n=== In Altona until 1938 ===\nFour Ashkenazim are documented in Altona before 1611. A community, the High German Israelite Community in Altona (HIG), was founded after 1611. Between 1621 and 1812, the HIG operated a branch in Hamburg for Ashkenazim who could not obtain a residence permit in Hamburg and therefore formally had their place of residence in the liberal Holstein-Pinneberg Altona (belonging to Danish-ruled Holstein-Rendsburg from 1640). From 1671 to 1812, the HIG was the leading member of the Three Communities AHU (Altona, Hamburg, Wandsbek). It existed independently from 1812 to 1938 and then merged into the Jewish Religious Association in Hamburg.\n\n\n=== In Wandsbek until 1938 ===\nThe Israelite Community of Wandsbek (IGW) was founded in Wandsbek sometime between 1621 and 1650. From 1688 to 1812, the IGW maintained a branch in Hamburg for Ashkenazim who did not receive a residence permit in Hamburg and therefore formally took up residence in the liberal Danish-Holstein Wandsbek. The IGW was also a member of the Three Communities AHU (Altona, Hamburg, Wandsbek) from 1671 to 1812. It existed independently from 1812 to 1938 and then merged into the Jewish Religious Association in Hamburg.\n\n\n=== The \"Three Communities of Altona-Hamburg-Wandsbek\" from 1671 to 1812 ===\nIn 1671, the DIG, HIG and IGW founded a community alliance through a contract, the so-called Three Communities of Altona-Hamburg-Wandsbek (AHU). The umbrella organization provided services for all three communities and their respective branch communities. This included a joint religious court (Beth Din), joint cemeteries, hospitals and other facilities. Through the Napoleonic conquest of 1806 and the annexation of Hamburg as part of the First French Empire from 1811 to 1814, all residence of Hamburg, including Jews, gained French citizenship and thus equal civil rights. In the Empire, all Jewish communities were subject to the central Jewish Consistory of France. Therefore, the DIG had to abandon the community alliance with the non-French communities HIG and IGW, which is why the three communities dissolved the Three Communities by contract in 1812.\nFrom 1812 onwards, the residence restrictions that had forced Ashkenazim working professionally in Hamburg to formally reside in Altona or Wandsbek were lifted. The branch communities of the HIG and IGW in Hamburg were taken over by the now independent DIG.\n\n\n=== In Harburg until 1938 ===\nAshkenazic Jews lived in Harburg on the Elbe (part of Hamburg since 1937) since 1610. They founded a community before 1718. In contrast to the three cities of Altona, Hamburg and Wandsbek, which were easily accessible to each other even on foot and certainly by waggon, one could only reach Harburg from the other three by ship. Accordingly, the Harburg community was not involved in the joint institutions of the Three Communities. Through the Napoleonic conquest in 1803 and the annexation of the Electorate of Hanover (1807), to which Harburg belonged, initially by Jérôme Bonaparte's Kingdom of Westphalia and then as part of Napoleon Bonaparte's First French Empire from 1810 to 1814, all Harburgers, including Jews, gained equal civil rights. With the defeat of the Bonapartes, the previous conditions were restored. New laws in 1842 made Jews in the Kingdom of Hanover (as it was called since 1814) equal to other citizens, and at the same time it obliged Jews to form Jewish communities where this had not already happened. These communities then had to fulfill the state requirements for Jewish religious instruction in private or public schools and ensure all other religious tasks (maintenance of cemeteries and synagogues, holding of services, and conducting weddings). Four regional rabbis were appointed for the entire kingdom, each having to serve their own district. Harburg belonged to the regional rabbinate of Hanover.\nThe regional rabbis fulfilled both religious and state duties. Hanover was thus one of the few countries in the German Confederation where Judaism, like the Christian denominations, had a state-recognized and monitored organization. The regional rabbis had a semi-state authoritarian relationship with the Jewish communities and their members and employees, similar to how the Lutheran consistories related to their communities in Hanover at that time. The organization of the regional rabbinates remained in place even after the Prussian annexation in 1866, although the Prussian authorities in the old Prussian territories did everything to prevent central Jewish associations and denied them any state recognition. According to the Imperial Constitution of 1919, which separated church and state, the semi-state duties of the regional rabbis (school supervision) were abolished and their function was limited to purely religious matters. Since the unification of the cities of Harburg and Wilhelmsburg in 1927, the Jewish community took the name Synagogue Community Harburg-Wilhelmsburg (SHW). It merged into the Jewish Religious Association in Hamburg in 1938.\n\n\n=== In Hamburg 1815 to 1938 ===\nAfter the end of the First French Empire, the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg was restored as a state and the Jewish Regulations of 1710 for the German-Israelite Community of Hamburg (DIG) were reintroduced. This became possible because at the last consultative session of the Vienna Congress on the German Federal Act concerning the regulation of the rights of Jews, the text \"The confessors of the Jewish faith shall retain the rights already granted to them in the individual federal states\" was slightly but consequentially changed to: \"The confessors of the Jewish faith shall retain the rights already granted to them by the individual federal states.\" Since it was the French and not the Hamburg state that had emancipated the Jews of Hamburg, Hamburg revoked emancipation in 1815 and declared the Jewish Regulations to remain valid. Emancipation in Hamburg then took place on 21 February 1849, in implementation of a resolution of the Frankfurt National Assembly. In the cities of Altona and Wandsbek, the emancipation of Jews took place as in all of Holstein by law on 14 July 1863.\nIn 1860, freedom of religion was enshrined in the Hamburg constitution. From 1865 onwards, membership in the Jewish community was no longer compulsory. In 1867, the new German-Israelite Community was founded as a religious community with voluntary membership. The DIG was now an umbrella organization for two independent religious associations; the third association founded in 1894, Neue Dammtor-Synagoge, was also statutorily recognized as equal after World War I. The DIG was not committed to one tradition in religious matters, but offered all Ashkenazi Jews the opportunity to be members of the one community that cultivated different religious traditions through internally autonomous religious associations (the so-called Hamburg System). Other German Jewish communities were often organized separately according to religious traditions, so that several Jewish communities of different orientations existed side by side in one place.\nThe DIG financed services such as education, health care, poor relief and cemeteries from the taxes of community members, which all community members could make use of if needed. In addition, under the umbrella of the DIG, there were religious associations which male community members could join as fee-paying members, but did not have to. These religious associations maintained synagogues, religious celebrations and instruction, and employed trained rabbis and teachers according to the three major religious traditions, namely Orthodoxy, Reform Judaism (founded in Hamburg) and the mainstream position formed in the 19th century, taking a middle position between the two.\nOne religious association was the Orthodox German-Israelite Synagogue Association, which had 1,200 paying members nationwide; the other was the liberal Israelite Temple Association (founded 11 December 1817), which was close to Reform Judaism and had 700 paying members nationwide. The third association cultivated the mainstream tradition and was called Neue Dammtor-Synagoge, and had the largest number of members. The figures do not include non-paying members such as family members and the poor.\n\n\n== References ==",

It will be held from 4 September to 15 October 2024.\n\n\n== Format ==\nLeague C maintains the same format introduced for the 2023–24 season, but this edition will include a play-in round after the conclusion of the groups. In addition, the group matches will be played at a centralized venues instead of the previous home-and-away format.\nThe nine participating teams were split into three groups of three teams and each group is played on a double round-robin basis, with matches being held in the official FIFA match windows in September and October 2024. The first-placed team of each group and the best second-placed team among all groups will be promoted to the 2025–26 CONCACAF Nations League B, but will also advance to the play-in round in which they will join 4 teams from the League A in order to compete to qualify for the 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup qualification tournament.\n\n\n=== 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup qualification ===\nAs announced by CONCACAF in February 2023, the 2024–25 CONCACAF Nations League will serve as a qualifier for the 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup. League C teams may not qualify directly for the 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup final tournament but may qualify via the Gold Cup qualification tournament (also called CONCACAF Gold Cup prelims).\n\n\n== Teams ==\nA total of nine national teams contested League C, including the five sides that failed to be promoted last season and four teams relegated from the 2023–24 League B.\n\n\n=== Team changes ===\nThe following were the team changes in League C regarding the 2023–24 season:\n\n\n=== Seeding ===\nThe pots were confirmed on 19 April 2024, with the sixteen League C teams being split into three pots of three teams, based on the CONCACAF Rankings as of 31 March 2024.\n\n\n=== Draw ===\nThe draw for the groups composition was held on 6 May 2024, 19:00 EDT (UTC−4), in Miami, Florida, United States, where the nine involved teams were drawn into three groups of three. The draw began by randomly selecting a team from Pot 1 and placing them in Group A and then selecting the remaining teams from Pot 1 and placing them into groups B and C in sequential order. The draw continued with the same procedure done for the remaining pots.\nThe draw resulted in the following groups:\n\n\n== Groups ==\nIn an effort to reduce the travel disruptions faced by teams in previous editions, CONCACAF decided that the League C matches scheduled for a given FIFA match window will be held at a centralized venue.\nIn this way, the National Association of the second-highest ranked team in each group, once the draw has been made, will be responsible for hosting all matches in its group scheduled for the September FIFA match window. Likewise, the top-ranked team in each group, once the draw has been made, will be responsible for hosting all matches in its group scheduled in the October FIFA match window. The match schedule (including days) was predetermined to provide proper rest time in between matches.\n\nAll match times are in EDT (UTC−4) as listed by CONCACAF (local times, if different, are in parentheses).\n\n\n=== Group A ===\n\n\n=== Group B ===\n\n\n=== Group C ===\n\n\n=== Ranking of second-placed teams ===\n\n\n== Play-in ==\nThe play-in round will be contested by the two bottom teams from each group of League A (teams ranked 5th and 6th) and the top four teams from League C (three group winners and the best team among the group runners-up). Pairings will be determined based on the teams' results during the group stage.\n\nThe match-ups will be as follows:\n\nPlay-in 1 (PI1): League A best 5th placed team vs League C best group runner-up\nPlay-in 2 (PI2): League A next 5th placed team vs League C third best group winner\nPlay-in 3 (PI3): League A best 6th placed team vs League C second best group winner\nPlay-in 4 (PI4): League A next 6th placed team vs League C best group winner\nThe first legs will be played on 11–19 November, and the second legs will be played on 11–19 November 2024.\n\nNote: Order of legs has not been announced.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

He was educated at the Merchant Taylors’ School and St. John’s College, Oxford, of which he was scholar and afterwards fellow (B.A. 1683, M.A. 1687–8, D.D. 1696). He was domestic chaplain to Sir William Dawes, afterwards bishop of Chester and archbishop of York, who was his close friend. Among his preferments were the rectory of St. Sepulchre’s, London, of Wheldlake in Yorkshire, and of St. Mary's, Hull, and he was successively a prebendary of Chester, a prebendary of York (1716), and archdeacon of York (1720), He died 22 November 1730. He published a small collection of Latin verses, consisting of a translation into Latin of the poem of Musæus on Hero and Leander, and of part of the fifth book of John Milton’s ‘Paradise Lost;’ and two original poems, one called ‘Hibernia Plorans,’ written in 1689, the year of the siege of Londonderry, deploring Ireland's woes, in the style of Virgil's Eclogues, and the other an elegy on the death, in 1688, of Frederick, the Great Elector of Brandenburg. These were all published together in a little sixpenny pamphlet, under the title of ‘Lusus Amatorius, sive Musæi de Herone et Leandro carmen; cui accedunt Tres Nugæ Poeticæ,’ at London in 1693.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Bayne, Ronald (1886). \"Blake, Charles\".

The waters reached a level of 4.76 meters (16 feet; 190 inches) in height and went to the Porto Alegre Public Market, Rua da Praia, and the city center. Another consequence of the flood was the destruction of a large part of the Riacho Railway, which connected the center with the neighborhoods in the southern city; and the urgency for the canalization of Arroio Dilúvio, which had been started in 1939, and its city government was assisted by the federal government.\n\n\n== Causes ==\nWater from Guaíba drains into the lake. At the time, precipitation totaled 791 millimetres (2.6 ft; 31 in). The recurrence time for this flood is 370 years. The American Red Cross allocated US$10,000 to those affected.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Rainier Russet is a russet potato cultivar released in 2020. It was developed at the Small Grains and Potato Germplasm Research Center in Aberdeen, Washington. The breeding parents of Rainier are Canela Russet and an Aberdeen breeding clone. It has cold-sweetening resistance, so it can be processed directly out of storage into many frozen potato products. However, it is classified as a fresh market potato, indicating that it is primarily grown for direct consumption rather than for processing into potato products like chips or fries.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Vladimir Matykhin (Russian: Владимир Георгиевич Матюхин; born 4 February 1945 in Moscow, RSFSR) is a Russian general.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBorn February 4, 1945. After graduating from high school, from 1962 to 1964, he worked as a laboratory assistant at the Department of Theoretical Physics at the Moscow State Pedagogical University, equipment adjuster at the Moscow Electric Lamp Plant. In 1964 he entered the Moscow Energy Institute, graduating in 1968, and worked as an engineer at the Joint Design Bureau of the same institute.\nSince 1969 he served in the KGB of the USSR. He served in the 8th Main Directorate of the KGB of the USSR (encryption and decryption, it was also responsible for government communications), beginning his service as an engineer. Simultaneously with his service, he received additional education: in 1973 he graduated from the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics of the Moscow State University and in 1983 graduate school at the Dzerzhinsky Higher School of the KGB.\nWhen, after the collapse of the USSR in December 1991, the Federal Agency for Government Communications and Information under the President of the Russian Federation (FAPSI) was separated from the KGB, among other intelligence services, Matyukhin joined FAPSI and was appointed head of the Research Center of the Main Security Directorate FAPSI communications. From 1993 he served as Deputy General Director of FAPSI.\nOn May 31, 1999, by decree of the President of the Russian Federation Yeltsin, he was appointed General Director of FAPSI. Colonel General V. G. Matyukhin became the third and last head of FAPSI.\nSince January 2001, as Director General of FAPSI, he was a member of the Operational Headquarters for managing counter-terrorism actions in the North Caucasus region, created by decree of the President of the Russian Federation. He was a member of the Security Council of the Russian Federation (from June 14, 1999, to June 21, 2003). Since June 13, 2000, member of the Russian Government Commission on Military-Industrial Issues. Since November 2000 - Chairman of the Coordination Council for ensuring the security of encryption tools and their operation in government and closed communications systems of the CIS member states.\nOn March 11, 2003, President of the Russian Federation Putin signed a number of decrees aimed at reforming government bodies in Russia. In particular, FAPSI was abolished, its functions were distributed between the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation, the Foreign Intelligence Service of the Russian Federation and the Federal Protective Service of the Russian Federation. At the same day, Vladimir Matyukhin was appointed chairman of the State Committee of the Russian Federation for State Defense Orders under the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation and First Deputy Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation. On the same day, March 11, 2003, by decree No. 305 of the President of Russia, Matyukhin was awarded the military rank of army general.\nIn April 2004, the State Committee for Defense Orders was transformed into the Federal Service for Defence Contracts of the Russian Federation under the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation. However, Matyukhin was not placed at the head of the new service, but was appointed First Deputy Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation. He worked in this position for less than a month and was discharged from military service in May 2004.\nSince June 8, 2004 to 2010 he served as Director of the Federal Agency for Information Technologies of the Russian Federation (Rosinformtekhnologii). On January 26, 2010, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin signed a governmental decree releasing Matyukhin from his post “due to reaching the age limit” for holding it.\nSince December 16, 2010, he has been First Deputy General Director and Scientific Director of the Research and Design Institute of Information, Automation and Communications in Railway Transport (JSC NIIAS).\nHe is Doctor of Technical Sciences, a full member of the Russian Academy of Cryptography, the Russian Academy of Engineering Sciences and the International Academy of Communications. Laureate of the State Prize of the Russian Federation. For his great contribution to the development of information technology and the implementation of state policy in the field of informatization, he was awarded a Certificate of Honor from the Government of the Russian Federation, and received letters of gratitude from the President of the Russian Federation, the Chairman of the Federation Council of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation and the Government of the Russian Federation. Author of more than 150 scientific papers and four inventions. Married and has a son.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Alexander Gil the younger, also spelled Gill, (1597–1642) was an English headmaster and poet. He was the high-master of St. Paul's School.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nGil was the son of Alexander Gill the elder. He was born, probably at Norwich, in 1597. He obtained a scholarship at St. Paul's School, London, of which his father became highmaster in 1608. He matriculated from Trinity College, Oxford, 26 June 1612; became an exhibitioner of Wadham College in 1612, and bible-clerk there 20 April 1613; proceeded B.A. 1616, and M.A. 1619. He afterwards returned to Trinity, where he took the degrees of B.D. (27 June 1627) and D.D. (9 March 1636–7) (Oxf. Univ. Reg., Oxford Hist. Soc. II. ii. 326, iii. 344). Gill was of very unruly disposition, and was, according to the pamphleteers of the day, on bad terms with the university authorities; but he displayed much skill as a writer of Latin and Greek verse. As early as 1612 he published a Latin threnody on the death of Prince Henry. At Michaelmas 1621 he was appointed under-usher of St. Paul's School. John Milton was among his pupils; a close intimacy sprang up between them, and many of Milton's Latin letters to Gill are preserved. On 20 May 1628 the poet writes in extravagant terms of Gill's Latin verses. On 2 July following he sent Gill some of his own Latin verses for him to criticise and correct. On 4 December 1634 Milton again thanks Gill for a gift of Latin verses. Meanwhile, Gill had fallen into serious trouble, and lost his post at St. Paul's School. He was visiting his friends at Trinity College, Oxford, about Michaelmas 1628, when he drank a health to John Felton, Buckingham's assassin, and made some disrespectful remarks about the king. William Chillingworth, with whom, according to Aubrey, Gill was in the habit of corresponding, was of this party, and deemed it fitting to inform William Laud of what had passed. Gill was committed to the Gatehouse at Westminster (4 September) by Laud's orders, and was examined in the Star-chamber by Laud and Attorney-general Heath on 6 September. Laud's report of the proceedings sent to the king appears in his correspondence (Anglo-Cath. Libr. vii. 16–18). A search at Oxford in the rooms of William Pickering of Trinity College, an intimate friend of Gill, disclosed letters and verses by him (some dated in 1626), abusing Buckingham and Charles I. Gill admitted his guilt, and was sentenced (1 November) to degradation from the ministry, to a fine of 2,000l., and to the loss of both ears (one to be removed at Oxford, and the other in London). Gill's father immediately petitioned for a remission of the sentence, and Edward, earl of Dorset, supported the appeal (Aubrey). Laud, a friend of the elder Gill, consented to mitigate the fine, and to forego the corporal punishment. On 30 November 1630 a free pardon was signed by Charles I. Gill, now dismissed from his ushership, received small gratuities from the governors of St. Paul's School in 1631, 1633, and 1634. He tried to retrieve his reputation by publishing in 1632 a little volume of collected Latin verse, entitled ‘Parerga sive Poetici Conatus,’ containing a fulsome dedication to the king and a profoundly respectful poem to Laud, dated 1 January 1631–2, besides much verse to other royal or noble personages, and odes on the successes of Gustavus Adolphus in Germany.\nAccording to Anthony Wood, Gill obtained temporary employment at the school of Thomas Farnaby in Cripplegate. On 18 November 1635, the day following his father's death, he was elected his father's successor in the high-mastership of St. Paul's School. In 1639 complaints were made of his excessive severity towards a boy named Bennett, and at the end of the year he was dismissed. In the school accounts there is an entry of 13l. 7s. 11d. as ‘charges for displacing Dr. Gill,’ which implies some resistance on his part. On 28 January 1639 Gill appealed to the king to reverse the decision on the ground that it was based on ‘the unjust complaint of a lying, thieving boy’ (Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1639–40, p. 389). The king referred the petition to Archbishop Laud and ‘some other lords.’ The Mercers' Company, the governing body of the school, insisted on their right to deal with Gill as they pleased. Laud argued that Gill could not be removed, according to canon law, without his ordinary's knowledge (Laud, Works, iv. 80–1). But the company gained the day, and Laud's remarks about the canon law formed the subject of the tenth charge brought against him at his trial. Two coarse doggerel poems, headed respectively ‘On Doctor Gill, master of St. Paul's School,’ and ‘Gill upon Gill … uncas'd, unstript, and unbound,’ dwelt on Gill's whipping propensities and savage temper. They were first issued with the ‘Loves of Hero and Leander,’ London, 1651, and reappear in ‘The Rump,’ 1660. Aubrey writes that Dr. Gill had ‘his moods and humours as particularly his whipping fits.’ During his last year at the school Gill was refused the usual extra payments and gratuities allowed by the Mercers' Company to the high-master of St. Paul's. On 22 February 1639 – 1640 a pension of 25l. was granted him, and 50l. was given him later in discharge of his claims. He died at the close of 1642, having ‘taught certain youths privately in Aldergate Street, London, to the time of his death’ (Wood). He was buried in the church of St. Botolph without Aldersgate.\nBesides the works noted above, Gill printed \n\n‘Arithmeticorum Hanamnēsis’ at the end of N. Simpson's ‘Arithmeticæ Compendium,’ 1623;\n‘Panthea. In honorem illustriss. spectatiss. omnibus Animi Corporisque Dotibus instructiss. Heroinæ, qua mihi in Terris,’ &c., 4to (Wood);\n‘A Song of Victory upon the Proceedings and Success of the Wars undertaken by the most puissant King of Sweden,’ in English verse, London, 1632, 4to (Wood).\nGill's ‘Ἐπίνικιον,’ a poem on Gustavus Adolphus's victories, dated 1631, of which a manuscript copy is among the Tanner MSS. (306) at the Bodleian Library, was reprinted separately from the ‘Parerga,’ according to Wood, and also at the close of ‘A New Starr of the North,’ London, 1632.\nA Latin congratulatory poem on Charles I's return from Scotland, by Gill, was printed by John Waterson in 1641 (four leaves). A copy is at Lambeth (44, E. 1).\nWood further credits Gill with an elegy on Strafford in 1641, and describes a manuscript book, which ‘I have also seen,’ containing other Latin verses (fifteen poems in all), some addressed to friends, and some descriptive of Gustavus Adolphus's victories. This book does not now seem extant, but its contents are partly represented in manuscript pieces in Corpus Christi College, Oxford, in the Bodleian Library (Tanner MS. 306), and in the British Museum (Burney MS. 368, f. 16). Nine of the pieces mentioned by Wood are also extant with twelve others by Gill (‘Epithalamia,’ an interchange of complimentary verse with Isaac Oliver, verses to Bacon, &c., besides five letters to Laud) in a manuscript volume belonging to Thomas Frewen, esq., of Brickwall Hall, Northiam, Sussex. The volume belonged to Charles Blake, D.D., and was intended for the press (cf. Gent. Mag. 1851, i. 345–7).\nGill and Ben Jonson had a long-standing feud, which began as early as 1623, in consequence of the elder Gill's patronage of George Wither's satires. In the Ashmolean MSS. at the Bodleian Library are some abusive but interesting English verses by Gill on Ben Jonson's ‘Magnetick Lady,’ which Dr. Bliss printed in his edition of Wood's ‘Athenæ’ (ii. 598–599) under the error (afterwards corrected) that they were by the elder Gill. Zouch Townley defended Jonson from Gill's illiberal attack in a short poem (ib.)\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Lee, Sidney (1890). \"Gill, Alexander (1597-1642)\".

        "content": "The Jewish Community of Frankfurt am Main has been a public corporation and a member association of the Central Council of Jews in Germany since 1949.\nThe Frankfurt Jewish Community is one of the largest unified Jewish communities in Germany with an institutionalized administrative organization that is not associated with any particular Jewish movement.\nIts community center is located in Frankfurt's Westend district, and includes the Westend Synagogue and the Baumweg Synagogue, as well as several smaller synagogues and prayer rooms. The community also operates, among other things, the I.E. Lichtigfeld School at the Philanthropin, a senior citizens' home, and two kindergartens.\nThe 17-member elected community council elects the five-member community board. The members of the community council and board determine the work and direction of the community and represent it externally. The chairman is Salomon Korn, the rabbi of the community has been Rabbi Julien Chaim Soussan since 2013, and Rabbi Avichai Apel joined in 2016 as a second rabbi.\nAt the end of 2019, the community had 6,316 members.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== History until 1945 ===\nThe first evidence of a Jewish settlement in Frankfurt am Main dates back to 1150. As early as 1241 and 1349 there were the first persecutions, the so-called \"Judenschlachten\" (Jew-killings). Since 1360, with a short interruption during the Fettmilch Uprising (1614–1616), the Jewish Community of Frankfurt am Main remained in existence for almost six hundred years until its dissolution by the Nazis. It was not until 1864 that Frankfurt's Jewish residents gained full political and economic equality. In 1933, about 28,000 Jews lived in the city.\nThe Nazi seizure of power in 1933 marked, like everywhere in Germany, a deep cut in this development. Of the four large synagogues, only the Westend Synagogue on Freiherr-vom-Stein-Strasse was spared from the November 1938 Kristalnacht. More than 10,000 Jews were deported from Frankfurt am Main to the concentration and extermination camps, while others were able to emigrate.\nLeopold Neuhaus was the last rabbi of Frankfurt before World War II, serving until 1938. When the residents of the Jewish old people's home on Gagernstrasse in Frankfurt's Ostend district were deported in February 1942, he saw it as his duty to accompany them.\n\n\n=== The Provisional New Beginning ===\nAfter Frankfurt's liberation from the Nazis by the Allies, there were still about a hundred Jews remaining in Frankfurt, and another 300 returned from the concentration camps. In May 1945, on orders from the Frankfurt city administration, a small group of returnees from the Theresienstadt concentration camp were brought back to their hometown by bus. Among them were the re-founders of the Jewish Community in Frankfurt after the war: Rabbi Leopold Neuhaus and the merchant Max Meyer. Immediately after his return in 1945, Neuhaus opened a provisional care center for surviving Jews with Max Meyer at Friedrichstrasse 29. The first service took place eight days after the return from Theresienstadt in today's synagogue at Baumweg 5–7, which had housed a Jewish kindergarten before being confiscated by the Nazis. Regular services took place there from November 1945 onwards. In the same month, the \"New\" old people's home was established at Gagernstrasse 36, where there was also a service starting on Hanukkah in early December 1945. Religious instruction for children also resumed in November 1945. A month earlier, Rabbi Neuhaus had begun publishing a newsletter of the Jewish communities and care centers.\nIn the westernmost Frankfurt district of Zeilsheim, there was a DP camp. Between 1945 and 1949, an average of 3,500 Jews, predominantly from Poland, waited there for their entry permits. They wanted to emigarate to Palestine/Israel, the US and other overseas countries. All across Germany, approximate 200,000 Jewish refugees waited in DP camps between 1945 and 1950 to be able to move on. The Jews in Zeilsheim were organized in the Committee of Liberated Jews in Frankfurt. After the formal recognition of the Jewish Community as a public corporation, this committee merged with the Jewish Community on 27 April 1949. This united the two Frankfurt community organizations.\nRabbi Leopold Neuhaus emigrated to the US as early as 1946, and his successor Rabbi Wilhelm Weinberg left the Frankfurt community in 1951. In his farewell sermon, he also mentioned the circumstances for his departure: \"At the same time, however, it is a duty to say that even those among us who believed or wanted to believe in a change of thinking of the German people are gradually losing this belief. For even the politically blind gradually notice that those figures are once again haunting the German lands who worked for the smooth implementation of the brown order and the Nazi world conquest campaign, this time disguising their martial faces with the mien of injured innocence, but tomorrow showing their true face unveiled.\"\n\n\n== The Reconstruction of Community Life ==\nIn 1947, work began to convert the rooms in Baumweg into a synagogue, which was consecrated in the fall of 1948. In September 1950, the Westend Synagogue was also restored to its intended purpose. The two-year reconstruction had been financed by the State of Hesse, since the former community assets had not yet been returned. During these transitional years, there were several rabbis in Frankfurt. After Rabbi Neuhaus emigrated in 1946, there was a period without a rabbi until Rabbi Wilhelm Weinberg took office in June 1949. However, from 1947 to 1951, Uri Bluth, who had received his Semicha in Krakow, spent two years in Siberia and four years in Bukhara, served as rabbi in the Orthodox prayer room at Röderbergweg 29, the former Jewish adult education center. Rabbi Leon Thorn (1906–1978) was rabbi in Frankfurt from 1946 to 1948 and during this time editor of the journal Jeschurun. He is credited with establishing a Jewish soup kitchen, a Jewish afternoon school, the reopening of the Samson Raphael Hirsch School, and the founding of a charity fund.\n\n\n=== The Community Center ===\nWith the construction of the community center at Savignystrasse 66, the provisional character of the post-war Jewish community in Frankfurt came to an end. The older generation was now definitely no longer sitting on packed suitcases. \"Whoever builds a house wants to stay, and whoever wants to stay hopes for security,\" said Salomon Korn in his speech at the opening on 14 September 1986. With this community center as an administrative building without a synagogue, a secular concept was realized; the synagogue no longer formed the center of community life. Nevertheless, symbols of Judaism were chosen as design elements. A narrow stone replica of the Mosaic Tablets of the Law next to the main entrance is intersected by long and deep cracks, intended to hint at the fragility in the relationship between Jews and non-Jews. A list with the names of about 11,000 Frankfurt Jews deported to concentration camps by the Nazis was placed in the foundation stone beneath them. Facing the Tablets of the Law above the main entrance are three stylized seven-branched candelabra, symbols of light as a sign of a still uncertain hope for the future.\n\n\n== Budget ==\nIn the \"Frankfurt Agreement\" of 1990, the city of Frankfurt committed itself to supporting the Jewish Community, whose budget had been running a deficit for a long time. Strengthening Jewish life is a political goal of the city of Frankfurt. The increase in this financial aid to 2.4 million euros in 2007 takes into account the community's growth and increased expenditures. From 1989 to 2007, the number of members rose from around 4,500 to 7,100, with the immigration of Jews from the former Soviet Union contributing significantly to this growth. This led to increased efforts for integrating the immigrants. The founding of the Philanthropin secondary school, whose student numbers are growing rapidly, also created additional financial burdens. Furthermore, the costs for security measures have increased significantly because the threat of attacks by right-wing extremists and Islamists has increased.\nOn the basis of the state treaty signed by the State Association of Jewish Communities in Hesse and the Federal State of Hesse on 11 November 1986, and due to a cooperation agreement between the State Association of Jewish Communities in Hesse and the Jewish Community of Frankfurt, the Jewish Community of Frankfurt receives 70 percent of the state contractual state benefits. From 2008 onwards, the State of Hesse increased its contributions to the State Association of Jewish Communities in Hesse to 3.7 million euros, of which the Frankfurt community, as the largest community in the state, receives 70 percent because it performs central functions for the other communities.\nFurthermore, based on a special agreement of 10 November 2000 between the State of Hesse, the City of Frankfurt and the Jewish Community of Frankfurt, the State of Hesse provides a debt relief contribution for the Jewish Community of Frankfurt amounting to 1,277,100 euros. Nevertheless, Hesse then ranks among the lowest in terms of benefits provided, according to a survey of the states.\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nJewish Community of Frankfurt am Main (German)\nVideo interview with Salomon Korn, chairman of the Jewish community, about an exhibition celebrating the community's 50th anniversary.

        "content": "The 2011 Guinea-Bissau coup attempt was a failed coup d'état by a group of renegade soldiers. Taking place on the morning of December 26, 2011, fighting broke out between two factions in the armed forces with sounds of automatic weapons and rocket fire erupting in the Santa Luzia army base which alarmed residents in the country's capital of Bissau. Officials claim it started when Navy Chief Jose Americo Bubo Na Tchuto sent orders to arrest Army Chief Antonio Injai, who was later freed by his men. Afterwards, the Army Chief in turn arrested the Navy Chief for his involvement in the incident however he denies issuing such orders to his troops, saying he had been \"spending nights at home, not in the barracks.\"\nDuring the early hours of the coup when it was still unclear what was the cause of the trouble, some speculated it was an attack on the military HQ by soldiers demanding better pay while others claimed it was a struggle between the armed forces for control of drug smuggling routes. Prime Minister Carlos Gomes Junior momentarily took refuge in a foreign embassy. Government officials later clarified it was actually an attempt by a group of soldiers trying to overthrow the government during a press conference.\nIn the end, 30 perpetrators were arrested, among them being the Navy Chief for \"masterminding the coup.\" More skirmishes were executed by the army to make further arrests, including politicians, that resulted in a single casualty along with many more being injured. Guinea-Bissau's government announced plans to establish a commission of inquiry into the foiled coup attempt while African Union chairman Jean Ping expressed concern over the situation and urged dialogue for peace and stability.\nMeanwhile, President Malam Bacai Sanhá, who was undergoing medical treatment abroad, was absent during the coup attempt. He later died in January 2012, fueling further political instability in the country.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Squeeze pouch (or Baby food pouch, Fruit pouch, Pouch and Squeeze bag) is a tube-shaped package with usually fruit or baby food that has a liquid or porridge-like consistency. The product for children was invented in 2007 and pouches were introduced in the US in 2008. The product has become popular with parents and toddlers.\nThe bags are said to be intended for use as snacks. One manufacturer recommends serving the product directly on a spoon for easy feeding. However, it happens that children squeeze the packaging and suck in the contents.\nSimilar packaging and contents are also available for adults as space food and as sports-related nutrition.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nPediatricians have expressed concerns about the intake of supplementary pouches and also about the content including sugar/energy and the risk of tooth decay and obesity. Similar theoretical concerns are e.g. delaying motor development, diluting nutritional quality and increasing picky eating in young kids.\n\n\n== Research ==\nInfants who are exposed to baby food pouches are also exposed to other forms\nof fruits and vegetables. Even moderately with fruit pouches does not cause excess weight (at the age of 18 months). and consumption of fruit pouches are not associated with early manifestations of allergic disease.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBaby food\nBuddy Fruits\nRetort pouch\nSpace food\nSports nutrition\nStand-up pouch\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n \nCategory:Baby food\nCategory:Sports nutrition",

The species name, spelaeum, Latin for \"cave\", in reference to the sole locality which its remains have been found in, Port Kennedy Bone Cave.\nWhile fragmentary, Osmotherium spelaeum's jaws are the most prominent of any other Mephitid in the locality, with Cope himself describing 6 different specimens, although attributing some to Mephitis, Brachyprotoma and the now defunct Pelycictis.\nWhile information on these fragmentary remains scarce, in 2005 Wang et al.'s description of Martinogale faulli, Osmotherium was recovered as a sister genus to Mephitis: \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Matt Rowean (born August 6, 1982, in Boston, Massachusetts) is an American artist, creative director, and entrepreneur. He is a Partner and Chief Creative Officer at MATTE Projects.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMatt Rowean graduated from Syracuse University with a Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) degree in Painting and Communication Design. He also participated in the RISD Pre-college program. After completing his studies in 2004, Rowean relocated to New York City.\nIn 2008, he left Strategic Group and co-founded RJW (later rebranded as JWALK) alongside Doug Jacob and Charli Walk. The company worked with brands such as Lacoste, David Yurman, Equinox, and ABC. He oversaw the brand identity development of the seafood restaurant Catch, which expanded from a flagship in New York City to an international company with locations in L.A., Dubai, and Playa del Carmen.\nRowean shifted focus to fine art and other non-advertising pursuits after leaving RJW in 2011 due to a two-year non-compete. During this time, he worked on the branding of the Full Moon Festival, which led to joining Brett Kincaid and Max Pollack at MATTE Projects, helping to evolve it from a concert production entity to a holding company composed of several developed businesses based in New York. MATTE Projects is a full-service 360 creative services agency operating in entertainment (music & events), feature film production, and has its own venue \"HERO\".\nIn 2019, Rowean was among Emmy Nominees for Fyre: The Greatest Party that Never Happened.\nDuring his tenure as Chief Creative Officer, MATTE won several Clio awards for their campaign work with Cartier.\n\n\n== MATTE Projects ==\nFounded in 2011 by Brett Kincaid, Max Pollack. Matthew Rowean joined a year later and helped evolve MATTE Projects into a creative agency and production company known for organizing high-profile events like New York City's Full Moon Music Festival and Rihanna's Met Gala after-party. The company operates in cities like New York and Mexico City, and has worked with clients such as Tom Ford, Google, and Dom Pérignon. Besides events, MATTE Projects offers content creation, digital solutions, and experiential design, working with brands such as KITH, Adidas, Amazon, Cartier, and YSL and talent such as Kanye West, James Blake and Jay-Z.\nMATTE Projects also operates in the fashion industry, specializing in fashion events, live fashion show capture, campaigns, and directing fashion films for brands such as Marc Jacobs, Tom Ford, Alexander Wang, Ralph Lauren, Gucci, Puma and other brands.\nIn 2012, MATTE launched Full Moon, a boutique music festival at the South Street Seaport. Full Moon later moved to Governors Island and became a 10,000-person festival.\nThe company's collaborations include The Macallan, KITH, Cartier, Audemars Piguet, Yves Saint Laurent Beauté, Prada, Marriott, Apple, Airbnb, and more. Their work for Cartier was recognized by Clio Awards.\nIn 2024 MATTE partnered with PUMA to create their Forever Faster campaign, and is PUMA's biggest marketing investment yet – it's the brand's first worldwide brand campaign in 10 years with the objective to strengthen their positioning as the Fastest Sports Brand in the world.\nThe company produced Can't Stop Won't Stop: A Bad Boy Story. The film won the Hollywood Documentary Award at the 2017 Hollywood Film Awards. In 2019, company co-produced the Emmy-nominated Netflix documentary FYRE: The Greatest Party That Never Happened and initiated \"La Luna,\" an eco-friendly summer party. Through the pandemic, they created the documentary \"Hell Of A Cruise\", available Peacock, featuring the early spread of COVID-19 on cruise ships. The film focuses on the Diamond Princess cruise, which in January 2020 unknowingly became a hotspot for the virus, transforming a luxury voyage into a crisis.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMatt Rowean’s website\nMatt Rowean at IMDb\n\nCategory:21st-century American artists\nCategory:American entertainment industry businesspeople\nCategory:Syracuse University alumni\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:American film producers\nCategory:1982 births",

        "content": "Ojamo Manor (Finnish: Ojamon kartano, Swedish: Ojamo herrgård) is a manor house in Lohja in Uusimaa, Finland. The site is known for housing the remains of the oldest iron mine in Finland. The manor house is owned by a private foundation, Vanha Lohja -säätiö.\n\n\n== History ==\nOjamo Manor is named in the written sources for the first time in 1384. The significance of the manor house grew during the 16th century when iron ore was found from its grounds. The first findings are dated between 1528 and 1540.\n\n\n=== The Iron Mine ===\nThe King of Sweden, Gustav Vasa, gave Erik Fleming, the owner of Suitia Manor in Siuntio, a permission to mine iron ore from the grounds of Ojamo Manor in 1542. From Ojamo the iron was transported to Siuntio to be refined in Suitia Ironworks. The iron mine in Ojamo is the oldest known iron mine in Finland. Attempts to mine iron ore from the grounds of Ojamo were done even during the 19th century. However, the mining operations ceased for the last time in 1862.\n\n\n=== The Main Building ===\nThe current main building of Ojamo Manor was built using timber in 1850 by lieutenant colonel Dimitri Swertschkoff. Ojamo Manor represents richly decorated Russian empire style. The building has one floor and a centrally positioned tower, which is a later addition. The decorations on the window frames resemble Karelian building style.\nOjamo Manor is surrounded by a park. The southern part of the park has a maple alleyway, which leads to the grave of lieutenant colonel Swertschkoff. Other points of interest in the park area include several large mine openings on the ground, some of which are filled with water.\n\n\n== List of Owners ==\nA list of owners of Ojamo Manor from 1540 onwards:\n\nJohan Larsson 1540–1545\nHenrik Johansson 1546–1559\nHenrik Johansson's widow Anna 1560\nHans Johansson 1561–1596\nHans Johansson's widow Brita 1596–1603\nTomas Larsson 1616–1619\nSiegfrid 1620\nNils Siegfridsson 1621–1624\nSimon Landsberger 1624-1629 (renting from the Crown);\nabandoned 1630–1644\nJakob Wolle 1645-1646 (renting from the Crown)\nPeter Thorwöste the older and the younger 1647–1682\nGabriel Tammelinus, Vicar, 1683–1695\nAnna Eriksdotter 1695–1713\nBrita Tammelin 1724–1731\nHenrik Tammelin, Assessor, 1732–1753\nKristina Tammelin 1754\nJohan Gabriel Kihl, Assessor, 1755–1760\nJohan Gabriel Kihl's family 1760–1762\nJakob Johan Westberg, Supervisor, 176317–67\nKarl Segercrantz, Captain, 1768–1775\nAnna Stina Carlborg 1776–1782\nAdolf Magnus Rotkirch, Captain, 1783–1788\nAxel Maximilian Carpelan, Leutnant, 1789–1816\nAlbertina Eleonora 1816–1836\nAlbertina Eleonora's family 1836–1842;\nKarl von Schoultz, Lecturer, 1843–1846\nDmitri Swertschkoff, Lieutenant Colonel, 1847–1863\nAugusta Karolina Swertschkoff 1863–1869\nAugusta Karolina Swertschkoff's family 1869–1878\nFanny Swertschkoff 1878–1891\nIsidor Swertschkoff, governor, 1891–1902\nGustav Henrik Karlsson 1902–1922\nAntti Savolainen 1922–1968\nUnto and Eero Savolainen 1969–1992\nEero Savolainen 1993–1997\nFoundation \"Vanha Lohja -säätiö\" 1998-\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "James B. Elliott (1849–1931) was an American freethinker. Through his involvement with a number of freethinking organizations and publications, he met the anarchist Voltairine de Cleyre, with whom he had a brief romantic relationship and fathered a child, Harry. He spent the 1890s raising his son, working as a carpenter and collecting memorabilia of his idol Thomas Paine. By the turn of the 20th century, he succombed to a mental disorder and became estranged from his family, leaving his son and losing contact with de Cleyre.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nJames B. Elliott was born in 1849, in Philadelphia, where he was raised by his mother. He found work as a carpenter and later became a freethinker, giving lectures on rationalism at the Philadelphia Ethical Society and Friendship Liberal League, and writing articles for The Truth Seeker. Through one freethought newspaper, The Progressive Age, Elliott encountered the writings of Voltairine de Cleyre, noting her expressive anger towards the Catholic Church.\nIn June 1888, he greeted de Cleyre at the Philadelphia train station, having invited her to give a speech at a meeting of the Friendship Liberal League. The following year, she settled in the city and moved into Elliott's rooming house. The two were quickly attracted to each other, although historian Margaret Marsh notes that Elliott was \"intellectually inferior\" to de Cleyre and had an \"eccentric\" character, which left her to wonder why de Cleyre found him so appealing. They struck up a brief romantic relationship, but as de Cleyre refused to marry Elliott, it quickly broke down and ended. They remained friends and continued to live in the same house, with Elliott caring for de Cleyre's plants and pets while she was on lecture tours.\nOn June 12, 1890, de Cleyre gave birth to their son Harry, but she felt emotionally and physically unable to raise him, so left him in Elliott's care. De Cleyre's sister Adelaide D. Thayer, herself childless, asked if she could take care of Harry, but Elliott refused. In 1894, de Cleyre moved out of the Elliott household, finding a new home with the couple Mary and George Brown. In 1896, Elliott visited de Cleyre's mother Harriet De Claire and built an extension for her house in St. Johns, Michigan. Around this time, Elliott was made secretary of both the Paine Memorial Association and the Paine Historical Association. Elliott idolised Thomas Paine, going on a pilgrimage to all of Paine's homes in both North America and England and collecting his memorabilia.\nBy the turn of the 20th century, Elliott had become increasingly mentally imbalanced and left his son at the age of ten to fend for himself. In 1900, he managed to find de Cleyre's estranged father Hector De Claire, and together they sent Harriet a number of messages that worried her. For this, de Cleyre called Elliott a \"devil\" and said he was \"not right in his intellects\", telling her sister Adelaide that he had \"no self-respect whatever, but insists on intruding himself constantly everywhere.\"\nIn 1910, de Cleyre moved to Chicago and Elliott fell out of touch with her. After her death, her anarchist comrades claimed that Elliott had deliberately prevented de Cleyre from seeing their child, but Margaret Marsh notes that this depiction is inaccurate. Elliott himself died in 1931, at the age of 82. Elliott was posthumously denounced in anarchist newspapers for neglecting his son Harry and preventing de Cleyre from seeing her child; according to historian Margaret Marsh, this depiction was \"not strictly true, but it preserved an unsullied image\" of de Cleyre.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==",

He is a member of the Chinese Musician's Association, Director of the Chinese National Orchestra Society, Visiting professor at the China Conservatory of Music.\nZhao Manqin developed the kuaisu zhixu (Fast Finger Sequence Technique System) which drew on the playing techniques of piano, violin, and pipa.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nZhao Manqin was born in 1953 in the Xinye County of Henan Province, China. He started writing and publishing music at the age of 16. Zhao Manqin attended the Xinye County Middle School in 1965 and continued his education at the Seaman School in Xinye County in 1962. He later attended the Xinye County Middle School. Due to his father's persecution during the Cultural Revolution, Zhao was sent to perform agricultural work in the countryside in 1966. Despite this, he continued his involvement in music and joined various performance groups, including the Xinye County Cultural Troupe in 1972.\nIn 1972, he developed the kuaisu zhixu  (Fast Finger Sequence Technique System), which drew on the piano, violin, and pipa playing techniques. This system is widely used by the Guzheng industry in China.\nIn 1978, his fast-fingering composition, \"The Sun is Shining Red on Jinggang Mountain\", was included in the curriculum of the Central Conservatory of Music.\nFrom 1980, he was invited lecturer at major music conservatories and academies in China and internationally, including the Central Conservatory of Music, Folk Music Department of the Central Conservatory of Music, Xi'an Conservatory of Music, Xinghai Conservatory of Music, Shanghai Conservatory of Music, Normal University Music College, Guangxi Arts College, Kunming Medical University, Eastman School of Music in the United States and the National Australian University in Australia.\nIn the mid-1980s, he began work on Guzheng education and established the Guzheng Art Institute. He subsequently conducted educational courses in Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Kaifeng, Xinzheng, Xingyang, Henan Youtian, Nanyang, and Haikou and provided training to professional and amateur Guzheng teachers across China.\nIn 1986 his work \"Symmetry and Inertia\" was presented at the First National Guzheng Academic Conference along with the performance of the Guzheng piece dahu shangshan (Fighting the tiger in the mountain) by his disciple Wang Zhongshan using the fast fingering he developed which led to the recognition of his technique.\nMany of his students and master class students hold leading positions in various music performance groups and music institutions, including, Wang Zhongshan (Professor at China Conservatory of Music),  Li Meng (Professor at the Central Conservatory of Music), Fan Yifeng (Professor at Xi'an Conservatory of Music), Wang Wei (Professor at Shanghai Conservatory of Music), Luo Xiaoci (Director of Shanghai National Orchestra), Gao Liang (Professor at Shenyang Conservatory of Music), Chen Weimin (Associate professor at Xinghai Conservatory of Music), Zhang Tong (Professor at Harbin Normal University), Sun Zhuo (Professor at Shaanxi Normal University), and Mao Ya (Lecturer at the University of Tokyo in Japan), and others.\n\n\n== Guzheng performance techniques ==\nIn 1972, he developed the kuaisu zhixu  (Fast Finger Sequence Technique System) which drew on the playing techniques of piano, violin, and pipa. This system is widely used by the Guzheng industry in China. This system solved the limitation of Guzheng in playing fast passages of heptatonic scale and facilitated the inclusion of the Guzheng to perform with the rest of the traditional instruments in an orchestra setting. This system changed three finger wearing plectra playing in octave symmetry to all eight fingers wearing plectra plucking approach. This change expanded the potential Guzheng fingering sequences, allowing playing fast passages of pentatonic scale, heptatonic scale, and chromatic scale.\nIn 1978, his fast-fingering composition, \"The Sun is Shining Red on Jinggang Mountain\", was included in the curriculum of the Central Conservatory of Music.\nAfter the 1986 presentation of his work \"Symmetry and Inertia\" at the First National Guzheng Academic Conference, along with the performance of the Guzheng piece dahu shangshan (Fighting the tiger in the mountain) by his follower Wang Zhongshan using the fast fingering he developed, his technique gained recognition. This performance contributed to the nationwide spread of Zhao Manqin's fast finger sequence compositions such as \"The Sun is Shining Red on Jinggang Mountain\", \"Climbing the Mountain to Beat the Tiger\", \"Ode of Shan Dan Flower\", \"Evening Party\", and \"Hora Dance\".  It also led to the nationwide implementation of the fast-fingering system into Guzheng practice and performance. Composers subsequently started to compose contemporary repertoires using the fast-fingering sequence techniques, including \"Dance of Yi Tribe\", \"Spring in Xiangjiang River\", \"Eternal Lament of Li'an\", \"The Fantasia\", \"The Caprice of the Western Regions\", \"Ming Mountain\" and \"Forest Spring\". Most of these pieces have been chosen as part of the grade 9 and grade 10 repertoire for the National Examination Board.\n\n\n== Selected compositions ==\n\"Fantasy of the Embroidered Gold Plaque\" – First prize in the Henan Provincial Ethnic Instrumental Music Awards in 1983.\n\"Moon Gazing\" – First prize in the Henan Provincial Ethnic Instrumental Music Awards in 1983.\n\"The Sun Shines Over Jinggang Mountain\" – Second prize in the Henan Provincial Instrumental Music Awards in 1983.\n\"Gazing at the Moon\" – Award of Encouragement, \"National Third Music Works Competition\" held by the Ministry of Culture and China Musicians Association in 1984.\n\"Springing from the Roaring Yellow River\" (Collaboratively composed piece) – awarded the Second Prize in Vocal Composition by the Henan Musicians Association in 1985.\n\"Soul of the Yellow River\" – Gold Award at the second \"Star Award\" competition held by the Ministry of Culture, Ministry of Education, and Ministry of Broadcasting in 1991.\n\"The Melody of Henan\" – Gold Award at the 15th \"Star Award\" competition held by the Ministry of Culture in 2010.\n\n\n== Publications ==\n\"A Brief History of the Guzheng\", published in \"Music Research,\" (the most authoritative academic journal in China), issue 4,1981.\n\"Symmetry and Inertia\", published in the \"Proceedings of the National Guzheng Academic Exchange Conference\" and \"Discussion on Guzheng Study\", 1986.\n\"On the Application of Percussion in Nanyang Opera\" (co-authored), published in \"Opera Art\",1982.\n\"Urgent Problems Affecting the Development of Guzheng Art\", published by the Chinese National Symphony Orchestra in the \"Guzheng Collection of Papers\",1999.\n\"Problems in Guzheng Performance Mechanics- A Discussion with Mr. He Baoquan\", published in the \"Qin Zheng\", Issue 1, 2006\n\"The Artistic Crisis of Guzheng Under its Prosperous Appearance\", presented at the Beijing International Guzheng Art Festival (Highest National level Forum), 2008\n\"Questioning the Temperament of Chinese Folk Music\", published in the \"Journal of Henan Education College, Philosophy and Social Edition\", 2010.\n\"A Preliminary Exploration of the Pitch of Shaanxi Guzheng Performance\", published in \"Qinzheng\", Issue 1 and 2, 2010 and issue 1, 2011.\n\"New Theory of Temperament\", published in the \"Journal of Henan Education College\", issue 2, 2019.\n\n\n== Books ==\n\"An Introduction to Guzheng Fast Finger Sequence Technique\" (Volumes I and II), published by China Culture Publishing Company, 2002.

        "content": "Ali Akbar Derakhshani  (Persian: علی‌اکبر درخشانی; February 28, 1896 –  March 27, 1978) was one of the founders of the New Iranian Army. He began his military service during the reign of Ahmad Shah Qajar.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAli Akbar was born on February 28, 1896, in Tehran. His family was Azerbaijani and Shiite. His father, Ali Naqi Khan Kangerlu (son of Khan Mohammad Khan), was among the first Iranian officers of the Persian Cossack Brigade. He was born in 1863 in the village of Khaneqah Sorkh near Urmia, and he passed away in Tehran in 1903, where he was buried in Imamzadeh Masoom fa. Ali Akbar's grandfather, Reza Qolikhan, migrated from the Nakhchivan region to the south of the Aras River in 1828, following the Turkmancha treaty between the governments of Iran and Russia. Many people and tribal leaders unwilling to accept Russian citizenship did the same. Ali Akbar attended high school at the Cossack Brigade military school in Tehran. At the age of 18, he entered the Gendarmerie officer school and was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant. During his service in the gendarmerie, he was assigned to the 6th regiment of Lorestan. After participating in intense fighting to ensure regional order, he was reassigned to Isfahan with the 6th regiment. Later, he joined the National Defense Committee with this regiment in Sultanabad. He participated in the Bid Sorkh (Red Willow) pass battle between the Iranian forces and the Tsarist Russian army and was awarded medals for bravery in battle.\n\n\n== Cossack Brigade and Uniformed Troops: Gilan Wars ==\nIn 1918, he resigned from the Gendarmerie and joined the Cossack army with the rank of second lieutenant. He served in the Cossack Atriyad in Rasht. Displaying great bravery in the wars with Mirza Kuchik Khan, he quickly rose through the ranks, reaching the rank of colonel within five years. At the age of 26 he was appointed as the commander of the Gilan brigade, one of the largest units in Iran's army. During this time, he was directly involved in fierce battles between the Iranian military and the Russian Bolshevik forces, who had invaded Gilan and occupied various areas, including the cities of Rasht, Bandar Anzali, and Astara. Afterward, he became the head of the Mazandaran military. His diary detailing the Gilan wars serves as a valuable source for historians. In these notes, General Derakhshani clearly wrote that while the people of Gilan fully supported Mirza Kuchik Khan against the government forces, they sincerely supported the soldiers of the Iranian government in the war with the Bolsheviks.\n\n\n== Urmia: Command of the Sepahban Regiment and Forces of Three Provinces ==\nOn October 21, 1933, Ali Akbar Derakhshani was appointed as the commander of the newly established Sepahban regiment in his father's hometown, Urmia. This regiment had the crucial task of safeguarding the northwestern border areas of the country. Shortly after, he was entrusted with the command of the forces of three provinces - Urumieh, Khoy, and Salmas, which included the Layamout (Deathless) Cavalry Regiment. This marked the beginning of his extensive missions in the western regions of Iran.\n\nThe people of Urmia and its surroundings had endured many hardships due to foreign occupation, prolonged bloody clashes among nomadic groups and sectarian conflicts, which resulted in murder, plunder, and insecurity. The city and its neighboring villages were left in semi-ruinous conditions. Two infantry companies and a machine gun company of the Sepahban regiment were housed in dilapidated buildings without basic amenities like toilets, forcing soldiers to relieve themselves in nearby alleys. Derakhshani worked tirelessly to address various shortcomings. Additionally, since other government offices were not fully established yet, he also focused on improving the living conditions of the people.\nWithin a few months, conditions for the residents began to improve. However, the soldiers' living conditions remained dire, with irregular and delayed delivery of salaries, rations, and clothing. The government lacked the funds to build barracks, leaving only the remnants of Russian barracks which locals had scavenged to repair their own homes. Derakhshani, with the cooperation of local commissions and support from residents, embarked on rebuilding a new barracks on the ruins, with Ayatollah Arab Baghi, the religious authority of West Azerbaijan, encouraged the reconstruction effort. Without central government funding, Derakhshani mobilized residents to construct a thirty-meter avenue followed by additional squares and streets.\nHis other initiatives included establishing a telephone line between Urmia, Salmas, and Khoy, utilizing leftover wires from the Russian army, and recruiting builders and carpenters from Tabriz to expedite city reconstruction efforts.\n\n\n== Campaign in the West ==\nOn November 5, 1924, Ali Akbar Derakhshani was appointed to lead the advance forces, composed of the Sepahban regiment and tribal forces, of a 4000-man military expedition to disarm nomads and restore order in the western regions of Iran. He spent twenty months and twenty-two days on this challenging campaign.\nSoon he assumed command of the expeditions first column, succeeding Brigadier General Abul Hasan Pourzand. General Ahmad Agha Amir Ahmadi served as the Amir of Lashkar-e-Gharb (commander of the Western Army) during this time. Serious differences arose between Pourzand and Derakhshani regarding the strategy and management of the force from the outset.\nThe initial campaign objective was to assert control over Gholamreza Khan Abu Qadareh, the governor of Pushtkooh, who had defied central government authority. The campaign successfully did this and also disarmed tribes and nomadic groups in Pushtkooh, Kabirkooh, and other areas of Lorestan, as well as Kurdish regions surrounding Kermanshah, collecting over five thousand rifles from various clans— a significant step towards establishing security in the western region.\nThe campaign and 20-month march was marked by severe hardships, including hunger, thirst, and extreme weather conditions. Some troops resorted to consuming only dry corn kernels to stave off hunger, resulting in fatalities due to starvation and dehydration. The force lost all its 1000 camels due to lack of fodder and harsh weather, and two hundred horses and mules perished during a short period in the very high temperatures of Mansurabad region. Despite these challenges, the officers and men remained steadfast in their duties, and succeeded in achieving their objectives.\nDuring this period, Derakhshani had only one five-day leave, during which he visited Shiite holy sites\nAl-Atabat Al-Aliyat in Iraq with permission from Reza Shah, crossing the border without identification and in civilian attire. Upon returning to Urmia (now Rezaieh) in 1926, the Sepahban regiment received a warm welcome from the local population.\nDuring the subsequent four years in Urmia (which was recently renamed to Rezaieh), Derakhshani undertook various construction projects and completed ongoing works, including establishing the Red Lion and Sun Society. With a small symbolic initial funding from Ayatollah Mujtahid Arab Baghi, he established the first Iranian hospital in the region, providing medical care and services previously offered only by American religious missions. The hospital's establishment garnered support from the local populace, prompting increased donations to the Red Lion and Sun Society.\nFollowing the death of the regional brigade commander, Derakhshani assumed command of the brigade while retaining his previous position.\n\n\n== Lorestan and Ilam ==\nOn June 30, 1930, during a meeting at Saad Abad Palace, Reza Shah expressed concern over the prolonged unrest in Lorestan, despite 12 years of government military efforts, particularly in the Kabirkooh region, which posed a threat to the connectivity of Khuzestan Province with the rest of the country. He appointed Ali Akbar Derakhshani to resolve the situation swiftly, granting him the authority to receive direct orders from the Shah for crucial matters. Derakhshani assumed the role of military governor of Kabirkooh and Abdanan, replacing Brigadier Mohammad Ali Behzadi.\nDespite being placed under the command of the Brigadier General Abul Hasan Pourzand, conflicts between Porzand and Derakhshani persisted, leading to Pourzand's dismissal on August 2 of the same year by the order of Reza Shah. Derakhshani assumed control of the Pushtkooh government while retaining his previous position, effectively taking on the responsibilities of two brigadier generals while still a colonel.\nDerakhshani successfully quelled the unrest in Lorestan and persuaded non-compliant tribes in Pushtkooh to submit to the Iranian government. He implemented widespread disarmament, resettled nomadic populations, established comprehensive regulations, government departments, and enforced public conscription laws and other national statutes in the border region.\nWith Reza Shah's approval, Derakhshani oversaw infrastructure projects connecting the region to other parts of the country, including the construction of the first asphalt road and tunnel. He transformed Hossein Abad, the former center of Pushtkooh governors, into a city renamed Ilam and also renamed Mansourabad as Mehran Both actions were at the suggestion of Derakhshani to Reza Shah which met with the Shah's approval.\nUnder Derakhshani's leadership, the region also saw significant progress in education, with the opening of several primary schools, the first such schools in the region. The improved security situation prompted the return of many Pushtkoohi immigrant families from Iraq, leading to tensions between Iran and Iraq due to depopulation of eastern Iraqi villages.\nDespite his achievements, Derakhshani was eventually relieved of his duties, and Brigadier Porzand was reinstated in his place. Attempts of to prosecute Derakhshani were unsuccessful. His tenure in the Ilam region lasted six years and three months.\n\n\n== Private Royal Estates ==\nIn 1940, Ali Akbar Derakhshani assumed the role of head of Private Royal Estates Inspectorate. However, his tenure was short-lived due to his vocal opposition to the practices of the royal estates, including his objection to forced labor, which he expressed directly to Reza Shah. Consequently, he was dismissed from his position after just two months.\nIn a letter dated February 16, 1941, Hossein Shokooh, head of Reza Shah's Special Office, conveyed a warning on behalf of the Shah regarding Derakhshani's criticism of forced and unpaid labor within the imperial estates. Derakhshani was instructed to explain his objections and provide his opinion on the perceived harm caused by these practices. Subsequently, he was demoted to head of the inspectorate of the royal properties in Gorgan, Aliabad, and Gonbad-e Kavus, as well as assuming the governorship of Gorgan.\nHowever, Derakhshani's tenure in this new role was also short-lived. In response to a telegram from Reza Shah's Special Office regarding sending wheat from Gorgan to Tehran, Derakhshani stated that the daily bread supply of the people of Gorgan was supplied with difficulty and there was no surplus wheat to send to Tehran. On the very same day he was removed as governor by the Minister of Interior and was also relieved of his duties at the Inspectorate.\nAs a result of these bold actions, Derakhshani fell out of favor with Reza Shah and was sidelined from any further positions during Reza Shah's remaining rule. Derakhshani's notes provide valuable first-hand historical insights into the functioning of the Royal Estates during this time.\n\n\n== West Azerbaijan Governorate ==\nAfter more than two years of waiting for service, Ali Akbar Derakhshani was appointed as the deputy commander of the 3rd Azerbaijan Division on June 1, 1943. However, his tenure in this position was brief.\nAmid rising insecurity in Rezaieh and the surrounding areas, exacerbated by clashes among clans and the encroachment of Soviet forces, Major General Razm Ara, Chief of Army Staff, deemed the situation disgraceful and politically significant. He selected Derakhshani to address the unrest. Consequently, on July 17 of the same year, Derakhshani was appointed as the commander of the brigade and gendarmerie of West Azerbaijan, as well as the governor of the province.\nDerakhshani swiftly restored order in Rezaieh and its vicinity. However, 120 remote villages remained under the control of Kurdish clan leaders due to the previous withdrawal of the gendarmerie and the absence of any government presence. Derakhshani resolved to rectify this by reinstating gendarmerie posts along the Rezaieh-Mahabad road and in surrounding areas. He accompanied the troops in doing so and gradually extended government authority and quelled unrest both by a show of force and through negotiations with the tribes.\nIn early September, Derakhshani shifted his focus to areas like Khoi and Maku, where looting and violence persisted and had left several gendarmes dead and wounded. After assessing the situation and deploying troops with government, he successfully reestablished order and government authority in these regions.\nIn October, Derakhshani presented a report to Mohammad Reza Shah at Marmar Palace, where the Shah expressed gratitude for his efforts. On October 26, 1943, Derakhshani was awarded a military medal personally by the Shah and, less than a week later, was promoted to the command of the Azerbaijan military forces in both East and West Azerbaijan provinces, despite still holding the rank of colonel.\n\n\n== Command of the 3rd Division of Azerbaijan and the Government of Pishevari ==\nUpon his appointment as the commander of the 3rd Azerbaijan Division on June 1, 1943, Ali Akbar Derakhshani faced challenges due to the Soviet Army's occupation of Azerbaijan. Soviet troops had forcibly removed the army's previous commander, Brigadier General Khosravani, from Tabriz. Despite encountering verbal abuse and insults to himself and Iranian authorities from Soviet commanders, Derakhshani actively monitored the situation in various cities of Azerbaijan by visiting several towns and barracks, which drew criticism from Soviet generals and the Tudeh Party. For a long time, previous commanders had not set foot outside of Tabriz for fear of upsetting the Soviets. His actions in Azerbaijan led to his promotion to General and he was awarded another top medal, this time of the first rank of the first order.\nGeneral Derakhshani's resistance and actions so annoyed regional Soviet political leaders and commanders that on November 23, 1945 the top leader of Soviet Azerbaijan, Mir Jafar Baghirov, and the military commander of the Caucasus region, General Maslennikov, jointly sent a letter addressed to Stalin, Molotov, Beria, and Malenkov, complaining of General Derakhshani by name and stating that his actions could cause serious complications and disruptions in Soviet plans.\nIn December 1945, Soviet forces surrounded the Tabriz barracks, restricting the movement of Iranian army personnel. Not even one Iranian truck was allowed by the Soviets to leave the Tabriz barracks. Amid conflicting and impractical orders from the army headquarters, the army found itself unable to resist effectively. Chief of Staff Major General Arfa's last order instructed the Division commander to resist the uprising and, if resistance proved impossible, to relocate to Tehran. The determination was to be made by the council of the officers of the Tabriz barracks\nOn December 13, 1945, upon the approval of the council of officers and following the occupation of Tabriz by Soviet and Democratic Party forces, the Tabriz barracks laid down its arms. After the last of the officers had arrived in Tehran, General Derakhshani left Tabriz and returned to the capital. Upon his arrival, he was arrested and subjected to interrogation, leading to a prolonged investigation and trial that culminated in a ruling by the Court of Appeal on March 11, 1948.\n\n\n== Military Court and Conviction ==\nAli Akbar Derakhshani's trial was presided over by Major General Abul Hasan Pourzand initially, and later by Major General Mahmoud Khosropanah fa. The appeal court was headed by Major General Iraj Matbouie fa. The military prosecution was initially led by Brigadier General Amir Nezami, succeeded by Brigadier General Abdul Ali Etemad Mogghadam, although Colonel Hossein Azmoudah practically handled all the prosecution.\nThe selection of court officials was influenced by various factors. Major General Pourzand, known for his longstanding animosity towards Derakhshani dating back to the Lorestan wars, openly expressed bias against him. Despite being expected to remain neutral, Pourzand engaged in polemics against Derakhshani even before his appointment as head of the court. Major General Khosropanah, appointed after Pourzand's death, was close to Major General Arfa, adding to concerns about impartiality of the court.\nMajor General Matbouie, appointed head of the second court, had a controversial past, having commanded the Mashhad army during the Goharshad mosque uprising, leading to his subsequent execution after the Revolution of 1979. He was also severely criticized for his actions during the occupation of Azerbaijan in 1941 and for abandoning his post as the commander of the military there.\nColonel Azmoudeh, despite lacking legal expertise, was appointed as deputy prosecutor due to his trustworthiness to Arfa and his associates. He later gained notoriety for his role in trials and executions following the 1953 coup against Prime Minister Mossadegh, earning nicknames like \"Eichmann\" and \"Dracula of Iran.\"\nDespite efforts to convict Derakhshani for political reasons, he was acquitted of charges related to surrendering weapons and provisions and refusing to resist the Democratic Sect. The government's policy, clearly articulated by Prime Minister Ebrahim Hakimi and Minister of War Major General Ali Riazi fa in Parliament, was refrain from bloodshed in Azerbaijan and avoidance of confrontation the Soviet-backed uprising while the Soviet army was still in the province.\nDespite being found guilty on only two charges, i.e. entering into a contract with Pishevari and continuing command, the legal validity of these convictions was widely questioned. The alleged contract was never presented in court and the original has not been seen to this day, and the charge of continuing command was retroactively applied after General Derakhshani was already under arrest for several weeks.\nUltimately, Derakhshani was sentenced to life imprisonment by the trial court, later reduced to 15 years on appeal. He served two years and ten months before being released. The idea that he capitulated to the Democratic Sect is erroneous, given the acquittals on four charges and questionable convictions on two charges in his case.\n\n\n== Arrest by SAVAK and Death ==\nIn the twilight of Mohammad Reza Shah's reign, Ali Akbar Derakhshani was known as an opponent of the regime and was closely monitored by the authorities. On the night of March 27, 1978, SAVAK agents raided his home, alleging espionage for the Soviet Union, although the veracity of these charges remains questionable. He subsequently died in Evin Prison.\nThe circumstances surrounding Derakhshani's arrest and death, coupled with conflicting reports, cast doubt on the accusations leveled against him by SAVAK. At eighty-two years old and with failing eyesight, Derakhshani had been a vocal critic of the government for many years. Despite enduring imprisonment and being sidelined from positions of power for over three decades after leaving the army, he remained under surveillance by SAVAK. Given his physical limitations and social isolation, he was unlikely to have been a viable intelligence asset for the Soviet Union.\nDerakhshani's public opposition to the government made him a convenient target for security agencies' propaganda. His arrest coincided with the Iranian revolution's critical juncture, as the regime sought to suppress dissent and warn of foreign powers interfering in Iran's affairs to instigate unrest. However, the timing of his arrest, following the Tabriz uprising and amidst preparations for demonstrations commemorating the event, raises suspicions about the government's motives.\nDuring the eighteen days of government propaganda surrounding Derakhshani's arrest, details provided by the government controlled broadcast and print media were inconsistent and sensationalized, including allegations of receiving a pension from the Soviet Union and confessing under interrogation. The shifting narrative, from his arrest in the street to inside his home, reflects the propaganda's chaotic nature. Subsequent investigations revealed that Derakhshani had died shortly after his arrest, casting doubt on the authenticity of the interrogation narrative altogether.\nMoreover, SAVAK failed to provide legal evidence to judicial authorities regarding the grounds for Derakhshani's arrest and death, leaving the accusations vague and dubious. Despite his burial in the family mausoleum in Ibn Babuyeh Cemetery in Ray, the circumstances of his arrest and death remain shrouded in uncertainty.\nDerakhshani's memoirs, published posthumously in Iran and the United States, offer insights into his life and opposition to the regime, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of his legacy.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Stromness Lifeboat Station is located in the harbour town of Stromness, the second largest town of Mainland, Orkney, in the isles of Orkney, Scotland.\nA lifeboat was first stationed here by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) in 1867.\nSince 1998, the station has operated a Severn-class All-weather lifeboat, 17-16 Violet, Dorothy and Kathleen (ON 1236).\n\n\n== History ==\nOn 1 January 1866, the Albion was wrecked on Graemsay, one of the Orkney Islands island. Fortunately 90 people survived, but 10 lives were lost. Following this event, a request was made to the RNLI to open a lifeboat station in the area, and after a visit by their Inspector of Lifeboats, this was agreed. At the time, Stromness would be the most northerly of all the RNLI stations.\nA boathouse was constructed at The Ness by Robertson & Smith, costing £144-19s-6d,  An order for a 33-foot 10-oared self-righting lifeboat at £280 was placed with Forrestt of Limehouse, London, and a launch-carriage cost a further £98-10s-0d. Transported to Stromness free of charge by the 'Aberdeen Steam Navigation company', and 'Edinburgh, Leith and Clyde Shipping company'. The boat arrived in Stromness in the summer of 1867. The lifeboat was provided out of a gift from Bradford manufacturer and philanthropist Titus Salt, and was duly named Saltaire after his model village near Shipley in Yorkshire.\n\nAn RNLI inspection in 1890 proved that The Ness was a difficult location to launch the boat. At a practice launch into a gale, it took over an hour to get the boat afloat. Whilst conditions still weren't perfect at Stromness, it was recommended that the boat be relocated to Stromness harbour and remain afloat. A new 42-foot 12-oared Self-righting lifeboat was ordered from McAlister of Dumbarton, funded by the Loyal Order of Ancient Shepherds (Ashton Order) Friendly Society, and named Good Shepherd at a ceremony in Greenock on 16 May 1891. The boat arrived in Stromness on 15 June 1891.\nWork began in 1900 on the construction of a new boathouse with roller slipway at Stromness harbour. Costing £1250, the boathouse was completed in 1902.\nRNLI trials of motor-powered lifeboats began in the early 1900s, using modified Pulling and Sailing lifeboats (lifeboats with oars and sails). In 1907, the RNLI placed an order with Thames Ironworks for four new purpose-built motor-powered lifeboats. The first of these was the £2,995 42-foot self-righting John A. Hay (ON 591), with a 30 hp petrol engine, providing 6.5 knots, funded from the legacy of Mr John Alexander Hay of Cheltenham. Setting out from London Docks on 15 April 1909, along with a similar boat for Stromsay, she covered the 768 in 15 days, arriving in Stromness on 30 April.\nOn 15 June 1916, the HMS Hampshire struck a mine off Marwick Head, just 12 north of Stromness, and sank with the loss of 737 lives, including that of Field Marshal Horatio Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener. There were only 12 survivors. There is speculation whether it would have made any difference given the conditions, but the lifeboat was never called out.\n\nMelville, Dundas and Whitsun, of Glasgow started construction of a replacement boathouse and roller-slipway in 1925, on the site of the previous boathouse. Costing £10,660, it was completed in 1926. However, when a new lifeboat was due for Stromness two years later, it was proposed that they receive a 60-foot Barnett-class lifeboat, which would need to be kept afloat due to the size.\nHonorary Secretary at Stromness, Mr George Thompson, travelled to London to meet RNLI 'Naval Architect' James Rennie Barnett, and the result was the 51-foot Barnett (Stromness-class) lifeboat, suitable for slipway launches from a boathouse. As it turned out, the new Stromness lifeboat, J.J.K.S.W. (ON 702), would be the only one housed.\nStromness Lifeboat performed an exceptional service in 1930, but without a good outcome. On 28 March 1930, in gale conditions, the Aberdeen trawler Ben Doran was wrecked on Ve Skerries, near Papa Stour, on the west side of Shetland. Despite recent moves to locate a lifeboat in Lerwick, there were no lifeboats based in Shetland. After all other rescue attempts failed, the Stromness lifeboat, being the nearest, was launched at 4:30pm on 30 March. In very poor conditions, the lifeboat first sailed to Scalloway as a staging point for food and a refuel, arriving at 7:30 am on the 31 March, before heading around Shetland with a local Pilot, to Ve Skerries. All that was found was the wreck, and no survivors. The lifeboat headed back to Scalloway, before commencing the 16½ hour journey back to Stromness, arrriving at 11:00pm on 1 April. J.J.K.S.W. (ON 702) had been away for 55 hours, and travelled 320 miles.\nIn 1998, Stromness received their latest lifeboat. A Severn-class lifeboat, the largest type of the RNLI fleet, fitted with twin Caterpillar 3412 1200 bhp marine diesel engines, providing a top speed of 25 knots, and cost £1,580,000. Funded from the estate of the late Miss Violet Matton of Seaford, East Sussex, and the wills of her two sisters, Dorothy and Kathleen, she was named 17-16 Violet, Dorothy and Kathleen (ON 1236).\n\n\n== Station honours ==\nThe following are awards made at Stromness\n\nRNLI Silver Medal\nRobert Leask Jnr, Farmer - 1873\nRobert Greig, Coxswain - 1908\nRNLI Bronze Medal\nWilliam Johnston, Coxswain - 1922\nWilliam Johnston, Coxswain - 1929 (Second-Service Clasp)\nThe Thanks of the Institution inscribed on Vellum\nThe son of Robert Leask Jnr - 1873\nWilliam Sinclair, Coxswain - 1953\nJohn Banks, Coxswain - 2002\nA Collective Letter of Thanks signed by the Chairman of the Institution\nJames Flett, Coxswain - 1992\nJohn Banks, Second Coxswain - 1992\nRonald Taylor, Mechanic - 1992\nJames Adam, Assistant Mechanic - 1992\nDouglas Adam, crew member - 1992\nWilliam Wilson, crew member - 1992\nRobert Craigie, crew member - 1992\nLetter of appreciation from the Danish Government\nStromness Lifeboat Crew - 1939\nMember, Order of the British Empire (MBE)\nGeorge Linklater Thomson - 1941\n\n\n== Stromness lifeboats ==\n\n\n=== All-weather lifeboats ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of RNLI stations\nList of former RNLI stations\nRoyal National Lifeboat Institution\nRoyal National Lifeboat Institution lifeboats\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRNLI station information",

        "content": "Carlos Gil Pérez (28 January 1931 – 25 December 2009) was a Spanish athletics coach. From 1979 to 1988, he was Spain's top national coach, serving as the technical director of the Royal Spanish Athletics Federation (RFEA). He has been called one of the \"fathers of Spanish athletics\".\n\n\n== Life ==\nPérez was born in Santiago de Compostela, Spain on 28 January 1931. From 1979 to 1988, he held the position of technical director of the Royal Spanish Athletics Federation (RFEA). Under his leadership, Spanish athletics achieved its first Olympic medals at the Moscow Olympics in 1980 and in Los Angeles in 1984.\nAt the 1982 European Athletics Indoor Championships in Athens, Spain achieved one of its great milestones by winning five medals. Three years later, in Budapest, Spain rose to the highest category of continental athletics.\nPérez also made significant contributions in sports administration. Within the RFEA, he revamped the technical infrastructure by introducing experienced coaches, thereby fostering sport development. Additionally, he played a pivotal role in initiating athlete support programs, including the creation of ADO scholarships. These scholarships provided financial assistance, offering 80,000 pesetas over four years to athletes with the potential to excel in Olympic Games and top-level championships.\nReturning to his hometown, Perez coached the first Salamanca-born national champion in any sport in 1958; under his guidance, José Luis Albarrán claimed the title of Spanish champion in the 200 meters at the old Anoeta Stadium in San Sebastián.\nIn Salamanca, he trained dozens of athletes under his guidance from 1955 to 2009, with notable mentions including his five Olympic athletes: José Luis Albarrán, José Luis Sánchez Paraíso, Rosa Colorado, Antonio Sánchez, and Frutos Feo. They also achieved numerous Spanish records.\nIn 1968, he received a Silver Medal of the Royal Order of Sports Merit in Salamanca from Juan Antonio Samaranch. In 2007, he received the Silver Medal again from King Juan Carlos I. In 2010, he received the Gold Medal posthumously.\nPérez was frequently seen at the Helmántico Stadium in Salamanca, coaching athletes even at over 70 years old. In his later years, he worked with athletes like Adrián Ingelmo, Ángel García, Saturnino González, David Berrocal, Pedro Ceballos, and Elvis González, among others.\nPerez died on 25 December 2009 in Salamanca.\n\n\n== Sexual misconduct allegations ==\nOn 7 May 2024, a 57-year-old former discus thrower, under a pseudonym, claimed that Pérez sexually abused him when he was 17 years old. Three other people came forth with similar allegations published in the newspaper El País.\n\n\n== Works ==\n— (1974).

        "content": "Conquering Lion is the debut album by Jamaican musician Yabby You (Vivian Jackson) and his backing group The Prophets. It was released in 1975 on Jackson's label Prophets. In the UK the album was released in 1975 under the title Ramadam or Ram-A-Dam, and had a different track listing.\n\n\n== Background and release ==\nYabby You is the moniker of Vivian Jackson, born in Kingston in 1946. He initially formed a vocal trio with Alaric Forbes and Bobby Melody to record the song \"Conquering Lion\", which was released as a single in 1972, attributed to Vivian Jackson & the Ralph Brothers.\nThe song begins with a refrain of \"be you, yabby yabby you\", which Jackson heard sung by angelic voices during a thunderstorm. \nJackson's nickname \"Yabby You\" comes from the song, and was popularised by King Tubby.\nThe track \"Love Thy Neighbour\" was also released a single around the same time, attributed to Vivian Jackson & the Deffenders  [sic]. Both singles sold well enough that Jackson was able to start his own label, Prophets, in 1974. The album Conquering Lion is mostly composed of singles that Jackson released on that label. It was released in 1975 on Jackson's label.\nIn 2021 Pressure Sounds reissued the album on CD and LP, with 12 bonus tracks of dub versions.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nNathan Bush of AllMusic rated Conquering Lion 5/5 stars, indicating their opinion that the album has \"stood the test of time and has become an important and very meaningful recording within its genre.\" Writing for The Guardian, David Katz called the album \"stunningly intense\".\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nVersions of title track \"Conquering Lion\" were recorded by Big Youth (\"Yabby Youth\"), Augustus Pablo (\"False Dread\"), Dicky Burton (\"God Is Watching You\"), and Horace Andy (\"Undivided World\").\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\nAll additional tracks from the Expanded Edition are written by Yabby You & King Tubby, except where noted.\n\nThe first UK release of the album was called Ram-A-Dam and had a different track listing.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nThe Prophets\n\nVivian Jackson – lead vocals, arrangements, writing, production\nAlaric Forbes – vocals\nBobby Melody – vocals\nOther credits\n\nLeroy Wallace (Horse Head) – drums\nTommy McCook – flute\nEarl \"Chinna\" Smith, Earl Lindo – guitar\nAston Barrett – organ\nBingy Bunny – percussion\nAugustus Pablo, Pablo Black – piano\nDirty Harry – saxophone\nDon D.

        "content": "Premia Spine TOPS System is an FDA-approved mechanical medical device that serves as an alternative to lumbar interbody fusion surgery after decompression. It is developed by Premia Spine. \nThe TOPS System offers new methods for the non-fusion treatment of degenerative spondylolisthesis and spinal stenosis. \n\n\n== Method ==\nPremia Spine developed the TOPS System and initiated a pivotal US trial to compare it with the traditional transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) procedure. Results showed that the TOPS System offers significant clinical, health, and societal benefits over TLIF. Under the Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) study by the FDA, the system was available to a limited number of U.S. patients at select hospitals and institutions.\nIn March 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted a “breakthrough device designation” (FDA’s initiative for medical devices that significantly improve treatment of severe or debilitating conditions) to the TOPS System. \nIn 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the TOPS System as an implant designed to stabilize the lower spine and maintain the range of motion after surgery to relieve compressed nerves (lumbar decompression surgery).\n\n\n== Surgical procedure ==\nThe TOPS System is a unitary implant composed of two titanium plates connected by an interlocking flexible articulating core.  It has metal arms connecting horizontally to pedicles with four polyaxial screws. The device can be implanted after a standard decompression by removing the lamina and medial facets in a \"posterior arthroplasty\" procedure. The TOPS System replaces the bony and soft tissue removed during spinal decompression surgery and implants them at the affected spine segment to aid the patient's flexibility.\n\n\n== Uses ==\nIt treats patients diagnosed with common degenerative spinal diseases such as lumbar spinal stenosis, which occurs when the small joints between the vertebrae compress the spinal nerve roots in the lower back and Grade 1 spondylolisthesis occurs when one vertebra \"slips\" over the one below it. One of the differences between the TOPS System and traditional fusion surgery is that the TOPS device allows the patient physical stability and a greater range of movement in all directions.\nThe TOPS System treats spinal stenosis, spondylolisthesis, and other facet joint conditions by stabilizing the lumbar spine and allowing controlled movement. Post-surgery, patients regain the ability to bend, flex, and walk, enjoying immediate and lasting pain relief.\n\n\n== Clinical trials ==\nStudies highlighted its ability to preserve spine biomechanics, measuring effects on disc strain and bulge. Pain and quality of life improvements were quantitatively assessed using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and Short Form 36 (SF-36). X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs were used to monitor the implant for adverse events or changes.\nA 2012 study presented in Barcelona found that one in four elderly patients who had lumbar spinal fusion for lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) or spondylolisthesis needed a second spinal surgery within two years. Additionally, nearly half of these patients were readmitted to the hospital due to complications. Comparatively, Premia Spine's follow-ups over five years in Belgium and Israel suggest that the TOPS System yields significantly better outcomes, with a preoperative complication rate under five percent.\nIn March 2021, Premia Spine received FDA breakthrough device designation for its Tops facet arthroplasty system.\nIn July 2021, Jared Ament presented the clinical and economic evidence supporting the TOPS facet arthroplasty system at the Spine Summit, San Diego, demonstrating its cost-effectiveness compared to TLIF for treating spondylolisthesis and spinal stenosis. \nIn November 2021, its intermediate clinical study results, presented at the Society for Minimally Invasive Spine Surgery (SMISS) supported the use of the TOPS System for lumbar spinal stenosis and degenerative spondylolisthesis. \nIn June 2022, a study published in the Journal of Health Economics and Outcomes Research demonstrated that the TOPS System offers significant health and societal benefits compared to TLIF in treating degenerative spondylolisthesis and stenosis.\nIn September 2022, the journal Operative Neurosurgery published a single-center study evaluating its TOPS System for lumbar spinal stenosis and degenerative spondylolisthesis.  The paper \"Mobility-Maintaining Arthroplasty of the Lumbar Spine with the Second-Generation TOPS System\" by Werner Lack, Hans Paul Kutschera, and Josef Krugluge found that the TOPS facet replacement can relieve leg and back pain while maintaining nearly normal range-of-motion for four years without causing adjacent segment disease. The study also noted that the TOPS System uniquely helps patients maintain natural sagittal balance, offering new options for non-fusion treatment of degenerative spondylolisthesis and spinal stenosis.\n\n\n=== FDA Approval Study ===\nPremia Spine received FDA approval to start an IDE trial of the TOPS System with 300 to 500 patients across up to 40 U.S. centers, randomizing participants into TOPS (67%) or fusion (33%) arms. The trial aims to compare the efficacy of TOPS versus TLIF in stabilizing one lumbar level (L2-L5) after decompression in patients with moderate lumbar spinal stenosis and Grade 1 spondylolisthesis, including conditions like thickened ligamentum flavum or scarred facet joints.\nIn September 2022, Dr. Dom Coric and colleagues published a study in the Journal of Neurosurgery Spine, which demonstrated that the TOPS System, a motion-preserving treatment for lumbar stenosis with degenerative spondylolisthesis, outperformed TLIF in clinical success rates.\nIn its approval report, the FDA noted that a clinical study involving 115 patients treated with the TOPS System showed a 76.7% success rate at the 24-month follow-up.\n\n\n== References ==",

The fund has already attracted investments from the EBRD, Swiss Investment Fund for Emerging Markets, Black Sea Trade and Development Bank, and other investors.\nDragon Capital New Ukraine Fund was established in November 2015. Its anchor investors are Dragon Capital and the Ukrainian Redevelopment Fund, which is managed by Soros Fund Management.\nIn 2017–2019, it acquired a number of different commercial properties in Lviv, Vinnytsia), Zaporizhia, Kyiv, and near Kyiv.\nIn 2019, the company acquired a minority stake in Ciklum (IT company).

        "content": "Wilkiea cordata is a species of flowering plant in the family Monimiaceae, and is endemic to north-east Queensland. It is a shrub or small tree with oblong leaves, male and female flowers on separate plants, male flowers with stamens in 2 pairs, female flowers with about 25 carpels, and the fruit is an oval drupe with a yellow receptacle with an orange tinge.\n\n\n== Description ==\nWilkiea cordata is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1–4 m (3 ft 3 in – 13 ft 1 in). Its leaves are oblong, 110–260 mm (4.3–10.2 in) long and 30–90 mm (1.2–3.5 in) wide on a petiole 2–5 mm (0.079–0.197 in) long. The base of the leaves is heart-shaped to almost stem-clasping, the edges sometimes serrated and the midrib is prominent on both surfaces. Male and female flowers are borne on separate plants. Male flowers are borne in leaf axils sometimes in clusters of up to 3, 10–15 mm (0.39–0.59 in) long, with 6 tepals, the individual flowers on a pedicel 4–8 mm (0.16–0.31 in) long, with stamens in 2 pairs. Female flowers are usually borne singly in leaf axils, or on the ends of branchlets, the flowers more or less spherical, 3–4 mm (0.12–0.16 in) long and 4–5 mm (0.16–0.20 in) in diameter, on a pedicel 5–15 mm (0.20–0.59 in) long, with about 25 carpels. Flowering occurs from January to March and the fruit is a purplish-black or black drupe, 12–15 mm (0.47–0.59 in) long and 10–12 mm (0.39–0.47 in) wide, with a yellow fruiting receptacle tinged with orange.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nWilkiea cordata was first formally described in 2007 by Trevor Paul Whiffin in Flora of Australia, from specimens collected on Mount Haig.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nThis species of Wilkiea grows in the understorey of rainforest at altitudes from 100 to 1,250 m (330 to 4,100 ft) from the ranges near the Atherton Tableland.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Kazys Ališauskas (29 March 1898 – 16 January 1979) was a Lithuanian military officer and historian.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life military career ===\nKazys Ališauskas was born on 29 March 1898 in the village of Meškučiai in Congress Poland of the Russian Empire. He graduated from the local Marijampolė Gymnasium. When the Lithuanian Wars of Independence broke out, Ališauskas joined the Lithuanian army as a volunteer in 1919, graduating from the War School of Kaunas on 6 July 1919. After receiving the rank of karūžas (the lowest officer rank; replaced later by Lieutenant), Ališauskas was assigned to the 2nd Infantry Regiment. He fought against the Red Army, Bermontian, and Polish forces. For courage displayed while fighting the Bermontians, he was awarded the Order of the Cross of Vytis, 1st degree. On 3 April 1923 he was promoted to Senior Lieutenant. After completing the Higher Officers' Courses in 1926, Ališauskas was promoted to captain.\n\n\n=== First publications ===\nThe Lithuanian Society for Military Sciences, which was established in 1923, acted as a good intellectual environment for Ališauskas to publish his first historical texts and to chronicle the history of the 2nd Infantry Regiment. He published two reviews outlining the basic facts of the creation of the regiment. In 1928 he published a review on the Battle of Giedraičiai, a battle in which the regiment fought, and which became one of the most commemorated battles in interwar Lithuania. Stasys Raštikis notes that Ališauskas assisted Kazys Ladiga in writing the official history of the Lithuanian Wars of Independence, although the work was not realized in interwar Lithuania. He also graduated from the Vytautas Magnus University Faculty of Law. In 1933 he graduated from the Higher Officers' Courses signal unit, and a year later graduated from machine gun courses. On 23 November 1934 he was promoted to Mayor. On 23 November 1939, he was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel.\n\n\n=== Immigration and career in the United States ===\nAfter the start of the Second World War, Ališauskas stayed in Lithuania. After the Soviet occupation of Lithuania, Ališauskas was appointed the commandant of the Raseiniai district, later serving as the officer of special affairs for the General Staff of the Lithuanian army. On 11 September 1940 Ališauskas began his service in the Red Army's Military School of Vilnius. In 1944 he and his family moved to Germany. From 1949 they lived in Chicago. Throughout his publishing career, Ališauskas worked full-time at a factory during his stay in the United States. In the United States, Ališauskas was part of the Ramovė group, a Lithuanian veterans' organization established in 1950 in Chicago. Ališauskas had prepared a historical overview of the Soviet occupation of Moscow, which the Kersten Committee had deemed as a crime committed by the Soviet Union in the context of international law in 1953. Ališauskas's overview became the basis for a similar type of document prepared by the committee. As an émigré, Ališauskas worked on the Lithuanian Boston Encyclopedia's warfare chapter and wrote a book about the Lithuanian Wars of Independence, the latter being commissioned by Ramovė to be done by 1968 by a group of veteran officers. However, internal disagreements and deaths within the group prevented any significant progress on the book, with Ališauskas being the only one who completed a part of the planned book earlier than the deadline and who focused on other fronts while other officers focused exclusively on battles with the Polish. Ališauskas published the book without permission from Ramovė, which got him into conflict with the group that was later resolved. In 1959 Ališauskas received an award as the best author of the magazine Karys. From 1959 to 1972 Ališauskas wrote numerous articles about Lithuanian engagements with the Bermontians, Poles and Bolsheviks. In 1971 he also published an article on the Lithuania National Battalion in Siberia in 1917.\nAlišauskas died on 16 January 1979 in Chicago.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nAlišauskas received the following awards:\n\nOrder of the Cross of Vytis, 1st degree (1920)\nOrder of the Grand Duke Gediminas, 4th degree (1928)\nMedal of Lithuanian Independence (1928)\nLatvian War of Independence 10 Year Anniversary Commemorative Medal (1929)\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n2‑as pėstininkų Didžiojo Lietuvos kunigaikščio Algirdo pulkas kautynėse ties Giedraičiais [The 2nd Lithuanian Grand Duke Algirdas Infantry Regiment's Battle Near Giedraičiai], (1928)\nPirmieji nepriklausomybės kovų žygiai [The First Marches of the Independence Wars], (1939)\nKovos dėl Lietuvos nepriklausomybės, 1918–1920 [The Lithuanian Wars for Independence, 1918–1920], (Vol I; 1972)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Crow Country is a 2024 survival horror game developed and published by SFB Games for Windows, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series. Set in a visual style and design similar to PlayStation 1 horror titles including Resident Evil and Silent Hill, the player is an investigator exploring an abandoned theme park. Upon release, Crow Country received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise directed to the game's design evocation of earlier horror games, and writing and narrative, and mixed views on the implementation of combat and puzzles. \n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nCrow Country is a survival horror game, similar to Resident Evil and Silent Hill, in which players explore Crow Country to find objects, solve puzzles, and defeat monsters. Gameplay features two modes: 'Survival', which features combat and enemies, and 'Exploration', which dispenses with enemies. Combat requires the player to aim and shoot at monsters encountered throughout areas using various weapons, including a handguns, a shotgun, and flamethrower, some of which are unlocked by the completion of optional puzzles. To shoot at enemies, players can run and shoot, or lock into position to focus their aim. Players have limited health depleted by hits from enemies and environmental hazards, which can be replenished using bandages, medkits and antidotes. Items and ammunition are collected by players through interacting with vending machines and containers. Players explore the game's environment and slowly expand their access to new areas by locating keys or solving puzzles, such as by combining items found in different locations.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nSet in the year 1990, the player is Mara Forest, a special agent investigating Crow Country, an abandoned amusement park shut down two years prior in search of its missing founder, Edward Crow, and answers about the circumstances of the closure of the park.  \n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nCrow Country received \"generally favorable\" reviews, according to review aggregator website Metacritic. Reviewers generally praised the game's visual presentation and design as evocative of PS1 horror games. Zoey Handley of Destructoid commended the \"detailed\" pre-rendered environments and \"clever lighting\" to replicate the \"awkward 3D of the era\". However, Leon Hurley of GamesRadar critiqued the player character's \"blocky toy shape\" and \"cartoonish\" enemies. Alice Bell of Rock Paper Shotgun highlighted the game's \"fantastic\" and \"sinister\" setting. Wes Fenlon of PC Gamer highlighted the game's effective jump scares and variety of \"demented monster designs\". \nCritics praised the game's narrative and writing. Sarah Maria Griffin of The Guardian described the game's narrative as complete and richer than anticipated, highlighting the \"levity and playfulness\" of the game's tone and \"bold\" ending. Similarly, Wes Fenlon of PC Gamer praised the \"wry\" writing for its \"cheeky nods to game and horror tropes\". Leon Hurley of GamesRadar noted the \"rewarding\" and \"refreshingly unfamiliar\" story and commended its \"feeling of surprise and uncertainty\". Zoey Handley of Destructoid praised the game's narrative twists and satisfying conclusion, although finding it lacked more distinctive psychological themes. \nReviewers expressed mixed views on the implementation of puzzles and gameplay mechanics. Leon Hurley of GamesRadar considered the game's puzzles to be effective as they were self-contained and balanced in difficulty, although found themselves stuck with some puzzles. Alice Bell of Rock Paper Shotgun praised the design of the puzzles in relying on player observation and intuition, but expressed that the game's combat and survival horror aspects lacked a sense of threat and were easy to manage. Describing the game as \"too easy\", Wes Fenlon of PC Gamer felt the game's combat was simple and did not view the puzzles as memorable. Willa Rowe of Kotaku considered that the enemies, resource management combat felt \"lackluster\" and \"unimportant\", and critiqued the \"inconsistent\" design of simple and in-depth puzzles.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "The Road is a 1965 play by Wole Soyinka, a Nigerian playwright, poet, and director. The play explores the activities at a roadside workshop, known as Aksident Store, where drivers discuss their experiences on the road.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe plot revolves around Samson, a driver's assistant, and Salubi, a young driver without a license, who discuss their work experiences inside the store. Salubi works independently and only accepts individual passengers, while Samson is employed by Kotonu, who operates an unofficial bus converted from a truck. Kotonu and the professor join the conversation. Kotonu, who stopped driving after a serious accident, now works with the professor, who appears more of a religious enthusiast than a businessman, believing he can comfort the spirits of the deceased. He leaves with Kotonu to visit a collision scene.\nThe professor, who is not a clergyman, had previously preached in a church near the shop. Samson explains to Salubi why the professor left following a dispute with the bishop that resulted in a church wall collapsing. Samson convinces Kotonu to admit to helping the professor steal parts from the damaged cars to sell in the shop when he returns from the accident scene.\nAt Aksident Store, where the professor also sells palm wine, several unemployed drivers and assistants gather. These individuals have been united by Say-Tokyo-Kid to form a group that is hired to provide security or incite violence at political events. Particulars Joe, the local police officer, arrives to collect his bribes, and Chief-in-Town, the local politician, stops by to hire the group. Three men enter the shop looking for specific auto parts. When the professor arrives, Samson and Salubi ask him to copy a fake driver's license from Kotonu, who has since stopped driving. The professor initially refuses due to Salubi's disrespectful language but later changes his mind and agrees.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "NGC 5098 are a binary pair of distant galaxies located in Canes Venatici constellation. They are made up of one Type E elliptical galaxy, PGC 46529 or NGC 5098 NED01 located east and one Type ES-0 lenticular galaxy, PGC 46515 or NGC 5098 NED02 located west. Both galaxies are located 559 million light-years away from the Solar System and were discovered on April 29, 1827, by John Herschel.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nNGC 5098 belongs to the NGC 5098 galaxy group which is located some 560 million light-years away. They are the central galaxy pair, first identified by Ramella et al. 1995 \"their group 80.\"  NGC 5098 NED01 is the brighter and larger of the two, showing optical magnitudes of MB = −21.131 and MV = −22.097, as compared to MB = −20.845 and MV = −21.770 for NGC 5098 NED02, which the magnitudes were calculated from Sloan Digital Sky Survey by Adelman-McCarthy and converted to Johnson filter system via the relations provided by Smith et al. \nNGC 5098 NED01 hosts an extended radio source, B2 1317+33 which was detected at several frequencies. A study showed there is evidence of gas swooshing and active galactic nucleus (AGN) heating up which the most likely contributor is the nearby galaxy, NGC 5098 NED02 which is being stripped of its gaseous atmosphere. Significant cavities are present in the central region, which two distinctive bubbles are located north and northeast. They are similar to X-ray observations of other galaxies, groups and clusters. These are formed when active galactic nucleus (AGN) jets push into local ICM, evacuating cavities and creating bright rims of X-ray emission from displaced gas.  \nA plume of emission is seen extending northeast from NGC 5098 NED01, exhibiting a spiral arm morphology which originates east from the galaxy and wrapping around to the north. This presence of a feature indicates NGC 5098 NED01 is indeed interacting with NGC NED02. \nApart from that, there is a sharp surface brightness to west, southwest and south, which is approximately 28 kpc from the central AGN of NGC 5098 NED01. It appears to go eastwards and define the outer boundaries of the arm, adding to the overall impression of the spiral pattern in diffuse emission. The edges are quite similar to features that are seen from cold fronts generated by gas sloshing in observations and stimulations of galaxy clusters and groups. \nA study shows NGC 5098 NED02, does not show any traces of associate emission in X-rays, implying it was stripped of gas. It is possible NGC 5098 NED02 after being ram-pressured stripped and passing east of NGC 5098 NED01 might have circled around it and now moving east, creating a conical wake in diffuse emission.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Lady Willie Forbus (August 24, 1892 – April 27, 1993) was an American politician in the state of Washington. A Democrat, she was a member of the Washington State Senate for the 44th district from 1943 to 1947.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nForbus was born on August 24, 1892, in Zieglerville, Mississippi. Her name came from her father's name, William, with, as was customary for daughters named after their fathers, the addition of \"Lady\". Her father was the manager of several cotton plantations and her mother, Birdie, worked as a music teacher and raised cattle and sold eggs, butter and lard with her six children. As the second eldest, Forbus and her older brother Sample were sent to a larger town, Laurel, for their education when Forbus was fourteen as their mother was determined that they receive a good education. 150 miles away from their hometown, Forbus ran the household on the $25 monthly check sent by their parents, even after their four younger siblings joined them in the two-room house.\nForbus's brothers graduated high school with scholarships to university but the same aid was not available to female students, so Forbus attended the University of Mississippi by working as a stenographer for a local judge. When she had an ear infection her junior year, she was unable to be treated at the university infirmary as a female student and was rendered dead in her left ear. She received her bachelor's degree in 1915. Determined to go to law school, she applied to Columbia, Harvard and Yale but was rejected from each, as none were yet admitting female law students. Instead she attended the University of Michigan as the only female student in their class of 1918. After graduation, she was told by the law school dean, \"Goodbye, Lady Willie, someday you'll make a good stenographer for some lawyer\".\n\n\n== Legal career ==\nForbus believed her legal career would be best placed if she went west and, using her law school's directory, she sent letters to lawyers in Cheyenne, Denver, San Francisco and Seattle asking for a job. Based on a response from a Seattle-based criminal lawyer, Walter Fulton, Forbus moved to Washington in 1918. She was prohibited by state law from practicing in the state prior to spending a year as a law clerk, as she had not graduated from the University of Washington. She opened her own legal practice the following year. Female lawyers were a rarity in Seattle but Forbus would later state that she was treated well and the state was \"freer, more open-minded\".\nIn 1922, Forbus began to receive public attention due to her handling of the murder of the police officer Charles O. Legate. He was found dead in his car in his garage on March 17 and the gunshot wound to his head led the coroner's jury to rule the death a suicide. His wife retained Forbus as her lawyer, since a death by suicide would mean she was not entitled to his police pension. Forbus brought the case before a grand jury and proved that the gunshots were inflicted by two different bullets and that the garage had been locked from outside. The grand jury overruled the coroner and declared the death a murder, which granted his widow access to the pension.\nForbus campaigned to become prosecuting attorney in 1922, unsuccessfully, but she began to make more speeches and become involved in politics. She testified on behalf of a child labor amendment being debated by the Washington State Legislature and supported an illegitimacy law, retirement benefits for educators and a state department of education. As lawyers could not advertise their practices at the time, these activities raised her profile in the community. In 1932 and 1934, Forbus ran twice to be elected to the King County Superior Court. She ran on a platform \"that all laws should be construed liberally to meet the demands of the people who enact them and the purposes the law seeks to serve\" and supported establishing one court to handle all family matters, including divorce, custody, adoption and paternity. Although she received the backing of women's groups, Forbus was determined to campaign on the basis of her legal career and humanity, not her gender; in one campaign speech, she said, \"the highest qualifications of a judge are human kindliness and common sense in administration of justice. A woman, by nature and a mother, by experience and human contact, is especially fitted for the judiciary; for she brings to the bench not only legal knowledge but human understanding\". She was considered a controversial candidate at the time and lost both elections, although the was the first female candidate in King County.\nDespite her defeats for public office, Forbus continued to advocate for social programs and she became well known in Seattle and surrounding towns. She joined the Democratic Party and began working with the Women's Legislative Council to promote passage of the Twentieth Amendment and the Child Labor Amendment. Forbus participated in the 1936 Roosevelt Caravan, giving stump speeches at 40 towns in three weeks to speak in support of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. She was chair of the Democratic National Committee's State Speakers' Bureau. By the end of the decade, she was approached by the King County Democratic Central Committee to run for the Washington State Senate. Although her primary interest was in becoming a judge, she agreed to run.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nForbus was elected to the state senate in the 1942 general election, as senator for the 44th district. While she was in session in Olympia, her daughters travelled with her and worked as a page and in the secretarial pool. Concurrently with her senate service, Forbus was an assistant attorney general for the Washington Department of Labor and Industries in 1943 and the Washington Fisheries Department from 1944 to 1946. The 1943 legislative session began with the allocation of committee assignments. The first and second set of assignments were rejected but the third list passed on a unanimous vote. Forbus was appointed chair of the cities of the first class committee. She became chair of the judiciary committee and a member of the appropriations committee. She sponsored bills on family issues, civil actions, health care, and housing.\nAfter being re-elected to the legislature for her second term, Forbus received the support of a liberal group in Ballard, a neighborhood of Seattle, for supporting equal pay. Her connection to this organization led to her being publicly labelled as a communist and she lost her re-election campaign in 1948.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nForbus married Alvaro Shoemaker, a journalist for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, in 1921. Forbus retained her maiden name and the couple's two daughters, Alvara and Dale, were given hyphenated surnames, which was unusual for the time. The couple divorced in 1936 but remained close friends.\n\n\n== Later life and death ==\nAfter leaving the legislature, Forbus continued practicing as a lawyer. She remained active in the Democratic Party and in community activities. She was the party's precinct chair in the 36th legislative district, the first female president of the Magnolia Community Club, and president of the Ballard Business and Professional Women's Club and the Florence Crittenden Home for Unmarried Mothers. She was a board member of the Washington chapter of the American Lawyers Against First Strike Nuclear Arms and the American Civil Liberties Union in the 1980s. Forbus gave speeches on topics including \"Educational Development in Colonial America\", \"Garden Planning\" and \"An International Bill of Rights.\" She travelled internationally, including to South America, Mongolia, China, and the Soviet Union.\nIn 1984, Forbus retired from legal practice. She died on April 27, 1993, in Seattle at the age of 100.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOral history at the Washington Women's History Consortium",

        "content": "The Hotel Belvédère is a historic structure located on the Furka Pass near the Rhône Glacier in Switzerland.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Furka Pass road was opened between 1866 and 1867, and connects the Valais valley to the Uranaise valley previously cut by the Furkastock. In 1882, Josef Seiler built a lodge located in a hairpin created by the road. The beginnings are difficult for the lodge. It then expanded for the first time in 1890 to become a hotel. The construction of a gable roof with two additional floors gave the hotel its current appearance but the rooms, then without electricity or running water, were still relatively spartan.\n\nIn 1903, the building received a second transformation which propelled it into the Belle Époque and its first hours of glory. The hotel then became a luxury place and very popular for its panoramic location over the valley and the Rhône Glacier located, at the time, a few hundred meters from the road. The number of beds in 1907 then rose to 90.\nDuring the first half of the 20th-century, attendance at the Rhône glacier and the hotel continued to increase due to the arrival of the postal bus in 1921 and the opening of two new railway lines: the Furka Oberalp Railway and the Glacier Express in 1930. At that time, the fashion was then to mountain climbing. The walkers then give way to hikers who use the place as a starting point for hikes.\nThe hotel experienced a new boom after the World War II with the rise of the personal automobile. The hotel then becomes a destination for excursions to admire the Rhône glacier. The place then regularly welcomes prestigious visitors (the Pope John XXIII or Sean Connery).\nAlthough the hotel became cult following its appearance in the James Bond film Goldfinger in 1964, hotel attendance decreased sharply during the second half of the 20th century: with automobile progress, crossing the Alps was now easily done in one day with just short stops. In addition, the Rhône Glacier had retreated more than a kilometer from the Belvedere, the view of it from the hotel became less spectacular. The hotel closed for the first time in 1980 and was purchased by the State Council of the canton of Valais with the idea of ​​building a dam there which ultimately never happened. The hotel was then bought in 1988 by the Carlen family who restored the building to its original state and reopened it in 1990. However, the hotel has been closed again since 2015.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== Tributes ==\nThe hotel is visible in the third episode of the adventures of James Bond Goldfinger, from 1964, directed by Guy Hamilton.\nThe hotel is visible on the cover of the book Accidentally Wes Anderson by Wally Koval.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===",

        "content": "Wilson Mountain is a 7,122-foot-elevation (2,171-meter) summit in Coconino County, Arizona, United States.\n\n\n== Description ==\nWilson Mountain is located three miles north of Sedona in the Red Rock-Secret Mountain Wilderness, on land managed by Coconino National Forest. It is the highest peak in Sedona, and second-highest in the wilderness. Precipitation runoff from this mountain drains to Oak Creek which is part of the Verde River watershed. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises over 2,400 feet (732 meters) above Oak Creek Canyon in one mile (1.6 km). The nearest higher neighbor is East Pocket Knob, 3.73 miles (6 km) to the north. Wilson Mountain is composed of light-colored Coconino Sandstone overlaying reddish Schnebly Hill Formation, which is all capped by a layer of dark-gray basalt. Hiking to the top via the Wilson Mountain Trail covers 5.6 miles (one-way) with 2,300 feet of elevation gain.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nWilson Mountain and Wilson Canyon, which is on the mountain's southern slope, are named after Richard Wilson who was killed by a grizzly bear in the canyon in June 1885. Wilson, a bear hunter, was unable to resist the temptation to shoot the large grizzly with a small rifle he had with him instead of his usual large caliber bear gun, which was being repaired. The bear was only wounded, and attacked Wilson, and his mauled body was found nine days later. The mountain's toponym has been officially adopted by the United States Board on Geographic Names. Landforms officially named in association include Wilson Canyon, Lost Wilson Mountain, and First Bench of Wilson Mountain.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nAccording to the Köppen climate classification system, Wilson Mountain is located in a temperate semi-arid climate zone. Hikers can expect afternoon rain and lightning from the seasonal monsoon in late July and August.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of mountain peaks of Arizona\n Mountains portal\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWeather forecast: Wilson Mountain\nWilson Mountain Trail: US Forest Service",

        "content": "Ekkehard von Braunmühl born Wilhelm Ekkehard Hans Joachim Mariano von Braunmühl (29 December 1940, Gleiwitz - 24 June 2020, Wiesbaden) was a German freelance journalist and child rights activist. He is best known as the founder of Antipedagogy, a concept that challenges traditional approaches to education and child-rearing. Braunmühl's lifelong commitment to advocating for children's rights and challenging conventional educational norms left a lasting impact on the discourse around child-rearing and education. His work encourages us to rethink our approach to nurturing the next generation.\n\n\n== Antipedagogy ==\n\nBraunmühl advocated for the abolition of traditional education. He rejected the idea of “training” children through strict discipline to conform to adult expectations. Instead, he emphasized respecting the developing personality of the child and treating them as equals. According to Braunmühl, child-friendly behavior cannot be taught directly; it must be learned through experience. His book, Zeit für Kinder (Time for Children), served as a guidebook for those who wanted to embrace child-friendliness. He considered it a tool in the “antipädagogic struggle for freedom” and encouraged people everywhere to advocate for children's well-being and freedom.\nBraunmühl believed that children should have space for exploration and independent learning rather than being “trained” or “conditioned” through traditional education methods. In 1970, Braunmühl co-founded the parents’ association 1. APC Kinderhaus e. V. (1st Antipädagogical Club) in Wiesbaden. This association continued the antipedagogic tradition by operating as a child daycare center.\nBraunmühl's ideas were later adopted by Hubertus von Schoenebeck, albeit with some misunderstandings and distortions. This led to a heated discussion, culminating in the publication of the book, Was ist antipädagogische Aufklärung? Mißverständnisse, Mißbräuche, Mißerfolge der radikalen Erziehungskritik (What Is Antipädagogische Aufklärung? Misunderstandings, Abuses, and Failures of Radical Educational Critique) in 1997. His work aimed to shed light on the misconceptions surrounding antipedagogic ideas and their practical implications.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nAntipädagogik.

The full name of the firm was Landshoff Bermann Fischer Publishing.\n\n\n== Foundation ==\nFischer and Landshoff, both exiles from Fascist Germany, had moved to New York City in 1941 and established their company in order to publish literary fictionand non-fiction by young writers. Special emphasis was placed on English translations of German writers who had emigrated. Fischer had been associated with the prestigious S. Fischer Verlag, and Landshoff with Querido publishers in Amsterdam.\n\n\n== Significant publications ==\nThe first years saw significant publications like The American Harvest, an anthology including writers Willa Cather, Katherine Anne Porter, and E.E. Cummings. \nEdwin Seaver edited an annual series called Cross Section, discovering for the first time writers like Norman Mailer, Richard Wright, Arthur Miller, and Tennessee Williams. The 1944 volume was reportedly selected from \"over 1,000 manuscripts\" by writers without substantial previous publications; it included six novelettes, two full-length plays, a \"poetic drama\", seventeen short stories, a critical essay, and twenty-six poems.\nKlaus Mann and Hermann Kesten edited an anthology of German writing in English translation under the title The Turning Point.\nIn 1942, Fischer Publishing launched a series of short books designed to be authoritative introductions, in the paperback format, to various modern scientific fields. The board of editors included Alvin Johnson, director of the New School for Social Research; Harlow Shapley of Harvard University, and Alfred E. Cohn of the Rockefeller Institute.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Criollo Project is a car designed by Paweł Kalinowski.\n\n\n== Details ==\nCriollo is a classic SC Targa stroked to 3.2. There's a lot of technical upgrades and a story behind them. The car was used and rebuilt in the past by William Bruce \"Billy\" McNair, a Porsche specialist from the San Francisco area. He rebuilt the engine and stroked it from a stock 3.0 to a very strong 3.2. McNair modified it using Elephant Racing components. McNair passed away in 2019. The car was then purchased by Paweł Kalinowski, who wanted to continue this story through styling that McNair started.\nThis car was modified by the CarBone company and is not correct in accordance with the original. It is, however, one hundred percent correct with the owner's plans concerning the car. No factory signs, logos to keep the car clear. Many areas of the car's design were inspired by unism — an art movement from the city of Łódź, Poland. Pattern on the Targa bar, grill, floor boards, shifter coupler cover, headrests and the crest on the hood. They are unistic.\nEach of its elements is well thought out and puts it on the high podium of Porsche individualization. The seats are ultra-rare Recaro Rally II and boast a one-off upholstery in iconic pasha motif adapted to leather.\nThe car is painted to the original and correct Mocha Brown. The clear coat is matt to emphasize a new chapter for the original work. CarBone Bi-LED lights fill up the dark look of the car. The rear light cluster was tinted. Campagnolo wheels are in a dark, matt, gun metal shade, a reference to those used in 70's rally Porsches. Toyo R888 tires. The two pipes of a bypass muffler. It is radio controlled by a switch on the dashboard. The tunnel icon on a switch is a novelty detail. \nThe name \"Criollo\" was given to the car by Kalinowski. The brown color of the car reminded him of dark cocoa. A criollo is one of the most exclusive types of cocoa.\nKalinowski wanted to send the car to the United States to visit McNair's family. This car is a bridge between two people and two families. Criollo was presented at the largest Porsche event in the world — Rennsport Reunion 7, which took place in September 2023 in California.\nThe car now resides in the US and is displayed at the Wunderground Museum in Santa Clarita to showcase its story and craftsmanship.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTardza Project\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site",

        "content": "The Ässät–Sport rivalry, also known as the Kasitien derby, is an ice hockey rivalry between the HC Ässät Pori and Vaasan Sport, two professional ice hockey clubs in Finland. The rivalry has its roots in the 2009 SM-liiga qualifiers, where Ässät beat Sport in seven games to keep their SM-liiga spot. Sport was later promoted to the SM-liiga in 2014.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first game between Ässät and Sport was played in the 1975–76 SM-liiga season, but it wasn't considered a rivalry yet. The first game between the clubs ended in Ässät's 10–5 victory. The clubs faced each other a total of four times in the season, Ässät winning all four of the games. Sport was relegated after the season.\nÄssät and Sport met in the 2009 SM-liiga qualifiers. Sport played in the second tier Mestis, and Ässät played in the SM-liiga. Ässät beat sport in seven games, winning the last game 3–0. After the series, Ässät fined Sport for €2,000 for broken benches in the arena. The biggest scandal happened when Sport's coach Juhani Tamminen commented on the series and the whole league system in a press conference. Tamminen blamed the league for Sport's loss in the series, calling it unfair. Tamminen had also threatened Ässät's assistant coach Pasi Kaukoranta by telling him that he will rip his head off after Kaukoranta had allegedly provoked him. Tamminen was fined €2,500 by the league.\n\nIn 2024, Sport played Ässät at home to decide the last spot in the playoffs. The winning team would go to the playoffs and the loser would just miss them. Sport won the game 3–2 and Ässät missed the playoffs by two points.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSatakunnan derby\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Rudhall Manor is a manor house in Rudhall, Herefordshire, England. It dates from the late 14th century and is a Grade I listed building.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe hamlet of Rudhall sits at the junction of three parishes, Brampton Abbotts, Ross-on-Wye and Weston under Penyard, about 2 miles to the east of Ross. Rudhall Manor dates from the 14th century, although the house underwent extensive remodelling in each subsequent century and was restored in the 20th. In the Tudor era the manor came into the possession of Herbert Westfaling II, son of the Bishop of Hereford, who married the Rudhall heriess. In the early 19th century, the house was reputedly used as a point of assignation by Lord Nelson and his lover, Emma Hamilton, during their tours of the Wye Valley. In 1830 the manor was bought by Alexander Baring, 1st Baron Ashburton of Barings Bank. Later owners included the ornithologist Peter Scott and the businessman John Harvey-Jones. As at May 2024, the manor is for sale.\n\n\n== Architecture and description ==\nPevsner and Brooks describe the complex building history of the manor, which was begun in the 14th century, and developed by William Rudhall in the 16th. Later Georgian and Victorian developments saw the house extended with wings to the south and east. The interior has much wood panelling, some original and some introduced to the house, and decorative wood and stone carving. Above the entrance porch, the Rudhall badge, a Catherine Wheel, is displayed. Rudhall Manor is a Grade I listed building. Unusually, due to its location at the junction of three parishes, it has two Grade I listings, for the house in the Ross parish, and for those parts in the parish of Brampton Abbotts.\nThe grounds include a stream, lakes, and the base of a medieval church cross.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nBrooks, Alan; Pevsner, Nikolaus (2012).

        "content": "Kota Greenfield Airport is a proposed airport, planned to be built at Shambupura village in Bundi district, approximately 15 kilometres from Kota and 20 kilometres from Bundi, in Rajasthan, India. \nThe airport will be built by the Airports Authority of India (AAI). The airport site is within 10 kilometres of the Chambal Ghariyal wildlife sanctuary and within 10 kilometres of the Mukundara Hills National Park. The proposed airport falls in the notified buffer area of Ramgarh Vishdhari Wildlife Sanctuary and will use 466 hectares of forest land.\nAccording to AAI's project report submitted for forest clearance, the airport is being planned on 1250 acres for Airbus A320 type of aircraft in Phase 1, with a provision for 2900 metre long runway and an apron suitable for three Narrow-body aircraft. AAI will construct a terminal building measuring 15000 square metres, with a peak hour capacity of 800 passengers. An Air Traffic Control tower and technical building, a car park for 250 vehicles and a public transport zone is also planned as part of Phase 1.\nIn Phase 2, the runway will be extended to 3581 metres for operation of Code 4C aircraft along with precision approach CAT-1 lighting for IFR operations. Fifteen additional parking stands and a full-length parallel taxiway will also be built as part of Phase 2.\nIn November 2021, the Rajasthan Government's Cabinet approved the airport's construction and allocated land free of cost. The Environment ministry's Forest Advisory Committee (FAC) approved the greenfield airport in December 2022.\nIn the same month, the State Government approved a proposal of Rs 115 crore for works related to the construction of the airport. Rs 45 crore was to be borne by the Kota Urban Development Trust and the remaining Rs 75.80 crore by the State Government. The Rajasthan State Vidyut Prasaran Nigam Limited would spend Rs. 40 Crore for the work of shifting EHV power lines in the new Green Field Airport area, which will be carried out by Power Grid Corporation of India Limited.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sikidy is a form of algebraic geomancy practiced by Malagasy peoples in Madagascar. It involves algorithmic operations performed on data generated randomly from seeds of the fàno (Entada chrysostachys) tree, which are ritually arranged in a tableau called a toetry and interpreted after being mathematically operated on.\nThe divination is performed by a practitioner called an mpisikidy, ny màsina (lit. 'sacred ones'), ombiasy, or ambiàsa (derived from the Arabic anbia, meaning 'prophet') who guides the client through the process and interprets the results in the context of the client's inquiries and desires. Problems and questions for divined resolution via sikidy include the selection of a day on which to do something (including taking a trip, planting, and exhumation of ancestral corpses), whether a newborn child's destiny is compatible with its parents and thus whether it ought to be cared for by another family, the finding of a spouse, the finding of lost objects, the identification of a thief, and the explanation for a misfortune, including illness or sterility. Among the forest-dwelling Mikea people, sikidy is also used \"to direct the timing of residential movements to the forest (mihemotse)\". Some mpisikidy are considered specialists, dealing only with areas of inquiry and resolution within their expertise. Mpisikidy also provide guidance on how to avoid the misfortune divined in the subject's fate. The resolution often comes in the form of the ritual disposal of a symbolic object of misfortune, called the fàditra—for example, if the sikidy predicts the death of two men, then two locusts should be killed and thrown away as the fàditra.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe origin myth for sikidy \"links [the practice] both to the return by walking on water of Arab ancestors who had intermarried with Malagasy but then left, and to the names of the days of the week\" and holds that the art was supernaturally communicated to the ancestors, with God giving it to Ranakandriana, who then gave it to a line of diviners, the last of whom terminated the succession by giving it to the people, declaring: \"Behold, I give you the sikidy, of which you may inquire what offerings you should present in order to obtain blessings; and what expiation you should make so as to avert evils, when any are ill or under apprehension of some future calamity\".\nThe practice is several centuries old, and derives from the influence of Arab traders. Though the etymology of sikidy is unknown, it has been posited that the word derives from the Arabic sichr ('incantation' or 'charm'). Sikidy was of central importance to pre-Christian Malagasy religion, with one practitioner quoted in 1892 as calling sikidy \"the Bible of our ancestors\". The early colonial French governor of Madagascar Étienne de Flacourt documented sikidy in the mid-17th century.\n\n\n== Ritual ==\n\nAs part of an mpisikidy's initiation, the initiate must gather 124 and 200 fano seeds for his subsequent use.\nTo \"awaken\" the seeds in his bag as well as his own verbal powers, the mpisikidy incants to the gods or earth spirits in attempt to constrain the gods/spirits to tell the truth, with emphasis on \"the trickiness of the communicating entities, who misle[a]d if they [can]\", and orates the practice's origin myth. One incantation quoted by Norwegian missionary Lars Dahle reads:\n\nAwake, O God, to awaken the sun! Awake, O sun, to awaken the cock!\nAwake, O cock, to awaken mankind! Awake, O mankind, to awaken the sikidy, not to tell lies, not to deceive, not to play tricks, not to talk nonsense, not to agree to everything indiscriminately; but to search into the secret; to look into what is beyond the hills and on the other side of the forest, to see what no human eye can see.\nWake up, for thou art from the long-haired Mohammedans from the high mountains, from [Anakandriananahitra, the almost mythical founder of the art in Madagascar, whose name is followed by those authorities who passed the art on to the people and their present diviners, thereby establishing an historical line of legitimacy] ...\nAwake! for we have not got thee for nothing, for thou art dear and expensive. We have hired. thee. in exchange for a fat cow With a large hump, and for money on which there was no dust [i.e. good value]. Awake! for thou art the trust of the sovereign [the ruling house of pre-colonial Madagascar used court diviners literally dozens of times a day to decide the advisability of even the most everyday actions, from matters of state to the timing of matters of personal hygiene] and the judgement of the people. If thou art a sikidy that can tell, a sikidy that can see, and does not [only] speak about the noise of the people, the hen killed by its owner, the cattle killed in the market, the dust clinging to the feet [i.e. uninteresting\ncommonplaces) ,awake here on the mat!\n\nBut if thou art a sikidy that does not see, a sikidy that agrees to everything indiscriminately, and makes [false statements, as if] the dead [were] living, and the living dead, then do not arise here on the mat.\nHe then takes a fistful of awakened seeds from his bag and randomly divides the seeds into four piles. Seeds are removed two at a time from each pile until there is either one seed or two seeds remaining in each. The four remaining \"piles\" (now either single seeds or pairs) become the first entries in the first column of a toetry (tableau). The process is repeated three more times, with each new column of seeds being placed on the toetry to the left of the previous. At the end of this, the array consists of four randomly-generated columns of four values (each being either one seed or two) each. The generated data represented in this array is called the renin-sikidy (mother-sikidy). There are 65,536 possible renin-sikidy arrays. From the renin-sikidy data, four additional \"columns\" are read as the rows across the renin-sikidy's columns, and eight additional columns are generated algorithmically and placed centrally before the four original columns.\n\nEach column has a distinct divine referent:\n\nThe client\nMaterial goods\nA male evil-doer (lit. 'the third')\nThe earth\nThe child\nThe bad intentions\nA woman\nThe enemy (lit. 'the eighth')\nThe spirit (lit. 'the ninth')\nNourishment\nAncestors\nThe road\nThe diviner\nThe people\nThe creator\nThe house\n\n\n== Mathematics ==\nThe mathematics of sikidy include the concepts of algebra, symbolic logic and parity. The mpisikidy performs algorithmic checks to verify the toetry's validity throughout the sikidy process.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Notes ==",

It has received positive reviews from critics.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nEditors at AllMusic rated this album 4 out of 5 stars, with critic Thom Jurek writing that his release \"is an exploration and statement of Afro-futurist jazz refracted through hip-hop, vanguard, Eastern and Latin influences, and funk\" that is \"extremely listenable as a mind-blowing experiment to encounter and absorb\". Steven Loftin at The Line of Best Fit, rated this album an 8 out of 10, calling the music \"an expressive jazz tour de force\" that is an \"endless offering\" to both casual and close listeners. Pitchfork Media's Jay Balfour rated this work a 7.0 out of 10, stating that \"it’s exciting to hear a musician like Madlib untethered from the moment, and a testament to Riggins that he can create this type of space in the first place\" and critiquing that while the album \"is not always immediately gratifying... it’s always moving towards something\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nAll songs written by Otis Jackson and Karriem Riggins\n\n\"Je prendrai le Romanée-Conti (Putain de Leroy)\" – 2:00\n\"Les Jardins esméraldins (Pour Caillard)\" – 1:14\n\"Un Bordeaux pré-phylloxéra (Pour le riche enculé)\" – 3:10\n\"Deux Fakes Jayers (Aussi pour le riche enculé)\" – 3:32\n\"Riesling pour Robert\" – 4:39\n\"Du Morgon au Moulin-à-vent (Pour Duke)\" – 9:08\n\"Trou du cul (Ode au sommelier arrogant)\" – 2:35\n\"Etude Montrachet\" – 4:35\n\"Le Feu (Pour Belluard)\" – 0:33\n\"Merde (Basse-cour)\" – 5:11\n\"Inestimable Le Clos\" – 4:34\n\"La Closerie (Pour Prévost)\" – 2:05\n\"Hommage à la vielle garde (Pour Lafarge et Rinaldi)\" – 4:48\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nJahari Massamba Unit\n\nMadlib – rapping, instrumentation, recording, production\nKarriem Riggins – drums, recording, production, mixing\nAdditional personnel\n\nJason Bitner – audio mastering\nLisa Donnadieu – tranlsation\nJeff Jank – artwork\nEmile Omar – tranlsation\n\n\n== See also ==\n2020 in American music\n2020 in hip hop\n2020 in jazz\nList of 2020 albums\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPardon My French at Discogs (list of releases) \nPardon My French at MusicBrainz (list of releases)",

        "content": "The Jewish Community of Mainz had significance throughout Europe in the High Middle Ages, was destroyed several times, and has re-emerged even after the Holocaust.\n\n\n== Until the 11th Century ==\n\nThe origins of the Jewish community in Mainz are unclear. It is assumed that Jews had already come to the Middle Rhine during the time of the Roman Empire. However, there is so far no evidence for this assumption in Mainz. The first reliable evidence of a Jewish community is provided by rabbinical legal opinions from the second half of the 10th century, when a flourishing community already existed in Mainz. In the 10th century, Jewish families also began immigrating from Italy and southern France. The community in Mainz became a well-known center of Ashkenazic Judaism. The most famous scholar of that time was Gershom ben Judah, born around 960 in Metz, who worked in Mainz, where he died in 1028 or 1040. He founded a Jewish academy (Yeshiva) and thus strengthened a form of Judaism independent of the tradition of the Babylonian religious schools. Simeon bar Isaac was a rabbi and leader of the Jewish community of Mainz.\nThe oldest archaeological evidence of the Jewish community of Mainz dates from the 11th century.\n\n\n== 11th Century ==\nIn 1093, a synagogue was mentioned for the first time, located on the corner plot at Schusterstrasse/Stadthausstrasse. The oldest gravestone in the old Jewish cemetery - the only Jewish cemetery in Mainz until 1880 - dates from 1049 and is thus the oldest in Central Europe. At that time, the residential area of the Jews was located along the Rhine between the Fischtor and Karmeliterkirche gates. This residential quarter was not a ghetto; rather, most of the inhabitants there were non-Jews. A synod in 1310 prohibited this mixed dwelling.\nThe leading class of Mainz Jews was primarily involved in long-distance trade. From Mainz, the Jews traded in spices, silk, furs and metalwares. The Jewish residential quarter was conveniently located for this, as the trade center Am Brand, the city's most important market for goods arriving by ship, was located just to the south. There was also a spatial proximity to the prince-elector's court. The king had entrusted the protection of the Jews to the Prince-Elector of Mainz. The Jews were also active in lending, which was hindered for the Christian population by the prohibition of interest. Jews also owned vineyards both inside and outside the city. They were considered free and able to bear arms, allowed to keep non-Christian slaves, and able to live according to their own laws, which increasingly conformed to the laws of non-Jews by the beginning of the 13th century.\nThe community was led by parnasim, trustees and elders who together formed the Jewish council.\nThe privileges for Jewish merchants regulated in Jewish law were already the subject of hostilities in the 11th century. In 1012, King Heinrich II expelled the Jews from Mainz for the first time. In 1084, after a fire in the Jewish quarter, there were clashes that led to the flight of Jews to Speyer, where the local bishop, Rüdiger Huzmann, granted them a favorable privilege, thereby promoting the town's development.\n\n\n== Crusade of 1096 ==\nThe most serious event in the history of the medieval Jewish community in Mainz was the Crusade (anti-Jewish pogrom) of 1096, in which Archbishop Ruthard completely failed in the task of protecting the Jews that had been entrusted to him by the Emperor.\nIn the Jewish liturgy, the victims of this massacre are commemorated under the name Gezerot Tatnu (\"Persecution of the Year 4856\" (according to the Jewish calendar)).\nIn 1097, Emperor Henry IV enabled those who had been forced to convert during the pogrom to return to their ancestral faith. The Jewish community thus continued to exist.\n\n\n== New beginning: 11th to 14th Century ==\n\nTogether with the communities in Speyer and Worms, the community of Mainz formed the center of Ashkenazic Judaism. These three Shum cities - Shpira (Speyer), Vermaisia (Worms) and Magenza (Mainz) - formed an association from the 12th to the 14th century, had joint advisory bodies, and from the 1220s a common law (Taqqanot Qehillot Shum) with high authority in northern Central Europe.\nThe protection of the Jews was the responsibility of the Emperor, for which they paid him taxes, a responsibility that he had granted to the Archbishop of Mainz as an imperial fief. After receiving municipal freedom in 1244, this responsibility passed to the City of Mainz in 1295.\nDuring all further Crusades there were outbursts against the Jews of the city, though these did not reach the dimension of the pogrom of 1096. In the 14th century, anti-Jewish sentiments intensified again. On 28 August 1349, there was a major pogrom in Mainz that few Jews survived, and parts of the Jewish quarter burned down as a result. The property left behind by the dead and the refugees was confiscated by the city council.\nIt was not until 1356 that Jews returned to the city again. The council rented them the buildings it administered under the name \"Judenerbe\" (Jewish inheritance). Emperor Charles IV issued the returnees a comprehensive letter of protection. In contrast to earlier times, the leadership of the Jewish community now consisted of the community's rabbi and three trustees elected at the beginning of each year.\nThe circumstances of the Jewish community were constantly threatened in physical and economic terms: high taxes, debt remissions in favor of their creditors, and economic restrictions jeopardized their livelihood. Additionally, the community only had the right to remain for the duration of letters of protection issued by the city council. The oldest surviving document of this kind dates from 1365.\n\n\n== Expulsions in the 15th Century ==\nIn the 15th century, the prohibition for Christians lending with interest gradually loosened. As a result, many cities and territories expelled their Jewish populations, whose services were no longer deemed necessary. In Mainz, this coincided with the conflict between the patricians and guilds, who were fighting for power in the city council. The victory of the guilds worsened the situation for the Jews, as the guilds were more anti-Semitic.\nIn 1438, the city council ordered the expulsion of the Jews on 25 July 1438. The Jewish cemetery was desecrated, and the synagogue was converted into a coal depot. In 1444, however, the city's high debts prompted the council to call the Jews back. 25 July 1445 is considered the day the Jewish Community of Mainz was re-established. At this time it comprised between 100 and 130 people, about 1.7 to 1.9% of the total population.\nSince the Jews, like many other citizens during the Mainz Abbey Feud, were supporters of Diether von Isenburg, they were expelled from the city along with other followers of Diether by his opponent Adolph II of Nassau after his victory on 28 October 1462. In 1463, Adolf II called them back before expelling them again from the entire Electorate in 1471. Jewish property was confiscated, and the synagogue converted into a church.\n\n\n== Revival of the community from the 16th Century ==\nHowever, the expulsions did not mean – as previously assumed – the complete end of Jewish life in the city. Records from the reign of Archbishop Berthold von Henneberg (1484–1504) show that Jewish citizens took care of the mikveh and accommodated traveling Jews. They were also responsible for burying Jews at Jewish cemetery, which could only refer to Jews of the Electorate of Mainz. A further expulsion from the Electorate, ordered by Archbishop Jakob von Liebenstein on 3 June 1507, also proves that Jews continued to live here.\nIn 1510, the new Archbishop Uriel von Gemmingen protested against the actions of Johannes Pfefferkorn, who confiscated and burned Jewish books in Mainz. Emperor Maximilian I appointed an investigative commission, and Uriel von Gemmingen was named its chairman. Especially Johann Reuchlin, who was called to the commission, sharply condemned the Dominicans' initiative of Pfefferkorn and advocated a more understanding approach towards Judaism.\nIn 1517, Archbishop Albert of Brandenburg admitted numerous Jews to the Archbishopric. In 1594, there was again a synagogue in the city, and a 1614 assessment book mentions six Jewish families in the city. There was no rabbi at that time, so the Jews turned to the rabbis in Worms and Frankfurt am Main on religious matters. In 1602, the Mainz Jews were assigned the rabbi in Bingen, and in 1630 the community in Mainz again had its own rabbi again.\nIn 1639, a new synagogue opened on Klarastrasse at the corner of Stadionerhofstrasse, and was already expanded in 1649. In 1644, there were 40 Jewish homeowners and tenants, as well as 15 subtenants in the city, living on Langgasse, Bleiche, Emmeranstrasse, near the Franciscan church, on Betzelstrasse, Schillerplatz, Fischmarkt, near the Christoph church and on Karmeliterplatz.\n\n\n== The Jewish oolicy of the Prince-Electors in the 17th and 18th Centuries ==\nA deep incision for Jewish life was the Jewish policy of the Prince-Electors of Mainz from the 17th century onwards. After complaints from merchants about unwanted competition from Jewish traders, the Prince-Elector and territorial lord of Mainz, Johann Philipp von Schönborn, expelled all Jewish families except for 20 from the city on 8 December 1662. The remaining families had to live in a ghetto, a street which they had to close off on Sundays. They were not allowed to work in guilded trades. The decree proved unenforceable, so in 1671 the Prince-Elector issued another decree limiting the number of families to 10 – a restriction that also failed. He then assigned them the old Judengasse near the Poor Clares Convent as a ghetto. The resettlement took place as part of an urban expansion planned by the Prince-Elector, which involved major development measures and the construction of prestigious buildings. The properties were provided to the Jews free of charge, and the Prince-Elector also granted them – just like the Christians – discounts on craftsmen and building materials. Soon the \"Hintere Judengasse\" (Rear Jewish Street) was added to the \"Vordere Judengasse\" (Front Jewish Street). In the center from 1684 was the new, albeit unimpressive synagogue. In 1687, about 250 Jews lived in Mainz, about 1% of the total population. In 1717, the synagogue was enlarged.\nDespite all outward restrictions, the Jewish community had rather extensive internal autonomy. It also had its own seal and the status of a corporation. The community leadership consisted of five trustees, five tax collectors and five deputies each, with the office of Parnas Hachodesch (president) rotating monthly. The leadership collected state taxes from community members themselves and passed them on to the princely administration. The rabbi exercised jurisdiction in the first instance. The second instance was the princely court.\nPrince-Elector Lothar Franz von Schönborn (1695–1729) limited the number of protected families to 101. In addition, there were the rabbi, the cantor, the schoolkeeper, the doctor and the court factor, protected widows, the servants and the students of the rabbi. Admission to the Jewish community was only permitted if the number of 101 families was not exceeded. Admission fees and taxation of Jews was significantly higher than for Christian citizens of Mainz.\nFrom 1710 onwards, the Jewish community acquired land adjacent to the Judengasse and built additional houses there. In 1768, Prince-Elector Emmerich Joseph von Breidbach zu Bürresheim permitted Jews to build further houses, including outside the two Judengassen. This effectively abolished the restriction to the ghetto.\nThe Enlightenment brought relief for Jews as well. Under Prince-Elector Friedrich Karl Joseph von Erthal (1774–1802), there were discussion about improving the social situation of Jewish subjects. However, opening up guilded professions to Jews was still rejected. Jews were permitted to establish businesses and manufactures without guild organisation that did not require journeymen or apprentices. Moreover, reforming the education system and alleviating the pressing housing shortage in the quarter now inhabited by 848 Jews seemed a priority to the authorities. Jewish children were recommended to attend Christian schools. Furthermore, a rescript from the Prince-Elector instructed the authorities to treat Jews and Christians equally. However, the emancipation of Jews was still unimaginable in the estate-based society.\n\n\n== Emancipation through France ==\nEmancipation came from external forces after the defeat of the Empire in the Revolutionary Wars and the occupation of Mainz by France in 1792. Since all Jews in France had enjoyed full citizenship rights since 1791, this now applied to the Jewish community of Mainz. On 3 November 1792, when the Liberty Tree was erected, Jews stood alongside all others as equals.\nNevertheless, the Jewish community remained hostile towards the newly founded Mainz Jacobin Club. Jews who joined were subject to synagogue bans. Only 18 Jews responded to the call to swear allegiance to the revolutionary French constitution in 1793, which accounted for 15% of household heads. However, those who refused to swear allegiance faced expulsion. After the imperial troops besieged the city in 1793, the \"unsworn\", including many Jews, had to leave the city. Subsequently, the return of German authorities was met with satisfaction by the Jews. The reason for this hostile attitude of the Jews towards the Jacobins was, on the one hand, a skepticism towards innovations in general. Added to this were the reservations of the Mainz Jacobins towards the Jews and the fear that entry into the bourgeoisie would endanger religious adherence to the law.\nHowever, after the French reoccupied the city in 1797, such concerns dissipated, partly due to the changed spirit of the times. In 1798, Ludwig Bamberger became the first Jew to sit on the city council. In the same year, the Jewish guardhouse in the old ghetto was torn down. Jews were now allowed to settle as citizens throughout the city.\nEven under Napoleon, Jewish life was not free from regulations. Napoleon decreed a centralized communal system. A consistory was established in each department, which was subordinate to the central consistory in Paris. The consistory consisted of two rabbis and three laymen, who had to be confirmed by the French government. Responsible for the consistorial administration in each departmental capital was a chief rabbi. The chief rabbi of Mainz was Rabbi Samuel Wolf Levi (1751–1813). According to an imperial decree of 17 March 1808, a Jew was not allowed to engage in trade for ten years unless he had a corresponding patent. These patents certified by the mayor's office that the person had not been guilty of usury and by the Jewish community that he had behaved uprightly and faithfully fulfilled his obligations (\"morality patents\").\n\n\n== Development of Emancipation after 1816 ==\nAfter Napoleon's defeat and the departure of the French from Mainz in 1816, the city became part of the Grand Duchy of Hesse as the capital of the newly formed province of Rheinhessen. The new government explicitly assured that it would not change the legal situation introduced under French rule. Only in 1847 were the morality patents abolished and Jews were still denied entry into the civil service.\nIn 1819, the Jewish community reintroduced the rules on board elections from 1750. The board consisted of five persons chaired by the president. A regulation from 1830 stipulated that the district office had to appoint the board members after consulting the mayor's office. The communities now officially bore the name \"Israelitische Religionsgemeinde\" (\"Israelite Religious Community\") and had the right to levy assessments on their members. In 1831, a new synagogue ordinance came into force, followed by a new burial ordinance in 1832. In 1850, there were 2,125 Jews living in the city out of a total population of 37,000.\n\n\n== Division of the community ==\n\nReforms and emancipation also raised concerns that Jewish identity could be lost through assimilation. Deeply intrusive reforms in the religious rituals, such as replacing the Bar Mitzvah with a confirmation in 1840, or the planned abolition of the separate women's synagogue, led to serious disputes. In 1849, this culminated in a division of the Jewish community into Orthodox and liberal factions with separate administrations, community lives, synagogues, schools, and facilities. However, both communities continued to function outwardly as a corporation. Joseph Aub served as the rabbi of the liberal community from 1852 to 1865, while the Orthodox community was led by Marcus Lehmann.\n\n\n== New flourishing period ==\nDespite the division, the period from the second half of the 19th century until 1933 can be considered a flourishing time for the Jewish community of Mainz. This is evidenced not least by the construction of new synagogues. The Mainz Main Synagogue in Neo-Byzantine style, designed by architect Ignaz Opfermann, was completed in 1853. It was replaced by a new building in 1912, designed by architect Willy Graf.\nMembers of the community participated in the city's association life, charitable activities, and sponsorship, for example, supporting the municipal theater and various sports clubs, including 1. FSV Mainz 05. Antisemitic political parties had no significant success in Mainz. However, materially, things were worse for the \"Eastern Jews\" who immigrated, especially after World War I – pogrom refugees from the then-Russian part of Poland, who had already founded the \"Israelite Humanitarian Association\" as the third subgroup of Mainz Jews in 1908. The influx of this group, which was unfamiliar with the mentality of the Rhineland Jews, exacerbated the contrasts between liberals and Orthodox within the community.\n\n\n== Downfall of the community during the Nazi Era ==\n\nWith the \"seizure of power\" by the Nazis in 1933, the disenfranchisement of Jewish citizens began in Mainz: dismissal from public service, boycott of Jewish businesses, exclusion from schools, expropriation, and revocation of citizenship. During the Kristallnacht on 9-10 November 1938, the main synagogue and the synagogue on Flachsmarktstraße were set on fire, and the main synagogue was subsequently demolished. The Jewish community had to bear the costs of the demolition. However, part of the Jewish library was rescued. It is now on loan to the Protestant Theological Faculty of the University of Mainz and comprises approximately 5,500 volumes.\nIn 1942, the deportation of Mainz Jews began. On 30 March 1942, 450 people were taken to the Piaski concentration camp near Lublin, and on 27 September, another 450 Jews were sent to the Theresienstadt concentration camp. Three days later, 117 Jews were deported to the General Government in Poland. In the last transport on 10 February 1943, 15 Jews from Mainz were deported, totaling 1,092 people. There were also Jews who were removed from the city on smaller transports. 1,420 Jews from Mainz were able to leave Germany in time.\nWhen the US Army captured the city on 22 March 1945, there were still 61 Jews living in the city. These were Jews who lived in \"privileged mixed marriages I,\" from which children had been born. On 10 July 1945, two survivors returned to Mainz from Theresienstadt, but this was unusual.\n\n\n== New beginning after the Holocaust ==\nOn 17 October 1945, the Mainz cultural director and survivor Michel Oppenheim, a Jew from Mainz, applied to the French military government – Mainz now belonged to the French occupation zone – for the re-establishment of the Mainz Jewish community. Permission was granted on the same day. On 9 November 1945, 20 gathered Jews at the city hall decided to re-establish the community. However, services did not resume until 10 September 1947, when a new synagogue was established at the Feldberg School. In 1948, the community erected a memorial at the entrance of the Jewish cemetery on Untere Zahlbacher Straße. Another memorial is represented by the erected columns from the entrance hall of the destroyed main synagogue of 1912.\nThe rebuilding of the community after the war was slow. The main problem was the low number of members, which also delayed the construction of a new synagogue for a long time. Since 1959, the Jewish Community of Mainz has been a corporation under public law. Construction of the New Synagogue – at the old location – began on 23 November 2008. It was inaugurated on 3 September 2010.\n\n\n== Jewish Community today ==\n\nThe Jewish community in Mainz has approximately 1000 members (as of 2015), with many of the community members coming as immigrants from Eastern European countries.\nThe remaining Jewish sites in Worms, especially the reconstructed medieval synagogue and the old Jewish cemetery, a Jewish cemetery dating back to the High Middle Ages in terms of its occupancy, are also under the auspicies of the Jewish community of Mainz. Since 2021, the synagogue and cemetery in Worms, as well as the historic Jewish cemetery in Mainz, have been part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nThe community rabbi is Rabbi Aharon Ran Vernikovsky. The community is led by a five-member, volunteer board, which is elected every 4 years.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nGünter Christ: Erzstift und Territorium Mainz = Friedhelm Jürgensmeier (editor): Handbuch der Mainzer Kirchengeschichte volume 2.

        "content": "FSV Barleben 1911 is a football club from the unified municipality of Barleben in the federal state of Saxony-Anhalt, located north of Magdeburg. The home of the club is the sports field at Barleber Anger. The biggest success in the club's history is the winning of the national championship title 2014/15.\nThe first team has been playing in the Verbandsliga Sachsen-Anhalt since 2018 after the voluntary withdrawal from the southern relay of the Oberliga Nordost and has been trained by Christoph Grabinski since July 2021.\n\n\n== Prehistory ==\nThe chronicle of Barleber football goes back to 1911, when the first sports club with a football section was founded. In the early years, however, the association did not appear nationwide. After the end of the Second World War, the club was dissolved in 1945 at the instigation of the Soviet occupying power, but sports activities continued to exist. In the course of the reorganization of company sports on a production basis, the BSG VEM Barleben was created in 1948, a company sports community, which was joined by the sports community formed in 1945. In the following years, the club, renamed BSG Motor Barleben in 1950, achieved some success. For example, they belonged to the Bezirksliga Magdeburg from 1952 to 1954 and 1956/1957. From 1957 until the reunification of both German states, Barleben played continuously in the district class for many years, but in 1987/88 he was relegated to the district league. With the end of the GDR, the BSG Motor Barleben was refounded into SG Motor Barleben.\nAfter the introduction of the DFB league system in East Germany, SG Motor Barleben therefore found itself at district level for the 1990/91 season. In the mid-1990s, Barleber football managed to return to FSA level with the promotion to the state class.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1997, the footballers went their own way and left SG Motor Barleben and founded their own club. In tradition to the first Barleben football team, they called the club FSV Barleben 1911. At the end of the 2003/04 season, the FSV was relegated from the state class after long-standing affiliation. Only the absence of relegated in the Ohrekreisliga prevented the further decline of the club in 2005. It was not until 2008 that the Red-Blacks found they back in national football, whereby with a new promotion they even succeeded in the march into the now seventh-class state league. Although the club had to accept the direct relegation, the immediate re-promotion to the Landesliga Nord followed in the year of the 100th anniversary. After the placements three and four, FSV Barleben rose undefeated to the Verbandsliga Saxony-Anhalt with first place in 2014. In 2015, winning the state championship of Saxony-Anhalt succeeded in the first promotion to the Oberliga, so that the club was active for the first time in the fifth highest division of the DFB league system in the 2015/16 season. In the new league, the team of coach Mario Middendorf with ninth place already managed the safe class preservation with a few match days before the end of the season, which with a 13. Place was also realized in the following season. After the third season in the Oberliga, the first under coach Jörn Schulz, and the renewed sporting class retention, the club withdrew to the Verbandsliga for economic reasons.\n\n\n== Stadium ==\nThe club usually plays its home games on the sports field at Barleber Anger, which has a lawn (main square) and an artificial turf field. However, if games are due that require a higher level of security or if more than 1,000 spectators are expected to play at home, they will not take place on the home sports field.\n\n\n== Players and coaches of the men's team ==\n\n\n== Saxony-Anhalt Cup ==\n\n\n== Successes ==\nHall district master district of Börde (2007/08)\nDistrict Master District of Börde (2007/08)\nChampion State Class 4 (2008/09)\nChampion State Class 2 (2010/11)\nChampion Landesliga Nord (2013/14)\nNational Champion Saxony-Anhalt (2014/15)\n\n\n== Weblinks ==\nwww.fsvbarleben.de",

        "content": "Presentation (Russian: Презентация)  is a book (collection of short stories) by Russian writer Andrei Gusev, published in 1993.\n\n\n== Plot summary ==\nThe collection includes eleven short stories, each with its own unique plot and setting.  The reader's attention will be attracted by mystical and dramatic stories, lyrical scenes, as well as eroticism (including BDSM fantasy). The collection is named after one of the included short stories, \"Presentation\".\n\n\n== Literary features ==\nMany characters from Andrei Gusev's stories have access to reflection, humor and what has always been called a flight of fancy. His character is most often an intellectual who has found his place in life. But in relationships with others, even the people most dear to him, it turns out that he is not understood, and he does not want to live \"wide open\", allowing anyone into all corners of his soul. His characters sometimes indulge in fearless devilry and even mentally transform into an astral body. But which of us hasn't had something like this happen? Who, at least in dreams, has not fled to the notorious \"zero zone\"?\nThe use of colloquial language and, at times, profanity, adds an extra dimension to Andrei Gusev's writing, giving it a unique flavor and honesty.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\nAndrei Gusev (1993).

        "content": "The German Mission House (also known as the Maunganui Stone Cottage) is a 19th-century stone cottage at Maunganui on northern Chatham Island, New Zealand. Johannes Engst and Johann Baucke, members of a group of German Moravian missionaries, built the house in the late 1860s alongside Baucke's son William. The building was constructed from stone sourced from the nearby volcanic cone, Maunganui Bluff. The Moravian mission in the Chathams was broadly unsuccessful (failing to gain a single convert on the islands), and Engst alone stayed on the island, residing as a farmer at the house until his retirement in 1900. The house continues to serve as a private residence, although it is frequently visited by tourists to the islands. In 1991, it was listed as a Category 1 historic place by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust. Repair work was intermittently carried out on the structure from 1998 to 2010 in response to damage to the masonry.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1842, five German Moravian Church missionaries were sent to New Zealand by the Gossner Mission, led by schoolmaster Franz Schirmeister. Unable to find a suitable location to preach, they sailed to the Chatham Islands. They arrived in February 1843, initially settling at Te Whakaru on the main island of Chatham. Although ultimately failing to make any converts among either the Māori or Moriori inhabitants of the islands, they are credited with the introduction of shipbuilding and sheep farming, and established the island's first school.\nAll members of the mission lived apart for some time in order to connect with the local community. From 1866 to 1868 Johannes Gottfried Engst and Johann Baucke, alongside Baucke's son William (born on the island), constructed a stone cottage at Maunganui on the northern coast. The cottage was constructed with stone from the adjacent Maunganui Bluff, a 178 m (584 ft) volcanic cone, using mortar derived from pipi shells. The doors and window lintels of the house were made from akeake wood. In addition to sheepherding, the missionaries grew orchard trees, vegetables, and macrocarpa at the site. Several outbuildings, including a woolshed and stable, were constructed at the site, although only the Mission House is now extant.\nJohann Baucke left the Chathams in the late 1860s, following a land feud and the death of his wife. Engst continued to live and farm at the site, employing Baucke's children as labourers. Reverend P. C. Anderson visited the house in 1882, describing it as \"a capital house... The blocks of which it is built are nearly a foot square, cut with the axe, so it must have involved an enormous amount of labour to build.\" Engst retired from farming in 1900, around eighty years old, and moved to Te One, where he died in 1910.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nThe German Mission House remains a private residence. Various small improvements and additions have been added to the structure by its owners since its construction. It is frequently visited by tourists, although its remote location requires a half-day round trip by vehicle. An entry fee and prior permission from the owners is required to visit the site.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe German Mission House is rectangular, with a gable roof. Initially thatched, the modern roof is fashioned out of corrugated iron. The exterior stonework of the structure was initially exposed, but later plastered with lime. Early in its history, a veranda was installed on the building, but it has since been removed, leaving only a foundation line. Bedrooms were placed inside the roof, accessible by a staircase on the western side of the house. These were initially lit on either end by windows in the western and eastern ends of the house; however, the eastern window has since been removed.\nThe building's ground floor is constructed from blocks of tuff and basalt, sourced from the western edge of the house. A stone-lined cellar was built at this spot. Timber floors are placed above this foundation. The building is split into three rooms, the middle the largest, each of which contains a casement window on the north side. The internal walls between these rooms are constructed from ponga logs, with plaster lining.\nModern interior fixtures for the kitchen and laundry have been installed in the house, alongside a modern bathroom in the eastern room. A lean-to was added in 1955. A possible earlier lean-to is evidenced by remaining stone foundations. Two chimneys, one on the southern wall and one on the western, were initially installed. The western chimney collapsed at some point before 2010.\n\n\n=== Conservation and repairs ===\n\nThe house was listed as a Category 1 historic place by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust (NZHPT) on 11 November 1991. Historic structures on the Chatham Islands frequently face deterioration, exacerbated by a lack of skilled labour on the islands. Alison Dangerfield, a NZHPT architect, stated that due to this \"Chatham Islanders generally cope with the lack of labour by not doing repairs\".\nA small team, consisting of a conservation architect, stonemason, and sculptor, repaired the stonework of the house over two weeks in 1998. Two years later, a new roof and steel cladding on the western wall were installed. A conservation plan for the building was drawn up in 2005. A NZHPT team, joined by a large number of local volunteers, carried out repair work on the house in April 2010, drilling tie rods into the masonry at ceiling level. The team also rebuilt a damaged wall with stone sourced from local environs.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===",

        "content": "Marie Catherine Neal (December 7, 1889 – June 6, 1965) was an American botanist and author known for her contributions to the study of Hawaiian flora and her efforts to popularize botanical knowledge.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life and education ===\nMarie Catherine Neal was born on December 7, 1889, in Southington, Connecticut, to Linus B. Neal, a banker, and Eva W. Chedney. Her interest in nature was sparked during childhood hunting and fishing excursions with her father, leading to a lifelong passion for botany.\nNeal pursued her education at Smith College, graduating in 1912 with a B.A. degree. Her studies included a course in botany. During her college years, she gained administrative experience working as a secretary for various organizations. She received an MS degree from Yale University in 1925.\n\n\n=== Career ===\nFollowing her graduation, Neal began her career in botany as a secretary in the geology department at Yale under Herbert E. Gregory. In 1920, she moved to Honolulu, Hawaii, to continue her work for Gregory at the Bishop Museum. Initially placed in the conchology department, Neal's botanical interests led her to focus on Hawaiian flora. During her tenure at the Bishop Museum from 1920 to 1930, Neal made notable contributions to the study of Hawaiian plants. She collaborated on research projects, including cataloging terrestrial mollusks and coauthoring a monograph on land snails.\nNeal's expertise in botany extended beyond academia. She contributed articles to the Paradise of the Pacific magazine, popularizing her knowledge of Hawaii's cultivated plants. In 1928, Neal coauthored her first major book, \"In Honolulu Gardens,\" which provided scientific descriptions and illustrations of Hawaiian plants. The book received acclaim for its blend of botanical information with Hawaiian legends and folklore.\n\n\n==== Contributions to botany ====\nIn 1930, Neal was appointed botanist at the Bishop Museum, where she expanded the herbarium collections and earned international recognition for her scholarship. She assisted scholars and the public in identifying Hawaiian plants and contributed to the museum's educational initiatives. Neal's botanical research extended to the outer islands of Hawaii, where she conducted extensive fieldwork, discovering new plant species and conducting research for her publications.\n\n\n=== Later life and legacy ===\nMarie Catherine Neal's significant work, \"In Gardens of Hawaii,\" published in 1948 and revised in 1965, described over 2,000 botanic species with detailed scientific information and illustrations. Neal's contributions to botany were recognized, and she received honors for her scientific achievements. She passed away on June 6, 1965.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nPeterson, Barbara Bennett (February 2000). \"Neal, Marie Catherine\". American National Biography.

        "content": "Pseudotopeliopsis is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Graphidaceae. It has two species.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe genus was circumscribed in 2012 by the lichenologists Sittiporn Parnmen, Robert Lücking, and H. Thorsten Lumbsch. They assigned Pseudotopeliopsis laceratula as the type species; this lichen was originally named as a member of genus Thelotrema by Johannes Müller Argoviensis in 1887. The genus name is derived from the Greek word pseudo, meaning \"false\", combined with the name Topeliopsis, alluding to its resemblance to that genus.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe thallus of Pseudotopeliopsis typically has dense outer layer, or cortex. The apothecia (fruiting bodies) emerge from the thallus and are rounded to irregularly shaped. These apothecia feature a disc that resembles a small pore and is covered by concentrically layered, fissured, and lobulated margins. The surrounding tissue of the apothecia, known as the excipulum, varies from colourless to brown.\nThe spores of Pseudotopeliopsis are elongated, ranging from fusiform-ellipsoid to oblong-cylindrical in shape, and are divided by cross walls (septa) that may be slightly thickened and form angular spaces within the spore. These spores are initially colourless and can turn brown as they age. They do not react to staining with iodine solution.\nChemically, this genus does not produce any notable secondary metabolites (lichen products) that are detectable with standard chemical spot tests. Pseudotopeliopsis is distinct from the closely related genus Chapsa primarily due to its denser cortex and the unique structure of its apothecia, which resemble those of the genus Topeliopsis with their striated tissue filling the disc–a distinctive structural feature that sets it apart from similar genera.\n\n\n== Species ==\nPseudotopeliopsis laceratula (Müll.Arg.) Parnmen, Lücking & Lumbsch (2012)\nPseudotopeliopsis longispora Papong, Lücking & Parnmen (2015)\nAlthough the genus was originally circumscribed with four species, three of those have since been transferred to other genera:\n\nPseudotopeliopsis aggregata (Hale) Parnmen, Lücking & Lumbsch (2012) is now Nitidochapsa aggregata\nPseudotopeliopsis scabiocarpa (Rivas Plata & Lücking) Parnmen, Lücking & Lumbsch (2012) is now Chapsa scabiocarpa\nPseudotopeliopsis scabiomarginata (Hale) Parnmen, Lücking & Lumbsch (2012) is now Chapsa scabiomarginata.\n\n\n== References ==",

The nearest inhabited locality is Zhanbobek (Жанбөбек) located 23 kilometers (14 mi) to the southwest of the lakeshore. \n\n\n== Geography ==\nKiyakty is an endorheic lake of the Kulanotpes basin that lies at 398 meters (1,306 ft) above sea level. It is located 16 kilometers (9.9 mi) to the south of the southern shore of Lake Tengiz. The Kiyakty, an intermittent river, flows into the southeastern corner. This river usually dries up in the summer. There is a 600 meters (2,000 ft) long islet off the western lakeshore.\nThe northern lakeshore is steep, between 1 meter (3 ft 3 in) and 1.8 meters (5 ft 11 in) high. The western, southern and eastern shorelines are flat and marshy. The lake is fed by snow, precipitation and groundwater. Its water level is usually at its highest in April and at its lowest in October. Lake Kerey lies 30 kilometers (19 mi) to the WNW. In recent years, Kiyakty is turning into a sor.\n\n\n== Flora and fauna ==\nLake Kiyakty is surrounded by steppe vegetation and its basin is a seasonal grazing ground for local cattle. In August 1985 there was reportedly a colony of about 300 greater flamingos in the lake.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of lakes of Kazakhstan\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Kiyakty at Wikimedia Commons\nTowards Sustainable Pasture Agrolandscapes: A Landscape-Ecological-Indicative Approach to Environmental Audits and Impact Assessments",

        "content": "Erica Scourti (born in Athens) is an artist based in the UK whose works (which combine performance, digital media, the web, and video) have been exhibited at the Brighton Photo Biennial, the Hayward Gallery Project Space, and the Photographers' Gallery in London Her performance project, Life In Adwords (2012), involved her keeping a diary by email to her Google account and creating videos based on the advertising targeted to her as a result.  \n\n\n== Biography ==\nErica Scourti (born 1980) is a British-Greek artist, is a well-known modern artist whose work appears in performance, video, literature, and digital media. She frequently looks at issues of identity, technology, and the modern individual. In the context of internet culture, Scourti's work often blurs the lines between the public and private domains through elements of self-exposure and self-reflection. Her critical engagement with digital platforms and the ways in which they influence our perspectives of others and ourselves characterizes her artistic production. Scourti's artwork has been shown in galleries, museums, and festivals around the world.  \n\n\n== Education ==\nIn 2013, Scourti completed a Master of Research degree (with Distinction) in Moving Image Art at Central Saint Martin’s College of Art & Design. She is currently completing a PhD in art at Goldsmiths.  \n\n\n== Artworks ==\nErica Scourti often creates interdisciplinary work combining digital media, literature, film, and performance. Erica Scourti's work explores topics of identity, technology, and the self in the digital era. She draws on her strong foundation in artistic practice and critical inquiry, which she acquired via her school.\n\n\n===== \"Life in AdWords\" (2013) =====\n\"Life in AdWords\" is among Erica Scourti's most significant pieces. In this project, Scourti uses her personal information from Google's AdWords advertising platform to investigate topics of identity, privacy, and surveillance in the digital era. Scourti's study entails recording her impressions on AdWords, Google's advertising platform that shows customized ads according to users' online activity and interests. Scourti gathers and examines the advertisements that show up when she performs different web searches for terms and phrases as part of her investigation into AdWords. By recording the advertisements that AdWords produced in response to her online behavior, Scourti draws attention to the gathering, handling, and application of personal data for the purpose of targeted advertising. She brings up concerns regarding digital privacy, the monetization of personal data, and the algorithms and systems that influence our online experiences.\n\"Spill Sections\" (2016)\n\"Spill Sections\" is a 2016 multimedia installation designed by Erica Scourti. Scourti examines identity fluidity, the intricacies of internet communication, and self-representation in this body of work. In the course of the project, Scourti interacts with numerous online platforms, including social media, chat rooms, and live streaming, through a number of performances, installations, and digital works. She moves across these virtual environments, chatting with people and investigating various facets of her identity in real time. \"Spill Sections\" explores how people create and display themselves in digital spaces as well as the fractured character of online communication. Scourti's examination of these subjects highlights issues with intimacy, authenticity, and identity performance in the era of social media and digital technology.\n\"Empathy Deck\" (2016)\nIn 2016, the \"empathizing deck\" was created. It consists of a deck of cards meant to encourage introspection and dialogue around feelings and mental health. Every card in the \"Empathy Deck\" has an emoji that symbolizes a certain feeling and a mental health-related sentence or prompt that goes along with it. People can use the deck as a tool to talk about empathy and emotional support, as well as to explore and express their feelings. The \"Empathy Deck\" by Scourti welcomes users to interact in a positive and approachable manner with both their own and other people's emotions. In order to promote empathy, understanding, and a sense of community among participants, the initiative offers a written and visual framework for talking about feelings. Scourti's interest in the nexus of communication, emotion, and technology is evident in the project. Emotions are a common form of digital communication. Scourti examines how technology affects our perceptions of emotion and interpersonal connection by combining emoticons with mental health-related questions.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nSolo Exhibitions\nProfiles of You, EMST National Museum of Contemporary Art, Athens, 2023 [solo]\nChief Complaint, Almanac Projects, 2018 [solo]\nSpill Sections, Studio RCA Riverlight 22, 2018 [solo]\nGroup Exhibitions\nSurvival Kit 13, Latvian Centre for Contemporary Art, 2022, curated by Iliana Fokianaki\nAthens Biennale 7: ECLIPSE Athens, Sept 24- Nov 28th 2021\n24/ 7: A wake-up call for our non-stop world, Somerset House, 2020\nMachines of Loving Grace, High Line, New York, 2019\nWe Were Having a Little Flirt, Pump House Gallery, group show, 2018\nGjon Mili 2017: Award Exhibition, The National Gallery of Kosovo, 2017\nGroup Therapy, UNSW Galleries, Sydney, 2017\nMore Than Just Words [On the Poetic], Kunsthalle Wien, Vienna, 2017\nFeral Kin, Autoitalia, 2017\nBedlam: The Asylum and Beyond, Wellcome Collection, Sept 2016—Jan 2017\nThird Party, CTRL+SHIFT Collective, Oakland, USA 2016\nFireflies, Niarchos Centre, Athens; 2016 \n\n\n== Collections ==\nNational Museum of Contemporary Art (EMST)\n\n\n== Authored works ==\nAltered States, Ignota Press, 2021\nExit Script, text for Athens Biennale 7 Catalogue, 2021\nMine Searching Yours, collaboration with Caspar Heinemann for Forma Arts, 2021\nOn Care, MA Biblioteque ed.

He played with the Hurricanes from 1996 to 1999, scoring 14 tries from 31 appearances, before succumbing to a knee injury. Once he recovered, Telea had an overseas stint with Coventry and played provincial rugby until 2006.\nTelea was capped five times for Western Samoa, debuting against Scotland at Murrayfield in 1995. He faced the All Blacks in a match at Napier the following year and scored Western Samoa's only try during the first-half.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Samoa national rugby union players\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAlex Telea at ESPNscrum",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Transwestern Pipeline Company v. Corinne Grace was a hearing before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) on May 25, 1990. Transwestern Pipeline claimed that Grace, an independent oil and gas operator, had a well that was misclassified by the New Mexico Oil Conservation Division (NM OCD) as what is called a stripper well under §108 (Ceiling Price for Stripper Well Natural Gas) of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA). A stripper well is a well that is marginally productive. The underlying issue was the geology of the Morrow Formation in New Mexico and the reliability of the information the oil and gas commission of one state had based its decision on based on this type of geological formation and its characteristics. Around this same time, Corinne Grace was also in the 1990 FERC hearing for Corinne B. Grace v. El Paso Natural Gas Company.\nThe hearing had a significant effect on U.S. oil and gas supply because of the number of stripper wells and their ability to supply natural gas for the U.S. economy. In recent history, stripper well production makes up about 8.2% of United States natural gas production, and the stripper well classification is the classification of a large majority of the number of U.S. onshore wells.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe NGPA defined a stripper well as essentially a well that produces less than 60 Mcf (60,000 cubic feet) per day during any 90-day interval. However, there was an exclusion or exemption for wells that had the application of what is defined as enhanced recovery in the NPGA.\n\n\n=== Enhanced recovery legislation ===\nThe following defined enhanced recovery as legislated by the NGPA:\nNonassociated natural gas (gas from different geological zones) which is produced from a stripper well that actually exceeds 60 Mcf during any 90-day production period may continue to qualify as stripper well natural gas if the increase in this well production was the result of the application of recognized enhanced recovery techniques.\nThis encouraged oil and gas operators to try to increase production from marginally productive wells by producing from new zones in the well. This in turn helped with U.S. natural gas supply.\n\n\n== NGPA Pricing Mechanism ==\nSection 108 of the NGPA gave a price ceiling for stripper well natural gas. In May 1978, it was $2.09. Section 102 of the NGPA provides a financial incentive for oil and gas operators who develop new gas production from new zones. FERC describes the application of these two sections in its concluding remarks:New Mexico has approved recompletions such as Grace's as enhanced recovery techniques under section 108 but it has not approved applications for a new onshore reservoir determination under section 102 for any well in the pool, even if the well appears not to be in communication with any other well in the pool, because the pool produced before April 20, 1977.\nThis result is also consistent with the pricing scheme established in the NGPA because the section 102 ceiling price, which applies to gas from new onshore reservoirs which did not produce before April 20, 1977, was intended to reward producers for incurring the risks involved in exploring for new sources of gas.  Since producers who drill in the pool know that if they drill to a certain depth that they will encounter the Morrow Formation, with the possibility of multiple pay zones, they do not bear as great a risk as other producers.\n\n\n== Conclusion ==\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission agree that the State of New Mexico Oil and Gas Commission was correct in its application of allowing NGPA Section 108 pricing to take place as well as to deny Section 102 pricing. Grace was declared correct and Transwestern's requests were denied.\n\n\n== References ==",

It was written by Victoria Banks, Tania Hancheroff, and Tia Sillers. Banks performed her own version and included it on her album When You Can Fly, released on April 14, 2009. It was covered in 2024 by Reba McEntire.\n\n\n== Reba McEntire version ==\n\nAmerican country music singer Reba McEntire covered \"I Can't\" and released it on May 8, 2024, as the lead single from her forthcoming thirty-third studio album. It was produced by Dave Cobb.\n\n\n=== Background ===\nMcEntire first teased the release of \"I Can't\" during her appearance on The Jennifer Hudson Show on May 2, 2024, and announced that her first studio album in five years is coming \"soon\". She debuted the song with a live performance on May 7, 2024, on The Voice, where she serves as a judge on the current season. She is also scheduled to perform the song live again when she hosts the Academy of Country Music Awards for a record-breaking 17th time on May 16, 2024.\n\"I Can't\" is described as \"a driving, dramatic, soulful number that plays as part breakup song and part ode to survival\" and has drawn comparisons to her song \"I'm a Survivor\".\n\n\n== References ==",

Many councils will also hold mayoral and deputy mayoral elections.\nElectoral reform introduced into the state parliament by the McGowan government in February 2023 saw optional preferential voting (OPV) introduced, replacing first-past-the-post. This means all councillors elected in 2021 who seek re-election in 2025 will be doing so under OPV for the first time.\nLocal elections in WA are held periodically, meaning around half of all councillors (the majority of those elected in 2023) will not be up for election until 2027.\n\n\n== References ==",

Designed to accompany the aperitif, met with success among the inhabitants of Pesaro, to the point of motivating the city's pizza chefs to offer this novelty in their pizzerias; the name of the pizza is a tribute to the composer Gioachino Rossini, who was born in Pesaro. It was only later, with the advent of \"al plate\" pizzas, that Rossini also took on these features which are still present on the menus of the province of Pesaro and Urbino. Over the years this type of pizza took on more and more variations, until it reached the gourmet form offered in large restaurants.\n\n\n== Composition ==\nA pizza of this type is initially topped with tomato puree and mozzarella; after cooking in the oven, boiled eggs cut into slices are added with mayonnaise on top.\n\n\n== Note ==\n\n\n== Related Items ==\nPizza Margherita\nNeapolitan pizza\nFour Seasons Pizza\nPesaro\n\n\n== External links ==\nRoberto Ceccarelli, Pizza Rossini: in Pesaro they eat it with mayonnaise, 23 June 2018, in Italian Cuisine.\nTommaso Tecchi, How a pizza with boiled eggs and mayonnaise became the symbol of Pesaro, 27 August 2019, in -Vice origins",

        "content": "Tripsacum lanceolatum is a species of grass with the common name of Mexican gamagrass, though as with many common names it doesn't accurately describe it fully since it grows far outside Mexico. T. lanceolatum is a perennial bunchgrass as most species in its genus are, that grows in a Tropical Dry biome. Considered LC (least concern) by IUCN.\n\n\n== Description ==\nIn photos its flower morphology is distinct from Tripsacum dactyloides who's Stigma is a magenta color (though this can vary between plants and populations) compared to T. lanceolatum's stigmas which are far more yellow-green and muted. Though this isn't the main descriptor of the plant it should be noted from photos comparing the two.\n\n\n== Cytology ==\nIt has a chromosome amount of 2n = 72, usually and is thought to be 'either an allopolyploid or a very old autopolyploid with chromosomal divergence which has led to essentially bivalent meiotic association'.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nThe distribution of T. lanceolatum is widespread with a native distribution in New Mexico, Arizona, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Honduras, and Mexico. There is also an introduced distribution in Southeast Brazil, and Jawa.\n\n\n== References ==",

Its first edition comprised publications from the period between January and March 1837.\nIt was a continuation of the former Notizen aus dem Gebiete der Natur- und Heilkunde, edited by Ludwig Friedrich von Froriep from 1821 until 1836.\n\n\n== Notable publciations ==\nAmong its notable publications were three articles by Theodor Schwann that preceded the inaugural book of the cell theory, Microscopical Researches in 1838  and the first ever translation to another language of a work by Charles Darwin (a small text on aerial navigation of spiders) in 1839.\nIn 1839, it published the first description of an oesophageal candidosis by Bernhard von Langenbeck.\nIn 1845, it published an article entitled Weisses Blut (white blood) by Rudolf Virchow, where he described a patient with multiple colorless corpuscles in the blood, a condition he named leukämie, thereby crafting the term leukemia, still used contemporaneously.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "SV Steinbach 1920 eV is a German sports club based in the Steinbach district of the Hessian market town of Burghaun in the Fulda district.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Football ===\n\n\n==== Founding and pre-war period (1920 – 1945) ====\nThe club was founded under the name Gymnastics and Football Club Steinbach in the Walk inn in Steinbach on June 20, 1920. A few years later the name of the club was changed to Sportverein Steinbach 1920 . At first, the club played its football games on improvised fields. There was no fixed venue and so the club constantly changed venues. In 1924 it was accepted into the C class of the Hünfeld district .\nAt the beginning of the 1930s, the 18-year-old player Anselm Henkel was so seriously injured during a game in Künzell that he died as a result of these injuries. Because of the death, many older players left the club, which initially had difficulty compensating for this loss. However, before the outbreak of the Second World War, a few friendly games were played against neighboring communities; shortly after the outbreak, play came to a complete standstill.\n\n\n==== Establishment in the post-war period (1945 – 1993) ====\nAfter the end of the World War, the first friendly games were played again in 1945. In 1947, Hünfeld was accepted into the B class and thus returned to regular league operations. Promotion to the A class (then the 8th league) was celebrated in 1951, in which the club was able to stay for two seasons until it was relegated back to the B class in 1953 . They were promoted again in 1956 and relegated again in 1959. In 1971 the team was promoted to the district class and created euphoria. More than 1,000 paying spectators regularly attended the home games. In 1974 the team was relegated to the A class again, but a season later Steinbach reported again from the district class . This rescue only lasted for one season, as the team was relegated again in 1976. It wasn't until 1985 that they were promoted back to the district class. A year later, the team played in a friendly against Bundesliga club Bayer Leverkusen , which was lost 14-0 in front of 800 spectators. The following year they were relegated to the A-Class again . In 1990 the club was awarded the Sepp-Herberger Medal by Werner Kiel for the work it had done, particularly in the area of ​​youth . In 1993 the team was promoted back to the district league . \n\n\n==== Several ascents up to the present day (2000 – present) ====\nIn 2001 they were promoted to the national league . After two seasons, however, they were relegated back to the district league in 2003.

        "content": "The 2011 Nigerien coup attempt, taking place in a two-day period from July 12 through July 13, was a failed coup d'état against democratically elected Niger President Mahamadou Issoufou by more than ten perpetrators, including a major and a lieutenant. The first time Niger officials confirmed the coup attempt, President Issoufou stated that \"The law will be applied in all its severity to those (who), without any objective reason, have decided to put an end to the choice of the people\" in a televised address to the nation on August 3, 2011, coinciding with the country's 51st anniversary of independence.\nIssoufou's presidency, established in March 2011 following fair and free elections, marked the end of military rule initiated by a coup in February 2010, which had ousted former President Mamadou Tandja. According to the AFP news agency, the president's efforts to combat corruption, including dismissal of officials and the creation of a governmental body to address misuse of public funds, had caused discontent within military quarters connected to the old military junta regime.\nDuring a meeting with Barack Obama, the US President reaffirmed America's continued support to Niger and other African countries for striving progress in spite of facing challenges, saying the US will be a \"stalwart partner.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

Early in his career he worked in Kansas City and Georgia. In 1966, Brown made his debut in for NWA Mid-America in Alabama working for Nick Gulas.\nIn 1969, he became one of the most popular wrestlers to ever appear in Birmingham when he formed a tag-team with Len Rossi and broke the color barrier on Boutwell Auditorium wrestling cards. They won the World Tag Title and packed Boutwell for the next three years with both black and white fans.\nIn 1972, Rossi was injured in a car accident and retired.

        "content": "Kamenica camp or Gostovići camp was a prison camp operated by the El Mudžahid, a force of Muslim volunteers operating as part of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ABiH) during the Bosnian War.\n\n\n== The camp ==\nThe camp was located in the Gostovići valley, 10 kilometres south of the town of Zavidovici in central Bosnia and Herzegovina. It was solely manned by elements of the El Mudžahid who although were an independent volunteer force, were under the command of the ABiH. The camp was in operation throughout mid-1995 and housed Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) POWs and Serb civilians captured during the four-month Battle of Vozuća.\n\n\n== Atrocities ==\nThe Battle of Vozuća commenced on 27 May 1995. By 21 July, over a dozen VRS soldiers were captured on Mount Ozren and brought to Kamenica camp by the El Mudžahid. The POWs, some injured, were subjected to acts of torture and were provided inadequate food and water. One of the POWs was reportedly beheaded by the El Mudžahid, with a surviving captive forced to kiss the severed head of their fellow soldier. The severed head was hanged on a wall in a room housing the prisoners.\nOn 10 September 1995, ten VRS soldiers surrendered to soldiers of the ABiH. After being taken to ABiH headquarters, they were transported to Kamenica camp and arrived on 17 September 1995. After arriving at the camp, the captives were beaten. During this time period, an elderly Serb civilian was brought to the camp and joined the POWs. The Serb civilian was beaten and stripped of his clothes. He subsequently died. On 29 September 1995, the ten POWs were transferred to Zenica.\nOn 11 September 1995, approximately 60 VRS soldiers and an unknown number of Serb civilians were captured in the village of Vozuća by the ARBiH. The captured Serbs were ordered to march to the village of Kesten where en route, two VRS POWs were killed. After arriving at Kesten, members of the El Mudžahid seized the Serb captives from their ARBiH guards at gunpoint. The captured Serbs were transported to Kamenica camp where the POWs and civilians (including three women) were held separately. The three female civilians were subjected to beatings and sexual assault, including rape. The POWs were subjected to acts of torture including the severing of body parts, roasting, fracturing of limbs and gouging of the eyes. All POWs captured in Vozuća were executed, with many subjected to beheading and post-death mutilation of the body. The three female captives were later released.\n\n\n== Trials ==\nIn 2005, Rasim Delić, former chief of staff of the ABiH who in 1993 signed an order authorising the formation of the El Mudžahid, was indicted for war crimes that included crimes committed at the Kamenica camp. Delić was found guilty and sentenced to three years imprisonment for failing to prevent or punish the cruel treatment captives at Kamenica camp. In 2015, Sakib Mahmuljin, former commander of the 3rd Corps of the Army of ABiH was indicted for war crimes that also included crimes committed at the Kamenica camp. In 2021, Mahmuljin was found guilty and sentence to eight years imprisonment. However, Mahmuljin fled to Turkey and subsequent requests for extradition have remained unanswered.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKamenica crimes at the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals",

        "content": "Malakand revolt refers to an insurrection by Tehreek-e-Nafaz-e-Shariat-e-Mohammadi under the command of Sufi Muhammadin Malakand Division on the basis of a demand for Sharia law. Multiple areas were captured by the militants. The uprising was quashed by the Pakistan army, captured areas were liberated and a peace deal was  negotiated. It was the first Salafi jihadist uprising in Pakistan.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn northwest Pakistan, three princely states Dir, Swat and Chitral were abolished and reorganised to form the Malakand Division in 1970. This also abolished the laws of princely state especially the Sharia implementation in Swat. During the Soviet Afghan war, many militants from this area went to Afghanistan for Jihad. Upon returning they started campaigning for Sharia law and established an organisation named as Tehreek-e-Nafaz-e-Shariat-e-Mohammadi.\n\n\n== Rebellion ==\n\n\n=== November 1994 insurrection ===\nIn November 1994, Tehreek-e-Nafaz-e-Shariat-e-Mohammadi under Sufi Muhammad led a revolt for the implementation of Sharia law in the Malakand Division. A large number of Afghan Mujahideen from the nearby areas also came to aid the rebellion. Timergara, the headquarters of Lower Dir, was besieged by government, artillery Shelling was carried out and fighting erupted in Swat. The Saidu Sharif Airport, roads multiple police stations and judicial courts in the area were occupied by the militants. The Sharia law was implemented in the occupied areas. They imposed driving on the right side of the road as a symbol of discontinuing British traditions. The militants established check points on mountain peaks to prevent military from entering. Approximately 40 persons, including 12 security force personnel, were killed in a week of combat before the Government quelled the rebellion. Pakistan army deployed combat and reconnaissance helicopters to the area. The Frontier Corps was deployed to regain control of the area.\n\n\n=== December 1994 clashes ===\nOn December 4, 1994, 10,000 members of the TNSM started rally for the release of 85 captured militants but security forces responded with tear gas shelling.\n\n\n=== June 1995 clashes ===\nOn June 19, 1995, the TNSM Chief Sufi Muhammad and 20 senior militants  were arrested following an attack on security forces. In response hundreds of TNSM cadres attacked and occupied Government offices in the Swat district wounding 26 people.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nAfter the introduction of the \nPATA Regulation, the provincial government recommended the introduction of the Shariah law. Nizam E Adl Ordinance was passed by Pakistani government which  made it compulsory for the civil courts to seek advice  of a Muawin Qazi, who was a religious cleric learned in Islamic law. But militant presence in the area led to the First Battle of Swat.\n\n\n== References ==",

Her name was announced on 8 May 2024 by Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro during the Miami Fleet Week with city native and singer Gloria Estefan as her sponsor.\n\n\n== Design ==\nCompared to Blocks I-IV of the Virginia-class submarines, Block V vessels will incorporate previously introduced modifications to the base design in addition to a Virginia Payload Module (VPM). The VPM inserts a segment into the boat's hull which adds four vertical launch tubes. Each tube allows for the carrying of seven Tomahawk strike missiles, increasing her armament to a total of 40 missiles.\nHer namesake Miami has been carried by four ships of the US Navy, most recently on USS Miami (SSN-755), a Los Angeles-class attack submarine that was decommissioned earlier than planned after she was set on fire in 2014.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Juan Antonio Parrochia Beguin (Traiguén, April 1, 1930 - Santiago, February 8, 2016) was a Chilean architect and urban planner. He won the National Urbanism Prize of Chile in 1996 and, as the first director of the Santiago Metro, has been recognized as the designer of its master plan.\n\n\n== Education and career ==\nHe studied architecture at the Faculty of Architecture of the University of Chile and graduated in 1952. The following year, he moved to Belgium to study Urban Planning. Between 1953 and 1954, he participated in programs of the Ministry of Reconstruction and Urbanism of France for Large Housing Complexes. He then studied urban planning at the University of Saint-Luc in Belgium, graduating as an urban planner in 1955.\nBack in Chile in 1957, he was hired by the Ministry of Public Works and simultaneously worked as a professor at the Faculty of Architecture and Urbanism of the University of Chile.\n\nIn 1960, he was appointed as Chief Architect of the Intercommunal Plan of Santiago. Four years later, then President Eduardo Frei Montalva tasked him with finding a solution to the recurring transportation problem in Santiago as Director of Planning and Urbanism at the Ministry of Public Works.  During the government of Salvador Allende, he was named the first Director of National Urban Highways in 1971 until the 1973 coup d'état led by General Augusto Pinochet.\nOn September 17 of that year, Parrochia was appointed by the military dictatorship as the first Director General of Metro to continue the construction of the Santiago Metro, which he had designed and supervised. In July 1975, the technical inauguration of Line 1 took place, and on September 15, the section between San Pablo and La Moneda stations was officially opened. Two months later, Parrochia resigned to focus on academia.\nFrom his several positions at the Ministry of Public Works, he participated alongside other professionals in projects such as elevated roads in Valparaíso, access to the port of Talcahuano, coastal roads along the Biobío River, and in Santiago, projects like the Circunvalación Américo Vespucio, the Mapocho river coastal road system, the North-South Avenue (a section of the Pan-American Highway), and the Kennedy Avenue, among others.\nIn 1996 he was awarded with the National Urbanism Prize of Chile.\nParrochia passed away in Santiago on February 8, 2016.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Donald Larry Crumbley (born 1941) is an American accountant and professor emeritus at Louisiana State University and current Professor of Accounting at Texas A&M University – Corpus Christi. From 1996 – 2014, he was the KPMG Endowed Professor at Louisiana State University. He is known for his work in taxation and forensic accounting.  \nHe founded the American Taxation Association and Forensic Accounting Sections of the American Accounting Association, served as President of four American Accounting Association sections, and served on the AAA council for five years.In addition to more than 325 publications, he has authored 65 books, including 13 educational novels, and 7 articles in the Accounting Review.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHe was born in Kannapolis, North Carolina, and after graduating from A. L. Brown High School, Crumbley attended and graduated from Pfeiffer College (now Pfeiffer University) cum laude; While at Pfeiffer, he was on the wrestling team and was President of the Student Body.\nHe obtained an MS in accounting in 1965 from Louisiana State University, authoring a thesis on S corporations, and obtained a Ph.D. in accounting from Louisiana State University in 1997, authoring a dissertation on consolidated tax returns. After obtaining his Ph.D., Crumbley taught at Pennsylvania State University (1967 – 1969), faculty internship at Arthur Andersen (1969 – 1970), University of Florida (1970 – 1973 and 1974-75), University of Southern California (1973 – 1974) before joining the Texas A&M University faculty (1975 – 1996) as the Deborah D. Shelton Professor of Taxation.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn the late 1980s, Crumbley began writing the first of his thirteen educational novels used in the classroom to illuminate various accounting and business concepts through fiction; many of his novels have a forensic accountant as the main character, The Big R: A Forensic Accounting Action Adventure.  \nHe employed the pseudonym Iris Weil Collett and crafts suspense thrillers, intertwining business principles into engaging plots.

        "content": "TSV Sasel is a sports club from the Hamburg district of Sasel in the Wandsbek district . In addition to association football, the club offers badminton, ballet, basketball, handball, judo, karate, tennis, table tennis, gymnastics and volleyball, with the handball division forming SG Hamburg-Nord together with SC Poppenbüttel and TSV Duwo 08.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe club goes back to SV Sasel , which was founded in the spring of 1925 and was joined in 1933 by members of the workers' association FTSV Sasel, which was banned by the National Socialists . In December 1935 the club adopted its current name.\n\n\n== Football ==\nIn 1963, TSV was promoted to what was then the fourth-class Hammonia association league and made it straight into the regional league . Relegation followed in 1966 after the Sasel team lost out in a playoff against the Harburg clubs Borussia and Rasensport . Three years later they were relegated to the district league. It was not until 1994 that TSV returned to higher leagues and in 2001 managed to return to Hamburg's top division, now known as the Verbandsliga .\nWith a third place in the 2002/03 season, Sasel achieved promotion to the Oberliga Nord, Hamburg/Schleswig-Holstein season , after the Sasel team, together with Wedeler TSV and TSV Kropp, were able to prevail against VfB Lübeck in the promotion games . In this league season, TSV reached 12th place in the table out of 18 teams, but had to immediately be relegated back to the Hamburg Association League due to the merger of the two seasons into a single-track Oberliga Nord . Back in the association league, TSV celebrated the championship in the 2004/05 season . However, due to the complex licensing process, the club decided against promotion.\nThe successful team then fell apart and was relegated to the regional league a year later. There the team came third in the Hansa relay in the 2010/11 season and prevailed on penalties against FC Elmshorn in the playoff for promotion to the Hamburg Oberliga . However, TSV Sasel finished the 2011/12 season at the bottom of the table with only ten points and 100 goals conceded. Only one game of the season could be won. After two seventh places and one sixth place in the regional league, the club was in first place in the regional league Hammonia at the winter break of 2015/16 , but missed the return to the Oberliga Hamburg at the end of the season as third in the table. In the 2016/17 season, Sasel became champions of the regional league and was promoted back to the top league. After TSV Sasel was able to finish the season in the top half of the table there for three years in a row, they achieved the greatest cup success in the club's history in the 2019/20 season when the team reached the final of the Hamburg Cup . However, this was lost 5-1 against the regional league team Eintracht Norderstedt . Sasel ended the 2022/23 season as Hamburg champions.  The team also reached the final of the Hamburg Cup again, which they lost 0-1 against FC Teutonia 05 Ottensen . At the end of the season, Daniel Zankl ended his coaching career at Sasel after nine years. It had already been announced in March that Marco Stier would be his successor.  At the end of February 2024, he resigned from office with immediate effect for health reasons. \n\n\n=== Achievements ===\nChampions of the Verbandsliga/ Oberliga Hamburg : 2005, 2023\n\n\n=== Venues ===\nWhile the first men's team generally plays its home games on the Parkweg sports field , the football games of the other teams, especially those of the youth teams, also take place on the Alsterredder school sports field of the Oberalster high school .\nThe sports field on Saseler Parkweg was a grand square for a long time . Since such a surface is not permitted for games in the Oberliga Nord , the first men's team had to use the Alsterredder school sports field , which is a grass field, for their home games in the 2003/04 Oberliga season .\nIn 2013 the Grandplatz was replaced by an artificial turf pitch.  In addition, privacy walls were built on the north and east sides of the square.  As part of this renovation, the sports field on Parkweg was renamed the Alfred Mager Stadium in the summer of that year .  This honors Alfred Mager, who was chairman of the TSV for 45 years. \n\n\n== Table tennis ==\nThe club's table tennis department consists of eight men's, four boys' and three student teams in the 2023/24 season. The first men's team plays in the Oberliga Nord-Ost. In the youth sector, Sasel plays in the performance class, the highest league in Hamburg, for both boys (U19) and school students (over 15).  The club's top player is the former German international Oliver Alke . \n\n\n== Handball ==\nIn the mid-1980s, the HSG Sasel/DUWO syndicate was founded with TSV Duwo 08 ,  which achieved promotion to the Regionalliga Nord several times, but was unable to establish itself there. When the syndicate was expanded to include the SC Poppenbüttel handball department in May 2005 , it renamed itself SG Hamburg-Nord .  With around 1,000 members of the three clubs and 55 teams, the SG Hamburg-Nord is one of the largest handball communities in Germany. \n\n\n== Notable Persons ==\nOliver Alke\nAntonia Baass\nBunyamin Balat\nSirlord Conteh\nAntje Gleichfeld\nMatthias Reincke\nKlaus Thomforde\nAta Yamrali\nDaniel “Danny” Zankl (coach from 2014 to 2023)\n\n\n== Literature [ Edit | Edit source code ] ==\nHardy Greens :  .

        "content": "HD 18262 (HR 870, HIP 13679) is a F-type giant or subgiant star located in the constellation Cetus. It has an apparent magnitude of 5.963, which makes it faintly visible to the naked eye. According to the Gaia spacecraft, HD 18262 is located at a distance of 43.79 parsecs (142.8 light-years) and is moving away from Earth at a velocity of 27.4 km/s. Considering the apparent magnitude and the distance, its absolute magnitude is equivalent to 2.79. It belongs to the thin disk population of the Milky Way.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nIt is an evolved F-type star that has left the main sequence and is now between a giant star and a subgiant, based on its spectral type of F6III-IVs. The star is 1.54 times more massive than the Sun and has expanded to 2 times its size. It is emitting six times the solar luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 6,400 K, which is around 630 degrees hotter than the Sun's photosphere. The age of HD 18262 is estimated at 1.64 billion years, equivalent to 36% of the Solar System's age. The star is metal-enriched compared to the Sun, the abundance of iron [Fe/H] on its surface is 2.3 higher than that of the Sun, while the oxygen abundance [O/H] is 2.9 times higher. Its B-V color index is 0.437, giving it the yellowish-white color of a F-type star.\nThe distance to HD 18262, based on information from the Gaia spacecraft, is of 43.79 parsecs (142.8 light-years). The apparent magnitude of the star is of 5.96m, which is bright enough to be seen to the naked eye under dark sites, far away from light pollution. The absolute magnitude, i.e. its brightness if it was seen at a distance of 10 parsecs (32.6 ly), is of 2.79. HD 18262 is moving away from Earth at a velocity of 27.38 km/s. It is part of the thin disk population of the Milky Way. Its orbit around the galaxy has a low eccentricity of 0.06 and its distance from the galactic center varies from 7.14 to 8.11 kiloparsecs (23,280 to 26,440 light-years). \nNo debris disks have been detected around this star as of 2016 and no exoplanets have been detected around it as of 2012. A 2019 study analysed the possibility of HD 18262 hosting a giant planet, in five ensembles, analysing five different compositions. The highest possibity was in the second ensemble, where the planet would be formed by volatiles, lithophiles, and sderophiles. In this case, the possibility is of 23%. HD 18262's habitable zone is located at a mean distance of 2.44 astronomical units from it.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",
