        "content": "Alfonso Ardura Altuna (1876 – 5 April 1934) was a Spanish soldier, politician, and sports leader who served as the president of both RCD Espanyol in 1913 and 1914, and the Catalan Fencing Federation between 1929 and 1931.\n\n\n== Professional career ==\nHardoy was born in 1876 in Puerto Rico. He served as a soldier in Puerto Rico, but following the defeat in the Spanish–American War in 1898, he was expatriated to the Iberian Peninsula, where he settled in Barcelona and married the daughter of Ramon Fernández Valdés, an entrepreneur in the electrical sector. In 1918 he was a member of the Consultative Board of the Circle of the Hispano-American Mercantile Union and of the Association of Neighbors of Carrer de Balmes for the promotion of the construction of the railway in 1924.\nIn the municipal elections of 1909, Ardura was elected municipal councilor of the City Council of Barcelona for District 8 in the ranks of the Radical Republican Party. Lawyer and judge by profession, he was a judge in the Courts of Barcelona, and in June 1931, he was the substitute judge of Josep Balaguer Ribas of the Sarrià-Sant Gervasi district.\n\n\n== Sporting career ==\n\n\n=== Presidency of RCD Espanyol ===\nWhen RCD Espanyol was granted the title of Real (\"Royal\") by the King Alfonso XIII in 1912, the Ardura brothers, along with the likes of Julià Clapera and Emilio Sampere, and other radical figures left the club in reference to the Radical Republican Party founded in 1908 by Alejandro Lerroux, which was not on good terms with the attributes of royalty.\nOn 19 July 1913, Ardura was appointed as the seventh president of RCD Espanyol, replacing Santiago de la Riva, who had left the presidency. He was not a man who aspired to this position, but he was one of the few respected by the different antagonistic sectors of the club. Under his leadership, Ardura incorporated former prestigious members into the board of directors, such as the ex-president Julià Clapera and \ncaptain Emilio Sampere. He also trusted the experience of another ex-president: Evelio Doncós, and his vice-president José Gaspar Hardoy to continue with the RCD Espanyol sports project.\nIn December 1913, when he was able to verify that the organizational chart was working well and that Hardoy was an intelligent man, well regarded by the members of the Board, and that he would agree to take over from him, Ardura decided to leave the presidency, being replaced by Hardoy.\n\n\n=== Fencing ===\n\nArdura was a renowned fencing master and an outstanding marksman who won several Spanish championships in Sabre, his best weapon. He used to train in the armory of Eduardo Alesson and excelled in sabre and sword modalities during his youth. In 1911, a group of shooters led by Ardura formed the El Foment de l’Esgrima de Barcelona (the Promotion of Fencing in Barcelona Society), of which he was president and whose statutes were drawn by Mario Llorens on the proposals of master-at-arms Félix Lyon d'Artiz. He was the 6th president of the Catalan Fencing Federation between 1929 and 1931.\nArdura was also a member of the Equestrian Circle and the Military Circle. In 1910 he was offered the honorary presidency of the Barcelona Hockey Club.\n\n\n== Death ==\nArdura died in Barcelona on 5 April 1934, at the age of 57 or 58 years old.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Álvaro de Aguilar y Gómez-Acebo (28 December 1892 – 22 February 1974) was a Spanish diplomatic and sports leader who is best known for being the secretary of the Spanish Olympic Committee between 1916 and 1919 and the sixth president of Atlético Madrid between 1919 and 1920.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nÁlvaro de Aguilar was born on 28 December 1892 in Madrid, as the third son of Alfonso de Aguilar y Pereira (1858–1928), the first Count of Aguilar, and Manuela Gómez-Acebo y Cortina, paternal great-aunt of Margarita Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.\nIn 1921, he married Montserrat Castro y Lombillo, who has been described as \"arrogant in figure\", being sponsored by the bride's mother and the groom's father, Count of Aguilar. The couple had at least four children Paloma, África, Carmen, and Cayetano de Aguilar y Castro.\n\n\n== Sporting career ==\nDe Aguilar was a tennis and field hockey player, winning several Spanish Championships of the latter with Athletic. In April 1919, when Julián Ruete resigned from the presidency of Atlético Madrid, de Aguilar was chosen to replace him. His mandate only lasted for one season because in 1920, he resigned upon being transferred to the Spanish Embassy in Belgium, from which he collaborated in the organization of the 1920 Olympic Games in Antwerp. At the opening ceremony of the 1920 Games, he paraded alongside Jaime Garcia Alsina, president of the Catalan Olympic Committee, and Gonzalo Figueroa y Torres, president of the Spanish Olympic Committee, in which he had worked as its secretary between 1916 and 1919.\nLater he would have various appointments in the diplomatic corps, including in 1936 as an Ambassador of Spain to the Republic of Ireland.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nOn 1 April 1962, de Aguilar was granted the Order Civil of Agricultural Merit, with the category of Commander. He died in Madrid on 22 February 1974, at the age of 81.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Avelino Álvarez Villanueva (4 November 1911 – 16 August 1991) was a Spanish pharmacist and footballer who played as a midfielder for Madrid FC and Real Valladolid.\n\n\n== Early life and family ==\nAvelino Álvarez was born on 4 November 1911 in Mieres, Asturias, as the son of Florentina Villanueva Viejo Álvarez and teacher José Álvarez Losa, who also owned a mine and other businesses in Turón, which allowed the couple to enjoy an economic position and give their seven children higher education in Madrid to keep them away from the world of the coal business.\nThree of his brothers (Ramón, Carlos, and Luis) were doctors; another, José, was an engineer, but Avelino became a pharmacist. As for the two sisters, Carmen, born in 1907, studied Educational Sciences, although she did not go on to practice, because her marriage in 1934 introduced her into Madrid's high society where it was frowned upon for women to work. When the Spanish Civil War broke out, she was caught in Republican Madrid with her newborn daughter, while her husband had stayed in Salamanca, and was then accused of collaborating with the fifth column and sentenced to death, a sentence that was commuted to 20 years of hard labor in the women's prison, where she remained until the entry of the national troops. Her other sister María de la Luz, however, was not so lucky, as she was shot in one of the checas in Madrid.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\nUnlike his brothers, Álvarez was more drawn to sport and soon revealed himself to be a good football player, so he started playing for the San Pedro CF and soon moved to Imperio CF, which was a team made up of students and civil guards, but it also served as a subsidiary and youth team of Real Madrid. In his first season at the club, he stood out among his teammates as Imperio became champions of Spain in its category, so he was signed Real Madrid, where he had few chances. He appears as a reserve for the squad between 1932 and 1934, and only played 7 league games in the first team as a midfielder, featuring alongside the likes of Ricardo Zamora, Félix Quesada, Josep Samitier, and Luis Regueiro. In an interview published in Ecos del Valle in November 1984, Álvarez confessed to journalist Amadeo Gancedo that at that time, with Pablo Hernández Coronado as manager, he earned 650 pesetas a month, while the main starters earned a thousand, a salary that in those days times was extraordinary.\nÁlvarez then continued his career at Valladolid in the Segunda División until the outbreak of the Civil War in 1936 put a sudden end to his footballing career since El Caracolillo, as the fans knew him because of his messy hair, no longer returned to professional football. Under pressure from his family, he returned to his hometown to dedicate himself to pharmacy and develop his life by participating in the social life of Turón.\n\n\n== Later life and death ==\nOn 1 January 1983, after spending 43 years attending to the medical needs of his neighbors, Álvarez retired, becoming a popular and beloved figure who continued to combine his love of mountains and hunting with playing Julepe daily and an outstanding activity linked to social, cultural, and sports movements, even as a municipal mayor, which led to a well-deserved tribute paid to him by the Turonese group on 21 March 1986, in which more than 300 people representing everything that Turón counted as associations or clubs of all kinds, celebrated not only his retirement, but a good and fruitful life. The people of Turón considered him \"a silent humanist\", always committed to his craft and hometown.\nÁlvarez died in a Madrid residence in the second fortnight of August 1991, at the age of 79.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nReal Madrid\n\nCopa del Rey:\nChampions (1): 1934\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Real Madrid CF players\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Junius Griffin (January 13, 1929 – June 1, 2005) was an African American Civil Rights activist working as the President of the Beverly-Hills Hollywood chapter of the NAACP, who is best known for his work alongside Martin Luther King Jr. as well as for coining the term “Blaxploitation” in regard to the African American film industry of the 1970s.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nJunius Griffin was born in Stonega, Virginia, on January 13, 1929. Not much is known about Griffin's childhood, however by age 16 it is recorded that he decided to leave Stonega and go to Bluefield College in Virginia. After a short time there he found it not to be a good fit and decided to enlist in the United States Marine Corps. Though little is known of his social life during his 12 years in the Marines, there is later record of his parents being happily involved in his later life.\n\n\n== Career ==\nWhen Griffin enlisted in the United States Marines, he worked as a journalist and became well known for his writing, working as the Taiwan Bureau Chief for the Stars and Stripes. Griffin's writing quickly became in high demand as he was one of the first black reporters for not only the Stars and Stripes, but also The Associated Press and The New York Times. Griffin served in the military for a total of 12 years.\nDuring his time working for The New York Times, Griffin reported on the \"Blood Brothers\" gang as well as managed an interview with an unnamed member as many black journalists at the time were able to get closer to gang disputes than their white counterparts, however there is some dispute on the validity of these reports. Griffin alongside Caldwell and colleagues like Gerald Fraser, Austin Scott, Lester Carson, Ted Jones, Wallace Terry, Ted Poston, and Claude Lewis were all reporters who reported on situations from the front lines and often worked together comparing and sharing information to get the stories. Griffin worked as the Administrative Assistant Director of Public Relations, Minority Division of the Republican National Committee for 6 months when he was 38.\nIn 1966 Griffin, who had already been working closely with Martin Luther King Jr. as part of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, gained the attention of Motown. He was hired initially for Motown Records of Detroit as an administrative assistant to President Berry Gordy and Vice president Esther Edwards, before later becoming the Director of Publicity at International Talent Management Inc. for Motown's commitment of public services, which primarily focused on black causes.\nLater in 1970 Griffin assisted Coretta Scott King when establishing the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change. He also assisted in Scott King's endorsement of George McGovern during the Democratic National Convention held in 1972 by providing a Rolls-Royce Limousine.\nGriffin was confirmed to have returned as President of the Beverly-Hills Hollywood Chapter of the NAACP in October 1972 after a brief hiatus in September.\nAfter his time working at Motown, Griffin, alongside Ewart Abner, and George Schiffer, created and became the heads of a new label, known as “Black Forum Records” and shaped its political orientation, declaring it “A Medium for the presentation of ideas and voices of the worldwide struggle of Black people to create a new era.\" Also stating that it was meant to document and provide historical materials of Black history for use in both academics and home study, Black Forum Records strived to record civil-right era on vinyl.\nOne of the most well known additions to Black Forum's catalogue was the recording of Martin Luther King Jr.’s 1967 speech “Why I oppose the Vietnam War,” recorded then released 1970 by Griffin. The label fell through in 1973 after its final album \"Elaine Brown\" as it was a spoken word catalogue and therefore did not move copies as fast as its music focused counterpart Motown. However the label was revived in 2021, being now headed by Jamila Thomas of Blackout Tuesday.\n\n\n== Controversy ==\nGriffin is most well known for his coinage of the term “Blaxploitation,” in his explanation of the distaste for the genre of movies prevailing from the 1965 through to the 1980s that Griffin believed ‘ripped off’ Blacks, and were “gnawing away at the moral fiber of our [the Black] community.”\nBlaxploitation films were a genre of film made by African Americans, for African Americans, about African Americans, focusing on urban life and struggles, with popular entries including ‘Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song,’ (1971) ‘SuperFly,’(1972) ‘Blacula,’ (1972) ‘Blackenstein,’ (1973) and ‘Detroit 9000’ (1973) with which this movie specifically Griffin himself was the executive producer. The hypocrisy of this is noted by JET journalist William E. Berry, in Jet's September 20, 1973 issue.\nGriffin was a long-standing opposer for Blaxploitation as he believed it to be a sign of abandonment of hope. Griffin went on record to say that the popularity and approval of Blaxploitation media was instead of entertainment was escapism. By allowing people to become copacetic to their situations they would stop trying to fight the broken systems, “This is counter-revolutionary because our leaders have always emphasized the importance of dealing with reality.\" He went on record declaring Black Producers as \"Front men to white society\" believing they perpetuated what 'White Society' wanted to see.\nAgreement of this view of Blaxploitation media varied greatly stuck between the opposing forces of \"Made by Blacks, for Blacks, about Blacks,\" showing depictions of Black heroes over-coming white adversary, and societal solidarity, and the insistence of morality pushed by the NAACP and CORE, believing movies like ‘SuperFly,’ and ‘Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song,’ perpetuate harmful stereotypes that destroy the communities it was meant to represent. The battle was never fully decided, as movie audiences moved on and Blaxploitation movies became a niche.\nGriffin, despite his work with King, held a separatist view in a similar vein as Malcom X. In 1967 while he still worked for the Republican National Committee Griffin spoke to Tennessee College professors about how African Americans would need to 'form a coalition' becoming separatist. Their views differ as Griffin believed they shouldn't become isolationist but stand independent as to then hold true representation in politics.\n\n\n== Awards and recognition ==\nGriffin received several awards throughout his career, including being nominated for a Pulitzer Prize for coverage of the civil rights struggle of 1963, and his work called “The Deepening Crisis” which is currently housed in the Appalachian Archives.\nGriffin also won a Grammy for his role as recording producer of the vinyl recordings of Martin Luther King Jr.’s famous 1967 speech “Why I oppose the Vietnam War,” at the Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta. with copies being released in 1970. Griffin accepted the award for “Best Spoken Word” at the 13th annual Grammy Awards ceremony; this would be Motown's second Grammy awarded and \"Why I oppose the Vietnam War,\" was Black Forum's initial debut album in 1971.\nIn 1971 Griffin was recorded by JET Magazine driving an American Motors, 140-mph AMX-Javelin, which was considered a Hollywood staple elite car.\nGriffin received a special citation from Coretta Scott King for his assistance in bringing the Jackson Five to Atlanta for the inaugurate annual memorial concert to honor her then late husband Martin Luther King Jr. His parents were in attendance as part of a celebration on Scott King's part for Griffin's birthday.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nNot much is currently known about Griffin's early home life before the age of 16 when he enrolled in college, and predictably there is little record of his social life oversees, however, later in life when Junius was working as the executive of Motown, he met and married Ebony and JET Editor Ragni Lantz. They initially met through their connections to Martin Luther King Jr. where she was covering King's speeches and Griffin was the producer in charge of the recording of King's speech.\nGriffin had reportedly 2 daughters with Lantz, one named Zenzi Griffin, who in 1993 graduated from Michigan State University with honors and a degree focused on cognitive psychology.\nGriffin's second daughter is named Pamela Elizabeth, born October 29, 1972. Her birthday is significant because by sheer coincidence she shared a birthday with Diana Ross's daughter Tracee Joy as reported on by JET.\nLater again in life Griffin and Lantz divorced for unknown reasons, separating in 1967 and being fully divorced in 1982 after a custody case over their daughters Zenzi (age 11) and Pamela (age 9). Griffin was represented by Attorney Melvin Belli and argued that their daughters had been raised black and would suffer from culture shock if forced to move to Sweden. After the divorce Lantz returned to Sweden to become the director of the Swedish Baptist Women's Union.\nGriffin's parents were confirmed to be alive and involved in his life when attending his birthday in 1972.\n\n\n== Death ==\nJunius Griffin died June 1, 2005, in Beaufort County, South Carolina. He was buried in the Beaufort National Cemetery.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nGriffin, Junius. “Hollywood and the Black Community.” The Crisis: A Record of the Darker Races 80, no. 5, May 1973\n\n\n== External links ==\nJunius Griffin at Find a Grave",

        "content": "Category 7 is an American heavy metal supergroup formed in 2023. Its lineup features Armored Saint and former Anthrax frontman John Bush, Kerry King sideman and former Machine Head guitarist Phil Demmel, Adrenaline Mob guitarist Mike Orlando, Exodus bassist Jack Gibson, and Overkill and Shadows Fall drummer Jason Bittner.\n\n\n== History ==\nCategory 7 was put together in early 2023 as a result of the members \"hanging out and tearing it up\", with Bush and Demmel having collaborated earlier in Metal Allegiance. The project was named \"after the numerical designation for the most powerful wind storms\" and \"came together from a batch of musicians who strived to play music they loved and weren't hearing elsewhere, and wanted to do so with bandmates they enjoyed being with.\"\nDetails of Category 7 were revealed on April 10, 2024, and it was reported that they had signed to Metal Blade Records. On May 2, 2024, the band released \"In Stitches\" as the lead single off their upcoming self-titled debut album, due for release on July 26.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nJohn Bush – vocals\nPhil Demmel – guitar\nMike Orlando – guitar\nJack Gibson – bass\nJason Bittner – drums\n\n\n== Discography ==\nCategory 7 (2024)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sentry Hill railway station was a rural railway station on the modern day Waitara Branch railway. It also served as the junction between the New Plymouth - Waitara railway and the main line south until the junction was relocated to Lepperton in 1908. \nThe station is no longer open but the station site still sees trains from the Waitara Railway Preservation Society passing through.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe original railway station was opened on 14 October 1875, approximately 12.47 km (7 miles 60 chains) east of New Plymouth station on the newly opened New Plymouth - Waitara railway. The station was located on Te Arei Road, close to the intersection with Mountain Road. Facilities included a Class 6 shelter shed and passenger platform, a loading bank, 40 x 30 foot shed for goods and several sidings.\nThe station officially became a junction station on 30 November 1877 when the line south to Inglewood opened. At this time Waitara was the main port for northern Taranaki, and the junction with the railway south was built facing Waitara. This meant that trains from Inglewood heading to New Plymouth (or vice versa) had to change direction at Sentry Hill.\nAs early as 1888 the design of the junction at Sentry Hill was causing complaints. A report from the time stated that \"the junction at present is very inconvenient\" and \"the annoyance and delay of shunting every train in and out of New Plymouth is great\". Consequently, a sharply-curved loop line was built forming a triangle. This allowed trains to head from New Plymouth south without the need to change direction - though at the cost of bypassing the Sentry Hill station yard. This meant trains stopping at Sentry Hill had to reverse back out of the station before taking the bypass loop to continue their journey.\nThis bypass loop was sharp (with a curve radius of only 6 chains) and was replaced with a new longer loop line on 2 April 1892. This new loop was cut under the existing road and a new overbridge was built to allow traffic to move freely. It was the first step in moving the junction station to a more suitable location.\n\n\n=== A Replacement Station ===\nThe next stage in upgrading the station occurred in 1894. On the 21st of November, a new station opened situated 768 metres (38 chains) from the old station, just south of the new loop line. This station (also called Sentry Hill) contained an accommodation shelter shed, passenger platform, water & coal services, fixed signals, urinals and a loop big enough to hold 32 wagons (plus back shunt). Good traffic continued to be worked at the old station grounds, with objections being received from J Little & Coy of Sentry Hill to the removal of the goods shed to the new site. The passenger shelter was removed from the old station. \nThe new station site was not completely satisfactory. The new station building did not have road access built at the time of the station opening, leading to complaints about poor access. By 1897 the junction station was still not completed, and at the request of residents, trains began stopping at the old station site again. It was noted that \"Waitara Branch train stops at the goods yard for goods traffic and also for coaling and watering the engine when required.\" In 1903 a new passenger shelter was constructed at the old Sentry Hill station site after petitions from the local community.\nThe other problem with the new station was that it was located on a grade, which caused issues with trains taking off from the new station site. By 1907, with the expense of interlocking the signalling looming, it was decided to move the entire new station roughly half a mile south to a more suitable location. The replacement station was named Lepperton Junction. At the same time, the Waitara Branch was extended to the new Lepperton Station, running parallel to the Marton - New Plymouth line.\nOn 25 May 1908, the new Lepperton Station was opened and the 'new' Sentry Hill station was closed. The 'old' Sentry Hill station was retained, served by branch line trains only. Finally, in 1914 the direct track between New Plymouth and old Sentry Hill station was finally removed.\n\n\n== Other Facilities ==\n\n\n=== Sentry Hill Workshops ===\nOn 30 September 1880 a new railway workshop was opened at Sentry Hill, responsible for all heavy maintenance on the isolated Taranaki Railways. The were located parallel to the main line on the northern side of Sentry Hill station. The workshops were employed 15 men and 4-5 boys by 1885.  \nWith the opening of the railway through to Wanganui and Palmerston North on 23 March 1885, heavy maintenance work was soon relocated to East Town Workshops in Wanganui (despite local protests at the move).\nThe workshops were kept open in a reduced capacity as a car and wagon repair depot. However, by 1897 it was reported that the workshop was to close, with work being transferred to the railways new Morley Road facilities on the New Plymouth port line. \nSentry Hill Railway Station and Workshops circa 1880.\n\n\n=== Sentry Hill Ballast Pits ===\nA small ballast pit was operated to the west of Sentry Hill station, with the first record dating from 1882 to provide road and railway metal for the district. The quality of metal from the pit was not of the best quality, but it was considered adequate in the absence of other sources at the time. The bottom of the pit was around 55 feet above the water level of the Mangaraka Stream. By contrast, the railway bridge over the same stream was 31 feet above water level. \nThe siding was last noted as being in place in 1911.\n\n\n== Decline and closure ==\nAfter 1908 the station settled into a familiar routine similar to most country stations in New Zealand. As traffic moved to road, the amount of traffic sent through Sentry Hill dropped and facilities began to close. The first of these was the sidings on the station's north side that had once been used for loading road metal and receiving coal (used in connection with an oil well in the area). These were removed by 12 September 1923. \nIn 1935, a new 40-foot platform was approved for the station to replace the old one that had rotted away, but on 29 April 1946 all passenger services were cancelled and replaced with Road Services buses, and the branch became goods only.\nIn 1940 it was noted that the remaining loops were sometimes used to store meat wagons for Borthwick's meat works when the Waitara yard was full.\nIn 1957 the loading bank and goods shed were removed, followed by a trolly shed and took hut in 1960 (both burnt down) and in 1962 by the shelter shed and platform. By 1963 all that remained were the two 21 wagon loops for storage and the station was closed on 22 December 1963, with the remaining yard removed shortly after.\n\n\n== Today ==\nFew traces of Sentry Hill station exist today. Waitara Railway Preservation Society trains continue to pass through the station site on their journey between Waitara and Lepperton. A shed has also been erected by the society at the former station site.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "This is a list of pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses in 2024 since protests escalated on April 17, beginning with the Columbia University campus occupation. As of May 6, student protests have occurred in 45 out of 50 states in the United States, and the District of Columbia, with encampments, walkouts or sit-ins occurring on almost 140 campuses. Fixteen encampments have been established in the United Kingdom; across universities in Australia, beginning with the University of Sydney; and in Canada, including an encampment at McGill University. \nOn May 7, protests spread further on European campuses after mass arrests at the University of Amsterdam campus occupation; including occupation of campus buildings at Leipzig University in Germany, Sciences Po in France, and Ghent University in Belgium. As of May 8, protests have taken place in more than 25 countries. On May 13, approximately one thousand students and university staff took part in a national walk-out.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n== List of countries ==\n\n\n=== Argentina ===\nOn April 25, around 20 students held a sit-in in the lobby of NYU Buenos Aires, aiming to show solidarity with NYU protesters in Manhattan and calling on the institution to cut ties with Israel.\n\n\n=== Australia ===\n\n\n==== University of Sydney ====\n\nOn April 23, an encampment was set up at the University of Sydney, in the main Quadrangle, underneath the historic clock tower. Students have been supporting the camp by donating food, materials and supplies. Chief executive of the university, Vice Chancellor Mark Scott is allowing the protests to continue, despite incidents such as graffiti that are being investigated, because protest and free speech are \"part of who we are\", noting other protests related to issues such as the World War I conscription debate and the Vietnam War anti-war movement.\n\n\n==== University of Melbourne ====\nOn April 25, University of Melbourne students began an encampment on the South Lawn of the main campus in Parkville. Protestors and counter-protestors have been regularly interacting, including a standoff where both groups stood on either side of a moat. Far-right political activist Avi Yemini attended a \"No Hate\" rally on May 3 in support of Israel. The protesters were outnumbered by Palestine protesters, including those from the encampment. There was a scuffle between him and two pro-Palestine protesters, where allegedly they had a microphone shoved in their faces and one of them was pushed to the ground by a bodyguard. An executive of the Melbourne University Jewish Students' Society, which helped organised the rally, said that they were disappointed with Yemini \"co-opting\" the rally, with they said was \"dehumanising\" to both the encampment and Jewish students, with him turning a day that was supposed to be about \"unity\" into something now \"clouded by his image\".\n\n\n==== Monash University ====\nAn encampment was started at Monash University on 1 May. The camp has since been regularly attacked, with protesters alleging they have been physically assaulted and verbally harassed. On 2 May, the camp was attacked by counter-protesters draped in the Australian and Israeli flags, who destroyed the camp kitchen and shook a protesters tent whilst she slept. Police attended, but no arrests were made, with 10 people being given a move-on direction. A GoFundMe was started to fund the repair of the damage caused. Following this incident, the Victorian Greens issued a statement calling for better protection of protesters from universities and the police. On 8 May, counter-protestors attempted to storm the stage where speeches were being conducted, with the protesters and counter-protesters separated by university security. Not all interactions between opposing groups have been violent, however, as an Israel supporter and a Palestine supporter were photographed shaking hands after discussing the war. Monash has ordered the removal of \"Zionist not welcome\" signs, saying they \"likely constitute harassment and/or vilification\". Police are investigating the harassment of the camp.\n\n\n==== University of Adelaide ====\nOn May 1, an encampment was started at the University of Adelaide. The University said that it supported free speech and lawful protests, but would not tolerate hate speech or intimidation of students or staff. On May 8, protesters were attacked with fireworks after 11pm, with a video taken by a protester showing fireworks going off around the camp, with the protesters shouting \"cowards\" as the people responsible for the fireworks were not visible to the camp. Protesters said a similar incident happened on 6 May. South Australia Police said they are investigating the incident, and the university is increasing security.\n\n\n==== University of Queensland ====\nStudents at the University of Queensland held a rally and set up an encampment on April 29, with a rival pro-Israel camp also set up. The pro-Israel protesters have said strangers came into their camp and spat on a sign that said \"Zionist and proud\". On 9 May, protesters marched to the Boeing center on campus, with protesters including Greens MP Max Chandler-Mather saying Boeing products, including planes, missiles and other weapons were \"taking lives\". A window in the center was smashed, although police have not made any arrests or received any complaints relating to this incident or any other since the protest has started.\n\n\n==== Australian National University ====\nAn encampment was started at the Australian National University on April 29. On April 30, Beatrice Tucker, organizer of the encampment, said in an interview with ABC Radio Canberra that “Hamas deserve our unconditional support – not because I agree with their strategy – complete disagreement with that, but the situation at hand is if you have no hope … nothing can justify what has been happening to the Palestinian people for 75 years”. By May 9, disciplinary proceedings had started against Tucker based on the contents of the interview, with her being provisionally suspended until a hearing on May 14. After a Zoom meeting on May 8 of the ANU Students' Association, allegations of anti-Semitic gestures, including a Nazi salute and a person putting a finger to below their nose to mimic a Hitler moustache, were put forth after the ANU Union of Jewish Students put forth a motion to address anti-Semitism. The group ANU for Palestine also alleged they were targeted with obscene gestures such as people mouthing the words \"fuck you\", giving \"the middle finger\" and making \"gagging gestures\". ANU has said it is investigating, whilst Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said that there needed to be a \"dialling down\" of debate, calling for \"respect for everyone. Anti-Semitism has no place in Australia. Islamophobia has no place in Australia.\n\n\n==== Other encampments ====\nAn encampment started at Curtin University on May 1. By May 7, encampments had been set up at RMIT University, Deakin University and La Trobe University. The University of Wollongong set up an encampment on May 8, with the protesters demanding the university cut ties with local steel manufacturer Bisalloy, which has provided Israeli defense companies with armour-grade steel. Deakin said it was investigating a staffer that was heard threatening to burn down the camp as well as incidents of hate speech, and police were investigating an altercation at Deakin.\n\n\n==== Responses ====\n\n\n===== Group of Eight =====\nThe Group of Eight, of which the universities of Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, Queensland, Monash and ANU are apart of, has sought legal advice on the usage of terms such as \"intifada\" and \"from the river to the sea\", and has said it would ban those phrases if given definitive legal advice that they were unlawful. It said such phrases are \"deeply offensive to many in the Jewish community\". It sent a letter to Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus asking for legal advice on whether these phrases violate Commonwealth law. Dreyfus wrote back stating that he does not give legal advice, noting the universities were taking external legal advice. He only stated that Section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 \"makes it a civil offence to do a public act that is reasonably likely to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate people because of their race, colour or national or ethnic origins. A person aggrieved by an alleged act of racial discrimination can make a complaint to the Australian Human Rights Commission\". Sydney and Monash urged students not to use the phrases, but stopped short of banning them.\n\n\n===== Police =====\nVictoria Police Chief Commissioner Shane Patton has raised concerns that protests could become violent like they have in the US. He said he is meeting with university security. He said the police did not want the \"existing tension\", and that universities need to consider \"how much more risk they’re accepting by allowing these encampments to continue\". Deputy Commissioner Neil Paterson wrote to the vice chancellors of the University of Melbourne, Monash, RMIT, Deakin and La Trobe, asking them to \"carefully consider the risks\" of allowing the encampments to continue, organizers disputing the risk of violence or escalation, saying the campuses were safe and that the encampments were a peaceful protest for the Palestinian people. Universities have resisted the calls for the police to put an end to the protests, with the Group of Eight saying the encampments were held on public land and that police were free to enter at any time, with the universities having acted appropriately to breaches of the law, saying they were \"in the business of de-escalation\" and not wanting to see violence erupt, as it has in the US. Police are being called \"daily\" to protests, with incidents of harassment and violence being investigated at Monash and Deakin.\n\n\n===== Labor Party =====\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese has taken a neutral stance on the protests, saying he is worried about social cohesion. Education Minister Jason Clare has expressed concern about students feeling unsafe, saying \"I want more people to go to university, not less\". He said that whilst there was always going to be protests in a democracy, there is no place for bigotry including anti-Semitism or Islamophobia.\n\n\n===== The Greens =====\nThe Greens have expressed support for the protests. The Greens NSW issued a statement expressing solidarity with the encampment at the University of Sydney on May 2, calling for the government to increase pressure on Israel to achieve a permanent ceasefire, and calling for universities to cut ties with Israeli universities and weapons manufacturers supplying Israel. Following the first attack on the Monash camp, the Victorian Greens issued a statement that universities and police need to better protect protesters. Greens MPs have attended pro-Palestine protests since the start of the war.\n\n\n===== The Coalition =====\nPeter Dutton, the opposition Liberal/National Coalition leader, has been sharply critical of the protests, calling universities that are allowing them to continue \"weak\". He said Prime Mininster Anthony Albanese “really needs to stand up and show some backbone here and call for an end to these nonsense protests\". Other members of the Coalition have been similarly critical, with education spokesperson Sarah Henderson and senior frontbencher Michael Sukkar saying the protests should be forcibly broken up, with Henderson saying universities should be fined if they do not do so. Henderson has called for a Senate enquiry into anti-Semitism at universities. On May 9, Dutton compared the protesters chants of \"from the river to the sea\" to \"what Hitler chanted in the 30s\", in response to Education Minister Jason Clare saying the chants of \"from the river to the sea\" and \"intifada\" mean \"different things to different people\". A Jewish group formed after the start of the war, the Jewish Council of Australia, set up in opposition to other peak Jewish bodies in Australia such as the Executive Council of Australian Jewry with regards to support of Israel and the weaponization of antisemitism, said Dutton's interpretations were \"a very bad faith reading\" of the chants.\n\n\n=== Austria ===\nOn May 6, a solidarity encampment was established at the University of Vienna. The following day, protesters began an encampment at the university.\n\n\n=== Bangladesh ===\nThousands of people held a protest march at the University of Dhaka on May 6.\n\n\n=== Belgium ===\nOn May 6, about 100 students occupied a portion of Ghent University. The students said the protest would last until May 8. Protesters also occupied a building at Université libre de Bruxelles. The university said they would file a police complaint against protesters after a Jewish students union head was assaulted.\n\n\n=== Brazil ===\nOn May 7, protesters at the University of São Paulo began occupying a building at the school.\n\n\n=== Canada ===\nOn April 22, students set up an encampment at the University of Alberta, in Edmonton.\nOn April 29, an encampment of about 30 tents was set up on the Point Grey campus of the University of British Columbia, in Vancouver. About 100 protesters were present on its first day, calling on the institution to divest from Israel.\nOn May 1, an encampment was built outside Tabaret Hall at the University of Ottawa. On Vancouver Island, encampments were set up at the University of Victoria and Vancouver Island University. An encampment was also briefly set up at the University of Western Ontario, lasting a day before disappearing.\nOn May 2, students at the University of Toronto set up an encampment of about 50 tents at King's College Circle.\nAn encampment was set up at McMaster University on May 5. The day after, a protest was held at the University of Waterloo.\nOn May 7, an encampment was set up at the University of Manitoba scheduled to last for three days.\nOn May 9, an encampment was set up at the University of Windsor. The same day, police in Calgary used flashbangs to remove protesters from an encampment set up at the University of Calgary.\n\n\n==== McGill University ====\n\nOn April 27, an encampment of around 20 tents was set up on the grounds of McGill University in Montreal, calling on McGill and nearby Concordia University to cut ties with Israel. The encampment has since grown to about 100 tents and is occupied by students and faculty from various universities in Montreal. Both McGill and the premier of Quebec, François Legault, have declared the encampment illegal and called on Montreal police to dismantle it. As of yet, they have not complied with the request. They have qualified the protest as peaceful.\n\n\n=== Costa Rica ===\nAn encampment was set up at the University of Costa Rica on May 1. Organizers said the encampment was built in solidarity with Palestine and student protesters in the United States.\n\n\n=== Cuba ===\nOn May 3, students at the University of Havana held a rally in support of Palestine and student protesters in the United States.\n\n\n=== Denmark ===\nA pro-Palestinian encampment was set up at the University of Copenhagen.\n\n\n=== Egypt ===\nStudents at the American University of Cairo held a protest on April 22, calling for the university to divest from Hewlett Packard and Axa.\n\n\n=== Finland ===\nOn May 6, a protest encampment was set up at the University of Helsinki.\n\n\n=== France ===\nOn April 25, students at Sorbonne University in Paris set up an encampment in support of Palestine in the university's main courtyard. Four days later, police removed dozens of students from the courtyard. On May 7, approximately one hundred students occupied an amphitheatre at Sorbonne University until they were removed by police.\n\n\n==== Sciences Po ====\n\nAt Sciences Po, in Paris, an encampment of about 60 students was broken up by the Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité on April 24. A group of students decided to stay before the police withdrew. On April 26, protesters then occupied a campus building and barricaded themselves inside the university, On May 7, police dispersed a group of students who had barricaded themselves inside the university’s main hall and made two arrests. According to the university, 13 students are also on hunger strike.\n\n\n=== Germany ===\nOn April 25, students at New York University Berlin held a rally in solidarity with students at New York University.

Garcetti's visit was postponed due to the protests.\n\n\n=== Indonesia ===\nDozens of Padjadjaran University's students conducted a solidarity action to defend Palestine on 2 May 2024 as a response to the violent act and arrest of students who protested the war in Gaza in the US.\nHundreds of students held a Solidarity Camp Action at University of Indonesia on 3 May 2024. During the action, they condemned Israel's massacre of Palestinians and demanded full independence for Palestine. A camp was erected in solidarity with the Pro-Palestine students protest in the US.\n\n\n=== Iraq ===\nA protest rally occurred on the campus of University of Baghdad.\n\n\n=== Ireland ===\nStudents at Trinity College Dublin set up an encampment on May 3. The encampment included a blockade of the Library and Book of Kells exhibition, and followed the issuing of a €214,000 fine on Trinity College Dublin Students' Union on May 1 for disruptive protests earlier in the year. The encampment ended on May 8 after the university agreed to cut ties with Israeli companies.\n\n\n=== Italy ===\nStudent protests occurred at La Sapienza and Politecnico di Napoli.\n\n\n=== Japan ===\nProtests were held at the University of Tokyo and Waseda University. A solidarity encampment was established at the University of Tokyo on April 27. More encampments followed soon after at Waseda University, Sophia University, Tama Art University and the International Christian University in Tokyo, as well as Hiroshima University.\n\n\n=== Kuwait ===\nOn April 29, a sit-in was held at the College of Science of Kuwait University, in Kuwait City. The protest involved faculty and students.\n\n\n=== Lebanon ===\nOn April 30, over 200 people gathered in a campus square at the American University of Beirut, with permission from the administration to protest for two hours. Demonstrations were also held at the Lebanese American University and other universities.\n\n\n=== Mexico ===\nOn May 2, pro-Palestinian protesters set up an encampment outside of the National Autonomous University of Mexico's main office in Mexico City.\n\n\n=== Netherlands ===\n\n\n==== Early protests ====\nAn early protest occurred at Radboud University Nijmegen on 18 October, by students demanding the university cuts all ties with Israeli institutes. A teach-in was held at Leiden University on 9 November 2023. Student protestors demanding the university cut all ties with Israeli organisations protested at Delft University of Technology on 29 November 2023. Other demonstrations followed at Utrecht University in December 2023 and January 2024. Protests were also held at the campuses of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Maastricht University, Erasmus University Rotterdam, Tilburg University, and the University of Groningen. 17 arrests were made during four days of protests at the Amsterdam University College. It was noted, however, that most protests at university campuses in the Netherlands were peaceful and without police intervention.\n\n\n==== Escalation ====\nOn May 7, protests took place at Utrecht University and the Delft University of Technology on May 7. An encampment was attempted at the academic library of Utrecht, where 50 people were arrested in the night between May 7 and May 8.\nOn May 8, a new encampment at Utrecht University was set up, which was cleared during the early morning of 9 May, but without any arrests being made. The next day, a smaller protest was also held around university buildings of Utrecht University.\nOn May 13, approximately one thousand students and staff took part in a national walk-out at 11 am. Eindhoven University of Technology confirmed that students were protesting next to a tent encampment. University buildings in Groningen were also occupied, according to a protest group. \n\n\n==== University of Amsterdam ====\n\nOn May 6, hundreds of students started a solidarity encampment at the University of Amsterdam (UvA). The next day, police cleared the encampment, arresting 169 people, and over a thousand people protested at a pro-Palestine demonstration in Amsterdam in response.\nOn May 8, new protests emerged in Amsterdam, starting in and around university buildings and later moving to the Rokin. 36 people were arrested by the end of the night. Erasmus University Rotterdam followed by releasing a similar list as the University of Amsterdam did two days prior, despite no university protests having taken place in Rotterdam.\nOn May 9, another protest was organised which again started at the Roeterseiland university campus of University of Amsterdam. Thousands of protestors went on to march through the city. Three protestors were arrested by the police. \nOn May 13, after a national walk-out, students occupied campus buildings at the University of Amsterdam. Police in riot gear subsequently ended the protests in Amsterdam.\n\n\n==== Reactions ====\nThe protests were condemned by Prime Minister Mark Rutte, as well as by various other high-ranking Dutch politicians.\nAn \"emergency debate\" was called on 10 May by the Government of Amsterdam in response to the police intervention earlier during the first protest on 6 May. Despite criticism, mayor Femke Halsema stood by her decision to let police intervene during the demonstration. Around 250 protestors demonstrated during the meeting outside the Stopera, where the meeting was held, dubbing this the \"fifth day of student protests\". The same day, the Central Student Council of the University of Amsterdam called for the UvA board to resign after the board allowed for police to intervene during the first protest.\nOn 11 May, the \"sixth day of protests\", a pro-Palestine protest in Amsterdam attracted over 10,000 people. Many demonstrators denounced the police action earlier that week. Some protesters also called for Halsema to resign. Also on 11 May, the Royal Academy of Art (KABK) in The Hague announced their plans to terminate the student exchange programme with the Israeli Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design. This was done in response to heavy student criticism. By doing so, the KABK was the first Dutch educational institution to cancel an agreement with an Israeli organisation.\nJouke de Vries, interim chairman of the Universiteiten van Nederland, said in an interview during an episode with Buitenhof that the organisation was currently working on a new \"demonstration protocol\".\nOpinions in the general population were more diverse. An opinion panel research by EenVandaag published on 10 May, including 16,036 people (of which 560 students), showed that a majority of the panel members (83%) disagreed with the methods protestors used, and 75% agreed with the police intervention that followed. A smaller majority (62%) also disagreed with the protestors' demands. However, students were much more likely to agree with the protestors' goals and demands (63%), and 43% of student panel members agreed with the way the demonstrations were held.\n\n\n=== New Zealand ===\nOn May 1, pro-Palestinian protesters led by staged a protest outside the University of Auckland. Though the protesters had initially planned to camp overnight, organiser Layan Khalil, co-president of the University of Auckland's Students for Justice in Palestine chapter, called off the encampment after the Vice-Chancellor sent an email stating the university would allow protests and rallies but not overnight encampments. Police and university security monitored the protest.\n\n\n=== South Korea ===\nA sit-in was held at Seoul National University on May 8.\n\n\n=== Spain ===\nOn April 29, more than 60 students and faculty members of the University of Valencia set up an encampment inside a faculty building. This was done with the knowledge of the faculty's dean, although she denies giving consent. Protesters called on their institution to cut ties with Israeli universities, and stated their intention to eventually move the encampment outside.\nAnother encampment was set up at the University of Barcelona on May 6. On May 8, the Senate at UB voted to cut all ties with Israel.\n\n\n=== Switzerland ===\nOn May 7, protesters occupied buildings in three Swiss universities–École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, ETH Zurich, and the University of Geneva. Police removed the protesters in Zurich.\n\n\n=== Tunisia ===\nOn April 30, students at the Institute of Press and Information Sciences held a sit-in rally.\n\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nAs of February and March, similar protests and calls for divestment had already been occurring at Goldsmiths, University of London, the University of Leeds, and the University of Bristol. After a campaign from students, the University of York announced on 27 April it \"no longer holds investments in companies that primarily make or sell weapons and defence-related products or services\".\nOn the evening of April 19, students from the University of Warwick occupied the campus piazza. On April 22, students from the University of Leicester Palestine Society held a protest. On April 26, a rally was held by students of University College London (UCL) on campus, though they had been campaigning for months. UCL Action for Palestine won a meeting with senior members of university's management, also on 26 April, to discuss divestment and propose aiding Palestinian students whose universities had been destroyed.\nOn May 1, encampments were established at the University of Bristol, the University of Leeds, the University of Manchester, and Newcastle University, as well as a joint one between the University of Sheffield and Sheffield Hallam University. On May 3, protesters set up an encampment at University College, London. Protesters also occupied the library at Goldsmiths, University of London. \nThe following week, protesters set up encampments at the University of Oxford, University of Cambridge, School of Oriental and African Studies, and University of Liverpool on May 6. In Scotland, encampments were also established at Aberdeen University and the University of Edinburgh. On May 7, protesters at Queen's University Belfast staged a sit-in in support of Palestine. Among other demands, protesters called for Hillary Clinton to be removed as the university's chancellor. On May 8, Abercromby Square at the University of Liverpool was occupied and unofficially renamed after the murdered Gazan poet Refaat Alareer. On May 9, protesters at Lancaster University set up an encampment on campus.\n\n\n==== Response ====\nOn May 9, with encampments taking place at institutions and concerns over what the president of the Union of Jewish Students described as rising antisemitism on campuses, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak held a meeting with vice chancellors of higher education institutions. In response, academics accused Sunak of \"scaremongering\". According to The Guardian, \"Vice-chancellors insist they have no desire to quell challenge or stop difficult discussions on their campuses, arguing that this is part of the core purpose of a university\". Vice-chancellor of the University of the West of England, Steve West, said there \"was no evidence\" that UK protests were \"getting out of hand\", and called on the government to avoid inflaming the situation. The president of advocacy group Universities UK, Dame Sally Mapstone, said universities \"may need to take action\" but that there \"should be no presumption universities would clear protest encampments\".\nAs of May 11, an increasing number of academics have supported students’ demands and expressed solidarity with the protests. Hundreds of university employees, including 300 at Cambridge University, have signed open letters condemning their universities financial ties with companies supplying arms to Israel. The New York Times described authorities as a taking a more \"permissive approach\" to protests on campuses, with an emphasis on facilitating free speech, while British polling indicate that \"the majority of people believe Israel should call a cease-fire\".  \n\n\n=== United States ===\n\n\n=== Yemen ===\nIn the city of Dhamar, students and faculty members of the Thamar University organized a protest in solidarity with their European and American counterparts while also showing their opposition to Israel.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of George Floyd protests\nList of March for Our Lives locations\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "TikTok Shop is an e-commerce feature of the video hosting service TikTok. Launched in November 2022, the feature enables users interested in starting a business and generating income to upload their curated products on TikTok for others to discover. Users have the option to purchase these products, which are available for a price.\nOn average, TikTok Shop purchases generate approximately US$7 million per day, totaling US$17.5 billion annually.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn October 2020, TikTok announced its partnership with Shopify for a feature called TikTok: For Business. This collaboration laid the groundwork for the eventual launch of TikTok Shop.\nIn November 2022, ByteDance commenced beta testing of the platform in the United Kingdom and several Southeast Asian countries. Subsequently, in September 2023, TikTok announced the launch of TikTok Shop, which was notably influenced by Amazon and its integration of numerous social media-inspired features into their app.\nIn December 2022, Amazon announced the release of Amazon Inspire, a platform resembling TikTok Shop, in a bid to compete with TikTok's e-commerce feature.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nOn TikTok, users can access TikTok Shop by clicking Shop at the top of their screen. Upon entering, users are presented with a search bar, a curated list of items tailored to their preferences, a shopping cart to finalize the purchase of an item they want, a section featuring popular items, and occasionally special holiday deals.\nUsers can click on a product to view its details and add it to their cart or proceed with the purchase.\n\n\n== Criticism and controversies ==\nSince its launch, TikTok Shop has encountered issues related to misinformation about products, reviews made by an artificial intelligence to promote the product, review bombs, and instances of scamming.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Dengjiatun Incident was a conflict that broke out between Chinese and Japanese forces in August 1916 during the Republican era of China in the eponymous town of Dengjiatun, Liaobei province (now part of Shuangliao, Jilin province). It lead to the deaths of 12 Japanese citizens and 4 Chinese citizens, and resulted in a Chinese apology to Japan.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1905, the Japanese and Chinese Qing governments signed a treaty (Chinese name: 中日会议东三省事宜条约, Japanese name: 滿洲善後条約) conferring the right for military occupation of the South Manchuria Railway from the Russian Empire to the Japanese. In August 1904, Japanese troops entered the city of Dengjiatun under the pretense of having been accidentally attacked by Chinese policemen while the Japanese troops were undergoing military training nearby. Despite protests from the Chinese government, the Japanese military continued to occupy Dengjiatun.\nIn 1916, in the midst of the National Protection War, Mongol prince Babojab launched an attempt for Manchu and Mongol independence. Babojab entered Inner Mongolia with his troops but was defeated by Fengtian Army general Wu Junsheng. With more than 500 of his troops killed, Babojab retreated from the area, and Fengtian warlord Zhang Zuolin reinforced nearby Liaoyuan county, where Dengjiatun was located, with the 28th Division of the Fengtian Army.\n\n\n== Events ==\nAccording to some accounts, on August 13, 1916, a Chinese child was eating watermelon in Dengjiatun when he accidentally flicked some seeds onto the clothes of Japanese merchant Kishimoto Kiyokishi (Japanese: 吉本喜代吉), who then beat the child in anger. Other accounts claim that a child was selling fish for 30 dollars, and Kishimoto insisted on buying the fish for 10 dollars, leading to him beating the child when the child refused. A Fengtian soldier in the 28th Division saw this and got into a scuffle with Kishimoto. The crowd that gathered around assisted the Chinese soldier, and Kishimoto went to the Japanese police to file a report after being badly beaten. A Japanese policeman Kawase, upon finding nobody at the local Chinese police station, went straight to the encampment of the 28th Division to settle the issue.: 198  However, the Chinese troops refused to talk, and beat Kawase instead. Kawase then requested assistance from the Japanese troops stationed in the area.\nJapanese lieutenant Matsuo Hikoji: 187  then lead around 20 troops into the Fengtian encampment demanding to meet the soldier that beat Kishimoto. During the dispute, a Japanese soldier cut off the right hand of a Fengtian soldier: 195,198 , resulting in the break-out of a gunfight. Troops from both sides were wounded and killed, including Kawase the policeman. As the Japanese troops were outnumbered by the 300 or so Chinese troops in the 28th Division, they retreated from the encampment.\nThree days later, Japanese reinforcements arrived at the break of dawn and set up 5 cannons outside Dengjiatun. Captain Iue sent a notice to county executive Jing Zhaofeng, demanding Chinese troops to withdraw from the area immediately. After discussion between Jing and the 28th Division, they decided to move the encampment outside the city limits. However, when Jing went to report the decision to the Japanese troops, Iue and the other commanders seized and Jing and did not let him leave. He was only released after trading for Jing's son to use as a hostage.\nOn August 24, the Japanese troops occupied the former Fengtian barracks, reinforcing their numbers to more than 1500 troops by the end of the month. The Japanese troops then established a consulate and police station.\n\n\n== Resolution ==\nThe Beijing government wished for the local Fengtian government to handle the affair, but the Japanese government demanded to negotiate with the Beijing government directly. Talks began with Japanese diplomat Hayashi Gonsuke on August 19, 1916. On September 2, Hayashi listed eight demands to minister Chen Jintao:\n\nTo severely reprimand 28th Division commander Feng Delin,\nTo severely reprimand the soldiers and officers involved in the incident and demote all officers of the 28th Division,\nTo issue a public apology and command all Northeastern army commanders order their troops to avoid conflict with Japanese troops,\nTo acknowledge Japan's right to station police and consultants in Southern Manchuria,\nTo hire Japanese military consultants in Chinese armies while in Southern Manchuria and Inner Mongolia,\nTo hire Japanese military instructors,\nTo compensate Japanese victims or the relatives of the dead,\nTo dispatch the military-governor of Fengtian to apologize in-person to Japanese colonial administrators.\nAfter the fifth and sixth demands were removed, the Beijing government accepted the demands in January 1917, demoting the division commander, punishing involved officers, compensating Kishimoto with 500 yuan, issuing a notice to treat Japanese citizens politely, and sending the Fengtian military-governor to apologize to the Kantou Toufuku administrator and the Consul General stationed in Fengtian.\nOn April 14, 1917, Japanese troops left Dengjiatun.\n\n\n== Consequences ==\nBecause Chinese troops retreated from Dengjiatun, the plan to encircle Babojab's forces fell through. Under the support of Japanese troops, Babojab's Manchu and Mongol forces switched into Japanese military uniforms and detonated the Raoyang River bridge, cutting off the Fengtian troops from pursuing them.\nThe incident also played a role in changing Japanese policy towards China. The Japanese government ended their support of the Royalist Party in favor of Zhang Zuolin. Feng Delin, the reprimanded 28th Division commander, began to step away from military affairs. In 1917, after a failed bid to support warlord Zhang Xun's Manchu Restoration, Feng retired to become a businessman.\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

In 1968, it was granted its own parish.  The church building was designed by George Pace, with construction starting in 1969.  It was consecrated in 1971.  It is the only church dedicated to James the Deacon.\nThe church has a large, unequal, pitched roof, with the ridge over the altar.  It has multiple vestries and a narthex.  A weekday chapel opens off the narthex, with its own single-pitched roof, and a bell turret above.  The building incorporates a 12th-century doorway from the demolished St Maurice's Church, a 15th-century font from St Sampson's Church, and a 14th-century altar slab from York Minster.  Most other fittings come from St Maurice and St Sampson, and include some 17th-century wooden carvings depicting the Four Evangelists.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "The Torments of Love is a French sentimental novel by Hélisenne de Crenne, first published in 1538, that is considered the very first sentimental novel in French literature, and had the benefit of a great success at its first publication. The Torments of Love appears as an antinovel, but without being a parody.\n\n\n== Form ==\nThe novel is divided into three main parts. The first part, which exposes a more feminine aspect, perspective, and point of view of this story, is taled by Hélisenne. The second part, written by Hélisenne, is, nonetheless, taled by Guénélic, her lover. The third part is composed in the same way as the second one. A conclusion to the novel is written by Quézinstra, following the three main parts described above.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nHélisenne, who is actually the novel's narrator, is a young woman who has been married at age eleven. One day, she notices a young man named Guénélic, who she immediately falls in love with. She firstly attempts to resist her attraction towards him, by recalling herself what terrible disgrace awaits the adulterous lovers. She recalls very well-known lovers in literature at her time, such as Helene, Medea, Euryalus or Lucretia in Ancient history, but also lovers such as Lancelot and Guinevere, or Tristan and Iseult, during the Middle Ages. Obsessed and tormented by the thought of Guénélic, Hélisenne resolves herself into loving in secret, without telling him, so she can have the pleasure of a sight on him.\nSoon enough, Hélisenne's husband's animosity towards Guénélic causes her a great anxiety, making her secret love the beginning of a torture. Despite the risk, Hélisenne starts staring voluptuously at Guénélic. Her husband minds her loving gesture which leads him to become mad and jealous about it. The husband beats his wife, which causes Hélisenne to loose two of her teeth, she explains. Following this incident, the two lovers begin to write epistles to each other, but Hélisenne has been locked up by her husband, and attempts suicide.\n\nThe husband starts to take pity on Hélisenne, and sends her a priest so that she can confess and reason herself. She acknowledges her adulterous love to the priest, and claims she loves him to death. Later, Hélisenne and Guénélic manage to meet again, and she demands Guénélic to give her proofs of his true love. The husband threatens Hélisenne one more time, by beating her. Taking a flaming torch, he inflames multiple parts of her body. Following this violent scene, Hélisenne prays and requests God's mercy on Guénélic so that her husband won't attempt murder on him.\nGuénélic now blames Hélisenne of expressing him empty words, which causes her new anxieties. The young man then starts rumors about his lover, claiming she would be his lascivious partner, which damages Hélisenne's reputation. She blames him for it, and he explains himself, but she later discovers that he continues to spoil her name by his false claims. Hélisenne is also betrayed by her household's servants, who report her activities to her husband. Deceived and isolated, the young woman's bedroom is now her only hideout, where she starts writing her mishaps, in the hope of diminishing the weight of her misadventures by writing them down on paper. Alas, her writing is quickly discovered by the husband. Hélisenne faints and her husband forces his wife to leave the city which they inhabited in, locking her up in the castle of Cabasus, a countryside residence. An old lady, her new servant, reassures her, since Hélisenne did only interact with Guénélic by looking at, and talking to him. Therefore, she advises the young woman to grin and bear it, while hoping for a better condition. · \n\n\n== References ==",

Jim Cummings served as executive producer. The film was shot in September 2022 in the Costa Brava. Faus explained his film as tackling \"issues related to class differences and injustices from a satirical portrait of the Catalan upper middle class\". \n\n\n== Release ==\nThe Quiet Maid world premiered at the Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival (PÖFF) in November 2023. Its festival run also included screenings at the 27th Málaga Film Festival and the 8th BCN Film Fest. It is scheduled to be released theatrically in Spain on 24 May 2024.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nWendy Ide of ScreenDaily wrote that the film \"combines a distinctive tone and striking visual sense with a knock-out performance from Paula Grimaldo\".\nDavide Abbatescianni of Cineuropa assessed that the film \"would have benefited from sharper, more sardonic writing\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Spanish films of 2024\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Clare Town Hall is a municipal building in the town of Clare, Suffolk, in England. The building is currently used as a community events venue.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first building on the site was a structure known as the market cross which dated from the 16th century. There were two rooms on the first floor of the building, which were endowed by the local tradesman and philanthropist, William Cadge of Bochards Farm, and made available for use as a free school in 1668.\nBy the early 1830s, the market cross was dilapidated, and civic leaders decided to commission a corn exchange for the town. The new building, designed by James Fenner, was completed in 1838. The use of the building as a corn exchange declined significantly in the wake of the Great Depression of British Agriculture in the late 19th century.\nIn the early 20th century, civic leaders decided that the old corn exchange should be demolished and replaced by a town hall for community use, as part of the celebrations for the coronation of George V. The structure was rebuilt in brick with a cement render finish, to a design by Percy Monroe Beaumont, at cost £1,317, and then re-opened as a town hall in 1913. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage of three bays facing onto Market Hill. The outer bays contained doorways flanked by pilasters surmounted by brackets supporting cornices. The central bay was fenestrated by five-part mullioned windows on both floors and there was extensive half-timbering installed in the gable above. St Edmundsbury Borough Council have described the structure as \"a unique building... of a traditional style with the front elevation of render and dark stained timber with a large overhanging gable\".  It is the only building on Market Hill in the town which is not listed.\nInternally, the principal room was an assembly hall, which was 45.3 feet (13.8 m) long and 33 feet (10 m) wide, featured a sprung dance floor, and had seating capacity of 300 people; there were various rooms for council meetings. The building was primarily used for parish level meetings; the local rural district council was based at Stonehall in Nethergate Street.\nExtensive alterations to main frontage, including the replacement of the doorways in the outer bays with a new opening in the central bay, were introduced when the building was refurbished in 1988. Since then it has continued to be used for craft fairs and other community events.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Alonso Ignacio Benito Espinosa (1720–1786) was a Jesuit missionary to New Spain.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nEspinosa was born on February 1, 1720, in Las Palmas, Gran Canaria. He was ordained at age twenty-one in Mérida, Yucatán, and subsequently moved to Michoacán. After recovering from a serious illness during a visit to Guanajuato, Espinosa entered the Society of Jesus on August 14, 1750. He completed his novitiate on August 15, 1752, and was assigned to the Spanish missions in the Sonoran Desert.\nIn May 1754, Espinosa was assigned to Mission La Purísima Concepción de Nuestra Señora de Caborca. He traveled there together with Governor Pablo de Arce y Arroyo and Father Visitor Carlos de Roxas, but returned to San Ignacio due both to his poor health and to unrest among the Caborca natives. In June, the provincial superior, Joseph de Utrera, reassigned Espinosa to Mission San Xavier del Bac. The residence there was not yet complete, so Espinosa relocated temporarily to the nearby Mission Los Santos Ángeles de Guevavi.\nEarly in 1756, Espinosa moved into the mission in Bac, where he attempted to suppress native rituals involving ceremonial dance and intoxication. This provoked unrest among the natives, and that October, native leader Jabanimó led an uprising at the mission. Espinosa escaped to Presidio San Ignacio de Tubac, and Lieutenant Juan María de Oliva led a force of 15 soldiers to Bac and put down the rebellion. Subsequently, Governor Juan Antonio de Mendoza and Captain Francisco Elías Gonzalez led a punitive expedition, which reinstalled Espinosa at Bac and fought Jabanimó by the Gila River.\nEspinosa continued to have poor success at San Xavier del Bac. In the winter of 1760, he reported that nearly all the natives had abandoned the mission. There was insufficient water, and the livestock suffered from Apache raids. About 1763, construction was finished on the new church which had been underway since 1756. Espinosa's health was poor, and he spent the winter of 1764 in San Ignacio under the care of Francisco Xavier Pauer. He returned to Bac, but by spring he was bedbound with an infected leg. In the summer of 1765, the provincial superior, Manuel Aguirre, assigned José Neve to replace Espinosa at Bac. Espinosa was too sick to be moved, and spent another year assisting Neve after recovering, but eventually he went on to serve at Mission Los Siete Príncipes del Átil.\nAt the time of the 1767 Jesuit Expulsion, he was once again in Caborca. Along with about fifty other Jesuits, Espinosa was escorted to a church in Mátape, near Hermosillo. From there, the soldiers took them to Guaymas, across the Gulf of Mexico, through Tepic, and to Guadalajara. Many of the Jesuits died on the way, but a few, including Espinosa, survived to reach Cádiz in Spain. Espinosa went on to spend the last seventeen years of his life in the Monastery of Yuste, and died on September 21, 1786.\n\n\n== References ==",

She is the 2024 all-around Asian bronze medalist.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nMatsusaka began rhythmic gymnastics at age 3 because her mother was a coach at a gymnastics club, and she began to be coached by her mother in middle school.

        "content": "Miss Grand Minas Gerais is a Brazilian state-level female beauty pageant, founded in 2021 by a Patos de Minas-based organizer, Braz Alves, to select the representatives of Minas Gerais for the Miss Grand Brazil pageant. The competition license was transferred to Adriana Macedo, who has owned and run the pageant since 2024.\nSince the establishment of Miss Grand Brazil, Minas Gerais representatives have not won the title yet. The highest achievement they obtained was the first runner-up, won in 2019 by an appointed Lorena Rodrigues, who was later appointed Miss Grand Brazil 2021 and received the second runner-up in the international competition held in Thailand.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe state of Minas Gerais has participated in the Miss Grand Brazil pageant since the first edition which was held in 2014. However, its first three representatives were appointed. The first Miss Grand Minas Gerais was held in November 2021 after the state franchise was granted to a local organizer led by Braz Alves. The contest, held on November 13 at the HZ Hotel in Patos de Minas, consisted of 20 finalists, of whom a model Malu Camargos was elected the winner. Camargos later participated in the national pageant held the following year and qualified for the top 12 round.\nLater in 2024, Braz Alves planned to organize the 2024 state competition in Patos de Minas, on 17 January, but lost the license to another local organizer, Adriana Macedo, due to the change of national franchise holder.\nIn addition to the state-level contest, another regional event, Miss Grand Zona da Mata Mineira, was held in 2023 in the city of Barbacena. The event consisted of 12 candidates, of whom Adriana Yanca was named the winner. Yanca later participated in the Miss Grand Brazil 2023 pageant and won the title.\n\n\n== Editions ==\nThe following table details Miss Grand Minas Gerais's annual editions since 2021.\n\nNote\n\n\n== National competition ==\nThe following is a list of representatives of the state of Minas Gerais in the Miss Grand Brazil national pageant.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Miss Grand Brazil at Wikimedia Commons",

Its Conservation Status is Not Threatened.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe first specimens where collected at 750 metres elevation on Antahuacana.\nPeperomia tenuipeduncula is filiform clusters adorn the stem and branches of the ternis-quaternae plant; the leaves are shortly petiolate, with a limb from the base that is acute, elliptic-obovate tip rounded or at least obtuse, and three veins; the petiole is densely hairy, while the above is glabrous. The terminal peduncle is hairy, exceeding the petiole multiple times, followed by a glabrous spike several times beyond the filiform densiflora leaf; the bracts are pelta, elliptic crenulate above the pedicellate centre, the anthers are tiny, the ovary emerges ovate-oblong, and the summon tip is stigmatiferous, while the stigma is glabrous.\nIt is a creeper plant. internodes 2.5 cm long, stem 0.5 mm thick. spiky branches around 20 centimetres long with a spicy tip. Dry membranous punctulate limbs measure 2.5 centimetres in length. Bracts are 0.5 millimetres long, flowering spikes are around 7 centimetres long, and they are 0.5 millimetres thick.\n\n\n== Taxonomy and naming ==\nIt was described in 1914 by Casimir de Candolle in \"Repertorium Specierum Novarum Regni Vegetabilis.\", from collected specimens by Otto August Buchtien in 1909. It gets its name from Tenui + peduncula, which means Thin stalk.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nIt is endemic to Bolivia.  It grows on epiphyte environment and is a vine.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Will Carl Rufus (July 1, 1876 – September 21, 1946) was an American astronomer, mathematician, philosopher, poet, administrator and instructor.\n\n\n== Life ==\nRufus was born in Chatham, Ontario, Canada, on July 1, 1876, to William James and Eliza Ann James. Rufus got his BA and MA from Albion College in 1902 and 1908 respectively. He began teaching mathematics and astronomy in Flint Michigan and Lansing Michigan after studying in Korea. He proceeded to the University of Michigan, where he earned his Doctorate in Astronomy in 1915. While in Korea, he served as University Professor of Mathematics and Astronomy at Union College, Pyeng Yang, Korea, and later Chosen Christian College, Seoul, Korea. He later moved to the University of Michigan in 1917, where he became the acting Director of the Observatory in 1945. Rufus integrated the McMath-Hulbert Observatory and was known for his contributions to the history of astronomy in America. He married Maude Rufus (neé Squire) on September 29, 1902. He died in his home, Crooked Lake, on September 21, 1946.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nHis principal research work in astronomy focused on Asteroseismology, relating to atmospheric circulation in stars of variable density and spectroscopic analysis of the composition of stars. He was one of the earliest research scholars to contribute to the new theory of Cepheid variables stars and in Stellar pulsation. \nAs a member of the University of Michigan's committee on Barbour scholarships, Rufus aided a large number of women students from East Asian countries.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMurphy, Shannon Anne (September 7, 1917), W.

The channel is scheduled to launch in 2024 by the end of June.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe brand was filed with the National Institute of Industrial Property (INPI) on February 20 with an application for registration that is currently “awaiting opposition”. According to the INPI website, the process was set to be completed by May 2.\nOn March 5, Medialivre opened a new studio with the aim of creating a new television channel.\nThe channel was presented to the public on May 3, 2024. In that same presentation, the definitive News Now logo was revealed, the O of the logo resembles the logo that the defunct Canal Nou had between 2005 and October 2013, as well as the O of the Italian channel Nove.\nThe Now channel starts “in the first half of the year” according to Luís Santana, who explains the reason for the name of the new information channel, which will be in position nine on the MEO, NOS and Vodafone Portugal platforms. The name is explained as \"News\" because of the primary content of the channel and \"Now\" because the channel's claim is the \"exact news at the right time”. The news bulletins will have a length of fifteen minutes.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Royal Pantheon of the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela is where, within the cathedral, are the tombs of two kings and other prominent people of the Kingdom of Galicia.\n\n\n== Background ==\nFormed in 1107 with the burial of Raymond of Burgundy, count of Galicia, and with the promise of his son, Alfonso VII, to also take his remains to the cathedral. This commitment was not fulfilled by Afonso VII but by his wife, the Berenguela, and continued by his son Fernando II and his grandson Alfonso VIII, Kings of Galicia and León. In the year 1211, Alfonso VIII made chapel the royal chapel in a consecration ceremony, presided over by the king along with his heir Fernando Alfonso, who is also buried in the pantheon.\nThe funerary space was installed in the \"chapel of the kings,\" today the chapel of Santa Catalina, and remained there until the year 1535, at which time it was transferred to the Chapel of the Relics. During this transfer, the arrangement of five sarcophagi was changed, which was attributed at that time to Raymond of Burgundy, Berenguela of Barcelona, Fernando II, Alfonso VIII and Juana de Castro. Historical documentation confirms the burial of these five, but only in the case of Queen Juana are there also epigraphic and heraldic testimonies from the same period that confirm her identity. In 1926, a final tomb containing the remains of Pedro Fróilaz de Traba was added to the tomb.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Lewisburg Cemetery is a historic cemetery in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, United States. Located immediately to the north of Bucknell University, and dating to 1848, it is a contributing site of the Lewisburg Historic District. There are around 13,000 burials in the cemetery.\nThe cemetery is bounded by South 7th Street to the east (from which is the only entrance), St. Catharine Street to the north, and South Derr Drive (U.S. Route 15) to the west. (St. Catharine Street is now disjointed, its layout having been altered after the cemetery's expansions. A separate section continues east to South 6th Street at Hufnagle Park.) \n\n\n== History ==\nUpon completion of the cemetery's boundaries of its original 6 acres (2.4 ha), interments from other graveyards in the town, and from Crossroads Church in nearby Buffalo Township, were moved here. As such, several early settlers of Union County, including veterans of the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812, are interred here. The McClure Monument, dating to around 1833, was removed to the cemetery from the graveyard of the Presbyterian Church on Market Street (Pennsylvania Route 45). One of the oldest burials is that of Martha Wilson, a child who died in 1788.\nThe original cemetery is located off to the right, well beyond the end of the paved Chapel Lane, once inside the main gate. It includes three family burial circles along a path that is wide enough to support horse-drawn hearses. The iron gate on South 7th Street, at the head of the eastern section of St. Catharine Street, would have accommodated them. The iron fence was installed in 1886.\nInside the gate there formerly stood a two-story arched gatehouse, where the cemetery's sexton lived. The gatehouse was moved to today's 638 and 640 St. George Street in 1892. Its archway has since been filled in.\nThe cemetery was expanded to around 12 acres (4.9 ha) in 1878. It is 38 acres (15 ha) today.\nMany of the cemetery's headstones were carved, in Quincy granite, by stonemason Chauncey Foster, including that of his wife, Enna, who died in 1908. He was buried beside her and their four children upon his death eleven years later. Foster's workshop was on South 4th Street.\nThe cemetery's chapel was built in 1899. The columbarium and fountain in front of the chapel was added in 2012. The cemetery's vault was built at the same time as the chapel. It is now unused, since graves are dug with machinery.\nA mausoleum, for above-ground burials, is located near the cemetery's entrance. It was built in 2009.\nThe Lewisburg Cemetery Association was incorporated when the cemetery first opened. The association's president is Kathy Lentz, who succeeded Nancy Neuman.\nIn 2023, to celebrate the 175th anniversary of the cemetery's establishment, tours were held.\nThe cemetery is site 9 on Bucknell University's \"Poetry Path\".\n\n\n== Notable burials ==\nChristy Mathewson (1880–1925), Major League Baseball player\nRobert Levi Rooke (1891–1994), benefactor of Bucknell University\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Piatti Ristorante, also known as Piatti, is a small restaurant chain located along the West Coast and in Texas. It is known for offering a range of authentic Italian cuisine and wines. For the last 33 years Piatti has catered their dining experience to both small groups and large private events.\nPiatti is owned by Palisades Hospitality Group.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe first Piatti was established in La Jolla, California in 1990. Soon after, 6 additional restaurants were opened. As of 2013 there are now restaurants in Sacramento, Danville, Mill Valley and, Seattle Washington and two Piattis in San Antonino Texas. Each restaurant features the same classic dishes, but the decor and menu is customized to each location in order to include both local and Italian elements. Managers and chefs are given the freedom to change/ the Piatti restaurant spaces and menus based on the city where they are established. In a 2015 interview done by the San Francisco Business Times, while talking about the designs of the restaurants, Tim Harmon argued that \"people want to feel like the restaurant they're going to is unique to the area and special and I think that's only continuing to grow ... being able to deliver that is critical to ongoing success.\"  \n\n\n== History ==\nThe word Piatti is plural for the word \"piatto,\" the Italian word for plates/platters. With European inspiration in mind, the Piatti brand name was established in 1987. The first restaurant's grand opening occurred in December 1990 in La Jolla, California. The owner is Tim Harmon, president of General Partnership. Piatti has since expanded beyond La Jolla to several other locations. Starting in 2021, with the Mill Valley location, Tim Harmon decided it was time for a change. According to Janelle Bitker of the San Francisco Chronicle, the refresh has been in the works for several years. It is being referred to as the “pandemic pivot,” and it is expected to affect all locations eventually.\n\n\n== Menu ==\nPiatti's menu features a variety of Italian-inspired dishes crafted using regionally sourced ingredients and prepared fresh daily. The drink menu includes cocktails, draft beers, and non-alcoholic options, along with a wine list sourced from local and international Italian wineries, which is catered to each location.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Qinggang (in Chinese: 清港镇)  is a town under the jurisdiction of the city of Yuhuan,  prefecture of Taizhou, Zhejiang Province, People's Republic of China.\n\n\n== History ==\nQinggang is located in the northwest of the Chumen Peninsula. It is bordered to the north by Chengnan Town, Wenling City, to the southeast by Shamen Town, to the south by Chumen Town, and to the west by Leqing Bay. It covers an area of 53.6 square kilometers, with a cultivated area of 1780 mu, and belongs to the mountainous area. The old name of Qinggang Town's sea port was \"Gugang\" (古港). It was renamed Qinggang (清港) during the Yuan Dynasty and has remnants of Qinggang Ferry. In the 14th year of the Hongwu period of the Ming Dynasty (1381), Qinggang (清港里) was established. During the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty, Qinggang Village (清港村) was established. In 1934, it was changed to Qinggang Township (清港乡). In 1936, it was changed to Qinggang Town (清港镇). After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the name Qinggang Town was maintained. In March 1991, Qinggang District (清港区) was established. However, it was abolished in May 1992, and villages such as Shangjiao, Xiajiao, Houpai, and Yuanjia were incorporated into Qinggang Town.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nQinggang  is divided into the following village-level administrative units:Qingnan Community, Qingbei Community, Qinggang Village, Xiaqiao Village, Shangqiao Village, Houpai Village, Yuanjia Village, Shuangjiatang Village, Shaowa Village, Tangtou Village, Xudou Village, Xudu Village, Saizhoushan Village, Yangxin Village, Xialing Village, Hexin Village, Tanpu Village, Wangjia Village, Fanshen Village, Fanhong Village, Yanye Village, Fanhai Village, Taishan Village, Xiafan Village, Shangfan Village, Shangshan Village, Yanggen Village, Zhangao Village, Qianzhao Village, Fangdou Village, Chatou Village, Jiaoxi Village, Xiaoao Village, Xilin Village, Zhongzhao Village, Qianlu Village, Zhujiaqian Village, Baitai Village, Xiaolu Village, Daleitou Village, Jiuzhitian Village, and Dongli Village.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nQinggang is the main production area for Yuhuan Wen Dan (a type of citrus fruit).\n\n\n== Culture ==\nThere is a site of the Taishan Village locally, where Ruan Luce, a general under Zheng Chenggong, built city walls here. Every February 19th, the Qinggang Temple Fair is held, which originates from the birthday celebration of Qinggang Niangniang Palace, starting on the 15th day of the lunar second month and ending on the 19th day of the lunar second month. The temple fair is held annually, with a Niángniáng parade held once every three years.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Additional sources ===\n\"2017年统计用区划代码和城乡划分代码\".

        "content": "The Chemin des Longs Sillons is a group of high walls specific to the commune of Thomery in the Seine-et-Marne region, built in the first third of the 18th century to grow table grapes of a local variety known as “Chasselas de Thomery”. Since 1993, they have been listed as Historic Monuments (MH) in the Seine-et-Marne MH list.\n\n\n== Description ==\nMost of the village of Thomery and the former commune of By now merged with Thomery, are crisscrossed by high walls, spaced 9 to 10 meters apart and up to 100 meters long, which follow the natural slope of the Thomery hillside down to the Seine. These 2.50 to 3-meter-high walls, made of stones held together with earth mortar, were erected for Thomery's particular espalier grape-growing technique, to restore as much heat as possible to the vines grown in this very northerly area for table grapes.\nThe Chemin des Longs Sillons is a public footpath 645 meters long and 3 to 5 meters wide, lined with these high grape walls, winding between the private gardens of the lieux-dits des Longs-Sillons, des Merisiers-Coquins, des Rentières, and des Folies. There is also another path of this type, but not listed, called the “sentier rural des Grands-Clos”, in the lower part of Thomery, running alongside the rue du 4-Septembre.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe first walls were built around 1730, followed by a second major wave in 1840 with the success of vine growing and the increase in grape production in the second half of the nineteenth century. At their peak around 1850, these walls totaled more than 250 km in length, with vineyards covering more than 205 hectares. Today, however, they are far fewer in number and the vast majority of them have no vines, serving as cadastral boundaries between the plots of private homes built in the 20th century with the decline in Chasselas production.To preserve this rural agricultural and technical heritage, on May 5, 1993, the Monuments Historiques registered the walls within the perimeter defined by rue de la République, rue Victor-Hugo, rue de By and rue des Montforts as a remarkable agricultural ensemble, representing a rectangle of approximately 500 meters in length and 150 meters in width. For the most part, they are on private property, but the commune has created a public passageway called “Chemin des Longs Sillons”, starting near Thomery town hall and running through the middle of this perimeter from rue de la République to rue de By over a total length of 645 meters.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPeach wall\nChasselas de Thomery\nMonument historique\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Daniel Januske (1661–1724; also Januusqui, Jarniuke) was a Jesuit missionary in New Spain.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nJanuske was born in 1661 in Wrocław, Silesia, and joined the Society of Jesus at the age of fifteen. He arrived in New Spain in 1693, in a group of missionaries which included Agustín de Campos and Juan Bautista Barli.  There he was assigned to Mission San Pedro y San Pablo del Tubutama, where he repeatedly employed soldiers and overseers to punish natives who disobeyed or displayed resistance. Historian Brandon Bayne characterizes this practice as a \"crucial contributing factor[...] if not the immediate cause\" of the 1695 Pima Revolt.\nBy 1715, Januske was serving at Mission San Miguel Arcángel de Oposura. There, he clashed repeatedly with local vecinos Bernardo and Juan Grivalja over issues of land rights and cattle ranching. In one incident, Bernardo called Januske a drunkard and accused him of monopolizing local farmland and of forcing natives to do unpaid labor for him instead of working their own land; on another occasion, Januske flogged Juan's native father-in-law for failing to attend Mass, and both Grivalja brothers confronted him, shouting threats and insults. Januske was eventually able to persuade the local alcalde mayor to expel the Grivaljas from the pueblo.\nIn 1722, Januske was appointed visitador of Sonora. He died in 1724 in Oposura.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Babyxsosa (born June 2000) is an American rapper and singer. She joined the hip hop collective Surf Gang in 2019 before leaving in 2021. Her breakout 2019 song \"Everywhereigo\" went viral on TikTok. In 2023, she released the synth-punk extended play (EP) Bling Bling and a self-titled electropop EP. Her underground, lo-fi trap songs have been noted for her high-pitched voice.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nBabyxsosa was born in June 2000 in Richmond, Virginia. She began writing songs while in elementary school and learned to read music after she began playing the oboe in middle school. She was a cheerleader for 14 years and became interested in visual arts and SoundCloud after getting injured while cheering. She started producing music and DJing while in high school. After graduating, she had plans to attend Virginia Commonwealth University for graphic design and work as an animation intern in New York City but did not get accepted to the university.\nBabyxsosa self-released her debut single \"Beat My Ass\" in 2018. She joined the musical collective Surf Gang in 2019. Her song \"Everywhereigo\" was released in February 2019 and became her breakout song after going viral on TikTok during the COVID-19 pandemic. Several months after Surf Gang's debut live performance in Los Angeles in March 2021, Babyxsosa announced that she would be leaving the collective. According to Yousef Srour of Stereogum, Babyxsosa was \"Surf Gang’s most popular rapper\" by the time she left, due to the virality of \"Everywhereigo\". Her single \"Running\" was released in July 2021 and her song \"Girlfriend\" was uploaded to SoundCloud in December 2022. She released the extended play (EP), Bling Bling, in July 2023. Her self-titled EP was released in November 2023, where in the cover the artist is partially nude in one of Kanye West's recording studio for the Vultures 1 album.  The artist was also shouted out in Playboicarti and A$AP Rocky's unreleased song \"Sights\". \nAs a model, Babyxsosa appeared in MCM Worldwide's #MCMEverywhereIGo campaign alongside Frankie Jonas in April 2021, which was soundtracked by her song \"Everywhereigo\". She also appeared in a campaign for a collaboration between Marni and Carhartt with Bootsy Collins and his family in January 2023.\nBabyxsosa has been cosigned by artists like Kanye West after takig\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nBabyxsosa's music has been described as lo-fi trap, SoundCloud rap, underground hip hop, and plugg. Her EP Bling Bling experimented with synth-pop, synth-punk, and industrial techno, while her self-titled EP was chamber pop and electropop. Her voice has been described as high-pitched. Grammy.com's Yousef Srour called her voice \"dainty\" and \"autotuned\" and her music \"lush\", also writing that her \"simple lyrics\" were about \"feelings of desire and despair\".\nThe artist is multi-faceted in having skills of reading sheet music and playing the oboe and is not strictly a rapper. The EP Bling Bling is noy just an experiemental album but a proof of her range as an artist. \n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Niederschlesische Fußballverein Gelb-Weiß Görlitz (English: Lower Silesian Football Club Yellow-White Görlitz) is a German football club from Görlitz, in the Lower Silesian Upper Lusatia. The home ground of the club, which has 250 members, is the Junge Welt Stadium (English: Young World Stadium).\n\n\n== History ==\nGelb-Weiß Görlitz was founded in 1909 as Sportclub Wanderslust. By 1910, the club was renamed Fußballclub Union. With the establishment of an athletics department in 1913, the club competed under the name Sportclub Union.\nSpVgg Gelb-Weiß Görlitz was established in 1923 when the football department of ATV 1847 Görlitz separated from the gymnastics club and formed an independent club as part of the \"clean separations\" ordered by the umbrella associations. Major games were played at Schenkendorffplatz in the part of the city which is now part of Poland (current venue of the club Nysa Zgorzelec). In 1914, the club moved to its own field on the corner of Reichenbacher Straße/Kaiserring (today Rosa-Luxemburg-Straße), which was demolished during World War I. In 1928, 1931, and 1932, the club, now based in the Groß Biesnitz neighbourhood, became Upper Lusatian champions and thus qualified for the participation in the south-east German finals. In 1933, Gelb-Weiß Görlitz failed to qualify for the newly introduced Silesian Gauliga and subsequently played in the second-tier Lower Silesian Bezirksliga. By finishing 1st in group 2 of the 1940–41  Bezirksliga Niederschlesien, Görlitz qualified for the district championship final, which they lost to WSV Liegnitz, but were however promoted to the newly created Lower Silesian Gauliga. However, Görlitz withdrew completely from competitive play in the first Gauliga season, the 1941–42 Gauliga Niederschlesien.\nIn 1945, the club was revived as SG Görlitz-West west of the Lusatian Neisse river. Subsequently, the club was renamed SG Vorwärts Görlitz from 1948 and BSG Motor Görlitz from 1951. The conditions for football improved with the involvement of the local enterprise called \"Waggonbau Görlitz\". In 1958, Görlitz achieved promotion to the II. DDR-Liga. In the first season, promotion was narrowly missed, finishing behind Chemnitzer FC. After a total of four seasons in the third tier of the East German pyramid, BSG Motor WAMA Görlitz, as the club was known from 1965, mostly played at the regional level in the Dresden district leagues. In 1965 and 1977, the club was promoted to the DDR-Liga. However, Görlitz found this level too challenging and was relegated back to the Bezirksliga Dresden along with Fortschritt Weißenfels and Dynamo Lübben in both years.\nAfter the reunification, NSV Gelb-Weiß Görlitz was re-founded on 2 July 1991. They played in the Bezirksliga Dresden from 1991 to 2000 for ten years. On 1 January 1, 1999, the football department separated from the parent NSV and has since played as NFV Gelb-Weiß Görlitz. In 2000 they won promotion to the Landesliga Sachsen.\nIn September 2016, NFV Gelb-Weiß Görlitz withdrew its first team from Landesliga operations with immediate effect and thus became the first relegated club of the 2016–17 season. The reasons for this were investigations against the board and the arrest of two foreign players who were officially eligible to play.\n\n\n== Honours and achievements ==\n3x Participation in the DDR-Liga: 1965–66, 1977–78\n4x Participation in the II.

        "content": "Tim Turner (born January 27, 1969) is an American former professional stock car racing driver who has previously competed in the ARCA Racing Series, primarily driving for K&K Racing.\n\n\n== Racing career ==\nIn 2001, Turner made his debut in the ARCA Re/Max Series at Winchester Speedway, driving the No. 6 Chevrolet for Wayne Peterson Racing, where he finished in fifteenth after starting in 25th. He then made four more starts for Peterson that year, getting a best finish of twelfth at Salem Speedway. He ran eight more races for Peterson the following year, where he had a best finish of 30th in his first race of the year at Atlanta Motor Speedway. In 2003, Turner ran three more races for Peterson, getting a best finish of 24th at Atlanta before driving for Norm Benning Racing at the DuQuoin State Fairgrounds dirt track, where he finished in 36th due to engine issues, and for DMW Motorsports at Lowe's Motor Speedway, where he failed to qualify.\nIn 2004, Turner joined K&K Racing in the No. 79 for a majority of the races held that year, including one start for Benning at Lake Erie Speedway, and another for DGM Racing at Charlotte. Across the year, he failed to qualify for eight races, got a best finish of sixteenth in his first start at Salem, and finished eighteenth in the final points standings. He then solely drove for K&K Racing for the following year in 2005, this time running the full schedule, where he finished nineteenth in the points with a best finish of seventeenth at Pocono Raceway. However, he failed to qualify for ten races, including the first five races of the season. In 2006, Turner only attempted one race at Pocono, this time driving the No. 87 Chevrolet, where he ultimately failed to qualify. He then ran the No. 21 Pontiac at Pocono, where he finished 36th due to overheating issues, and then ran the No. 7 Chevrolet for Bobby Gerhart Racing at the Illinois State Fairgrounds dirt track, where he once again finished 36th, this time due to handling issues.\nAfter not racing in the series from 2008 to 2011, during which time he served as a spotter for K&K Racing, Turner returned at Chicagoland Speedway in 2012, this time driving the No. 3 Chevrolet for K&K, where he started and finished 30th after running only five laps due to handling issues. He has not competed in the series since then.\n\n\n== Motorsports results ==\n\n\n=== ARCA Racing Series ===\n(key) (Bold – Pole position awarded by qualifying time.

Located just north of the settlement, Today Hellenic Train operates just two daily regional trains to Alexandroupoli.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe railway was an important link during World War I as the Ottoman Empire, Bulgaria, and Austria-Hungary were all Central Allies. After the Ottoman Empire's defeat, its remaining imperial possessions were divided. The sections from Alexandroupoli to Svilengrad, except for a short section of about 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) in Turkey serving Edirne Karaagaç station and for 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) between the Greek border and Svilengrad station in Bulgaria come under the control of the French-Hellenic Railway Company (CFFH), a subsidiary of the CO, when the CFFH was incorporated in July 1929.\nUnder the Treaty of Lausanne of 1923, a new border between Greece and Turkey was established at the Evros river, just east of Ftelia railway station, which had the result that the railway from Istanbul to Bulgaria entered Greece at Pythio, then re-entered Turkey at Edirne (Karaağaç railway station), re-entered Greece at Marasia, and finally entered Bulgaria between Ormenio and Svilengrad.  This arrangement continued until 1971 when two new lines were opened. In Turkey, the Edirne Cut-off was opened to allow trains from Istanbul to Bulgaria to run through Edirne entirely on Turkish territory so that trains such as the Orient Express no longer passed through Feres. In Greece, a line was opened to allow trains from Pythio to Bulgaria to stay on Greek territory and avoid Edirne. In 1954 the CFFH was absorbed by the Hellenic State Railways. In 1971, the Hellenic State Railways was reorganised into the OSE taking over responsibilities for most for Greece's rail infrastructure.\nAt the same time, in 1971, SEK designed and constructed a 9 km (5.6 mi) direct connection between Nea Vyssa and Marasia within the Greek borders, thus avoiding Turkish territory and bypassing Karaağaç and with a new intermediate station at Kastanies.\nIn the 1990s, OSE introduced the InterCity service to the Alexandroupoli–Svilengrad line Which reduced travel times across the whole line.\nin 2017, limerted works where carreid out at the station, the buildings where painted, and the platform was paved.\nIn 2020 it was announced that the section of line between Pythio and Ormenio was to be upgraded, at the cost of €1.4 million as part of an ambitious integrated intergovernmental transport plan which will see this, and 39 other transport sector projects be built, with financing from the European Commission with a total of €117 million. The package of measures aims to build or improve transport connections and connectivity across Europe, with a focus on sustainable transport. The project for the Pythian-Ormenio section envisions upgrading the existing line infrastructure and trackbed, doubling of the track as well as the installation of electrification signalling (ETCS Level 1) along the entire stretch, with the aim of improving freight transport with Bulgaria and Turkey.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\nThe station is housed in a small 1970s building that houses a waiting shelter. Beside this, the station has no other facilities. The platform, which is long for this region, has no outside seating, Dot-matrix display departure and arrival screens, nor timetable poster boards for passenger information; the station remains little more than an unstaffed halt.\n\n\n== Services ==\nAs of 2020, the stop is only served by one daily pair of regional trains Alexandroupoli–Ormenio. There are currently no services to Svilengrad.\n\n\n== Line layout ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Daniel C. Roberts Hall (commonly known as Roberts Hall or Main College; also known as Old Main) is the oldest residence hall on the Bucknell University campus in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, United States. It is located on College Hill in the center of the campus, on the northern side of a quadrangle also consisting of Rush H. Kress Hall to the west, Harland A. Trax Hall to the east, and the Carnegie Building to the south. The building is located on South 7th Street, which leads to and from downtown Lewisburg. Beyond its northern side, at the foot of the Grove, University Avenue was the former main approach road to the campus. The 1905 Memorial Gateway is still in place.\nDesigned by Thomas U. Walter, Old Main was built in 1858, when the institution was named the University at Lewisburg. The university was renamed Bucknell University in 1886, honoring its major benefactor William Bucknell.\nAfter Old Main was damaged by fire in 1932, it was rebuilt between 1935 and 1937 and renamed for university trustee Daniel C. Roberts.\nThe building underwent a $15 million renovation in 2016.\nToday, the building offers housing for the university's sophomore students.\n\n\n== References ==",

It is open March through November, and offers visitors casual dining on the canal walkway.\n\n\n== Location ==\n\nThe path along the canal is called a towpath, hence the name of the cafe.    \n\nThe cafe itself is located inside of four kiosks on the towpath between Whitmore Road and Kingsland High Street in De Beauvoir Town. In 2010, the cafe started out as three shallow units, but has since expanded. Each kiosk serves as a different section of the cafe: kitchen, bar, seating, and larder. Weather permitting, there is additional outdoor seating available.\n\n\n== Food ==\n\nThe cafe serves breakfast, brunch, lunch, and pastries. Their menu features Mediterranean and British-inspired dishes prepared using locally sourced, seasonal ingredients.\n\n\n== Owners ==\nLaura Jackson, co-owner and chef at Towpath, received her diploma from Leith's Cookery School in London. Before starting Towpath, Jackson worked at Melrose & Morgan and Rochelle Canteen. \nLori de Mori, co-owner of Towpath, met Jackson while visiting the hotel Auberge de Chassignolles in Auvergne, France. De Mori asked Jackson to partner with her to create Towpath. Since then, de Mori has been working front of house while Jackson works back of house.\nJackson and de Mori launched a series of podcast episodes detailing their founding and operating Towpath. \n\n\n== Cookbook ==\nIn October 2020, Jackson and de Mori published Towpath: Recipes and Stories, a cookbook that details Towpath Cafe's culinary offerings and background. Each chapter is marked by a month in which the cafe is open.  \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "American rapper Megan Thee Stallion is scheduled to release her upcoming third studio album in 2024. It is Megan's first album to be released under her independent label Hot Girl Productions, after her departure from her former label 300 Entertainment and 1501 Certified. It will be preceded by three singles: \"Cobra\", \"Hiss\", and \"Boa\". To promote the album, Megan will embark on the Hot Girl Summer Tour, her first headlining concert tour.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn October 19, 2023, 1501 Certified revealed that the company and Megan Thee Stallion has mutually parted ways with each other. Shortly after, Megan clarified on an Instagram livestream, stating that her album would be self-funded and \"the budget is coming from me\".\nConceptually, based on the imagery and the single titles, the as-yet-untitled album reportedly follows a snake-based theme. On October 23, Megan posted on her social media a teaser of her upcoming album stating \"Just as a snake sheds it skin, we must shed our past, over and over again\". On February 2, 2024, Megan signed a distribution deal with Warner Music Group which would allot her the creative control of an independent artist, but the access to the company's resources.\n\n\n== Release and promotion ==\nOn January 30, 2024, Megan Thee Stallion did an interview with Good Morning America, revealing that she planned to tour for that upcoming summer season. On March 20, Megan formally announced the Hot Girl Summer Tour that is set to begin May 14 in Minneapolis and conclude July 27 in Washington, D.C.\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nThe album's lead single, \"Cobra\" was released on November 3, 2023, alongside a music video directed by Douglas Bernardt. Five days later, Megan released a rock remix of \"Cobra\" with the Canadian-American alternative metal band Spiritbox. The single debuted and peaked at number 32 on the US Billboard Hot 100.\nThe second single, \"Hiss\", was released on January 26, 2024, alongside a music video also directed by Douglas Bernardt. \"Hiss\" debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Megan's first solo chart-topping single and third overall. It also debuted at number one on the Billboard Global 200, making Megan the first female rapper in a lead role to debut atop the chart in history.\nThe third single, \"Boa\", was released on May 10, 2024.\n\n\n== References ==",

Askia Mohammad also created the position of Kurmina-fari (often shortened to Kanfari) for him. Two years later Umar re-built the town of Tindirma to serve as his capital. During the Askia's pilgrimage to Mecca, Umar ruled the empire loyally and competently in his absence.\nIn 1512 Umar defeated and killed the Fula leader Tenguella after a 2-month march through the desert, bringing the Kingdom of Diarra into the Songhai sphere of influence.\nUmar's family became a pillar of the royal clan of Songhai, and his son Mohammad Benkan Kirya ruled as Askia from 1531 to 1537.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nGomez, Michael (2018).

        "content": "Charles Smith Hempstead (Sep. 10, 1794 - Dec. 10, 1874) was a businessman, lawyer, and mayor from the U.S. State of Illinois. He is credited for serving as the first mayor of the city of Galena in Jo Daviess County. He was a promoter of the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad and was the younger brother of Missouri Territory House Representative Edward Hempstead.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nCharles was born in Hebron, Connecticut on September 10, 1794 from American Revolutionary War veteran Stephen Hempstead Sr. and his mother Marry Lewis. In 1809 at the age of fifteen he left his school at the New London Academy in Forest, Virginia for St. Louis. After his arrival he would study law for many years under his elder brother and House Representative Edward Hempstead, until his death in 1817 from a horse accident, aged 37.\nIn the 1820s and 1830s Charles traveled throughout Illinois and the Missouri Territory before settling in Galena, IL. In January, 1834 he married Eliza Barnes and they had two children. By April 26, 1841 Galena was granted its charter. During that same period on May 24th a mayoral election was held by the board of trustees in which three candidates ran. Charles, H. H. Gear, and Daniel Wann. The results showed a turnout of 356 voters, of which Charles received 185, resulting in him becoming Galena's first mayor. He would serve until 1845.\nBefore his mayoral term, in 1840 Charles became an attorney partner with Harvard Law School graduate Elihu B. Washburne up until Washburne was elected to serve as a congressman for Illinois in 1852.\nWhen the American Civil War broke out Charles was given the position of Assistant Paymaster of the Army by President Abraham Lincoln in 1861. He would work under Paymaster-General of the United States Army Timothy Andrews and Benjamin Brice until the wars end. In addition, let it be known that despite Charles support for the  Northern Union, he had a mixed view on slavery and may have taken the position as a business venture instead of a moral service.\n\nCharles spent the rest of his days in Galena as a prominent lawyer and member of the Early Settler's Association until his death on December 10, 1874 at age 80. His law and business partner Elihu B. Washburne had this to say about his passing in a letter from January 15, 1875. \"I have felt it to be fitting that a tribute should be paid to the memory of a man who was a connecting link with the age gone by, and whose career was so interwoven not only with the history of our immediate locality, but with the earlier settlement of the west and northwest.\"\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nCharles left an everlasting effect in Galena and Jo Daviess County, his original home and office still stands near the city's downtown and the Galena River at 611 South Bench Street.  The Hempstead family among other local historical fugures are a prominent part of the Galena Historical Society's annual cemetery walk since 1994.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Craig G. Harris (April 8, 1958 – November 26, 1991) was an African-American writer, poet, health educator, and HIV/AIDS activist.\n\n\n== Life ==\nHarris was born on April 8, 1958, in the South Bronx, New York. He studied English and Education at Vassar College, graduating in 1980.\nHarris was HIV positive during his time as an activist. He was diagnosed with pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma in January 1991 and died on November 26, 1991. He was 33 years old.\n\n\n== Activism ==\nHarris began his AIDS/HIV activism when he moved to Washington, D.C. in 1986. He worked with the National Coalition of Black Lesbian and Gays (NCBLG) to organize the  first National Conference on AIDS in the Black Community at the D.C. convention center in July 1986. This conference included over 400 people from all over the country who wanted to discuss how to address the impact of the AIDS epidemic within the Black community.\nIn 1987, the American Public Health Association held their annual convention with, for the first time, a focus on HIV/AIDS. Despite the disproportionate impact of AIDS on the Black community, particularly on Black gay men, they did not involve any panelists of color. During the conference, Harris rushed onto the panel and took the microphone while shouting, \"I will be heard.\" He announced the formation of the National Minority AIDS Council to address HIV/AIDS in communities of color where the government would not. \nThe National Minority AIDS Council was founded in 1987 by Harris and other activists, including Paul Kawata, Calu Lester, Don Edwards, Suki Ports, Timm Offutt, Norm Nickens, Carl Bean, Gilberto Gerald, Marie St.-Cyr, and Sandra McDonald. \nHarris worked with the National Minority AIDS Council and the Spectrum AIDS Project in Washington, D.C. until 1988, when he moved to New York to work as the Executive-Director of the Minority Task Force on AIDS.\nThe last position that he held was with the Gay Men's Health Crisis (GMHC), an organization that still assists and advocates for gay men with HIV/AIDS, particularly gay Black men. \nHarris' work involved sexual health education, with a focus on helping people of color. \n\n\n== Writing ==\nHarris was a prominent writer and journalist in the Black gay community of the 80s and 90s. His articles, and essays were published in places like the NCBLG's Black/Out magazine, The Advocate, Ebony, Gay Community News, New York Native, Outweek, and The Washington Blade.\nHarris was involved in the \"Other Countries\" writers collective in New York.\n\n\n=== Poetry and stories in anthologies (selected) ===\nIn the Life: A Black Gay Anthology, Joseph Beam, 1986\nNew Men New Minds: Breaking Male Tradition, Franklin Abbott, 1987\nTongues Untied (Gay Verse), Dirg Aab-Richards, 1987\nThe Road Before Us: 100 Gay Black Poets, Assotto Saint, 1991\nBrother to Brother: New Writings by Black Gay Men, Exxex Hemphill & Dorothy Beam, 1991\nFreedom in this Village: Twenty-Five Years of Black Gay Men's Writing, E. Lynn Harris, 2005\nPersistent Voices: Poetry by Writers Lost to AIDS, David Groff & Philip Clark, 2010\n\n\n=== Other works (selected) ===\nI'm Going to Go Out Like a Fucking Meteor! (Biographical essay)\nBlack, Gay, and Proud (article in VENUS magazine, 1997)\nHope Against Hope (unfinished final volume of poetry)\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe Craig G. Harris Papers, 1986-1993 is a collection of Harris' poetry, articles, speeches, essays, and personal documents hosted by the New York Public Library. In addition, recordings of Harris's memorial service after his death and recordings from his life are held by the New York Public Library Manuscripts and Archives. A photograph of his dedicated AIDS memorial quilt, along with several other photographs from his life, are also included in the collection. \nOn June 27, 2017, the Counter Narrative Project hosted several events in Atlanta, Oakland, and Washington, D.C. for their I Will Be Heard National Day of Action in honor of Craig G. Harris and to commemorate National HIV Testing Day, including a theatre production by the Brave Souls Collective in D.C.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHIV/AIDS activism\nLGBT Movements in the United States\nNational Minority AIDS Council\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCraig G.

        "content": "Pratt Cates Remmel (born Little Rock, Arkansas, October 26, 1915; died May 14, 1991) was an American politician, businessman, and public servant. He is best known for serving two terms as the mayor of Little Rock (1952–1956), the first Republican elected to the office since 1887, and for his run for governor of Arkansas in 1954 against Orval Faubus.\n\n\n== Early life and family ==\nThe Remmel family was deeply involved in Republican party politics in Arkansas. Pratt Remmel's great uncle Harmon L. Remmel, a businessman and banker, was first a lieutenant of party boss Powell Clayton and then, from about 1913 to his death in 1927, controlled the party himself. Pratt Remmel's father Augustus C. Remmel (1882–1920) was a leader of the \"Lily-white movement\" among Arkansas Republicans and sometimes clashed with his uncle; he was chairman of the state Republican committee at the time of his death at the age of 38. His mother Ellen \"Nell\" (Cates) Remmel (1888–1961) served on the national Republican committee for many years.\nPratt Remmel's father died when he was five years old; he and his five brothers and sisters were raised by their mother. Remmel graduated from Little Rock High School in 1933 and went on to the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia, earning a BA in economics there in 1937.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nReturning to Arkansas, Remmel immediately entered politics, running unsuccessfully for the Little Rock city council in 1938. In 1940 he became  a member of the Pulaski County Republican Party executive committee, the first of many positions he was to hold in the Arkansas Republican Party. On June 15, 1940, he married Catherine Crouch (1918–2006), daughter of powerful Arkansas businessman Harvey C. Couch.\nAfter serving as a Navy flight instructor during World War II and building an insurance business after the war, Remmel ran for mayor of Little Rock in 1951 and trounced two-term Democratic mayor Sam Wassell, who had broken local tradition by running for a third term. Remmel was re-elected in 1953.\nRemmel was the Republican candidate for governor in 1954, losing to Orval Faubus. Remmel received almost 38% of the vote, which was a very good showing for a Republican at the time; the 1952 nominee, Jefferson Speck, had managed only 12.5% against Democrat Francis Cherry, while the 1956 nominee, Roy Mitchell, collected 19.3% against Faubus.\nRemmel ran for mayor of Little Rock again in 1955, losing narrowly to Democrat Woodrow Wilson Mann.\n\n\n== Later activities ==\nAfter his terms as mayor Remmel did not run for elected office again, but he took on volunteer roles with the American Legion and American Red Cross, as well as serving on the Arkansas River Basin Commission and as chairman of the Arkansas Waterways Commission, a state advisory committee intended to promote navigation on Arkansas rivers.\n\n\n== Family ==\nRemmel and his wife Catherine had at least three children, Pratt Remmel Jr., Rebecca Remmel, and Catherine Ellen Remmel Matthews (1941–2020), who became a successful real estate agent and marketing expert and also led the Department of Arkansas Heritage from 1997 to 2002.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Anna Fellowes Vroland born Anna Fellowes White (7 May 1902 – 23 April 1978) was an Australian schoolteacher and human-rights advocate.\n\n\n== Life ==\nVroland was born in Ascot Vale in 1902. Her parents, Jane (born Butler) and John White, arranged for an aunt to teach her and she also attended the Methodist Ladies' College in Kew.\nIn 1947, she married Anton William Rutherford Vroland and in the same year  and 1948 she was arguing in New South Wales newspapers for an improved treatment of the Australian Aboriginal people. She described herself as one of the many people concerned for their well-being and she was keen to note that she had no official position. She argued for a new deal that recognised that they had lost access to their traditional way of life and that they needed sympathy and not punishing jail sentences.\nShe spent time listening and analysing aboriginal songs. As a result, she published a book on the subject titled Their Music Has Roots. Strictly speaking the people she was talking to would have been identified as non-aboriginal as they were of mixed race.\nShe began teaching at various schools and she came to notice when she became the headteacher of Woodstock Girls' School in New South Wales for six months beginning in 1961. Her appointment only lasted that long because of the progressive teaching methods that she introduced. Vroland had experience of experimental methods from a private primary school that she had taught at, in Belgrave in 1928. Woodstock Girls' School did not want these ideas and there was gossip that she was a communist.\nVroland died in Box Hill in 1978.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBiography at ADB",

His family hailed from Crete, a Venetian colony at the time; his knowledge of Greek allowed him to serve as interpreter and envoy to Constantinople during the last years of the Byzantine Empire. After the Fall of Constantinople he rose to the position of secretary of the Duke of Crete, and from 1464 entered service with the Signoria of Venice. He was repeatedly sent as ambassador to the court of the Ottoman Empire and the Mamluk Sultanate, most notably helping conclude the First Ottoman–Venetian War in 1479.\n\n\n== Life ==\nGiovanni Dario was born in 1414 to a Venetian family established in Kastelli Pediadas on Crete; His father, Marco, was a merchant who often travelled abroad, to Venice and Constantinople, often accompanied by his brother, Giovanni, and eventually by his own sons, Giovanni and Zaccaria, and their brother-in-law, Giorgio Pantaleo. By 1450, Giovanni began his career in the Venetian administration as a notary; although noted for his excellent command of both Greek and Latin, he failed to be appointed chancellor of Chania (Canea). Nevertheless, from August of the same year he served as interpreter to Niccolò da Canal during the latter's embassy to the Byzantine imperial court in Constantinople, and then to the Despotate of the Morea. In 1451 he unsuccessfully competed for the post of chancellor in Siteia (Sitia), and then Rethymno (Retimo). \nDario's life during the next years is obscure. A later tradition, which however is not supported by any available evidence, holds that during the Fall of Constantinople he was the unnamed Italian who along with the famous humanist Cyriacus of Ancona is said to have accompanied Sultan Mehmed II, reading to him from the works of ancient historians. This tradition has been disproven, not least since Cyriacus was noted for his anti-Ottoman stance and was likely dead by 1453; but it is likely true that Dario and Cyriacus were acquainted and present together at Constantinople some time before 1453, as Cyriacus is connected with a sketch, drawn by Dario, of the equestrian statue surmounting the Column of Justinian that is now in the University of Budapest library. In 1458 Dario is attested in Crete as chancellor of the island's captain, Angelo Gradenigo, in 1460 as a notary of the great council of Crete, and likely again in 1463–64, when he corresponded with his friend, the scholar Michael Apostolius, who had settled in Crete after the Fall of Constantinople.\n\nFrom 1464 on, Dario resided in Venice, where he could better pursue his ambitions, entering the service of the Signoria of Venice; he even did not take up the position of chancellor of Chania to which he was appointed in 1466, partly due to the plague ravaging Crete at the time. In 1470  he was inscribed among the notaries of the Avogadoria de Comùn, but he also began his diplomatic carrer, being sent as part of an embassy of Triadano Gritti to Milan to mediate in the dispute between the Duke of Milan and the Duke of Modena over possession of Correggio. On his return from Milan, Dario was sent to Constantinople as part of Niccolò Cocco's embassy seeking to conclude a peace in the  ongoing war between Venice and the Ottoman Empire. He resisted returning to Venice until ordered to do so in 1471, was in Crete in early 1472, and back in Venice in August/September. In 1473 Dario was entrusted for the first time with leading an embassy himself, to the Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt, on the occasion of the imprisonment of Venetian merchants and the local Venetian consul at Damascus. The mission was a success, and Dario managed to conclude a treaty of friendship with the Mamluks. \nAs the negotiations for a peace with the Ottomans continued without success, in late 1474 Dario and Gerolamo Zorzi were sent to the Ottoman sultan and brought back terms to Venice. In August 1477, after new incidents with the Mamluks, Dario was sent to Egypt again. Dario's skill was recognized at the time by the Great Council of Venice, and he was recommended to assist the provveditore d'armata Tommaso Malipiero in his negotiations with the Ottomans on his return from Egypt, but Dario did not return to Italy until June 1478. Nevertheless, as Malipiero managed to come to terms with the Ottoman pasha of Rumelia, on 18 November the Venetian Senate granted Dario extensive powers and sent him as ambassador to the Ottoman court, at Constantinople or Adrianople, in order to confirm the agreement. Venice's need to conclude peace was pressing, and this was reflected in Dario's instructions: he was given permission to accede to any demands Mehmed II might make, in exchange for restoring the Republic's access to the Levantine trade. As the historian Maria Francesca Tiepolo remarks, Diedo's choice was not simply due to his skill in Greek and Italian, but also because he was not a patrician; thus the expected onerous peace would not besmirch the honour and reputation of a patrician ambassador. \nAfter long negotiations, on 25 January 1479 Dario concluded a peace treaty with the Ottomans. The terms were heavy, as Venice was forced to cede the fortresses of Scutari and Croia in the Adriatic Sea, the Aegean islands of Lemnos and Euboea, and the Mani Peninsula in southern Greece. In exchange, against an annual payment, the Republic again received the right to trade freely and without taxation in the Ottoman Empire, and maintain a trade colony in Constantinople under its own official (bailo). The Sultan dismissed Dario with many honours, including three gold-cloth kaftans; while according to some accounts, Dario was knighted by the Sultan as well. Dario returned to Venice, accompanied by an Ottoman envoy, Lütfi Bey, on 16 April 1479, to oversee the treaty's ratification.  Dario was likewise entrusted with overseeing the implementation of the treaty, specifically the return of Venetian fortresses and territories captured by the Ottomans during the war, a process which was not completed until 1480, as well as the release of Venetian prisoners; as many of the latter had been sold into slavery, only a few were ever actually returned. For this purpose, in March 1480 Dario was again sent to Constantinople, alongside Niccolò Cocco, the new ambassador to the Sultan. In recompense for his services, the Signoria donated a thousand ducats to the dowry of Dario's natural daughter Maria, and appointed his brother Zaccaria as a scribe in the law court of Giustizia Nova.\nIn December 1480 Dario was in Venice, presenting his report (relazione), but aimed to return to Constantinople to complete the territorial arrangements of the treaty. His arrival was delayed by the anti-Ottoman uprising of Venice's stradioti in Mani under Krokodeilos Kladas and Theodore Bua in January 1481, and his mission was resumed in late April until news arrived of the death of Mehmed in late May. After that, Dario assisted in the deliberations about the brief of the new ambassador, Antonio Vitturi. \n\nDario built a palace, the Palazzo Dario, in Venice. Apart from his natural daughter Maria, who married Vincenzo Barbaro in 1492 or 1493, he did not have legitimate offspring.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nBabinger, Franz (1992) [1978].

        "content": "Palestine–Somalia relations refer to foreign relations between Somalia and Palestine. Somalia was the second country to recognise the Palestinian declaration of independence after Algeria on the same day, 15 November 1988.\n\n\n== History ==\nSomalia under the administration of Siad Barre had close and fraternal relations with the Palestine Liberation Organization and its Chairman Yasser Arafat. Both the PLO and Somalia supported materially and diplomatically the liberation and self-determination movements of Africa and Asia such as ZANU and the African National Congress. This would also cause friction with Israel as Israel would usually support the opposing force, e.g. the Rhodesian & South African apartheid regimes.\nSomalia has opposed the existence and legitimacy of the State of Israel since Somalia's independence in 1960 and has supported the Palestinian cause unabated since. This has led Israel to develop a strategic relationship with Ethiopia (both Imperial and Marxist).\nIn 1977, militants from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine hijacked Lufthansa Flight 181. The Somali Army counter-terrorist forces alongside GSG-9 and SAS conducted Operation Feuerzauber and rescued all 86 hostages.\nSomalia does not maintain an embassy in Palestine and Palestine maintains a non-resident embassy in Djibouti City.\nPalestine also sends development aid to Somalia via the Palestinian International Cooperation Agency (PICA).\n\n\n== See also ==\nForeign relations of the State of Palestine\nForeign relations of Somalia\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Battle of point 5140 was fought on 20 June 1999 and was major military offensive carried out by the Jammu and Kashmir Rifles regiment as a part of the Operation Vijay (Kargil War). The Indian forces under Lt Col. Yogesh Kumar Joshi were able to capture the point.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe task of capturing Point 5140, a strategically important mountain peak in the Dras sector, was assigned to 13 JAK Rif under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Yogesh Kumar Joshi on 17 June 1999. After the capture of Rocky Knob, located at the base of Point 5140 and about 800 metres away, Humps IX and X (part of Hump Complex, consisting of about ten high grounds numbered I to X on the same ridgeline about 500–700 metres north of Point 4590) on 17 June, the battalion's commanding officer, Joshi, fell back to Tololing, and started planning for their next objective — Point 5140. Point 5140, about 1500 metres north of Tololing on the same ridgeline, is at an altitude of 16,962 feet above sea level and overlooks the Tololing nullah. It is the highest point on the Tololing ridgeline and the most formidable feature in the Dras sub-sector.\nOn 18 June, the battalion carried out a detailed reconnaissance of Point 5140 which revealed the enemy had put in place seven sangars on the feature; two on the top, four towards the east and one towards the north. It also revealed the eastern approach to the feature was comparatively easier than that from the front, which had a near vertical climb, dominated by the top, though it was also more heavily defended. It was decided the assaulting troops must capture the Top before dawn, or else the enemy would inflict maximum casualties on them.\nJoshi decided to attack Point 5140 with Bravo Company, under the command of Lieutenant Sanjeev Singh Jamwal, and Delta Company, under the command of Lieutenant Vikram Batra, from two sides; East and South. At the Hump Complex, Sanjeev Jamwal and Vikram received their briefing about the mission from Joshi. During the briefing, Jamwal chose the words \"Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah!\" to be the success signal for his company whilst Vikram chose the words \"Yeh Dil Mange More!\" (This heart wants more! — from a popular advertising slogan of Pepsi) as his success signal for his company. D-Day was set for 19 June, and H-Hour at 20:30.\nUnder the cover of artillery fire, the two assault companies began climbing Point 5140 after midnight on 20 June. The artillery at Hump Complex had already begun its preparatory bombardment of Point 5140. As planned, the artillery guns would stop firing when the troops were 200 metres short of the objective.\nOnce the artillery guns, including the MBRLs and 105 mm guns, had ceased firing, the Pakistani soldiers immediately came out of their bunkers and put down heavy fire with their machine guns on the advancing Indian soldiers. At that moment, both Jamwal and Batra, contacted commanders at the base via radio, asking to continue artillery bombardment of the enemy positions till the companies were 100 metres from their target.\nBy 0315 hours, both B and D Companies had reached the vicinity of Point 5140 despite the treacherous terrain. B company reached the top of the feature first and assaulted from the left flank. By 0330 hours, B company had captured its objective, and at 0335 hours Jamwal radioed his command post, saying the words \"Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah!\"\nBatra decided to approach the hill from the rear, aiming to surprise the enemy, and to cut off their withdrawal route. Batra fired three rockets towards the bunkers on the east side of the feature, before attacking them. He and his men ascended the sheer rock-cliff, but as the group neared the top, the enemy pinned them on the face of the bare cliff with machine gun fire. Batra, along with five of his men, climbed up and after reaching the top, hurled two grenades at the machine gun post. Batra then killed three enemy soldiers single-handedly in close combat. He was seriously injured in the process, but insisted on regrouping his men to continue with the mission. He continued to lead his troops, and then charged at the next enemy position, capturing Point 5140. In all its actions, his company killed at least eight Pakistani intruders and recovered a heavy anti-aircraft machine gun. The remaining enemy soldiers fled.\nAt 0435 hours, Batra radioed his command post, saying the words \"Yeh dil mange more!\". Considerable quantities of arms and ammunition were recovered from the feature. The captured munitions indicated the enemy's strength was about a platoon. Neither B or D companies suffered any casualties in the battle. The capture of Point 5140 set in motion a string of successes, such as the captures of Point 5100, Point 4700, Junction Peak and the Three Pimple Complex.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nAfter the capture of Point 5140, Batra was promoted to the rank of captain. General Ved Prakash Malik, the then Chief of Army Staff, called to congratulate him. All across the nation, his triumph was being played out on television screens.\nOn 26 June, shortly after the capture of Point 5140, 13 JAK Rif was ordered to move from Dras to Ghumri to rest, refit, and regroup. The battalion then moved to Mushkoh Valley on 30 June.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===",

Both facilities have outdoor Olympic size pools which can be used for meets or practices.  \nNationally recognized for his skills and his team's accomplishments, Thornton was a recipient of the American Swimming Coaches Association Award of Excellence from 1988 to 1994.  He was also the recipient of the Pacific Swimming Coach of the Year award from 1994 to 2000.\nOn the international level, Thornton served as head coach for the 1995 U.S. World Championship team.  In high level age group competition, he served as coach for American national and junior national teams in Paris, Japan and Brazil.\n\n\n=== Outstanding swimmers coached ===\nThe most outstanding swimmer to come through his swim program at San Ramon was Matt Biondi, who swam for the club from 1990 to 1992. He was a U.S. Olympic team member in 1984, 1988, and 1992, and captured eight gold, two silver, and one bronze medal.

The club also produced a number of Olympic trail qualifiers and collegiate All Americans.  Attendees at the 2004 Olympic trials included Leah Avilla, who Thornton coached from 1994-2005, John Dorr who Thornton coached from 1994-2002, and Amy Ng who Thornton coached from 1992-2001.\nA surfing enthusiast, Thornton died after collapsing while heading to the water to surf at \"The Hook\", a popular surfing location near Pleasure Point in Santa Cruz, California on January 4, 2024.

        "content": "Luarsab Sharashidze (18 January 1923, Tbilisi, Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic - 7 February 1991, Tbilisi) was a Georgian physician, academic, pathologist, morphologist, and a pioneer of Cytochemistry and Histochemistry in Georgia. He was one of the principal developers and contributor of the Georgian Medical Healthcare system. He was the founder and director of the First Scientific Research and Clinical Centre of Oncology in Georgia. Internationally renowned Georgian academic and diagnostic cancer pathologist. Educator of many generations of Georgian and Soviet medical scientists, author of 10 monographs and 300 scientific works, project leader of 78 Phd and Doctorate theses, Honorary and Meritorious member of Georgian Academy of Sciences (1984). Sharashidze's notable scientific research discoveries in Experimental Oncology were included in the Great Medical Encyclopedia of USSR. He is the one and only Georgian and Soviet scientist who participated in all international symposiums and congresses of Cytochemistry and Histochemistry worldwide.\nLuarsab Sharashidze had 50 years of scientific and teaching experience in pathology, morphology, cyto-histochemistry and oncology.\n\n\n== Childhood and early education ==\n\nLuarsab Sharashidze was born on 18 January 1923 in Tbilisi. His father, Kalistrate Sharashidze was a physician and general practitioner. His mother, Ekaterine Pkhakadze, was a teacher of Russian Language and Literature.\nIn 1930, Sharashidze entered Tbilisi First Secondary School, where he graduated with honors diploma in 1939. From 1939 to 1946 Sharashidze studied medicine and surgery at Tbilisi State Medical Institute and graduated with First Honors degree.\nDuring the 4th year of his medical course, at the age of 20, on the recommendation of head of pathology department Academician V. Zhgenti, Sharashidze was appointed as a senior laboratory assistant at the same departement. It was the first and only precedent in the history of Georgian Medical Institute, when fourth-year medical student taught Pathology to the thirdyear medical students.\nFrom 1946 to 1949 he did his postgraduate course in Pathology and became PhD of medicine.\n\n\n== Scientific research and achievements ==\nFrom 1951 to 1956, Sharashidze was head of the Patho-Morphological department of the Tbilisi Scientific-Research Institute of Tuberculosis. In 1951, Sharashidze introduced the latest methods of neuro-morphological research to the department and In 1952–1953, he proved scientifically that the emergence, localization, course and outcome of tuberculosis depended directly on the condition of the innervation mechanisms. In 1954, he established the possibility of obtaining non-pathogenic strains of the microbe; He successfully Identified these forms of human actinomycosis, leading to the development of the new vaccines of the disease. Sharashidze's discovery was of considerable importance and was included in the Great Medical Encyclopedia of USSR.\nIn 1956, at the age of 33, he introduced novel cytochemical research methods in Georgia: tetrazone reaction (to identify aromatic amino acids), DDD reaction (to identify the thiol group of proteins) and Schiff-iodic acid reaction. In 1957, for the first time in Georgia, he founded the Department of Cyto-histochemistry in the Scientific-Research Institute of Experimental and Clinical Surgery of Georgia, which he led until 1973. During this period, the results of his scientific research work conducted in this department were published in international medical journals and medical manuals, leading to his renown both within and outside the USSR.\nIn 1958, Sharashidze was the first to use absorption microphotometry to determine the amount of nucleic acids and proteins by means of the \"MUF-5\" device. In 1959, he published the first practical manual in cytohistochemistry. In 1960, aged 37, he was the first Georgian scientist to present the results of cytochemical research at the USSR Congress of Pathomorphologists in Kharkiv in 1959 and later on at the First World Congress of Cytohistochemistry in Paris in 1960.\nIn 1960 L. Sharashidze defended his doctoral thesis and in 1963 he was awarded the title of professor in the field of pathology and morphology. In 1960, for the first time in Georgia, he published a monograph on Cytohistochemistry of Cancer.[3] In 1962, he was elected as a member of the Cytology Commission under the Presidium of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR and in 1963 as a member of the national committee in CytoHistochemistry at the Presidium of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union.[4] He was a member of the Council of the Society of Oncologists of the Soviet Union, a member of the Scientific Council of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union in Oncology, a member of the editorial board of the All union journal «Вопросы Онкологии».\nIn 1964, for the first time in Georgia, he organised the 1st Union Symposium on Cytohistochemistry of Cancer. In 1968, he developed a new working scheme of the cell structure, which reveals the unity of all cellular and intracellular membranes and their structural-spatial relationship between the cytoplasm, nucleus and nucleolus. In 1971, he developed a new cytochemical method for DNA detection without thermal hydrolysis.[5] Under his leadership, the first Soviet Union-Poland symposium on the use of cytochemical methods in oncology was held in Georgia In 1972. In 1973, for the first time, he developed the cell differentiation maturation index, which is successfully used in the differential diagnosis of cancer. In 1973, he discovered a double form of RNA in the nucleus of a smooth cell: labile (necessary for reproduction) and stable (necessary for maturation); He also discovered an excess of labile RNA in cancerous cells and by replacing it in tissue cultures, accelerated cell maturation.\nIn 1973–1975, he was appointed as a director of the Scientific Research Institute of Oncology in Tbilisi, Georgia.\nIn 1974, he scientifically substantiated a completely new concept of carcinogenesis and determined that the hyperplastic processes occurring in tissues under the influence of chemical carcinogens are not due to the strengthening of the mitotic activity of cells, but rather to the suppression of the processes of cell reproduction and maturation. His discovery is included in the Great Medical Encyclopedia of Soviet Union.  Founder of First Scientific-Research and Clinical Oncology Centre of Georgia\nIn 1974, he was the first who raised the alarm about the poor medical services in the field of oncology in Georgia. Most of the Georgian oncological patients at the time were seeking medical help outside Georgia, particularly in Moscow and Leningrad. As a Director of Institute of Oncology, in order to help these patients, he decided to reorganise the whole oncological service system in Georgia and raised the importance of the creation of a new Oncological Centre in Georgia by merging the Institute of Radiology, Instiute of Oncology and oncology profile outpatient clinics together. L. Sharashidze's project was successfully was founded and implemented by him in 1975 with the support of E. Shevardnadze, Minister of Health of the Soviet Union, Academician B. Petrovsky and Director of the Moscow Oncology Scientific Centre, Academician N. Blokhin\nLuarsab Sharashidze as a founder, was appointed as a director of this centre. Prof. Sharashidze started reorganisation of Georgian Oncology Services by opening new departments and recruiting the most eminent oncologists around the USSR. The Georgian Oncology Centre became the third leading Oncological institution in the Soviet Union, after the Moscow and St. Peterborough (Leningrad) Oncology Centres. Since 1977, on Prof. Sharashidze's initiative, clinical, theoretical and organizational departments and laboratories of 20 new profiles were formed in the Oncology Centre for the first time: chemical carcinogenesis, functional diagnostics, organizational methodology, scientific informatics and patent science, mammology, abdominal, urology, proctology, thoracic, children's oncology, endoscopy, head and neck, skin, soft tissues and bones, intensive care and resuscitation, cryosurgery, reflex therapy, immunological, bacteriological, hemoblastosis, chemotherapy and radiology.\nIn 1975–1980, under Sharashidze's direct leadership cytological laboratories were established throughout the Republic of Georgia (Kutaisi, Batumi etc.)\nHe was the first in Georgia to carry out the fundamental reorganization and diagnostical/ treatment improverent in the field of Oncology, he established the advance oncology service by creating a network of newly opened oncology profile dispensaries and outpatient clinics in most of the regions of Georgia. With his efforts, a new era of scientific approach to the research, prevention, diagnoses and treatment of oncological patients began in Georgia.\nFrom 1960 to 1988, he was the only Georgian and Soviet scientist who participated and made scientific speeches and presentations in all Union and international world conferences, symposiums and congresses of pathomorphologists, cytohistochemists and oncologists in Russian and English languages (Poland, Russia, Romania, Yugoslavia, France, Germany, Japan, USA, Argentina and others).\nSharashidze was the author of 10 monographs and about 300 scientific works in Georgian, Russian, English and French, and conductor of 58 candidate and 20 doctoral theses. He created a large scientific school of doctors; his disciples successfully led a number of scientific research institutions in medical universities.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nIn his personal life, he wrote poems, painted, was passionate about football and chess. He was married twice; he married Tinatin Vatsadze (1923–2008), a professor and doctor of medical sciences, in 1944. The couple divorced in 1946 after having one child, Giorgi Sharashidze (1945–2015), who also became a professor and doctor of medical sciences. His second marriage was to doctor and professor Rusudan Bulusashvili (1928–2021) in 1954. The couple had two daughters,  Manana Sharashidze (b. 1955) and Maya Sharashidze (1958).\nHe died of a heart attack on 7 February 1991 at the age of 68 at his desk, while working with his microscope. He is buried in Saburtalo Pantheon of Scientists and Public Figures in Tbilisi.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nIn 1992, a memorial board was installed at his house, where he was born, lived and worked until his death, at No. 7 I Nikoladze Lane in Pikris Gora, Tbilisi. That same year, the street on which his home sat was named after him, becoming known as Luarsab Sharashidze street.\nIn 2004, his bust was erected in the courtyard of the Georgian Oncology Scientific Centre.\nIn 2019, his bust was erected at his home on Luarsab Sharashidze Street, in a small square.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nGeorgian Soviet Encyclopedia, Vol. 10, Vol., 1986. — p. 685.\nNewspaper \"Republic of Georgia\" No. 27, 1991.\nMagazine \"Georgian Medical Reporter\" No. 6, 1992.\nNewspaper \"Republic of Georgia\" No. 81, 1993.\nNewspaper \"Republic of Georgia\" No. 269, 2004.\n«Вопросы Онкологии», т.

        "content": "The White Box: A Game Design Toolkit or The White Box Essays is a set of books about tabletop game design by Jeremy Holcomb and Jeff Tidball and published by Atlas Games in 2017.\n\n\n== Development ==\nJeremy Holcomb was professor of game design at the DigiPen Institute of Technology, when he wrote his thoughts and ideas with his years of experience of game design as The White Box Essays. Jeff Tidball was the co-founder of Gameplaywright and chief operating officer for Atlas Games, and he convinced Holcomb to publish his idea through Kickstarter in April 2017. Holcomb and Tidball created The White Box in partnership with Atlas Games and Gameplaywright to make use of their mutual backgrounds in writing and teaching about game design as an affordable cohesive product. Holcomb and Tidball went on the Modifier podcast with Meghan Dornbrock to talk about The White Box.\n\n\n== Contents ==\nThe White Box was intended as a game design workshop to present information and tools to aspiring game designers. It comes as a collection of essays about board game design in a box containing materials such as dice, colored cubes, cardboard chits, and multicolor wooden meeple tokens.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nAnthony J. Bushner in his 2020 PhD thesis about hobbyist board game design wrote that \"One of the most thorough and interesting game design handbooks reviewed for this project was The White Box Essays [...] The 10.5-page chapter on rulebooks comes relatively early in the book and is the only reviewed chapter that speaks to the implicit/explicit rule dichotomy that Salen and Zimmerman cover in detail in Rules of Play as an important part of game manual style. This chapter gives a thorough explanation of each of the crucial sections of a standard rulebook and attends to the order in which those sections should appear to make the rulebook easy to understand for a new reader. Though this chapter does not cover in any significant detail how to conduct usability testing on the manual, this is covered in later chapters.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

Often referred to as Birzhevye Vedomosti's \"Second edition\", it became a daily in 1885. It was edited first by Propper, and later by Vladimir Bondi and Ieronim Yasinsky. A centrist, mildly liberal publication, it lasted until 1917 and was shut down by the city's Bolshevik authorities, answering the allegation of being engaged in \"anti-Soviet propaganda\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Birzhevyie Vedomosti\" digital archives in \"Newspapers on the web and beyond\", the digital resource of the National Library of Russia",

        "content": "Robert Woffinden (27 March 1962 – 30 January 2010) was a motorcycle speedway rider from England.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nWoffinden, born in Scunthorpe, started riding during the second half matches of the Scunthorpe Saints fixtures, at the Quibell Park Stadium as a 16-year old. He began his British leagues career, making an appearance for the Saints during the 1978 National League season season. \nThe following season in 1979 he broke into the team (now called the Stags) more regularly and by the end of the 1981 season had improved his season average to 5.19. In 1982, he started for Scunthorpe before switching to the Middlesbrough Bears. \nThe following season in 1984, he re-joined the Stags and recorded season averages of 7.65 and 7.54 in 1984 and 1985 respectively. He captained the Stags in 1985 but picked up an injury and the team suffered heavy losses. The Stags promoter Tony Nicholls then revealed financial losses and the team were disbanded in May 1985. Woffienden saw out the season with Rye House Rockets.\nWoffinden signed for Boston Barracudas in 1986 but moved on quickly to Birmingham Brummies. Woffinden continued his nomadic trend by riding for Berwick Bandits in 1987 and both Berwick and Edinburgh Monarchs in 1988. \nWoffinden's form had dropped by the time he joined Stoke Potters for the 1989 National League season and after a poor season in 1990, he experienced a low when he was banned for two years by the Speedway Control Board after failing a drug's test.\nHe returned to the sport in 1993, riding for the Sheffield Tigers. He averaged over 5 but suffered a bad crash in July, breaking a wrist and fracturing his pelvis. He retired after one final season with Sheffield in 1994.\nIn 2010, he died after a long illness. Throughout the latter part of his speedway career he had ridden in Australia and set up a home there. The Rob Woffinden Classic is held every year in Australia in his memory.\n\n\n== Family ==\nHis son Tai Woffinden went on to become a three times world champion.\n\n\n== References ==",

Until the village of Perperek it flows in southeastern direction in a wide sparsely forested. Downstream from the village the river takes a large bend to the southwest. Shortly before flowing into the Studen Kladenets Reservoir on the Arda at an altitude of 227 m, the river forms a gorge between the elevations of Kartalkaya (563 m) to the west and Yumrukkaya (587 m) to the east, which is now almost flooded by the reservoir. It drains the ridges of Chukata and Kayadzhik.\nIts drainage basin covers a territory of 220 km2, or 3.8% of the Arda's total. The river has predominantly rain feed. The average annual flow at the village of Chiflik is 2.2 m3/s.\n\n\n== Settlements and economy ==\n\nThe Perperek flows entirely in Kardzhali Province. There are 14 villages along its course — Daskalovo, Yabalcheni, Chernoochene and Barza Reka in Chernoochene Municipality, and Tri Mogili, Stremovo, Lyulyakovo, Gorna krepost, Dolna krepost, Murgovo, Chiflik, Madrets, Perperek and Svatbare in Kardzhali Municipality. Its waters are utilized for irrigation.\nA 3 km stretch of the third class III-507 road Haskovo–Most–Kardzhali follows its valley between Perperek and Madrets. Along the gorge in its lower course runs a section of railway line No. 4 Ruse–Stara Zagora–Podkova served by the Bulgarian State Railways.\nBetween the villages of Gorna Krepost and Dolna Krepost are located the ruins of the ancient Thracian city and later medieval fortress of Perperikon.\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== References ==\nМичев (Michev), Николай (Nikolay); Михайлов (Mihaylov), Цветко (Tsvetko); Вапцаров (Vaptsarov), Иван (Ivan); Кираджиев (Kiradzhiev), Светлин (Svetlin) (1980).

        "content": "Rural notables, as individuals, or the rural notability as a collective, was a social class of local notables (known in Arabic as a'yan-, wujaha'-, zu'ama- rifiyya, qarawiyya, mahaliyya) in late Ottoman and British Mandate Palestine, with equivalent groups developing throughout the Levant. Most rural notables originated in, and belonged to, the fellahin/peasantry class, forming a lower-echelon land-owning gentry in Palestine's post-Tanzimat countryside and emergent towns. Numerically, rural notables form the majority of Palestinian elites, although certainly not the richest.\nIn contrast to urban elites traditionally made of city-dwelling merchants (tujjar), clerics ('ulema), ashraf, military officers, and governmental functionaries, the rural notability was composed of rural sheikhs, village or clan mukhtars. Rural notables took advantage of changing legal, administrative and political conditions, and global economic realities, to achieve socio-economic and political ascendancy using households, marriage alliances and networks of patronage. Over all, they played a leading role in the development of modern Palestine into the late 20th century.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Tofik Haroyan (Russian: Тофик Ароян; born 1970), known as the Krasnodar Chikatilo (Russian: краснодарский Чикатило), is a Russian serial killer who was convicted of six murders committed between 2000 and 2002. He confessed to 17 murders and was suspected to have committed upwards of 20. His victims were female hitchhikers, whom he robbed, sexually assaulted, and strangled in and around Krasnodar.\n\n\n== Background ==\nHaroyan was 32 years old at the time of his arrest. He was 2 meters (6'5\") tall, unmarried, and had worked as a driver for his entrepreneur father. He was deeply bothered by what he described as the \"immoral behavior\" of women and had been previously forced to undergo treatment at the Serbsky Center in Moscow for schizophrenia.\n\n\n== Murders and imprisonment ==\nHaroyan committed his first murders in early 2000, when the bodies of strangled women began to appear around Krasnodar. His first two victims were students of the Kuban State Agrarian University. After offering his victims a ride home from work or university, he would give them an ultimatum: 100 to 200 rubles for sex, or he would murder them. Regardless of their choice, he would strangle them after sex and dump their bodies in bushes along the roadside, and in one instance, he lit the victim's remains on fire.\nOn 4 December 2001, law enforcement organized a team to investigate the murders. Haroyan was detained at one point but was released due to insufficient evidence.\nHis final victim was a 28-year-old lawyer. She was discovered asphyxiated on 2 March 2002, in a forest belt in the village of Znamensky. Four days later, Haroyan was apprehended due to a tip from someone who had witnessed the woman entering his white Volga. Haroyan told investigators that the woman was a friend of his father, whom he offered to give a ride home, and after an argument, had strangled her.\nDuring interrogation, Haroyan freely confessed to his crimes, describing them as a \"fight against the immoral behavior of females.\" Due to his mental instability, he was declared insane and sentenced to compulsory treatment at a psychiatric hospital, where he remained as of 2012.\n\n\n== See also ==\nYuri Sparikhin\nList of Russian serial killers\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

Because the team did not have access to Pratt Field, which they had used prior to the war, the team was relegated to playing all of its games on the road. However, the team persevered and used whatever ice surfaces they could find to train and get themselves into working order. Amherst decided against adopting the new style of play and kept the rover position for the first game. However, because the second match was held on a much smaller rink, the team was forced to play 6-on-6 hockey for the duration.\nAmherst managed to schedule and play two games in 1920, both in late-January. The first came at YMCA College and the team got off to a fast start. Allen Davidson got the team an early lead and allowed Sisson and the defense to carry them the rest of the way. Plumer was particuularly effective in breaking up several rushes into the Amherst end and the purple were able to shutout Springfield. The second and final game of the year was with cross-town rival Massachusetts Agricultural with good goaltending a feature of the game. Sisson continued his inspired play in the second half and, although he allowed a goal to MAC, the purple were able to ring up three scores on the night and finish with an undefeated record. The following week, Amherst was off to play \nBradford L. Church served as team manager.\nNote: Amherst teams did not have any nickname prior to 1921.\n\n\n== Roster ==\n\n\n== Standings ==\n\n\n== Schedule and results ==\n\n\n== References ==",

This will mark the sixth regular-season event of the tournament and included fights in the Featherweight and Welterweight divisions.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThis event will mark the organization's debut in Sioux Falls and South Dakota state.\nThe event is expected to be headline by a featherweight bout between 2022 PFL featherweight winner Brendan Loughnane and former LFA Featherweight Champion Justin Gonzales.\n\n\n== Fight card ==\n\n\n== Standings after event ==\nThe PFL points system is based on results of the match.  The winner of a fight receives 3 points.  If the fight ends in a draw, both fighters will receive 1 point. The bonus for winning a fight in the first, second, or third round is 3 points, 2 points, and 1 point respectively. The bonus for winning in the third round requires a fight be stopped before 4:59 of the third round.  No bonus point will be awarded if a fighter wins via decision.  For example, if a fighter wins a fight in the first round, then the fighter will receive 6 total points. A decision win will result in three total points.  If a fighter misses weight, the opponent (should they comply with weight limits) will receive 3 points due to a walkover victory, regardless of winning or losing the bout;  if the non-offending fighter subsequently wins with a stoppage, all bonus points will be awarded.\n\n\n=== Welterweight ===\n\n\n=== Featherweight ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of PFL events\nList of current PFL fighters\n\n\n== References ==",

He represents the electoral district of Milton as a member of the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOriginally from Karachi, Pakistan, Hamid immigrated to Canada as a teenager and has a bachelor of mathematics and computer science degree from the University of Waterloo. He was a tech industry professional prior to entering politics and has worked at Microsoft, Amazon and DoorDash. He has at least two patents under his name.\n\nHamid and his wife have a blended family of six children.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nHamid was first elected as a Milton town councillor in 2010 and then re-elected in 2014. In 2018, he successfully ran for the Halton Regional Council, beating a former regional councillor and a sitting town councillor. Hamid ran unsuccessfully for mayor of Milton in the 2022 municipal election, losing by fewer than 1,000 votes to long-time incumbent Gordon Krantz. \nOn May 2, 2024, Hamid won 47 per cent of the vote to 38.3 per cent for Ontario Liberal's Naidoo Harris despite polls showing a neck to neck race. \nBefore running as a PC candidate, Hamid had donated $3,508 to the Ontario Liberal Party since 2014, including to former Liberal leader Steven Del Duca's 2020 leadership campaign. He had also run unsuccessfully for the federal Liberal nomination in his riding for the 2015 Canadian federal election.\n\n\n== Electoral record ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Parador de Oropesa, also known as Virrey de Toledo, is a four-star Parador hotel located in the town of Oropesa, in the province of Toledo, in the autonomous community of Castile-La Mancha, Spain. It was converted over a number of years from two of the buildings forming the compound of the Castillo de Oropesa (Oropesa Castle). The Parador is located both in the Palacio Viejo (Old Palace), also known as the Palacio Doña Elvira, which dates from the end of the 14th century, and in the Palacio Nuevo (Oropesa) (New Palace), also known as the Palacio de los Álvarez de Toledo, which was built in the 16th century.\nThe two palaces were the residence of the Condado de Oropesa (Counts of Oropesa), part of the noble family of the Casa de Toledo (House of Toledo). The family died out in the early 19th century and the castle and palaces were inherited by the Duque de Frías (Dukes of Frías). In the early 20th century the buildings passed into public ownership, serving as a school, housing for the Guardia Civil (Civil Guard), a theatre, the municipal slaughterhouse, and storage for grain, while the central courtyard served as a bullring and as a location for local entertainment and festivities.\nIn 1929 part of the New Palace was converted into one of the earliest Paradores, the first to be constructed within a pre-existing historical building, with nine bedrooms and space for 19 guests. Much expanded since, into both the New and Old Palaces, it is now one of most popular venues in the Parador chain.\n\n\n== The original buildings and their early history ==\nThe Parador de Oropesa is within the complex of the castle of Oropesa which consists of four attached major buildings: two castles and two palaces, together known as the Palacio Condal (Comital Palace). The Castillo Viejo (Old Castle) or Patio Musulmán (Muslim Courtyard) dates from the 12th and 13th centuries and the Castillo Nuevo (New Castle) from the 14th and 15th centuries. The Parador is situated in the two palaces, the Palacio Viejo (Old Palace) of the 15th century, and the Palacio Nuevo (New Palace) built in the 16th century.\n\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nThe Oropesa castle began as a watchtower on a hilltop to control the transit of livestock. It was built by the Vettones, an Iron Age pre-Roman people of the Iberian Peninsula. Later the Romans built another tower there to control the road they had built between the cities of Toledo and Mérida. They also built an inn to serve travellers, provide horse supplies and house military detachments. The Muslim occupation of Iberia, begun in the year 711, saw the building of the original much larger fortress on the remains of the ancient Roman castellum. Two circular towers of Arab origin remain as part of the later fortifications.\n\n\n=== Crown ownership ===\n\nKing Alfonso VI de León y Castilla captured Toledo in 1085 and Oropesa and the Muslim-built castle came under his control. His descendant Alfonso X de Castilla gifted the town to its citizens, and his son, Juan de Castilla rewarded the Oropesa nobles for their loyalty with further fortifications and the building of a town wall in 1321. In 1366 Enrique II de Castilla granted the lordship of Oropesa to García Álvarez de Toledo as a reward for supporting him in the war against Pedro el Cruel.\n\n\n=== Aristocratic ownership and the first palace ===\nGarcía Álvarez de Toledo's son, Fernán Álvarez de Toledo y Zúñiga, the second lord of Oropesa, with his wife Elvira de Ayala, lady of Cebolla,  built the first palace and enlarged the castle at the end of the 14th century. This palace, on the north side of the castle complex and abutting the castle, is a Mudéjar-Gothic building with a long hall room on the upper floor approached from the courtyard by a wide stone interior staircase. The hall was embellished by a polychrome wooden coffered ceiling decorated with the coat of arms of the Álvarez de Toledo family and those of other families connected by marriage. A mirador (lookout point) was built onto the hall, as an internal balcony or loggia open to the air with four foliated Gothic arches. The exterior arch spandrels displayed three coats of arms, one being of the Álvarez family and the other two of the Zúñiga family. Plateresque details were added to the first palace in the 16th century.  The building came to be known as the Palacio Doña Elvira and the viewpoint as the Mirador de Doña Elvira. The front of the building, and the viewpoint, faces the northwest and looks over the extensive flat valley of the Rio Tiétar, which flows through the Campo Arañuelo, and beyond that the fertile foothills of La Vera and the Sierra de Gredos.\nIn 1477 the Álvarez de Toledo male line was elevated from lords to counts by Isabel la Católica as thanks for Álvarez support in the War of the Castilian Succession against Afonso V of Portugal. They became the Condado de Oropesa (Counts of Oropesa).\n\n\n=== The New Palace ===\nIn the 16th century, the Counts of Oropesa built the New Palace. There is a difference of opinion as to whether the architect was Juan de Herrera (1530-1597) or his closest disciple Francisco de Mora (1552-1610). They are known to have worked together on a number of prominent Spanish buildings, including the Alcázar of Segovia and El Escorial, so it is possible they collaborated in the design of the New Palace.\nGrander than the Old Palace, this building was designed in the style of the Renacimiento Español (Spanish Renaissance). Situated roughly at right-angles to the Old Palace it faced west-southwest. The main façade was elongated, symmetrical, predominantly flat and unusually high. Built of stone with occasional red brick infill, two full length stone belt courses divided the façade horizontally into three sections. Internally there were three floors with mezzanines, producing some peculiarities in the fenestration pattern. Most prominently, there were seven wrought-iron balconies, served by full-height glazed doors, in a row above the first of the stone string courses. The balconies retain their original metalwork.\nAll the windows were framed with plain, monumental dressed stone and capped by red brick arches.\n\nAt roof level six large rectilinear chimneys were visually situated above and between the seven vertical window alignments. To the right of the façade was an octagonal ground-based structure of two double-height storeys to the height of the second belt course. It was built of padded ashlar stone and the second storey featured large windows crowned by triangular pediments on each of the seven faces. The eighth face connected with the southern corner of the main building. The upper storey was known as El Peinador de la Duquesa (the Duchess's dressing room). Unfinished stonework on the northern corner of the palace shows that a similar matching structure was to have been built there. The main entrance of the New Palace was centred in the building. Wide enough for a carriage, it led straight through the ground floor of the palace into the courtyard in front of the castle.\nThe rear of the New Palace, facing the castle, had none of the symmetry or style of the frontal façade. It was more complex in presentation, with a number of blocks of differing dimensions projecting eastwards, and northwards to connect with the western end of the Old Palace. Some of the windows on the rear side are framed with red brick, with brick fans forming the lintel. Others are surrounded with plain dressed stone in a similar way to  the windows on the façade.\nTo the south of the New Palace a further wing projected eastward, reached by a corridor extended from the gallery behind the New Palace. It housed a church where the counts and their families worshipped from a private gallery. This wing also contained service areas including kitchens, staff bedrooms, haylofts and stables. It has since been demolished.\n\nThe rear of the New and Old Palaces had an L-shaped double-height open gallery, supported by 32 Ionic stone columns, facing onto the courtyard. At the central corner of the gallery the Old Palace's semi-exterior staircase emerged at the upper level, having risen from the ground floor at the rear of the New Palace. The gallery gave its name to the central courtyard which became known as el patio de las galerías.\nInternally, the New Palace was laid out in a similar way to most aristocratic houses of the time, with interconnecting rooms in a corridor formation, allowing visual communication from one end of the building to the other, both on the floor housing the reception and ceremonial rooms, and on the floors above housing the bedrooms. On the first floor above the ground floor a large room, built as an apothecary, was the transitional space between the Old and New Palaces. Just off it was a medieval tower dating from the Arab period which became part of the palatial complex when the two palaces were conjoined.\nSome unfinished external construction areas show the New Palace remained incomplete, though occasional building improvements and changes were carried out over subsequent years. The 5th Count of Oropesa, some time after 1619, began an elevated walkway into the town from the New Palace. A series of brick arches was built, leading to the parish Church of Our Lady of the Assumption, so the countess and her suite could leave the palace and attend mass without having to mix with townspeople. On the count's death in 1621 the project was unfinished and remained that way as the widowed countess abandoned Oropesa for the court in Madrid.\nFor nearly another 200 years the castle and palaces remained in the hands of the Álvarez family. Over four centuries the family had hosted celebrated figures at the palace, including Carlos I of Spain, later Holy Roman Emperor, and San Pedro de Alcántara, whose cell has been preserved by the Parador. The involvement of the Counts of Oropesa in political and military activities established the castle as an important centre of support and at other times of resistance. In 1808 the castle and palaces were sacked by French troops during the Peninsular War.\nAt the beginning of the 19th century the lineage of Álvarez de Toledo died out and the lordship passed to the citizens of Oropesa. Soon after, the Duques de Frías, who claimed descent from the Counts of Oropesa, succeeded in taking over the castle. The new nobles found the palace to be in a very dilapidated condition. The last aristocratic owner of the complex was José Bernardino Fernández de Velasco, the fifteenth Duque de Frías. On the duke's death in 1888 the castle and palaces, still in poor condition, were sold to Enrique Gutiérrez de Salamanca and Ruffo de Gambert, who raised mortgages on the two palaces in order to buy them.\n\n\n== Castle and palaces under the ownership of Oropesa ==\nAt the beginning of the 20th century the owners of the castle and palaces at Oropesa, Enrique Gutiérrez de Salamanca and Ruffo de Gambert, had defaulted on their mortgages and the properties were acquired by the Oropesa ayuntiamento (town council).\n\nUnder the town's control the castle and palaces became the community centre. Rooms in the Old Palace were converted into offices. The local Guardia Civil (Civil Guard) station was located in the main hall of the Old Palace, the loggia viewpoint being bricked in and given some small windows. Below the Guardia Civil, on the ground floor of the Old Palace, was the municipal theatre. The New Palace housed the Oropesa escuela de primer grado (primary school) and homes for the teachers. The town council secretary and the building superintendent also lived in the New Palace. Some of the lower rooms were used as the municipal slaughterhouse and as food stores.  In 1928 a bullring was installed in the courtyard with permanent concrete bleachers for the spectators built on the southern and eastern sides. The gallery on the northern and western sides, with the temporary addition of bleachers beneath when a fight was planned, completed the ring. The bullfighters, who came mostly from local villages, were usually second-rate.\nThe castle was declared a Monumento-Artistico (Artistic Monument) on 8 February 1923, and a Monumento Nacional (National Monument) in 1926.\n\n\n== Conversion to a Parador ==\nThe Parador de Oropesa was the first of the then fledgling Parador chain to be converted from a historic building, being inaugurated in February 1930. Many more Parador adaptations of ancient structures were to follow. The initiative for its conversion came from Platón Páramo Sánchez-Junquera (1857–1929), a local apothecary, collector and antique dealer, who as well as holding other political positions was a member of the Provincial Board of Tourism.\n\nIn November 1928, the new Junta de Paradores y Hosterías del Reino requested the help of the Oropesa town council, who owned the Palace, in the conversion and inauguration of the Parador, in particular in the task of ceding to the Junta de Paradores (rent free and for 20 years) all the rooms on the first floor of the New Palace required for the conversion. The council was to continue its housing of teachers, the school, the Civil Guard and other municipal offices in other parts of the property for over three decades until the expansion of the Parador in the 1960s.\nThe architect instructed to take on the conversion project was Madrid-born Luis Martinez Feduchi Ruíz (1901–1975), who was then in his late twenties, having graduated from the Escuela Técnica Superior de Arquitectura de Madrid (Higher Technical School of Architecture of Madrid) in 1927. The Parador de Oropesa was one of his first works, carried out at speed, and with building restoration and the determination to create a hotel taking precedent over any necessity for the conservation of heritage. He not only designed the building conversion but also took charge of the interior decorating, designing much of the furniture and fittings himself. A few of these remain in the Parador. The adaptation was completed in November 1929. On 7 February 1930 the Parador de Turismo de Oropesa entered into service, with its official inauguration taking place on 11 March 1930.\n\n\n== The Parador in operation before the Spanish Civil War ==\nWhen the Parador de Oropesa opened it was seen as a revolution in terms of tourism, but also it created a new type of employment in an area which was mostly dependent on agricultural work.\n\nThe Oropesa Parador's administrator was Adela Páramo Cuartero, the daughter of the main instigator of the project. She had brought in a number of her own antique furniture pieces to help decorate the interior. She retained her ownership of these pieces, however, and when she retired in 1965 she took much of the furniture away with her. Under her command in 1930 were a cook, two waitresses, three cleaners and a guard. The majority of the staff were people from the town, but they usually spent the night in the staff dormitories. The hours were long: often from eight o'clock in the morning to midnight. The Parador had a vegetable garden to serve the restaurant along with yards for keeping smaller animals for the same purpose. On the occasions when the well dried up water had to be trucked in. The guard shouldered these responsibilities as well as carrying the coal for fires for heating and for the ovens.\nAccess to the Parador was through the archway from the street to the inner courtyard and then by a semi-exterior staircase to the gallery of the main floor where there was access to the lobby. The gallery shared access to the barracks of the Civil Guard, who occupied the first floor of the Old Palace. The Parador also shared its location with the school and accommodation for teachers.\nThe interior of the Parador combined comfort with an aristocratic ambience typical of the region. There were five double guest rooms, three of them with a bathroom en suite, another bathroom for use by guests without en suite facilities, a bedroom for drivers, a room for the manager, another for the workers, an office, a service room and a dining room able to seat 30 guests. The old municipal theatre on the ground floor was converted into garages for cars.\n\nFull board at the Parador was 20 to 25 pesetas and a few pesetas extra for room with a bathroom. Breakfast was 2 pesetas, lunch 8 and dinner 10.  A cup of coffee was 75 centimos. Business at the Parador was slow at first; four days might pass without the arrival of a guest. In 1931 there were 20 overnight stays and 45 meals were served.\nKing Alfonso XIII visited the Parador de Oropesa on 18 November 1930 and addressed the residents of the town from the central first floor balcony of the New Palace, over the entrance archway. Journalists reported that he was \"applauded enthusiastically\".\nOther visitors to the Parador de Oropesa in the 1930s included a number of British authors, such as Gerald Brenan, Graham Greene and W Somerset Maugham.\nThe Parador continued in operation until the early months of the Spanish Civil War.\n\n\n== The Spanish Civil War, 1936-1939 ==\nOn the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War fought between the Republicans and the Nationalists in July 1936 the working of the Parador continued briefly until the government (Republican) military command of the Extremadura army (First Organic Division) with troops from Madrid and led by General José Riquelme y López Bago. took over the castle and the Parador as a base for their local operations.\nWithin the town and the surrounding countryside there was considerable support for the Republic amongst working people while more prosperous members of the community, landowners, and priests supported the rebel Nacionales. There was much hatred between the Republicans and Nationalists in Oropesa which resulted in \"horrific cruelties\" in the town and elsewhere.\nBy the end of August 1936 Oropesa castle was threatened by Nationalist forces, composed of members of the Ejérciot de África (Army of Africa) led by Lieutenant Colonel Juan Yagüe. These militia, mostly members of the Spanish Legion and Moroccan Regulares (Regulars), backed by Andalusian Requeté (paramilitaries), were commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Heli Rolando de Tella y Cantos and had made a remarkably rapid advance north through Extremadura before turning north-eastwards towards Toledo and Madrid. Oropesa Castle, in the hands of Republicans, lay in the line of their advance.\nIn the small hours of 30 August 1936 the castle and Parador were taken over in a surprise attack by the Tenth Rifle Company of the Nationalist forces led by Lieutenant Alfonso Mora Requejo under Colonel Carlos Asensio Cabanillas. More than 200 government troops were killed in the taking of Oropesa, including young members of the Juventudes Socialistas Unificadas (Unified Socialist Youth) battalions who had been brought in to help defend the town, while one battalion and one company were taken prisoner. Many captured commanders were shot immediately. Extensive war materials were captured.\nOn taking the castle, the Nationalist Legionaries discovered that the Republicans, aided by their civilian supporters in Oropesa, had rounded up and assembled the opposing bourgeoisie of the town in the main courtyard with the intention of setting fighting bulls loose amongst them. Eyewitness reports also suggested that several of the town's priests had been seized, tortured and beaten in the castle's courtyard before one was murdered with Bullfighters' banderillas. The Nationalists quickly overwhelmed the castle's defenders, who put up little resistance, and the forcibly assembled townspeople were released.\nHours after its fall to the Nationalists the US journalist Hubert Renfro Knickerbocker entered the castle:\n\n\"Two banderas of the Legion were quartered here now. ... They had marched and fought all night long and now they ... slept in heaps .. in every corner of shade the castle court afforded ... In the middle of the courtyard under the blazing sun a very old crone dug around in a vast heap of wreckage ... I went on upstairs, leaping across machine guns, threading my way between stacked rifles, to the quarters of Lieutenant-Colonel Laureado Don Heli R. de Tella, chief of the column advancing on Madrid ... He stood at the window of his quarters on the second floor of the castle where the hotel part used to be and showed me how he took the town just a few hours before. 'We only lost one dead and eight wounded; the Reds lost I don't know how many.'\"\nShortly after Knickerbocker's interview with de Tella in the Parador machine guns were heard firing from the castle's towers. A Republican armoured train which had appeared on the railway just below was shelling and machine-gunning the castle and Parador. The Nationalist Legionaries were responding. \"I ran across the parapet, reached the stairway to the topmost tower and came out near a heavy 50-caliber machine-gun firing so fast men stood pouring buckets of water on the barrel,\" reported Knickerbocker for the International News Service. \"Amazing rage struck the Legionaries as bullets from the armored train hit the parapet ... For an hour the mutual killing went on.\"\nAt much the same time in the air above the Parador on 31 August, two Nationalist Fiat CR.32 aircraft (flown by Italian Aviazione Legionaria pilots) were shot down in a dogfight with Hispano-Nieuport Nid52, Dewoitine D.372 and Hawker Fury aircraft flown by the Republic.\nThe fighting moved on and the Nationalists remained in control of the castle at Oropesa for the remainder of the war. Lieutenant Colonel Maximino Bartomeu took up residence in the Parador while the hotel areas of the Palace and other parts of the establishment were converted into a military barracks. Some of the Parador workers suffered reprisals for having previously provided hospitality to the Republican militia.\n\n\n== Post-war reconstruction ==\n\nWhen the Civil War ended in April 1939 with Francisco Franco established as dictator of Spain, the original Parador establishment within the New Palace was found to have been so comprehensively damaged by shelling and machine-gunning and by over two-and-a-half years of occupation as barracks that it had to be repaired and remodelled. The architect appointed to carry out this task was Luis Martínez Feduchi Ruiz, who had carried out the original conversion. He took the opportunity to expand the Parador into adjoining areas of the buildings, including former teachers' homes on the main floor and some of the ground floor premises. The general facilities were improved and there were now eight double rooms and one single, six of them en suite, and shared bathroom facilities for those rooms which lacked them. The public rooms comprised a dining room and two lounges with grand fireplaces. The Parador de Oropesa reopened to the public on 12 December 1942.  Prices had risen from before the hostilities. Bed and breakfast in a room with ensuite facilities now cost 64 pesetas. The dinner set menu was 30 pesetas.\nIn the 1940s the Parador de Oropesa became established as an important location for meetings between the intelligence services of Spain and Portugal (both countries then controlled by dictators) with leading officials organising their bilateral activities and endeavouring to control smuggling along the Spanish-Portuguese border, 140 kilometres to the west. Local civil governors also met at the Parador to organise the pursuit of the guerrilleros antfranquistas (anti-Francisco Franco guerrilla forces) still hiding in the mountain ranges of the region.\n\n\n== The Parador de Oropesa into the modern age ==\n\nBy 1947 a rationalisation of the use of the castle and palaces at Oropesa was required due to the number of other organisations using them and coexisting in the space. So began a long series of occasional closures and reworking over the next 45 years together with the departure of organisations unconnected with the Parador operation. Two architects were involved consecutively: the first was Julián Luís Manzano Monís (1919–2012) and the second Carlos Fernández-Cuenca Gómez. Under their supervision the Parador had expanded by June 1992 with the capacity for 96 guests in 44 double rooms and 4 suites, with an outdoor swimming pool and a convention centre. The audience bleachers on two sides of the courtyard, built for its occasional use as a bullring, had been demolished. The dining room had been moved to the first floor of the Old Palace into the area previously used by the Civil Guard, its polychrome coffered ceiling dating from the 15th century having been restored. The bricking up of the loggia viewpoint had been removed and replaced by full-height glazing. An extension had been built on the existing terrace in the southwest rear part of the New Palace, providing another three bedrooms on each floor. The Old and New Palaces had been properly connected internally.\n\nFurther restoration work was carried out in several phases between 2001 and 2016 by local architect Mauro Cano. The commission was to bring the Parador up to date in terms of its uses and to the regulations regarding accessibility, safety and hygiene. Large banqueting rooms were built on the ground floor that are capable of subdivision when required. The dining room was opened to the outside through the glazed gallery to the north and onto the galleried terraces looking to the south. In the courtyard next to the castle wall a wooden cage was constructed to hide the Parador's external machinery and fans. In the course of the work an old cistern was discovered and brought back to its original function of supplying water.\nOn 2 March 1993 the Palacio Nuevo was declared a Monumento Nacional (National Monument).\nIn 1966 the Parador was given the name Virrey de Toledo in honour of Francisco Álvarez de Toledo (1512–1582), a brother of the third count of Oropesa, who was the fifth Viceroy of Peru in 1568, holding office for 12 years.\n\nIn July 2010, celebrating the 80th anniversary of its inauguration, the Oropesa Parador became what the Paradores organisation call a \"parador-museo\". 31 information points were placed around the building, with explanatory texts in Spanish and English explaining the history of the building with old photographs, plans and further illustrations of the past of the palace, including its origins, the architectural character of the different spaces and the uses they had in the past, the people linked to the building, and the history of Oropesa.\nThe Parador de Oropesa is now one of the most important historic buildings managed by the Parador chain and is one of the most popular, with 20,000 guests staying each year and 40,000 meals a year being served by the restaurant.\n\n\n== Parador de Oropesa in film ==\nThe Parador de Oropesa makes an appearance in the 1957 film The Pride and the Passion, directed by Stanley Kramer in which the American singer and actor Frank Sinatra, playing an anti-Napoleon guerrilla fighter, appeals to spectators in the courtyard, temporarily converted back into its bullring setting, for help in pulling a giant cannon from a river. Scenes from other films have been shot at the Parador de Oropesa, including the Spanish language movies La Malquerida in 1940 (soon after the Civil War) which included a bullfighting scene set in the courtyard, and in 1954 El Tren Expreso featuring a Spanish star of the 1950s, Jorge Mistral.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Thomas Henry Robinson Jr. v. United States, 324 U.S. 282 (1945), was a Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled that under the Federal Kidnapping Act which states, \"the sentence of death shall not be imposed by the court if, prior to its imposition, the kidnapped person has been liberated unharmed\", a defendant may receive the death sentence if their victim suffered from non-permanent injuries. Although the court ruled in this way, it did so mainly on the premise it did not feel it had sufficient reason to \"nullify the clearly expressed purpose of Congress\" in this case.\n\n\n== Historical context ==\nThis case begins with Thomas H. Robinson Jr, who, on October 10, 1934, kidnapped Alice Stoll in Louisville, Kentucky. In the commission of this kidnapping it was also alleged Robinson's father and wife were involved, however they were acquitted on all charges. Only 10 days later on October 20, a federal grand jury indicted Robinson with violating 18 U.S. Code § 408a and 18 U.S. Code § 408a (both statutes have been moved since). \nRobinson was then apprehended on May 11, 1936, in Glendale, California by the FBI and transported back to Kentucky to stand trial. On May 13, 1936, Robinson was arraigned, for § 408a only, and pled guilty to the singular count. Shackelford Miller Jr., a U.S District Judge for the Western District of Kentucky, sentenced Robinson to life imprisonment, and eventually was set to be served at the infamous Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary. \n\n\n=== Pre-retrial proceedings ===\nRobinson then, filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus with the U.S. District Court for Northern California, which was denied. The stated reason for the writ because apparently wanted to bring to the Courts' attention the fact he was legally insane, and received ineffective assistance of counsel in his original trial. He appealed the decision the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which released it's opinion on April 8, 1941. In its opinion, written by Circuit Judge Curtis D. Wilbur, joined by Circuit Judge Francis A. Garrecht, the court affirmed the lower Court and denied Robinson's petition. It stated they did not believe Robinson's petition or motion had \"facts sufficient to entitle the petitioner to a writ\". Circuit Judge William Healy filed a dissenting opinion.\nRobinson then appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which granted certiorari and eventually vacated the judgement of the Circuit Court, and remanded the case to order a new trial. In the Circuit Court's opinion on the matter, this time written by Judge Healy, Judge Wilbur dissented, pointing to his prior opinion on the matter as his reasoning. The case was remanded back to the California court on August 10, 1942, where, after a hearing, Judge Michael J. Roche determined that Robinson indeed had not \"intelligently waived\" his right to effective counsel, and thus ordered a retrial back in the Kentucky court.\n\n\n=== Retrial and appeal ===\nThe retrial of Robinson concluded in 1943, where he was ultimately convicted of kidnapping and ,upon recommendation from the jury, sentenced to death by Judge Miller. Robinson once again appealed, this time to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, this time finally on the matter of whether the death sentence was legal. Robinson argued that the kidnapping statute in question, specifically the provision on the death sentence, was a violation of the Fifth Amendment and Sixth Amendment rights. The section in question reads as follows:\n\"Whoever shall knowingly transport or cause to be transported, or aid or abet in transporting, in interstate or foreign commerce, any person who shall have been unlawfully seized, confined, inveigled, decoyed, kidnaped, abducted, or carried away by any means whatsoever and held for ransom or reward or otherwise, except, in the case of a minor, by a parent thereof, shall, upon conviction, be punished (1) by death if the verdict of the jury shall so recommend, provided that the sentence of death shall not be imposed by the court if, prior to its imposition, the kidnaped person has been liberated unharmed\" (emphasis as in original)\nRobinson argued that the italicized provision is too \"too vague, uncertain and indefinite to form the basis of a valid indictment\". He argued that, \"the phrase \"and did not liberate her unharmed\" [referenced in the indictment] was too indefinite as a basis for the indictment; that the word \"harmed\" admits of varying degrees of  meaning from slight to grave\". He further argued that he had a right to know \"as to what particular injuries the Government would insist had been inflicted\". There were also raised concerns in regards to the jury, although this specific argument was denied by the Court. The Court further reviewed Robinson's claim that he was criminally insane, although that also was thrown out. Ultimately the court ruled against Robinson on July 31, 1944. Robinson subsequently appealed to the United States Supreme Court once more.\n\n\n== Supreme Court ==\nThe Supreme Court agreed to hear his case, and held oral arguments on February 8, 1945, and released its opinion written by Justice Hugo Black on March 5, 1945. In a 7–2 decision, the Court ruled in favor of the United States, with the dissent being written by Justice Wiley Rutledge and joined by Justice Frank Murphy. The majority opinion started off by strictly establishing the purpose of granting certiorari, stating it to be to answer \"the sole question of the court's statutory authority to impose the death sentence.\" The court notes the ambiguity in this case, saying that the law's \"legislative history...is of little assistance to us in interpreting this proviso\". So instead of attempting to interpret Congress' intention of the law, it relied on the language of it. Ultimately, the court interpreted the language as follows,\"We accept the word \"unharmed\" appearing in the proviso as meaning uninjured. Neither the word \"permanent\" nor any other word susceptible of that meaning was used by Congress...The injuries inflicted upon his victim were of such degree that they cannot be read out of the Act's scope without contracting it to the point where almost all injuries would be excluded. We find no justification whatever for grafting the word permanent onto the language which Congress adopted.\"It further went on to conclude,\"This purpose [of this act is] to authorize a death penalty is clear even though Congress did not unmistakably mark some boundary between a pinprick and a permanently mutilated body. It is for Congress, and not for us, to decide whether it is wise public policy to inflict the death penalty at all. We do not know what provision of law, constitutional or statutory, gives us power wholly to nullify the clearly expressed purpose of Congress to authorize the death penalty\"With its judgement, it affirmed the court below's decision and affirmed Robinson's conviction. In further doing so, it upheld the Federal Kidnapping Act.\n\n\n=== Rutledge's dissent ===\nRutledge's dissent starts off being very straightforward, saying that \"the penalty of death should not be imposed upon conditions defined so uncertainly that their identity cannot be ascertained or is left open to grave doubt\". Rutledge goes on to talk about the various ambiguities with the majority's decision and letting that part of the law stand, saying,\"Few kidnappings take place without harm of some kind to the victim. They may be executed by force or by mere threats...Is the death penalty to be imposed for the identical cut or abrasion, whether minor or serious, inflicted during the act of taking the victim, merely because, in one case, the kidnapper releases or abandons him quickly, perhaps because forced to do so, but forbidden in another because he holds the victim until the injury heals? Is reward thus to be given for prolonging the agony?\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "La novillada (\"The Running of the Young Bulls\"), is a painting by Francisco de Goya, painted in 1780, when he was trying his hand at bullfighting (script period). It is part of the fourth series of tapestry cartoons for the Prince of Asturias' antechamber in the Pardo Palace.\n\n\n== Context ==\nGoya was an aficionado, and frequented the world of bullfighting, considered at the time to be \"the refuge of scoundrels where ruffians and adventurers are at ease\". He describes La Novillada as a cape pass involving several young men, but does not name himself along them, even though he more or less portrayed himself. He subsequently painted several portraits of bullfighters, the best-known of which is that of Pedro Romero.\n\n\n== History ==\nAll the paintings in the fourth series were destined for the antechamber of the Prince of Asturias, the future Charles IV and his wife Marie Louise de Parme, in the Pardo palace. The painting was delivered to the Royal Tapestry Factory on January 24, 1780 and received by its director, Cornelio Vandergoten. A document dated October 2, 1777, whose provenance is unknown, states that the La Novillada tapestry was to hang on the south wall of the princes' antechamber next to another tapestry: El Resguardo de tabacos.\nIt was considered lost until 1869, when the canvas was discovered in the basement of the Royal Palace in Madrid by Gregorio Cruzada Villaamil, and was returned to the Prado Museum in 1870 by the ordinances of January 19 and February 9, 1870, where it is exhibited in room 91. The painting was first mentioned in the Museo del Prado catalog in 1876.\nThe series was composed of El Ciego de la guitarra, El Columpio, Las Lavanderas, La Novillada, El Resguardo de tabacos, El Muchacho del pájaro et El Niño del árbol, Los Leñadores, El Majo de la guitarra, La Cita, El Médico, El Balancín and two lost pieces: El Perro and La Fuente.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe painting depicts a festival similar to Francisco Bayeu's Taureaux de Carabanchel. Historian José Camón Aznar sees a connection with Goya's childhood memories (when he tried his hand at bullfighting). It is said that the bright colors drove the weavers at the Royal Factory mad, as they were commissioned to create tapestries based on Goya's sketch.\nThe ensemble features a group of young people in colorful costumes, and in the main figure, who turns his head towards the viewers, a portrait of the artist himself has been seen. This is also what Claude Pelletier says: \"A witness to his time, Goya was probably an amateur bullfighter in his youth. Here, he has portrayed himself in a red costume, as the main character in this humble novillada.\nThe bright colors are characteristic of Goya's \"first period\", as is the abundance of Majos who were, depending on the occasion, either commoners or noblemen dressed as such. Édouard Manet described them in one of his best-known paintings, Jeune Homme en costume de majo. The majos and majas were known for their sartorial pursuits inspired by popular customs.\nHowever, Cornelio Vandergoten, the director of the production, gives a different version of Goya's interpretation of the scene. According to him, the figures here are in a sorto position.\n\nThe Swing and La Novillada could represent a passage written by Nicolás Fernández de Moratín, Leandro's father, in the clandestine poem Arte de las putas:\"Flee the right-handed one so accursed custom\nalways give the hurgonazo in passing\nto Cándido inciting, the great bullfighter\nwhich, by the prompt, is clean his thrust \"\n\n- Nicolás Fernández de Moratín, Arte de las putas (II, 135-138)\"Run away from this good habit so cursed\nalways give a blow of the saddle in passing\ninciting Candide, the great bullfighter\n\nwhose stockade is suddenly clean\"\nHowever, according to Jeannine Baticle, Goya didn't start frequenting the capital's Lumières until 1779, and it's likely that he only gained access to this poem - written in the early 1770s - through them, and therefore after the production of this carton.\n\n\n== Goya's La Tauromaquia ==\nIn addition to La Tauromaquia, Goya was greatly inspired by popular bullfighting games. There are several replicas of his Children Playing Bulls, including one in Madrid's Museo Lázaro Galdiano; The Picador, an oil on canvas (56 × 47 cm) in the Prado Museum, is thought to be a study for a larger painting for the Almeda de Osuna entitled Choice of Bulls.\nAfter his illness, which left him deaf, Goya devoted himself almost exclusively to bullfighting during a stay in Andalusia in 1790. The result was a series of twelve small metal paintings entitled Scènes de divertissements nationaux, which he presented as a means of “occupying his mortified imagination”. We usually refer to eight of these small paintings, which form a coherent whole twenty years before the Tauromachie gravée, as the Série Torrecilla, named after the marquis to whom this collection had belonged.\nThere are countless works on the subject of bullfighting, and they are not always easy to locate. Many are in private collections, such as La Pose des banderilles (1793–1794, oil on tin, 43 × 31 cm).\n\n\n== See also ==\nLa Tauromaquia\nFrancisco Goya's tapestry cartoons\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nMartinez-Novillo, Alvaro (1988).

        "content": "1982 Harmak incident  refers to the accidental infiltration of Iranian territory during the Soviet–Afghan War, in which Soviet forces strayed from the target of a Mujahideen base in southern Afghanistan and accidentally destroyed an asphalt factory in Iran.\n\n\n== Background ==\nBy 1982, the Soviet–Afghan War had been raging on for two years, and seemingly wasn't close to an end. The Soviets were in the control of major population centres while the rural areas were mostly under Mujahideen control.\n\n\n== Planning ==\nIn March 1982, the  Soviets decided to destroy a vital supply base at the village of Robat Jaali in southern Afghanistan just a few kilometres from the Pakistan-Afghanistan-Iran tripoint, given the nickname  of  \"The Bermuda Triangle\" by the Soviets. According to Soviet intelligence, this was a vital Mujahideen base with about 60 militants and huge cache of weapons and ammunition. The operation was planned in Moscow, and to maintain operational secrecy the Soviet military did not inform either the Afghan Army or KHAD as both had many Mujahideen informants.\nThe operation was commanded by General Anatoly Tabunshchikov, who in an Antonov command plane would follow the main strike force and do a photo evaluation of the raid, while the forces themselves would be led by Colonel Vladimir Aprelkin. The plan was complicated as the target was at a large distance and Soviet helicopters couldn't reach the target without refueling. Ultimately it was decided that a force of 600 Soviet troops, including Spetsnaz special forces, would assemble about 50 kilometres from Robat Jaali for refueling on 4 April. The next morning, the target would be bombed by about 12 Su-17s followed by 60 Mi-8 who would capture the target along with all its supplies. Then after six hours they would be refueled and return to base.\n\n\n== Incident ==\nThe operation did not go as planned. Just as the helicopters flew from their base for refueling point, they faced a severe sandstorm causing them to split into small groups, each of which had to reach the point on its own with the last groups reaching at night.\nOn the morning of 5 April, the strike force departed from the refueling point for the target, with Colonel Aprelkin as a passenger in the frontal helicopter. At the specified time, two Su-17s dropped parachute flares to mark the location of the target and the other Su-17s successfully bombed the target.\nHowever, some flares were released too high, and a strong wind blew them off course by several kilometres and they landed on the Iranian side of the border.\nAfter the arrival of the strike force, the leading helicopter crew who been there earlier told Colonel Aprelkin that they were not on their target location, but the commander, Colonel Aprelkin disagreed and stated that the strike force had not yet arrived at the target location. He ordered the pilot to keep flying towards the flares and the rest of the strike group followed.\nAfter some time they came across a road  with a civilian bus driving on it but no such roads were on the Soviet map. Colonel Aprelkin was again informed  but now the Colonel saw some buildings and he was convinced that it was their target of Robat Jaali. He issued an order to the force to engage.\nThe lead helicopter landed at the purported target and soon others in the strike force also landed. In about twenty minutes, the Soviet soldiers came out of their helicopters and captured the compound which was guarded by only two civilian guards.\nThe Soviets soon realised it wasn't their target but an ordinary civilian asphalt factory which was closed on that day. \nAt the same time, General Tabunshchikov who came for damage assessment saw the situation and informed Colonel Aprelkin over radio that the strike force had crossed the Iranian border and landed near the town of Harmak. General Tabunshchikov ordered the strike force to evacuate immediately. He informed his superiors telling them, \"Our troops are on foreign territory!\"\n\n\n== Iranian response ==\nTwo F-4 Phantom II fighters from the Iranian Air Force arrived and opened fire on the landed Mi-8s, they were followed by two more F-4s. The Soviet MiG-23s had been ordered by the General not to engage. \"It was bad enough that we had attacked the Iranian town,\"  Tabunshchikov said, \"and there was no need to escalate the problem by shooting down Iranian airplanes over Iran.\" The Iranian F-4s managed to destroy two Mi-8s.\nBy that time a group of Iranian Army tanks approached and started firing, the Soviets were again ordered not to engage; the Iranians retook the factory. The Soviets hastily retreated, leaving some personnel behind who they were forced to walk the three hours back to the Afghan border.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nMujahideen became aware of the Soviet failure and were able to evacuate their base before the Soviet raid. The, Iranian government filed diplomatic protests with the Soviet Union. Soviet officials issued a formal statement accepting responsibility for the mistake and compensation was paid. The official Soviet inquiry put the blame on Colonel Aprelkin for inaccurate navigating and unauthorised attack. He was demoted but remained as a commander in Afghanistan.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Bateshwar Sthan ( Sanskrit: बटेश्वर स्थान ) is an ancient site related to the Vedic sage Brahmarshi Vashishtha at Kahalgaon in Bhagalpur district of Bihar, India. It is believed as the Taposthali ( penance place ) of the sage Vashishtha where he established Shivlinga known as Bateshwar Nath Mahadeva. \n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe temple was named after the sage Vashishtha. Earlier this temple was known as Bashishtheshvar ( Vashishtheshwar ) Mahadev, which later came to be known as Bateshwar Mahadev. Thus the place is called as Bateshwar Sthan.\n\n\n== Description ==\nIt is said that Sage Vasishtha performed his penance here and worshiped Lord Shiva there. There is a temple of Lord Shiva known as Baba Bateshwar Nath Mahadev Mandir in the campus of Bateshwar Sthan. The temple is at foothills of Bateshwar mountain on the bank of the north flowing Ganga located ten kilometres away from Kahalgaon. This is also the confluence point of the Ganga and Kosi rivers. According to legend, it is said that in Puranas it is mentioned that Kahalgaon's Bateshwar Sthan was planned to make Kashi Dham but due to lack of some land it remained incomplete in the making of Kashi Dham. According to legendary story, after the marriage of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati, they were living at Kailash. But Goddess Parvati was not feeling comfortable there because Kailash was in the territory of Parvatraj Himalaya. It is said Lord Shiva realised it and he wished to fullfill by choosing another destination for living. Devashree Narada and Lord Vishwakarma was assigned to find piece of land equal to Kailash. For this, the condition was that the entire plot of land should be situated on the bank of Ganga river where Ganga flows northwards ( Uttarvahini Ganga ) and that place should also be sacred. Then Devashree Narada and Lord Vishwakarma searched three places, they were Bateshwar Sthan of Kahalgaon, Chitabhumi of Devgarh in Jharkhand, and Varanasi of Uttar Pradesh. Due to the presence of Shaktipeeth at Chitabhumi, this place was not considered suitable for the residence of both of them. Similarly there was a shortcoming with Bateshwar Sthan situated near Kahalgaon, this land was a bit less than the size of Kailash. After that Varanasi was finally selected as Kashi of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati. According to Puranas, Bateshwar Sthan is also known as Gupta Kashi. It is believed that Lord Buddha also stayed here for three months to do meditation during the Varshavasa period.\nThere is a temple of Maa Kali just opposite of the Bateshwar Nath Mahadev Mandir.  It is said that in ancient times, it used to be a major center of Tantra Vidya. The origination of the ancient Vikramshila University is also related to this place which is three kilometers away from the temple. Earlier Tantra Vidya was taught in the ancient Vikramshila University.\n\n\n== History ==\nIt is said that the temple was built in 1216 CE by the King of Sen Dynasty in Bengal. According to the Vangiya Kayastha Kul Panchika, during the reign of the Sen rulers of Bengal, Ballala Sena came here and worshipped the Shiva lingam on the occasion of declaring his father-in-law Vata Krishna Mitra as the king of Magadha. Similarly it was renovated in 1272 CE by Mathuranatha Chattopadhyaya who a resident of Hooghly in Bengal.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Boulmer Lifeboat Station is a former Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) station, which was located at the village of Boulmer in the county of Northumberland. \nA lifeboat, provided by the Royal National Institute for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck (RNIPLS), was first stationed here by the Newcastle Shipwreck Association in 1825.\nThe RNLI station was closed in 1968.\n\n\n== History ==\nA station was opened at Boulmer in 1925 under the management of the Newcastle Shipwreck Association (NSA), following a request by Mr. William Clarke to the (RNIPLS) for a lifeboat. A boathouse was constructed by the NSA, and a lifeboat was duly provided, a 27-foot 6in 10-oared North Country, or \"Greathead\", type lifeboat, built by Thomas Wake of Sunderland.\nThis first Boulmer lifeboat would serve 27 years, and save 32 lives. On November 2nd 1844, the Boulmer lifeboat made three trips to the wreck of the Iris and would rescue 8 men. Lt. John Brunton, RN, of H.M. Coastguard was awarded the Silver Medal.\nIn 1851, the Boulmer boat was reported as being in poor condition, and a request was made of the RNIPLS to provide a replacement. A 30-foot self-righting lifeboat built by James Beeching of Great Yarmouth was provided, at a cost of £130. It was funded by Algernon Percy, 4th Duke of Northumberland, and was named Prudhoe, the Duke having formerly been known as Lord Prudhoe.\nIn 1853, Boulmer Lifeboat Station would be transferred to the management of the RNIPLS, which became the RNLI the following year.\nPrudhoe(I) didn't serve long at Boulmer. The boat was disliked by the crew, and a second replacement was requested. This time, a 30-foot 10-oar self-righting boat was supplied by Forrestt of Limehouse, London, arriving in Boulmer on 30 November 1854. This time costing £150, it was once again funded by the Duke of Northumberland, and was again named Prudhoe. Whether the boat was no good is up for speculation. It capsized when being towed back to Newcastle, but then went on to serve at Thorpeness, Newhaven and Fishguard, in service until 1885.\nOn 13 March 1913, in a severe gale, heavy seas, and dense fog, the french steam trawler Tadorne of Boulogne with 30 crew ran aground near Howick Haven. Three men tried to make shore in the ships boat, but two were drowned. The rest of the crew clung to the rigging, as large waves crashed over the boat. On surveying the scene, Albert Grey, 4th Earl Grey of nearby Howick Hall despatched a messenger to raise the Boulmer lifeboat. After an extraordinary effort, and two trips, the Boulmer lifeboat managed to save 25 men off the trawler. Coxswain William Stephenson was awarded a Gold Medal from the French government, the RNLI Silver Medal, and two awards from the French Lifeboat Service, Societe Hospitaliers Sauveteurs Bretons. The wreck of the steam engine is still visible today.\nA Clayton launch and recovery tractor was trialled at Boulmer in 1922, but with little success. An article in \"The Lifeboat\" magazine of 1926 highlighted that some 115 people of the village Boulmer, around 80%, could be involved in the launch of the lifeboat. As a result, the women lifeboat launchers were awarded The Thanks of the Institution inscribed on Vellum.\nIn 1927, another Clayton launch tractor was placed at Boulmer, but a larger more powerful FWD Ltd tractor, T23, was trialled in 1928. The lifeboat and carriage were hauled a ½-mile across mud, and then 150 yards out to sea, launching in just 24 minutes, proving the tractor a great success. T26 was placed on service in 1930.\nSoon afterwards followed a motor-powered lifeboat. L. P. and St. Helen (ON 703), a 35-foot 6in Self-righting motor lifeboat built by S.E. Saunders of Cowes, so named after her benefactors, Miss Ann Lovelock, Mr A H Pett, and Miss Helen Turner, arrived in Boulmer in 1931.\nIn 1967, it was decided to withdraw the All-weather lifeboat from Boulmer. The boat was formally withdrawn on 31 March 1968, replaced on 1 April with an Inshore D-class (D-100) lifeboat on station for a 1-year trial. With only two service launches, and no lives saved, the D-class was also withdrawn at the end of the summer season. After 143 years of service, 199 service launches, and with 236 lives saved, Boulmer RNLI lifeboat station closed at the end of 1968.\n1969 saw the foundation of the Boulmer Volunteer Rescue Service.[1] The former RNLI boathouse was given over to the rescue service, which is still in operation to this day.\n\n\n== Station honours ==\nThe following are awards made at Boulmer.\n\nGold Medal, awarded by the French Government\nWilliam Stephenson, Coxswain - 1913\nRNLI Silver Medal\nLt.

        "content": "Marquess Yoshichika Tokugawa was a Japanese botanist, hunter, patron of the arts and sciences, and politician. He was the 19th head of the Owari-Tokugawa family, one of the Tokugawa Gosanke.\n\n\n== Life ==\nYoshichika was born into the Matsudaira family of Echizen (now Fukui), which originated as a cadet branch of the Tokugawa family and was closely related to the family through repeated intermarriages. He attended Gakushuin, just like other children from his class (kazoku), where he spent most of his time reading books about explorers such as Henry Stanley and Roald Amundsen. He started studying seriously around 1902, when he entered a crammer called Jishusha.\nHe matriculated at Tokyo Imperial University in 1908 and studied history. He married Yoneko, the daughter of the 18th head of the Owari-Tokugawa family and adopted her family name, immediately becoming the 19th head of the family. His thesis in 1911 was on the management of the vast Kiso estate traditionally owned by his family. Having been interested in botany from a young age, he decided to stay at the university to further his interests. During his time at the university, he granted the faculty of the university access to his family's treasures. In May 1915, he held an exhibition of his family's artefacts at the Sanjo Hall of the university's Hongo Campus. Overwhelmed by the interest shown by the visitors, he recognised the importance of preserving and exhibiting family artefacts. He set up the Tokugawa Art Museum and the Hosa Library in the 1930s to permanently preserve and exhibit the family artefacts.\nHis passion for botany and hunting made him travel extensively, including his elephant and tiger hunting tour in British Malaya, which gave him the nickname \"toragari no tonosama (tiger-hunting lord)\". He befriended local sultans in Malaya, and after returning from his second visit in 1929, he started learning the Malay language. He hosted Sultan Ibrahim of Johor and Ranee Sylvia Brett of the White Rajah of Sarawak in the 1930s.\nDuring the Second World War, he went to what was now Japanese-occupied Malaya as a military advisor, where he served as the director at what is now the National Museum of Singapore. However, as Japan faced significant losses, he had to return to Japan in 1944. The English botanist E. J. H. Corner, who was asked to continue serving as the director of the Singapore Botanical Gardens during the occupation, wrote about the marquess's activities in his memoir \"The MARQUIS - A Tale of Syonan-to\".\nAfter the war, he funded the founding of the Japan Socialist Party. His fortune had diminished to no more than 20% of its pre-war extent. He served as an honorary chair at various charitable organisations. He died in 1976.\n\n\n== References ==",

The play, heavily influenced by the stage adaptation of Robbery Under Arms - in which Rede had appeared - was very popular and much imitated by the authors of other plays about Ned Kelly.\nIt is not to be confused with The Kelly Gang by Arnold Denham. It is likely Denham's play plagiarised from Rede's but due to the lack of copyright protection at the time Denham escaped consequences for this.\nThe play debuted in rural regions in 1896 then transferred to Melbourne two years later. The play was very popular and unlike an earlier play about Kelly, Ostracised, was not banned. This encouraged numerous imitations, many of which borrowed from Rede's play and Robbery Under Arms.\n\n\n== Critical reaction ==\nThe Bulletin said \"The sentiments are neatly ladled out to suit all tastes.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Norman Edward Strachan (born 18 September 1934) is a former motorcycle speedway rider from England.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nStrachan, born in Poole, was a cycle speedway rider before he learned how to ride speedway at the Matcham's Park training facilities. He began his British leagues career riding for Poole Pirates during the 1953 Speedway National League Division Two season.\nStrachan built up his reputation at Poole and would become a fan's favourite at the club and helped the Pirates win the double of league and Knockout Cup in 1955 but suffered a serious hand injury working in a local sawmill in 1956.\nThe injury affected his speedway career for the next few seasons and it was not until 1960 that he returned to regular action. In 1962, he was described as an enigma because of his contrasting form and contributed towards Poole's two consecutive Provincial League titles in 1961 and 1962.\nHe made 303 appearances for Poole from 1953 to 1967 and was inducted into the Hall of fame in 1994. In 1968, he left Poole when he was allocated to the Newport Wasps and rode for them for three seasons before moving on to Oxford Cheetahs in 1971. \nHe retired after the 1974 season, by which time he had also ridden for Coatbridge Tigers and Long Eaton Rangers.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Las Fuentes (in Aragonese: Las Fuents) is a district of Zaragoza (Spain). It borders the districts of Casco Antiguo, Torrero - La Paz and San José and the municipalities of Pastriz, El Burgo de Ebro, Fuentes de Ebro and Mediana de Aragón. In addition to the neighborhood of Las Fuentes, it includes others such as Montemolín (also called Bajo Aragón) or the area surrounding the Pabellón Príncipe Felipe. It extends as far as the neighborhood of La Cartuja. Its borders are delimited by the rivers Ebro, Huerva, Miguel Servet Street and the railway bypass. \nIt is governed by a Municipal Board.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe name of the neighborhood comes from the many springs and lagoons that were formed in this area due to the flooding of the Ebro and Huerva rivers.\nIn 1885 the Municipal Slaughterhouse was built and the first houses were built around it, and later the Utrillas Railway Station was inaugurated (now converted into a shopping center).\nIn 1950 the first consolidated nuclei began to settle around Hogar Obrero and Rusiñol streets. Later, in the 60s and 70s, the neighborhood grew due to the arrival of numerous emigrants from Bajo Aragón, which earned it the nickname of Montemolín neighborhood. The neighborhood benefited from the urban development interests of Manuel Escoriaza y Fabro, who in addition to owning plots of land in the area, owned the Zaragoza tramways, which led him to support lines to the district. This history of a working class neighborhood has traditionally defined its character and its vote tends to be mostly for left-wing candidates.\nOn December 11, 1973, on the first floor of numbers 41, 43 and 45 of Rodrigo Rebolledo Street, where the Bonafonte Brothers' upholstery industry was located, 23 people died in a fire. The tragedy, attributed to failures in the transformer, provoked an intense neighborhood movement that resulted in a demonstration protesting the safety conditions in small industries, the first authorized demonstration in pre-democratic Zaragoza.\nMore recently, the urbanization of the surroundings of the Torre Ramona Park and the surroundings of the Pabellón Príncipe Felipe, still incomplete, took place. The expansion of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of Zaragoza and the plans to reform the sector supported by the Horticulture Exhibition of 2014.\n\n\n== Infrastructures and services ==\n\nCompromiso de Caspe Street is the main street in the district. It is also worth mentioning Miguel Servet Street. Both are originated at the confluence of Camino de las Torres and Paseo de la Constitución, being their main roads towards the center of the city. The Plaza de Utrillas, a former railway station now converted into a shopping center, is one of the main centers of commerce and centrality in the district.\nAlso noteworthy is the Puente de la Unión (popularly known as Puente de Las Fuentes), which allows communication with another district (Margen Izquierda). From the district it is also possible to cross the Ebro through the Weir Footbridge, built during Expo 2008, and the Manuel Giménez Abad Bridge, of the Z-30. Parallel to the latter is the Railway Bridge of the Ebro river in Zaragoza. The Z-40 also crosses the district, separating the neighborhood of La Cartuja from the rest and crossing the Ebro on a bridge of its own. The Bicentennial Footbridge was also built in La Cartuja during the Expo.\nThe most important green area in the district is the Torre Ramona Park, which is next to the school of the same name. There are also landscaped extensions on the banks of the rivers Ebro (introduced by the Riverside Plan accompanying Expo 2008) and Huerva (Huerva Linear Park, Bruil Park).\nIt has Las Fuentes Stadium and the Alberto Maestro Municipal Sports Center.\nIn September 2018, the first Juventus supporters' club in Spain opened its doors: Juventus Club España and on February 19 of the following year it was inaugurated by the former Bianconeri player, Moreno Torricelli.\nOf the educational offer it is worth mentioning that it is in this district where the Veterinary School of Zaragoza is located.\nAs for transportation, the main AUZSA lines are the 22, 24 and 30, which connect it to the center and the University and Delicias Districts, the 44, which is the one that connects with the Margen Izquierda in a similar way to the circular lines, and lines 51, 52 and 25, which cross the city towards the center and then go to the Zaragoza-Delicias Intermodal Station. The 25 is the only line that connects La Cartuja.\n\n\n=== Municipal Slaughterhouse ===\n\nThis multiple building of 25,000 square meters, which attracted the first residents of the neighborhood, became in the 90's the space that defines the participatory personality of the residents of Las Fuentes.\nWork began in 1880 under the direction of the municipal architect Ricardo Magdalena, at number 57 of what is now Miguel Servet Avenue. A location considered ideal at that time, since it was close to the city, but at the same time isolated by the natural boundaries of the Ebro and Huerva rivers, which in turn facilitated drainage. The first population centers were formed around it.\nIts inauguration in 1885 coincided with the II Aragonese Exhibition of Agricultural Products, Industry and Arts, organized by the Economic Society of Friends of the Country.\nThe Slaughterhouse, built mainly of red brick and in a functional modernist style, consists of three warehouses, where the slaughtering and airing of cattle took place, and a central courtyard for the distribution of the products. Each pavilion had its own washing place for the offal. In the center of the courtyard was the fountain of the Buen Pastor, by Dionisio Lasuén. today placed again in that place, after having been placed in Paseo de la Constitución in the capital city of Maña.\nAfter falling into disuse for years, this immense urban surface was largely used as a sculpture workshop by the Pablo Gargallo Association. As of 2020, it is known as the Salvador Allende Cultural Center.\nThe building on the right has been completely renovated by the architect Ricardo Usón. Since February 1991 it has housed the Ricardo Magdalena Public Library. The left nave houses the Cantalobos Leisure Center, for children from 6 to 14 years of age.\nEntering through Florencio Ballesteros Street is the La Piraña nursery school and a little further along the street is the Senior Citizen Center and the Youth House, opened in November 1990. Two years later, in June 1992, the first issue of Contra Corriente magazine was published.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Additional sources ===\n\"Juntas municipales: Presidentes\".

        "content": "Dufourea africana is a species of corticolous (bark-dwelling), foliose lichen in the family Teloschistaceae. It occurs in Kenya and Uganda.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe lichen was first described by the Swedish lichenologist Ove Almborn in 1963, who classified it in the genus Xanthoria. The type specimen was collected in 1949 by the Dutch mycologist Rudolf Arnold Maas Geesteranus from the Tinderer Forest Reserve in Kisumu-Londiani (Kenya) at an elevation of 3,200 m (10,500 ft); there, it was found growing on an isolated and sun-exposed Podocarpus milanjianus. Patrik Frödén and colleagues transferred the taxon to the genus Dufourea in 2013, following a molecular phylogenetics-led reorganisation of the Teloschistaceae.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe lichen has an orange thallus that usually spreads irregularly on its substrate, with lobes up to 1 mm wide. The thallus surface has regions of soralia that are both laminal and marginal, and makes orange-coloured soredia; apothecia (fruiting bodies) have not been observed to occur in this species. The photobiont partners of the lichen are members of the green algal genus Trebouxia. They have roundish cells measuring about 10–15 μm, situated in an algal layer that is about 30–40 μm thick. Like most Teloschistaceae members, it contains parietin, a secondary metabolite (lichen product).\n\n\n== Habitat and distribution ==\nIt occurs on the trunks of trees, particularly wayside and isolated ones, in open woodland and shrubland at elevations from 2,500 to 3,000 metres (8,200 to 9,800 ft). Found in Kenya and Uganda, it is considered an uncommon species.\n\n\n== References ==",

It initially flows in northeastern direction, gradually turning to the southeast and forming a large arc bulging to the north. Its valley is deep and sparsely forested. The river flows into the northern arm of the Kardzhali Reservoir on the Arda at an altitude of 332 m. It drains the northeastern slopes of the Pereliksko–Prespanski Ridge and the westernmost parts of the Gorata Ridge.\nIts drainage basin covers a territory of 301 km2, or 5.19% of the Arda's total. The river has predominantly rain–snow feed. The average annual flow at its mouth is 5 m3/s.\nThe Borovitsa flows in Smolyan, Plovdiv and Kardzhali Provinces. There are three villages along its course, all of them in Kardzhali Province — Bezvodno and Voynovo in Chernoochene Municipality, and Nenkovo in Kardzhali Municipality. Along its course is situated the Borovitsa Reservoir which provides potable water for the town of Kardzhali.\nNear its confluence with the Arda at the modern Kardzhali Reservoir are located the ruins of the medieval Patmos Fortress.\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== References ==\nМичев (Michev), Николай (Nikolay); Михайлов (Mihaylov), Цветко (Tsvetko); Вапцаров (Vaptsarov), Иван (Ivan); Кираджиев (Kiradzhiev), Светлин (Svetlin) (1980).

Johnson Apartments also known as LBJ Apartments is a 10 story tall apartment building that was built in 1973 in Buffalo, New York and is currently a senior apartment center. The building is currently owned by the Buffalo Municipal Housing Authority.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Lyndon B. Johnson Apartments was built in 1973 as a 10-story tall apartment unit with 206 units inside the building in Buffalo.\nDuring the December 2022 North American winter storm the power was shut down in the building due to the storm. Due to the power outage, a 91-year-old woman named Doris Williams froze to death. After the death of Doris Williams, the daughter of her sued the Buffalo Municipal Housing Authority citing wrongful death and other claims of mismanagement of the building.\nIn August, 2023, a large 10-story tall mural was made on the side of the building. The mural was created by Aaron Li-Hill.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ostracised, or Every Man's Hand Against Them is a 1881 Australian play about Ned Kelly by E.C. Martin. It was the first straight dramatisation of the Kelly story from an Australian writer although there had been one in London. The play was banned in Sydney.\nMartin was a journalist and occasional playwright (What May Happen to a Man in Victoria). He claimed to have \"not written it to pander to the morbid tastes of the public, but rather-to show that vice ever meets its reward.\"\nAccording to academic Richard Fotheringham \"Martin seems to have developed the idea that Dan Kelly was the true psycho path of the piece and that Ned Kelly... had been dragged unwillingly into the disaster.\" The play appears to have been interspersed with songs.\nIn the lead up to the play debuting there were rumours the play would be banned \"on the grounds of its alleged demoralising tendency, and the reflections cast by it upon the character of the police force ; but as the play\nproceeded, it became evident that theie rumours were unfounded.\" \n\n\n== Public reaction ==\nContemporary accounts say the play \"hit the morbid public taste in Melbourne.\" According to the Truth the play \"made a pot of money\".\nSydney Sportsman said the play \"made a pot of money, though the dramatist... saw little of it.\" Another account said \"the author did not collect in full, for every barnstorming co. in Australia froze on to the play with more or less distorted versions of it.\" \nThe Perth Daily News said \"The piece was one of the greateat successes ever known, and for six solid weeks the performance ran to huge business. The papers gave the piece 'what for,' but the public appetite was fairly whetted.\"\nA writer claimed prior to a performance of the play in Benalla, local police advised the removal of the prologue involving Harry Power, and this was done. Mrs Kelly reportedly attended this performance. Reporting on this performance the Benalla Standard said \"the audience... throughout were orderly; and although several well-known Kelly sympathisers were present, the attendance of the three policemen on duty was not required.\"\nAnother story says the real Constable Longeran attended one performance and objected during the show to how he was portrayed. \n\n\n=== Sydney banning ===\nThe play had two seasons in Melbourne and toured New Zealand but was banned from playing in Sydney in 1882 (after one performance there) due to the intervention of the Inspector General of Police.  According to contemporay reports, the play, then called Ostracised, or the Downfall of Crime, debuted in Sydney at Victoria Hall on 8 April 1882. On Monday 10 April 1882 audiences arrived to see a second production and were told that the play at been banned. Instead a production of Ticket of Leave Man was put on. According to The Bulletin in 1920, \"after the overture\" the manger \"stepped to the front of the curtain and announced that the police had banned the play. Uproar ensued. Some men-of-war’s men from the Raleigh then in port got at loggerheads with the police; reinforcements were rushed up, the lights were put out, and so were the rioters.\"  \nThis banning effectively ended production of plays about the Kelly gang for over a decade until The Kelly Gang played in Melbourne in 1898 without controversy, prompting a boom in Ned Kelly plays over the next decade.\n\n\n== Critical reaction ==\nThe Weekly Times said \"The dialogue is poorly written, and the first two acts drag somewhat, and could be judiciously curtailed. The character are unusually numerous, and representing persons familiar by repute to the audience.\"\nAccording to the Leader the author \"wanted to evolve a moral play from the tragic incidents counected with the career and fate of the Kelly gang of outlaws; but the actors, desirous of rendering the piece more diverting than instructive, introduced so much of the farcical element that it was at times extremely difficult to trace tho author's meaning.\"\nThe Ballarat Star said the author \"has managed to string together the incidents of the Kellys career with some degree of consecutivehess, and prepared a drama which at the events raises a laugh and evidently excites the auditor’s interest. It is not a very high literary ambition to produce such a piece but apparently it pays, and - we presume - this was the real reason for its production.\"\nThe Evening Journal said \"I am astonished at the performance being permitted. I am quite willing to admit that the author does not intend its production to do any harm, and that he may even have had a moral purpose in view in writing it. But it does harm unquestionably, and the moral doesn't show out. There is certainly... nothing dangerous in it. The Chief Commissioner of Police is not called a fool or a coward, nor is Ned Kelly held up as an example of injured innocence. But the effect of making these four bloodthirsty cowardly murderers the centre features in a play is bad.\"\nThe Benalla Standard said, \"The several characters were well sustained by the different parties engaged, and the shooting of Constable Fitzpatrick by Dan Kelly was most realistic. The murder of Sergeant Kennedy was a most affecting scene, and his piteous appeals for mercy produced the most profound sensation, especially when it was resolved that he should be killed, to put him out of misery.\"\nOne critic said \"A wit remarked to me that the play was made up of firing revolvers, which would not go off, and dancing Irish jigs. The guns and revolvers had a knack of missing fire jnst when a leading character had to be killed... Honesty speaking the production is most reprehensible, and I regret that a gentleman like Mr Martin should have allowed his name, to be associatid with a catch-penny affair. Kate Kelly was not allowed to earn a few\nshillings by exhibiting herself the night her her brother was hanged why should these play actors be allowed to gather a few pound by catering to the morbid curiosity of-the evil disposed?\"\nAccording to one review \"the character of Ned Kelly is rather inappropriately drawn, there being a deficiency of random roughness which the original possessed. The man in the play is gifted with nioro brains than the real bushranger had. The play is not an inviting one, and there is not so much 'moral' as might have been embodied in it.\"\nThe Bulletin said \"Ostracised is stated, as a literary production, to be beneath criticism and beneath contempt.\" However a critic in the same magazine in 1898 said the play was superor to the later The Kelly Gang.\nReviewing a 1882 production at Victoria Hall the Sydney Daily Telegraph said \"The leading characters werw fuil|y sustained, and the whole production was a decided success.\"\n\n\n== Original 1881 cast ==\n\nThere were 36 speaking characters.

        "content": "Mass injection flow refers to inviscid, adiabatic flow through a constant area duct where the effect of mass addition is considered.  For this model, the duct area remains constant, the flow is assumed to be steady and one-dimensional, and mass is added within the duct. Because the flow is adiabatic, unlike in Rayleigh flow, the stagnation temperature is a constant.  Compressibility effects often come into consideration, though this flow model also applies to incompressible flow.\nFor supersonic flow (an upstream Mach number greater than 1), deceleration occurs with mass addition to the duct and the flow can become choked. Conversely, for subsonic flow (an upstream Mach number less than 1), acceleration occurs and the flow can become choked given sufficient mass addition.  Therefore, mass addition will cause both supersonic and subsonic Mach numbers to approach Mach 1, resulting in choked flow.\n\n\n== Theory ==\nThe 1D mass injection flow model begins with a mass-velocity relation derived for mass injection into a steady, adiabatic, frictionless, constant area flow of calorically perfect gas:\n\n  \n    \n      \n         \n        \n          \n            \n              d\n              m\n            \n            m\n          \n        \n        =\n        −\n        \n          \n            \n              d\n              u\n            \n            u\n          \n        \n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              M\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            −\n            1\n          \n          )\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\ {\\frac {dm}{m}}=-{\\frac {du}{u}}\\left(M^{2}-1\\right)}\n  \n\nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        m\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle m}\n  \n represents a mass flux, \n  \n    \n      \n        m\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              m\n              ˙\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          /\n        \n        A\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle m={\\dot {m}}/A}\n  \n.

In the following derivations, the constant \n  \n    \n      \n        R\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle R}\n  \n is used to denote the specific gas constant (i.e. \n  \n    \n      \n        R\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              R\n              ¯\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          /\n        \n        M\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle R={\\bar {R}}/M}\n  \n).\n\n\n=== Mass-Velocity Relation ===\nWe begin by establishing a relationship between the differential enthalpy, pressure, and density of a calorically perfect gas:\n\nFrom the adiabatic energy equation (\n  \n    \n      \n        d\n        \n          h\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        =\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle dh_{0}=0}\n  \n) we find:\n\nSubstituting the enthalpy-pressure-density relation (1) into the adiabatic energy relation (2) yields\n\nNext, we find a relationship between differential density, mass flux (\n  \n    \n      \n        m\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              m\n              ˙\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          /\n        \n        A\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle m={\\dot {m}}/A}\n  \n), and velocity:\n\nSubstituting the density-mass-velocity relation (4) into the modified energy relation (3) yields\n\nSubstituting the 1D steady flow momentum conservation equation (see also the Euler equations) of the form \n  \n    \n      \n        d\n        p\n        =\n        −\n        ρ\n        u\n        d\n        u\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle dp=-\\rho udu}\n  \n into (5) yields\n\nFrom the ideal gas law we find,\n\nand from the definition of a calorically perfect gas we find,\n\nSubstituting expressions (7) and (8) into the combined equation (6) yields\n\nUsing the speed of sound in an ideal gas (\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          a\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        γ\n        R\n        T\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a^{2}=\\gamma RT}\n  \n) and the definition of the Mach number (\n  \n    \n      \n        M\n        =\n        u\n        \n          /\n        \n        a\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle M=u/a}\n  \n) yields\n\nThis is the mass-velocity relationship for mass injection into a steady, adiabatic, frictionless, constant area flow of calorically perfect gas.\n\n\n=== Mass-Mach Relation ===\nTo find a relationship between differential mass and Mach number, we will find an expression for \n  \n    \n      \n        d\n        u\n        \n          /\n        \n        u\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle du/u}\n  \n solely in terms of the Mach number, \n  \n    \n      \n        M\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle M}\n  \n.

The competition license was transferred to Fabrício Granito, who has owned and run the pageant since 2024.\nSince the establishment of Miss Grand Brazil, Rio de Janeiro representatives have not won the title yet. The highest achievement they obtained was the first runner-up, won in 2014 by an appointed Camila Coutinho.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe state of Rio de Janeiro has participated in the Miss Grand Brazil pageant since the first edition which was held in 2014. However, its first three representatives were appointed. The first Miss Grand Rio de Janeiro was held in September 2021 after the state franchise was granted to a local organizer led by Noemi Rosseto. The contest, held virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic, consisted of 20 finalists, of whom a model Keila Campbell was elected the winner. Campbell later participated in the national pageant held the following year but was unplaced.\nLater in 2024, after Miss Brazil CNB lost the national license to another organizer, Evandro Hazzy, led by Hazzy Top Talent, the license of Miss Grand Rio de Janeiro was then transferred to Fabrício Granito of Hel Ecossistema.\n\n\n== Editions ==\nThe following table details Miss Grand Rio de Janeiro's annual editions since 2021.\n\n\n== National competition ==\nThe following is a list of representatives of the state of Rio de Janeiro in the Miss Grand Brazil national pageant.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Miss Grand Brazil at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "Hermann Seger (1832–1893) was a German ceramicist who is widely credited with pioneering the development of the pyrometric cone, which enabled the rapid growth of the ceramic industry around the turn of the century.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nSeger was born in the German Province of Posen in 1839 to wealthy parents and studied under various ceramic scientists at the Royal Technical Institute in Berlin.\nAfter graduating he managed an aluminum and metal processing plant in Kreuzkirche. In 1868 he graduated from the University of Rostock and briefly managed a chemical factory in Sweden.\nSeger was inspired by the significant advances being made in most fields of science and technology at the time and became interested in advancing the field of ceramic science in a similar manner. He became editor of a ceramic trade journal in 1872 and used his new position to draw attention to various advances being made abroad, such as the continuous kiln and new machinery.\nSeger's 1876 essay The Constitution of Plastic Clays and the Kaolins helped promote the understanding that most clay behavior is a result of its chemical composition, paving the way for further development of ceramic studies.\nIn 1878 he was appointed first director of the Chemical-Technical Experiment Station at the Royal Porcelain Factory, Berlin (KPM). Soon after his arrival he was given two samples of Japanese porcelain bodies and was inspired to develop a porcelain consisting only of quartz, feldspar, and clay substance, which has since led to a variety of porcelains known as Seger porcelain.\nHe worked with Georg Wilhelm Timm to develop new methods of applying glazes and engobes to porcelain and whiteware. Seger also experimented with glaze formulations, developing new color effects and lead-free glazes.\nOne of Seger's most impactful works was his 1886 essay Standard Cones for the Measurement of Temperatures in the Kilns of the Ceramic Industries, which was the first to specify formulas for pyrometric cones. These cones enabled ceramicists to precisely identify the actual firing temperature for the first time by monitoring the cones' slumping during firing. \nIn 1890 Seger left the KPM due to declining health and spent the remainder of his life focused on editing his trade journal Thonindustrie-Zeitung. He died on October 30, 1893.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nSeger married Emma Schur on September 11, 1875.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nSeger had a large impact on ceramic industry and art. His work helped spur greater interest in the chemistry and molecular properties of ceramics and formed the basis of most following ceramic research.\nThe American Ceramic Society's first action after approving their constitution was to translate the complete works of Seger, since he was considered the world's pioneering ceramicist.\nHe is commonly credited with creating the Unity Molecular Formula (UMF) method of glaze formulation, which is sometimes referred to as the Seger formula. It functions on the basis of viewing glazes not by their raw ingredient composition, but instead by their elemental composition by mole percent.\nSeger's pyrometric cones remain the most effective gauge of the heat-work experienced by ceramics during firing, and continue to be widely used internationally in ceramic industries and art. These are often referred to as Seger cones.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Malka Arda (Bulgarian: Малка Арда) is a 41 km long river in southern Bulgaria, a left tributary of the Arda of the Maritsa drainage.\nThe river takes its source under the name Mrazliv Dol at an altitude of 1,716 m in the Momuna Voda locality in the Pereliksko–Prespanski Ridge of the western Rhodope Mountains, north of the Momchul Yunak refuge. It flows in a deep narrow valley in direction southeast until the village of Slaveyno, after which it turns south–southeast for the rest of its length. Near the village of Banite, the river passes through a small valley extension, after which its valley becomes canyon-like and difficult to access, with numerous meanders along the mountain slopes. It flows into the Arda at an altitude of 488 m some 2 km south of the village of Galabovo. It drains the southeastern slopes of the Pereliksko–Prespanski Ridge.\nIts drainage basin covers a territory of 142 km2, or 2.45% of the Arda's total. The river has predominantly rain–snow feed with high water in January and low water in August. The average annual flow at Banite is 2.11 m3/s.\nThe Malka Arda flows entirely in Smolyan Province. There are six villages along its course — Kutela, Slaveyno and Petkovo in Smolyan Municipality, and Malka Arda, Oryahovets and Banite in Banite Municipality. There are hot mineral springs at Banite.\nA 14.3 km stretch of the third class III-863 road Sokolovtsi–Slaveyno–Banite follows its valley between the latter two villages. \n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\nМичев (Michev), Николай (Nikolay); Михайлов (Mihaylov), Цветко (Tsvetko); Вапцаров (Vaptsarov), Иван (Ivan); Кираджиев (Kiradzhiev), Светлин (Svetlin) (1980).

On 8 December 2020, he signed his first professional contract with the club, agreeing to a deal until 2022.\nBreno was not included in the 2022 Copa São Paulo de Futebol Júnior squad due to a knee injury. On 2 September 2022, he further extended his link until October 2024.\nBreno was mainly a fifth-choice behind João Paulo, Vladimir, Diógenes and Paulo Mazoti in the club's first-ever relegation, and was one of the several players deemed surplus to requirements for the 2024 campaign. In February 2024, however, he was registered by the club in the 2024 Campeonato Paulista, after being reintegrated and becoming a fourth-choice behind João Paulo, new signing Gabriel Brazão and Diógenes.\nOn 4 April 2024, Breno was loaned to Paranavaí for the year's Campeonato Paranaense Série Prata.\n\n\n== Career statistics ==\nAs of 3 May 2024\n\n\n== References ==",

According to Leslie Rees, \"Beginning with George’s lively speech in praise of alcohol...  he play goes on in lurid scenes to show George’s degradation and death and that of his unfortunate and blameless wife. It is an early example of the anti-alcohol drama that flourished later, particularly in the United States.\"\nThe Argus said \"Without any very great claims to depth of plot, or originality of incident, it is a very creditable production, and was listened to with marked attention, and frequent applause, by a very tolerable house.\"\nThe play was revived in 1855. One review said \"The drama is extremely well written, and full of highly worked up situations. It also conveys an admirable moral.\"\nBelfield also wrote The Rebel Chief a melodrama set during the reign of Charles II.\n\n\n== See also ==\nThe Rebel Chief\nZisca the Avenger\nThe Mysteries of Sydney\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRetribution at Ausstage",

        "content": "Hendrik Manfried Haus (Bergen op Zoom, 5 June 1803 – Utrecht, 13 May 1843) was a Dutch painter. Little is known about his life. According to his baptismal record from 1803, Hendrik was born with his twin sister Maria to Frans Joseph Haus and Barbara Fehr. They had two daughters in succession; the first died shortly after birth and the second when she was three years old. There is a letter from 1840 by him in the archive of the Rijksmuseum in which he reports that he and his wife have been under medical treatment for some time, and he offers a painting in the hope that the recipient will buy it.  \nThe Dutch art dealer and writer Pieter A. Scheen wrote about him: He received his education in The Hague, where he appears in the population registers in 1823 and 1830, and moved to Utrecht around 1835. He primarily worked in small formats using oil on panel, canvas, and copper with winter and summer landscapes in the style of Andreas Schelfhout. His works were exhibited in The Hague in 1837, Amsterdam in 1841, and Rotterdam in 1840 and 1848.\n\nHaus died in Utrecht at the age of 39. Although he is relatively unknown, more than twenty of his works have been offered at auctions since 1989. Most of these works were auctioned outside the Netherlands, particularly in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France, and the United States. The highest price bid for his work was for a piece measuring 32.5 × 43.5 cm titled 'Riders in a Village' at Dorotheum in Vienna, Austria (2005). The Utrecht Centraal Museum has several of his works in its collection.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n Media related to Hendrik Manfried Haus at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "The Aterenska reka (Bulgarian: Атеренска река) is a river in southern Bulgaria and northeastern Greece, a right tributary of the Arda of the Maritsa drainage. Its length is 35 km, of which 20 km in Bulgarian territory.\nThe river takes its source from a spring near the village of Cherni Rid in the Sarta Ridge of the eastern Rhodope Mountains at an altitude of 569 m. It flows eastwards in a narrow forested valley, which widens after the crossing of the road Ivaylovgrad–Mandritsa. East of the village of Drabishna the river leaves the territory of Bulgaria and enters Greece. Southeast of the village of Zoni it bends north and flows into the Arda at an altitude of 53 m about 800 m northeast of the village of Kyprinos. It drains the easternmost slopes of the Sarta Ridge.\nIts drainage basin covers a territory of 59 km2 in Bulgaria. The river has predominantly rain feed with high water in January and low water in September.\nThe Aterenska reka flows entirely in Haskovo Province of Bulgaria and Evros Regional Unit of Greece. There are five villages along its course — Cherni Rid, Kobilino and Drabishna in Ivaylovgrad Municipality, Bulgaria, as well as Zoni and Kypronos in Orestiada Municipality, Greece. Its waters are used for irrigation.\nThere are several landmarks along its course in Bulgaria, including the ruins of the medieval fortress of Lyutitsa about one kilometer south of the river, the late medieval Aterenski Bridge 1.6 km northwest of the fortress, and Villa Armira, the best preserved Roman villa in the country, situated 2 km downstream of the bridge, south of the town of Ivaylovgrad.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\nМичев (Michev), Николай (Nikolay); Михайлов (Mihaylov), Цветко (Tsvetko); Вапцаров (Vaptsarov), Иван (Ivan); Кираджиев (Kiradzhiev), Светлин (Svetlin) (1980).

        "content": "Umihara Kawase is a 1994 platformer developed and published by Japanese company TNN. It is the inaugural game in the Umihara Kawase series. It was first released in 1994 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nUmihara Kawase is a 2D side-scrolling platformer where the player controls the titular character, Kawase Umihara. The player navigates \"fields,\" the game's levels, and completes it by entering one of its available exits. The player makes use of Kawase's fishing line, using it as a grappling hook to overcome hazards.\nThe game contains a total of 49 fields of which four are exit fields and six are boss fields. The game makes use of colour palette of the SNES for digitized photographic backgrounds. The game permits saving speedruns, establishing such play as a principal feature of the series.\nThe game has a 30-minute time limit invisible to the player. When the timer runs out before reaching any end fields, the next exit always transports Kawase to the fixed single level (Field 28) regardless of the player's progress, after which the game ends.\n\n\n== Development ==\nUmihara Kawase started as one of the demos on the X68000, which the programmer Kiyoshi Sakai created to pitch it to the character designer Toshinobu Kondo. A series of showcase videos based on the prototype was later uploaded by Sakai on his YouTube channel in 2018.\nThe team behind the original SNES version was composed of half a dozen developers, but Sakai was in charge of most of the development by himself, who designed, directed and programmed the game. While Sakai had worked on plenty of high-profile video games – including Euphory (1987), Boomer's Adventure in ASMIK World (1989), the home port of Cameltry (1989), and Mamono Hunter Yōko: Dai 7 no Keishō (1991) – Umihara Kawase was his first top-to-bottom project.\nUmihara Kawase was inspired by arcade platformers like Donkey Kong (1981) and Roc'n Rope (1983), where the player can see the whole stage in one screen. Sakai denied rumors that the game's swinging mechanics were taken from Capcom's arcade game Bionic Commando (1987), which he was only vaguely familiar with at the time. However, he was still aware of it before creating Umihara Kawase and regarded it as a possible inspiration.\n\n\n== Release ==\nUmihara Kawase was first released on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in Japan on December 23, 1994.\nThe Microsoft Windows version was published by Agatsuma Entertainment on November 2, 2015. It was developed by Studio Saizensen, a studio founded by the series character designer Toshinobu Kondo. The slowdown from the Super Famicom version is no longer present with the addition of a practice mode. It's a worldwide release available through Steam and supports Steam Cloud saves, leaderboards and Steam Workshop access. On November 24, 2015, the day the Windows version of Umihara Kawase Shun made its worldwide debut, Agatsuma Entertainment bundled the first three games in the series on Steam into Umihara Kawase Trilogy, which can be bought at reduced price together. In January 2016, every game in the trilogy was delisted from Steam after Agatsuma Entertainment closed its doors in December 2015. The publishing rights to the series was promptly acquired by Degica, which relisted the trilogy to Steam on January 28, 2016.\nThe SNES version was made available in Japan for the Nintendo Switch Online service on May 26, 2022. In the other regions, it was replaced with Congo's Caper.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nOn release, Famitsu scored the game 7, 7, 7 and 7 with a total of 28 out of 40. Reviewers compared it to the Nintendo Entertainment System game Bionic Commando (1988) and praised its complex utility of fishing line in gameplay.\nThe SNES version of the game was not released in North America and Europe at the time, having remained obscure in the west since. A few journalists noted they never learned about the game and its series until it's featured in an episode of the gaming variety show GameCenter CX, which was aired on June 7, 2006.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nUmihara Kawase at MobyGames",

        "content": "Hadith al-Jnoud (Arabic: حديث الجنود, lit. 'Soldiers' Talk') is a novel by Ayman Otoom, published in 2014. It describes the student demonstrations that occurred at Yarmouk University in Irbid, Jordan during the mid-1980s, particularly amidst the month of Ramadan in May 1986. These protests resulted in numerous casualties, injuries, and arrests, leaving a lasting impact on the collective memory of those involved. The narrative reflects the poignant recollections of the protest leader and his comrades, many of whom are still alive today. They entrusted their firsthand accounts of pain and fear to Otoom, recognizing his capability to convey their story. The novel faced censorship by the Jordanian Publications Department upon the arrival of its second edition from a private publishing house in Beirut. Ayman Otoom, the author, faced legal proceedings due to the ban imposed on the novel.\nThe protagonist, Ward, embodies the enduring trauma of those events, burdened by his role in leading the protests and haunted by memories that refuse to fade. The novel vividly transports readers to the streets of Irbid, immersing them in the tumultuous atmosphere of the demonstrations. Through Ward's perspective, readers witness the profound sacrifices made by individuals like Naima, whose unwavering loyalty to her deceased husband mirrors the steadfastness of those who fought for their beliefs. Ward's uncle emerges as a sage figure whose wisdom nourishes the flames of freedom in his nephew's soul, even as disillusionment threatens to extinguish them. Ward's companions on the revolutionary path represent a diverse spectrum of ideologies, yet they are united by a shared quest for justice and dignity. Their courage and resilience stand in stark contrast to the apathy of contemporary students, underscoring the depth of their commitment to principles and ideals.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe narrative unfolds against the backdrop of Yarmouk University in Jordan during the turbulent mid-1980s. The protagonist, Ward, finds himself thrust into a leadership role amidst student protests erupting during the month of Ramadan in May 1986. As tensions escalate between the student body and university authorities, Ward becomes a central figure in the struggle for freedom, justice, and dignity. Ward and his companions navigate the complexities of activism in a repressive environment. Ward's sense of responsibility weighs heavily on him as he grapples with the moral implications of his actions, questioning whether his leadership stems from a genuine desire for change or the mere circumstances of fate.\nAmidst the chaos of the protests, Ward forms deep bonds with his fellow demonstrators, each representing a unique perspective and motivation for resistance. Naima, whose unwavering loyalty to her deceased husband mirrors the steadfastness of the protesters, emerges as a symbol of resilience in the face of adversity. Ward's uncle, a source of wisdom and guidance, imparts invaluable lessons on the true meaning of freedom and sacrifice. Through his mentorship, Ward comes to understand the gravity of his role as a leader and the sacrifices demanded by the pursuit of justice.\nIn the climax of events depicted, the Jordanian security forces launch a decisive crackdown on the student protests at Yarmouk University in 1986. This pivotal moment marks the culmination of escalating tensions between the students and the authorities, as the demonstrations for freedom and justice reach a critical juncture. The storming of Yarmouk University by security forces represents a turning point in the narrative, as the protesters find themselves confronted with the full force of state repression. The harrowing scene unfolds amidst a backdrop of chaos and violence, as students face off against heavily armed security personnel in a desperate bid to defend their rights and ideals.\nAs the protests intensify and the authorities crackdown on dissent, Ward and his comrades find themselves facing increasingly dire circumstances. The novel delves into the psychological toll of activism, exploring themes of trauma, resilience, and the enduring power of hope in the face of oppression.\nThe novel vividly captures the visceral intensity of the confrontation, depicting the clashes between protesters and security forces with raw emotional honesty. As the situation spirals out of control, the characters are forced to confront the brutal realities of state oppression and the harsh consequences of their defiance. The storming of Yarmouk University serves as a stark reminder of the sacrifices made by those who dare to challenge injustice, as the students' struggle for freedom and dignity exacts a heavy toll on both their bodies and souls. Despite the overwhelming odds stacked against them, the protesters refuse to back down, their resolve strengthened by a shared commitment to their cause.\n\n\n== Ban in Jordan ==\nThe Jordanian authorities have prohibited the distribution and circulation of the second edition of Ayman Otoum's novel, 'The Soldiers’ Talk,' pending a judicial ruling from a specialized court handling publication cases. Amjad Al-Qadi, the Head of the Media Authority, clarified that while the Authority's Publications Department did not outright ban the novel, they did request the publisher to withhold distribution of the second edition until the judiciary addressed the alleged violations it contained. Al-Qadi explained that the department had not been provided with copies of the first edition, printed in Jordan in accordance with legal standards. Upon the arrival of the second edition from Beirut, distribution was halted pending the court's decision on identified infractions.\nThe judge referred to these infractions, whether concerning the depiction of events at Yarmouk University or perceived insults to security services, emphasizing that the matter now rests with the judiciary, subjecting all involved parties to its verdict. Ayman Al-Atoum, the novel's author, characterized the situation as a ban on a literary work, despite the first edition having sold out, effectively rendering the novel prohibited in Jordan. However, Al-Atoum suggested that circulation remains permissible in other Arab countries, as per his assessment.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "St Petersburg Dialogues: or Conversations on the Temporal Government of Providence (French: Les Soirées de Saint-Pétersbourg, ou Entretiens sur le Gouvernement Temporel de la Providence) is an 1821 book by the Savoyard diplomat and philosopher Joseph de Maistre.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nIn a series of dialogues, three characters, called the Count, the Senator and the Chevalier, meet in Saint Petersburg and explore a range of subjects related to theodicy, punishment and epistemology. The book argues that the continuous blood sacrifice of men is a constant and fundamental law in all of human life and society.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nSt Petersburg Dialogues is Maistre's most famous and influential work. The scholar Mark Wegierski writes that it is \"extraordinary\" in its wide range, which includes \"pointed criticisms of Locke and Voltaire, the beginnings of a logothetic linguistic theory, as well as such controversial passages as those in praise of the executioner, and on the divinity of war\".\nAccording to the Maistre scholar Carolina Armenteros, the essayistic style of the dialogues expresses an \"organicism … opposed to the mechanistic rationalism of the Enlightenment,\" offering \"a pre-romantic and imaginative ideal of the search for truth that springs from respect for variation and particularity … an ideal rooted in awe.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n French Wikisource has original text related to this article: Les Soirées de Saint-Pétersbourg",

        "content": "Autism in Brazil has had a number of manifestations since the 20th century. It was introduced through child psychiatry with the predominant influence of psychoanalysis in medical care in the mid-1950s. The development of a community based on autism was late, with the founding of the Associação de Amigos do Autista (AMA) in 1983. Since then, autism has become a topic of interest for family members, health professionals and autistic people with the predominance of a neurobiological view of the diagnosis.\nBefore there were initiatives aimed at diagnosis, autism appeared in newspaper headlines translated by news agencies. In the 1970s, some of the first congresses and institutions focussed on autism emerged. In the 1980s, the disorder began to gain greater public visibility with the emergence of associations founded by mothers and fathers, such as AMA and, later, the Associação Brasileira de Autismo (Abra). In the 1990s and 2000s, the popularisation of autism developed in different states of the country, while the first legislation was developed. At the end of the 2000s, discussions began about creating a national law on autism. In the 2010s, the National Policy for the Protection of the Rights of People with Autism Spectrum Disorders was sanctioned, while autistic people began to participate with greater emphasis in institutional activism, as well as the creation of media about autism.\nThe autism scene in Brazil is also characterised by tensions and conflicts between activists and organisations on issues such as health interventions, special education and autism representation. Until the 2020s, there was no prevalence of autism in the Brazilian population. For this reason, estimates based on figures from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were common in manifestos and journalistic texts.\n\n\n== Descriptions and statistics ==\nLooking at the historical panorama, researchers Francisco Ortega, Rafaela Zorzanelli and Clarice Rios say that autism in Brazil represents a scenario of \"wars\" that are inserted in the definition of what autism is, in mental health policies and in media narratives. The authors also point out that, historically, psychoanalysis has lost ground, while behavioural approaches have become the main ones in the field. In 2022, the Ministry of Health described autism as \"a disorder characterised by the alteration of the individual's neurodevelopmental functions, interfering with the capacity for communication, language, social interaction and behaviour\", with an emphasis on early diagnosis and \"development of stimuli\".\nNumbers from Abra in 1997 estimated 600,000 people with \"classic autism\" in Brazil. In February 2011, the first autism epidemiology study in Latin America was published, with data from 2010, led by child psychiatrist Marcos Tomanik Mercadante. The study were based on a pilot project with a sample of 20,000 people in a neighbourhood in the São Paulo city of Atibaia, and measured the prevalence of one case of autism for every 368 children aged between 7 and 12. In the following years, different estimates of autism in Brazil were presented based on figures from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In 2014, it was estimated that there were 2 million autistic Brazilians, while by 2023 the number had risen to almost 6 million.\nIn 2019, in order to cover the gap in the number of autistic people in Brazil, Law 13.861/19 was sanctioned, which aimed to provide official data on the country. For this reason, the 2022 Brazilian census was the first to contain information on autism.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1950–1980: Background ===\nAccording to historian Bruna Alves Lopes, there were few records of autism in Brazil until the 1980s. In the 1940s, when the work of psychiatrist Leo Kanner introduced autism as an independent diagnosis, Brazil already had a significant influence of psychoanalysis in child care. The psychoanalytic field began to penetrate the country in the 1920s and achieved hegemony within psychiatry itself by the mid-1950s. At the same time, the idea that the cause of autism was a lack of bonding between the parents (especially mothers) and the child emerged with Kanner in 1948, but it was psychoanalyst Bruno Bettelheim who developed it throughout the 1950s and 1960s.\nIn Brazil, the first journalistic publications related autism were made up of stories translated by news agencies from countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom and characterised the diagnosis as a disease. Some of them were influenced by a psychoanalytic bias, considering autistic children as belonging to cold and distant parents, while others addressed it as one of the symptoms of schizophrenia. Bettelheim's thinking had a significant influence on the journalistic content of these periods, with rare exceptions that cited Kanner's work and even behaviourist approaches. Most of them don't mention relevant and positive roles in relation to the families of autistic people.\nAt the same time, the professionals of autism was aligned with child psychiatry and child disability. In 1956, the Associação Paulista de Psiquiatria Infantil e Higiene Mental was created, and in 1965 the Associação Brasileira de Deficiência Mental. In the city of Porto Alegre, the Comunidade Terapêutica Leo Kanner was set up in 1963. For a large part of the population, autistic care took place in non-specialised institutions, such as the Pestalozzi Society, founded in 1932, and the Associação de Pais e Amigos dos Excepcionais (APAE), with units all over the country, and organised in 1962.\nIn the 1970s, discussions about autism in Brazil have grown, culminating years later in the formation of a community. In June 1970, the Centro de Estudos da Casa de Saúde Dr. Eiras, in Rio de Janeiro, held a debate on the diagnosis based on a film. Similar events began to take place over the years in institutions across the country, such as round tables based on films about autism, lectures, congresses and courses promoted by national and international professionals in psychiatry and other fields of knowledge, as well as the publication of the first national research on autism. Journalistic publications from this period began to mention the family's contribution to autism treatment more frequently. In 1978, Casa Azul was founded in Rio de Janeiro, probably the first organisation to offer exclusive therapeutic care for autistic children in Brazil. In the same year and in the same city, the Casarão Special Education Centre was also founded by a mother of an autistic child.\n\n\n=== 1980–1993: First family associations and movements ===\n\nAutism as a movement began to consolidate in Brazil in the 1980s. It was during this period that family members, especially mothers, dissatisfied with the psychoanalytic blame they received for their children's disorder, began to advocacy to gain access to health services. Especially in large capitals such as São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Brasília, family members began to write letters to major newspapers such as Jornal do Brasil and draw the attention of public authorities to the cause of autism.\nIn April 1980, Rede Globo transmitted in TV the film Son-Rise: A Miracle of Love, which was a ratings success and prompted to rerun it several times throughout the decade. Some family members went so far as to claim that the film was a milestone for autism awareness in the decade. The film, however, highlights a therapeutic programme Son-Rise, which over the years has been shown to be ineffective in the treatment of autism.\nThe first legalised autism association in Brazil was the Associação de Amigos do Autista (AMA), founded in 1983 by Marisa Fúria and Ana Maria Ros de Melo and formed by clients of doctor Raymond Rosenberg, who shared the anguish of not having more in-depth information about their children's diagnosis and treatment. The first meetings took place in Rosenberg's office and, shortly afterwards, the organisation had a school operating in the backyard of a Baptist church. There are also reports from family activists about autism associations without legal registration already existed in cities such as Belo Horizonte and Rio de Janeiro.\nFrom the second decade of the 1980s onwards, the pioneering autism organisations had the common characteristic of striving for internationalisation and also for spreading the word about autism on national territory. The AMA got the support of actor Antônio Fagundes, who recorded a national TV commercial about the diagnosis for free in 1987. During this period, family activists travelled to foreign countries to learn about new forms of treatment and search for resources. The parents had several reference researchers. One of them was Bernard Rimland. In addition, the work of Ole Ivar Lovaas with Applied Behaviour Analysis also began to be disseminated. Originally, the autism movement was concentrated around mothers and fathers of autistic people, a trend that continued over the decades. Other phefirstna also began to contribute to the development of the autism scene in Brazil during the creation of the New Republic, such as the creation of the Sistema Único de Saúde (SUS) with the Brazilian Constitution of 1988 and psychiatric reform.\nIn 1988, the Associação Brasileira de Autismo (Abra) was founded in Belo Horizonte, with small organisations from other Brazilian states initially joining with the aim of consolidating a movement with national representation. Under this same unifying character, the Associação Terapêutica Educacional para Crianças Autistas (Asteca) promoted the First National Autism Congress in 1989 together with other organisations (with an audience of around 1,300 people). That year, there were already 23 autism associations in the country. In 1991, the second edition of the congress was attended by more than 2000 people, national speakers and international figures such as the psychiatrist and psychoanalyst René Diatkine and Eric Schopler, creator of the Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) programme. During the event, Schopler, based on the research of the time, criticised the use of psychoanalysis to treat autism. The AMA implemented TEACCH over the following years, under the supervision of foreign professionals.\nIn addition to autism associations, family members began producing various materials to raise awareness of autism. In Rio, the Association of Parents of Autistic People in Rio de Janeiro (Aparj) launched Autismo em Revista in 1989, the first publication of its kind in Brazil. In addition, there was frequent dissemination of translated foreign articles and books, as well as talks to help families. During this period, the paediatrician Christian Gauderer launched the book Autismo, década de 80, a frequent reference for researchers and parents at the time. The AMA, in turn, began to have centres in various Brazilian states in all regions.\n\n\n=== 1994–2008: National expansion and recognition ===\n\nIn the global history of autism, the 1990s were characterised by changes in the classification of autism diagnoses, and the central role of the internet in activism and, in Brazil, the period was marked by the development of educational policies. During Itamar Franco's presidency, special education was restructured, which coincided with the Salamanca Declaration. The pioneering organisations continued their activities, sometimes with financial problems and sometimes with new members joining. In this context, the AMA won that year's Unesco Human Rights Prize in 1998, handed over by president Fernando Henrique Cardoso.\nOn 13 December 1998, a discussion list about autism was launched on Yahoo!. It was the most influential space for virtual interaction in Brazil about autism, where parents shared stories and doubts about the diagnosis. One of the characteristics of these virtual interactions, according to historian Bruna Alves Lopes, was solidarity between mothers, interaction with people from all over the country and a new characterisation of autism activism, despite the precariousness of the internet connection at the time, marked by dial-up connections. The group remained active and productive for years, even distributing information materials about autism. In 2006, members of the group even launched a translated version of an ABA training manual and some of its members founded various associations throughout Brazil, including the Associação de Familiares e Amigos da Gente Autista (Afaga).\nOn 18 June 2005, Autism Pride Day, family activists of autistic people in the Federal District held an information blitz about autism on the BR-040/050 highway. This group would later become the organisation Movimento Orgulho Autista Brasil (MOAB). Through MOAB, it was the first time that the topic of neurodiversity entered the discussions on autism in Brazil. In 2008, in Fortaleza, the Associação Brasileira para a Ação por Direitos das Pessoas com Autismo (Abraça) was founded by those in charge of the Casa da Esperança therapeutic institution with the collaboration of activists from other organisations, such as MOAB and Afaga. 36][37]\n\n\n=== 2009–present: Legislation and autistic activism ===\n\nAt the end of 2009, a group of relatives of autistic people, belonging to organisations such as Moab, began to liaise with federal deputies and senators in Brasilia. According to Berenice Piana, the activist Ulisses Batista was in communication with Cristovam Buarque, asking for a public hearing on autism. She, in turn, met Paulo Paim, who was responsible for directing the Human Rights Commission to hold a hearing. The event took place on 24 November 2009, and has developed over the years into a public policy. The text of the law began to be written with the participation of various activists. According to Piana, the text was ready by March 2010, and thus filed. It was approved by the committee in 2011 and went to the plenary in June of that year.\nOn 27 December 2012, during Dilma Rousseff's government, the National Policy for the Protection of the Rights of People with Autism Spectrum Disorders was instituted, whereby autistic people were classified as people with disabilities. The policy also became known as the Berenice Piana Law, at the suggestion of then-senator Paulo Paim. The legislation had a significant impact on autism in Brazil and on the greater discussion of the disorder in the country. However, the legislation also caused controversy due to the president's vetoes of sections relating to special education and the granting of special hours to civil servants with autistic children. In addition, the treatment of autistic people in Psychosocial Care Centres, an agenda defended by some associations and movements, was the target of disagreements from other activists. The issue even became part of public hearings in the following years in the Chamber of Deputies.\nDuring the 2010s, the participation of people diagnosed with autism in activism grew, with the emergence of blogs, video channels and books written by autistic people and organizations formed by autistics. Topics such as autism in women, sexuality and inclusion in the labour became more frequent. In 2016, Abraça promoted the 1st Brazilian Meeting of Autistic People, an unprecedented event in Fortaleza organised and dedicated solely to autistic people and, at the same time, the association became the first autism organisation in the country with an autistic president, Fernanda Santana. Solo activism by family members of autistic people has also grown, with the rise of names such as journalist Andréa Werner and television presenter Marcos Mion.\nIn the 2020s, autism legislation in Brazil began to expand beyond the federal level, with states such as Rio Grande do Sul and Pará promoting state policies aimed at autism. Different states in the country independently also began to pass legislation extending the validity period of autism reports, with activists justifying that the process of updating reports was exhausting and pointless, given that autism is a disorder without a cure. In 2021, the autism report debate gained national visibility with a bill aimed at all permanent disabilities. In 2023, the federal government sanctioned the Hidden Disabilities Sunflower of identification for people with hidden disabilities.\nIn 2021, autistic university students began to create autistic collectives at public universities across Brazil. The movement's first exponents were collectives at the University of São Paulo (USP) and the State University of Campinas (Unicamp). The following year, people involved with the autistic collectives got together with other activists and founded the Associação Nacional para Inclusão das Pessoas Autistas (Ania/BR).\n\n\n== References in popular culture ==\n\n\n=== Autistic people ===\n\nOver the years, public figures from outside autism activism share that they were on the autistic spectrum, such as digital colourist Marina Amaral, journalist and podcaster Amanda Ramalho, actress Letícia Sabatella, geographer Elias Jabbour, comic book artist Ana Mei, Brazilian funk singer MC Beth, actor Thiago Picchi, neuroscientist Suzana Herculano-Houzel, palaeontologist Tito Aureliano, comedian and presenter Danilo Gentili, and journalist Renata Simões.\nOn the discovery of autism, Simões went so far as to say that \"Self-knowledge is the great tool for freedom. Because the moment you understand what is yours and what you operate on, [you say] 'no, this isn't mine, it's something you want to throw at me' (...) What is mine, my personality, what is my diagnosis and what is other people's? The moment you discover that, it becomes much easier to exist.\"\nOther figures also claim to be autistic, such as YouTuber and anarcho-capitalist activist Paulo Kogos, who is commonly identified as being active in far-right groups. Despite this, Kogos did not declare himself autistic when he ran for state representative in the 2022 Brazilian elections.\n\n\n=== Press ===\nHistorically, the autism agenda has been publicised through the press, whether in readers' letters or television reports. In terms of the print media, the diagnosis has become a topic of growing interest over the decades, with an increasing neurobiological emphasis in traditional media. In a study based on journalistic articles published between 2000 and 2012, the authors noted two main emphases: \"denouncing the lack of specialised services and disseminating foreign studies and methodologies\". The researchers also stated that these two pillars underpin much of the activism of autistic family members.\nIn the autism community, members of the Associação de Pais de Autistas do Rio de Janeiro (Aparj) launched Autismo em Revista in 1989, which circulated on a limited basis over the years. In April 2010, Revista Autismo was created. Free of charge and in print and digital formats, the magazine did not have a set periodicity, but in early 2019 it switched to a quarterly periodicity, with national distribution in all Brazilian states, being published in March, June, September and December. From 2020 onwards, it ran an annual national campaign with a defined theme for World Autism Awareness Day, with the first theme being \"#Respectro - Respect for the whole spectrum.\" The same year saw the creation of the Autism Channel, which houses the magazine and the company's other digital initiatives, such as the Autism-focused Social Entrepreneurship (ESA) programme.\nFrom the 2020s onwards, autism also became the subject of columns in national newspapers. One of these was Dentro do Espectro, by Renata Simões, in O Estado de S. Paulo. Journalist Johanna Nublat published the column Vidas Atípicas, in Folha de S.Paulo.\n\n\n=== Politics ===\n\nIn addition to the political relations that have taken place over the decades around the autism agenda, activists from the autism scene have begun to insert themselves into political candidacies at municipal, state and federal levels in Brazil. According to data from Agência Pública, 19 candidates for councillor in Brazil's 2020 municipal elections declared themselves autistic. On that occasion, an autistic candidate and father from Guarulhos, who was not self-declared as a person with a disability, was elected. In 2022, after two failed attempts in other elections, journalist Andréa Werner managed to be elected state deputy for the state of São Paulo. Months after her election, Werner publicly shared that she has autistic. The following year, federal deputy Amom Mandel revealed that he had known he was on the autism spectrum since the age of 14 and said that his decision to go public with his diagnosis came about because he had been attacked.\nWith the popularity of the autism issue in Brazil, activists have begun to argue that politicians are opportunistic when it comes to the cause of autism in order to attract votes from people linked to the cause in election processes and that has occurred excessive presentation of bills. An investigation by the newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo in 2023 identified more than 200 bills and Constitutional Amendment Proposals related to autism.\nAccording to the Brazilian Election Justice, autistic people have preference in the electoral shifts, and it is necessary to declare the diagnosis to the president of the polling station.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nAs in most countries, sports are also part of the routine and daily life of autistic people, whether in the context of education or the cultural elements associated with sporting activities. In the educational scenario, physical education has been pointed out as a way of paying attention to aspects such as psychomotricity, cognitive and bodily development, as well as the motor coordination of autistic people, who are generally considered to be clumsy. On the other hand, as a generally social activity, taking part in these activities can be considered a challenge for some Brazilian autistic people.\nIn the 2020s, in the context of football, autistic people began to develop autism-focused fans. The first case was the Autistas Alvinegros, from Sport Club Corinthians Paulista, who founded an adult autistic supporters' club in 2022. The initiative has gained ground in several Brazilian clubs, both in the creation of such supporters' clubs and in the adaptation of stadiums with accessibility and sensory booths, as well as the use of autism symbols on the uniforms of first-team players.\nIn 2022, the Federal Government launched the TEAtivo programme, with a focus on physical activities for autistic children and adolescents. Autism is still the subject of events, courses and actions promoted by national institutions focused on disability, such as the Brazilian Paralympic Committee.\n\n\n=== Videos and podcasts ===\nThe first channel about autism produced by an autistic person in Brazil was by Nelson Marra, active between 2015 and 2016. Since 2015, channels have emerged starring figures such as Sophia Mendonça, Selma Sueli Silva, Marcos Petry, Leo Akira, Willian Chimura and Thais Cardoso. Among professionals, the likes of Mayra Gaiato, Clay Brites, Lucelmo Lacerda and Thiago Lopes have stood out.\nThe first podcast about autism in Brazil was Rádio Autismo, launched in 2007 and produced by Casa da Esperança. In 2014, the organisation also created the Autismo Brasil Podcast, which was active until 2017. In 2018, the first podcast made solely by autistic people was launched, Introvertendo. Over the years, other productions of the genre have also emerged, such as Lógica Autista and Atípicas. In 2023, the Esquizofrenoias podcast released Amanda no Espectro, an exclusive season about autism.\n\n\n=== Films and series ===\nAutism in Brazil has been represented in multiple films, series, soap operas, documentaries and other audiovisual productions, whether they focus on the diagnosis or feature autistic characters. One of the highlights was the character Benê, from Malhação: Viva a Diferença, also represented in the series As Five. In 2013, the soap opera Amor à Vida featured the character Linda. The production's approach to the construction of the character was criticised. In 2019, the adaptation Éramos Seis featured the autistic character Justina.\nWith regard to films and documentaries, works such as Em um mundo interior (2018), which dealt with the experiences of multiple autistic people, and Meu Amigo Lorenzo (2024), about the friendship between a filmmaker and an autistic teenager.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nEpidemiology of autism",

        "content": "Mark Isaac-Williams (born 16 November 1939, Hong Kong) is an award-winning botanical artist, horticulturalist, and orchid expert; he has published several books on the subject.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nWilliams was born in Hong Kong to British parents, father Leonard, a sea captain, and mother Margery Isaac. In June 1940 the British Government required all women and children to leave Hong Kong as the Japanese forces had surrounded Hong Kong.  Williams and his mother sailed to Australia and lived in Watsons Bay, Sydney.  His father remained in Hong Kong and was interned at the Stanley Internment Camp.\nAfter WWII, Williams and his mother spent time in Shropshire, England, before returning to Hong Kong, where he and his parents lived at The Peninsula. The hotel had been occupied by the Japanese army during the war and at that point was in a very poor state, Williams describing it as \"full of mosquitos and rats.\"\nHe attended Kowloon Junior School and King George V secondary school. In 1951 the family moved into a new home on Kimberley Street. He then attended Moor Park School in Shropshire, England as a boarder from the age of 11, where he kept a \"nature notebook\". He moved to St Margaret's College in Devon to finish his O-Levels and then on to Shrewsbury College.\n\n\n== Work ==\nAfter school, Williams initially worked for an advertising company in London but moved back to Hong Kong in 1959. He worked as a clerk for the British government communications office, stationed at Victoria Barracks, for seven years.\nIn 1962 he started teaching swimming at Diocesan Girls' School. The job evolved to become a full-time PE teaching position, which he held for 12 years. Around this time, he joined an \"amateur orchid group\" led by Gloria Barretto, an orchid expert at Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden (KFBG).\nIn 1979 Williams joined KFBG as a horticulturist, working alongside Barretto. On behalf of KFBG he travelled widely, including Australia, Taiwan, Thailand, Malaysia, Nepal and Papua New Guinea, collecting orchid specimens and studying plants in their native environment. In 1984 he left KFBG and ran two florist businesses. In 1985 he moved to Australia to run a plant nursery in Queensland. He lived in the UK from 2000 to 2006, returning to Hong Kong afterwards.\nIn Hong Kong, Williams was re-hired by KFBG to revive the Orchid Haven which had grown from six species in 1977 to over 150 in 2006. In 2011 the Gloria Barretto Orchid Sanctuary was opened, where Williams worked as a consultant. In 2013 he gave up this role and became KFBG's first ever resident artist. By the time he retired in 2020 he had painted pictures 130 varieties of orchids.\n\n\n== Artwork ==\nAs an artist, Williams is entirely self-taught. His favourite medium is watercolour. In 2013 he earned a diploma from the Society of Botanical Artists (SBA). His prints are sold through the Lion Rock Press.\n\n\n=== Exhibitions ===\nWilliams' paintings have appeared in the following exhibitions:\n\nSt John's Cathedral, Hong Kong, 2007\nUnited Services Recreation Club, 2009\nOut of the Woods: Celebrating Trees in Public Gardens American Society of Botanical Artists. Touring exhibition from 2017 to 2018. Venues included Huntington Library, Tucson Botanical Gardens and Minnesota Landscape Arboretum\nGreen Fingers, Artist's Hands 2021, Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden\n\n\n=== Awards ===\n2011 – American Society of Botanical Artists Nepenthes macfarlanei – Award of Merit\n2015 – 17th Annual Botanical Art Exhibition Pitcher Plant collection – Bourn Award for Distinction with an Emphasis on Horticultural Presentation - for Nepenthes macfarlanei\nWilliams also won the following awards at the Royal Horticultural Society Botanical Art and Photography Exhibition:\n\n2016 – The Invasive Chinese Banyan Tree (Ficus macrocarpa) - silver-gilt medal\n2017 – A variety of Asian bamboos - silver-gilt medal\n2018 – The flower, the pollinator, and the fruit - bronze medal\n2021 – Orchid species of Asia - silver medal\n\n\n== Publications ==\nWilliams has published the following books: \n\nHistory of the Hong Kong Post Office (commissioned by the HKPO)\nIntroduction to the Orchids of Asia (1988) Pub.

        "content": "The Cherna (Bulgarian: Черна) is a 48 km long river in southern Bulgaria, a left tributary of the Arda of the Maritsa drainage.\nThe source of the river is the westernmost point of the whole Arda basin and springs in the Pereliksko–Prespanski Ridge of the western Rhodope Mountains at an altitude of 1,770 m, some 5 km southeast west of the village of Mugla. Throughout its course it flows eastwards in a narrow canyon-like valley, with a single wide section at the town of Smolyan. It flows into the Arda at an altitude of 128 m about 800 m south of the village of Leshtak. It drains the southeastern slopes of the highest section of the Pereliksko–Prespanski Ridge and the northern slopes of the Kaynadinski Ridge.\nIts drainage basin covers a territory of 259 km2, or 4.47% of the Arda's total. The river has predominantly rain–snow feed with high water in April–May and low water in December–January and August–September. The average annual flow at the village of Taran is 4.86 m3/s.\nThe Cherna flows entirely in Smolyan Province. There are seven settlements along its course, one town and six villages — the town of Smolyan and the villages of Vlahovo, Laka, Podvis, Rovina and Taran in Smolyan Municipality, and the village of Ravnishta in Madan Municipality. The river provides potable water for Smolyan.\nThere are two main roads along its valley, a 16.8 km section of the second class II-86 road Plovdiv–Smolyan–Rudozem and a 9 km stretch of the third class III-866 road Smolyan–Devin–Stamboliyski. \n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\nМичев (Michev), Николай (Nikolay); Михайлов (Mihaylov), Цветко (Tsvetko); Вапцаров (Vaptsarov), Иван (Ivan); Кираджиев (Kiradzhiev), Светлин (Svetlin) (1980).

        "content": "The Farmers from the Baltic to the Tatras (Polish: Rolnicy od Bałtyku do Tatr, RBT) is a Polish electoral committee registered for the 2024 European Parliament election in Poland. It was founded on 18 April 2024 and was then registered on 24 April. Before being registered, it was called to correct irregularities that the National Electoral Commission found during the registration of the committee. Its founders are farmers from a small village of Wojciechowice in Opatów County, in Eastern Poland. It is considered one of the agrarian electoral committees founded by farmers in wake of the 2024 Polish farmers' protests, which sparked Polish farmers' protests against the policies of the European Union. The demands of the protesting farmers include abolishing or reforming the European Green Deal, along with preventing the entrace of Ukrainian grain and sugar into Polish markets.\nIn its program, the electoral committee puts heavy emphasis on the development of hydroelectricity in Poland, believing that if developed, it could cover most of the Polish elecricity demand. It also proposes reforms that would make the European Union more supportive of agriculture and farmers. It postulates the implemention of waterway projects in Poland that would then be integrated into larger European waterway systems. The proposals of the Farmers from the Baltic to the Tatras also include training for African farmers and an intership program that would enable them to undergo training on European farms, along with modernization of Polish healthcare system that would improve healthcare access in the Polish countryside. The committee believes that the post-1989 capitalist reforms in Poland failed the Polish countryside, resulting in rural poverty and lack of healthcare.\n\n\n== Background ==\nSince February 2024, Polish farmers have been organizing nationwide protests, with general demands being to abolish or reform the European Union regulations introduced by the European Green Deal, along with the implementiation of protectionist measures that would cease the import of Ukrainian grain and sugar into Polish markets. Protesting farmers argue that the prices of the agricultural products have become so low that farming is no longer a sustainable profession in Poland. Research from March 2024 found hat only 30% of Polish farmers earned a monthly income above the minimum wage. The poverty amongst Polish farmers has been steadily growing ever since the late 2000s, which was escalated by the 2011 law that force the purchase of leased land and indebtness of many farmers.\nThe situation in the Polish countryside was furned worsened and declined rapidly in 2018, as the 2018 drought affected more than 2.2 million hectares and caused losses of around 900 million PLN to Polish farms. Crop failure combined with the African swine fever virus render farming completely unprofitable in Poland, causing radical and anti-government sentiment in the countryside. In wake of this, many radical agrarian parties emerged in Poland, such as AGROunia and the Peasants' Party. These parties were inspired by the 1990s far-left Samoobrona movement, a radical rural trade union and a party that became known for its radical tactics, such as clashes with the police. Its willigness to assault police officers and debt collectors became an important factor in the radicalization of the Polish countryside.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Farmers from the Baltic to the Tatras was founded on 18 April 2024 in a small village of Wojciechowice located in Eastern Poland. As of 2024, the village was home to around 300 people. The village was place of the 2024 Polish farmers' protests, and additionally there was a political protest in Wojciechowice in April 2024, as the mayor of the village was re-elected by a single vote in the 2024 Polish local elections. Because the margin of mayor's victory was one vote, the result of the election is to be decided by the court.\nOn 22 April 2024, the National Electoral Commission found irregularities in the registration process of the Farmers from the Baltic to the Tatras, and requested a correction. The electoral committee was formally registered for the election two days later, on 24 April 2024. The electoral representative of the committee is Andrzej Bęben, while the treasurer is Paweł Stąporek. The leader of the party is Henryk Połcik, with the elecotoral representative of the RBT, Andrzej Bęben, being one of the vice-chairmen.\nThe Farmers from the Baltic to the Tatras is considered to be a part of the larger electoral action by Polish farmers sparked by the ongoing 2024 Polish farmers' protests, where Polish farmers protest against the policies of the European Union as well as the sharp decline of grain prices in Poland attributted to the presence of Ukrainian grain in Polish markets. However, the electoral committee of the Farmers from the Baltic to the Tatras is considered unlikely to gain any seats to the European Parliament, given the 5% electoral threshold as well as presence of numerous other agrarian electoral committees in the Polish election.\n\n\n== Program ==\nThe electoral program of the Farmers from the Baltic to the Tatras mainly postulates a greater role of rivers in the economies of European Union states, a training program for African farmers, as well as reforms to the agricultural law of the European Union. The electoral committee promotes hydroelectricity and argues that electricity generates from the hydroelectric power plants in the river basins of Vistula and Oder can cover a significant proportion of the Poland's electricity needs. The slogan of the electoral committee is Decalogue the guide of the farmers (Polish: Dekalog drogowskazem rolników).\nIt proposes the implementation of the Baltic Sea-Black Sea waterway project Vistula-San-Dniester-Prut-Danube plan drafted by Polish professor Maksymilian Matakiewicz in 1927, which would be integrated into the waterway system of the European Union. The RBT believes that Vistula \"may in the near future become a blessing for our people who have been oppressed for so long\". The electoral committee makes references to the Polish interwar philosopher Roman Ingarden, claiming to be following his ideal of cherishing and developing the Polish special relationships with its rivers and sea access.\nThe Farmers from the Baltic to the Tatras also proposes a training program for the farmers of Africa, which would be based on a similar training project for the farmers of Africa, Asia and Latin America organised by the United Nations during the Cold War. The training is to be organized by Poland and other states of the European Union and include training adivosors to assist the farmers; the final stage of the training program would include granting the trainees several-month internships in Polish farms. The trained African farmers would then become \"ambassadors for Polish agricultural products\".\nThe committee also puts a heavy emphasis on development of healthcare and the improvement of healthcare access in Polish countryside. The Farmers from the Baltic to the Tatras proposes online and home-based rehabilitation programs, especially in places where clinics are not available. It also envisions the creation of \"medical kiosks\" in Polish villages, which would have appropriate diagnostic equipment to enable direct consultation with doctors via video conferencing. The leader of the committee, Henry Połcik, is heavy critical of the consequences of the post-1989 transformation of Poland into a capitalist free-market state, noting the widespread rural poverty and lack of appropriate healthcare in rural areas.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAGROunia\nSelf-Defence of the Republic of Poland\nPolish People's Party\nPeasants' Party (Poland)\n2024 Polish farmers' protests\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Orly is a chanson (song) in French by the Belgian songwriter Jacques Brel. It was recorded on September 5, 1977 and released on Brel's last long-playing record on Disques Barclay on November 17 of the same year. The album by the songwriter, who had returned from the South Seas after a long artistic break, became a public event in France. Orly is considered one of the outstanding songs on Brel's last release.\nThe song is about a pair of lovers who say goodbye to each other at Paris-Orly airport. Unusual for Brel's work is the narrator's role as an observer and the not primarily male point of view, which is directed towards the abandoned woman at the end. Orly can be interpreted not only as a sad love song, but also, with its allusions to illness and death, as the terminally ill songwriter's farewell to life. In the refrain, Brel concludes that life doesn't hand out gifts. By naming his colleague Gilbert Bécaud, he refers to his much more optimistic song Dimanche à Orly about longing for distant places at the airport.\n\n\n== Lyrics and Music ==\n\nSundays in Orly: over two thousand people stream through the airport, but the narrator only has eyes for two, a pair of lovers standing in the rain, hugging each other so tightly that their bodies merge. They affirm their love in tears, but make no promises to each other that they cannot keep. Finally, their bodies slowly separate, holding each other again, until the man abruptly turns away and is swallowed up by a staircase. The woman is left behind, open-mouthed, suddenly aged, as if she had met her death. She has often lost men in the past, but this time it is love that she has lost. She feels fragile, as if she were for sale. The narrator tries to follow her, but then she is also swallowed up by the crowd.\n\nThe chorus goes:«La vie ne fait pas de cadeau\n Et nom de Dieu c’est triste\n Orly le dimanche\n Avec ou sans Bécaud»\n\n– Jacques Brel: OrlyWhich can be translated as: \"Life doesn't give presents. And in God's name (also stronger: damn it), it's sad on Sundays in Orly, with or without Bécaud.\"\nThe verses take some liberties with the rhymes, but strictly adhere to the verse meter of half alexandrines. The melody is decidedly monotonous. It begins with the alternation of two simple chords on a gently strummed guitar, which, according to Hubert Thébault, creates the effect of a heartbeat: the tonic and dominant seventh chords in C minor to the first and third quarter notes of a three-quarter bar. While Brel accompanies himself alone throughout the first verse, the orchestra conducted by his long-time arranger François Rauber only enters explosively after the first refrain. The four accentuated entries have the effect of \"an acoustic exclamation mark.\" From the second verse onwards, the strings set the rhythm, while the wind instruments support Brel's characteristic crescendo in the third verse. Ulf Kubanke speaks of a \"blown, echoing brass echo\", Hubert Thébault recalls the fanfares of the trumpets as reminiscent of a bullfight. As was typical of the collaboration between Brel and Rauber, Brel had precise ideas about the musical style and instrumentation from the beginning, including the trumpet part, but then let Rauber work out the details.\n\n\n== Background and origins ==\n\nIn May 1967, at the age of just 38, Brel gave his farewell performance as a songwriter on stage. The following year, one last LP was released, after which Brel only appeared in a musical and various films. In November 1974, the singer, who was suffering from lung cancer, had to undergo an operation to remove part of his lung. In December of the same year, he and his lover Maddly Bamy set off on an Atlantic crossing by sailing ship. A few weeks earlier, he had said goodbye to another lover named Monique, whom he never saw again. Eddy Przybylski assumes that this separation at an airport (not in Orly, but with Paris airport as the destination) is the biographical background to the song Orly. Brel's journey took him to the Marquesas Islands over several stops, where he settled permanently on Hiva Oa in June 1976. On the island where Paul Gauguin had already spent his last years, Brel once again found the inspiration for seventeen new songs about \"a few things that have been on my mind for fifteen years\".\nIn August 1977, Brel surprised his old companions by returning to Paris at short notice. He hid in a small hotel near the Place de l'Étoile from the French public, where there were rumors that the songwriter was terminally ill. In his luggage he had a cassette with rehearsal recordings of his new songs. Gérard Jouannest criticized the monotony of the melodies, but François Rauber embellished them with his arrangements. Eddie Barclay rented a studio in Avenue Hoche for the recordings. Brel recorded the songs together with an orchestra conducted by Rauber, but never more than two songs per session, which had to be completed in just a few takes. Brel's voice had deteriorated and he could only sing for a maximum of three hours at a time before he had to take a break. He tried to lighten the tense mood in the crowded studio with jokes about his missing lung. Orly, with Jojo, was one of the first two songs Brel recorded on September 5.\nWhen Brel's last record was released on November 17, 1977, it triggered an enormous response from the public. The record had no title, the cover showed only the four letters of his surname against a blue cloudy sky. Barclay did not do any conventional advertising, but by demonstrating secrecy, delivering locked containers and opening the combination locks at the same time, he created a special advertising hit that caused expectations to skyrocket and resulted in 1 million pre-orders. Brel, who had already left Paris for the South Seas, was annoyed by the hype. He lived in Hiva Oa for another six months until his health deteriorated to such an extent that he had to return to Paris in July 1978, this time for chemotherapy. Three months later, he died of heart failure on October 9, 1978 in Bobigny near Paris.\n\n\n== Interpretation ==\n\n\n=== Love and separation ===\nAccording to Maddly Bamy, Brel described Orly as \"une belle chanson d'amour\" (\"a beautiful love song\"). For Sara Poole, it is on a par with songs such as Ne me quitte pas or Madeleine, which powerfully and dramatically evoke despair and being at the mercy of deep passions. Monique Watrin's \"mini-tragedy\" Orly is reminiscent of the early, passionate Brel from 1959, the year in which he wrote the \"love song of the century\" (according to Frédéric Brun) with Ne me quitte pas. From the point of view of his song colleague Serge Lama, Brel only wrote four real love songs: Ne me quitte pas, La chanson des vieux amants, Orly and Jojo. For Anne Bauer, Orly is even the \"only song by Brel in which there is love without reservations, without ulterior motives and without lies\".\nOrly describes the painful separation of a couple who love each other but are unable to stay together due to unfulfilled circumstances. Unlike songs such as Je ne sais pas (1958) or La Colombe (1959), the separation does not take place on a train platform, but in the midst of the crowds at a busy airport. And also unlike earlier songs, Brel stays completely out of the action and limits himself to describing what he sees. In doing so, he uses quasi-filmic stylistic devices and focuses the lens alternately on the couple as a whole and the individual people, their behavior, their gestures, their looks and their tears, with which he paints a disillusioned picture of human existence. The introductory lines \"Ils sont plus de deux mille / Et je ne vois qu'eux deux\" (\"They are over two thousand and I only see them both\"), which are repeated twice in the course of the first two verses, serve as a kind of leitmotif. They serve to focus the narrator's gaze from the general to the particular.\nAt the beginning, Brel shows the couple as a unit with expressions such as \"eux deux\", \"ces deux\", \"tous les deux\" and \"ils\" (\"they both\", \"these two\", \"both of them\" and \"they\"). It evokes the image of a very close, intimate union in the listener. This is reinforced by the external circumstances, the rain that covers them both and is reflected in their tears, as well as the shared fire that burns within them both. During the first, reluctant attempts at separation, the movement of the two bodies in relation to each other is reminiscent of natural elements, of ebb and flow. The couple stands out from the surrounding crowd, not only through the focus of the viewer, but also by living a love that remains incomprehensible to the others, condemned by them. It is a love that knows its limitations, that does not need false promises and that grows through the obstacle between the lovers.\nWith the separation of the couple, the individual beings emerge. Both cope with the pain in their own way, which for Watrin conveys typical gender roles. First, the man becomes recognizable as an independent person. Here Brel works with a syllepse, in which it is only corrected in retrospect that it was the man alone who cried out his pain in \"gros bouillons\" (\"thick broth\"). For Sara Poole, this combination of the phrases \"bouillir à gros bouillons\" (\"boil quickly\") and \"pleurer à chaudes larmes\" (\"cry his eyes out\") is equally associated with thick tears, desperate, uncontrolled sobbing and a passionate, feverish heat. The man is also the first who can no longer bear the suffering, neither his own nor that of his partner. He flees into activity and abruptly carries out the separation that had previously been repeatedly postponed.\nThe woman is left behind. As before with the man's tears, Brel also resorts to hyperbole for her pain, to the stylistic device of exaggeration and, according to Patrick Baton, a veritable explosion of time: \"Ses bras vont jusqu'à terre / Ça y est elle a mille ans\" (\"Her arms go down to the ground / It's time, she's a thousand years old\"). According to Hubert Thébault, the farewells of lovers in Brel's songs have always been as heartbreaking and final as death. After the loss of love, the woman thinks she has met her own death. The connection between love and death is followed by a symbolic circle as she turns around herself alone. She refuses to acknowledge reality and imagines impossible happiness in order to maintain her life. In the end, she feels \"à vendre\" (\"for sale\"), because Brel's songs' characters believe even less in eternal fidelity than in eternal love. For Watrin, however, the vocabulary also contains the possibility of a life without the other, the opening of a new dimension of one's own future.\nAccording to Sara Poole, there are no winners in the couple's separation. Both suffer equally. What is unusual in Orly, however, is that for the first time in Brel's work, it is not the man but the woman who is portrayed as abandoned, as a victim who receives the sympathy and compassion of the songwriter. Poole finds the portrayal of the abandoned woman incomparably more touching than, for example, the vainly waiting admirer with his bouquet of flowers in Madeleine. Like Michaela Weiss, she contrasts the empathy of this song with the frequently voiced accusation of misogyny in Brel's songs such as Les biches. Marc Robine asks with regard to this accusation: \"mais comment peut-on encore y croire après avoir écouté Orly?\" (\"how can one still believe it?\"). (\"how can one still believe in it after having heard Orly?\") For Bruno Hongre and Paul Lidsky, it is Brel's final message, after the exclusively male perspective of his songs, to have empathized with the broken heart of a woman with such intensity at the end.\n\n\n=== Sickness and death ===\nBrel himself pointed out a different, more personal reading of the song in a conversation with his friend, the physician Paul-Robert Thomas, in 1978:«As-tu écouté ma chanson Orly avec attention? Il s’agit de deux amants qui se séparent, mais surtout d’une métaphore de la Vie et de la Mort. D’un être qui sent sa vie lui échapper; le jour où, par exemple, il décide de partir se faire soigner. Et l’avion se pose à Orly! Dernier aéroport, pour un dernier voyage…»\n\"Have you listened carefully to my song Orly? It's about two lovers who part, but above all it's a metaphor for Life and Death. Of a being who feels his life slipping away from him; the day when, for example, he decides to leave for treatment. And the plane lands at Orly! Last airport, for a last journey... \"\n\nJacques Brel: Interview with Paul-Robert ThomasAccording to Sara Poole, the petrified woman left behind faces a future from which meaning and life have disappeared after the man has been \"swallowed up\" by the staircase (\"Bouffé\"). For Brel's daughter France and André Sallée, it is a staircase into darkness that devours the man as if he were being consumed by a disease. Jean-Luc Pétry also recognizes this illness in the juxtaposition of the couple with the surrounding crowd: the skinny bodies of the lovers are surrounded by healthy, well-fed air travellers who become voyeurs of their pain. The good constitution of the bystanders is reproached by the narrator with terms such as \"adipeux en sueur\" (\"sweating fats\") or \"bouffeurs d'espoir\" (\"bearers of hope\", literally: \"eaters of hope\"), so indecent does their health appear next to the suffering couple.\nIn his interpretation for the RTBF, Sébastien Ministru continues: \"L'escalier, c'est la mort.\" (\"The staircase, that's death.\") It is explicitly about the disappearance of the man, and this in a vocabulary that does not come from a departure lounge, but from a death chamber: dry bodies, drooling words, grief, tears, a scream, a restless hand like a last outburst of life. In all of this is the description of a death struggle, the last breaths of a dying person. It is a farewell greeting from the terminally ill Brel, who died eleven months after the release of his last album.\n\n\n=== With or without Bécaud ===\n\nIn the chorus of Orly, Brel refers to a famous song by his fellow songwriter Gilbert Bécaud from 1963: Dimanche à Orly. The lyrics are by Pierre Delanoë, the music by Bécaud. It is about the hopeful fantasies of a young employee who goes to Paris-Orly airport every Sunday to watch the planes and dream of faraway lands. One day, he hopes, he will be on one of those planes himself. The chorus begins with the verses«Je m’en vais l’ dimanche à Orly. \nSur l’aéroport, on voit s’envoler\nDes avions pour tous les pays.\nPour l’après-midi… J’ai de quoi rêver.»\n\n– Pierre Delanoë: Dimanche à OrlyThe translation is something like: \"I'm going to Orly on Sunday. At the airport you can see planes flying to all countries. For the afternoon... I have something to dream about.\"\nBécaud's song, written fourteen years before Brel's Orly, tells of a time when the airport was France's biggest visitor attraction, even before the Eiffel Tower. After the inauguration of the Orly South Terminal in 1961, 10,000 travelers and just as many visitors came every day to spend the day in restaurants, cinemas, shopping arcades and on three visitor terraces. The airport, a \"huge monument of glass and steel\" (\"vaste monument de glaces et d'acier\"), stood for modernity and sophistication, as you could sometimes catch a glimpse of the travelling stars. The romanticizing mood of Dimanche à Orly was summed up by physicist Jeremy Bernstein: \"The cheer is relentless.\" And he concludes that this must have got on Brel's nerves.\nAccording to André Gaulin, Brel's Orly is a veritable \"anti-version\" of Bécaud's predecessor. Chris Tinker explains that life can be cruel and tragic even when the cheerful songs of Brel's contemporaries trickle out of the loudspeaker. Bécaud did not exactly feel honored by Brel's mention by name. Claude Lemesle judged it to be an \"unnecessary allusion\" (\"l'inutile allusion\") to the colleague, for which Brel later apologized by telephone. The Dutch journalist Pieter Steinz, on the other hand, just appreciated the comic relief with which the melancholy of Orly is put into perspective by a \"witty musical reference\" to the fellow songwriter.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nWhile Brel's last long-playing record was met with a wide range of very different reviews by French critics (from negative to very positive), the song Orly was often singled out positively from his work as a whole. In Télérama, for example, Jacques Marquis criticized the declining lyrics and outdated music, but classified Orly under \"trois ou quatre beaux titres\" (\"three or four beautiful titles\") on the record. In L'Express, Danièle Heymann had words of praise for Brel's release throughout, but gave Orly special praise as \"la plus belle chanson de rupture depuis Les Feuilles mortes\" (\"the most beautiful song about separation since Les Feuilles mortes\").  Looking back, Ulf Kubanke also considered Orly to be the \"highlight of the album\" in his review in laut.de. And Gilles Verlant described Orly, together with La ville s'endormait and Les marquises, as \"trois des plus belles chansons jamais écrites par Brel\" (\"three of the most beautiful songs Brel has ever written\").\nBrel's older brother Pierre Brel saw Orly as the most impressive song from his younger brother's entire repertoire. Claude Lemesle described it as a \"chef-d'œuvre\" (\"masterpiece\"). Jérôme Pintoux judged: \"Une chanson mélo, pathétique. Un peu trop longue peut-être.\" (\"A melodramatic, pathetic song. A little too long perhaps.\") Pieter Steinz wrote in 1996: \"Het is het droevigste afscheidslied dat ik ken.\" (\"It is the saddest farewell song I know.\") In 2015, a year before his death, Steinz, who was suffering from ALS, also chose the song as the background music for his own funeral service.\nOrly has been recorded in more than 30 cover versions. These include translations into Afrikaans, English, Italian, Dutch and Russian. Loek Huisman translated the song into German under the title Flugplatz. Michael Heltau sang the version in 1989 on the album Heltau - Brel Vol 2. The French original was interpreted by Dominique Horwitz (1997 on Singt Jacques Brel and 2012 on Best of Live - Jacques Brel), Vadim Piankov (1998 on Chante Jacques Brel, 2001 on Brel... Barbara and 2009 on Vadim Piankov interprète Jacques Brel), Anne Sylvestre (2000 on Souvenirs de France), Pierre Bachelet (2003 on Tu ne nous quittes pas), Florent Pagny (2007 on Pagny chante Brel and 2008 on De part et d'autre), Laurence Revey (2008 on Laurence Revey) and Maurane (2018 on Brel).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nJacques Brel: Tout Brel.

        "content": "The Embassy of Singapore, Tokyo is Singapore's main diplomatic mission to Japan. It is located at 5-12-3 Roppongi, Minato, Tokyo.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nJapan and Singapore established diplomatic relations on 26 April 1966, a few months after Singapore was expelled from Malaysia and became an independent country. The construction of the current embassy was completed in 1978. It was designed by the Japanese architect Shinichi Okada (岡田新一). The garden of the embassy was designed by the Japanese landscape architect Junichi Inada (稲田純一), who played a central role in planning Singapore's national parks for nearly half a century. His last work there was \"The Canyon\" at the Gardens by the Bay, completed in 2016.\nThe incumbent ambassador since April 2023 is Eng Chuan Ong, who earned a Bachelor of Engineering degree from Tokyo Institute of Technology in 1993. Before being posted in Tokyo for the second time in his career, he served as Ambassador to Belgium with concurrent accreditation to the European Union, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg from April 2012 to April 2016, and as Deputy Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from May 2016 to May 2023.\n\n\n== Scandals ==\n\n\n=== Voyeuristic photographing of underage males ===\nOn 2 May 2024, it was reported that a Singaporean counsellor, then aged 55, was suspected of voyeuristically photographing a junior high school boy in a public bath in Minato, Tokyo, near the embassy during his tenure as a diplomat. He had repeatedly committed this offence, and during questioning by the police, he agreed to delete 700 photos he had taken in the public bath. However, due to his diplomatic immunity, he was not arrested.  The Metropolitan Police Department was investigating the case with a view to charges of violation of the Act on Prohibition of Child Prostitution and Pornography (production) and the Act on Punishment of Persons for Taking Photographs of Sexual Desire (filming), but the Embassy of Singapore explained that he had completed his duties as of 12 April and already returned to Singapore.\n\n\n== See also ==\nJapan–Singapore relations\nList of ambassadors of Singapore to Japan\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "Oscar Clavarino (born 22 May 1999) is an Australian rules footballer who played for St Kilda in the Australian Football League (AFL). Clavarino, a key defender, is noted for his intercept marking ability.\nDrafted as a second-round pick in 2017, Clavarino's AFL career was curtailed by slow development, ankle and hamstring injuries, and interruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic. He spent most of his time at St Kilda playing for their second-tier Victorian Football League (VFL) affiliate, Sandringham. In 2021, Clavarino finally made his AFL debut, 1283 days after he had been drafted. St Kilda delisted him at the season's conclusion; he continued his football with South Adelaide in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL).\n\n\n== Junior career ==\nClavarino grew up in Melbourne's southeast. A Hawthorn supporter, he aspired to playing AFL \"since he [could] remember\". He played his junior football with Berwick, beginning as a tall utility comfortable playing forward or in defence. When Clavarino was nine years old, he played in an Auskick match on the Melbourne Cricket Ground.\nClavarino was educated at Haileybury, a member of the Associated Public Schools (APS) group, and was in the leadership group for the school's football team. He gained two mentors at Haileybury: Josh Battle, a good friend who was drafted by St Kilda a year before Clavarino and gave him advice on the time and diet management required of professional footballers; and Matthew Lloyd, the former Essendon forward, who was Clavarino's assistant coach from the age of 16.\nClavarino played in the TAC Cup for the Dandenong Stingrays. In 2017, his draft year, he captained the team, averaging 16 disposals and six marks per game.\nIn 2015, Clavarino represented Vic Country at the AFL under-16 national championships, held on the Gold Coast in July. He appeared at the 2016 under-18 national championships as a bottom-ager. On his return in 2017, he co-captained Vic Country alongside James Worpel and made the All-Australian side.\nIn August 2016, Clavarino was named among thirty prospective draftees for the following year in the AFL Academy's level-two intake. In December that year, he trained with Melbourne for two weeks as part of an Academy program to give prospective draftees insight into life at an AFL club.\nAhead of the 2017 national draft, it was unclear when Clavarino would be selected; media assessments placed him between a late first-round pick to an early third-round pick. He was considered the best intercept marker in his cohort and noted for his leadership.\n\n\n== Senior career ==\n\n\n=== 2017–2021: AFL career ===\nClavarino was drafted by St Kilda with pick 35 in the 2017 national draft. Clavarino was St Kilda's third selection; the club had already taken Hunter Clark and Nick Coffield with picks 7 and 8 and went on to choose Ben Paton with pick 46. St Kilda sent Clavarino's new teammate David Armitage around to his home to present him with a club guernsey.\nClavarino spent his early seasons with St Kilda developing his strength to AFL standards. Describing himself as a \"tall and skinny\" player in his reflections, Clavarino did not expect to play at AFL level for a few seasons. He named several mentors at St Kilda: among the staff, Aaron Hamill, the VFL coach; and Steve Forcone, the strength and conditioning coach. Among the players, he named defensive veterans Nathan Brown and Dylan Roberton.\nIn February 2019, Clavarino injured his ankle in a marking contest during an intra-club practice match. The injury sidelined him for eight weeks. This was a serious setback – Clavarino had been anticipated to make his AFL debut in the opening round of the season, since Brown was suspended and fellow key defender Jake Carlisle was recovering from an injured back. Clavarino ended up playing 14 VFL matches with Sandringham for the year, but did not play an AFL game. He signed a one-year contract extension in October; Simon Lethlean, the club's general manager of football, acknowledged Clavarino's position as a \"bigger-bodied defender\" meant he would take some time to develop as a player.\nClavarino's development was further interrupted in 2020 by the emerging COVID-19 pandemic. The AFL season was suspended for more than two months and only resumed under strict quarantine arrangements – the VFL season was cancelled altogether. In the absence of reserves football, Clavarino pressed his case for AFL selection through the practice games arranged against other clubs. These scratch matches were played under relaxed rules and reduced numbers; on one occasion, Clavarino and some teammates played for Essendon to balance their match. The pandemic was not the only interruption to Clavarino's progress; he also suffered a hamstring injury in June, which kept him out of football for several weeks. In November, St Kilda moved Clavarino and his teammate Darragh Joyce to its rookie list under a new AFL provision permitting clubs to transfer two senior players in this way without waiting for the rookie draft.\nIn May 2021, Clavarino finally played his first AFL match, 1283 days after being drafted; a twenty-point victory over North Melbourne in round 11. Forcone delivered him the news of his selection at a team meeting. Victoria was still in COVID-19 lockdown and AFL matches in the state were played without crowds, so Clavarino's family was unable to attend the game; St Kilda set up a videoconference so they could watch his guernsey presentation. Clavarino held his place for the following week's nine-point loss against Sydney, but he was then dropped. He returned in round 19 against West Coast, where he played what saints.com.au regarded as his best match; he accrued 14 disposals, three inside-50s and six marks. Clavarino played in St Kilda's final two matches for the year, ending with a 58-point win over Fremantle.\nSt Kilda delisted Clavarino in September. During his time at the club, he played five AFL matches and 39 VFL matches.\n\n\n=== 2022–present: SANFL career ===\nUpon his delisting by St Kilda, Clavarino received contract offers from several VFL and SANFL clubs. He opted for the SANFL because he wanted a fresh start; he also felt VFL clubs with AFL affiliates tended to change their starting lineups too often because they needed to accommodate their AFL-listed players. Clavarino set himself the goal of getting a second opportunity in the AFL.\nClavarino signed with South Adelaide. His recruitment was considered timely, as key defender Sam Skinner had just left for Port Adelaide's AFL side. Port Adelaide also listed Clavarino among 20 players its AFL side could call upon if too many of its own players became unavailable through COVID-19 isolation procedures. Clavarino made his SANFL debut in the opening round of the 2022 season against Central Districts. By 2023, he had been named in South Adelaide's leadership group; in 2024, he became the club's vice-captain.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOscar Clavarino's playing statistics from AFL Tables\nOscar Clavarino at AustralianFootball.com",

        "content": "Julian Jootaek Kim (Korean: 김주택), also known as Julian Kim, is a South Korean baritone opera singer, crossover artist, and musical theater performer. He was born on September 9, 1986. Kim is known for his portrayal of Figaro in the opera Il barbiere di Siviglia in Italy, which he performed more than 70 times, and as the Phantom in a Korean replica production of the musical Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nJulian Kim, an opera singer and musical actor, is an alumnus of Sunhwa Arts School. After completing his high school education in South Korea, Kim continued his studies at the Giuseppe Verdi Conservatory in Milan, Italy, graduating with first-class honors in 2010.\n\n\n== Singing Competitions ==\nKim has achieved numerous accolades throughout his career. He secured the Grand Prize in The Korea Voice Competition by the Lee DaeWoong Music Scholarship Foundation and clinched the first place in the Shin Youngok Competition during his high school years in Korea. In Italy, he garnered the Premio Miglior Giovane Promessa (Best Young Promise Prize) in the Renata Tebaldi International Competition in 2007. Additionally, he attained the second place in the Riccardo Zandonai Competition and International Lyric Competition \"Magda Olivero\" and the first place and the Young Voices Award by the City of Magenta in 2009, followed by the third place in the Francesc Viñas International Singing Competition and the second place in the International Singing Competition Maria Caniglia in 2011. In 2012, he secured second place in the Concorso Internazionale di Canto Lirico Giacinto Prandelli, the International Singing Competition Maria Caniglia, and the Verdian Voices International Singing Competition. Furthermore, he triumphed by achieving first place in the International Singing Competition of Toulouse and the second place in the Viotti International Music Competition. Noteworthy accolades include the fourth place and second place in the Seoul International Music Competition in 2007 and 2013, respectively, alongside the Myung-Whun Chung Miracle Of Music Awards received in Korea in 2011.\n\n\n== Opera Repertoire ==\nKim's debut took place in 2009 at the Teatro Pergolesi in Jesi, Italy, where he performed as Figaro in  Il barbiere di Siviglia. He has since portrayed leading roles in various renowned operas, including La Traviata, The Marriage of Figaro, Madame Butterfly, Cavalleria Rusticana, Cosi fan tutte, Il barbiere di Siviglia, Simon Boccanegra, Pagliacci, Lucia di Lammermoor, La Bohème, and Rigoletto across multiple theaters in Italy.\nJulian Kim has portrayed the character Figaro during the 2014–2020 season at Teatro La Fenice, featuring in 47 out of a total of 60 performances of Il Barbiere de serville. Furthermore, he participated in 20 out of 27 performances of La Bohème during the same season at Teatro La Fenice, embodying roles such as Marcello or Schaunard. Kim collaborated extensively with Maestro Myung-Whun Chung and also had the privilege of working with renowned conductors like Sir Antonio Pappano, Roberto Polastri, Daniel Oren, Jader Bignamini, Riccardo Frizza, Stefano Ranzani, Daniele Rustioni, Francesco Cilluffo, Gregory Kunde, and Juraj Valčuha. His performances primarily took place in Italy, notably at Teatro La Fenice in Venice, Teatro del Maggio Musicale Fiorentino in Florence, Teatro dell'Opera di Roma, and Terme di Caracalla in Rome. He also showcased his talent in Korea, as well as in other countries such as Germany, China, Austria and Peru.\n\n\n== Phantom Singer (TV Program) ==\nPhantom Singer is a television show on JTBC in Korea that functions as an audition program to select a male crossover vocal quartet. Season 1 of the show aired from November 11, 2016, to January 27, 2017.\nHe mentioned feeling his heart race while watching Phantom Singer 1, leading to a realization that he needed a change in his life. Despite his deep involvement in numerous operas in Italy that he cherished, he yearned to explore various genres of singing. His colleagues in the classical field, as well as his parents, were worried that his exposure to popular music could harm his career in opera when he decided to participate in Phantom Singer 2. Kim chose to be on the show to broaden the listener pool of classical music, believing that music is for anyone who enjoys it regardless of the genre.\nIn the previous season 1, there were singers with classical training from Korea, Italy, and the USA, but none were working in the opera scene abroad. In season 2, about half of the 32 finalists were classically trained, with one graduate student who was a bass-baritone from Germany. Julian Jootaek Kim was referred to as 'the world-famous opera star' on the show, with one judge questioning why he chose to join.\nUltimately, he emerged as a runner-up and joined a group named Miraclass - a title derived from blending \"miracle\" and \"class,\" signifying their commitment to delivering an extraordinary reinterpretation of classical music or exceptional excellence in music. Following the show, his schedule was packed with commitments as a crossover singer in Korea and an opera singer in Italy. During this time, he performed in various productions in Italy, including La bohème, I puritani, La traviata, L'elisir d'amore, Don Carlo, and Il barbiere di Siviglia, as well as in a production of La bohème in Germany, spanning the period between the end of Phantom Singer season 2 and the start of season 3.\nHis continued success in Italian opera was a significant encouragement for the production team of Phantom Singer as they prepared for the next season. They held auditions in Europe to recruit participants for Season 3, emphasizing the importance of 'finding talents like Julian Jootaek Kim'. A surge of classical vocalists in higher education and opera houses abroad auditioned for Seasons 3 and 4. Among the final participants in Season 3 and Season 4, a notable number were from higher education or associated with opera houses. In particular, Canada-based countertenor David Dong Qyu Lee in Season 4 was a big surprise due to his fame and prolific career in opera. The classical and crossover concerts performed by those from Phantom Singer saw top ticket sales, attracting the general public to these classically-oriented events.\n\n\n== Miraclass ==\nMiraclass, the crossover group, is composed of Julian Jootaek Kim, Phillip Jeong, Kang-hyeon Park, and Tae-in Han. The group released a full album titled 'Romantica' in 2018 and actively participated in Phantom Singer concerts along with hosting their own concerts from 2017 to 2020 in Korea. Julian Kim frequently traveled between Korea and Italy, performing notably at Teatro La Fenice, Italy, before the COVID-19 outbreak.\nDuring the COVID-19 quarantine period, JTBC aired a program called Phantom Singer All Stars, where the three finalist quartet teams from the previous three seasons competed or showcased their performances to online audiences. Miraclass excelled in this show, securing numerous wins, including one MVP by performing a rendition of Josh Groban's song Mai, in the competitions among the nine participating groups. Kim also collaborated with other singers in the program, such as Jo Mingyu of Forestella and Yoo Seul-gi of Duetto.\nSince their formation on September 26, 2017, Miraclass has actively hosted concerts, released full albums, and engaged with their audience through a YouTube channel named Just-10-minute produced by mexicomini52. On the channel, they partake in various challenges and provide glimpses into their bond, friendship as well as daily lives and camaraderie.\n\n\n== Concerts ==\nKim has taken part in 20 concerts linked to Italian opera across different countries such as Italy, Russia, Austria, Japan, and Korea. These performances included collaborations with conductors Edoardo Müller, Pietro Mianiti, and Marco Boemi. Additionally, he has engaged in classical concerts alongside opera singers and crossover events in Korea, totaling over 100 concerts, excluding those with the crossover group Miraclass.\nIn concert adaptations of Das Rheingold under the baton of Myung-Whun Chung in Seoul in 2014, and Fidelio conducted by Sir Antonio Pappano in Rome in 2016, Kim assumed the roles of Donner and Don Fernando, respectively. He has been a prominent soloist in concerts overseen by Myung-Whun Chung. Notably, he was one of 8 soloists in Mahler's Symphony No. 8 performed by the Seoul Symphony Orchestra in 2011, and the sole male soloist for the Expo 2012 Concert in 2012, both under the direction of Myung-Whun Chung.\nKim was actively involved in concerts and operas in Korea during the early 2010s. However, his significant introduction to the Korean audience was perhaps through the 'Baritone Julian Jootaek Kim Recital (Korean: 바리톤 김주택 리사이틀)' in 2015 in Seoul. This recital featured a diverse range of pieces, including works by composers like F. Schubert, J. P. E. Martini, G. Giordani, F. P. Tosti, S. Gastaldon, and F. Chopin, alongside arias from Lucia di Lammermoor and L'elisir d'amore by G. Donizetti, Don Giovanni by W. A. Mozart, and Giovanna d'Arco and La Forza del Destino by G. Verdi. Kim's standout performance in this recital led to him receiving the Best New Artist Award at the 2nd Seoul Art Center Award in 2016.\nThe With Concert was initiated with the goal of offering performance opportunities to talented individuals with developmental disabilities and Shinhan Music Awardees in Korea. This was made possible through a partnership agreement between Deoksugung Palace Management of Cultural Heritage Administration, and the Heart-Heart Foundation. Kim, the inaugural winner of the Shinhan Music Award, performed as part of this collaboration.\nKorea is a country with highly concentrated metropolitan areas and other regions facing declining populations. Through the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism and the Korean Culture and Arts Centers Association, the Korean government introduced the '방방곡곡 문화공감' program, promoting cultural empathy across diverse landscapes. This initiative aimed to bring a variety of cultural performances to stages in smaller cities and rural areas across Korea, with a focus on including at least 30% of underprivileged individuals in the audience. Kim, along with his Miraclass teammate Tenor Phillip Jeong, magician Hyungbae Choi, Soprano Veronica Yoo, and the BeHa Philharmonic Orchestra, actively participated in the program. Traveling to 10 cities throughout Korea in 2022 and 2023, this interdisciplinary team showcased a mix of opera arias, Korean traditional songs, Spanish and Italian melodies, musical pieces with orchestral accompaniment, and magic acts. The program received overwhelming praise, enhancing the classical music experience and fostering cultural connections with an enthusiastic audience.\nIn Korea, the staging of operas is limited due to a lack of public interest. For instance, in 2023, there were only 17 opera productions, 7 in Daegu, 2 in Seongnam and 8 in Seoul, with a total of 56 performances. Instead, concerts and instrumental performances featuring popular arias tend to attract more public attention. As part of efforts to modernize opera, 'The Taming of Casanova,' an opera collage featuring famous arias from diverse operas, was created. Kim participated in this innovative project from 2016 to 2019 with the aim of drawing a larger audience to the classical music domain.\nIn 2019, Kim presented two additional recitals. Following a fan concert in 2021, he now regularly hosts a set of concerts titled 'Baritone Julian Jootaek Kim's Music Library,' featuring performances of opera arias, classical tunes, Italian canzones, musical numbers, and Korean songs.\n\n\n== Musical career ==\nIn late February 2020, due to COVID-19, all operas were canceled in Italy, forcing Kim to stay in Korea. With the situation slightly better in Korea, musical performances were allowed with stringent COVID-19 protocols. During this period, Kim attended the musical shows of his Miraclass teammate, Kang-hyeon Park, sparking a renewed interest in musical theater.\nLater, he auditioned online for the Korean production of The Phantom of the Opera produced by the Really Useful Group and was selected as one of the four phantoms for the 2023–2024 production. His debut performance occurred on March 28, 2023, in Busan, followed by 31 performances in Seoul and 21 in Daegu, totaling 82 performances.\nFor his outstanding portrayal of the Phantom, he received The New Male Actor Award at the 8th Korea Musical Awards in January 2024.\nCurrently, Julian Kim is portraying Pierre Bezukhov in the Korean production of the musical Natasha, Pierre, and the Great Comet of 1812 from March to June in 2024.\n\n\n== Fandom ==\nHis given name, Jootaek, shares an identical pronunciation with the Korean word for \"house.\" After gaining a dedicated following in Korea post-Phantom Singer 2, Kim established a fan cafe named 'The House Complex (Korean: 주택단지),' a title that remains in use, where the fans are referred to as residents. He consistently expresses his gratitude and affection towards the residents of the House Complex.\n\n\n== Awards and recognition ==\nHe won the Best New Artist Award at the Seoul Arts Center award in 2015  and Best New Actor Award at the 8th Korean Musical Awards in 2023.\n\n\n=== Awards ===\n\n\n== Voice ==\nJulian Kim is known as a Verdian baritone. In his youth, he attempted to imitate Piero Cappuccilli, who could sing four phrases in a single breath and cover the tenor range. Kim can hit A4 and is often likened to Cappuccilli. His voice is commonly described as a Verdi baritone, characterized by warmth, resonance, and excellent phrasing and tone in Italian operas. During the Verdi competition, Leo Nucci remarked to him, 'Lui canta come dio,' meaning 'He sings like a god.'\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Extended Plays ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Participation releases ===\n\n\n== Notable performances ==\nSince Kim's opera debut performing Il Barbiere di Siviglia, he has performed it 75 times in various cities across Italy. One of the most favored arias in his concerts is \"Largo al factotum,\" beloved by both the artist himself and the audience. As he humbly stated that he might not have been able to pass as an Italian in everyday conversation, he could sing like an Italian if he tried hard on diction and enunciation. It was not easy to be in Italian opera with a different mother tongue, as proven by the fact that there were only three other Korean Figaros in Il Barbiere di Siviglia performed in Italy following his footsteps as of May 2024. The praise or mere acceptance was a big success. Continuous performance opportunities as Figaro, who needed to sing \"Largo al factotum\" full of rap-like tongue twisters, were the assurance of his success as an opera singer in Italy. Topping it off, the reviews of his Figaro performance stated: 'Julian Kim is Figaro: the Korean baritone would perhaps be more at ease in singing parts; the diction was not always exact, but the high notes were beautiful, the accent was lively, and the color of the voice remained beautiful,' and 'The artistic direction, spearheaded by Cristiano Sandri, made unexpected choices in forming an excellent cast, well blended in terms of both vocal quality and stage presence. The result is a brilliant Figaro, vocally very well set up, portrayed by the South Korean Julian Kim.'\nFidelio, the sole opera composed by Ludwig van Beethoven, was presented in Rome's Sala Santa Cecilia in Parco della Musica, conducted by Sir Antonio Pappano in 2016. This German opera graced an Italian theater stage in a concert format. Julian Kim took on the role of the king's minister, Don Fernando. Despite being the youngest among the performers, Kim portrayed his character with a commanding presence fitting of the highest rank. In critics' reviews, Julian Kim was praised as 'The still very young baritone from South Korea Julian Kim offered a surprise as the beautifully singing Don Fernando. A real cavalier baritone, who is currently studying in Milan, gave a tremendous test of talent and also with an almost Austrian German diction! You should remember this name' and 'Julian Kim's Don Fernando is seraphic, above all thanks to a soft timbre and soft phrasing that distinguish Korean.'\nFollowing the record-breaking flood in Venice in 2019, Don Carlo was staged at Teatro La Fenice amidst challenges. The theater's electrical facilities were damaged, preventing performers from rehearsing on-site. Concerns arose whether the repairs could be completed in time for the opera's premiere. Against the odds, the opera opened as scheduled under the baton of Maestro Myung-Whun Chung, serving as a symbolic triumph over adversity. Julian Kim portrayed Rodrigo, the Marquis of Posa, in this production. The critiques highlight: 'Excellent performance by Julian Kim (Posa), who possesses a remarkable voice, characterized by its dark timbre and skilled modulation between forte and piano.' Also stated: 'Among the performers, the most Verdian voice, exemplifying weight and solidity, belongs to baritone Julian Kim, notable for his portrayal as the Marquis of Posa, a role that received substantial directorial attention.' Furthermore, 'The Korean baritone, Julian Kim, excelled in his role as Rodrigo, showcasing outstanding vocal prowess. His well-supported singing voice, with its appealing timbre, coupled with secure phrasing enriched by subtle accents, added depth to his character portrayal. Additionally, his mastery in crafting the vocal line imbued his singing with a natural lyrical quality that was pleasing to the ear.'\nHaving established a successful career in the operatic realm, the expansion into musical theater came as a surprising development to the general public, yet was anticipated by his fans. His maiden venture in the musical domain saw him assume the role of the Phantom in Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera in Korea in 2023. Given the Phantom's vocal requirements, which could encompass operatic or legit high baritone styles, this debut role proved optimal for him. Embracing techniques tailored for musical theater, including the use of microphones, Kim delivered a commanding portrayal of the Phantom. His performance earned him the Best New Male Artist Award at The 8th Korea Musical Awards, a recognition bestowed upon actors who made their debut in Korean musical theaters within the past three years.\nKim is frequently invited to perform during national ceremonies in Korea and at ceremonial concerts in both Italy and Korea.\n\n\n== Influences ==\nHe admired Piero Cappuccilli, who was known for his extended phrasing and resonant high notes, qualities not commonly found in a baritone. Being likened to the esteemed Piero Cappuccilli was regarded as a flattering compliment to him. He also holds deep admiration and respect for Maestro Myung-Whun Chung, with whom he frequently collaborates in operatic performances and concerts.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Peperomia trichomanoides is a species of lithophyte in the genus Peperomia. It primarily grows on wet tropical biomes. Its Conservation Status is Threatened. \n\n\n== Description ==\nThe species is known only from the type locality, at 1,400-1,600 metres elevation on the steep limestone ramparts of Cerro Anguciana.\nPlants that were epilithic had flattened leaves and spikes against the rock. Short, thick, subcormose stems measuring 0.2–0.8 x 0.15-0.25 centimetres. In the basal rosette, leaves appear to alternate. Petioles are 0.3-1.9 centimetres long and spreading-hirsute, with uniseriate hairs. The blade of a leaf are 0.5-1.8 x 0.5-1.8 centimetres; broadly ovate to suborbicular or subreniform; impeltate or hardly rounded to subtruncate; broadly rounded to moderately acute apically; palmate: 3-5 nerved; appressed-hirsute on both sides (more sparsely so above); pellucid-gland dotted at least above. single, basal inflorescences. Peduncles are purbes as petioles, measuring 1.3–4.1 centimetres. The An unbranched, indeterminate inflorescence: beakless,  elliptical to wikt:subglobose, constricted to substipitate base, 2.7–7 centimetres x 0.3–0.4 millimetres; stigma apical.\nThe plants in this species bear a resemblance to miniature variants of P. saintpauliella, from which they differ in having proportionately longer peduncles and highly pubescent inflorescences rachises, in addition to their generally reduced size. This species is similar to some specimens of P. tuerckheimii (including P. hispidorhachis), a small calciphile that also occurs in the same area. P. tuerckheimii, however, has more elongate, peltate, non-cordate leaf blades with usually seven primary basal veins instead of five.\n\n\n== Taxonomy and naming ==\nIt was described in 1996 by Michael Howard Grayum in \"Phytologia.\", from collected specimens by Barry Edward Hammel in 1993. It gets its name from its habitat (epilithic and growing among mosses), appressed behaviour, and diminutive size, which are reminiscent of several \"Trichomanes\" fern species. \n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nIt is endemic to Costa Rica. It grows on epilithic environment and grows with mosses.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"6:16 in LA\" is a diss track written and recorded by American rapper Kendrick Lamar, as the second response track to Canadian rapper Drake's single \"Push Ups\" and his independently released song \"Taylor Made Freestyle\". Like \"Taylor Made Freestyle\", the song was made exclusively available on Instagram, on May 3, 2024.\nThe song was produced by Sounwave and Jack Antonoff. The song samples Al Green's 1972 song \"What a Wonderful Thing Love Is,\" a track which features guitarist Mabon \"Teenie\" Hodges, Drake's uncle.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nOn April 30, 2024, the rapper unexpectedly released the first diss track \"Euphoria\" on his YouTube channel and later on streaming services. In similar fashion to the release of Drake's song \"Taylor Made Freestyle\", which was only available to listen to on his social media channels, Lamar posted the full song through an Instagram post on May 3. He had previously teased a second diss track on \"Euphoria\" by referencing Drake's Meek Mill diss track \"Back to Back\" (2015).\nThe song title \"6:16 in LA\" plays on the time-and-location-themed tracks that Drake has included on many of his projects, such as \"9AM in Dallas\" (2010), \"5AM in Toronto\" (2013)\", \"6PM in New York\" (2015), \"4PM in Calabasas\" (2016), \"7AM on Bridle Path\" (2021), and \"8AM in Charlotte\" (2023). \nA Maybach driving glove is used as the cover art of this song, a cropped portion of the image used for the cover of Lamar's next single and diss track, Meet the Grahams.\nMany publications noted producer Jack Antonoff's involvement, believing it to be in retaliation to Drake's \"Taylor Made Freestyle\" as Jack Antonoff has been a consistent producer for the titular Taylor Swift.\n\n\n== Composition ==\nOn \"6:16 in LA\", the rapper also takes aim at Drake's record label OVO Sound for the first time, insinuating that people of the team secretly work for Lamar as well as accusing some of them of stabbing Drake behind his back. He also namechecks the viral 2020 hit song \"Toosie Slide\" and notes how the rapper would be unable to \"slide\" out of this track. In other instances, Lamar pokes fun at Drake's penchant for viral memes and mocks his distinct online activity.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"6:16 in LA\" on Instagram",

        "content": "Faina Efremovna Stavskaya Russian: Фаина Ефремовна Ставская; Belarusian: Фаіна Яфрэмаўна Стаўская; 1890–1937) was a Belarusian revolutionary. Initially involved in the anarchist movement, she carried out propaganda throughout Belarus and attempted to assassinate the governor of Katerynoslav province. She was caught and imprisoned for several years, over time becoming attracted to the principles of revolutionary socialism. Upon her release during the Russian Revolution of 1917, she joined the Socialist Revolutionary Party (PSR) and worked for it in Crimea, Moscow and Ufa. She was charged in the Trial of the Socialist Revolutionaries, but managed to avoid a prison sentence after she agreed to join the Communist Party. She worked in a number of official positions throughout the 1920s and 1930s, becoming the director of the State Public Historical Library of Russia. She was arrested and shot during the Great Purge of 1937.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life and activism ===\nFaina Efremovna Stavskaya was born on 19 November 1890, in Antopal, in the Grodno Governorate of the Russian Empire. She was raised in a Belarusian Jewish family, which provided her with an education. At a young age, she became interested in the ideas of anarchism and socialism.\nIn the wake of the Russian Revolution of 1905, she joined an anarchist communist group, for which she carried out revolutionary propaganda in the Belarusian cities of Hrodna, Kobryn, Pruzhany and Białystok. After being arrested in 1907, she moved to Katerynoslav, where she became involved in anarchist terrorism. On 17 May 1908, she unsuccessfully attempted to assassinate governor Alexander Klingenberg by setting off a bomb in the hotel \"France\", which destroyed the room it was placed in and broke all the hotel's windows. She was arrested on 18 June 1908 and sentenced to 20 years of penal labour, which she served in prisons in Riga, Yaroslavl and Rybinsk. On the occasion of the Romanov Tercentenary, she attempted to petition for amnesty, but was unsuccessful. At this time, she began to develop sympathies for revolutionary socialism and moved away from anarchism.\n\n\n=== Revolutionary activities ===\nStavskaya was released from prison during the February Revolution of 1917. She went to Petrograd, then to Moscow, before finally moving on to Crimea, where she met her husband Viktor Baranchenko. In September 1917, she joined the Socialist Revolutionary Party (PSR) and began working at the editorial offices for the party's paper Zemlya i Volya. There she became friends with the SR Fanny Kaplan, who would later attempt to assassinate Vladimir Lenin. The three lived together in a boarding house, which they shared with Lenin's brother Dmitry Ulyanov.\nIn September 1918, she went to Moscow and joined the SR Combat Organization led by Grigory Ivanovich Semyonov. The following month, the party's central committee sent her to Ufa and she continued to work for the central committee until March 1919, when she began organising trade unions in Moscow, for which she was detained for over three months. In November 1919, she joined the central bureau of the PSR's minority faction, serving in the post until August 1920. She was arrested again in December 1921 and, on 24 February 1922, she was charged with anti-Soviet agitation by the GRU. During the Trial of the Socialist Revolutionaries in August 1922, she was sentenced to two years imprisonment, but was granted a release after she agreed to join the Russian Communist Party (RCP) and the Society of Former Political Prisoners and Exiled Settlers (MOPR), on the recommendation of Nikolai Bukharin, Georgy Pyatakov and Leonid Serebryakov.\n\n\n=== Later life and death ===\nIn September 1922, she returned to Crimea and settled in Simferopol, where she worked in the RCP's accounting department and as secretary for the local board of the MOPR. In January 1925, she went back to Moscow, where she worked as secretary for student affairs at Vkhutemas. In February 1926, she was appointed as secretary of Main Fuel Administration (Glavtop) and served in this post until January 1930. The following month, she started work as a factory inspector, which she carried out until April 1932. On 1 June 1932, the MOPR granted her a personal pension, but soon renounced it after she found another job in September 1933. From then until 1937, she worked as the director of the State Public Historical Library of Russia. \nDuring the Great Purge, she was arrested on 30 April 1937 and charged with anti-Soviet agitation. On 13 July 1937, was found guilty by the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union and sentenced to be shot. Her body was buried in Moscow's Donskoye Cemetery. On 23 April 1957, she was posthumously rehabilitated by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.\n\n\n== References ==",

Like the festival before it, the school's name is a portmanteau of the Icelandic words 'lista' (art) and 'ungur' (young).\nThe school was formalized in 2013 with the first program launching in 2014, and is the first of only two folk high schools in Iceland, joined by Lýðháskólinn á Flateyri in 2017. Many of its buildings and facilities are co-opted from local industry, either occupying spaces underused outside of Seyðisfjörður's busy tourist season or redeveloping spaces vacated by changes to the local fishing industry. It takes applicants aged 18 years and over from around the world.\n\n\n== Administration ==\nAmerican British artist and curator Mark Rohtmaa-Jackson was hired as the new director of the school in October 2023.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site",

The team played for one season in the Continental Hockey League.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Wheels were the third separate attempts to form a team at the Wagon Wheel Resort. This time the new outfit was hoping to capitalize on the success of the Chicago Cardinals and Peoria Blades who had managed to establish themselves in their respective communities. Unfortunately, Rockton wasn't a hit on the ice and the team ended the year fifth out of six clubs. That season was all the team could muster as the finances weren't good enough to support a sequel. Despite their brief existence, The Wheels are fondly remembered by locals and they are occasionally honored by the nearby minor league team.\n\n\n== Season-by-season record ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHockey DB",

It was released on February 24, 2015, via Provogue Records, making it the band's only album for the label. Recording sessions took place at Retrophonics Studios in St. Augustine, Florida. Production was handled by Dan Prothero and JJ Grey, with Jesse Aratow serving as executive producer.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nOl' Glory was met with mixed or average reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 58, based on five reviews.\nKris Needs of Classic Rock praised the album, saying \"it's on those spiritual slowies that this crew rakes the biggest steps to creating the 21st-century southern masterpiece they are obviously capable of\". Lee Zimmerman of PopMatters also gave it a positive review, saying \"JJ Grey and Mofro provide a connection to the past and a time when talent and tenacity moved the music forward. Hallelujah for Ol' Glory. It's a prime example of what genuine Americana ought to emulate\".\nIn mixed reviews, AllMusic's Thom Jurek wondered: \"too many other tracks have one too many verses, could have used bridges, or been left off altogether. Ol' Glory may reveal a bigger, more multi-dimensional sound for Grey and Mofro, but at what price progress?\". Hal Horowitz of American Songwriter concluded: \"Grey and his band's drive, energy and enthusiasm go a long way to selling this music but at nearly an hour the effect is diluted. Leaving a handful of the weakest cuts in the vaults and honing the best parts from some of the others would have resulted in a stronger outing\". Q reviewer resumed: \"it's an accomplished production--but an unambitious production, a reluctance to soar\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJJ Grey & Mofro – Ol' Glory at Discogs (list of releases)",

Conducting the census is the responsibility of the Statistical Institute of Jamaica (STATIN), founded in 1946 and known as the Central Bureau of Statistics until 1955, and then as the Department of Statistics until 1984.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe 1943 census was the first conducted using the de jure method. Under this method, \"only persons who are permanent residents in the Island, even if they are temporarily away... are included.\" In addition, \"all persons are finally recorded in the locality in which they permanently reside.\"\nFollowing the 2011 census, it was noted some difficulties with carrying out the census were reported: \"the level of cooperation particularly in some urban centres was disappointing. Worker attitude also presented problems as in a number of cases workers had to be relieved of their duties due to poor and or unproductive work. There was not always sufficient recognition of the fact that remuneration was for work done.\"\n\n\n== Governing legislation ==\nIn 1929, the parliament passed a Census Law which was intended to facilitate a census in 1931. However, no census took place. The law was revised and reused to facilitate the 1943 census. Prior to 1929, all censuses \"were taken under separate laws enacted for each particular census, each becoming spent at the completion of such census.\"\n\n\n== List of censuses ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Constitutions (Ancient Greek: Πολιτεῖαι), or Politeiai, was a series of monographs written under the inspiration of Aristotle by his students or by Aristotle himself in the second half of the 4th century BCE. Each of the 158 parts described the history and political system of one of the Greek poleis. The only nearly completely preserved constitution is the Constitution of the Athenians.\n\n\n== Inventory ==\nThe cycle comprised 158 descriptions of Greek poleis. This information is provided by Diogenes Laertius and Hesychius of Miletus. Later commentators (Ammonius and Elias, 6th century) gave numbers like 250 or 255 works, but this could have resulted from including works by imitators in addition to the actual Politeiai, as concluded for the first time by the commentator on Aristotle in the 6th century, Simplicius, and also from Aristotle's descriptions of the Customary Laws of Barbarians. Another explanation for this number is a transmission error – the rounded number 150 could have been changed to 250. Another, less credible number is 171, reported by Ibn Abi Usaybi'a.\nThe content of individual works can be inferred primarily from preserved fragments. The most reliable group of Constitutions are those described in the preserved citations as Politeia written by Aristotle. These are the systems of the following poleis: Athens, Acarnania, Akragas, Ambracia, Argos, Arcadia, Achaea, Bottiaea, Cyprus, Delphi, Delos, Aegina, Elis, Epirus, Phocis, Gela, Himera, Ithaca, Keos, Cumae, Cius, Cythnus, Colophon, Corcyra, Corinth, Cyme, Cyrene, Sparta, Leukas, Locri Epizefiri, Miletus, Naxos, Naples, Opus, Orchomenus, Paros, Pellene, Samos, Samothrace, Sicyon, Syracuse, Taranto, Tegea, Tenedos, Thessaly.\nAnother group of poleis is presented in fragments where Aristotle's authorship is indicated, but without specifying a particular political system: Antandrus, Adramyttium, Chalcedon, Chalcis, Epidaurus, Crete, Crotone, Cythera, Meols, Miletus, Rhegion, Rhodes, Soloi, Sybaris, Thebes, Tenos.\nDue to the preparation of the Politeia as material for the Politics, it is highly probable to expand the obtained collection with cities appearing in this work: Abydos, Amphipolis, Antissa, Apollonia Illyria, Apollonia Pontica, Aphytis, Byzantium, Chios, Eretria, Pharsalos, Phocis, Hestiaea, Heraea, Heraclea Pontica, Histria, Catania, Clazomenae, Knidos, Kos, Larissa, Leontini, Magnesia, Mantineia, Mitylene, Thira, Thurii, Zancle.\nThe last group of potential political systems can be created from Heracleides' list – probably an author unknown from other activities (presumably from the 4th/5th century AD), sometimes identified as Aristotle's disciple Heracleides of Pontus or Heraclides Lembus, who lived in the 2nd century BC. Probably his source was only the Constitutions and the Customary Laws of Barbarians; after excluding the latter, the list of described poleis would also include Amorgos, Argilos, Ephesus, Icaria, Cephalonia, Lepreum, Minos, and Thespiae. In total, 44 poleis were included in the list.\nThe individual poleis were arranged alphabetically in the collection and numbered. The first was the Athenian politeia, and the politeia of Ithaca was numbered 42. Based on descriptions in Alexandrian catalogs, Heinrich Nissen proposed the thesis that the collection could have been divided into four parts corresponding to democracy, oligarchy, tyranny, and aristocracy. However, such a division would contradict the alphabetical order, would be very unbalanced, and would cause problems with classifying changing political systems.\n\n\n== Authorship and time of creation ==\nAristotle mentioned the collection of Constitutions in the Nicomachean Ethics (10.1181B17). It was supposed to be material gathered for his work on Politics. However, after the Athenian politeia was discovered, historians noted a later dating of the monographs (in the 320s BC) compared to the Politics (after 336 BC, most likely before 331 BC). Therefore, it was concluded from the analysis of the Constitution itself that the material was initially collected in the 330s BC, while its compilation occurred after Aristotle finished his work on Politics.\nThe only clue allowing for dating other than the Athenian politeia (besides Aristotle's lifetime) is the mention of gold coins in the Political Constitution of Cyrene, which were introduced around 340 BC. Due to the condition of the fragments, the authorship of the Athenian politeia was primarily considered. Historians agree that it is unlikely that Aristotle wrote all 158 politeia without the involvement of his students.\nArguments supporting the joint authorship of the politeia are provided by John Keaney. According to him, the schematic form of the works facilitated the author's quick creation of new politeia, which were probably shorter than the Athenian one. Additional facilitation could have been dictating the works, indicated by certain – characteristic for Aristotle – phrases repeated in the fragments. Aristotle could have obtained the information necessary to write the political systems during his travels (before his second stay in Athens) and from his students. Aristotle's authorship is also attested by ancient sources.\n\n\n== Structure and content ==\nAccording to John Keaney, the remaining constitutions were written following the same pattern as the Athenian one. An exception could be the Political Constitution of Arcadia, as the Arcadian League was founded in the 360s BC, so it might not have had a historical section. Similarly, systematic sections might have been absent from poleis that ceased to exist. Therefore, the remaining poleis had a historical part describing successive changes in political systems and a systematic part describing the system contemporary to the author.\nDavid Toye expressed the opinion that the Constitution of the Athenians might not be representative. He points out the significant prevalence of mythological themes in the preserved fragments, alongside the modest presence of fragments concerning historical times. This situation could be due to the tastes of the copyists in the Hellenistic period. However, based on Plutarch's opinion, the historian states that the treatises were still available at the end of the 1st century AD, indicating that they were being copied until that time. Another explanation is the overrepresentation of historical content in the Athenian politeia.\nAs sources for the historical part of the Constitutions, Aristotle must have relied on literary works. Relying solely on oral accounts would have provided information about events from only three or four generations ago. Additionally, there is no evidence of systematic travels by Aristotle and his students to collect materials for the cycle. From the part of Fragmente der griechischen Historiker dedicated to local history, Toye identified 27 authors whose works were likely available in 330 BC and useful for historical description. Most preserved fragments concerned heroic times. Only four historiographers could be classified as researchers of the history of individual poleis other than Athens. The rest referred more to the history of a larger area, resulting in the dominance of descriptions of the most politically significant centers – Athens, Sparta, and Syracuse, while descriptions of smaller cities were less favored. Therefore, Aristotle devoted most attention to these poleis in his Politics. The flourishing of local history occurred only in the Hellenistic period – Felix Jacoby collected more than twice as many fragments from this period (62).\nWith a limited resource of historiographers' works, the author of the Constitutions supplemented his cycle with information obtained from the analysis of poetry, proverbs, buildings, and individual objects. Nevertheless, in most cases, he did not have the opportunity to construct a continuous historical narrative analogous to the Constitution of the Athenians.\nAccording to Keaney, the Constitution of the Athenians was the longest. Following it would be the politeia of Lacedaemon, and the third in terms of extent might have been the politeia of Crete. This opinion is supported by the sequence of works in Heracleides' list and the significance of these places for the political scientist.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe Constitutions did not find wide resonance in ancient literature. The factual form of these works may have been a reason, as it did not appeal to enthusiasts of colorful language. Also, the political situation – the consolidation of the Greeks during the early Hellenistic period – did not favor the popularity of the histories of individual poleis. The collection was likely used by Alexandrian editors, who could refer to it when compiling biographies, curiosities, and explanations for other texts. Generally, the surviving fragments come from their commentaries. The last known individuals with access to the entire cycle of Constitutions were Heraclides and Sopatros (around 500 AD).\nAristotle did not have numerous imitators. The history of some Greek cities was compiled by his student, Dicaearchus of Messene, whose collection was among others in the hands of Cicero.\nThe collection of Aristotle's fragments was undertaken in the 19th century by Valentin Rose. He published them in the work Aristotelis qui ferebatur librorum fragmenta. In the 1886 edition, he gathered 223 fragments of Constitutions, of which 91 concerned Athens and 14 Sparta. Separate discoveries were made by papyri. In 1880, the Berlin Museum purchased small scrolls containing, as it later turned out, fragments of the historical part of the Constitution of the Athenians. Almost the entire Constitution of the Athenians was found on a papyrus at the British Museum. The content of P. Lond. 131 was published in 1891 by Frederic George Kenyon, and in the same year, a facsimile of the papyrus was also published.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nKulesza, Ryszard (2001). \"Wprowadzenie\".

        "content": "Ghazi Mir Zaman Khan, who became known as Loy Khan Ghazi Mir Zaman Khan Kunari was a Royal Afghan Army General and War Hero of the Afghan War of Independence who fought for Pashtun freedom against the British Empire. He is regarded as a National Hero in Afghanistan. \n\n\n== Early life ==\nMir Zaman was born the son of Haji Gulroz Khan in 1869 in Lamattak village, Kunar Province of Afghanistan. His great-grandfather was Mohammad Akram Khan who left the Tirah Valley due to tribal conflict and settled in Kunar.\n\n\n== Politics and military career ==\nFrom a young age Mir Zaman felt a strong hostility towards the British Raj and its encroachment on the Pashtunistan area. This drew him closer to the tribal leaders of the North-West Frontier of British India leading him to join them in the Sra Ghaza (Red Jihad) of 1908 during the Bazar Valley and Mohmand Expedition.\nDue to his frequent activity in crossing the Durand line when fighting the British, Emir Habibullah detained him out of suspicion till the King himself had died in February of 1919, and Mir Zaman was released. He caught the attention of Amanullah Khan as a courageous anti-British fighter, he built up a strong influence around the tribes of Kunar and had a close relationship with the Amir, whose mother considered him as her own \"adopted son\".\n\n\n=== Anglo-Afghan War of 1919 ===\nIn 1919, Afghanistan declared a holy war against British India and the call was answered by over 100,000 Afghans from both sides of the Durand. Mir Zaman fought in the Chatral front in the areas of Asmar and Arnawai where he led the tribes to victory over the British.\nHe was decorated with various medals after the war by the government of Ghazi Amanullah Khan, he became a member of the government council or Shura-i-Daylat and participated in the first Loya Jirgah of post-independence Afghanistan in 1921 at Jalalabad.\n\n\n=== Afghan rebellions ===\nMir Zaman Khan stayed loyal to Amanullah Khan and partook in operations against the Khost revolt of the Khostwal tribes and the Shinwari rebellion. \nHe remained loyal to Amanullah Khan through his reforms and modernisation, his second-eldest son Esmatullah Khan fought with him in the Afghan Civil War of 1928. Mir Zaman Khan and his Kunari tribals were sent to Jalalabad by the King Amanullah Khan to put down the rebellion and they were successful in holding their positions against multiple waves of major assaults of a large number of rebels.\n\n\n== Martyrdom in the Civil War ==\nIn February of 1929, the Commander of the Royal Afghan force in Jalalabad, Sardār Ali Ahmad Khan rebelled and proclaimed himself King of Afghanistan. Mir Zaman then left on a campaign for Kunar Province to gather support to attack the forces of Habibullāh Kalakāni. He was assassinated while in his prayers at a mosque in Kunar. \nIn early 1929, Amanullah Khan abdicated the throne as the Emir of Afghanistan. The son of the late Mir Zaman Khan, Esmatullah Khan joined Amanullah Khan to Kandahar and accompanied him, taking part in small clashes of the King's accompanying army till Quetta, Baluchistan. Esmatullah Khan was taken into custody at Peshawar and offered a large amount of land and property in exchange for his Zamani family to abandon their Anti-British stance, they warned him of an unhopeful future in post-Amanullah Afghanistan but he rejected the offer and was secretly guided back to Afghanistan by Mohmand tribesmen.\nA Pashto poem lavishing praise on Mir Zaman Khan:\n\nخاني ستا په نوم کړي فخر ته يې فخر د خانانو\nتاريخ ستا يادونه ستايي ته يې فخر د ځوانانو \nLordship prides itself on you, you are the pride of lordship\nHistory savors your memories, you are the pride of the young\n\n\n== References ==",

Thus, it is ineligible to elect members of the Electoral College, instead, the territory conducts a non-binding presidential straw poll during the general election. In turn cast direct electoral votes for president and vice president.\nDemocratic Governor Bill Clinton won the straw poll by almost 59.2%.\n\n\n== Results ==\nThe votes of Guam residents didn't count in this November presidential election, but the territory nonetheless conducts a presidential straw poll to gauge islanders' preference for president every election year.

        "content": "Vishegrad (Bulgarian: Вишеград) is a medieval fortress in the Rhodope Mountains of southern Bulgaria rising over a promontory in the valley of the river Arda. About one kilometer south on another hill lie the ruins of an ancient Thracian fort. Its name means High Town.\n\n\n== Location ==\n\nVishegrad is located on a 306 m height rising on the right bank of the river Arda over the modern Studen Kladenets Reservoir. It lies in Kardzhali Province just north of the village of Vishegrad and 2 km east from the town of Kardzhali. From Vishegrad there is an excellent visibility towards the larger Monyak Fortress (587 m) on the left bank of the Arda some 4.5 km to the east, as well as to the fortress of the medieval Monastery of John the Precursor 2.5 km to the west. Both Vishegrad and Monyak and were likely constructed to the protect the region around the mouth of the river Varbitsa, which was part of the secondary road between the major cities of Philippopolis and Adrianople. The Thracian fortress is situated on the 369 m elevation of Harman Kaya a kilometer south. The two fortresses and the village are located on a curved slightly elevated line connected by natural saddles with a gentle slope to the river.\n\n\n== Thracian fortress ==\nThe Thracian fortress on Harman Kaya had its origins in period between the Bronze Age and the Early Iron Age (1200–1100 BC), as evidenced by the earliest dated artifacts found during excavations. It is assumed that the fortress continued to function throughout Antiquity and the Middle Ages during the First and Second Bulgarian Empires.\nFrom the east, south and west it is only accessible through a few places. The northern side is protected by a wall which has an arched shape, widened at the western end. The fortress walls and its interior were cleared during excavations that were carried out in 1971–1974. The walls are approximately 2 m thick and preserved to a height of 1 m. The masonry is made of rough stones, joined with mud mortar, and in some places the joints are filled with small pebbles and earth. The entrance to the fortress is located at the easternmost end and is about 2 m wide. In several places in the interior, dugout floors and furnace foundations were found. During the excavations fragments of clay vessels, iron implements and weapons were discovered.\n\n\n== Medieval fortress ==\n\nThe medieval Vishgrad Fortress originated from the 4th century AD but all preserved structures date from the Middle Ages. It has common features with the material culture of old Bulgarian cities of the First and Second Empires, such as Pliska, Preslav, Tarnovo, Messembria, etc. The relatively well-preserved citadel was probably the residence of the governor of the medieval region of Achridos. Along with the nearby fortifications of the Monastery of John the Precursor and the adjacent medieval settlement that existed in the 9th–14th century, Vishegrad is considered to be the progenitor of the modern town of Kardzhali. The fortress was destroyed in the aftermath the Bulgarian–Ottoman wars in the 14th century.\nThe fortification is small, occupying an area of 560 m2. The southern wall is 75 m long, 1.75 m wide at the top and is preserved to a height of up to 7 m. The fortress has two rectangular inner towers. One is at the eastern end of the structure. Its dimensions are 9.1x7.5 m, and its walls are 2.3 m thick. Later, a load-bearing wall was built through the middle of the room on the ground floor of the tower, which adjoined the southern wall of the tower with a well-defined joint. The walls are plastered with mortar mixed with broken brick. The ground floor was probably used as a water reservoir. The second tower is located in the middle of the south wall. There was probably a postern next to it. Its dimensions are 6.2x5.5 m, and the walls are 2.2 m thick. In the western half of the northern wall, an external stone staircase has been preserved, which served as an access the second floor of the tower, as the first one was used as a reservoir. \nAt a distance of 5 m from the southern wall, there is a second parallel wall, forming a 51 m long premise, which in later times was divided by transverse walls of broken stones joined with mud. Despite the impenetrable rock massif from the northern side of the hill, a defensive wall was built there as well, with which the fortress was enclosed by walls on all sides. That is the most deteriorated part of the stronghold. The main entrance is from the southeast and was initially 2.5 m wide, later narrowed by a wall to 1.2 m.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== References ==\nГеоргиев (Georgiev), Владимир (Vladimir) (1978).

In that city, in 1883, she won a large gold and silver medal at the Academy of Music. She also studied privately for four years under teachers in New York City and Boston.\nHer notable performances included the \"Curse Scene\", from Leah the Forsaken, and the Malediction of Medea. In 1904, in the Bridgeport Opera House, she produced two of W. S. Gilbert's most successful comedies, viz. : Engaged and Pygmalion and Galatea, which were highly praised by the press. Eugenia Williamson Hume was a pupil.\nShe was also the author of Banks's Recitations with Lesson-Talks. Some of her articles appeared in The Voice while some of her original recitations were reprinted by the British press.\nHer husband was Edgar Granville Banks.\nWhile on Saturdays, she used a New York City address, Banks made her home in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where she died April 8, 1931.\n\n\n== Selected works ==\nEmma Dunning Bank's Original Recitations: With Lesson-talks, 1890 (text)\nFlossie Lane's Marriage, 1890 (text)\nOne Thanksgiving Day Out West, 1908 (text)\nFlying Jim's Last Leap, 1908 (text)\n\n\n== References ==",

The T20I series forms part of both teams' preparation ahead of the 2024 ICC Women's T20 World Cup tournament.\nOriginally, the series was scheduled to be played between July and September in 2023 with three ODIs and three T20Is. However, it postponed due to the 2023 ICC Cricket World Cup in India. The Test wasn’t originally part of the Future Tours Programme (FTP) but the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the Cricket South Africa (CSA) decided to add it to promote Women’s Tests.\n\n\n== ODI series ==\n\n\n=== 1st ODI ===\n\n\n=== 2nd ODI ===\n\n\n=== 3rd ODI ===\n\n\n== Only Test ==\n\n\n== T20I series ==\n\n\n=== 1st T20I ===\n\n\n=== 2nd T20I ===\n\n\n=== 3rd T20I ===\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sofya Aleksandrovna Subbotina (née Iovskaya; Russian: Софья Александровна Субботина; 1830–1919) was a Russian Narodnik revolutionary. The mother of Evgeniia, Maria and Nadezhda Subbotina, she went with her daughters to Zurich, where she joined a number of revolutionary circles. When she returned to Russia, she aided the return of fellow revolutionaries Varvara Batyushkova and Evgeniia Zavadskaya, for which she was given up to the Tsarist authorities. She was charged in the Trial of the 193 and sentenced to exile, which she spent in the regions of the Volga, Urals and Siberia, her sentence extended after she was caught financially supporting other political exiles as a member of Narodnaya Volya. Upon her return from exile, she travelled through European Russia, Poland and Ukraine, where she was kept under close surveillance. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, she returned to her home in Oryol, where she died in 1919.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nSofya Aleksandrovna Iovskaya was born in 1830, in Moscow, the daughter of Aleksandr Iovsky, a professor at the Imperial Moscow University. She grew up and was educated in Moscow. In 1852, she married a landowner, Dmitry Pavlovich Subbotin, with whom she lived on an estate in the village of Podvorgolskoye, in the Oryol province. Sofya herself also owned land in the village of Belomestnoye. Together they had three daughters: Evgeniia, Maria and Nadezhda Subbotina. \nDmitry died shortly after Nadezhda's birth, leaving his children with a considerable inheritance. Sofya endeavoured to provide them with the best possible education, enrolling them at a girls' school in Moscow in 1868. She went abroad with Nadezhda in 1873, settling in Switzerland, where Evgeniia and Maria were attending the University of Zurich. In Zurich, Sofya associated with other Russian emigres, joined a women's circle and attended meetings of the International Workingmen's Association (IWA), before returning to Russia later that year.\nShe invited revolutionary women, who were living in hiding, to teach at schools where she was a trustee. She brought Varvara Batyushkova to Podvorgolskoye and Evgeniia Zavadskaya to Belomestnoye, where they carried out revolutionary propaganda work among the peasantry. She was denounced to the police by a local official and, on 14 September 1874, she was arrested in Belomestnoye and transferred to a prison in Kursk. When the police searched her property over the subsequent days, they found a lot of revolutionary literature. She was then transferred to Saint Petersburg, where she was held in pre-trial detention in the Peter and Paul Fortress. On 5 May 1877, she was finally charged for anti-Tsarist propaganda in the Trial of the 193. As she refused to answer the court's questions, she was removed from the courtroom and kept out while the trial continued for months. On 23 January 1878, she was found guilty of \"uttering hateful words\" and sentenced to eight months of imprisonment. The court approved this sentence on 11 May 1878, under the condition that she remain under police surveillance for three years afterwards.\nOn 19 July 1878, the Minister of Internal Affairs Alexander Timashev ordered that she be deported to the Vyatka Governorate, where she was to be kept under strict surveillance. On 21 November 1878, Timashev's successor Lev Makov granted her permission to move to Kainsk, in the Tomsk Governorate, so she could live with her daughter Nadezhda. She arrived there in March 1879, and in July 1880, she and her daughter moved to Tomsk, where they joined a group that assisted political exiles. In December 1881, she was named on a list of members of Narodnaya Volya; her house was searched, where the authorities found that she had provided money to political exiles. She was arrested on 1 January 1882 and detained until 26 March. She was briefly released before being detained again on 22 July 1882. On 5 October 1883, she was deported to the Yeniseysk Governorate in Siberia for a period of five years, under police surveillance. In 1886, her sentence was extended for two more years. She lived in Minusinsk for the remainder of her exile. She requested to be temporarily allowed to return to Moscow in November 1886, and to move back to Tomsk in March 1887, but her appeals were rejected. \nIn August 1888, her exile ended and she returned to Oryol, where she was kept under surveillance. She moved to Warsaw in 1891, then to Moscow in 1893, and then to Kyiv in 1897. By 1902, she had settled permanently in Odesa, where she would live for many of the last years of her life, and where she remained under police surveillance. After the February Revolution, in April 1917, she returned to Oryol, where she died on 15 February 1919.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==",

        "content": "Yi Ch'ae (Korean: 이채; Hanja: 李采; 1745 – 1820) was a Korean civil official who served the Joseon dynasty during the reigns of King Jeongjo and Sunjo.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nYi Ch'ae was born on 1745 in Goyang, Gyeonggi Province, as the son of censor-general (대사간; 大司諫; taesagan) Yi Che-wŏn (이제원; 李濟遠), of the Ubong Yi clan, and his wife, Lady Hong. His grandfather was Yi Chae (이재; 李濟縡). His family background belonged to the Noron political faction. His art name was Hwach'ŏn and his courtesy name was Kyeryang.\nIn 1774, Yi Ch'ae would pass the literary licentiate examination, and in the following year, he would be appointed to his first government post of assistant caretaker of the Hwiryŏngjŏn (휘령전참봉; 徽寧殿參奉; Hwiryŏngjŏn ch'ambong). He would then go on to serve various positions, such as assistant section chief of the Ministry of Taxation (호조좌랑; 戶曹佐郞; hojo chwarang), an inspector from the Office of the Inspector-General (사헌부 감찰; 司憲府 監察; sahŏnbu kamch'al), section chief of the Ministry of Taxation (호조정랑; 戶曹佐郞; hojo chŏngnang), and recorder of the Royal House Administration (돈녕부 주부; 敦寧府 主簿; tonnyŏngbu chubu). By 1780, he was the magistrate of Eumjuk-hyeon. Due to false allegations against him, he was dismissed from his government post.\nIn 1790, he was able to serve the government once more, being appointed as the magistrate of Jirye-hyeon (in modern-day Gimcheon). When he arrived at Jirye, the flooded Gamcheon river had just damaged the local area. Yi built a dyke to prevent further flooding and to aid the local farmers. In 1800, when King Sunjo ascended to the throne, he was appointed as a guard (위솔; 衛率; wisol) in the Standby Guard for Heir Apparent (세자익위사; 世子翊衛司; seja ikwisa). His final posts in the government would be the deputy minister of the Ministry of Taxation (호조참판; 戶曹參判; hojo ch'ampan) and the second magistrate of Hanseong (한성부좌윤; 漢城府左尹; Hansŏng-bu chwayun). Yi Ch'ae died in 1820, and was buried in Chungju. He was given the posthumous name, Mungyŏng. In 1886, his great-grandson, Yi Ho-ik (이호익; 李鎬翼) would publish his great-grandfather's collected works in the Hwach'ŏnjib.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Shan Sum Columbarium is a 12-story private columbarium located in Hong Kong. The building was designed by German architect Ulrich Kirchhoff. It is a facility that functions as the final resting place.\nThe columbarium was opened in response to the dire shortage of urn spaces in Hong Kong. The city's ageing population and high death rates had pushed the government's urn capacity to its limits, leading to a severe shortage of places to lay its residents to rest. The columbarium was designed to accommodate 23,000 funeral urns, offering a range of options for families to choose from.\nThe basic two-person option starts at $58,000, while the top-tier package can cost up to $3 million. The cost makes it unaffordable for most people.\n\n\n== Design and Features ==\nThe columbarium's design is inspired by traditional Chinese graveyards. Kirchhoff incorporated multiple features like hewn rock texture to evoke a sense of a close-knit neighborhood and the rooms are designed to provide intimacy.\nThe Shan Sum Columbarium offers a range of features and amenities to ensure a serene environment for the departed. The air-conditioned chambers store ashes in ornate compartments.\nThe columbarium also have pocket gardens, dehumidifiers and air-conditioning systems. Families can use an app through which they can pre-book a time slot to visit.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The history of publishing newspapers in Sunnmøre, a region in Møre og Romsdal, Norway, stretches from 1808, and is continuous to the present day. The overarching newspaper in the region is Sunnmørsposten, with a plethora of newspapers covering specific municipalities of the region.\n\n\n== Ørsta and Volda ==\n \nØrsta and Volda were hubs for intellectual life in Western Norway. Sivert Aarflot started Landbobladet in 1808, which was the first rural newspaper in Norway. Published in Volda, Landbobladet changed its name to Postbudet in 1845 and Møringen in 1869, then Møre.\n\n\n== Ålesund ==\nÅlesund, then spelt Aalesund, emerged as the leading city in Sunnmøre. A cooperation between the bookseller J. Aarflot and the printer T. Zernichow led to the trade newspaper Aalesunds Handels og Søfartstidende being started in 1856. For a number of years it was called Aalesunds Tidende, reverting to the old name in 1876. Aalesunds Handels og Søfartstidende succumbed following the Ålesund fire of 1904.\nAalesunds Blad started in 1871 with a more \"free-minded\" outlook. It ceased publication in 1911, having been overtaken by Søndmørsposten. This newspaper had its trial issue on 30 November 1882 and aligned itself with the Liberal Party. Søndmørsposten, which later modernised its name to  Sunnmørsposten, firmly established itself during Ivar Flem's long service as editor-in-chief, starting in 1984 and spanning nearly fifty years.\nThe temperance movement founded Totalavholdsbudet in 1883, succeeded by Søndmøre Folkeblad in 1892. It ceased in 1917, whereas Klaus Sletten tried to establish a successor Møre Tidend which lasted until 1920. At the same time, the Conservative Party managed to start Aalesunds Avis in 1917. The first editor-in-chief was Gerhard Jynge.\n\n\n== Labour press ==\n\nArbeidernes Blad was Ålesund's first newspaper aligned with the labour movement, lasting from January to April 1898. While intending to uphold a non-partisan labourer-friendly editorial style, it soon became more cleary socialist. The editorial team was a four-member committee consisting of Bernhard Riise (chief editor), Erik Pettersen, J. Langseth and Andreas Barstad. The owner of the printing press were pressured by loan providers to waive the printing of the newspaper. Arbeidernes Blad was briefly continued by Møringen.\nThe Ålesund city fire of 1904 led to an influx of labourers to rebuild the city. Petter Moe-Johansen seized the opportunity to become the first editor of Nybrott, which was subsequently edited by Johan Falkberget. Nybrott went defunct in 1907 and was succeeded by Aalesunds Socialdemokrat, which lasted until 1910. The next attempt at publishing Socialisten in 1915 became even more short-lived.\nIn 1921, the new Social Democratic Labour Party managed to found Møre Socialdemokrat. Three years after the Social Democratic Labour Party was incorporated into the Labour Party, the \"Socialdemokrat\" moniker was dropped in 1930 and the title was changed to Sunnmøre Arbeideravis.\nBefore the Labour–Social Democratic Labour merger, Møre Arbeiderblad was started on 13 September 1923 as a newspaper with an unofficial affiliation with the Labour Party. Before the affiliation was made formal, the Communist Party broke away from Labour and took Møre Arbeiderblad with them. It henceforth served as the Communist Party organ for Sunnmøre. Well-known editors include Ålesund native Reinert Torgeirson from 1924 to 1925 and Jens Galaaen from 1925 to 1929. The newspaper came once a week, except a period from early 1924 to mid-1929 when it came twice a week. It went defunct after its last issue on 28 March 1931, and though Møre Arbeiderblad did resurface later, the details around that are little known to historians.\n\n\n== Outskirts of Ålesund ==\nIn Sula south of Ålesund, Sulaposten was founded in 1946. It was edited and printed in Langevåg, but has to find another printing press, and was also defunct between December 1967 and November 1974. Sulaposten gained traction during the campaign to demerge Sula from Ålesund Municipality, which happened in 1977, and managed to survive as a weekly newspaper. The founder Ansgar Slagnes operated on more or less a hobby basis, with slim profits and contributors working without compensation. Shareholders were brought in from 1979, but Slagsnes returned as editor-in-chief from 1983 to 1989, resigning at age 84. Sulaposten was bought by a small consortium Sunnmørsavisene AS in 1997, then Vårt Land before it was bought by Haramsnytt (see below) in 2008. Having surpassed the 2,000 mark with a cirulation of 2,413 in the year 2000, it dropped to 1,988 in 2020.\nIn Haram north of Ålesund, there were three unsuccessful attempts to establish local newspapers. First, Bygdebladet existed from 1931 to 1932. Møre Bygdeblad lasted from 1932 until the German occupation of Norway in 1940 cracked down on the press. The third attempt, Vestland, became short-lived too, lasting from 1952 to 1953. As the population grew, Haramsnytt was established in 1971, changing its name to Nordre in 2013. The newspaper's office is located in the village of Brattvåg. Written in Nynorsk, Nordre is published twice a week, on Tuesdays and Fridays. As Haram Municipality was incorporated into Ålesund in 2020, it was demerged in 2024; the newspaper changed its name back to Haramsnytt on 4 January 2024. The circulation stood at 2,078 copies in 1980, 2,448 copies in 1990, 2,878 copies in 2000 and 2,707 copies in 2010.\nProbably inspired by Nordre, the Ålesund-based journalist Kjell Opsal left his job in 1972 to move operations to Sjøholt in Ørskog, where he started Bygdebladet. The newspaper is written in Nynorsk and is issued on Wednesdays and Saturdays, having tried publishing three days a week in the late 1980s. The circulation stood at 3,046 copies in 1979, 3,295 in 1988, 2,540 in 1998, 2,847 in 2008 and 2,423 in 2018 (then including digital-only subscribers). The large decline after 1988 was in part due to new local newspapers emerging in Vestnes (in Romsdal) and Storfjord, where Bygdebladet had a reader base. Kjell Opsal edited the paper until 2015, when he was succeeded by Reidar Opsal.\nØy-Blikk was established in 1985 by Odd Egil Valderhaug with offices in Valderøy. It is a weekly newspaper appearing on Thursdays, published in Nynorsk. The newspaper was bought by Mediekonsernet Tvisyn in 2019, and the official spelling altered to ØyBlikk in 2023. The circulation stood at 1,838 copies in 2010 and 1,306 copies in 2020.\n\n\n== Ytre Søre Sunnmøre ==\nThe Southern part of Sunnmøre is further divided into Inner and Outer parts, characterized by fjords and islands respectively.\n\n\n== Indre Søre Sunnmøre ==\nIn the southwest along the county border to Sogn og Fjordane, Vanylven Municipality was enlarged through a merger. Seeing a ground for a local newspaper, Per G. Osnes founded Synste Møre in 1970, intitially published out of the Osnes family's farm. After a period under the name Vest-Avisa from 1987 to 2000, they reverted to Synste Møre. The circulation was about 1,500 paper copies in the mid-1970s, rising to 2,097 in 2000. Except for a period around 2,200–2,300 around 2010, the circulation stabilized around 2,000.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Cupaniopsis foveolata, commonly known as narrow-leaved tuckeroo, white tamarind or\ntoothed tuckeroo, is a plant in the maple and lychee family Sapindaceae found in eastern Queensland and New South Wales, Australia.\n\n\n== Description ==\nCupaniopsis foveolata is a tree growing to about 25 m (82 ft) high and 30 cm (12 in) diameter. New growth is covered in fine hairs and twigs have numerous lenticels. The compound leaves can grow to about 28 cm (11 in) long (including the petiole), with 4–8 or 10 leaflets arranged alternately. The leaflets are narrowly elliptic to ovate, obtuse at the base and bluntly accuminate at the tip. They measure up to about 12 cm (4.7 in) long and 2.5 cm (0.98 in) wide with scalloped margins.\nThe inflorescences are panicles produced either terminally, from the leaf axils or directly from the old wood of the branches. They are held erect and measure about 10 cm (3.9 in) wide and long. They carry numerous cream-coloured flowers of about 6 mm (0.24 in) diameter held on pedicels up to 4 mm (0.16 in) long. The calyx is five-lobed, there are five sessile, hairy petals about 2 mm (0.08 in) long, and there are eight stamens. The ovary is 3-locular with one ovule per locule, the stigma is persitant.\nThe fruit is a yellow/orange 3-segmented capsule up to 25 mm (0.98 in) wide, broadest at the apex (i.e. the furthest point from the attachment to the branch). It is glabrous outside and finely hairy on the inner surfaces. Each segment contains a single black ellipsoid seed that is mostly enclosed within a yellow aril.\n\n\n=== Phenology ===\nFlowering occurs from May to September, and fruit appear from December to January.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThis species was first described as Cupania foveolata by the German-Australian botanist Ferdinand von Mueller. His description was based on material collected near the Macleay River in New South Wales, and also from Rockingham Bay in Queensland, and it was published in his book Fragmenta phytographiæ Australiæ in 1875. In 1879 the German botanist Ludwig Radlkofer created the genus Cupaniopsis to accommodate species from the Asia-Pacific region, and he transferred this species into the new genus.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nThe natural range of this tree is the northeastern coastal regions of Queensland from the McIlwraith Range on Cape York Peninsula, southwards to the area around Mackay. It grows as an understorey tree in rainforest on a variety of soils.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\nThe seeds are eaten by a number of birds including figbirds (Sphecotheres vieilloti), spotted catbirds (Ailuroedus maculosus), and graceful honeyeaters (Microptilotis gracilis).\n\n\n== Conservation ==\nThis species is listed as least concern under the Queensland Government's Nature Conservation Act, and also by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nView a map of herbarium collections of this species at the Australasian Virtual Herbarium\nView observations of this species on iNaturalist\nView images of this species on Flickriver.com",

        "content": "Al-Awhad (Arabic: الاوحد, lit. 'the Unique One, the Unparalleled One') was the eldest son of the Fatimid vizier and quasi-sultan, Badr al-Jamali (r. 1073–1094). When his father left Acre in 1073 to take power in Egypt, al-Awhad with his mother and siblings were left behind in the city, which shortly after fell to a Turkoman chieftain, Şöglü. While the Turkoman ruler of Damascus, Atsiz ibn Uwaq, demanded their handover, Şöglü, aiming to secure Badr's favour in his rivalry with Atsiz, eventually sent them to Egypt. In Egypt, al-Awhad was appointed governor of Alexandria soon after, being in office by 1076.\nRemoved from his father's court in Cairo, al-Awhad fell under the influence of an officer whose relatives had been killed during Badr's purges while the latter consolidated his power over Egypt. Al-Awhad's behaviour awoke his father's distrust, and envoys, including his half-brother al-Afdal, were sent to Alexandria to persuade him to change his stance. These attempts failed, leading to the siege of Alexandria by Badr's forces in spring 1084. The city capitulated and al-Awhad surrendered to his father, who took him with him to Cairo. Badr also appointed his younger son al-Afdal in al-Awhad's place as heir apparent. Soon new rumours reached Badr that al-Awhad was conspiring to assassinate him; al-Awhad was imprisoned and the rest of his co-conspirators executed. Finally, on 29 August 1087 al-Awhad was executed by strangulation, possibly to prevent another plot that aimed to liberate him.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\nHalm, Heinz (2014).

        "content": "Shmiras Halashon (guarding the tongue) is a practice in Judaism that is said to promote the quality of life and help combat and reduce Lashon Hara (evil tongue). It is a part of Jewish ethics commonly known as mussar. King David once said, \"He who loves life and would like to see good days, let him guard his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking deceit.\" King Solomon goes on to say, \"Whoever guards his mouth and tongue guards himself from trouble.\"\nThough the concepts and practice of Shmiras Halashon is found all through ancient Jewish writings, the modern practice was birthed and popularised by Rabbi Yisrael Meir Kagan who is well known as Chofetz Chaim.\n\n\n== History and folklore ==\nThe first sin according to Torah is the serpent speaking evil about God and not practicing Shmiras Halashon which led to Eve being deceived bringing death.\nJoseph spoke negatively to his father, Jacob, about his brothers, causing them to hate him. This led to their selling him, and ultimately caused the Egyptian exile.\nThe difficult slavery in Egypt is attributed to talebearers amongst the people and not guarding their tongue.\nThe slander of Doeg, King Saul’s chief shepherd and the head of the Sanhedrin, caused the massacre of nearly an entire city.\nThe armies of King Saul lost their battles with the Philistines as a result of the slander that people spoke against (then future) King David.\nThe armies of the notorious king Ahab were successful in their battles, despite the fact that they were idolatrous, because they guarded their tongue.\nThe destruction of the Second Temple is attributed to not being careful about Shmiras Halashon. The redemption and peace of the people is connected to being careful about Shmiras Halashon.\n\n\n== Torah Commandments ==\nShmiras Halashon is divided into 31 Torah commandments which need to be observed.\n\n17 things not to do (negative commandments)\n14 things to do (positive commandments)\n4 curses that you get yourself out of (curses)\nKeeping these commandments are said to increase one's happiness and quality of life and being careless in this area is said to cause destruction.\n\n\n=== Negative commandments ===\nYou shall not go as a slanderer among your people; nor shall you stand against the blood of your neighbor; I am the Lord. (Vayikra 19:16)\nYou shall not raise a false report (Shemot 23:1)\nTake heed concerning the plague of leprosy. Leprosy came as a punishment for Lashon Hara. (Devarim 24:8)\nYou shall not curse the deaf, nor put a stumbling block before the blind, but shall fear your G-d; I am the Lord. This is when you cause another one to sin as when you engage in evil talk. (Vayikra 19:14)\n\n\n=== Positive commandments ===\nRemember what the Lord your G-d did to Miriam by the way, after you came out of Egypt”. We are commanded to remember that Hashem punished Miriam for speaking against Moshe. (Devarim 24:9)\nAnd you shall love your neighbor as yourself; I am the Lord”. When you love someone you don't talk evil about anyone. (Vayikra 19:18)\nYou shall do no unrighteousness in judgment...but in righteousness shall you judge your neighbor. This verse exhorts us to give the benefit of the doubt when judging our fellowmen. (Vayikra 19:15)\nAnd if your brother has become poor, and his means fail with you; then you shall relieve him; though he may be a stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with you. If you say something and as a consequence someone is hurt financially you transgress this command. (Vayikra 25:35)\n\n\n=== Curses ===\nCursed be the one who hits his friend in secret. Anyone who does not watch his mouth does just this, he hits his friend behind his back, in secret.  (Devarim 27:24)\nCursed be the one who confounds the blind on the road. By making others [The innocent listeners] transgress the commandments of Shmiras Halashon you make them sin. (Devarim 27:18)\nCursed be the one who will not establish the words of this Torah in order to do them. If a person habitually does not bother about God's commandments, he is the habit of repeating the transgression of constantly. (Devarim 27:26)\nCursed be the one who hits his father or his mother. This forbids the speaking ill about one's father or mother. (Devarim 27:16)\n\n\n== Modern application ==\nThe concept of guarding one's tongue works in a family or corporate setting and is proven to increase peace and happiness.\n\n\n== References ==",

It culminated in the first-ever life imprisonment without the possibility of parole sentence in New Zealand history.\n\n\n== Sentencing ==\n\nSentencing began on 24 August 2020 before Justice Cameron Mander at the Christchurch High Court, and it was televised. Tarrant did not oppose the sentence proposed and declined to address the court. The Crown prosecutors demonstrated to the court how Tarrant had meticulously planned the two shootings and more attacks, while numerous survivors and their relatives gave victim impact statements, which were covered by national and international media. Tarrant was then sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for each of the 51 murders, and life imprisonment for engaging in a terrorist act and 40 attempted murders. The sentence is New Zealand's first terrorism conviction. It was also the first time that life imprisonment without parole, the maximum sentence available in New Zealand, had been imposed. Mander said Tarrant's crimes were \"so wicked that even if you are detained until you die, it will not exhaust the requirements of punishment and denunciation.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Notes ==",

        "content": "Koktinkoli (Kazakh: Көктіңкөлі; Russian: Коктинколи) is a lake in Shet District, Karaganda Region, Kazakhstan.\nZhanaarka, former Atasu, is located 35 kilometers (22 mi) to the northwest of the lake, and Koktinkoli station 5 kilometers (3.1 mi) to the northeast of the northern lakeshore. The border with Ulytau Region lies 6 kilometers (3.7 mi) to the west of the western lakeshore. \n\n\n== Geography ==\nKoktinkoli is an exorheic lake in the Sarysu basin. River Zhaman Sarysu flows into the lake from the northeast and flows out of it from the north. The lake is roughly triangular-shaped, with its vertex in the north. The western shore is steep, lined with cliffs up to 2 meters (6 ft 7 in) high, and consists of gray sandstone mixed with clay. The remaining stretches of the lakeshore are flat and clayey. An earthen dam was built to regulate the water level at the northern and northeastern end, where the river flows in and out. Lake Shoshkakol lies 120 kilometers (75 mi) to the northwest. \nThe lake freezes in November and stays under ice until April. Koktinkoli does not dry in the summer, but its level fluctuates around 1.5 meters (4 ft 11 in) yearly, depending on the inflow of river Zhaman Sarysu. The lake water is hard and slightly saline, with a mineralization of 4.2 grams per liter (0.67 oz/imp gal).\n\n\n== Flora and fauna ==\nThe lake is surrounded by highland steppe. Reeds cover some stretches of the lakeshore. Sedges, wormwood, fescue and feathergrass grow near the banks.\nAmong the fishes living in the lake, the crucian carp, perch, bream and pike deserve mention.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of lakes of Kazakhstan\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Koktinkoli at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "Sasang (Korean: 사상구) is a constituency of the National Assembly of South Korea. The constituency consists of Sasang District, Busan. As of 2024, 181,823 eligible voters were registered in the constituency. The constituency was created in 2000 after the consolidation of the Sasang A and Sasang B constituencies.\n\n\n== History ==\nSasang, like the majority of constituencies located in the Busan–Gyeongnam Area is widely considered a stronghold for the conservative People Power Party. Accordingly, the constituency has consistently elected members of conservative political parties and allied independents, with the only exception being in 2012 when Moon Jae-in of the liberal Democratic United Party was elected.\nKwon Chul-hyun of the conservative Grand National Party was the first member to represent the constituency. He won re-election in 2004, but was \"cut-off\" from being re-nominated in 2008. He was succeeded by Chang Je-won, the son of former Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly of South Korea Chang Sŏng-man. Chang did not run for re-election in 2012 due to a bribery scandal, and the Saenuri Party nominated Son Su-jo as the party's candidate for Sasang. Moon Jae-in of the liberal Democratic United Party defeated Son in the general election, marking the only time a member of a centre-left, liberal party won in the constituency. Moon led an unsuccessful presidential campaign in the 2012 South Korean presidential election and remained as the member of the National Assembly for Sasang. Moon did not run for re-election and was succeeded by the constituency's former member Chang Je-won. Chang, who ran as an independent candidate, garnered 37.5% of the vote and narrowly beat out Democratic opponent Bae Jae-jung in a three-way race. Chang won re-election in 2020 with 52.03% of the vote, once again defeating Bae Jae-jung of the Democratic Party. Ahead of the 2024 South Korean legislative election, Chang announced that he would not stand for re-election. The People Power Party nominated Kim Dae-sik, who went on to win the general election; Bae Jae-jung marked her third consecutive loss in Sasang.\n\n\n== Boundaries ==\nThe constituency encompasses the entirety of Sasang District, Busan. It borders the constituencies of Seo–Dong to the southeast, Saha A to the south, Busanjin A and Busanjin B to the east, Buk A to the north, and Gangseo to the west.\n\n\n== List of members in the National Assembly ==\n\n\n== Election results ==\n\n\n=== 2024 ===\n\n\n=== 2020 ===\n\n\n=== 2016 ===\n\n\n=== 2012 ===\n\n\n=== 2008 ===\n\n\n=== 2004 ===\n\n\n=== 2000 ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of constituencies of the National Assembly of South Korea\n\n\n== References ==",

He is the founder of List of political parties in Hong Kong League of Social Democrats . He later withdrew from the League of Social Democrats due to disagreements with Wong Yuk-man, becoming a Pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong) independent. Regarding the issue of how the church participates in politics, he believes that Christians should use the influence of the church to engage in dialogue with governments, politicians, and political groups and even engage in formal and practical political participation through confrontation. He left the mainstream church to serve and instead led social movements due to his opposition to the mainstream evangelical stance on homosexuality issues in Hong Kong. Chen Shiqi is also a consultant and organizer for many Hong Kong LGBTQ organizations and the Christ Road Church. Pastor Leung Chun Pei of the church also pointed out that he has conducted in-depth research on the LGBTQ community in Hong Kong for many years, supporting LGBTQ individuals in defending their rights and legalizing same-sex marriage.

        "content": "Local elections will be held in most cities and municipalities in Serbia (excluding the disputed territory of Kosovo) on 2 June 2024. \nInitially, the Serbian government planned to hold a a local election only for the City Assembly of Belgrade on 2 June, with the other local elections taking place later in the year. The Belgrade vote was required due to the city assembly's failure to constitute itself after the 2023 Belgrade City Assembly election, while the other elections were scheduled to take place in accordance with Serbia's regular local electoral cycle. Ana Brnabić, the president of the national assembly, contended that holding all local elections on 2 June would require a change in Serbia's law on local elections and would unfairly restrict the mandate of those elected in the last regular local election cycle in 2020. Following extended controversy, however, the law was amended on 23 April and local elections were announced for various cities and municipalities on 26 April.\nSerbia's governing Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) and its allies will be participating fully in the elections. The opposition parties are divided on their strategy. Among the parties of the Serbia Against Violence (SPN) coalition, the Party of Freedom and Justice (SSP), Serbia Centre (SRCE), and Together (Zajedno) have announced a boycott in most jurisdictions, stating that no adequate guarantees have been provided that the elections will be free and fair and that there is insufficient time for the situation to change. \nAs against this, the People's Movement of Serbia (NPS), the Green–Left Front (ZLF), the Movement of Free Citizens (PSG), Ecological Uprising (EU), and the New Face of Serbia (NLS) have indicated will participate in the vote. Although the Democratic Party (DS) voted in favour of a boycott, it also decided to adopt the position of the majority of the opposition parties, and on that basis it will be participating in the election as well. Outside the SPN coalition, the parties of the National Democratic Alliance (NADA) alliance will be boycotting the elections in most jurisdictions. Other opposition parties, including Dveri, will be participating.\nOn 26 April 2024, SSP leader Dragan Đilas said that although his party would be boycotting the election in most jurisdictions, it would not discourage Serbian citizens from voting.\nWith the exception of Belgrade, the cities and municipalities of Serbia that held off-year local elections in 2021, 2022, and 2023 will not be participating in the 2024 vote.\nAll local elections in Serbia are held under proportional representation. Mayors are not directly elected but are instead chosen by elected members of the local assemblies. The electoral threshold for assembly representation is three per cent (of all votes, not only of valid votes), although parties representing national minority communities are exempt from this requirement.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "ICUBE-Q or ICUBE-QAMAR (Urdu: آئی کیوب-قمر) is a lunar remote sensing observation nanosatellite and is one of the four international payloads of the Chang'e 6 lunar sample-return mission. It is a joint venture between the Institute of Space Technology (IST), Space & Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO) and the Intelligent Satellite Technology Center of Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), under the framework of Asia-Pacific Space Cooperation Organization (APSCO). It is the first deep space mission of Pakistan.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nIn 2019, the China National Space Administration (CNSA) announced an opportunities for payloads in its upcoming lunar sample-return mission of Chang'e 6, the space agency had a slot for payloads weighing less than 10 kg in its orbiting spacecraft. The CNSA has announced in 2022 that it will carry scientific instruments from France, Italy and Sweden on the Chang'e-6 mission's lander along with a Pakistani payload on the orbiter. Pakistan's Institute of Space Technology (IST) had answered the call with a proposal for a lunar CubeSat named \"ICUBE-Qamar\" (ICUBE-Q) and it was selected after a rigorous evaluation. The design and development of ICUBE-Q was a collaborative effort between Institute of Space Technology (IST), Pakistan's national space agency SUPARCO, and China's Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). IST has been developing several CubeSat in the same series of which iCube-1 was successfully launched in 2013.\nThe Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Aeronautics and Astronautics developed the satellite in its Intelligent Satellite Technology Center. The satellite called by them as \"SJTU Siyuan 2\" had to integrate multiple functions within limited space and mass, including energy supply, communication systems and the scientific experiment equipment. To overcome the gravitational disturbances, strong radiation expostures, temperature fluctuations and threat of lunar dust, the spacecraft was incorporated with multi-sensor fusion technology, multi-layer shielding and advanced thermal control technology to ensure its stable operation. SJTU had previously launched its first student satellite APSCO-SSS-2A (SJTU Siyuan 1) in collaboration with IST in October 2021.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe overall project consists of three main parts: the satellite itself, the separation mechanism (which includes the power control box) and the mounting bracket. The on-orbit fault diagnosis algorithm enables the satellite to automatically detect and diagnose possible system faults. The spacecraft also features intelligent task scheduling strategy.\n\nDesign Life: 3 months (planned).\nMass: The entire satellite weighs only 6.5 kg (14 lb) and the total carrying weight reaches 9.0 kg (19.8 lb).\nCommunication: X band for TT&C and image data transfer at a data rate of 1 kbit/s.\nPower: 12 V, 11.6 Ah Battery (139.2 watts) with two deployable solar panels.\nAttitude Control: Three axis control using reaction wheels, star sensor and Sun sensors.\nTemperature Control: Thermal management systems\nPayload: 2 Visible light cameras of one mega pixel resolution (1280 × 720) mounted on opposite (+/-) X panels.\nBuilt Material: Incorporates advanced materials such as special magnesium alloy and honeycomb carbon fiber.\n\n\n== Mission summary ==\nICUBE-Q was integrated with Chang'e 6 orbiter after successful qualification tests at SUPARCO and SJTU. On 3 May 2024 the satellite was launched on Long March 5 Y8 rocket from Wenchang Space Launch Site.\nThe satellite was deployed from the Chang'e 6 lunar orbiter stack in at 08:14 UTC, (13:14 PKT) on 8 May 2024 and will undergo testing for the first few days with the first images being expected around 15-16 May 2024.\nThe mission objectives include obtaining detailed images of the lunar surface and conducting intelligent on-orbit data processing of images, obtaining lunar magnetic field data and establish lunar magnetic field model and verifying new technologies such as nanosatellite-level deep space lunar-ground communications and low-cost deep space exploration  based on micro-nano satellites.\nThe satellite transmitted its first images on 11th May 2024 captured from a distance of 200 kilometres from the Moon.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Reinaldo Alcides Carballo Carballo (born 9 May 1952) is a Salvadoran politician, businessman, and electrical engineer. He has served as a deputy of the Legislative Assembly since 2018. As a deputy of the Legislative Assembly, he is serving as the legislature's third secretary; from 2021 to 2024, he served as the its fourth secretary. Before becoming a politician, Carballo established several companies and education institutes.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nReinaldo Alcides Carballo Carballo was born on 9 May 1952 in Chapeltique, El Salvador. He studied electrical engineering at the Ricaldone Technical Institute in San Salvador, El Salvador and completed his Bachelor's Degree in Electrical Engineering at the Atlantic International University in Honolulu, Hawaii.\n\n\n== Business career ==\nCarballo has founded five companies: the Exsal Industrial Electromanic Workshop (1975); the Concentrated Animal Food Factory (1979); the Carballo Family Industry and Service Company, S.A. de C.V. (1984); the Reinaldo Alcides Carballo Investment and Development Company (1994); and Export Wood and Furniture (2001). He has also founded four education institutes: the Salesian Alumni Technical Institute (1981), the Exsal Catholic School Center (1990); the Bilingual Technical Higher School in Aircraft Maintenance (2013); Bilingual Technical Higher School in Maritime Careers (2016).\nCarballo initially founded the Salesian Alumni Technical Institute to provide an education to his employees after one of his workers wanted to establish his own companies but that he did not have the education or resources to do so. According to Carballo, his education institutes donate a combined US$400,000 to 500,000 to scholarships to support impoverished Salvadorans from kindergarten to high school.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nCarballo was elected as a deputy of the Legislative Assembly of El Salvador from the department of San Miguel during the 2018 legislative election. He has two mottoes: \"the only tool to escape poverty, is education\" (\"la única herramienta para salir de la pobreza, es la educación\") and \"no to corruption, yes to education\" (\"no a la corrupción, sí a la educación\"). During the 2019 presidential election, Carballo supported the candidacy of Nayib Bukele of the Grand Alliance for National Unity (GANA); Bukele won the election. In 2024, Carballo stated that he was almost expelled from the PDC for supporting Bukele's presidential election campaign. He also claimed that he and Juan José Martel, a deputy from Democratic Change, were the only two deputies of the 12th Legislative Assembly (2018–2021) to support Bukele's government. Carballo voted in favor of funding Bukele's anti-gang initiative known as the Territorial Control Plan.: 10 \nCarballo was re-elected as a deputy of the Legislative Assembly during the 2021 legislative election. He was the only member of the PDC in the Legislative Assembly. Mario Miguel Espinal Rosales was elected as Carballo's supplement deputy. On 1 May 2021, Carballo was elected as the fourth secretary of the Legislative Assembly. On 7 May, he became the chairman of the Legislative Assembly's education and culture commission. Carballo was also a member of the agriculture commission; the politics commission; the treasury and special budget commission; and the youth and sports commission. During Carballo's second term, he continued to support Bukele's government and was officially a part of the ruling government coalition consisting of Nuevas Ideas (the political party Bukele established), GANA, the National Coalition Party, and the PDC. On 1 May, Carballo voted in favor of removing Raúl Melara (the attorney general) and the five justices of the Supreme Court's Constitution Chamber from their positions, however, the PDC condemned the removals on Twitter.: 10  Carballo also supported the Salvadoran gang crackdown and stated that repealing the state of emergency which made the crackdown possible would mean \"return[ing] to the violent statistics of the past\" (\"regresar a los índices de violencia del pasado\").\nOn 16 October 2021, Carballo was elected unopposed as the secretary-general of the Christian Democratic Party, succeeding Rodolfo Parker after serving as the party's leader for 19 years. Carballo announced that he would initiate in audit into the party's functions and that he would consider expelling Parker from the party for alleged breaches of the party's statutes. Carballo also affirmed that the PDC supported Bukele's government, and that Parker was the only part of the party which opposed Bukele. The Supreme Electoral Court (TSE) recognized Carballo's leadership of the PDC on 26 October.\nDuring the 2024 general election, Carballo won 46,510 marks and was re-elected as a deputy of the Legislative Assembly. He remained the only member of the PDC in the Legislative Assembly. Additionally, Espinal was re-elected as Carballo's supplement deputy. After Carballo's re-election, he reaffirmed that he would support Bukele's government in the Legislative Assembly and that he had always supported Bukele's policies. On 1 May 2024, Carballo was elected as the third secretary of the Legislative Assembly with 57 of 60 votes in favor.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nAccording to the Gato Encerrado magazine, Carballo had a net worth of US$3,191,254 as of November 2022, making him the wealthiest member of the Legislative Assembly.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"Reynaldo Carballo, Político y Empresario\" [Reynaldo Carballo, Politician and Businessman].

        "content": "Rima Hassan (Arabic: ريما حسان) is a French-Palestinian jurist, human rights activist and politician born on April 28, 1992, in the Palestinian refugee camp of Neirab, near Aleppo, Syria.\nStateless, she arrived in France around the age of nine and settled with her family in Niort. After obtaining French nationality upon reaching adulthood, she earned a master's degree in international law from Panthéon-Sorbonne University. \nHassan then founded, in 2019, the 'Refugee Camps Observatory', an NGO dedicated to the study and protection of refugee camps worldwide. In 2023, she founded the 'Action Palestine France' collective. That same year, she joined La France Insoumise in preparation for the 2024 European parliament election.\n\n\n== Family and origins ==\nRima Hassan Mobarak was born on April 28, 1992, in the Neirab camp, near Aleppo, Syria.\nShe is the youngest of six children. Her mother, Nabiha (1958-2021), was a teacher, while her father is a former mechanic in the Syrian Air Force named Ahmad. Her father's parents, Palestinians originally from the village of Al-Birwa, were forced into exile to Syria during the creation of Israel in May 1948, during the Nakba.\nHer maternal grandmother, on the other hand, came from a prominent Syrian family, the Hananu. She married a Palestinian refugee from Salfit. Because of her notable status and his being a Palestinian communist refugee, she chose to forsake her heritage and settle with him in the camp. \n\n\n== Youth and studies ==\nDue to the unhappy marriage and an abusive relationship between her parents, her mother left the camp shortly after her birth and managed to immigrate to France, where she reunited with one of her sisters. She then spent eight years attempting to regain custody of her children and transfer them to France.\nShe ultimately managed to do it and Rima Hassan arrived in France around the age of nine. She settled in Niort, in the Deux-Sèvres region, with her mother, sister and four brothers. She was elected to the children's municipal council in 2003, in Niort. She studied there at Ernest Pérochon Primary School. During this time, her mother did not work as a teacher, her original profession, but instead worked in restaurants to support her family. Hassan was targeted by hate speech during her schooling, including being called ethnic slurs like 'bougnoule' (wog) by her classmates. This led to a progressive loss of her native language, Arabic. She obtained a scientific baccalaureate from La Venise Verte High School in 2011.\nStateless until her adulthood, she obtained French nationality in 2010. As soon as she reached the age of majority, she sought to travel to Palestine via Tel Aviv, intending to \"finally discover the land of her ancestors\", but she was prevented from boarding at Charles de Gaulle Airport.\nAfter these events, she pursued studies in law and obtained her bachelor's degree. For this, she spent two years at the University of Évry, then one year at the University of Montpellier, until 2014. She spent a year in Lebanon and completed her master's degree in 2016 at Panthéon-Sorbonne University (Paris 1). She focused on the legal comparison between South Africa and Israel in a master's thesis in international law on the issue of apartheid.\nAccording to her, obtaining her degree from Panthéon-Sorbonne was a source of great pride for her mother because the university's reputation would have been known even in the Neirab camp.\n\n\n== Work ==\nRima Hassan joined the French Office for the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons (OFPRA) in 2016, and after 18 months, she worked at the National Court of Asylum Law for six years until 2023. In 2019, she founded the NGO 'Refugee Camps Observatory'. The following year, Hassan participated in a roundtable organized by Emmaus for the World Refugee Day, on June 20th.\nIn 2022, the Interministerial Delegation for Reception and Integration dedicated a portrait to her as an \"Inspirational Woman\". That same year, she revisited the notion of \"fraternity\" from the French national motto in a podcast, along with other participants.\nOn February 3, 2023, she spoke at the French Senate for the symposium \"Israel-Palestine: State of Affairs\" organized by Paris Senator Esther Benbassa, in collaboration with L'Histoire and the French Research Center in Jerusalem. Her intervention addressed the issue of apartheid in Israeli society.\nFollowing the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, amid the bombing of the Gaza Strip and the ground offensive launched by Israel, she terminated her contract with the National Court of Asylum Law and declined an advocacy position on migration issues offered by Amnesty International. Instead, she moved to the Palestinian refugee camp of al-Nayrab, near Aleppo, \"to be close to her people\" and established the Action Palestine France collective on Telegram.\nUntil November 2023, she also advised L'Oréal on diversity and refugee integration issues.\n\n\n== Political actions ==\nIn August 2023, she participated in the summer days organized by The Ecologists, alongside the rapper Médine or the politician Clémentine Autain.\nIn the 2024 European elections, Rima Hassan joined the list of La France Insoumise (LFI), where she was placed seventh, after also being approached to be on the list of The Greens but in a non-eligible position.\nShe explains her political commitment to LFI's list by the \"urgent need to act politically now\" regarding the situation in Gaza Strip.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Toka Diagana (also published as Tocka Diagana) is a Mauritanian-American mathematician, a professor of mathematics and chair of mathematics at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, and the editor-in-chief of the journal Nonautonomous Dynamical Systems. The topics of his research include functional analysis, stochastic processes, differential equations, dynamical systems, and operator theory.\n\n\n== Education and career ==\nDiagana is originally from Kaédi, in southern Mauritania, a country in Northwest Africa. After attending a top high school in Kaédi, he went north to Tunisia for undergraduate studies at the Faculté des sciences de Tunis of Tunis El Manar University. There, his interests in mathematical analysis and topology were sparked by Abdenabi Achour and Said Zarati. At the suggestion of Achour, he traveled to France for doctoral study in mathematics, at Claude Bernard University Lyon 1. He earned a diploma of advanced studies (master's degree) there in 1995, and completed his Ph.D. in 1999, under the direction of Jean-Bernard Baillon, also working in Lyon with Étienne Ghys.\nAfter a brief stint as a secondary school teacher in Thoissey, France, Diagana came to Howard University in the US as a lecturer in 2000, and obtained an assistant professorship there in 2002. He was quickly promoted to associate professor in 2004, and then to full professor in 2007. He moved to his present position as professor and chair at the University of Alabama in Huntsville in 2018.\n\n\n== Contributions ==\nDiagana founded the African Diaspora Journal of Mathematics, and is the editor-in-chief of the journal Nonautonomous Dynamical Systems.\nHis 13 authored and edited books include both mathematical monographs and multiple compilations of mathematics from researchers of the African diaspora.\nDespite many academic publications, in a profile on Mathematically Gifted & Black, he describes his greatest accomplishment as his mentorship of eight African Americans to doctorates in mathematics, including two women, countering the historic underrepresentation of people from these groups in mathematics.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nDiagana is a 2006 recipient of the Prix Chinguitt, a Mauritanian national prize given annually for excellence in science research. He is a Fellow of the African Academy of Sciences, elected in 2009.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHome page\nToka Diagana publications indexed by Google Scholar",

        "content": "Russia As It Is is a 1882 Australian play by F. R. C. Hopkins based on the Jules Verne novel Michael Strogoff. It was produced by Alfred Dampier. \nHopkins wrote the adaptation in 1877. Among his changes were adding Australian journalist characters.\nLeslie Rees wrote \"Was such a play merely verbal carpentry so far as Hopkins’s contribution went, mere rearrangement of someone else’s materials? Not altogether, if we may trust some of the contemporary critics.\" \nThe Riverine Herald said \"it is not a play with an attractive story, nor is it a good acting drama.\"\nThe Weekly Times called it a \"tissue of rubbish\".\nThe Age said the story \"has been covered up by superficial layers of nonsensical\nrubbish that the original is hardly recognisable. The adapter of tho original should\nle prosecuted for literary murder as well as piracy...  The play has had a witless, pointless, aimless farce of tho most vapid order grafted on it, like a patch on the cheek of beauty, and the result is far from legitimate.\" This review prompted a spirited reply from Dampier.\n\n\n== References ==",

It was the only air to air engagement between Soviet and Iranian forces in the Soviet Afghan war that took place inside Afghanistan.\n\n\n== Background ==\nDuring the Soviet Afghan war , Iran supported the Shia Mujahideen, namely the Persian speaking Shiite Hazaras. One of these groups was the Tehran Eight, a political union of Afghan Shi'a. They were supplied predominately by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. This further strained the already tense relations between Soviet union and Iran.\n\n\n== Shootdown ==\nOn 26 September 1988 two Iranian Air force Bell AH-1 SuperCobras intruded into Afghan airspace southeast of Shindand, Herat Province. Two Soviet MiG-23ML of the 120th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment piloted by B.Gavrilov and V.Astakhov were dispatched. The Migs fired R-24 missiles at the Bell AH-1 SuperCobra, both SuperCobras were shot down killing at least 3 personnel on board.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThis shootdown was the last air to air shootdown by Soviets in the Soviet Afghan war. Soon after the Soviets retreated from Afghanistan. Tehran Eight also attacked Soviet forces more frequently after the incident.\n\n\n== References ==",

Seasons in which the Elite Giants were league members (or an associate team), only games that counted in official league standings are included. Seasons in which they had no league membership and played an independent/barnstorming schedule include games against primarily major-league-caliber teams.\nContemporary coverage of games and won-loss standings was spotty and inconsistent.  On-going research continuously discovers unreported or misreported games, while some games are probably lost forever.  Therefore, Negro league seasonal finishes will likely remain incomplete and subjective.\n\n\n== Year by year ==\n\nKey\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Rex John Willing (25 March 1923 – 23 September 2000) was a New Zealand public servant and politician who was the private secretary to Prime Minister Norman Kirk.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life and career ===\nWilling was born in 1923 to Thomas Elwin and Alice Mona Willing. In 1947 he married Marie Frisk and lived together in Elsdon, north of Wellington. He worked in the public service successively for the Department of Statistics, Department of Industries and Commerce and Consumers Institute.\n\n\n=== Political career ===\nIn 1966, Willing became assistant secretary to Norman Kirk, who was then the Leader of the Opposition. He worked under Malcolm McNamara, who was Kirk's private secretary. At the time the Leader of the Opposition had no research office, so Willing started a makeshift one with Margaret Hayward that served the entire parliamentary caucus and a personal research system for Kirk. A formal research office was later established in 1971. McNamara was a different personality to Kirk as an academic and active Christian, both traits which Kirk mistrusted. Willing was more working class and the two got along well personally. When McNamara tendered his resignation (which he assumed would not be accepted) Kirk made no hesitation in promoting Willing to replace him.\nAt the 1968 local-body elections, Willing was elected a member of the Porirua City Council on the Labour Party ticket. He served as a councillor until 1974 when he did not seek re-election.\nIn the 1969 election, Willing and Margaret Hayward served as speech writers for Kirk and ensured he had a more consistent policy message than previous elections which contributed to a rise in support. During the 1972 election campaign Willing went through the National Party's estimates of Labour's election pledges and found them to be exaggerated, with inflated figures in National's costing estimates. This became an attack line against National in Labour's campaign. Unsure if he would retain a job working for Kirk after Labour won the 1972 election (staff for the parliamentary opposition were employed by the Legislative Department not the Labour Party), Willing planned to transfer to the Department of Trade & Industry. However Kirk made arrangements to have him employed in the office of the Prime Minister. He later shared an office with Hayward at the beehive from 1972 to 1974. He travelled with Kirk on the road when he attended events and conferences, taping speeches and then typing up transcripts of them for publication. This included accompanying Kirk on his overseas trip to Asia and Australia in December 1973 and January 1974. Whilst in Singapore He and Kirk went swimming in a luxury swimming pool at the Shangri-La Hotel where he almost drowned and had to be rescued by Kirk. He worked close enough with Kirk to notice the strained relations he had with his wife Ruth, particularly after the 1972 election.\nWhen Kirk died in 1974, the finance minister Bill Rowling replaced him as prime minister. Rowling reorganised the prime minister's office staff and did not retain Willing as personal secretary. For the next month Willing was kept on however to assist Ruth Kirk with her affairs and correspondence. He then shifted to work as a private secretary for Hugh Watt, the Minister of Works and Development, until 1975. Willing stood for election to the New Zealand House of Representatives for the Labour Party in the Manawatu seat of Ruahine at the 1975 election finishing runner-up. After the election, he gained employment at the Department of Statistics.\nIn 1976, he made a return to local-body politics when he won a by-election for the Porirua City Council to replace Gary McCormick who had resigned. In 1977 he stood for Mayor of Porirua as well as the city council as an independent candidate. He was unsuccessful in both elections. For standing as an independent against the official Labour ticket he was expelled from the party. In 1980 he was elected for a third spell as a Porirua City Councillor. Once on the council again, he voted in favour of a motion to refer the controversial appointment of former Lower Hutt deputy mayor John Seddon as Porirua's Town Clerk to the Office of the Ombudsman. After one term, he was defeated when standing for re-election in 1983. For six years he was also a member of the Porirua Licensing Trust (1977–80, 1983–86).\n\n\n=== Later life and death ===\nHis wife, Marie, died in 1992 and Willing moved from Elsdon to Tītahi Bay in 1994. He died at Kenepuru Hospital on 23 September 2000, aged 77. He was survived by his three sons and one daughter.\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== References ==\nFreer, Warren (2004).

        "content": "Euophrys leipoldti or the Karoo Euophrys Jumping Spider is a species of jumping spider in the genus Euophrys that is endemic to South Africa. It lives in karoo and succulent karoo. The female was first described in 1903 by George and Elizabeth Peckham and the male in 2014 by Wanda Wesołowska, Galina Azarkina and Anthony Russell-Smith. It is a small spider, with a body that consists of an oval cephalothorax that measures between 1.9 and 2.1 mm (0.07 and 0.08 in) long and a narrower abdomen that is between 1.8 and 2.4 mm (0.07 and 0.09 in) long. The female has a larger abdomen than the male. The spider is generally yellowish-brown to brown, although some examples have a darker topside of the cephalothorax, or carapace. The spider has a mottled pattern on its abdomen. The male has slightly longer brown front legs, the remainder being yellow. The female has yellowish-brown legs that have brown patches and rings. Its copulatory organs are distinctive. The female has the longest insemination ducts in the genus and the male has an unusual spiral embolus.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nEuophrys leipoldti is a species of jumping spider that was first described by George W. Peckham & Elizabeth G. Peckham in 1903. They allocated it to the genus Euophrys, which had been first circumscribed by Carl Ludwig Koch in 1834. The genus is named for a Greek word that can be translated \"fair eyebrows\". The species is named for Christiaan Friedrich Leipodt who found the first examples. It is known as the Karoo Euophrys Jumping Spider. Initially, the only examples to be described were female, a description of the male having to wait for more a century until it was completed by Wanda Wesołowska, Galina Azarkina and Anthony Russell-Smith in 2014.\nIn Wayne Maddison's 2015 study of spider phylogenetic classification, the genus Euophrys was listed to the tribe Euophryini. First circumscribed by Simon in 1901, the tribe has also been known as Euophrydinae, but the original name is now more prevalent. It is a member of a subgroup of genera called Evophrydeae after the latter name. It is a member of the clade Saltafresia. Analysis of protein-coding genes showed it was particularly related to Thorelliola. In 2016, Prószyński added the genus to a group of genera named Euopherines, named after the genus. This is a member of the supergroup of genera Euphryoida.\n\n\n== Description ==\nEuophrys leipoldti is a small spider with a body divided into two main parts: a larger cephalothorax and a smaller abdomen. The male has an oval cephalothorax that is typically 2.1 mm (0.08 in) long and 1.6 mm (0.06 in) wide. The carapace, the hard upper part of the cephalothorax, is yellowish-brown to brown and covered in white hairs. The spider's eye field is dark brown or black and covered in brown hairs. There is a thin line of white hairs that run down the middle, crossed with a thicker line. The underside of the cephalothorax, or sternum, is brownish-yellow. The spider's face, or clypeus, is also yellowish-brown with a scattering of white scales visible on its surface. The chelicerae are stour and brown, again with small white scales, and have two teeth to the front and one to the back.\nThe male's abdomen is slightly smaller than its carapace, being typically 1.8 mm (0.07 in) long and typically 1.3 mm (0.05 in) wide. The top has a mottled pattern of dense brown and white hairs marked with a pattern of darker spots that form a streak across the middle, which itself breaks into a succession of chevrons near the back. The underside is light brown. The spider has brownish spinnerets and book lung covers. The front legs are longer than the rest and generally brown, apart from patches of yellow, and covered in brown hairs. The remaining legs are yellow and marked with brown rings.\nThe female is has a slightly smaller cephalothorax than the male, typically 1.9 mm (0.07 in) in length and 1.5 mm (0.06 in) in width, and an abdomen that is larger, between 2.4 mm (0.09 in) long and 1.8 mm (0.07 in) wide. It has a dark carapace with a pattern of white bands on the edges that extend into the eye field. Some examples have a brown carapace with a darker eye field, covered in dense shiny hairs, and a yellowish-brown sternum. The chelicerae are also yellowish-brown, and have a dense covering of white hairs. The abdomen is yellowish and covered in white and brown hairs. The pattern is different to the male but similarly mottled, and consists of small patches. All the legs are yellowish-brown with brown patches and rings. It has a large number of long brown leg spines. In some examples, the legs are covered in white hairs.\nThe spider has distinctive copulatory organs. \nThe female epigyne has two round depressions near the front and two copulatory openings that are partially hidden by small flaps. These lead via very long and looping insemination ducts to bean-shaped spermathecae. The male has brown pedipalps and a yellow cymbium, covered in brown hairs. Brown hairs also cover the palpal tibia, which has a pronounced protrusion, or tibial apophysis, that is larger than other species. The remainder of the copulatory organs have white hairs. The palpal bulb has a very long and lumpy extrusion at its base and a long embolus that spirals around vertically before curving up and back towards the cymbium. It is the shape of the embolus that most distinguishes the species from the related Euophrys gracilis. Similarly, the length of the insemination ducts, the longest in the genus, help identify the female.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nEuophrys spiders live across the world, although those found in North America may be accidental migrants and those in Central and South America misidentfications. In Africa, they are mainly found in the southern part of the continent. Euophrys leipoldti is endemic to South Africa. The female holotype was discovered near Clanwilliam in Western Cape. The first male was seen, in a grouping of three females and six males, in Karoo National Park in 1985 at an altitude of 1,200 m (3,900 ft) above sea level. Other examples have been found in Northern Cape, including eight females and five males identified in Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park in 1987.\nMost Euophrys spiders seem to prefer living in forests. Euophrys leipoldti thrives in arid environments that prevail in the western side of South Africa. It is particularly common in karoo and succulent karoo.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===",

        "content": "Greater Central Asia (GCA) is a variously defined region encompassing the area in and around Central Asia, by one definition including Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, Xinjiang (in China), and Afghanistan, and by a more expansive definition, also including Mongolia and parts of India and Russia. The region was historically interconnected religiously, economically, and otherwise, being important as part of the Silk Road trading network until the 15th century; the competition between Soviet, British, and Chinese spheres of influence split the region apart in the 20th century. In the 21st century, it has been contested by a number of major powers, such as America, China and Russia.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn ancient times, GCA was involved in the Silk Road, and was greatly influenced by Buddhism as it transmitted through the region to East Asia. The region was important in an intellectual sense, coming up with many new ideas and connecting the intellectual spheres of neighboring Eurasian regions. The Kushan Empire was one of the first empires to unite most of GCA.\nThe Mongol conquest of Central Asia in the 13th century increased the economic connectivity of the region. Most of GCA became Muslim, though non-Muslim areas of GCA such as Mongolia share common religious heritage with neighboring areas through elements such as Tengrism. Central Asian conquests of India in the first half of the second millennium, primarily by Timur and later Babur, then resulted in the spread of a Turco-Persian tradition throughout GCA and into South Asia, especially prevalent in northwestern South Asia. By the 17th century, the importance of the Silk Road had declined due to the rise of maritime trade.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\nChina's involvement in GCA, involving over $100 billion in investment, is argued to be aimed towards the protection of its Xinjiang region from neighboring terrorist groups, as well as securing natural resources and curbing the local influence of America and India. India is interested in engaging with GCA, though its difficult relationship with Pakistan and the instability of Afghanistan reduce the potential for such engagement for the time being.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSoviet Central Asia\nInner Asia\nGreater Iran\nGreater Khorasan\nGreater Middle East\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nHeartlands of Eurasia: The Geopolitics of Political Space",

        "content": "Mian Nadeem Riaz is a Pakistani American food scientist, academic and author. He is the holder of the Professorship in Food Diversity, Director of the Extrusion Technology Program and the Associate Department Head of the Food Science and Technology Department at Texas A&M University.\nRiaz's research is focused on halal food production and food processing using innovative technologies. He has authored and co-authored research articles and seven books including Halal Food Production, Halal Industrial Production Standards, Handbook of Halal Production, Extruders in Food Applications, Extruders and Expanders in Pet Food, Aquatic, and Livestock Feed, Soy Application in Foods, and Extrusion Problems Solved. He is the recipient of the 2016 University of Maine Bernard Lown Alumni Humanitarian Award, the 2023 International Food Security Award from the Institute of Food Technologists, and the 2023 Texas A&M University Dean's Outstanding Achievement Award for International Impact.\n\n\n== Education and early career ==\nRiaz obtained a bachelor's degree in Food Technology and Agriculture in 1985 and a master's degree in Food Technology in 1987, both from the University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, where he also worked as a Research Assistant before moving to Maine, USA. He became a Food Science Consultant in 1990 and was the first PhD graduate of the University of Maine Food and Nutrition Sciences Department in 1992.\n\n\n== Career ==\nRiaz began his academic career by running the extrusion program at Texas A&M University in 1992. He later joined the Faculty of the Institute of Food Science and Engineering at Texas A&M University in 1995 and became a Graduate Faculty in 1998. He has been the Holder of the Professorship in Food Diversity in the Food Science and Technology Department since 2017.\nFrom 2005 to 2020, and has been the Head of the Extrusion Technology Program and the Research Scientist of the Texas A&M Engineering Experiment Station since 1997 and the Associate Department Head since 2022. He served on various committees while at Texas A&M, most recently serving on the Department Head Search Committee, and the New Faculty Search Committee.\n\n\n== Research ==\nRiaz has contributed to the field of food science by studying halal food, extrusion processing of food and feed, oilseed processing, snack food, pet food, vegetable protein processing, and religious and ethnic foods.\n\n\n== Works ==\nRiaz's works largely focus on halal food, extrusion, and food processing. He co-edited the Handbook of Halal Food Production with Muhammad M. Chaudhry, which covered the aspects of halal food production, guidelines, market dynamics, and certification requirements, addressing the growing global demand for Halal food. They also co-authored Halal Food Production providing information on food laws, regulations, production guidelines, and trade requirements for halal food. In a review for the Journal of Aquatic Food Product Technology, Keith W. Gates commented \"The authors present the first comprehensive reference detailing Halal food production and certification requirements... a rare mix in one volume, practicality down to the expert's minutia combined with a fascinating and enlightening explanation of the spiritual basis for Halal, the Arabic word for 'permitted' or 'lawful.'\"\nRiaz published Soy Application in Foods in 2006, exploring the diverse uses of soy ingredients in the food industry, looking into processing conditions and applications. Later, in Extruders in Food Applications and Extruders and Expanders in Pet Food, Aquatic and Livestock Feeds, he offered practical insights on the application of extrusion technology in the food industry, covering various extruder types and applications for pet food and feed. He also co-authored Extrusion Problems Solved: Food, Pet Food and Feed with Galen J. Rocky which was called \"an extremely informative book\" by Donald G. Mercer.\n\n\n=== Halal food production ===\nRiaz has researched halal food production throughout his career. In a collaborative research paper, he highlighted the lack of transparency in disclosing the sources and processing of food ingredients, urging consumers to advocate for clearer labeling in halal and kosher food production. He outlined halal food laws for Muslims, emphasizing religious significance and offering guidance to the food industry, including dietary prohibitions, slaughter methods, the global halal market, and certification.\nIn 2021, Riaz and colleagues examined the acceptability of stunning methods in Halal meat production, weighing their pros and cons for economic and ethical considerations among Muslims.\n\n\n=== Extrusion processing ===\nRiaz studied extrusion processing by analyzing its effects and usage. He explored the various definitions of extrusion, emphasizing its role as a continuous cooking process with expanding applications in food, feed, and oilseed industries. In a joint research, he looked into the impact of extrusion, particularly on fat and water-soluble vitamins, revealing factors affecting their retention and sensitivity during the process.\nRiaz investigated the surge in North America's plant-based meat alternatives, driven by dietary shifts, environmental concerns, and the nutritional value of pulse crops and proteins.\n\n\n=== Food processing ===\nRiaz's work on food processing focused on food proteins and fat and oil extraction from animals and vegetables. He assessed the importance of fats and oils as a primary energy source, emphasizing advancements in extraction technologies for high-quality fats from various sources, both animal and plant-based.\nIn a collaborative study, Riaz evaluated the flavor and lipid profiles of textured peanut (TP), a potential meat substitute, noting low volatile flavor compounds and stable lipid oxidation products during one year of storage. Furthermore, he produced extruded cereal flakes by substituting corn cones with different levels of nonroasted and roasted partially defatted peanut flour.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n2016 – Bernard Lown Alumni Humanitarian Award, University of Maine\n2023 – International Food Security Award, Institute of Food Technologists\n2023 – Dean's Outstanding Achievement Award for International Impact, Texas A&M University\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Selected books ===\nExtruders in food applications (2000) ISBN 978-1566767798\nHalal Food Production (2004) ISBN 978-1587160295\nSoy Application in Foods (2006) ISBN 978-0849329814\nExtruders and Expanders in Pet Food, Aquatic and Livestock Feeds (2007) ISBN 978-3860373019\nHandbook of Halal Food Production (2018) ISBN 978-1498709712\n\n\n=== Selected articles ===\nLusas, E.

        "content": "The PLA Army Air Corps is the air arm of the People's Liberation Army's Ground Force. Its principal mission is to provide close air support, air assault, transportation, and overall air assistance to the land forces of the PLA. It deploys primordially rotary wing aircraft.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe PLA Army Aviation Corps was established on October 3, 1986, by decision of the Central Military Commission, at the time under the leadership of its chairman Deng Xiaoping, as part of an effort to modernize the organization of the PLA. The Corps started operating in 1987. On January 8, 1988, the first army aviation unit was established in the Beijing Military Region.\nThe initial units of the army aviation corps used equipment transferred from the PLAAF, including mostly the first Chinese-made helicopter, the Harbin Z-5 (a version of the Mil Mi-4), the licensed-made Z-8 (a version of the French Aérospatiale SA 321 Super Frelon) and the American-made S-70C \"Black Hawk\" purchased during the Sino-American thaw of the 1980s. The success of the American attack helicopters during the Gulf War impressed the Chinese military command, which put more emphasis on the development of indigenous helicopters. This accelerated program would lead to the introduction in 1994 of the Harbin Z-9 (developed from the French Eurocopter AS365 Dauphin), the Harbin Z-19 (an armed variant of the Z-9, introduced in 2012), the medium attack Changhe Z-10 (introduced in 2012), and the medium utility helicopter Harbin Z-20 (generally based on the Black Hawk in configuration, introduced in 2019).\nThe progress of the local helicopter industry, however, was slow. The difficulty providing relief after the Wenchuan Earthquake of 2008 brought into clear relief the shortage of helicopters in China, both civilian and military, in particular helicopters capable of operating at high altitudes. The need for more helicopters became apparent and the procurement of military rotary wing aircraft accelerated. While the native Z-19 and Z-10 were already available, the Chinese government tried to accelerate the equipment of full brigades by purchasing a large number of Mil Mi-17 helicopters in 2019, a sign of its desire to accelerate the development of army aviation.\n\n\n== Organization ==\nBy 2013, the army aviation regiments in six military regions were ungraded to brigades. After the 2015 military reforms, the military regions were merged into theaters and each group army within each theater was intended to have an independent Army Aviation brigade.\nAs of 2023, each of the 13 PLAGF group armies, plus the Tibet and Xinjiang special military regions, had an aviation brigade, for a total of 13 army aviation brigades and 2 air assault brigades.\nEach army aviation brigade is composed of 2-3 attack helicopter battalions, and 3-4 transport and assault helicopter battalions, for a total of 32 to 48 attack helicopters and 48 to 64 transport helicopters. The estimated current number of available aircraft runs between 1,000 and 1,500, depending on the source.\nThe current army aviation units are as follows, the brigade number being usually the same as the group army's number.\n\nEastern Theater Command\n71st Army Aviation Brigade (attached to the 71st Group Army)\n72nd Army Aviation Brigade (attached to the 72nd Group Army)\n73rd Army Aviation Brigade (attached to the 73rd Group Army)\nSouthern Theater Command\n74th Army Aviation Brigade (attached to the 74th Group Army)\n121st Air Assault Brigade (attached to the 75th Group Army)\nNorthern Theater Command\n78th Army Aviation Brigade (attached to the 78th Group Army)\n79th Army Aviation Brigade (attached to the 79th Group Army)\n80th Army Aviation Brigade (attached to the 80th Group Army)\nCentral Theater Command\n81st Army Aviation Brigade (attached to the 81st Group Army\n82nd Army Aviation Brigade (attached to the 82nd Group Army)\n161st Air Assault Brigade (attached to the 83rd Group Army)\nWestern Theater Command\n76th Army Aviation Brigade (attached to the 76th Group Army\n77th Army Aviation Brigade (attached to the 77th Group Army\nThe 84th Army Aviation Brigade in the Xinjiang Military Region.\nThe 85th Army Aviation Brigade in the Tibet Military Region.\nThe Beijing Garrison, plus the Macao and Hong Kong Garrisons, are the only major regional subdivisions of the PLA without an attached army aviation brigade (although smaller helicopter units are available).\n\n\n== Equipment ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===",

        "content": "Jaime Gómez Rivas is a Spanish physicist and an academic. He is a professor at Eindhoven University of Technology.\nRivas is most known for his physics research, primarily focusing on nanophotonics and terahertz optics. His work has been published in academic journals, including Light: Science & Applications and Materials today. He holds multiple patents. Moreover, he is the recipient of 2016 Facebook Academy Award for his work on plasmonics.\n\n\n== Education ==\nRivas earned his Master's in Physics with a specialization in Astrophysics from Universidad Complutense de Madrid and Université de Liége in 1995. Later, he completed his Ph.D. from the Universiteit van Amsterdam in 2002.\n\n\n== Career ==\nFrom 1997 to 2001, Rivas held a position as a research associate at Universiteit van Amsterdam to perform a PhD. Following this, between 2002 and 2005, he served as the project leader for THz Plasmonics as well as postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of Semiconductor Technology at RWTH-Aachen University. There, his group pioneered the field of semiconductor THz plasmonics. From 2005 to 2015, he assumed the role of project leader (2005–2009) and group leader (2009–2015) for the Nanowire Photonics Group at the FOM Institute for Atomic and Molecular Physics (AMOLF) in Amsterdam. Between 2005 and 2015, he also led the Surface Photonics Group embedded at Philips Research in Eindhoven, where he introduced the concept of plasmonics and nanoantennas for solid-state lighting. Concurrently, he held a part-time professorship in surface photonics at Eindhoven University of Technology. Subsequently, he served as a full professor of surface photonics and THz physics at the same institution from 2016 to 2019. Since September 2019, he has held the positions of full professor and group leader of the Surface Photonics Group, as well as the capacity group leader of the Photonics and Semiconductor Nanophysics group at Eindhoven University of Technology. He cofounded TeraNova in 2019.\n\n\n== Research ==\nRivas, in his early research focused on light propagation through strongly scattering media and Anderson localization of light. In his 1999 work, he explored the fundamental physics of light-matter interaction within disordered scattering materials, such as polydisperse semiconductor powders and porous layers.\nIn 2003, Rivas' research delved into the resonant tunneling of surface-plasmon polaritons (SPPs) through doped semiconductors at terahertz frequencies, revealing enhanced transmission through subwavelength apertures, showcasing sharp resonances and notably improved transmission efficacy over classical diffraction transmission.\nRivas' 2007 collaborative research with OL Muskens, JA Sanchez and others explored how resonant optical nanoantennas can significantly enhance the radiative decay rate of fluorescent dye molecules, resulting in improved internal quantum efficiency, as demonstrated through experimental observation and theoretical validation. His 2009 research explored the interplay between nanoengineered arrays of nanoparticles that support collective resonances, known as surface lattice resonances, and fluorescent molecules to manipulate light emission at the nanoscale.\nRivas' 2011 research presented an advancement in plasmonic nanoparticle sensor performance, achieving over tenfold improvement in sensitivity by exploiting diffractive coupling of localized surface plasmon resonances to create narrow linewidth Fano resonances for precise refractive index detection. While investigating the integration of high quantum efficiency emitters with plasmonic nanoantennas, his 2013 work demonstrated a substantial improvement in light emission from extended sources by achieving over 70-fold directional enhancement for p-polarized emission and 60-fold enhancement for unpolarized emission, paving the way for new research directions in solid-state lighting. In 2013, he delved into the utilization of metal nanoparticle arrays for strong light-matter coupling, exploring how molecular electronic transitions interact with electromagnetic fields to form hybrid light-matter states. This investigation led to the demonstration of polariton lasing and condensation at room temperature, and enhanced exciton propagation. His later work examined bound states in the continuum (optical modes without any loss) both in the visible and at THz frequencies.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n2011 – Starting Grant and Proof of Concept Grant, European Research Council\n2016 – Facebook Academy Award for Solid State Lighting, Facebook\n2016 – Excellent Publication Award, Light Science & Applications\n\n\n== Selected articles ==\nMuskens, O.

        "content": "The Kingdom of Sekar, formerly called the Kingdom of Kabituwar, is one of the nine kingdoms that still exist in West Papua Province. The other eight kingdoms are Ati-Ati, Patipi, Rumbati, Fatagar, Arguni, Wertuar, Namatota, and Komisi. This kingdom is located on the Onin Peninsula, Kokas district, Fakfak Regency, West Papua. In the early perios, Sekar was a subordinate to the Kingdom of Rumbati, but later it was recognized as its own kingdom.\n\n\n== History ==\nInitially, the Kingdom of Sekar was centered on the entrance of Sekar Bay, which was called Kabituwar. Therefore, the first king, Pandai alias Congan, held the title of King of Kabituwar. The Kokas area became a settlement for many traders from outside Papua, and later this settlement was named Sekar. In 1896, the Sultan of Tidore appointed a man from soa Beraweri, Mner, as the Kapiten king of the Sekar. This appointment was based on the Misool and Rumbati kings' suggestions. Thus, the authority of the Kapiten King of Sekar was separate from the authority of the King of Kabituwar. Mner then moved to Sekar and founded the village of Sekar. Mner's eldest son, Kubis, also received the title of Kapiten King of Sekar, but subsequent descendants no longer received this title.\nMeanwhile, before assuming the title of King of Kabituwar, Pandai was an unofficial commissioned king from the Kingdom of Rumbati. His father Paduri alias Weker also held this title. However, when Pandai died, no potential successors were considered. This was because Pandai had no siblings, and his only son, Abdulrachman, was still a child. As a result, the government of the Kabituwar kingdom was led by the rajamuda of Wertuwar named Lakate, who was Pandai's stepson. Pandai was married twice. His second wife, Badika, was previously the wife of the rajamuda of Wertuwar, Inisuka, who was Lakate's father. Lakate assumed his role as the King of Kabituwar, while Saban Pipi Rumagesan carried out the role of the rajamuda, although he was not officially appointed. Pipi himself was the son of Dimin, the adopted \"golden child\" of Paduri. According to the local custom, Dimin's descendants could not become a king because they did not have a kinship relationship with the previous kings.\nIn 1911, the Dutch colonial authorities did not find a qualified person to replace Lakate, so they intervened in the succession of the Kabituwar kingdom by appointing Pipi as the king with the title of King Sekar. His daughter had previously been married to Lakate. Due to Pipi's old age, his son Machmud Singgirei Rumagesan was appointed as the rajamuda to assist in governance. Pikpik, originally part of the Atiati kingdom, was transferred to Sekar.\nAround 1885, the king of Atiati appointed a local chief in Pikpik, intending to gain war support amidst threats between Rumbati on one side and Atiati and Fatagar on the other. This local chief was named Tatare and was given the title of king, although this title was not recognized by the Dutch government until his son Kauat was acknowledged as the Pikpik chief. However, through the Dutch intervention, all relations between Atiati and Pikpik were abolished, and Pikpik was annexed to the Kingdom of Sekar. It can be assumed that Kauat made several maneuvers to establish his own kingdom without being under Sekar. However, the desires of the Pikpik local chiefs were never supported by the Dutch colonial government. Based on practical considerations, Pikpik was within the jurisdiction of Sekar, although traditionally, the position of the Sekar king as the head of Pikpik was still debated. Some other areas that did not acknowledge the authority of the Sekar king at that time were Sisir and Ugar, which had their own royal lineages. However, the Dutch colonial government fully supported the authority of the Sekar king.\nMachmud Singgirei Rumagesan was appointed as king in 1915 and was officially recognized by the Dutch government. However, King Rumagesan often rebelled against the Dutch. His rebellion was sparked by a conflict with Colijn Company, an oil mining company operating in Kokas. In the early period, King Rumagesan and the local residents facilitated the company's operations in Kokas, so the company agreed to give him part of the wages to distribute to the people. However, a local assistant administrator demanded King Rumagesan return the money to him, but King Rumagesan refused. This Assistant Administrator reported to the Controleur van den Terwijk, who then engaged in a fight with King Rumagesan. The local residents supported King Rumagesan and nearly killed van den Terwijk. The rebellion escalated, prompting the colonial government based in Fakfak to send troops. Eventually, 73 local residents and 5 village chiefs were arrested and sentenced to 2–10 years in prison. Meanwhile, King Rumagesan was sentenced to 15 years in prison in Saparua, Maluku. While in prison, Rumagesan wrote a letter seeking help from Muhammad Husni Thamrin, a member of the Volksraad. Thamrin successfully brought Rumagesan's case to court, where it was proven that he was innocent, and he was released in 1941. Machmud Singgirei Rumagesan was later involved in several Indonesian resistance movements against the Dutch colonial rule in Papua.\nAfter Machmud Singgirei Rumagesan passed away, his son, Amir Syahdan Rumagesan, was enthroned as the King of Sekar. However, after Amir's death, a succession conflict occurred. As a result, Rustuty Rumagesan, Singgirei's descendant from a princess of Gowa, became the leader. However, Rustuty refused the title of king and took a middle way by assuming the title \"Ratu Petuanan Tanah Rata Kokoda.\" Rustuty married Sri Harijanto Tjitro Soeksoro, who was a nobleman descended from Mangkunegara III. After Rustuty's death, her uncle Arief Rumagesan, Singgirei's fifth-generation grandson, became the king with the title \"Raja Petuanan Pikpik Sekar.\"\n\n\n== Note ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Simen Hestnes (born 5 February 1996) is a Norwegian footballer who plays as a midfielder for KFUM in Eliteserien.\nHestnes hails from Oslo and is a son of a volleyball player. He joined the youth section of Vålerenga Fotball and attended the Wang elite sports school. In April 2015 he made his senior debut for Vålerenga, playing in the 2015 Norwegian Football Cup first round against Lokomotiv Oslo. He left during the summer to attend LIU Brooklyn and play for the LIU Brooklyn Blackbirds. In the 2015 Northeast Conference season he made the All-Conference Team, and in the 2016 Northeast Conference season he made the All-Conference Team again and was awarded Player of the Year. Hestnes also played for the Brooklyn Italians during the 2017 NPSL season before changing college to the Xavier University and the Xavier Musketeers men's soccer team. During the 2017 Big East Conference season he made the All-Conference Second Team. Describing himself as snotty and immature before he left for the US, Hestnes also admitted that he was a \"baron of the nightlife\" during his stay. An agent talked about FC Cincinnati wanting to acquire Hestnes in the MLS Draft, which did not happen.\nAfter graduating from Xavier University, Hestnes returned to Norway in the summer of 2019 and joined struggling 1. divisjon team Skeid. Despite his 2 goals in 4 games, Skeid were relegated, but he was a part of the team that won re-promotion from the 2020 2. divisjon. After the 2021 season, Hestnes left Skeid for another Oslo club at the second tier, KFUM.\nHestnes soon formed a midfield duo with Robin Rasch. In the 2023 1. divisjon, KFUM managed to win promotion to Eliteserien, a level the club had never before managed to reach.\nAfter winning promotion Hestnes extended his contract to 2026. In April 2024 he was in the starting eleven for KFUM's debut in Eliteserien. He scored his first Eliteserien goal in the same month against Strømsgodset.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Belonocnema kinseyi is a species of gall wasp that forms galls on Quercus virginiana and Quercus fusiformis. There are both asexual and sexual generations. The asexual generation forms galls on the underside of leaves whereas the sexual generation form galls on the roots. It can be found in the United States, where it is known from Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas. It, along with the other described Belonocnema species, have been used to study speciation.\n\n\n== Taxonomy and Phylogenetics ==\nBelonocnema kinseyi was first named in 1921 by Lewis Hart Weld based on individuals raised from asexual leaf galls collected on Quercus fusiformis in Boerne, Texas. The specific epithet \"kinseyi\" honors prominent entomologist and sexologist Alfred Kinsey, who greatly contributed to knowledge of North American gall wasps. \nIn 1998, it was discovered that the asexual generation described from Texas induced sexual root galls, which at the time was believed to only be associated with Belonocnema treatae. Thus, B. kinseyi was placed as a junior synonym under B. treatae. It was subsequently re-elevated to species status through genetic and morphological analysis in 2021.\nGenetic data places Belonocnema kinseyi as an outgroup to a clade containing its sister species B. treatae and B. fossoria. Additionally, A 2022 study investigating the evolutionary relationships within the family Cynipidae used data from B. kinseyi, where it was placed in the phylogeny as sister to Druon quercuslanigerum.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe asexual generation galls are smooth, unilocular balls that appear on the ventral side of leaves. Young galls are orange or light brown and darken as they age. The sexual generation galls are irregular shaped, multilocular clusters of galls appearing on small rootlets.\nBelonocnema kinseyi can be separated from B. fossoria by the spur on the anterior side of the fore tibia being shorter than the basitarsus and tibial spur in both sexual and asexual generations. It can also be told apart from B. treatae in the sexual generation by deeply delimited scutellar foveae separated narrowly by a carina, and its reddish brown color as well as indistinctive areolet in the asexual generation.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nBelonocnema kinseyi can be found in southern Louisiana, southern Mississippi, a small area of Oklahoma and south, central and southeast Texas. This distribution follows that of their host trees, Quercus virginiana and Quercus fusiformis. However, a species turnover occurs in southeast Mississippi, where B. treatae replaces B. kinseyi for the remaining eastern range of Q. virginiana.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Teloschistopsis bonae-spei is a species of saxicolous (rock-dwelling), fruticose lichen in the family Teloschistaceae. It occurs in South Africa, where it grows on maritime and coastal rocks.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIt was first formally described as a new species in 1984 by the lichenologists Ove Almborn and Josef Poelt, who initially classified it in the genus Caloplaca. The type specimen of Teloschistopsis bonae-spei was collected in South Africa, specifically within the Cape Province on the Cape Peninsula, in the district of Simon's Town. The precise location was the Cape of Good Hope reserve at Olifantsbos on the west coast. Here, the lichen was found growing on sandstone banks, which rise up to 2 metres high, situated in the immediate coastal area. The collection was made from somewhat sheltered locations on more or less vertical surfaces.\nPatrik Frödén and colleagues transferred the taxon to the genus Teloschistopsis in 2013, following a molecular phylogenetics-led reorganisation of the Teloschistaceae.\n\n\n== Description ==\nTeloschistopsis bonae-spei predominantly grows on rocks devoid of calcite. It forms expansive colonies characterised by both flat and three-dimensional structures. The thallus (body of the lichen) displays a range of yellow to yellow-orange coloured lobes, measuring up to 5 mm in length and between 0.3 and 1 mm in width. These lobes, found at the periphery, are tightly to loosely attached to the substrate, have irregular branching, and may overlap each other. On older parts of these marginal lobes, numerous pseudocyphellae (tiny, porous spots that facilitate gas exchange) are present. Moving towards the centre of the thallus, the lobes can be similar in adherence to the substrate or can rise up, forming a loose, shrub-like layer that stands over the crusty base of the thallus. These ascending lobes are variably flat to significantly compressed and range from 0.5 to 3 mm in width. In mature lobes, the cortex layer, which covers the surface, may crack longitudinally creating long strips filled with pseudocyphellae, mirroring the coloration of the marginal lobes.\nApothecia (fruiting bodies) are distributed sporadically and can be abundant on certain lobes. They are borne on the upper side or terminally on the lobes, and have flat to slightly convex, brownish-yellow-orange discs. Initially, these discs are encircled by a protruding thalline margin}, which soon transitions into a narrow proper margin and a more retracted, wart-divided thalline margin. The underside of these fruiting bodies is also covered with numerous pseudocyphellae.\nThe structure within these lobes is dorsiventral, meaning they have differentiated upper and lower surfaces. The upper side, barring the pseudocyphellae, is sealed with a continuous network of scleroplectenchymatic filaments (thick-walled, supportive tissue), while the underside is more irregularly structured. The medulla, or innermost layer of the thallus, in areas not occupied by filament networks, contains clusters of granular, colourless to ochre deposits.\nThe apothecium excipulum (supporting layer of the fruiting body) mirrors the irregular structure of the thallus, lacking a distinct amphithecium (outer layer of tissue around the apothecium). The hymenium (spore-producing layer) is about 70–80 µm high, with paraphyses (filamentous cells in the hymenium) that are 1.5–2 µm thick, expanding up to 5 µm at the capitate (club-like) terminal cells. Some paraphyses transform into oil paraphyses, usually containing one or two oil cells. The spores are narrow to broadly ellipsoid, measuring about 11.5–16 µm by 5.5–7.5 µm, with septa approximately 2.5–5 µm thick.\n\n\n== References ==",

His relocation to Seattle was prompted by a visit to see his brother-in law; his first place of employment in the city was at the Pike Place Market.\nUpon his death, the Seattle City Council passed a resolution declaring his loss \"a loss to the entire city\" and praising his years of service.\nJames Scavotto was survived by his wife Rose, their two sons, and their grandchildren.\n\n\n== References ==",

He attended Radley College following his early education at Cheam School, where he notably interacted with the future King Charles III.\nBulstrode's academic pursuits began with a strong interest in zoology, leading him to study under Nobel laureate, Konrad Lorenz in Bavaria.  This experience prompted a temporary shift from medicine to zoology at  Oxford, where he led student expeditions.  However, he later returned to medicine, completing his education at  Cambridge and Oxford.\n\n\n== Career ==\nBulstrode's medical career began in Africa, where he worked in refugee camps and as a lecturer in veterinary pathology.  Later, he returned to the UK and changed his specialisation to trauma and orthopaedics. He was known for his outspoken views on medical ethics and reform, particularly advocating for the rights of junior doctors and critiquing established medical practices.\nBulstrode's later career included service as a trauma surgeon in the British Army, despite initial age-related challenges.  His deployment to Afghanistan was a notable period, where he contributed to healthcare restructuring and worked in refugee camps. His post-military career involved emergency medicine in New Zealand and contributions to Doctors of the World. His service was recognised in 2016 when he was appointed CBE.\nBulstrode died of a progressive neurodegenerative disorder on 7 December 2023. Before he died he completed his autobiography. In accordance with his wishes, it is now on line (from 13 April 2024) at christopherbulstrode.com His memorial service was held at Magdalen College Oxford.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Daniel F. McDevitt (January 15, 1916 – September 12, 1965) was an American politician who was Mayor of Reading, Pennsylvania from 1956 to 1960 and a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from 1961 to 1964.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMcDevitt was born on January 15, 1916, to Thomas H. and Catherine (Heffelfinger) McDevitt. He served in the Infantry Branch of the United States Army during World War II and received two Bronze Star Medals and a Purple Heart. After the war, he operated the Reading House bar. When he became mayor, McDevitt transferred control of the bar to brother.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nIn 1953, McDevitt was elected to the Reading city council in his first ever attempt at elected office. Two years later, he ran for mayor of Reading. He defeated former mayor John F. Davis\tby a 2 to 1 in the Democratic primary and beat city clerk Ralph W. D. Levan 18,556 votes to 11,674 in the general election. During his tenure, the West Shore Bypass was constructed, municipal parking lots were expanded, and the city's sewer system was upgraded.\nAfter McDevitt took office, Abe Minker took control of the rackets in Reading. Casinos and houses of prostitution flourished in the city until federal intervention. On July 4, 1956, the Internal Revenue Service removed unlicensed gambling machines from the Reading House. Following the raid, McDevitt went to war with the Reading Eagle and Reading Times for publishing accounts of the incident. He closed the city hall press room, had police officers ticket newspaper delivery trucks every time they stopped to drop off papers, and had reporter Charles H. Kessler arrested for disorderly conduct for posing for a photograph in front of City Hall. The tickets were thrown out and the case against Kessler was dismissed. On September 7, 1957, United State Treasury agents raided the Reading House and arrested McDevitt's brother for tax violations related to an illegal horse book run at the bar. McDevitt was defeated for reelection by John C. Kubacki.\nMcDevitt was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 1960 and reelected in 1962, but did not run for a third term in 1964.\nOn October 15, 1964, McDevitt and former city councilor Bruce R. Coleman were charged with extorting $2,000 from a company that sold three fire trucks to Reading in 1959. The district attorney's office dropped the case on March 22, 1965, following a successful habeas corpus petition by McDevitt, who acted as his own attorney.\nIn 1965, McDevitt ran for a seat on the Reading city council, but lost in the Democratic primary.\n\n\n== Death ==\nOn September 9, 1965, McDevitt suffered a heart attack and was admitted to Reading Hospital's intensive care unit in serious condition. He died three days later and was buried in Gethsemane Cemetery in Laureldale, Pennsylvania. He was survived by his wife, Isabelle (Shaner) McDevitt, and daughter.\n\n\n== References ==",

This value is within the Hubble Distance values.\n\n\n== Copeland Septet ==\n\nNGC 3751 is a member of the Copeland Septet. The other members are NGC 3745, NGC 3746, NGC 3748, NGC 3750, NGC 3753 and NGC 3754.\nHalton Arp noticed the 7 galaxies in which he published inside his article in 1966. This group is known as Arp 320 in which another galaxy, PGC 36010 is part of it. \nThis group was also observed by Paul Hickson, in which he included them inside his article which was published in 1982.

        "content": "The Dedham Inn was an inn on Court Street in Dedham, Massachusetts. It housed several notable guests at the corner of Court Street and Highland Street before burning down in 1939.\n\n\n== Early history ==\nDuring the American Revolution, General Lafayette's men camped on the land that would later adjoin the inn.\nThe home was built in 1791 and was said to have been designed by Charles Bulfinch.\nA year before the construction, the land was sold to John M. Lovell for 36 pounds. In 1792, Lovell sold the house and land to Samuel Brock Jr. for 576 pounds. The next  owner was John Madey, who sold it to Alexander Hodgdon in 1795. His widow sold it to Samuel \"Blind Samuel\" Richards in 1803. Richards was born in Dedham but later moved to Boston and became a hardware merchant. After going blind, he returned to Dedham.\nRichards' son, Edward Metcalf Richards, later owned the house. His wife, Rebecca (née Guild), said that when she first moved into the home that as many as 20 stagecoaches a day would pass by the house, many stopping at Gay's Tavern across the street. The rear portion of the home was torn down in 1878 and a new addition added. The home and land would remain in the Richard family for 114 years.\n\n\n== Use as an inn ==\nIn 1915, the house was purchased by Robert M. Morse, expanded, and converted into an inn. It quickly became a popular venue for events.\nJust a few years later, in 1919, Mary Miles Minter and William Desmond Taylor stayed at the inn while filming Anne of Green Gables. In 1920, a film version of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's poem The Bell of Atri was filmed in Dedham on the Town Common. The major players ate at the Dedham Inn.\nDuring the Sacco and Vanzetti trial, the sequestered jurors would eat at the inn. So, too, would judge Webster Thayer, the newspapermen covering the trial, and most of those connected with the courthouse. Several of those newspapermen would later submit an affidavit that swore they heard Thayer making prejudicial remarks at the inn.\n\n\n== Fire ==\nIn 1927, George Thorley purchased the inn. At 3:30 in the morning of February 6, 1939 Thorley's cockerspaniel, Josephine began barking and woke up the family. The house was on fire, and Thorley, his wife, their two daughters, two boarders, and one guest were able to get out of the house to safety. The seven attempted to get down the front stairs, but were repelled by the flames. They escaped out the back instead.\nFrank Howard, the guest, had trouble finding a fire alarm box but eventually located one on the corner of Court Street and Village Avenue. By holding the lever down, instead of simply pulling it down and releasing it, he interfered with the sounding of the whistle that indicated the location of the fire. The correct location was noted inside the fire station, however.\nChief Henry J. Harrigan sounded a general alarm upon arriving on scene when he saw the Highland Street side of the building completely engulfed. The entire Dedham Fire Department battled the flames for five hours, but the snow and ice created additional challenges. They used nine fire hoses to spray water on the house. The fire, which was likely caused by a faulty furnace, gutted the interior of the home. Only the exterior walls were left standing and it was razed.\nLost in the fire were 50 oil paintings by Magdeline Thorley, George's wife, an accomplished painter. One was worth $1,500. All of the clothes and possessions of the Thorley family, their boarders, and their guest were lost. Deputy Chief John Hartnett and firefighter William Henderson entered the building and attempted to rescue the dog, but were unsuccessful and Josephine perished in the flames.\nThe Thorley's daughter, Barbara, taught a kindergarten in the building.\n\n\n== Present day ==\nIn 1950–51, the property was subdivided and three new homes were built on it. Four granite fence posts on Court Street are all the remain of the original building.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Works cited ==\nParr, James L. (2009).

        "content": "The Lyceum Theatre was a theatre in Boston, Massachusetts located at 661-667 Washinton St at the corner of Boylston and Washington streets. It opened as the Boylston Museum (also called the New Boylston Museum) in 1875 at 667 Washington St. It operated as both a theatre and a dime museum. Its founder, George E. Lothrop, acquired the adjacent properties and greatly expanded the theatre. This expanded facility opened as the World's Museum (also called World's Theatre and the World's Museum, Menagerie and Aquarium) in 1885. In 1892 the theatre ceased being a dime museum and was renamed the Lyceum Theatre after undergoing significant alterations. It was demolished in June 1908.  The Gaiety Theatre was built on the same site in 1908.\n\n\n== Boylston Museum (1875-1885) ==\n\nThe Boylston Museum was founded by George E. Lothrop in 1875, at 667 Washington St adjacent to Boylston Market. Lothrop was a graduate of Dartmouth Medical School who left a career as a physician to pursue a career in theatre management. A dime museum as well as a theatre, a review in The Boston Globe on May 14, 1875, described the site as a \"cozy little theatrum\" and that the museum contained a \"collection of curiousities [that are] large and interesting\". It also described the theatre as offering daily afternoon and evening performances with both dramas and variety entertainments as offerings.\nThe Boylston Museum operated primarily as a variety theatre during the vaudeville era. The theatre sat 930 people and it charged 10 to 50 cents for tickets to its performances. The actor Horace Lewis (1854–1905) made his professional debut at the Boylston Museum during its first year of operation, starring as Mr. Primrose in an 1875 production of A Tight Place. Singer Maggie Cline was also an early performer at the theatre who began her career on the Boylston stage. By 1876 advertisements for the Boylton Museum began referring to the museum as the New Boylston Museum and its theatre as the Star Novelty Theatre.\nFor the Christmas 1877 season the actress Sadie Martinot was engaged for performances. Martinot became a favorite performer for Boston audiences in minstrel shows staged at the Boylston. George M. Cohan's father, Jere Cohan, worked as a stage manager at the Boylston Museum, and the Four Cohans sometimes gave six shows a day at the Boylston's theatre. Denman Thompson performed a highly popular sketch at the theatre, \"Uncle Josh\", which he later developed into the longer play The Old Homestead, which for a period held the record for the longest running play in the history of the American theatre.\nOther vaudeville entertainers to appear at the Boylston Museum included comedian Neil Burgess; actors Charles L. Davis (1870–1920) and Charles H. Yale; and acrobat and singing actress Carrie Swain. The museum and theatre stopped operating in April 1885 in order to expand and transform the enterprise into the World's Theatre.\n\n\n== World's Museum (1885-1892) ==\n\nLothrop decided to expand the size of his operation and acquired the 661, 663, and 665 Washington St properties to significantly enlarge the size of both the theatre and the museum. The builder of the museum was H. Roberts. Asa Lowe & Co. did the mason work, the Chelmsford Foundry Co. did the iron work, artist J. A. Teeling painted several murals in the building, J. Kelley & Co. made stained glass windows, Gill & Higgins provided French colored glass, and much of the interior design work was done by The Boston Wall Paper Co. \nThe much enlarged and essentially new facility reopened as the World's Museum, Menagerie, and Aquarium on Monday October 5, 1885. A variety program was presented in the theatre on opening day that featured African-American comedian Tom McIntosh, mentalist Madame Lee, singer Georgia Marsh, and many other performers of varying talents. It was reported that more than 50,000 people attended the museum during its first week of operation.\nExtending an entire city block, the World's Museum consisted of four floors and could accommodate 7,000 people. It was wired with electricity and had many crystal chandeliers lit by colored lights. The first floor of the building contained a vestibule with a large fountain, a theatre that could seat 1,000 people, and an aquarium. The second floor consisted of two large halls containing a wide array of \"curiosities\". \nThe third floor consisted of a menagerie. The menagerie contained both animals on display in cages and performing animals. Some of the animals who performed included \"Pendrinelli's trained monkeys\", an elephant named Bijou who could perform tricks of varying kinds, \"Baby Alice Dunbar and her den of performing snakes\", and \"Dr. Sawtell's Magnificent troupe of St. Bernards\". Animals on display in the menagerie included sea lions, a leopard, sea turtles, a tapir, six flying foxes, monkeys, tigers, a lion, bears, alligators, parrots and other tropical birds, song birds from around the world, and several deer among other animals. A baby lion named Max was particularly popular with Boston children. A Boston Evening Transcript article on November 13, 1885 reported that it was the third largest collection of animals in the United States, with only the Central Park Zoo and the Philadelphia Zoo surpassing it in terms of animal numbers.\nThe World's Museum also included a freak show in its \"hall of curiosities\" with performers that the museum described as an \"albino\", \"midgets\", \"lobster boy\", \"The Human Sketleton\", \"The Armless Man\", and other people possessing biological rarities. Among the performers at the opening were Count Primo Magri, General Tom Thumb and Mrs. General Tom Thumb. The museum would rotate in other people. The giantess Lottie Grant and the conjoined twins Millie and Christine McKoy, billed as the \"The Two-Headed Nightingale\", joined the roster of performers in November 1885. In February 1886 professional fat lady Madame Carver appeared alongside her son, the tiny person General Willis Carver in the hall. Other performers that worked in the hall of curiosities included tattooed lady Lillian Marco, tiny people Jennie Quigley and Major Tot, giant Colonel Routh Goshen, Captain Harry Decoursey, \"The Tatooed Man\", Krao, \"The Greatest of Living Curiousities\", albino sisters Florence and Mary Martin, the singing Seven Sutherland Sisters who all had very long hair, Belle Moody, \"the Human Billiard Ball\", and the bearded lady Annie Jones.\nAs with the former Boylston Museum, multiple variety act performances were presented daily and there was a rotating cadre of vaudeville entertainers engaged for these performances to keep audiences returning to the museum. Some notable performers who appeared at the World's Museum included comedian Sam Lucas, song and dance comedians Sheridan & Flynn, the multi-instrumentalist and singer Lillie Western, Grace Courtland, \"The Witch of Wall Street\",  actors Palmer and Hayden, actress Ada Melrose, and the contortionist and clown Harry Wentworth. \nThe museum would also sometimes offer burlesque parodies of popular stage works of the period, such as Gilbert and Sullivan's The Mikado in December 1885. This production was later presented to accompany a large \"Japanese bazaar\" installed at the museum in February 1886. That same month opera singer Blanche Corelli came to the World's Theatre and brought an entire opera company with her. They performed Edmond Audran's La mascotte with Corelli in the title role to large crowds. This was followed by performances of H.M.S. Pinafore. Other legitimate theatre works presented at the World's Theatre included a production of Dion Boucicault's Andy Blake: or, The Irish Diamond in March 1886.\nBy July 1892 the theatre had been sold to F. P. Clough and was no longer in operation.\n\n\n== Lyceum Theatre (1892-1908) ==\nIn July 1892 F. P. Clough began making significant alterations to the former World's Theatre building to transform it into the Lyceum Theatre. The walls of the theatre were rebuilt with new brick, and much work was done to improve the building's ventilation;. The number of exits were increased and careful attention was made to make the theatre fire proof; including the use of much more iron than in the World's Theatre. This included ornamental iron panels used as decorations on the walls of the theatre. The theatre also included white and gold frescos that were \"relieved with blue and buff\". The stage was 35 feet long, 35 feet wide, and 45 feet high. Austin Gibbon was hired as the theatre's first general manager and F.W. Johnson its first music director. \nThe theatre opened as the Lyceum Theatre on September 19, 1892. It's opening performance was a variety show which starred the blackface performer Billy Lester, the Irish comedians Spencer and Quigg, Spanish balero dancers, jugglers, and a wide array of other acts. The theatre continue to periodically host vaudeville type performances. Some notable vaudeville entertainers to appear at the theatre included the comedy duo Flynn and Sheridan.\nIn addition to being used for vaudeville performances, the theatre was also used for legitimate theatre. In its first year of operation it was used by the Boston Comic Opera for its 1892-1893 season, and presented Native-American actress and playwright Gowongo Mohawk in her play Wep-ton-no-mah;\nIn early 1907 the Lyceum Theatre was occupied by the Rice & Barton's Gaiety Company. Later that year the theatre was occupied by a show organized by Sam A. Scribner which closed on May 16, 1908.\nIn June 1908 it was announced that the Lyceum Theatre would be demolished to make way for the construction of the Gaiety Theatre. A report in The Boston Globe on June 10, 1908 stated that some of the smaller adjacent properties to the Lyceum Theatre had already been demolished to wake way for the theatre, and that the Lyceum Theatre was scheduled for demolition in the next few days with portions of the structure already been torn down.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nBacon, Edwin Monroe (1883). \"Boylston Museum\".

In 2021, the Shizuoka prefectural assembly advised him to resign after he said that the city of Gotemba \"only has koshihikari\" as its local specialty. In March 2024, he publicly ranked regions within the prefecture based on how \"cultured\" they were. He later refused to retract the statement claiming it was historically true.  During a speech to newly-employed civil servants on 1 April 2024, he made derogatory remarks comparing employees of the prefectural government with \"those who sell vegetables, take care of cows or create things.\" The resulting uproar led to him announcing his resignation on 2 April following the June prefectural assembly. However, he clarified on 3 April that he was resigning due to his opposition to the Chuo Shinkansen maglev route and not for his remarks, which he did not retract, although he apologized \"for hurting the feelings of people working in the primary sector.\" Despite his original intent on resigning after June, he announced he will be resigning on April 10th after countless complaints from the prefecture and among its employees. He stated the reason for the early resignation as he succeeded to delay the opening of maglev. He formally submitted his resignation on 10 April, which will become effective on 10 May and triggered an election to be held on 26 May.\n\n\n== Key issues ==\nKey issues in this election include the Chuo Shinkansen.\n\n\n== Candidates ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Yamaha Montage (stylized in all-uppercase MONTAGE) is a series of music synthesizers by Yamaha Corporation, first released in June 2016. It replaced the Motif XF/MOXF music workstations. The most recent version, Yamaha Montage M, was released in October 2023.\n\n\n== Products ==\n\n\n=== MONTAGE ===\nThe original Montage was released in 2017 in three versions having 61- and 76-key semi-weighted FSX keyboard action, and 88-key version with weighted Balanced Hammer Standard (BHS) keyboard action. Comparing to the Motif series, the preset wave ROM has been increased to 5.3 GBytes, with 1.75 GBytes reserved for user samples. The AWM2 engine has a maximum polyphony of 128 voices.\nFM-X sound engine, a 8-operator FM synthesis engine, similar to Yamaha FS1R but without formant shaping, has a polyphony of 128 voices.\nThe user interface presents only one single Performance mode, which can inclufr to 8 individual Parts (programs).\nThe rotary knobs in the realtime control section are replaced with endless encoders. The Motion Control knob can be uses to interpolate several parameters assigned to control knobs. Motion sequence adds modulation of realtine synthesis parameters with predefined sequences of controle events.\nSeamless sound switching allows the user to select a new program but have the held notes from previous program stil sound until release. This feature is available for programs consisting on up to 8 individual parts.\nLED strips were added alongside control sliders and realtine control knowst to indicate the current value of assigned parameter.\n\n\n=== MODX ===\n\nIn 2017, two entry-level variants were introduced, 61-key FSX action MODX6 and 88-key BHS action MODX8. They come with halved polyphony for AWM2 and FM-X engines, half of user sample ROM, 4 knobs and sliders instead of 8, seamless switching for 4-part programs, and less buttons.\n\n\n=== MODX+ ===\nMODX6+ and MODX8+ were released in 2022, increasing maximum FM-X polyphony to 128 and user ROM size to 1.75 GBytes, same as the Montage.\n\n\n=== MONTAGE M ===\n\nReleased in October 2023 in three versions, FSX action 61-key Montage M6 and 76-key Montage M7, and new GEX action Montage M8x. \nAWM2 polyphony is increased to 128+128 notes for preset user data and user wave data. Preset wave ROM is increased to 10.2 GBytes (compressed with LPC-derived algorythm) and user ROM to 3.75 GBytes.\nVirtual analog AN-X sound engine with 16 note polyphony, an enhanced version of Yamaha AN1x.\nThe GEX balanced hammer keyboard action supports polyphonic aftertoch, implemented with Hall sensors.\nThe user interface is revamped with the addition of a secondary monochrome display for realtime editing, six rotary knobs under the main display, and rearrangement of buttons.\nThe keyboard contro section adds portamento control and parameter hold for the ribbon controller which has 5 LED-backlit zones.\nA VSTi softsynth version named Expanded Softwynth Plug-in (E.S.P.) is available as a digital download for owners of the Montage M.\n\n\n== See also ==\nKorg Nautilus\nRoland Fantom\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nYamahaSynth.com",

        "content": "Willa Holt Wakefield (November 9, 1870 – June 3, 1946) was an American vaudeville performer. Wakefield told stories and recited in the \"pianologue\" style, and was billed as \"the Lady of Optimism\".\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nWilla Holt was born in Cuthbert, Georgia, the daughter of Peyton Robert Holt and Harriet (Hattie) Missouri Platt Holt. Her father was a pharmacist and a Confederate States Army veteran of the American Civil War. She studied piano with Theodor Leschetizky.\n\n\n== Career ==\nWakefield taught school as a young woman. She was a pianologue on the vaudeville stage in the 1910s and 1920s. Her act featured sentimental, patriotic, humorous and nostalgic stories, recitations, and songs, presented with \"elegance, refinement, self-control, and dignity\". \"She is quite the pleasantest entertainer one could wish for,\" noted a Detroit critic in 1909. In a 1917 interview, she explained her choice of material, saying \"We very often move in a veritable mental mist in this sad old grumbling world, a thick mist of prejudice and irritability and hyper sensitiveness--and so we become more and more hypercritical ourselves. Yet, after all, it is a mist that can be easily dispelled by thrilling beams of mental sunshine.\" Holt was promoted as a rival to the equally popular but more risqué entertainer Eva Tanguay. She performed in England in 1913.\nWakefield had a reputation for making shrewd investments, and owned a farm on Long Island as well as a home on New York's Riverside Drive. She also performed on radio programs.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nWakefield married Vienna-born sculptor Arnold Frederick Foerster in 1915; they divorced in 1936. She died in 1946, in Los Angeles, at the age of 75.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ove Almborn (30 July 1914 – 6 March 1992) was a Swedish lichenologist and educator. Born in Ronneby, Sweden, Almborn grew up in an environment that nurtured his early interest in botany and lichens. His early academic interests and discoveries in new lichens inspired his doctoral dissertation, which focused on the distribution and ecology of lichens in South Scandinavia. After graduating from Lund University, he was employed at its department of systematic botany, initially as a senior lecturer and later as the curator of the botanical collections at its botanical garden.\nAlmborn's research advanced the understanding of lichen funga in southern Scandinavia and Southern Africa. 'Funga' refers to the fungal components of these ecosystems. He conducted extensive fieldwork and published numerous papers on the subject that contributed to the knowledge of lichen biogeography and ecology. He also edited the Lichenes Africani exsiccata series and authored multiple studies on African lichens. Almborn profoundly impacted his students' careers and personal growth through dedicated mentorship. He was known for his extensive botanical literature collection and his supportive mentorship of students in systematic botany.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nOve Almborn was born on 30 July 1914 in Ronneby, located in the southeastern Swedish province of Blekinge. Almborn's fascination with botany began in his youth in Ronneby. Bertil Hedvall introduced Ove Almborn to lichenology, sparking his interest in the subject during high school in the nearby city of Karlskrona. Almborn attended Lund University in 1933. In university, he studied chemistry, zoology, and botany.\n\nAlmborn's first contribution to the lichenological literature was a 1935 publication exploring the lichen biodiversity occurring on the historic Lund Cathedral. Influenced significantly by Gunnar Degelius and other figures from the Uppsala circle led by Gustaf Einar Du Rietz, Almborn's doctoral thesis in 1948 reflected the Uppsala school's approach to plant ecology and phytosociology, focusing on the distribution and ecology of certain lichens in southern Scandinavia. His academic journey led him to discover unique lichens and inspired his doctoral dissertation on the distribution and ecology of South Scandinavian lichens. His findings hinted at broader applications for conservation efforts.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAfter obtaining his degree in 1936, Almborn was appointed as a docent at Lund University. His research during this period focused on exploring the lichen funga of Southern Africa. Despite facing challenges during his thesis defence due to a pollen allergy, he passed with commendable remarks.\n\n\n=== Academic and field research ===\nIn 1955, Almborn conducted a study of the lichens on the island of Hallands Väderö. This research not only helped document the ecological diversity of the island but also set the stage for his future explorations and contributions to the understanding of lichen funga in various regions.\nAlmborn's research in Southern Africa began in 1953, funded by a grant from the Swedish Natural Science Research Council. There, he broadened understanding of the region's lichen populations and fostered international collaborations. During his first trip, he explored and collected lichen specimens in South Africa and Mozambique. He returned in 1983–84 to gather more material, further enriching his research. Between 1956 and 1991, Almborn edited 150 issues of the Lichenes Africani exsiccata series, and authored multiple additional studies on African lichens.\nFrom 1954 to 1966, Almborn balanced his role as a high school teacher in Malmö with his passion for lichenology, contributing to the field through various publications and research. His dedication to education was evident in his efforts to integrate research with teaching. Much of his spare time during this period was spent building up collections of lichens.\n\n\n=== Educational contributions ===\n\nIn 1966, Almborn became the curator of the herbarium at the Lund University Botanical Museum, where he furthered his contributions to botany and lichenology, maintaining high standards and fostering international collaboration. He was known for his extensive collection of botanical literature and for mentoring students with a supportive and systematic approach.\nIn the late 1940s, Hans Runemark worked on the yellow species of the crustose lichen genus Rhizocarpon, with Ove Almborn as his supervisor.\nIn 1971, Almborn met Ingvar Kärnefelt. He subsequently became Kärnefelt's supervisor, guiding his graduate studies. Kärnefelt eventually established his own career as a renowned lichenologist.\nOve Almborn was celebrated not only for his pioneering research in lichenology but also for his profound impact as a mentor. His approach to mentorship personalized the academic experience, recognizing and nurturing the unique strengths and interests of each student. This commitment to individual growth is exemplified by his relationship with Ingvar Kärnefelt, one of his notable graduate students. Kärnefelt fondly recalls their first meeting in 1970 as the beginning of a lifelong friendship and professional relationship, during which Almborn guided him through the complexities of lichenology with encouragement and expert insight. Through field trips, international collaborations, and informal gatherings, Almborn created a supportive academic community that not only built scientific acumen but also fostered personal development, leaving a lasting legacy on many who passed through Lund University's botanical department.\nAlmborn retired in 1980, although he kept active in lichenology, and published several dozen papers after his retirement. Despite his extensive research on the genera Pertusaria and Teloschistes, Almborn was unable to see these projects to their completion. Nevertheless, his interim contributions in 1989 and 1992 considerably advanced scientific understanding of these groups.\n\n\n== Personal ==\nEarly in his career, Almborn forged connections with an extensive network of peers, gaining international recognition as a lichenologist. He was a frequent attendee at academic conferences, where he relished the social ambiance of congress dinners and similar gatherings. His stories of venerable botanists captivated and amused his colleagues, adding a personal touch to his scholarly presence. David Galloway wrote of him: \"A figure of impressive physical dimension and deportment he was rather stately but gentle and very kindly in manner. Always the sartorially correct, courteous gentleman, he could at times be a devastatingly funny raconteur and he had a well-developed almost \"English\" sense of humour which was allowed to flash from time to time to illuminate an at times rather forbidding exterior.\"\nAlmborn, a private individual, died alone in his home in Lund on 6 March 1992. His research and dedicated mentorship advanced the field of lichenology and the botanical community at Lund University. He is remembered for his kindness, generosity, and the lasting influence of his scientific endeavors. Almborn was deeply interested in botanical literature, and his collection, which included most of the published works of Carl Linnaeus, was described by Kärnefelt as \"one of the best in the world\". Almborn donated his extensive lichenological library and personal collections to the Botanical Museum in Lund.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nOve Almborn's legacy in the field of lichenology is marked by his extensive research, substantial contributions to botanical literature, and mentorship of future scientists. His meticulous studies, particularly on the lichen flora of southern Scandinavia and southern Africa, significantly advanced the understanding of these ecosystems. His doctoral research became a foundational work, particularly influencing the 'Endangered lichens in southern Sweden' project conducted from 1987 to 1996, providing baseline data crucial for monitoring and protecting lichen biodiversity in the region.\nAlmborn was a prolific contributor to lichenological literature, writing about 100 reviews that critically evaluated emerging research and recent publications, and helped guide the discipline's development. His insights helped shape the field, ensuring rigorous academic standards and fostering a scholarly dialogue among his peers.\nBeyond his scientific contributions, Almborn's dedication to the botanical community at Lund University was evident in his generous donations. He bequeathed his extensive lichenological library and personal collections to the Botanical Museum at Lund University. This act not only enriched the museum's holdings but also secured a valuable resource for ongoing and future botanical research. His donation included most of the published works of Carl Linnaeus, making it one of the world's premier collections of botanical literature. Through these contributions, Almborn left a lasting imprint on lichenology and botanical studies, ensuring that his influence would continue to be felt long after his passing.\n\n\n=== Eponyms ===\nIn 1981, Theodore Esslinger named the lichen genus Almbornia after Almborn, describing him as the \"foremost student of South African lichens\"; the genus has since been subsumed into Xanthoparmelia. Several lichenologists dedicated the genus Ovealmbornia (family Teloschistaceae) to him in 2009, noting his extensive contributions to the knowledge of African lichen flora. Several species have also been named to honour Almborn. These include: Diploschistes almbornii C.W.Dodge (1964); Parmelia almbornii Hale (1971); Collema almbornii Degel. (1974); Rinodina almbornii H.Mayrhofer (1984); Caloplaca almbornii Kärnefelt (1987); Lithothelium almbornii R.C.Harris & Aptroot (1991); Neofuscelia almbornii Henssen (1992); Psora almborniana Lumbsch & Kothe (1993); Micarea almbornii Coppins (1999); and Xanthoparmelia ovealmbornii A.Thell, Feuerer, Elix & Kärnefelt (2006).\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\nKärnefelt provides a complete list of all of Almborn's 141 scientific publications from 1935 to 1992 in his 1994 obituary.

        "content": "Dilofos railway station (Greek: Σιδηροδρομική Στάση Δίλοφος, romanized: Sidirodromiki stasi Dilofos) is a small unstaffed\nrailway station that serves the village of Dikaia, Evros, in Eastern Macedonia and Thrace, Greece. Located just north of the settlement, Today Hellenic Train operates just two daily regional trains to Alexandroupoli.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe railway was an important link during World War I as the Ottoman Empire, Bulgaria, and Austria-Hungary were all Central Allies. After the Ottoman Empire's defeat, its remaining imperial possessions were divided. The sections from Alexandroupoli to Svilengrad, except for a short section of about 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) in Turkey serving Edirne Karaagaç station and for 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) between the Greek border and Svilengrad station in Bulgaria come under the control of the French-Hellenic Railway Company (CFFH), a subsidiary of the CO, when the CFFH was incorporated in July 1929.\nUnder the Treaty of Lausanne of 1923, a new border between Greece and Turkey was established at the Evros river, just east of Ftelia railway station, which had the result that the railway from Istanbul to Bulgaria entered Greece at Pythio, then re-entered Turkey at Edirne (Karaağaç railway station), re-entered Greece at Marasia, and finally entered Bulgaria between Ormenio and Svilengrad.  This arrangement continued until 1971 when two new lines were opened. In Turkey, the Edirne Cut-off was opened to allow trains from Istanbul to Bulgaria to run through Edirne entirely on Turkish territory so that trains such as the Orient Express no longer passed through Feres. In Greece, a line was opened to allow trains from Pythio to Bulgaria to stay on Greek territory and avoid Edirne. In 1954 the CFFH was absorbed by the Hellenic State Railways. In 1971, the Hellenic State Railways was reorganised into the OSE taking over responsibilities for most for Greece's rail infrastructure.\nIn the 1990s, OSE introduced the InterCity service to the Alexandroupoli–Svilengrad line Which reduced travel times across the whole line.\nin 2017, limerted works where carreid out at the station, the buildings where painted, and the platform was paved.\nIn 2020 it was announced that the section of line between Pythio and Ormenio was to be upgraded, at the cost of €1.4 million as part of an ambitious integrated intergovernmental transport plan which will see this, and 39 other transport sector projects be built, with financing from the European Commission with a total of €117 million. The package of measures aims to build or improve transport connections and connectivity across Europe, with a focus on sustainable transport. The project for the Pythian-Ormenio section envisions upgrading the existing line infrastructure and trackbed, doubling of the track as well as the installation of electrification signalling (ETCS Level 1) along the entire stretch, with the aim of improving freight transport with Bulgaria and Turkey.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\nThe station is housed in its original station building, however this is now closed. Adjoining it is a later 1970s building that houses a waiting shelter. Beside this, the station has no other facilities. The platform, which is long for this region, has no outside seating, Dot-matrix display departure and arrival screens, nor timetable poster boards for passenger information; the station remains little more than an unstaffed halt.\n\n\n== Services ==\nAs of 2020, the stop is only served by one daily pair of regional trains Alexandroupoli–Ormenio. There are currently no services to Svilengrad.\n\n\n== Line layout ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Grace Oluchi Mbah (born 22 January 1994) is a climate change activist. She co-founded the Climate Action Africa (CAA) on July 14, 2021, with Chukwuemeka Fred Agbata. It is a non-government and non-profit organization that focuses on addressing the climate issues in Africa and beyond. The organization partners with institutions, professional associations, government, civil society organizations, business owners and individuals to enhance strategies for innovative practices on sustainable environment and development of Africa for all.\nThe organization organizes learning spaces for children to know about climate change and start early to be the change agent for a friendly environment. Climate change has become a global discussion with strategies for saving humans and other species of living things therein. The warning on global warming has created impacts that led to the redesigning of how to shape the environment and create the world we want with control of the temperature and weather patterns.\n\n\n== Education and early life ==\nGrace has a B.Sc. in Banking and Finance. She also has an MBA in Business Management.\n\n\n== Activities ==\nGrace's career in activism on climate change stemmed from the effects of loss, destruction of life and property, damage to agricultural products and the issues of the waste of resources due to global warming in Nigeria. Even though, climate change is a natural phenomenon, Grace and her team carry out sensitization and advocacy and build partnerships with the indication that not attending to climate change will have a resultant effect on health, agriculture, environment, economy, society and all aspects of human endeavor. According to Grace, “Nigeria’s vulnerability to climate change necessitates immediate and collective action. Through this partnership, we aspire to harness the power of innovation, sustainable practices, policy dialogue, and community engagement to reshape Nigeria’s future and set a global example.” They develop ideation and provide facilities on climate change.\nThey launched Climate Action Africa Labs (CAA Labs) which created an innovation that supports the development of the climate-tech startup ecosystem in Africa. Collaborating with the government, researchers, scientists, and experts, the CAA Labs addressed the changing climate issues, and evidence-based policy decisions on the continent support the translation of research discoveries as well as climate-tech organizations and startups in developing sustainable solutions.\nGrace with her team under Climate Action Africa established and launched Climate Stories 4 Kids. This is focused on educating and nurturing children and young adults to be aware of climate change and to begin early to protect their communities. It is a “catch them young ”initiative with audio-visual and digital viewing content. The project targets one million young minds across the world with designed fiction on climate change based on real-life settings. According to the Director, “Our children are the future stewards of this planet. When we make climate education exciting and accessible, we empower them to take charge of their environmental destiny and become advocates for change. That is exactly what we are doing.” The Climate Stories 4 Kids series is meant to be aired on radio and TV stations. The idea of children and young adults knowing climate change rhymes with the UNICEF concern that children are affected by access to water, health, education, food security and well-being. The essence is that climate change can be mitigated if safety and knowledge are enhanced.\nAgain, the report by the African Child Forum stated that “almost 1 billion children – nearly half of the world’s children – live in countries that are at extremely high risk of climate change impacts. Climate change has direct and indirect impacts on children’s rights to health, life, dignity and education. Also, climate change increases the risk of exposure to violence against children. Climate-induced disasters displace people, and limit access to schools, adequate water, and nutrition.” Hence effective direction towards climate change with children will probably have a good effect on controlling the ecosystem.\nGrace participated in the Africa Climate Summit in Kenya focused on tackling climate issues in Africa, from 4 to 6 September 2023 at the Kenyatta International Convention Center (KICC) in Nairobi, Kenya. This summit was attended by other climate activists, government personnel and other stakeholders. The Africa Climate Summit of 2023 provided a platform for policymakers, practitioners, businesses and civil society that caused interactions on climate solutions, challenges and strategies as well as opportunities achieved in different regions. This led to the first global stocktaking that was concluded at the COP28 in UAE in December 2023. Grace signed a memorandum of associations (MoU), collaborated and participated in climate change events for creating a friendly environment in Nigeria in 2024 in Abuja.\nIn March 2024, Climate Action Africa under the leadership of Grace Mbah announced its program Climate Action Africa Forum 2024 (CAAF24) with the theme “Green Economies, Brighter Futures: Innovating and Investing in Africa’s Climate-Smart Development.” She stated, “It’s no news that the world stands at a critical juncture, where decisive action is imperative to mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change.\" The rainy season in Nigeria seems to have been doubled with heavy downpour. It becomes imperative that spaces are created for organizations, government, individuals, and volunteers to effectively deliberate and take decisive steps in saving our planet from harsh climate conditions. Climate change in Nigeria is critical as the nation has witnessed damages across the states, hence the need for collaboration with other stakeholders outside the government to sustain the country with lasting results that will restore the environment.\n\n\n== Achievement ==\nGrace co-established Climate Action Africa, an organization for strategizing resilience for climate change in July 2021.\nGrace with her Team launched Climate Action Africa Labs (CMA Labs) to develop and support the climate-tech startup ecosystem in Africa.\nHer team established climate stories for kids in 2023.\nShe signed the memorandum of association (MoU) with the National Council on Climate Change (NCCC) on tackling the challenges of climate change in Nigeria in February 2024.\nShe participated in the Africa Climate Summit in Kenya on solving issues of climate in Africa in 2023.\nShe, with her group, planned the Climate Action Africa Forum 2024 (CAAF24) for greater impacts on climate change in March 2024.\n\n\n== References ==",

The team were unsuccessful in this attempt but McIntosh later represented Hong Kong at the 1997 Rugby World Cup Sevens, in addition to seven appearances in the Hong Kong Sevens.\nAfter returning to New Zealand, McIntosh was appointed Director of High Performance Sport and Rugby at St Andrew's College, Christchurch, having previously served as head coach of Hong Kong in rugby sevens.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Hong Kong national rugby union players\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRodney McIntosh at ESPNscrum (stats may be incomplete)",

        "content": "Jaminton Enrique Intriago Alcívar is an Ecuadorian politician who currently serves as Assemblyman for the province of Manabí District 1.\n\n\n== Early years ==\nJaminton Intriago was born in the Flavio Alfaro canton, Manabí. He obtained his degree in agricultural engineering from the University of Havana, Cuba, where he specialized in topics related to agriculture and rural development.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nHis political career began in his native canton, Flavio Alfaro, where he was elected mayor for two terms. During his tenure, he focused on improving infrastructure and public services, as well as promoting agricultural development in the region.\nIn November 2023, Intriago was installed as an assembly member for the province of Manabí District 1, representing the Unidos Somos Más alliance, made up of the Social Christian Party and the provincial Caminantes movement. As an assemblyman, he has been a strong defender of food sovereignty and has worked to recover the agricultural sector of Manabí and the entire country.\nDuring his term as assemblyman, he chaired the Permanent Commission on Food Sovereignty and Development of the Agricultural and Fishing Sector, where he promoted legislative initiatives to strengthen the food sovereignty policy and support Ecuadorian farmers and fishermen.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\nIn 2013, he was investigated by the General State Prosecutor's Office for a crime of embezzlement related to the embezzlement of public funds intended for works in the Municipality of Flavio Alfaro. A 90-day investigation was ordered, although finally, in 2018, the criminal chamber of the Manabí Court of Justice declared him innocent.\nIn September 2022, his house was shot at by unknown persons. At that time, Intriago was in the United States and claimed not to have problems with anyone, ruling out that the incident had political motivations, since he would not participate as a candidate for mayor in any popular election in the 2023 sectional elections.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFlavio Alfaro Canton\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Brown River is a river in Tasman, New Zealand.\nThe source of the Brown River is near Brown Hill (elevation 1,104 metres or 3,622 feet) and the river flows north from the ridgeline adjacent to this hill. The Heaphy Track is on the south side of that ridgeline, with the river's source roughly halfway between Aorere Shelter and Flanagans Corner (the track's highest elevation). Near the Brown River's confluence with the Aorere River, the Heaphy Track crosses it via a bridge. Near this location is Brown Hut, which is near the start of the track at its Golden Bay / Mohua terminus.\nIn October 1856, James Mackay and John Clark explored the headwaters of the Aorere River. One night, they camped opposite a hill that they called \"Brownhill\" due to a large brown patch on it. The source does not state that Brown River got its name from Brown Hill, though.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of rivers of New Zealand\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Akhiru Golooba (born 23 September 2000), known professionally as Atta Soja, is a Ugandan heavyweight boxer born and raised in Kampala. Atta Soja is known for his impressive boxing technics he has expressed in the boxing sport since 2018.\n\n\n== Early life and background ==\nIn 2007, Atta Soja started his elementary education at Remah Junior school in Kampala. As a little boy, Golooba loved the boxing sport way back from school and he loved participating in boxing activities organized by the school. Later in 2016, Atta Soja joined Kampala senior secondary school for his ordinary level education. As a sportsman, he balanced his education and studies until he completed his form four class of education with an O'Level certificate of completion from Uganda National Examinations Board. Atta loved the boxing sport even at school as he always participated in boxing events organized by Kampala senior scondary school. He developed great passion for the boxing sport and started professional training in a local gym in Naakulabye coached and guided by Lawrence Kalyango famously known as Coach Lora.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAkhiru Golooba started fighting at a young age of 8, fending off the thieves and bullies in Kampala. Atta beat up every one until he made out his way to a legitimate gym in Naakulabye where the older veteran boxers took notice of the tough kid whose shadowboxing looked so fluid and natural day by day. Atta's father never wanted him to do boxing as he kept changing him to homes which are distant to the gym but the little boy never gave up on his dream of being a professional boxer. He started spending all his time at the gym working out tirelessly and all his tough upfights and trainings have turned Golooba into a hard working professional boxer.\nAtta Soja has faced and won different amateur boxing championships and of late, he was emerged as winner of the Great strikers event organized at the New Obligato in Kampala on 9 March 2024. Atta had a few amateur fights before turning professional. He has always been trained and coached by Lawrence Kalyango who has brought up many different talents like the US-based pro Ismail Muwendo, Dubai-based pro Joshua Nyanzi, former multiple National champion Yusuf Babu, 2019 African Games silver medalist Isaac Masembe and former national captain Rogers Ssemitala.\nOn 9 March 2024, Atta Soja with the help of Tokyo Olympic boxer Shadir Musa Bwogi as his agent and Lawrence Kalyango as his coach knocked down fellow debutant Ronald Kisakye early in the second round in one of the undercards on Great Strikers event at New Obligato.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nAtta Soja is in a public relationship with Vivian Nuwahereza, the couple does not have any children together. Vivian has always been spotted in the training gym holding pads for spouse Atta and she is also a common presence in his dressing room before his fight.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Viscounts of Azpa were the rulers of the Viscountcy of Azpa. The Viscountcy takes its name from the town of Azpa, a locality and council located in the municipality of Valle de Egüés, in Navarre province, Spain. The Viscountcy of Azpa is a hereditary Spanish noble title granted by the Kings of Spain in the mid 16th century to the Medrano family in Navarre who were later granted the title Marquess of Fontellas.\n\n\n== List of Viscounts of Azpa ==\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAzpa is situated at the southeastern tip of the Egüés Valley and is the final locality accessible via national road 150. Azpa holds significant historical interest and boasts an ancient lordship attached to the Medrano family, with remnants of its noble past still visible. The town is home to the palace of the Viscount of Azpa and Marquis of Fontellas, a family noted for Don Jaime Vélaz de Medrano's involvement in the historic battle of Amaiur-Maya in 1522. \n\nAt the entrance of Azpa is a building known as The Palace, which forms a horizontal block, with a semicircular arch as the entrance and a baroque shield on the facade. Carlos Vélaz de Medrano was once the lord of the palaces and pechas of Azpa and Mendillori. The palace of Azpa appears as a corporal of armory on the official payroll of the Kingdom. Azpa is located 16km east of Pamplona. The palace of Azpa belonged in 1631 to Alonso Vélaz de Medrano y Navarra, III Viscount of Azpa, whose guardian, on his behalf, brought a lawsuit in the chamber over the rebate of the barracks. In those years, the firstborn of the Medrano lineage already bore the title of viscounts of Azpa.\n\n\n=== II Viscount ===\nOn 6 August 1604, Deputy Alonso Vélaz de Medrano, II Viscount of Azpa, served as the military representative in the Deputation of the Kingdom, where he played a key role in representing the interests of the crown and military. He married a Lady from the royal House of Navarra, a minor branch of the House of Évreux, from the French Capetain dynasty.\n\n\n=== III Viscount ===\nAlonso Velaz de Medrano y Navarra, III Viscount of Azpa married María de Ripalda y Ayanz de Ureta and together they had 8 children in Azpa. On 27 December 1642, Alonso Vélaz de Medrano y Navarra was representing the university Deputation of the Kingdom. María de Ripalda was the daughter of Luis de Ripalda and María Ayanz de Ureta. Luis de Ripalda's parents were Luis Ripalda and Agueda Amatriain. Luis de Ripalda, later known as the Count of Ripalda, married María Sebastián. María Sebastián's father was Salvador Sebastián, who was the uncle of Luis Sebastián y Donamaría, the lord of Iriberri.\n\n\n=== IV and V Viscount ===\nJosé Velaz de Medrano y Navarra, IV Viscount of Azpa and Lord of Mendillori married Ana María de Larrea Zunzarren, also known as Lady Beunza Larrea, who lived from around 1660 to 1711. Together, they had two children:\n\nJosépha Velaz de Medrano y Larrea, (b. 1685 Peralta - 1711 in Irunea), who married Francisco Argaiz Galdeano VI\nJoaquin Velaz de Medrano y Larrea, V Viscount of Azpa, born around 1690 in Irunea.\nJosé Velaz de Medrano y Navarra held several prestigious titles, including IV Viscount of Azpa and Lord of Autol and Mendillorri. He was also the Owner of the Entailed Estate and Palaces of Cape of Arms of Beunza-Larrea and Ripalda. On 28 February 1692 José Vélaz de Medrano, Viscount of Medrano, IV Viscount of Azpa, was a representative of the Military Deputation. On 16 December 1699 José Vélaz de Medrano, Viscount of Azpa replaced Juan Ventura de Arizcun, Viscount of Arbeloa in the University Deputation. \nDon José was the lord of Mendillori and the town of Autol in the 18th century. In 1716, José's daughter Doña María Francisca Vélaz de Medrano was married to Gabriel Cano de Aponte, Royal Governor of Chile from 1717 to 1733. José Vélaz de Medrano, Viscount of Azpa, Lord of Autol, was noted for his claim against the Deputation of the Kingdom, regarding payment of 508 ducats for the expenses of a trip to Madrid.\n\n\n=== VI Viscount ===\n\nJoaquín Vélaz de Medrano was the 6th Viscount of Azpa, lord of Mendillorri, Buenzalarrea, labaso, Amalain, Villanuevo, Autol, Yerga, etc.\nOn 23 March 1726, Don Joaquín Vélaz de Medrano, Viscount of Azpa served as the university representative in the Deputation of the Kingdom alongside Don Elías Íñiguez de Medrano. On 29 October 1749, Don Joaquin Velaz de Medrano, Viscount of Azpa and lord of the town of Autol, residing in the city of Pamplona, outlined the legitimacy of his claim in the lawsuit under review by the council. This legal dispute involves the Lords Prosecutors, along with the local council, judiciary, regiment, and residents of the town, regarding the return of the town of Autol, including its jurisdiction, lordship, and vassalage, to the Crown.\nAmong the 20 council members repeatedly elected in Pamplona, Joaquín Vélaz de Medrano, Viscount of Azpa was particularly notable, serving 8 times as a councilor and 12 times as a mayor of the borough of San Cernin.\nA legal dispute was initiated on 23 May 1748 by Joaquín Vélaz de Medrano y Puelles, Viscount of Azpa and Lord of Autol (La Rioja), residing in Pamplona, against the Autol council. The case pertains to the enforcement and collection of rights over the produce obtained from the mountain named Segrero.\n\n\n=== VII Viscount ===\nDon José Joaquín Vélaz de Medrano y Gante  became the 7th Viscount of Azpa, and was granted the title of 1st Marquess of Fontellas, 1st Viscount of Amaláin.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nOn November 11, 1980, the Undersecretary's office issued a resolution announcing that José Velaz de Medrano y Echevarría had applied for the succession to the title of Viscount of Azpa. This application was made in accordance with Article 10 of the Royal Decree 602/1980 dated March 21, 1980. The vacancy arose following the death of Joaquín Velaz de Medrano y Alava. The announcement stated that there would be a thirty-day period from the date of publication for any claims or applications related to the title, in line with the Royal Decree of May 27, 1912. This was to ensure that those who believe they have a right to the title could present their case. The notice was signed by the Undersecretary, Arturo Romani Biescas, in Madrid.\n\n\n== References ==",
