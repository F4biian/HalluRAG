        "content": "Guillermo Galiardo Armijo (1876 – 16 August 1950) was a Spanish footballer who played as a midfielder for RCD Espanyol. He also played a few unofficial matches for FC Barcelona.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\nGuillermo Galiardo was born in 1876 in Granada, but it was in Barcelona where he began to play football, being one of the pioneers of RCD Espanyol, since he was always present in the entity's squads from its foundation until 1911. He was one of the main strongholds of the club during Espanyol's first decade of existence, being thus named into the club's best starting eleven of the 1900s. He was a player respected by his teammates, a basic part of the team and, according to the testimony of Julià Clapera, he was a midfielder who charged with remarkable toughness, and who amused himself by practicing aiming with a ball kicked against the steam train that was circulating along the d'Aribau street. His brother Arturo also played in the team, but with much less prominence.\nTogether with Ángel Ponz, Joaquim Carril, Emilio Sampere, and Gustavo Green, he was part of the team that won the third edition of the Copa Macaya in 1902–03, the club's first-ever piece of silverware, playing 5 matches, and which then won the first edition of the Catalan championship in 1903–04, playing 8 matches. \nGaliardo remained loyal to the club until 1905, when Español had to suspend its activities, and most of the remaining players, including him, Sampere, Ponz, and goalkeeper Pedro Gibert, joined X Sporting Club, and together with them, plus the Massana brothers (Santiago and Alfredo) and José Irízar, he helped X win the 1905–06 Catalan championship. He then decided to return to Barcelona, where he played two unofficial matches for FC Barcelona]] in April 1906, the first against Athletic Club (1–0) and the second against San Sebastián Recreation Club (1–3). In 1909, following a 3-year hiatus, Espanyol was finally and effectively relaunched, so Galiardo then played with Espanyol for two more years until 1911.\n\n\n== International career ==\nOn 24 September 1903, Galiardo participated in a test match between a white and a red team made up of players who were playing in Barcelona, which was meant to decide who would integrate the first team of the Catalonia national team the following year.\n\n\n== Death ==\nGaliardo died in Malaga on 16 August 1950, at the age of either 73 or 74.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nRCD Espanyol\n\nCopa Macaya:\nChampions: 1902–03\nCopa Barcelona:\nRunner-up: 1902–03\nCatalan Championships:\nChampions: 1903–04\n\n\n== References ==",

He began his football career at Barakaldo CF, and from there he made the jump to Sporting de Gijón, then a Segunda División team, where he played as a left midfielder, and participated in 17 games in the 1930–31 season and nine in the Regional Championship of Asturias in 1931–32. That season, just before the start of La Liga, he signed for Arenas de Getxo in the First Division, where he stayed for two years, in which he played 18 games and scored two goals.\nIn 1933, Villagrá signed for Valencia CF, thus becoming the first Argentine player to do so. Like any good Argentine, Villagrá was an intense and aggressive player, who took contact to the limit. He had a tremendous physical capacity, following the ball all over the field, recovering balls tirelessly, and at times it seemed like he was going to keep running even after the final whistle. He was also very versatile, and in fact, he became an all-rounder in his first two seasons, being able to play both as a winger and as a defender.\nAlthough he had few appearances, only 15 official matches in the first two years, he played a crucial role in helping Valencia reach its first Copa del Rey final in 1934, as he scored a second-half brace in the second leg of the semifinals against Real Oviedo in the Buenavista which put his side in the final against Real Madrid in Montjuïc on 6 May 1934, which he started in a 1–2 loss. He also won two Regional Championship of Valencia in 1934 and 1937.\nThe outbreak of the Spanish Civil War cut off his progress at Valencia. In total, he scored 2 goals in 45 league matches for Arenas and Valencia. Following the end of the war in 1939, Villagrá opted to join the UDLG (Levante-Gimático merger), where he formed a defensive partnership with José García-Nieto and where he retired in 1942, at the age of 35.\n\n\n== Managerial career ==\nAfter his career as a player ended, Villagrá remained linked to Levante UD, now as a coach, which he oversaw in two stages (1946–48 and 1951–52), the latter being an emergency solution during the 1951–52 academic year and ending in relegation to the Tercera División. He later coached UD Alzira for one season in 1959–60.\n\n\n== Death ==\nVillagrá died in Valencia on 18 February 1970, at the age of 62.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nValencia CF\nCopa del Rey:\n\nRunner-up (1) 1934\nValencia Championship:\n\nWinners (2) 1934 and 1937\n\n\n== References ==",

Transferring to the Bengal Sappers, he was attached to the 40th Pathans in 1945–1946. He further qualified as a paratrooper and following Indian independence and partition, was posted to the 20th Field Company of the Bombay Sappers, subsequently commanding the field company of the Parachute Brigade. Sharma then served as adjutant of the training battalion of the Bombay Sappers for three months in 1948 before receiving a posting as a Group Task Officer with a services selection board, returning as adjutant of the training battalion in 1950. \nOn 15 January 1964, Sharma was appointed a military attaché to the High Commission of India in Australia, with the local rank of colonel. He served in this capacity until 14 April 1967. On 8 May 1970, he was appointed Chief Engineer, Northern Zone with the acting rank of brigadier, and was awarded the Ati Vishisht Seva Medal (AVSM) in the 1971 Republic Day decorations list. \nOn 21 August 1973, Sharma was appointed Chief Engineer, Eastern Command. In 1979, he was appointed Engineer-in-Chief of the Indian Army, and was awarded the Param Vishisht Seva Medal (PVSM) in the 1981 Republic Day decorations list.

After a 3-year hiatus, the caravan returned to the United States in 2023 for its 50th anniversary. The caravan is supported by the Jewish National Fund. The goal of the caravan is to showcase Israeli culture and its cultural diversity and to strengthen the connection between Israeli and diaspora Jews.\nSome participants in the caravan later became celebrities in Israel, including singer Aya Korem, actress Rotem Abuhav, and journalist Yuna Leibzon.\n\n\n== Troupe ==\nThe caravan consists of three troupes of 10 16- and  17-year-old members of the Israel Boy and Girl Scouts Federation and two leaders, who travel across North America for 3 months over the summer each year, performing 45-minute concerts at Jewish summer camps, community centers, hospitals, nursing homes, and synagogues. The performances are in Hebrew, English, and Yiddish, and the signers dress in official scout uniforms, Middle Eastern clothing, and blue-and-white outfits.\nMembers of the caravan are chosen based on their performing talents, maturity, and English fluency. After selection for the caravan, they spend a year training and rehearsing.\nThe scouts stay at the homes of local Jewish families and synagogues, and community visits of the caravan are sponsored by the local Jewish federation,, Jewish community center, and Boy Scouts of America.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Goodenia trinervis is a species of flowering plant in the family Goodeniaceae and is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. It is a perennial herb with linear to spoon-shaped leaves at the base of the plant, yellow flowers on an ascending flower stem, and oval fruit.\n\n\n== Description ==\nGoodenia trinervis is a perennial herb with liner to spoon-shaped leaves at the base of the plant, 50–200 mm (2.0–7.9 in) long and 5–25 mm (0.20–0.98 in) wide, sometimes with toothed edges. The flowers are arranged on an ascending peduncle up to 400 mm (16 in) tall, with oblong to linear bracteoles up to 19 mm (0.75 in) long. The sepals are D-shaped to egg-shaped, 2.0–2.5 mm (0.079–0.098 in) long and the petals are yellowish-orange, 8–12 mm (0.31–0.47 in) long and reddish-brown in the throat. The fruit is an oval capsule 7 mm (0.28 in) long and 4 mm (0.16 in) wide containing spherical seeds about 2 mm (0.079 in) in diameter.\n\n\n== Taxonomy and naming ==\nThis species was first formally described in 1805 by Jacques Labillardière who gave it the name Velleia trinervis in his Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen. In 2020, Kelly Anne Shepherd transferred the species to Goodenia as G. trinervis in the journal PhytoKeys. The specific epithet trinervis means \"three-nerved\", referring to the leaves.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nThis goodenia often grows in damp places and occurs from north of Perth to near Esperance in the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie, Esperance Plains, Geraldton Sandplains, Jarrah Forest, Mallee, Swan Coastal Plain and Warren bioregions of south-western Western Australia.\n\n\n== Conservation status ==\nGoodenia trinervis is classified as \"not threatened\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Victoria Marie DellaPeruta (born March 21, 2004) is an Italian-American professional soccer player who plays as a forward for Serie A Femminile club UC Sampdoria. Born in the United States, she has represented the Italy national under-19 team. She began her club career with Pomigliano CF at age 17 and played college soccer for the North Carolina Tar Heels.\n\n\n== Early life and college career ==\nDellaPeruta was born in Atlanta, Georgia, to Barbara and Adam DellaPeruta, and has an older sister, Talia, who is also a soccer player. Her grandmother is from Pescara and her grandfather from Naples. She was originally a goalkeeper but moved to midfield at age five. She played club soccer for United Futbol Academy (UFA) of the Elite Clubs National League (ECNL) until age 12, then Tophat Soccer Club from 2018 to 2020, and UFA again from 2020 to 2022. She committed to the University of North Carolina as a high school freshman in 2019.\nDellaPeruta played her only year of high school soccer at West Forsyth High School as a junior in 2021, leading the team to a 19–2 record, and set a school record with 54 goals in one season. She scored the lone goal of the GHSA Class 7A final to beat undefeated Lambert and secure West Forsyth's first state title. She was recognized as a United Soccer Coaches All-American and the USA Today Girls Soccer Player of the Year. She graduated early from high school in December 2021, intending to enroll at North Carolina in the spring, but instead began looking to play in Italy when she received her Italian passport the same month.\n\n\n=== North Carolina Tar Heels, 2022–2023 ===\nAfter her stint with Pomigliano, DellaPeruta played two fall seasons for the North Carolina Tar Heels in 2022 and 2023. She had 8 goals in 19 starts and 40 appearances, missing a few games each year to play with the Italian youth national team. Her sister, Talia, was her teammate both seasons.\n\n\n== Club career ==\n\n\n=== Pomigliano, 2022 ===\nAfter high school but before college, 17-year-old DellaPeruta tried out for Serie A Femminile club Pomigliano during the 2021–22 season. She spoke little Italian and her coach and teammates little English, but she made the first team ten days into training. On her debut as a halftime substitute, she scored the 2–1 game winner against Empoli on January 22, 2022. She made her first start in a 1–0 win over Internazionale on March 6 and stayed in the starting lineup for the rest of the season. Pomigliano needed to win the last game of the season to prevent relegation and trailed Napoli at halftime on May 14 before DellaPeruta equalized to start a 3–1 comeback. She had four goals in nine appearances for the club.\n\n\n=== Sampdoria, 2024– ===\nFollowing her two years in college, DellaPeruta signed with UC Sampdoria of Serie A along with her sister, Talia. She made her debut as a late substitute against Como on January 14, 2024. On March 16, she entered the starting lineup and scored four goals in a 5–0 rout of Pomigliano, her former club.\n\n\n== International career ==\nDellaPeruta has United States and Italian citizenship. She was called into a virtual camp for the United States national under-18 team in 2021. After her stint at Pomigliano, she played for the Italian national under-19 team at the 2022 UEFA Women's Under-19 Championship. She was called up to the Italian under-23 team in September 2023.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nTori DellaPeruta at Soccerway",

        "content": "Juan \"John\" Budinich (1881 – 29 June 1945) was a former Chilean-born boxer and trainer who is recognized as the first Chilean professional boxer in boxing history.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nJohn Budinich was born in Coquimbo, Chile, in 1881 as Juan Budinich Taborga.\nJuan Budinich, a fourteen-year-old cadet at the Chilean Naval Academy, knocked out an older officer who had been harassing him. In 1895, he stowed away on a ship where he was introduced to boxing. The ex-Naval cadet returned to Chile and opened the country's first boxing academy in Santiago.\nIn 1900, he helped organize what would become the first professional boxing match in Chile featuring Americans Frank Jones and Joe Daly in Valparaiso.\n\n\n== Boxing career ==\nBudinich's pro boxing debut took place in 1902 in Santiago De Chile. \nBy 1905, he stowed away to the United States and in 1907, he defeated Tim Carey in his American pro debut.\nAfter a few fights, Budinich left the United States and went south to Panama. He fought multiple times in Colón before heading to Havana from 1910 to 1915. In 1910, Chilean John Budinich founded the first professional boxing academy in Cuba called Academia de Boxeo. He became Cuba's first boxing promoter and frequently staged boxing contests and headlined his own shows in Havana. In July 1910, he fought American Jack Ryan at the Payret Theatre. As it was reported in the United States media, the event was the first nationally publicized pro-fight in Cuba. Budinich's last fight in Cuba took place in 1915. He remained in Havana to oversee his academy until 1917, choosing to focus only on training and promotion. In 1917, he announced his departure and sold his gym.\nThe final professional bout for Budinich occurred in 1917 when he returned to Chile.\n\n\n== Death ==\nJohn Budinich died on July 29, 1945.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\nHonored with street name in Coquimbo.

It is the successor to the University of Paris Faculty of Law and is located in the 5th arrondissement of Paris, on the Place du Panthéon.\n\nIts motto, in Latin, is: \"Omnibus sapientia, unicuique excellentia\" (\"knowledge for all, excellence for each\").\nIt is the best law faculty in France, 6th in Europe and 18th in the world according to the QS Top universities ranking, ahead of the McGill University Faculty of Law or the University of Pennsylvania Law School.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1970, the Edgar Faure Act divided the law faculty of the University of Paris into the new universities of Paris-I, Paris-II, Paris-IX, Paris-X, Paris-XII and Paris-XIII.\nWhile the majority of economists in the law faculty (35 out of 41) chose Paris-I Panthéon-Sorbonne, the majority of lawyers (88 out of 108), including privatists, legal historians and a significant number of publicists, had decided to create a specialised university: Paris II Panthéon-Assas. Conversely, their colleagues opted for a multidisciplinary university by joining Paris I.\nThere is therefore a historical rivalry between the Sorbonne Law School (part of the Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne University) and the Law College of Paris (part of the Paris-Panthéon-Assas University).\n\n\n== Departments ==\nThe École de droit de la Sorbonne has four departments, all of which aim to train students in the law:\n\nthe Bachelor's Department\nMaster of Public Law Department\nMaster of Private Law Department\nMaster of International, European and Comparative Law Department\n\n\n== Campuses ==\nEDS courses are taught at a number of campuses, known as 'centres':\n\nthe Panthéon centre, a historic building that welcomes Masters students and houses the management offices\nthe Sorbonne centre, which hosts conferences for EDS students and 3rd year AES undergraduates\nthe Lourcine centre, for 2nd and 3rd year undergraduate students in particular\nthe Cassin centre, for 1st and 2nd year undergraduate students\nthe Pierre-Mendès-France centre, for 1st and 2nd year AES degree students\n\n\n== Research ==\nResearch is carried out by the Sorbonne's École doctorale de droit, the Sorbonne's Institut de recherche juridique, the Sorbonne's Institut de recherche en droit international et européen and the Sorbonne's Institut des sciences juridiques et philosophique.\n\nFrançois Luchaire: drafter of the Constitution of 4 October 1958, former member of the Constitutional Council and member of the French Resistance.\nRobert Badinter: Professor of law (1974-1994), then appointed professor emeritus.

        "content": "Bossall Hall is a historic building in Bossall, a village in North Yorkshire in England.\nA quadrangular castle was constructed in Bossall by Paulinus de Bossall in the 14th century, surrounded by a moat.  It was demolished in the early 17th century by Robert Belt, who constructed a new hall within the moat, probably reusing building materials from the castle.  It was partly rebuilt in the 18th century, and its external appearance now dates to this period; Historic England describes it as \"not outstanding\".  The building was grade II listed in 1953, and the site including the largely-intact moat was made a scheduled monument in 1993.  It was put up for sale in 2020, with a guide price of more than £2 million.\nThe house is built of brick, with an M-shaped tile roof.  There are two storeys and attics, a double-depth plan, eight bays, and rear service wings.  The doorway has a divided fanlight, the windows are sashes with flat brick arches, and in the attics are five dormers with casements.  There are two projecting chimney stacks flanked by small 17th-century casement windows with decorative brick pediments.  There are drainpipe heads dated 1726 and 1798.  Inside, there is an 18th-century wooden staircase, and wooden panelling in the central room, of similar date.\n\n\n== See also ==\nListed buildings in Buttercrambe with Bossall\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"Code of the Streets\" is a song by American hip hop duo Gang Starr from their fourth studio album Hard to Earn (1994). It was released as the third single from the album on May 17, 1994. It samples \"Little Green Apples\" by Monk Higgins, \"Synthetic Substitution\" by Melvin Bliss and \"Word From Our Sponsor\" by Boogie Down Productions.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\"Code of the Streets\" evolved from a 1992 song titled \"Wrongs of the World\", which was produced by Guru and featured in an investigative report on WWOR-TV called Crime Chronicles. When Gang Starr was working on Hard to Earn, DJ Premier asked Guru if they owned the rights to the song as he believed it would be a suitable addition for the album. The original version contained horns and a slightly different drum pattern, but still used the same lyrics. Guru changed the title to \"Code of The Streets\". For this reason, Premier remade the production of the song to create a \"morse code type scratch\"; he has stated, \"I reprogrammed the drums with just a little bit more of a skip, the way I do it, and you can tell a difference when you hear the Gang Starr version.\"\n\n\n== Composition ==\nThe instrumental contains \"somber\" strings, while lyrically Guru focuses on behavior in the streets and ghetto and comments on the state of the society.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nJason Birchmeier of AllMusic regarded \"Code of the Streets\" (along with the song \"Tonz 'O' Gunz\") as the best moments on Hard to Earn, describing them as \"two songs where Guru offers the type of social commentary that made Gang Starr so admirable in the first place.\" Tom Doggett of RapReviews praised the song's production for \"breathtaking work on the turntables.\"\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"Dwyck\" (stylized in all caps) is a song by American hip hop duo Gang Starr, released in 1992 as the lead single from their fourth studio album Hard to Earn (1994). It features American hip hop duo Nice & Smooth. The song samples \"Synthetic Substitution\" by Melvin Bliss, \"Funky for You\" and \"No Bones in Ice Cream\" by Nice & Smooth, and \"Step in the Arena\" by Gang Starr.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAfter Gang Starr worked with Nice & Smooth on the song \"Down the Line\", the latter collaborated the former to return a favor. They recorded \"Dwyck\" in a two-day session, during which rappers WC and Don Barron (from the hip hop group Masters of Ceremony) were also present. At the time, the artists thought Guru's verse was the weakest. DJ Premier recalled that on the first day, Smooth B recorded 20 takes of the line \"Yo Keithy E, I left my Phillie at home, do you have another?\" The next day, he performed his verse in one take.\n\"Dwyck\" was originally the B-side to \"Take It Personal\" by Gang Starr. Gang Starr did not expect the song to become as popular as it did. They remastered the song, and added the new version to their album Daily Operation at the request of Chrysalis Records. However, the label reneged on their promise to re-release the album, which was problematic as people were only buying Daily Operation for \"Dwyck\". Gang Starr eventually included the song in Hard to Earn so it would still appear on one of their albums.\nThe title of the song originated from a trending joke started by rapper Biz Markie, in which a person would attract someone else's attention and show themselves grabbing their penis while saying \"Dwyck!\"\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nTom Doggett of RapReviews considered \"Dwyck\" the best song from Hard to Earn and \"one of the truly great party starters from the early nineties\". He further wrote of the song, \"The stripped-down production consists of only drums and a bassline, which allows the artists to take the spotlight in each verse, which they do. Smooth B's subdued rhymes in the third verse stand out the most, though Greg Nice and Guru do their thing as well. The most unforgettable part of the song, though, is Primo's turntable wizardry between verses, a breathtaking display from a true master.\"\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Tafraout Group (Also \"Tafraoute Group\" or  Zaouiat Ahançal Group) is a geological group of formations of Toarcian-Aalenian (Lower Jurassic-Middle Jurassic) age in the Azilal, Béni-Mellal, Imilchil, Zaouiat Ahansal, Ouarzazate, Tinerhir and Errachidia areas of the High Atlas of Morocco.  The Group represents the remnants of a local massive Siliciclastic-Carbonate platform (\"Tafraout Platform\"), best assigned to succession W-E of alluvial environment occasionally interrupted by shallow marine incursions (tidal flat setting) and inner platform to open marine settings, and marks a dramatic decrease of the carbonate productivity under increasing terrigenous sedimentation.  Fossils include large reef biotas with richness in \"lithiotid\" bivalves and coral mounts (\"Patch reef\", Tafraout Formation), but also by remains of vertebrates such as the sauropod Tazoudasaurus and the basal ceratosaur Berberosaurus, along with several undescribed genera. While there have been attributions of its lowermost layers to the Latest Pliensbachian, the current oldest properly measured are part of the Earliest Toarcian regression (\"MRST10\"), part of the Lower-Middle Palymorphum biozone.  This group is composed of the following units, which extend from west to east: the Azilal Formation (continental to subtidal, including its synonyms the \"Wazzant Formation\" and the \"Continental Series of Toundoute\"); the Amezraï Formation (intertidal environment); the Aguerd-nˈTazoult Formation (intertidal environment); the Tagoudite Formation (including the \"Tamadout Formation\", shallow subtidal to open pelagic) & the Trafraout Formation (deposited in a subtidal to inner platform environment). They are connected with the offshore Ait Athmane Formation and the deeper shelf deposits of the Agoudim 1 Formation. Overall, this group represents a mixed carbonate-siliciclastic system of several hundred meters thick, dominated by deposits of shallow marine platforms linked to a nearby hinterland dominated by conglomerates.  The strata of the group extend towards the central High Atlas, covering different anticlines and topographic features along the mountain range.\nThe after-effects of the Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event are also very present in the marginal marine strata of the Tafraout Group, with  the Toksine Section recording a dramatic collapse on the scale of the Tethys of the neritic carbonate system.\n\n\n== Geology ==\n\nThe Central High Atlas of Morocco is part of a double-vergent mountain belt that originated due to Cenozoic shortening and inversion of a rift that developed between the Triassic-Jurassic periods. Its geometry is distinctive due to the presence of several ENE–WSW narrow rift basins, derived from four major tectonic phases: pre-rift, that was linked with the Hercynian Orogeny and the union of Pangea in the Paleozoic;  syn-rift, that was developed mostly between the Late Permian-Late Triassic with several NE–SW to ENE–WSW rift-basins, al derived from the almost coeval opening of the Atlantic Ocean and Tethys Sea. This rift-derived basins ended filled with continental siliciclastic sediments, and latter towards the Rhaetian stage of the Triassic affected by emissions of the Central Atlantic magmatic province. It was on the so-called Post-rift phase that the local tectonics had a thermal relaxation and allowed the deposition of the Jurassic-Cretaceous carbonate platforms. The structure of the High Atlas can be defined by two main groups of faults, thrust and oblique-slip faults, that occur from W-E to NE-SW. The presence of tectonic inversion in the Atlas Mountains has shown that are an intracontinental mountain belts that appeared from the uplift of pre-existing rift systems, where here is represented by a major rift system (~2000 km) originated on the Mesozoic, that was later uplifted and inverted in the Cenozoic. The impact and convergence movements of the African-Iberian plates after the Mesozoic end with an inversion of the previous deposited strata, transporting the sediments of that and forming new low angle thrusts.  Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous strata are confined within basins controlled by the extensional structures of the Mesozoic rift. The Jurassic basins can be grouped into two main provinces located on either side of an emerged Massif Ancien: west, where the basin was open to the Early Atlantic, being related to its passive margin, and east with several epicontinental troughs connected to the Tethys Ocean. Across the Toarcian-Bajocian strata, there was a great deposition of marine shales as marls, calciturbidites and reefal limestones were accumulated in the E Central High Atlas, while on the west margin around the Massif Ancien terrestrial, specially fluvial sedimentation dominated. The present Red Beds of Azilal and the yonger marls of Bin el Ouidane indicate various marine oscillations across the Toarcian-Bajocian boundary, ending its sedimentation with the major Bathonian redbeds.  A initial tectonic event on the Triassic-Jurassic boundary led to the formation of the Tigrinine-Taabast pull-apart basin, for example. Following this event a major extensional tectonic activity (derived from the second Pangea rifting) occurred towards the end of the Pliensbachian and beginning of the Toarcian. This second major tectonic event developed towards the E-W to NE-SW, reactivating trending normal faults, what led to the drowning of the Lower Liassic carbonate platform and the predominance of marls during the Middle Liassic to Toarcian.\n\n\n== Rift Vulcanism ==\n\nAlong the High Atlas Triassic-Jurassic boundary, and until the Bathonian stage of the Middle Jurassic (then again in the Lower Cretaceous), there is a record on vulcanism locally on the succession of different local formations, such as the Guettioua Formation and others, but also absent on others such as the Pliensbachian Aganane Formation. Mostly of the north-African Rhaetian-Bathonian volcanic events are related to the open of the Atlantic Ocean, with parallel records found on the North American coast. On some locations, such as Haute Mouluya towards the Middle Central High Atlas, it is even possible to delimitate a transitions between the major CAMP event, linked with the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event and other posterior Hettangian and/or Sinemurian volcanic events, notorious due to be based around explosive vulcanism (Belonging to the Tizi-n-Ghachou Formation). Mostly of the effects of the volcanism occur on the main emerged terrestrial deposits  as can be seen in the presence of basaltic intrusions in the younger Bathonian layers of the Beni-Mellal zone, some of them cutting older strata.\nThe origin of the Central Atlantic magmatic province volcanism is related with the Geography of the zone, and has been registered to last until the Early Sinemurian (196.3 + 1.2 Ma). On the Sinemurian-Pliensbachian, the tethys flooded the area and a post-rift carbonate platform developed flooding CAMP basalts. On the Middle Toarcian, subsiding basins appeared which isolated the Mesetas and Precambrian and Paleozoic massifs.  On the Central High Atlas two sections of lava flows and dikes yielded ages between 188 and 153 M.a and 199-178 M.a  respectively, whose age, if true, overlapped with the eruption of the Karoo-Ferrar igneous province. Yet evidence of volcanism contemporaneous with the deposition of the Azilal Formation is almost nonexistent, and where volcanic rocks have been assigned, they have been repositioned as either younger or CAMP. The only possible record is found associated with the outcrops at Toundoute, with Trachyandesitic materials from an explosive source, like in the older Mouluya outcrops.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Aguerd-nˈTazoult Formation ===\nThe Aguerd-n'Tazoult formation encompasses the most recent marginal marine strata within the Amezraï minibasin, ranging from the Upper Toarcian to Aalenian periods. This formation denotes a transitional environment from supratidal to intertidal, exhibiting facies development similar to the underlying Trafraout Formation. Local tectonic activity, primarily triggered by seismic events in the Tethyan domain, played a pivotal role in the formation process. Consequently, emergent Paleozoic strata underwent erosion owing to prevailing local conditions.\n\n\n=== Amezraï Formation ===\nThis formation is predominantly exposed in the mini-basin bearing the same name, closely linked with the Tazoult Ridge, both showcasing significant evidence of diapirism during the late Lias period in the central Atlas region. The Amezraï Formation constitutes the earliest segment of this group, dated back to the Earliest Toarcian epochs, identified by its brachiopod fauna. Its outcrops, such as those in Jbel Azourki, consist of a mix of carbonates, sandstones, and marls, accompanied by conglomeratic facies containing Paleozoic basement elements. The vertical arrangement of these facies indicates a gradational decrease, with conglomerates, sandstones, and clays forming the lower part of the formation, transitioning to limestones, marls, and sandstones towards the top. These variations signify the erosion of sandy layers within a shallow platform environment, as evidenced by multiple criteria.\n\n\n=== Azilal Formation ===\nLevêque called this unit \"Marnes chocolat\" in the Azilal region, made up of red-brown marls, silts (microsandstones) and conglomerates with centimetric quartz dragees. Locations at Adoumaz, Ghnim and Jbel Taguendouft (Béni-Mellal Province) are composed by a succession of reddish-brown tints with terrigenous dominance: sandstone, clays with paleosols and sandstone limestones sometimes dolomitized, with marmorized levels in paleosols towards the northern region of Ghnim and Adoumaz. The lowermost sections show a transition from sandstone limestone and/or sandstone to clay, with a thin level of green marls locally rich in ostracods. This initial layers are followed by a subtidal term, represented by an oolitic limestone, with fine lamellibranch bioclasts and variable percentages of quartz, that host also small sections of sandstone with calcareous cement and rare oolites, representing this last one is an oblique bedding, of metric dimensions, drawing on the surface mega-ripples of 3 to 5 m in wavelength. The last major section represents a supratidal deposit, as shown by the presence of coarse sandstone gradually changing to red Marls with \"fluer\" structures and locally to paleosols. This section in Adoumaz has abundance of Paleozoic quartz grains, that are found  organized in decametric channeling lenses evoking a predominantly fluvial dynamic.\nOn the south-southwest edge of the basin towards west of Azilal (Jbel Til-Jbel Amersiaz basin and part of the M'Goun syncline), Guettioua, Demnate, Telouet, Toundoute & Marrakesh, under the Bajocian limestones (Tanant Formation) or directly under the Bajocian?-Bathonian Guettioua Formation, develops a thick a red detrital section in which pelites, sandstones and conglomerates with centimeter-sized quartz balls alternate and breccias (locally called \" Wazzant Formation\") with Liassic limestone elements, this last ones except near paleofaults, do not appear or have been dissolved. This sector reaches 800 m thickess in the Wazzant subasin, being very reduced to the south of it in Aït-Toutline or Aït-Iouaridène, recovering a variation of the sedimentary process formed by a complex sedimentary unit, terrigenously dominated, composed by the abundance of conglomeratic channels with quartz dragees and Paleozoic basement elements, sandstones organized in bars channeled lenticulars and red clays, the whole part of the facies is organized in metric sequences of filling and alluvial channels. In addition, exceptionally, at the Wazzant area it rests in this place directly on massive dolomites, having eroded the marno-limestones of the Pliensbachian, with transitional layers. A transition between marine and continental deposits, is seen through carbonate palustrine levels and horizons of caliche, being continental layers superimposed in stratigraphic continuity on the marine carbonates of the Aganane or older Imi-n-Ifri Formation. The Wazzant area river system was driven by several minor freshwater currents, likely temporal and related to the rainy seasons. It has a notorious proximal character compared to the other sections of the Azilal formation.\nThe lithology of the Azilal Formation recovers a Claystone-dominated interval, incised by metric dolomitized beds of Mudstones, Peloid-rich Packstones, Ooid-rich Grainstones, and Polymictic Conglomerates, all rich in Terrestrial plant debris, with faunal content very poor and mostly dominated by microbial facies.  This unit brings together sandstones, sometimes coarse or conglomeratics, especially red silts and some irregularly bedding carbonate horizons (lacustrine limestones?) as well as rarer coal beds.\nAt the west this unit consists of conglomerates, sandstones and red pelites. The sandstone and conglomeratic levels are lenticular with frequent oblique stratifications. While it can be complex to differentiate from the  Guettioua Formation or the Oukaïmeden Sandstone, conglomerates with multicolored quartz balls of centimeter diameter are the major unique trait of the Azilal Formation. This sequences record predominance of quartz grains (> 50), the rest is made up of fragments of rocks, often quartzose and schistosose with presence of vitreous rocks and spongy Glauconite; calcite cements the elements and fills vacuoles. The absence of heavy minerals and Plagioclase clearly indicate that these sandstones come from the dismantling of a non-granite base. Other proximal areas show Sieve-Conglomerate lenticular channels of ~5 m (16 ft) thickness (≤ 5 m (16 ft)), composed of several materials, such as volcanic products in Toundoute (blocks of sands composed of Feldspars, black ferruginous grains, siliceous green fragments of veins, microgeods, hummocky concretions), limestone debris with traces of roots and cracks, where in some parts traces of fine, dark brushy algal filaments are still visible, similar to blue-green algae of the genus Girvanella. Finally,  there are intercalations of fine, often laminated sandstone which mark the inondation facies of the channels during flood periods, being composed solely of feldspars plagioclase and to a lesser extent of orthoclase, as well as small ferruginous grains or fine silts of quartz.\nThe layers at Azilal evolved along the central high Altas Toarcian-Aalenian Siliclastic-Carbonate Platform, and consist mostly on a succession of detritic rocks with Red Marls, deposited on an alluvial environment occasionally interrupted by shallow marine incursions, a Mudflat setting. The unit represents a major sea regression measured in the central High Atlas, specially after the Lower Toarcian, proven by sections such as \"Tarhia n’Dadès\", where the Pliensbachian Choucht Formation marginal marine layers are overlain by one meter of red silt/bioclastic limestone alternations, that start a local paralic to continental environments, assigned to the Domerian Aganane Formation. Over this unit the limit with the Azilal formation is marked with a karstified subaerial exposure surface, that wears also great abundance of plant material, what overall implicates prograding terrestrial facies and a shrinking of the local carbonate platform width.  The base of the East Azilal Formation is not clear, there is a gradual passage between the underlying limestones of the Aganane Formation and the red pelites of the Azilal Formation. The upper limit is marked by a progressive transition to Bin-el-Ouidane limestones with the limit fixed at the base of the first massive limestones, generally “birds eyes”.\nIn the west it rests conformably and with progressive passage either on the Aït-Bazzi Formation, or on its lateral equivalent the Aganane, as can be seen at Ait Blal and Tacht  where limestone banks are gradually interspersed in the red pelites. In other places is clearly discordant on the sediments of the Sinemurian-Pliensbachian which can be found barely blunted blocks in its conglomeratic levels, as can be seen in places like the N of Wazzant or Ait Bou Oulli. The western upper limit is marked by greenish clayey levels are interspersed between the red pelites, then limestone banks, gradually changuing into the Bajocian Tanant Formation, as can be seen at Tizi-n-Takiout on Aït-Blal.\n\n\n=== Tagoudite Formation ===\nThe Tagoudite Formation represents a significant shift in Liassic sedimentation, replacing the carbonate turbidites of the Ouchbis Formation with predominantly siliciclastic layers. These layers comprise an irregular alternation of gray and green limestone sandstones with sandy marls and siltstones, forming megasequences with thicknesses of 10–20 m, distinguished by a decrease in siliciclastic aggregate size and an increase in marl content from bottom to top, with gradations, laminations, and ripple marks present. Microscopically, the thin-layered turbidites consist mainly of fine-grained silt, with variations in the percentage of siliciclastics and carbonate detritus over time and place. Siliciclastic portions include quartz grains, feldspar, and often glauconite, with micritic carbonate detritus ranging from 15% to 60% in a micritic matrix, with components indicating a distant source area. Pyrite can be enriched in nests or finely dispersed in individual layers. The siliciclastic turbidites suggest an open marine depositional environment, with interruptions in sedimentation and evidence of carbonate portion supply from neighboring emersion zones. Gravel stratification, lateral variations in siliciclastic grain size, and thickness fluctuations suggest different source areas, likely due to movements along paleostèration zones, reactivated during the Toarcian. The Tagoudite Formation is widespread in the Central High Atlas, wedged against paleorelief slopes or Boutonnières, with a thicknesses range up to 320 m, with variations noted in different areas of the Atlas region, including Tounfite, Rich, and Beni Mellal. In the Central Middle Atlas, sedimentation interruptions indicate emersion area formation preceding the deposition of this formation, with complete wedge-out to the east, approximately in the Midelt-Errachidia strait area.\n\n\n=== Tafraout Formation ===\nThe Tafraout Formation comprises oolitic and biodetrital limestones exhibiting cross-stratifications, arranged in channels and bars ranging from decimetric to metric scale, alongside greenish to variegated silty marls topped with lenticular layers of micro-conglomerates. These deposits were laid down on a coastal platform. The upper segment of the Tafraout Formation represents sedimentation resulting from terrigenous dispersal in the former \"basin\" of the upper Pliensbachian (Aganane Formation). The overall sedimentary trend indicates a progressive filling process. Initially, the presence of foraminifera assemblages, ammonite traces, and turbidite spits within the marls suggests sedimentation in an open marine environment with a circalittoral setting. Sandstone turbidites observed at the basin's northern boundary indicate material transit across the Pliensbachian platform. On the other hand, carbonate turbidites observed farther south in the Taquat N'Agrd area are likely attributed to erosion in high intra-basin regions. Moving towards the upper sections, a vertical arrangement and gradual filling process led to the formation of a supratidal carbonate coastal plain, characterized by tropical conditions akin to those observed on Andros, Bahamas. These observed sequences, displaying a \"coarsening up\" pattern, illustrate the advancement of a sandy beach area (sandstone) over a shallow subtidal zone (marls). The gullied limestones at the sequence's base denote phases of flooding preceding the resurgence of subtidal sedimentation.\n\n\n== Paleogeography ==\n\nThe Tafraout Group was deposited in the Moroccan Carbonate Platform, at a palaeolatitude between 19°-20°N, around the same latitude as modern Mauritania or Cuba, and developed along a major drowning episode linked with the Toarcian Anoxic event, that led to the eustatic sea–level rise on the Early Toarcian in Europe and Africa. The Azilal Formation was bracketed between several major geologically older hinterlands: the West Moroccan Arch on the W-NW, the Anti-Atlas and the Sahara craton in the S-SE.\nTowards the west (Afourer and Azilal province maps) the local laguno-marine facies of the Aganane Formation are directly overlain by terrigenous deposits of the Azilal Formation after the initial major Toarcian regression: red clays, conglomerates with paleozoic elements. This deposits fill many small basins in tearing in the Atlas of Afourer and Azilal, having the Demnat Accident as the major structural element in this last sector. While at Demnate, Telouet, Azilal, Skoura or Toundoute the conditions did become fully terrestrial, towards the east at Beni-Mellal the Lower Toarcian the ongoing sea regression happened latter, marked by oscillations between the Azilal Formation and the marly marine Tagoudite or the carbonate Tafraout, ending both fully overlain by the terrigenous layers towards the Middle-Late Toarcian. The Amezraï minbasin evolved as an isolated lateral equivalent, composed of intertidal to open marine carbonate environments, hosting also layers of the Tagoudite Formation, that end first overlain by the Tafraout Formation, and then in the westernmost sectors by the Azilal Formation while remaining in the central East marine-based as marks the Aguerd-nˈTazoult Formation.\nThe Tafraout Group co-evolved with several staggered sections from the southern edge of the Tilougguit Syncline in the north to the axis of the Aït Bouguemmez Basin in the south, showed that the depocenter zone corresponded to the disposal area located between the Talmest-Tazolt Ridge to the North and the North-Atlasic accident to the South. At Talmest-Tazoult ridge, the siliclastic-carbonate series of the Toarcian-Aalenian form a clear progressive unconformity above the carbonates of the Sinemurian-Pliensbachian, building an individualized ridge oriented NE-SW, limiting two local depressions to the South-East (Amezraï and Wahmane). The North Altas accident shows variations of thickness and facies, testifying a weak activity of the latter, in particular during the deposition of the Azilal Formation, with the reliefs created during the previous phase covered by the terrigenous layers of this last one.\nTwo main stages can be then distinguished in the paleogeographic evolution of the western border of the High Atlas Basin during the Toarcian-Aalenian: during the Lower Toarcian, this sector presented the same paleogeographic characteristics as those seen during the uppermost Pliensbachian, being latter followed by a reduction in the deposition areas and a filling of the Pliensbachian basins by terrigenous material from the Tagoudite & Azilal Formations.  Then, with the Middle Toarcian- Aalenian, the Azilal Formation expanded towards the east as the sedimentation resumed throughout the region, where coeval layers in the Amezraï subsiding basin was filled by carbonates from the internal platform of the Tafraout and Aguerd n’Tazoult, being surrounded to the north, east and south by a coastal area with dominant terrigenous sedimentation of the own Azilal Formation. This period is marked by the individualization of the Talmest-Tazolt Ridge in the center of the basin and by a relative tectonic calm in the other coeval sectors.\nDespite being claimed to have Latest Pliensbachian layers, the Azilal Formation is measured in post Polymorphum (Earliest Toarcian) levels, and impacts in the sedimentation (especially of the Béni-Mellal Province, Zaouiat Ahansal, or the Dadès Gorges) in the Middle Toarcian-Lower Aalenian, marked by a notorious sea regression, distributed in at least 6 sequences, that overlie layers with the ammonite genus Eodactylioceras and Hildoceras bifrons allow a precise localization of this initial progradation of the terrestrial settings around the Bifrons substage of the Toarcian (that can be either considered the uppermost Lower Toarcian of the lower Middle Toarcian). The layers are, at the oldest sections of this initial phase, represented by marly and silty marls and limestones as well as marginal-littoral sandstones testifying to the siltation of this sector by sandy sheets of deltaic origin. At the same time on the Amezraï basin the fauna is composed by brachiopod fauna such as Soaresirhynchia bouchardi, S. babtisrensis and Pseudogibbirhynchia jurensis that corroborate the Toarcian age and the connection between both locations. Meanwhile, the presence of Aalenian (Bradfordernsis-Murchinsonae) Branchiopods in the Aguerd n’Tazoult Formation coeval with Ammonites of the same age in the easternmost Azilal formation at the Ikerzi Area confirms the marine delimitation in the last stages of deposition.\n\n\n== Environment ==\n\nThe Tafraout Group covers most of the W High Atlas, surrounded by highlands that probably hosted dry cool (10.6 °C) to humid climate (12.30 °C), with a succession rain tundra to wet forest environments, as proven by samples from coeval layers in the External Rif Chain.  It was the emerged part of a Siliciclastic-Carbonate platform and represented a variety of settings, including continental river/palustrine-dominated, paralic-tidal deposits, and tidal mudflat shorelines. The terrigenous-dominated deposits of the Azilal Formation were deposited in a coastal environment with continental influence. On this facies, the fauna (composed of rare Brachiopods, poorly diversified black Bivalves or vertebrates) and the sedimentary figures (impacts of raindrops, soft pebbles, crisscrossed stratifications and \"ripplemarks\") reflect a confined to continental/marine deposition environment, with temporary emersions, where conditions met in a deltaic environment with saltwater/brackish influences. This terrigenous deposition can be seen from north to south as a lateral transition from a coastal facies to a fluvial facies (at Adoumaz) to a foreshore facies (Ghnim \"fining up\" type sequences) to a beach facies (Jbel Taguendouft \"coarsening up\" type sequences). The relatively small thicknesses found at the Jbel Taguendouft section would testify to the tectonic activity of the Jbel Abbadine ridge.\nThe flow of the fluvial-washed sediments take place in a E-NE direction, being moved to the layers of the Tafraout Formation and other coeval marine units, as well are found on fluviatile channels inside the own rocks of this unit.\nThe depositional environment of the Azilal formation was dominantly fluvial or alluvial, with large sandstone channels cutting through detrital conglomerate deposits. The high abundance of plant remains, either as fossil wood, cuticles, charcoal or Rhizoliths, reveals the presence of vegetated soils in the vicinity. There is also evidence ephemeral Palustrine (Sabkhas, Chotts) episodes in the form of carbonate bodies (Caliche or Calcrete levels), intercalated with conglomerate under an arid environment, as marks the development of gypsum.  This is recorded specially in the Telouet and Demnate-Wazzant area, but also seen in more detail at Toundoute: the deposits present a channel/floodplain type fluvial system, with sand-filled channels abundant in plant roots (mostly located in fine limestone, probably from the channel margins), developed in the near E-W direction of transit. The channel lithology shows notable enrichment of material from the Paleozoic basement and Triassic cover, with interbedded volcanic material (sand to pebbles), generally constituting more than half of the detrital components, showing clear carbonate recrystallization, suggesting that these fragments were still at high temperature during deposition and, therefore, contemporaneous with the sedimentation. Lithic elements or isolated crystals found locally show no evidence of prolonged transport, probably from relatively nearby Springs, being these collected and transported by a poorly developed river system during episodic floods.\n\nThe overall local climate was warm with alternating wet and dry periods have generated soils with differentiated calcareous profiles (pedogenetic nodules, Caliche), hosting active erosion on sparsely vegetated soils.\n\nThe environment of the Azilal Formation becomes notorious after the Middle Toarcian, with a clear major regression that ends with a slowdown of the local sedimentary filling. The paralic deposits of this phase contain clay intervals rich in continental organic matter such as wood debris, but a rare fossil fauna consisting of abundant algae, benthic foraminifera, common oncoids, gastropods, and bivalve bioclasts. As the Lower Toarcian started, over the region, the carbonate platform was abruptly replaced by siliciclastic deposits fed by a greater surrounding hinterland weathering, measured thanks to increased plant debris and the absence of evaporite-rich intervals and semi-arid paleosols, with alternating shoreline-forest depositional contexts. This initial layers are overlied by storm-dominated deposits, with a depauperate fauna and very common occurrence of plant debris, which with the increase in ooid-rich facies suggest deposition on a warm, wet climate belt. Some of these areas, particularly the more coastal ones located in the Azilal region, have an appearance similar to that of modern Sebkhas, for example those of found in the modern Persian Gulf. These intervals have increased nutrient levels locally, as evidenced by the high amount of Phosphorus along the entire Atlas Basin. These siliciclastic beds have abundant pebbles of metamorphic and igneous rocks, implying that the material must have been derived from the Paleozoic or Proterozoic, implying a hinterland that is frequently emerged and subject to erosion and the effects of diagenesis. The only ones of this nature in Morocco, that on the Atlas are located to the south in the Anti-Atlas, to the west in the Ancient Massif and the Jebilet, and to the north in the Central Meseta, all places that were subaerially exposed during the Jurassic. Specifically, the Anti-Atlas shows processes of tectonic uplift, overburden erosion, which, combined with the concentration of coarse siliciclastic material in the western part of the central High Atlas (absent in the east), suggest that this area was the source of the altered Lower Toarcian sediments, allowing the tracing of the fluvial channels that developed towards the Azilal Formation.\nAt the same time towards the South-East the Tafraout Formation in the Amezraï basin represents a marginal marine environment, with wave ripples, cross-bedding, the Amphipoda ichnofossil Arenicolites isp. and the calcareous algae Cayeuxia sp., all deposited on diagenetic mudstone. Concretely, on Taguendouft,  towards the Middle Toarcian the carbonate producers recovered locally, with the ooid grainstone replaced by wackestone to packstone beds, where heterotrophic faunal bioclasts increase, such as cephalopods, brachiopods, echinoderms, and gastropods, with occasional coral patch reefs.\nWithin the Trafraout Formation, facies comprising \"lithiotids\" (Plicatostylidae aberrant reef-forming bivalves), which are known from the Sinemurian to the Toarcian of Italy, Spain, Slovenia, Croatia, Montenegro, Albania and also in Morocco, indicate the return of carbonate activity in the Central Atlas. These Reefs showed strong zonation, starting with the bivalves Gervilleioperna and Mytiloperna, restricted to intertidal and shallow-subtidal facies. Lithioperna are limited to subtidal lagoon facies and even to certain poorly oxygenated environments. Finally, Cochlearites are found in the subtidal facies, building accumulations. At Jebel Toksine in the Dades Valley, the Tafraout Formation develops a local lagoon-subtidal ecosystem in arid and humid conditions. The Jebel Toksine layers represent one of the most complete records of this type of ecosystem in Morocco, recording several generations of lithiotic growth over ~1 km of exposure (consisting of the genera Gervilleioperna, Mytiloperna, Lithioperna and Cochlearites), as well as a diverse associated fauna.\nThe Tagoudite & Tafraout formations recover, as seen on worldwide units an increase of weathering due to the Pl/To and T-OAE events, with increase of the siliciclastic sediment supply and increased dissolved material to the oceans. This occurred along an intensification of tropical storm events (as well Hurricane action) on the T-OAE, destroying the older carbonate platform organisms locally. This allowed to set the Azilal Formation environments, that range from a series of continental settings with river influence, increased during the T-AOE with more amounts of flora being washed, to nearshore deposits, paralic and subtidal, subject of storm and tropical storm events, all set on a warm humid climate.\n\nThe aftermath of the Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event is also highly present on the marginal marine strata of the formation, with the so-called Toksine Section, a succession of near shore marine strata disposed along the Toarcian boundary, where its last 40 m belong to the lower part of the Azilal Formation and are composed of dolomitized Mudstones and ooidal Grainstones, that show a slowly recovering a low-depth nearshore marine environment after in the Pliensbachian-Toarcian boundary a dramatic Tethys-wide collapse of the Neritic Carbonate System happened.\nThere is also a local record of a Middle Toarcian Cold Snap at Jbel Akenzoud, and shows that after cold event that affect the local waters, related to the Karoo & the Atlantic Rift volcanism the present Brachiopods, based on their preserved oxygen isotope data show that warm seawater temperatures re-established during the early Late Toarcian.\nIn the Middle Toarcian the eastern and north-eastern part of High Atlas of Todrha-Dadès, sedimentation carbonate with bioconstructions (patch-reef), develops with a thickening towards the East and a still thinning towards the West in the direction of the reef of Jbel Akenzoud, where the dew marine fossils of the formation are recovered.  The Coralline faunas suffered a significant collapse visible in the locality of Ouguerd Zegzaoune, showing that sedimentation at this time took place in a distensive tectonic context. Then, towards the Late Toarcian-Aalenian boundary, the series corresponds to detrital deposits with carbonate intercalations with neritic fauna. The structural analysis shows that the sedimentation during the upper Toarcian was controlled by a tectonic game, always distensive, causing the tilting of blocks along the transverse fault of NW-SE direction, which leads to the creation of available space with openings always towards E and NE.\n\n\n=== Coeval Diapirism ===\n\nThe central High Atlas region harbors a cluster of elongated diapirs and minibasins formed during the Lower Jurassic rifting of the Atlas basin, with the Tazoult Ridge being one such diapiric sector spanning approximately 20 km. Oriented NE-SW, it slightly deviates from the dominant ENE-WSW structural trend of the central High Atlas, flanked by the Amezraï minibasin to the south and the Tiloughite minibasin to the north. Within the Amezraï minibasin, the Tafraout group, stretching about 1500 m, is exposed.  These deposits, interpreted as mixed Toarcian-Aalenian sediments, led to the extrusion of the diapir on its flank and the adjacent seabed, positioning the Alenian facies of the Aguerd-nˈTazoult Formation in a sub-horizontal orientation beyond the allochthonous body. The sharp transition between the gently SE-dipping Zaouiat Ahançal Group and the steeply NW-dipping Late Aalenian-Bajocian carbonates of the Bin el Ouidane Formation is seen as a weld formed by the closure of the salt wall.  This period coincides with the peak of passive diapiric growth, driven by the reactivation of the central High Atlas synrift from the Pliensbachian to the Aalenian, triggering salt withdrawal and swelling of adjacent salt walls, forming the Talmest allochthonous salt sheet at its SE end. In terms of paleoenvironment, the elongated carbonate platforms of Tazoult, formed by rifts, resemble those found in the shallow waters of the Red Sea's edges, particularly in Egypt's Strait of Gubal and Saudi Arabia's Farasan Banks.\nExamining local diapirism in the Upper Liassic has provided valuable insights into climate and deposition in the coexisting marine Amellago Formation. Intervals devoid of ooids indicate a wetter climate, supported by an increase in continental particles—a sign of heightened Saharan Craton weathering. Additionally, the presence of small amounts of charcoal or charred wood remnants suggests the existence of coastal forests or mangroves in the carbonate ramp of the Zaouiat Ahançal group during periods of increased local humidity.\n\n\n== Foraminifera ==\n\n\n== Algae ==\n\n\n== Invertebrates ==\nIn the Tafraout Group, the fossil record of units like the Azilal Formation is very restrictive compared to the marine coeval/underliying units like the Amezraï or Tafraout Formations. In the Dadés area Coral patch reefs rarely occur in the middle of the unit with associated echinodems (Sea urchin spines, Crinoid fragments) lamellibranchs, gastropods, solitary corals and algae.  Plant remains are very abundant in places such as the north of Jbel Akenzoud and partly impregnated and/or carbonized by malachite.  Gastropods have been discovered in several places, but none of the specimens have been studied nor identified.  Beds with large accumulations of unidentified Ostracod valves on an endemic thin level of green marl are found at the Beni-Mellal area  (Adoumaz & Col de Ghnim outcrops). The tubes of serpulid worms are known from Jbel Toksine, in relation to the bivalve pavements.\n\n\n=== Ichnofossils ===\n\n\n=== Anthozoa ===\nThe platform patch reefs in the Tafraout area are notable for their biodiversity, with some reaching heights of up to 40 m and lengths of up to 80 m, representing massive biostromes with a varied associated fossil assemblage, including bivalves, gastropods, echinoderm fragments, solitary corals, and bryozoans, found among the coral patchs.\n\n\n=== Brachiopoda ===\n\n\n=== Bivalves ===\n\"Dwarf black bivalves (Lucinidae?)\" in great abundance where reported from the Azilal Formation at its type section.\n\n\n=== Gastropoda ===\nMultiple Gasteropodan faunas are know, specially associated with coral patch reefs, but lack proper studies.\n\n\n=== Ammonites ===\n\n\n=== Crustacea ===\n\n\n=== Echinodermata ===\nMultiple echinoderm remains, including Crinoid articulated and fragmentary specimens and indeterminate echinoid fragment, are know from several localities, usually associated with large coral bioherms or sea trangressions.\n\n\n== Vertebrates ==\nSeveral scales & teeth of fishes (Lepidotes?) are know from several locations, coming from freshwater/lagoonal layers.  Indeterminate dinosaurian & other vertebrates are know from Mizaguène Hill, Taouja Ougourane, Aït Ouaridène, Oued Rzef & Jbel Remuai in the Azilal Province. Some of them are recovered in a \"Bone bed\" and others are associated with abundant plant remains.\n\n\n=== Actinopteri ===\n\n\n=== Theropoda ===\n\n\n=== Sauropodomorpha ===\n\n\n== Plantae ==\nThe Major Vegetational distribution was compared with the modern inland of the Isle of Pines.  In the Beni Mellal-Azilal areas paleosols show abundance of Rhizoliths of plants associated with heavily bioturbated layers.  While there is a great amount of plant remains in the form of coal, foliar debris, cuticles, woody roots, rhizolith and ghost roots, fossil wood and unidentified macrofoliar remains the only flora with some work on it was recovered at Toundoute, as abundant infra-centimeter plant debris composed mostly by Leaflets from ferns and, less frequently, cycad pinnulae, with common cuticles and no palynomorphs.  Wood debris from the same locality showed affinity within the coniferophytes, resembling the abietoid Pinaceae or towards the Taxaceae. By quantity of material the vegetation was apparently dominated by ferns, maybe concentrated in punctual wetlands (spring tuffs), followed by cycads and conifers. A possible correlative flora if found in the same age layers of the Mashabba Formation (North Sinai, Egypt) and is composed by the genera Equisetites (Equisetales), Phlebopteris and Piazopteris branneri (Matoniaceae). Other coeval flora includes the plants recovered on the Budoš Limestone and specially the Rotzo Formation.\nAt Jebel Toksine, lithiotid biostromes are interbedded by recessive and marly levels with woody charcoal debris (including entire trunks of wood, abundant woody plant debris preserved in the form of jet or charcoal), which suggests the presence of vegetation marginal marine that has developed a stabilizing role, which is common in relatively humid environments conducive to the development of marginal marine plants and has the propensity to develop meandering channel morphologies.\nAt Jebel Azourki, several marine lithofacies were recorded, from 1 to 5, but with an additional 6th of medium gray to black laminated shales with coal streaks and abundant plant fragments, the attribution of which is n is not clear, since it may be Pliensbachian or Toarcian, as may also belong to the Aganane Formation. These black lithofacies shales are interpreted to represent a supratidal marsh developed at the edges of an intertidal zone and a lagoon.\n\n\n=== Fossil Wood ===\nAt the top of the formation at the Idemrane geosite, unidentified pieces of wood fossils of variable sizes were recovered (largest over 20 cm in length) showing traces of iron oxides. This woody pieces are considered root fragments.\n\n\n== See also ==\nToarcian turnover\nToarcian formations\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "John Noel Reedman (December 24, 1905 – May 20, 1994) was an English-South African diplomat who was the Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations in Palestine. He had previously served as Senior Economic Advisor both to UNSCOP and the Palestine Commission. Reedman was a professor of economics at Witwatersrand University in South Africa.\n\n\n== Life ==\nJohn Noel Reedman was born on 24 December 1905 in Kirkburton, Yorkshire, England. He gained a PhD in economics from Sheffield University. Reedman moved to South Africa and became a lecturer of economics in the Department of Commerce at the University of Witwatersrand in 1936. He was described as an \"outstanding teacher and scholar\" who had \"carried much of the lecturing burden of the department\"  He gave up his professorial functions in Johannesburg in January 1947 in order to join the staff of the United Nations.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAt the outset of his career with the United Nations, Reedman began his work on the issue of Palestine. Before the foundation of the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP), the UN Secretariat began accumulating knowledge and expertise on Palestine in early 1947 after the British government announced that it was referring the Palestine problem to the United Nations. Reedman was part of a five-member team assembled at the direction of Secretary-General Trygve Lie to collect this information. The team published five thick volumes containing a wealth of statistical information and various proposed solutions to the Palestine problem intended to support the members of the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP), which would later study the problem in the summer of 1947. Other prominent members of the team included Ralph Bunche, Constantin Stavropoulos, Alfonso Garcia Robles and Henri Vigier.\nReedman served as an economic advisor to UNSCOP. UNSCOP's members disagreed significantly on the issue of the proposed partition of Palestine, resulting in it submitting a majority and a minority report. The majority report recommended a partitioning which became the subject of General Assembly Resolution 181, while the minority report had argued for a federal state, in which an Arab majority would be maintained. Reedman, Bunche and Vigier, who had served in an advisory capacity to UNSCOP, unsuccessfully campaigned against the partition plan.\nFollowing the adoption of General Assembly Resolution 181, Reedman was recruited by Ralph Bunche to advise the ill-fated Palestine Commission, which was to implement the partition plan. The General Assembly relieved the Palestine Commission of its mandate on 14 May 1948 and appointed Count Folke Bernadotte as UN mediator under Resolution 186. He was appointed to broker a peace settlement and find a solution to the Palestine question after the Commission proved unable to quell the civil war that had broken out following the adoption of the partition plan on 29 November 1947. Reedman was appointed by the Secretary General as his Special Representative in Palestine in 1948. During this time he and his staff were based in Tel Aviv and he acted as one of Folke Bernadotte's closest advisors.\nAfter Bernadotte's assassination in 1948, the UN General Assembly decided to set up the United Nations Conciliation Commission for Palestine (UNCCP)  with the aim of mediating the Arab-Israeli conflict. Reedman continued his involvement on the issue of the disposition of movable and immovable property belonging to Arab refugees who could not return to their homes.\nReedman became Principal Secretary of the Clapp Mission  of the UN's Economic Survey Mission for the Middle East, which became known as the \"Clapp Mission\", named after its chairman, Gordan R. Clapp. It's report was issued on 28 December 1949.\nIn 1953 the UNCCP sent Reedman to visit the capitals of various Arab countries to negotiate the issue of blocked Arab accounts in Israel. He spent nearly two months attempting to reconcile Israel and Jordan. One of the commission's major accomplishments was the release of about 6000 Arab refugee accounts in Israeli banks. The accounts had been blocked in 1948 by the Israeli government which provided for the freezing of absentee property.\nIn 1959, Reedman was appointed the Director of the United Nations Information Centre in London. Reedman published the article \"The United Nations and Economic Development\" in 1961 in the journal International Relations while still in his capacity as Director of the UN Information Centre in London.\n\n\n== Death ==\nReedman died on 20 May 1994 in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, England.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Parsons Mounted Cavalry (PMC) is a cavalry unit of the Texas A&M Corps of Cadets which serves as the only mounted ROTC cavalry unit in the country. This horse combat unit consists of cavalry, artillery and quartermaster elements. The unit represents Texas A&M University at football games, parades, agricultural, and equestrian events throughout Texas. There are 90 junior and senior cadets and 50 horses in this unit.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nPMC traces its origins to the early years of Texas A&M when mounted drill training was a fundamental part of military education. However, this practice ceased in 1943 with the disbandment of the United States Cavalry Branch by the United States Army. The initiative to revive the cavalry tradition was revived at A&M by the junior Class of 1974, in the spring of 1973. That semester, three cadets, Michael Collins, Darrell Williams, and Douglas Latimer, proposed reviving mounted drill training to then Commandant of Cadets. Colonel Thomas R. Parsons. The unit was named after Parsons, who was the only active-duty Commandant at Texas A&M. The unit made its debut in the Corps' march-in at the Wichita State football game in September 1973. Collins served as the unit's first Commanding Officer, with Williams as the Executive Officer and Latimer as a Platoon Leader. By the 1981–1982 academic year, PMC proudly welcomed its first female member.\nIt has worked with horsemen of the 1st Cavalry Division.\n\n\n== Organization ==\nThe command of the company consists of the following individuals:\n\nCommanding Officer\nExecutive Officer\nFirst Sergeant\nStaff Officers\nArtillery Officer\nMuleskinner\nAdministration Officer\nOperations and Logistics Officer\nTraining Officer\nPisshead (\"Sophomore\") Training Officer\nPublic Relations\nSupply Officer\nGame Day Officer\nStablemaster\nLeather Officer\nVeterinary Officer\nThe unit is broken into three of the following basic units:\n\n1st Platoon\n2nd Platoon\nHalf-Section\nEach platoon is further subdivided into two squads.\n\n\n== Stables ==\nIn 1979, it relocated from the Research Annex to a new facility adjacent to Texas A&M University's Vet School, which in 1981, was named \"Fiddler’s Green.\" The name pays homage to a poignant poem embraced by U.S. Army cavalry formations in the late 1800s, which portrayed an idyllic paradise. In 2014, a substantial expansion initiative nearly doubled the original 26-acre space, elevating the total acreage to an impressive 50 acres.\n\n\n== Spirit of '02 ==\nThe Half Section (responsible for Field Artillery and Mule Team elements) maintains the \"Spirit of '02\", a field gun found in the fall of 1974 at a Aggie Bonfire cut site near Easterwood Airport. The cannon is driven by a 4 horse team and a restored caisson to Kyle Field and fired during all home football games, midnight yell practice, and other special events. While Aggie lore states the gun was the runaway that tumbled over a ridge in the film We've Never Been Licked, there is no conclusive evidence. It is affectionately known as \"The Spirit of ‘02,\" in honor of its 1902 origins.\n\n\n== Association ==\nThe PMC Association is a non-profit organization designed to support those in PMC.\n\n\n== See also ==\n3rd Infantry Regiment\nNational Lancers\nTexas Military Forces\n\n\n== Notes ==\nPMC Association\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Williams and Woods was a confectionery business in Dublin, Ireland.\n\n\n== History ==\nHenry Williams opened his original confectionery shop on Dame Street in the 1850s. Robert Woods joined him some years later as a business partner and the company was renamed Williams and Woods. On opening, the factory employed 400 worker, mainly women from the local area. The company had its own cow's milk herd in North Dublin as well as a fruit farm in Kilsallaghan, County Dublin. In 1875, the company moved to the former Simpson's Hospital on Great Britain Street (now Parnell Street), later replaced by Cineworld Dublin.\nBy the 1890s, the company had expanded to 26 King's Inns Street, at the corner of Loftus Lane, adjacent to Henrietta Street.\nDuring the visit of Britain's Queen Victoria to Dublin in 1900, Williams and Woods provided 10,000 bags of sweets and 1 ton of jam for the Queen's Children's Day even in the Phoenix Park, which was attended by fifteen thousand children. In 1907, the company had an exhibit at the Irish International Exhibition in Herbert Park. During the 1916 Easter Rising, the rebels laid plans to occupy the Williams and Woods factory building but this did not come to pass.\nIn 1928, the company was acquired by the English company Crosse & Blackwell.\nBy the 1950s, the workforce had grown to 1,000 and the company had expanded to producing good for other brands, including Crosse & Blackwell and Chef. In the 1960s, artist Patricia Hurl's first job was in the office of Williams and Woods as a comptometer operator.\nThe company was ultimately taken over by Nestlé after its UK parent, Crosse & Blackwell, was acquired in 1960.\nIn 1975, the company by then known as Willwood moved its operations out of Dublin city centre to a modern manufacturing facility in Tallaght.\nThe remaining portion of the Irish entity was taken over in 1977 with the brands being phased out over the next two decades.\n\n\n== Building ==\n\n\n=== Modernist factory ===\nThe Art Deco factory at 26 King's Inns Street was designed by Donnelly and Moore architects and built by G&T Crampton in 1910. It was further extended in the 1920s and 1941. The site had previously been home to a confectionery factory that had been built in 1856 but had been destroyed by fire in 1908. Dublin City Council includes the building on its Record of Protected Structures, reference number 8905.\nIn 2012, the building was converted into an arts centre, which launched in 2014 as The Chocolate Factory.\n\n\n=== Georgian building ===\nThe former Simpson's Hospital building on Parnell Street was sold off to developers after the factory's move in 1975 and ultimately demolished.\n\n\n== External links ==\nPhoto of the factory from the 1950s in the RTE archive\nPhoto of the factory from 1968 in the RTE archive\nPhoto of the inside of the factory from 1962\n\n\n== References ==",

She is also known for playing Sheila in the musical Hair and Janis in the Mean Girls musical.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMary Kate Morrissey was born in Downingtown, Pennsylvania on June 18, 1989. When asked how she decided what career path she wanted to follow, Morrissey said, \"My grandfather used to sing on the Irish Radio and play in a band, and my dad would dress us up like the Rolling Stones when my brothers and sister and I were little and we would put on full-blown lip sync concerts. My parents recognized the performer bug in me and put me in the local high school’s production of Joseph and the Technicolor Dreamcoat, where my second-grade self played a sheep!\" In her later school years, she joined numerous choirs and her high school band.\nMorrissey saw Shoshana Bean and Megan Hilty act in Wicked on Broadway sometime around 2004, and since then, she has been a fan of the play.\nShe got a BFA Degree in Music Theater from Syracuse University.\n\n\n== Career ==\nMorrissey's first role as an actress was playing Sheila in Broadway's US and Canada tour of Hair. \nIn 2015, Morrissey served as the standby for Elphaba on the national tour of Wicked. She began to play the role full-time in 2017 alongside her best friend Ginna Claire Mason as Glinda before taking a break from Wicked to play Janis in the Mean Girls musical national tour. In 2023, Morrissey became the official standby for Elphaba on Broadway. On March 5th, 2024, she began playing the role full-time alongside Alexandra Socha as Glinda. Morrissey replaced Alyssa Fox as Elphaba, and Socha replaced McKenzie Kurtz as Glinda.\nMorrissey confessed to initially having doubts about whether she could play Elphaba, but her family supported her along the way and she eventually got her dream.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nMorrissey is married to a man named Trevor Blake. She identifies as queer and is an advocate for queer rights and representation.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Mid-Mesozoic Parasitoid Revolution (MMPR) was an evolutionary radiation of insect parasites and parasitoids from the Toarcian to the Albian.\n\n\n== Timeline ==\nThe MMPR represented a major reorganisation of terrestrial food webs. Before the MMPR, parasitoid insects were absent in many fossil assemblages, such as the Triassic-aged Madygen, Molteno, Beishan, Shangtu, and Cow Branch Formations. The MMPR was marked by an increase in diversity among coleopterans, dipterans, strepsipterans, and hymenopterans, the main insect clades containing parasitoids, that reflected these clades entering parasitoid niches.\nThe beginning phase of the MMPR lasted from the late Early Toarcian to the Valanginian. It is documented in the Jiulongshan and Karabastau Formations from the Middle and Late Jurassic, respectively. In the Jiulongshan's Yanliao Biota, the neuropteran parasitoid lineage Mantispidae, the dipteran parasitoid lineages Nemestrinidae and Eremochaetidae, and the coleopteran parasitoid families Ripiphoridae and Staphylinidae are represented, though the staphylinid subfamilies known to contain parasitoid species are absent. Most notably, the Yanliao Biota contains the plant-associated sawfly clades Xyeloidea, Tenthredinoidea, Pamphilioidea, Cephoidea, Siricoidea, and Orussoidea, the latter being the only parasitoid sawfly lineage, and the apocritan parasitoid clades Evanioidea, Ephialtitoidea, and Proctotrupoidea, which belong to the hymenopteran order. In the Karabastau Formation, a similar family-level diversity of parasitoid hymenopterans is represented but with double the species diversity. Nemestrinids, acrocerids, and eremochaetids represent dipteran parasitoids from the Karabastau and mantispids represent neuropteran ones, with anthribids and staphylinids being represented among coleopteran parasitoids. The assemblage found in the Berriasian Lulworth Formation has also been studied and cited as evidence of the MMPR, as it contains twenty species of parasitoid apocritans, including megalyroids, evanioids, proctotrupoids, ichneumonoids, chrysidoids, and the enigmatic Apocrites.\nPhase 2 of the MMPR, lasting from the Late Valanginian to the Albian, involved even further parasitoid diversification. In the Barremian Yixian Formation, the number of hymenopteran parasitoid lineages jumped to thirteen from the eight to nine found in the previous lagerstatten. Amongst evanioids, there were evaniids, praeaulacids, aulacids, and baissids. Ephialtitoids were represented by ephialtitids; Amongst procrotrupoids, the mesoserphids, helorids, pelecinids, roproniids, and serphids were represented. Ichneumonoids, chrysidoids, and vespoids were represented in the Yixian by ichneumonids, bethylonymids, and scoliids, respectively. Dipteran species diversity was the same as in the Jurassic lagerstatten and contained among the eremochaetids and nemestrinids. Thirty-seven parasitoid coleopterans were found, mainly among staphylinids but also among carabids, while nine species of mantispid neuropterans were found.\n\n\n== References ==",

After decades of civil disobedience related to campaigns against nuclear war, she was sentenced to jail time in Germany in 2024.\n\n\n== California Catholic social worker ==\nCrane is a longtime member of California Catholic Worker House, an organization that provides support for people who are struggling with poverty and homelessness. This organization continues the work of Dorothy Day and the Catholic Social Worker movement.\n\n\n== Plowshares movement ==\nCrane has been involved in four notable direct action protests through the Plowshares Movement where she worked alongside notable peace activists such as Sr. Anne Montgomery. Crane has been critical of U.S. involvement in NATO and refers to the organization as a \"war making force\" believing it is beyond \"anybody's control.\"\n\n\n== Büchel Air Force Base ==\nBeginning in 2018, Crane and 17 other peace activists broke into Büchel Air Force Base in Germany where U.S. nuclear weapons were being stored. These weapons are known as B61s. This direct action was known as part of the \"Büchel is everywhere\" campaign.\n\n\n== Volkel Air Base ==\nIn 2023, Crane was arrested at Volkel Air Base in The Netherlands. She was interviewed about this direct action protest by Amy Goodman of Democracy Now in August that year. She was quoted as saying,\n\"We’re very concerned about the legality of the United States sending nuclear warheads to the five countries in Europe, particularly to the Netherlands and to Germany, because it’s against the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The treaty says that nuclear countries can’t share, as it were, their nuclear weapons with nonnuclear countries, and nonnuclear countries can’t accept these weapons. So, as far as we’re concerned, the Volkel Air Base, which is in the Netherlands, is a crime scene...\"\n\n\n== Arrests & trials ==\nNovember 2009: Kitsap-Bangor Naval Base, Washington\n2011: Trial at Naval Base Kitsap-Bangor and Strategic Weapons Facility-Pacific (SWFPAC), Tacoma, Washington\n2023: Arrest at Volkel Air Base, The Netherlands\n\n\n== Publications ==\nDisciples & Dissidents: The Prison Writings of the Prince of Peace Plowshares (2001)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Buttercrambe Mill is a historic building in Buttercrambe, a village in North Yorkshire, in England.\nThe former watermill has a datestone reading \"1697\".  It has a mill race on the River Derwent and milled corn.  It was grade II listed in 1953, and was converted into a house in the 1980s.  In 2016, it was put up for auction, with a guide price of £300,000.\nThe mill is built of brick, with a stepped floor band, stepped eaves courses, and a pantile roof.  There are two storeys and attics, and three bays.  The middle bay projects under a pedimented gable, and it contains a doorway and rusticated brick quoins.  The windows are casements, and all the openings have rusticated brick surrounds and keystones.  In the attic is an oculus with keystones.  Inside, many of the original floor beams survive, and there is a 20th-century iron spiral staircase.\n\n\n== See also ==\nListed buildings in Buttercrambe with Bossall\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Michael King Writers Centre is a writing centre on the slope of Takarunga / Mount Victoria in Devonport, Auckland, New Zealand, which offers residencies to early career and experienced writers. It was established in 2005 in honour of New Zealand historian Michael King.\n\n\n== About the centre ==\nThe centre is based at the Signalman's House, a historic house built in 1898, on Takarunga / Mount Victoria in Devonport, Auckland.\nAs of November 2022 the centre had hosted around 140 writers-in-residence. Residencies are of short length to encourage applicants of diverse backgrounds. As of 2024 residencies are offered for between two and three weeks, although in the past they have been offered for as long as six months. The centre also offers short-term accommodation for visiting writers on a paying basis.\n\n\n== History ==\nAt the memorial service for historian and writer Michael King in 2004, Gordon McLauchlan suggested that a writers' centre in King's name should be set up. The centre was established through a charitable trust; together with McLauchlan, founding trustees included Christine Cole Catley, Witi Ihimaera and Geoff Chapple.\nThe centre officially opened in July 2005. The first writer-in-residence was Geoff Chapple.\nBetween 2007 and 2020, University of Auckland residencies were offered at the centre, supported by Creative New Zealand, which required the writer to spend time at the university's English department. In 2010 the centre began offering Māori writers' residencies, developed with the assistance of Witi Ihimaera. In July 2011 the centre offered a free week's residency for four writers affected by the Christchurch earthquake.\nIn 2014, in partnership with several organisations including the Shanghai Writers' Association, the centre began running an exchange whereby Chinese writers could undertake a residency at the centre and New Zealand writers could undertake a residency in Shanghai. In 2021 the centre announced a new exchange programme with Varuna, The Writers' House in the Blue Mountains, Sydney.\nFrom 2008 to 2019 the centre offered a programme of workshops for young writers, and since 2012 has published a literary journal of students' work titled Signals. The programme was put on hold in 2020, and the centre has instead run the Signals Awards for writers aged 16 to 21.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nNotable recipients of Michael King Writers Centre residencies have included:\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Thamnaconus hypargyreus, commonly known as the lesser-spotted leatherjacket, yellowspotted leatherjacket, or the yellow-fin filefish, is a fish native to the coastal waters of the South and East China Seas and northern Australian coast.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nT. hypargyreus is a species of the genus Thamnaconus of the family Monacanthidae, a group commonly known as filefishes.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe maximum total length of T. hypargyreus is 21.2 cm. The body is a dusky orange-cream toward the top, with blue tints on the head and back, and a cream colour below.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nT. hypargyreus inhabit the southeastern Indian Ocean from around northern Western Australia, Queensland, to southern New South Wales, Australia, as well as southern Papua New Guinea, and the East and South China Seas from southern Japan to around Taiwan to Hainan Island, China . It inhabits the sandy bottoms of neritic waters 10–235 m deep, though is typically not found deeper than 130 m.\n\n\n=== Conservation status ===\nThe IUCN Red List categorizes T. hypargyreus as Least Concern, the justification for which being the species' broad distribution. While the yield from trawling in the South China Sea declined rapidly due to population decline as a consequence of pressure from fisheries since the 1980s, the Australian populations are not commercially targeted by local fishing, but are a bycatch in Queensland's deepwater eastern king prawn trawl fishery, and Australian populations are therefor not endangered by local fishing. Since 2000, bycatch reduction devices have been required as part of Australia's fishery management plan, resulting in reduced local trawling efforts in addition to reduced bycatch.\nClimate change may be a future threat for the species.\n\n\n== Reproduction ==\nT. hypargyreus consumes plankton, increasing consumption shortly before spawning. The fish become sexually mature at one year of age, approximately 100 mm in length.\n\n\n== Association with humans ==\nThe species is caught as trawling bycatch and sold in fish markets as a food fish. In the 1970s, the species was one of the most commercially popular fish in the South China Sea, with a peak yield of 200,000 tons, fished by both Japan and China. Major fisheries still operate in the coastal waters of Pearl River Estuary and western seas of Guangdong, China.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "It's a Man Every Time is a studio album by American country singer Jean Shepard. It was released in November 1965 by Capitol Records and featured 12 tracks. The album's title track was its only single. It was given a positive reception by Billboard magazine following its release and was her second album to make the US country chart.\n\n\n== Background, recording and content ==\nJean Shepard found success during the Honky-tonk era of country music during the 1950s. With the introduction of country pop, her career stalled in the later half of the decade. In 1963, her husband Hawkshaw Hawkins was killed in a plane crash. In 1964, she had a commercial comeback with the single \"Second Fiddle (To an Old Guitar)\". By this point, she became a regular performer on Bill Anderson's television show. In October 1965, Billboard announced that Shepard had recorded a new album and single. \nIt's a Man Every Time was recorded at the Columbia Studio in Nashville, Tennessee. Sessions were held between October 1964 and February 1965. The album was produced by Marvin Hughes and was Shepard's second album produced with him. The album contained a total of 12 tracks. Included was a song written by Johnny Cash and June Carter called \"Ain't You Ashamed\". Another song was composed by Conway Twitty titled \"Let Me Be the Judge\". The liner notes described the track \"Billy Christian\" as a song about \"a gallivanting husband\" and called the title track \"plaintive elegance\".\n\n\n== Release, critical reception, chart performance and singles ==\n\nIt's a Man Every Time was released by Capitol Records in November 1965. It was the sixth studio album of Shepard's career. The label distributed the album as a vinyl LP, offered in both mono and stereo formats. Six songs were included on either side of the disc. Billboard gave the album a positive response in November 1965, calling the songs \"pleasurable\" and \"the kind of songs she's made famous and which made her famous\". AllMusic did not provide a written review but rated it three out of five stars. It's a Man Every Time was Shepard's second album to make the US Billboard Top Country Albums chart. Following its release, it reached the number 19 position on the chart. The album's only single was its title track, which was issued by Capitol in September 1965.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Chart performance ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ockwell's Glove Factory, also known as the Old Town Hall, is a historic building in Cricklade, a town in Wiltshire in England.\nThe building was constructed in 1861, as a replacement for a 16th-century town hall.  It was designed by James Lansdown.  The building was used for meetings of the parish council, the Petty Sessions, and the manorial courts.  In 1862, while St Sampson's Church was being restored, services were held in the town hall.\nIn 1933, the building was sold to Charles Ockwell & Company, a glove manufacturer which was the town's largest employer.  A new Cricklade Town Hall was constructed, and Ockwell converted the old building into a factory.  During World War II, the building was extended, to increase production on military contracts.  However, the company closed in 1994.\nIn 1996, the building was purchased by North Wiltshire District Council.  Conversion into offices commenced in 2000, and in 2002, Cricklade Town Council relocated to the ground floor of the building, while the town's library moved into the first floor.\nThe two-storey building is three bays wide, and has a central carriage entrance.  It is built of limestone, with a Welsh slate roof.  There is a central statue of Ceres, which is said to have come from the Great Exhibition.  The building was grade II listed in 1976.\n\n\n== References ==",

It took place at the Whitaker Fields at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, Alabama from Thursday, November 18 to Saturday, November 20, 2004, but unfortunately the tournament was rained out before a tournament could be crowned in any division. The only division to have a continuation was the men's championship division which took place at the Red Mountain Soccer Complex in Mesa, Arizona on January 8, 2005.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Jane C. Purcell Coffee (1944–2022) was an American mathematician, one of the first women to earn a doctorate in mathematics at the University of Pennsylvania, and the founder of the Teacher Education Honors Academy at the College of Staten Island.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nCoffee was the daughter of James Purcell, a civil engineer and Democratic Party politician, who died when she was young. She was born in Meriden, Connecticut in 1944, and became the valedictorian of O.H. Platt High School in Meriden. She attended Smith College on a scholarship, where mathematics professor Neal McCoy became a faculty mentor. There, she met her future husband, legal scholar John C. Coffee Jr., a student at Amherst College. She graduated from Smith in 1966.\nNext, she went to the University of Pennsylvania for graduate study in mathematics, while John Coffee studied law at Yale University. She persisted as \"one of the first women in her PhD program\" despite facing discriminatory practices such as segregating her with the mathematicians' wives at regular gatherings where the male mathematicians in the department would discuss their research. She completed her Ph.D. in 1970, with a thesis on abstract algebra, A Condition for a Filtered Ring to be Isomorphic to its Associated Graded Ring, supervised by Murray Gerstenhaber.\n\n\n== Career and later life ==\nIn order to avoid hiring discrimination, Coffee applied to faculty positions using only her first initial, \"J.\". This led to a job offer at Richmond College, which later became the College of Staten Island, and she began working there in 1970.\nDuring this time, she lived with her husband in Maplewood, New Jersey, commuting to their jobs in Staten Island and in New York City, respectively. Their daughter, Megan Coffee (now a medical researcher at Columbia University) was born in 1976. In the late 1970s, Coffee took a new faculty position, at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, at about the same time as her husband became a professor at Georgetown University in Washington, DC. As child care, she sat her daughter at the back of her classroom at the academy.\nAfter this, Coffee returned to the College of Staten Island, as chair of mathematics, and her husband moved to Columbia University. An incident from this time spurred her creation of the college's Teacher Education Honors Academy: she met a woman on a train who freely confessed her innumeracy, only to discover later that the same woman was a teacher at her daughter's elementary school. The academy aimed at improving that situation by preparing college students for a career as a secondary school STEM educator.\nShe died on September 23, 2022.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "Keilschrifttexte aus Assur religiösen Inhalts, often abbreviated as KAR, is a two-volume German publication by the Assyriologist Erich Ebeling from 1919 to 1923. The work offers a critical edition of several hundred cuneiform tablets discovered during 1903–1914 German excavations directed by Walter Andrae and Julius Jordan in the former Assyrian capital city Assur, dating to the reign of Ashurbanipal. The compiled inscriptions also form one of the main primary sources for the tablets used in reconstructing the famous creation epic, the Enuma Elish. Inscriptions in KAR are itemized according to the order of their appearance in the work. Therefore, the 34th tablet is numbered as KAR 34. Volume 1 contains inscriptions KAR 1–175, and Volume 2 contains inscriptions KAR 176–472.\nOne of the most important inscriptions from KAR is KAR 307, an inscription from the 1st millennium BC with 63 lines that contain a concentrated amount of information in helping understand the ancient near eastern cosmos. Another significant tablet from Ebeling's collection is KAR 158, which continues to be studied as containing one of the closest parallels to the biblical Song of Songs. KAR 44, otherwise known as the Exorcists Manual and composed by a figure named Esagil-kin-apli, is also prominent. Several important medical texts would also be included, but a future, more dedicated work by Ebeling and Reginald Campbell Thompson, namely the four-volume Keilschrifttexte medizinischen Inhalts, presented a collection of works that quickly surpassed KAR in enabling a broader understanding of Babylonian and Assyrian medicine.\nA number of inscriptions from KAR have been digitized and more information about them can now be found on databases including the Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative and Oracc (Open Richly Annotated Cuneiform Corpus).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nGeller, M.J.

A new town hall was designed by Eric Cole and erected between 1932 and 1933.  It included a main hall with stage and sprung dance floor, and a committee room.  It is in the arts and crafts style, reminiscent of the work of Charles Voysey.  In 1945, a painting was donated to the hall, which was identified in 1993 as \"Les Cinq Sens\", an Old Master which sold for £68,000.\nThe venue hosts a variety of community events, including since 2013 a weekly cinema.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Philippsburg (German: Schloss Philippsburg)) was a former Baroque-style palace in Ehrenbreitstein, a district of the city of Koblenz in Germany. It was situated on the banks of the Rhine river, below the Ehrenbreitstein Fortress. Constructed between 1626 and 1632 by Philipp Christoph von Sötern (1567–1652), Prince-Elector of Trier, it served as the main residence of the Archbishops and Prince-Electors of Trier until 1786. The palace had similarities to Schloss Johannisburg in Aschaffenburg, as they have the same architect.\nIn 1786, Prince-Elector Clemens Wenceslaus of Saxony (1739–1812) erected a new electoral palace in Koblenz on the opposite bank of the Rhine, which then became the primary residence.\nDuring the Napoleonic era, the French army blew up the Ehrenbreitstein fortress in 1801, causing the Philippsburg palace to suffer significant damage and necessitating its demolition. Today, nothing remains of the palace, once one of the largest and most significant Baroque buildings on the Rhine. Only the adjacent structures (the Pagerie, Dicasterial building, Krummstall, and Marstall) have withstood the test of time.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Philipp Christoph von Sötern ===\n\nDuring the Thirty Years' War, Prince-Elector Philipp Christoph von Sötern (1567–1652) found it necessary to relocate his residence away from Trier, which faced constant threats from France. Opting for a more secure location, he chose to erect a new palace in Koblenz. Positioned below the Ehrenbreitstein fortress, the most formidable stronghold of the Electorate of Trier, directly on the banks of the Rhine River, Philippsburg was built between 1626 and 1632.\nThe architect was Georg Ridinger, who also designed Schloss Johannisburg in Aschaffenburg, for the Prince-Electors of Mainz, between 1605 and 1614. The works were executed by master builder Albrecht Beyer from Bamberg. They created a bastioned residential palace.\nInitially aligned with the Catholic League, Sötern's deteriorating relations with the Habsburgs prompted him to switch sides to France, opposing Emperor Ferdinand II. In 1630, upon the request of its inhabitants, imperial troops occupied Trier. With support from French forces, Sötern regained control of the city in 1632. In return and to shield his bishoprics from Swedish troops, Sötern permitted France to occupy the Ehrenbreitstein fortress. However, imperial forces under Christopher of East Frisia unexpectedly recaptured Trier in 1635, leading to Sötern's subsequent imprisonment in Linz from 1635 to 1645.\n\n\n=== 17th and 18th century: main residence of the Electors of Trier ===\n\nSuccessive Prince-Electors continued to maintain Philippsburg as their primary residence, solidifying its position as the epicenter of the Electorate's political and cultural life.\nFurthermore, the palace underwent additional expansion. Prince-Elector Karl Kaspar von der Leyen (1618–1676) oversaw the construction of a pathway behind the palace, leading up to the Ehrenbreitstein Fortress and carved into the rock. Along this pathway, to the south of the palace, court architect Johann Christoph Sebastiani (1640–1701), commissioned by Prince-Elector Johann Hugo von Orsbeck (1634–1711), erected a fortress gatehouse between 1690 and 1692. This gatehouse, known as the Pagerie, served as the New Chancellery.\nAt the entrance of Philippsburg, Prince-Elector Franz Georg von Schönborn (1682–1756) oversaw the construction of the Dicasterial Building (German: Dikasterialgebäude) between 1738 and 1749. Designed by Balthasar Neumann (1687–1753) and supervised by his pupil Johannes Seiz (1717–1779), this structure served as the central administration of the Electorate. Adjacent to the Dicasterial Building, the so-called Curved Stables (German: Krummstall) were erected between 1744 and 1747 to provide accommodations for soldiers, personnel, and workshops. At the same time, Balthasar Neumann designed the Schönbornslust palace as a new summer residence for Franz Georg.\nFollowing Franz Georg's reign, his successor Johann IX Philipp von Walderdorff (1701–1768) expanded the palace complex between 1762 and 1763 by adding new stables adjacent to the Dicasterial Building. These stables (German: Marstall) were also designed by Johannes Seiz.\n\n\n=== Clemens Wenzeslaus of Saxony moves his residence to the opposite bank ===\n\nFrom 1778 to 1786, during the construction of the Electoral Palace in Koblenz, the Dicasterial Building served as the residence of Prince-Elector Clemens Wenzeslaus of Saxony (1739–1812), as he no longer wanted to reside in the Philippsburg due to building damage, poor living conditions, and the risk of rockfalls. In 1786, the elector finally moved into the newly built Electoral palace in Koblenz.\nIn the following years, Philippsburg was only partially used, including by metalworking businesses; otherwise, the building steadily deteriorated, so that it was already in very poor condition before its destruction, and individual parts had to be demolished due to dilapidation.\n\n\n=== Napoleonic times: the palace is being demolished ===\nKoblenz was conquered by French revolutionary troops in the First Coalition War in 1794. After four times being sieged, the Ehrenbreitstein Fortress also surrendered in 1799. As the French had to evacuate the areas on the right bank of the Rhine according to the Peace of Lunéville, they blew up the old Electoral fortress on the Ehrenbreitstein beforehand in 1801. The underlying Philippsburg was so severely damaged during the demolition that it had to be demolished. Only a few wall remnants have survived to this day.\nSince the 19th century, a road to Vallendar (now B 42) and the right bank railway line have passed over the former palace grounds. However, the Dicasterial Building, Krummstall, Marstall, and Pagerie have remained intact, still hinting at the former glory of the residence. The Prussians used these buildings from 1815 as a coin barracks.\nAs of 2002, the remaining buildings of the Philippsburg are part of the World Heritage Site and Cultural landscape ‘‘Kulturlandschaft Oberes Mittelrheintal’’.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Philippsburg ===\nThe electoral residence was a three-story palace built in the style of early Baroque architecture. The length of the palace measured 160 meters, divided into seven wings surrounding three rectangular courtyards, with the central courtyard opening towards the Rhine, while the lateral courtyards faced the hill of the Ehrenbreitstein fortress. Towering prominently at its four corners were turrets crowned with stepped roofs. They have similarities with the towers of Schloss Johannisburg in Aschaffenburg.\nThe palace was surrounded by its own bastioned fortifications with moats on the north and south sides As bastioned residential palace, it has similarities with the 'Palazzo in Fortezza' model, where a noble residence is integrated or constructed within a fortress or fortified complex. Similar examples of such structures include the citadel in Jülich, Castle Buren and Breda Castle in the Netherlands, Villa Farnese in Caprarola, Italy, Krzyżtopór castle and Łańcut Castle in Poland. These types of palaces were predominantly constructed during the 16th and 17th centuries.\nMost palaces created at the start of the 17th century were closed four wing complexes, such as Schloss Johannisberg or Schloss Weilburg. What the Philippsburg makes special, is that it had an open courtyard facing the Rhine river.\nThe electoral yacht harbor developed from the southern moat, expanded in 1819 as a protective harbor for the pontoon bridge but was abandoned and filled in 1886.\nPhilippsburg Palace boasted an outstanding interior decor, which continued to be perfected until the end of the 18th century. Renowned stucco artists, painters, gilders, and sculptors contributed to the high-quality interior decoration. Evidence of this includes the stucco work by Nicolo Carcano and the ceiling painting by Lazaro Maria Sanguinetti in the 400 m2 grand ballroom on the third floor. Sanguinetti also painted frescoes in the antechamber and five other rooms. Carlo Maria Pozzi was also involved as a stucco artist in the palace. Parts of this interior decoration, especially from the courtyard chapel, were transferred to churches in the surrounding area after the demolition of the palace in 1799.\nThe name ‘‘Philippsburg’’ (English: Philip's castle) likely originated only in the 19th century, following the destruction of the palace, and does not appear in contemporary sources. On an engraving by Wenceslaus Hollar, the palace is named ‘‘Philipsthal’’ (English: Philip's valley).\n\n\n=== Pagerie ===\n\nThe Pagerie is situated south of the former Philippsburg palace and was constructed as a fortress gatehouse along the path leading up to Ehrenbreitstein Fortress. It stands as the sole surviving structure of the baroque fortress from the Electoral period.\nThe main building, positioned perpendicular to the path and parallel to the slope, features an annex with an obtuse angle. A plaque above the gate, set in the parapet of the window directly above it, commemorates the construction of the path by Prince-Elector Karl Kaspar von der Leyen. The gate, resembling a portcullis, is set within a tall and uniformly rusticated basement level. The three-axis main floor above is generously fenestrated, with its central axis projecting upward as a dormer before continuing into the mansard roof, added only in 1801. The gable bears the coat of arms of Prince-Elector Johann Hugo von Orsbeck. The gray and yellow painted facade of the baroque plaster structure is adorned with pilasters. Inside, a stone spiral staircase, crafted by Master Lorenz Staudacher, features steps made of black marble and a profiled handrail. For the straight staircase leading to the basement, old stones from the demolished palace were repurposed for repair purposes.\nInitially utilized as the New Chancellery, the rooms later served as residences for knights, then as living and schooling quarters for pages under Elector Clemens Wenzeslaus of Saxony, and eventually as an orphanage.\nWith the construction of the Prussian Ehrenbreitstein Fortress at the beginning of the 19th century, the path was rebuilt with a shallower incline, passing directly behind the Pagerie. In the process, the path was carved into the northern corner of the building.\n\n\n=== Dicasterial Building (Dikasterialgebäude) ===\n\nThe former governmental and administrative building of the Electorate is a three-story structure oriented parallel to the Rhine. The layout, measuring 25:4 axes, features flat central and corner projections, as well as a gabled roof with mansard roofs over the projections. The segmental-arched windows are grouped into columns. The corner projections, each spanning seven axes, are framed by full-height rusticated pilasters, with a pilaster-framed entrance and pediment in the center of each. The central three axes of the roof zone boast a balustrade row with vase finials. The three-axis central projection, featuring smooth pilasters, houses the main entrance and sports a pediment with a broken curved contour, displaying the coat of arms of Prince-Elector Franz Georg von Schönborn held by crowned double-tailed lions. The pediment is crowned by three figures representing the personifications of Science, Justice, and Agriculture (from left to right). Additionally, exterior putti with their corresponding attributes adorn the building. Behind the larger round-arched windows in the center, which have a preceding balcony with wrought-iron grilles, lies the ballroom.\nInternally, all rooms are vaulted, except for those on the first and second floors at the rear, which were destroyed by a bomb strike during the air raids on Koblenz. The staircases are built into the rear corners of the building and adorned with protruding terminal pilasters. Nothing remains of the original interior furnishings.\n\n\n=== Curved Stables (Krummstall) ===\nThe Curved Stables are located behind the Dicasterial Building. It is a plain three-story structure with 41 axes, of which the central 15 axes curve backward in a segmental layout. A lower floor was added in 1880. The segmental-arched windows are framed in a different color. The edges of the building and the central axis are adorned with pilasters. In the center, a cartouche with the electoral coat of arms is mounted. The ground floor features cross-vaulting, partially supported by cast iron columns.\n\n\n=== Stables (Marstall) ===\nSouth of the Curved Stables, the stables are situated. This two-story building with a mansard roof features two wings angled sharply towards each other, with the rear wing marking the northern boundary of the electoral yacht harbor. The wing facing the Rhine accommodates the main entrance, adorned with Ionic double pilasters. Above it, a prominent entablature stands out, supporting a fully sculpted group of a rearing horse with a stable boy, flanked by obelisks bearing flags, instruments, and the Electoral hat, all standing free before the roof. The structure, adorned with rusticating pilasters, reflects the design of the Dicasterial Building. The ground floor, originally housing 69 horse stalls, is vaulted with cross-ribbed vaults, supported by robust Tuscan columns made of basalt.\n\n\n== See also ==\nOther palaces, residences and hunting lodges of the Prince-Electors of Trier:\n\nElectoral Palace, Koblenz\nElectoral Palace, Trier\nThe yellow castle of Montabaur\nSchloss in Engers\nSchloss Kärlich in Mülheim-Kärlich\nSchloss Philippsfreude\nSchloss Schönbornslust\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Literature ==\nBátori, Ingrid; Kerber, Dieter; Schmidt, Hans Josef, eds.

        "content": "\"Julieta\" is a song by the Argentine rapper and singer Paulo Londra. It was released by Warner Music Latina as the sixth single from his second studio album Back to the Game (2022). The song marked Londra's return to the reggaeton genre that made him known in 2018 and 2019 for his singles \"Adán y Eva\" and \"Tal Vez\" respectively.\n\n\n== Background and composition ==\nIn July 2022, Londra revealed in an Instagram post that he would release a different song every Thursday between that month and August, among which \"Julieta\" was announced, which would be released on August 4, 2022. On August 1, 2022, Londra released a teaser of the music video.\n\"Julieta\" is a romantic reggaeton song composed by Londra, Federico Vindver and Alejandro Ramírez Suárez, while the musical production was done by Sky Rompiendo and Vindver. The title of the song is inspired by the character Juliet from William Shakespeare's romantic tragedy Romeo and Juliet (1597), where she cannot live her love with her lover Romeo. The lyrics of the song, precisely, represent an impossible love that drives Londra crazy for not knowing if it is reciprocated.\n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe music video was directed by Gabriel Bosisio, produced by Buena Productora and was filmed in Buenos Aires. The video clip  is based on the elements of 80's horror films and shows Londra hospitalized and strapped to a gurney in a psychiatric hospital. In the doctors' attempt to give him an electroshock, Londra manages to escape from the place, while the medical staff tries to capture him and other patients who started a rebellion in the center.\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\nOn its first day of release, \"Julieta\" achieved two and a half million views on YouTube, placing the video at the top of the music trends in Argentina.

        "content": "When All the Leaves Are Gone is a Canadian short drama film, directed by Alanis Obomsawin and released in 2010. One of just two narrative fiction films, alongside Sigwan, that Obomsawin made in a career otherwise devoted entirely to documentary films, the film dramatizes Obomsawin's childhood experiences through the story of Wato (Rosalie Dumas), a young girl experiencing anti-indigenous prejudice as the only First Nations student in an otherwise all-white school in the 1940s, who finds comfort and strength in the magical world of her dreams.\nThe cast also includes Daphnée Vincent, Justine Rolland, Marie-Josée Corneau, Margie Hoff, Yves Nolin Allaire and Jean-Claude Cloutier, with voice dubbing in the English version performed by Lynne Adams, Katie Patewabano, Jennifer Seguin and Jennifer Suleteanu.\nThe film was also released Wabanaki, Atikamekw, Innu and Inuktitut language versions.\nThe film was screened at the 2021 Toronto International Film Festival, as part of its special Celebrating Alanis retrospective of Obomsawin's films.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWhen All the Leaves Are Gone at IMDb",

        "content": "The 2024–25 Phoenix Suns season is the 57th season of the franchise in the National Basketball Association (NBA), as well as their 32nd season at the Footprint Center. It is also their second full season under the ownership group led by Mat Ishbia and Justin Ishbia after the brothers purchased the team on February 8, 2023, and their second season with their \"Big Three\" superteam of Devin Booker, Kevin Durant, and Bradley Beal together. However, this will be their third season in a row with a new head coach taking over following the announcement of Frank Vogel's firing on May 9, 2024, this time having 2021 NBA Finals champion coach Mike Budenholzer taking over as the new head coach two days later. Not only that, this is also their first season since the 2019–20 season where the Suns would properly utilize the NBA G League again with their own squad (this time, the yet to be named Phoenix NBA G League team) after previously selling the Northern Arizona Suns to the Detroit Pistons during that season's suspension/reinstatement period and subsequently shutting down that G League team for the following season afterward in a move unrelated to their sale, thus marking the first time where every NBA team would utilize their own G League affiliate during a season. Entering this season, the Suns are looking to improve upon their previous season's record of 49–33, which left them with a sixth-place finish in the Western Conference, as well as look to enter the playoffs for the fifth straight season in a row after previously missing out on the playoffs for a decade straight and improve upon their dismal first round performance from last season.\n\n\n== Off-season ==\n\n\n=== Draft ===\n\nThe Suns entered this draft period (which would last for two days instead of just one day like it was ever since the NBA draft was only two rounds long back in 1989) with only their own first-round pick (that was made 22nd after a tiebreaker with two other teams with the same record as them and that they also kept as their own pick following multiple trades revolving around a first-round pick swap that they made last season) after also trading away their own second-round pick this year as a part of their massive Bradley Beal trade from last season. They also originally had a second-round pick that was from the Denver Nuggets (which would have been made late into the second-round) that they acquired from the Orlando Magic the previous season, but that pick was ultimately vacated from them early on into that season after the NBA discovered the Suns had engaged in conversations with then-Portland Trail Blazers center Drew Eubanks before that season's free agency period officially began. They also held draft rights to the San Antonio Spurs' second-round pick as well had it fell into a certain condition due to a previous trade involving Cameron Payne, but that pick would not be conveyed to them due to the Spurs performing far below expectations of that draft pick's range limitations.\n\n\n=== Coaching changes ===\nOn April 16, 2024, assistant coach Kevin Young was hired as a head coach for Brigham Young University's men's basketball team (though he would stay for the team's brief 2024 playoff run) after their previous coach, Mark Pope, left BYU to be the new head coach for the University of Kentucky, replacing John Calipari there after he left them for the University of Arkansas. Young had previous hints of leaving for a head coaching position with him being considered a serious candidate for the head coach position for both the Brooklyn Nets and Charlotte Hornets before being hired by BYU. He was also the highest paid assistant coach at the time of his departure.\nOn May 9, following weeks of deliberation after a disappointing first round exit against the Minnesota Timberwolves in the 2024 NBA playoffs, the Suns decided to fire head coach Frank Vogel after finishing only one season of his five-year, $31 million deal that he had originally signed with the team. Unlike the previous season's coaching search where it was an extensive one, the Suns would only look at a select few candidates to replace Vogel's position, with Holbrook, Arizona native Mike Budenholzer (the head coach the won the 2021 NBA Finals over the Suns) being considered a prominent part of their new head coach search before ultimately getting the position two days later with a five-year deal worth $50 million. Following Budenholzer's hiring, the Suns later announced that none of Vogel's assistant coaches from last season would be retained for the new coaching staff led by Budenholzer this season. However, the Suns did offer one of their former assistant coaches, David Fizdale, a new role in the team's front office instead, though it was reported that Fizdale ultimately turned that offer down.\n\n\n=== Free agency ===\nEntering free agency, Bol Bol, Royce O'Neale, Isaiah Thomas, and Thaddeus Young would all become unrestricted free agents, though O'Neale has the potential to earn a contract extension before June 29 in order to take himself off the market similar to that of Grayson Allen earlier in the year (albeit for less money due to him being traded to Phoenix in February last season). In addition to them, Drew Eubanks, Eric Gordon, Damion Lee, and Josh Okogie all have player options that they would need to pick up sometime before June 29 in order to avoid free agency. Also joining the other players in free agency are the team's two-way contracts from last season in Saben Lee, Udoka Azubuike, and Ish Wainright, though two of those three players would be ineligible for a new two-way contract due to them already being in the NBA for four seasons now. Starting on July 1, the Suns will be one of a select few teams to be fully restricted by the NBA's newer second tax apron limitations, which will implement greater restrictions on teams that had a payroll of over $190 million during the previous season.\n\n\n== Roster ==\n\n\n== Standings ==\n\n\n=== Division ===\nTemplate:2024–25 NBA Pacific standings\n\n\n=== Conference ===\nTemplate:2024–25 NBA West standings\n\n\n== Game log ==\n\n\n=== Regular season ===\n\n\n==== In-Season Tournament ====\n\nThis is the second regular season where all the NBA teams competed in a mid-season tournament setting following the success of the 2023 NBA In-Season Tournament.\n\n\n== Awards, honors, and records ==\nOn August 16–17, 2024, both long-time former Suns player Walter Davis and one-time former Suns player Vince Carter will be inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame for the Class of 2024 (Davis' induction being posthumous) alongside former Phoenix Mercury All-Star Michele Timms.\n\n\n== Transactions ==\n\n\n=== Free agency ===\n\n\n==== Re-signed ====\n\n\n==== Additions ====\n\n\n==== Subtractions ====\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "55 Broad Street is a 30-story building at Broad Street and Beaver Street in the Financial District of Manhattan in New York City, U.S.  It adjoins 15 William, a skyscraper to the east.  The building was constructed from 1964 to 1967, and initially operated as the headquarters of the trading firm Goldman Sachs from 1967 to 1983.  It continued as an office building afterward.  In 2023, a redevelopment effort began which is changing the building from commercial space into residential apartments.  The project is expected to create 571 apartments and finish around 2025.\nThe building was owned by the Rudin Management Company from 1964 to 2023; the building was taken over by Silverstein Properties and Metro Loft for the redevelopment effort, although Rudin maintains a stake in the project.  Ares Real Estate Group has also invested in the redevelopment venture.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe area was previously covered by two connected 10-story buildings owned by the Areljay Company, 55 Broad Street and 45 Beaver Street.  The former 55 Broad Street had been constructed in a colonnaded neo‐Roman style in 1921, and 45 Beaver had been built as an annex in 1931.  The main tenant of both buildings was the bank Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, which had previously owned the buildings before selling to Areljay in 1951 and continuing on as tenants.   Both buildings were bought by Samuel Rudin in October 1964, who arranged for the demolition of both to clear the site so the construction of the new 55 Broad Street could begin.\nThe new 30-story skyscraper was built by the firm Emery Roth & Sons, and was finished in 1967.  Goldman Sachs, in its early growing years, was the building's tenant during its first 16 years.  Goldman moved out in 1983 due to outgrowing it, going to the nearby 85 Broad Street.  In 1985, investment bank Drexel Burnham Lambert (later infamous as the company that disgraced financier Michael Milken worked at) moved in as the main tenant.  The firm went bust in 1990, leaving the building empty.  Rudin spent around $40 million renovating the building over the next five years to remove asbestos and to add top-of-the-line for the era broadband and Internet connectivity, attracting tech companies to the building.  New tenants included Sun Microsystems and a space for tech startup \"incubators\" run by Ernst & Young.  Many of these left after the dot-com bust of 2000.  The Rudin family had trouble keeping the space profitably rented in the 2010s, and came to the conclusion that the building was not viable continuing as office space.  The Rudins did consider knocking down the building and building a taller replacement.  However, changes in zoning rules since the 1960s would have meant having to give up space, and such a project was estimated at requiring 600 million dollars.  The plans for the potential new building were leaked to the public in 2016, but nothing ultimately came of them.\nThe coronavirus pandemic in 2020 further increased commercial vacancy rates, increasing the urgency of such a project, while residential vacancy rates remained very low.  The Rudins sold most of their stake to Nathan Berman of Metro Loft and Silverstein Properties with the agreement that Metro Loft would lead a residential conversion.  Silverstein and Metro Loft originally intended to buy the building for $180 million in May 2022, but increasing interest rates forced the postponement of the sale.  The building was finally sold in July 2023 for $173 million. The owners also took out a construction loan for the project at $220 million.  The next month, CetraRuddy was hired as the project's architect.  The plans called for the building to be converted into 571 apartments. Silverstein's CEO Marty Burger cited the \"great floor plate, great size, great ceiling heights\" as reasons for his company's decision to convert 55 Broad Street into a residential building.\nThe building's redevelopment is planned to be an all-electric residential building, which is not how buildings were traditionally made in New York.  Environmental law changes in the 2010s and 2020s discouraged the use of gas for heating, and it also spared the redevelopment the trouble of including gas piping in the new layout.  Many of the apartments are expected to be small studio apartments, aimed at recent college graduates working in the area without a family.  One firm that had been renting office space as of 2023 initially sued to keep their lease, but settled out of court and agreed to move out.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nA 2024 article in The New Yorker by D. T. Max called the building's past as an office space \"an unlovable building in an unlivable neighborhood\" and wrote that the architecture firm was seeking to merely maximize the amount of rentable office space in its style of construction, which it derisively called a \"stack of boxes.\"  Lower Manhattan had very few people living in it during the 1970s–1990s, with the neighborhood emptying out at night as the office workers went home, elsewhere.  The redevelopment is part of a trend since 2000 where the area has become somewhat more balanced, with more residential space and fewer office buildings.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Noreen Goldman is an American social scientist and the Hughes-Rogers Professor of Demography and Public Affairs at Princeton University. She studies social and economic factors and how they impact adult health. She was elected a Member of the National Academy of Sciences in 2024.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nGoldman studied mathematics at New York University for her undergraduate studies, and was ranked top of her class. She moved to Harvard University for her doctoral research, where she specialised in statistics and population sciences. She moved to the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health for her doctoral research, where she studied the demography of kin.\n\n\n== Research and career ==\nGoldman spent her entire career at Princeton University, where she was made an Endowed Professor in 2007. Her research combines demographic and epidemiological investigations into the impact of social and economic factors on adult health. Her early work considered the impact of marital status on health and mortality, revealing that widowed men had poorer life expectancies than widowed women.  Goldman analysed the quality of data from the World Fertility Survey, which provided her with useful experience in survey design. She designed and led large-scale population surveys that investigate the causes of illness for women and children in rural communities. She created an event history calendar to understand the timelines of maternal and child health in Guatemala, and investigated the social effects of health in Taiwan. She worked with cardiologists and molecular biologists to understand the cardiac health of children born in the 1990s, revealing that Black and Hispanic patients had considerably lower Life's Essential 8 scores than their white counterparts.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic studied the changing life expectancies of different groups in the United States. She found that life expectancy of Hispanic Native Americans decreased by four years from 2019. She demonstrated that the life expectancy of African Americans and Latino populations reduced by 3 – 4 times that of white people, and that the pandemic would reverse ten years of progress made toward closing gaps in life expectancy. She went on to show that Filipino men had a larger decline in life expectancy of all Asian American groups.\n\n\n== Awards and honours ==\n1991 Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioural Sciences\n2024 Elected Member of the National Academy of Sciences\n2024 Honoured member of the Population Association of America\n\n\n== References ==\nY R Hu; N Goldman (1 May 1990). \"Mortality differentials by marital status: an international comparison\".

However, the 3F doesn't provide service along Langston Boulevard or Rosslyn but instead goes straight to East Falls Church station upon leaving Washington, D.C.\n\n\n=== Route 3F Stops ===\n\n\n=== Route 3Y Stops ===\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== DirectLee to DC ===\nIn 2004, WMATA announced that new route 3Y would enter service as the Lee Highway-Farragut Square Line, operating between the Lee Heights/Waverly Hills area and McPherson Square via North Woodrow Street, turn right onto Lee Highway, continue along I-66 and The Theodore Roosevelt Bridge, E Street Expressway, E Street, turning left onto 18th Street, right onto K Street, right onto14th Street to the terminal stand on the west side of 14th Street, south of I (Eye) Street.\nOn December 13, 2015, the route was extended to East Falls Church station.  Service along North George Mason Drive, Patrick Henry Drive and North Harrison Street was discontinued and is now provided by ART 51.\nAfter a suspension, Route 3Y service was restored between Farragut Square and Lee Highway & North George Mason Drive. However, service to East Falls Church was fully eliminated. In addition, the route was changed to begin northbound on 13th & H streets NW and operate along I (Eye) Street NW. Service would no longer operate along 15th & K streets NW.\nOn December 17, 2021 service was re-extended to East Falls Church station. On the same day, Route 3F began service, operating between Farragut Square and East Falls Church.\nDue to weight restrictions, on May 29, 2022, the line was rerouted off of Roosevelt Bridge. Eastbound trips used the Arlington Memorial Bridge, eliminating service on E Street NW & 20 Street NW and westbound trips used the Whitehurst Freeway and Key Bridge. Due to the renaming of Langston Boulevard from Lee Highway, the Line was renamed to its current name, the \"Langton Boulevard-McPherson Square Line.\"\n\n\n=== Proposed elimination ===\nIn WMATA's FY2025 proposed budget, they proposed to eliminate routes 3Y and 3F. Alternative service would be provided by ART Route 55 and the Washington Metro's Orange and Silver Lines.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Prizren Front (Albanian: Fronti i Prizrenit; Serbian: Призренски фронт, romanized: Prizrenski Front) was fought during the Kosovo War between the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) which was supported by NATO and the Kosovo Force (KFOR), and the Yugoslav Army and Yugoslav Police. The Prizren Front was fought in the District of Prizren from July 7, 1998, through June 11, 1999, with a clash occurring on June 13, 1999.\nKLA forces entered Prizren under guard of German KFOR troops on June 14, 1999. Following the Kumanovo Agreement, Yugoslav forces withdrew from Kosovo.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1992–1993, ethnic Albanians created the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) which started attacking Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) police forces and secret-service officials who abused Albanian civilians in 1995. Starting in 1998, the KLA was involved in frontal battle, with increasing numbers of Yugoslav security forces. Escalating tensions led to the Kosovo War in February 1998.\n\n\n== Ambush in Billushe ==\nOn July 7, 1998, Yugoslav forces failed to liquidate a KLA unit in Billushe and were forced to retreat. The Yugoslav army and police pledged retaliation for the ambush, strategizing an offensive against KLA positions in what had been declared a KLA free zone.\n\n\n== First Battle of Vërrin ==\nAround 1:30 pm, the Yugoslav forces tried to enter from the Tusus neighborhood, in the direction of Leskovec, Lybeçeva, and towards the village of Hoçë e Qytetit. KLA forces started attacking the Yugoslav forces. The first day of confrontation between the two forces lasted 3 hours and 40 minutes. On the part of the KLA soldiers, there were neither killed nor injured, while the Yugoslav forces were separated with losses.\n\n\n== Second Battle of Vërrin ==\nOn Monday, August 31, Yugoslav Police surrounded Lez. By Tuesday morning, September 1, 1998, around 8:00 a.m, they commenced shelling KLA positions in the hills surrounding the village. The villagers fled to nearby Ljubičevo, while the KLA members remained. The night before the second offensive, the KLA had information about large movements of Yugoslav troops around the territories where the KLA positions were located. The KLA soldiers were all in a state of readiness in their positions, with the command of the 125th brigade being put into action.\nThe 1st Battalion observed Yugoslav movements towards the top of Cyileni, commanders Salajdin Berisha and Xhevat Berisha with a part of the soldiers went to Cyilen. On September 1, 1998, at around 7 am, Yugoslav forces began the offensive against KLA positions. Initially, the attack began in the village of Lez, where fierce fighting took place and Yugoslav forces were met with heavy resistance. At a position called Livadhet te Lavdices, a grenade exploded in the trench at this position, resulting in the deaths of four KLA members. Additionally, six KLA members were killed in the same position during the exchange of fire with the police. 3 more KLA soldiers were killed. Those killed were identified as KLA soldiers Xhevat Berisha, Salajdin Berisha, Shefqet Berisha, Hasim Berisha, Nehat Berisha, Alajdin Berisha, Bekim Berisha, Shahadin Berisha, Naip Berisha, Samidin Emini, Ibrahim Osmani, Asllan Berisha, and Izair Berisha.\nThe fighting soon spread throughout the territory of Vërrin. The Yugoslav forces shelled the positions of the 2nd Battalion from a distance, while the Yugoslav infantry tried to enter the positions of the 1st Battalion. Around 5 pm, Yugoslav forces broke through a KLA position and captured Lez. In Lez, three policemen were wounded: Miroslav Rakonjac was wounded by automatic weapons around 2:00 p.m, while Miroljub Ristić was seriously wounded, and Nenad Aleksić was lightly wounded by soldiers using automatic weapons, hand-held launchers, and mortars around 4:20 p.m.\nDuring the same night, while KLA soldiers were observing the terrain between the villages of Kushnin and Arbëri, the soldiers Tamil Shala, Refki Shala and Milaim Thaçi were ambushed. Yugoslav forces began penetrating towards the territory which was under KLA control. Kushnin, Arbëria, Lez, the headquarters of the 125th Brigade in Jeshkovo and the village itself, Hoça e Qytetit, Kushtrimi, Billushë, Poslisht as well as the KLA positions in Vërrin were shelled constantly by the Yugoslav forces.The shelling led to civilian casualties.\nThe fighting continued on September 2, fierce fighting was concentrated in the village of Jeshkovo because of the Yugoslav goal of penetrating the headquarters of the 125th Brigade, which was located in Jeshkovo. During the afternoon of September 2, Agim Shala, Avdi Shala, Besim Shala, and Fatmir Berisha died.\nHeavy shelling continued at Kushtrim and Billushë, and Yugoslav forces tried to enter Dushkaja of Poslisht, then the positions of Tusus. After some positions of the 1st Battalion were broken, the position at Tusus was in danger and the command of the 1st Battalion retreats to the village of Arbëri, while the 2nd Battalion remained at their positions. Astret Poniku, and Arsim Poniku were killed. KLA forces held their positions against the Yugoslav forces, and Jeshkova was under KLA control.\n\n\n== Battle of Paštrik ==\n\n\n=== 26–29 May: Initial KLA attack ===\nThe KLA offensive began at 04:00, the KLA attacked across a ten-mile front from their operating areas, they were supported by barrages from the Albanian army and NATO air support. The KLA quickly overran Yugoslav Observation Points and watchtowers. Once past the border some units appear to have gone to the northern side of the mountain from which they could observarmored pee the city of Gjakova. Other units went over the mountain or to the forests south of it. When Colonel Delić realized an offensive was underway, he order his troops to entrench and responded to the attack with howitzer and mortars. He ordered his artillery to target the avenues leading to the mountain. These barrages compromised the KLA's offensive capabilities for the next two days. Despite extensive use of NATO air strikes, they did little to stop Yugoslav artillery from attacking KLA supply lines within Albania. As combat continued in the border settlements, KLA sources reported that they had overrun Planeja and were moving towards Gjonaj.\n\n\n=== 1 June: Increased NATO air strikes ===\nOn 1 June NATO aircraft launched around 150 sorties on VJ targets. NATO claimed to have hit 32 artillery pieces, 9 personnel carriers, 6 armored vehicles, 4 other military vehicles, 8 mortar positions and one SA6 surface to air missile. NATO throughout the campaign kept the KLA at an arms length. The KLA offensive had reached a stalemate, and the Yugoslav army appeared to be organizing a counter offensive. NATO fearing Milošević would get a better position at the negotiating table if they recaptured the gains made by the KLA stepped up their bombing campaign. According to Diana Priest Wesley Clark told his officers \"That mountain is not going to get lost. I'm not going to have Serbs on that mountain. We'll pay for that hill with American blood if we don't help [the KLA] hold it.\" Some NATO air strikes hit KLA positions, however the KLA did not suffer any casualties from NATO friendly fire at that time. These air strikes gave the KLA opportunities to attack. The Yugoslav army responded to this by shelling settlements at the border with Albaniaincluding the settlements of Pergolaj, Golaj and Krumë. These strikes didn't hit any civilian targets, but increased the refugee flows in Kukës and put pressure on the administration. Albania responded to this by mobilizing its army to the border and conducting a high-profile live fire exercise.\n\n\n== Prizren Incident (1999) ==\nBackground\nOn 12 June 1999, two days after the approval of UN Security Council Resolution 1244, Kosovo Force (KFOR) personnel began to arrive in Kosovo to stop further hostilities between ethnic Albanians and Serbs and to coordinate efforts to secure the distribution of humanitarian aid.\n\n\n=== Arrival of the German troops ===\nIn the early hours of 13 June about 100 German soldiers arrived in Prizren from Macedonia to secure the city for another 600 incoming troops that entered at afternoon from Albania, 10 miles (16 km) to the west. Earlier, a Yugoslav Armyoutpost at Vrbnica border crossing, recently vacated by 60 soldiers, was looted and vandalized. The German soldiers were received as liberators by the ethnic Albanian inhabitants. One of their first tasks was to separate a crowd of Albanian civilians and Yugoslav troops by forming a human line, after the former pelted a convoy of civilian Serbs leaving the city. There was a tense standoff, but eventually a German officer managed to convince the Serbs to withdraw. At the Morinë border crossing, German troops compelled the Serbs to leave the outpost according to schedule when the latter tried to win more time.\n\n\n=== 6–9 June: Stalemate ===\nOn 6 June, the Yugoslav army launched a counter offensive near Planeja. As the Yugoslav soldiers advanced towards Planeja, they were hit by 82 unguided M-82 iron bombs from two B52,s and a B-1B. There are conflicting accounts about the casualties suffered by the Yugoslav troops. The Washington Post Foreign Service, which also caim that the strike involved the use of cluster munition, put the toll in \"several hundreds\". According to some testimonies from KLAfighters, they suffered serious casualties but according to other KLA reports most were able to get into safety before the impact. A ground inspection by German KFOR troops following the end of hostilities found no wreckages of any Vehiclesor tanks. On June 7, bombing and ground fighting continued around Paštrik. On June 9, the Yugoslav army retreated and the Military Technical Agreement was signed for the withdrawal of all Yugoslav forces from Kosovo.\nAs the German troops drove into downtown, along the Bistrica river, they were met by sniper fire from one of the surrounding hills and some houses; they were also allegedly fired at from a Roman Catholic church. The soldiers took cover and returned fire. A civilian woman was reportedly wounded by the snipers, while the German troops moved to defensive positions below the hill. A German fighting vehicle fired a warning burst with a general-purpose Rheinmetall MG 3 machine gun at a passing Yugoslav army truck after a Yugoslav soldier inside brandished an AK-47 assault rifle at a jeering Albanian crowd and fired two shots in the air.\nAt dusk, a yellow Zastava Skala civilian-type vehicle was seen approaching a German armored carrier outside Hotel Theranda, in the center of the city. The passenger produced an AK-47 and opened fire at the carrier and at bystanders, who fled for safety. The German soldiers in the armored vehicle, supported by a Leopard 2 tank that mounted a roadblock, shot back. Three paratroopers fired at the car with their Heckler & Koch G36 assault rifles, joined by a non-commissioned officer with his 9mm pistol and by turret-mounted 7.62mm machine guns. The combined gunfire killed the driver instantly and critically wounded the shooter. A German soldier in the armored carrier was injured in the arm, becoming the first casualty of the overall peacekeeping operation. The Germans fired a total of 180 rifle rounds and 40 machine-gun rounds. The German firepower was so intense that it pushed the car backward. The passenger eventually died of his wounds. The shooting lasted 20 minutes. The Germans said that the two individuals in the car, both Serbs, were carrying grenades and semi-automatic weapons.\nPlatoon leader Lieutenant David Ferk, who gave the order to fire back, was awarded the Gold Cross of Honour for Outstanding Deeds by German Minister of Defense Rudolf Scharping. The next day, KLA forces entered Prizren under guard of the German Kosovo Force.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2nd Mississippi Infantry Regiment was a unit of the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. The 2nd Regiment was composed of volunteer companies from North Mississippi which were sent to join the Confederate forces in Virginia in the spring of 1861. As part of the Army of Northern Virginia, the 2nd Regiment fought in many of the most decisive battles of the Eastern theater of the American Civil War, suffering heavy casualties at Antietam and Gettysburg. \n\n\n== Formation and First Battle of Bull Run ==\nThe volunteer companies of the 2nd Mississippi were assembled at Corinth in early May 1861, initially for state service, and then travelled to Virginia, arriving at Lynchburg on May 9 and mustering into Confederate service on May 10. William Clark Falkner, grandfather of the novelist William Faulkner, was elected as Colonel. The original strength of the regiment was 784 officers and men. Company L, the Liberty Guards, was formed in March 1862 as a supplemental company and joined the regiment in Virginia in April of that year.\nAs part of General Barnard Bee's brigade, the 2nd Mississippi fought at the First Battle of Bull Run in July. During this battle, the first major action of the war, the 2nd Regiment acted in support of a cavalry charge made by General J.E.B. Stuart, who wrote: \"Just after the cavalry charge our re-enforcements arrived upon the field and formed rapidly on right into line. The first was Colonel Falkner's regiment (Mississippians), whose gallantry came under my own observation\". Brigade commander General Bee was mortally wounded during the battle, and afterwards the 2nd was moved under General William H.C. Whiting's command. \n\n\n== 1862 ==\nAfter spending the winter in camp, in April 1862 the 2nd Mississippi was moved to Yorktown, Virginia and reorganized, as the Regiment's initial one-year term of service had expired. The Regiment reenlisted for the remainder of the war and new officers were elected: John Marshall Stone was chosen as commander of the regiment, Falkner returned to Mississippi and later led a Partisan Ranger unit. \nThe 2nd fought at the Battle of Seven Pines, and then the Seven Days Battles near Richmond, Virginia, with General Evander M. Law commanding the brigade. At the Battle of Gaines' Mill, the 2nd Mississippi joined an advance alongside John Bell Hood's Texas Brigade that broke through the Union lines, resulting in a Confederate victory. General Whiting wrote: \"The Second Mississippi, Colonel J. M. Stone, was skillfully handled by its commander, and sustained severe loss\". The regiment then fought at the Second Battle of Bull Run, taking part in heavy fighting as part of Hood's division. \nSubsequently, the 2nd Mississippi fought at the Battle of Antietam in September, where they were engaged in some of the heaviest fighting on the bloodiest day of the war. Hood described the battle his troops were engaged in during his advance against the Federal lines: \"the two little giant brigades of this division wrestled with this mighty force, losing hundreds of their gallant officers and men but driving the enemy from his position and forcing him to abandon his guns on our left\". All of the field officers of the 2nd Mississippi were wounded in this battle, and the Regiment overall suffered 27 dead and 127 wounded at Antietam. \n\n\n== Gettysburg ==\n\nAfter Antietam, the 2nd Regiment was reassigned to General Joseph R. Davis's Mississippi brigade and took part in the Siege of Suffolk before moving north to Pennsylvania during the Gettysburg Campaign. On the opening day of the battle, the 2nd Mississippi was among the first Confederate troops to engage Union forces, coming into contact with General John Buford's cavalry along the Chambersburg Pike to the northwest of the town of Gettysburg. Both sides suffered heavy casualties in intense fighting, with the troops of the 2nd Mississippi clashing with the 147th New York. The commander of the 147th New York was killed before he could relay the order for his troops to retreat, so the Federals held their ground while the 2nd Mississippi inflicted massive casualties on them: the New Yorkers suffered a greater than 50% casualty rate in this engagement. After taking cover in a steep-sided railroad cut north of the Chambersburg Pike, the 2nd Regiment was battered by intense enfilade fire, and the Regiment was forced to surrender after an assault by troops of the 6th Wisconsin. Approximately 127 men and officers, amounting to about 25% of the 2nd Regiment's strength surrendered at the railroad cut.\nAnother detachment of the 2nd Mississippi was not captured, and joined Pickett's Charge on the last day of the battle. Of the approximately 60 troops of the 2nd who joined the charge, only one was not captured or wounded. Col. John M. Stone was wounded during the battle, Lt. Col. David W. Humphries was killed, and Major John A. Blair was captured at the railroad cut. The remnant of the Regiment took part in the Battle of Williamsport during the retreat from Gettysburg and the Battle of Bristoe Station in October.\n\n\n== 1864–1865 ==\nDuring the Battle of the Wilderness in May 1864, the Regiment's Col. Stone commanded a brigade comprising the 2nd, 11th, and 42d Mississippi Regiments, along with the 55th North Carolina and First Confederate Battalion. On the morning of May 6, Stone's brigade held their ground against a Union attack until General James Longstreet's cavalry could counterattack. The Regiment fought at the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, the Battle of North Anna, and the Battle of Cold Harbor during Union General Ulysses S. Grant's Overland Campaign. \nAfterwards, the Regiment was moved to support the Confederate defensive lines during the Siege of Petersburg, fighting in numerous engagements until the fall of the city to Union forces in late March, 1865. At the time of the final Confederate surrender, 1 officer and 19 men were all that remained of the 2nd Mississippi. \n\n\n== Commanders ==\nCommanders of the 2nd Mississippi Infantry: \n\nCol. William Clark Falkner\nCol. John Marshall Stone\nLt. Col. Bentley B. Boone\nLt. Col. David W. Humphries, killed at Gettysburg.\nLt. Col. John A. Blair, captured at Gettysburg.\n\n\n== Organization ==\nCompanies of the 2nd Mississippi Infantry: \n\nCompany A, \"Tishomingo Riflemen\"\nCompany B, \"O'Connor Rifles\" of Tippah County.\nCompany C, \"Town Creek Riflemen\" of Itawamba County.\nCompany D, \"Joe Matthews Rifles\" of Tippah County.\nCompany E, \"Calhoun Rifles\"\nCompany F, \"Magnolia Rifles\" of Tippah County.\nCompany G, \"Pontotoc Minute Men\"\nCompany H, \"Conewah Rifles\" of Pontotoc County.\nCompany I, \"Cherry Creek Rifles\" of Pontotoc County.\nCompany K, \"Iuka Rifles\" of Tishomingo County.\nCompany L, \"Liberty Guards\" of Tippah County.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Mississippi Civil War Confederate units\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The ETR 600 (Elettro Treno Rapido 600) is a class of high-speed trains with tilting technology built by Alstom Ferroviaria, which belong to the fourth generation of the Pendolino family. Due to the active tilting technology, the car bodies can be tilted by up to 8 degrees for higher speeds over curves. The design of the ETR 600 comes from Giorgetto Giugiaro.\n\n\n== History ==\nTrenitalia ordered 28 new trainsets, which were delivered in mid-2008. In December 2008, the design was used for the first time in the regular service between Rome and Bari.\nFrom December 2008, Trenitalia introduced new brand names for categorising trains according to their maximum speed. The second fastest train category - after Frecciarossa (Red Arrow) - is Frecciargento (Silver Arrow), for trains with maximum speeds between 250 and 285 km/h. With this, the trains operate as \"ETR 600 Frecciargento\" and \"ETR 610 Frecciargento\". With the brand names, new color schemes were also introduced, which the FS presented on 13 November 2008.\nThe car bodies developed by Alstom were built by the Alstom plants in Savigliano near Turin, and the electrical equipment in Sesto San Giovanni near Milan.\n\n\n== Technical data ==\nA multiple unit consists of seven coaches. Two sets of wheels at the end and neighbouring middle wagons are driven. A total of 430 seats and two wheelchair spaces are offered. With a carriage length of 26.2 m of the vehicle bodies built with aluminium extruded profiles, the train length of 187.4 m with 2.83 m carriage width results. The maximum axle load (loaded) is 16.5 t, so that the pulling mass of an empty train is 387 t and an occupied (all seats occupied) is 421 t.\nThe units are approved for a speed of 250 km/h, although 280 km/h was reached during test drives. The continuous electrical power is 5500 kW. The tilt system is electro-hydraulic and is controlled by a redundantly constructed HVAC control system. The ETR 600 intended for Italian domestic traffic are designed for dual-system capability for the 3 kV DC voltage and 25 kV AC voltage with a frequency of 50 Hz in the existing network, the ETR 610 additionally for an AC voltage of 15 kV at 16.7 Hz.\n\n\n== See also ==\nEurostar Italia\nChina Railway CRH5\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to ETR 600 at Wikimedia Commons\n\nAlstom brochure on the “New Pendolino”",

He is best remembered today for his New Deal murals commissioned for the post offices in Brady, Texas, Alhambra, California and Ventura, California. \n\n\n== Life and death ==\nBorn in Oakland, Grant was a graduate of Stanford University. He was a nephew of maritime artist Gordon Grant. His brother Campbell Grant worked for Walt Disney. In the 1930s he worked on murals at Wellesley College and at the Bronx city hall. In 1936 he exhibited paintings in Washington, D.C. on \"Indian subjects\" including an image of a Hopi eagle dance.\nHe died in 1940 in a cannon explosion on the Montecito, California estate of George F. Steedman, supposedly accidentally ignited by Grant's lit cigarette. He was working for Steedman as a silversmith. In addition to painting and silversmithing, Gordon was considered an expert on the artwork of Native American tribes of southwestern North America.\nThe Santa Barbara Museum of Art hosted a retrospective exhibit of his work in 2001.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Joy of All Who Sorrow Church is an Orthodox church in Koterka (a parish in Tokary), in the Siemiatycze deanery of the Orthodox Diocese of Warsaw–Bielsko of the Polish Orthodox Church.\nThe Orthodox parish in Tokary was established no later than the 16th century; from the 17th century until 1839, it was a Uniate building. In the mentioned year, it was incorporated into the Russian Orthodox Church under the provisions of the Synod of Polotsk. The church in Koterka was built between 1909 and 1912 as a filial temple of this parish, on the site where a Mary apparition was supposed to have occurred in 1852. It was not recognized by the Russian Orthodox Church, yet pilgrims visited the site, and miraculous healings were said to have occurred. In 1906, Bishop Michał of Grodno approved the construction of a church at this location, which was financed by the believers' donations. In 1948, due to the division of the village of Tokary following the delineation of the Polish-Soviet border, the church became the parish church. Despite the depopulation of the surrounding villages, it remains an important pilgrimage destination.\nThe church is located in a forest, near the settlement of Koterka, in the area of the same name, also called by the faithful the Holy Place.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Orthodox parish in Tokary is first mentioned at the end of the 16th century. In 1592, its church was described as \"ancient\". The parish operated within the structures of the Diocese of Volodymyr–Brest and later Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Volodymyr–Brest (the moment of the parish's transition to the Union is not established). The parish in Tokary was reintegrated into the Orthodox Church following the decisions of the Synod of Polotsk in 1839, along with all the other Uniate outposts in Podlachia. Earlier, in 1816, a new parish church was built in Tokary.\n\n\n=== Events of 1852 and development of the cult ===\nThe construction of the church in Koterka, subordinate to the temple in Tokary, occurred in connection with an apparition of Mary that was said to have taken place on the Feast of the Holy Trinity in 1852. The Virgin Mary was said to have appeared to a local peasant girl named Eufrozyna Iwaszczuk in the Koterka glade, where she was gathering sorrel instead of going to church on the holy day. As Iwaszczuk recounted, Mary announced that the feast had been established for prayer in the temple on that day, not for work. She also foretold that the sins of the villagers would be punished by a pestilential air. She instructed Iwaszczuk to go to the parson and tell him to pray with the parishioners for forgiveness of sins. The parson of Tokary, Symon Budiłowicz, erected a cross in the glade. This place began to attract numerous pilgrims, not only Orthodox, and reports of miraculous healings emerged.\nTo determine whether the events in Koterka were a miracle according to the church, a special commission was appointed in June 1852 by the Russian Orthodox Diocese of Lithuania. In September of the same year, it concluded that no miracle had occurred. The parson of Tokary, who had encouraged pilgrimage to the glade even before the verdict, was removed from his position. The cross placed in Koterka was ordered to be moved to the local Orthodox cemetery. However, pilgrimages did not cease, and healings were still reported. Those coming to Tokary considered the spring that appeared at the site where the cross originally stood as miraculous. Particularly numerous pilgrims arrived in Tokary during the Feast of the Holy Trinity. Due to the negative opinion of the Russian Orthodox Diocese of Lithuania, no services were held at the glade, and requests by parsons to build a chapel there were rejected.\n\n\n=== Construction of the church ===\nIn 1900, the Eparchy of Grodno–Brest was established, within which the parish in Tokary was included. Bishop Michał of Grodno agreed to the development of the sanctuary in Koterka in 1906. On 9 May 1909, the foundation stone was laid for the construction of the temple at the glade.\nThe construction of the church lasted for three years and was financed by donations. Anna Briantseva from Kazan, who claimed to have been healed in Koterka, donated liturgical utensils worth over 1,200 rubles to the temple. The forester from Mielnik, Porecki, donated wood from 264 pine trees for construction. The Administration of Agricultural and State Estates in Grodno allocated the rest of the wood for half of its value (600 rubles). Assistance also came from the parish in Mielnik. On 29 July 1912, the completed church was dedicated by the abbot of the St. Onuphrius Monastery in Jabłeczna, Archimandrite Seraphim, who replaced Bishop Vladimir of Białystok, who was originally invited to the ceremony. The parish chronicle records that a significant group of faithful were present at the dedication. In 1915, Orthodox residents of Tokary fled during World War I, causing the local parish activity to cease.\n\n\n=== Functioning after 1918 ===\nThe prestige of the sanctuary in Koterka grew further during the interwar period, when Metropolitan of Warsaw and All Poland, Dionysius, visited the shrine on the Feast of the Holy Trinity. The parish chronicle from this period recorded additional cases of healings. However, most testimonies of healings were not documented, and knowledge of them exists only in oral tradition. The faithful came to the temple not only on the Feast of the Holy Trinity but also on the patronal feast day.\n\nIn 1948, the church in Koterka became the parish church because, after the establishment of the Polish-Soviet border, the St. Michael the Archangel Church in Tokary fell within the territory of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, where most of the Orthodox residents' houses were also located. In the new political situation, pilgrimages from Belarus became impossible. It was only in 1990 that a solemn procession was organized with the participation of several thousand faithful and 15 priests from the Polish part of Tokary to the Belarusian part. The church continues to be an important pilgrimage center despite the decline in the population of neighboring villages. Metropolitan of Warsaw and All Poland, Sawa, presided over the Feast of the Holy Trinity celebrations in Koterka several times, and bishops Grzegorz of Bielsko (in 1998) and Jerzy of Siemiatycze (in 2007) also visited the temple. The church was entered into the list of heritage registers on 28 December 1984, under No. A-64. In 2012, the centenary of the construction of the church was commemorated by placing a six-meter cross with a painting by Jarosław Wiszenko, funded by foresters from the Nurzec Stacja forestry, next to it. There are also other wooden votive crosses near the temple.\nIn the early 21st century, the temple underwent renovations. After the completion of the works, the church was dedicated on 4 September 2016, by Metropolitan of Warsaw and All Poland, Sawa.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe church is a wooden structure with a log construction, clad in formwork, oriented, and divided into three sections (church porch, nave, chancel), erected on a cross-shaped plan. Covered porches supported by two profiled pillars are located at the main and side entrances. The nave of the church is built on a square plan, the chancel on a rectangular plan with a three-sided apse, and the church porch also on a rectangular plan. The church roofs are metal sheeted; a hip roof covers the nave, while the church porch and porches have gable roofs. The church has one roof lantern with an onion-like tented roof. A tower rises above the church porch, octagonal in plan, crowned with a steep roof and a small dome. Near the church is a spring surrounded by a shelter, which is revered.\nInside the church, there is a double-row iconostasis. In front of it, for worship, stands Golgotha and the patronal icon, while above the iconostasis hangs the icon of the Intercession of the Theotokos. The patronal icon, measuring 106 by 170 cm, is placed in an icon case in front of the iconostasis, to the left. It was painted on cypress wood.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nSosna, Grzegorz (2006). Święte miejsca i cudowne ikony. Prawosławne sanktuaria na Białostocczyźnie (in Polish).

        "content": "All Saint's Church is the parish church of the village of Horsington in Lincolnshire, England. The church was originally built as a thatched church before it was rebuilt in 1860 as a red brick church. The church was built to include a spire and bigger base for the congregation. It was given a Grade II listed building status in September 1966.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe church was originally a thatched church and was occupied by the Horsington Anglican rectory who were living at the church and rectory by it at the time. The rectory and church were a gift given by the Magdalen College in Oxford who owned the land and the church and were also the de facto provider of the villages Lords of the Manor. The church was eventually rebuilt in 1860 with a spire, bigger hall and red brick design. The church remains the parish church of the village and surrounding hamlets. \n\nHistoric England's listing for the building describes it as:\n\n\"Red brick with ashlar dressings, slate roofs with stone coped gables. Nave, south aisle and porch, south eastern tower with steeple, chancel and vestry. The west end of the south aisle has a single lancet, and the west end of the nave has 3 stepped lancets with a trefoil over, this arrangement marred by a later boiler house and chimney. The north side has alternate pairs of lancet and 2 light openings with pierced circle over. The vestry has a 2 light window and a single lancet on the east side. The chancel has a single lancet to north and south sides and in the east wall are 3 stepped lancets with trefoil heads united under a common pointed arch. The south eastern tower is of 2 stages with 2 moulded stone string courses, a corbel table and a broach red brick spire with single lucarnes.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\n[1] at Horsington History",

        "content": "Rosendo Collazo was a former Cuban-born senator, retired army colonel, and veteran of the Cuban War of Independence.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nRosendo Collazao was born around 1875 in the Camagüey Province of Cuba.\nHe joined the Cuban Army in the 1890s and fought during the Cuban War of Independence. On December 8, 1897, he signed a proclamation along with other Cuban military officers and civil leaders in Havana protesting against Spain's sovereignty over Cuba.\nBy 1898, Collazo was in the Cuban Army with the rank of colonel. On Feb 2, 1898, a detachment of Spanish Cavalry engaged with an insurgent force under Collazo, at the Aguayo Plantation in Havana Province. 4 insurgents were captured by the Spaniards who also wounded seven men.\nIn 1906, rebels in Havana were defeated by the government forces commanded by General Alfredo Rego and Rosendo Collazo in the Tapaste Hills. After two hours of firing, the government troops made a machete charge. One of the Cuban officers was killed in the altercation, while Collazo and another corporal were wounded\nIn 1912, a detachment of government troops under the Cuban Army Major defeated 10 insurgents in a battle near El Cobre.\nIn March 1917, Collazo and another colonel commanded the government forces that captured former Cuban President Jose Miguel Gomez at Placetas. By 1917, he was regarded as a tactical expert and a student of military affairs. The Cuban army officers referred to him as the \"hero of Caicaje,\" a title that he earned after capturing Jose Miguel Gomez during the uprising. In August 1917, he toured the United States to learn the workings of the U.S. Army's selective draft by President Mario García Menocal's order. At the commemoration of Cuba's sixteenth anniversary of independence in May 1918, he rode at the head of the troops.\nCollazo became a member of the Cuban Senate and a member of its Foreign Relations Committee.\nIn 1921, Senator Rosendo Collazo led the establishment of Cuba's National Boxing Commission to regulate the sport. Collazo was the first president and chairman of the Cuban Boxing Federation.\nOn August 19, 1922, Collazo, an expert swordsman, and Colonel Orestes Ferrara, a representative for Havana province settled a point of honor with a duel. The duel was initiated due to news stories published in Ferrara's Havana paper, El Heraldo de Cuba, about Collazo's two nephews being killed in a street brawl in Marianao. Collazo sustained a right shoulder wound, while Ferrara's nose was slashed and drew blood before both shook hands. On August 17, a similar dispute occurred with La Liberdad's director, Sergio Carbo, who was wounded by Collazo.\nRosendo Collazo aspired to succeed Gerardo Machado as Cuban president. \nIn October 1930, Collazo departed from Cuba to New York before being implicated in an alleged plot to assassinate fellow senate members that was uncovered by Havana newspaper El Pais Today. He was also accused of fomenting revolution and investigated for organizing a plot to seize arms and munitions at Cabana's fortress for a revolutionary movement. Collazo, who was visiting New York on October 15, expressed his astonishment at the Havana reports that were published. After departing from Cuba to New York, Collazo maintained a headquarters at the Hotel Biltmore.\nOn August 5, 1931, five Cubans and one American were detained by American Department of Justice agents pending an investigation of a tip that they were plotting a revolution in Cuba and attempting to board a gun-running vessel, off of New York Harbor. Collazo and the others being held were questioned by federal agents to determine whether they had broken any laws against revolutionary activity in a friendly country, despite their claim that they were out fishing. Once questioned, they were later freed. 1931 Havana reports said that the retired Army colonel Collazo was leading a group of rebel sympathizers from the U.S. in Santa Clara. Still, Collazo denied the reports at the Associated Press New York office on August 15, 1931. Collazo and two other defendants were later arraigned on November 7, 1931, charged with having \"prepared to furnish money for and to take part in a military expedition to be carried on from the United States against the republic of Cuba, a nation which the United States is at peace\". Collazo was held on a $10,000 bond. In December 1931, a federal grand jury considered charges against a total of eight men who were charged with planning a military expedition against Cuba while they were in the States including Rosendo and his son Aurelio Collazo, as well as Aurelio Alvarez. \nCollazo was detained in Morón, Cuba in September 1933 and charged with conspiracy to rebel. He was subsequently imprisoned at La Cabaña. Collazo took part in an army and civilian uprising against the Ramón Grau Government, in November 1933. After seizing control of Castillo de Atarés as a rebel stronghold, Rosendo Collazo along with Blas Hernandez and Circo Leonard declared they would not surrender until the last man had fallen.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Paralongicollum is a genus in Acanthocephala, the thorny-headed worms, also known as spiny-headed worms.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe genus was described by Amin, Bauer & Sidorov, 1991. The National Center for Biotechnology Information does not indicate that any phylogenetic analysis has been published on any Paralongicollum species that would confirm its position as a unique order in the family Pomphorhynchidae.\n\n\n== Description ==\nParalongicollum species consist of a proboscis covered in hooks and a trunk. \n\n\n== Species ==\nThe genus Paralongicollum contains three species.\n\nParalongicollum edmondsi (Golvan, 1969)\nParalongicollum nemacheili Amin, Bauer & Sidorov, 1991\nParalongicollum sergenti (Choquette & Gayot, 1952)\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nThe distribution of Paralongicollum is determined by that of its hosts.\n\n\n== Hosts ==\n\nThe life cycle of an acanthocephalan consists of three stages beginning when an infective acanthor (development of an egg) is released from the intestines of the definitive host and then ingested by an arthropod, the intermediate host. Although the intermediate hosts of Paralongicollum are arthropods. When the acanthor molts, the second stage called the acanthella begins. This stage involves penetrating the wall of the mesenteron or the intestine of the intermediate host and growing. The final stage is the infective cystacanth which is the larval or juvenile state of an Acanthocephalan, differing from the adult only in size and stage of sexual development. The cystacanths within the intermediate hosts are consumed by the definitive host, usually attaching to the walls of the intestines, and as adults they reproduce sexually in the intestines. The acanthor is passed in the feces of the definitive host and the cycle repeats. There may be paratenic hosts (hosts where parasites infest but do not undergo larval development or sexual reproduction) for Paralongicollum.\nParalongicollum parasitizes animals. There are no reported cases of Paralongicollum infesting humans in the English language medical literature.

        "content": "The Municipal Buildings are in West Street, Boston, a town in Lincolnshire, in England. The complex accommodates the offices and meeting place of Boston Borough Council.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first municipal building in Boston was the guildhall which was completed in 1390. In the early 19th century, the fish market at the centre of the Exchange Buildings in the Market Place was converted for municipal use and subsequently became the offices of Boston Corporation, which was duly reformed in 1836 in accordance with the Municipal Corporations Act 1835. In the late 19th century, civic leaders decided to commission more substantial premises. The site they selected was on the south side of West Street.\nThe new building was designed by James Rowell in the Edwardian Baroque style, built in red brick with terracotta dressings and was officially opened by the mayor, Alderman Joseph Cooke, in 1904. The design involved an asymmetrical main frontage of 10 bays facing onto West Street. The first bay on the left featured a large opening with voussoirs and a keystone which originally led to the main foyer. There were doorways in the third and seventh bays and access for the fire engine in the eighth and ninth bays. The fourth bay contained a semi-circular balcony on the first floor. The whole building was fenestrated by windows of differing style but with banded surrounds. The second, fourth, sixth, eighth and tenth bays were all surmounted by stepped gables. Internally, the principal rooms were the council chamber, with ornate stained glass windows, the offices for the council officers, the offices for the local police service and garaging for the fire engines.\nThe whole complex was dedicated to municipal use after both the fire service and the police service relocated to Lincoln Lane. It continued to serve as the headquarters of the borough council for much of the 20th century and remained the meeting place for the enlarged Boston Borough Council which was formed in 1974. The building also continued to serve as the local registration office with a ceremony room available for weddings and civil partnership ceremonies.\n\n\n== References ==",

It is an aquatic subshrub endemic to north-central Laos.\nHydrodiscus koyamae grows on rocks in seasonally-inundated stream rapids and waterfalls. It roots to rocks with a flattened cylindrical disk, from which many-branched shoots grow out to one meter in length.\nIt is known from only three locations in Phuu Khao Khouay National Park in Bolikhamsai Province of north-central Laos. The type specimen was collected in Tat Luek Nam Tok (Tad Leuk waterfall).\nThe species was first named Diplobryum koyamae in 2002. Its body plan is distinct from other species of Diplobryum, and in 2010 the species was placed in its own genus as Hydrodiscus koyamae.\n\n\n== References ==",

In 2019 Diao moved to the football academy Darou Salam - Académie Foot Darou Salam de Dakar - where during his time at the academy he was also selected for the Senegal U-20 national team.\n\n\n=== Midtjylland and Mafra ===\nIn August 2022, Diao reportedly signed with Danish club FC Midtjylland. However, Midtjylland never officially confirmed this themselves. In January 2023, Portuguese club C.D. Mafra confirmed that Diao had signed with the club. Several sources - although neither Mafra nor Midtjylland confirmed this - wrote that Diao joined Mafra on a loan deal until summer 2024.\nIn the summer of 2023, Diao was back in Midtjylland and also took part in a training match for the club. He then returned to Mafra, where he became a huge profile for the club in the 2023–24 season. His good performances for Mafra made Diao attract a lot of interest, including from Sporting CP, who according to sources were close signing Diao.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOusmane Diao at Soccerway",

        "content": "Kvutzat Alon (Hebrew: קְבוּצַת אַלּוֹן) is an Israeli kibbutz. Located in the Jezreel Valley in northern Israel, it falls under the jurisdiction of the Jezreel Valley Regional Council. As of 2022, it had a population of 781.\n\n\n== History ==\nKvutzat Alon was founded in August 1948 as a kvutza, by a group of Polish Jews from Łódź, who immigrated to Israel, many of whom were Holocaust survivors. Kvutzat Alon was established as part of the Kibbutz movement, which aimed to establish Jewish agricultural communities in a communal way of life, sharing all material goods. Kvutzat Alon is based on the principles of socialism, agriculture, and self-sufficiency.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name \"Alon\" in Hebrew translates to \"oak tree\", symbolizing renewal and continuity. The choice of this name stemmed from the oak tree's tall and strong characteristics, that serve as a source of strength and support for its members, and provides shelter for people around it.\nThe name \"Alon\", in the context of the kibbutz, is also used as a reference to Jews expelled from Gush Etzion by the Jordanian Arab Legion in 1948 following the Kfar Etzion massacre.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe economy of Kvutzat Alon is primarily based on agriculture. The community operates its own businesses, including a dairy farm, a poultry farm, and a greenhouse complex. The kibbutz's fields grow crops such as oranges, grapefruits, avocados, olives, and vegetables like tomatoes, cucumbers, and bell peppers. The kibbutz uses both traditional farming methods and modern agricultural technologies. Some residents work in education and healthcare.\n\n\n== References ==",

Hr mother died of cancer when Hurl was 17. Hurl's father, born in 1894, was a Catholic from a farming background who grew up along the Derry-Antrim border. He worked as a primary school teacher and was politically active, becoming involved in the Ulster Troubles. Hurls parents moved to Charleston Avenue, Ranelagh, Dublin, where they bought their first house. They lived frugally and the family prioritised education.\n\n\n== Career ==\nBefore becoming an artist, Hurl got a job with Williams and Woods, a Dublin confectionery factory, where she worked as a comptometer operator. Hurl attended the National College of Art and Design in 1975 as a mature student and returned to study at the Dún Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Technology, graduating in 1984 with a first class honours Bachelor of Arts in fine art. In 2000, she completed a Master of Arts in interactive multimedia at Institute of Technology, Tallaght. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, she was a committee member of Women Artists Action Group, a feminist group which promoted women artists from Ireland. From 1984 to 2009, Hurl was a lecturer in fine art at Dublin Institute of Technology College of Art and Design.\nHer first solo exhibition, Living Room Myths and Legends, was shown at the Temple Bar Gallery and Studios in 1988. It included works based on the Kerry babies case. Major themes of her work include loss, pain, frustration, and loneliness. Her work has been included in the The Great Book of Ireland.\nIn 2012, Hurl established the Damer House Gallery in Roscrea, County Tipperary. Hurl is a founder member of Na Cailleacha (Irish for witches or hags), a group of older female Irish artists.\nIn 2023, the Irish Museum of Modern Art held a major retrospective exhibition of Hurl's work. Parts of the collection toured Ireland as the Irish Gothic exhibition, including venues such as The Souce and South Tipperary Arts Centre.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nHurl was named one of Irish Tatler's Women of the Year 2023. In 1984, she won the Norah McGuinness Award for painting and in 2023 she won a Pollock Krasner Award.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nHurl married at the age of 20. Her husband, Joe Doherty, worked as a cooper at the Guinness brewery. They lived in Blanchardstown and Deansgrange, raising four children together. The couple separated in 1989 and were later divorced.\nHurl lives in Ballybirt, County Offaly, with her civil partner, Therry Rudin.\n\n\n== References ==",

It was played in a single match between Criciúma, winner of the 2024 Campeonato Catarinense and the to be decided, winner of the 2024 Copa Santa Catarina.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn 13 January 2018, Chapecoense, holder of the previous season's state title, faced in a friendly the winner of the Copa Santa Catarina, CA Tubarão. Later, on 14 September 2018, the FCF made the Recopa Catarinense official in the state calendar along the same lines. At the time, the entity planned to hold the tournament in January, but the 2019 Copa América made it impossible to hold the match in that month. Until the edition in question, Figueirense and Brusque have won two titles, while Avaí, Joinville and Criciúma have all won the tournament once.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Autotune (Rishton) Limited is a British manufacturer of automobiles.\n\n\n== Company history ==\n\nGeorge Anthony Taylor and Carolyn Bridge Taylor founded the company on April 15, 1975, in Rishton, near Blackburn, Lancashire. However, the company states that it has been active since 1969. Initially they worked in the field of restoration. Production of automobiles and kits began in 1983. The brand name is Autotune. A total of around 485 copies have been created so far.\n\n\n== Vehicles ==\n\nThe first Aristocat model is also the most successful model. The vehicle is based on the Jaguar XJ 6. The subframe, axles and the six-cylinder engine are used by this vehicle. The customer can choose between 2800 cm3, 3400 cm3 and 4200 cm3 displacement. There is also a model with a twelve-cylinder engine with a displacement of 5300 cm3. The convertible body is similar to the Jaguar XK 140, but is not a direct replica and is wider than the original. Around 300 copies have been created since 1983.\nThe Aristocat Sports is the coupe version of the Aristocat, but narrower and therefore more similar to the original. Around 60 copies have been sold since 1995.\nThe Gemini is similar to the Mk. 2 model from Falcon Cars or, according to another source, the Courier from Elva Cars. It is a two-seat roadster. The basis was initially the chassis of the second generation Ford Escort. The Ford Sierra chassis has been used since 2002. Both versions have a front engine and rear drive. You can choose between four-cylinder engines from Ford with 1300 cm3 and 1600 cm3 displacement as well as six-cylinder engines and a V8 engine from Rover. Around 80 copies have been created since 1988.\nThe Can-Am is a replica of the McLaren M 1 racing sports car from 1965. The basis is a specially manufactured chassis. Various eight-cylinder engines from Chevrolet and Rover power the vehicles. Around 45 copies have been created since 1992.\nThe Aquilla, a two-seater coupé introduced in 2004, remained a one-off.\n\n\n== Literature ==\nHarald H.

        "content": "Charlotte Leubuscher (born 24 July 1888 in Jena; died 2 June 1961 in London) was a German-British social scientist and economist.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBorn as the daughter of the Privy Medical Councillor Georg Leubuscher, she attended the Gymnasium Bernhardinum in Meiningen, where she was the first girl ever to graduate from high school. She then studied economics, history, philosophy and law in Cambridge, Giessen, Munich and Berlin. In the summer of 1912 Leubuscher  spent 12 weeks in England studying industrial relations in the railway industry in collaboration with Lujo Brentano and this became the basis for her 1913 Berlin doctorate under Heinrich Herkner.\nLeubuscher spent the war years working as a statistician and returned to the University of Berlin in 1919, where she habilitated with the thesis \"Socialism and Socialization in England\". Her habilitation was the third by a woman and the first outside the natural sciences there. In 1923 she received a lectureship in foreign social policy, especially of England and Russia, at the University of Göttingen. Leubuscher returned to Britain several times for research study.  In 1924 she moved to the University of Berlin, where she was appointed associate professor in 1929.\nLeubuscher was half-Jewish and in 1933 her teaching license was revoked by the Nazi government. She emigrated to England and taught at various universities, including Cambridge, Manchester and the London School of Economics. From 1933 to 1936 Leubuscher received research scholarships from Girton College, Cambridge. Leubuscher began to focus om colonial economics and was one of the first economists to focus on development economics. Her archive is located in the Staatsarchiv Meiningen.\nCharlotte Leubuscher died in 1961 at the age of almost 73 years in London. She was buried in the Cemetery II of the Jerusalem and New Church in Berlin-Kreuzberg, where her grandfather Rudolf Leubuscher (1821–1861) had also found his final resting place a century earlier. Both graves have been preserved.\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\nSozialismus und Sozialisierung in England (1921).\nZiele und Mittel der Handelspolitik in den britischen Dominions [Aims and Means of Trade Policy in the British Dominions] (1926)\nLiberalismus und Protektionismus in der englischen Wirtschaftspolitik seit dem Kriege (1927 [Liberalism and Protectionism in English Economic Policy since the War] (1927)\n\n\n== References ==\nRobert Volz: Reichshandbuch der deutschen Gesellschaft.

        "content": "The Luoyang Electronic Equipment Test Center (洛阳电子装备试验中心), also known as the 33rd Test and Training Base of the People's Liberation Army (中国人民解放军第三十三试验训练基地) (MUCD: Unit 63880 Unit) is a research and development center of the People's Liberation Army located in Luoyang, Henan) Province and is affiliated to the PLA's Aerospace Force. It is a Division Grade unit that mainly performs scientific research and defense technology development, including during the last few decades, projects related to the Chinese space program.\n\n\n=== History ===\nOn June 2, 1987, the Central Military Commission broke off and renamed the Third Test Site of the Conventional Weapons Test Base into the Third Test Base of Conventional Weapons and placed under the direct leadership of the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense. Zhou Liezhang was appointed commander, and Li Jiangeng was appointed political commissar. From the start, the base received an extremely high degree of secrecy at the time, due to it work on electronic warfare.\nIn 2005, the base undertook the army's first pilot program for the training of actual electronic countermeasures combat units. In 2009, the base's electronic countermeasures training brigade (电子对抗训练大队) was formally established.\nOn December 5, 2012, the State Key Laboratory of Complex Electromagnetic Environmental Effects on Electronic Information Systems was unveiled at the Luoyang Test Center. The construction of this national key laboratory was approved by the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China on October 9, 2012.\nThe Test Center has been involved in the Chinese Space Program since at least 1999. In particular, the Test Center's Surveying, Mapping and Navigation Team has had the responsibility for the more delicate metrological tasks, in particular the high-precision surveying and mapping support for the \"Shenzhou\" spacecraft program. The Team has carried out over 700 surveying and mapping support tasks, from the initial geodetic survey of possible landing sites in Inner Mongolia, to surveying and mapping support for \"Shenzhou 5\" and Shenzhou 6\" and telemetry work for \"Shenzhou 7\".\nThe team also undertook the hyper-precise elevation measurements for the early stages of construction of the 500-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST) project in 2012.\nThe test's center parent department, the General Armament Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, was abolished in January 2016, and the base was transferred to the newly established Equipment Development Department of the Central Military Commission. It was then transferred to the newly founded Strategic Support Force, and on the dissolution of that force in April 2024, it passed under the jurisdiction of the Aerospace Force.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nCentral Military Commission (China)\nNational Defense Mobilization Commission",

        "content": "A demonstration kitchen, also known as a show kitchen or teaching kitchen, is a culinary space designed for cooking demonstrations, classes, and other food-related events. These kitchens are often equipped with professional-grade appliances, ample counter space, and audiovisual technology to enhance participant's learning experience.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe concept of demonstration kitchens can be traced back to the early 20th century, with the rise of home economics education and the growing popularity of cooking shows on radio and television. Early demonstration kitchens were often found in department stores, cooking schools, and community centers, where they served as a platform for promoting new products and educating the public about cooking techniques.\nIn recent years, demonstration kitchens have experienced a resurgence in popularity, driven by the growing interest in food and cooking and the increasing demand for experiential learning opportunities. Today, demonstration kitchens can be found in various settings, including culinary schools, restaurants, retail stores, and even private homes.\n\n\n== Uses ==\n\nDemonstration kitchens are versatile spaces, serving a multitude of purposes. They are ideal for hosting cooking classes and workshops, where participants can learn anything from basic cooking skills to specialized techniques like baking, pastry-making, or international cuisine. Manufacturers and retailers often utilize demonstration kitchens to showcase new products, offering samples to potential customers and generating excitement around their brands. These kitchens also provide a unique setting for corporate events and team-building activities, fostering employee camaraderie through cooking classes and competitions. Additionally, demonstration kitchens can be rented out for private events like birthdays, anniversaries, and corporate gatherings, adding culinary twists to celebrations.\n\n\n== Benefits ==\nThe benefits of demonstration kitchens extend to both participants and hosts. Participants enjoy a hands-on learning experience, observing cooking techniques up close and often getting the chance to participate in food preparation. The interactive nature of these kitchens increases engagement, making learning about food and cooking more enjoyable and memorable. For businesses, hosting events in a demonstration kitchen can significantly enhance brand awareness and cultivate customer loyalty. Additionally, these kitchens can generate revenue through cooking classes, product demonstrations, and private events.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Pasture PDX, or simply Pasture, is a butcher shop and delicatessen in Portland, Oregon's Alberta Arts District. Kei Ohdera and HJ Schaible are co-owners. Pasture has garnered a positive reception and was named one of Portland's best new restaurants of 2022 by The Oregonian.\n\n\n== Description ==\nPasture operates on Alberta Street in northeast Portland's King neighborhood. It has been described as a whole animal butchery and restaurant. The menu varies depending on the season and weather, and has included roast beef sandwiches with cheddar, pastrami Reubens with carrot thousand island, and beef mortadella with pickled peppers. The shop has sold curated boxes of goods. Foods are sourced from Oregon farmers and ranchers.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe business is owned by Kei Ohdera and HJ Schaible. It initially operated as a pop-up restaurant, including stints at Dame Collective in 2019 and the now-defunct Tails & Trotters in 2021. Plans for Pasture to start operating from a brick and mortar location were announced in 2021.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nPasture ranked seventh in The Oregonian's list of Portland's best new restaurants of 2022. The newspaper's Michael Russell said the business was the city's best new sandwich shop. Alex Frane and Janey Wong included Pasture in Eater Portland's 2023 list of nineteen \"excellent\" sandwich shops in the city.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of butcher shops\nList of delicatessens\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

He started producing automobiles and kits in 1983. The brand name is ASD. In total, more than 15 copies have been created so far. The company was also involved in Tripos R&D and CK Automotive, which also manufactured automobiles.\n\n\n== Vehicles ==\nThe Minim was a mid-engine roadster. The basis was a steel chassis. A four-cylinder engine from the Mini powered the vehicle. Around six copies were made between 1984 and 1996.\nThe Hobo was released in 1987. It was similar to a Mini Moke and was also based on the Mini. Four copies were made by 1991.\nFive replicas of the Aston Martin DBR1 based on the Jaguar XJ 6 and an unknown number of replicas of the Aston Martin DBR 2 were created, which were called Le Mans. ARA Racing from 2005 to 2006 and AS Motorsport since 2007 continued production under the ARA brand name.\nThe 250 corresponded to the Maserati 250 F. A four-cylinder engine from the Alfa Romeo Alfetta with a displacement of 2000 cm3 powered the vehicle.\nThere are also replicas of models from Ferrari and Mercedes-Benz.\n\n\n== Literature ==\nHarald H.

        "content": "FinCEN Form 114, also known as the Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR) is an informational report that needs to be filed annually by United States persons (including citizens and residents for tax purposes) who exceed a threshold amount ($10,000) for the aggregate of their maximum account values in foreign financial institutions in the calendar year. The form is filed electronically with the BSA e-filing system of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) (the Financial Intelligence Unit of the United States). The requirement to file this form arises from the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970. The form replaces a previous United States Department of the Treasury form called TD-F 90–22.1, also known as FBAR.\n\n\n== Legal basis ==\nThe Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (PL 91-508) created an overall framework of requirements for individuals and financial institutions around recordkeeping as well as reporting on some of their financial accounts and transactions. §241 (\"Records and  reports required\") under Chapter 4 (\"Foreign Transactions\") under Title II (\"Report of Currency and Foreign Transactions\") of the Act provides the authority for the FBAR. Part (a) says:\n\nThe Secretary of the Treasury, having due regard for the need to avoid impeding or controlling the export or import of currency or other monetary instruments and having due regard also for the need to avoid burdening unreasonably persons who legitimately engage in transactions with foreign financial agencies, shall by regulation require any resident or citizen of the United States, or person in the United States and doing business therein, who engages in any transaction or maintains any relationship, directly or indirectly, on behalf of himself or another, with a foreign financial agency to maintain records or to file reports, or both, setting forth such of the following in-formation, in such form and in such detail, as the Secretary may require:\n(1) The identities and addresses of the parties to the transaction or relationship.\n(2) The legal capacities in which the parties to the transaction or relationship are acting, and the identities of the real parties in interest if one or more of the parties are not acting solely as principals.\n\n(3) A description of the transaction or relationship including the amounts of money, credit, or other property involved.\nThis was modified by PL 97-258 of 1982. The modified version is in the United States Code in 31 U.S.C. § 5314. Part (a) says:\n\nConsidering the need to avoid impeding or controlling the export or import of monetary instruments and the need to avoid burdening unreasonably a person making a transaction with a foreign financial agency, the Secretary of the Treasury shall require a resident or citizen of the United States or a person in, and doing business in, the United States, to keep records, file reports, or keep records and file reports, when the resident, citizen, or person makes a transaction or maintains a relation for any person with a foreign financial agency. The records and reports shall contain the following information in the way and to the extent the Secretary prescribes:\n(1) The identity and address of participants in a transaction or relationship.\n(2) The legal capacity in which a participant is acting.\n(3) The identity of real parties in interest.\n\n(4) A description of the transaction.\nThe associated regulatory guideline to require FBARs is found in the Code of Federal Regulations in 31 CFR § 1010.350 - Reports of foreign financial accounts. Part (a) says:\n\nIn general. Each United States person having a financial interest in, or signature or other authority over, a bank, securities, or other financial account in a foreign country shall report such relationship to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue for each year in which such relationship exists and shall provide such information as shall be specified in a reporting form prescribed under 31 U.S.C. § 5314 to be filed by such persons. The form prescribed under section 5314 is the Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (TD–F 90–22.1), or any successor form. See paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section for a special rule for persons with a financial interest in 25 or more accounts, or signature or other authority over 25 or more accounts.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (PL 91-508) ===\nThe authority that led the government to impose the requirement to file FBARs comes from the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (PL 91-508), specifically §241 (\"Records and  reports required\") under Chapter 4 (\"Foreign Transactions\") under Title II (\"Report of Currency and Foreign Transactions\"). This is now in the United States Code in 31 U.S.C. § 5314.\n\n\n=== Amendment in 1982 (PL 97-258) ===\nPL 97-258 modified 31 U.S.C. § 5314 slightly.\n\n\n=== Era as TD-F 90-22.1 ===\nThe FBAR form (TD-F 90–22.1) was referenced in a 1995 practical manual for state prosecutors on money laundering.\nIn February 2011, the Internal Revenue Service introduced its Offshore Voluntary Disclosure Initiative (OVDI) to encourage taxpayers to become compliant with their foreign financial account reporting and tax obligations; in particular, this initiative included requiring the taxpayer who were required to file FBAR forms and had not filed to \"come clean\" and disclose their foreign financial accounts, with a one-time penalty of 25% of the maximum amount in their foreign financial account from 2003 to 2010.\nAs part of the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act of 2010 (PL 111-147), Section 6038D of the Internal Revenue Code was amended to pave the way for a new Form 8938 that is similar to the FBAR; whereas the FBAR only asks for a report of the amounts in foreign financial accounts, Form 8938 requires reporting on both the amounts and the income earned in those accounts (such as interest income).\n\n\n=== Era as FinCEN Form 114 ===\nStarting with the reporting for calendar year 2013, the FBAR moved from being a paper-filed Department of Treasury form (TD-F 90–22.1) to an electronically filed Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) form (FinCEN Form 114) that uses the BSA e-filing system. The Department of the Treasury stopped accepting paper forms TD-F 90–22.1 starting July 1, 2013.\nDating to the era of the paper form TD-F 90–22.1 and continuing into the era of the electronic FinCEN Form 114, each section of the FBAR has a clause whereby if there are more than 25 reportable accounts in the section, the filer must simply check the box indicating this and does not need to fill in details of the accounts in that section, but must keep records that must be produced if requested by the government.\nIn 2016, FinCEN submitted a notice of proposed rulemaking that would remove the special rule for filers with more than 25 reportable accounts, so that all filers would have to report all their reportable accounts. The notice of proposed rulemaking also proposed amending the filing deadline from June 30 to April 15, with extensions available to October 15, matching the deadline for submitting tax returns. The proposal (specifically, the part about requiring reporting for all accounts even when more than 25) received pushback from the Investment Company Institute, that argued that this would impose a huge burden and flood FinCEN with a bunch of useless information. Similarly, a consortium of trade associations submitted a letter seeking that the special rule for filers for more than 25 accounts not be removed, with a suggested compromise of increasing the limit from 25 to 100, and also asking for an automatic deadline extension from April 15. As a result of this and other feedback, FinCEN ultimately withdrew its proposed regulation, so the special rule for more than 25 reportable accounts continues to exist. However, the filing deadline has been changed to match up with the deadline for filing taxes (April 15), with automatic extension to October 15 if the deadline is missed (making the extension automatic without the need to file for an extension was one of the suggestions from the consortium of trade associations). The fact that filers with more than 25 reportable accounts in a section didn't need to include details of any of the accounts was brought up in the arguments in Bittner v. United States to help establish that the FBAR violation penalty of $10,000 (with inflation adjustment) should be applied on a per-report rather than a per-account basis.\nIn 2020, in FinCEN Notice 2020–2, FinCEN clarified that cryptocurrency holdings in accounts, whether held in US financial institutions or foreign financial institutions, are not required to be reported; however, foreign financial accounts that hold cryptocurrency may need to be reported based on the other reportable assets in those accounts. The notice also said that FinCEN planned to amend the regulations to include virtual currency.\n\n\n== Nuances ==\n\n\n=== Maximum account value calculation: currency conversion using last day of year and rounding-up convention ===\nThe FBAR asks for the maximum account value over the period (calendar year) for each account. This amount should first be calculated in the currency in which the account is held, using means such as periodic account statements. The amount then needs to be converted to US dollars using the official exchange rate (the Treasury Reporting Rates of Exchange) as of the last day of the calendar year. The value in US dollars is what needs to be entered into the FBAR. Whereas the old FBAR (TD-F 90–22.1) allowed for entries in cents, the new FBAR (FinCEN Form 114) only allows whole dollar amounts. The rounding convention to be used is to round up any partial amounts to the next whole dollar; for instance, $15,265.25 is to be recorded as $15,266.\n\n\n=== $10,000 threshold uses aggregate of maximum account values rather than maximum aggregate account value ===\nThe filing threshold for FBAR is $10,000 for the aggregate of the maximum account values for foreign financial accounts where the person has a financial interest or signatory authority. In particular, this means that even if no individual account crossed the $10,000 threshold, a person may have to file if the aggregate across the accounts exceeds $10,000. For instance, a person with \"foreign financial accounts A, B and C with account balances of $3,000, $1,000 and $8,000, respectively\" must file FBAR.\nThe fact that this uses the \"aggregate of maximum account values\" rather than the \"maximum aggregate account value\" means that a person may have to file even if the person never had an aggregate account value exceeding $10,000. For instance, consider a person who holds $8,000 across two accounts A and B throughout the year. Initially, the money is split as $6,000 in account A and $2,000 in account B. In the middle of the year, the person moves $4,000 from account A to account B, resulting in $2,000 in account A and $6,000 in account B. The aggregate account value across the two accounts is $8,000 throughout the year, but the maximum account values are $6,000 and $6,000 respectively, so that the aggregate of maximum account values is $12,000, and therefore over the filing threshold of $10,000, so the person must file the FBAR.\n\n\n== Taxpayer awareness and education efforts ==\nA major challenge with the FBAR is that many individuals who are required to file the FBAR are unaware of the filing requirement; the threshold of $10,000 is low enough that filers without much financial sophistication may end up crossing that threshold. In particular, Americans living in other countries may be using foreign bank accounts as their primary bank accounts, in which case they may cross the $10,000 threshold easily; similarly, people from other countries currently residing in the United States may have bank accounts in their home countries from before that have over $10,000.\n\n\n=== Form 1040 Schedule B question ===\nAt the bottom of IRS Form 1040 Schedule B, that is part of the income tax return, there are a few questions intended to highlight to the filer to look into whether to file the FBAR; this has been present since at least 2009 and possibly even earlier.\n\n\n=== Tax prep software ===\nMany taxpayers use tax prep software to fill their tax forms rather than directly filling in the forms. Leading tax prep software ask taxpayers questions about whether they own foreign financial accounts, and the balances in those accounts, and then direct the taxpayer to file a FBAR if the total maximum account value exceeds $10,000.\n\n\n== Filing deadline, penalties and legal challenges ==\n\n\n=== Filing deadline ===\nThe filing deadline for the FBAR for a calendar year is April 15 of the next year (the same as the filing deadline for federal income taxes) with extension to October 15 granted automatically if the filing deadline is missed, with no need to request an extension. A FBAR filed after October 15 is considered a \"delinquent FBAR\" and may be subject to civil or criminal penalties as described below.\n\n\n=== Penalty assessment is done by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) (though FBAR penalties are not part of taxes) ===\nAlthough the FBAR (unlike the somewhat-overlapping Form 8938) is not filed with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and in particular is not part of a tax return, the IRS is the agency that assesses penalties for violations of the FBAR filing requirements (such as failure to file the FBAR or errors/omissions in the FBAR). The court ruling in Mendu v. United States states that even though this is a penalty collected by the IRS, it cannot be treated as unpaid taxes, and in particular, is not subject to the special rules that apply to tax payments.\n\n\n=== Civil penalties for non-willful violations (none in case of reasonable cause, $10,000 inflation-adjusted per report otherwise) ===\nAccording to the United States Code 31 U.S.C. § 5321(a)(5)(B)(i), the maximum civil penalty for a non-willful FBAR violation is $10,000 (as last amended by statute) with inflation adjustment; however, there is a reasonable cause exception that exempts violations with a reasonable cause or where the error was not material (i.e., the amounts reported were correct). Separately, taxpayers may be able to avail of a reduced penalty amount through streamlined filing as described in a later section.\nThe penalty amount is specified in the table in the Code of Federal Regulations 31 CFR § 1010.821, with the inflation-adjusted amount as of 2024 being $16,117.\nIn Bittner v. United States (decided February 28, 2023) the United States Supreme Court ruled that this limit applied per report, rather than per account; since one report needs to be filed per year, this implies a maximum penalty of $10,000 (with inflation adjustment) for every year that the taxpayer had a non-willful FBAR violation (either a failure to file or a material error, such as missing some accounts or reporting incorrect amounts within the accounts).\n\n\n=== Civil penalties for willful violations (maximum being the larger of $100,000 inflation-adjusted and 50% of the affected amount) ===\nAccording to the United States Code 31 U.S.C. § 5321(a)(5), the maximum civil penalty for a willful FBAR violation is the greater of $100,000 and 50% of the amount in the account, adjusted for inflation. As of 2024, the inflation-adjusted amount is $161,166 as specified in the table in the Code of Federal Regulations 31 CFR § 1010.821, also referenced in IRS Publication 5569.\nTaxpayer advocates have argued that the maximum penalties for willful violations are excessive, and that they should be reduced. Further, there has been criticism of the method the IRS uses to determine if a violation is willful; for instance, a failure to file FBAR could be considered willful even if the taxpayer was not aware of the filing requirement; in particular, the fact that the taxpayer included Form 1040 Schedule B in the tax return, that has a question pointing in the direction of the FBAR, may be considered sufficient to establish willfulness. The standard used for establishing willfulness for civil penalties is the preponderance of the evidence standard, rather than a more demanding \"clear and convincing evidence\" standard or the even more demanding \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" standard.\n\n\n=== Criminal penalties ===\nCriminal penalties may be assessed in some cases for willful FBAR violations, over and above the civil penalties. According to the Code of Federal Regulations 31 CFR § 1010.840, also referenced in IRS Publication 5569, the maximum criminal penalty is as follows:\n\nKnowingly and wiillfully filing false FBAR: Up to $10,000 or 5 years or both.\nFailure to file FBAR or retain required records: Up to $250,000 or 5 years or both.\nThe standard of evidence for criminal penalties is beyond a reasonable doubt, unlike the \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard necessary to assess civil penalties.\n\n\n=== Streamlined filing ===\nThe IRS offers a set of procedures called the Streamlined Filing Compliance Procedures that allow taxpayers with non-willful failure to file FBAR to voluntarily catch up on delinquent FBARs from past years. The procedures also cover failure to file Form 8938 as well as failure to pay taxes on the income reported on Form 8938. Taxpayers need to pay all past due taxes and penalties and should not have an ongoing civil examination against them, but do not need to pay FBAR violation penalties for the years being disclosed if their streamlined filing is accepted. The filing process is a little different based on whether the taxpayer is inside or outside the United States:\n\nTaxpayers inside the United States need to file Form 14654 and pay a miscellaneous offshore penalty of 5% of the maximum account value over the years where the taxpayer failed to file the FBAR or Form 8938 (with a maximum lookback of 3 years for FBAR and 6 years for Form 8938) in addition to any taxes due. This amount replaces the penalty of $10,000 (with inflation adjustment) that the taxpayer would otherwise have to pay for each year with a FBAR violation.\nTaxpayers outside the United States (need to file Form 14653. There is no offshore penalty for these users.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The St. Mary's Church (Polish: Kościół Mariacki, German: St. Marienkirche), or formally, Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Gryfice, is a parish church, one of the religious buildings in the city, built from the turn of the 13th and 14th centuries to the end of the 15th century.\nIt is a Gothic sacred building with a polygonal plan and rib and lierne vaults, which was rebuilt (from 1659 to 1668), expanded, and renovated (17th and 19th centuries) over the centuries. Apart from the chancel, the nave, and the tower, it had two additional chapels dedicated to the Virgin Mary (now: sacristy) and St. Mary. The church was dedicated in 1498. The sacred object covers an area of 1,108 m2 and a volume of 15,905 m3 (according to other sources: 1,115 m2 and 38,660 m3). On the external elevations, there are metope friezes, mascarons, buttresses adorned with a cross and lily, as well as traceries, which are rare in the architectural decoration of sacred buildings in Western Pomerania. The church has historical furnishings, including a Romanesque baptismal font from the 13th century, a late Gothic triptych from the end of the 15th century, a Baroque main altar, and eighteenth-century pulpit, pipe organs, choir stalls, numerous tombstones, and epitaphs.\n\n\n== Location ==\n\nThe parish church is located in the central part of the Old Town, south of Victory Square and separated by the southern row. Its roof faces Kościelna Street. It is situated in the so-called market block from its southern side, at the corner of Niepodległości Street, Kościelna Street, and Wojska Polskiego Street.\nThe main portal of the church is located on Niepodległości Street, in the western facade of the church tower. Side entrances are located on the southern wall of the nave.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe construction of the St. Mary's Church in Gryfice dates back to the turn of the 13th and 14th centuries. The exact start date of the construction of the parish church is not known. Under the date of 1297, there is a written mention of the parson Ludevinus, indicating that the construction of the building was advanced and partially fulfilling its function. The cornerstone was probably laid a few years later, although there are indications that the current church was built on the site of the former wooden one. This is associated with the granting of city rights in 1262 and the construction of the town on the left bank of the Rega river.\nInitially, the eastern part of the church was built (now the chancel), along with the St. Mary's Chapel, which served as a church treasury until 1534 (now the sacristy). Part of this construction was completed in the early 14th century. The nave, the central part of the current church, was built according to different architectural concepts between 1300 and 1350. Various span walls were used in the construction, with the southern one wider than the northern one. Different profiled jambs were also used. Some scholars suggest that the nave was the first part of the building to be constructed. They base this on a continuous frieze (called metope) with a floral or vine motif, which is the only one of its kind on the church. The rest of the building is filled with friezes with \"blind\" tracery.\nSeveral decades later, the church tower was built, probably in the early 15th century. Originally, it was built on a granite foundation, with the upper parts made of brick and the top made of wood. It had a gable roof with a slender pointed spire. The current appearance of the tower's facade and its crowning is the result of later reconstructions after fires in 1496, 1562, 1568, and 1658. The final stage of expansion was the construction of the St. Mary's Chapel (German: Kapelle der Maria), located on the northern facade of the nave. Its completion in 1498 marked the end of the temple's construction. In the same year, the church was dedicated by Bishop Martin von Karith.\nUntil 13 December 1534, the church belonged to the Latin Church, and then, as a result of the Reformation, it was taken over by the Lutheran Church. This led to significant neglect of the building, managed by the deacons of that time. Restoration work began in the early 17th century when the library was arranged anew, the organs were repaired, and the tower's crowning was renovated.\nOn 31 March 1658, a fire destroyed the southern, western, and central parts of the city, including the church, from which only partially load-bearing walls and pillars remained. St. Mary's Chapel survived the fire. Between 1659 and 1668, the reconstruction of the church took place. Load-bearing walls were rebuilt, and the upper parts of the charred pillars were restored. In 1663, the reconstruction of the church tower, which had collapsed, began. A year later, three new cast bells were consecrated and hung, along with an additional one, which was moved from the Stone Gate. In 1667, the interior of the church was restored. The internal elevation was whitewashed, benches in the naves were replaced, a new pulpit and choir stalls were built in the chancel. The church was rebuilt thanks to the foundation of Elector Frederick William and the involvement of the city's residents and the surrounding area.\n\nThe main altar was made around 1700. It likely references an earlier altar by Rudolf Stockmann, which was destroyed in a fire. The three-story, three-axis altar measures 12.00 × 4.80 × 0.70 m and is entirely dedicated to the \"Passion of Christ\". In 1732, new 40-voice organs were installed, made by S. D. Richter, an organ builder from Kołobrzeg. In the second half of the 18th century, a pulpit was built, which is no longer in use today. In the 19th century, major repairs and renovations were carried out, including changes to the tower's crown in 1859. This involved removing the deteriorating Baroque spire with its lantern and installing a new copper one. In 1870, restoration work and reconstruction of damaged architectural elements were carried out. The intention of the architect Konrad Kruhl from Szczecin was to recreate the appearance of the church and incorporate new Neo-Gothic elements, such as new gables for the chancel, St. Mary's Chapel, and the sacristy. Further restoration work was carried out between 1909 and 1910 under the direction of W. Rossow, which included changes to the shape of the vault. Its construction was based on a rib vault. Rib vault supports were also reconstructed on pillars, and new bands were installed on capitals. The interior of the church was covered with new plaster, and the vault keystones were decorated with polychromy. At the same time, movable artifacts, such as the organs with the organ folder, galleries, benches, and paintings, were renovated.\nIn the 1970s, thermal modernization work was carried out (heating system). The last years of the late 20th and early 21st centuries also saw conservation and renovation projects, including the replacement of the roof covering and the improvement of the aesthetic appearance of the church tower. In 1948, three bells were hung and consecrated: St. Adalbert's (1,100 kg), St. Stanislaus' (700 kg), and St. Casimir's (60 kg). In 1957, the main altar underwent conservation. In 1984, a new clergy house was put into use, built at 17 3-Maja Street. In 1990, a cathedral altar was built according to Roman Falarczyk's design. In 2003, the fencing of the churchyard was changed. On 18 May 2005, a monument to Pope John Paul II was unveiled on the southern facade of the church tower. The 180-centimeter bronze sculpture was placed on a granite boulder according to the design by Alina Sołdyga-Solska.\nThe church was richly equipped with characteristic elements of medieval churches. From historical sources, it is known that there were 15 altars (including 14 side altars), benches, many valuable items, including richly decorated vessels and liturgical books, several bells, and a church library. Among the most famous church artifacts was an alabaster-marble altar made by Antwerp master Rudolf Stockmann and an early medieval granite baptismal font, which is now located in the church porch. The church is adorned with numerous 18th-century epitaphs (there are over 40 of them), frescoes of biblical figures, and votive offerings (polychrome). Epitaphs are located in the church porch, part of the nave, the chancel, and St. Mary's Chapel. The church was enriched with a valuable 15th-century triptych measuring 1.53 × 1.12 m, which was transferred in the 1960s from the Church of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Górzyca. It now forms an altar in the side nave to the south.\nAccording to preserved sources, 31 vicarages and 7 brotherhoods, which operated at St. Mary's Church, have been confirmed to this day.\nFrom 1945 to 1977, the church was under the parish of the Sacred Heart of Jesus in Gryfice, which was run by the Society of Christ. On 10 August 1977, the parish of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Gryfice at St. Mary's Church was erected. From 1945 to 1961, the church was included in the structures of the Nowogard deanery of the apostolic administration, and from 1961, it belonged to the newly created Gryfice deanery, which was incorporated into the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Szczecin-Kamień on 28 June 1972. The church was entered into the register of monuments of national heritage.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Technical data ===\nSource:\n\n\n=== General description ===\nThe church (a hall church type) was built in the Gothic style. It was constructed on a polygonal plan measuring 61.95 × 25.75 m. It consists of three main parts: the tower, a three-aisled hall, and the chancel. Additionally, there are the sacristy and the St. Mary's Chapel. The construction materials used for the building include granite, brick, wood, and roof tiles.\nThe chancel, with three spans, was built on a rectangular plan measuring 19.2 × 10.78 m. The sacristy is located next to it (on the southern side). The nave, also on a rectangular plan, forms a spacious three-aisled and four-span hall with a tied system and dimensions of 27.25 × 23.67 m. On the northern side of the nave, the St. Mary's Chapel was added. The four-story tower (compact bell tower) situated on a rectangular field (16.27 × 14.65 m) consists of five sections separated by cornices. It was added to the nave with the eastern wall. Its height is 51.5 m. The church tower, which features Renaissance and Baroque elements, is located on the western side of the building. A characteristic feature of the church is the predominance of vertical lines over horizontal ones.\nAccording to K. Szczygieł, the building reached its final shape with a surface area of 1,108 m2 and a volume of 15,905 m3. In the publication by A. Dobosiewicz Gryfice na przestrzeni wieków – Gryfice na starej fotografii (English: Gryfice throughout the ages – Gryfice in old photographs), the surface area and volume data are different. The author provided a surface area of 1,115 m2 and a volume of 38,660 m3. Zenon Wyrwiński, in the publication Kościół pw. Wniebowzięcia Najświętszej Marii Panny w Gryficach (English: The Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Gryfice), provides different data regarding the surface area of the church. According to him, the building has an area of 1,581 m2. The difference in surface areas in the first two cases is small, amounting to 7 m2. Between the first and third: 472 m2, and between the second and third: 465 m2. Volume data also differ. The difference in the first two cases is 22,755 m3. The discrepancies in the data likely arise from measurement, calculation errors, or the reporting of net surface area and volume.\n\n\n=== Chancel ===\n\nThe chancel is oriented with its apex towards Wojska Polskiego Street and its ridge towards Kościelna Street. The eastern part of the church is covered with a gable roof with small dormers. These are square, two-winged, and covered with a tented roof.\nThe eastern facade features a single pointed arch window with two slopes and three jambs, separated by five bars and filled with a stained glass depicting the image of the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove. The upper part of the window is filled with a characteristic tracery (rosette type), typical of architectural decoration in the region. The lower part features a sill above the pulpit cornice. The facade is flanked by two corner five-meter-high buttresses. At the lower part, they contain decorative elements with lower pointed-arch niches (right niche), with one slope and two voussoirs, and a rounded slope (left niche), which also has a blind archivolt. Above the right niche, there is a three-sided bay window, finished at the bottom with a string course. Above, there are friezes with a single slope, surmounted by triangular wimpergs with blind tracery and symbols. The Lily refers to Virgin Mary, and the cross to the Catholic religion. Such decoration of the buttresses is unique in Pomerania.\nThe gable, resembling a pediment, is separated from the lower part by a string course, with a continuous frieze of blind tracery (white plastered). The fragment between the string course and the frieze (called mutule) is filled with horizontal rustic profiles, consisting of alternating profiles with a cross-section of a chamfer arranged alternately with different bricks. In the upper part, there are numerous blind windows. The first, lower row consists of seven uniform blind windows separated by a bar with blind tracery and two to three slopes. The second row, located above the string course with a different plastered frieze and blind tracery, contains five blind windows with two to three slopes, two pairs of which are symmetrically arranged relative to the largest central one. The blind windows are plastered white. The wall corners are decorated with pinnacles with tented roofs, and the top of the gable with a ridge ornament – a crocket (cross motif), which refers to the wimpergs.\nThe north wall of the chancel is pierced with three full windows separated by two bars with two slopes and two buttresses (left window) and one bar with a slope (central and right window). These windows are the only ones in the building with 19th-century stained glass. Above the windows is a cornice, and at the bottom, there is a continuous frieze with blind tracery. The space is filled with a mutule with the same profile as in the previous part of the facade. The windows have pulpit-like sills. The wall is reinforced with three buttresses. Between the second and third buttress, just below the third window, there is a blocked-up pointed-arch portal with three slopes and an irregular double jamb with a blind archivolt, decorated with ornaments in the shape of trefoils, pears, and hollows. It was probably once the main entrance from what is now Wojska Polskiego Street before additional parts of the church were added. The portal is surrounded by a masonry ashlar with two entrances with one slope and a segmental arch. On the south wall, besides the added sacristy, there is one full pointed-arch window, similar in appearance to those on the north side.\nThe interior of the chancel with a rib vault is filled with the main Baroque altar measuring 12.00 × 4.80 × 0.70 m, three Neo-Baroque choir stalls, a pulpit, 18th-century epitaphs, and candelabra. There is also an unused wall-mounted, basket-shaped pulpit supported by an angel (Baroque) measuring 6.00 × 1.75 m. The chancel is directly connected to the sacristy through a pointed-arch portal with four slopes and to the nave through the arcade chancel arch.\n\n\n=== Sacristy ===\n\nTo the southern part of the chancel wall and the eastern part of the nave, a single-span southern chapel (German: Süd-Kapelle, today: sacristy) with a double-pitched roof was added, with the ridge facing Wojska Polskiego Street. It was built on a rectangular plan.\nIn the facade wall, there are two large-span arched windows with a small impost, featuring one slope, four bars, and filled with stained glass. Above them are niches with a similar shape, featuring a single jamb and vertical, narrow openings with a lower pulpit-like sill. The wall is reinforced with corner buttresses. A narrow buttress separates a pair of windows and niches, further strengthening the southern facade. Below the left window is the entrance to the sacristy, with a simple profiled jamb and a four-centred arch, indicating its later reconstruction.\nThe facade is crowned with a stepped gable with blind windows (a type of double pediment), behind which are hidden double-pitched roofs. The blind windows with one slope are placed just above the string course with a pulpit face. Ten white-plastered segmented blind windows are separated by bars. They feature blind plastered tracery and are symmetrically arranged with respect to the facade axis. In the central part above the sacristy, there is a protruding part of an octagonal turret, crowned with a tented roof. The turret, resembling a pinnacle, is an extension of the buttress, which is located above the faced string course with a continuous frieze of blind plastered tracery. In the roofing part, it features an arcade frieze with Virgin Mary symbolism, and just below it, there are four narrow windows. The slopes of the gables are crowned with a so-called cornice molding with concave-convex raking moldings. The side, eastern wall of the sacristy features the same window as the facade part and a niche directly above it.\nThe interior of the sacristy consists of two rooms with different types of vaults, namely rib vault and lierne vault. They are connected by a single pointed-arch passage with stairs. One of the rooms is located on a half-floor (the so-called mezzanine).\n\n\n=== Nave ===\n\nThe nave connects with the western wall of the chancel and the sacristy, with its ridge facing Kościelna Street. The hall is covered by a double-pitched roof with small dormer windows, once crowned with a small bell. Together with the roofing of the added St. Mary's Chapel, it forms a multi-pitched roof, slightly overlapping the church tower.\nOn the gable wall, there is one pointed-arch window with a single slope and a pulpit-like sill, divided by two bars. It has a plinth and an additional pulpit-like parapet cornice. Just below it, in the corner of the wall, there is a bricked-up pointed-arch entrance with a single slope. Above the window runs a cornice with a short metope frieze featuring a plant motif along with a characteristic modillion. The corners are topped with pinnacles and reinforced with buttresses. The gable of the wall, which has numerous narrow window openings, is crowned with a star. The southern wall features 4 four-jamb incomplete pointed-arch windows, divided by two bars and filled with stained glass. The windows on this elevation have a plinth, and at the bottom, pulpit-like parapet cornices.\nA string course with a rustic profile at the bottom (with shapes resembling vault sections) separates the part of the wall from the roof slope. It features a continuous frieze with metope motifs of vine tendrils. This is the second such frieze encountered in Pomeranian religious architecture. A similar one is found on the facade of the Franciscan Church of St. John the Evangelist in Szczecin. In some publications, authors suggest that it was transferred from the former, demolished Franciscan church, which was located on Kościelna Street in Gryfice. In the fragment below the right window of the southern wall, there are also metopes embedded into the southern elevation (so-called spolia). Above the upper frieze (mutule), there are two rows of two- and three-layer walls with a cross brickwork. The length of the elevation is reinforced with two buttresses and strengthened with three with two slopes, located between the windows.\nBetween the second and third buttress, at the bottom of the elevation, a side entrance to the church was added. It is hexagonal in plan, angled towards Kościelna Street. On two walls, there are two-pointed-arch portals with two slopes, the second forming the jamb. Above the doors, there are so-called pointed-arch transoms, divided by three bars and filled with stained glass. The corner is reinforced with a buttress. In the upper part, divided by a string course with a pulpit-like face, there are seven pointed-arch blinds (one corner and two pairs of smaller and larger ones with two slopes). The side entrance is topped with a double stepped gable with a butterfly roof. The gable slopes are crowned with a pulpit-like face with a so-called crowning cornice, a double rustic profile, and concave-convex raking moldings.\nOn the western elevation of the nave, on both sides, there are blind archivolts with three niches and two bricked-up portals. On the right side (in the upper part), there is a rectangular, rounded niche. At the bottom (bricked-up) portal, with a concave-convex pointed arch and a single pointed-arch slope. On the left side, there are two niches, with the upper one being rectangular with a single slope, the middle one wider, but rounded with a segmental arch, and the lower one (bricked-up portal) with a concave-convex pointed arch and two slopes. It is finished with a characteristic wimperg. The western wall is reinforced with buttresses and octagonal towers with tented roofs. The upper parts of the towers are wider than the lower ones, divided by a horizontal rustic profile. They also have an arcade frieze and metopes with plant motifs. The roof gables of the tower are crowned with flower motifs.\n\nOn the northern wall of the nave, there are two windows with two slopes, divided by two bars, one directly above the wing of the building. At the top, there is a cornice with a metope frieze with a floral motif and a modillion, which is identical to the southern one. The wing is characterized by a simple structure with a bricked-up pointed-arch portal with three cut slopes (the so-called \"dead\" portal, from which doors used to lead to the church cemetery) with a distinguished capital and foundation zone. It is topped with a faced, pulpit-like doorframe cornice. The wall is reinforced with one buttress located between the windows and two corner ones. On the left side of the elevation, St. Mary's Chapel was added.\nFrom the church porch to the nave, there are wide metal and glazed doors (main double-winged and a pair of side single-winged) with a rectangular transom. The structure of the nave with rib-vaulting and a truss system is supported by six main and octagonal pillars, connected by transverse beams with buttresses. The remaining four are attached to the wall of the western and eastern walls of the nave and also serve as buttresses. The main pillars separate the main nave from the side aisles (ambulatories). Above the side aisles, there are wooden galleries supported by rafters. The side matronea are connected to part of the organ folder. Additionally, the nave has two long galleries with separate entrances, located on the southern and northern walls. They serve as side additional choirs. Directly opposite the southern ambulatory is a 15th-century side altarpiece (triptych). The inner elevation contains 18th-century epitaphs and is covered with numerous polychrome frescoes, including figural polychromes.\n\n\n==== St. Mary's Chapel ====\n\nThe northern facade of the nave was extended with a two-storey chapel of St. Mary, featuring a gable roof with small dormer windows (part of the multi-pitched roof, which together form the nave). The roof is bordered by an attic on the northern side. The facade faces Victory Square, while the ridge faces Wojska Polskiego and Niepodległości streets. Built on a quadrangle plan, in the late Gothic style, as the final part of the religious structure.\nIn the front section, two stained glass windows with two chamfers, two mullions, and lower parapet pulpits are placed. The left one has a plinth and an additional parapet cornice. Beneath the right window, there is a pointed-arch portal with five voussoirs and rusticated, rounded, full-arch reveals. The irregularly arranged corbels have profiles with a cross-section of batons, using brickwork. Double doors lead to the chapel, with a rounded upper part. On the right side, a pentagonal tower is situated, accessible from the inside by stairs. It is crowned with a truncated butterfly roof resembling an inverted chalice, protruding beyond the face of the tower. The wall in the central and corner parts has been reinforced with buttresses, which in the upper part merge into a continuous, straight plastered frieze. At the top of the elevation, there are ten white plastered embrasures. Each pair is divided by a mullion. They are symmetrically placed relative to the apex axis, forming two equally sized details. Above the central, highest pair, a circular embrasure is placed, reminiscent of a smooth tondo. The embrasures have unevenly distributed narrow window openings and one larger opening with a segmental arch and chamfer. The apex is crowned with six pinnacles, each having pyramidal roofs with finials.\n\nThe western facade is equipped with two windows of different sizes. The first, full one on the left side, is almost round. It is a window with two chamfers, two mullions, and a parapet at the bottom. The second, placed on the right side, is narrower (also full), with a segmental arch and two chamfers, divided by a single mullion and having a simple tracery in the upper part. The bottom is filled with a parapet. A buttress is placed in the middle, dividing the frieze with blind tracery under a rustic profile and cornice. This part of the elevation is also reinforced by a corner buttress and a pentagonal tower. The eastern elevation is almost identical to the western one, except that the windows are incomplete and have a plinth, finished at the bottom with a double parapet. The narrower one, with tracery, is on the left side, and opposite it, on the western side, is a twin window. This part of the elevation lacks a frieze; instead, it is finished with a cornice, with a rustic profile at the bottom.\nThe interior of the chapel consists of one main room, located on the western wall. The room with a rib vault is supported by an octagonal pillar. It covers half of the chapel's area. Two smaller rooms of different sizes are placed on the second floor on the eastern side. The main hall connects to the nave through a portal and to the upper rooms and tower via stairs. The church library was arranged in one of the rooms on the upper floor. In the southeastern part of the ground floor, there is a burial crypt of Field Marshal Adam von Flemming-Rönz. In 1910, the sarcophagus with the remains of the deceased was transferred to the Flemming family mausoleum in Benice near Kamień Pomorski. Among the crypt's relics is a wooden epitaph with a gilded Latin inscription, located on the eastern wall of the chapel.\n\n\n=== Church tower ===\n\nThe church tower (compact belfry) faces the Niepodległości Street with its facade. It consists of five parts, separated by a dividing cornice.\nIn the first, lower part of the tower on the western side, there is a pointed-arch portal with eight voussoirs. The corbels have profiles with a cross-section of batons, with different brickwork. Wooden double doors are mounted in the bossaged, pointed-arch reveal. Above the portal lintel, there is a tympanum with a cartouche, adorned with an inscription: St. Mary's Church in Gryfice. Blind archivolts are visible on the southern wall. In the second part, three full Gothic windows are situated, with a segmental arch and three voussoirs, separated by three mullions (southern, western, and northern sides). The windows are filled with stained glass and finished with a parapet cornice at the bottom. Above them, there is a wide plastered frieze with blind tracery. At the bottom, just above the face, there are ten architectural details, called mascarons, probably depicting the builders and founders of the tower.\nThe third part of the tower features large pointed-arch embrasures, three on each wall, filled with plastered blind tracery, crowned with a rounded rosette and divided into smaller longitudinal blind biforas (Stargard type). These also have a rounded rosette and are divided by a pillar and two mullions. Above them is a simple plastered frieze. The fourth part contains small embrasures, four on each wall, visually similar to the larger ones, except they lack rounded smaller rosettes and are divided only by one bifora pillar. Some of them have window openings. Between the second and third embrasure on the southern and northern sides, clock faces are placed. Two narrow embrasures also appear on the eastern side, in the corner of the tower facade, separated by the ridge of the gable roof over the nave. The embrasures are plastered white. Besides their decorative function, they also serve to relieve the weight of the upper parts of the structure by reducing the thickness of the wall. The tower is crowned with a two-stepped cornice.\n\nThe fifth and highest part is crowned with a Baroque, copper spire. Its base forms a truncated pyramidal roof. Above it, a cubic structure is located, with eight narrow sound openings, positioned on each of the four walls and covered with a spire. Above it, there is an octagonal roof lantern. The first, wooden lower part is wider. It has two narrow sound openings on each of the four sides and is covered with a truncated pyramidal roof. The second, narrower part with eight window openings with segmental arches and concave-convex bases (a type of viewing balcony) is covered, like the first part, with the same type of roofing. The uppermost part is a pinnacle, topped with a finial.\nThe interior of the tower comprises a star-vaulted vestibule. Here are located: a historic early medieval baptismal font, numerous 18th-century epitaphs, and one contemporary from 1973. Memorial plaques are also placed on the inner facade. An arched entrance leads to the upper part of the tower, filled with a wooden door leaf, located in the eastern wall of the vestibule, on the southern facade.\n\n\n=== Illumination ===\nThe building, as the first of the city's historic structures, has been illuminated with special light fixtures, which were installed in the ground and directed towards the load-bearing walls of the structure. Metal-halide and sodium-vapor lamps were installed. The tower roof is also illuminated.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSt. Mary's Church\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nCieśliński, A. (1993). \"Tablice epitafijne w kościele pw.

        "content": "Refinado Tom (28 August 1993–9 December 2019) was an Argentinian thoroughbred racehorse who won the Argentinian Triple Crown in 1996.\nHe was later cloned for breeding polo ponies.\n\n\n== Background ==\nRefinado Tom was a chestnut stallion with a star and an off-center snip, bred by Haras La Biznaga, one of the most famous and historic farms in Argentina. He was foaled in the early morning of August 28, 1993.\nShy Tom, Refinado Tom's sire, was a multiple graded stakes winner in the United States, where he was bred. He won the Grade 3 Baltimore Budweiser Breeders' Cup Handicap, Grade 3 Salvator Mile Handicap, and Grade 3 Gulfstream Park Budweiser Breeders' Cup Handicap. In December of 1991, he was exported to stand stud in Argentina at Haras La Biznaga, starting the 1992 breeding season. Refinado Tom was part of his first crop and would be his most successful offspring.\nRefinado Tom's dam, Ma Raffine, was bred and campaigned by Haras La Biznaga. She won one of twelve races before being retired. Refinado Tom was her second foal. She came from a classic family known for performing well in long races.\nHaras La Biznaga normally sold all of the colts they bred, but Refinado Tom was retained due to a lack of interest from potential buyers.\nRefinado Tom was trained by Roberto M. Bullrich and ridden by Jorge Valdivieso during his Argentinian campaigns.\nRefinado Tom was well-built, with the physique of a sprinter. He had a large rump, big muscles, and a wide forehead. He was said to look more like an American Quarter Horse than a thoroughbred. Refinado Tom was unfriendly and had a poor temperament, such that Bullrich was unable to get close to him to saddle him on race days and he needed to be saddled outside of stalls so he wouldn't kick. He performed poorly in morning workouts, but ran much better in afternoon races.\n\n\n== Racing career ==\n\n\n=== Two-year-old season (1995/1996) ===\nWhen Refinado Tom entered training, he didn't show much promise. He failed to impress in his debut on February 25, 1996, finishing fourth in a 1200-meter maiden race at Hipódromo Argentino de Palermo. He ran again in another maiden race on March 17, and this time ran much better, impressing trainer Roberto \"Coco\" Bullrich, who said that he was surprised at how quickly Refinado Tom had become competitive and that it was as if the colt had figured out \"what this racing thing was about\".\nRefinado Tom was then pointed to stakes races, with his next start being in the Group 1 Gran Premio Raúl y Raúl E. Chevalier, a 1400-meter turf race at Hipódromo de San Isidro. He won the race, squeezing between the frontrunner and the rail to take the lead and win decisively.\nRefinado Tom was made the heavy favorite for the Group 1 Gran Criterium, run over 1600 meters a month later at the same track. He developed an allergic reaction in the days leading up to the race, although continued training normally. Juan Ithuralde, the manager of Haras La Biznaga, and Bullrich argued over whether or not to run Refinado Tom in the race. In the Gran Criterium itself, Refinado Tom ran poorly, finishing third, leading to concerns about his ability to handle longer distances.\nRefinado Tom's allergic reaction cleared up in the following three weeks, in time for the Group 1 Carreras de las Estrellas Juvenile at Hipódromo Argentino de Palermo, the last race of Refinado Tom's two-year-old season. Due to his defeat in the Gran Criterium, Refinado Tom was not the favorite for the race, but he ran to his usual standards to win by several lengths.\n\n\n=== Three-year-old season (1996/1997) ===\nRefinado Tom's three-year-old season opened with the Group 1 Gran Premio Polla de Potrillos, the first leg of the Argentinian Triple Crown, run over 1600 meters on the dirt at Hipódromo Argentino de Palermo, like the Carreras de las Estrellas Juvenile. There was a lot of rain leading up to the race, and it was rainy the day of the race as well. It was to be Refinado Tom's first run on an off track. Refinado Tom ran off the lead until jockey Jorge Valdivieso let him go, at which point Refinado Tom passed the frontrunners to take the lead 300 meters from the finish line. Refinado Tom drew away from the field to win by nine lengths, with Valdivieso later calling it the chestnut's easiest win.\nIt rained prior to the second leg of the Triple Crown as well, the Group 1 Gran Premio Jockey Club, a 2000-meter race on the turf at Hipódromo de San Isidro. Hopes were high for Refinado Tom, and he ran as expected, taking the lead in the stretch from Alpino Fitz to finish first by a length and a half. La Nación praised his performance, saying that Refinado Tom was on the road to have his name occupy a principal place in the history of the Argentinian turf.\nThe third and final leg of the Argentinian Triple Crown, the Group 1 Gran Premio Nacional, was Refinado Tom's next race. Despite some concerns over its 2500-meter length, many expected Refinado Tom to win the race and the Triple Crown. Refinado Tom seemed uncomfortable for much of the race, and spent a good portion  of the race in the middle of the pack behind the frontrunning Alpino Fitz. In the stretch, Alpino Fitz tired and drifted to the outside, where Refinado Tom was coming up alongside him, pushing Refinado Tom out towards the center of the track. Jorge Valdivieso had to correct abruptly, avoiding touching Alpino Fitz while maintaining Refinado Tom's space. Refinado Tom passed Alpino Fitz to take the lead, but was starting to tire when Funny Toy made  a late bid. Refinado Tom turned back the challenge, winning \"by sheer arrogance\" by a neck.\nAfter the race, during a celebration party, Refinado Tom was examined by the veterinarian and turned up lame. He was loaded on a truck to go to the farm in San Isidro, where ultrasounds would uncover a tear in his left shoulder. Refinado Tom had to skip the Group 1 Gran Premio Carlos Pellegrini, the final leg of the Argentinian Quadruple Crown, while recovering. His owners decided to send him to the United States to run when he was fully recovered. On March 20, 1997, Refinado Tom was exported to the United States.\nFor his 1996 campaign, Refinado Tom was named the Argentinian Horse of the Year, Champion Two-Year-Old Male, Champion Three-Year-Old Male, Champion Stayer, and Champion Older Horse (despite not racing as an older horse that year).\n\n\n=== Four-year-old season (1997/1998) ===\nIn the United States, Refinado Tom returned to training in the care of Richard Mandella. Refinado Tom continued to receive therapeutic work on his shoulder injury. Mandella trained Refinado Tom to be better prepared at the start of a race.\nRefinado Tom started as the favorite in his first three races in the United States, the ungraded Wickerr Handicap, the Grade 3 William P. Kyne Handicap, and the listed Arcangues Handicap, all run in California. He failed to perform well in any of them, finishing seventh, third, and fifth, respectively.\nDespite his losses, Refinado Tom was still fairly well regarded and started as the second choice in his fourth American start, the Grade 3 Native Diver Handicap. In the race, Refinado Tom ran in the second position before taking the lead to win by seven lengths. Jockey Gary Stevens compared Refinado Tom's acceleration to that of Gentlemen, another Argentinian import, on whom he had won the race the previous year in a record-setting performance.\nRefinado Tom then ran third in the Grade 2 San Antonio Handicap, sixth in the Grade 3 New Orleans Handicap, and failed to finish in the Grade 2 San Bernardino Handicap, his last race as a four-year-old.\n\n\n=== Five-year-old season (1998/1999) ===\nSix months after not finishing in the San Bernardino Handicap, Refinado Tom ran again in his first race as a five-year-old in an allowance race at Santa Anita on October 14, 1998. He finished fourth in the six and a half furlong long turf race. He ran twice that November, in the ungraded Skywalker Handicap and listed Forty-Niner Handicap, again finishing fourth in both races.\nOn February 26, 1999, Refinado Tom returned to Argentina, with plans to retire him to stud. Bullrich greeted him when the airplne landed, and Refinado Tom searched for his hand with the white chocolates that Bullrich regularly gave him.\nRefinado Tom went through the usual quarantine and came out of it so well that the decision was made to postpone his retirement to stud and instead continue racing him. Bullrich noted that Refinado Tom came back from the United States with a better work ethic in the mornings.\nIn his first race back in Argentina, Refinado Tom won the Group 2 Gran Premio Benito Villanueva. He followed it up a month later with a win in the Group 1 Carreras de las Estrellas Classic. In the latter, he defeated Group 1 winners Coalsack, Flirteador, Magic Corner, Gold Fire, and Rubio First.\n\n\n=== Six-year-old season (1999/2000) ===\nRefinado Tom ran six times as a six-year-old, finishing first in the Group 3 Gran Premio Italia, second in the Group 1 Gran Premio General San Martin, and third in the Group 1 Gran Premio Copa de Oro.\n\n\n== Race record ==\n\nAn asterisk after the odds means Refinado Tom was the post time favorite. † indicates a coupled entry.\n\n\n== Stud career ==\nRefinado Tom retired to stud at his home farm of Haras La Biznaga. He proved to be subfertile, producing two foals from fourteen services in his first year and only producing one foal the following year. Two of his foals made it to the races, both winners, with Refina y Sobria being the superior racer. She was graded stakes placed in 2006, finishing second in the Group 2 Clásico Miguel Luis Morales and third in the Group 1 Gran Premio Selección de Potrancas.\nFollowing his second year at stud, Refinado Tom was pensioned from stud duties to live out his life at Haras La Biznaga, where Bullrich would come visit to give him chocolates and take photos. Bullrich had started the habit of giving Refinado Tom small white chocolates when he was a foal.\nRefinado Tom died at the age of 26 due to old age, on December 9, 2019.\nRefinado Tom was cloned, with the resulting foal being born in 2018. The clone is not eligible to race as Thoroughbred racehorses must be conceived naturally to be registered, and is instead intended to be used for the breeding of polo horses for Santiago Blaquier.\n\n\n== Pedigree ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Asquith Brothers Limited is a British manufacturer of automobiles.\n\n\n== Company history ==\nThe company was founded on July 30, 1912, in Thornhill near Dewsbury in West Yorkshire. In the 1970s there were experiments with formula racing cars. Production of automobiles and kits began in 1985. The brand name is Asquith. Michael Asquith Fox heads the company.  A total of around 40 copies have been created so far.\nThere is no connection with Asquith Motors, who use the same brand name.\n\n\n== Vehicles ==\nThe first model was the MPH in its first version. This was the replica of the Riley MPH, a 1930s roadster. The body was made of aluminium. Many parts came from Riley. The new price for a complete vehicle was from £40,000. Around six copies were made between 1985 and 1999. The vehicle should still be available to order.\nIn 1989 the second and later the third version supplemented the range. A spaceframe frame formed the basis. The fenders and trunk lid were made of fiberglass. Many parts came from the Ford Sierra. The construction costs were only around £20,000. Around 30 copies were made by 1999. This model is also still available to order.\nThe penny has been on sale since 1999. This is something like a modern version of the Bond Bug, but with four wheels. A Yamaha R1 engine with 170 hp powers the vehicles. So far, around four copies have been made.\n\n\n== Literature ==\nGeorge Nicholas Georgano (ed.): The Beaulieu Encyclopedia of the Automobile.

        "content": "The Sauganash Trail is a paved trail in Chicago, Illinois in the United States. It is operated by the Chicago Park District, and runs from West Bryn Mawr Ave to West Devon Ave. There are four official paved entrances at West Bryan Mawr Ave, North Rogers Ave, West Thome Ave, and West Devon Ave. The line was originally part of the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company (C&NW) Railroad as the Skokie Branch and opened in 1924. Service was elevated in 1931 and service ceased on December 1, 1958 as part of the plan to close 22 stations in the City of Chicago and the close suburbs by the C&NW. The tracks remained abandoned until 1994 when the tracks were removed. The right-of-way remained abandoned until June 21, 2008 when the trail was dedicated by then Chicago mayor Richard M. Daley.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Mask: I Pledge Allegiance to the Mask! is an American dark comedy-horror supervillain comic book limited series written by Christopher Cantwell and illustrated by Patric Reynolds. Published by Dark Horse Comics as a revival of the semi-anthological self-titled comic book series and franchise, the series chronicles the events following the mask being once again unearthed after twenty years by politician Abner Mead, who aims to use it and the \"Big Head\" reputation to become President of the United States, opposed by a now-Mayor Kathy and retired Detective Kellaway.\nThe series received a positive critical reception, with a GraphicAudio audio play adaptation of the series releasing in 2021, starring the voices of Eric Messner and Keith Richards.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nTwenty years ago, a mask of unknown origin and limitless power was buried in the concrete of an apartment building's basement floor by Mitch Kellaway, Edge City and the world at large having all but forgotten the mysterious green-faced killer known as \"Big Head\". Only after struggling politician Abner Mead acquires the mask in 2019, and uses its power to gain favour of the general populace and run for office as President of the United States, going up against now-Mayor Kathy Matthews on her own campaign, as well as a returning Kellaway.\n\n\n== Development ==\nIn July 2019, Dark Horse Comics announced a new The Mask limited series to be in development from writer Christopher Cantwell and artist Patric Reynolds, entitled The Mask: I Pledge Allegiance to the Mask! and following a new wearer of the mask as he runs for president as Big Head, under the slogan of \"Make America Green Again!\" (as a satire of the Trump presidency).\nIn October 2019, Cantwell described the series as \"the grotesque exaggeration of our worst desires and a warped funhouse mirror of our best intentions\", having \"wanted to write a series where new readers could jump in right away, and one that also honors the original books\" on being approached by series editor Daniel Chabon to do so, describing \"truest thing for me is that the protagonists are Kathy and Kellaway, as they’ve always been. Of course, now they’re decades older. So, they’re at once new characters to jump into, but have their shared history as well\", with Cantwell himself as having \"channeled a lot of anger and frustration into this book. Everything seems so absurd and abusive and invasive now, even the things that say they’re trying to help you, or make your life better. It’s not true—they’re stealing your data, destroying your privacy, and dividing all of us into these tribal factions. Add into that global stress on resources and climate change, and you get quite a melting pot of chaos. The media traffics in hyperbole, but there is also an awful lot of hard evidence pointing to humanity being on the very brink of catastrophe. This story is set on that cliff’s edge. Maybe it’s even set after the fall, during the terminal velocity descent.\" The series was published by Dark Horse Comics across four issues from October 16, 2019, to January 22, 2020, and collected as an omnibus edition on June 10, 2020.\n\n\n== Characters ==\nMitch Kellaway – A retired police detective and former wearer of the mask who returns in order to face the new Big Head.\nKathy Matthews – The mayor of Edge City and a former wearer of the mask, running for the office of U.S. President.\nAbner Mead – A struggling politician and the current wearer of the mask, using the \"Big Head\" rep to run for President.\n\n\n== Adaptation ==\nOn September 11, 2021, Graphic Audio and Dark Horse Comics announced an audio play adaptation of I Pledge Allegiance to the Mask! to have been developed for release in two days, which Christopher Cantwell subsequently revealed himself to have had no involvement with, stating that \"I had no idea this was being made, was never informed, consulted, or… anything. But this is my comic book script writing, revised without me and performed. Definitely a new experience for me as a writer. I don't know how to feel\". Produced with a full cast of actors, sound effects, and cinematic music, the audio play series stars the voices of Eric Messner and Keith Richards as Big Head, alongside:\n\n\n== Future ==\nIn October 2019, Cantwell revealed that \"Patric [Reynolds] and I have ideas for a prequel and a sequel\" to I Pledge Allegiance to the Mask!, provided Dark Horse Comics would order a follow-up limited series.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Mask: I Pledge Allegiance to the Mask! at Dark Horse Comics\nThe Mask: I Pledge Allegiance to the Mask! at GraphicAudio",

        "content": "The Death of Krishna took place according to ancient Hindu scholars on the first day of the Chaitra month in the Hindu calendar which corresponds to 18th February 3102 BCE in the English calendar in Bhalka, Gir Somnath district, India at 2 PM 27 minutes and 30 seconds which is believed to be the exact time of death. It is believed that a hunter by the name of Jara was hunting in the forest while lord Krishna was along the side of the Hiran River resting, accidentally the hunter shot the foot of lord Krishna with an arrow thinking he shot a deer, later Krishna accepted death and left the earth and went back to Vaikuntha to his original form of lord Vishnu eventually ending his incarnation on Earth. It is believed that Krishna was around aged 125 at the time of his death. \nIt is also believed that the end of Krishna's death the Dvapara Yuga ended and the Kali Yuga started which is the current age in the present time.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAccording to Mahabharata, the Kurukshetra war resulted in the death of all the hundred sons of Gandhari. On the night before Duryodhana's death, Krishna visited Gandhari to offer his condolences. Gandhari felt that Krishna knowingly did not put an end to the war, and in a fit of rage and sorrow, Gandhari cursed that Krishna, along with everyone else from the Yadu dynasty, would perish after 36 years. Krishna himself knew and wanted this to happen as he felt that the Yadavas had become very haughty and arrogant (adharmi), so he ended Gandhari's speech by saying \"tathastu\" (so be it). It is believed that Gandhari's curse to Krishna was also responsible for his death eventually.  \n\n\n== Death of Krishna ==\n\nAfter 36 years passed, a fight broke out between the Yadavas, at a festival, who killed each other. His elder brother, Balarama, left his body through Yoga. The events leading up to Lord Krishna's death are described in The Srimad-Bhagavatam, Canto 11 Chapter 30. Krishna was murdered by an arrow that a poacher mistook for a deer and shot him in the foot. That would have been the result of his previous incarnation as the reincarnation of Rama. The accumulation of multiple curses caused Krishna's suffering.\nEnraged, Durvasa swore that Krishna must perish at his feet. The scene was in Prabhas Patan Theertham, in a wooded area next to the Hiran River. Since he had decided that this was the time for the Karmic debt to be paid off, he presented the left foot while sitting in silence for meditation. He knew what was going to happen. Since he was a Kanahiya. He was called the giver—the brilliant one who had nothing to seek and gave magnificently. However, mistaking this for a deer, the hunter shot him in the foot. Krishna was injured in his left ankle. The gunman Jara was shocked to find Krishna, dressed in yellow, lying in the where he thought his victim had been. When he realised how grave his error had been, he was struck with regret and despair. He fell at Krishna's feet in shock and pleaded for mercy. In his final remarks, the deceased Krishna stated that this was not carelessness because it was inevitable. Krishna spoke kindly to the hunts man. Be not sorry or terrified, for these are the ways of fate. the magnificent man's last remarks before departing this earth. Krishna realised that karma is a universal law. It has an impact on people and deities alike. Jara heard Krishna's voice from within, as if by miracle, and he said, \"You must not regret. In Treta Yuga, I, Rama, destroyed you. In a previous life, you were Mahabali. \"As I prepare to leave this body, I was hoping for an opportunity to end my life. I have been waiting for you to help me release our karmic burden.\" His death marked the end of the Dvapara Yuga (Era). His death took place on the first day of the Kali Yuga, an important period in world history. The monks, Arjuna, and Daruka, who had come to perform the final ceremonies for the Yadus who had been waiting for the discovery of Krishna's body when Jara, the shooter, approached the group and guided them to the location. Arjuna sobbed uncontrollably when he held Krishna's body in his hands. In the thick undergrowth, Arjuna burnt and burned the corpse of Sri Krishna.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nArjuna gave the Dvārakā people seven nights to leave the country. He knew that the Yadava palace will soon be swallowed by the water. He declared to the people that they would be ruled by the Vajra, the youthful warrior who would one day govern Krishna. Then Arjuna set off for Prabhasa to perform the burial rites for the deceased, including Shri Krishna, Shri Balarama, and the rest. Seven nights after his homecoming, Arjuna started his journey back to Hastinapura. He took a large bunch of women, kids, and as much money as he could afford. Just after him, the settlement of Dwaraka disappeared beneath the swiftly moving ocean waves (As described in Srimad Bhagavatam Canto 11 Chapter 31). Arjuna's group was robbed on the way back to their home. Additionally, the bandits they took jewelry, other items, and multiple women with them. Arjuna found that he could not use any of his heavenly arms, nor could he repel the thieves. Arjuna brought all the Yadava survivors to Kurukshetra. Then he crowned Vajra as the ruler of Indraprastha. Krishna's wife Rukmini killed herself by plunging into a fire. His other spouse, Satyabhama, went to the Mountains for devotion. Arjuna proceeded to the monastery of Vyasa subsequent to Kurukshetra.\nThere, the old man consoled Arjuna, saying, \"You need not be depressed. Your strength was completely depleted as you achieved every expectation, which gave the thieves the advantage. It was decided what would happen to the Kshatriyas and Yadavas.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nKrishna\nBala Krishna\nVasudeva\nBhagvad Gita\nMahabarata\n\n\n== Sources ==\nBryant, Edwin F.

Han would start developing the casino-hotel complex as early as 2006 with no connections to Filipinos.\nThe development of the Hann Resorts began with the  opening of the Widus Hotel in 2008. The hotel initially suffered low occupancy rates coinciding a a global financial crisis until the owners were granted a license to operate a casino in 2009.\nThe complex would expand with the opening of the 260-room Clark Marriott Hotel in 2018.\nThe complex would then be re-inaugurated under its current name \"Hann Casino Resort\" in December 15, 2021.\nAnother hotel, the Swissôtel Clark would open within the integrated resort in 2022.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Fun in a Chinese Laundry is an autobiography by Austrian-American filmmaker Josef von Sternberg first published in 1965 by Macmillan Publishers. The book was reissued in 1988 by Mercury House with a foreword by Gary Cooper.\nVon Sternberg provides details from his childhood in Vienna and youth in America, as well every stage of his film career. The memoir provides numerous character sketches and critiques of film personnel, especially the actors he worked with, among them Marlene Dietrich.\nThe eponymous title of the autobiography is a reference to a 1894 Kinetoscope film by American inventor and film pioneer Thomas Edison\n\n\n== Background ==\nPortions of von Sternberg's autobiography were penned as early as 1960 while he traveling in Europe. Literary critic Ruairi McCann writes:\n\n  “Fun in a Chinese Laundry was published 12 years after Sternberg last embarked on a feature, and despite floating the possibility of working again, in the midst of all the bridges burning, it never came to be, as he passed four years later.”\n\n\n=== Significance of the book’s title ===\nFun in a Chinese Laundry is a metaphor for the medium that would dominate von Sternberg's artistic and professional endeavors. The movie appeared when both von Sternberg and the film technology were in their infancy. The title for the autobiography is that of a 1894 Kinetoscope burlesque by Thomas Edison. Released shortly before von Sternberg's birth,  he offers no explicit remark as to its significance or its influence on his filmmaking.\nThe reference to the film in his autobiography follows a sustained reminiscence of the famous amusement park and the childhood in Vienna that von Sternberg recalls idyllically as “paradise.”\n\n Everything was orderly, there was nothing to confuse me, there were no comic strips, no radio, no motion pictures or moronic succession of television images, though unbeknownst to me, one Thomas Edison had already made a film entitled Fun in a Chinese Laundry.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nKirkus Reviews, in its March 8, 1965 edition described the memoir as “corrosively witty, frank and rather outrageous memoir…His story is one of dirty deals, awesome neglect and a few triumphs. It should become a little classic in its field.”\nAuthor and editor Norman Kaplan in the Fall issue of Science and Society wrote: “That this is so can be corroborated by a reading of Joseph Von Sternberg's new book Fun in a Chinese Laundry—an unabashed and brash boast of a lifetime spent as a purveyor to the most prurient appetites of audiences by a man who prates of his triumph side by side with his expression of contempt for the medium and its audiences.”\n\n\n== Retrospective assessment ==\nFilm critic Jean-Paul Chaillet considers Fun in a Chinese Laundry of particular interest for its insights into von Sternberg's long personal and professional relationship with German-American film star Marlene Dietrich:\n\n The first meeting of those two titans of cinema and their ensuing complex relationship has been dissected, reinvented, manipulated, embellished so many times through the years, that it is fascinating to read the carefully worded first-hand recollection of von Sternberg himself.\nChaillet adds that von Sternberg, “at times sounding quite pompous and arrogant, rants about Dietrich’s self-serving public acknowledgments of his greatness over the years.”\nWriter and filmworker Ruairi McCann notes that the autobiography “is rife with the characteristics of von Sternberg’s personality and cinema; an unflappability, a searing, sardonic wit and a love for spectacle that comes, part and parcel, with a gift for its creation and dissection” and structurally, the memoir “does not move to the letter of a strict and straight chronology, nor is its language crystalline. Instead, the details of his life and career are often presented allusively, rather than as a procession of stated facts…”\nMcCann adds that “The book is often very funny...Moments or recurring events that in other biographies would be singled out and analyzed as sources of future pain or strength, he undercuts with a stone dry sense of humor.”\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nChaillet, Jean-Paul. 2020.

        "content": "Incubus (Italian: Il male oscuro, lit. 'The Dark Evil') is a 1964 novel by the Italian writer Giuseppe Berto. It received the Viareggio Prize and the Premio Campiello.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe novel takes the form of a stream of consciousness, frequently with sentences that go on for many pages. It is about a man in his 60s who battles with guilt and exhaustion after the death of his father, with whom he had a complicated and dysfunctional relationship. There are memories about the father and about relationships with women. The protagonist talks about his own physical illnesses and visits a psychoanalyst.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nKirkus Reviews compared the book to both \"a confessional\" and \"a tirade\". The critic called it \"a bravura performance\" with \"wickedly funny lucidity\", writing that its best moments are \"uncommonly uncomfortable\". Time called the book tiresome, with no artistic reason for its long sentences, and wrote that many readers can be expected to put it away after fewer than 100 pages. The critic wrote that it reminds readers why the influence of Sigmund Freud \"sure is bad for writing\".\nThe book was awarded the Viareggio Prize and the Premio Campiello.\n\n\n== Adaptation ==\nThe book is the basis for the 1990 film Dark Illness directed by Mario Monicelli.\n\n\n== References ==",

He then appears in 868 at a royal court, in 877 as executor of his first cousin Echard and in 879 in a charter of Count Adelram II.\nFrom an unknown wife he had three children: Theodoric, Adhemar and a daughter of an unknown name married to Adelram II and the mother of Adelram III.\n\n\n== References ==",

The building stood from 1796 to 1932. The hotel was converted to a hospital during the American Civil War; Louisa May Alcott worked there briefly as a nurse.\nAnother Union Hotel existed in Washington in the 1820s and 1830s; it stood on the north side of Pennsylvania Avenue, between 3rd and 4th streets, \"opposite the Patriotic Bank\". This hotel may have persisted through the 1860s as there is testimony about Atzerodt lingering at the Union Hotel in the lead-up to the Lincoln assassination.\nA hotel called the Union Hotel stood on F Street near the Treasury Department. Dating to 1827, this hotel was a three-story brick building. It also was known as the Globe Hotel for a time. While this hotel was run by Jimmy and Bridget Maher, it was the preferred place to stay of Dakota people visiting the Indian Office. It was sometimes called the Union Hotel and Indian Headquarters.\n\n\n== References ==",

The two countries shared a similar Red Sea boundary, and thus gave rise to their rivalry with this proximity.\nEgypt took the lead with 4 wins, 1 draws and 2 losses. However, all Saudi wins happened to be in FIFA-sanctioned tournaments.\n\n\n== History ==\nDue to their geographical closeness, Egypt and Saudi Arabia have developed a long relationship, although the relations have been fraught between hostilities and rapproachment. During the reign of Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, Egypt and Saudi Arabia had fractious relations and often in confrontation with each other over the Arab affairs, known as the Arab Cold War. The relations between Egypt and Saudi Arabia experienced improvement after Abdel Nasser's death, although their differences remain substantial.\nFollowing the Arab spring, Egypt elected a Muslim Brotherhood member, Mohamed Morsi, as President, which shocked Saudi Arabia due to Saudi opposition to MB. In 2013, a coup sponsored by Saudi Arabia resulted in dictator Abdel Fattah el-Sisi became President, removing the MB from power, leading to criticism that Saudi Arabia was helping the Egyptian junta to eliminate dissent. In 2017, Egypt agreed to transfer four uninhabited islands to Saudi Arabia, which sparked outrage in Egypt. This had resulted in booing of Saudi anthem and the Saudi national team in the 2018 FIFA World Cup, when the two met each other in a dead rubber match.\n\n\n== Matches ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Russian submarine Kaiman (Russian: Кайман, lit. 'caiman') was the lead ship of the Kaiman class of submarines of the Imperial Russian Navy. It was designed by the American engineer Simon Lake and his Lake Torpedo Boat Company before being sold to Russia and built in Saint Petersburg at the Crichton Yard.\nKaiman was laid down in September 1905 and launched in December [O.S. November] 1907, though during its sea trials it was found have many design problems. The boat had to undergo modifications and was finally completed in July 1911 before entering service with the Baltic Fleet, though it was considered obsolete when World War I broke out. It saw action in the first two years of the war, during which Kaiman completed 18 patrols. The submarine did not sink any ships, but it did capture and bring back one German freighter of 1,127 gross register tons (GRT) in October 1915. All of the Kaiman class submarines were struck from the navy list in November 1916 and were left docked at the port of Reval.\nThe crew of Kaiman and the other boats of its class were reassigned to the newer and more advanced Bars and AG class submarines that were entering service. Kaiman and the other three boats of its class spent the rest of the war docked at Reval, in the Estonian Governorate, until the city was captured by the Germans in February 1918, at which point all four were taken to Germany for scrapping.\n\n\n== Design and construction ==\nThe Kaiman class was designed by Simon Lake, the head of the Lake Torpedo Boat Company, who previously sold the submarine Protector to the Imperial Russian Navy, which became the Osetr class. After receiving the first submarine, Russia ordered another five boats of the Osetr class on 10 May 1904, which were completed and launched in the following year. On 1 April 1905 Lake was given a contract by the Russian Navy to develop a new class based on the Osetr design but with more powerful weaponry and a longer range. At first the Russian naval command intended for this new class to become part of its Pacific Fleet in case of another war with Japan, expecting them to be capable of reaching the Japanese coast. But by the time they were completed and entered service in 1911, Russian foreign policy had shifted from focusing on Japan back to Europe, where the Bosnian crisis in 1908 set Russia against Germany and Austria-Hungary. Therefore, the Kaiman class boats became part of the Baltic Fleet as the 2nd Squadron of the Submarine Brigade. Emperor Nicholas II wanted to have submarines in the Baltic Sea that could help protect the Gulf of Finland and the maritime entrance to Saint Petersburg.\nKaiman was laid down in September 1905 and became the first boat in its class to be launched in December [O.S. November] 1907. But completing it and the other three Kaiman class submarines took longer than expected because they were found to have numerous problems. These included not being able to fully submerge, taking 10 minutes to dive, and having a slower maximum speed than what was promised, 10.5 knots (19.4 km/h; 12.1 mph) instead of 15 knots (28 km/h; 17 mph). The Lake Torpedo Boat Company could not fix these issues but wanted the Russian Navy to accept them anyway, which it did, but without paying the final portion of the submarines' total cost of three million rubles. Instead of paying the one million rubles that were still owed, the Ministry of the Navy used those funds to work on the design problems, and they authorized the submarine captains to make any changes to their boats that they deemed necessary. In 1910 all four Kaiman class submarines traveled from the Kronstadt naval base for testing in Finland.\nTests that were done by Russian engineers in Finland discovered that the boats were unstable because they were about 12 tons heavier than intended. The submarines were then sent to the shipyards in Reval to undergo changes, where a four-cylinder section from each of their two gasoline engines and the 47 mm (1.9 in) deck gun on the conning tower were removed, while new ballast pumps and two external Drzewiecki torpedo-launching collars were added. This increased the underwater speed to 7.5 knots (13.9 km/h; 8.6 mph) and reduced the diving time to three minutes. They still continued to have problems even after the improvements and were never seen as very seaworthy. The submarines also had a weak hull that included wood and caused leaks, and the removal of a section from each engine reduced their power from 600 bhp (450 kW) to 400 bhp (300 kW), which also reduced the top surface speed from 10.5 to 8.5 knots (15.7 km/h; 9.8 mph).\n\n\n== Service history ==\n\nKaiman was completed and entered service with the Imperial Baltic Fleet on 24 July [O.S. 11 July] 1911. Between then and the outbreak of World War I, the submarine carried out training dives and exercises.  When the war started Kaiman went on its first patrol in July 1914 from Reval, and Lieutenant Ivan Messer was its commanding officer. In the fall of 1914, Kaiman and the rest of the 2nd Squadron of the Baltic Fleet Submarine Brigade was transferred from Reval in Estonia to the Finnish island of Utö. The island was part of the Turku archipelago in southwest Finland. During the first year of the war, the main role of submarines in the Baltic Sea was to defend the entrance to the Gulf of Finland (between Hanko and Dagö) by patrolling for German ships in predetermined positions and protecting Russian vessels laying minefields. Their operations were made more difficult by the cold climate causing much of the northern Baltic to freeze in the winter months, leading to a pause from about January to April.\nThe first time Kaiman encountered German warships was in the middle of December 1914, when a German squadron led by the cruiser Lübeck was sent to see if a Russian submarine base had been established in the Turku archipelago. Kaiman and two other boats, Alligator and Drakon, were sent out against them when the squadron was spotted, though the Germans left right away after confirming the presence of submarines. Although they were considered obsolete by then, Kaiman and the others were still able to fire four torpedoes. During the winter of 1914–15, its deck gun was also reinstalled.\n\n\n=== 1915 ===\nThe next campaign season for submarines began in April 1915, and the unit Kaiman was part of was re-designated as the 3rd Squadron of the Baltic Fleet Submarine Division.\nThe most significant action involving Kaiman occurred when the submarines were used to stop German ships from entering the Gulf of Riga as the German Army advanced into Latvia in the summer of 1915. On 10 August, a German force of three cruisers (Seydlitz, Von der Tann, and Moltke) along with some destroyers arrived off Utö and started firing their guns at the island. Kaiman and Krokodil were sent to attack the German vessels, and their commander, Vice Admiral Franz von Hipper, chose to withdraw the cruisers after spotting the submarines, and sent German destroyers to attack them. Several days later on 25 August, the German submarine U-9 tried to enter the Utö base to destroy the Russian submarines there. But the Russians had advance warning of the U-boat's mission, and the only submarine left at the base, Kaiman, was leaving the docks to go on patrol when U-9 was approaching the channel that led to the base. The Russian captain, Ivan Messer, spotted the periscope of the U-boat near the channel entrance and prepared to attack, firing two torpedoes at it. U-9's captain also noticed the Russian submarine and began turning to go back out to the sea. The U-boat hit some rocks while in the channel but did not take any significant damage. Both torpedoes from Kaiman narrowly missed and U-9 was able to escape.\nIn the fall of 1915, Kaiman and the other submarines were sent to Mariehamn in the Aland Islands to undergo repairs. Around this time the Russian Naval General Staff decided to change their strategy and ordered their submarines to target the shipping of iron ore from Sweden to Germany. Kaiman and Drakon left the port of Mariehamn on 20 October 1915 to begin the new mission. While on patrol in the Sea of Åland, during which it also entered Sweden's territorial waters, Kaiman captured the 1,127-ton merchant ship Stahleck on 29 October. Submarine operations ended for the year not long after that as the winter months began. During that time, Lieutenant Messer was reassigned from Kaiman to the newer Bars-class submarine Volk. Despite having gone on several patrols during the 1915 sailing season, by the end of it Kaiman had not sunk any ships and neither did any other Russian submarine in the Baltic Sea.\n\n\n=== 1916–18 ===\nWhen the 1916 sailing season started the Russian Navy was in the process of replacing the Kaiman class with the newer Bars class submarines. In March 1916 Kaiman was reassigned to the 5th Squadron of the Baltic Sea Submarine Division. That year's naval campaign was uneventful for Kaiman, which did not sink any ships at this time either, but it did carry out the last known attack by any submarine of its class on 24 August 1916, when one of its torpedoes narrowly missed a German merchant ship. The government of Sweden  protested this because the attack took place in Swedish waters. In total since 1914, Kaiman completed 18 war patrols up to this point.\nWhen the 1916 campaign ended in November, the Kaiman class boats were all struck from the navy list on the 15th of that month. That was because several new Bars and AG class submarines had entered service with the Baltic Fleet Submarine Division. Kaiman and its sister ships remained docked at the port of Reval for over a year, where they were also partially dismantled, while their crews were sent to serve on the new submarines. Kaiman was still in Reval when the German Army took control of the city in February 1918, and all four boats were taken to Germany to be turned into scrap metal.\n\n\n=== Summary ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Works ===\nBreemer, Jan S.

        "content": "Jarê is a religious practice of African origin found exclusively in the Chapada Diamantina region, in the central region of the Brazilian state of Bahia, especially among the descendants of Africans from the Lençóis region. It is characterized as a less orthodox branch of Candomblé, forming an amalgam resulting from a process of fusion involving elements of the Bantu and Nagô nations, to which aspects of Candomblé are added.\nIt is characterized as a less orthodox branch of candomblé, forming an amalgam resulting from a fusion process that involves elements of the Bantu and Nagô cults, to which are added aspects of rural Catholicism, Umbanda and Kardecist spiritism.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nJarê is probably a term of Yoruba origin meaning “almost falling to the ground” or “cutting through”. Another possibility is that it is a corruption of “njale”, a word that referred to a ceremony performed by the inhabitants of present-day Nigeria and Benin. The term jarê is used both to designate religion in general and to refer to its various ritualistic occasions.\n\n\n== Emergence and development ==\nAt least in terms of evidence, it can be said that it emerged and consolidated in the interior of Bahia, specifically in the towns of Lençóis and Andaraí in the Chapada Diamantina region, in the mid-19th century. Its emergence is linked to the development of mining in this region, which was marked by a considerable influx of slave labor, an element that was compounded by the presence of Africans since the end of the 18th century in what is now the town of Andaraí, which at the time was a quilombo. From these towns, jarê spread to nearby areas that didn't have diamonds and were marked by peasant agriculture. This process of expansion led to changes in the way the cult was performed. As a result, it can be seen that the jarê in mining areas, performed by the mining population with origins marked by slavery, favored practices of worshipping entities that referred to African ancestry. On the other hand, its expansion into non-mining areas shows practices more closely linked to popular Catholicism, with an emphasis on healing rituals.\nReconstructing the history of the Nagôs and the emergence of the jarê depends largely on oral history accounts, since this religion of African origin was often confronted by the powers that be, suffering brutal police persecution and curtailment by the Catholic Church. It is not possible to guarantee that the current decline in the number of Jarê houses of worship is due to these factors, notwithstanding the socio-economic transformations that the region has undergone and which have affected many of its spheres. However, it is undeniable that in the fairly recent past the houses of worship at the headquarters of a single town like Lençóis could be counted in their dozens, while today there must be less than half that number, several of them buildings a few kilometers away from the town center. Despite all the difficulties encountered in keeping this religion alive, it is still possible to identify numerous jarê terreiros in the Chapada Diamantina, and it is possible to see that many followers continue to practice it.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nA religious practice developed mainly by enslaved and freed people - from the towns of Cachoeira and São Félix, both in the state of Bahia - who were brought to the Chapada Diamantina region as a result of mining activities, settling in towns such as Lençóis and Andaraí between the 18th and 19th centuries. This is where the so-called jarê de nagô cult began, in which the orixás, African deities, were worshipped exclusively. However, given the coexistence with descendants of indigenous people who inhabited the region, little by little certain entities representing indigenous culture were incorporated into the jarê, outlining its current form, which is therefore marked by Afro-indigenous cultural dialogues. In this circuit, it is a religious practice marked by the syncretism of different cultural elements, including aspects of African cults, Catholicism and Kardecist spiritism. Jarê is a term that covers a large number of beliefs, cults and rituals with diverse characteristics, developed according to the needs and convenience of the practitioners.\n\n\n=== Ceremonies ===\nIn general, the ritual procedures are known by large segments of the population and the festivities are attended by adults, young people and children. The duration of the ceremonies varies, but it is unusual for them to last less than five hours or more than ten hours in a row on the same day. They can last for more than a day, but at present it is not common for them to last for more than three consecutive days. In celebrations, people who are sensitive to receiving entities can receive (incorporate) several entities, so in a celebration with a large number of participants it is possible for up to a hundred different incorporations to take place.\n\n\n=== Trabalhos and revistas ===\nTrabalhos and revistas are the main activities carried out in a jarê terreiro.\nA revista (\"review\") is a private consultation in which the curador/pai-de santo (\"healer\") with his incorporated caboclo, identifies the nature and causes of the problem experienced by the patient and then proposes a treatment. It should be emphasized that a problem is not necessarily a physical illness, but in broader terms it also corresponds to a perceived state of distress. In Jarê cosmology, human beings interact with people, spirits and things over which they have no control and know very little, and are therefore in a constant state of vulnerability (corpo aberto). From this perspective, the illnesses and ailments that afflict people are seen as the result of the relationships they establish both with other people and with supernatural entities. The review is when the patient's trajectory is reviewed and aims to identify the causes of the problem that was generated by the web of relationships in which the patient is entangled, so healing corresponds to a redefinition of the context of interrelationships in which the patient is inscribed. Strengthening the patient is a kind of fechar de corpo (\"closing of the body\") that seeks to ensure a less vulnerable position in relation to the world and others. In addition to the possibility of treating an illness, the healer's main concern is to identify and characterize the conflicting relationships in which the patient is entangled, so the patient's narratives are essential in the review process in which he waits for the caboclo, through the healer, to specify what actions and events have led him to the situation in which he finds himself. From this perspective, the therapeutic meaning of the review is given.\nThe trabalho (\"work\"), on the other hand, is a healing ritual prescribed for one or more pacientes/clientes (\"patient/client\"), open to anyone who wants to witness it. It takes place at night and continues until dawn the next day. The trabalhos are festive gatherings attended by regular members of the terreiro as well as spectators who come to see the jarê.\n\n\n=== Pai-de-santo/Curador ===\nThe highest authority in the jarê is concentrated in the hands of the pai or mãe-de-santo, more popularly known as curadores, and it is worth noting that women rarely reach this position. It is believed that the caboclos force the individual to become a curador, causing them a series of misfortunes until they decide to accept their destiny. Thus, the career of curador is not seen as a choice, but as an obligation from which the individual cannot extricate himself. Healers are seen as mediators between the world of human beings and that of spirits, being possessed by entities to perform their therapeutic role. Their career begins when they start showing behavioral changes interpreted as signs of interference from the caboclos. By consulting a healer, the presence of spirits who demand that he become a healer himself can be confirmed. By accepting what is presented as a destiny (becoming a healer) your own problems will be solved. Refusing means prolonging the problems that brought you to the healer in the first place. On deciding to become a healer, the individual will undergo a healing ceremony and the seating of their guides, in which the pai-de-santo will grant them the authority to also exercise the function of jarê healer. From this perspective, becoming a healer is something pre-destined, it is assumed that the powers are granted to the healer, thus, in this conception, the pai-de-santo/healer does not need to go through a long process of formal apprenticeship between master and disciple, his condition of becoming a healer and carrying out his functions does not find shelter in the idea of progressive accumulation of knowledge - esoteric, magical, therapeutic - but rather in a destiny that has been imposed on him by superior forces that will lead him.\n\n\n=== Organization ===\nFunctions, rights and duties are distributed among the few individuals in the terreiro. The curador and his assistant are responsible for most of the terreiro's maintenance activities, and there is practically no bureaucratization. The Jarê cult presupposes a considerable margin of freedom of initiative and action, so it doesn't constitute a group with a complex internal organization, nor is it delimited by codes of conduct or a fixed and stable structure. This does not correspond to fragmentation and individualization, but rather to traits of an “open” religious practice, marked by the fluidity of beliefs and actions as a result of the specific socio-cultural experience of its participants.\n\n\n== Jarê in Brazilian literature ==\nReferences to the Jarê are found in the novel Crooked Plow, by Itamar Vieira Junior. Zeca Chapéu Grande, the narrators' father, works as a Jarê curador in his community and is sought out to cure ailments of the body and spirit with prayers and roots.\n\n\n== See also ==\nUmbanda\nCandomblé\nTambor de Mina\nQuimbanda\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 13th (Service) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers, (13th RF) was an infantry unit recruited as part of 'Kitchener's Army' in World War I. It served on the Western Front from July 1915 until the Armistice, seeing action at the Somme and the Ancre, at Arras and Ypres, against the German spring offensive, and in the final Hundred Days Offensive.\n\n\n== Recruitment and training ==\n\nOn 6 August 1914, less than 48 hours after Britain's declaration of war, Parliament sanctioned an increase of 500,000 men for the Regular British Army. The newly appointed Secretary of State for War, Earl Kitchener of Khartoum, issued his famous call to arms: 'Your King and Country Need You', urging the first 100,000 volunteers to come forward. Men flooded into the recruiting offices and the 'first hundred thousand' were enlisted within days. This group of six divisions with supporting arms became known as Kitchener's First New Army, or 'K1'. K2 and K3 followed shortly afterwards.\n13th (Service) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers, was formed as part of K3 at the Royal Fusiliers' regimental depot at Hounslow on 13 September 1914, under the command of Colonel F.P. Hutchinson of the Indian Army. It was designated as 'Army Troops', ie not assigned to a specific formation, but it was attached to 24th Division camped under canvas on the South Downs. By the time the K3 units were formed the shortage of uniforms, equipment and instructors for the Kitchener units had become critical. 24th Division did not receive its first khaki uniforms until March 1915. After the weather broke the troops were moved out of their camps and billeted in the local towns: 13th RF moved into Worthing in December 1914. It remained there until 9 April 1915, when it moved to Ludgershall, Wiltshire, to join 44th (later 37th) Division.\nAs authorised in March 1915, 37th Division consisted of Kitchener battalions that had originally been allocated as Army Troops to the New Armies. 13th Royal Fusiliers was assigned to 111th Brigade in the new division; the brigade also included 10th RF (Stockbrokers), 13th King's Royal Rifle Corps (KRRC), and 13th Rifle Brigade (RB). By April 1915 when the division was formed, all its units had been training for some months, and it was quickly assembled on Salisbury Plain for final battle training.\nOn 17 June Temporary Major Henry J. Des Voeux from the 7th Bn Northamptonshire Regiment (formerly of the Grenadier Guards) was promoted to Temporary Lieutenant-Colonel to command 13th RF. In July orders arrived for the division to move to France to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front. Embarkation began on 28 July and 13th RF landed at Boulogne two days later. By 2 August the division had completed its concentration around Tilques, near Saint-Omer.\n\n\n== Service ==\nOn arrival the units of 37th Division were attached to those of 12th (Eastern) Division for instruction in trench warfare in the quiet sector near Armentières. At the end of August 37 Division entrained for Doullens and then marched to Foncquevillers in the Somme sector, where the BEF was taking over more of the line from French troops. The battalions took turns in the front line, and there was a steady trickle of casualties. From 23 to 27 September during the Battle of Loos the division was stationed at La Cauchie to act as reserve for the French Tenth Army's attack, but then returned to Foncquevillers and the routine of trench holding alternating with billets in Souastre through the autumn and winter.\n\n\n=== Somme ===\nBy June 1916 13th RF had been in France almost a year and had still not participated in any major action, but the BEF was now preparing for that summer's 'Big Push' (the Battle of the Somme). The artillery bombardment began on 23 June and the assault was launched on 1 July. Initially, 37th Division was not involved. Then 111th Brigade was attached to 34th Division from 7 July as a temporary replacement for a brigade that had been shattered on the First day on the Somme. The fresh troops were immediately rushed to the front. At 02.00 on 7 July 13 RF was assembled in the old German front line in front of La Boisselle ready to attack between Ovillers and Contalmaison. It was warned not to attack until ordered to do so by brigade HQ, or until the flanking attacks were well ahead. By 08.25 the battalion had lost touch with brigade HQ, but the flanks had advanced so Maj Ardagh led off with Nos 1 and 2 Companies, with bombing sections covering the flanks. Due east of La Boisselle some resistance was encountered that held up No 2 Company, and by the time this was overcome the right flank had lost touch with the neighbouring brigade. Nevertheless, the battalion gained nearly 1,000 yards (910 m), occupying with little opposition its objective, a German trench running into the north end of Ovillers. During consolidation of this line some casualties were suffered from German artillery fire. Next day the battalion was ordered to push on to the next line. Captain Nelson took Nos 3 and 4 Companies on to this objective, stretching from the main Albert road to about 700 yards (640 m) west of Contalmaison. A small party pushed on ahead and suffered severely, but in two days the battalion had pushed the line forward materially, captured a battery of field artillery, several machine guns and nearly 200 prisoners for casualties that were moderate by the standards of the Somme: 1 officer and 20 other ranks (ORs) killed, 4 officers and 127 ORs wounded, and 13 missing.\nOn 10 July the rest of 111th Bde took over the left sector of 34th Division's front east of La Boisselle and continued pushing forward. The Battle of Bazentin Ridge was launched before dawn on 14 July: 112th Bde attacked Pozières at 08.30 the following morning (15 July), supported by 111th Bde. The attack was held up and although 10th RF of 111th Bde gave it new impetus it bogged down again. In the evening the attacking brigades fell back to the remaining trenches. 111th Brigade spent early August digging and wiring new trenches in the High Wood area, suffering casualties from enemy shellfire. It moved north by rail to Calonne-sur-la-Lys and rejoined 37th Division on 22 August. Lieutenant-Col Des Voeux was evacuated sick during the month.\n\n\n=== Ancre ===\nFor over  a month 13th RF and 13th RB shared a section of the line facing the coaltips of the Lens area, then on 17 October 37th Division marched back to the Somme, arriving at Puchevillers behind Albert on 22 October. Training here and at Hem-Hardinval was restricted by bad weather and the need to clear muddy roads. On 13 November 111th Bde moved up to the line and came under the command of 63rd (Royal Naval) Division for the Battle of the Ancre. Next day 10th RF mopped up a German redoubt that 63rd (RN) Division had bypassed the day before, then the rest of 111th Bde pushed on to Beaucourt, with 13th RF advancing between 13th KRRC and 13th RB. 13th RF set off a little too early and suffered casualties from its own barrage. It then fell back 50 yards (46 m) before resuming the advance under harassing machine gun fire from Beaucourt to the first objective, still ahead of the rest of the brigade. After an hour and a half more shelling on the final objective ('Muck Trench', so named from its muddy condition), 13th RF advanced with 13th KRRC and 7th RF (from 63rd (RN) Division) and took it without much opposition, though Lt-Col Ardagh was wounded. 37th Division took over command of the sector on 15 November and established strongpoints. On 18 and 19 November the rest of 111th Bde attempted to get forward to a group of trenches known as the 'Triangle', but was driven back by rifle fire. It was relieved from Muck Trench that night and returned to Puchevillers.\n37th Division marched northwards on 13 December, arriving in the trenches of the Neuve-Chapelle sector on 21 December. Here the battalions of 111th Bde began a routine of alternating trench duty with each other. In early February the brigade shifted to the Hulluch sector, and in early March it marched to the divisional training area at Roëllecourt, west of Arras, where it trained in snowy weather for the forthcoming Battle of Arras.\n\n\n=== Arras ===\nThird Army's objective for this attack was the village of Monchy-le-Preux on the high ground above the River Scarpe, and the operation was carefully rehearsed. The attack was to begin on 9 April after four days of bombardment, with the assaulting formations taking a succession of objectives, the Black, Blue and Brown lines. The fresh 37th Division waiting in the Arras suburbs would then pass through to capture the final (Green Line) objective, just beyond Monchy, but it was unclear whether this could be tackled on the first day. The assault went in at 05.30 and 13th RF reached Blangy at 11.30 without casualties. At 12.00 111th and 112th Bdes were ordered up to the Black Line, 13th RF being told at 13.10 to move forward and take up positions in 'Battery Valley' along the line of 'Fred's Wood', about 200 yards (180 m) north of the railway and east of Blangy. At about 18.45 the battalion crossed the Blue Line to move into position to begin the attack on Monchy. It now began to take casualties, and found that the Wancourt–Feuchy trenches (the Brown Line) in front were still untaken: there was no alternative but to capture this line first. By now the enemy had recovered from the initial shock of the assault, and the British field artillery was still moving up. The battalion advanced steadily about 2,000 yards (1,800 m) until it was brought to a halt just east of the Feuchy–Feuchy Chapel road. Here it formed a defensive flank and dug in at nightfall supported b y 13th RB; the opportunity to seize Monchy on the first day was lost. During the night the troops of 111th and 112th Bdes were disentangled from those of 12th (E) Division, and were ordered to carry out their attack next morning once the rest of the Wancourt–Feuchy trenches had been captured. 37th Division's other brigade (63rd) was already through the gap and holding 'Orange Hill', so it led the attack. 111th Brigade followed and launched its assault about 12.00, 13th RF crossing the northern slope of Orange Hill in a snowstorm and then swinging half-left towards the outlying woods west of Monchy. The brigade made ground rapidly despite the lack of field artillery support (although the heavy guns were bombarding Monchy). However, the machine gun fire from the village and from the north side of the river brought 10th and 13th RF to a halt about 500 yards (460 m) short of Monchy. An erroneous report that they were in Monchy led to the British cavalry being brought up to exploit a breakthrough, but they achieved nothing. By 19.40 13th RF only had three officers left beside the commanding officer and adjutant. After consultation with the Royal Engineers (REs), the battalion dug a provisional line of trenches west of the village, completing this line about 04.00 on 11 April. About an hour and a half later 13th and 10th RF made a final attempt on Monchy, this time with four tanks in support. Progress was slow, but 13th RF established itself north of the village and held the position all day, while the remnant of 10th RF stormed into the village itself about 11.00. The official historian described the capture of Monchy-le-Preux as 'one of the outstanding feats of the whole battle'. Although the remnant of 111th Bde was now weak, with very few officers, it was assisted in consolidating the village by 63rd Bde and the cavalry before it was relieved at 23.00 that night.\n\n111th Brigade returned to the front on 19 April in time for the Second Battle of the Scarpe, opening on 22 April. At Zero (04.45) 10th and 13th RF advanced with each company in four waves, closely following the Creeping barrage. The advance went to plan until the German second line trench was reached. 63rd Brigade on the right had edged too far left, and 13th RF on the left was a little slow coming forward, so the 10th RF was open to machine gun fire from the flanks. Once the confusion was sorted out, a patrol reported that the second objective, 'Cuba Trench', was unoccupied. The remnant of 10th RF occupied the trench by 09.30, and was followed in by 13th RF and 13th KRRC. Patrols made contact with the Germans along a road about 0.5 miles (0.80 km) ahead. After this success, the Germans bombarded Cuba Trench heavily, but 111th Bde consolidated it over the following days. At 04.25 on the morning of 28 April 13th RF and 13th RB carried out the next assault, on the 'Whip Crossroads' south-east of Gavrelle. 13th RB gained its objectives within two hours, then about 08.25 No 3 Company of 13th RF came up alongside, but could not contact any troops on the other (right) flank and a German machine gun was in action at the crossroads. By 10.15, however, the situation had been cleared up, with Nos 3 and 4 Companies, 13th RF, firmly holding the crossroads. This was the only part of the Battle of Arleux or Gavrelle that went to plan: later in the day 63rd Bde attacked across the battalion's front, having lost direction, and a number of Fusiliers got caught up with them, until recalled. The battalion was relieved on the night of 29 April.\n\n\n=== Ypres ===\nThe brigade continued line-holding in front of Arras during May, then on 23 June the battalions began a march north to the Ypres Salient, where 37th Division was to join Second Army for the forthcoming Ypres Offensive. The battalions went into the line south of Wyteschaete on 28 June, suffering a few casualties over following days from shellfire and patrolling. The offensive began with the Battle of Pilckem Ridge on 31 July, in which Second Army played a minor role, advancing its line slightly.\nThe brigade did further tours of duty in the front and reserve lines and provided working parties, suffering some casualties from Mustard gas shelling. On 30 September 13 RF was raided by the Germans at dawn. The battalion was astride the Menin Road, with an advanced outpost in a blockhouse near the western edge of Gheluvelt Wood. At 05.30 the enemy put down a heavy bombardment by Trench mortars on the whole position including the support lines. Ten minutes later the outpost, held by an officer and 10 ORs of No 2 Company, was attacked by about 300 Germans equipped with flamethrowers. After a fierce struggle the post was overrun, with all the garrison killed or captured. No 2 Company immediately put in a counter-attack and cleared the blockhouse of the enemy. The battalion's total casualties were 26 in a very short time. The Germans put in several more attacks on 1 and 3 October to disrupt preparations for the Battle of Broodseinde planned for 4 October, and continued heavy shelling in which No 1 Company was virtually wiped out and No 3 's carrying parties lost heavily. Afterwards the remainder of No 2 Company was divided between them. When the battalion went into action on 4 October its frontline strength was only 13 officers and 233 ORs. 111th Brigade's role in the battle was to form a defensive flank, with 13th RF swinging forward to seize some dugouts across the north of Gheluvelt Wood. The battalion was in position by 05.15, and at 05.30 the enemy brought down a heavy barrage, most of it luckily missing the battalion. Zero was at 06.00, and 13th RF followed its creeping barrage so closely that it avoided the prompt German counter-barrage. However, there was rifle and machine gun fire from a blockhouse and 'Lewis House' on the right, which had escaped the bombardment. 13th KRRC could do nothing against Lewis House, and as 13th RF swung forward it came more and more under its fire and had to dig in short of the objective. Of the 246 men who attacked, 208 had become casualties.\n\n\n=== Winter 1917–18 ===\n37th Division held the line in the Hollebeke and White Chateau sectors of the Salient, where raiding and gas attacks were common through the winter. By February 1918 the BEF was suffering a manpower crisis: each infantry brigade was reduced from four to three battalions, and the surplus battalions were broken up to provide reinforcements to others. This did not affect any of the battalions of 111th Bde, but three were disbanded from 112th Bde, and 13th RF was transferred on 4 February to help rebuild that formation. It was now brigaded with 6th Bedfordshire Regiment and 1st Essex Regiment. 13th RF received a draft of reinforcements from the disbanded 20th RF (3rd Public Schools).\nOn 6 March 111th Bde captured a prisoner who warned of an impending attack. It came at 06.30 on 8 March, when 13th RF was once more astride the Menin Road, with 13th KRRC of 111th Bde. The Germans shelled the trenches heavily, particularly those of 13th KRRC, which it attacked and occupied about 14.00. 10th RF and the rest of 111th Bde counter-attacked and restored the position by next morning. No attack had developed against 13th RF, but it had suffered heavily from the bombardments, particularly No 3 Company that lost all of its officers and was commanded by a sergeant. Platoons of Nos 2 and 4 Companies went up as reinforcements and the line was held intact. 13th RF lost 7 officers and 140 ORs in this unnamed action.\n\n\n=== German Spring Offensive ===\nThe Germans launched their Spring Offensive against Third and Fifth Armies on 21 March, achieving a near-breakthrough. Second Army was not attacked and quickly despatched reinforcements south to help stem the enemy advance. 37th Division went by rail on 28 March, arriving at Hébuterne next day and taking over part of the line on 31 March/1 April; 13th RF went into the front line at Bucquoy. The following morning the enemy tried to rush the bombing posts of No 2 Company but were beaten off. 37th Division came under determined attack on 5 April, the preliminary bombardment from 05.30 practically obliterating the trench positions of Nos 1 and 3 Companies. At 08.45 strong attacks were made on Nos 2 and 3 Companies, whose men were pressed back to their company HQs before a counter-attack restored the position. Neighbouring battalions did not do so well and 13th RF's left was uncovered, so the order was given to retire. The withdrawal of Nos 2 and 3 Companies was covered by the support platoon of No 1 Company, but the withdrawal uncovered the flank of No 1 Company in turn, and a desperate fight developed round Company HQ, which was partially blown in. By 14.00 the line was reorganised with  parties from several battalions and the brigade trench mortar battery, and the Germans did not attempt to press home their attack. Lieutenant-Col H.A. Smith was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his skilful handling of a crumbling position. This was the final day of the main offensive (the Battle of the Ancre (1918)), but intermittent shelling, raiding, and bombing by aircraft continued throughout April and May.\n\n\n=== Hundred Days Offensive ===\nThe Allies launched their Hundred Days Offensive on 8 August. On 19 August 37th Division moved up to take part in a dawn attack on 21 August at Ablainzevelle. At 04.55 the creeping barrage began, and 13th RF formed up and took its objective on the high ground between Bucquoy and Ablaineville for the loss of only 13 casualties. Two days later 37th Division attacked again at Achiet-le-Grand and Bihucourt with 111th and 112th Bdes. 13th RF on the left met opposition from a brickworks west of Achiet, but Capt Whitehead skilfully outflanked it with No 2 Company, capturing 60 prisoners and 11 light machine guns (he was awarded the DSO). No 3 Company on the right was met by intense fire from machine guns at the top of a railway embankment, which could not be located. However, laying down their own fire the company was able to work round and enfilade this position, one Lewis Gun team rushing forward to take the enemy in the rear. Although the members of this team were picked off one by one, they had so demoralised the enemy that opposition collapsed in the face of a final rush by the company. The dugouts in the adjacent railway cutting were taken one after another, and at least 400 prisoners were taken. The regimental historian described it as 'one of the greatest days experienced by the battalion'. Its work was not yet done: its right flank was still in the air and patrols went 1,000 yards (910 m) down the line without encountering any other troops. Nonetheless, 13th RF crossed the cutting and resumed its advance. Over 1000 prisoners passed through its collecting station that day, while its own casualties over the period 21–27 August were only about 200.\nThe enemy fell back during the night of 2/3 September, and Third Army followed up. On 4 September 13 RF attempted to carry on the pursuit from near Hermies to a line east of Havrincourt, but after only 200 yards (180 m) was held up by machine guns and trench mortars from the right flank. These were dealt with and the battalion advanced towards the bank of the Canal du Nord, which a platoon crossed at the corner of Havrincourt Wood. However, the 1/1st Hertfordshire Regiment on the right was still lagging and 13th RF was under enfilade fire, so it halted to let the Herts catch up, then advanced and set up its Lewis guns along the canal bank. The right flank was still open, so 13th RF withdrew its right company to a tunnel under the canal to form a flank guard. The battalion had gained 2,500 yards (2,300 m) in the day, and over the next two days its patrols pushed further forward.\n37th Division remained on the edge of Havrincourt Wood for the attacks on the Hindenburg Line, beginning on 12 September. On 18 September 13th RF was engaged in a minor action, launching an attack in a rainstorm. The attackers found that the artillery had failed to cut the enemy wire and destroy their bombing blocks. Although the battalion attacked three times it made no progress and had to return to its starting line. A German counter-attack was broken up before it became dangerous, and support from 111th Bde was not needed.\nThe Allies carried out a series of coordinated attacks along the Western Front on 26–29 September and on 5 October the enemy retreated again, going back to the Beaurevoir Line. 37th Division assaulted this line as part of the Battle of Cambrai on 8 October. 13th Royal Fusiliers' objective was  Hurtebise Farm, about 2 miles (3.2 km) north-west of Walincourt. The battalion had to fight its way to its starting line, because Bel Aise Farm and part of the Beaurevoir Line had still not been cleared, and it lost its creeping barrage. However, it then advanced so rapidly that it was within half a mile of its objective before the barrage had suppressed the enemy machine guns on the high ground south of the farm. Nonetheless, Nos 2 and 3 Companies pushed straight on and began to consolidate on their final position by 07.15. However, enemy fire compelled them to withdraw from the south and east sides of the farm until 1/1st Herts passed through to take the next objective. 37th Division's advance now became a pursuit of the beaten enemy to the River Selle. Next day 13th RF followed 1/1st Herts to Ligny-en-Cambrésis and established a line there without opposition. On 10 October 13th RF advanced behind a creeping barrage at 05.20 to establish strongpoints south and east of Caudry, thereby cutting off the town. Most of the opposition came from British tanks and artillery, which did not expect friendly troops to be so far forward. Finding no enemy in front, No 3 Company pushed forward and captured Bethencourt, throwing out a line of outposts to the east overlooking the Selle. The battalion also liberated Caudry, to the delight of some 500 French inhabitants. In three days the battalion had advanced a considerable distance, captured 200 prisoners and 20 machine guns, at a cost of 112 casualties.\nThe battalion was back in the line on 24 October for the third day of the BEF's next set-piece attack, the Battle of the Selle. After 10th RF had cleared the ground as far as Salesches the day before, 13th RF attacked to the north. Some casualties and confusion were caused by the enemy bombardment as the troops passed through 111th Bde and formed up in the dark, but the battalion advanced at 04.00, with No 3 Company and two platoons of No 2 forming a defensive flank against the enemy still holding the high ground south-west of Salesches station. Shortly after 05.30 No 4 Company was held up by uncut wire, but the advance resumed at 07.00 and two platoons crossed the Écaillon river, wading across west of Ghissignies, where it captured some prisoners. East of Ghissignies the advance encountered heavy fire from a fortified chapel, the leading platoon of No 1 Company being wiped out. The left company was reduced to 40 men and had to be withdrawn to the cover of an orchard, and No 1 Company pulled back to consolidate a line in front of the village by 18.00. Next day 13th RF attempted to advance again, but was held up near De Beart Farm; the battalion was relieved at 21.00. It had advanced nearly 5,000 yards (4,600 m), capturing 120 prisoners and numerous guns and trench mortars, but it had lost another 108 men, and was now reduced to 11 officers and 269 ORs.\nThe next operation was the Battle of the Sambre. 111th Brigade led off for 37th Division, though 13th RF was already under machine gun fire at 07.35 in Ghissignies while waiting to pass through. Later the battalion had to wait outside Louvignies while 111th Bde completed its capture and 1st Essex came up to lead 112th Bde's attack at 09.40. 13th RF helped the Essex to mop up Jolimetz, and to reduce a machine gun pocket south-west of the village. This took the division to its Red Line, an advance of about 3,000 yards (2,700 m). Then at 15.45, with darkness already approaching, 13th RF took over the lead, plunging into the Forêt de Mormal. With thick undergrowth and spasmodic machine gun fire coming down the railway, the weak battalion made slow progress. By 18.00 it had four platoons at the crossroads by the railway, destroying a machine gun team and establishing a strongpoint. It then threw out outposts to contact 8th Somerset Light Infantry to the south-west. No 9 Platoon under Sergeant W. Green, however, was out of contact, having pushed on through the wood in darkness until it reached a road junction at the edge of the woods, 1,000 yards (910 m) in front of the rest of the battalion. Green and his men, completely isolated, dug in and threw out patrols, finding neither friend nor foe, until 5th Division passed through to continue the advance next morning. (Green was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal (DCM).)\n13th Royal Fusiliers had fought its last battle; after 5th Division took over on 5 November, 37th concentrated in billets. On 11 November the division moved back to Caudry, and during the march the men were told that the Armistice with Germany had come into force at 11.00, bringing hostilities to an end.\n\n\n=== Postwar ===\nThe units of 37th Division were now employed in training, education and recreation. On 1 December they began a long move to an area north of Charleroi, but from 2 to 14 December were billeted north of Le Quesnoy in bad weather until the march could resume. On 20 December the division settled into its final billets near Charleroi. Demobilisation began in December. Remaining duties included guarding the supply railhead at Rœux. 37th Division ceased to exist  on 25 March 1919 and the cadre of the battalion returned to the UK. It was disbanded on 17 May at Glencorse Barracks, near Edinburgh.\n\n\n== Memorials ==\nThe Royal Fusiliers War Memorial, with its bronze figure of a Fusilier sculpted by Albert Toft, stands at Holborn Bar on the boundary of the City of London. A panel on the back of the pedestal lists all the RF battalions.\nThe 37th Division memorial sculpted by Lady Feodora Gleichen (sister of the division's first commander) was erected at Monchy-le-Preux.\n\n\n== Insignia ==\nIn addition to the Royal Fusiliers' cap badge and brass shoulder-title, men of 13th RF wore 37th Division's gold horseshoe on the upper arm. In 1917–18 37th Division adopted a system of 'battle patches' on the upper arm to identify individual units and subunits. As the second battalion of its brigade, 13th RF would have worn a coloured rectangle; for 111th Bde this was dark blue. Beneath the rectangle was a horizontal bar: red for A Company, dark blue for B, purple for C and green for D. As the senior battalion of 112th Bde from February 1918 13th RF would have adopted a red disc in place of the blue rectangle.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sechen Khan, also spelled Setsen Khan (Mongolian: ᠰᠡᠴᠡᠨ ᠬᠠᠨ; Cyrillic: Сэцэн хан; Chinese: 車臣汗), refers to the territory as well as the Chingizid dynastic rulers of the Secen Khanate. It was one of four Khalka khanates that emerged from remnants of the Mongol Empire after the death of Dayan Khan's son Gersenji Khongtaiji in 1549.\nThe first Sechen Khan Sholoi was a gread-grand son of Gersenji Khongtaiji. In the early 1630s, the 5th Dalai Lama bestowed on him the title of \"Gegeen Setsen Khan\" (Гэгээн сэцэн хан).\nIn 1688, Ömkhei, the 4th Sechen Khan fled to Xilingol where he pledged fealty to the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing China in return for protection against the invading Dzungar Mongolian forces under Galdan Boshugtu Khan. On 3 June 1691, Ömkhei attended the Dolonnuur Assembly together with Tusheet Khan, Zasagt Khan and more than 500 noyans and taijis. Since then, the Khalkha Mongols in Outer Mongolia submitted to the Qing dynasty. The three khanates, Sechen Khan, Tüsheet Khan and Zasagt Khan, became three provincial subdivisions or aimags of Qing China. In the next year, Khalka was divided into three zams (зам), the area of Sechen Khan aimag was named \"Khalka Left Zam\" (Mongolian: Халхын зүүн зам, Chinese: 喀爾喀東路). In 1725, Qing China created a fourth aimag, Sain Noyon. In 1923, following the Mongolian Revolution of 1921, the Sechen Khan aimag was renamed Khan Khentii Uulyn aimag (Хан Хэнтий уулын аймаг), which named after the Khan Khentii Mountain. In 1930, the four aimags were divided into the present day 21 smaller aimags, which were subdivided into sums.\n\n\n== Sechen Khans ==\nSholoi (1627–1652), son of Morbuim, succeeded his brother Khar Zagal in 1627.

        "content": "Cocaine, Prison & Likes: Isabelle's True Story (French: Cocaïne, prison & likes : la vraie histoire d'Isabelle) is a Canadian documentary television series, which premiered in 2022 on Crave. The film profiles Isabelle Lagacé, a Canadian woman who spent several years in prison in Australia after being caught on a cruise ship in 2016 with more than 30 kilograms of cocaine hidden in her room; Lagacé and her friend and travel companion Mélina Roberge, who was also arrested and imprisoned, had been recruited into the scheme by a professional drug smuggler, and agreed to participate because the cruise offered them an opportunity to build their brands as social media influencers by posting glamorous content from around the world.\nRoberge did not participate in the film, instead telling her version of the story in her book Sans filtre, which was published earlier in the same year.\nProduced by Urbania and Connect3 and directed by Sébastien Trahan, the series production was announced in July 2022. The series was released in both English and French versions, premiering on Crave in December 2022.\nThe series received a Canadian Screen Award nomination for Best Factual Series at the 12th Canadian Screen Awards in 2024.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCocaine, Prison & Likes: Isabelle's True Story at IMDb",

Parris is a compelling lead with a distinguishably demanding personality and a committed performance, but it is Constance Shulman who stole the show for me. Her experience as an actress is clear as the stubbornness of her character reaches beyond the screen. I was simultaneously annoyed with her character and impressed by her performance.\" Norman Gidney from the HorrorBuzz gave in 6 out of 10 stars and also noted Shulman's performance as mother and Laplante and Moon for creative ideas.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDarla in Space at IMDb",

        "content": "William Miles Chick (August 31, 1794 – April 7, 1847) is an American businessman and pioneer, who was one of the earliest settlers and the first postmaster of Kansas City, Missouri.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nChick was born on a tobacco farm near Lynchburg, Virginia, on August 31, 1794. He grew up working on the farm, and worked as a merchant in Alexandria. He served in the War of 1812, reaching the rank of colonel, but never fought a battle. In 1816, he married Ann Eliza Smith, having 8 children.\n\n\n== Kansas City ==\nIn 1822, Chick moved to Missouri and built a farm. When the Missouri River flooded in 1826, their farm was destroyed. He then moved to Howard County and spent a decade farming tobacco. In 1836, he moved to Kansas City and bought a 2-story log cabin from John Calvin McCoy. There, he operated a general store.\nIn 1838, he and a group of investors founded the Town of Kansas. In 1843, he opened a riverfront warehouse to store fur.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nIn 1845, Chick became the first postmaster of Kansas City, serving until his death of pneumonia on April 7, 1847. After his death, his son Washington Henry Chick became the second postmaster of Kansas City.\nOne of Chick's daughter's, Virginia Christiana Chick, married John Calvin McCoy on January 23, 1838. Another daughter, Martha Matilda Chick, married Nathan Scarritt in 1850. Their child and his grandson, William Chick Scarritt—who was named after him, was a prominent lawyer and owner of the William Chick Scarritt House. His daughter and Chick's great-granddaughter was Dorothy McKibbin, a manager of the Manhattan Project.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Kuki-Karbi conflict is an ethnic conflict between the Kuki people and Karbi people in the Karbi Anglong district of Assam, India. The conflict has its roots in disputes over land, resources and political representation between the two groups.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Karbi Anglong district is home to several ethnic groups including the majority Karbi tribe as well as Kuki tribes like the Thadou and Hmar. The Karbi Anglong district has been aspiring for an autonomous state status since 1986, represented by the Autonomous State Demand Committee (ASDC). The Kuki population, initially numbering 15 in the 1951 census, rose to 2,914 in 1961. By 1971, it reached 21,034 in Assam, but then decreased to 21,883 by 1991, suggesting a pattern of inward migration followed by outward migration. The Apex Kuki organization in Karbi Anglong, the Kuki National Assembly (KNA), was also seeking the establishment of an autonomous regional council for the Kuki people, who primarily reside in the Singhasan Hills region.This growth is seen as a potential challenge to the Karbi groups' aspirations. Tensions between the two groups have existed for decades, fueled by competition for land, political power and resources in the district.\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, the conflict escalated into violence between militant groups representing the two communities. The United People's Democratic Solidarity(UPDS), a Karbi militant group, clashed with the Kuki Revolutionary Army (KRA), a Kuki militant outfit based in Manipur.\n\n\n== 2002-2004 Clashes ==\nThe most intense phase of the conflict occurred between October 2003 and March 2004. During this period, the KRA and the anti-talks faction of the UPDS killed an estimated 85 people, mostly men, in Karbi Anglong. The casualties included at least 23 Kukis and 54 Karbis. Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi today requested Delhi to ban the Kuki Revolutionary Army (KRA), saying the militant group was “behind much of the violence” in Karbi Anglong district.\nIn March 2004, the violence reached its peak. On March 24, the KRA killed 34 Karbi tribals in separate incidents in the villages of Udentisu, Tarak Teron and Jari Teron. Five more Karbis were killed in various villages on March 27. The KRA claimed it was retaliating to the killing of six Kukis by the UPDS on March 19.The March 24 incident resulted in the highest civilian casualty in a single day in Assam. It was also the largest civilian casualty in Karbi Anglong since the pro-talks UPDS faction signed a ceasefire agreement with the Indian government in 2002.\n\n\n== Causes and Consequences ==\nThe conflict is driven by several factors including competition for land and resources, political representation, and the activities of militant groups. According to then Assam's chief minister, Tarun Gogoi, the KRA, a militant group from Manipur, believed to be responsible for the majority of recent clashes in the district. He had asked Delhi to ban the Kuki Revolutionary Army (KRA) due to their involvement in the violence in Karbi Anglong district. The UPDS, formed by the merger of the Karbi National Volunteers and Karbi People's Front in 1999, aimed to drive out non-Karbi populations from Karbi Anglong. This threatened the Kuki community.The violence has had a devastating impact on the local population. Hundreds of people have been killed, thousands displaced, and villages destroyed. The conflict has also hindered development in the district.\n\n\n== Attempts at Resolution ==\nSeveral attempts have been made to resolve the conflict. The Indian Army was deployed to Karbi Anglong to control the violence. The government also initiated peace talks with the UPDS, leading to a ceasefire agreement in 2002. However, the anti-talks faction of the UPDS continued to engage in violence. The conflict remains unresolved fully, with sporadic incidents of violence continuing to occur in Karbi Anglong.\n\n\n== See also ==\nKuki-Naga conflict in Manipur\nKuki–Paite Conflict\n2023 Manipur violence\n\n\n== References ==",

He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Nebraska in 1964, where he was a scholastic-American football player. He later obtained an MBA degree from Creighton University in 1972.\n\n\n== Career ==\nCallahan's career began as a telephone lineworker before rising up through the ranks in telephone companies where he held positions in operations, marketing, commercial, and regulatory affairs. He held several senior management positions including president of US West's International division, where he oversaw dozens of companies providing services in 18 different countries. He managed this division from a London office.\nAfter leaving US West in 1996, he launched his own holding company, Callahan Associates International LLC (CAI), which acquired various cable and wireless operators internationally. With financial backing from GE Capital, Bank of America, and Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, CAI acquired a 55% share of Deutsche Telekom's \"ish\" brand cable operations in North Rhine-Westphalia, shortly after picking up ONO, a Spanish cable TV operator. Callahan's team also purchased Telenet, Belgium's largest cable provider and a system that Callahan had developed while at US West, valued at $969 million at the time.\n\n\n== References ==",

The shell shows delicate striations, while its suture bears a slight impression. Across its six whorls, there's a gradual increase, culminating in a slender body whorl with a faintly angled periphery. Its peristome, expanding gracefully, presents a striking contrast in white.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nThis species occurs in China, Guangxi province.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nYen, T.-C. (1939).

The second season will expand its focus to include indigenous communities in the United States.\nThe series received a Canadian Screen Award nomination for Best Factual Series at the 12th Canadian Screen Awards in 2024.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLittle Big Community at IMDb",

The French government also uses the Shanghai ranking as its national ranking for French universities and Grandes écoles.\nOnly Le Figaro, Le Parisien and L'Étudiant, based on figures from the French government's two national higher education access platforms Parcoursup and MonMaster, rank the best bachelor's (Licence) and master's degrees according to completion rates. Le Figaro and L'Étudiant also produce an annual ranking of the best Grandes écoles in business and engineering, which are only accessible on the basis of a highly selective competitive examination.\nFrance's Universities also rank highly in global university rankings with 5 French Universities ranking in the top 100 of the three major global rankings: QS World University Rankings, Times Higher Education World University Rankings and Academic Ranking of World Universities.\n\n\n== French Universities and Grandes écoles in global rankings ==\nThe following universities and Grandes écoles rank in the top 100 in at least two global rankings:\n\nNotes:\na Number of times the university is ranked within the top 100 of one of the three global rankings.\nb The university is ranked within the top 50 of all three global rankings.\n\n\n== French Universities and Grandes écoles in national rankings ==\nThe following rankings of French universities and Grandes écoles are produced annually:\n\n\n=== National rankings of universities and Grandes Écoles by academic major ===\n\n\n==== Law ====\n\n\n===== Le Figaro Law School ranking =====\nLe Figaro's ranking uses eight different criteria, including selectivity on the Parcoursup national platform, the proportion of stable jobs, the median net monthly salary after a master's degree in law, and the number of university PhDs admitted to the agrégation competitive examination in law.\n\n\n==== Management ====\n\n\n==== Psychology ====\n\n\n==== Engineering ====\n\n\n==== Politics ====\n\n\n===== Challenges Institutes of political sciences ranking =====\n\n\n=== National undergraduate university rankings by completion rate ===\n\n\n=== National university graduate rankings by completion rate ===\n\n\n== Criticism ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLe Figaro Universités\nLe Figaro Masters in Management Ranking\nLe Figaro Graduate Engineering Schools Ranking\nGlobal University Rankings: France\nL'Étudiant Rankings\nL'Étudiant Masters Rankings\nL'Étudiant Masters in Management Ranking",

        "content": "County Hall is a municipal building in Church Close in Boston, a town in Lincolnshire, in England. It served as the offices and meeting place of Holland County Council.\n\n\n== History ==\nFollowing the implementation of the Local Government Act 1888, which established county councils in every county, The county council of the Parts of Holland secured accommodation in the Sessions House in Boston. After finding that arrangement unsatisfactory, county leaders decided to commission dedicated offices. The site they selected was on the east side of the square off Church Close where some older buildings had once stood.\nThe new building was designed in the Gothic revival style, built in ashlar stone and was completed in 1927. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage of 11 bays facing onto the square. The central section of three bays was projected forward to form a full height porte-cochère. There were three arches with hood moulds on the ground floor, an oriel window in the central bay on the first floor, and an observation window with a ballustraded parapet and finials above. The rest of the building was fenestrated by mullioned and transomed windows. The roofline was lightly castellated and, internally, the principal room was the council chamber.\nA four-storey building designed in the modern style and known as the County Hall Annex was erected to the north of county hall in the mid-20th century. The Holland County Council was abolished when the newly formed Lincolnshire County Council was formed at the County Offices in Lincoln in 1974. The local public library service subsequently relocated to county hall.\nIn 2016, developers, Paul and Amy Wilkinson took possession of the whole site (including the sessions hall, county hall and county hall annex) with a view to converting the buildings for alternative use. The public library continued to operate on the ground floor of county hall but the upper floors were converted to create the County Hall Business Centre with 19 business units. The ground floor of the annex was subsequently converted for retail use and was re-opened by the boxer, Callum Johnson, as Waterfall Plaza in December 2016. The upper floors of the annex were converted for use as an apartment hotel and reopened as such in summer 2017.\nMeanwhile, in county hall, the library was closed for five weeks in April 2023 to allow alterations to be made to the building: the alteration work involved creating a dedicated library entrance at the back of the building in Bank Street so that a substantial part of the building could also be converted for use as a hotel.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "St Giles' Church, Northampton is a Church of England parish church in Northampton, within the Diocese of Peterborough. The church is a Grade I listed building.\nThe oldest fabric is probably 12th century but the church had a thorough Victorian restoration. The tall crossing tower is 12th century but the upper stages were rebuilt in 1616 after a collapse, and the top was renewed in 1914. The 12th-century west doorway has been reset and restored. The chancel is probably 12th century but later widened, with remains of 13th-century lancet windows. The pulpit is Jacobean. The stained glass in the East window (1878) is by Clayton and Bell.\nThe Victorian restoration by Edmund Francis Law was based on the 1840 report of George Gilbert Scott whose brother was curate. Law's restoration included an outer north aisle and west end rebuilding with porches, 1853–55. The chancel was restored in 1876.\nThere is a 15th-century Paynell-Gobion alabaster table tomb and good 17th- and 18th-century wall monuments. James Keill (died 1719) was buried in St Giles', where a monument, with a Latin inscription, was erected. The monument (1743) to Samuel Pennington is by John Hunt. Robert Browne (died 1633) was buried in the churchyard where his monument stands by the south door.\n\n\n== Patronage ==\nSince 1833, when the Rev. Edward Watkin sold the advowson, the patronage has been held by the Simeon trustees, a body with the purpose of acquiring church patronage to perpetuate evangelical Anglican clergy in Church of England parishes.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGrade I listed buildings in Northamptonshire\nList of churches in Northampton\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nA History of the Church of St. Giles, Northampton (1911) by Robert Meyricke Serjeantson",

        "content": "Fiona Muir (formerly Muir-Harvey)[1] was born 1955/56 in the ‘central belt’ of Scotland. Muir attended Aberdeen University and obtained a Law degree having studied 13 subjects. [2]\nMuir has been publicly likened to the character Martha of the Netflix show Baby Reindeer. Written by and starring  Richard Gadd, the show is based on his as own experiences of sexual assault and stalking.\nSince the show aired, fans have unearthed an article published in January 2000 by the Scottish Daily Record and Sunday Mail citing Fiona Harvey as having stalked and harassed Laura Wray, wife of MP Jimmy Wray, and the hate campaign Harvey pursued after she was terminated from her position at McPhail Lawrence Partnership in 1997. [3]  Another article published April 2002 cites the late MP Jimmy Wray spoke to the same paper about social workers visiting his home to investigate claims that they had beaten their four-year-old son. The couple claimed to have received threats to their safety after Harvey - 36 at the time - was dismissed from Laura's former law firm. [4]  When speaking to the paper again in March 2004, Jimmy Wray briefly re-visited the stalking of his wife Laura by former employee Fiona Harvey - mentioning a legal restraining order they received against her.[5]\nIn an interview with Piers Morgan in May 2024, Muir denies harassing or stalking the former MP or his wife, Laura Wray. Muir claims to have received harassment and death threats since the Netflix show aired. In the interview, Muir confirms that met Gadd in the Hawley Arms pub in Camden and - whilst acknowledging some platonic correspondence between the two - denies any communication to the extent or at the scale of that depicted in the show.[6]\nMuir claimed to be considering legal action against Gadd and Netflix for the portrayal of the Martha character, along with the Daily Mail.[7]  At present, no publicly available information confirms that Gadd’s claims of stalking, harassment and imprisonment made in the show pertain to Muir.",

        "content": "Abhiras of Bhambhagiri were an ruiling branch of Abhiras in Khandesh; who were contemporary to Seunas of Devgiri. Bhambhagiri is identified with modern Bhamer in Pimpalner taluk of Western Khandesh. The Markandeya Purana and Jain literature interestingly describe Khandesh region as Abhiradesa. The rule of the Abhiras over this region is not only evident from the epigraphs but from the oral traditions also. \n\n\n== History ==\nThe only well known king of this dynasty namely, Lakṣmīdēva is mentioned in Purshottampuri Plates of Ramchandra. P.K. Gode on the identification of Bhambhagiri writes that; It is a well-known fact in the annals of the Mediaeval History of the Deccan that there were several minor feudatory families ruiling in Khandesh during the Yādava period. Some of them are known by the general name Ābhiras, about whom there are several traditions current in Khandesh. Singhana, the great Yādava King, is said to have defeated several Ābhiras, one of which was a family from Bhambhagiri. His victory over one Laxmi-Deva, the Lord of Bhambhagiri, is mentioned in the Āmber inscription of his general Kholesvara. In the Vrata-Khand of Hemādri; the name of this prince is given as Laxmi-dhara. The defeat of the Lord of Bhambhagiri is also attributed to Singhana in the Paithan Plates of Yadava Ramcandra. Even though there was no possibility of identifying the place Bhambhagiri from the isolated mention of it in these inscriptions. V.V. Mirashi has recently suggested that it is probably identical with Bhamer, a village 4 miles to the south of the Nizampur, in the Pimpalner Taluk of the West Khandesh district. The Government Epigraphist for India gas supplied hom with an inked estampage of a stone inscription preserved in the Manyar's Mosque at Nandurbār in West Khandesh. The record refers itself to the reign of Lakshmi-deva, who is described as \"Bhambhagiri Mahā-Mandaleśvara\" and who had obtained a boon from the god Vaidyanath, among several other birudas. This inscription is dated on the 8th day in the bright half of the month of Caitra, in Samvat 1269, which date taking the year to be Karttikadi, regularly corresponds with Sunday, 31 March A.D. 1213. From the birudas of the prince Laxmideva of this inscription it is clear that he belongs to the same house of the Ābhiras of Bhambhagiri, described as defeated by Yadava Singhana and as pointed above. From the date of the inscription it appears likely that the house of the Ābhiras of Bhambhagiri continued to rule in Khandesh even after the defeat of Laxmidhara by Singhana, probably under the vassalage of the Later Yadavas of Devagiri. Elsewhere he have also tried to show that a king named Krṣna, possibly belonging to this house, is mentioned in the Saka 1106 inscription carved on the lintel of a matha at Balsane, in the vicinity of Bhāmer.\n\n\n== Rulers ==\nThe only known (from Āmbē inscription No.2, Balasane inscription and Rudrakavi's Great Poem of the Dynasty of Rāṣṭrauḍha) rulers of this dynasty are:\n\nLakṣmīdēva alias Lakṣmidhara\nKrṣna\nJagarīkadeva\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nSaying of the current traditions, a tradition of Nandurbar (Khandesh) presents before us an interesting account of an Ahir Raja Nanda, who fought the Turks.\nToday the Ahirs (descendants of these Ābhīras) of Khandesh are said to be of seven sub-divisions of which five are known namely, Gválbansi, Bhárvathiya, Dhidhamvar, Ghosi and Gujar.\n\n\n== References ==",

Beginning in 1614, Christianity was banned in Japan and a smuggling incident concerning two foreign missionaries prompted the killing. The mass execution was part of the persecution of Christians in Japan by Tokugawa Hidetada, the second Shogun of the Tokugawa shogunate.  \n\n\n== Name ==\nThe name \"Great Genna Martyrdom\" relates to the Japanese era name of Genna, which denotes the time from July 1615 until February 1624. The mass killing is also known as the Great Martyrdom of Nagasaki.\n\n\n== Background and execution ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nA nationwide ban on Christianity was promulgated in 1614 during the shogunate of Tokugawa Hidetada. In Nagasaki, several measures were taken to implement this ban. Tronu Montane, a scholar at the Kansai Gaidai University described these measures as a \"straightforward policy of elimination of Christians that had a dramatic impact on Nagasaki Christian community\".\nAfter the death of Tokugawa Ieyasu – the first Shogun of the Tokugawa shogunate – in 1616, the persecution of Christians in Japan focused on the promotion of apostasy and the elimination of foreign missionaries. This policy was implemented in Nagasaki by Gonroku, the bugyō from 1615 to 1625.\nLarge-scale executions were not uncommon parts of this policy of Christian elimination: 23 Christians had been concurrently executed in Edo (Tokyo) in August 1613; 43 in Kuchinotsu, Arima, in November 1614; and 53 in Kyoto in 1619.\n\n\n=== Execution ===\nThe Great Genna Martyrdom was preceded by an incident with the Christian Japanese Merchant Hirayama Jōchin, who had received an official seal to trade with Manila. In 1620, Hirayama tried to smuggle two Mendicant priests disguised as merchants (Pedro de Zúñiga and Luis Flores) on his way back from Manila into Japan, but before they could enter Japanese territory, his ship was attacked by Dutch and the English forces and its cargo was confiscated. The crew of the ship, including the priests, were imprisoned in Hirato.\nHirayama claimed that his official seal should grant his ship protection; the Dutch and English, however, argued that the presence of priests forfeited this protection. After two years of imprisonment, the priests confessed that they were indeed Christian missionaries. This confession resulted in the burning alive of the two priests and Hirayama as well as the decapitation of the remaining crew in Nagasaki on 19 August 1622.\nDue to this smuggling incident, the prosecution of Christians was intensified and the bugyō Gonroku ordered the killing of all priests currently imprisoned in the Nagasaki and Ōmura prisons as well as some of their followers. In total, 55 Christians were to be executed.\nThe execution of these 55 Christians, now known as the Great Genna Martyrdom, occurred on 10 September 1622 on Nishizaka Hill in Nagasaki.\nAn early account of the execution is provided in a 1624 pamphlet by Andres de Parra printed in Madrid. The pamphlet in Spanish is titled Relacion breve de los grandes y rigurosos martirios que el año passado de 1622. dieron en el Iapon a ciento y diez y ocho illustrissimos Martyres, sacada principalmente de las cartas de los Padres de la Compañia de Iesus que alli residen: y de lo que han referido muchas personas de aquel Reyno, que en dos nauios llegaron a la ciudad de Manila a 12. de Agosto de 1623 ('A Brief Account of the Great and Rigorous Martyrdoms which Last Year, 1622, Were Inflicted in Japan on One Hundred and Eighteen Illustrious Martyrs, Drawn Principally From the Letters of the Fathers of the Society of Jesus Who Reside There, and From What Has Been Reported by Many Persons of that Kingdom, Who Arrived in Two Ships at the City of Manila on 12 August 1623'). The pamphlet was translated in part into English in 1927.\nThe Imago primi saeculi, a 1640 book about the Society of Jesus, contains a description of the Great Genna Martyrdom:\n\nTo make the punishment longer and more cruel, the fire was six cubits away from the (martyr’s) body. The arms were lightly bound to the posts, and [the restraints] were tied loosely. And they were made so that they were not difficult to untie. Those who did not dare to endure the punishment could escape if they wanted to. But there was not one of them who did not look to the heavens with his eyes, not one who did not endure the fire without moving his heart and body, even though the wood was burning strongly around them.\nWhile this account implies that the condemned in principle could have untied their restraints, this would not have resulted in them being able to flee. Condemned who untied their restrains and attempted to flee would have been captured by the executioners and thrown into the flames again.\n\n\n== List of the martyrs ==\nDuring the Great Genna Martyrdom, 55 people were executed. Of them, 24 or 25 were burned, while 30 or 31 were beheaded.\n\n\n=== Burned Christians ===\nThe 24 or 25 people executed by burning consisted of two Jesuit priests, eight Jesuit irmãos, two Franciscan priests, five Dominican priests, two Dominican irmãos, two lay members of the Fraternity of the Rosary and three lay catechists.\n\n\n=== Beheaded Christians ===\nThe 30 or 31 people executed by beheading were lay Kirishitans, numbering 27 Japanese and four Koreans. Five of those killed were children aged 3 to 12 years old.\n\n\n=== Names and affiliations of those killed ===\n\n\n==== Dominicans ====\nThe Dominicans killed included Angelo Orsucci also known as Angel Ferrer Orsucci (b. 1573), Jacinto Orfanell (b. 1578), José Salvanés de San Jacinto (b. 1580), Alfonso de Mena (b. 1578), Francisco de Morales (b. 1567), Juan Nagata Magoshiro and Tomás del Rosario as well as three Japanese men admitted to the Third Order of Saint Dominic: Diego Chinba, Domingo Tanda and Paulo Nagaishi.\n\n\n==== Franciscans ====\nThe Franciscans killed included Fray Vicente de San José (b. 1597) also known as Vicente Ramíre, Ricardo de Santa Ana (b. 1585), Pedro de Ávila (b. 1591) and León Satzuma.\n\n\n==== Jesuits ====\nThe Jesuits killed included the Jesuit missionary Charles Spinola, as well as nine Japanese Jesuits: Antonia Sanga, Sébastien Kimura, Antonio Kyūni, Pedro Sanpō, Gonzalo Fusai Chōzō, Miguel Satō Shunpō, Tomé Akahoshi, Luis Kawara Rokuemon and Juan Chūgoku.\n\n\n== Beatification ==\nAll 55 executed Christians were beatified by Pope Pius IX as part of the beatification of the 205 Martyrs of Japan in 1867.\n\n\n== See also ==\n205 Martyrs of Japan\n26 Martyrs of Japan – A separate martyrdom in 1597\nTwenty-Six Martyrs Museum and Monument – A museum for the 1597 martyrdom\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nHigashibaba, Ikuo (2001). \"Apostasy, Underground Practice, or Martyrdom\".

Augusto Montenegro replaced governor Paes de Carvalho.\nThe governor abolished the Conservatório de Música Instituto Carlos Gomes, by decree, dismissing the director and all teachers, in 1908, saying he had to cut expenses. The Conservatory had been in operation since 1895 (about 13 years).\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nIn his honor, Augusto Montenegro was the name given to the highway that, from Av. Almirante Barroso, at the junction, in Belém, leads to the district of Icoaraci, due to the expansion of the municipality, being one of its busiest roads.\nA large mansion was built in his name in 1903, it is now one of numerous structures built in Belém in the eclecticism during the Amazonian \"rubber cycle\" in the early 20th century. The mansion now houses the Museum of the Federal University of Pará. It was listed as a historic structure by the Department of Historic, Artistic and Cultural Heritage of Pará in 2002.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "American Standard is the third and final album by the American band Mary's Danish, released in 1992. The band supported the album by participating in a Rock the Vote tour, following it with a tour with the Darling Buds. \"Leave It Alone\" peaked at No. 20 on Billboard's Modern Rock Tracks chart.\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe album was produced primarily by Peter Asher, who also served as the band's manager. Niko Bolas engineered and assisted with the production. It was recorded in 10 days at Skywalker Sound. All six bandmembers contributed to the songwriting; the band rented a loft space in Central Los Angeles prior to the recording sessions so that they could jam. \"God Said\" criticizes the operations of televangelists. \"Porcupine\" denounces detaching oneself from society. \"Gotcha Covered\" is about life in Los Angeles. Chad Smith played drums on the unlisted track, a cover of \"I Fought the Law\" that also appeared on the soundtrack to Buffy the Vampire Slayer.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nThe Los Angeles Times wrote that \"in the key moments ... the band asserts a confident and consistent voice, shedding some of its old, distracting eclecticism in favor of a more comfortable and appealing rock 'n' roll purity.\" Trouser Press determined that \"the album's consistency makes it more listenable, if less adventurous, with an immediacy and urgency missing from prior work.\" The Chicago Tribune opined that \"siren singers Julie Ritter and Gretchen Seager belt out 'Leave It Alone', a speed-metal oeuvre in which guitarists Louis Gutierrez and David King fire up the grunge.\"\nThe Indianapolis Star said that \"an occasional attempt toward mainstream rock, along with some overused themes, dooms a few tunes to mediocrity.\" Spin deemed the album \"rock with that everything-but-the-kitchen-sink vibe about it.\" The Waterloo Region Record concluded that \"Mary's Danish is probably a great alternative-singles band, but as a collection American Standard just doesn't stand up to repeated listenings.\"\nAllMusic wrote that \"the material here is substandard in comparison to the earlier releases, and Asher's '70s-slick production style simply doesn't mesh with the post-post-punk eclecticism at the heart of the band's sound.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Coastal Montenegro (Montenegrin: Primorje Crne Gore / Приморје Црне Горе), is one of three statistical regions in Montenegro. It encompasses the coastal part of Montenegro. It is bordered by Central region to the north, Albania to the east, Adriatic Sea to the south, Croatia to the west, and Bosnia and Herzegovina to the northwest. It comprises six municipalities.\n\n\n== Municipalities ==\n\nCoastal Montenegro comprises six municipalities. Municipalities in Coastal Montenegro include: Bar, Budva, Herceg Novi, Kotor, Tivat and Ulcinj.\n\n\n== Administration ==\nList of current mayors and local governments\n  Democratic Montenegro (2) \n  Democratic Party of Socialists (1) \n  New Serb Democracy (1) \n  United Reform Action (1)  \n  Independent (1)  \n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\nThe Montenegrin Adriatic coast is 295 km (183 mi) long, with 72 km (45 mi) of beaches and many well-preserved ancient towns. Some of the most popular beaches are Jaz Beach, Mogren Beach, Bečići Beach, Sveti Stefan Beach and Velika Plaža. Meanwhile, some of the most popular ancient towns include Herceg Novi, Perast, Kotor, Budva and Ulcinj.\nNational Geographic Traveler (edited once a decade) ranks Montenegro among the \"50 Places of a Lifetime\". Montenegrin seaside town Sveti Stefan was once used as the cover for the magazine. The coast region of Montenegro was considered one of the great \"discoveries\" among world tourists. In January 2010, The New York Times ranked the Ulcinj South Coast region of Montenegro, including Velika Plaža, Ada Bojana, and the Hotel Mediteran of Ulcinj, among the \"Top 31 Places to Go in 2010\" as part of a worldwide ranking.\n\nUlcinj\nThe coastline of Ulcinj is 32 km long. It has more than 10 beaches. Ada Bojana is a river island. It is triangular in shape, with the sea on one side. The beach is sandy and long. Velika Plaza is the longest beach in Montenegro and is one of the warmest beaches on the Adriatic Sea. It is 12 km long and it is covered with sand. It is very shallow. The small city beach is as same as Velika Plaza but it is not as long. Valdanos is a small cove with pebbly beach and flora around it.\n\nBar\nBar Riviera is 44 km long and has 9 km of beaches. There are more than 20 beaches, but Bar has two beaches on the lakeside. The main beach in Bar is Sutomore beach. It is 1 km long and is covered with sand. Canj beach is 1 km long and is a tourist location. The beach is covered with fine sand but the sea bottom is covered with round rocky pebbles. Queen's Beach is very near Canj but it can be only approached from the sea. Red beach is specific because it is covered with red round pebbles and the view from it is outstanding. Zukotrlica beach is over 1 km long and it is near the city. It is covered with white pebbles and in the background is a little pine forest. Beach Utjeha is also called \"Olive Bay\" because there are hundreds of olive trees in the background. It is covered with shingle and is very clear. On the lake there are two beaches: Pjesacac and Murici. They are covered with shingle.\n\nBudva\nBudva Riviera has over 25 beaches and they are a favourite destination for tourists in Montenegro. The longest beach is Jaz. It is 2.5 km long and is sandy. Mogren beach has specific small pebbles. It consists of two small beaches and they are connected by a tunnel. Slovenska beach is 1.5 km long and is covered with sand. There are a lot of hotels, restaurants and parks in the background. The Becici beach is long and sandy. Milocer beach, Queen's beach and Sveti Stefan beach are the most exclusive beaches in Montenegro. Pterovac beach is quite long and is covered with little red pebbles. Special attractions there are two small isles and a small fortress near the beach. Buljarica beach is covered with sand and is 2 km long.\n\nTivat\nThere are over 15 small beaches in Tivat. Opatovo is a 200 m long shingle beach. A small lighthouse divides the beach into two parts. Beach Plavi Horizonti is perhaps the most famous in Tivat. It is 300 m long and covered with small white pebbles. There are two islands near Tivat: the Island of St. Marko and the Island of Flowers.\n\nKotor\nThis is the deepest part of Boka Kotorska so there are fewer beaches. There are about 10 small beaches. Morinj beach is a pebbly beach with views of the bay. Risan beach is a quiet, long and rocky beach. Orahovac is the favourite beach in Kotor. It is pebbly with old stone houses in the background. Trsteno is also a pebbly beach. It is 200 m long with clear water and natural background.\n\nHerceg Novi\nHerceg Novi Riviera is 25 km long and it has over 20 beaches. Igalo beach is 1.5 km long and sandy. Rose beach is rocky with very nice forest background. Zanjic beach is located in Herceg Novi. It is 300 m long and it is covered with white pebbles.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Infrastructure ===\nCoastal region has an international airport Tivat Airport.\n\nThe Port of Bar is Montenegro's main seaport. Initially built in 1906, the port was almost completely destroyed during World War II. Reconstruction began in 1950. It is equipped to handle over five million tons of cargo annually, but has been operating at a loss and well below capacity. The reconstruction of the Belgrade-Bar railway and the planned A-1 motorway are expected to return operating levels to capacity.\nKotor, Risan, Tivat and Zelenika (in Bay of Kotor) have smaller ports.\n\nIn 2023 there is a plan to install an LNG terminal at Bar to receive gas imports.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe coastal region in the 2023 census has a population of 163,960. The Coastal region of Montenegro is primarily urban. The largest town by population is Bar. Demographically, it includes a mix of Montenegrins, Serbs, Bosniaks, Croats, Albanians and other ethnic groups, with a significant portion of the population identifying as Orthodox Christian, Catholic and Muslim. Since the war began in Ukraine, a significant number of Ukrainians, Russians, and Belarusians have also relocated to the coastal region of Montenegro.\nFollowing municipalities make up the region:\n\n\n== See also ==\nMontenegro\nNorthern Montenegro\nStatistical regions of Montenegro\nMunicipalities of Montenegro\nGeography of Montenegro\n\n\n== References ==",

No physical properties are known.\n\n\n== Properties ==\n\nThere is limited research on methyl chlorate but it is suspected to be a highly hazardous material. Potential properties include:\n\nFlammability: Due to the presence of organic component (methyl group), methyl chlorate is likely flammable.\nExplosive nature: Chlorate salts are well known for being shock-sensitive and prone to explosive decomposition under certain conditions. This makes methyl chlorate potentially explosive under pressure, shock, or exposure to heat.\nStrong oxidizing agent: It is potentially a strong oxidizing agent.\nToxicology: Being a chlorate, it is suspected to be harmful if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Margaret Gertrude Bradbury, known as \"Maggie\" (b. 15 July 1927, d. 19 October 2010) was an American ichthyologist, educator and illustrator. She is best known for her work on the anglerfish family Ogcocephalidae, the deep-sea batfishes.\nShe was born on 15 July 1927 in Chicago, her parents were Gerald Bradbury, an architecht, and Margaret Bradbury. She had a younger brother Gerald Jr.. Her father died in around 1938 when she was probably 11 years old. In 1947 she joined the Chicago Natural History Museum's Zoology Department as a staff artist. In this role she provided illustrations for publications by many scientists associated with the museum, including the herpetologists Robert F. Inger and Karl P. Schmidt, as well as the ichthyologists Loren P. Woods and Robert H. Kanazawa. While she was at the Museum she enrolled in Roosevelt College and graduated with a Bachelor's degree in zoology in 1955. She continued to work as an illustrator and was honored in 1957 by Marion Griswold Grey in the specific epithet of the dreamer Oneirodes bradburyae for her \"preparation of the figure of the type specimen\".\nIn 1955 Bradbury went on a collecting trip to the Bahamas as part of an Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences expedition and on her return to the United States she matriculated at Stanford University as a graduate student. Here she was initially supervised by George S. Myers but switched to Rolf L. Bolin at the Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove around 1957. She worked as a teaching assistant at Stanford's Palo Alto campus and as a part-time technical assistant at the collection of South Pacific fishes at the George Vanderbilt Foundation. After transferring to Hopkins she worked as a technician preparing research reports for California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations at Hopkins in 1957, as an illustrator and illustrating consultant for the U.S. Bureau of Commercial Fisheries in Washington, D.C. in 1959. She worked for 2 years as a teaching assistant in marine biology at Hopkins and gained her Ph.D. in 1963. Her Ph.D. dissertation was on the systematics of the deep sea batfish family, Ogcocephalidae, a group she was to study for the rest of her career and beyond until her failing eyesight stopped her work.\nShe was appointed as assistant professor of biology at MacMurray College in Jacksonville, Illinois in 1962 but returned to California in 1963 as an assistant professor of Biological Sciences at San Francisco State College, becoming associate professor in 1967 and a full Professor in 1971. She remained at San Francisco State University for 34 years until her retirement in 1994. Bradbury also taught summer courses in ichthyology at Hopkins and too part in expeditions on the schooner Te Vega. She was regarded as a leading authority on the family Ogcocephalidae and published a number of papers on this group. She was a pioneer in the use of cladistics in her work. She became a Fellow and a Research Associate of Ichthyology at the California Academy of Sciences. In her retirement she moved to Pacific Grove where she was active as a member of the Board of Friends of the Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, an was president of that board for a number of years. She died on 19 October 2010.\n\n\n== Eponyms ==\nBradbury has been honored in the specific names of the following fishes:\n\nOneirodes bradburyae  Grey, 1957\nCoelophrys bradburyae  Endo & Shinohara, 1999 \nMalthopsis bradburyae  Ho 2013\n\n\n== References ==",

He served as a consul of the Ukrainian State and the Ukrainian People's Republic in Munich, Germany from 1918 to 1922. He is known as the last consul of the Ukrainian People's Republic.\n\n\n== Career ==\nOn 15 November 1918, Vasyl Orenchuk, who was the deputy director of the General Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Ukrainian State, was appointed Consul of the Ukrainian State in Munich. During his period as consul, Orenchuk oversaw trade traffic between Bavaria and Ukraine, provided consular assistance to Ukrainian nationals living in the region, and assisted in the dissemination of true information about Ukraine, countering false information.\nAfter meeting with the Bavarian Prime Minister Kurt Eisner and receiving an exequatur, Orenchuk gained respect and recognition in the consular corps. He actively reported on events in Ukraine and had several publications in the German press.\n\nOn 21 December 1922, the consulate of the Ukrainian People's Republic in Munich ended its activities after Germany signed the Rapallo Treaty, and Vasyl Orenchuk had to resign. After resigning, Orenchuk remained in Munich, living at Lucile-Grahn-Straße 46. A memorial plaque commemorating his service and the consulate has been installed on the building of the former consulate in Munich at Ainmillerstraße 35.\n\n\n== External links ==\nМатяш, І.

The scene is laid in Sydney; the plot is carefully constructed, a moderate amount of the sensational being introduced to render it more attractive ; and it was placed upon the stage with considerable care.\"\nEmpire praised the \"genuine ingenuity\" of the play.

Based in Dallas, Texas, the company is most known for publishing tactical and strategic games such as Against the Storm, Old World, and Manor Lords.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe company was founded in 2019. The company specializes in creating tactical and strategic games with elements commonly seen in role-playing games. As a publisher, Hooded Horse will allocate a budget of at least $100,000 for localization and marketing for each project, and developers can retain 65% of all revenues generated following a game's release. Early games published by Hooded Horse include Terra Invicta, a grand strategy game from Pavonis Interactive, the studio behind the Long War mods for modern XCOM games, and Workers & Resources: Soviet Republic from 3Division. It then signed with Mohawk Games for the development of Old World, after the original publisher Starbreeze Studios abandoned the project as it encountered financial difficulties.\nBy 2023, the publisher had a total of 12 employees, and had published 20 games, most of which were released through Steam's early access program. Against the Storm was released in late 2023 to critical acclaim, and had sold over 1 million copies by March 2024. The company is set to publish Xenonauts 2 (released through early access in 2023), Manor Lords (released through early access in April 2024), and Nova Roma from Lion Shield, the developer behind Kingdoms and Castles, among others.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Mihael (Miha) Roš (born 1808, Zavodenjska dolina, died August 2, 1885, Trbovlje) was the rihtar (a local official) of Trbovlje and later oberrihtar (chief local official).\nHis son was the mayor of Trbovlje Ferdinand Roš.\n\n\n== Life ==\nMihael was born in 1808 in Zavodenjska dolina (Hrastnik) to father Jakob and mother Lenka. Despite the family's poverty, his parents managed to provide Miha with one year of education in Celje, where he studied mathematics, Slovene, and German.\nHis knowledge of German proved very useful in life, as he was one of the few people in Trbovlje who could speak German. For example, he translated for surveyors who were conducting measurements for the construction of the railway. In 1824, he was therefore employed, where he received useful knowledge of surveying in addition to a modest income. When the measurements were completed, Miha lost his job, but soon he went to work in the Slovenian Hills, where he worked as a customs officer until 1837.\nDuring the construction of the southern railway, he obtained a tavern concession and became a successful innkeeper.\n\nIn 1838, he married Jerica Ojsteršek and had a son, Boštjan, and in 1847 a son, Ferdinand.\nRoš excelled in literacy and was well-known and respected throughout the valley. Therefore, he was appointed as the rihtar and later oberrihtar of the Cadastre Municipality of Trbovlje by the district leadership, which increased his reputation. In 1850, he was succeeded in this position by Franc Pust. He remained a good friend to him until his death.\n\nIn 1874, he was an advisor to the council of the public school in Hrastnik, which was then part of the Trbovlje Municipality. He died on August 2, 1885, and was buried two days later.\n\n\n== Literature ==",

It adapted an American play The Poor of New York to Melbourne.\nThe play was a rare non-musical work from Akhurst.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe Age said  \"We cannot honestly admire either the construction of the play or its wrotched claptrap sentiment.\"\nThe Leader said the play \"was very favorably received...  by a large audience. Mr Fawcett's efforts in the quaint character which has fallen to his lot received special recognition. Some of the local scenery is remarkably good.\"\nBell's Life said the play was \"not unskilfully arranged, and with a sufficient amount of locil material to give an original appearance.\"\nThe Herald thought the play's ambition was greater than the author's ability.\nThe Argus said the piece was \"a great success\" commercially.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Potaissa Sphinx statue is a 3rd-century bronze statue from the former province of Dacia. The sphinx sculpture itself bears striking parallels with the famous Naxos sphinx from 560 BC, which is now in the Delphi Archaeological Museum.\n\n\n== The history of the statue ==\nFor the first time, in February 1847, a German archaeological magazine published the statue and its inscription, as well as a drawing of the statue. According to the report at the time, the find was discovered during an excavation near Torda.\nGerman archaeologists judged the statue's inscription to be authentic, and many tried to decipher it, but no one succeeded.\nThe statue found its place in the private collection of the archaeologist Count József Kemény, who led the excavation.\nAfter the German presentation, János Érdy-Luczenbacher requested the statue from József Kemény's collection and presented it to the professors of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, as well as to Croatian, German and Austrian archaeologists and historians.\nThe statue is then returned to Kemény József's collection, where it is stolen along with many other works of art during the Hungarian Revolution of 1848/49.\n\n\n== The text ==\nAt the end of December 2003, Dr. Péter Révész, professor of informatics and honorary professor of classical philology at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, published his study in which he successfully deciphers that the text on the statue is an archaic Hungarian text written in special Greek letters. With this, the statue became the oldest written language memory in Hungarian. The interpretation of the text has been confirmed by several other experts and is now accepted. Most recently, it was published by the journal Mediterranean Archeology and Archaeometry.\nAfter the decipherment, however, some experts called the statue a fake.\n\n\n== Arguments for and against the authenticity of the sculpture ==\n\n\n=== Arguments against its authenticity ===\nOne of the few contemporary records of the statue was found in the archives of József Kemény, whose early career involved a document falsification scandal. According to some opinions, the statue never existed, and only József Kemény invented the whole thing.\nJózsef Kemény never presented the statue to the general public, as he claimed that his mansion was robbed during the revolution.\n\n\n=== Arguments for its authenticity ===\nThe type of Greek letters on the statue were only discovered nearly 50 years after the discovery of the statue. So, Kemény could not have known about such letters and could not have used them in a forgery.\nContemporary Roman sources mention a sphinx statue erected in the Isis temple in the settlement.\nThe statue was presented at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and examined by several Austrian, Hungarian, Croatian and German historians.\nThe Hungarian text written in Greek letters only contains words that could already exist in the Hungarian in the third century, while it does not contain words that the Hungarians took from other languages only later. However, in József's time, these linguistic theories had not yet been developed, on the basis of which a possible forger would have been able to choose and use only authentic words.\nA German archaeological newspaper published an accurate drawing of the statue and the inscription on it in 1847, before József Kemény.\nIn a letter addressed to a confidential friend of his time, József Kemény reports that his mansion was really looted during the revolution.\nAt the beginning of his career, József forged only one document, but his later works are all authentic, and therefore he was a member of many scientific institutions. He never faked artifacts, but he did collect them.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ambrose Carlisto Piedade Fernandes (born Ambrosio Calisto Piedade Fernandes; 31 July 1899 – 6 April 1982) known professionally as A. M. B. Rose, was an Indian theatre actor, singer, theatre director, and playwright who worked on the Konkani stage. One of the early character actors of the Konkani tiatr stage, he gained fame during the golden phase of tiatr from the 1930s to 1970s. The patriarch of the 'Rose family', his son Alfred Rose followed in his footsteps to become a Konkani singer. Fernandes's family talents extended to his daughter-in-law Rita Rose, who made similar contributions to the Konkani stage like her husband Alfred, which inturn helped their children to become Konkani singers.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nAmbrosio Calisto Piedade Fernandes was born on 31 July 1899 in the island of Calvim, Goa, which was part of Portuguese India during the Portuguese Empire (now part of India) to Caetano Salvador Fernandes and Victoria Isabel Fernandes. He inherited his family's rich tradition of performance arts, particularly in acting and music, with his father Caetano being a respected figure in these realms. Born into a lineage of Konkani singers and writers, he hailed from a family with a musical background. His grandfather was celebrated for his proficiency in composing and arranging zagors in the Konkani language. During that period, Fernandes' father too played a significant role in the Konkani artistic community, gaining recognition for his work as a stage performer, composer, and coordinator of Konkani zagors. During his early years, Fernandes and his mother, Victoria, made a move to Karachi, British India, where his father was engaged in employment, further nurturing his exposure to diverse cultural influences.\nFernandes, also known as Kantorist Rose (transl. Singer Rose) during his formative years, was also a musician and vocalist and received his early education at St. Patrick's High School in Karachi, British India. This educational institution, administered by the Jesuit order, provided Fernandes with a comprehensive foundation in music, encompassing reading, writing, and vocal training, with an emphasis on solfeggio. Additionally, he had the privilege of studying the violin under the tutelage of popular violinists, attaining a mastery of the instrument. He had the unique opportunity to undergo musical training under the tutelage of distinguished musicians in Karachi during that period. Fernandes' musical talent did not go unnoticed by the Jesuit priests at St. Patrick's High School, who were impressed by his abilities. Recognizing his potential, they offered him a singular opportunity to showcase his vocal prowess in a school concert. Fernandes delivered a memorable performance that exceeded all expectations, demonstrating his musical abilities. He demonstrated a commitment to the trust and confidence bestowed upon him by his Jesuit superiors. As a result, his fellow students bestowed upon him the moniker \"Kantorist Rose\", acknowledging his talent as a singer. During this period, the Jesuit priests granted Fernandes a stage name that would accompany him throughout his career: A. M. B. Rose. Derived from his first name, the initials A. M. B. represented his individuality as a performer. Fernandes embraced this stage name with great reverence, and it became his professional identity, forever associated with his musical achievements.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1919, during the theatrical tour of Karachi, British India by Saib Rocha's Union Jack Dramatic Company, a Konkani tiatr titled Noketr Italia Xarachem (A Star  from the city of Italy) captivated young Fernandes. This experience ignited Fernandes' desire to contribute to the tiatr tradition, leading him to embark on the creation of his own script, eventually resulting in the production of Comedy of Errors vo \"Gondoll Zunvlleam Bhavancho. With dedication, Fernandes crafted the script until its completion. The inaugural staging of Comedy of Errors vo Gondoll Zunvlleam Bhavancho took place at the Goa Portuguese Association Hall in Karachi. During his time as the Mayor of Karachi, B. F. Cabral, who originated from Chimbel-Ribandar in Goa (then part of Portuguese India during Portuguese Empire), attended a tiatr performance by Fernandes. Cabral was impressed by Fernandes' talents in acting, singing, and directing, leading him to invite Fernandes to direct three of his own tiatrs: Gabriel Balcheanv Ani Tachi Sasumaim (Gabriel Balcheao and his Mother-in-law), A Conquista de Goa (The Conquest of Goa), and Inocent Hermione.\n\nFernandes' artistic prowess shone through in each of those tiatrs, earning him acclaim and establishing his reputation throughout Karachi. Fernandes made history by being the inaugural Goan artist to perform at The Palace Theatre in Karachi, a venue traditionally restricted to European theater troupes. Building upon his success, Fernandes continued to present a series of captivating tiatrs at the Zoroastrian Hall in Karachi. Fernandes' artistic accomplishments left an impact on the Goan community residing in Karachi, inspiring many individuals to pursue acting and singing. In order to foster this burgeoning interest, Fernandes founded the Group of Goan Amateurs, a collective of young Goan tiatrists, providing them with a platform to showcase their talents and contribute to the tiatr culture.\nFernandes served as a catalyst for the promotion and active participation of Goans in Karachi, British India in the realm of Konkani tiatrs. He played a pivotal role in fostering a deep affection for the Konkani language and Konkani tiatr performances among the community. As a founder of the Group of Goan Amateurs, Fernandes orchestrated and showcased several theatrical performances known as tiatrs under his banner. His final production, Cuslolo Visvo Xekddo, was staged in Karachi in 1929. In 1930, Fernandes left Karachi and returned to Aldona, Goa, his hometown. After a four-year stay in Goa, he relocated to Bombay, British India in 1934 to explore career opportunities. He initially worked at Shah & C. before securing a position at Nestlé, a Swiss company, where he remained until retiring. In 1937, it was in Bombay that Fernandes seized a significant opportunity to make his mark in the professional Konkani theater scene, debuting in J. P. Souzalin's tiatr production, Conde de Monte Cruz (The Count of Monte Cristo), which took place at the Princess Theatre in Bhangwadi, Bombay-widely regarded as the 'Mecca of tiatr' at that time. Fernandes's performance in Conde de Monte Cruz propelled him into the limelight, opening doors for him to collaborate with directors in the Konkani tiatr industry, including Aleixinho De Candolim, Saib Rocha, and other luminaries.\nFernandes was a influential figure in the realm of tiatr, a popular form of theatrical entertainment in Konkani-speaking regions. Known for his performances, Fernandes not only showcased his own skills but also generously shared his expertise, assisting other artists in refining their acting abilities. Acting in the tiatrs produced by Saib Rocha was a long-cherished aspiration that Fernandes fulfilled. In the tiatr Aga Kumpar by Alexinho De Candolim, Fernandes portrayed a daring character with precision, leaving an impression on the audience. J. P. Souzalin, recognizing Fernandes's talent and dedication, entrusted him with the role of a beggar in the tiatr Padr Agnel (Father Agnel). Impressed by his abilities, Souzalin later cast Fernandes as a heartbroken father in the production Hem Asa Tem (This is what is), which garnered significant fame and acclaim.\nFernandes was praised and recognized by both fans of tiatr (a type of musical theatre in Goa) and the media for his accomplishments. His contributions were not limited to performing; he also made achievements as a playwright. His tiatrs, namely Ghatkeponnacho Inam (Reward of Betrayal) and Jadu (Magic), were particularly memorable and well-regarded. As a character actor, Fernandes displayed meticulous attention to detail in his portrayals. His acute attention to detail in costume selection, makeup application, and voice modulation allowed him to authentically embody each character he depicted. Fernandes was part of a group of early tiatrists who actively participated in the theatrical productions of Pai Tiatrist, widely recognized as the pioneer of Konkani tiatr. During the golden era of tiatr from the 1930s to the 1970s, Fernandes stood out as one of the prominent and esteemed Konkani tiatrists of his time.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nFernandes entered into matrimony with Maria Anunciação Bernardina Fernandes, a homemaker originating from Colvale, Goa. While additional children may have been bom to the couple, certain birth records pertaining to their children may have been lost. According to the extant documentation, they had three children: two daughters named Alexandrina (born in 1929) and Emilia (born in 1926), as well as a son named Rosario Alfredo Fernandes, later recognized as Rosario Alfred Fernandes. In a continuation of the family's artistic legacy, Rosario followed in his father's footsteps as a popular Konkani singer, professionally known as Alfred Rose.\nRosario subsequently entered into wedlock with Rita Rose, a fellow Konkani singer and actress hailing from Bombay, British India. Fernandes' son Rosario's progeny, namely Schubert, Engelbert, and Alria, have each embraced musical careers within the Konkani domain. Revered by his peers in the tiatr community, Fernandes was endearingly referred to as \"Daddy.\" Due to deteriorating health, he decided to permanently step away from performing on the Konkani tiatr stage, and retired to his ancestral residence in Aldona, Goa, at the age of 55. During his stay in Goa, he resided in his native village of Aldona. On 6 April 1982, Fernandes died in Goa at the age of 82.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Mount Adir (Hebrew: הר אדיר, romanized: Har Adir, Arabic: جبل عداثر, romanized: Jabal Adathir) is a mountain in the Upper Galilee, Israel, located within the area of the Meron Nature Reserve, near the settlements of Sasa, Mattat, and Hurfeish. The mountain rises to a height of 1,008 meters above sea level, making it one of the highest mountains in Israel. It is covered with a dense Mediterranean forest of oak, terebinth, pistacia, and kermes oak.\nThe name of the mountain, which overlooks Lebanon, was given to it because of the verse from the Book of Isaiah \"and Lebanon with its majestic trees will fall.\" At the site, there are remnants of a fortress from the Iron Age, which was presumably built by the Omride dynasty of the Kingdom of Israel. The summit of the mountain is closed to visitors and on it is an IDF base with numerous antennas, which are visible from afar.\n\n\n== Archeology ==\nThe excavations conducted in the 1970s exposed remains which were interpreted as a three-strata fortress dated to the 9th‒11th centuries BCE. The fortress showed characteristics of the Omride architecture and must have been built by the kings of the Northern Kingdom as a center of control over the wooded, sparsely inhabited Upper Galilee, facing the territory of Tyre in the west. Ceramic findings at the site, also date back to the Iron Age II.\n\n\n== Mount Adir Lookout ==\n\nMount Adir, close to the border with Lebanon, offers an excellent view towards most of southern Lebanon. On the first memorial day of the Second Lebanon War, the families of the fallen soldiers requested the establishment of a lookout in memory of the war's casualties. Initiated by the bereaved families, the lookout was established by the Israel Nature and Parks Authority and with the assistance of the Jewish National Fund. It was inaugurated in a state ceremony on July 3, 2012, and consists of a wooden deck that can accommodate 180 visitors. On the railing, there are explanations about the course of the war, metal plates with the names of the 121 soldiers who fell during the war, orientation maps of the area, and engraved is the poem by Yehuda Amichai \"For Man Is a Tree of the Field\".\n\n\n=== Dedication ===\nThere is also a plaque with a dedication from the bereaved families in memory of the war's casualties, which reads:\"We, the parents of soldiers who fell defending the Israel in the Second Lebanon War, are bound to this land with every fiber of our being. We have always seen contributing to the state as a central part of our worldview. Our enlistment and the enlistment of our sons to serve in the Israel Defense Forces is a natural continuation of this recognition. It was clear to us and our sons that service in the army might put them in situations where they would be required to risk their lives and perhaps even sacrifice them. We always hoped that this need would never arise. In the summer of 2006, during the war, we accompanied our sons to their eternal rest. This lookout was built in memory of our beloved, with appreciation, love, and endless longing.\"\n\n\n== Nature ==\nSince the lookout is located in the Mount Meron Nature Reserve, efforts were made not to harm nature. Therefore, the paved road to the mountain's summit, which was laid many years ago to reach the military base on the mountain, does not reach the lookout. Access to the lookout is possible only on foot, after a walk of about 5 minutes on a dirt road leading from the parking lot adjacent to the military camp.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Birgit Hellwig is a German linguist specializing in African and Papuan languages. She is professor of general linguistics at the University of Cologne.\n\n\n== Education, career and honours ==\nHellwig studied African linguistics at the University of Bayreuth and the University of Hamburg. In 1998 she took up a doctoral position at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen, where her doctorate was awarded in 2001. She remained in Nijmegen working at the Language Archive until 2003. Between 2003 and 2005 she carried out postdoctoral research at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, and from 2006 to 2008 at La Trobe University in Melbourne; during this time she collaborated with the Department of Linguistics at the University of Khartoum.\nIn 2008, Hellwig took up a junior professorship in language documentation at the University of Erfurt. In 2010 she returned to La Trobe University, this time as a Senior Research Fellow at the Centre for Research on Language Diversity. Since 2014 she has been professor for language documentation and psycholinguistics at the University of Cologne.\nIn 2020, Hellwig was elected ordinary member of the Academia Europaea.\n\n\n== Research ==\nHellwig conducts research into language documentation, language acquisition, linguistic typology, and anthropological linguistics. She has worked on a variety of languages of Africa, including Goemai and other Chadic languages, Katla, Tabaq, and Zaghawa, as well as the Qaqet language of Papua New Guinea. A major focus of her research has been creating corpora for all of the above languages, based on original fieldwork. Her research has received funding from the Endangered Languages Documentation Programme, the Australian Research Council,, the German Research Foundation, and the Volkswagen Foundation.\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\nHellwig, Birgit. 2006.

        "content": "Nexhip Vinçani (born 10 August 1916 in Vinçan, near Korçë, died 6 March 1997 in Tirana) was a Major General of the Albanian Army, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Albanian Army, and a victim of communist repression.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHe was the son of Kahreman Vinçani. After completing primary school in his hometown, he studied at the French high school in Korçë, the gymnasium in Shkodra, and then at the Royal Military School in Tirana. The Italian invasion of Albania found Vinçani in Rome, where he was studying law at the local university. In 1941, he interrupted his studies and returned to Albania to join one of the resistance movement units. In 1942, he organized partisan units in the Korçë district together with his brothers. In 1943, he became the commander of the Korçë District in the National Liberation Army. After the reorganization of partisan units in August 1943, he became the commander of the 4th Assault Brigade. In late 1943 and early 1944, faced with the threat of the brigade's liquidation, Vinçani, with the consent of the command, moved his units to the Skrapar region. He fought in the eastern part of the country, was wounded in the Battle of Pogradec, and from September 1944 participated in the Battle of Tirana.\nAfter the communists came to power, Vinçani was promoted to the rank of Major General and commanded a division stationed in Peshkopi. Soon after, he was sent to study at the Woroshylov General Staff Academy in Moscow. Upon his return, he became the Deputy Chief of the General Staff, and in 1956, he assumed the position of Coastal Defense Commander. In 1958, he was arrested and demoted, then forced to work on draining marshes near Fier. In 1982, he was declared an enemy of the people, sentenced to a year in prison, and later interned near Gramsh. After the fall of communism, he was active in veteran organizations and was the initiator of the United Organization of Veterans of the National Liberation Army. He died in Tirana.\nHe was married to Mamika. Posthumously awarded the Order of Nderi i Kombit (Honor of the Nation). A street in Korçë bears Vinçani's name.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nHalili, Kujtim (2006). Fjalor biografik ushtarak. Tirana. p. 178. ISBN 99943-849-2-9.",

        "content": "The Cazin attack was an attack by the NOZB, when they invaded the territory of the ARBiH through the territory of the RSK and successfully occupied a good part along the border of Cazinska Krajina and Serbian Krajina. They also advanced south of Velika Kladuša, but the ARBiH stopped further expansion on the southern side and stabilized the front.\n\n\n== Course of the Clashes ==\nAbdić's forces regained the initiative when the fighting resumed on December 4, the army received permission from the Serb Krajina army to cross their territory. The National Defense of Western Bosnia passes through RSK and attacks the Bihac enclave near Ličko Petrovo Selo from the western side. Advancing from this unexpected direction, a relatively small number of 1,500 APZB soldiers managed to gain a significant foothold in the western enclave of Bihać, occupying a strip of territory several kilometers deep along the RSK border and advancing as far as 10 km from Cazin. At the same time, Abdić's forces in the north managed to capture Johovica and Skokovi, two settlements for which fierce clashes were fought, and they were located a few kilometers south of Velika Kladisa. The newly appointed commander of the Bihać region, Atif Dudaković, reacted quickly, engaging the forces that were withdrawing from their southern moves, he halted the further advance of Abdić on December 8. However, the ARBiH did not succeed in retaliating against the counterattack, failed to return those territories that APZB occupied and thus protect the position of Cazin from potential attacks.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Political and Legal Affairs Commission of the Central Military Commission\" (中国共产党中央军事委员会政法委员会) is a first-level functional agency of the Central Military Commission，and a deputy theater-grade military unit. It is the main coordination and control organ for all matters related to military justice and law enforcement. It is based in Beijing.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2007, the Central Military Commission ordered the establishment of Political and Legal Affairs Committees (政法委员会) in every PLA unit above the Corps grade, headed usually by the Secretary of Discipline Inspection Commission of the unit, as part of the accelerating campaign against corruption in the military. The CMC established a PLAC at the central level as well, and ordered intensive training on the management of legal affairs to all the involved officers. This generalization of party committee participation in legal enforcement in the PLA was the precursor of the later reforms.\n\n\n=== Post-Reform Period ===\nAfter the 2015 Reforms, the committee was reorganized into the Political and Legal Affairs Committee of the Central Military Commission in January 2016. The commission was organized as a coordinating body, with a secretary and deputy secretary, and members appointed from the Chinese People's Liberation Army Military Court, Chinese People's Liberation Army Military Procuratorate, and the various bureaus of Political and Legal Commission itself. The plan also stipulated that the Party Political and Legal Committees in all the PLA units should follow the guidance of the commission, while taking responsibility for the management of the political and legal work in their units.\nThis implied a division of labor according to the operational/administrative lines of command, with the Committees of the Theater Command level being in charge of legal action during wartime and major operations, as well as being in charge of coordinating law enforcement cases and of regional cooperation. The Committees of the military branches are responsible for general crime prevention, maintenance of probity of the forces, and guaranteeing security and stability within its branches' units. All local unit party committees must report, consult and coordinate with the CMC-PLC. ==\n\n\n== Organization ==\nFollowing the 2015 reforms, the structure of the commission is as follows:\n\n\n=== Subordinate Units ===\nGeneral Office (综合局)\nPolitical Work Bureau (政治工作局)\nSecurity Bureau (保卫局)\nPLA's Military Procuratorate (中国人民解放军军事检察院)（Deputy Theater Grade）\nPLA's Military Court (中国人民解放军军事法院)（Deputy Theater Grade）\nPLA's General Court (中国人民解放军总直属军事法院)\nPLA's General Military Procuratorate (中国人民解放军总直属军事检察院)\nMilitary Prison Bureau (军事监狱)\n\n\n== Leadership History ==\nPLA Legal Affairs Party Committee Secretary\nGeneral Sun Zhongtong (孙忠同)（2007年—2009年，总政治部副主任、中央军委纪委书记兼）\nAdmiral Tong Shiping (童世平)（2009年—2012年，总政治部副主任、中央军委纪委书记兼）\nGeneral Du Jincai (杜金才（2012年—2016年，总政治部副主任、中央军委纪委书记、中央纪委副书记、中央政法委委员兼）\n\n\n== References ==",

The club was founded on 28 October 1945 as the legal successor to the VfL Dülmen and Turn- und Spielverein 1884 Dülmen clubs. It offers football, athletics, table tennis and martial arts.\n\n\n== Table tennis ==\n\n\n=== Overview and successes ===\nTSG Dülmen's most successful department to date has been the table tennis department. The first women's team was one of the most successful German teams in the 1990s and played in the German table tennis league for many years. In 1987, the team was promoted to the 2nd Bundesliga and in 1988, under coach Dirk Schimmelpfennig, the team made it through to the 1st BL. TSG Dülmen were German champions in 1995 and finished runners-up six times in total. In 1991, the Dülmen team won the ETTU Cup and reached the final the following year; in 1995 and 1996, they reached the European Cup final, but lost both finals against Statisztika Budapest from Hungary. The players in these successful years included Olga Nemes, Ding Yaping, Tong Ling, Nicole Struse, Ilka Böhning, Elke Wosik, Dana Weber and Christiane Praedel. Birgit Schmude (now Birgit Schneider), the German schoolgirl champion from 1986, has been active in the club since 1980. She moved to Langweid in 1991 and returned via ESV Coesfeld in 1994. In 1997, the team made up of Nicole Struse, Åsa Svensson, Alessia Arisi, Ilka Böhning and Birgit Schneider (Schmude) became German runners-up. Immediately afterwards, TSG withdrew all the women's teams.\nThe men's team became champions of the Oberliga in 1996 and played in the Regionalliga West in 1996/97. Christian Süß was a youth player at TSG in 1998/99. At the end of the 1999/2000 season, the team was withdrawn from the 2nd Bundesliga.\n\n\n=== The history ===\nThe table tennis department was founded in 1948 by Hermann Schlüter. Karl Kerckhoff was head of the department for 30 years. Initially, there was only one men's team. A women's team was registered for the first time in 1960. In 1982, the ladies played in the district league. After that, they were promoted every year until they finally reached the 1st Bundesliga in 1988. The manager during this time was Manny Malta, who was replaced by Siegfried Schmitz in 1990.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\nDülmen-Report, magazine DTS, 1991/5 p. 28-31\n\n\n== Athletics ==\nIn the 1960s, discus thrower Bernd Mensmann was active for TSG Dülmen. Among other things, he was German runner-up in the discus throw in 1960. The department also produced other top athletes. These include sprinter Manuel Sanders and cross-country runner Klara Koppe.\nThe athletics department of TSG Dülmen organised the German Marathon Championships in 1975 and 1983. Every year on the first weekend of December, a so-called \"Nikolauslauf\" takes place in favour of the Münster Children's Cancer Aid. This is a road race over 2.5 km, 5 km and 10 km. There are around 600 participants each year. The 38th edition will take place in 2024. Another road race is the \"Wasserlauf\", which has been held annually since 2014. It was initially held in Hausdülmen. Since 2022, however, it has been held on the same course as the Nikolauslauf in the stadium on Grenzweg.\nIn addition to the road races, TSG Dülmen has also organised the annual Dülmen pole vault meeting since 2020, in which athletes such as Wolfgang Ritte and Annika Roloff have taken part on several occasions. In 2024, the track opening sports festival will also be held for the 41st time and the school sports festival for the 27th time.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Your Northern Beaches Independent Team (YNBIT), also known simply as Your Northern Beaches, is an Australian political party that competes in local elections for Northern Beaches Council in New South Wales.\nThe party was founded by former Warringah mayor Michael Regan, who currently serves as a Northern Beaches councillor and a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Your Warringah ===\nIn 2008, Regan formed Wake Up Warringah (WUW) for the local government elections on 13 September. At the elections, he was elected mayor and WUW candidates were elected in A Ward, B Ward and C Ward.\nAhead of the 2012 local elections, the party was renamed to Your Warringah, and Regan was re-elected as mayor with 56.3% of the vote. Six candidates from the party were also elected as councillors.\n\n\n=== Your Northern Beaches ===\nIn May 2016, it was announced that Warringah Council, along with the Pittwater and Manly councils, would be merged to establish the Northern Beaches Council with immediate effect.\nOn 20 January 2017, Regan formed the Your Northern Beaches Independent Team as a successor to Your Warringah, and registered the party with the New South Wales Electoral Commission. The new party was criticised by former Warringah and Manly councillor Pat Daley, a Liberal Party member, who said it was a \"major political part[y]\" and its candidates are not independent.\nAt the 2017 local elections, the party won a plurality on council, with 6 out of 15 seats. The party retained its six seats at the next election in 2021.\nRegan was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as the member for Wakehurst at the 2023 state election.\nOn 28 January 2024, Pittwater Ward councillor Michael Gencher left YNBIT to join the Liberal Party. According to the Northern Beaches Advocate, Gencher was one of several YNBIT councillors facing \"pressure to stand aside\" in favour of candidates aligned with teal independents. As a result of Gencher's defection, YNBIT lost their plurality on council.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Troon Lifeboat Station is the base for Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) lifeboats at Troon in South Ayrshire, Scotland. It opened in 1871 and operates both all-weather and inshore lifeboats.\n\n\n== History ==\nLifeboat stations had been established at Irvine and Ayr by 1859. The people of Troon  asked the RNLI to provide one for their town, which they agreed to in 1871. £250 was paid to build a boathouse at the harbour on land donated by the Duke of Portland. \nA larger boat was stationed at Troon from 1905 so the boathouse was sold to the county council and the lifeboat since that time has been kept afloat in the harbour. The present crew accommodation and workshop was built in 1987 and extended in 1996. An Inshore lifeboat (ILB) was stationed at Troon for the first time in January 2004. A boathouse was built for it and a davit erected to lower it into the water.\n\n\n== Service awards ==\nThree RNLI Medals have been awarded to members of Troon lifeboat crews. The first were the result of 7 people being rescued from the Belfast steamer Moyallen on 6 December 1940. It was a difficult rescue amid a gale and rain. Coxswain William McAuslane was given a silver medal and Albert J Ferguson received a bronze medal. The other medal was presented to coxswain/mechanic Ian Johnson who took the lifeboat to rescue 5 people from a dredger that was in danger of breaking its moorings outside the harbour in a Force 10 storm on 12 September 1980.\nThe 'Thanks of the Institution inscribed on Vellum' was presented to Thomas Devenny who led a mission to rescue the crew of a small fishing boat during a storm on 18 October 1984. The same award was given to David Seaward and Paul Aspin who used the all-weather lifeboat's (ALB's) dinghy to rescue 10 people from the TS Mountbatten which ran aground at Ayr on  14 July 1988. Ian Johnson, the ALB's coxswain on the day, received a  'Framed Letter of Thanks' from the chairman. Another 'Thanks of the Institution inscribed on Vellum' was given to Colin Millar and Gary McGarvie after leading the lifeboat in a difficult rescue of a trawler on 14 January 2015.\nOn 8 December 1979 Roy Trewern used the lifeboat's inflatable dinghy to help two people cut off by a rising tide, for which he received a  'Framed Letter of Thanks' from the chairman. Ian Johnson and the whole crew received a 'Framed Letter of Thanks' for saving a broken down yacht and 4 people near Holy Isle on 23 May 1992.\n\n\n== Troon lifeboats ==\n'ON' is the Official Number used in RNLI records from 1884. 'Op. No.' is the Operational Number of the boat displayed on the boat.\n\n\n=== Inshore lifeboats ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of RNLI stations\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nRNLI: Troon Lifeboat Station",

They were six points behind Ipswich Town in second place and seven points behind champions, Leicester City. Southampton finished in fourth place, nine points behind Ipswich Town. Fifth and sixth placed West Bromwich Albion and  Norwich City finished 21 and 23 points respectively behind Ipswich Town. They all therefore missed out on the two automatic places for promotion to the Premier League and instead took part in the play-offs to determine the third and final promoted team.\nThe first legs, between Norwich City and Leeds United at Carrow Road, and between West Bromwich Albion and Southampton at The Hawthorns, took place on 12 May.

        "content": "Rhosneigr Lifeboat Station is a former Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) lifeboat station located in the village of Rhosneigr on the west coast of the Isle of Anglesey, Wales.\nA lifeboat was first stationed here by the RNLI in 1872, following a series of shipwrecks in Rhosneigr Bay.\nWith just 7 launches and 2 lives saved in the previous 20 years, the Rhosneigr Lifeboat Station was closed in 1924.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe RNLI agreed to open an additional lifeboat station at Rhosneigr in 1872. A 30-foot 10-oared self-righting lifeboat was ordered, and a boathouse was constructed, costing £254-5s-0d. A gift of £600, made to the RNLI from a Mrs Lingham, in memory of her late husband, was allocated to the station. On 19 September 1872, the station was formally opened, and Mrs Lingham named the lifeboat Thomas Lingham.\nAn extraordinary rescue took place on 30 March 1883. Called to the aid of the vessel Norman Court of Greenock, the Rhosneigr lifeboat was beaten by the conditions, and also lost a crew member when he was washed overboard. The Holyhead lifeboat was towed to the scene by steam tug, but they too failed to reach the wreck, returning to Holyhead. The Rocket Brigade then failed to get a line to the wreck. The Rhosneigr crew launched once more, only to be beaten by the conditions again, returning to station absolutely exhausted.\nA request was made for a replacement crew from Holyhead, with the Holyhead railway company arranging an engine to transport the crew. This time, the Holyhead crew in the Rhosneigr boat were successful, and 20 men were rescued from the Norman Court. Holyhead coxswain Thomas Roberts received the RNLI Silver Medal.\nA tragedy struck Rhosneigr on 28 December 1894, when a young man was run over by the lifeboat carriage during the launch. No effective service was carried out, and William Roberts died of his injuries a few days later.\nThere would be four lifeboats stationed at Rhosneigr between 1872 and 1924, and all retained the name Thomas Lingham. In 1897, Thomas Lingham (ON 277) was called to the aid of the Ann Jane of Portmadoc, in Cymyran Bay. The 3½ ton lifeboat was pulled 3 miles along sand and through a river to reach a launching point, but managed to rescue the 5 crew and 1 passenger. When the lifeboat was replaced in 1904, the lighter 34-foot Self-righting (Rubie) lifeboat was provided, the Thomas Lingham (ON 533), weighing just 2 tons 6 cwts.\nRhosneigr had been a relatively busy station when it first opened, with 45 lives saved in 13 years, 10 lives saved in 1890, and 13 rescued in the following 13 years. But calls and rescues had dramatically reduced in the early 1900s,and the decision was made to close Rhosneigr Lifeboat Station in 1924. The boathouse still stands, and is currently a boathouse / store. The Thomas Lingham (ON 533) was transferred to the relief fleet until being sold in 1937. The boat is currently with Holyhead Maritime Museum for restoration.\n\n\n== Blackburn Botha Crash 1941 ==\n\nOn 28 August 1941, an RAF Blackburn Botha with 3 aboard, crashed into the sea off Rhosneigr, in gale force conditions and particularly rough seas. With no lifeboat at Rhosneigr, and with the Holyhead lifeboat away for repairs, the nearest lifeboat was 2 hours away at Porthdinllaen.\nStewart Wood and Derrick Baynham, both aged 17, set out in a small dinghy to effect a rescue. They reached the plane, taking the pilot on board, but then their dinghy capsized, and the two boys were lucky to survive. Nine men launched a boat to the rescue, but that too was capsized. Some people who tried to swim out to the aircraft were also drowned. In all, 11 men died trying to save the three airmen, who all perished.\nThe following awards were made:\n\nGeorge Medal\nRNLI Silver Medal\nCigarette case, awarded by General Sikorski, Commander of Polish forces.\nDerek Hubert Baynham, Schoolboy\nJohn Leslie Stewart Wood, Schoolboy\nRNLI Bronze Medal\nC.

        "content": "Derby Square is in the city centre of Liverpool, England.\nThe square stands on what was the original site for Liverpool Castle. Records differ on when it was built, but it is believed to have been constructed any time from 1208 to 1235. Following the English Civil War, parliament ordered the castle to be destroyed and by 1715 the castle was a ruin, with its bricks and stone being recycled for other building work in the city.\nSt George's Church was built on the square and opened in 1726. The church had to be rebuilt between 1809 - 1825 as the tower was starting to crack. This was because the church was built over part of the rubble-filled moat of the old castle and had began to settle and crack.\nFunding for the church was stopped by Liverpool Corporation after an anti-Semetic sermon was preached following the appointment of a Jewish Mayor, Charles Mozley, in 1863. The church closed in 1897 and was demolished two years later.\nA momument dedicated to Queen Victoria was built on the square, being officially unveiled in 1906. The monument was given Grade II listed status in 1975.\nThe square was damaged extensively during the 1941 blitz, though despite the heavy damage, the Victoria Monument escaped without any serious damage.\nIn 1973, construction work began on Queen Elizabeth II Law Courts, Liverpool, with the facility opening in 1984.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Earlestown Football Club was an association football club from St Helens in Lancashire.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe club was founded in 1880 and it made its senior football bow in the Lancashire Senior Cup in 1881.\nThe club's greatest successes came in the era before the game turned professional.  It was a strong power in the west Lancashire area, and reached the Liverpool Senior Cup final in 1883–84, 1884–85, and 1888–89.  Its first two finals were both against Everton, and a 1–0 win at Hawthorne Road in 1885 in front of over 4,000  (with 700 fans travelling on a special train), the goal coming from a scrimmage which bundled goalkeeper Lindsay over the line, saw the Cup go to Earlestown for the only time.  The power of the resources available to clubs in the new Football League however was quickly demonstrated - in 1889–90, Earlestown met Everton in the semi-final, and was hammered 13–2.\nEarlestown was one of the founder members of the Lancashire League in 1889, having turned professional in 1888, and having its expenditure increase to £200. The club lost its first four matches, before picking up a win by beating the similarly pointless Rossendale 5–3 at home in October.  Earlestown won four matches - the others being a double over West Manchester, which was top of the table when Earlestown won the home fixture, and a breathless 6–5 win in the return at Rossendale - and one more win, against Hyde, was stricken from the record because of crowd violence.  The match was never re-played; Earlestown was expelled before season end for not fulfilling its fixtures, with the club only ahead of Rossendale at the time.\nThe club did re-join the competition in 1899, staying in mid-table until the competition was absorbed into the Lancashire Combination in 1903.  Earlestown started off in the second division, and was promoted in its first season.  It yo-yoed between the two divisions over the next decade, its best finish being 14th (out of 18) in the first division in 1904–05.\nDespite its early prominence, Earlestown did not enter the FA Cup until 1900–01, and in its first entry it reached the fourth qualifying round, the penultimate stage; the match at home to Nantwich was considered to be a foregone conclusion, but the visitors won 3–2.  That run proved to be Earlestown's best, which it matched in 1905–06, when it lost 2–0 at Barnsley.\nBefore the start of the 1911–12 season, the reserve sides of Football League clubs, which had been the backbone of the Combination, withdrew for a new competition.  Denuded of clubs, the Combination \"promoted\" 11 of its division two sides - including Earlestown - into the first division.  However the costs and standard proved too much for the club, and Earlestown disbanded in October due to lack of support, with a debt of £200, albeit that was eventually cleared.  Earlestown's record of 1 win in its 5 fixtures (in which it had conceded 21 goals) was taken over by second division side Heywood United, and Barnoldswick was elected to the second to fill the second division vacancy.\n\n\n== Colours ==\nThe club's original colours were blue and white, changing in 1886 to white jerseys with what was described as a red Maltese cross on the right breast, although photographic evidence shows it to have been a cross pattée.\nThe club retained the design until at least 1902, and by 1905 had changed to light blue shirts.\n\n\n== Ground ==\nThe club played at The Mesnes, originally using the Sunbeam Inn for facilities.\n\n\n== Notable players ==\nTom Bradshaw\nAndrew Gara\nArthur Gee\nOwen Jones\nFred Valentine\n\n\n== Honours ==\nLiverpool Senior Cup\nWinner: 1884–85\nRunner-up: 1883–84, 1888–89\n\n\n== External links ==\nLancashire Combination until 1909\nLancashire Combination 1909–25\n\n\n== References ==",

Laveroni spent forty years as a coach, including six seasons with the Seattle Seahawks.\n\n\n== College playing career ==\nLaveroni was a three-year starter for California at center (1967–69), where he earned a degree in criminology.\n\n\n== Coaching career ==\nIn 1972, Laveroni became an assistant coach at St. Ignatius High, remaining there until 1976. He then became head coach at Piedmont High for one year before joining the college ranks. He coached linebackers and tight ends at his alma mater, California, before leaving for Utah State to coach the linebackers and offensive line from 1979 to 1982. Laveroni returned to California and coached the offensive line from 1983 to 1989, before leaving for San Jose State to coach the offensive line and special teams from 1990 to 1992.

He then joined the Arena League's San Jose SaberCats, coaching there for one season before starting a five-year career at Rutgers where he served as offensive line coach and run game coordinator (1996–2000). After Rutgers, he coached the Vanderbilt offensive line for a year before taking his first NFL job with the Seattle Seahawks. Laveroni was named assistant offensive line coach on April 2, 2002, and was promoted in 2004 after the retirement of longtime NFL offensive line coach Tom Lovat. During Laveroni's tenure as offensive line coach, the Seahawks won 4 division titles and played in Super Bowl XL. Following his time in Seattle, Laveroni worked as offensive line coach with the Florida Tuskers and Virginia Destroyers of the United Football League. Afterwards, he coached the Sacramento State offensive line for three seasons.\n\n\n== References ==",

Among the most powerful positions in Belarus since its 2024 establishment, the chairman is entrusted with overseeing the activities of the ABPA and its Presidium. The current Chairman of the All-Belarusian People's Assembly is Alexander Lukashenko, who has held the position since its establishment on 24 April 2024 and is constitutionally mandated to hold the position until 2035.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe All-Belarusian People's Assembly was established in 1996. As a result of a 2022 constitutional referendum, the results of which were neither regarded as free nor fair, the ABPA was established as the \"highest representative organ of the people's government of the Republic of Belarus\", with the appointment of members scheduled for 2024. The newly constituted ABPA held its first meeting, the ABPA's seventh in total, on 24 April 2024, at which Lukashenko was appointed Chairman of the ABPA.\nLukashenko's appointment was widely rejected and ridiculed in independent media, with journalist Juryj Drakachurst referring to it as a \"second coronation\".\n\n\n== Selection and authority ==\nIn line with a presidential decree adopted by Lukashenko, the Chairman of the ABPA is one of leading state positions, alongside the offices of President, Prime Minister, the heads of the Supreme and Constitutional courts, and the head of the Security Council, among other positions. The position is elected by a secret ballot of all delegates to the ABPA.\nThe Chairman of the ABPA has the authority to remove the president for violations of the Constitution of Belarus, as well as to override any legal acts by the Belarusian government which are viewed by the Chairman as contradicting Belarusian national security. The sole exception to this is legal judgements handed down by courts. Belsat TV argued that while the chairman's position is constitutionally not as strong as that of the presidency, it is de facto the strongest position in the country, particularly in a hypothetical instance where the presidency is held by someone besides Lukashenko.\n\n\n== References ==",

In the 1970s, he was among the major representatives of the Pittura analitica ('analytic painting') art movement.\nPinelli's art was characterized by aniconism,  and after the series \"Topologie\" and \"Monocromi\", starting from the second half of the 1970s his art focused on fragmentation. A key role in his art was given to perception, intended as 'part and parcel of an indivisible sensory and psychic totality that is at the origins of our emotional as well as our rational response to images and what they suggest', and an important function was given to the often unusual choice of materials.\nActive until his later years, Pinelli died in Milan on 30 April 2024, at the age of 85.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "The Altai Gold Rush, a mountain range in Siberia whose name comes from a Turko-Mongolian word meaning \"gold coin\" (cf. Altun), peaked in the middle of the CE.19th century, after having begun in the previous century, when silver deposits were also exploited for their gold content.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Ore Altai is found mainly in the region between the Tcharysh and Irtysh rivers. For precious metals, the Altai, considered the natural southern limit of Siberia, has two mineralogical regions. The Nerchinsk, with its gold-bearing sands, had silver mines in operation since the years 1720, penalized by the extreme poverty of the ore and worked by populations of the Finnish race, on the extreme borders of Siberia and then exploited by Akenfi Demidoff. That of the Alataou mountains, where gold mining is much more recent, sees its expansion date back only to 1830.\n\"A considerable quantity of gold and silver from the mines of Siberia, the region of Nerchinsk and the mountains of Altai] arrived by the last sledges,\" says the Gazette de France of April 4, 1772, taking news from St. Petersburg, Gold and silver from the mines of Siberia, the region of Nerchinsk and the mountains of Altai]\"'. Their greatest prosperity was reached around 1765, and it was gold that was sought at the beginning of the following century, by the chemical dissolution of silver, mined in Kbolivano-Voskressenski, and in the vicinity of Nerchinsk, where 12 mines annually supply 3000 poods (one pud represents 16 kilos) in 1838, i.e. 48 tons of silver. The Altai, a word which means \"the golden mountain range\" in Turko-Mongolian, is also found in rich mines at Schlangenberg, Smeinogorsk, Ridderski and Syrianowski. This Altai gold rush was followed by a Ural Gold Rush, which lasted a little longer.\nIn 1829, the German naturalist, geographer and explorer Alexander von Humboldt led a scientific expedition to the Altai, in order to study terrestrial magnetism and geology. Organized by the Emperor of Russia, it counted among its members the scientist Plato of Chihatcheff, (1802–1892), author thirteen years later of the first two ascents of the Pic d'Aneto, summit of the Pyrenees The exploitation of the gold districts of the Altai was then shared between individuals and the Russian crown. By reserving for itself the western side of the chain, the latter has handed over the eastern side to the efforts of private industry. The 20% to 25% duty levied for the benefit of the Tsar of Russia, however, encourages some of the gold extracted to be concealed, as much as possible: only a fifth of the production is declared, according to an engineer's estimate.\nAlexander von Humboldt calculated that the gold production of the whole of Russia accelerated between 1823 and 1838, thanks to the mines of the Altai, with an average of 15.2 tons of gold per year. In 1836, 293 golden poods (one pood is equal to about 16 kilograms) came from the Urals and 104 poods from the Altai. The following year, in 1837, the Altai gave 160 golden poods and the Ural 309 poods. In 1844, layers of gold sand of the same type as those of the Urals were discovered in the Altai, the production of which was distributed to the east by the Popof house, which specialized in the trade of Inner Asia. As a result, in 1845, the Urals yielded only 5 tons of gold and the Altai 16 tons. The year 1847 was the peak of gold production in Russia. The Mining Administration shows a figure of 28.5 tons for the combined results of the Ural and Altai.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Lesley Moreland is an English author whose book published in 2001 detailed her experience following the murder of her daughter Ruth in 1990. Moreland is notable for her resolve to meet the man who killed her daughter and for her correspondence with an American man on Death Row in Texas.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMoreland's daughter Ruth was murdered in 1990 when she was 23 years of age. Moreland's book, An Ordinary Murder, tells the painful story of what happened to her and her family in the period following Ruth's murder. She reveals her struggle to find ways of continuing to live positively while accepting Ruth's death. An Ordinary Murder also provides an insight into the bureaucracies of the criminal justice system and Moreland's struggle to uncover the facts surrounding her daughter's death and her battle to meet with the man who murdered her daughter.\nThe book details Moreland's resolve and ultimate jailhouse meeting with her daughter's killer, Andrew Steel (not his real name) in 1995. Steel was a friend of Ruth's former boyfriend. He had a history of violence towards women, and had taken LSD before he stabbed Ruth to death, inflicting over 100 wounds. By meeting the man who murdered her daughter, Moreland sought to discover more about his life and background, believing that she could only find peace by having him answer questions about the circumstances surrounding the final moments of her daughter's life.\nFor 6 years, Moreland also regularly corresponded with Michael Richard, a Death Row inmate in Texas, who was convicted of an unrelated murder. Moreland was a committed Quaker, and her exchange with Richard, was influenced by her personal faith and conviction that there is humanity in everyone, even the most condemned criminal. This correspondence was part of a wider letter-writing network established by LifeLines of Cambridge, that connected Britons with death row inmates, as part of a program that was opposed to capital punishment in the United States. Moreland stated in an interview that \"Michael and I have slowly established a relationship that is deep and honest...I hope I would have been interested in writing to someone in his situation anyway, but after Ruth's death what I was trying to cling onto was the fact {that} human beings are very complex, and even if someone has taken a life, it's not the whole of them. There is that of God within all of us.\"\nA reviewer of An Ordinary Murder stated that \"The need to explore the potential value of restorative justice to the long-term health of the victims left behind could scarcely have been better illustrated.\"\nIn another book, Death, Dying and Bereavement, which includes a chapter by Moreland, the editors note that Lesley's \"thoughts and experience following the murder of her daughter provide insight into a particularly traumatic form of sudden death.\"\nAt the time of Ruth's death Moreland lived in Potters Bar, Hertfordshire with her husband Vic. They had one other daughter. Prior to writing An Ordinary Murder Moreland had a role as the Director of the Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Society (SANDS) as well as working in the voluntary sector for over 30 years.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nMoreland, Lesley (2001).

Ong Poh Lim was once again stalwart, winning his match at third singles and both of his doubles partnered by veteran Ooi Teik Hock. The Danes could muster only one victory which came in doubles and largely from the efforts of Kobbero's partner Jorgen Hammergaard Hansen whose powerful smash lived up to his name.

        "content": "The Ural Gold Rush, which preceded the California Gold Rush, peaked at about the same time, in the middle of the CE.19th century.\n\n\n== History ==\nHistorians believe that the world's first gold rush began when prospectors discovered gold and emeralds on the outskirts of the city of Yekaterinburg, in the Urals range, at the end of the 18th century. To the northeast of the city, in the foothills of the Urals, on both banks of the Berezovka River, are the most exploited gold ore veins of the 1840s, buried at a modest depth.\nIron and copper mines had been exploited for a very long time on a large scale in the Urals. As early as 1774, repairs to a machine in one of these mines, belonging to Klutchefsk, brought to light a deposit of gold-bearing sand, which was subjected to washing the following year. \"A strange, fantastic gold rush was organized during the first 50 years of the 19th century,\" says the historian Fernand Braudel in Material Civilization, Economy and Capitalism - 15th century - 13th century (page 577). This gold had found its first outlets in France in the previous century]. Russia is gradually becoming an exporter, whereas it had previously imported precious metals. The Ural Gold Rush was contemporaneous with the 1828 Georgia Gold Rush but grew larger and lasted longer. As early as 1824, 15 mines in the Urals produced 206 gold poods (one pood is equal to 16 kilos) or more than 3.3 tons of gold, a quantity that had already increased by 40% in 1827.\nIn 1842, a block of gold of 36 kilos of gold was found near Miass, a city in the Urals created in 1773, for the extraction of copper\". Gold production in this locality reached 640 kg per year before decreasing. The Altai Gold Rush, even further east, in Siberia, took over. The year 1847 was the peak of gold production in Russia. The mining administration shows a figure of 28.5 tons of gold for the Ural and Altai combined. In both cases, the alluvium is much richer in gold on the eastern slope.\nThe main architect of the extraction, which was carried to an industrial level, was Ivan Dmitrievich Astashev (1796-1869).\nSecondly, the degrowth is entirely about the wealth of Siberia, both eastern and western. Not only has mining activity not decreased in the Urals, but it has even increased slightly. The mines of the Urals actually reached their peak in the time of Stalin. It was the reading of \"L'Or\", by Blaise Cendrars, that determined Stalin to try to reindustrialize the Urals. The Urals then retained a significant production of gold, which however decreased from 1989 to 1991, from 285 tons to 250 tons and then fell to about a hundred tons of gold per year after 2010.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nGold mining\n\n\n== References ==",

The commercial law firm Görg, including an insolvency administrator, has leased floors 20–23 as well as partial areas on the 19th and 25th floors. A real estate company and an online marketing company moved in above the 25th floor. A Skybar was supposed to open on the 33rd floor, but this has not yet happened.\nThe developer, the US company RFR Holding, sold the high-rise in November 2017 to Signa Holding, the real estate and trading company founded by René Benko, whose Berlin office is located on the 31st and 32nd floors.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of tallest buildings in Berlin\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWeb-archive (Website) [1]\nskyscrapercenter.com [2]",

        "content": "Dibranchus tremendus is a species of marine ray-finned fish belonging to the family Ogcocephalidae, the deep-sea batfishes. It is found in deep water in the Atlantic Ocean. This species was identified as a different species from Dibranchus atlanticus in 1999. It is the largest species in its genus.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nDibranchus tremendus was first formally described in 1999 by the American ichthyologist Margaret G. Bradbury with its type locality given as the Caribbean Sea at 9°32'N, 76°38'W, Oregon II, station 11239, depth 1,463 m (4,800 ft). In her paper Bradbury states that Louis Roule illustrated this species, as Dibranchus atlanticus from Cape Verde in 1916. The genus Dibranchus is classified within the \"Indo-Pacific clade\" of the family Ogcocephalidae. The family Ogcocephalidae is classified in the monotypic suborder Ogcocephaloidei within the order Lophiiformes, the anglerfishes in the 5th edition of Fishes of the World.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nDibranchus tremendus is classified in the genus Dibranchus, a name which prefixes di, meaning \"two\", on to branchus, meaning \"gills\", a reference to the only the second and third gill arches having gills, the fourth having no gill filaments. The specific epithet tremenduus, means \"something to be trembled at\", an allusion to the large size and spiny skin of this fish.\n\n\n== Description ==\nDibranchus tremendus has its dorsal spine supported by between 4 and 7 soft rays and its anal fin by 4 soft rays. The tubercles in the skin do not have the radiating rows of spinules that those of D. atlanticus have. The spines of the tubercles are very long and robust, especially on the sides of the caudal peduncle. The lower surface of the disc shaped body is covered in tubercles. The main tubercles of the lower surface of the caudal peduncle are very large and take up the entire lowe surface except for a few small tubercles in the middle part between the anus and the base of the anal fin. The overall colour is brown. This species is the largest species in the genus Dibranchus with a maximum publsihed total length of 19.2 cm (7.6 in).\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nDibranchus tremendus is found in the Atlantic Ocean. In the western Atlantic is is found in the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, it has also been recorded from the Hydrographer Canyon, south of Hudson Canyon, from close to Block Canyon and the Bear Seamount. In the eastern Atlantic it has been recorded in Cape Verde and between the Gulf of Guinea and Namibia. This benthic fish is found at depths between 750 and 3,000 m (2,460 and 9,840 ft), typically in excess of 1,000 m (3,300 ft).\n\n\n== Biology ==\nDibranchus tremendus, like its congeners, has pelagic eggs and larvae. Deep sea batfishes are sit and wait predators, luring prey with the illicium, the \"fishing rod\", and esca, the \"lure\" or \"bait\", to within striking distance of the large mouth. The fishes in this family are known to feed on small snails, clams, scallops, worms, small crustaceans and occasionally small fishes. Ogcocephalidae fishes do have a luminous esca , as in some other groups of anglerfishes, but also secretes a fluid thought to act as a chemical lure which attracts prey.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ethical idealism, which is also referred to by terms such as moral idealism, principled idealism, and other expressions, is a philosphical framework based on holding onto specifically defined ideals in the context of facing various consequences to holding such principles and/or values. Such ideals, which are analyzed during the process of ethical thinking, become applied in practice via a group of specific goals relative to what has been learned over time about morality. As noted by philosopher Norbert Paulo, following ideals in a doctrinaire fashion will \"exceed obligations\" put on people such that actions \"are warranted, but not strictly required.\" \nWith certain philosophical movements throughout history emphasizing various types of moral idealism, such as influences being a part of Christian ethics, Jewish ethics, and Platonist ethics, it relates to human decision making as differing alternatives get compared and contrasted. Advocates for ethical idealism, such as the philosopher Nicholas Rescher, have asserted that inherent mental concepts shared in terms of the human condition among multiple peoples have a real, tangible nature due to their influences turning logical thinking into action, particularly by stimulating peoples' sense of motivation. In contrast, skeptical philosophers, such as the philosopher Richard Rorty, have argued that the complex course of recorded history has shown that \"to do the right thing is largely a matter of luck\" and particularly is due to \"being born in a certain place and a certain time.\"\n\n\n== Definitions and general background ==\nA range of philosophical movements throughout history have emphasized moral idealism, with this including the doctrine influencing Christian ethics, Jewish ethics, and Platonist ethics. This has occurred in the context of an underlying argument about morality in which, as one scholar has put it, certain thinkers have postulated \"an underlying sense of right and wrong that is common to all human beings at all times and places\". Ongoing debates on whether or not these kinds of inherent mental concepts truly exist have been called a \"great divide in contemporary philosophy\".\nA mental framework based on holding onto specifically defined ideals weighs them in the context of facing various consequences to holding such principles and/or values. An ideal placed under intellectual analysis become applied in practice via a group of specific goals relative to what has been learned over time about moral thinking. As noted by Austrian philosopher Norbert Paulo, following ideals in a doctrinaire fashion will \"exceed obligations\" put on people such that actions \"are warranted, but not strictly required.\"\nAmerican scholar Nicholas Rescher has stated that metaphysics comes into play when analyzing such a philosophical viewpoint about human thinking given that nature of ideals gives them a particular status as \"useful fictions\", with this developing in terms of their special existence relative to the broader concept of ethical choice. He has described a worldview coming into focus via logical thinking based on moral idealism that he has defined in depth, remarking that \"it [is] rational to strive for the unattainable\" and that a \"practicality\" exists in \"seriously pursuing impossible dreams.\"\nWriting in his book Ethical Idealism: An Inquiry Into the Nature and Function of Ideals, Rescher specifically argued,\n\n\"The 'reality' of an ideal lies not in its substantive realization in some separate domain but in its formative impetus upon human thought and action in this imperfect world. The object at issue with an ideal does not, and cannot, exist as such. What does, however, exist is the idea of such an object. Existing, as it must, in thought alone (in the manner appropriate to ideas), it exerts a powerful[ly] organizing and motivating force on our thinking, providing at once a standard of appraisal and [also] a stimulus to action.\"\nOther thinkers have asserted that ideals as such constitute things that ought to be said to exist in the real world, having a substance partly to the same extent as human beings and similarly physical entities. A prominent example of this philosophical take is the ancient Greek intellectual figure of Plato. To him, ideals represented self-contained objects existing in their own domain that humanity discovered through reason rather than invented out of whole cloth for narrow benefit. Thus, while existing in relation to the human mind, ideals still possessed a certain kind of metaphysical independence according to Plato. Labeled later on as an ethical idealist, Plato saw these applied moral views as significantly influential on one's life course.\nWith respect to how exactly human reason should work, American philosopher Ralph Barton Perry defined idealistic morality as being the result of a particular attitude about the act of attaining knowledge itself, writing in his book The Moral Economy,\n\n\"Moral idealism means to interpret life consistently with ethical, scientific, and metaphysical truth. It endeavors to justify the maximum of hope, without compromising or confusing any enlightenment judgement of truth. In this it is, I think, not only consistent with the spirit of a liberal and rational age but also with the primary motive of religion. There can be no religion... without an open and candid mind as well as an indomitable purpose.\"\nIn a keynote speech given in August 2005, American scholar Richard Rorty remarked upon morally idealistic philosophy in the context of strictly specified principles through the lens of his views on applied ethics, asserting to a group of business professionals,\n\n\"[I]ndividuals become aware of more alternatives, and therefore wiser, as they grow older. The human race as a whole has become wiser as history has moved along. The source of these new alternatives is the human imagination. It is the ability to come up with new ideas, rather than the ability to get in touch with unchanging essences, that is the engine of moral progress.\"\nRorty has argued that the complex course of recorded history has shown that \"to do the right thing is largely a matter of luck\", with standards of morality being far from broadly universal and instead coming fundamentally from \"being born in a certain place and a certain time.\" He has highlighted the disconnect between intellectual ability and other elements related to personal character, noting for instance the clarity of vision and rhetorical skill used by historical actors such as those in Nazi Germany. In Rorty's opinion, humanity as a whole has advanced at an ethical level due to gradual progress via both technological change and social advancement.\n\n\n== Historical evolution of moral idealism ==\nGerman philosopher Immanuel Kant's particular view of human nature and intellectual inquiry, later summed up as \"Kantianism\", stressed the inherent power of logical thinking in terms of moral analysis. Kant's advocacy for the \"categorical imperative\", a doctrine through which every individual choice has to be made with the consideration of the decider that it ought to be a universally held maxim, took place in the broader context of his metaphysical views. In Kant's writings, defiance of higher principles was not only wrong in a practical sense but in a fundamentally rational and thus moral sense as well.\nAll of that has resulted in Kant's intellectual framework being described as a philosophy of moral idealism by later scholars such as Nicholas Rescher. The latter thinker wrote that at a fundamental level Kant had understood that expressing an ideal meant applying \"a regulative principle of reason\" that commands one's mind to thus use logical thinking in painting a mental landscape \"as if certain 'idealized' conditions could be realized\". As a matter of working out intellectual concepts, Kant asserted the notion that \"ought\" implies \"can\", which as an argument has long attracted controversy and debate among philosophers.\nWorks authored by Kant on these overall subjects include the initial publication The Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals followed by The Critique of Practical Reason, The Metaphysics of Morals, Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View, Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason, the latter commentaries developing the intellectual figure's thinking. Within the pages of Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View in particular, the philosopher articulated a vision of people as by their very essence driven by meaningful ethics. Through the lens of Kant's doctrine, no ironclad divide has existed between morality and the natural world, with empirical analysis of human psychology dovetailing with studies of people's ideals.\nThe philosopher's metaphysics tied closely with his socio-political views and belief in fundamental advancement, such that Kant wrote inside of the pages of the Critique of Pure Reason in detail,\n\n\"What the highest level might be at which humanity may have to come to rest, and how great a gulf may still be left between the idea [of perfection] and its realization, are questions which no one can, or ought to answer. For the matter depends upon freedom; and it is in the very nature of freedom to pass beyond any and every specified limit.\"\nEvaluating Kant's method of turning ideal-based standards into a broader ethical framework in context, scholar Frederick P. Van De Pitte has written about the primacy of rationality to the philosopher, with Pitte remarking,\n\n\"Kant realized that man's rational capacity alone is not sufficient to constitute his dignity and elevate him above the brutes. If reason only enables him to do for himself what instinct does for the animal, then it would indicate for man no higher aim or destiny than that of the brute but only a different way of attaining the same end. However, reason is man's most essential attribute because it is the means by which a truly distinctive dimension is made possible for him. Reason, that is, reflective awareness, makes it possible to distinguish between good and bad, and thus morality can be made the ruling purpose of life. Because man can consider an array of possibilities, and which among them is the most desirable, he can strive to make himself and his world into a realization of his ideals.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External link ==\nTypes of philosophical idealism",

        "content": "Sir John Blencowe (1642 – May 1726) was an English judge and politician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBlencowe was born in 1642 at the manor of Marston St. Lawrence, on the Oxfordshire border of Northamptonshire. The family came originally from Greystock, in Cumberland, but this estate was granted to one Thomas Blencowe in the time of Henry VI. Fifth in descent from him was Thomas, father of John Blencowe, who married as his second wife Anne, daughter of the Rev. Dr. Francis Savage of Ripple in Worcestershire. John was educated at Oriel College, Oxford, with which his family was connected. A Blencowe was an early benefactor of the college, and Anthony Blencowe, D.C.L., was provost from 1572 to 1617. He was entered a student of the Inner Temple in 1663, called to the bar 1673, elected a master of the bench in 1687, received the degree of serjeant-at-law 11 April 1689, and represented Brackley in Northamptonshire for five years in the parliament of 1690, being a firm adherent of the government. He married Anne, eldest daughter of Dr. John Wallis, Savilian professor of geometry in Oxford. To this marriage Blencowe in part owed his advancement ; for when the deanery (or bishopric, according to Granger) of Hereford was offered to Dr. Wallis he declined it, and asked a favour for his son-in-law, saying, 'I have a son-in-law, Mr. Serjeant Blencowe, of the Inner Temple, a member of parliament, an able lawyer, and not inferior to many of those on the bench, of a good life and great integrity, cordial to the government, and serviceable to it.' Accordingly, on 17 September 1696, Blencowe was raised to the bench as a baron of the exchequer, in the room of Sir John Turton. He was removed to the king's bench on 18 January 1697, and knighted and transferred to the common pleas 20 November 1714. Although Baker, Noble, and others speak of him as in the queen's bench from 1702 to 1714, and Luttrell (v. 183) says it was intended to remove him at the beginning of Queen Anne's reign, still Lord Raymond's law reports never speak of him as sitting in the queen's bench, but speak of him as in the common pleas, both at Anne's accession and George I's (Ld. Raymond, 769, 1317). He may then have passed directly from the exchequer to the common pleas. In 1718 he is concurring with other judges in favour of the king's prerogative to control the marriage and education of the royal family. He retired on a pension on 22 June 1722 at the age of eighty, and died May 1726, and was buried at Brackley. Before his death his faculties had decayed; he conceived he had discovered the longitude, and employed his son William in copying his writings to lay before parliament. He is described as being an honest, blunt, and kindly man, but of no great qualifications. He had a large family: John, his heir; Thomas, afterwards a bencher of the Inner Temple, from whom springs the family of Blencowe of Bincham, near Lewes: William; Mary, who married Alexander Prescott, of Tlioby Priory, in Essex; Anne, who married in 1720 Sir E. Probyn, of Newlands, chief baron of the exchequer; Elizabeth; and Susannah, who married R. Jennens, of Princethorp. His third son William, born Jan. 1682–3, was the decipherer.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Hamilton, John Andrew (1886). \"Blencowe, John\".

        "content": "The Theban Tomb TT88 is located in Sheikh Abd el-Qurna and is part of the Theban Necropolis, on the west bank of the Nile, opposite to Luxor. It is the burial place of the ancient Egyptian official Amenemhab, also called Mahu (that is a short version of his name) who lived in the 18th Dynasty. \n\n\n== Family ==\nAmenemhab bears several military titles, that include overseer of the troops of the lord of the two lands (lord of the two Lands is the Egyptian king), deputy of the king in the big army and  head of the bowmen. His wife was a lady called Baki. Several children are known. They include the sons Iamu and Meri and the daughter Nebet-nehet.\n\n\n== Tomb ==\nThe tomb complex consists of a decorated tomb chapel, carved into the Theban rocks and the underground, undecorated burial chambers, that were found looted. The funerary chapel consists of two broad halls, the first one with four pillars. There is a long corridor at the end leading to a statue niche.\nThe chapel was once fully decorated with paintings, but they are today much destroyed. The scenes are showing events from the life of Amenemhab, but also religious scenes connected to the Underworld. On the right North wall of the first hall, there is Amenemhab shown in front of king Thutmose III. Much of the scene is destroyed, but in the upper half is a long biographical inscription and on the very right side appear many Syrians bringing gifts to the king. The biographical inscription reports how Amenemhab went with king Thutmose III on his Syrian campaign to conquer those regions. While the king was hunting there, an elephant attacked Thutmose III and Amenemhab proudly reports how he killed the elephant and saved the king's life. On the left of the North wall, there was once a similar scene, but only a few figures are preserved. A remarkable scene appears on the lintel between the two middle pillars. Here Amenemhab is shown hunting, in front of a big hyena.\nIn the second hall appear scenes connected with funerary rituals.. On left short end, the underworld god Osiris is shown, while on the opposite short end, Amenemhab is shown on a boat and hunting in the marshes. Another scene, on the right North wall shows a big banquet with several rows of guests and musicians. \nOn the left wall of the inner corridor is shown the burial procession, with the coffin and mummy of Amenemhab and many priests and offerings. The opposite wall of the corridor shows Amenemhab and his wife in front of a garden and in front of people bring offerings.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Theban tombs\n\n\n== Literature ==\nHeike  Heye (2023).

        "content": "The AVIC AS700-class of airships (otherwise known as the Xiangyun-class which translates to auspicious clouds) is a class of non-rigid airships built for commercial and tourism use. It is developed and built by AVIC as its first attempt in the civilian airship market.\n\n\n== Design and development ==\nThe AS700 is a medium-sized blimp that is around 48 meters (158 ft) long, a height of 12 meters (39 ft) and a total volume of around 3,500 m3 (123,600 ft3). It is powered by helium like all modern airships.\nThe AS700 has an ellipsoid hull, with a rigid tail configuration done in an \"X\" positioning rather than the traditional \"+\" positioning. The design is considered as a light and cost-effective capsule-shaped airship. The tail has flight control surfaces to allow in ease in steering. The gondola of the airship possess a non-retractable single-point landing gear under the rear which creates a center of gravity that gives the AS700 stability when being ferried on the ground.\nAs a non-rigid airship, the AS700's envelope is a single lift gas cell manufactured from a multi-layer fabric-film laminate composite material that provides the needed strength, low helium leak rate, tear and weather resistance. Within the outer envelope, the airship possess ballonets for pitch control. The ballonets are made from lightweight polymer cells which is equipped with helium safety valves to prevent over-pressurization and to allow for a safe landing in the event of maneuvering system failure.\nThe AS700 feature modern fly-by-wire flight control systems with advanced avionics, with the gondola being big enough to house a single pilot alongside 9 passengers and can be configured with a food service facility and a washroom. The large windows are designed to open in flight. Pilot controls are done with a side stick controller, which makes the blimp easy to operate. It can also be configured for unmanned operations.\nAn interesting aspect of the AS700 is its thrust-vectoring features. The blimp possess modern thrust vectoring propulsion systems that allows the AS700 to do both STOL and VTOL operations. The maximum takeoff weight is 4,150 kg with the maximum range being 700 km. Likewise, its maximum flight time is recorded to be 10 hours and is capable of achieving a maximum speed of a 100 km/hr. Since it is a civilian blimp, AVIC recommends that the airship to not fly under treacherous weather conditions such as thunderstorms, snowstorms, heavy fog or lightning.\n\n\n== Overview and history ==\nThe AS700 is designed largely for civilian usage, specifically, in the tourism sector. The project first began in August 2018. According to the project manager of the AS700, Du Wei, he stated that the airship's market is built in line with China's consumption transformation and upgrading needs. Specifically for low-altitude sightseeing and tourism as well as potentially expanding the ship's services to emergency rescue, urban public services and other fields.\nCurrently, three prototypes were built. The first was an unmanned platform that flew in October 2022 as a technological demonstrator. The second and third prototypes were manned vehicles tasked in completing various tests to ensure safety checks. The second prototype made its maiden flight in Hubei on the 29 December 2022. The flight lasted 39 minutes. On the 13 December 2023, the Civil Aviation Administration of China issued a type certificate for the AS700, making it the first manned airship in China to be domestically developed and certified. The third prototype successfully made its maiden voyage on April 2, 2024, in Hubei province again. The flight took one hour and 46 minutes.\nAVIC estimates that there is a market demand for 100 airships of this type over the next 10 years, but currently, it has only received orders of around 18-20 copies which should delivered by the end of 2024.\n\n\n== Specifications ==\nGeneral characteristics\n\nCrew: ca. 1 pilot\nCapacity: ca. 9 passengers\nLength: 48 m (158 ft 0 in)\nDiameter: 12 m (39 ft 0 in)\nVolume: 3,500 m3 (123,600 cu ft)\nUseful lift: 4,150 kg (9,149 lb)\nPowerplant: 2 × Lycoming IO-390-C3B6 aviation piston engines , 160 kW (215 hp) each\nPerformance\n\nMaximum speed: 100 km/h (62 mph, 54 kn)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Max Moreau (1902–1992) was a Belgian painter. He worked mainly in North Africa and in southern Spain, specialising in portraiture. He died in Granada in 1992, bequeathing his entire estate to the city. His home in the Albaicín is now a museum commemorating his life and work, the Carmen de los Geranios, Centro Cultural Max Moreau.\n\n\n== Life and works ==\nMax Leo Moreau was born in Soignies, Belgium on 2 September 1902, the son of an artist. Entirely self-taught, although he did receive training in draughtsmanship from his father, at the end of World War I Moreau moved with his family to Paris where he gained employment as a set designer and formed a life-long friendship with the actor and director, Denis d'Inès. In 1928 Moreau married Félicie Leclercq, and the next year they travelled to Tunisia, beginning a lifelong mutual appreciation of the Moorish culture of North Africa and southern Spain. They lived in France during World War II, and at its end travelled extensively in Morocco, the Caribbean, America and Europe, with Moreau frequently painting portraits of the leading members of the social circles in which they found themselves. In 1966, they settled in Granada, Spain, purchasing a property in the historic Albaicín district, the Carmen de los Geranios (House of the Geraniums). The house was dilapidated at the time of their purchase, and the Moreaus devoted much time and effort to its reconstruction.\nIn addition to his society portraiture, from which he earned a great deal of money, Moreau specialised in Realist portraits of the inhabitants of the Northern Africa cities he visited, and of Granada, where he finally settled. Moreau held his last exhibition in 1981 and his final decade was marred by Parkinson's disease.\nMoreau died in 1992, on the day of his birth, 2 September, at the age of 90. He bequeathed his entire estate to the city of Granada. His home is now a museum dedicated to his life and works, the Centro Cultural Max Moreau. The museum opened in 1998 and consists of the painter's house, accommodation for his housekeeper, his study/studio, gardens and an orchard. His studio contains a permanent exhibition of some of the best examples of his work.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nNoble, Isabella; Clark, Gregor (2019).

According to  Hanshu, Yuyuan is in a sea in the Southern extremities and borders the world of evil. Jinshu wrote \"Can I not climb to the sea and restrain the east-flowing water, and visit Yuquan and invoke the day of returning to the west?\nYuquan has also captured the imagination of many Chinese poets and writers. For example, the poet Liu Zongyuan wrote  \"Did you know Kuafu chased the sun to the point he could peek in Yuyuan?\" in his poem Xinglunan 行路难. Li Shangyin also wrote \"Xihe drives his solar chariot until resting at Yuquan, never letting the sun turn around towards the East.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "George Thicknesse (1714 – 18 December 1790) was an English schoolmaster.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nThicknesse was the  third son of John Thicknesse, rector of Farthinghoe in Northamptonshire. He was born in 1714. His mother, Joyce Blencowe, was niece of Sir John Blencowe. Philip Thicknesse, lieutenant-governor of Landguard Fort, was a younger brother. George Thicknesse entered Winchester College in 1726. In 1737 he was appointed chaplain (third master) of St. Paul's school, in 1745 surmaster, and in 1748 high master. The school, which had been declining in his predecessor's time, flourished under his rule. Philip Francis, the reputed author of ‘Junius,’ was one of his scholars. In 1759 he suffered for a time from mental derangement (Gent. Mag. 1814, ii. 629), but did not retire from his office till 1769, when the governors of St. Paul's awarded him a pension of 100l. a year, and requested him to name his successor.\nThicknesse, on his retirement, resided with an old schoolfellow, William Holbech, at Arlescote, near Warmington, Northamptonshire, till the death of the latter in 1771. He himself died, unmarried, on 18 December 1790, and was buried on the north side of Warmington churchyard, in accordance with somewhat singular directions which he had given (ib. p. 412). A marble bust of him by John Hickey, with an inscription, the joint work of Sir Philip Francis and Edmund Burke, was placed in St. Paul's school by his pupils in 1792. The inscription is no longer extant (Notes and Queries, 8th ser. ix. 148).\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Lupton, Joseph Hirst (1898). \"Thicknesse, George\".

        "content": "Yajnavalkya Jayanti ( Sanskrit: याज्ञवल्क्य जयंती ) is a Hindu festival to celebrate the birth anniversary of the Vedic sage Brahmarshi Yajnavalkya. It is celebrated on three to four different dates in different parts of the Indian Subcontinent according to the believes of the scholars in different communities.\n\n\n== Dates of Yajnavalkya Jayanti ==\nIn northern India, scholars believe that Yajnavalkya was born on the Phalgun Shukla Panchami. Some scholars believe Phalgun Krishna Panchmi as his birth date. Similarly in some parts of the subcontinent, scholars believe Kartika Shukla Dwadashi as his birth day. In Gujarat Yajnavalkya's birthday is considered to be on the seventh day in the month of Kartika.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAccording to Puranas , the Vedic Sage Yajnavalkya is considered to be an incarnation of Lord Brahma. So he is also called Brahmarshi. In Puranas there is a story related to the incarnation of Lord Brahma as the Brahmarshi Yajnavalkya. According to the story, when Lord Brahma gave place to Gayatri instead of his wife Savitri in a Yajna, then Savitri cursed him in anger due to which he was later born as Yajnavalkya in the house of a sage Charan. According to the Skanda Purana, Lord Brahma incarnated himself as Yajnavalkya in response to a curse from Lord Shiva.  According to Shrimad Bhagwat Purana, he was the son of Devarata. Being blessed with a son his father was also known as Devarata. He was born to Brahmaratha and Sunanda in the Kingdom of Mithila. His father Brahmaratha, also known as 'Vajasani' and 'Devarata', was an expert in the Vedas and his mother Devi Sunanda was the daughter of sage Sakala. His father was called as Vajasani because he used to donate food every day. Presently there is a place called as Yajnavalkya Ashram at Jagban village of Madhubani district in the Mithila region believed to be the location of residence place related to the sage Yajnavalkya. It is believed about him that in the seventh year he received education from his maternal uncle Vaishmpayana and memorized all the verses of the Vedas. Once when Vaishmpayana became angry with Yajnavalkya for a dispute, then Yajnavalkya was ordered to vomited out the Shrutis. Consequently young Yajnavalkya vomitted all the Shrutis learnt from his teacher Vaishmpayana. Then other sages and students present there took the beautiful Mantras in the form of partridges ( Tittiri ). This branch of Yajurveda came to be known as the Taittiriya Samhita. It is the part of Krishna Yajurveda. It is believed that he obtained his forgotten knowledge of Yajurveda by the grace of Lord Surya. After that he wrote  Shatapatha Brahmana, Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, Ishopanishad, Pratyekshasutra, Yajnavalkaya Smriti, Yoga Yajnavalkya etc , which are treasures of Hindu religion and culture. So Yajnavalkya is also considered as the father of the ancient Indian Philosophy. According to Matsya Purana, Yajnavalkya is referred the Gotrakar of the Vasishtha clan having name Yagyadutta. Similarly Yajnavalkya has been referred to as Kaushika in many texts including the Mahabharata.\n\n\n== Observances ==\nHis birth anniversary is celebrated every year with great reverence and devotion. On this occasion, prayers, worship and meetings are organized all over India and the texts written by Rishi Shrestha are recited. Also, people try to implement his teachings in their lives and guide themselves. The philosophy of Yajnavalkya is considered to be the philosophy of the soul. Yajnavalkya Jayanti is celebrated with great enthusiasm by the Brahmin communities in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh. It is also celebrated in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar.\nEvery year on the Phalgun Shukla Panchami, one day cultural program is organised at the campus of the Yajnavalkya Ashram in the Mithila region locally known as Yajnavalkya Mahotsava.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Kanzhun Limited (also referred to as Kanzhun and BOSS Zhipin; Chinese: 看准科技有限公司; pinyin: Kànzhǔn Kējì Yǒuxiàn Gōngsī) is a publicly listed Chinese human resources company that focuses on providing online recruitment services through its mobile app, BOSS Zhipin. \n\n\n== Background ==\nKanzhun was founded originally as a company review website. It later launched the mobile app, BOSS Zhipin which focused on the recruitment industry. This attracted notable investors such as Lei Jun, Neil Shen and Tencent that provided funding to the company.\nThe company grew quickly to become the largest online recruitment platform in China. By 2021, it had 100 million users and over 6 million partnering companies. The Boss Zhipin app made use of artificial intelligence to power its recommendation algorithm that would help match users’ work experience and qualifications with job listings. It also allowed direct connections between job seekers and employers.\nIn June 2021, Kanzhun held its initial public offering by becoming a listed company on the Nasdaq raising $912 million. On the first day of trading, its shares rose 96%.\nIn July 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) announced it would be conducting a cybersecurity review of Kanzhun related to its collection and use of personal information. As a result, Kanzhun's new user registration was halted. In June 2022, the CAC completed its review and Kanzhun rectified problems found during it. As a result, Kanzhun was approved to resume new user registration.\nIn December 2022, Kanzhun became a dual-listed company after it listed its shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Edward Parry Thornton (7 October 1811 – 10 December 1893) was a British administrator in India.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nThornton was born on 7 October 1811. He was the second son of John Thornton of Clapham by his wife Eliza, daughter of Edward Parry. Samuel Thornton was his grandfather. Edward was educated at Haileybury and Charterhouse, and obtained a writership in the Bengal civil service on 30 April 1830. On 2 August 1831 he was appointed assistant under the commissioner of revenue in the Goruckpore division, and on 6 October 1836 he became assistant to the magistrate and collector at Goruckpore. He returned to England on furlough early in 1842, and on proceeding again to India in 1845 was appointed joint magistrate and deputy collector at Muttra, and later in the same year chief magistrate and collector. In 1848 he was transferred in the same capacity to Serampore. In 1849, when Dalhousie was choosing the ablest Indian officials for the task of organising the Punjaub, Thornton was appointed a commissioner and placed at Rawul Pindi in the Jhelum division. In 1852 he distinguished himself by his promptitude and courage in arresting Nadir Khan, a discontented son of the raja of Mandla, who was endeavouring to promote a rising of the hill tribes. He received a bullet wound in the throat while executing his perilous mission, but had the satisfaction of preventing the rising. In May 1857, at the time of the mutiny, Lord Lawrence made Rawul Pindi his headquarters. Thornton was constantly with him, ably seconding his measures, and he afterwards gave interesting details of Lawrence's conduct at that anxious time, which have been preserved in Bosworth Smith's ‘Life of Lord Lawrence.’ After Lawrence had denuded the Punjaub of troops to assist in the operations against Delhi, Thornton was called on to exercise more independent authority. In the beginning of September 1857 the intelligence reached Lady Lawrence at Murri that the tribes in the lower Hazarah country contemplated revolt. She communicated the intelligence to Thornton, who succeeded in arresting the leaders of the conspiracy within a few hours, and by this prompt action prevented any attempt at rebellion. On the conclusion of the mutiny Thornton was appointed judicial commissioner for the Punjaub, and on 18 May 1860 he was made a companion of the Bath in recognition of his services. He retired from the Indian service in 1862.\nHe wrote ‘Illustrations of the History and Practices of the Thugs’ (1837, London, 8vo), ll. Thornton also contributed to the eighth edition of the ‘Encyclopædia Britannica’ the articles on Bombay, Bengal, Ganges, Nepaul, and, in conjunction with David Buchanan, those on Afghanistan and Burmah.\nThornton died in London at Warwick Square on 10 December 1893. In 1840 he married Louisa Chicheliana, the daughter of R. Chichely Plowden, by whom he had four sons and two daughters. One of his sons, Alfred Thornton, was a footballer.\nSeveral works, commonly attributed to Thornton, are by others of the same name. A Captain Thornton, R.N., was author of 'A Summary of the History of the East India Company' (London, 1833, 8vo). Edward Thornton (1799–1875), probably a cousin of Edward Parry Thornton, who was in the East India House from 1814 to 1857, and was head of the maritime department from 1847, wrote : 1. 'India: its State and Prospects,' London, 1835, 8vo; 2. 'Chapters of the Modern History of British India,' London, 1840, 8vo; 3. 'History of the British Empire in India,' London, 1841–5, 6 vols. 8vo (second edition, 1 vol., 1858); 4. 'Gazetteer of the Countries adjacent to India on the North-West,' London, 1844, 2 vols. 8vo; 5. 'Gazetteer of the Territories under the Government of the East India Company,' London, 1854, 4 vols. 8vo (other editions followed, the last, revised by Sir Roper Lethbridge and Mr. Arthur Naylor Wollaston, appearing in 1886).\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Carlyle, Edward Irving (1898). \"Thornton, Edward Parry\".

She became a deputy in the Assembly of the Republic in 2015 as a member of the Social Democratic Party (PSD) and was re-elected in 2019, 2022, and 2024. \n\n\n== Biography ==\nRocha was born on 8 June 1968. She obtained a degree in law and worked as a legal officer. Between the beginning of 2012 and March 2014, she was the director of the municipality of Gondomar, which is situated a short distance from Portugal's second city of Porto.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nRocha was first elected as a deputy to the Assembly of the Republic in 2015 on the PSD list of candidates to represent the Porto constituency. She was re-elected in 2019 and 2022. Following the resignation of the Socialist prime minister António Costa, after allegations of corruption against members of his government, the PSD formed an alliance with two smaller parties to fight the March 2024 election, known as the Democratic Alliance (AD). Rocha was third on the list of the 14 AD candidates elected for the constituency. Following this election she became vice-president of the Assembly's Education and Science Committee, having also previously served on the Environment, Spatial Planning, Decentralization, Local Government and Housing Committee.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sergei Raimondovich Treil (or Treil') (Сергей Раймондович Треиль) is a Russian mathematician, specializing in analysis.\nAt Leningrad State University (now named Saint Petersburg State University), Sergei R. Treil graduated in mathematics in 1982 with an M.Sc. and in 1985 with a Ph.D. His Ph.D. thesis, dealing with geometric aspects of Hankel operators and Toeplitz operators, was supervised by Nikolai Kapitonovich Nikolski. From 1986 to 1989 Treil was an assistant professor at the Baikonur branch of the Moscow Aviation Institute (MAI). From 1989 to 1991 he was a researcher at the laboratory of theoretical cybernetics at Leningrad University. In Michigan State University's department of mathematics, he was from 1991 to 1992 a visiting assistant professor, from 1992 to 1994 an assistant professor, from 1994 to 1998 he was an associate professor, and from 1998 to 1999 a full professor. In Brown University's department of mathematics, he was from 2000 to 2001 an associate professor and was appointed in 2001 a full professor. He was a visiting scholar in 1990 at the Mittag-Leffler Institute, where he worked with Alexandre Megretski of the KTH Royal Institute of Technology. Treil was in autumn 1998 a visiting professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology's department of electrical engineering and computer science.\nTreil has done important research in the intersection of operator theory, complex analysis, and harmonic analysis. Much of his research is on problems related to applied mathematics, such as control theory, stationary random processes, signal processing, and wavelets. His research interest include Hankel operators, Toeplitz operators, functional models of operators, spectral decompositions of operators, spectral theory of matrix- and operator-valued functions, the Corona problem, and the interplay between operator theory and complex geometry.\nIn 1993 Treil was awarded the Salem Prize. He wrote several papers with Alexander Volberg and Fedor Nazarov, who were his colleagues at Michigan State University. Volberg shared the 1988 Salem Prize with Jean-Christophe Yoccoz. Nazarov won the 1999 Salem Prize.  \n\n\n== Selected publications ==\nNazarov, F.; Treil, S.

        "content": "IC 310 is a lenticular galaxy located in the constellation Perseus. It is located 265 million light-years from Earth, which means, given its apparent dimensions, it is about 117,000 light-years across. The galaxy was discovered by Edward D. Swift on November 3, 1888. \n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nIC 310 is classified as a head-tail radio galaxy or specifically a narrow-angle tail radio galaxy described by Sijbring et at. 1998 and Feretti et at. 1998. IC 310 has an active nucleus (AGN) and seems to represent a low-luminosity FRI radio galaxy at the borderline angle which reveals its BL Lac-type central engine. \nAt the redshift of z = 0.0189, it is one of the brightest objects detected in the Perseus Cluster at both radio frequencies and X-ray energies, and also the fourth closest AGN detected in terms of VHE gamma rays after Centaurus A, Messier 87 (M 87), and 3C 84 known as NGC 1275 which belongs to same cluster. It shares the similar properties similar to M 87, which the emission can be traced to its blazar-like central engine but shows time variability and hard spectrum that is harder to the spectrum. \nIn addition, IC 310 is identified as a γ-ray emitter based on the observations at GeV energies with Fermi-LAT and with MAGIC telescopes at high energies (VHE, E > 100 GeV), making it a subject of curiosity since its nucleus displays blazar-like behavior.  According to further studies, it is suggested IC 310 is the closest blazar and key object for AGN research, due to the fact, a blazar-like radio jet has been found using parsec-scale VLBL imaging, together with the unusual flat gamma-ray spectrum and variable high-energy emission.  \nThere is a point-like emission in IC 310 according the XMM-Newton observation, without signs of the structure correlated with its radio halo tail. The temperature of the intracluster medium decreases as a function of distance from the cluster center from kT ~ 6 keV located northwest corner of the field to about 3 KeV in the southwest region. Although no shape edges found in the surface brightness profile, there is a brightness excess of a smooth β model by about 20% seen. There is an increase in temperature by 10% in the same region indicating the region in IC 310 is infalling into the Perseus Cluster. The gas in front of the galaxy is compressed as well, indicating the IC 310 system is undergoing a merger.   \n\n\n== Black hole ==\nA supermassive black hole inside IC 310 has been found to weigh over 300 million times the mass of the sun. According to an observation, over 250 million years ago, the high gamma-ray radiation left the vicinity of the black hole and reached Earth between the night of 12 and 13 November, 2012, which was observed by the pair of 17m diameter MAGIC Telescopes in La Plama.  \nThis shocked an impressively bright flare on the variability time scales on minutes reaching up average flux level in the night up to one Crab above 1 TeV with hard spectrum over the past 20 years in energy. It showed a series of strong outbursts from the intra-night light curve. This shows the fast variability that constrains the size of the gamma-ray emission regime, to shrink 20% of the gravitation radius from the black hole challenging shock acceleration models.\n\n\n== Group membership ==\nIC 310 belongs to the NGC 1275 group, which is part of the Perseus Cluster. Other members include NGC 1224, NGC 1267, NGC 1270, NGC 1273, NGC 1277, NGC 1279, IC 288, IC 294 and IC 312.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Dallas Penn (September 1970 – May 1, 2024) was an American fashion designer, sneaker head, musician and internet personality.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nPenn, a native of Queens, New York, was born in September 1970. Penn attended the Brooklyn Technical High School before being transfered to City-As-School High School. At City-As, he got an internship as an interior designer. Penn, according to Complex, was stealing cars at the time and would sometimes drive stolen vehicles to school.\n\n\n== Career ==\nPenn started his career in 1984. He gave up his hobby of collecting comic books to focus on fashion. He was said to have been a member of the Decepticons gang. He was also a member of the Lo Lifes Crew, a Brooklyn subculture who wore a considerable amount of Polo apparel. \nPenn was a co-host on the Combat Jack show. He was known for his early work in Hip Hop fashion and internet streaming.\n\n\n== Personal life and death ==\nPenn suffered from type 2 diabetes. He was married to Susan Pete. He died on May 1, 2024, at the age of 53. Rob Swift paid tribute to Penn, saying \"Some ... won’t realize how much of a trailblazer you were in Hip Hop... ...It was you who introduced me and many of my peers to internet streaming in the ‘90s. Thank you for your contributions to our culture. I’ll always remember your smile.\"  \n\n\n== Discography ==\n63/19 Album  - \"Rap Genius\" (ft. Lakutis, Dallas Penn, DVS, and Meyhem Lauren) (prod. Amaze 88)\n\n\n== References ==",

The pool standing procedure were as follows:\n\nNumber of matches won;\nMatch points;\nMatch won 3–0: 3 match points for the winner, 0 match points for the loser\nMatch won 3–1: 3 match points for the winner, 0 match point for the loser\nMatch won 3–2: 2 match points for the winner, 1 match points for the loser\nPoints ratio;\nSets ratio;\nIf the tie continues between two teams: result of the last match between the tied teams;\nIf the tie continues between three or more teams: a new classification would be made taking into consideration only the matches between involved teams.\nThe winners of each pool advanced directly to the semi-finals, while the runners-up and the third placed teams advanced to the quarter-finals.\n\n\n=== Groups composition ===\nTeams were distributed into two groups of four teams. As hosts, Guatemala had the right to choose the group in which to be placed and were assigned to the head of its group (Group B). The remaining teams were distributed into the groups according to their position in the NORCECA and CSV Continental Rankings (as of 1 January 2024) and following the serpentine system, starting with the highest-ranked NORCECA team as head of the remaining group (Group A)\n\n\n== Preliminary round ==\nAll match times are local times, GTT (UTC−6), as listed by NORCECA.\n\n\n=== Group A ===\n\n\n=== Group B ===\n\n\n== Final round ==\n\n\n=== Bracket ===\n\n\n=== Quarter-finals ===\n\n\n=== 5th–8th Semi-finals ===\n\n\n=== Semi-finals ===\n\n\n=== 7th place match ===\n\n\n=== 5th place match ===\n\n\n=== 3rd place match ===\n\n\n=== Final ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTournament's official website at norceca.net",

        "content": "Panam is a Mexican footwear brand founded in 1962. It is one of the oldest footwear companies that originate from Mexico.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe company was created by the Melem and Pérez families who wanted to create a brand for the country that would be able to provide affordable shoes for the country. The company was named Producto Auténtico Nacional Mexicano, Panam for short, and built its first factory in Naucalpan in the state of Mexico. After a fire burned down its first factory, the company decided to build a new factory in Cuautitlán Izcalli.\nIn 1967, the company launched the Panam 084 Campeón. It was the first shoe to introduce the \"P\" logo which has since been used on all of the company's shoes. The shoe became popular among students in school for use during recreational activities and help drives sales for the company. The success helped make the company be seen as the \"school shoe\" and make it the number one brand for students during the 1970s & 1980s.\nAfter the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement, an influx of foreign brands flooded the Mexican market and it led to many domestic brands going bankrupt and ceasing business due to their inability to compete with bigger, more established companies. This also affected Panam and led to losses in sales in their own country.\nIn November 2019, the company expanded its business and created a clothing line to sell alongside their shoes. The company has expanded to its neighboring countries and has opened stores in Guatemala, Belize, and the United States.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Tijana Perić Diligenski (Serbian Cyrillic: Тијана Перић Дилигенски; born 11 May 1986) is a Serbian politician. She has served in the National Assembly of Serbia since February 2024 as a member of Serbia Centre (SRCE).\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nPerić Diligenski was born in Knin, in what was then the Socialist Republic of Croatia in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. She later moved to Serbia and graduated from elementary school and high school in Belgrade. She earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Belgrade Faculty of Law in 2009 and received a master's degree from the faculty's theoretical-legal department in 2011 on the topic, \"Pound's critique of mechanical jurisprudence.\" In 2017, she was awarded a doctorate from the University of Belgrade Faculty of Political Sciences on the topic, \"Institutional factors of political corruption in the post-Yugoslav area 2000-2014.\" She has published widely in her field and is currently employed at the Institute for Political Studies in Belgrade as a senior research associate. Perić Diligenski has been involved in anti-corruption initiatives with the World Bank and the European Union.\n\n\n== Politician ==\nSerbia Centre participated in the 2023 Serbian parliamentary election as part of the multi-party Serbia Against Violence (SPN) coalition. Perić Diligenski was given the fourth position on the coalition's electoral list and was elected when the list won sixty-five mandates. The Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) and its allies won the election, and Serbia Centre serves in opposition. \nPerić Diligenski is now a member of the committee on the rights of the child and the committee on human and minority rights and gender equality, and a deputy member of the environmental protection committee, the European integration committee, and the European Union–Serbia stabilisation and association committee.\nIn January 2024, she criticized the Serbian government for failing to adopt a national strategic policy on combatting corruption, noting that the country had fallen to a \"devastating\" 104th place on Transparency International's anti-corruption ranking.\nPerić Diligenski is a vice-president of Serbia Centre.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Orhan Öztrak (1914–1995) was a Turkish jurist and politician who served as the minister of interior and the minister of customs and monopolies. He was a member of the Parliament and of the Senate.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nHe was born in Malkara, Tekirdağ, in 1914. He hailed from a family of which members are politicians and bureaucrats. His father was Mustafa Faik Öztrak who was the minister of interior. His brother, Adnan Öztrak, was the first director general of the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation between 1964 and 1971. His younger brother İlhan Öztrak served as the minister of state.\nOrhan Öztrak obtained a law degree from Ankara University. He received his Ph.D. in law from the University of Neuchâtel.\n\n\n== Career and activities ==\nAfter working as a district governor Öztrak was elected to the Parliament in the 1957 general election for the Republican People's Party (CHP) from Tekirdağ.

Later he was made its general secretary. He was a representative of Turkey at the European Parliament from 17 April 1970 to 28 January 1971.\nÖztrak served as minister of customs and monopolies in the cabinet led by Süleyman Demirel between 1975 and 1977.

Upon completing high school in 1964, he underwent military education at the Indonesian Military Academy. He graduated from the academy in 1967 and was commissioned as an infantry first lieutenant. Upon completing the basic infantry course (kursus antar kecabangan, Susarbang) in 1968, he was assigned to the 412th infantry battalion in Purworejo as a platoon commander.\nDjamhari attended advanced course for infantry officers (kursus lanjutan perwira infanteri, Suslapaif) in 1972 and the Indonesian Army Command and General Staff College (Seskoad) in 1983. Upon completing Seskoad, in 1984 Djamhari was assigned to the Bulukumba Regency as the commander of military district.

        "revision_id": 1223467941,
        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "North Korean migrant workers are a significant source of finances for the North Korean state. Often working in hard labour fields such as construction, logging, textile production, or mining, migrant workers' conditions have been frequently described by human rights activists as a modern-day form of slavery. North Korean labourers are frequently found in China, Russia, and the Gulf states, although they are also located in other countries.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nNorth Korea began formally sending migrant workers abroad in 1967, following the signing of an agreement between the North Korean government and the Soviet Union which allowed North Koreans to work at logging camps in the Russian Far East. North Korean labour exports increased during the 2000s and peaked during the early 2010s, as part of an effort by the North Korean government to acquire foreign hard currencies. With the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, most migrant labourers were left stranded in their home countries as a result of stringent anti-pandemic protocols instituted by the North Korean government. Three-year contracts, typical for migrant labourers, were extended to as long as seven years.\nMigrant workers have reportedly rioted on multiple instances, in contrast to tightly controlled North Korea. Of particular note was a January 2024 protest against non-payment of wages and working conditions in China, which allegedly involved as many as 3,000 factory labourers. Labourers are governed by the External Construction Guidance Bureau, part of the Ministry of Social Security.\n\n\n=== Conditions ===\nAnti-slavery non-governmental organisation Walk Free has criticised the overseas labour programme as being part of \"state-imposed forced labour on a mass scale\". Workers' payment is frequently withheld or collected by the North Korean government, and injuries or fatalities caused by work accidents are frequent. Aidan McQuade, director of human rights group Anti-Slavery International, further said that descriptions of working conditions indicate \"state-sponsored trafficking for forced labour\". According to defector Kim Joo-il, 70% of salary is taken by the government directly, with an additional 20% being paid to the government, obstenstibly as fees for food and housing. Other defectors have argued against this, stating that labourers will receive 10% of their pay only in \"very extreme\" circumstances.\n\n\n== Migrant workers by country or region ==\n\n\n=== Belarus ===\nAn unknown number of North Korean migrant workers are present in Belarus. According to the pro-government BelNovosti portal, North Korean migrant labourers have participated in construction or reconstruction of several buildings in Belarusian capital of Minsk, such as the Independence Palace, the Belarus Hotel. A high-level agreement between the North Korean and Belarusian governments in 2014 established greater opportunities for migrant labourers to work in Belarus.\n\n\n=== China ===\nChina hosts the largest amount of North Korean migrant workers, estimated at 80,000 by the East–West Center and National Committee on North Korea in 2019. Most North Korean migrant labourers in China work in textiles and garments, though many also work in the food processing industry, particularly in seafood processing. Several of their products are exported to United States retailers such as Walmart and ShopRite.\n\n\n=== Gulf states ===\nAside from Russia and China, the Arab states of the Persian Gulf are among the largest employers of North Korean migrant labour; Kuwait had 5,000 North Korean workers in the country in 2019. Labourers from North Korea participated in a 2017 construction project on Al Dhafra Air Base, a joint United Arab Emirates air base hosting the 380th Air Expeditionary Wing of the United States Air Force, and multiple restaurants run by the North Korean government also operate in the country.\nNorth Korean migrant labourers were heavily involved in the 2022 FIFA World Cup. The Qatari government reported in 2014 that 2,800 North Koreans were involved in the construction of facilities for the World Cup, though it denied media reports that North Koreans were working in conditions of slavery.\nOman expelled 300 of 380 North Korean migrant workers in December 2016.\n\n\n=== Mongolia ===\nMongolia has historically been one of the top employers of North Korean migrant labour and among the few democracies to use labourers, drawing criticism from human rights organisations such as Human Rights Watch. In response to increased pressure from the United Nations, Mongolia began refusing to renew visas for workers in 2017, vowing to send the remainder home by the end of 2018. Prior to being expelled, many North Koreans worked in construction, and made roughly ₮400,000 monthly in comparison to the ₮600,000 average monthly wage of Mongolian workers.\n\n\n=== Poland ===\nNorth Korean migrant labour in Poland has been a source of continued controversy, and a small group of workers remained in the country by mid-2017, despite several attempts to repatriate them. According to a 2017 report by the Polish State Labour Inspectorate, 450 North Koreans were employed by at least 19 companies. An investigation by The New York Times revealed additional North Korean labourers at two other companies.\n\n\n=== Russia ===\n\nRussia is the second-largest importer of North Korean labour after China, as of 2019. North Koreans have worked in Russia since the Soviet Union, and primarily work in Siberia's logging industry, though they have also worked in construction. North Korean migrant workers in Russia have frequently sent products back to their home country, aiding in the development of the country's black market.\n\n\n==== Russian-occupied territories ====\nAs of 2019 an estimated 400 North Koreans are working in the self-proclaimed state of Abkhazia, which is internationally recognised as a part of Georgia under Russian military occupation. According to The Washington Post, the presence of migrant workers in Abkhazia is part of an effort by the Russian government to sidestep international obligations on the repatriation of North Korean workers, as Abkhazia is not recognised as a subject of international law by the United Nations.\nFollowing the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent Russian occupation of Ukrainian territories, North Korean migrant labourers were sent to work in the Russian-occupied Donbas region. According to The Diplomat citing North Korean sources and Daily NK, North Korean workers have been primarily involved with the reconstruction of buildings damaged during the war.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Harvest of Corruption is a book by Frank Ogodo Ogbeche. The play centers on corrupt government system, witnessing a web of deceit, bribery, and moral decay. Aloho, desperate for employment, falls prey to Ochuole's promises, leading her into a job within the Ministry of External Relations under the notorious Chief Haladu Ade-Amaka. As the story unfolds, we see the pervasive corruption infecting even law enforcement, with characters like ACP Yakubu grappling with the idea of madness ruling a nation plagued by societal scandal. Aloho's involvement in drug trafficking and her secret affair with Chief Haladu unfold, leading to her pregnancy and subsequent tragic demise during childbirth. Ogeyi, Aloho's friend, becomes a crucial informant to ACP Yakubu, seeking justice for Aloho's death and bringing down the corrupt officials, resulting in a courtroom climax where justice is served.\n\n\n== Plot ==\n\n\n=== Scene one ===\nThe drama opens significantly with the Ministry of External Relations, where fate reunites Aloho and Ochuole, acquaintances from their university days. Aloho, burdened by her fruitless job search since completing her service, confides in Ochuole, who vows to assist her in securing employment. Excitedly, Aloho shares this news with her roommate and friend, Ogeyi, only to be met with caution due to Ochuole's questionable reputation. Despite Ogeyi's warnings, Aloho remains determined to accept Ochuole's offer.\nLater that same day, Ochuole leverages her connections and discusses Aloho's predicament with Chief Haladu Ade-Amaka, the influential minister of external relations, during their customary rendezvous at Madam Hoha's Akpara Hotel. \n\n\n=== Scene two ===\nChief Haladu Ade-Amaka, the minister of external relations, pays a casual visit to the police headquarters to greet the commissioner of police. During their conversation, the commissioner expresses concerns about the increasing prevalence of illicit activities within the ministry. However, these concerns are quickly allayed when the commissioner is presented with a significant sum of money by Chief. In exchange for continuous financial incentives and the promise of non-interference with his illegal activities, Chief assures the commissioner of police of ongoing financial benefits and even hints at securing him the position of inspector-general.\nMeanwhile, in another part of the police headquarters, Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) Yakubu reflects on the rampant bribery and corruption plaguing the nation. His thoughts are interrupted by the appearance of a seemingly deranged man, known as Show boy, whose unconventional ramblings surprisingly resonate with ACP Yakubu's own observations about society. Inspired by the madman's unconventional perspective, ACP Yakubu suggests that perhaps allowing the \"insane\" to govern might be a solution, considering the apparent lack of moral integrity among the so-called sane populace.\nElsewhere, Inspector Inaku, potentially acting on ACP Yakubu's instructions, approaches Ayo, a Clerical Assistant in the Ministry of External Relations, with probing questions. Initially resistant, Ayo relents when offered a bribe of two thousand naira by Inspector Inaku.\nIn another instance, Chief pays a visit to Justice Odili, the chief judge, under the guise of paying respects. In customary fashion, Chief offers Justice Odili a substantial sum of money and kola nuts in exchange for the protection and immunity he receives.\n\n\n=== Scene three ===\nAloho, accompanied by her friend Ochuole, is introduced to Chief Haladu Ade-Amaka, the Honourable Minister of External Relations, who offers her a position as one of his protocol officers. Despite Ogeyi's warnings about Ochuole's dubious connections, Aloho remains undeterred in accepting the job. She is informed of an upcoming trip to the United States to deliver important documents for the Minister, disregarding Ogeyi's advice to distance herself from Ochuole and the job.\nHowever, upon her departure, Aloho is detained at the airport after substances believed to be narcotics are found in her possession. Despite this setback, Chief Haladu Ade-Amaka intervenes and offers Justice Odili a substantial sum of one million naira, leading to Aloho's discharge and acquittal due to lack of evidence.\nMeanwhile, Assistant Commissioner of Police Yakubu is shocked by the developments and resolves to continue his investigation into the embezzlement of a staggering sum of one point two billion naira within the Ministry of External Relations under Chief Haladu Ade-Amaka's leadership.\n\n\n=== Scene four ===\nAloho, overcome with despair, finds herself in tears, wishing for death as she recounts the ordeal she endured at the hands of Chief Haladu Ade-Amaka, including a secret relationship with him prior to obtaining her job. She reveals to Ogeyi, who is taken aback by the revelation, that she is pregnant as a result of this liaison. Despite Aloho's initial inclination towards terminating the pregnancy, Ogeyi opposes this idea.\nMeanwhile, ACP Yakubu expresses his determination to his superior, the Commissioner of Police, to launch an investigation into the embezzlement scandal involving a staggering sum of one point two billion naira within the Ministry of External Relations, along with other associated crimes. Despite the Commissioner's disapproval, ACP Yakubu remains resolute in his decision.\n\n\n=== Scene five ===\nAloho, seeking guidance from a medical professional at Wazobia Hospital regarding her situation, encounters a complex moral dilemma. Despite initial resistance from the doctor regarding the procedure's legality, she finds herself in a challenging situation where her desperation leads her to offer a bribe, which the doctor reluctantly accepts. However, before the procedure can proceed, an unexpected interruption by Nurse Halimatu Amidu prevents its completion.\nIn the midst of this turmoil, Aloho confides in her friend Ogeyi about her haunting nightmares and inner conflict regarding the decision she's contemplating. Ogeyi, offering support and perspective, urges Aloho to reconsider her choice, emphasizing the importance of facing challenges with strength and resilience rather than succumbing to impulsive actions.\nUltimately, the intervention at the hospital serves as a turning point for Aloho, prompting her to reflect on the gravity of her decision and the potential consequences. Despite her initial disappointment and frustration, this experience offers her an opportunity for introspection and perhaps a chance to seek alternative solutions or support systems to navigate her circumstances.\n\n\n=== Scene six ===\nOgeyi rushes to Assistant Commissioner of Police, ACP Yakubu, bearing crucial information about the misconduct of Minister of External Relations, Hon. Haladu Ade-Amaka. She details the Minister's involvement in her friend's drug trafficking, his abuse of power to secure her friend's exoneration, and his reprehensible act of impregnating her friend. With tears in her eyes, Ogeyi pleads for ACP Yakubu's intervention, fearing for her friend Aloho's life as she seeks an abortion, which could have dire consequences. She implores them to take action swiftly to prevent further harm, expressing her willingness to testify as a witness whenever necessary.\nGrateful for Ogeyi's bravery in coming forward, ACP Yakubu and his team recognize the significance of the information she provides. They decide to escalate the matter by forwarding the recorded testimony on a cassette to the Presidency, urging immediate investigation by the State Security Service (SSS). This decisive action reflects their commitment to upholding justice and holding those in positions of power accountable for their actions.\n\n\n=== Scene seven ===\nDespite Aloho's futile attempts to terminate her pregnancy, she ultimately decides to seek solace and support from her parents, following Ogeyi's advice. However, their plans are disrupted when the State Security Service intervenes, apprehending Chief Haladu Ade-Amaka, Ochuole, and Ayo from the Ministry of External Relations. Meanwhile, Ogeyi is visited by Okpotu, Aloho's younger brother, who delivers the heartbreaking news of Aloho's demise during childbirth. He reveals that Aloho gave birth to a baby girl before passing away and that their father wants to know the child's father. Shocked and overwhelmed, Ogeyi vows to seek justice for Aloho's death and ensure that the responsible party faces consequences, all while grappling with her grief.\n\n\n=== Scene eight ===\nChief Haladu-Ade-Amaka and his associates, including the commissioner of police, the Chief Judge, Justice Odili, the clerical assistant Mr. Ayo, Ochuole, and the proprietress of Akpara Hotel, Madam Hoha, face charges of bribery and corruption brought by the state. Despite the defense counsel's efforts to secure their acquittal, they are unable to escape the consequences of their actions. The courtroom serves as a stage where the repercussions of their corrupt deeds unfold. Chief Haladu-Ade-Amaka is sentenced to twenty-five years in prison, while the commissioner of police and the Chief Justice receive twenty years each. Madam Hoha is sentenced to ten years, Ochuole and Mr. Ayo receive ten years and five years respectively. As the judge brings down his gavel, signifying the end of the trial, law enforcement officers escort the convicted individuals out of the courtroom to begin serving their sentences, marking a decisive moment in the fight against corruption.\n\n\n== Characters ==\nAloho: A young woman burdened by unemployment after completing her national service.

        "content": "Fallen (Sanningen) is a Swedish six-part TV series starring Sofia Helin. It first aired on TV4 on 25 December 2024, and has since been distributed to several other countries.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe recently widowed police officer Iris Broman travels from Stockholm to Ystad in southern Sweden, where she will reside in her sister's home while taking up the new position of leading the cold case unit in Malmö. A body is found and there is an unsolved murder from over 10 years ago, and Broman also has to deal with her personal trauma and complex relationship with her sister, Kattis. Kattis is married to a French man and her children are bilingual, while Broman has no children and no desire to have any.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nSofia Helin as Iris Broman\nHedda Stiernstedt as Kattis\nHåkan Bengtsson as Jens\nKajsa Ernst as Kerstin\nHanna Ullerstam as Hillevi\nPeter Gardiner as Christian\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe series was produced for commercial Swedish TV channel TV4 and streaming service C More, in partnership with Germany's public broarcaster ZDF.\nFrom 2011 until 2018, Sofia Helin was lead actor and Camilla Ahlgren lead writer of the Danish-Swedish co-production The Bridge, and their partnership is renewed in Fallen, with Ahlgren as co-creator and lead writer and Helin in the lead role. Other writers on Fallen were Norwegian filmmaker Martin Asphaug and Alex Haridi. Ahlgen remained involved in the production, including viewing all the dailies doing rewrites where necessary. She wanted to show the stark contrast between the city and country scenery. However, the tone is lighter, and the lead character very distinct from The Bridge.\nAs of February 2024, financing was being arranged for a second season, by TV4, Germany's ZDF, and Film i Skåne, which Ahlgren had already started writing.\n\n\n== Release ==\nSanningen premiered on 25 December 2023 on TV4 in Sweden.\nThe series was aired from 25 February 2024 in Germany, and after Banijay obtained distribution rights, the series was bought by American broadcaster MHz Choice, Canal+'s Polar+ for France, NPO in the Netherlands, SBS in Australia, ERT in Greece, and Syn Hf in Iceland. All episodes dropped on SBS on Demand in Australia on 4 April 2024.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIn Sweden, the final episode attracted around 1.1 million viewers (10% of the Swedish population).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFallen at IMDb",

        "content": "On May 5, 2024, Egyptian and Qatari mediators put forward a ceasefire proposal during the Israel–Hamas war, involving the release of all Israeli captives in exchange for a release of some Palestinian prisoners and leading to a permanent cessation of hostilities. On May 6, Hamas accepted the proposal. Israel disagreed with the proposal but said it would continue to negotiate.\nThe proposal has three stages, each 42 days. Hamas would release 33 Israeli captives in the first stage, the remaining alive captives in the second stage, and deceased Israeli captives in the third stage. In exchange, Israel would release 30-50 Palestinians (starting with children and women) for every Israeli released. During the first stage, Israel would have to allow \"sufficient\" quantities of humanitarian aid, allow displaced Palestinians to return to their homes and start to make a phased withdrawal from Gaza. During the temporary ceasefire, talks would begin between both parties for a more permanent cessation of hostilities. In the final stage, Israel would lift the blockade of Gaza and in exchange Hamas would agree to not rebuild its military arsenal.\n\n\n== Negotiations ==\nNegotiations for a ceasefire had been on-going, but neither side could come to an agreement. On May 2, Israel offered a ceasefire proposal; Hamas said it disagreed with three points in that proposal. On May 4 and May 5, talks were hosted in Cairo, which were attended by Egyptians, Qataris, and a US delegation led by CIA director William Burns. Hamas also sent a delegation; the Americans don't directly talk to Hamas, but communicate their proposals through intermediaries. Benjamin Netanyahu decided to not send an Israeli delegation.\nPrevious negotiation had failed because Hamas sought a permanent end to the war, while Israel would only agree to a temporary ceasefire. The Egyptians and Qataris aimed to bridge this divide by separating the ceasefire into three phases, with negotiations for a \"sustainable calm\" happening only in the second phase. The wording \"sustainable calm\" was crafted by the Americans so that Israel would not have to commit to a permanent ceasefire upfront. The United States official hoped that the first 42 ceasefire would lead to something \"more enduring\".\nOn May 6, John Kirby, an advisor to President Biden, confirmed that CIA Director William Burns had played a key role in the negotiations that brought about the proposal.\n\n\n== Details of the proposal ==\nThe proposal is divided into three stages, each 42 days (six weeks) long. Its aims are the release of all Israeli captives – whether civilian or military, alive or deceased; release of some number of Palestinian prisoners; return of \"sustainable calm\"; and the end of Israeli occupation and siege of the Gaza Strip.\n\n\n=== First stage ===\nIn this stage, Hamas would release 33 Israeli captives. It would start with releasing all living Israeli children (under 19), all living civilian women, all living elderly (over age 50) Israelis, and all living female Israeli soldiers. In return, Israel would release 30 Palestinian children and women for every Israeli civilian released. If the total number of alive children, women, elderly and female soldiers is less than 33, then it would make up for that difference by releasing deceased bodies of Israelis.\nIsrael would have to allow the entry of \"sufficient\" quantities of humanitarian aid: 600 trucks per day, of which 300 are for the north. Included in this are 50 fuel trucks \"including the fuel necessary for operating the power plant, trade, and equipment needed for rubble removal, rehabilitation and operation of hospitals, health centres and bakeries in all areas of the Gaza Strip\".\nSimultaneous to the captive exchanges, displaced unarmed Palestinians shall be able to return to their homes in Gaza, and Israel would gradually withdraw from some (but not all) parts of the Gaza Strip. Israel would not conduct military flights over for 10-12 hours per day. \n\n\n=== Second stage ===\nIn the second state, Hamas would release all remaining alive male Israelis, including both civilians and soldiers. In return, Israel would release an agreed upon number of Palestinians prisoners. The prisoner exchanges would be conditioned on both parties agreeing to and announcing a \"sustainable calm\" and the withdrawal of remaining Israeli soldiers from the Gaza Strip.\n\n\n=== Third stage ===\nIn this stage, Hamas would release all the remains of deceased Israeli captives, in exchange for Israel releasing the remains of deceased Palestinian bodies that it holds. Israel would end the Blockade of the Gaza Strip and Hamas would not rebuild its military capabilities.\n\n\n=== Supervision and guarantors ===\nUnder the proposal, activities in the Gaza Strip would be supervised by Egypt, Qatar and the United Nations.\nThe proposal and its provisions would be guaranteed by Qatar, Egypt, the United States, and the United Nations. Hamas stated that they received promises that both Egypt and President Biden would guarantee the implementation of the deal.\n\n\n== Reactions ==\nAfter Hamas's acceptance of the proposal, crowds gathered to celebrate in Rafah, Gaza Strip. On the Palestinian side the proposal was supported by Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas. Ordinary Gazans expressed support for the proposal.\nIn Israel, the families of Israeli captives held by Hamas called on the US to pressure Netanyahu into accepting the proposal. Protests broke out in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Protestors blocked the Ayalon Highway in Tel Aviv, demanding the government reach a deal to secure the release of Israeli captives.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Netanyahu said the proposal was \"far from meeting Israel's demands\", but would send a delegation to Cairo to negotiate.\nTurkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan welcomed Hamas's acceptance of the proposal and hoped Israel will do the same. French president Emmanuel Macron urged Netanyahu to reach a ceasefire and hostage deal with Hamas. UAE's Foreign Minister Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan supported Egyptian-Qatari mediations and hoped the proposal would result in ending both the war and the suffering of Palestinians.\n\n\n== See also ==\n2023 Israel–Hamas ceasefire\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "John Ramsey, or John Ramsay, (1496?–1551) was an English prior of Merton and religious pamphleteer.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nRamsey was born about 1496. He was possibly son of John Ramsay (d. 1515), rector of Brabourne, Kent. He joined the college of canons regular at New Inn Hall, Oxford, and graduated B.A. in 1513–14 and B.D. in 1522. He was afterwards successively prior of St. Mary's College, Oxford (about 1528), and of Merton Abbey, Surrey. To the latter office he was elected on 31 January 1530. In 1537 Thomas Paynell dedicated to him his translation of Erasmus's ‘Of the Comparation of a Virgin and a Martyr,’ which he had undertaken at Ramsay's request. Ramsay adopted reforming principles, and resigned his priory before the dissolution of the monasteries. The abbey was surrendered in 1538 by another prior, John Bowle (Dugdale, Monasticon, vi. 246).\nBefore 1545 Ramsay became rector of Woodchurch (Deanery of Lympne, Kent), and died in possession of the rectory in 1551 (Hasted, Kent, iii. 111).\nRamsay wrote: \n\n‘A Corosyfe to be layed hard unto the Hartes of all Faythfull Professours of Christes Gospel, gathered out of the Scriptures by John Ramsay,’ 12mo, no place or date. But at the close of the work it prays for Edward VI, and ‘for the laws permitting the liberty of Christ's Gospel.’ It was therefore published some time between 1548 and 1551; it is Protestant and evangelical in tone.\n‘A Communication or a Dialogue between a Poor Man and his Wife, wherein thou shalt find Godly Lessons for thy Instruction,’ 8vo, without date or place (see Tanner, Bibl. Brit.)\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Shaw, William Arthur (1896). \"Ramsay, John (1496?-1551)\". In Lee, Sidney (ed.).

        "content": "Markarian 817 is a barred spiral galaxy located in the constellation Draco. It is located 456 million light-years from Earth, which, given its apparent dimensions, means that Markarian 817 is about 80,000 light-years across. It is a Seyfert galaxy.\n\n\n== Features ==\nThe nucleus of Markarian 817 is found to be active. It is classified as a Seyfert 1.5 or Seyfert 1.2 galaxy by the recent work done, according to Koss et al. 2017. The nucleus sits in a barred spiral galaxy, close to face-on and not typical to optically selected unobscured Seyferts.  There is evidence of dust along the galaxy's bar according to the Hubble image.\nA study conducted in February 2011, shows that the active core is not fixed as it shows strong variabilities in X-rays and ultraviolet rays (UV). The X-ray luminosity varies by the factor of ~40 over 20 years, while the UV continuum/emission lines vary at the most factor of ~2.3 over the past 30 years.\nA 2021 study shows that the X-ray spectrum in Markarian 817 is highly absorbed and there are new blueshifted, broad, and narrow UV absorption lines, suggesting a dust-free, ionized obscurer that is located in the inner broad-line region, partially covering the central source. During the first 55 days, scientists observed there is a de-coupling of the UV continuum and the UV broad emission line variability. The next 42 days of the campaign showed the correlation recovering, as Markarian 817 entered the less obscured state. The short C IV and Lyα lags suggest that the accretion disk extends beyond the UV broad-line region.\nMoreover, Markarian 817 has become a notable target of AGN STORM 2 project, which a group of astronomers lead by Edward M. Cackett from the Wayne State University in Detroit, monitored the galaxy with Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory for 15 months, which they obtained observations in X-rays and six ultraviolet/optical filters to shed more light on Markarian 817.\nFurther observations done in 2022, showed that the source flux in Markarian 817 has declined compared to being recorded at prior point during the 19-year mission. From the deep XMM Newton and NuSTAR observations, the spectra presents a complex X-ray wind which consist of neutral and ionized absorption zones. Three velocity components are detected from the part of the structured ultra-fast outflow with v/c = 0.043 (+0.007,-0.003), v/c = 0.079 (+0.003,-0.0008), and v/c = 0.074 (+0.004,-0.005). These suggests that the wind likely arises at radii that is smaller compared to the optical broad line region.\n\n\n== Black hole ==\n\nThe central black hole in Markarian 817, has an estimated solar mass of (4.9 +/- 0.8) E+7 according to Peterson et al. 2004. Such winds tend to move fast at many millions of kilometers per hour thus cleaning up interstellar gas from the region of space. This cuts off the rate of production of new stars being formed in Markarian 817, leaving the black hole nothing left to devour. This suggests that the black hole is experiencing a \"temper tantrum\" and is responsible for shaping its host galaxy.\nIn an article in which Markarian 817 and another seyfert galaxy NGC 7469 is studied, it is revealed both AGNs detected time lags in the broad emission line, including H, H, He~{\\sc ii} and He~{\\sc i} and also the Fe~{\\sc ii} for Markarian 817 with respect to the varying continuum at 5100~Å. From the relationship of line widths and time lags, both galaxies showed that the BLR dynamics are consistent with the viral predication. Data provided for Markarian 817 showed, almost the same kinetic structures, which the time lags in the red wing is larger compared to the time lags in the blue wing. This indicates the BLR of Keplerian motion seemly has outflowing components during monitoring period.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMarkarian 590 - a seyfert galaxy in Cetus\nMarkarian 273 - a seyfert and ultraluminous infrared galaxy\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Grace Allen Johnson (née Fitch; September 9, 1871 – January 17, 1952) was an American suffragist, educator, and peace activist known for her leadership in the women's suffrage movement in Massachusetts. Initially holding traditional views on women's roles, she became actively involved in suffrage after attending a meeting in Cambridge, England, in 1907. Johnson was the founder and president of the Cambridge Political Equality Association (CPEA), rallying public support for women's suffrage. She later focused on international peace activism and played a key role in introducing proportional representation in Cambridge in 1940.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life and education ===\nGrace Allen Fitch was born on September 9, 1871, in Maples, Indiana, to Appleton Howe Fitch and Elizabeth Harriet Bennett. She spent her childhood in Kalamazoo, Michigan, before her family relocated to Hopkinton, Massachusetts. Johnson graduated from Hopkinton High School in 1890 and went on to attend the Pratt Institute Library School in Brooklyn, New York, graduating in 1891.\n\n\n=== Marriage and family ===\nIn 1893, Grace Allen Johnson married Lewis Jerome Johnson, a civil engineer. The couple settled in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where Lewis became a professor at Harvard University. They had two sons, Jerome and Chandler.\n\n\n=== Entry into suffrage movement ===\nInitially holding traditional views on women's roles, Johnson's perspective shifted in 1907 after attending a pro-suffrage meeting in Cambridge, England. Upon her return to Massachusetts, she became actively involved in the suffrage movement,  becoming the president of the Cambridge Political Equality Association (CPEA) of MA in 1910, which she founded in 1896.\n\n\n=== Suffrage activism ===\nJohnson served as president of the CPEA for six years, during which she focused her efforts on rallying public support for women's suffrage in Massachusetts. She advocated for the adoption of a state constitutional amendment to enfranchise women and played a key role in organizing suffrage rallies, canvassing voters, and writing pro-suffrage articles.\n\n\n=== Political engagement ===\nIn addition to her suffrage work, Johnson was politically active in other areas. She supported the Progressive Party and favored the \"single tax\" on land value popularized by Henry George. In 1912, she served as a delegate and organizer to the Progressive Party National Convention in Chicago.\n\n\n=== World War I and post-war activism ===\nDuring World War I, Johnson initially opposed American entry into the conflict, but eventually supported the war effort after the United States declared war in 1917. She contributed to the war by advocating for women's suffrage and promoting other progressive causes. Following the war, Johnson continued her activism by working towards international peace.\n\n\n=== Peace activism and education ===\nJohnson supported the League of Nations and served as executive secretary of the Massachusetts Woodrow Wilson Foundation. She traveled to Geneva in 1926 to observe the League of Nations in action and dedicated herself to educating the public about international affairs and peace initiatives. In addition to her activism, Johnson had a distinguished career in education, teaching International Affairs and Parliamentary Procedures at the Garland School for Homemaking in Boston.\n\n\n=== Later life and legacy ===\nIn her later years, Johnson remained committed to activism and education. She continued her advocacy for international peace and taught subjects such as International Affairs and Parliamentary Procedures until 1940. Johnson also played a role in local governance, advocating for proportional representation in Cambridge. She passed away on January 17, 1952, in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n=== Books ===\nBerenson, Barbara F. (2020-08-27). \"Johnson, Grace Allen\".

        "content": "The Atasu (Kazakh: Атасу) is a river in the Zhanaarka District, Ulytau Region, and Shet District, Karaganda Region, Kazakhstan. It has a length of 177 km (110 mi) and a drainage basin of 5,920 km2 (2,290 sq mi).\nIt is one of the most important tributaries of the Sarysu. The city of Karazhal is located near the river. The Kylysh (Қылыш) reservoir was built at the time of the Kazakh SSR close to Kylysh village, 17 km (11 mi) to the ESE of the town.\n\n\n== Course ==\nThe Atasu river originates in the Uzynzhal massif of the Kazakh Uplands. Its source is in a spring near Kyzyltau. It heads at first westwards in its upper course across Shet District. After it leaves the mountain area it bends roughly northwestwards, already in Zhanaarka District, and flows in that direction until a little to the east of Karazhal, where it bends northwards. Towards the end of its lower course the Atasu flows within a floodplain, where it divides into separate channels and most of its water is drawn for irrigating nearby fields. Finally it joins the left bank of the Sarysu about 20 km (12 mi) downriver from Zhanaarka, the district capital.\nRiver Atasu is fed mainly by snow and its highest level is usually in April and May. By the summer it barely flows, splitting into separate pools. Its main tributaries are the Bylkyldak, Karakoga, Karkymbay, Isabek Karasuy and Boranbay.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of rivers of Kazakhstan\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Atasu (river) at Wikimedia Commons\nThe Great Silk Road in Central and Eastern Kazakhstan",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "The Ohio State University football scandal concerned NCAA rules violations and other incidents committed by the Ohio State Buckeyes football team during the tenure of former head coach Jim Tressel from 2001 to 2011. An investigation of the program was joined by the NCAA, the FBI, and the U.S. Department of Justice. As a result of the investigation, Ohio State's football program was punished with sanctions.\nThe sanctions were announced on July 8, 2011, and affected the Ohio State football program from 2011 to 2015. The punishment involved Ohio State vacating all wins from the 2010 season (including the 2011 Sugar Bowl win), a postseason ban in 2012, two years of NCAA probation, a five-year show cause for head coach Jim Tressel, and a reduction of five scholarships over three years. Tressel would resign from Ohio State as a result of the scandal.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe origins of the scandal date back to when Maurice Clarett, a member of Ohio State's 2002 national championship team, accused the university of major NCAA violations. The New York Times in July 2003 received information from a teaching assistant that Clarett had received preferential treatment from professors, claiming he never attended any classes during his time at Ohio State. Clarett was suspended for the 2003 season on September 10, 2003, by athletic director Andy Geiger. Geiger claimed that Clarett received special benefits worth thousands of dollars from a family friend and repeatedly misled investigators. However, the investigation did not find sufficient evidence of academic misconduct, and Clarett was not ruled ineligible. Clarett claims that head coach Jim Tressel asked him to \"take the fall\" for Ohio State during the investigation, naming five other former players in his official story including Sammy Maldonado and Marco Cooper, and that he received substantial benefits from Tressel and his brother, including access to cars.\n\n\n== The scandal ==\nThe scandal then took off when five players - Terrelle Pryor, Devier Posey, Mike Adams, Solomon Thomas, and Boom Herron were suspended by the NCAA for the first five games of the 2011 season for receiving improper benefits on December 22, 2010. However, the players were allowed to participate in the upcoming Sugar Bowl game against Arkansas. The suspensions resulted from an incident where the players received tattoos for autographs. The players also sold several items given to them by the university, including Big Ten championship rings, jerseys, and other football-related awards for tattoos. Head coach Jim Tressel denied any involvement and knowledge of the players committing these violations.\nThe scandal originated from Fine Line Tattoos and Piercings in Columbus. The owner of the parlor, Edward Rife, was being investigated for felony drug trafficking. Tressel was first notified of the arrangement in April 2010 when he received several e-mails from Chris Cicero, a local attorney and former Ohio State football player. It was later revealed that Tressel never forwarded the e-mails, nor the information contained in them about potential violations, to his school's compliance office or the NCAA. n December 2010, the U.S. Department of Justice notified Ohio State that that at least six current players, including Pryor, had traded team memorabilia for tattoos or cash at the parlor. A report from Sports Illustrated revealed that they had found evidence that the cash for memorabilia scandal dated back to Ohio State's 2002 national championship team, and that as many as 28 players were involved. Sports Illustrated also discovered allegations that Ohio State players had traded memorabilia for marijuana.\nRecords of roughly 50 cars owned by current and former Ohio State football players, including Pryor, were also investigated. Former Ohio State wide receiver Ray Small revealed that players were selling memorabilia and getting deals on cars that cost more than they could afford, stating that “They have a lot (of dirt) on everybody, cause everybody was doing it.” Multiple media outlets including ESPN reported that Pryor was driving with a suspended license. Pryor was seen driving a Nissan 350Z to team meetings and workouts. Former Ohio State basketball player Mark Titus claimed that students at the university knew that Buckeye football players were driving cars they could not afford, stating \"you'd have to be blind to not notice it.\"\n\nOn January 3, 2011, Tressel's email exchanges with Cicero were leaked to the university. On January 16, Tressel confessed that he had covered up the violations committed by the players. On March 8, Ohio State suspended Tressel for the first two games of the 2011 season and fined him $250,000 for not informing the university of NCAA violations and denying knowledge of the players receiving improper benefits. Tressel's suspension would later be increased to five games by the university. However, Ohio State president Gordon Gee assured Tressel that he would not be fired.\nOn April 25, 2011, the NCAA accused Tressel of withholding information and lying to keep Buckeyes players on the field. In their notice of allegations sent to Ohio State, the NCAA stated that Tressel's actions were considered \"potential major violations\" which had \"permitted football student-athletes to participate in intercollegiate athletics while ineligible.\" The report also said he \"failed to comport himself ... (with) honesty and integrity\" and that he lied when he filled out a compliance form in September stating that he had no knowledge of NCAA violations by any of his players. Tressel claimed that he lied about the violations because he didn't want to jeopardize the FBI's investigation into Rife and that he feared for his players' safety. However, it was revealed that Tressel only spoke with two players, never inquired of the two if other players were involved and also in danger, nor in his discussions with players ever mentioned Mr. Rife, the tattoo parlor, or the selling of Ohio State merchandise. The NCAA's report explicitly refuted the credibility of Tressel's excuse. On May 30, Tressel resigned as Ohio State's head coach. On June 8, Terrelle Pryor announced that he would forgo his senior year as a result of the scandal.\n\n\n== Punishment ==\nThe NCAA issued sanctions against Ohio State on July 8, 2011. Ohio State was forced to vacate all wins from the 2010 season (including the 2011 Sugar Bowl win), they were issued a postseason ban for the 2012 season, two years of NCAA probation, a five-year show cause for Jim Tressel, and a reduction of five scholarships over three years.\n\n\n== Criticism of sanctions ==\nThese sanctions have been criticized by college football writers, and there have been calls for the NCAA to reinstate the Buckeyes' wins due to new NIL rules. Terrelle Pryor has called on the NCAA to reinstate their wins from the 2010 season, stating that \"The affirmation of NCAA athletes’ rights to make a living from their name, image and likeness is a huge step in the right direction. Armed with the correct resources and support, we know they'll show what we felt to be true all along — not letting athletes capitalize on what ultimately is their hard work was unjust and unnecessary. Now that fundamental right has been granted to a new generation of athletes. Now that they finally have the freedom to share in some of the millions of dollars in revenue they generate for their coaches, their institutions, their conferences and the NCAA as a whole, we would like to see our hard won accomplishments reinstated.\"\nIn May 2022, the Ohio House of Representatives adopted a non-unanimous symbolic resolution calling on the NCAA to reinstate the team's wins and records. Ryan Fagan of The Sporting News has also called on the NCAA to reinstate Ohio State's wins due to the new NIL rules, stating that \"it’s a frustrating change for certain fan bases that have seen their favorite programs dragged through the NCAA mud for violations that were ridiculous when they happened and would be fully legal and above board now.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\n2015 University of Louisville basketball sex scandal\nUniversity of Southern California athletics scandal\nUniversity of Minnesota basketball scandal\nUniversity of Michigan football sign-stealing scandal\nWakeyLeaks\nJim O'Brien and NCAA Violations\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Jane Lockett (27 August 1847 – 14 November 1890), better known as Jeannie Lockett, was a colonial Australian writer and schoolteacher. Her articles on social and political issues were published in England in the 1880s. She also wrote short stories and non-fiction for the Australian press, sometimes as Jennie Lockett or Jeannie Leckett or Beattie. Her novel, Judith Grant, was published posthumously.\n\n\n== Life ==\nBorn Jane Beattie on 27 August 1847 in Bathurst, New South Wales, she was one of 15 children of writer Mary Anne (died 1906) and Hugh Beattie (died 1890). The family later settled at Wagga Wagga where Hugh established the Brooklyn vineyard. She married Thomas Lockett in Wagga on 27 May 1868. He was a blacksmith who had grown up on the goldfields at Lambing Flat (now Young).\nAfter her marriage, Lockett worked as an assistant schoolteacher at Hamilton Public School in 1880. In 1884 at Camperdown Public School she received a promotion. In 1888 she had  been transferred to Plunkett Street Public School as mistress overseeing the female students. She also tutored students sitting for matriculation examinations for university entrance.\nAlongside her teaching, Lockett sent articles on the Australian social and political scene which were published in The Westminster Review, The Nineteenth Century (TNC) and St James's Gazette. In 1885 her article on \"Female Labour in Australia\" was published in TNC in the hope of attracting women migrate to Australia to work as domestic servants. It was republished in The Bathurst Free Press and Mining Journal, described as a \"well-written paper\" but a review in the Australian Town and Country Journal felt it would do little to lessen the servant shortage.\nLockett died aged 43 on 14 November 1890 at St Vincent's Hospital, Darlinghurst and she was buried at Waverley Cemetery. Her niece, the poet, Mary Gilmore, wrote a detailed article about the Beattie family and its connection to Wagga Wagga.\n\n\n== Selected works ==\n\n\n=== Non-fiction ===\n\"Dietary for Families\" (1883 series)\n\n\n=== Short stories ===\n\"Miss Nagg's Little Affaire de Coeur\" (1883 two-part story)\n\"Jo's Ideal\" (1884 two-part story)\n\"Brother Jack and the Other Jack' (1884)\n\"A Stony Creek Idyll\" (1885 two-part story)\n\"The Millwood Mystery\" (1886–87 serial)\n\"Awfully Sudden Death\" (1887 serial)\n\"The Garston House Tragedy\" (1888–89 serial)\n\"The Case of Dr. Hilston\" (1890 serial)\n\n\n=== Novel ===\nJudith Grant: A Novel, Hutchinson (1892)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "George L. Atkins Jr. (July 10, 1941 – April 14, 2024) was an American politician, lobbyist and healthcare consultant. He served as the mayor of his hometown of Hopkinsville, Kentucky, from 1972 to 1975. Atkins was then elected Kentucky State Auditor in 1975, serving for one term from 1975 until 1979.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nAtkins was born in Hopkinsville, Kentucky, to George L. Atkins Sr. and Frances Shaver Atkins on July 10, 1941. His parents owned the family-run Atkins Dairy in Hopkinsville. He graduated from Hopkinsville High School in 1959. Atkins studied at the University of Kentucky, where he played basketball for the Kentucky Wildcats under Coach Adolph Rupp and received his bachelor's degree in 1963.\nAtkins' political career began in 1972, when the Hopkinsville City Council appointed him as Mayor of Hopkinsville to fill a recent vacancy caused by the outgoing mayor. In 1975, Mayor Atkins launched his candidacy for Kentucky state auditor, which was being vacated by incumbent Mary Louise Foust. Atkins was elected state auditor in the 1975 general election and served for one term from 1975 to 1979.\nIn 1979, Atkins announced his candidacy for governor of Kentucky. However, he withdrew from the race prior to the Democratic primary and endorsed John Y. Brown Jr., who won the 1979 Kentucky gubernatorial election. Governor Brown appointed  Atkins first as his finance secretary and then as cabinet secretary.\nIn 1982, Atkins ran for Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky, but was defeated by Steve Beshear in the Democratic primary election.\nAtkins left active politics following his loss in 1982 and became the chief lobbyist for Humana in Kentucky. There, he helped lead Humana's 1990 lobbying efforts to weaken legal limits on potential Humana-owned hospital expansions in Louisville, Kentucky. The bill narrowly passed the Kentucky Senate by one vote, thanks to a deciding yes vote by state Senator Patti Weaver (D-Walton) after Atkins privately agreed to help Weaver obtain a job in state government in exchange for her support of the legislation. However, after Weaver failed the state personnel exam, she threatened to make the deal public. In response, Atkins funneled $10,000 to Weaver through an intermediary, state Sen. Helen Garrett of Paducah, who was later convicted of state government corruption unrelated to this particular case. \nGeorge Atkins pleaded guilty to mail fraud. He was sentenced by federal magistrate Judge Joseph Martin Hood to 24 weekends in prison, 400 hours of community service, and $10,000 in fines. The Humana corporation was fined $92,437 and apologized for its role in the scandal.\nAtkins returned to the healthcare industry as a consultant based in Washington D.C. \nGeorge L. Atkins died on April 14, 2024, at the age of 82. He was survived by his wife, Donna Atkins, and three children.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Kitāb al-nawāmīs is an Arabic book of magic written in the late ninth century in a Ṣābian milieu. It falsely claims to be a work of Plato. The complete Arabic text does not survive, but a complete Latin translation of the twelfth century does under the title Liber vaccae or the Book of the Cow.\nThe work is divided into two books of 45 and 40 chapters, respectively. Each chapter contains a magical experiment or recipe, including for creating rational animals or hybrids, creating phenomena in the sky, controlling the rain or trees, acquiring wisdom, influencing the sense of vision, creating inextinguishable lights, getting one's wishes granted, seeing spirits, making animals submissive, manipulating fire and making miraculous seeds and inks.\n\n\n== Title ==\nThe original title in Arabic, Kitāb al-nawāmīs, is often translated Book of the Laws, since nawāmīs is the plural of nāmūs, an Arabic transliteration of Greek nomos (law). It was chosen so as to sound genuine, since there is an authentic work of Plato entitled Laws. The Arabic term nawāmīs, however, came to mean \"secrets\" and this is how it is defined in medieval dictionaries. Liana Saif suggests \"book of the sacred secrets\" is a better translation of Kitāb al-nawāmīs and accurately reflects its content.\nIn Latin translation, the book circulated under various titles. The original title of the translation was Liber aneguemis, the latter word being a mere transliteration of al-nawāmīs. This was sometimes corrupted to Liber neumich. The alternative title Libri institutionum (and variants like Liber institucionum activarum) is an attempt at translation. Other titles are taken from the work's contents. Liber tegimenti is a reference to the preface, wherein the original title (Kitāb al-nawāmīs) is said to be a tegimentum (covering) concealing the true meaning. Liber regimenti, the title found in De mirabilibus mundi, appears to be a corruption of this. Liber vaccae ('Book of the Cow'), the title chosen by Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, refers to the first experiment, which involves a cow.\n\n\n== Genre ==\nBy medieval classifications, the Kitāb al-nawāmīs is a work of natural magic (sīmāʾ, magia naturalis) as opposed to ritual magic. That is, it is \"based solely on the exploitation of the hidden forces of nature\" and does not directly involve demons or other spirits.\nModern scholars have employed many terms. On account of the substances used and the end products of its experiments, it may be classed as \"organic magic\". Its complex procedures and focus on marvel and spectacle place it in the realm of \"illusionist\" rather than divinatory magic. David Pingree labels it \"psychic magic\" because its uses body parts and fluids which souls were believed to inhabit.\n\n\n== Date and place of origin ==\nThe Kitāb al-nawāmīs was produced by the Ṣābians of Ḥarrān in the late ninth century. The earliest citation of it is found in a Pseudo-Jābirian work of the early tenth century. Robert Goulding suggests that second book was composed separately and added to the first early on.\nThe preface falsely claims that the work is Ḥunayn ibn Isḥāq's translation of Galen's synopsis of Plato's Laws. An actual translation or adaptation of Plato's Laws based on Galen's synopsis and attributed to Ḥunayn is partially extant. No fuller translation is known. The purpose of the forgery was \"that their anonymous authors hoped to give additional weight to the authority of their works.\" The pagan religion of the Ṣābians, however, was genuinely influenced by Neoplatonism. Some words in the Arabic text are clearly transliterations of Greek words.\nThe ascription to Plato was considered suspect by the earliest Latin writers to comment on it, William of Auvergne (d. 1249) and Nicole Oresme (d. 1382). It was rejected outright by Pico della Mirandola, who calls the work \"full of detestable dreams and nonsense ... no less alien to Plato than these dreadful things are alien to Plato's decency and wisdom.\"\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\nAfter a preface, the Kitāb al-nawāmīs is divided into two books, called maior (greater) and minor (lesser). There are 85 chapters containing approximately as many \"experiments\", 45 in the first book and 40 in the second. Some surviving copies lack chapter 26 and chapters 39 and 40 appear to be later additions.\nThe experiments are organized thematically. Sophie Page identifies ten groupings (and three isolated chapters) in the first book:\n\nChapters 1–4, experiments for creating creatures\nChapters 5–11, suffumigations for creating celestial marvels\nChapters 12–15, experiments for influencing the rain\nChapters 16–20, experiments for \"how to adapt houses so that they have marvelous appearances or so that those who enter them have marvelous experiences\"\nChapters 21–23, experiments for making trees animate\nChapters 24–26, experiments for acquiring wisdom and secret knowledgeChapter 27, an isolated experiment for creating a hybrid creature\nChapters 28–31, recipes for lotions to influence the eyesight of the experimenter or othersChapter 32 lacks an experiment, but describes the original possessors of nawāmīs as engaged in the worship of heavenly bodies\nChapters 33–36, experiments for creating inextinguishable lights\nChapters 37–41, experiments for creating happiness and getting one's wishes\nChapters 41–44, recipes for lotions to allow one to see spirits, including demonsChapter 45, a suffumigation for making animals submissive\nThe experiments in the second book mostly concern fire and its maniuplation (such as candles that create optical illusions), although chapters 1–3 and 28–30 are about marvellous seeds and inks, respectively. While the first book concerns control over rational and animal life and contact with spirits, the second is \"more modest domestic magic or parlour tricks ... to provoke wonder and provide entertainment.\"\n\n\n== Reception and interpretation ==\nThe Kitāb al-nawāmīs does not give any reasons or bases for its experiments. It is lacking in \"articulate description of its theoretical foundations\". The earliest work to attempt an explanation is the Ghāyat al-ḥakīm, an anonymous twelfth-century book of magic. After summarizing the contents of the first book of the Kitāb al-nawāmīs, it explains that the magic works \"by means of the effects of images, the employment of spiritual powers, and the implanting of their powers in the motionless forms which consist of elemental substances so that they ebcome moving spiritual (forms) producing marvellous effects.\" According to David Pingree, the idea is that souls can be implanted in physical bodies allowing them to move. The effects produced will depend on the kinds of soul and body so combined. This underlying principle is derived from a statement in Plato's actual Laws, which is cited in the preface to the Kitāb al-nawāmīs, that the soul \"is the cause of change and of all motion for all things\".\nThe closest Arabic text to the Kitāb al-nawāmīs is the ʿUyūn al-ḥaqāʾiq wa iḍāh al-tarāʾiq ('sources of truths and explications of paths'), written by the alchemist Abū al-Qāsim al-ʿIrāqī in the thirteenth century. It contains 26 chapters that correspond to chapters in the Kitāb al-nawāmīs.\nAs a work of natural magic, the Kitāb al-nawāmīs avoided standard Christian objections to magic as demonic. Nevertheless, it was generally received negatively in the West. William of Auvergne, without rejecting to the efficacy of the magic, objected to its aims. The \"laws of Plato\" (leges Platonis) were contrary to the laws of nature. Nicole Oresme expressed similar views, although he objected specifically to the use of sperm, poisons and other \"abominable mixtures\" in magic, while the use of stone and plant matter was acceptable. The anonymous author of De mirabilibus mundi, however, had a high opinion of the Kitāb.\n\n\n== Translations, manuscripts and editions ==\nThe Arabic text is only partially preserved. A single short fragment of three pages can be found at the end of manuscript Arabe 2577 in Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France. It contains just three suffumigations. A fragment not much longer was reported by Paul Kraus from a manuscript privately held by the al-Ḥanjī family of Cairo. Its whereabouts are currently unknown. The Paris text was printed Abessattar Chaouech in 2006. A new edition with English translation was published in 2023.\nThe Kitāb al-nawāmīs is known primarily through a Latin translation made in Spain in the late twelfth century. The identity of the translator is unknown. The earliest citation of the Latin is from William of Auvergne in the 1220s. By the 1240s, a copy was in the library of Richard of Fournival.\nThere are 14 complete or partial manuscripts of the Latin version, all from between around 1200 and 1500. The oldest complete copy is CLM 22292 in the Bavarian State Library in Munich, from around 1200. One Latin manuscript—II.iii.214 of the Biblioteca Nazionale in Florence—has been printed. David Pingree was preparing an edition of the Latin text at the time of his death in 2005. His papers passed to the American Philosophical Society and the edition has not been published.\nThe Latin version was translated into Hebrew in the fourteenth century. The Hebrew version skips the first few experiments. There is a single manuscript of the Hebrew version, now Codex Hebraicus 214 in the Bavarian State Library.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Works cited ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==",

        "content": "Count Alexey Alexeyevich Ignatyev (Russian: Алексе́й Алексе́евич Игна́тьев; 1 March [O.S. 17 February] 1877 – 20 November 1954) was a Russian and Soviet military attaché, diplomat, lieutenant and later a memoirist.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBorn in the aristocratic Ignatiev family as the son of General Alexei Ignatiev and Countess Sophia Ignatieva, he graduated from the Vladimir Kiev Cadet Corps and was transferred to special classes of His Majesty's Page Corps. \nAfter the Russo-Japanese War broke out in 1904, Count Ignatyev volunteered for the front and took part in the fighting with distinction as a staff officer. After the war, his first assignment was as a Russian military attaché in France. He was then appointed to Denmark, Sweden and Norway as a full military attaché. In the increasingly tense international situation on the eve of the First World War, he was sent back to Paris with the rank of colonel by order of Tsar Nicholas II on March 12, 1912, where he became Russia's military representative at the French headquarters after the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. For his services he was awarded the Commander's Cross of the Legion of Honor.\nAfter the Russian February Revolution in 1917, he was appointed major general by the Provisional Government. After the October Revolution in Russia in 1917, Alexey Ignatyev put himself at the service of the newly established Soviet government. As the sole authorized person, he refused to hand over 225 million gold francs, which belonged to the Russian state and were deposited in Paris banks, to the counter-revolutionary Russian government in exile. Instead, he handed the money over to the Soviet government, which had no knowledge of the existence of these financial deposits.\nIgnatyev declined the offer to become a French citizen and general, however wever, he remained in France in the years that followed and, after diplomatic relations were established between the Soviet Union and France, he worked in the Soviet trade mission in Paris. In 1935, Ignatyev returned to the Soviet Union. Here he received his old rank back from the Red Army and was later promoted to lieutenant general. He survived the purges of the armed forces of the late 30s unscathed. Ignatyev took on responsible tasks in military training and left active service in 1947. After his retirement, Ignatyev dedicated his career to literature and most famously published his book of memoirs named \"Fifty Years of Service\".\nAs Ignatiev grew older, he became frequently ill. In the fall of 1953 he became so seriously ill that he had to be hospitalized, where he died a year later and was buried at the Novodevichy Cemetery.\n\n\n== References ==",

A week later on May 1, 1988, Khreish was found dead in the pine forest outside of Ghazir. Some reported that Khreish was shot 30 times, but the forensic doctor said Khreish was killed by 15 bullets, 13 of which were six millimeter and two 9 millimeter. His death was believed to be politically motivated, but the case was unsolved.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "KE Holdings Inc. (KE; Chinese: 贝壳控股有限公司; pinyin: Bèiké Kònggǔ Yǒuxiàn Gōngsī) is a publicly listed Chinese real estate holding company that engages in the provision of an integrated online and offline platform for housing transactions and services through its subsidiaries. It is the largest online real estate transaction platform in China.\nInvestors often refer to the collective business as \"Beike\".\n\n\n== Background ==\nLianjia (formerly Homelink) was founded as a real estate brokerage by Zuo Hui in November 2001 with an initial staff of 27 people.\nDue to the competition for real estate brokerages, information was not centralized and it was difficult to maintain accurate up to date information.  In April 2018, Zuo, Peng Yongdong and Shan Yigang launched Beike, an online platform that helps match customer to real estate agents. KE was incorporated in July 2018 as a holding company for both Lianjia and Beike.\nAt the start, Beike drew most of its senior management from Lianjia. It aimed to establish an independent third-party trading platform similar to Taobao that would allow resources to be open to all real estate agents. Zuo came up with the idea of an agent cooperation network after studying multiple service listing systems in the U.S.\nKE received financial backing from Tencent, SoftBank Group and Hillhouse Investment.\nIn August 2020, KE held its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) raising US$2.12 billion. On the first day of trading, the stock jumped 87% valuing the company at just under US$40 billion.\nIn May 2022, KE became a dual-listed company after it listed its shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.\n\n\n== Business structure ==\nKE owns two majors businesses. Lianjia and Beike. Lianjia is a real estate agent while Beike is an online platform that helps match customers to estate agents (which includes Lianjia). Lianjia has been compared to Redfin while Beike has been compared to Zillow. \nKE operates four business segments:\n\nExisting home transaction services\nNew home transaction services\nHome renovation and furnishing\nEmerging and other services\n\n\n== Controversies ==\nOn 20 May 2021, KE's co-founder and then chairman, Zuo died of illness resulting in KE's stock price dropping more than 10% afterwards. According to a shareholder, although Zuo was diagnosed with cancer several years ago, KE never disclosed his health issues in its regulatory filing which could raise the risk of allegations of failure to disclose key information. Peng succeeded by Peng who became KE's new chairman.\nShortly after, it was stated that the State Administration for Market Regulation was investigating KE for suspected anticompetitive practices. However KE via WeChat released a statement saying it was \"fake news\".\nIn December 2021, Muddy Waters Research announced it taken a short position against KE after it released a report stating that KE had committed \"systemic fraud\" and inflated its sales and revenue figures in its financial statements. KE stated the report was flawed and had used an invalid methodology although it would conduct an internal review of the allegations. Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP launched a class action lawsuit on behalf of investors against KE accusing its disseminating false and misleading Information. In April 2024, judge Gregory H. Woods dismissed most of the shareholder case but stated there was some validity based on the report that KE's filings did contain false statements.\nIn April 2022, KE was added to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission watchlist after failing afoul the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Haplomeryx is an extinct genus of Palaeogene artiodactyls belonging to the family Xiphodontidae. It was endemic to western Europe and lived from the middle Eocene up to the earliest Oligocene. Haplomeryx was first established as a genus by the German naturalist Max Schlosser in 1886 based on a molar tooth set from Quercy Phosphorites deposits. Three additional species were erected and classified to the xiphodontid genus while one other species, first recognized in 1822, was tentatively classified to it and remains unresolved in affinity.\nLittle is known about Haplomeryx due to its poor cranial and postcranial fossil records. Its dentition is thought to have been typical of xiphodonts such as Xiphodon and Dichodon because of most of its premolars being elongated, its dental differences being more specific compared to the other two genera. Although it may have displayed an evolutionary size increase by species, all of them remained very small in size especially in comparison to the two other xiphodont genera. It lived in western Europe back when it was an archipelago that was isolated from the rest of Eurasia, meaning that it lived in a tropical-subtropical environment with various other faunas that also evolved with strong levels of endemism. This meant that it coexisted with a wide variety of other artiodactyls and perissodactyls including the aforementioned xiphodont genera.\nIt and other xiphodont genera went extinct by the Grande Coupure extinction/faunal turnover event, coinciding with shifts towards further glaciation and seasonality plus dispersals of Asian immigrant faunas into western Europe. The causes of its extinction are attributed to negative interactions with immigrant faunas (resource competition, predation), environmental turnover from climate change, or some combination of the two.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n\nIn 1886, the German naturalist Max Schlosser erected the genus Haplomeryx, known solely from selenodont molars from the Quercy Phosphorites. He proposed that its dentition is most similar to that of Agriochoerus and established the species Haplomeryx zitteli based on an upper jaw fragment consisting of three molars that in total measure 14 mm (0.55 in) long. He noted its small size and theorized that it was the only European member of mammals that were of close affinities with the North American Agriochoerus. The etymology of the genus name derives in Ancient Greek from ἁπλόος (simple) and μήρυξ (ruminant) meaning \"simple ruminant\".\nIn 1910, the Swiss palaeontologist Hans Georg Stehlin made a review of Haplomeryx amongst other European artiodactyls, stating that he did not notice its fossils having been previously described under any synonymous name and that its overall anatomy is not known. The first species he erected was H. Picteti based on fossil previously described from Mormont in Switzerland, noting that the teeth are smaller than those of H. zitteli and that it has slightly different molar morphologies. The second and other species that Stehlin named was H. egerkingensis based on dentition from the Swiss municipality of Egerkingen. He also tentatively reclassified the species  Dichobune obliquum, previously described by the French naturalist Georges Cuvier in 1822 as Anoplotherium (Dichobune) obliquum, to Haplomeryx as H? obliquus. H? obliquus is known only by a single specimen from Montmartre in France, thus making its affinities problematic to resolve.\nThe French palaeontologist Charles Depéret established the species H. Euzetensis based on dental fossils from the French commune of Euzet in 1917. He said that the species was intermediate in size between H. zitteli and H. picteti.\n\n\n=== Classification ===\nHaplomeryx belongs to the Xiphodontidae, a Palaeogene artiodactyl family endemic to western Europe that lived from the middle Eocene to the early Oligocene (~44 Ma to 33 Ma). Like the other contemporary endemic artiodactyl families of western Europe, the evolutionary origins of the Xiphodontidae are poorly known. The Xiphodontidae is generally thought to have first appeared by MP14 of the Mammal Palaeogene zones, making them the first selenodont dentition artiodactyl representatives to have appeared in the landmass along with the Amphimerycidae. More specifically, the first xiphodont representatives to appear were the genera Dichodon and Haplomeryx by MP14. Dichodon and Haplomeryx continued to persist into the late Eocene while Xiphodon made its first appearance by MP16. Another xiphodont Paraxiphodon is known to have occurred only in MP17a localities. The former three genera lived up to the early Oligocene where they have been recorded to have all gone extinct as a result of the Grande Coupure faunal turnover event.\nThe phylogenetic relations of the Xiphodontidae as well as the Anoplotheriidae, Mixtotheriidae and Cainotheriidae have been elusive due to the selenodont morphologies (or having crescent-shaped ridges) of the molars, which were convergent with tylopods or ruminants. Some researchers considered the selenodont families Anoplotheriidae, Xiphodontidae, and Cainotheriidae to be within Tylopoda due to postcranial features that were similar to the tylopods from North America in the Palaeogene. Other researchers tie them as being more closely related to ruminants than tylopods based on dental morphology. Different phylogenetic analyses have produced different results for the \"derived\" (or of new evolutionary traits) selenodont Eocene European artiodactyl families, making it uncertain whether they were closer to the Tylopoda or Ruminantia. Possibly, the Xiphodontidae may have arisen from an unknown dichobunoid group, thus making its resemblance to tylopods an instance of convergent evolution.\nIn an article published in 2019, Romain Weppe et al. conducted a phylogenetic analysis on the Cainotherioidea within the Artiodactyla based on mandibular and dental characteristics, specifically in terms of relationships with artiodactyls of the Palaeogene. The results retrieved that the superfamily was closely related to the Mixtotheriidae and Anoplotheriidae. They determined that the Cainotheriidae, Robiacinidae, Anoplotheriidae, and Mixtotheriidae formed a clade that was the sister group to the Ruminantia while Tylopoda, along with the Amphimerycidae and Xiphodontidae split earlier in the tree. The phylogenetic tree published in the article and another work about the cainotherioids is outlined below:\n\nIn 2022, Weppe created a phylogenetic analysis in his academic thesis regarding Palaeogene artiodactyl lineages, focusing most specifically on the endemic European families. He stated that his phylogeny was the first formal one to propose affinities of the Xiphodontidae and Anoplotheriidae. He found that the Anoplotheriidae, Mixtotheriidae, and Cainotherioidea form a clade based on synapomorphic dental traits (traits thought to have originated from their most recent common ancestor). The result, Weppe mentioned, matches up with previous phylogenetic analyses on the Cainotherioidea with other endemic European Palaeogene artiodactyls that support the families as a clade. As a result, he argued that the proposed superfamily Anoplotherioidea, composing of the Anoplotheriidae and Xiphodontidae as proposed by Alan W. Gentry and Hooker in 1988, is invalid due to the polyphyly of the lineages in the phylogenetic analysis. However, the Xiphodontidae was still found to compose part of a wider clade with the three other groups. Within the Xiphodontidae, Weppe's phylogeny tree classified Haplomeryx as a sister taxon to the clade consisting of Xiphodon plus Dichodon.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nUnlike both Xiphodon and Dichodon with known evidence of complete sets of 44 teeth, the number of teeth present in Haplomeryx is unclear since it is only known by its sets of 3 molars, 4 premolars, and, in the case of H. zitteli, possibly a canine. Xiphodonts are characterized by indistinct canines in comparison to other teeth and elongated premolars. Xiphodontids additionally have molariform P4 teeth, upper molars with 4 to 5 crescent-shaped cusps, and selenodont lower molars with 4 ridges, compressed lingual cuspids, and crescent-shaped labial cuspids.\nHaplomeryx is not as well-described compared to Xiphodon or Dichodon. The upper molars are brachyodont (low-crowned) and have four crescent-shaped cusps, although H. egerkingensis has an additional small paraconule cusp. They also have W-shaped ectolophs (crests or ridges of upper molar teeth), curved mesostyle cusps, hollowed labial walls of the paracone plus mesocone cusps, and conical protocone cusps that are connected to the parastyle cusps. The P4 tooth appears short and triangular, and its lingual cusp is crescent-shaped. The lower premolars, with the exception of P4, are elongated in form. Its dentition appears similar to that of Dichodon, the main difference being that the parastyle cusp of Haplomeryx appears to be more prominent. The astragalus of H. euzetensis is narrow and elongated, appearing slightly slanted at its bottom end similar to those of Dacrytherium and Xiphodon.\nHaplomeryx is also diagnosed as being very small in size. While Haplomeryx may have displayed evolutionary size increases, it remained small-sized unlike Xiphodon and Dichodon, which both were both capable to growing to medium sizes. According to Jean Sudre, the upper molars belonging to H. picteti, H. euzetensis, and H. zitteli progressed in evolutionary chronology by increased sizes.\n\n\n== Palaeoecology ==\n\n\n=== Middle Eocene ===\n\nFor much of the Eocene, a hothouse climate with humid, tropical environments with consistently high precipitations prevailed. Modern mammalian orders including the Perissodactyla, Artiodactyla, and Primates (or the suborder Euprimates) appeared already by the early Eocene, diversifying rapidly and developing dentitions specialized for folivory. The omnivorous forms mostly either switched to folivorous diets or went extinct by the middle Eocene (47–37 Ma) along with the archaic \"condylarths\". By the late Eocene (approx. 37–33 Ma), most of the ungulate form dentitions shifted from bunodont cusps to cutting ridges (i.e. lophs) for folivorous diets.\nLand-based connections to the north of the developing Atlantic Ocean were interrupted around 53 Ma, meaning that North America and Greenland were no longer well-connected to western Europe. From the early Eocene up until the Grande Coupure extinction event (56 Ma - 33.9 Ma), the western Eurasian continent was separated into three landmasses, the former two of which were isolated by seaways: western Europe (an archipelago), Balkanatolia, and eastern Eurasia (Balkanatolia was in between the Paratethys Sea of the north and the Neotethys Ocean of the south). The Holarctic mammalian faunas of western Europe were therefore mostly isolated from other continents including Greenland, Africa, and eastern Eurasia, allowing for endemism to occur within western Europe. The European mammals of the late Eocene (MP17 - MP20 of the Mammal Palaeogene zones) were mostly descendants of endemic middle Eocene groups as a result.\nThe earliest species of Haplomeryx to appear in the fossil record is H. egerkingensis based on its restricted appearances at the Swiss localities of Egerkingen-Huppersand (MP13? or MP14?) and Egerkingen α + β (MP14). By then, it would have coexisted with perissodactyls (Palaeotheriidae, Lophiodontidae, and Tapiroidea), non-endemic artiodactyls (Dichobunidae and Tapirulidae), endemic European artiodactyls (Choeropotamidae (possibly polyphyletic, however), Cebochoeridae, and Anoplotheriidae), and primates (Adapidae). The Amphimerycidae made its first appearance by the level MP14. The stratigraphic ranges of the early species of Dichodon also overlapped with metatherians (Herpetotheriidae), cimolestans (Pantolestidae, Paroxyclaenidae), rodents (Ischyromyidae, Theridomyoidea, Gliridae), eulipotyphlans, bats, apatotherians, carnivoraformes (Miacidae), and hyaenodonts (Hyainailourinae, Proviverrinae). Other MP13-MP14 sites have also yielded fossils of turtles and crocodylomorphs, and MP13 sites are stratigraphically the latest to have yielded remains of the bird clades Gastornithidae and Palaeognathae.\nBased on the Egerkingen α + β locality, H. egerkingensis coexisted with the herpetotheriid Amphiperatherium, ischyromyids Ailuravus and Plesiarctomys, pseudosciurid Treposciurus, omomyid Necrolemur, adapid Leptadapis, proviverrine Proviverra, palaeotheres (Propalaeotherium, Anchilophus, Lophiotherium, Plagiolophus, Palaeotherium), tapiroid Chasmotherium, lophiodont Lophiodon, dichobunids Hyperdichobune and Mouillacitherium, choeropotamid Rhagatherium, anoplotheriid Catodontherium, amphimerycid Pseudamphimeryx, cebochoerid Cebochoerus, tapirulid Tapirulus, mixtotheriid Mixtotherium, and the xiphodont Dichodon.\nMP16 marks the first appearances of the species H. euzetensis and H. picteti based on their occurrences in French localities such as Lavergne. In Lavergne, fossils of the two Haplomeryx species were found with those of the herpetotheriids Amphiperatherium and Peratherium, pseudorhyncocyonid Leptictidium, nyctitheres Euronyctia and Saturninia, omomyids Necrolemur and Pseudoloris, theridomyids (Burgia, Elfomys, Glamys, Idicia), bats (Carcinipteryx, Hipposideros, Vaylatsia), proviverrine Allopterodon, carnivoraformes Quercygale and Paramiacis, cebochoerids Acotherulum and Cebochoerus, anoplotheriids Catodontherium and Dacrytherium, mixtothere Mixtotherium, dichobunids Dichobune and Mouillacitherium, amphimerycid Pseudamphimeryx, and the xiphodont Dichodon.\nAfter MP16, faunal turnover occurred, marking the disappearances of the lophiodonts and European tapiroids as well as the extinctions of all European crocodylomorphs except for the alligatoroid Diplocynodon. The causes of the faunal turnover have been attributed to a shift from humid and highly tropical environments to drier and more temperate forests with open areas and more abrasive vegetation. The surviving herbivorous faunas shifted their dentitions and dietary strategies accordingly to adapt to abrasive and seasonal vegetation. The environments were still subhumid and full of subtropical evergreen forests, however. The Palaeotheriidae was the sole remaining European perissodactyl group, and frugivorous-folivorous or purely folivorous artiodactyls became the dominant group in western Europe.\n\n\n=== Late Eocene ===\nIn the late Eocene, multiple species of Haplomeryx occur in western Europe. the temporal range of H. euzetensis continued up to MP18, whereas that of H. picteti extended up to either MP17b or MP18 based on its occurrence in the French locality of Enrouane R1. H. zitteli made its first appearance at MP18 and extended up to the MP20 range while H? obliquus occurred exclusively at the MP19 level. By that time, the Cainotheriidae and the derived anoplotheriids Anoplotherium and Diplobune both made their first fossil record appearances by MP18. In addition, several migrant mammal groups had reached western Europe by MP17a-MP18, namely the Anthracotheriidae, Hyaenodontinae, and Amphicyonidae. In addition to snakes, frogs, and salamandrids, rich assemblage of lizards are known in western Europe as well from MP16-MP20, representing the Iguanidae, Lacertidae, Gekkonidae, Agamidae, Scincidae, Helodermatidae, and Varanoidea, most of which were able to thrive in the warm temperatures of western Europe.\nIn the MP19 locality of Escamps, H. zitteli is recorded to have cooccurred with the likes of the herpetotheriids Amphiperatherium and Peratherium, pseudorhyncocyonid Pseudorhyncocyon, nyctitheres Saturninia and Amphidozotherium, bats (Hipposideros, Vaylatsia, Stehlinia), theridomyids (Paradelomys, Elfomys, Blainvillimys, Theridomys), adapid Palaeolemur, hyainailourine Pterodon, amphicyonid Cynodictis, palaeotheres Palaeotherium and Plagiolophus, dichobunid Dichobune, choeropotamid Choeropotamus, anoplotheriids Anoplotherium and Diplobune, cainotheres Oxacron and Paroxacron, amphimerycid Amphimeryx, and the other xiphodonts Xiphodon and Dichodon.\n\n\n== Extinction ==\n\nThe Grande Coupure extinction and faunal turnover event of western Europe, dating back to the earliest Oligocene (MP20-MP21), is one of the largest and most abrupt faunal events in the Cenozoic record, which is coincident with climate forcing events of cooler and more seasonal climates. The result of the event was a 60% extinction rate of western European mammalian lineages while Asian faunal immigrants replaced them. The Grande Coupure is often marked by palaeontologists as part of the Eocene-Oligocene boundary as a result at 33.9 Ma, although some estimate that the event began 33.6-33.4 Ma. The event correlates directly with or after the Eocene-Oligocene transition, an abrupt shift from a greenhouse world characterizing much of the Palaeogene to a coolhouse/icehouse world of the early Oligocene onwards. The massive drop in temperatures stems from the first major expansion of the Antarctic ice sheets that caused drastic pCO2 decreases and an estimated drop of ~70 m (230 ft) in sea level.\nThe seaway dynamics separating western Europe from other landmasses to strong extents but allowing for some levels of dispersals prior to the Grande Coupure are complicated and contentious, but many palaeontologists agreed that glaciation and the resulting drops in sea level played major roles in the drying of the seaways previously acting as major barriers to eastern migrants from Balkanatolia and western Europe. The Turgai Strait is often proposed as the main European seaway barrier prior to the Grande Coupure, but some researchers challenged this perception recently, arguing that it completely receded already 37 Ma, long before the Eocene-Oligocene transition. Alexis Licht et al. suggested that the Grande Coupure could have possibly been synchronous with the Oi-1 glaciation (33.5 Ma), which records a decline in atmospheric CO2, boosting the Antarctic glaciation that already started by the Eocene-Oligocene transition.\nThe Grande Coupure event also marked a large faunal turnover marking the arrivals of later anthracotheres, entelodonts, ruminants (Gelocidae, Lophiomerycidae), rhinocerotoids (Rhinocerotidae, Amynodontidae, Eggysodontidae), carnivorans (later Amphicyonidae, Amphicynodontidae, Nimravidae, and Ursidae),  eastern Eurasian rodents (Eomyidae, Cricetidae, and Castoridae), and eulipotyphlans (Erinaceidae).\nDespite previous suggestions that the last appearance of H. zitteli was by MP20, some authors suggested that Haplomeryx had an unresolved stratigraphic range and that it may have disappeared by MP19. Recent evidence attests to all three representatives Xiphodon, Dichodon, and Haplomeryx having been last recorded in MP20 localities. The disappearances of the three genera meant the complete extinction of the Xiphodontidae. Many other artiodactyl genera from western Europe disappeared also as a result of the Grande Coupure extinction event. The extinctions of Haplomeryx and many other mammals have been attributed to negative interactions with immigrant faunas (competition, predations), environmental changes from cooling climates, or some combination of the two.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Hamilton Tovey-Tennent (20 August 1782 – 4 March 1866) was a Scottish army officer in the East India Company.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nTovey-Tennent was born at Garrigheugh, Comrie, Perthshire, on 20 August 1782. He was the second son of John Tovey of Stirling, by his wife Hamilton, daughter of Sir James Dunbar of Mochrum and Woodside, third baronet, and judge-advocate of Scotland. He was educated at Stirling, and on 28 December 1798 received the commission of lieutenant in the Bombay military service. In 1801 he was posted to the 24th regular native infantry at Goa, and was employed on active service against the Mahrattas. In 1805, while serving under Lord Lake at the siege of Bhurtpore, he was severely wounded in an assault on the town. On 17 January 1811 he received the commission of captain. In 1813 he was placed in command of Ahmednuggar, and appointed brigade major at Poona. After more service against the Mahrattas, he was appointed in 1819 private secretary to Mountstuart Elphinstone, governor of Bombay. He was promoted to the rank of major on 19 January 1820, and accompanied Elphinstone on his tour through the province till November 1821, when he was compelled by the effect of his wounds to return to England. He retired from the service on 24 April 1824, being promoted to the rank of lieutenant-colonel. In 1832 he succeeded to the estates of his cousin, James Tennent of Pynnacles, Stanmore, Middlesex, and of Overton, Shropshire, and assumed his surname and arms. He died without issue, at Pynnacles, on 4 March 1866. In 1836 he married Helen, only daughter of General Samuel Graham, lieutenant-governor of Stirling Castle. Tovey-Tennent was a large contributor to charitable objects. Among other gifts he presented a site for a new church at Stanmore in 1854, and contributed 1,000l. to erect a school at Stirling. He was succeeded in his estates by his nephew, James Tovey-Tennent.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1886). \"Tovey-Tennent, Hamilton\".

In 2016, it received an award in the Tipos Latinos type design competition in Latin America. The typeface comes in two main variants, Archivo Narrow and Archivo Black.\nArchivo Narrow is a condensed version of the original design, suitable for use in tight spaces such as headlines. Archivo Black is bolder and has a more pronounced appearance. The Archivo typeface family features a classic style reminiscent of 19th-century typefaces. In 2021, the software was upgraded, and Archivo was also released as a variable font, allowing for adjustments in weight and width.\nArchivo is available in various file formats, comprising 641 glyphs, and supports writing in over 200 languages. It includes capital and small letters, numbers, punctuation marks, ligatures, diacritics and symbols. This makes it suitable for use in both print design (books, magazines, newspapers, posters etc.) and web applications. Additionally, it is an open-source typeface, meaning users can use it without cost or the need to credit the creator. Archivo and its variants are available for download from GitHub, Google Fonts, and other sources online.\n\n\n== Related pages ==\nTypography\nFont\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nSIL Open Font License\nType specimen\nFonts In Use (Archivo)\nGoogle Fonts\nGitHub\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The UC Davis pro-Palestinian campus occupation was established by the Davis Popular University for the Liberation of Palestine (UCD PULP) as part of a nationwide campus activism movement advocating for Palestinian rights and calling for university divestment from Israeli investments due to the ongoing conflicts in Gaza.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThis movement is part of a wider surge in campus activism across the United States, with similar protests occurring at institutions like Columbia University and UCLA. At Columbia, police action to clear an encampment led to a significant confrontation, highlighting tensions between protesters and authorities. UCLA also experienced violent clashes, as law enforcement intervened in demonstrations, reflecting the charged atmosphere around these protests. These events underscore a national dialogue on human rights and university investment policies, where students are pushing for changes to what they see as complicit financial activities by their institutions.\n\n\n== Events ==\nOn the morning of May 6, 2024, students from the Davis Popular University for the Liberation of Palestine (UCD PULP) began setting up tents at the Memorial Quad near the Memorial Union of UC Davis. The encampment quickly grew in size, drawing attention and participation from various student groups and community members. During the night, there were incidents involving non-university affiliated agitators, Jonathan Groveman and Dan Ovadia being identified, attempting to disrupt the peaceful protest. One such agitator, was particularly aggressive towards the protesters, leading to police intervention and detention. This event underscores the tensions surrounding the encampment as it continues to be a focal point for advocacy and conflict.\n\n\n== Demands ==\nThe protesters have articulated a range of demands aimed at addressing what they see as complicity in genocide and settler-colonialism by UC Davis and broader institutional networks. These demands include Chancellor Gary May's resignation from Leidos, ending the Koret program, divesting from companies that profit from Israeli policies, providing robust support for Palestinian students, and establishing comprehensive academic initiatives focused on Arab American and SWANA (Southwest Asian and North African) studies. They advocate for a transformative approach to how the university addresses issues of racism, colonialism, and global conflicts, emphasizing solidarity with Palestinian liberation efforts and broader anti-racist and anti-colonial principles.\n\n\n== Responses ==\nOn May 6, Chancellor Gary S. May issued a statement emphasizing UC Davis's commitment to a safe and peaceful campus environment that respects the community's right to free expression while maintaining educational and research missions without disruption. The university is actively engaging with students to mitigate any disruption and remains in contact with participants about their rights and responsibilities under the law and university policies. Chancellor May reaffirmed that as a public university, UC Davis supports peaceful protests and is committed to safety for all.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Protests, sit-ins, and demonstrations since 8 May against the Federal Government of Pakistan and the Government of Azad Kashmir demanding lower prices for wheat flour and electricity, in addition to other socialist demands.\nMany of the protests have been organized by the Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC) of Azad Kashmir, representing a variety of interests including traders, transporters, lawyers and students. The government attempted to preempt a planned demonstration on 12 May by arresting the movement's leaders, which inflamed the protesters and led to deadly clashes.\nThe protests are the culmination of a year-long movement against price rises and perceived injustices towards Azad Kashmir.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nAzad Kashmir (also called Azad Jammu and Kashmir, AJK) is a disputed region between Pakistan and India as part of the larger Kashmir Dispute. Azad Kashmir was liberated by Pakistani Forces in the First Kashmir War after the Karachi Agreement was reached to provide Kashmir a separate self-government rather than as another province. Kashmir was provided autonomy with its own Armed Forces, Prime Minister, and President. Overtime the Autonomy of Kashmir and other regions was slowly eroded or revoked.\nGenerally, the region experienced stability except for the Insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir in the 1980s in Indian-administered Kashmir, during which rebels flocked to Azad Kashmir to use as bases resulting in several cross border strikes.\nA radical change was occurring in Pakistan, which resulted in Imran Khan and his PTI party gaining power on a mandate of the populace to eradicate corruption; Like all provinces and territories in Pakistan, Imran Khan's PTI gained landslide victory in elections of Azad Kashmir and has been in Government since 2021. Due to conflict between Khan and the military on matters such as the collapsing economy, a no-confidence motion was brought in against Imran Khan, resulting in his removal from office. Imran Khan started mass demonstrations against his ouster, which were mostly backed by a populace although his support was waning due to his economic policies.\nAcross Pakistan rallies were held to support Imran Khan due to his popularity and Khan also received support from Kashmiris from Azad Kashmir. Khan's prominence wasn't to last much longer as hundreds of cases were registered against him and he was arrested which caused riots in Pakistan subsequently the Government and Intelligence dismantled his political party while he surrendered to authorities to face the courts. \nMeanwhile, protests were occurring in Azad Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan as well as several other regions across Pakistan for relief due to massive inflation and high food prices coupled with huge electricity bills. At the same time other movements across Pakistan were occurring such as demands for missing person investigations and Pashtun rights. Pakistan was going in a tough time with floods and political instability combinded with insurgencies intensifying. Pakistan's elections were planned for February and this would play a key role as It is believed, with some evidence, that Pakistan's elections were rigged by the government agencies which contributed to a divided electoral result with PPP taking Sindh, MQM taking Karachi, PML-N takeover of Punjab, Fractured Balochistan and PTI gaining total victories in KPK while also controlling Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Kashmir from early elections. In the Federal, A coalition of PPP, PML-N, PML-Q, MQM-P and independent candidates formed a government with Shehbaz Sharif as Prime Minister and Asif Ali Zardari as President. Due to the evidence of rigging, protests were organized by various political parties and violence also occurred such as the one on 9 February, when two PTI workers were killed and 24 others were injured in demonstrations against electoral fraud in Shangla District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\n\n=== Protests in Azad Kashmir ===\nThe protests in Azad Kashmir began in May 2023, in the town of Rawalakot, the headquarters of Poonch District. They were started by a few sit-in protestors against rising prices of wheat flour and electricity. They were soon followed by a boycott of electricity bills, which went unpaid in most areas of Azad Kashmir.\nThe protestors maintain that the power projects in Azad Kashmir generate 3,000 megawatts of cheap electricity, a third of Pakistan's power generation, but the Azad Kashmir consumers are charged prices five times the cost of production. This is said to be in violation of the Constitution of Pakistan which prohibits the government of Pakistan from making a profit from the residents of Azad Kashmir.\nSeveral rounds of negotiations between the governments of Azad Kashmir and Pakistan, as well as those between the Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC) and the government of Azad Kashmir have failed to produce results, leading the movement to question the mandate given by the United Nations to Pakistan during the Kashmir conflict.\nIn September 2023, protests were held in all major towns of Azad Kashmir with thousands of protestors, and traders' associations, transporters and lawyers observed a strike. A call for strike was also given for 5 February 2024, which is normally observed as the Kashmir Solidarity Day.\nMuzaffarabad Public Action Committees called for a \"long march\" to Muzaffarabad, the capital of Azad Kashmir, on Saturday, 11 May, to come from all parts of Azad Kashmir. The federal government mobilised 600 personnel of Punjab Constabulary and an unspecified number of Frontier Constabulary in a bid to block the march.\nThe AJK Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC) made ten demands to the government:\n\nWheat subsidy similar to Gilgit Baltistan\nElectricity tariff should be determined from the cost of electricity production from the Mangla Hydropower Project in AJK\nUnnecessary perks and privileges of the ruling class and officials should be completely eliminated\nRestrictions on student unions should be lifted, and elections should be conducted\nKashmir Bank should be scheduled\nMunicipal representatives should be given funds and powers\nCellular companies and internet services should be standardized\nProperty transfer taxes should be reduced\nAccountability Bureau should be made active in AJK and amendments should be made to the Act\nPractical restrictions should be imposed on tree cutting and legislation should be enacted to revitalize the local wood industry.\n\n\n== Clashes ==\n\n\n=== 9 May ===\nIn the intervening night of 8 and 9 May, the police arrested around 70 JAAC activists after raiding their residences and those of their relatives in Muzaffarabad and Mirpur divisions. In Muzaffarabad, the arrested activists included Shaukat Nawaz Mir, the elected leader of traders, and several other members of the action committee. In Mirpur's Dadyal Tehsil, a dozen activists were arrested, provoking clashes with traders on 9 May.\nA black Vigo vehicle usually associated with Pakistan's Intelligence Service was burned and two officers were injured. The government responded by deploying 5000 policemen and imposing section 144, which caused more clashes. The Inspector General of Police claimed that Indian Intelligence Agencies were involved. The federal cabinet after a consultation session approved the deployment of Frontier Constabulary (FC) in Azad Kashmir for the security of Chinese nationals and to assist the Azad Kashmir police and government.\n\n\n=== 10 May ===\nJAAC responded to the clashes by announcing its closure of business and calling for a strike on 11 May. Reportedly protestors used sticks and stones to pelt on the police, to which the police responded with shelling and baton charge. In the afternoon. sometime between 5 pm to 7 pm, the police resorted to aerial firing to deter the protesters. A school was tear-gassed but the home minister reported that the protestors had thrown a tear gas shell into the school. A state officer was also held hostage for 4 hours in the chaos. Several Police officers were assaulted as were dozens of protestors and the government claimed to arrest 25 foreign Indian agents at the time while hundreds more were arrested.\n\n\n=== 11 May ===\n11th May was to prove the most deadly day in the protests as the fake news narrative pushed the people. Across the region people rose up and rallied to protest, the police reportedly fled in one town rather then to confront the protestors, while in various places, the protestors assaulted the police, reportly throwing two policemen down from hills while two others rushed to save there lives. Some civilians, horrified by the violence, proceeded to throw themselves to save some policemen such as sitting in between to save them and allowing them to escape and halt the attack by protestors. Videos of the carnage would emerge all day and all night. At one spot the AK-47 rifle of a police officer was stolen, although in the video, it didn't have a magazine. One police officer was shot in the chest and died due to his wounds while more reports of clashes emerged. Although the police had access to heavy weapons such as assault rifles and armoured cars with machines guns, they showed restraint. Military vehicles and personnel were stopped and blocked from travelling across the region. \n\n\n=== 12 May ===\nA meeting was held between Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, President Asif Ali Zardari, Sultan Mehmood Chaudhry, and Chaudhry Anwarul Haq, and over the escalating tensions.\nA video emerged on X in the early hours of the morning showing a foiiur-minute clip of around 40-130 military vehicles crossing into Azad Kashmir from a bridge. These were believed to be carrying troops from the First strike corps heading to positions on the border or Frontier Corps Paramilitary.\nAt around 12:20 pm, large conveys of Rangers and military vehicles were spotted arriving in Azad Kashmir. 50 Pakistani army vehicles from Punjab and 65 Ranger vehicles from Murree were moving towards Kashmir. Reports of Rangers in Poonch and Muzaffarabad have emerged and it's reported some 1300 had been deployed. Mobile phone and internet services were suspended in different parts of AJK today including Bhimber and Bagh Towns.A Army Helicopter was spotted flying over a town in Kashmir.\nJAAC leaders responded to the violence by condemning it and advising its protestors to not go into anti Pakistan rhetoric nor to use violence but rather be peaceful , the leaders also said that they are pakistanis and \"love pakistan more then anyone else\".\nThe Government responded to the protests by suspending Internet in the Region while Prime Minister of Azad Kashmir offered to reconcile with talks and to negotiate with the JAAC and said that they had already worked out 99% of the demands.\nThe Protestors continued there long march on the Regional Capital Muzaffarabad although they set out on foot rather then vehicles , heading to rawalkot and other regions to hold rallies. At the time as per some reports , President Zardari ordered some rangers to pull out of the situation or not to go into action yet. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is to hold a emergency meeting tomorrow at 13th may with his cabinet , Interior Ministry Officals , Azad Kashmir Government Officals among others. President Zardari requested patience from both sides to work out a agreement.\nAt Between 5 pm Pakistan Time to 10 pm Pakistan Time , It is reported in the media that the Government has agreed to the demands of the JAAC to deal with the problems.But Bol News reported that the demands have not all been accepted yet and it remains inconclusive. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif  said on Sunday peaceful protests were a democratic right, but there should be “no tolerance” for violence.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

The game has played a role in reducing caste discrimination and other social barriers among South Asians. Cricket's role in South Asia has often been associated with local geopolitical events; for example, India-Pakistan matches have been affected and even cancelled at times due to tensions between the two countries, while the opposing sides in the Sri Lankan Civil War were willing to declare a ceasefire for the duration of the 2007 Cricket World Cup.\nCricket started to become the most popular sport of India after its 1983 Cricket World Cup victory. Another major milestone in Indian cricket was the 2007 launch of the Indian Premier League (IPL), which has become one of the wealthiest sports leagues in the world.\nIndia and Pakistan have a very heated cricket rivalry, with India-Pakistan cricket matches (particularly at global events) being some of the highest-viewed matches in global sport. Cricket has been suggested by a number of commentators as a possible way to create peace between the two countries.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSport in South Asia\nSouth Asian diaspora#Sport\nStreet cricket (also known as gully cricket in South Asia)\nTennis ball cricket\nGillidanda\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nCricket, terrorism and security in contemporary South Asia",

        "content": "The Bury Chronicle (Latin: Chronica or Cronica Buriensis), Bury St Edmunds Chronicle, or Chronicle of Bury St Edmunds is a medieval English chronicle compiled by John of Taxster and two other unknown Benedictine monks of Bury St Edmunds Abbey in the 13th and 14th centuries.\n\n\n== Authorship ==\nThe first part of the Bury Chronicle was compiled by John of Taxster, who claimed to have joined the monastery in 1255. From the year 1265, another monk continued his work and, from Easter 25 March 1296, a third monk continued their work. The second author also revised Taxster's account, including some additional information on the monastery's finances and adding several passages from a few classical authors and medieval historians. The third author did not share the second's interest in financial matters, although he continued to record military and local details.\n\n\n== Contents ==\nThe Bury Chronicle generally directly copies its source texts from the Creation to the year 1212. Most items up to 1131 are taken from John of Worcester. Marginalia in the revised and continued version note its additions to Taxster's account came from Apuleius, Orosius, Eutropius, Boethius, Freculf, Marianus Scotus, and Florence of Worcester.\nAlthough the account has been said to end in 1301, its general record actually ends in 1300 with only minor entries afterwards in the years 1301, 1313, 1326, 1329, 1334, and 1335.\n\n\n== Manuscripts ==\nTaxster's section of the Bury Chronicle survives in 2 manuscripts. The first, possibly Taxster's own holograph, comprises folios 3 to 43 verso of British Library MS Cotton Julius A 1. It was damaged somewhat by the 1731 Cottonian Library fire. The other comprises folios 109 to 124 verso of Arundel MS 6, once the property of John Erghome (fl. 1353–1385), Edward North, and William Howard and now held by the College of Arms, used as a continuation of a version of John of Worcester's Chronica Chronicarum (Chronicle of Chronicles). This only contains the first continuation to Taxster's work, ending in 1295.\nThe revised and fully continued version of the chronicle is Arundel MS 30, held by the College of Arms. As of 2002, Antonia Gransden's 1956 dissertation providing it was the only edition of the chronicle's initial section before 1212. She subsequently published the section from 1212 to 1301 in 1964.\nJohn of Worcester's Chronicle of Chronicles was also appended with Taxster's notes in the version held as Cambridge Corpus Christi College MS 92. The Colchester Chronicle (BL Harley MS 1132) is another version of the Bury Chronicle, unusual in specifically crediting William of Malmesbury for its treatment of Sceafa.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===",

        "content": "Stephen LeRoy Wilcox (October 9, 1899 – August 13, 1978) was an American ornithologist and prolific bird bander.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nLeRoy Wilcox was born in Speonk, a village in Southampton, Suffolk County, New York. He attended Tanners Neck School, Westhampton, Westhampton Beach High School, and Cornell University, where he studied poultry and game breeding. and took courses with Arthur A. Allen, who in 1916 established the first courses in ornithology and wildlife conservation in the United States. After an interval as proprietor of The Brushy Neck Pheasantry, where he bred ring neck pheasants and trap-nested single comb white leghorns, LeRoy took over operations of the oldest commercial duck farm in the United States, the Oceanic Duck Farm, which had been founded in 1883 by his father Eugene O. Wilcox.\nLeRoy married Georgianna Robinson in 1922. They had two daughters, Janice and Jean, and a son, David.\n\n\n== Career ==\nLeRoy Wilcox became a bird bander in 1927 and spent more than 25 years studying piping plover (Charadrius melodus), producing the first detailed study of the bird and having more returns \"than the combined total of all other banders.\" He was also specially interested in Osprey, Common Tern, Oystercatcher, and Willet, banding thousands of birds each year (with more than 132,000 in his lifetime), carrying out bird censuses, and regularly publishing observations in The Auk, the Kingbird, The Wilson Bulletin, and other bird club and ornithological publications. He was responsible for a number of \"firsts,\" sightings of rare birds in New York and the United States, and at least one \"oldest.\" He also gave illustrated lectures on bird banding at the American Museum of Natural History, in New York City, at the Academy of Sciences, in Philadelphia, and at the United States National Museum, in Washington, D.C.\nLeroy was a member of several scientific societies (the American Ornithological Union, the National Audubon Society, the Linnaean Society, the Eastern Bird Banding Association, the Wilson Ornithological Club, Yale's Lepidopterists’ Society, and the American Malacological Union, whose members appreciate mollusks) and collaborated widely with researchers attached to the Cornell Duck Research Laboratory in Eastport, Long Island, and with other ornithologists and members of the Linnaean Society. He banded nestlings on Gardiners Island, New York, for more than 20 years, and worked with other ornithologists to help to understand how DDT contributed to the decline of Ospreys in southern New England and on Long Island.\nLeroy's interests were not confined to birds. He also studied botany, insects, fish, reptiles, and mammals. He was also a keen local historian and genealogist.\n\n\n== References ==",

A notable article by American media figure Jacoba Atlas in November 1971, which appeared in the pages of the U.S. entertainment magazine Billboard, used the explicit title \"There Aren't Many Girls In Hard Rock, But A New Day (And Attitude) Is Dawning\". Atlas argued that popular stereotypes and other expressions of prejudice in American society focusing on gender identity warped musical production, with her remarking that this intellectual framework meant that hard rock's presentation as \"raw, aggressive, driving, [and] electric\" became forcibly divorced from \"our culture's assessment of the essence of femininity\". Atlas additionally opinioned that \"the traditional role of the woman\", which includes \"sexist\" expectations about how women cannot \"scream and sweat\" or otherwise do certain things, \"have conspired to keep women... from coming to the forefront\" of hard rock (or rock music generally). Although writing for a major commercial publication, Atlas criticized the music industry of the time.\n\nProminent examples of female hard rock vocalists include Janis Joplin, regarded as one of the most iconic women in heavy music who's \"tragic\" death early in life \"left a void\", and Grace Slick, known for rising to fame as a member of the band Jefferson Airplane. Slick has been described as like a rebellious \"goddess\" given how even after attaining commercial success she \"has always lived as an outlaw.\" In addition, the musical group Fanny has been labeled \"the first successful all-girl rock band\".\nThe band Joy of Cooking featured female vocalists Toni Brown and Terry Garthwaite, and they've also been highlighted as \"well-known hard rock singers.\"  As recounted by the American news agency KQED, \"Garthwaite can’t remember every inane comment she’s received from a man who seemed threatened or confused by her.\" Discussing past instances of misogyny, Garthwaite later noted a time around 1970 when she had gone into a business to buy guitar strings and encountered a man who told her: \"If I close my eyes and forget that there are women in the band, [then] it sounds really good\". The guitarist, singer, and songwriter opined that said social culture \"was, in a nutshell, the [common] perspective\" and that she'd additionally faced the \"[s]ame thing with the... record companies.\" Analyzing the initial development of hard rock related styles and the spread in popular culture of rock music in general, KQED has reported that for \"women musicians... there really was only a sliver of attention— and money, and festival slots, and airtime— to go around.\"\nPublications such as the online news service Consquence have described cultural changes after the end of the 20th century and onwards with respect to women in hard rock music, with a June 2002 piece on musician Lzzy Hale of the band Halestorm detailing her account of the \"night and day\" evolution to the extent that trends have \"completely flipped.\" She remarked in depth, \"It used to be that not only was I the only girl in a band onstage but I was the only girl on tour, and now that's not the case...

        "content": "Jilson Dove (c. 1785 – June 14, 1853) was a resident of Washington, D.C. in the United States. He worked at a number of occupations including federal police officer guarding Native American delegations visiting the city, municipal constable, fishmonger, restauranteur, real estate agent, and slave trader. In the 1830s he caught the attention of abolitionists, in part due to his work as a local slave patroller. Dove would probably have been considered a slave-trading \"agent\", meaning a second-tier trader who primarily concentrated on local, small-scale buying for resale to the larger interstate slave dealers.\n\n\n== Life and work ==\nDove was born in the state of Virginia around 1785. Dove was married in Baltimore, Maryland in 1810 to Mary Drugan. Dove served as a sergeant in the District of Columbia militia during the War of 1812. In 1813, when he was about 28 years old, he announced in the newspaper that he was ending his business partnership but would continue in the brickmaking business independently. Dove advertised twice in the Alexandria Gazette in 1816, in February he had for sale some Waterloo-striped calico fabric, and in June he offered newly arrived pickled oysters. In 1819 he was suspended from his Masonic lodge for \"unmasonic conduct\". The same year, he was to take the oath of an insolvent debtor in an Alexandria, District of Columbia courtroom. \n\nIn spring 1820 he was advertising real estate to Alexandria buyers. He was enumerated as a resident of Washington, D.C. at the time of the 1820 census. His obituary later stated that he had moved from Virginia to D.C. in around 1820. By 1821 he was operating a fish market at the Red House Landing below Alexandria. Two years later he was to be confined in prison as a debtor. His fortunes seemed to turn somewhat after that, as he became a host of the Union Hotel, which boasted of its fine green turtle dinner, and canvasback ducks available for either dinner service or for sale to home cooks. By the end of the decade he operated and advertised an \"elegant refectory\" adjacent to a coffeehouse, and he also sought to buy and sell quality secondhand furniture.  \nIn June 1833, Benjamin Lundy, a highly influential early abolitionist, mentioned Jilson Dove in his newspaper Genius of Universal Emancipation:\n\nLast week, a very decent, orderly-looking, colored woman, was coming over the bridge to our city to get employ, it is said. She was seen by a man, named Jilson Dove, a constable, who buys and catches negroes for the traders. The woman finding she was about to be taken to the pen or enclosure,—where all kidnapped and others are put, before taken to the south,—got loose, and attempted to run away from the constable—but he followed her so close, she had no way to escape but by jumping into the river, where she was drowned. No fuss or stir was made about it,—she was got out of the river, and buried—and there the matter ended.\n\nIt was in the 1830s that Dove turned to slave-trading on a continuing basis, although he continued to engage in other work. He was a third-ward constable for the District of Columbia Police Department in 1832, a salaried job that paid $50 a year. For example, in February and March of 1833 Dove was paid by U.S. Senator Henry Clay to drive his cattle between Kentucky and Pennsylvania. In 1832 a Welsh newspaper reprinted several slave-trade ads from the Washington Intelligencer, including one of Washington Robey's, and commented that they would be read with \"astonishment and disgust.\" The first listed was placed by Jilson Dove and stated \"Money ! Money ! Money !— I wish to purchase from twenty to thirty likely young Negroes of both sexes from twelve to twenty -five years of age. For all or part I will give more money than anyone in Washington City or Montgomery County, Md. Apply to the subscriber near the corner of the 13th and E streets Nov 24 JILSON DOVE.\" In 1833, Dove was working out of the Hendley Tavern and was willing trade for houses for \"servants,\" which was one of the preferred euphemisms used in polite discourse to describe enslaved black people. In Slave-Trading in the Old South (1931), historian Frederic Bancroft wrote that: \"Jilson Dove, probably a real estate agent, wished 'to purchase from forty to fifty Negroes of both sexes, from the age of twelve to twenty-five', and to give in exchange two two-story brick houses in the business part of Washington. Obviously he was agent for some interstate trader when he later 'wanted immediately from 25 to 30 negroes of both sexes'. As this was more than the District was likely to supply, it was an appeal to Maryland and Virginia. The trading in District slaves—which was relatively slight, spasmodic and carried on chiefly by agents—also comprised, of course, sales to settle estates, collect debts and pay for fines and jail fees.\" The Journal of Negro History observed that \"in 1837 Jilson Dove, in an advertisement in the National Intelligencer, offered his services as an agent to secure for the people of the District of Columbia servants for their own use, also to dispose of those servants whom the owners desired to be kept in the District\". Historian Steven Deyle commented on this, writing that slave traders \"adjusted their practices to cater to their customers' (and society's) paternalistic tastes...Many made direct appeals to owners' paternalistic sensibilities...Some even appeared to specialize in this market. Most of Jilson Dove's notices were for purchases in the interregional trade, but during the summer of 1837 he offered 'his services as an agent to the citizens of Washington to furnish them with servants for their own use. Persons wishing to sell their servants, to remain in this place, will please give me a call, as I can at all times get them a good home.'\" In 1838 Dove was offering to trade land in Illinois for \"negroes\". That year he apparently traded out of Lloyd's Steamboat Hotel on Seventh Street \"opposite the Center Market House\". In 1839 he offered a house and lot in exchange for valuable servants. As the decade turned, Dove began was working as a slave trader from a location on Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nMeanwhile, according to a history of Native American treaty delegations in Washington, Dove apparently also was known to intercede in potential scraps between intoxicated indigenous men and local street toughs: \"Street gangs turned the intemperance of the Winnebagos into a cruel sport. They would wait outside the hotel for the inebriated Indians to stray their way and then 'beat them severly & [were] even disposed to kill them.' The Winnebagos were frequently saved from catastrophe by Jilson Dove, a street vendor who took a samaritan-like interest in their welfare. Described as 'a very powerful & resolute man,' Dove would rescue the Winnebagos from the hooligans and return them to their quarters. The Indian Office gave Dove eighty dollars in appreciation for this valuable service after the Winnebagos left Washington.\" Dove was paid $66 in 1852 for \"serving as police officer in charge of Indian delegation\" for visitors to Washington from the \"wild prairie tribes\".\n\nDove seemed to slow down a bit in the 1840s. In 1841 and 1844 he was paid to whitewash the Center Market House. He advertised \"cash for negroes\" once in 1842, and reported that he had found a pocketbook on the road to Bladensburg containing cash and a gold ring. In 1844 he was paid $150 for the work of \"taking up incendiaries,\" meaning investigate a series of arson fires in the area. Dove died in Washington, D.C. in 1853 at age 68. Dove and his wife are both buried at Trinity United Methodist Church Cemetery in Alexandria, Virginia under an obelisk-shaped grave marker.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of American slave traders\nHistory of slavery in Washington, D.C.\nSlave markets and slave jails in the United States\nBibliography of the slave trade in the United States\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===",

        "content": "\"Wranglers\" is a song by the American country music singer Miranda Lambert. It was released on May 3, 2024, and went for immediate adds at country radio as the lead single from her forthcoming tenth solo studio album, and first since signing a new label partnership with Republic Records and Big Loud.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\"Wranglers\" was written by Ryan Carpenter, Audra Mae, and Evan McKeever, and Lambert co-produced the track with Jon Randall in Austin, Texas at Arlyn Studios. This marks the second single Lambert cut written by Mae after \"Little Red Wagon\" for Platinum. Mae also provides backing vocals on the track. Lambert first announced the release of \"Wranglers\" and posted its cover artwork on April 23, 2024, via her Instagram account.\nDescribed as a \"classic stadium-ready anthem\", Lambert drew comparisons to her own hit \"Gunpowder & Lead\", saying that \"it's a classic tale of a woman taking her power back. I think we can all identify with the character in this song, because we have all had a time in our life where we needed to find our strength, and also get a little revenge on someone who did us wrong or hurt us. This offers such a cool, raging take on how something like this unravels; I think the songwriters nailed it\". The hook of the female empowerment anthem refers to the protagonist setting fire to her exes' belongings, specifically his Wrangler brand jeans.\n\n\n== Live performances ==\nLambert debuted \"Wranglers\" live for the first time at her headlining stint at Stagecoach Festival on April 27, 2024.\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\n\"Wranglers\" debuted at number 37 on the Billboard Country Airplay chart week dated May 18, 2024.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

The bridge is one of two bridges connecting Marco Island with the main land, with the other being the S.S. Jolley Bridge further west.  The is 55 feet tall and carries two lanes of County Road 92 (San Marco Road) over the Marco Channel.\n\n\n== History ==\nOriginally known as the Goodland Bridge, the Stan Gober Memorial Bridge was built in 1975, replacing a wooden swing bridge.  The original bridge was built in 1938 and it was the first vehicle bridge to connect Marco Island with the main land.  The original bridge's iron swing span had been used previously on a bridge over the Caloosahatchee River near Fort Myers from 1924 to 1931.  The original bridge's construction was funded by the Works Progress Administration (WPA), an agency created by President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal.  Before the bridge was built, a ferry service connected the Isles of Capri with Marco Island.  Ruins of the original bridge remain today just to the south of the current bridge.\nThe current bridge was named after Stan Gober in 2012, who was the owner and operator of Stan's Idle Hour, a restaurant in Goodland.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Chevilly-Larue station is an upcoming underground station on Line 14 of the Paris Métro. It is part of the Grand Paris Express project. The station is located in the town of Chevilly-Larue, near the Rungis International Market (Marché International). The station is located beneath Avenue de la Cité and Rue de Thiais with entrances on both sides and offers connections to Île-de-France tramway Line 7, the Trans-Val-de-Marne (Tvm) bus rapid transit line, and local bus routes.\n\n\n== History ==\nFollowing a competitive bidding process in March 2018, a consortium led by Razel-Bec (a Fayat Group company) was awarded the contract for the station's civil engineering works. This comprehensive project encompassed the construction of molded walls, earthworks, and essential infrastructure. Since July 2021, Razel-Bec has spearheaded the development phase, which includes the superstructure (including surface buildings) and major interior works. The Brunet Saunier Architecture firm won the contract to design the station. Swiss artists Gerda Steiner and Jurg Lenzlinger, collaborating with architect Jérôme Brunet, created unique artwork for the station.\nThe station was initially designated Porte de Thiais, consistent with existing bus and tram stops. Several mayors in Val-de-Marne disagreed with the chosen names for three stations, including this one, arguing they didn't reflect their actual locations. In September 2022, the station was officially renamed Chevilly-Larue, with Marché International remaining as a subtitle.\n\n\n== References ==",

He served as the 12th Speaker of the Northern Mariana Islands House of Representatives during the 15th Commonwealth Legislature.\nIn 2000, he was serving as House Floor Leader and sponsored a bill that would amend the Weapons Control Act to allow the use of firearms on shooting resorts. Proponents of the bill stated that it would lure investors while detractors of the bill worried it would harm public safety. The House approved the bill on a narrow vote.\nDuring the administration of Governor Eloy Inos, he served as Secretary of the Department of Public Lands. He continued in that position under Governor Benigno R. Fitial until Fitial fired him for endorsing incumbent Gregorio Sablan for reelection to Congress. In the early months of his administration, Governor Arnold Palacios appointed Babauta as the special assistant for administration.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Sunday Painters were an Australian avant-pop band formed in Wollongong in 1979 by Peter MacKinnon on guitar and Peter Raengel on vocals, guitar, bass guitar and keyboards. In 1982 Dennis Kennedy joined on bass guitar but switched to lead guitar in 1984. The group issued two studio albums, Something to Do (1982) and Fourth Annual Report (1983), before disbanding in 1986. American label, What's Your Rupture?, compiled their early extended plays and a live album, which was issued as In My Dreams, in 2015. Peter Raengel died in September 2008.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Sunday Painters were an Australian avant-pop band formed in Wollongong in 1979 by Bruce Ellis on synthesisers (ex-Art Throbs), Peter MacKinnon on guitar, Katherine Lorenc on vocals, flute and keyboards and Peter Raengel on vocals, guitar, bass guitar and keyboards (ex-Winged Death, Art Throbs). Ellis and Raengel had performed in various groups since secondary school and formulated the Sunday Painters' direction as \"part-pop/rock garage band, part-classical experimentalists\", with a political focus on oppression, alienation, pain and identity seeking. One of their previous bands, Art Throbs, were recorded by Ellis at Sydney University. Both MacKinnon and Raengel had attended Wollongong High School. Raengel later recalled \"We weren't actually musicians before we started, we started off learning our instruments and writing songs.\"\nTwo extended plays with three tracks each were issued during 1980, Alternatives to Perfection (April) and Painting by Numbers (1980). Australian musicologist Ian McFarlane found them \"strangely appealing\" as they demonstrated a garage rock and early Velvet Underground sound. Their third EP, Three Kinds of Escapism, followed in 1981. The group's debut studio album, Something to Do, was released in 1982. McFarlane determined that it \"displayed an extraordinary breadth of stylistic reference\", citing influences from United Kingdom band Wire for their track \"Emotion Sickness\" to 1970s krautrockers, Faust and Neu!, for \"ECT\". In 1982 Dennis Kennedy joined on bass guitar; by 1984 Ellis and Lorenc had left and Kennedy switched to lead guitar. Allan Coop joined on bass guitar and Eddie Zeidan on alto saxophone.\nFourth Annual Report is their second studio album, which was issued in late 1983. McFarlane observed that it varied \"from the abrasive ('God is My Biro', 'Concertina') and the eerie ('Surface Paradise') to soundscapes of the epic kind ('Through a Shattered Lens').\" MacKinnon left soon after the album appeared. Further changes occurred to the line-up with successive bass guitarists Kerrie Erwin and Tony Tziolas; as well as Chris Flanagan joining on drums. However, no new material was recorded and the group disbanded in 1986. Peter Raengel died in September 2008, aged 47. American label, What's Your Rupture?, compiled their early EPs and a live album, which was issued as In My Dreams, in 2015. To explain the group's lack of contemporaneous recognition, Illawarra Mercury's Glen Humphries described their material, \"a mix of full-on electronic noise, rock, discordant pop, classical, punk, jazz and whatever else they wanted to play - was probably too out there for Wollongong in the 1980s.\"\n\n\n== Members ==\nBruce Ellis – synthesisers\nPeter MacKinnon – guitar\nKatherine Lorenc – vocals, flute, keyboards\nPeter Raengel – vocals, guitar, bass guitar, keyboards (died 2008)\nDennis Kennedy – bass guitar, guitar\nAllan Coop – bass guitar\nEddie Zeidan – alto saxophone\nKerrie Erwin – bass guitar\nTony Tziolas – bass guitar\nChris Flanagan – drums\nSource:\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nSomething to Do (1982) – Terminal Records\nFourth Annual Report (1983) – Terminal Records\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\nIn My Dreams (2015) – What's Your Rupture?\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\nOn the Beach (1983)\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\nLike a Reptile (1979)\nIn My Dreams (1980)\nAlternatives to Perfection (April 1980)\nPainting by Numbers (October 1980)\nThree Kinds of Escapism (1981)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Website archived from original on 25 June 2013, retrieved 12 May 2024.",

        "content": "The concept of the three-zone garden, also known as Hortus, is a combination of permaculture and wildlife garden elements. It is not to be confused with the USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 3. \nThe aim of Three-Zone-Gardening is to create a garden that contributes to strengthening local biodiversity and allows food to be grown sustainably without the addition of external resources such as fertilizer. The model is adapted to a temperate climate and always consists of the following three zones: buffer zone, hotspot zone and yield zone. The species-rich hotspot zone, with its poor soils, supplies the nutrients for the yield zone in which fruit and vegetables are grown.\nThe concept was developed by german nurse and garden book author Markus Gastl. In the 'Hortus Network', which he also initiated, over seven hundred gardens that work according to the three-zone model are networked. The Hortus Network is an official project of the United Nations Decade on Biodiversity.\n\n\n== Nutrient flow in the three-zone garden ==\nBy deliberately keeping the hotspot zone nutrient-poor, nitrogen-rich green waste is constantly produced in a three-zone garden, which is used as fertilizer for the yield zone. This ensures the biological diversity of the hotspot zone, as stronger plants cannot settle there and displace the native flowering plants. The garden's own fertilizer replaces external fertilizers and substrates used in many other gardens. In order to ensure a sufficient nutrient supply to the yield zone, both areas must be in a suitable size ratio to one another and the runoff of nutrients from the yield zone must be prevented. A dry separation toilet, for example, closes the nutrient gap that would otherwise arise from consuming the gardens food.\n\n\n== Hotspot zone ==\n \nThe hotspot zone replicates increasingly rare, nutrient-poor habitats from the natural and cultivated landscape. IIt is characterized by a greatly reduced humus content and offers a habitat for many threatened native flowering plants, for which it becomes increasingly difficult to prevail against high-growth nitrogen indicator plants in a cultivated landscape that is often over-fertilized.\nIntegrated 'nature modules' (see below) offer ecological niches for numerous insects and wild animals. The areas of the hotspot zone can be gradually emaciated by removing the clippings after mowing. Alternatively, a poor soil condition can be artificially achieved when the garden is being laid out by removing the humus layer or applying mineral substrate (gravel, sand or broken brick). Mowing the poor areas only takes place once or twice a year, but is essential for maintaining the poor soils, as the clippings are removed from the hotspot zone and therefore do not contribute to fertilizing the areas. This corresponds to historical models from agriculture before the introduction of mineral fertilizers. The long intervals between mowing operations help insects to use the plants more successfully as a nesting place for reproduction.\n\n\n== Yield zone ==\nThe yield zone corresponds to an ecologically managed kitchen garden, planted in mixed culture. To increase soil fertility, this zone is fertilized with green waste and organic material from the other two zones. This happens, among other things, through surface fertilization with mulch.\n\n\n== Buffer zone ==\nThe buffer zone shields the garden from the outside. It consists of hedge structures of native wild plants and primarily serves as a refuge and food source for wild animals. The cuttings from this zone are also predominantly brought to the yield zone.\n\n\n== Nature modules and super beds ==\n\nNature modules are individual design elements in the three-zone garden that have a particular benefit for wild animals. These are predominantly built in the buffer and hotspot zones and ensure a high level of structural diversity. Examples of this are dry stone walls as heat storage for heat-loving species, deadwood hedges, watering holes, permanently moist habitats for beetles (beetle cellars) or nesting aids for ground-nesting insects (sandarium). The natural modules create numerous microclimate zones within a zone, from full sun to shady, and ecological niches. The modules provide shelter, night and winter quarters and are used as breeding grounds or hunting grounds.\nGastl describes raised beds as superbeds because, depending on the substrate and plants used, they can be used as a lean location (hotspot zone) or vegetable patch (yield zone). They can be used to create all zones even in small gardens and in larger gardens they increase the structural diversity and thus usually also the species diversityt, because the three zones are less clearly demarcated.\n\n\n== Hortus Network ==\nThe Hortus Network is a network of gardeners who are developing their garden into a three-zone garden. The Hortus network and the participating gardens are part of the UN Decade of Biological Diversity. According to information on the network's own website, there are currently over 750 participating gardens in Germany, Austria, France, Croatia, Hungary, Switzerland and the USA.\n\n\n== Markus Gastl ==\nThe concept of the three-zone garden was developed by Markus Gastl after a two and a half year bicycle trip from Tierra del Fuego to Alaska in order to do something for the local nature out of gratitude for the experience[7]. His idea was to combine the classic wildlife garden, which primarily serves to promote biodiversity, with elements of permaculture, which historically primarily teaches the sustainable cultivation of crops in mixed culture. The first project was Gastl's own 7,500 m² garden in Beyerberg, Bavaria. The garden is now called 'Hortus Insectorum' and is accessible as a show garden. In 2018, Gastl was awarded the Bavarian State Medal for special services to the environment.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPermaculture\nWildlife garden\nAlkaline grassland\n\n\n== Literature ==\nMarkus Gastl: Three-Zone Garden: Diversity · Beauty · Benefits, 2015, Pfeil Verlag, Germany, ISBN 978-3-89937-154-3.\nMarkus Gastl: Permaculture and natural gardens, 2021, Ulmer Verlag, Germany, ISBN 978-3-8186-1376-1.\nMarkus Gastl: More nature in the garden: Simple projects with a big impact for vibrant diversity, 2021, Ulmer Verlag, Germany, ISBN 978-3-8186-1346-4.\n\n\n== Web links ==\nGerman-language website of the Hortus Network\nWebsite of the first three-zone garden by Markus Gastl\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Geraldo Barreto (born April 27,1974), better known by his stage name as Jise One, is an American rapper and member of the hip-hop/rap group Arsonists. \n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nGeraldo Barreto was born April 27, 1974, in New York City and was raised in Brooklyn, NY. During his childhood, his older brother, who went by the nickname Jise, was murdered. In honor of his brother, he adopted the stage name Jise.\n\n\n== Arsonists ==\nIn 1993, Jise, along with 4 others; Q-Unique, D-Stroy, Freestyle, and Swel Boogie, founded the hip-hop/rap group Arsonists in Bushwick, Brooklyn, NY. ￼, which originally went by the name Bushwick Bomb Squad. The group eventually grew to eight members, with the induction of three new members, Kinetic NRG, Ching Rock, and Kriminal Krash. The group then released a single, \"The Session\", in 1996, which was played on New York radio and brought offers from record labels. They signed with the label Fondle 'Em Records and changed their name of the group to the Arsonists. They released their first album, As the World Burns, in 1999 on Matador Records, an indie rock label that ventured into hip hop music for the release. The album received critical acclaim, but did not achieve mainstream commercial success; it reached No. 78 on Billboard's Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. The group went from eight members to five members down to three: Q-Unique, Jise One and Swel Boogie, for their follow-up album, Date of Birth in 2001. Kansas City's alternative weekly newspaper, The Pitch, described them as \"one of the best live bands in hip-hop\" in 2001. On 18 August 2011, Arsonists played the first show in 11 years that had all four members on stage at Hip Hop Kemp in Hradec Králové, Czech Republic.\n\n\n== Solo career ==\nJise, during his tenure with the Arsonists, also ventured into a solo music career. Jise released his first solo album, Lt. Worf Chronicles, in 2008, with the label Creative Juices Music. A year later, in 2009, he released Chronicles 2. 6 years later, in 2015, he released his final studio album, The Passion of Jise. Audio and art for each album are present on Jise's YouTube channel.\n\n\n== Other appearences ==\nA portrait of Jise was posted to Humans of New York in June 2017. \n\n\n== Discography ==\nWith the Arsonists:\nAlbums\n\nAs The World Burns (Matador, 1999)\nDate of Birth (Matador, 2001)\nLost In the Fire (Below System, 2018)\nSingles\n\n\"The Session\" (1996)\n\"Blaze/Geembo's Theme/Flashback\" (Fondle 'Em, 1998)\n\"Backdraft\" (Matador, 1999)\n\"Pyromaniax\" (Matador, 1999)\n\"Backdraft/Halloween II\" (Matador, 1999)\n\"As the World Burns\" (Matador, 1999) [instrumental limited edition]\nSolo Career:\nAlbums\n\nLt.

        "content": "Val des Écoliers or Grand Val was a house of Augustinian canons in Verbiesles in the diocese of Langres. Initially a priory, it was raised to an abbey in 1539 by Pope Paul III.\nIt was founded in 1201 by William the Englishman, a doctor at the University of Paris, and three colleagues. In 1212, Bishop Guillaume de Joinville granted them property in the valley of the Marne. In 1215, he approved the foundation of a monastery. They followed the Rule of Saint Augustine and their statutes were inspired by those of the Abbey of Saint-Victor, Paris. Although the monastery was dedicated to Our Lady, it attracted so many scholars from Paris that it became known as Vallis scholarium, the valley of scholars or val des écoliers. In 1219, with the approval of Pope Honorius III, it became the mother house of a new Augustinian order, the Écoliers du Christ.\nIn 1234, under Prior Manasses, the monastery was moved 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) down the valley to land donated by Bishop Robert de Thorotte. The original site became known as Vieux-Val and the new as Grand-Val. The old site was not forgotten and pilgrimage processions were regularly led to it.\n\nIn 1469, Pope Paul II granted it exemption from the authority of the bishop of Langres. In the 16th century, it was frequently placed in commendam. In 1636, Abbot Laurent Michel united the order to the Congregation of Sainte-Geneviève. A new abbey was constructed in the 17th century, but the buildings were mostly destroyed during the French Revolution. What remains of them was incorporated into a private residence. Known as the Château du Val des Écoliers, it was given by Charles Bourlon de Rouvre to John Joseph Pershing for use as his headquarters during World War I.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==",
