        "content": "FV Dudenhofen (officially: Fussballverein 1920 eV) is a football sports club from Dudenhofen in the Rhineland-Palatinate Rhein-Pfalz-Kreis. The first team has been playing in the Oberliga Rheinland-Pfalz/Saar since 2019.\n\n\n== History and Records ==\nThe club was founded in 1920. After the interim dissolution after the end of the Second World War, the club was re-established on February 16, 1946, which then merged with TV Dudenhofen. In 1949, the team was dissolved again. In addition to football, the club also offers table tennis.\nThe greatest success before the end of the war was the Mittelpfalzgau Championship in 1931, Amateurliga Vorderpfalz. Four years later, the Dudenhofen champions managed to get promoted to the Amateurliga Südwest. After the 1970–71 season, the team had to be relegated two years later. In 1980, it went back to the district league. This was followed by a direct resurgence before the Dudenhofener succeeded in 1987 in what is now called the Verbandsliga Südwest, the highest amateur league. This time the team lasted two years before the Dudenhofen team had to be relegated to the newly created Landesliga Ost in 1989.\nTwo consecutive relegations brought the club into the district league in 1993, before two consecutive promotions brought the Dudenhofen team back to the state league in 1997. After direct relegation, the club went up again in 2001 to the national league. Six years later, the club returned to the league and reached the final of the Südwestpokal in 2009, which they lost 3–0 to FK Pirmasens. Two years later, the Dudenhofen team became runners-up in the Verbandsliga Südwest behind Arminia Ludwigshafen.\nIn 2015, the club again reached the final of the Southwest Cup. In front of more than 1800 spectators, Dudenhoven beat TuS Mechtersheim in the local derby. On May 13, 2015, FV Dudenhofen met regional league club FK Pirmasens for the second time since 2009 in the final. In a game that was balanced until the end, FV Dudenhofen had to accept the 1–0 winning goal from FK Pirmasens in the 120th minute of the game and thus lost for the second time against the regional league team in an association cup final.\nIn the 2016–17 season, the club was able to win the championship in the Verbandsliga Südwest and the associated promotion to the Oberliga Rheinland-Pfalz/Saar to celebrate.\n\n\n== Personalities ==\nAlfred Volk\nNiels Schlotterbeck\nOlaf Schmäler\nWerner Adler\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website of the association",

        "content": "A series of powerful solar storms with intense to extreme solar flare and geomagnetic storm components have been ongoing since 10 May 2024 during solar cycle 25. The geomagnetic storm was the most powerful to affect Earth since October 2003, and produced aurorae at far lower latitudes than usual in both the northern and southern hemispheres.\n\n\n== Solar flares and coronal mass ejections ==\n \n\nOn 8 May 2024, a solar active region which had been assigned the NOAA region number 13664 (usually abbreviated as 3664) produced an X1.0-class and multiple M-class solar flares and launched several coronal mass ejections (CMEs) toward Earth. On 9 May, the active region produced an X2.25- and X1.12-class flare each associated with a full-halo CME. On 10 May, the region produced an X3.98-class flare, and on 11 May at 01:23 UTC it produced another X-class flare of magnitude 5.4–5.7 with another asymmetrical full-halo CME. The region also caused an S1 solar radiation storm with spikes reaching S2.\n\n\n== Geomagnetic storm ==\n\nThree CMEs from 8 May reached Earth on 10 May 2024, causing severe to extreme geomagnetic storms with bright and very long-lasting aurorae. In Asia, aurorae could be seen from Japan, the remote village of Hanle in northern India, and near the cities of Urumqi and Beijing in China. In Europe aurorae were seen from as far south as Spain, Portugal, and Cyprus, with them also being visible in the Canary Islands. In North America, aurorae were seen as far south as Florida, Mexico, and the Bahamas. The aurora was also seen in Hawaii. In the Southern Hemisphere, the aurora was seen in New Zealand, Chile, Argentina, South Africa, and as far north as Uruguay, Namibia, and Mackay in Queensland, Australia.\nBecause the interplanetary magnetic field reached a magnitude of 73 nT (nanotesla) with the component along Earth's magnetic axis oriented strongly south, reaching as much as −50 nT, as well as because of moderately high solar wind density, and solar wind speed reaching 750–800 km/s (470–500 mi/s) between 11–12 May (UTC time), the event was classified as a G5-class geomagnetic storm (Kp=9), making it the most intense storm since the 2003 Halloween solar storms. Several other CMEs were expected to reach Earth on 11 and 12 May.\n\n\n== Comparison to other solar storms ==\nThe disturbance storm time index (Dst index) is a measure in the context of space weather. A negative Dst index means that Earth's magnetic field is weakened. This is particularly the case during solar storms, with a higher negative Dst index indicating a stronger solar storm.\nThe 2003 Halloween solar storms had a peak Dst index of −422 nT, while the March 1989 geomagnetic storm had a peak Dst index of −589 nT. The May 1921 geomagnetic storm has been estimated to have had a Dst index of −907±132 nT. Estimates for the Dst index of the Carrington Event superstorm of 1859 are between −800 nT and −1750 nT.\nThe May 2024 solar storms reached a maximum Dst index of −412 nT on 11 May.\n\n\n== Impact ==\nThe storm has been negatively affecting ground-based broadcasting and two-way radio communications on the HF, VHF and UHF bands because it prevents the ionosphere from forming and thus interferes with propagation.\nIn Canada, power companies BC Hydro and Hydro-Québec stated that they had prepared for the storm, and monitored it as it impacted Earth on the 10th–11th. Unlike in 1989 where a previous solar storm caused a nine-hour long power outage in Québec, no outages were reported because of the storm's effects.\nIn New Zealand, Transpower declared a grid emergency, and took some transmission lines out of service as a precaution against the storm.\nIn the United States, telecommunications companies AT&T and T-Mobile stated that they were prepared to respond to disruptions in their networks, but it was predicted that significant impacts to cell service were unlikely because the networks rely on different frequencies than the HF bands affected by the solar storm. While the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reported that there were power grid irregularities and degradation in GPS and high-frequency radio communications, both the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the United States Department of Energy reported no significant impacts to the population.\nAgricultural users of John Deere RTK GPS equipment reported significantly degraded positional accuracy during the geomagnetic storm. As the GPS receivers are used to guide tractors in precision agriculture, certain agricultural workers were forced to suspend planting activities entirely.\nSome aerial drone users flying during the storm experienced unusual behavior, including difficulty maintaining a stable hover, disruption of GPS signals, and in some cases a sudden loss of control which resulted in a crash. Drones rely on GPS and magnetic signals to maintain position during flight, which are affected by geomagnetic activity.\nAt 00:19 UTC on May 13, the GOES-16 satellite, the primary operational geostationary weather satellite in the GOES East position, providing a view centered on the Americas, stopped transmitting all data. The transmission of data resumed nearly 2 hours later at 02:00 UTC. There was a second loss of data transmission shortly after, lasting 11 minutes from 03:19 UTC to 03:30 UTC.\nOther impacts to satellite services include Starlink's fleet of low-orbiting satellites, which experienced degraded service because of the intensity of the solar storms, but remained operational.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n        Media related to May 2024 solar storms at Wikimedia Commons\n\nNote: Caption figures indicate geographic latitude, not magnetic latitude.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of solar storms\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Isata Bussoh Kabia is a Sierra Leonean politician for the All People's Congress party. She has served in the national parliament, the Pan African Parliament and as a government minister.\n\n\n== Life ==\nKabia was born in Sierra Leone. She had an unusual early life as her parents left her and her younger brother with her grandmother in Lunsar when she was three, so that they could establish a life in Britain. They did not return until she was eight by which time she was very attached to her grandmother. They took her and her brother back to the UK and she spent some time having to readjust to her re-united family. \nShe was homesich for Sierra Leone and her grandmother and her parents paid for to have a vacation in Lunsar. She realised that she was living a very different life in England to her former peers and she and her English schoolmates became involved in fundraising even before the Sierra Leone Civil War began in 1991. Kabia would take holiday jobs to pay for her later visits to Sierra Leone. She graduated in biochemistry in England before she went to America.

        "content": "Francisco Campos Santín (8 August 1912 – Unknown) was a Spanish footballer who played as a goalkeeper for Real Madrid and Sevilla FC. He later became a referee, overseeing several matches in the first and second divisions between 1949 and 1957.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\nBorn on 8 August 1912 in Madrid, Campos began his football career in 1931, at the age of 19, in his hometown club Imperio CF, which was a team made up of students and civil guards, but it also served as a subsidiary and youth team of Real Madrid. In his first season at the club, he stood out among his teammates, which included Avelino Álvarez, and helped Imperio become champions of Spain in its category, so he was signed in 1932 by Real Madrid, where he had few chances, mostly due to the presence of the great Ricardo Zamora. He appears as a reserve for the squad between 1932 and 1936, and only played 2 official matches in the first team as a goalkeeper, one of which in the 1934–35 La Liga, an away fixture against Valencia CF on 27 January, conceding only once in a 4–1 win. Despite having little to no playing time, Campos remained loyal to Madrid for four years until the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936.\nAfter the Civil War ended in 1939, Campos returned to Imperio CF, where he played one season under coach José Quirante, featuring alongside Ramón Colón and Cuestita, but they were not able to avoid relegation to the Tercera División. Campos then played one season in both Sporting de Gijón and Sevilla FC before retiring in the latter in 1942, at the age of 30.\n\n\n== Refereeing career ==\nIn 1949, seven years after hanging up his boots, Campos became an official football referee, and between 1949 and 1957, he oversaw several matches in the first and second divisions, occasionally in the Spanish Cup, and even one promotion match to 1st division in 1953. Notably, he refereed two matches between Valencia and Real Sociedad, one in 1952 and the other in 1954, and Valencia netted four goals in both of them. In the only match with Deportivo de La Coruña that he refereed, the club suffered resounding defeat of 2–8 to Athletic Bilbao.\nThe date of his death is unknown.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Real Madrid CF players\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Francisco Mas Piquet (13 January 1916 – 23 February 1998) was a Spanish footballer who played as a Forward for RCD Espanyol and Granada CF. The highlight of his career was scoring the winning goal of the 1940 Spanish Cup final against Real Madrid in extra-time.\nHe later became a manager, being in charge of Granada CF between 1950 and 1952.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\nBorn on 13 January 1916 in Barcelona, Mas began playing football at Penya Saprissa, the team in charge of training future RCD Espanyol players. He then played for a club in Sarrià and for CE Europa before joining RCD Espanyol in 1939, after the end of the Spanish Civil War.\nIn his first season at the club, he played a crucial role in helping his side win the 1939–40 Campionat de Catalunya, the last-ever edition of the Catalan championships, and then the 1940 Copa del Generalísimo, starting in the final against Real Madrid on 30 June, which ended in a 2–2 draw after 90 minutes, but then Mas netted the winner in the 110th minute to seal a famous victory for Espanyol. He played three seasons at Espanyol, until 1942, and in total, he scored 11 goals in 49 league games.\nIn 1942, Mas signed for Granada CF, where he played for ten seasons, three in the first division and the next seven in the Segunda División, playing a total of over 250 games for the club. In his last two seasons at the club, he worked as a Player-coach. He was a fast and technical left winger who scored many goals. He was a left winger, and since he was very complete, the coaches used him as a wild card in attacking positions, with the exception of center forward.\n\n\n=== International career ===\nMas played 4 matches with the Catalan national team in 1941 and 1942, in which he scored two goals. He scored the first of his goals against a Stuttgart Selection side at Les Corts on 11 January 1941, which ended in a 3–3 draw.\n\n\n== Death ==\nMas died on 23 February 1998, at the age of 82.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nRCD Espanyol\n\nCopa del Rey:\nChampions (1): 1940\nCampionat de Catalunya:\nChampions (1): 1939–40\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "SV Merseburg 99 is a sports club from Merseburg in Saxony-Anhalt. The club has existed since August 23, 1899. The club colors are green and white. The club's home base is the Merseburg City Stadium.\n\n\n== Club history ==\nSV Merseburg was founded on August 23, 1899, by a total of 14 founding members, making it the oldest ball game club in Merseburg. As early as 1900, the club changed its name to Spielverein Hohenzollern. From 1901 onwards they played under the name Ballspielverein Hohenzollern. In 1921 there was the last renaming as SV Merseburg 1899. After the Second World War, the club was dissolved and replaced by the Merseburg Nord sports community. This was taken over in 1948 by the Buna-Werke company sports association (BSG) Chemie Buna Schkopau. Shortly before reunification, the BSG became SV Buna Schkopau on August 1, 1990, whose successor club was founded on February 7, 1991, under the name SV Merseburg 99. On July 1, 2019, the club merged with VfB IMO Merseburg. SV 99 was supposed to dissolve and the members joined VfB IMO, which renamed itself 1. FC Merseburg.  After the application for dissolution was made and most of the members of SV 99 joined the new club, some old members of SV 99 decided in 2020 to continue the club, whose dissolution had not yet been completed.\n\n\n== Athletic career ==\nIn 1923, the Merseburgers were promoted to the Saalegau League after several unsuccessful attempts, and from 1933 the club played in the Gauliga Mitte. In 1935 the club was relegated from the Gauliga, but managed to gain immediate promotion a year later. The best placement dates back to 1938, where the Merseburgers achieved third place. In 1940, SV Merseburg was finally relegated from the Gauliga.\nAfter the Second World War, BSG Chemie Buna celebrated its first success in 1951. The Merseburgers surprisingly won the  Chemnitz Cup against BSG Chemie Leipzig. In 1952, the BSG was one of the founding communities of the newly created third-class Halle district league. After winning the district championship in 1964, Schkopau failed in the elimination round for the GDR League , but was able to achieve promotion a year later. From 1974 to 1981 the chemists played continuously in the second league. In the 1970s, the Schkopauers reached the round of 16 once (0–1 against FC Karl-Marx-Stadt ) and the quarter-finals twice (3–4, 0–4 against FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt ) in the GDR Football Cup. In 1981, Schkopau celebrated the greatest success in football history with promotion to the GDR Oberliga. However, this league turned out to be too big. While the Schkopauers were able to win 3–1 against Energie Cottbus on the second matchday, there was a 1:10 debacle against Dynamo Dresden a week later. In their only league season, the Merseburgers managed a total of eleven points. The following regular team played in the league under coach Olaf Keller :\n\nFrom 1982 to 1990, BSG Chemie Buna Schkopau played consistently in the second division again after being relegated from the Oberliga. In the summer of unity, the team was withdrawn from the second division for financial reasons. The club, which was renamed SV Merseburg 99 during the course of the season, competed in the premiere season of 1990/1991 in the Saxony-Anhalt State League, which was then third-class in the East German league system, and qualified as its first champions for the NOFV Amateur Oberliga, which was third-class in the whole of Germany from the 1991/92 season Football. After relegation in the summer of 1992, the following year they were promoted again to the amateur league for the 1993/94 season. Due to the introduction of the Regionalliga as a new 3rd division, the penultimate place was enough for the Merseburgers to remain in the now fourth-tier NOFV Oberliga for 1994/95. After relegation in 1995/96, Merseburg continued to prove to be an elevator team. After several relegations and promotions, the club established itself in the seventh-tier national league in 2012. In the 2014/15 season, the Merseburgers came second in the South Regional League. Since several teams had withdrawn from the Saxony-Anhalt association league, second place was enough for promotion to the now sixth-class association league.

        "content": "Nick Fryer (born 1979 or 1980), better known as Nick Sentience, is a British electronic dance music disc jockey and hard dance music producer from Portsmouth, England. He is known for his fusion of music genres including techno, hard house, and trance. Several of his releases have charted in the United Kingdom.\n\n\n== Career ==\nSentience grew up in Portsmouth, England, and began DJing at the age of 15.  At age 18 he was signed to the London-based Nukleuz hard dance record label. The appellation \"Sentience\" was added due to the name of the outfit he was performing with in the early stages of his career. Sentience went on to tour worldwide, and in 2001, at the age of 21, was voted in at number 74 in the DJ Mag top 100 DJ rankings.\nIn 2001 he collaborated with DJ Phil Reynolds to produce the track \"Instru(mental)\", which was voted hard dance tune of the year and named as the Ministry of Sound single of the month. In May that same year a DJ mix by Sentience, Nukleuz Bomb, was featured as the cover CD of Muzik magazine. In 2002 he collaborated with Steve Blake to compile and mix the Reactivate Energize album on the React label, which peaked at #84 in the UK official compilations chart.\nIn 2007 Sentience played the Tidy stage at Creamfields. He has released a number of long players, including Universal Language and Dance Planet, followed by in 2011 the album Syncronized. Beat Magazine reported all three as \"critically acclaimed\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nNick Sentience discography at Discogs \nNick Sentience at AllMusic",

        "content": "Thiais–Orly station is an upcoming underground station on Line 14 of the Paris Métro. It is part of the Grand Paris Express project. The station is located in the town of Thiais, on the outskirts of Orly Airport.\n\n\n== Location and design ==\nLocated south of the RER C tracks and north of Avenue du Docteur-Marie, the station will be built along a north–south axis. Scheduled to open in 2024, it will connect with the existing Pont de Rungis station.\nThe station will occupy a former car park used by Air France. Passengers will access the station through a building constructed above the underground station. This building will house the entrance hall, ticketing office, fare gates, bicycle parking, and local services. The north access to the station will connect to the RER C platforms. The east access building will have connections to local buses.\nLine 14 platforms will be approximately 26 meters deep. The entire station will be fully accessible for people with reduced mobility.\nThe design consortium includes engineering firms SETEC and SYSTRA, alongside architecture firm Valode & Pistre. Artist Lyes Hammadouche created an artwork for the station in collaboration with architect Denis Valode.\nOriginally named Pont de Rungis, the station's name sparked controversy. Several mayors in Val-de-Marne disagreed with the chosen names for three stations, including this one, arguing they didn't reflect their actual locations. In September 2022, the station was officially renamed Thiais - Orly, with Pont de Rungis remaining as a subtitle.\n\n\n== References ==",

Manchester United marked their second consecutive appearance in the final, having lost to Chelsea the previous year, while Tottenham Hotspur featured for the first time in their history. It was the first Women's FA Cup final since 2005 not to be contested by Chelsea, Arsenal or Manchester City and the first since 2012 that was won by a team other than those three.\n\n\n== Match ==\n\n\n=== Details ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Damian Hubbard (or Damian Leigh in the original film) is a fictional character from the Mean Girls franchise. He was portrayed by actors Daniel Franzese, Grey Henson, and Jaquel Spivey in the original film (2004), 2017 musical and its subsequent film adaptation in 2024, respectively. \n\n\n== Description ==\nThe character Damian has appeared in the film Mean Girls (2004) and subsequent adaptations. He is the gay best friend of Janis Ian who is described within the franchise as \"too gay to function\". He has also been called sarcastic. Dessi Gomez of TheWrap has said Damian \"stands by Janis' side through thick and thin, as she does with him. He manages to be in on all the girl drama just as much as guy drama around North Shore High. His talents, as showcased in the winter talent show, will take him far.\"\n\n\n== Roles and portrayals ==\nSocial outcasts Damian and Janis teach new student Cady Heron about various cliques at the school and caution her about the \"Plastics\"—Regina George, Gretchen Wieners, and Karen Smith.\n\n\n=== 2004 film ===\nIn the original film (2004), Damian is played by American actor Daniel Franzese. He sings \"Beautiful\" (2002) by Christina Aguilera during the talent show. After someone in the audience throws a shoe at him, Damian throws it back. He wears a blue hoodie and black sunglasses as an \"incognito\" look. In Business Insider's 2022 list of the \"most iconic\" outfits from the film, Arielle Tschinkel said the look is \"not the most fashionable\" but \"still iconic\". Billie Walker of Digital Spy said Damian's \"catty one liners can still be recited by millennials everywhere\", but \"still failed in its queer representation\".\nAccording to Franzese, he was asked to reprise the role for the music video to Ariana Grande's \"Thank U, Next\" (2018), but he was unable to participate because of a schedule conflict. \n\n\n=== Musical ===\n\nUnlike the original film, Damian brings a male partner to the dance in the musical and 2024 film adaptation.\nOn stage, Damian has been played by Grey Henson, Eric Huffman, and Ethan Jih-Cook.\n\n\n==== 2024 film adaptation ====\nIn a review of the 2024 film, in which Damian is portrayed by Jaquel Spivey, André Hereford of Metro Weekly said Damian and Janis \"are the ringmasters, narrating the entire story\" of the production. In 2024, Caitlin Tyrrell of Screen Rant said Auliʻi Cravalho's portrayal of Janis \"brings a new layer to the friendship between Janis and Damian as two LGBTQ+ kids who may have bonded in part because of their sexuality\".\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nGay characters in fiction\nList of fictional gay characters\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Evolutionary tinkering is an explanation of how evolution happens in nature. It explains that evolution works as a tinkerer who experiments with miscellaneous items, unsure of the outcome, and utilizes whatever is available to craft functional objects whose utility may only become evident later. None of the materials serve a defined purpose initially, and each can be employed in multiple ways. According to the tinkering concept, “evolution does not produce novelties from scratch\". It comes from previously unseen associations of old materials to modify an existing system to give a new function or combine systems together to enhance the functions. The transformation from unicellular to multicellular during evolution is such an event which has elaborated the existing function.\nThe process of evolutionary tinkering takes quite a long time. As a meticulous tinkerer who continuously refines its creations, making adjustments, trimming and extending here and there, seizing every chance to gradually tailor them to their evolving purposes, this process happens over countless eons.\nMost of the time, traits in nature are barely favorable enough for organisms to survive. For instance, RuBisCO is profoundly inefficient, despite the fact that it catalyzes one of the most important reactions on the planet: carbon fixation. This is likely due to the enzyme originating in the common ancestor of all plastids when the atmospheric conditions were drastically different than they are today.\n\n\n== François Jacob ==\nIn his seminal article 'Evolution and Tinkering', François Jacob first introduced the idea of tinkering to a broad audience of scientists, drawing from diverse fields such as molecular biology, evolutionary biology, and cultural anthropology. The concept of tinkering, or more precisely, the notion of bricolage, serves as a theoretical framework for analyzing various phenomena characterized by a common underlying process: the opportunistic rearrangement and recombination of existing elements. Jacob and Monad also won the Nobel Prize in 1965 for his work on the lac operon.\n\n\n== Engineering vs. Tinkering ==\nNatural selection is frequently likened to the work of an engineer, yet this analogy falls short. Unlike the engineer who operates based on meticulous planning and a clear vision of the end product, evolution lacks such deliberate intent. Additionally, while the engineer has access to carefully selected materials and specialized equipment tailored for their tasks, evolution relies on the resources available in its surroundings.\nMoreover, the engineer's creations tend to approach a level of perfection achievable with current technology, whereas evolution does not strive for perfection but rather resembles a tinkerer. This tinkerer, akin to evolution, lacks a precise blueprint of the outcome and instead utilizes whatever materials are at hand to fashion something functional. While the engineer depends on specific materials and tools precisely suited to their project, the tinkerer makes do with miscellaneous scraps and remnants. The resulting creations of the tinkerer emerge from a series of opportunistic events, enriching their repertoire with each encounter.\nThe development of lungs in terrestrial vertebrates illustrates a process akin to tinkering rather than deliberate engineering. It originated in certain freshwater fish faced with oxygen deficient environments, leading them to ingest air and absorb oxygen through their esophageal walls. Over time, this behavior favored the enlargement of the esophageal surface area, eventually giving rise to lung-like structures through the emergence and enlargement of esophageal diverticula.\nThe brain is the key adaptive feature of humans, yet still holds mysteries regarding its precise purpose. The brain has also evolved through natural selection over millions of years, like other body parts, primarily to serve our reproductive needs. However, the human brain's development was more complex unlike straightforward evolutionary changes such as a leg into a wing. It involved adding new structures, particularly the neocortex, onto older ones. This rapid evolution led to a division between the neocortex, responsible for intellectual functions, and the older structures, controlling emotional and visceral activities. These older structures lack the discriminative and symbolic abilities of the neocortex and are primarily associated with emotions. Despite the dominance of the neocortex in intellectual processes, the older structures maintain strong connections with automatic centers, ensuring vital functions like obtaining food and responding to threats. This evolutionary process, characterized by the emergence of a dominant neocortex alongside the persistence of older systems, resembles a tinkering process, where new elements are added onto existing ones without fully replacing them.\n\n\n== Evolution by Molecular Tinkering ==\nJacob was convinced that although morphological analysis supports his notion of bricolage, one would find more evidence of tinkering at the molecular level. The tinkering model suggests that the genes of the earliest organisms were very short, and all subsequent genes were formed by duplication, combination, and reassorting these original sequences. It is well established that gene duplication has produced a great deal of diversity throughout evolutionary history. One example of molecular tinkering can be found in mitochondrial nucleoproteins, some of which originate from eukaryotes; in this case, the tinkerer used whatever tools were at her disposal, including materials from an entirely different taxonomic domain.\nTo understand molecular tinkering, it is important to grasp the concept of a protein domain, which is a distinct region of a protein that has a defined shape, which determines the function of the protein. Some have used the analogy of Lego blocks to explain: the domains can be taken apart and put together again in unique ways, thus changing the shape and function of the protein. There are many different means by which tinkering can result in molecular and phenotypic novelty, primarily by taking apart the Lego blocks of proteins and putting them together again in unique patterns. Generally, these processes add to the organizational complexity of the genome, the proteome, or both.\n\n\n=== Internal gene duplication ===\nThere are several forms of gene duplication. The product of whole-gene duplication is two copies of the gene, whereas that of diploid-type gene duplication is one gene that has doubled in length. Internal gene duplication results in repeated nucleotide sequences within a gene, and less than 100% of the gene is replicated. Because adding nucleotides to a sequence could impact splicing, this process may result in changing the identity of introns and exons; alternatively, the sequence may retain its original identity as an exon or intron, respectively. If an exon that encodes for one or more domains is duplicated, this could directly result in a more complex protein via domain accretion. Eukaryotic genes have undergone frequent internal gene duplication throughout evolutionary history. One example is seen in the dinucleotide-binding regions of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase: the duplicated domain is capable of binding with more molecules than the unduplicated. Another is the ovomucoid gene, which is the product of two internal duplications.\n\n\n=== Mosaic proteins ===\nMosaic proteins are encoded by chimeric genes (or mosaic genes). These genes result from domain shuffling, which is accomplished via exon shuffling, gene fusion, or gene fission. Domain shuffling has been found to be at least partially responsible for some traits in modern vertebrates. Most domains only have a small number of uses, while very few domains are used as Lego blocks over and over again in multidomain proteins. Phenotypic innovation does not arise solely from the creation of new proteins, but also from changing gene expression and protein-protein interactions. One example of novelty associated with domain shuffling is multicellularity.\nGene fusion (the creation of a fusion gene by joining two genes together) and gene fission or fragmentation, which results in splitting one gene with many domains into multiple smaller genes, are the other two molecular mechanisms by which mosaic proteins can be formed.\n\n\n=== Alternative splicing ===\nAlternative splicing is another mechanism of molecular tinkering that may be responsible for increasing diversity in the proteome. One special kind of alternative splicing is nested genes, which produce intron-encoded proteins. It has been proposed that nested gene structures could be maintained via neutral processes according to the neutral theory of evolution.\n\n\n=== De novo evolution of protein-coding genes from non-coding DNA ===\nDe novo gene birth is very rare. The most probable path from noncoding DNA to a protein-coding gene is to first become a protogene, similar to how functional genes first become pseudogenes before becoming completely nongenic. Although they are too rare to notably increase the number of proteins in a given lineage, the tinkering model posits that adding just a few Lego blocks to the collection allows for many new possible combinations of domains, i.e., proteins with new shapes and functions.\n\n\n=== Exonization of introns and pseudoexonization of exons ===\nExonization is a very rare phenomenon in which an intron becomes an exon. In pseudoexonization, an exon becomes nonfunctional; this in turn changes the shape and function of the protein.\n\n\n=== Gene loss and unitary pseudogenes ===\nWhen selective constraints disappear, it is possible for genes to be lost via one of two mechanisms. The first is deleting a single-copy gene. The second is nonfunctionalization of a single-copy gene; this produces a unitary pseudogene, which has no functional paralogs, is comparable to vestigial anatomical structures, and is uncommon due to its often deleterious nature. In the rare case that gene loss becomes fixed in a population, it is difficult to definitively say what was the cause.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "St Botolph's Church is the parish church of Bossall, a village in North Yorkshire, in England.\nThe current church, dedicated to St Botolph, dates from around 1180, though as many as three earlier churches may have occupied the site. One of these is thought to have been built by the Bosa of York. The church is cruciform and approximately 94 feet (29 m) in length. The transepts, nave and part of the tower are original, but the chancel was rebuilt in the 13th century and alterations were later made to the upper part of the tower.  The Borthwick Institute holds copies of the parish records which date to the early 17th century.\n\nThe Church of England records include this background information about the parish: A vicarage was ordained at Bossall in 1229. The rectory and advowson of the church initially descended with the manor of Bossall but by 1378 it had passed to the Nevill family. At some point between 1378 and 1386 it was alienated to Durham Priory by John Nevill for the maintenance of Durham College, Oxford. The advowson was fully appropriated to the college c.1404, and the college retained it until the Dissolution of the Monasteries when it was granted by the King to the Dean and Chapter of Durham.\nA report published in 1839 states that the church was suffering from neglect at that time, although the interior walls had been recently cleaned. The vicarage, a white Elizabethan house built in 1838 and the home of Rev. Bolton Simpson at that time, was located nearby.  It was restored in 1859, during which process the west gable was rebuilt, and a south porch was added.  The church was grade I listed in 1953.\n\nThe church is built of limestone and sandstone and has a Welsh slate roof.  It has a cruciform plan, consisting of a nave with a south porch, north and south transepts, a chancel, and a tower at the crossing.  The tower, nave and transepts have a string course and a corbel table.  The south porch has a moulded round-headed arch with four orders of shafts with dogtooth and stylised flower decoration, and waterleaf capitals.  The doorway in the north porch is similar, but with only one order.  Many of the windows are lancets, while others are Perpendicular, and there are a couple of round-headed windows.\nInside the church is a 14th-century font with a 17th-century cover, and a painting of the Royal Arms from 1710.  Monuments include a brass figure commemorating Robert Constable, a former chancellor of Dunelm, who died in the 1540s, and several memorials to members of the Belt family.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGrade I listed buildings in North Yorkshire\nListed buildings in Buttercrambe with Bossall\n\n\n== References ==",

The top three teams of 2023–24 EFL League Two, Stockport County, Wrexham and Mansfield Town gained automatic promotion to League One, while the clubs placed from fourth to seventh in the table took part in the 2024 English Football League play-offs.\n\n\n== Route to the final ==\n\nCrewe Alexandra finished the regular 2023–24 season in sixth place in EFL League Two, the fourth tier of the English football league system. They finished 15 points behind Mansfield Town (who were promoted in third place), 17 behind second-placed Wrexham and 21 points behind league winners Stockport County.\nCrewe ended the season with only one win in their last nine league games. They played fifth placed Doncaster Rovers in a two-leg semi-final. The first leg was played at Crewe's Mornflake Stadium on 6 May. Doncaster Rovers won the game 2–0 with goals from Luke Molyneux and Harrison Biggins. On 10 May in the return leg at Doncaster's Eco-Power Stadium, Crewe overturned the two-goal first-leg deficit with goals from Mickey Demetriou and an own–goal from James Maxwell. The match was decided with a penalty shoot–out which Crewe won 4–3 with goalkeeper Max Stryjek, at the club on an emergency loan from Wycombe Wanderers, saving penalties from Zain Westbrooke and Hakeeb Adelakun. With the win, Crewe became the fourth team in play-off history to come back from a two-goal deficit in the first-leg, on their home ground, and still make the final.\nCrawley Town finished in seventh place, a point behind Crewe Alexandra. They played Milton Keynes Dons who finished in fourth place, eight points behind third placed Mansfield Town. Playing in their first play–offs, in the first–leg, played on 7 May at Crawley's Broadfield Stadium, Crawley won 3–0 with goals from Liam Kelly, Jay Williams and Ronan Darcy. The second leg was played on 11 May at Stadium MK. After only three minutes Jay Williams scored for Crawley, Danilo Orsi adding a second in the 30th minute. Max Dean scored for Milton Keynes Dons late in the first–half. The one–sided game continued in the second–half with Orsi scoring in the 48th minute. Dean's penalty was saved by Crawley goalkeeper, Corey Addai before Jack Roles scored in the 80th minute and Orsi completed his hat–trick in the second minute of added time to make the final score 5–1 and 8–1 on aggregate, the largest aggregate victory in EFL play–off history, as Crawley advanced to the play–off final and their first ever game at Wembley.\n\n\n== Match ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nCrawley Town were allocated 19,556 tickets for the West End of Wembley Stadium and a maximum of 38,676 tickets, if required.\nCrewe Alexandra were  allocated 38,693 tickets for the East End of Wembley Stadium from the North Stand round to the South Stand.\n\n\n=== Details ===\n\n\n== Post-match ==\n\n\n== References ==",

After five years in the Society, constant ill-health forced him to leave. Eventually he decided to enter the army. One day while passing the Palazzo Reale di Napoli, he happened to hear the nuns chanting at the Monastery of Regina Caeli and stopped to listen. Carafa decided to make a change and at the age of thirty-four, took up the study of philosophy and theology. Five years later he was ordained. After this his life became a constant exercise of charity and zeal. Cardinal Giesualdo, seeing his good work, assigned him to the church of Santa Maria di Tutti i Beni. Several ecclesiastics who were under his spiritual guidance left their homes to live with him and aid him in his apostolic labors, which the archbishop allowed.\nIn 1601 Carafa opened his church, and, with eight priests, he began to work. He faced many trials: he was misrepresented at Rome; he had to leave the church which had been given to him, and most of his disciples abandoned him. But he kept up his courage, rented a house and continued his work with three companions, who had remained faithful. Some time after, his perseverance was rewarded by new accessions to his community. This enabled him to establish several houses of his congregation. He obtained for it the approbation of Pope Gregory XV by a Brief of 1621. It received the title of Congregation of the Pious Workers. After a life of great merit, spent in works of charity, he died on 8 September 1633. He was declared a Servant of God on 18 September 1740, and The Venerable on 16 December 1832.\n\n\n== Congregation of Pious Workers ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nKatharina Valenta, a courtesan converted by Carlo Carafa\n\n\n== References ==",

The capture was quick and successful, with the Dano-Norwegian governor, Peter Anker, surrendering within the arrival of the British.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nDuring the French Revolutionary Wars in 1800 and early-1801 rising tensions between Denmark–Norway and the United Kingdom arose. The Danish colony of Tranquebar subsequently therefore received the intelligence of the rising tensions between the two nations, and Danish merchants therefore sold their ships in order for them not to end up in British hands. Governor of Tranquebar, Peter Anker, realized that a defense on a hypothetical British attack would by hopeless, and he therefore had already begun preparing for a capitulation.\n\n\n== Capture ==\nIn May 1801 the English Governor-General of India, Richard Wellesley, got orders from Britain to occupy the Danish colonies, and on the 12 May two English shis anchored with 200 men on the coast of Tranquebar. Concurrently a force from Madras marched to Tranquebar to besiege the city. According to Peter Anker, the British forces were too strong to stand a change against, especially considering the poor conditions the fortifications had. When the British encouraged Anker to surrender, he therefore quickly consented and sent his Instrument of Surrender to the British command.\nOn the same day the British occupied Fort Dansborg and hoisted the Union Jack there. The three Danish ships in the habour were followingly seized.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nDespite the Danish instrument of surrender were favourable for the Danes, the British still accepted.  According to the capitulation Danish laws were acknowledged, and all public cases would be settled by the Danes, migrants would preserve their protection and the Danish officers should have the same wages as British. Only a British inspector would be installed to keep track of the economy.\nSome months after the surrender Anker received orders from Denmark to make the colony ready for an English attack, and to protect it to the utmost, yet Anker had already issued a surrender. On the 17 August 1802 Tranquebar was given back to Denmark.\n\n\n== See also ==\nEnglish Wars (Scandinavia) – 1807–1814 war in Northern and Western Europe\nBattle of Copenhagen (1801) – Part of the War of the Second Coalition and the English Wars\nPeter Anker – Norwegian general, diplomat and painter (1744-1832)Pages displaying wikidata descriptions as a fallback\nGunboat War – 1807–1814 war between Denmark–Norway and the United Kingdom\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nLisberg, Bering (2020).

In May 1862, the Confederates abandoned their positions near Pensacola and the 8th Regiment was sent to Mobile, Alabama, where the men re–enlisted for 3 years. In the fall of 1862, the Regiment moved to Chattanooga, Tennessee to join General Bragg's forces during the Confederate Heartland Offensive. The 8th was assigned to General John K. Jackson's brigade and fought at the Battle of Stones River from December 31, 1862, to January 2, 1863. Colonel John C. Wilkinson, commander of the 8th Mississippi, was seriously wounded and captured in this battle, and the regiment suffered a 47% casualty rate.\nIn 1863, the 8th Regiment was stationed at Bridgeport, Alabama, and then moved to Chattanooga in August as Bragg's forces retreated from Middle Tennessee. Bragg's army was pursued by Union general William Rosecrans, who later forced the Confederates to retreat into Georgia. During the Battle of Chickamauga, Jackson's brigade, including the 8th Regiment, was assigned to General Benjamin F. Cheatham's division on the right wing of the Confederate line, and took part in a successful movement on September 19 that pushed back the advancing Union forces. Lieutenant Colonel Aden McNeill was killed during fighting at Chickamauga on September 20, and the Regiment suffered a 23% casualty rate. The Union forces retreated to Chattanooga, and Bragg's troops moved north against their position. During the Battle of Missionary Ridge, the Confederates were defeated and many men of the 8th Mississippi were captured.\nIn 1864, the 8th Regiment took part in the Atlanta Campaign, fighting at Resaca, Adairsville, New Hope Church, Kennesaw Mountain, Peachtree Creek, Atlanta, Lovejoy's Station, and Jonesborough. The Regiment took major casualties in several of these battles: Lieutenant Colonel John F. Smith was killed at Pine Mountain on June 19, and commanding officer Colonel John C. Wilkinson was killed east of Atlanta on July 22. After the Atlanta campaign the regiment was reduced to an effective strength of 208 officers and men.\nThe 8th Mississippi then took part in the Franklin–Nashville campaign under General Mark Perrin Lowrey's brigade, including the Battle of Franklin on November 30 where the Regiment took heavy casualties and division commander General Patrick Cleburne was killed. Major Andrew E. Moody was placed in combined command of the depleted 8th and 32nd Mississippi regiments. After the Battle of Nashville, this combined unit retreated into North Mississippi.\nOn April 9, 1865, the surviving remnants of General Lowry's brigade, comprising the 5th, 8th, and 32nd Mississippi infantry regiments, along with the 3rd Mississippi Battalion, were combined into a consolidated unit titled the 8th Mississippi Battalion. This unit surrendered on April 26, 1865, at Greensboro, North Carolina.\n\n\n== Commanders ==\nCommanding officers of the 8th Mississippi:\n\nCol. Guilford G. Flynt\nCol. John C.

        "content": "Washington Robey (c. 1799 – January 1, 1841), sometimes Washington Robie, was an American tavern keeper, livery stable operator, slave trader, and slave jail proprietor in early 19th-century Washington City, District of Columbia.\n\n\n== Life and work ==\n\nRobey was deemed a \"resident of this city\" by the Washington Gazette at the time of his wedding to Miss Sarah Talbot in 1823. He was in the slave trade by 1825, as in fall of that year he advertised in the Washington Intelligencer that he sought \"to purchase from fifteen to twenty likely young NEGROES of both sexes from fifteen to twenty-five years of age for which the highest price will be given in cash.\" In 1829 he was located on 9th Street and again offering \"CASH! CASH! CASH\" for \"Negroes of both sexes, between twelve and twenty-five.\" Robey's ads were known to catch the attention of overseas visitors to the capital. For example, a Bristol, England newspaper reported in October 1830, \"Liberty! — The John Bull of Sunday says — “ Who would not he a republican ?— who that could be free would have a King ? — Read the following specimen of liberty in that glorious republic America : one Mr Washington Robey advertises in the Washington Daily National Intelligencer thus — 'Cash ! Cash ! Cash ! The advertiser will give the highest prices for likely young negroes of both sexes from twelve to twenty-five rears of age’ In the same Paper there are two other advertisements offering ‘ Cash for likely young negroes’ — Vive la Liberte!\" Similarly, in 1832 a Welsh newspaper reprinted several slave-trade ads from the Washington Intelligencer, including one by Jilson Dove and one of Robey's, and commented that they would be read with \"astonishment and disgust.\"\nTogether with Williams brothers' Yellow House, and the slave jail of Franklin & Armfield in Alexandria, District of Columbia, the national capital of the United States was one of the busiest and most prominent slave-trading hubs in the country by the 1830s. These two, along with \"McCandless's tavern in Georgetown,\" were considered \"notorious.\" Robey's pen was located at one time on the east side of 7th Street near the intersection with Maryland Avenue. This tavern offered jail facilities to enslavers and other traders, including Joseph W. Neal. This location was apparently conveniently sited between the market house and the steamboat wharf.\nRobey's jail was visited in 1833 or 1834 by a British traveler named E. S. Abdy, who later described it in his book about the United States:  \n\nOne day I went to see the 'slaves' pen'— a wretched hovel, right against the Capitol, from which it is distant about half a mile, with no house intervening. The outside alone is accessible to the eye of a visitor; what passes within being reserved for the exclusive observation of its owner, (a man of the name of Robey,) and his unfortunate victims. It is surrounded by a wooden paling fourteen or fifteen feet in height, with the posts outside to prevent escape, and separated from the building by a space too narrow to admit of a free circulation of air. At a small window above, which was unglazed and exposed alike to the heat of summer and the cool of winter...two or three sable faces appeared, looking out wistfully, to while away the time and catch a refreshing breeze; the weather being extremely hot.\nRobey's tavern is listed in the 1834 Washington City directory. According to Frederic Bancroft in Slave-Trading in the Old South, \"The Washington Directory of 1834 indicates the ownership and location of the tavern as follows: 'Robey [,] Washington, Tavern, e side 7 w, btw B and Cb' [southwest]. As Md. ave. cuts off part of the block north of C st., the Directory to that extent is inexplicit.\"\nIn September 1833, a man named Robert Thomas petitioned the Circuit Court of the District of Columbia for a writ of habeas corpus as he claimed he was legally free and \"entitled to his freedom & is unlawfully held in confinement\" in the jail of Washington Robey. Similarly, in February 1834, Rebecca Hobbs, petitioning the same court, \"represents that she is illegally detained in confinement by a certain Thomas Magruder a negro trader and a certain Washington Robey, and that the said Thomas Magruder claims her as his slave for life and intends to carry her beyond the Jurisdiction of your Honors Court and that she is entitled to her freedom and is being oppressively and illegally claimed as a slave by the said Thomas Magruder.\" Also, in March 1834, \"The evidence in this case was considered by the court on the 21st March 1834 & thereupon it was ordered that the girl Evelina therein mentioned be discharged\" from Robey's slave jail.\nIn December 1834 \"P. H.\" wrote a letter to The Liberator abolitionist newspaper criticizing a New York lawyer named Fontaine H. Pettis, stating \"I hope you will do all in your power to give Mr. Pettis the notoriety which he seeks, and to send his name to posterity with those of Woolfolk, Washington Robie, and Franklin & Armfield.\" In 1836 Robey was living on 8th Street and advertised his interest in acquiring \"seventy or eighty likely young negroes.\" The same year, the American Anti-Slavery Society produced a broadside called \"The Slave Market of America\" about slavery and the slave trade in Washington, D.C. Robey's 7th Street tavern was pictured and mapped as Neal's Slave Jail and described in the caption:\n\nThis establishment was owned by W. Robey, who is also engaged in the trade. In May 1834, a gentleman visited it and fell into conversation with the overseer of the pen. He heard the clanking of chains within the pen. \"O,\" said the Overseer—himself a Slave, \"I have seen fifty or seventy Slaves taken out of the pen, and the males chained together in pairs, and drove off to the South—and how they would cry, and groan, and take on, and wring their hands but the driver would put on the whip and tell them to shut up so they would go off and bear it as well as they could.'\nThe standing advertisement of this house is as follows:\n\"CASH FOR 200 NEGROES.\"\n\"We will give cash for two hundred likely young negroes, of both sexes, families included. Persons wishing to dispose of their slaves, will do well to give us a call, as we will give higher prices in cash than any other purchasers who are now, or may hereafter come into this market. All communications will meet attention. We can at all times be found at our residence on 7th street, immediately South of the Centre Market House, Washington, D. C.\"\n\n\"JOSEPH W. NEAL & CO.\"\nRobey died of a lingering illness on New Year's Day 1841 at the age of 41. At the time of his death he ran a tavern on 8th Street between D and E streets; the fixtures and furniture were sold at auction in February 1841.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of American slave traders\nHistory of slavery in Washington, D.C.\nSlave markets and slave jails in the United States\nBibliography of the slave trade in the United States\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===",

        "content": "In the Rhythms of Tuqay (Tatar: Тукай аһәңнәре Tuqáy ahäñnäré, Russian: В ри́тмах Тука́я) is a vocal-symphonic poem based on the poems of Ğabdulla Tuqay, consisting of seven songs for voice and chamber orchestra, which Almaz Monasypov composed in 1975.\n\n\n== Origin ==\nThe texts are by Ğabdulla Tuqay (1986–1913). He was one of the most famous representatives of the Tatar Renaissance of the early 20th century. Almaz Monassypov took the seven poems from different years. The work was completed in 1975 on the poet's 90th birthday. The first edition of the poem, arranged for baritone and piano, was published in 1976 by the Tatar Book Publishing House. The work was premiered in 1976 by baritone Emil Cӓlӓletdinov with the TASSR Chamber Orchestra under the composer's direction.\n\n\n== Contents ==\nThe composer's interest in jazz is partly due to his collaboration with the Oleg Lundstrem Orchestra. Vocal-symphonic poetry is based, on the one hand, on features of Tatar and, to a greater extent, general Turkish music characteristic of the pre-revolutionary period. On the other hand, the work reflects the techniques of jazz, neoclassicism and even pop music. The work uses the Tatar folk melodies Täftiläw and A Few Horses. The 5/8 and 7/8 time signatures that are widespread in the poem, i.e. H. the metric features are characteristics, as in the folk songs Munadjat and Bajet.\nThere are two editions of the poem. The first edition was intended for the baritone Emil Cӓlӓletdinov, the second edition was published in 1993 for the tenor Idris Gasiew. The second edition uses the following instrumentation:\n\nTenor with microphone;\nTwo electric guitars;\norgan or electronic organ;\npiano with microphone;\npercussion with microphone;\nDoira;\nString orchestra.\n\n\n== Music ==\n\n\n=== Introduction ===\nThe poem begins with an introduction to the theme of the folk song “A Few Horses” in the text by Tukaj. This theme, combined with Tukaj's arrival in Kazan, \"the city of his destiny\", becomes the leitmotif of the main character's fate. The introductory music is a gradually developing folk song melody accompanied by a growing rhythmic ostinato. The ostinato rhythm imitates the sounds of a running horse's hooves. Without using words, \"A Few Horses\" is in a way Tukaj's eighth poem in this poetry.\n\n\n=== For the Homeland ===\nThe richly ornamented melody in a narrow vocal range is similar to Tatar book songs (a genre of Tatar folklore). The singing is accompanied by pentachords in the orchestra. Of the nine stanzas of Tukaj's poem, only six are used and form the three verses of the part.\n\n\n=== Try to Reach People's Hearts ===\nIn the second part of the poem, the poem “The Unnamed” by G. Tukaj is used in its entirety. Most of the techniques used in this song, including the diatonic fifth fall sequence, correspond to the style of 1970s Soviet popular music. The episodes in which the organ sounds solo between verses are reminiscent of oriental music.\n\n\n=== The Home Village ===\nIn the third part, only three of the four stanzas of Ğabdulla Tuqay's poem are used. The second verse, which mentions the Quran and the Prophet Mohammad, was deleted. The melody, which is reminiscent of a Munadjat chant with a time signature of 5/8, is accompanied by organ chords.\n\n\n=== Repentance ===\nThe part completely uses the poem of the same name by Ğabdulla Tuqay, which is a response to Alexander Pushkin's poem “The Tenth Commandment”. This poem is written in the genre of oriental poetry Nazire, as a retelling by the author of another author's poem. Small seconds and rhythmic features used in the passage are reminiscent of classical oriental music. In the introduction, Sornay's shrill sound is imitated with an abundance of small seconds. This duet between sornay and doira brings the song closer to the light music of the East (e.g., although the Nay is a wind instrument associated with Sufi ideas, it is more commonly used in the serious music of the East).\n\n\n=== Broken hope ===\nIn the introduction to the part, the leitmotif “A few horses” sounds. The song is based on one of Ğabdulla Tuqay's most famous poems - “Broken Hope”, sung to the folk melody “Täftiläw”. The richness of the song lies in the fact that sections of singing and recitation alternate. This part is the lyrical center of the vocal-symphonic poem.\nIn bars 48–64 in the orchestral section there is a quote from the Tatar folk melody “Täftiläw”. In order to make the counterpoint of the soloist's melody and the quotation sound more distinctive, the composer combines them in different time signatures. In other passages the folk song is used in modifications.\nIn bars 43–46 of the song, the first half of the leitmotif “A Few Horses” appears in the singer's part.\n\n\n=== I Did Not Know ===\nThe sixth part is written on the poem “Voice from the Murid Cemetery” by Ğabdulla Tuqay, which was created under the influence of Ayaz İshaki's novel “Disappearance in 200 Years”. One of the main ideas of this poem by G. Tukay is criticism of Sufism, but not rejection. Almaz Monasypov was forced to use a version of the poem approved by the Soviet censors: the 10th bayet above the novel \"Disappearance\" concluding the main idea was omitted, the word \"Quran\" in the sixth bayet was replaced by \"Chulpan\". This part was published with the original words by Ğabdulla Tuqay and a version adapted to the modern Tatar language by Nuri Arslan. In the repertoire of Idris Gasiev and Emil Cӓlӓletdinov, the song is performed only after the words of Nuri Arslan.\nThe music is based on the ascending and descending ostinato movement along the tetrachord.\n\n\n=== This Dark Cloud Over Us Will Disappear ===\nThe last part is written based on the poem “Tatar Youth”. The form of the song goes back to a version of the basso ostinato variations. With each new variation the changes increase. At the end of the sixth variation, the theme modulates into C minor (or C sharp minor in the II edition). At the end of the seventh variation they return to the tonality. In addition to basso ostinato, melismas, figures and textures are close to baroque music and are therefore reflected in the neoclassicism characteristic of European music of the 20th century.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nSo far, “In the Rhythms of Tukaj” has been performed in concert halls in Kazan, Ufa, Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Yekaterinburg and other cities. The work with the voice of Emil Djalaletdinov was recorded on the ninth CD of the Tatar Musical Phonochrestomatie.\nThe third song, “The Home Village,” is used as the main theme of the second movement in Almaz Monasypov's “Chamber Concerto for Three Flutes and Harp.”\n\n\n== Recordings ==\nEmil Cӓlӓletdinov, baritone; TASSR Chamber Orchestra under the direction of Almaz Monasypov; 1976\nIdris Gasiew, tenor; State Academic Symphony Orchestra of the Tatarstan Republic under the direction of Almaz Monasypov; 1993\n\n\n== Literature ==\nМонасыйпов, Алмаз (1976).

        "content": "Mayan is a 74-foot wooden schooner designed by John G. Alden and built in Belize in 1947.  She is an Alden Design No. 356-B Centerboard Schooner and constructed of Honduran mahogany.  Her name was taken from her country of origin of Belize.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nMayan uses a transitional schooner rig with a gaff foresail.  She has an overall length of 66 feet and a beam of 16.5 feet.  She is 59 feet on deck and 62 feet to the main masthead with the intent to be operated on the Intracoastal Waterway.  Her draft ranges from a maximum of 10 feet to a minimum of 4.5 feet through the use of a lifting centerboard. She has a ballast of 9,000 pounds and a displacement of 60,000 pounds.  She is built of Honduran mahogany for the frames, yellow pine for the caulked carvel planking, and teak for the decks.\nMayan accommodates eight guests and requires a crew of three to sail.\n\n\n== History ==\nMayan was designed by John Alden's office in 1946 for Charles Allen, a WWII Navy captain, based on their Design No. 356B originally designed in 1928.  Allen's son, Paul Allen led the construction team at Tewie's Dockyard near Belize City, in the former British Honduras.  She was sailed to New York City after launching.  She was sold in 1948 and served in the charter trade under a series of owners through the 1950s and 1960s.\nIn 1967, musician David Crosby purchased Mayan in Fort Lauderdale for $22,500 borrowed from Peter Tork and moved her to Santa Barbara, California. In 1970, Crosby began living on Mayan full-time and wrote rock songs such as Wooden Ships, Carry Me, and Lee Shore while aboard.  He owned her for 45 years.\nIn 2005, Mayan was rebuilt by master shipwright Wayne Ettel in Wilmington Harbor, California.\nIn 2014, Beau Vrolyk purchased Mayan from Crosby for $750,000 and moved her to Santa Cruz, California.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External Links ==\nSchooner Mayan Facebook page\nSchooner Mayan Medium blog\nMayan Blogspot blog",

        "content": "St John the Evangelist's Church is an Anglican church in Buttercrambe, a village in North Yorkshire in England.\nThe church lies in a grassy churchyard, south of the village's Main Street.  It was originally constructed around 1240, with a four-bay nave, south aisle and chancel.  Since at least 1404, the church has been a chapel of ease to St Botolph's Church, Bossall.  In the 15th century, the nave was shortened, the aisle removed, and the chancel rebuilt.  The church was altered in 1803, and then heavily restored between 1878 and 1881.  The architect is unclear, but may have been C. Hodgson Fowler or Temple Moore.  The building was grade II* listed in 1953.\n\nThe church is built in limestone and sandstone and has a Westmorland slate roof.  It consists of a nave measuring 40 feet by 16 feet, and a chancel at a slight angle.  The chancel has a 13th-century door in its north wall.  On the junction of the nave and the chancel is a bell turret with a spire.  Most of the windows are in Perpendicular style, almost all dating from the Victorian restoration.  Inside, there are several wall monuments, the earliest dating from 1674.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGrade II* listed buildings in North Yorkshire\nListed buildings in Buttercrambe with Bossall\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Mary Ann Wells (June 7, 1894 – January 8, 1971) was an American dance teacher known for her significant contributions to the field of dance education. Born in Appleton, Wisconsin, Wells began her career as the first ballet teacher at the Cornish School of Music in Seattle. She later established her own studio in c. 1922, where she emphasized a philosophy of artistic exploration and expression over technical precision. Throughout her career, Wells mentored numerous talented dancers, many of whom went on to achieve prominence in the dance world.\nShe is considered the most influential ballet teacher of Pacific Northwest.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life and education ===\nMary Ann Wells was born on June 7, 1894, in Appleton, Wisconsin, to Charles Wells and Nell (last name unknown). Her dance training included studying with the noted ballet teacher Luigi Albertieri, who was associated with the Chicago Opera at the time. Wells's only performing experience was a brief stint with the Minnesota Stock Company.\n\n\n=== Career ===\nIn 1916, at the age of 21, Wells relocated to Seattle and took on the role of the inaugural ballet instructor as well was the founder and head of the dancing department at the Cornish School of Music, a position she held until 1922. During her time at the Cornish School, Wells played a key role in establishing the ballet department and overseeing student performances, fostering an environment that nurtured aspiring dancers. It was also in 1916 that Wells married A. Forest King, a Seattle-based businessman, with whom she bore no children.\n\nAfter her tenure at the Cornish School, Wells founded her own dance studio in Seattle in c. 1922. The studio named \"Mary Ann Wells School of Dance,\" featured a quote from poet Kahlil Gibran on its walls, reflecting Wells' approach to dance instruction. Despite her association with the I AM Temple, known for its strict vegetarian practices, Wells focused on cultivating her students' passion for dance rather than enforcing rigid technical standards. Her teaching style aimed to encourage artistic exploration and self-expression in a supportive setting.\nWells' studio, strategically located above a restaurant owned by the father of one of her most talented students, Robert Joffrey, served as an incubator for emerging dance talent. Under Wells' mentorship, several of her student dancers found success in the dance industry. Among them, Gerald Arpino, Martin Buckner, William Weslow, and Richard Englund gained prominence as choreographers and directors after honing their skills under her guidance.\n\n\n=== Later life and legacy ===\nShe retired in 1958 due to poor eyesight. Despite minimal direct involvement with the Joffrey Ballet, its style echoed her teachings. The company dedicated its 1971–1972 season to her memory, following her death in 1971 in Seattle.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nDoris, Hering (February 2000). \"Wells, Mary Ann\".

        "title": "Sensory drive hypothesis",
        "revision_id": 1223604141,
        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "The sensory drive hypothesis posits that when local environmental conditions differ between conspecific populations, communication systems will adapt to these conditions. Sensory drive predicts that both communication signals and perceptual systems will adapt to these local environmental conditions. Divergence will then occur based on the intensity and direction of selection on the mating signals and on the sensory systems acquiring information regarding predators, prey, and potential mates.\nThe sensory drive hypothesis has two primary assumptions. The first is that greater sensory stimulation results in preferences for mates with the stimulating trait, meaning exaggerated traits are expected to have greater signal value and generate more mating because they cause a stronger response from the sensory system. In this sense, it is possible for sensory drive to contribute to the formation of runaway traits when sexual selection is working in the same direction as the sensory biases. The second assumption is that biases are relatively fixed and show limited developmental plasticity.\nMating signals, perceptual systems, and behavioral responses are not independent. As a result, as one of these diverges based on selective pressures, the others should also diverge unless under independent selection against divergence. While sensory drive is likely not the primary driver involved in speciation, it is able to set the initial evolutionary trajectory of an aspect involved in these communication signals that can be acted on by evolutionary forces to drive speciation.\nTo find support for the sensory drive hypothesis, there needs to be a match between the biases of the sensory system predicted by environmental constraints and a match between signals and that sensory bias. As of 2018, support has been found for the sensory component with there being a strong bias towards aquatic systems (57% of studies) and visual signals (83% of studies). There is also support for the signal component with more bias towards terrestrial systems (71% of studies) and visual signals (57% of studies). There have also been papers focused on identifying support for both the sensory and signal components; of these papers, only those with support for the sensory drive hypothesis have been published. Similar to the studies focusing on the sensory component, there is a bias towards aquatic systems (62% of studies) and visual signals (86% of studies) with the majority of these being focused on fish taxa (55% of studies).\n\n\n== Visual signals and vision ==\nIn a typical vertebrate eye, light passes through the ocular media (cornea, lens, and vitreous humor) before reaching the retina, where it passes through several layers of cells before finally reaching the photoreceptors. Transmission properties in each layer vary according to wavelength. One study found that cone cell sensitivities vary between individual guppies, which influenced Endler's original hypothesis in 1992. Scientists do not yet understand how color preferences are impacted by this variation. Additionally, UV waves may be transmitted through the eye differently in different individuals and/or populations; this has been documented in birds, especially warblers. This may be selectively advantageous for a species if its predator is incapable of seeing UV wavelengths, allowing for conspecific communication without drawing attention from predators. Sensory drive could explain differences in UV preference if properties of the ocular media are not uniform between populations. For example, two closely related species of Anolis lizards differ such that the males of the species that is more sensitive to UV wavelengths reflect UV light on their dewlaps (used for signaling to mates) more than the males of the species that is less sensitive to this light. In general, marine organisms tend to have a greater capacity for visual tuning than terrestrial vertebrates, which could partially explain why most of the studies that find evidence of sensory drive focus on aquatic systems.\nThere is a great diversity of colors in the animal kingdom, which is potentially explained by color perception and how the environment drives its evolution. One aspect of this is color contrast (when an object's color appears to be different when seen in front of varied backgrounds). For instance, an animal will perceive the color of a yellow bird differently when it is viewed in front of a dark brown tree trunk versus a bright blue sky. This connection between environment and detection is an integral part of the sensory drive hypothesis.\nThree mechanisms for the evolution of visual perception have been proposed relating perception, signal, and environmental factors. The first ignores the effects of environmental conditions and proposes that color and perception traits coevolve as a result of social selection, e.g., females’ preferences for certain colors in males. For more on this, see Fisherian runaway. The second mechanism also predicts coevolution of color and perception, but the direction of evolution is influenced by environmental factors, according to the sensory drive hypothesis. For a given male trait, the strength of female preference depends on the honesty of the trait in conveying the male's quality and the detectability of the trait. Variation in detectability is expected to significantly influence color diversification; this variation often is due to the features of the habitat occupied by the population in question. Even if males’ colors accurately represent their quality as a mate, poor visibility as a result of environmental factors could result in females choosing males of poorer quality. This could lead to the evolution of preferences for other, more easily detected, male characteristics. The final mechanism proposes that evolution carries on linearly, without any feedback loops: environmental conditions define the selective pressures that change color perception, which in turn drives the evolution of colors. The most obvious example of this is found when analyzing the need for organisms to detect and hide from predators and prey.\nThe amount of visible light as well as the range of colors in water decreases sharply with depth and other abiotic and biotic factors that contribute to turbidity. Studies have found that these gradients correlate with several color perception traits, including those related to opsins. For example, in surfperch living in kelp forests, natural selection has likely favored refined color discrimination, which allows for easier detection of prey against the background. Sensory drive explains male cichlid coloration and female preference in Lake Victoria, where the light gradient is highly predictable. Threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus spp.) are another example of coevolution of male signals and female perception driven by environmental factors. Males either display red or black nuptial colors, and there is a direct correlation between female sensitivity to red light and preference for red males. Since such steep gradients of light availability and quality are not observed in terrestrial environments, it is less likely to find support for sensory drive here as well as in aquatic environments that are less optically constrained.\nIn cichlids and guppies, opsin expression can be explained both by phenotypic plasticity and genotypic variation between populations and species, though scientists have not yet determined which is more important. One problem for future work to address is that it is difficult to link genotypes for opsin tuning and expression with behavioral phenotypes, which is a key component of the sensory drive hypothesis.\n\n\n== Acoustic signals and hearing ==\nThe auditory systems of animals are impacted by both the biotic and abiotic conditions in their environment. Under conditions of high background noise, there is evidence of perceptual tuning to better perceive and respond to conspecific signals. For example, in anurans (frogs and toads) there is evidence of perceptual tuning of the inner ear sensitivity to best perceive conspecifics and to prevent hybridization. Additionally in anurans, there is evidence for perceptual tuning contributing to directional selection on acoustic signals.\nAn organism's auditory system can also be tuned to perceive signals produced by both prey and predators. For example, by an organism's perceptual tuning to perceive echolocating bats. This anti-predator strategy is also seen in some spider systems, such as Deinopis spinosa, which have evolved higher perceptual capabilities to perceive avian predator cues. In addition, there is evidence that predator species will use auditory cues to detect prey items as well as parasitoid wasps that can detect host cricket species.\nAcoustic signals are considered to be most affected by biotic noise rather than abiotic noise compared to other signal modalities. In a study of tropical bird species, it was determined that divergence in bird song during the dawn chorus was more strongly predicted by the composition of competing songs rather than phylogenetic relatedness or physical location. This has also been tested and agreed upon in insects and frogs, as well as other bird systems.\nEvidence for sensory drive in acoustic signaling and perception is lower than that in visual signaling. In a recent meta-analysis, they determined that of the studies showing no support for sensory drive, 95% of them were testing the acoustic signal modality. However, of the studies testing the sensory drive hypothesis in acoustic signaling, only two tested both components of sensory drive (signal and sensory). The majority of acoustic studies tested the signal component of sensory drive and there were many fewer studies testing the sensory component, suggesting this is an understudied modality. Support for both components of the sensory drive hypothesis has been identified in birds, specifically Parus major, and frogs, specifically Amolops tormotus. In both cases, background noise is the driver underlying the sensory biases contributing to sensory drive and signal divergence.\nThere is also support in acoustic systems for sensory drive contributing to speciation and the diversification of lineages. For example, the Paragalago zanzibaricus species complex shows support for speciation by sensory drive by looking at responses to conspecific and heterospecific signals and ear morphology. Additionally, a study in tropical birds found that habitat characteristics predict acoustic divergence, suggesting sensory drive is playing a role in this divergence and potentially reproductive isolation\n\n\n== Chemical signals and chemosensation ==\nChemical signals are among the most prevalent signal modalities, but there is a lack of research focusing on sensory drive in this modality. This is likely driven by three main complications when studying chemosensation: complex chemical backgrounds, complex chemical signals, and complex genetic basis for chemosensation.  \nRecent work has discovered that chemical signals, similar to the other modalities discussed, are also affected by environmental conditions. Under higher temperatures, chemical signals travel faster but also fade faster. Similarly, in nutrient rich or chemically complex environments, chemical signal detection can be greatly decreased. These signals can also be subject to different interferences such as masking by other chemicals, disruption of the biological signaling pathway, or interference with the chemosensor\nThe majority of support for sensory drive in chemosensation is considered a by-product of research that is not explicitly exploring sensory drive. For example, in the Podarcis hispanicus species complex divergent environmental conditions (cold and humid vs. wet and dry) have led to divergence in the chemical composition of the signals. This divergence is likely to contribute to producing more efficient and stable signals in their respective environments. These signals are used to mark male territory and attract female mates and both males and females show stronger responses to the conspecific signals from their respective environments. While this is only a single example, this modality may be more important for sensory drive and the process of speciation than the lack of literature suggests.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Sherwin-Williams Headquarters is a 36-story office building in Cleveland, Ohio. At 616 ft (188 m), it is the 4th tallest building in Cleveland, and the 6th tallest building in Ohio. As the name implies, it is the global headquarters of Sherwin-Williams, the largest paint and coating company in the world. The headquarters complex consists of three city blocks, including the primary tower, a parking garage, and a pavilion, with hints of possible future expansion within the remainder of the lots.\n\n\n== History ==\nSherwin-Williams was founded in Cleveland, Ohio in 1866. Since 1930, the company has been headquartered in the Midland Building, which is part of the larger Landmark Office Towers Complex. In 2019, the company announced that it was seeking to move into a larger office building, potentially leaving Cleveland altogether, although they confirmed they would be staying in Cleveland in February 2020. In March 2020, the company paid $49.4 million for the 7 acre plot of land for the building, which was previously a 1,100 space parking lot.\nIn late 2022, the final design of the building was submitted to the city. Construction of the building began in 2022, with site preparation and foundation construction, both of which were completed in 2023. In 2023, the structural steel construction began and finished, as well as the building enclosure and interior finishes, with the enclosure having finished in 2024. Interior finishing are expected to continue until early 2025. In 2024, the final details and landscaping for the building are also expected to continue into 2025. Occupancy by employees is expected in late 2024.\nThe possibility of an HQ2 has been mentioned since the design phase of the building in 2021, which would be a building adjacent to the current tower within the same lot, as job growth within the company will put the new headquarters at full capacity as soon as it is completed, at the intended 3,500 employees. Surface parking lots were intentionally left in the plans of the headquarters for future development of a Phase Two.\n\n\n== Design ==\nThe headquarters contains about 1 million square footage, and contains three buildings, including the primary 36-story tower, a two-story pavilion, and a 5-story parking garage. The main tower is facing W 3rd Street, while the parking garage is located on the other side of Frankfort Avenue connected via a skybridge, while there is a skybridge connecting the tower to the pavilion on the other side of the W 3rd Street. The two empty surface parking lots that remained in the plans for a potential Phase Two are within the same lots as the tower and the parking garage.\nThe design of the tower is largely glass, with the Sherwin-Williams name being located near the top of the building on both the east and west sides. There is a large vertical LED light running down the center of the building that shines white typically, as well as various thin vertical stripes along the top the part of the building, although in the designs they have shown special event lighting concepts such as red and blue for the Sherwin-Williams logo, pink for Breast Cancer Awareness, red, white, and blue for Veteran's Day, or a rainbow for Pride. The first three floors of the building consists of the lobby and other non-office amenities. Floors 5-13 are to contain office space, and floor 14 is to contain conference rooms and terraces. The parking garage of the building contains space for a retailer, and the wall facing Frankfort Avenue is to contain anthology wall, as well as public art facing other streets. Frankfort Avenue, the street between the tower and the garage, is to be repaved with a herringbone pattern consisting of three colors, with the addition of a bike lane and bike racks.\nThe pavilion of the tower, located across the street, takes up an entire city block, although the two story pavilion building only takes up part of the lot, with the rest of the lot acting as a public plaza with lots of green landscaping. The pavilion building is to contain large glass windows visible from every side, and contains a lobby. The plaza of the pavilion contains a purple-pink color garden, a rainbow walkway alongside the pavilion building and main tower, and various trees, with dozens of species of flowers and trees within the plaza and around the headquarters complex as a whole. The lawn in the plaza is to contain a large sign saying Sherwin-Williams Global Headquarters.

        "content": "Mangoldia is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the subfamily Graphidoideae of the family Graphidaceae. It contains four species of corticolous (bark-dwelling) script lichens.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe genus was circumscribed in 2012 by the lichenologists Robert Lücking, Sittiporn Parnmen, and H. Thorsten Lumbsch. It was made to hold two Australian species that have Phaeographis-like ascomata (fruiting bodies) but Graphis-like ascospores. The genus name honours Armin Mangold, \"for his outstanding contribution to the knowledge of thelotremoid Graphidaceae in Australia\".\nMangoldia is in the tribe Graphideae, subfamily Graphidoideae of the family Graphidaceae. Mangoldia has a sister taxon relationship with genus Allographa.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe thallus of the Mangoldia species is corticolous, meaning it primarily grows on the bark of trees. It is continuous and partly endoperidermal, indicating that part of the thallus grows beneath the outer bark layer. The surface of the thallus is uneven and white. When observed in cross-section, it features a very thin, corticiform (bark-like) layer and an irregular layer containing algal cells that are essential for photosynthesis.\nApothecia (fruiting bodies) emerge from the thallus and are angular to lirelliform (slit-shaped). The disc of the apothecia is exposed and ranges in colour from blackish brown to black, without any powdery or waxy covering (epruinose). The thalline margin around the disc is thin, white, and may be fissured to lobulated. The proper margin, which is distinct from the thalline margin, is thin, stands out prominently, and is black. In a cross-section, this margin appears very thin and consists of densely packed fungal cells (prosoplectenchymatous), which are pale yellowish to brownish on the outer parts. There are no periphysoids (hair-like structures) present.\nThe hymenium (the spore-bearing layer) does not contain interspersed particles, and the paraphyses (sterile filaments within the hymenium) are unbranched. The ascospores, which are spores produced within the asci (spore-producing cells), number 4 to 8 per ascus. They are muriform (divided by both transverse and longitudinal septa), ellipsoid in shape, and have thickened septa that stain violet-blue with iodine, with rounded internal spaces (lumina) and are colourless. No chemical substances were detected in this genus when tested with thin-layer chromatography, suggesting a lack of distinctive secondary metabolites typically used for identifying and classifying lichens.\n\n\n== Species ==\nMangoldia has four species:\n\nMangoldia australiana Lücking, Parnmen & Lumbsch (2012) – Australia\nMangoldia bylii (Vain.) I.Medeiros (2022) – Australia; South Africa\nMangoldia lecideicarpa (Zahlbr.) Lücking, M.Cáceres & Aptroot (2024) – Brazil\nMangoldia thallolomoides Aptroot, Lücking & M.Cáceres (2024) – Brazil\nMangoldia atronitens (A.W.Archer) Lücking, Parnmen & Lumbsch (2012), one of the original Australian species originally included in the genus, was shown to differ from Mangoldia bylii by only minute differences in spore size, and so Ian Medeiros and François Lutzoni treated them to be synonymous in a 2022 publication, further noting that \"previously unrecognized presence of this genus in South Africa highlights biogeographical connections between southern Africa and Australasia\".\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "“The day lasts for more than a century...”, also “Eternal Blizzard” (2018) – one of the significant performances of the Tatar Academic Theater named after. Ğ. Kamal in the Tatar language of the late 2010s. The premiere of the play at the Ğaliӓsğӓr Kamal Theater was timed to coincide with the 90th anniversary of the birth of the classic of Kyrgyz prose Chingiz Aitmatov and took place on November 4, 2018. The performance was performed in Tatar with simultaneous translation into Russian.\nOn December 9, 2018, the play was presented at the X All-Russian Festival of Young Directors \"Hönӓr\" (Craft). The performance was among seven that are nominated for the \"Performance of the Year\" (2019) award as a result of an open online vote by the magazine \"Inde\".\nLast performed May 30, 2021.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe director and author of the play's staging, Ilgiz Zainiev, shortens some storylines in order to highlight one, according to his idea, the most important: “the history of human destinies in difficult times\". The action takes place in the 60–80s of the 20th century in the village of Sary-Ozek, but the plot covers the entire century and even fragments from the history of the peoples who lived in these lands in ancient times. The simultaneous development of action in the present and past - in two time layers - determines the play of some characters by two actors. The action, taking place in the present, is based on the funeral of Kazangap, a friend of the main character of the play, Edigei.\nKazangap's death prompted his relatives and friends to gather. After discussing and resolving some differences, they decide to bury Kazangap in the old cemetery of their ancestors, which is located at a distant distance. On this long journey, everyone is immersed in their own thoughts, including the main character. The chain of memories of Edigei, allusions to the past, are strung together on the main dramatic line: the emergence of friendship between young Kazangap and Edigei, the arrival of teacher Abutalib and his wife Zaripa in the village, a happy and cheerful New Year's Eve, and then the arrest of the teacher on a false denunciation, grief, unrequited love, the end era of repressions and executions. Often the viewer is introduced to legends and parables, which with renewed vigor reveal the theme of the trampled memory of the people. This is the merit of ruthless politics, eternal progress and people's blind pursuit of an easy life. Thus, many memories from centuries ago are experienced by the main character within one day.\n\n\n== Actors ==\nParticipated in the play:\n\nAlsou Gainullina\nIldar Khairullin\nAidar Khafizov\nRuzia Motyygullina\nAskhat Khismatov\nMinvali Gabdullin\nAlmaz Sabirzyanov\nMilyausha Shaikhetdinova\nFanis Safin\nGulchachak Gaifetdinova\nAirat Arslanov\nFanis Zihansha\nRamil Vaziev\nIltuzar Makhammetgaliev\nAlmaz Burkhanov\nAigul Shakurova\nIlnur Zakirov\nEmil Talipov\nLaysan Fayzullina\nAlmaz Garayev\nFannur Mukhametzyanova\nElvir Salimov\nGuzel Gyulverdieva\nIrek Kashapov\n\n\n== Music ==\nThe music for the play was written by a modern Tatar composer, member of the Union of Composers of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Tatarstan Elmir Nizamov. The composer uses a chamber composition: national instruments quray (woodwind), qubız and dumbıra (plucked strings); violin, trumpet and piano. The main place in the performance is occupied by stylizations of folk melodies. At times, melodies are given by E. Nizamov without any changes and can be similar to their originals. In other cases, these stylizations are given in the processing of the style of light music or the minimalist style of our time.\n\n\n== See also ==\nThe Day Lasts More Than a Hundred Years (novel)\n\n\n== Notes ==",

It is the offices and meeting place of Harlow District Council.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAfter Harlow was designated as a new town on 25 March 1947, the new Harlow Development Corporation commissioned its own offices, Adams House on the east side of the Market Square. A simple, three storey office block, it was designed by a Manchester-born architect, John Graham, and completed in the early 1950s.\nHarlow became an urban district in 1955, and the new council was initially accommodated at Netteswell Hall and Netteswell House, on Park Lane. However, the new council leaders needed a permanent meeting place and the site they chose was on the south side of Cross Street in an area known as The High. The new town hall was designed by Sir Frederick Gibberd in the modern style, built in concrete and was officially opened by Lord Attlee in 1960. The design involved a nine-storey tower with a rooftop viewing room which was designed by John Graham. Gibberd had originally wanted the tower to be at least 15 storeys high but cost constraints did not allow that.\nBy the early 21st century, the town hall was becoming increasingly dilapidated and civic leaders decided to demolish it, and to commission a new mixed-use complex involving a retail mall and new civic offices. The site selected incorporated the footprint of the old town hall but also extended south towards a landscaped area, which contained concrete lined pools known as the Water Gardens. The old town hall was demolished in 2002. The Water Gardens, which contained a series of sculptures by Henry Moore, had to be severely truncated to accommodate the new development.\nThe new complex was designed by Benoy Architects in the modern style, built in concrete and glass and was officially opened by Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester on 19 May 2004. The design involved an asymmetrical main frontage facing south onto the gardens. The civic centre was at the west end of the complex and featured a three bay rectangular portico formed by columns supporting a balcony and a series of huge louvres on the first floor. Internally, the principal room was the council chamber, located behind the louvres. The proclamation of King Charles III was read out from the balcony on 11 September 2022.\nWorks of art in the civic centre include a painting by André Verlon entitled \"Barrage\".\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Gordon Thomas Savage, commonly known as John Savage, (18 February 1867 – 23 April 1951) was an English footballer who played as a forward.\n\n\n== Career ==\nSavage began his career in England, playing for Notts County.\nLater moving to Italy, Savage was a member of the first Torino Football & Cricket Club side, playing alongside fellow Englishmen Edward Dobbie and Herbert Kilpin, the latter of whom would later become a founding member of AC Milan. In 1891, Savage signed for Internazionale Torino, following the merger between Torino Football & Cricket Club and Nobili Torino, once again playing alongside Dobbie and Kiplin, as well as compatriot George Beaton. During Savage's time at Internazionale Torino, he captained the club, as well as being called up for an Italian representative side on 30 April 1899 in a 2–0 loss against a Swiss representative side, in which is now seen as a precursor to the Italian national team.\nIn 1900, Savage signed for Juventus, becoming the first foreign player at the club. Over the course of two seasons, Savage made five appearances with Juventus. Savage is best known, however, for providing Juventus with their famous black and white striped shirts. In 1901, after seeing the state of Juventus' pink shirts, which Savage likened to being similar to a \"gang of war survivors\", Savage sent a letter to Nottingham-based tailoring company Shaw and Shrewsbury, requesting new shirts for the club. Nearly a month later, Savage presented his teammates with new black and white shirts, the same colours of former club Notts County. Initially, Juventus' Italian players were not keen on the shirts, with Juventus founding member Domenico Donna comparing them to funeral attire, however, opinions were soon changed, following the upturn in Juventus' form, with Donna labelling the new shirts as \"a symbol of old fashioned Piedmontese elegance\". Juventus' close connections with Notts County remain into the 21st century, with Notts County being chosen to play Juventus to open their new Juventus Stadium in September 2011.\nFollowing his time at Juventus, Savage refereed the 1902 Italian Football Championship final between Genoa and AC Milan.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Red Clay Strays are an American country rock band formed in Mobile, Alabama. They are best known for their 2022 single \"Wondering Why\", which saw success in late 2023 after going viral on the social media platform TikTok. The song became their first song to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, reaching number 71.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 2016–2020: Initial formation ===\nThe Red Clay Strays formed as the successor to a cover band in Mobile, Alabama in 2016, consisting of lead singer Brandon Coleman, bassist Andrew Bishop, and guitarist Drew Nix. As the group started to perform more original material, they regrouped and formed the Red Clay Strays, adding drummer John Hall and guitarist Zach Rishel in the process. The group continued to perform locally in smaller venues across the southeastern United States and built up a local following, signing with management company Ontourage Management in 2019. In November 2019, they released the single \"Good Godly Woman\", which was featured in the film Doctor Sleep. They followed this with the singles \"No Way to Know\" and \"Will the Lord Remember Me\" in 2020. However, the group had to step back from touring due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n=== 2020–2023: Moment of Truth and continued growth ===\nFunded primarily by crowdfunding efforts spurred by manager Cody Payne, the group recorded their debut studio album Moment of Truth in Huntsville, Alabama. The group self-released the album in April 2022, but did not see much commercial success initially. In 2023, the group signed with talent agency WME and began talks with labels. While they initially wanted to remain independent, the group signed with Thirty Tigers in May 2023. This was followed by performances at festivals including Lollapalooza and CMA Fest. In August 2023, they released their first live EP as part of media platform Western AF's YouTube series Live AF.\n\n\n=== 2023–present: Commercial breakthrough ===\nThroughout 2023, the Red Clay Strays started building traction on social media, culminating in \"Wondering Why\" going viral on TikTok in September. \"Wondering Why\" was initially released in March 2022 as a single from Moment of Truth and saw a boost on streaming services in late 2023 due to the Live AF performance of the song going viral. The song became the group's first song to enter a Billboard chart when it debuted on the Hot Rock & Alternative Songs chart at number 33 on the chart dated November 25. In December, it became their first Billboard Hot 100 entry when it debuted at number 93. This coincided with their Way Too Long headlining tour, which concluded in March 2024. Also in March 2024, the group signed a record deal with RCA Records, followed by a global publishing deal with Warner Chappell Music in April 2024. In August 2024, the group will embark on a five-show tour in Europe. Additionally, the group is working on their upcoming second studio album, which will be produced by Dave Cobb.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Live EPs ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== Tours ==\nThe Way Too Long Tour (2023–2024)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "María Dolores \"Lola\" Botella Arbona (20 July 1945 – 31 August 2023) was a Spanish People's Party (PP) politician. She was the mayor of Carcaixent in the Valencian Community from 1999 to 2015, and a deputy in the Corts Valencianes from 2007 to 2011 and from 2014 to 2015.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBotella served four terms as mayor, having the longest tenure in the city's history. Her tenure coincided with the Spanish property bubble, during which there were many new buildings in the city. In 2015 she chose not to run again, giving her place at the top of the list to the leader of the local PP, Salvador Ferrer.\nBotella was elected to the Corts Valencianes in the 2007 Valencian regional election, running 14th on the PP list in the Valencia constituency. She was listed 33rd in 2011 and was not elected, but returned to her seat in the legislature in July 2014 after 19 names ahead of her had resigned, the last being that of Serafín Castellano.\nIn February 2013, Botella was charged with alleged misappropriation of public funds. The investigation was part of the Gürtel case.\nBotella died at age 78, after a long illness.\n\n\n== References ==",

Any purchases of the Rose would donate £2.50 to charity.\n\n\n== Description ==\nIt is described as \"an elegant hybrid\" that has a dark red color consisting of a full round bloom atop light green leaves. It is known to emit moderate amounts of fragrance. The Royal Horticultural Society says \"Large clusters of sweetly scented, semi-double bright scarlet to crimson-red flowers with white flecks appear on long stems blooming continuously from June through to September\".\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "National Mary Washington Memorial Association (NMWMA) is a hereditary American woman's organization created in Washington, D.C. in 1889, to support in perpetuity the monument to Mary Ball Washington located at Fredericksburg, Virginia. It is the second chartered historical and patriotic society among women in the United States.\nOn February 22, 1890, the Association was chartered in the District of Columbia, for 1000 years. This organization, composed almost wholly of women and limited to 600 hereditary life members, received by gift the land that had been deeded to the Fredericksburg association and, with the active cooperation of the Daughters of the American Revolution, secured the money needed and built there a new monument and lodge, the title to which was vested in the President and the Chief Justice of the United States and the governor of Virginia, ex officio, as trustees.\n\n\n== Death of Mary Washington ==\n\nMary Ball Washington died August 25, 1789, at Fredericksburg, Virginia. She was buried on August 28. All over the country, the mourning was general, press and churches made note of the event, and members of congress wore mourning for thirty days. President Washington wrote a note of thanks to congress for the passing of a resolution to build a monument in memory of his mother. But the new government had more pressing duties than the building of monuments. When Lafayette visited the United States in 1825, nothing but a little headstone marked the grave of Mary Washington.\n\n\n== First monument ==\n\nIn 1831, the citizens of Fredericksburg had secured about US$2,000 for the building of a monument over the grave when Silas E. Burrows of New York asked \"to be allowed the honor of individually erecting the monument.\" The generous offer was accepted and [President Andrew Jackson laid the cornerstone on May 7, 1833. In the next four years, the base of the monument with its little Doric columns was completed and the obelisk was on the ground ready to be lifted into place when the work was suddenly abandoned. After providing money for the completion of the work, Mr. Burrows went to China where he died; then the contractor died.\nThe first monument was never completed, its stones crumbled and fell, and around them, for four years, surged the American Civil War. From time to time, attempts were made to complete the monument or to build a new one. Two or three times, bills for that purpose passed the U.S. Senate and failed to pass the United States House of Representatives.\n\n\n== Two associations ==\nIn the spring of 1889, \"the grave of the Mother of Washington,\" at Fredericksburg, Virginia, was advertised in the newspapers: \"For sale at auction to the highest bidder\", by a distant real estate man who had made capital of Washington's tomb.\nIn June 1889, the NMWMA was organized in Washington, D.C. at the home of Amelia Champlin Warner Waite, wife of Chief Justice Morrison Waite, with attention being called to the state of the grave and monument of Washington's mother by the advertisement of a Fredericksburg, Virginia, auctioneer, who was to sell it to the highest bidder. At their first meeting, they appointed their officers: Amelia Waite, President, and Margaret Hetzel, whose dollar was the first in the National coffer, serving as a substantial support to her accompanying appeal to the Washington Post, suggesting that women should rear the long sought monument, and that every woman able to do so should send US$1 toward it, The Post serving as treasurer. They also formulated their plan for the National Association, providing that a vice-president from each State be appointed. Further action was unexpectedly suspended on account of the \"Johnstown Flood\" during the month of June, when the sympathies of the whole country were aroused in behalf of its sufferers. In the fall, however, work was resumed. A charter was obtained by the NMWMA on February 22, 1890.\nThe first meeting of the National Association, after incorporation, was held in the Green Room of the White House May 13, 1891, It was attended by some of the most distinguished women at the capital. There, they organized the National Association for the purpose of rescuing the grave and completing the unfinished monument, if practicable, or erecting a new one. Among Hetzel's early acts in its behalf was a resolution before the DAR, when in the fall of 1890 they actually organized, to secure the aid and interest of this body, and her resolution was unanimously carried. Hereditary life memberships in the National Society, on the payment of US$25, were suggested by Mrs. Roger A. Pryor, of Virginia, and until February 1896, such members would be welcomed.\nAt the same time, the people of Fredericksburg were seized with horror and indignation. The women of Fredericksburg reviewed the situation, and in October 1889, organized their society, which was chartered November 16, 1889. Slowly, the work progressed, until the Fredericksburg association had about US$5,000, the ruins of the old monument, and more than 5 acres (2.0 ha) of ground. Two citizens of Fredericksburg presented the local association with two lots and the third was bought by the local association with the proceeds of a local appeal of another citizen. Late in 1889, Mr. McDowell, in a letter to the Fredericksburg Association, wrote asking if it would not be a good idea \"For your ladies to incorporate as the Virginia Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution and your gentlemen as the Virginia Society of the Sons of the American Revolution, and that the Ladies' Society, in connection with like societies in every State in the Union, take up the general work as planned in the original Mary Washington Association,' that is now represented by Col. Ball.\" Mrs. James P. Smith was the first President of the Fredericksburg association, and on her resignation, upon removing to another city, Mrs. V. M. Fleming was appointed in her place. These Fredericksburg women, with the efficient aid given them by the Rev. James P. Smith, through purchase, gift and otherwise, obtained possession, not only of Washington's grave, but of the three adjoining lots. Mrs. James H. Thompson, the secretary of the Fredericksburg association, wrote: \"We shall spare no effort to secure an enduring monument as beautiful as art can make. The city of Fredericksburg will make it the center of a public square, with wide avenues of approach, that the American people may come and see that republics are not ungrateful. This will be a monument to a woman erected by women.\"\nA few months later, negotiations between the Fredericksburg and the National Associations were entered into. A deed of the property of the Fredericksburg association was given the National Association conditioned upon the National Association erecting, within a given time, \"a suitable monument to Mary, the mother of Washington,\" and to erect said monument at Fredericksburg upon the spot selected by herself\". In February 1891, all rights of the former were formally ceded to the National Association, including Washington's grave, the three adjoining lots, and US$1,000 toward the monument fund.\n\n\n== New monument and grounds ==\n\nThe old monument was found to be an irreparable ruin, and the National Association hired William J. Crawford as the builder of the new monument.\nThe cornerstone for a new monument was laid on October 21, 1893, and on May 10, 1894, the new monument was dedicated with masonic ceremonies and in the presence of the president of the United States and other distinguished guests.\nIt is an obelisk of Barre granite, 50 feet (15 m) in height, of classic form and proportions. Upon the plinth are the words, \"Mary, the Mother of Washington\"; on the reverse side, \"Erected by her Countrywomen\".\nA lodge was built at the entrance of the grounds and a Fredericksburg woman from a distinguished family was made the custodian. The grounds were enclosed and laid out. Willows from Mount Vernon were planted near the Monument by the last daughter of the George Washington family born at Mount Vernon, who was the First Vice-president of the Mary Washington Association.\n\n\n== Perpetuity ==\nOn May 10, 1894, President Cleveland, the vice-president, and nearly the whole of the Cabinet came to Fredericksburg and honored the unveiling of the new monument. The Virginia State Governor and many Senators and Congressmen from both sides attended as well. The ceremony included Christian prayer, Masonic ritual, and oratories.\nAfter the Association fulfilled its aim to erect a suitable monument at the grave of Mary Washington, it has existed in perpetual care of the ground and monument. It is to be the privilege of future descendants of the present members to care for this historic spot.\nMary Frances Waite was elected president soon after her mother's death.\nThe payment of US$25 by one person at the same time entitled the person so paying to an Hereditary Life Membership in the Association, the certificate of which was a silver medal in the form of a star with the head of Mary, the mother of Washington, in the center, the initials of the Association (N. M. W. M. A.) in blue and white enamel upon the five points on the obverse side, and the Washington Heraldic colors on the reverse side. Those giving US$35 received a gold medal. This Association being organized for perpetuity, these Life Members, and their successors by inheritance, were privileged to aid in caring for the protection and preservation of the grave and monument of the mother of Washington for all future time. These medals are as an inheritance to descend from mother to daughter or granddaughter, and so on in the direct female line, or failing these, by will or deed, and entitle the inheritor to a vote at all meetings of the Association.\nIn March 1894, the secretary of the NMWMA sent out an appeal to the Chapters of the DAR throughout the country, asking for aid in completing their work with the creation of an endowment. On the Board of Lady Managers of the NMWMA, the president, the two vice-presidents, and the secretary were all charter members of the DAR. The Association was desirous of collecting sufficient funds for that purpose before February 22, 1895.\nNo medals were given out after February 22, 1896.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe Building of a Monument was written by Susan Riviere Hetzel, and published in 1903. She was at the time Secretary of the National Association, following her mother Margaret Hetzel, its first Secretary.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Kit (Russian: Кит, lit. 'whale') was the second boat of the Narval class of submarines of the Imperial Russian Navy. The submarine was laid down in December 1911 and launched in May 1915, though it was not completed until October 1915. Built for the Black Sea Fleet, it carried out raids against Ottoman supply convoys along the coast of Anatolia and was responsible for sinking 24 ships, for a total of 1,270 gross register tons (GRT).\nAfter the Russian Revolution, the submarine remained in Sevastopol, where it was first captured by the Germans and then by the British and the White Army in the Russian Civil War. The British scuttled Kit and several other submarines near Sevastopol in April 1919 to prevent the Bolsheviks from acquiring them. Their location was found by the Soviets in 1934 and Kit became the only one of them to be raised, though they decided not to restore the submarine and had it scrapped.\n\n\n== Design and construction ==\nAfter being defeated in the Russo-Japanese War, the Russian Empire began rebuilding its Navy. Initially the main focus of the naval arms programs was on the Baltic and Pacific fleets, but as tensions increased with Austria-Hungary due to the Bosnian crisis in 1908 and with Ottoman Turkey after the expansion of its navy, the Black Sea Fleet was given more attention. The 1911 naval program approved by the State Duma included the order of six submarines for the Black Sea Fleet, which ended up being three Narval-class boats and three Morzh class. The Nevsky Factory in Saint Petersburg developed the Narval class on the basis of a foreign design, the popular Holland type made by the American Holland Torpedo Boat Company. But there was a dispute in the Imperial Russian Navy before 1911 on which submarine type to purchase, the Narval class or the Morzh class that was designed by Ivan Bubnov, the chief submarine engineer of the Baltic Yard. Bubnov was supported by the Naval General Staff, while the foreign type was favored by members of the Naval Technological Committee, who argued that they needed to study foreign technological advancements. In the end, a conference led by Navy Minister Stepan Voevodskiy settled the matter by ordering three submarines of each class. \nThe Narval-class submarines were the most advanced Russian submarines at the time because unlike the rest they had crash-diving tanks for faster diving, internal bulkheads that provided more protection for the crew, and used natural flow to fill the main ballast tanks instead of pumps. A problem that arose during their construction was that the twin 1,140 horsepower (850 kW) diesel engines to power each boat had been ordered from Germany and were not delivered by the time World War I broke out, so they had to be replaced by four American-built engines that each provided 210 horsepower (160 kW). This meant that the designed 16-knot (30 km/h; 18 mph) surface speed could not be attained, and neither could the 12-knot (22 km/h; 14 mph) underwater speed. Kit had slightly different weaponry from the other boats in its class, being equipped with two deck guns, including one 75 mm (3 in) and one 57 mm (2 in), along with four 450 mm (18 in) torpedo tubes and eight Dzhevetskiy torpedo-launching collars. After modifications done in 1917, Kit also received two 7.62 mm machine guns and its artillery was changed for two Japanese 75 mm guns, though its external torpedo-launching collars were reduced to four.\nConstruction of all three Narval-class submarines began in Saint Petersburg, where they were laid down in December 1911, before being transferred to the shipyards in Nikolayev for the final assembly. The engines were not delivered from the United States until January 1915. Kit began its sea trials in the fall of 1915, during which some engine problems were discovered, and it underwent modifications. The submarine was completed and entered service on 27 October [O.S. 14 October] 1915.\n\n\n== Service history ==\n\n\n=== World War I ===\nAt the time when Kit entered service with the Russian Black Sea Fleet, it was focused on disrupting the Ottoman merchant convoys transporting coal from the area of Zonguldak to Constantinople, which was the main source of fuel for the Ottoman Navy. The new submarines that joined the fleet were tasked with patrolling the Anatolian coast and the entrance to the Bosporus. Despite issues with their engines, Kit and the other boats of its class became popular with Russian submarine crews. The three boats became the 2nd Squadron of the Black Sea Submarine Brigade.\nFrom late 1915 until April 1916, Kit was given modifications, this time receiving more advanced communications equipment, and it returned to service by May 1916. In that month, while on patrol, Kit was attacked by a German aircraft on the 12th, though it was able to escape without any damage. The submarine carried out six patrols in the early summer of 1916. During one of these, on 13 June 1916 Kit sank a Turkish schooner that was transporting oil. On 23 October it accompanied several other ships on a mission to lay mines near the Bosporus, and in mid-November the submarine participated in a reconnaissance mission along the Bulgarian coast near Varna. The mission also included the cruiser Pamiat Merkuria, the destroyer Gromky, and several minelayers and minesweepers. Kit assisted the other ships with navigation, but they did not find any minefields there to clear out. On 13 December 1916 the submarine rammed and destroyed a Turkish steamer near the Bosporus, and in January 1917 it sank another seven ships in the same area.\nAfter the February Revolution in 1917, the Black Sea Fleet and its submarines continued to be active as the Russian Provisional Government continued the war, though in the autumn of 1917 all three of the Narval-class boats underwent repairs and were put into the reserve. By the October Revolution, Kit was credited with sinking 24 ships with a total tonnage of 1,270 GRT.\n\n\n=== Russian Civil War ===\n\nAfter the October Revolution, on 9 February 1918 the Central Powers recognized Ukraine's independence and the German Army took control of Crimea by May 1918. The Central Powers wanted to divide up the ships of the Black Sea Fleet among themselves, and they were also claimed by the Ukrainian People's Republic. The crews of some ships raised the Ukrainian flag, including on the Kit. The submarine was then taken by the Germans, and after the end of the war in November 1918 the boat was acquired by the Western Allies and the White Russian forces. The British scuttled all three submarines of the Narval class near Sevastopol on 26 April 1919 to prevent them from being taken by the Bolsheviks.\nBetween 1934 and 1935, the wreckage of the submarines was discovered and Kit was the only one of them to be raised by the Soviets. They decided not to restore it and the boat was sent to be scrapped.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Works ===",

        "content": "Hervey Montmorency Morres (7 March 1767 – 9 May 1839) was an Irish nationalist.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMorres was the eldest son of Matthew Montmorency Morres and Margaret, second daughter of Francis Magan of Emo, co. Westmeath. He was born at Rathailean Castle, County Tipperary, on 7 March 1767. At the age of fifteen he entered the Austrian service. He served as ensign under Field-marshal Lacy against the Turks, distinguishing himself at the siege of Belgrade in 1789, and was transferred with the rank of lieutenant into Count Kavanagh's regiment of cuirassiers. He subsequently served as a volunteer in the army of Prince Hohenlohe against the French republic, and commanded a company of skirmishers at the siege of Thionville. He fought with distinction in the army of the Rhine under Marshal Wurmser in 1793, and was afterwards aide-de-camp to Prince Charles of Fiirstemberg. He quitted the Austrian service in 1795, and, having in September of that year married Louise de Helmstadt at Heidelberg, he returned to Ireland and took up his residence at Knockalton in co. Tipperary. Shortly after his arrival he addressed a memorial to the lord-lieutenant, the Earl of Camden, on the disturbed state of Ireland, advocating the formation of a strong military force, composed impartially of Catholics and Protestants. He was thanked for his suggestions, but informed that they were impracticable.\nOn the rumour of Hoche's expedition in 1796 he accepted a commission as aide-de-camp to General Dundas; but, becoming disgusted at the violent measures of government, he became in November of that year a United Irishman. He was chosen a county representative for Tipperary in May 1797, and nominated colonel of the regiment of Nenagh infantry. In February 1798 he was attached to the general military committee, and soon after appointed adjutant-general of Munster. He was very active in forwarding the organisation of his province, and, subsequent to the arrest of the Leinster Directory on 12 March, he was made a member of the new executive. He avoided an attempt that was made to arrest him on 28 April, and having been assigned the capture of the batteries and magazines in the Phoenix Park, he was busily engaged in working out his plans when the whole scheme of the insurrection was frustrated by the capture of Lord Edward Fitzgerald. Morres managed to escape from Dublin on 4 June, and lay concealed in co. Westmeath till the arrival of Jean Joseph Amable Humbert's expedition on 22 August. Thinking that Humbert would not immediately risk a decisive engagement, he endeavoured to restrain the ardour of the men of Westmeath ; but after the passage of the Shannon, 'taking part in the right flank of Lord Cornwallis's army, with a body of from two to three thousand ill-armed peasants and several chiefs of the union, he made such dispositions as he judged might prove most favourable to the progress of the invading army' (Castlereagh Corresp. ii. 95).\nAfter the capitulation of the French army at Ballinamuck he escaped to Dublin, and thence through England to Hamburg, where he arrived on 7 October. He was cordially welcomed, as an old friend of her husband, by Lady Fitzgerald; but, having been included by name in the Rebel Fugitives Act, he did not feel secure in Hamburg, and applied to the French resident, Marragon, for permission to proceed to France. His apprehensions were not unfounded. His secret correspondence with the French minister was revealed to the English cabinet by Samuel Turner and on 24 November he was arrested, at the instance of the British agent, Sir James Crawford, at the American Arms, together with James Napper Tandy, William Corbet, and James Bartholomew Blackwell. This act was contrary to the law of nations and despite the protests of Marragon. After ten months' close confinement the senate of Hamburg consented to his extradition, and at midnight on 28 September 1799 he was, with his three companions, conveyed on board an English frigate at Cuxhaven. The subserviency of the senate of Hamburg caused universal indignation, and drew down upon them Napoleon's wrath, which was only appeased by the payment of a fine of four millions and a half francs and a public apology. The arrival of Morres and his companions in England caused considerable excitement, but they were shortly afterwards removed for trial to Ireland. The prosecution against Morres and Tandy broke down on a point of law. Morres pleaded that he had been arrested eight days before the time assigned by the act for his voluntary surrender had expired, and, after a long argument, his objection was sustained by Lord Kilwarden. But it was not till 10 December 1801, after more than three years' imprisonment, that he was released on bail. His wife having died at the age of twenty-six, on the very day of his arrest at Hamburg, Morres, after a brief visit to Paris, married, at Dublin, Helen, widow of Dr. John Esmonde, hanged as a traitor in 1798, and daughter of Bartholomew O'Neill-Callan of Osbertstown House, co. Kildare.\nHe continued to reside in Ireland for several years, but about 1811 he was persuaded by the French minister of war, Henri Jacques Guillaume Clarke, himself of Irish descent, to enter the French service. On 19 May 1812 he was appointed adjutant-commandant with the rank of colonel, made a member of the Legion of Honour, and placed on the staff of General Augereau at Lyons. Some futile efforts were made by his family to induce him to return to Ireland, and his offer, after the abdication of Napoleon, to serve under the English flag not meeting with a cordial response from Wellington and Castlereagh, he retained his commission in the French army, and on 3 November 1816 he obtained letters of naturalisation. At the restoration of the monarchy he entered into communication with the head of the family of Montmorency in France with a view to his recognition as a descendant of the Irish branch of the same house. His overtures were not favourably received, and in justification of his claim he compiled an exhaustive genealogical memoir of the family of Montmorency; but, though absolutely conclusive on the point, it failed to remove the objections of the Duc de Montmorency. He continued to reside in Paris, occupied chiefly in literary researches, receiving the half-pay of a staff-colonel till his death, which took place at St. Germain-en-Laye on 9 May 1839. According to Miles Byrne, who knew him personally, 'he was brave and honourable, and much liked by his countrymen in France.' He left children by both his wives. His eldest daughter, Louise, born at Knockalton on 20 September 1795, was for a time maid of honour to Queen Caroline of Bavaria. Three of his sons, Herve, Geoffroy, and Mathieu, became officers in the Austrian service. He was much interested in Irish topography, and was regarded as an authority on the subject.\nHe published:\n\n'Nomenclatura Hibernica,' Dublin, 1810.\n'Reflections on the Veto.'\n'A Historical Inquiry into the Origin and Primitive Use of the Irish Pillar Tower,' London, 1821.\n'A Genealogical Memoir of the Family of Montmorency, styled De Marisco or Morres,' Paris, 1817.\n'Les Montmorency de France et les Montmorency d'Irlande,' Paris, 1825.\nHe assisted in a new edition of Archdall's 'Monasticum Hibernicum,' and in a 'Topographical Dictionary of Ireland,' neither of which apparently was published; and contributed much valuable information to Brewer's 'Beauties of Ireland.'\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Dunlop, Robert (1894). \"Morres, Hervey Montmorency\".

None of the sources provided discuss the subject in question; most focus solely on the demonstration, while a few include unreliable information and a couple do not mention him at all. GSS 💬 14:55, 12 May 2024 (UTC)\n\nPawan Kumar Sharma or Pawan Jury (born 16 August 1975) is an Indian activist opposed to electronic voting machines (EVMs). He has spread information about the alleged vulnerabilities and flaws associated with EVMs, advocating for their replacement with traditional paper ballots. He is also working to enact Right to Recall Law on prime minister post in India.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nSharma was born in Bhilwara, Rajasthan, India. He graduated from Maharishi Dayanand Saraswati University in commerce division.\n\n\n== Activism ==\nSharma's activism gained prominence in 2017 when the Election Commission of India made two significant changes in VVPAT machines:\n\nECI changed VVPAT's glass from transparent to an opaque glass or black glass in which front side is mirror and back side is transparent.\nDuration of light inside VVPAT is decreased from 15 seconds to 7 seconds.\nHe became vocal about what he perceives as the shortcomings of EVMs and their potential to compromise the integrity of the electoral process. In January 2024 Sharma participated in a public demonstration held at Jantar Mantar, New Delhi to protest against use of EVM in which Sharma gave demonstration of his alleged working model of EVM and its video went viral on social media platforms and also shared by various prominent YouTube news channels such as National Dastak, Punya Prasun Bajpai and Ajit Anjum.\n\n\n=== Allegations and concerns ===\nSharma, along with other activists and critics, has raised several concerns regarding the use of EVMs in Indian elections. Some of the key issues highlighted by Sharma include:\n\nLack of Transparency: Sharma has criticized the lack of transparency in the functioning of EVMs and VVPAT, arguing that the opaque glass used in VVPAT make it suspicious and doubt full.\nVulnerability to Manipulation: He has expressed concerns about the susceptibility of EVMs to tampering and hacking, which could potentially undermine the democratic process and lead to electoral fraud.\nAlternatives: Sharma has suggested alternative voting methods, such as paper ballots as more reliable and transparent alternatives to EVMs.\n\n\n=== Significant efforts ===\nSharma has been involved in various efforts aimed at addressing the issues surrounding EVMs. He has organised campaigns calling for electoral reforms and greater scrutiny of the use of EVMs in Indian elections. He also made a non profit organisation named EVM Hatao Sena for demonstration against EVMs.\nSharma also organised demonstration alleged working model of EVM-VVPAT in public at various cities including New Delhi, Mumbai, Jaipur, Varanasi, Lucknow, Bangalore, Indore, Patna,  Kolkata and Odisha in India to give momentum to movement of revoking EVMs in Indian electoral system.\nHis associates and members of EVM Hatao Sena also organised a demonstration of alleged working model in public in Mumbai.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nSharma's activism has garnered both support and criticism from various quarters. Supporters view him as a champion of electoral integrity and transparency. The Indian National Congress uploaded an interview with Sharma on their official YouTube channel. Critics have accused him of spreading misinformation and undermining confidence in the electoral process. Some critics argue that Sharma promotes conspiracy theories and is attempting to de-legitimize electoral outcomes.\n\n\n=== Response from authorities ===\nGovernment authorities and election officials have defended the use of EVMs, citing their efficiency, accuracy, and security features. They have dismissed allegations of tampering and emphasized the safeguards in place to prevent manipulation of the voting machines. Election Commission Gujarat tweeted about EVM Hatao Sena demonstration at Mumbai press club and called it as fake. The Election Commission of India tweeted about Sharma's demonstration at Press Club of India, saying that the EVM used in that demonstration was not an original EVM that is used by ECI in election.\n\n\n== See also ==\nElectronic Voting in India\nElectoral Reform in India\nVoting Systems\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The United Evangelical Church of the Polish People's Republic was a religious organization existing from 1947 to 1988, comprising five Polish Protestant communities characterized by evangelical piety and the practice of baptizing only those who were conscious of their faith. Two of them had a Pentecostal character. During the Polish People's Republic period, it was the largest evangelical church in Poland – the second largest denomination of this profile at the time was the Baptist Christian Church of the Republic of Poland. Since 1967, the church's headquarters had been located at Zagórna Street in Warsaw. Until 1953, the church was a federation, within which each group retained its distinctiveness; in 1953, these distinctions were abolished. In 1981, the United Evangelical Church returned to a federative structure.\nThe first post-war unification initiatives among evangelical Christians in Poland emerged as early as 1945 when the Baptist Christian Church of the Republic of Poland was founded, bringing together various strands, but within the next two years, all groups withdrew from it, leaving only the Baptists. Soon after, a new unification initiative emerged, resulting in the establishment of the United Evangelical Church in 1947. Initially, three churches belonged to it, and from 1953, five. In 1956, some of the former Union of Evangelical Christians' congregations attempted to leave the United Evangelical Church and appealed to the authorities to legalize their association. The authorities responded with repression, and the congregations were forced to return to the United Evangelical Church. The \"Lublin group\" resisted the longest, until the late 1960s. Until 1975, Free Christians (Plymouth Brethren) dominated, and from 1981, Pentecostals. The change in the political situation after 1980 allowed the individual confessions to become subjects within one church. In 1981, a group of Free Christians left, forming a separate religious association called the Church of Free Christians of the Polish People's Republic. From then on, the United Evangelical Church encompassed four communities. In 1987, at the church's last synod, it was decided to dissolve the United Evangelical Church. Towards the end of its existence, it exceeded 17,000 believers, with the largest numerical growth occurring in the 1980s. As a result of its dissolution, four separate churches were formed: the Church of Christians of the Evangelical Faith in the Republic of Poland, the Church of Evangelical Christians, the Church of Christ Congregations, and the Pentecostal Church in Poland.\nThe basic unit in the United Evangelical Church was an autonomous congregation with legal personality. The congregation had the right to decide on the admission or exclusion of its own members. Among the Church's major achievements were the construction of a central chapel in Warsaw, the establishment of a Home for the Elderly in Ostróda, and publishing activities, including the publication of the monthly magazine Chrześcijanin. The United Evangelical Church was a member of the Polish Ecumenical Council.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== First unification initiatives ===\n\nIn the Evangelical-Baptist communities in Polish territories, the first unification idea emerged after the end of the Polish-Bolshevik War and concerned the Union of Slavic Baptist Congregations and the Union of Evangelical Christians. In 1923, the Evangelical Christian and Baptist Union in Poland was established in Brest, but after two years, due to different attitudes towards military service, the Baptists decided to pursue independent activities.\nThe unification ideas resurfaced during World War II and were relevant immediately after its end. The biblical motto that they may all be one (John 17:21) was often cited. A significant obstacle to realizing this idea was the ambitions of leaders of individual groups.\nAfter World War II, the first unification initiative came from the Baptists, at that time the largest Evangelical group in Poland. As a result, in May 1945, a religious union was formed, bringing together several Evangelical groups with similar doctrines under the name Polish Church of Christian Baptists. Pentecostals did not join this church. The union was recognized by the state authorities in May 1946. Already in January 1946 (before its legal situation was regulated), a group of Evangelical Christians led by Ludwik Szenderowski withdrew from it, and in November 1946, the Church Union of Christ with Jerzy Sacewicz as president also withdrew. Konstanty Jaroszewicz, who visited Poland in 1946, contributed to the separation of the Christ group, encouraged the leaders of the Church of Christ to break away from the Baptist Christian Church and promised them financial assistance. The Free Christians withdrew in June 1947. The decision to withdraw was influenced, among other things, by a personal conflict between Free Christian Józef Mrózek and Baptist Emil Jeske. Each of them wanted to be the leader for the Silesian region. Mrózek convened a conference for Free Christians in Chorzów, where the decision to withdraw from the Polish Church of Evangelical Christian Baptists was made. Only the Baptists remained in the union, retaining their legalization and name. Soon after, the term \"Evangelical\" was removed from the name, thus creating the name Polish Church of Christian Baptists. Another reason for the dissolution of this church was the numerical dominance of the Baptists. The number of Baptists at that time was about 2,000 members, while the remaining groups had a total of 1,500 members.\nStill, during the existence of the Polish Church of Evangelical Christian Baptists, a competing unification initiative emerged. In November 1946, a conference of five Evangelical communities was held in Ustroń. The Baptists did not participate. On 16 February 1947, the Temporary Committee of the Union of Evangelical Churches in Poland was established. It included the Union of Evangelical Christians, the Union of Evangelical Faith Christians, the Church Union of Christ, the Free Christian Union (still part of the Polish Church of Evangelical Christian Baptists), and the Union of Steadfast Christians. Stanisław Krakiewicz became its president. Shortly thereafter, the Church Union and the Evangelical Faith Union withdrew from the committee's work.\nFrom 24 to 26 May 1947, Krakiewicz and Szenderowski organized the \"Brotherly Conference\" in Ustroń. The Baptists were invited to the conference several times but declined, as did the Church Union of Christ and the Evangelical Faith Union due to negative experiences with the previous cooperation with the union. As a result, a federation of only three unions was formed under the name United Evangelical Church. On 23 June 1947, at the last meeting of the Polish Church of Evangelical Christian Baptists, Krakiewicz informed the Baptists about the establishment of the new church and the withdrawal of Free Christians from the Polish Church of Evangelical Christian Baptists. He shifted the responsibility for creating the new church onto his \"brothers\". Krakiewicz served as secretary in the Polish Church of Evangelical Christian Baptists and became president in the United Evangelical Church.\nObtaining legalization became a top priority for the newly established church. On 15 October 1947, the statutes of the United Evangelical Church were submitted to the authorities. The Ministry of Public Security ordered changes to certain provisions of the statute concerning cooperation with foreign religious communities. Despite making amendments and submitting the necessary documents in September 1948, the legalization process was not completed until July 1959. Shortly after the establishment of the United Evangelical Church, it joined the Polish Ecumenical Council. Membership in the council was understood as cooperation \"in administrative terms\" rather than \"spiritual or doctrinal\".\n\n\n=== Arrests of clergymen ===\n\nDespite the fact that the unification idea was supported by the state authorities, the church was denied legalization, and its activists were persecuted. Already at the turn of 1947 and 1948, information about the church's activists began to be collected. On the night of 19 to 20 September 1950, the church leaders were arrested by the Security Office, and all the religious facilities belonging to the church were closed. As a result of this action, 199 people from Evangelical-Baptist Churches (i.e., United Evangelical Church, Church of Christians of the Evangelical Faith, and Church Union of Christ) were arrested. Not only church clergy but also particularly active believers were arrested. Some chapels, literature, hymnals, and church equipment were confiscated. The majority of the property confiscated as a result of this action never returned to its owners.\nThe activists of these \"sects\" were alleged to have established contacts \"with their operational centers in the USA and Sweden\" and were portrayed as \"spies of Anglo-American imperialism\". They were accused of conducting a broad anti-Soviet campaign, criticizing the people's power and agricultural cooperatives. Two individuals most involved in this action were pointed out – Władysław Kołodziej and Teodor Maksymowicz. The Security Office intended to prepare a show trial. Despite the use of torture in prisons and intimidation, the clergy did not confess to the charges against them.\nMost of the arrested were released after several days or weeks of detention, some were released after several months, while \"evidence\" was gathered against others. Everyone signed a statement of no claims against the Security Office before leaving custody. Sixteen people were sentenced to prison. Stanisław Krakiewicz was detained on charges of conducting \"intelligence work\" and sentenced for \"anti-state activity\". Ludwik Szenderowski was sentenced to 9 years in prison due to extensive contacts with fellow believers from the United States. This temporarily halted the church's activities for several months. In the spring of 1951, religious life began to return to the repressed \"sects\". Szenderowski was the last to be released, being pardoned in 1955.\nThe authorities assumed that the arrests would weaken, or perhaps even lead to the elimination of Evangelical Christianity in Poland.\n\n\n=== Five organizations in one ===\n\nIn 1952, the state authorities, inspired by Soviet solutions, recognized that the increase in the number of religious organizations that were not materially different was an undesirable phenomenon. It was decided to merge related factions for easier supervision and to detach them from American support. As a result of pressure from the authorities, consultative conferences were held in 1952 and 1953 aimed at incorporating two further religious unions into the United Evangelical Church: the Union of Christ Churches and the Union of Evangelical Christian Faith. This occurred at the First Synod of the United Evangelical Church on 4 June 1953. At this synod, the church council and the council's presidency with President Stanisław Krakiewicz were elected. It was acknowledged that the federative system was ineffective, and the unions within the United Evangelical Church were dissolved. A statute was adopted, according to which the decisions of synods were binding on everyone. Henceforth, activities were conducted in a new organizational form, and the United Evangelical Church no longer had a federative character.\nThe authorities assumed that it would be easier to control a single religious union than each separately. They also wanted the activities of the congregations in the field to take place in permanent locations, intended to eliminate \"communalism\" practiced by the unaffiliated, and aimed to incorporate all unregistered \"evangelical believers\" into the United Evangelical Church. Over time, the authorities gained another advantage. The factions within the United Evangelical Church had a similar doctrine but differed in some points. As a result, a \"fighting within\" church emerged, and the coexistence of these denominations within one body often led to disputes. The authorities also wanted to \"incorporate the Baptist Church, whose leadership still leaned towards Baptist centers abroad\", into the United Evangelical Church.\nIn late 1954, the Church Council made efforts to establish closer cooperation with the Polish Baptist Christian Church. Joint meetings were proposed. The Supreme Council of the Polish Baptist Christian Church supported the idea of cooperation but emphasized that the past should be clarified first, as they remained faithful to the agreements jointly adopted at the synod of the common church in 1945. It is possible that this initiative from the United Evangelical Church was inspired by the Office for Religious Affairs, which supported the idea of merging all Evangelical churches. However, the change in the political situation meant that these plans were never realized. In 1968, the authorities apparently abandoned the idea of merging the Polish Baptist Christian Church and the United Evangelical Church, as they approved a statute for the former.\nIn 1956, Pentecostals from the former Church of Christians of the Evangelical Faith organized three conferences independent of the United Evangelical Church, planned their own activities for their faction, and sought foreign financial support. The point of contention turned out to be the election of candidates for the Church Council. Pentecostals from the Evangelical Christian Faith faction obtained 11 out of 30 mandates. The incumbent Church Council invalidated the results of these elections. In response, Pentecostals decided to withdraw from the United Evangelical Church, and an application was submitted to the Office for Religious Affairs for the registration of the Church of Evangelical Christian Faith. Teodor Maksymowicz was elected president. The authorities prohibited the separatists from conducting activities outside the United Evangelical Church and from holding clerical positions. The most severe method of combating the separatists turned out to be the issue of using their own chapels. By 1961, most congregations had returned to the United Evangelical Church. Outside the church remained congregations in the Lublin Voivodeship (the so-called \"Lublin group\"), resisting state authorities until the late 1960s. Kazimierz Czepieluk (1905–1969) acted outside the United Evangelical Church until the end of his life. Walenty Dawidow founded the Christ Church in Poland. Independently, Bolesław Dawidow, the founder of the future Church of God in Christ, operated.\nUnder the conditions of support for the United Evangelical Church and the suppression of separatists, the Office for Religious Affairs decided to approve the United Evangelical Church Statute. The church statute was adopted at the synod in 1959, and on 31 July 1959, it was approved by the Office for Religious Affairs (decision no. III. 11/10/59). Thus, the registration of the United Evangelical Church was completed. The statute defined the Church as \"autonomous and independent of any spiritual or secular authority\". The executive body was the Church Council, and the supervisory body was the Supervisory Commission. The basic unit was the congregation, which according to the statute was autonomous and had legal personality; its members could be converted and baptized individuals. The congregation had the right to exclude any person leading a lifestyle inconsistent with biblical standards.\n\n\n=== Foreign contacts ===\n\nIn 1955, the authorities allowed the resumption of foreign contacts, although they still perceived them as an attempt to subordinate to foreign church centers. Pentecostals were primarily interested in maintaining contacts. After the detachment of the \"separatists\" in 1956 who remained within the structures of the United Evangelical Church, the authorities treated them as loyal citizens of the Polish People's Republic. Travel abroad was made difficult for the \"separatists\", while for clergy remaining in the United Evangelical Church, the Ministry of Internal Affairs even expedited formalities.\nAfter the 1968 Polish political crisis, the surveillance of the United Evangelical Church clergy by the security service intensified. The main reason for this was the numerous visits by fellow believers from abroad. Concerned that guests were speaking in congregations, teaching at youth courses, gatherings, and camps, the authorities decided to restrict visits to Poland for foreign guests. The United Evangelical Church Presidium implemented the authorities' recommendations regarding guests. Congregants were instructed to report on every foreigner attending services. During this period, representatives of the Pentecostal movement from the US and Western Europe showed great activity. They eagerly participated in services and vividly described the persecution of Pentecostals upon their return to their countries, both by communist authorities and by the United Evangelical Church Presidium. The matter seemed serious enough to the authorities that on 11 December 1970, a meeting was held between the Church Presidium and representatives of the Office for Religious Affairs. During the meeting, Tadeusz Dusik, the director for non-Catholic religious affairs, accused: Foreign centers are increasingly actively working to transform the United Evangelical Church into their outpost in the territory of the Polish People's Republic.\nThose clergy who maintained foreign contacts were suspected. However, the actions of the state authorities in this regard were not consistent, and often visits by those whose activities were previously perceived as leading to separatism within the United Evangelical Church were permitted.\nPressure from the authorities gradually diminished, and during times of economic difficulty, guests were eagerly invited. In the second half of the 1970s, the authorities began to favor numerous visits by Protestants from the West to Poland. In 1984, permission was granted to organize a youth convention in Warsaw, which was attended by over a thousand people. The main speaker was a foreign guest. The following year, approximately 4,000 people attended another convention. In 1985, the situation further relaxed. Political and religious authorities were less interested in the relatively small religious association.\n\n\n=== Headquarters ===\n\nAlready in 1957, the United Evangelical Church Council Presidium appealed to the authorities for the location and permission to build a religious facility. The Office for Religious Affairs supported the idea of constructing the \"United Evangelical Church Central\". Initially, the Chief Architect of Warsaw was asked if there was a possibility of developing the courtyard at 114 Puławska Street. Subsequently, a plot at 25 Waliców Street was allocated, which the United Evangelical Church did not utilize due to a lack of funds, so it was taken over by the Baptists. On 25 January 1962, a plot of land at 10 Zagórna Street was awarded. It was decided to construct a three-story building with a volume of 6,000 m3. Appeals for financial support were made to congregations and also to \"brothers\" from abroad. One of the benefactors was Oral Roberts, who donated $1,200.\nThe facility was built between 1965 and 1970, consisting of office spaces and two chapels. In the first stage, from June 1965 to the fall of 1967, the administrative building was erected, which was put into use on 10 December 1967, and became the residence of the Church's Presidium. The church's secretariat, the editorial office of Chrześcijanin, the United Evangelical Church publishing house, and the Głos Ewangelii radio were all housed here. In the second stage, from May 1968 to the spring of 1970, a chapel for the central congregation was built. The grand opening took place on 1 May 1970. During the opening, President Krakiewicz outlined the history of the United Evangelical Church, focusing on its achievements. He informed those gathered that in 1947, the United Evangelical Church had 30 congregations, in 1953 – 70 congregations, and by May 1970, it had grown to 96 congregations and over 100 branches, with a total of 8,000 followers.\n\n\n=== President Krakiewicz ===\n\nPresident Krakiewicz repeatedly violated the existing statute of the United Evangelical Church. Under his leadership, the elections for the Presidium in 1965 and 1968 were conducted in a manner inconsistent with the prevailing law. Similarly, on18 and 19 February 1972, during the Church Council meeting, Krakiewicz and his secretary presented their own proposal to dismiss the current regional presbyters and appoint new ones. The purpose of these changes was to prevent representatives of the Pentecostal churches from participating.\nFor the Department of Religious Affairs, these changes were justified by \"higher necessity\", and there were no courageous individuals within the church to oppose them. Krakiewicz also allowed himself a degree of autonomy regarding religious authorities, no longer informing them of the affiliation of each candidate but presenting them in alphabetical order instead. He interfered in the internal affairs of individual factions. In the autumn of 1970, he refused to authorize a fraternal meeting in Koszalin, where foreign guests were expected to attend (despite the ban, the meeting still took place). At subsequent synods of the church, he consistently stated that \"he would accept the position of President of the Council if the Brethren entrusted him with this mandate\". However, there was no opposition that could threaten his influence, and the elections to the Presidium were coordinated with the authorities (in 1971, the candidacy of Kazimierz Muranty for secretary had the support of the authorities).\nOver time, there was growing resistance to Krakiewicz's actions. In January 1975, representatives of all factions held consultative meetings aimed at eliminating Krakiewicz from the council's Presidium on charges of unchristian behavior. Only representatives of the Free Christians opposed this, to which Krakiewicz belonged. It was agreed that Konstanty Sacewicz would be elected president at the VIII Synod of the United Evangelical Church. Stanisław Krakiewicz sought help from religious authorities, assuring them of his loyalty and patriotism. At the same time, he criticized some United Evangelical Church activists, especially the Pentecostals, accusing them of being \"insubordinate, linked to the West, unpatriotic\", and calling them \"untrue Poles\". However, religious and political authorities believed that the president should be changed, considering Krakiewicz's position too weak and his personality too conflict-ridden. Krakiewicz was then 83 years old, so perhaps it was believed that he had served his purpose.\nAt the VIII Synod, a new president was elected, who declared himself a proponent of equal rights for all factions. Along with Krakiewicz, all regional leaders were also dismissed. Krakiewicz's departure marked the end of a stage in the United Evangelical Church's activities that had been characterized by significant compliance with the authorities.\n\n\n=== More freedom ===\nPresident Sacewicz adhered to the church's statute and served for two terms. The balance of power within the United Evangelical Church shifted to the disadvantage of the Free Christian faction. Until 1975, they managed all church agendas, but now other factions also had their representatives in church matters. The Free Christians claimed they were discriminated against and sought the church's reorganization.\nStarting from 1975, the authorities' attitude towards the United Evangelical Church became more reconciliatory. Since its establishment, the authorities ensured that any emerging separatism within it was swiftly eliminated. Maintaining organizational coherence within the United Evangelical Church became increasingly complicated over time. In October 1974, the United Evangelical Church Council first applied to the Department of Religious Affairs for permission to register a second congregation in Szczecin. After a year, the provincial authorities in Szczecin reversed their previous negative decision. Another concession occurred in Sosnowiec. In July 1974, the provincial authorities in Katowice refused to register a branch of the Katowice congregation in Sosnowiec to \"prevent the fragmentation of the United Evangelical Church\". President Sacewicz's efforts led to a change in the decision. However, when the church wanted to purchase a building for a new congregation, the authorities refused to allow the building to become the property of the Sosnowiec congregation but rather insisted it belong to the United Evangelical Church as a whole. This was a new way for the authorities to ensure the unity of the United Evangelical Church. The same procedure applied when the United Evangelical Church Council requested permission to acquire property in Janowice Wielkie for the congregation in Legnica; the Department of Religious Affairs decided that the property should belong to the church, not the congregation. Henceforth, all donations to the church were subject to the same procedure.\n\n\n=== From 1981 to 1987 ===\n\nThe \"unchristian attitude\" of Krakiewicz resulted in the reluctance of other factions towards the Free Christians. The removal of Krakiewicz, their representative, and the unresolved issue in the First Warsaw Congregation were reasons for growing dissatisfaction among the Free Christians. Initially, they conducted exploratory discussions with the Polish Baptist Christian Church about the possibility of accession. The United Evangelical Church Presidium reprimanded the participants of this meeting. In response, the Free Christians accused the Church's Presidium of an ongoing \"takeover action of congregations by the Pentecostal movement\", citing examples of \"taken over\" or marginalized congregations. They demanded greater freedom for individual factions, disliked the dictates of the Presidium, and called for the church's reorganization. Since the conditions set were not met, on 30 December 1980, a letter was sent to the Department of Religious Affairs requesting registration. The Free Christians Church was registered on 14 May 1981. The Organizational Committee of the Free Christians Church presented a list of 21 congregations to the authorities, but two congregations – in Bierdziej and Wodzisław Śląski – broke away and remained within the United Evangelical Church structures. As a result, there were 19 congregations. The registration of the Free Christians Church marked a departure from the authorities' previous policy towards Evangelical-Baptist communities. Shortly thereafter, other evangelical groups were also registered. As of 31 December 1980, the United Evangelical Church had 124 congregations, 120 branches, and 10,070 believers.\n\nOn 28 November 1981, at the X United Evangelical Church Synod, Jan Guńka, on behalf of the Union of Steadfast Christians, submitted a motion for the complete independence of all denominations. During the vote, 83 delegates spoke in favor of independence, 89 for remaining in the United Evangelical Church, 1 vote was invalid, and 7 delegates abstained. Edward Czajko was elected President of the Church Council and served in this capacity until 1988. After the departure of the Free Christians, the Pentecostals played a leading role in the United Evangelical Church, as they had the majority and could almost pass anything at the synod.\nThe United Evangelical Church adopted a new statute and reorganized itself. According to the new statute, the church was a federation of factions. New terminology was introduced, such as \"pastor\", instead of the previous \"superior\". From 1981 to 1984, there was intensive development of church construction. Several chapels were completed in Sobótka, Kraków, Lwówek Śląski, Hajnówka, and construction continued in Ustroń, Poznań, Świnoujście, Gubin, with new construction starting in Lublin, Wrocław, Warsaw, Łódź, Bielsko Podlaskie, Poznań, Bydgoszcz, Włocławek, Stargard. New places of worship were obtained, and many chapels were renovated. There was also an unnoticed increase in the number of church followers.\nAt the XI Synod, J. Tomczyk submitted a proposal for the United Evangelical Church to withdraw from the Polish Ecumenical Council. Czajko appealed for restraint and for dealing with the matter \"in accordance with the wisdom of God\". Antoni Pliński proposed that the Church Council send surveys to the congregations to obtain opinions on Polish Ecumenical Council membership. Czajko supported Pliński's proposal and suggested refraining from making resolutions on the matter. Tomczyk withdrew his proposal.\nThe cooperation between individual groups continued to be less than ideal, and it was a turbulent period in Polish history, further influencing the strengthening of emancipatory processes within the church. Another factor contributing to the disintegration of the United Evangelical Church was the decades-long dream of establishing a church with exclusively Pentecostal characteristics.\nOn 13 September 1986, during a meeting of the Church Council, Michał Hydzik presented a proposal for the \"reorganization\" of the church towards the independence of individual groups. The proposal was accepted in December at the next council meeting, and the resolution was to be adopted by the upcoming synod. On 22 May 1987, the 12th Synod of the United Evangelical Church passed a resolution on the independence of individual denominations. The Steadfast Christians and the Christians of Evangelical Faith decided to form one church, namely the Pentecostal Church, hence the consideration of selecting three, not four churches:\n\nEvangelical Christian Church\nChrist's Church\nPentecostal Church\nThe proposal was supported by 214 delegates, opposed by 52, with 1 invalid vote. This was above the ⅔ of votes required by the statute. The deliberations of the XII Synod marked the end of the 40-year existence of the United Evangelical Church. Another resolution was the extension of the Church Council and its Presidium until the legalization of the newly established churches.\nImmediately after the conclusion of the XII Synod, efforts began to register the new churches. The reorganization envisaged three independent churches. Additionally, Władysław Rudkowski from Lublin decided to establish a separate, fourth community together with the congregations of the Lublin Voivodeship – the Church of Christians of Evangelical Faith.\nIn 1983, the Poltel Television Film Studio produced a documentary film about the United Evangelical Church titled In the Name of the Holy Spirit. The United Evangelical Church (41 minutes) directed by Mieczysław Siemieński and Maciej Leszczyński, based on a script by Edward Czajko, who served as the substantive consultant for the film.\n\n\n== Statistics ==\nSource:\n\nThe largest congregations – data for the year 1985 – were located in the Voivodeships of Bielsko (1,686 followers), Warsaw (1,562), Katowice (1,516), and Szczecin (1,194). As a result of the dissolution of the United Evangelical Church, four churches were established, some of which, however, exited the United Evangelical Church earlier, while others emerged after the dissolution. The development of the churches and denominations that emerged from the United Evangelical Church is illustrated in the table below:\n\nAccording to Zbigniew Pasek's assessment, the breakup of the United Evangelical Church has contributed to the statistical expansion of the evangelical community.\n\n\n== Main doctrinal principles ==\nThe main elements of doctrine were contained in the statute of the United Evangelical Church, adopted in 1953. The following principles of faith were outlined in it:\n\nThe infallibility of the Bible\nFaith in the Trinity\nThe divine Son of God, Jesus Christ, conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary\nThe crucifixion of Jesus and His resurrection\nThe Ascension of Jesus Christ and His Second Coming\nBaptism with the Holy Spirit\nEternal life and eternal damnation\nFrom the confession of these principles of faith arises the requirement to fulfill four religious conditions:\n\nRepentance\nRepentance for sins\nRebirth in Jesus Christ\nAcknowledgment that the love of God and neighbor is the basis of Christian life\nThe statute from 1947 did not contain a point about baptism with the Holy Spirit. An unwritten internal agreement stipulated that no differences regarding the interpretation of this baptism should be raised. During joint services, Pentecostals were to avoid manifesting glossolalia, except in situations where the entire congregation consisted of Pentecostals. Despite these agreements, tensions around this issue always existed, and generational turnover influenced the strengthening of the Pentecostal element in the congregations.\nMembers of the United Evangelical Church called themselves Evangelical Christians. Baptism was performed in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit by immersion, understood as a command of the Lord and an act required of every Evangelical Christian, as well as a testimony and pledge of lifelong fidelity to God. Baptism was not treated as a condition for salvation.\n\n\n== Structure and main activists ==\n\n\n=== Structure ===\n\nThe basic unit in the United Evangelical Church was the congregation, which enjoyed broad autonomy and had legal personality. A congregation had to consist of at least 15 people; smaller groups of believers could organize themselves into branches subordinate to one of the nearest congregations. The congregation had the right to decide on the admission or exclusion of its own members. The authority over the congregation was exercised by the assembly of all members (known as the \"membership\"), the Church Council, the congregation's leader (since 1985 – pastor), and the Audit Committee. It was the responsibility of the congregation's leader to care for the congregation's development, conduct services, or delegate their conduct to their assistants.\nRegional presbyters oversaw the congregations.\nThe highest authority of the church was the synod, composed of delegates from the congregations. The synod reflected the confessional diversity of the various denominations within the United Evangelical Church. Similarly, the executive body, the Church Council, exhibited the denominational diversity within it, with the Presidium of the Church Council.\nUntil 1953, the church was a federation, within which each denomination retained its distinctiveness; this distinctiveness was abolished in 1953. Since 1981, the United Evangelical Church has returned to a federative structure.\nSince 1967, the church's headquarters have been located at Zagórna Street in Warsaw.\n\n\n=== Presidents ===\n1947–1949 – Stanisław Krakiewicz\n1949–1950 – Franciszek Więckiewicz\n1950–1953 – Karol Śniegoń\n1953–1975 – Stanisław Krakiewicz\n1975–1981 – Konstanty Sacewicz\n1981–1988 – Edward Czajko\n\n\n=== Members of the Presidium ===\n1953–1956 – vice presidents: Paweł Bajeński, Józef Czerski, Karol Śniegoń, Franciszek Więckiewicz; secretary: Walenty Dawidow; treasurer: Franciszek Januszewicz\n1956–1959 – vice presidents: Paweł Bajeński, Michalski, Karol Śniegoń, Sergiusz Waszkiewicz; secretary: Zdzisław Repsz; treasurer: Teodor Maksymowicz\n1959–1962 – vice presidents: Paweł Bajeński, Michalski, Karol Śniegoń, Franciszek Waszkiewicz; secretary: Józef Mrózek; treasurer: Teodor Maksymowicz\n1962–1965 – vice presidents: Aleksander Kuc, Konstanty Sacewicz, Karol Śniegoń; secretary: Rapanowicz; treasurer: Teodor Maksymowicz\n1965–1968 – vice presidents: Aleksander Kuc, Konstanty Sacewicz, Karol Śniegoń, Franciszek Waszkiewicz; secretary: Rapanowicz; treasurer: Teodor Maksymowicz; vice secretary: Edward Czajko\n1968–1971 – vice presidents: Józef Mrózek, Aleksander Kuc, Konstanty Sacewicz, Karol Śniegoń, Franciszek Waszkiewicz; secretary: Edward Czajko; treasurer: Rapanowicz; deputy member: Teodor Maksymowicz\n1971–1975 – vice presidents: Józef Mrózek, Kominek, Aleksander Kuc (died 1973), Konstanty Sacewicz, Franciszek Waszkiewicz; secretary: Kazimierz Muranty; treasurer: Teodor Maksymowicz\n1975–1978 – vice presidents: Teodor Maksymowicz, Józef Folwarczny, Kazimierz Najmałowski (died 1978), Kominek; secretary: Kazimierz Muranty; treasurer: Edward Czajko\n1978–1981 – vice presidents: Antoni Pliński, Folwarczny, Marian Suski, Jan Guńka; secretary: Kazimierz Muranty; treasurer: Edward Czajko\n1981–1984 – vice president: Marian Suski; secretary: Henryk Tomaszewski; treasurer: Siczek; members: Gaweł, Jan Guńka, Jakoniuk, Tadeusz Jarosz\n1984–1987 – vice president: Edward Lorek; secretary: Henryk Tomaszewski; members: Gaweł, Michał Hydzik, Antoni Pliński, Konstanty Sacewicz\n\n\n== Activities ==\n\n\n=== Cult life ===\nThe United Evangelical Church, as a community bringing together representatives of several Evangelical movements, was a forum where various types of piety were expressed. The spirituality of the Pentecostals and the Brethren had the greatest spiritual distance between them. However, they shared distinct common elements, which were reflected in the public worship practiced in the congregations. The key elements of this worship were as follows:\n\nSunday worship\nMidweek worship (usually on Wednesdays)\nAd hoc Evangelistic services (traditionally in autumn and spring)\nOutdoor baptismal services (in cases where the congregation did not have a baptistery in the church building)\nWedding ceremonies\nFunerals\nSunday worship, as the main form of congregational worship, consisted primarily of the reading and proclamation of the Bible, prayers led by those conducting the service, communal prayer, church singing, and the sharing of testimonies (accounts by believers of God's work in their lives). This service also included the celebration of the Lord's Supper (usually once a month, often on the first Sunday of the month), the blessing of children, and the ordination of clergy. Musical accompaniment typically involved the use of musical instruments, including percussion and wind instruments. Many congregations had their own choirs actively participating in the main service.\nMidweek worship usually had a simpler format and setting. The main elements included the reading and proclamation of the Bible, prayer (both individual and communal), and singing (often a capella).\nThe foundation of church singing was the hymnal published by the United Evangelical Church called Śpiewnik pielgrzyma.\nAnother specific aspect of Christian worship were the Sunday schools existing in congregations and regularly organized youth meetings.\n\n\n=== Educational activities ===\nIn 1948, the first Bible school of the church was established at 13 Poznańska Street. The first course began on 21 November 1948, and lasted until April 1949. Józef Mrózek Junior served as the director. Two residential courses were held. The school's development was interrupted by the arrests of clergy in 1950, and later there were no local facilities available. The continuation of the school depended solely on Mrózek in the Presidium of the Church. In the 1960s, only short courses lasting one or several weeks took place. The resumption of activities occurred only in 1972. Mieczysław Kwiecień was appointed as the director. In 1985, the name of the Bible School was changed to Theological Seminary. Włodzimierz Rudnicki became the school's headmaster in 1982.\n\n\n=== Publishing activities ===\n\nIn 1954, the authorities allowed the publication of the Biuletyn Zjednoczonego Kościoła Ewangelicznego (English: Bulletin of the United Evangelical Church). The decision to establish the publishing house was made at a meeting of the Church Council on 9 and 10 February 1957. A publishing fund was established, and Józef Prower and Bolesław Winnik began publishing activities. By the end of March 1972, 34 titles with a total circulation of 204,040 copies of books, brochures, and tracts had been printed. Eight books and scripts with a total circulation of 13,700 copies were printed using a duplicator. According to data from the Kalendarz Chrześcijanina 1977, by February 1976, 65 titles with a total circulation of 326,740 books, brochures, and tracts had been printed.\nIn 1975, Kazimierz Muranty took over the publishing house. From 1982, matters related to publishing were decided by the Church Council and the Presidium of the council. Since 1982, the United Evangelical Church received a large allocation of paper from the Book Department of the Ministry of Culture and Art. From 1983 to 1987, more paper was donated by fellow believers from the West. As a result, during those years, many titles were published annually, with a total circulation exceeding 100,000 copies.\n\n\n=== Magazine of the United Evangelical Church ===\nThe monthly magazine Chrześcijanin was published from 1946 to 1948, after which, following a several-year hiatus, it was resumed in 1957 with a circulation of 5,000 copies. In the 1960s, the state authorities reduced the circulation, but in the 1970s, it was increased to 5,500 copies. In the 1980s, it was published with a circulation of 7,000. Until the end of 1988, the magazine was published as part of the United Evangelical Church. From 1989 onwards, it began to be published as the publication of the Pentecostal Church.\n\n\n=== Radio and film activities ===\nFrom December 1965, the church began broadcasting radio programs titled Głos Ewangelii z Warszawy (Eglish: The Voice of the Gospel from Warsaw) through Trans World Radio in Monte Carlo. Stanisław Napiórkowski positively assessed them, stating that Catholics listen to these broadcasts with spiritual benefit. Starting from 4 April 1982, radio services began to be broadcast by Polish Radio. Usually, they were aired four times a year.\nOn 5 February 1985, the United Evangelical Church approached the Studio of Film Adaptations in Warsaw to prepare a Polish version of the film Cross and the Switchblade. The Office for Religious Affairs supported the positive handling of the matter.\n\n\n=== Care activities ===\nThe United Evangelical Church owned a Nursing Home in Ostróda. In the mid-1980s, the church began efforts to establish centers for people struggling with addiction. In 1986, a center for drug addicts was established in Broczyna.\n\n\n== Religious authorities' policy towards the United Evangelical Church ==\nInformers were recruited in 1949. They were needed to report on individuals with foreign contacts. Based on informers' reports, arrests were made in September 1950. Initially, the religious authorities planned to liquidate Evangelical churches in Poland, but when this proved impossible, they aimed to control them. The goal was to have key positions in the church filled by secret collaborators. In the 1970s, the biggest problem for the authorities was the smuggling of Russian and Ukrainian religious literature from the West through Poland to the Soviet Union. Particularly active in this field were Pentecostals. The Security Service monitored the church to prevent this influx. With the involvement of the provincial commands of the militia) and border guards, individuals involved in the smuggling of literature were monitored in Szczecin, Koszalin, Gorzów Wielkopolski, Olsztyn, Białystok, Słupsk, and Gdańsk.\nIn the plans of the IV Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs for the years 1972/1973 and 1974/1975, it was complained that the United Evangelical Church was insufficiently infiltrated, and orders were given to recruit secret collaborators. In the plans for 1976 and 1977, it was ordered to recruit Edward Czajko, a member of the Presidium of the United Evangelical Church, and two people involved in the Voice of the Gospel broadcasts. Active control was ordered over Rapanowicz, Mańkowski, Waszkiewicz, Rudkowski, Rudnicki, Fochman, Ilczuk, Prower, and Gaweł. It was ordered to expose individuals maintaining contacts with the West and engaged in distributing literature to the Soviet Union.\nIn the plans for 1978 and 1979, it was ordered to recruit two secret collaborators from the leadership of the United Evangelical Church, to strive for the placement of secret collaborators \"Marian\" and \"Stanisław\" in the senior management, and to ensure that one of them is appointed as the head of the United Evangelical Church. It was recommended to counteract the numerical growth of Pentecostals at the expense of other groups within the United Evangelical Church and to prevent Pentecostals from influencing the youth of other churches, such as Baptist and Lutheran. It was recommended to sever Pentecostal contacts with oases and other secular organizations within the Catholic Church. Control over the arrivals of emissaries from Pentecostal missionary centers in the West was ordered.\n\n\n== Letters, statements, denunciations ==\n\n\n=== Report of the hearing (1950) ===\nProtocol from the interrogation of the suspect Teodor Maksymowicz dated 26 September 1950:In the initial period after liberation, that is, in 1945, we began organizing Evangelical Christian branches in each of our respective areas. Towards the end of 1945, we started establishing correspondence contacts, and in this way, we found each other throughout the country. In September 1945, Jerzy Sacewicz arrived in Kętrzyn, who had authorization from the Baptists. Sacewicz posted an announcement on the Baptist chapel with his address. Based on this, we established contact with Sacewicz and invited him to Kętrzyn. Sacewicz arrived on 17 November 1945, and under his leadership, we held the first organizational meeting, during which a chairman and his deputy were elected (...). With his assistance, we organized a congregation in Kętrzyn, which consisted of Baptists, adherents of the Church of Christ, and Evangelical Christians. At that time, we stood for cooperation with all kindred denominations. This situation lasted until 1946 (...). Under pressure from Czerski and Januszewicz, I was forced to break away from the Baptists and start working independently. Januszewicz did the same in Łódź. Since the East European Mission stood for cooperation with kindred denominations, following the example of the union that took place in the USSR, I also sought cooperation with kindred denominations in my area.\n\n\n=== Letter from Józef Mrózek to the Presidium of the United Evangelical Church ===\n\nIn May 1962, Józef Mrózek – secretary of the United Evangelical Church – sent a letter to the Presidium of the United Evangelical Church, explaining why he does not want to run for the new Church Council:I do not agree with the church's previous policy regarding schismatics, simpletons, and similar elements who only seek to benefit from being part of the United Evangelical Church but do not feel obligated to the it. These people are, moreover, unhealthy both in terms of dogma and ethics, as well as in matters of church order. (...) The majority of time at Council and Presidium meetings was spent on matters related to schismatics and similar elements, leaving little time for issues related to the church's proper tasks. Not only does the church as a whole suffer from this, but above all, work in the field suffers. I bore the sad duty of spending hundreds of hours at such meetings and documenting everything, which took hundreds more hours. I observed in myself and in other brothers that these matters ruin our personal spiritual lives. Our spiritual level presents a rather sad picture. (...) Holding a position in the Presidium of the Church Council has nationwide significance, and due to the good of the Church and the mutual relations between the church and the state, these positions should essentially be held by individuals who have the support or at least the approval of the authorities. I cannot say this about myself. I am the only member of the Presidium who has been refused a passport by the authorities. A similar fate befell my father. (...) I kindly ask you not to consider my candidacy. (...)\n\n\n=== Letters to the Office for Religious Affairs ===\nOn 28 February 1974, Sergiusz Waszkiewicz sent a statement to the Office adopted by the participants of the pre-synodal meeting held on 11 February 1974:\nWe strongly declare that we have always been in favor of the unity of the United Evangelical Church, (...) we state unequivocally the groundlessness of accusations regarding the alleged tendency to split the church.\nWe believe it is necessary for the good of the United Evangelical Church to ensure doctrinal equality for all factions within the church, including Evangelical Christians, in all church agendas and in the entire church life. (...)\nWe believe it is necessary to appoint – if there is a need for appointment at all – district presbyters for a given district in agreement with the congregations and representatives of the Evangelical Christian faction, provided that the majority of congregations in that district belong to this faction, or two district presbyters if there are congregations of two factions in the district (e.g., as is currently the case in the Katowice district).\nWe believe it is necessary to delegate representatives from the respective factions in the Church Council to address congregation issues; if a congregation consists of followers of two factions, then two representatives should be appointed to the Church Council accordingly.\nWe believe it is necessary to allow workers from all factions, including Evangelical Christians, to participate: a) in broadcasting radio programs, b) in the Bible School, c) in book and magazine publishing, d) in other church agendas.\nWe believe it is necessary to elevate the status of Church Council members from all factions and provide them with protection against attacks by unauthorized individuals within the Church.\nWe believe it is necessary to adhere to the Church's Statute by the Presidium of the Church Council, taking into account the principles of democratic and collective leadership in all church matters.\nWe believe it is necessary to establish a commission to review the Church's Statute to prepare amendments and changes to the statute for the upcoming Church Synod.\nWe nominate the following candidates – elected at the meeting by secret ballot – as members and substitutes of the Church Council for the next term: Sergiusz Waszkiewicz, Aleksander Rapanowicz, Teodor Maksymowicz, Edward Czajko, Aleksander Mańkowski, Tadeusz Gaweł, Władysław Rudkowski, Józef Suski.\nAn anonymous representative of the United Evangelical Church drafted a memorandum (no date or signature):\nThe United Evangelical Church consists of 5 factions, forming 2 blocs: a) Evangelical – Evangelical Christians Union, Free Union, Church of Christ; b) Pentecostals – Evangelical Christians of the Faith (Pentecostals), Resolute Christians Union.\nIn terms of numbers: About ⅓ of the members are Evangelical Christians of the Faith (Pentecostals), ⅓ are Free Christians, ⅓ are Evangelicals, resolute, Church of Christ, and congregations or individuals without a clear denominational label.\nSo far, each of the 5 factions has had 6 members in the 30-person Church Council. This was not a proper representation of the church, as the 3 smaller factions (Evangelical, resolute, and Church of Christ), constituting only 1/5 of the Church, had as many as 18 councilors, i.e., 60%, while Evangelical Christians of the Faith and Free Christians, constituting about ⅔ of the church, had only 12 councilors in total (i.e., 40%). It is proposed that in the future, each faction should have the following number of councilors: Pentecostals – 9 and 3 alternates, Free Christians – 9 and 3 alternates, Evangelicals – 4 and 2 alternates (...). Evangelicals, resolute, Church of Christ will not be disadvantaged, as they will have a total of 12 seats, i.e., 40%, and constitute approximately 20% of the members or congregations in the church.\nThere has been a tacit agreement between the factions that the Presidium of the Church Council includes 2 representatives of the Pentecostals, 2 Free Christians, and 1 representative of each of the other factions (usually as vice presidents).\nWe believe that representatives from the respective factions should, as far as possible, be \"native\" representatives rather than artificially (...) created ones. For example, the Evangelicals are represented by Najmałowski, Muranty, and J. Tołwiński (recently also T. Jarosz), none of whom is a \"native\" Evangelical Christian.\nIndividual church agendas are generally led by suitable individuals from different factions. It is not true that all \"key\" positions are concentrated in the hands of the Free Christians. For example, Pentecostals hold the positions of Treasurer of the Church Council (Maksymowicz) and Secretary of the 'Chrześcijanin' editorial office (E. Czajko), Evangelicals – Secretary of the Church Council (Muranty), Church of Christ – Head of the Publishing Department (A. Lewczuk).\nIt is true that Free Christians hold the most positions, but it is also true that this faction has the greatest contribution to the church's unification work and implementation of the principles of legality, as well as the largest number of workers.\nTo weaken the position of Free Christians in the church, a coalition has been formed against them, not so much of congregations, but rather of activists who usurp the right to represent our community. The attack was directed primarily at the vice president representing the Free Christians, J. Mrózek, the district elder for Katowice, M. Giertler, the Bible School (M. Kwiecień), and 'Głos Ewangelii', and as for the congregations – mainly against the Chorzów Congregation and the 1st Congregation in Warsaw.\nSynod date. It is proposed to hold it on May 10–11, with the 9th being a day of celebration for the 30th anniversary of the Polish People's Republic. All 3 days are public holidays. This will allow time to settle all matters (especially financial ones) without haste.\n\n\n== Main achievements ==\nMajor achievements of the church throughout its entire existence include:\n\nNearly 100% growth in the number of faithful\nSignificant multiplication of congregations\nConstruction of a series of church buildings, including the construction of a central chapel in Warsaw\nEstablishment of the House for the Elderly in Ostróda\nPublishing activity, including the publication of the monthly magazine Chrześcijanin\n\n\n== See also ==\nUnited and uniting churches\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBiełaszko, M.; Piekarska, A.

The film is a dramatization of the \"automne chaud\", a real-life series of voyeurism and sexual assault incidents in Quebec City in 1979 that culminated in the murder of young actress France Lachapelle.\nThe film stars Marie Tifo as Marie-Louise, the film's version of Lachapelle, as well as Jean-Marie Lemieux, Pierre Curzi, Raymond Bouchard, Denise Proulx, Pierrette Robitaille, Rémy Girard, Gaston Lepage, Micheline Bernard, Denise Gagnon, Paul Hébert, Serge Thibodeau, Bob Walsh and Yves Bourque.\n\n\n== Critical response ==\nAlexandre Fontaine Rousseau of Panorama Cinema called the film a \"second-rate giallo\", and opined that elements of it seemed copied from Black Christmas and the films of Dario Argento.\nFor the Montreal Gazette, Maureen Peterson gave it a mixed review, praising its camera work and acting but assessing the film as \"caught between two perfectly valid objectives. Is it a thriller designed primarily to entertain, or a cinematic essay on violence and sexism?\"\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nLachapelle had been a friend and colleague of actor and filmmaker Robert Lepage in the Quebec City theatre scene, with the result that Lepage discovered her body and was actually the police investigator's initial suspect before being cleared, yet Simoneau asked Lepage to play the killer in Red Eyes.\nThis inspired Lepage's 1996 film Polygraph (Le Polygraphe), which centred on an actress who was cast as the victim in a film about a murder despite having personally known both the victim and the primary suspect.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRed Eyes at IMDb",

        "content": "Und ewig singen die Wälder (Riksmål: Og bakom synger skogene, roughly translated as: \"And behind sing the forests\") is a novel written by the Norwegian author Trygve Gulbranssen, published in 1933 by the Oslo-based Aschehoug Verlag publishing house. Written in the Riksmål dialect, the work, a novel of development, rural life, generations, and horror, constitutes the first part of the internationally successful Björndal Trilogy (Bjørndaltrilogien), which also includes the novel Das Erbe von Björndal (1934) and the novella Heimkehr nach Björndal (1935). The German translation by Ellen de Boor was first published in 1935. Additionally, the novel has been translated into many other languages.\nUnd ewig singen die Wälder was already the most successful foreign bestseller in the German-speaking world before the Second World War. In the post-war period, the film adaptation of the same name (1959) directed by Paul May for Wiener Mundus-Film contributed to its renewed popularity.\nThe novel tells the story of the Norwegian forest farmer Dag Björndal, who achieves prosperity through diligent hard work in the late 18th century but becomes a callous person in the process. Various other people enter his life – including his strong, charitable wife Therese, his quiet, sensitive sister-in-law Dorthea, and his reserved but wise secretary, Captain Klinge – under whose influence he learns that true independence, taught to him by his father, is not attained through striving for self-sufficiency and ruthless accumulation of possessions but only through human empathy and Christian mercy.\n\n\n== Plot and Characters ==\n\n\n=== First Book ===\n\nThe setting is rural Norway at the transition between lowland and high forest, initially in the 1760s.\nAn old bear wreaks havoc around the Björkland estate located in the lowlands. Since the residents do not know how to deal with it, they ask for help from Torgeir, the lord of the Björndal farm located higher up in the forest. The North with its dense forests frightens the lowland residents; they believe that it is haunted there and inhabited by trolls and huldren: \"All evil came from the north - from the forests.\" (p. 13) The people living there are not only considered fearless bear hunters but are also accused by the valley farmers of witchcraft, licentiousness, and wild brawls. Torgeir kills the bear but dies in the fight with the animal.\nAfter Torgeir's death, his two sons, Tore and Dag, take over the Björndal farm, which thrives under their leadership. Although they suspect that they are secretly despised by the valley farmers, they also establish contacts with them. Tore marries the daughter of the Gistad farmer. An approach between Björndal and the valley farmers suffers a setback when Dag instigates a brawl at a wedding party in the valley.\nThe brothers also have business dealings with the town, especially with the Holder trading house. Dag gives Therese, the daughter of the trading partner, a golden brooch as a gift. Only vaguely does he realize that she will interpret this gift as a declaration of love.\nWhen Tore, with his wife and child, breaks through the ice during a sleigh ride on a frozen lake and drowns, Dag is plunged into a deep crisis. He considers the loss of his brother a punishment from God and does not know how to continue running the Björndal farm without him. However, he is shown the way by a letter from Therese Holder, who desperately seeks a husband. Dag brings her to Björndal as his wife, where Therese's sister Dorthea also finds a new home.\nTherese loves Dag sincerely and, contrary to everyone's expectations, quickly grows into her new role as a farmer. She and Dorthea also bring about some changes in Björndal. The first change is the effort to persuade Dag, who avoids the church because of the enmity with the valley farmers, to attend Midnight Mass. However, Dag finds it difficult to make this concession to the valley farmers, and to make up for the humiliation he supposedly endures, he races with the Borglænders – the noble lords in the valley and his main adversaries – during the sleigh ride to the church. A sleigh ride on a frozen lake (painting by Langlem Kari Nordgård). As part of his efforts to normalize relations with the valley farmers, Dag sets off with the women to attend the midnight mass in the church. However, in order not to offend the Borglænders further, he orders the women to leave the sleigh, and then races to the church on his own. However, he loses control of his horse and only just avoids a collision with the belfry. The valley farmers are afraid that Dag will curse them for their apparent victory.\nA little later, the owners of the Björndal estate also have to make a decision about the Norwegian Forest Act. Tore would have voted for it, while Dag, who sees the Act as an infringement of his freedom, opposes it. However, he is unable to vote at all because he gets into a brawl again at the voting meeting.\nAfter the women have come to terms with the fact that they will not get to know the friendly, brave side of the valley farmers so soon, they decide to invite them to a party. The celebration, which the valley farmers accepted in the end, takes place in the valley. However, it ends in a disaster because of the terrible weather and because the Borglænders continue to refuse to meet on an equal footing with Dag. When it is feared that the guests might not make it home because of the storm, Dag proposes that they should all spend the night in the valley, but the Borglænders reject the suggestion. The women's hearts are heavy; Therese begins to understand her husband's loneliness.\nAt the end of the novel, the young estate owners are also confronted with another challenge. The lowland farmers demand that the Björndal farmers stop cutting wood in the higher forest area because this could lead to the flooding of the valley. However, the Björndal farmers depend on the forest. After all, Dag wants to make another attempt to approach the valley farmers at the spring market.\nDag's problems with the valley farmers and the law and his attempt to develop and maintain his estate in accordance with his own ideas form the core of the novel. Although he was an independent man by nature, Dag was unable to prevent his life from becoming increasingly entangled with the valley farmers' lives. In the end, he has to come to terms with the fact that the world does not belong to him alone.\nIn addition to Dag, the novel also features various other characters such as Tore, Therese, Dorthea, and Captain Klinge. The characters are depicted as complex and multi-layered, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, virtues and vices. Through their interactions and conflicts, the novel explores themes of family, love, duty, honor, ambition, and the struggle for identity and meaning in a changing world.\n\n\n== Themes and Interpretation ==\nUnd ewig singen die Wälder is a multi-layered work that addresses various themes and issues. One of the central themes of the novel is the relationship between man and nature. The forest plays a prominent role in the story, serving as both a source of sustenance and wealth for the Björndal family and a symbol of the untamed forces of the natural world. The forest is depicted as a place of mystery and danger, inhabited by wild animals, mythical creatures, and unseen spirits. It is also portrayed as a place of beauty and wonder, with its towering trees, lush vegetation, and hidden treasures.\nAnother important theme of the novel is the conflict between tradition and modernity. The Björndal family represents traditional values and ways of life, rooted in the land and the customs of their ancestors. They are portrayed as hardworking, self-reliant, and fiercely independent, refusing to bow to outside authority or conform to social expectations. In contrast, the valley farmers represent modernity and progress, with their embrace of new technologies, social reforms, and changing attitudes towards religion, morality, and the natural world. The novel explores the tensions and conflicts that arise when these two worlds collide, as well as the compromises and sacrifices that are made in the name of progress.\nLove and marriage are also important themes in the novel. The relationship between Dag and Therese forms the emotional heart of the story, as they navigate the challenges and hardships of married life together. Their love is tested by external pressures and internal conflicts, but ultimately proves to be strong enough to withstand even the greatest trials. The novel also explores the themes of duty, honor, and sacrifice, as the characters struggle to balance their personal desires and ambitions with their obligations to family, community, and society.\nOverall, Und ewig singen die Wälder is a rich and complex work that offers a vivid portrait of life in rural Norway in the late 18th century. Through its compelling characters, evocative setting, and timeless themes, the novel continues to resonate with readers around the world, more than eight decades after its initial publication.\n\n\n== Editions (Selection) ==\nNorwegian Original\n\nOg bakom synger skogene: noen historier fra 1760-årene til frem mot 1810, Aschehoug, Oslo, 1933\nOg bakom synger skogene, Aschehoug pocket, Oslo, 2005\nOg bakom synger skogene, Lydbokforlaget, 2007, ISBN 978-82-421-2945-1 (Audiobook, read by Bjørn Fougner)\nIn German Translation\n\nUnd ewig singen die Wälder, Langen Müller Verlag, Munich, 1935, translated by Ellen de Boor\nUnd ewig singen die Wälder, epubli, Berlin, 2019, ISBN 978-3-7502-5961-4\nIn Other Languages\n\nOch bortom sjunga skogarna: några historier från 1760-talet fram till 1810, Gebers, Stockholm, 1934, translated into Swedish by Aslög Davidson and Elsa Thulin\nMetsien humina: tarinoita 1760-luvulta v:n 1810 paikkeille, VSOY, Porvoo, 1935, translated into Finnish by Lauri Hirvensalo\nOg bag dem synger skovene : handlingen udspilles i tiden 1760 til 1810, Aschehoug, Copenhagen, 1935, translated into Danish by Jørgen Budtz-Jørgensen\nVěčně zpívají lesy.

        "content": "Nicholas Boys Smith MBE (born 1 March 1975) is an author, researcher and campaigner, best known as the founding Director of Create Streets, an independent research institute that campaigns for an increase in what it describes as ‘gentle development’, subscribing to ideas of the New Urbanism and New Classical Architecture movements.\nMany of Create Streets’ ideas are now being embedded in national and local planning policy and Boys Smith has been widely recognised as greatly influential over the UK government's policy in this area, being described as the Conservative's ‘Building Design Tsar’.\n\n\n= Education =\nGrandson of John Boys Smith, vice-chancellor of the University of Cambridge, Boys Smith was educated at Westminster School and Peterhouse, Cambridge, where he read history, taking a double first and an MPhil with distinction. While at university, he was President of the Cambridge Union.\n\n\n= Career =\nOut of university Boys Smith worked at the Conservative Research Department, including as an adviser on welfare policy to the Conservative social security secretary, Peter Lilley. He then spent a period of time as a McKinsey consultant and an investment banker at Lloyds. In 2006 he advised George Osborne, then shadow chancellor, on tax policy.\nBoys Smith set up the think tank Create Streets in 2012 ‘out of frustration with the low quality of too much recent development and of irrational decision-making.’ The ‘public genesis’ of the organisation came through a 2013 report authored by Boys Smith and Alex Morton, titled ‘Create Streets’, co-published with Policy Exchange.\nBoys Smith has since co-chaired the British Government's ‘Building Better, Building Beautiful Commission’ with Roger Scruton, publishing in 2020 its final report ‘Living With Beauty’. As of 2024 he serves as chair of the ‘Office for Place’ within the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities.\nIn addition he is a Commissioner of Historic England and a senior research fellow at the University of Buckingham. He writes extensively on development, planning and the links between design, wellbeing, value, sustainability and public support. Boys Smith's writing has appeared in the Spectator, Evening Standard, Times, Sunday Times, Telegraph and Guardian.\nIn 2022 he published his first book, ‘No Free Parking’, a history of London's built environment, focusing on places appearing in the London version of the game Monopoly.\nIn 2024 Boys Smith was awarded an MBE in the New Year's Honours List for services to planning and design.\n\n\n= Works =\n\"Create Streets\" (PDF).

        "content": "Raymond (Ray) Wallace Thorburn (19 September 1937 – 16 March 2023) was a New Zealand artist, art educator and museum director.\n\n\n== Life and education ==\nThorburn was born in Wellington  on 19 September 1937. He attended Wellington High School from 1951 to 1954. From 1955 -59 he completed a diploma of Fine Arts at the University of Auckland and a diploma from the Auckland Secondary Teachers College. By 1967 he was a lecturer in art at the Palmerston North Teachers Training College, Thorburn completed an MA (1975) and  PhD (1981) in the United States at Ohio State University and went on to make teacher training and art education the focus of his professional life. His roles included: Art Education Officer in the Department of Education, Director of Art Education for the Curriculum Development Division of the Department of Education where he created teaching programmes for tertiary institutions involved with art, design and craft. He was also chief executive officer of the Northland Polytechnic, Chairman of the New Zealand Industrial Design Council, CEO and president of Northland Polytechnic and Director of Waikato Museum of Art and History.\n\n\n== Art career ==\nA year after finishing art school Thorburn was included in the 1960 Hay's Ltd. Art Competition (more commonly known as the Hay's Prize) with his painting Wellington Head. His first solo exhibition was at the Argus Gallery in Melbourne, Australia and four years later in 1969 he won the Manawatu Prize for Contemporary Art with Modular 10 Series 1, 1969. In 1971 Thorburn was selected to represent New Zealand at the XI International São Paulo Art Biennale in Brazil, alongside with Ralph Hotere and Michael Eaton.  Writing in Art International critic Bernard Denvir said of Thornley's work, ‘Of those who concern themselves with the exploration of spatial ambiguities and the solution of spatial problems within a rigidly defined area [among) the most impressive [was] the New Zealander Ray Thorburn. Primarily concerned with relationships, Thorburn also presents the spectator with the opportunity of exploring movement. The following year Thorburn was included in the Third Biennale International de l’Estampe in Paris. In 1973 Thorburn was awarded the Frances Hodgkins Fellowship at the University of Otago.\n\n\n== The evolution of Thorburn’s painting practice ==\nAfter art school Thorburn initially worked with landscape forms often adding relief elements to the surface, but around 1967, he extended these ideas to shaped canvases that could descend down the wall to the floor. Thorburn is primarily known for his tightly painted multi-panelled modular works which he developed between around 1967 and 1973. Over this time they attracted considerable critical attention.\nGil Docking, director of the Auckland Art Gallery at the time, described the effect of these works as follows: \"The modular method means that each set of panels comprises of four detachable units of the same format…that may then be physically rearranged to make new combinations…Each panel is painted with narrow stripes of colour, and the closeness and juxtaposition of these stripes causes optical intermingling, illusions of space and after-images to arise on the retina of the eye.\" Art historian Michael Dunn cited Thorburn himself in characterising the process as like \"a modular set to a family of four brothers and sisters, each having his or her own personality and sharing in a strong family unity, yet all being capable of varying relationships with one another\". The painting itself was undertaken by commercial car spray-painters which as Andrew Bogle curator at the Auckland Art Gallery noted, ‘violated one of the most hallowed art traditions’. Art historian Tony Green discussed Thorburn's style when reviewing his second dealer gallery exhibition in 1970: \"The ground colours behind the lines are differently treated in each group of panels. The panels are made up of groups of four, which can be assembled in several different ways. Out of these simple elements he constructs a series of varied compositions...the sets of lines vibrate in a coloured haze against the ground. Interference effects, simultaneous contrasts and after-images abound but Thorburn uses these for colour enrichment, not for op-art illusions of movement.\" Reviewing Thorburn’s contribution to the 1971 São Paulo Biennale, art historian Patrick Hutchings wrote how his paintings, \"dazzle the eye. They shimmer like neon tubes, and, with their sheer optical impact… As aesthetic machines, Thorburn's panels achieve their manifest end with evident, indeed with dazzling, efficiency.\" In the 1980s, reviewer Chris Parr, looking back at the Modular Series, said of Thorburn's work, ‘Ray Thorburn's intense networks of graduated lines are suggestive of electronic circuits and laser light; while his colours unquestionably date his work in the psychedelic era of the late sixties.\nIn the early 1980s, after his return from studying for his PhD in Ohio, Thorburn's work underwent a dramatic change. The tight modular paintings gave way to image-based work incorporating \"leaves from the 1982 calendar and holographs of pages from his PhD thesis\". Thorburn exhibited these paintings in 1984 as the series PH & D: Piled Higher and Deeper. Art writer John Roberts put the change down to the resurfacing of a \"preoccupation with calligraphy…stimulated in part by the shock of the graffiti in the New York Subway.\"\n\n\n== Thorburn and Len Lye ==\nWhile travelling on a Queen Elizabeth II Arts Council grant in 1971, Thorburn met Len Lye in New York City. On his return to New Zealand the next year, he attempted to arrange a public museum venue for a Len Lye exhibition. Roger Horrocks, Lye's biographer, recounts that Thorburn  was \"shocked at the lack of interest\" by the National Art Gallery and looked toward smaller provincial galleries. In New Plymouth he found that Govett-Brewster Art Gallery director Bob Ballard, who was American and knew Lye's work, and local engineer John Matthews were excited by the idea of bringing Lye's work to New Zealand. Thorburn and Matthews went to New York to talk to Lye and these discussion resulted in Matthews over-seeing the construction of the sculpture Trilogy in New Plymouth. Thorburn continued to keep in close contact with Lye and in 1974, while on a Fulbright Scholarship, interviewed him in New York as well as documenting works in the studio. The interview was one of a series Thorburn conducted with New York artists  in preparation for his master's degree from Ohio State University.  In Lye's case the interview was also recorded on video.  Two of Thorburn's most intriguing interviews were undertaken in 1976 and 1982 when he interviewed Colin McCahon in possibly the only taped interviews made with the artist. Len Lye came to New Zealand in 1977 to set up the Govett-Brewster exhibition,  and at that time met with Thorburn, Hamish Keith and John Matthews to discuss setting up a non-profit foundation that would be \"for the public benefit of the people of New Zealand\". A Trust Deed was signed in 1980 and the extensive gift Lye made of his work is now housed in the Govett-Brewster's Len Lye Centre in New Plymouth.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nSelected solo and Group exhibitions include the following.\n\n\n=== 1960 ===\nHays Ltd Art Competition, Durham Street Art Gallery (group)\n\n\n=== 1965 ===\nArgus Gallery, Melbourne, Australia\n\n\n=== 1967 ===\nManawatu Art Prize (group) Manawatu Art Gallery, Palmerston North.

        "content": "William Jameson (fl. 1689–1720) was a blind Scottish university teacher and religious controversialist.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nJameson was born blind, but, being educated at the university of Glasgow, he ‘atteaned to great learning, and became particularly well skilled in history both civill and ecclesiastick’ (Munimenta Univ. Glasg., Maitland Club, ii. 363). He may possibly be the William Gemisoune who was a student in December 1676 (ib.) On 30 May 1692 the senate, taking into consideration the blindness and great learning of Jameson, who had no estate to subsist by, allowed him two hundred merks Scots for two years, for which he was to give instruction ‘according to his capacity’ in civil and ecclesiastical history under the direction of the faculty (ib. ii. 363). From December 1692 he delivered a public prelection on civil history once a week in Latin (ib. ii. 364). He is sometimes designated as lecturer, sometimes loosely as professor of history. In 1696 the university increased his annuity to 400l., on the promise of a committee of visitation that the government would shortly relieve them of the burden. It was not, however, till 1705 that the promise was fulfilled (ib. ii. 388). In 1705 Jameson wrote of his long sickness and indisposition (Cyprianus, Pref.). In the Wodrow MSS. (Advoc. Library, Jac. vi. 27, quoted in W. J. Duncan's Notices of the Literary History of Glasgow, Maitland Club, 1831) there is a note that, till the beginning of 1710, there had for many years been no public prelections in the university of Glasgow excepting some discourses by Dr. Robert St. Clare and Jameson. Another William Jameson entered the university of Glasgow in 1720, and in 1727 he or a namesake, ‘historiæ studiosus,’ was placed on the roll of electors of the lord rector (Munim.)\nJameson published at Edinburgh in 1689 ‘Verus Patroclus; or the Weapons of Quakerism the weakness of Quakerism.’ According to the dedication to the Earl of Dundonald, its publication had been prohibited in May 1689 by Dr. Alexander Monro, principal of Edinburgh University and inspector of the press, unless all mention of popery was omitted. In the bitter literary controversy between episcopalians and presbyterians which raged for over twenty years after the expulsion of Monro and others from Edinburgh University, and turned upon the position of the apostolic and patristic bishop, Jameson vehemently maintained the presbyterian view. In 1697 he published at Glasgow ‘Nazianzeni querela et votum justum (Greg. Naz. Orat. 28); the fundamentals of the Hierarchy examined and disproved,’ in reply to Monro and Bishop John Sage. His attack in this work upon the authority of the epistles of St. Ignatius drew a ‘Short Answer’ from Robert Calder in 1708. Jameson's next book, ‘Roma Racoviana et Racovia Romana, id est Papistarum et Socinistarum in plurimis religionis suæ capitibus plena et exacta harmonia,’ appeared at Edinburgh in 1702. In 1705 he interfered in the controversy between Gilbert Rule, Monro's successor as principal of Edinburgh University, and Bishop Sage over the Cyprianic bishop, with his ‘Cyprianus Isotimus,’ Edinburgh, 1705. In 1708 Jameson published at Edinburgh ‘Mr. John Davidson's Catechism,’ with a controversial discourse prefixed. In 1712 appeared also at Edinburgh ‘The Sum of the Episcopal Controversy.’ Jameson ‘doubted not that the Spirit of God had a peculiar view to Scotland, when he says by Isaiah, “I will make an everlasting Covenant with you,” &c.’ In a second edition of this diatribe (Glasgow, 1713) he seems to claim as his ‘A Sample of Jet-black Prelatick Calumny,’ Glasgow, 1713. His last known book was ‘Spicilegia Antiquitatum Ægypti, atque ei vicinarum gentium,’ Glasgow, 1720, a premature attempt to harmonize sacred and profane history.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Tait, James (1892). \"Jameson, William (fl.1689-1720)\".

        "content": "Penmon Lifeboat Station is a former Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) lifeboat station located at Penmon Point, north east of the town of Beaumaris, on the eastern tip of the Isle of Anglesey, Wales.\nA lifeboat was first stationed here by the Royal National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck (RNIPLS) in 1831, managed by the Anglesey Association for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck\nThe station was closed in 1915, after a motor-powered lifeboat was placed at Beaumaris\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Anglesey Association for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck (AAPLS) was founded by the Rev. James and Mrs Frances Williams in 1828.They had witnessed the loss of 140 lives from the wreck of the vessel Alert in 1823, and spent the following five years raising funds and gaining support.\nIn 1830, the Anglesey Association wrote to the RNIPLS requesting their help to place a lifeboat at Penmon. Lifeboat No.4, a 26-foot 6-oar non-self-righting 'Palmer' type lifeboat, was built by Harton, and transported by sea via Kingstown (Dún Laoghaire), to Holyhead, arriving at Penmon on 28 January 1831. Landowner Sir Richard Williams-Bulkeley, 10th Baronet provided a site, and constructed a 32-foot x 10-foot stone-built boathouse, with doors at both ends to help launch in either direction, at the sound between Anglesey and Puffin Island. In 18 years, the first Penmon boat would launch 8 times, and rescue 27.\nLifeboat No.4 was transferred to the new station at Moelfre in 1848, and a new 26-foot boat was provided to Penmon. Only one service call is recorded, and no lives saved, but on 29 March 1850, over 35 vessels were driven ashore by the conditions at Penmon, and the lifeboat-men spent many hours helping vessels and crew.\nThe lifeboats of the AAPLS were transferred over to the management of the (now) RNLI in 1855. Soon afterwards, Capt. Ward, Inspector of Lifeboats, visited Penmon, and launching with the crew on exercise, found that the lifeboat was \"too light\". A replacement 28-foot 6-oar lifeboat costing £126 was ordered from Forrestt of Limehouse. She was a self-righting lifeboat, which would prove invaluable some years later. Called to the aid of the Jabez of Scarborough on the 23 March 1868, and with 5 rescuees aboard, the lifeboat was capsized. After self-righting, everyone managed to get back on board. However, the incident prompted calls for a larger boat. \nCosting £251, a 30-foot 10-oared self-righting boat was provided to Penmon in 1868, again built by Forrestt. A long way from the sea, the lifeboat was funded by the Settle, North Yorkshire branch of the RNLI, the boat being named Christopher Brown after their primary fundraiser.\nA new boathouse was constructed in 1880 to house a 34-foot lifeboat, again funded by Settle RNLI branch, and again named Christopher Brown (ON 266). The lifeboat ended up being moored afloat for 2 years, during the reconstruction of the slipway, which was washed away in a storm.\nIn 1914, the lifeboat station at Beaumaris was reopened, following the construction of a new boathouse and deep-water roller-slipway, to house a new motor-lifeboat, Frederick Kitchen (ON 621). Now surplus to requirements, Penmon Lifeboat Station was closed on 31 March 1915. The lifeboat on station at the time, Christopher Brown (ON 390), was withdrawn and sold.\nThe boathouse was handed back to the landowner, Sir Richard Williams-Bulkeley, 12th Baronet, the grandson of the original landowner. The boathouse still stands, and is available as a Holiday Let.\n\n\n== Station honours ==\nThe following are awards made at Penmon\n\nRNLI Silver Medal\nOwen Roberts, Pilot - 1838\nThomas Price, Fisherman  - 1854\nWilliam M.

        "content": "James Kirkpatrick (died 1743) was an Irish Presbyterian minister.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nKirkpatrick was the son of Hugh Kirkpatrick, who was minister successively of Lurgan, co. Armagh, Ireland, Dalry and Old Cumnock in Scotland, and Ballymoney, co. Armagh (where he died in 1712). He was probably born in Scotland while his father was minister there. In February 1691 he matriculated from the university of Glasgow, and in February 1694 his name appears in the university list of students in theology. On 7 August (probably) 1699 he was ordained as minister of the congregation of Templepatrick, co. Antrim. The well-known ‘Belfast Society,’ which exercised an important influence on the ecclesiastical affairs of the north of Ireland, was founded in 1705, and Kirkpatrick was one of its earliest and most influential members. In 1706 he resigned his charge at Templepatrick on receiving an invitation from the presbyterian congregation in Belfast to take the place of their minister, John McBride, who had been obliged to retire to Scotland owing to his non-abjuring opinions. Soon afterwards the congregation divided on account of its numbers, and he became minister of the second congregation, a new meeting-house having been built close to the first. In 1712 he was elected moderator of the synod of Ulster. In 1720 he came prominently into notice as one of the leaders of the non-subscribing party in the north of Ireland. In 1725 he was placed with the other non-subscribers in the presbytery of Antrim, which the synod in 1726 excluded from its judicatories. In his later days he took the degree of M.D., and combined the practice of a physician with the work of a clergyman. He is said to have died suddenly in Dublin, where he had gone on business with his wife. The date of his death is usually given as 1744, but a notice by James Blow, prefixed to Kirkpatrick's posthumous ‘Defence of Christian Liberty,’ shows that he died in 1743. A copy of his portrait is in the vestry of the first presbyterian church in Belfast.\nKirkpatrick is best known by his ‘Historical Essay upon the Loyalty of Presbyterians in Great-Britain and Ireland from the Reformation to this present year 1713, &c.’ (4to, pp. xv, 564, and index of ten pages, no place or printer's name, 1713), a work undertaken to meet the desire of the general synod to possess a history of their church, and specially called for by the persistent attacks of Tisdall, vicar of Belfast, on the presbyterian body. It preserves many valuable facts and documents, and gives a good idea of the state of public sentiment in Ireland in the days of Queen Anne. It was published anonymously. Kirkpatrick also wrote: \n\n‘A Vindication of the Presbyterian Ministers in the North of Ireland, subscribers and non-subscribers, from many gross and groundless aspersions cast upon them in a late scandalous libel entitled “An Account of the Mind of the Synod,”’ Belfast, 1721, 8vo (anon.; by ‘A Lover of Truth and Peace’).\n‘A Scripture Plea against a fatal rupture and breach of Christian Communion amongst the Presbyterians in the North of Ireland,’ Belfast, 1724, 8vo.\n‘An Essay upon the Important Question whether there is a Legislative Proper Authority in the Church,’ Belfast, 1731, 8vo (anon.; by several hands, probably edited by Kirkpatrick).\n‘An Account of the Success of Mrs. Stephens's Medicines for the Stone; in the case of James Kirkpatrick, Doctor of Divinity, M.D., &c.,’ Belfast, 1739, 8vo.\n‘A Defence of Christian Liberty, by a Member of the General Synod,’ Belfast, 1743, 4to (unfinished).\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Hamilton, Thomas (1892). \"Kirkpatrick, James\".

        "content": "Walter Baier (born 1954) is an Austrian politician of the Communist Party of Austria (KPÖ).\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBorn in Vienna, Baier was the son of a communist who was interred at Dachau concentration camp, but Baier did not ascribe to communism until into his adult years. Baier was the federal president of the KPÖ from 1994 to 2006.\nIn October 2004, Baier sold the Ernst-Kirchweger-Haus, a Vienna building owned by the party and rented out to communal groups for a symbolic rent of one Austrian schilling a year. The running of the house had cost €17,000 a year. He faced criticism from some on the Austrian left, including Nobel Prize in Literature laureate Elfriede Jelinek. The criticism intensified when the buyer turned out to be a real estate company whose director shared a name and possibly an address with a man doxed as a neo-Nazi in 1977; the house was named after an Austrian communist murdered by Nazis.\nIn 2009, a lawsuit against Baier by the writer on far-right politics Wolfgang Purtscheller was dismissed in the Vienna Commercial Court. Purtscheller had said in an interview with Der Standard that Austria's three main parties after World War II, including the KPÖ, had specialist units for former Nazis. In his history of the party, Baier called Purtscheller's claim a distortion of history, and Purtscheller sued to prohibit the sale of Baier's book. The court dismissed the suit, citing Baier's freedom of speech.\nIn 2011, Baier was one of four atheists invited by Pope Benedict XVI to the Inter-Faith Summit in Assisi, Italy. The others were Guillermo Hurtado, Julia Kristeva and Remo Bodei.\nBaier was elected leader of the Party of the European Left in December 2022. In his first speech, he called for Russian withdrawal from Ukraine and an end to the war through negotiations, while also championing anti-racism, feminism and climate action. Baier was elected unopposed as the party's lead candidate in the 2024 European Parliament election, seeking election to the European Commission, but was not put on any electoral list to be elected to the European Parliament.\n\n\n== References ==",

Cupcakke is seen with one breast out and the other covered (although you can see the nipple). She is seen pouring whipped cream and chocolate sauce in her mouth, and sucking on pickles.\nAt one point, she is seen licking whipped cream off her nipple.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Caroline Nompozolo (born 1908) was the first native South African woman to qualify as a physician. She studied medicine at the School of Medicine of the Scottish Medical Royal Colleges and was later house surgeon at St Charles' Hospital.\n\n\n== Early education ==\nShe was educated at Healdtown High School in Eastern Cape Province, where Nelson Mandela was also a pupil from 1937. She went on to study science at South African Native College, Fort Hare in Alice in the Eastern Cape. The South African Native College, later the University of Fort Hare, was founded in  1916 on  the  site  of  a former British military garrison. The College offered European style higher education and alumni include Nelson Mandela, Oliver Tambo and Robert Mugabe. Nompozola's ambition, however, had always been to study medicine. In 1937, after completing the first year of science course, she applied to the University of St Andrews to study medicine but was rejected on the grounds that the university did not recognise the South African Native College. Her examination passes  were however recognised by the School of Medicine of the Scottish Medical Royal Colleges, to which she successfully applied to study medicine. As the first black women to do this her story was reported in the press.“Before she sailed for Europe she was met at nearly every railway station by teachers, journalists and clergymen who wished her Godspeed”. (The Daily Colonist, July 1938)\n\n\n== Medical education ==\nThe Principal of the School of Medicine,  Professor John Orr accepted her application and arranged for her to be admitted as a medical student to Anderson’s College, Glasgow, where she studied anatomy and physiology, with further classes then being taken at St Mungo’s College, Glasgow, both part of the extramural school. Her clinical training was carried out at Glasgow Royal Infirmary and the Western Infirmary, the two main Glasgow teaching hospitals. \nShe qualified as a doctor with the Triple Qualification in 1942.\n\n\n== Medical career ==\nShe received funding to travel to Dublin for postgraduate courses in midwifery and paediatrics. \nIn 1953 she was a house surgeon at the St Charles Hospital in West London.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Caritas Colombia (Spanish: Cáritas Colombiana, officially Pastoral Social Cáritas Colombiana) is a Colombian nonprofit organisation. It is the official aid organisation of the Catholic Church in Colombia.\nThe organisation is a member of the global Caritas Internationalis confederation and of Caritas Latin America and Caribbean.\nCaritas Colombia is a network of different structures. The national secretarit is known as Secretariado Nacional de Pastoral Social (SNPS).\n\n\n== Background ==\nSince 1913, the Colombian Episcopal Conference has been promoting social welfare activities in the country. In 1956, during the civil war, the Bishops decided to establish Caritas Colombia as the coordinating body of Catholic social work. It was decided that this body was to report to the Social Pastoral and Charitable Commission of the Bishops' Conference.\nDuring its first years of existence, the work of Caritas was focused on food distributions to people in need in parishes. In the 1960s, Caritas Colombia started creating special \"food houses\". In the backdrop of evolving political dynamics within the country, new challenges emerged; in rural areas, the ongoing clash between guerrilla groups and armed forces prompted the Church to take initiatives to support rural families, including helping them to increase their agricultural output.\nOn 4 August 1977, the National Secretariat of Social Pastoral (SNPS) was legally created to coordinate the pastoral care activities and to promote integral human development. Around that time, the organisation also started supporting those affected by natural disasters and displacement. Caritas Colombia was involved in the relief and reconstruction efforts for the victims of the Popayán earthquake and the victims of the 1985 Armero tragedy. \nIn 1982, Caritas Colombia launched its first fundraising campaign during lent. In the 1990s, urban violence caused by drug trafficking became a major issue in the country, to which the organisation adapted by starting to implement peacebuilding projects and being involved in truth and reconciliation initiatives. At the same time, it continued to provide humanitarian aid to populations affected by natural disasters. In 1996, it co-founded the Working Group for Colombia (GTC) to strengthen the SNPS's work for peacebuilding and reconciliation. In 2000, it convened the first National Congress of Reconciliation. \n\n\n== Structure and work ==\nThe organisation is structured into 10 regions grouping 13 archdioceses, 52 dioceses, 10 apostolic vicariates and one military ordinariate.\nIn 2023, Caritas Colombia implemented 62 projects in 51 geographical areas of ecclesiastical jurisdictions, with a total budget of almost 66 billion Colombian peso.\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in Spanish)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "José Ambrosio Brunetti y Gayeso, 15th Duke of Arcos GE (6 February 1839 – 5 September 1928) was a Spanish aristocrat and diplomat who served as Minister Plenipotentiary in Bolivia, Uruguay, Chile, Mexico, the United States and Belgium, and ambassador to Italy and Russia. He was also an important benefactor of the Prado Museum, to which he made a posthumous bequest of ten paintings, including Young Man with a Feather Hat, by Pieter Hermansz Verelst.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBrunetti was born on 6 February 1839 in Pisa, Tuscany. He was the son of María Josefa Gayoso y Téllez-Girón and Count Lázaro Brunetti (1781–1838), who was originally from Massa and who served Austrian ambassador in Madrid during most of the reign of King Ferdinand VII. In 1834, his father had been raised to the rank of count of the Austrian Empire by Emperor Francis I. His mother was considered one of the \"most admired and celebrated Camarasa sisters\", daughters of the Marchionesses of Camarasa and granddaughters of the influential María Josefa Pimentel, Duchess of Osuna. Although his father was later assigned to the Court of Turin, his family remained in Madrid. José, the only boy, was the last of the five children of his parents and, a few months after his birth, lost his father after Count Brunetti died in Castelfranco, near Florence, in December 1839.\nIn 1847, his mother remarried to Fernando de Nieulant y Sanchez-Pleités, son of the Counts of Nieulant, later Marquesses of Sotomayor, and entered the service of the Spanish Royal family: appointed Lady-in-Waiting to the Queen Isabella II in charge of Infanta María del Pilar.​ The Marchioness of Sotomayor died in June 1866, shortly after the death of her first-born daughter, Sofía. Later, and through his maternal ancestry, José Brunetti was able to access the distribution of the numerous titles of his uncle, Mariano Téllez-Girón, 12th Duke of Osuna (and 14th Duke of Arcos), who died without issue in 1882, and managed to succeed him as Duke of Arcos in 1892. Likewise, his sisters Cristina, who married politician Fermín de Lasala, and Laura, respectively became Duchesses of Mandas and Monteagudo.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAfter graduating with degrees in Civil and Canon Law from the Complutense University of Madrid, he began a diplomatic career in 1862, following in his father's footsteps. In his youth he was attached to the Spanish legations in Austria (in 1864), Italy (from 1866 to 1869), Switzerland (from 1869 to 1876) and the United States (from 1877 to 1882).​ In 1882, he was promoted to Minister Plenipotentiary and assigned to direct the Spanish legation in Bolivia, followed by those in Uruguay (from 1890 to 1891), Chile (from 1891 to 1894) and Mexico (from 1894 to 1897). In 1899, he returned to Washington as Minister, and was the first Spanish representative in North America once diplomatic relations were resumed after the Treaty of Paris, which ended the Spanish-American War of 1898. He was formally received by President William McKinley on 3 June 1899 in the \"Blue Parlor\" of the White House. While in the United States, he lived at 1785 Massachusetts Avenue in Washington, D.C.\nIn 1902, he was transferred to Belgium, followed by Russia in 1904, both with the rank of Ambassador. His last posting was as Ambassador to Italy, which he held from 1905 until his resignation in 1907.\n\n\n=== Titles and peerages ===\nAfter the death of the childless 12th Duke of Osuna in 1882, his relatives divided up the many titles accumulated in the House of Osuna, which had been joined by those of Infantado, Benavente, Béjar and others among the Spanish nobility. Brunetti, nephew  of the 12th Duke of Osuna, ran as heir to the historic duchy of Arcos, but other family members preceded him in formally requesting succession to the title before the Ministry of Grace and Justice: the Marquess of Castillo del Valle de Sidueña and the Marquess of Alventos, descendants of minor branches of the Ponce de León, the original lineage of the House of Arcos. Alventos managed to obtain a Royal Charter of Succession in the title in 1886, but it was immediately suspended due to the lawsuit that he had continued with Brunetti since 1884,​ and which was resolved in his favor by a ruling in January 1892. Thus, his notorious better right as great-grandson of the Duchess of Osuna, who was herself, in addition to Countess of Benavente, 12th Duchess of Arcos, prevailed over the distant genealogical connection of Alventos with the medieval Counts of Arcos.\nAfter eight years of litigation, on 9 June 1892, Brunetti was officially invested with the title of Duke of Arcos and the Grandee of Spain. He never claimed, however, the rest of the dignities of the House of Arcos: the Marquessate of Zahara, traditionally held by the first-born sons of the Dukes, and the Counties of Casares and Bailén, so these titles were dispersed among various descendants of the Duchess of Osuna.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nWhen he arrived in Washington as Secretary of the Embassy in 1877, Brunetti met Virginia Woodbury \"Ginny\" Lowery (1855–1935), daughter of the wealthy businessman Archibald H. Lowery, and granddaughter on her maternal side of Levi Woodbury, who was Secretary of the Treasury, U.S. Senator, Governor of New Hampshire, and Justice of the Supreme Court. Her parents opposed her courtship with Count Brunetti, a young diplomat without fortune, and although they also disapproved of his main rival, a naval officer who would eventually become the famous Admiral George Dewey, they preferred him because he was American. Virginia, however, secretly became engaged to Brunetti, but did not want to marry against the opposition of her father. After leaving for successive destinations in Latin America, and after succeeding to the dukedom, in 1895, almost two decades later, her father withdrew his veto, and the couple married in October 1895 at the Lowerys' summer home in New London, Connecticut.\nThe Duke reportedly fought a duel with the Marquis of Aguada in France and \"wounded his adversary three times, in the wrist and forearm.\"\n\n\n=== Philanthropy ===\n\nIn 1910, in honor of the Duchess' brother, Woodbury Lowery, the Duke and Duchess gave $20,000 to Harvard University \"the income of which is to be used for research in history, preferably American history in the archives of foreign countries and more particularly in Spain.\" Upon her death, the Duchess left an additional $50,000 to Harvard to be added to the trust fund for the Woodbury Lowery fellowship.\nUpon his death in 1928, the Duke made a bequest of ten paintings to the Prado Museum, including Young Man with a Feather Hat, by Pieter Hermansz Verelst (which was then attributed to Godfried Schalcken), a male portrait considered the work of Carlo Ceresa (then believed to be by Velázquez), and a portrait of Queen Marie Leszczyńska by Jean-Marc Nattier. As the Duke stipulated that his wife keep them in usufruct until his death, the donation did not become effective until the Duchess of Arcos died at Palazzo Brancaccio, her home in Rome, on 13 March 1935. The legacy was then officially accepted by the government of the Second Republic, and the works entered the Prado collections. The Duchess left a large collection of pictures, and fans, to the National Gallery in Washington and a number of pictures, including works by Henry Raeburn, Lebruns, and Greuzes (as well as Portrait of a Princess of France as Diana by Philippe Vignon), to the Prado.\n\n\n== Family tree ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of dukes in the peerage of Spain\n\n\n== References ==\nNotes\n\nSources",

        "content": "John McBride (1651? – 21 July 1718) was an Irish minister of the Presbyterian General Synod of Ulster and religious controversialist.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMcBride was born in Ulster about 1651. He was probably the son of John McBryde, a merchant, who was admitted a free stapler of Belfast on 6 March 1644, and who signed the covenant at Holywood, County Down, on 8 April 1644. John entered the university of Glasgow in 1666, signing himself ‘Johannes McBryd, Hybernus,’ and graduated on 15 July 1673. In 1680 he received presbyterian ordination as minister of Clare, co. Armagh. He left Ireland during the troubles of 1688 and became minister of Borgue, Kirkcudbrightshire. In 1691 he received a call to Ayr, but the presbytery decided against his translation; he sat as a member of the general assembly in 1692. He was called to Belfast as successor to Patrick Adair and installed there on 3 October 1694. Soon after his settlement, he obtained a considerable plot of ground in Rosemary Lane, on which his congregation erected a new meeting-house, removing to it about 1695 from their old one in North Street. There being as yet no Irish toleration act, the congregation held this property on goodwill; no lease was granted till 1767. McBride exerted himself at Dublin in September 1695 to obtain a legal toleration; in his phrase, his efforts were ‘drowned with court holy water.’ He came out as an author in 1697, defending a plea for toleration by Joseph Boyse. In the same year, he was moderator of the general synod of Ulster. His sermon on retiring from the chair on 1 June 1698 was printed without his concurrence; the title-page styled him ‘minister of Belfast;’ on 10 October he appeared on summons before the lords justices in Dublin, at the instance of five bishops, to answer for this and other enormities. The lords justices dismissed the case, ‘with an advice to him and his brethren to carry rectably towards the established church, and to them [the bishops] to carry moderately.’ The renewed patent for the ‘regium donum’ was lodged in his hands in 1699. A few years later he published (1702) a spirited defence of the validity of presbyterian marriages.\nMcBride was a strong advocate of the Hanoverian succession, but scrupled at the oath of abjuration (declaring the Pretender to be no son of James II) imposed in 1703. By the advice of the Belfast presbytery, he summoned the general synod to meet at Antrim on 1 June 1703, six weeks before the appointed time, in order to consider the oath, which was to be taken by 1 August. Several leading presbyterians were non-abjurors; McBride avoided the oath by retiring to Glasgow, where in 1704 he made a gift of books to the university library. (The oath was not imposed in Scotland till 1712.) On 19 October a committee of the Irish House of Commons recommended that he be deprived of ‘regium donum;’ but this was not done. He was back in Belfast before the synod of June 1704. In the winter of 1705, information was sworn against him as a non-abjuror before the Rev. John Winder, J.P., at Carnmoney, co. Antrim. He escaped in disguise and proceeded to Glasgow by way of Donaghadee. McBride was three years in Glasgow, exercising his ministry there, but retaining his charge in Belfast, and refusing a divinity chair at Glasgow University. On 4 June 1706 the synod gave order for the appointment of James Kirkpatrick as his assistant and successor. The whole available stipend was 160l. Irish, or 147l. 13s. 10¼d. sterling. McBride wrote from Stranraer on 18 June to his Belfast flock, advising that as there were ‘three thousand persons’ in the congregation, there should be two meeting-houses as well as two ministers. Kirkpatrick was appointed on 24 September, and by June 1708 a second meeting-house was erected, in the rear of the first, and on the same plot of ground. The synod of 1708, after long debates at the ordinary and a special meeting, agreed to divide the congregation, assigning the first meeting-house, with the manse, to McBride, and sending him ‘a kind affectionate letter,’ inviting and requiring him ‘to come home so soon as he can.’ Samuel Smith, one of his elders, went to Glasgow for him. As moderator of the Glasgow presbytery he had signed in March an address to the queen, expressing abhorrence of the attempt of the French fleet upon the Scottish coast in the Pretender's interest. Returning to Ireland, he appeared before the justices at Carrickfergus, and was discharged without trial. In August 1711 a warrant was issued by Westenra Waring, high sheriff of county Antrim, and another justice for the arrest of McBride and other ministers as non-abjurors. At the spring assizes 1712, they were presented by the grand jury of county Antrim as disloyal men. McBride crossed over to Scotland at the beginning of May. According to William Bruce, Thomas Milling had been appointed his colleague in 1711; there is no trace of this name in the synod records. The general synod which met at Belfast in June resolved, in reference to the oath, that all ministers ‘who've not taken the same be advis'd (if they have clearness to do it) to take it as soon and in as private a way as they can.’ The same meeting renewed an appointment previously made, authorising McBride to compile ‘an history of this church,’ and desiring Kirkpatrick to assist him. McBride's next and last publication had an historical bearing; more was done by Kirkpatrick.\nOn 8 June 1713 McBride returned to Belfast for the last time; he was not again seriously molested, for though the high sheriff gave orders for his apprehension, the sub-sheriff, Jeremy Phillips, took care not to find him. He was evidently a popular man, and manuscript reports of his discourses, show him to have been an able preacher. Bruce's statement that he ‘prepared students for the ministry,’ if correct, refers probably to work done in Glasgow. His portrait bears out Kirkpatrick's account of him as ‘of a pleasant temper,’ and one who ‘can't baulk his jest.’ For the truth of one of the stories of his humour we have his own authority. Asked by a clergyman of Down why he would not abjure the Pretender, he replied ‘that once upon a time there was a bearn, that cou'd not be persuaded to bann the de'el, because he did not know but he might soon come into his clutches.’ During the winter of 1713–14 he complained to his friend Robert Wodrow, ‘that lordly prelate, gout, hath kept me his prisoner in Cripplegate.’ By 1718 he was in very infirm health. He attended the general synod at Belfast on 17 June, when a call to John Abernethy, as his assistant and successor, failed to obtain synodical sanction. He died on 21 July 1718, ‘ætatis suæ 68,’ and was buried on 23 July in the old churchyard of Belfast (site of the present St. George's), where a red marble tombstone, not now extant, bore a Latin inscription which is preserved. Margaret McBride, whose recipe-book, dated 1714, is in the possession of Robert M. Young of Belfast, was probably his wife. For his son Robert, see below. His portrait was sold by mistake with his furniture during his residence in Glasgow; many years after it was recovered in an auction room, and presented to his surviving daughter, Mrs. Dyatt; it became the property of the first presbyterian church of Belfast; it bears the marks of the ‘sovereign,’ or mayor of Belfast, who thrust his rapier through the cambric band when searching the manse for him in 1705.\nHe published: \n\n‘Animadversions on the Defence of the Answer to … “The Case of the Dissenting Protestants of Ireland … together with an Answer to a Peaceable and Friendly Address,”’ &c., 1697, 4to (anon.; no place or printer's name; the ‘Defence’ was by Tobias Pullen, bishop of Dromore; the ‘Address’ by Edward Synge, afterwards archbishop of Tuam, who replied).\n‘A Sermon before the Provincial Synod at Antrim … by Mr. John Mac-Bride,’ &c., 1698, 4to (no place or printer's name).\n‘A Vindication of Marriage as solemnised by Presbyterians in the North of Ireland. … By a Minister of the Gospel,’ &c., 1702, 4to (anon.; no place or printer's name; answers were published in 1704, anon., by Ralph Lambert, afterwards bishop of Meath, and in 1705 by Synge). It has been conjectured that the above three tracts were printed in Belfast; accordingly they are included in John Anderson's ‘Catalogue of Early Belfast Printed Books,’ 1890; it seems more probable that they were printed in Glasgow.\n‘A Sample of Jet-black Pr——tic Calumny, in answer to … “A Sample of True-blue Presbyterian Loyalty,”’ &c., Glasgow, 1713, 4to (anon.; has been assigned to others [see William Jameson]; the ‘Wodrow Correspondence’ proves McBride's authorship; it was in the press in February, and printed by the end of May; the ‘True-blue Presbyterian,’ Dublin, 1709, 4to, was by William Tisdall, D.D., vicar of Belfast). As a controversialist McBride is inferior to Tisdall, and as an historian to Kirkpatrick; his treatise preserves a few important documents.\nRobert McBride (1687–1759), son of the above, was born at Clare in 1687. On 28 May 1716 he preached in his father's meeting-house a sermon on George I's birthday, at the request of the Belfast Independent Volunteers. He was ordained on 26 September 1716, by Coleraine presbytery, as minister of Ballymoney, co. Antrim, in succession to Hugh Kirkpatrick, father of James, mentioned above. In the synodical controversies of 1720–6 he took the side of subscription. He died on 2 Sept. 1759, in his seventy-third year, and was buried in Ballymoney churchyard; there is an inscribed tablet to his memory in the parish church. His two sons, David and John, are separately noticed. He published: 1. ‘A Sermon,’ &c., Belfast, 1716, 8vo. 2. ‘The Overtures … in a fair light, in answer to Mr. Higinbotham,’ &c., Belfast, 1726, 4to. (Robert Higinbotham was presbyterian minister of Coleraine.)\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1893). \"McBride, John\".

        "content": "Lebanon Valley Speedway is a ½ mile high banked dirt oval raceway in West Lebanon, New York. The complex also includes a quarter-mile dragway and a go-kart track.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Lebanon Valley Speedway was built in 1953 by a Massachusetts group consisting of Edward Radke, Robert Scott and Harold Beitzel on land leased from the Lou Spanier family.  In 1954, Spanier gained ownership of the facilities, and in 1963 added the dragstrip to the complex.  Spanier served as promoter until 1970 when his nephew, Howard Commander took over the operations.\n\n\n== Events ==\nThe Lebanon Valley Speedway hosts auto racing on Saturday nights throughout the summer.  There are seven racing divisions — big block modifieds, small block modifieds; sportsman, prostock, limited sportsman; super stocks, and four-cylinder competition.  The speedway also holds special events such as Monster trucks, as well as their 'Eve Of Destruction' which includes a school bus race, trailer race and demolition derby.  In addition to traditional drag racing, the dragstrip presents \"drifting\" events on several days during the summer.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Lily Perry (Hebrew: לילי פרי; born 1953) is an Israeli writer, novelist, editor, and critic. She is the founder and editor of “Totem Books” publishing house and “Salonet” literature site.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nLily Perry is the first child of Romanian-born parents. Her father was a prisoner in a concentration camp during World War II, and her mother made Aliyah to Mandatory Palestine before the war. She was born in Hadera to impoverished parents, wandering the country searching for a steady income. The family settled at Netanya, where Lily grew up since she was nine. She was a youth guide at Sde Boker in her mandatory army service at the Israel Defense Forces. She earned a BA in general and Judaist philosophy from Tel Aviv University.\nPerry started writing professionally in 1973 as a journalist and editor in HaOlam HaZeh, Al HaMishmar and Yedioth Ahronoth, which was Israel's largest newspaper by circulation. In Yedioth Ahronoth, she wrote the column “Figure”, about famous historical couples, especially women. She was the editor and writer of the “Persona” section in Al HaMishmar.\nDuring 1978–1996, she worked as a Humanities and Social science editor at the Open University of Israel. She was a news editor for Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper and Yedioth Books  and a writing workshop instructor.\nSince 1978 till today (2024), Perry has worked as a book editor in the genres of non-fiction, prose, and Poetry. In 2012, she established with Prof. Dan Miron and the writer Iftach Alony “Afik Books” publishing house.\nIn 2002, she received the Olschwang Award; in 2006, she won the Prime Minister's Prize for Hebrew Literary Works.\nIn 2013, she left Afik and established “Totem Books” publishing house, and serves as its editor-in-chief. Since 2015, she has been editor-in-chief of “Salonet” literature site.\nPerry published seven books, six novels, and one \"Petty Whims\" with Yoram Barak, a non-fiction book. Her second book, \"Golem in the Circle,\" was published in five editions in Keter Publishing House and sold 5,000 copies; it was published again in Yedioth Books in 2007. It was adapted into an award-winning movie under that name in 1993, including the Ophir Award, Wolgin Award for Israeli Cinema, Festival du cinéma méditerranéen de Montpellier Award, and the Uruguay International Film Festival award. and dramatized and presented as a one-woman play performed in Theatronetto, Tzavta, and Omanut Laam.\nHer book, “Swans in Jerusalem beach”, was included among the twelve finalists in the long list of Sapir Prize 2020.\nProf. Gabriel Moked delineated her artistic perspective and themes: \"This author is one of the most promising forces in our literature… One of the main spirits in our feminine literature… More than any other narrator, she deals with the socio-economic spheres in Israel… Her novels depict a salient female character… Who is struggling in her social realms… The male characters are divided into two categories: the first category is \"the bad guys\" who misunderstand the women and strive to control them in relationships or public officials or mobs that get in the female's way and make their lives hard. The second category is supported men, whom the females alienate as their suitors... we can notice in her novels interactions between realism and fantasy...  another feature in her novels is presenting the plots from the character's point of view. Sometimes, we can understand who his voice is, and  more frequently, it seems like an anonymous point of view, at least at  first sight; as the novel developed, the figure's nature unraveled.\"\n\n\n== Family ==\nLily Perry is remarried, lives in Tel Aviv, and has two sons.\n\n\n== Her Books ==\nBare Eyes, Bustan Books, 1974.\nGolem in the Circle, Keter Publishing House, 1988; published in five editions.\nDancing on the Water, Hakibbutz Hameuchad - Sifriat Poalim Publishing House, 1994.\nThe Executioner’s Visit, Yedioth Books, 1999.\nPetty Whims (with Yoram Barak), Yedioth Books, 2004.\nGolem in the Circle, a new edition, Yedioth Books, 2007; with a foreword by prof.

        "content": "The Water Was So Clear (餓鬼草紙, Gaki zôshi) is a 1973 drama film directed by Yoichi Takabayashi. It was released in Japan on April 14, 1973. It was chosen to be shown at Critics' Week at the 1973 Cannes Film Festival and won the grand prize at the 1973 Mannheim-Heidelberg International Filmfestival.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe Water Was So Clear develops its plot dispensing with dialogue, except for the monk's prayers. The soundtrack is full of the sounds of nature (heavy rain, thunder) and of the household chores, in the sequences set in the monastery; and urban traffic and modern music in the scenes set in the city. The sexual moans of the girl spark the torment of the priest's soul.\nOn a rainy day a homeless girl is rescued by a Buddhist priest. An extreme close-up of the barrel of a shotgun, perhaps announcing the death of the priest, triggers the city scenes. One day a young man follows her into the monastery grounds and rapes her. They become lovers. The priest sees them on the beach first, and then making love in her room, and becomes a sexually aroused tortured soul. After masturbation, his semen falls on the head of a Buddha statue. The couple leaves, the priest dies, and the old caretaker closes the monastery gates.\nThis plot is narrated through elegant camera movements and the contraposition of the contemplative life in the monastery and the crowded and noisy activities of the city.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe Water Was So Clear was given a positive review in Variety.\n\n\n== Title ==\n\nThe original title, Gaki zôshi (Tales of Hungry Ghosts), comes from a narrative scroll, produced in the late Heian period (794–1185) and kept at the Tokyo National Museum, which depicts spirits condemned to eternal hunger and thirst, referred to as hungry ghosts.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Water Was So Clear at IMDb",

        "content": "James Taylor (1839–1898) was an English-born ceramicist who is considered \"the father of the American architectural terra cotta industry.\"\n\n\n== Biography ==\nTaylor was born in England and experienced in architectural terracotta manufacturing there, acting as superintendent of J.M. Blashfield & Company for five years. He emigrated to the United States in 1870 and immediately encountered stubborn misconceptions about terracotta's suitability for use in the United States, with many architects advising him to return to England.\nAfter having no luck finding financing for a new company in New York City, Taylor traveled west and replaced the superintendent of the Chicago Terra Cotta Company. Terracotta manufacture was new to Chicago, but the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 demonstrated the flaws of presumed fireproof materials such as stone and iron and increased demand for brick and clay products. The Chicago Terra Cotta Company had formed a few years earlier but its first superintendent, Giovanni Meli, did not have previous experience producing architectural terra cotta and lacked technical skills.\nAfter his hiring in Chicago, Taylor introduced English methods for preparing clay and producing terracotta, employing muffle kilns in what is believed to be their first use in the United States. Whereas many American architects initially considered terracotta to be a decorative element, Taylor promoted its use for entire building facades.\nTaylor's family settled on a farm in Port Monmouth, New Jersey and while there he worked with his friend Edward Adolphus Spring to form Eagleswood Art Pottery, which was one of the first institutes in the United States to offer an education in making ceramics.\nIn 1878 Taylor moved to Boston to operate the Chicago Terra Cotta Company's new Boston branch and worked there until it closed the next year. By 1880 he had been recruited by another new company; the Boston Terra Cotta Company. His work there allowed him to spend many weekends at home with his family in New Jersey.\nWhile working for the Boston Terra Cotta Company, Taylor helped produce 540 tons of terracotta for use on Orlando Potter's Potter Building in New York City. Potter was so impressed by the use of terracotta that after the building's completion in 1886 he recruited Taylor to help form the New York Architectural Terra-Cotta Company, which became one of the largest manufacturers in the country. Taylor was a proponent of the company's urban location, feeling that unfired clay was cheaper to transport than fired pieces.\nTaylor remained with the New York company for several years and helped them achieve success, even acting as a guest modeler and leaving his signature on a terracotta fireplace in the company office. In 1893 he left after his health began to fail and retired to his farm in New Jersey, where he remained until his death in 1898.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nTaylor was widely considered to be the leading authority on architectural terracotta and many contemporary accounts described him as being always willing to share knowledge and help those looking to improve their product. Surviving letters revealed that he provided lengthy written advice to competitor Gladding, McBean while working at the New York Architectural Terra Cotta Company, and he was likely paid to do so.\nTaylor's work in promoting terracotta production within the United States played a key role in establishing its usefulness and suitability for American architecture. Much of the success of the architectural ceramics industry around the turn of the century can be traced to innovations and techniques introduced by Taylor. The Clay-Worker, a trade journal of the time, wrote that \"what Mr. Taylor don't know about terra cotta is not worth knowing.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

He was the first democratically elected mayor of his home city in the 1979 Spanish local elections. He was sworn into office with the support of the 13 city councillors from his party and the six from the Communist Party of Spain (PCE), thus outvoting the 13 members of the Union of the Democratic Centre (UCD). \nMartínez Castellano reflected in 2019 that when he arrived at the mayor's office, it only had a table with no drawers, an FC Bayern Munich pennant and a red sofa kept for sentimental reasons as Francisco Franco had once sat there. The city council had a deficit of 3 billion Spanish pesetas (€18 million) and outstanding bills since 1972. The new administration took possession of landmarks such as the Museo de la Ciudad de Valencia, and halted building projects in favour of green spaces. Martínez Castellano faced an attempted bombing of his home in his first week in office.\nDays after taking office, Martínez Castellano was able to pass a two-thirds majority with support from the UCD to ask for a loan of 1.528 billion pesetas. On 11 June 1979, he hosted a meeting of the mayors of the 20 biggest cities, in which Narcis Serra advocated for financial reform to combat a shared debt that was forecast to reach 400 billion pesetas by the end of the year. The mayors met the prime minister of Spain Adolfo Suárez the next day. In September 1979, Martínez Castellano attended the 28th PSOE congress, where he was part of the \"critical\" sector against leader Felipe González's proposal to remove Marxism from the party's ideology; González resigned as a result. Due to this position, Martínez Castellano was expelled from the Socialist Party of the Valencian Country (PSPV), resigned from office, and was replaced by the second name on the PSOE list for the election, Ricard Pérez Casado.\nMartínez Castellano returned to politics for the 2007 Valencia City Council election with the Social Democratic Party. Initially the lead candidate, he was finally listed as second.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive was a major offensive against Russian forces occupying its territory with a goal of breaching the front lines. Efforts were made in many directions, primarily in Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts, among others. In total, Ukraine recaptured 14 villages in Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts, with a total pre-war population of around 5,000 but took heavy casualties. Western officials have said that such losses were not unexpected for attacking forces. The counteroffensive was widely regarded as a failure but also a crucial moment in the war.\n\n\n== Ukrainian forces ==\n Ukrainian Armed Forces\n\n Ukrainian Ground Forces\n 3rd Assault Brigade - Andriy Biletsky\n 5th Assault Brigade - Oleksandr Yakovenko\n 21st Mechanized Brigade\n 23rd Mechanized Brigade\n 30th Mechanized Brigade - Colonel Ihor Dovhan\n 31st Mechanized Brigade\n 32nd Mechanized Brigade - Denis Merzlikin\n 42nd Mechanized Brigade\n 43rd Mechanized Brigade\n 47th Mechanized Brigade - Lt.

        "content": "Almost all PoW camps distilled and brew alcohol. Brewing and distilling of moonshine in Oflag IV-C (Colditz) was a pastime. In 1941, the Polish contingent did the bootlegging. They used yeast and Red Cross sugar to rustle up luxurious prison made concoctions.\nNotable distillers later established themselves in the Schloss such as Michael Farr. Farr's family ran Hawkers Gin (the only gin with a Royal warrant) and he added his craft.  He made a wine dubbed  \"Château Colditz\".  George Drew,  Pat Ferguson  were also notable distillers. In 1942, Albert van Rood, John Dickinson and Bush Parker brew and distilled moonshine. Prisoners formed firms and in 1942, firms like the Colditz Distilling Company were established.\nEarlier stills produced ailments from the impurities. Black teeth and temporary blindness seemed commonplace.\n\n\n== Early distilling in the camp ==\nThe Poles first distilled and stashed alcohol in 1941.  And many distillers and brewers of alcohol, with various levels of ability, practiced their game.\nEarlier stills lacked refinement. And no means of mass production presented itself. A bad drink caused black teeth and a swollen tongue. Blurred vision often resulted after a drink and sometimes drinkers could not see their limbs and digits. These impairments were temporary. One prisoner developed cirrhosis. Though no one succumbed from alcohol poisoning. A former medical student Peter Storie-Pugh, noted, in moderation the liqueur had a good effect on morale. This medic's testimony was enough justification for the lads.\n\n\n== Notable brewers ==\n \nThere were numerous distillers of note. George Drew and Pat Ferguson brew alcohol.  Distillers such as Michael Farr from the Hawkers Gin firm added input. Farr made a professional standard wine. They called this concoction — \"Château Colditz\". The lads were not taking the mick naming the wine.  A Saxony wine region classic made with Red Cross parcel raisins. A  noble rot wine. Farr's wine tasted superior; it made Christmas 1942 better. \n\nIn 1942, using new techniques, van Rood disrupted; he and the mess lads could have a concoction ready in hours.\n\n\n== Colditz Distilling Company ==\nIn 1942 Albert van Rood opened up a distilling firm. He, Vincent Parker and John Dickinson created the synergy for the going concern. Parker traded with a Colditz guard who handled fuel. The literature highlights, nuanced interplay between van Rood, Dickinson and Parker. \nThe distillery churned a constant stock supply; almost becoming a monopoly.\n\n\n=== Operations ===\nJulius Green trained in medicine. A dentist from Glasgow. Protected personnel according to the Geneva Convention. A man with a code of conduct; he could not do something like this. He merely associated himself to the mess lads drinking the nightcaps. \n\n \nSome of the lads knew Green in an informal way. Christening him 'Toothy'. Those who knew him less, he was the 'Toothwright'. Or the 'Fucking Toothwright'. Green made do with the equipment they gave him. What you thought of him depended on the pliers. Sometimes, though, it was the snide pain killer strength. Green was self-deprecating; either a great lad, or a sadistic shithouse. He noted that drinking establishment well.\n\n \nAll clandestine, the Colditz Distilling Company claimed others. Green highlighted the Canadian 'Scarlet' O'Hara, contributed in the background and foreground. The distillery involved Polish officer Tony Karpf. The mess lads called him the 'The Fish'. Later, the Wehrmacht moved on the Poles. And after Colditz, The Fish, a noted escaper, made a home run from another camp.\n\n\n=== Experience ===\nThree realms of reality manifested from that experience of consumption. Some chose a constant state of inebriation and others went teetotal and strenuously latched on to the sobriety. Finally, no one fancied the hangover—'no man's land'.\n\n\n=== Objections ===\n Green highlighted the newer distillery caused envy. Lags complained they held that luxury hostage. They terrorised a harmless enterprise, hurting the emotional state of the mess lads. The mess lads argued with the gobshites. \n\nStressing, fighting or debating and arguing, they all made compromises. Keen on this benevolent endeavour, Bag Dickinson borrowed the castle's plumbing. Bag secured the metal containers and tubing ensuring the distillery grew at speed. The vindictive gobshites who opposed this enterprise: they reached contrition. Contented and settled; after they liberated the calorific delicacies from the mess and distillery.\n\n\n=== Trade ===\n\nThe distillery traded and bartered. The company maintained a surplus stock for profit selling a selection of liqueur. Distillers attempted knockoff drinks like grog, whisky, vodka, crème de menthe, white schnapps and gin. A shovel of coal secured a cheap drink for a miser.\n\n\n=== Drinking ===\nA brewery piss-up lasted from Boxing day 1943 till 29 February, 1944. Van Rood's company also profited from this.\nIn spring 1944, Parker was steadfast; they celebrated the ANZACs (see: Anzac Day).\nThey celebrated holidays of all nationalities. Open to all religious festivals. A lad went to the cooler—they drank. A lad went to a Leipzig court martial, they commiserated. They would have a bash for the lads coming from the cooler. They had drinks for escapers, going home. \n\n\n== Critics ==\nThe brewers and distillers tried their best. And all PoW camps had liqueur critics and wine stewards in the numbers.\nOne wine steward was sick of it. The lad threw shade at Farr's superior Chateau Colditz. In 1942 he noted, there was plenty of the stuff; great for Christmas. But snided the drink was terrible. It could blow your fucking head off. They could do better than that.\nRex Harrison and Bush Parker were old mates. Harrison was candid on his great Aussie mate's grog experiment. The grog, it — \"tasted of cats piss, it could burn a hole in steel plates. There would be fewer casualties if water broke it down.\"\n\n\n== Eggers and the security squads ==\nThe prison command suspected concealed drinking establishments. Making assumptions, they believed with an intensity this would hinder escaping. They were wrong. Despite the extra security and surveillance, no camp had more escape attempts than Schloss Colditz.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\n \nDrinkers met up post war. Karpf and Green never met inside the Schloss. Post war, Karpf married a Glaswegian lass. And once or twice a year, Green would meet 'The Fish'. They would reminisce about Colditz and the lads lost in the conflict. He'd sample Karpf's refined distillery and hospitality.\n\n\n== See also ==\nReinhold Eggers The security officer of Colditz from November 1940 to April 1945.\nJulius Green, an associate to the mess.

He traveled to Mexico from Spain in 1588, together with fellow Jesuit missionary Pedro de Hortigosa. After spending some time at Jesuit colleges, first as a student and then as a teacher, Santarén proceeded to Sinaloa along with fellow missionary Pedro Mendez. He spent some time en route at San Andrés de Nava, and arrived at his destination on June 29, 1594, immediately before the death of Gonzalo de Tapia.\nSantarén was assigned to Mission San Pedro y Pablo de Guasave and Mission San Miguel de Ures from 1594 to 1597. In 1598, he was reassigned to Topia and founded the San Andrés mission there.\nIn 1600, with military support from the encomendero Diego de Avila, Santarén mounted a \"pacification and conversion campaign\" against the native Guazapare, Chínipa, Acaxee, and Tepehuán peoples. Avila forced natives in each town to kneel to Santarén or kiss his hand, and then watch while soldiers destroyed and burned their sacred objects and venerated bones. Afterwards, the natives were forcibly relocated to Jesuit reductions.\nSantarén was killed in the 1616 Tepehuán Revolt, along with seven other Jesuits.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "William Maxwell, 5th Lord Herries of Terregles (died 1603) was a Scottish politician and landowner.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMaxwell was the eldest son of John, fourth lord Herries, by his wife Agnes, daughter of the third Lord Herries. While still Master of Herries he was, on 15 October 1580, elected a gentleman of the chamber (Reg. P. C. Scotl. iii. 323). On 26 January 1582-3 he was chosen a member of the privy council in place of his father, who died on the 20th (ib. p. 548). On 9 June 1587 he became warden of the Avest march (ib. iv. 188). On 31 January following he was, however, denounced a rebel for not entering before the council certain of his dependents charged with oppression and depredations (ib. p. 244), and on 5 February was again summoned to appear before the council on 5 March (ib. p. 248). On the 20th the general assembly also handed in a complaint against him and others for attending mass in Dumfries (Calderwood, iv. 657) ; but already on 16 February he had made his submission to the king (ib. p. 677). On 3 March he was therefore released from the horn (Rey. P. C. Scotl. iv. 258) ; and on the 5th he came under an obligation neither to hear nor suffer mass to be said within his wardening, and also to repair to the kirk of Dumfries for the hearing of the sermons (ib. p. 259). On 1 Aug. 1588 he was appointed a commissioner for executing the act against the Spanish Armada.\nAbout 14 October 1595 Herries, to avenge the slaughter of John, seventh or eighth lord Maxwell in 1593, came in command of about three hundred of the Maxwells to Lockerbie to attack the Johnstones, but the latter had much the best of the encounter, many of the Maxwells being slain, and others taken prisoner (Moysie, Memoirs, pp. 124-5 ; Calderwood, v. 385). On 8 March 1595-6 he appeared before the council, and protested that by his assurance to Sir James Johnstone he should not be answerable for certain Maxwells, and that he did not include in the assurance any of the Johnstones who had taken part in the late conflict (Reg. P. C. Scotl. v. 280). On 7 July he was denounced a rebel for not appearing to give his advice regarding the quieting of the borders (ib. p. 300). Shortly thereafter he was warded in Edinburgh Castle, but on the 24th was released on promising to give caution within three days to keep good rule (ib. p. 741). On 22 March 1598-9 he was charged, under pain of rebellion, to appear before the council on 6 June to underlie such order as would be given him for the quieting of the west march (ib. p. 543). He failed to do so, and was subsequently imprisoned in Tantallon Castle, but on promising to make his men answerable to justice, he was released on 11 September (ib. vi. 31). On 20 November he and others were required to submit their feud with the laird of Johnstone to arbitration (ib. p. 46), which he agreed to do, but protested that he should 'reserve his duty of blood and friendship to the Lord Maxwell,' and the king admitted his protest (ib. p. 91). On 17 June he was temporarily reappointed warden of the west march, in succession to Sir John Carmichael, who had a short time previously been murdered (ib. p. 117), and on 5 July the keeping of the castle of Lochmaben was given to him (ib. p. 128) ; but on 13 August the wardency was conferred on Sir James Johnstone (ib. p. 155). This provoked the jealousy of the Maxwells, and on 20 May 1601 Herries was charged to answer for 'a new design against Johnstone (ib. p. 240). On 20 November he and others in Dumfries were denounced for contravening the acts of parliament 'against saying and hearing mass and entertaining priests,' and were summoned before the council on 17 December (ib. p. 312), with which summons they complied (ib. p. 327). On his appearance he was, however, warded in Edinburgh Castle for not entering James Murray to answer for the slaughter of Sir James Carmichael (ib. p. 316), but on 8 Jan. he was released on giving surety to repair to the burgh of Edinburgh and there remain during the king's pleasure (ib. p. 712). On 9 February he appeared, and bound himself not to harbour John Hamilton and other Jesuits, and to defend and support the minister of Dumfries in his office and in the discipline of the kirk (ib. p. 352). On the 28th he came under an obligation not to assist Lord Maxwell and his rebellious accomplices (ib. p. 355). In May 1602 the assembly of the kirk decided that he should be placed in charge of a minister for his better instruction and confirmation in the truth, in case he repaired to Edinburgh; but it was reported in November that he had stayed only a short time in Edinburgh (Calderwood, vi. 163, 166). He died on 11 October of the following year. By his wife, Catherine Ker, sister of Mark, first earl of Lothian, he had five sons John, sixth lord Herries, Sir William of Gribton, Sir Robert of Sweetheart, Edward, and James and two daughters : Elizabeth, lady Urchell, and Margaret, lady Parton.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Henderson, Thomas Finlayson (1894). \"Maxwell, William (d.1603)\".

        "content": "A Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) is a conservation designation denoting a protected area in Wales, as elsewhere in United Kingdom. SSSIs are the basic building block of site-based nature conservation legislation and most other legal nature/geological conservation designations in Great Britain are based upon them, including national nature reserves, Ramsar sites, Special Protection Areas, and Special Areas of Conservation. Sites notified for their biological interest are known as Biological SSSIs, and those notified for geological or physiographic interest are Geological SSSIs. Many SSSIs are notified for both biological and geological interest.\n\n\n== Background ==\nSSSIs in the UK are notified using the concept of an Area of Search (AOS), an area of between 400 km2 (150 sq mi) and 4,000 km2 (1,500 sq mi) in size. The Areas of Search were conceived and developed between 1975 and 1979 by the Nature Conservancy Council (NCC), based on regions created by the Local Government Act 1972. Whereas England had its Areas of Search based on 46 counties, those in Wales were based on a combination of the counties and smaller districts. In 1974, Wales was divided into 8 counties, with 37 districts. The NCC created 12 Welsh Areas of Search; they mostly follow county borders, but the larger counties (Dyfed, Powys and Gwynedd) were divided into multiple Areas using district borders. Mid and South Glamorgan were merged into a single AOS, whilst Llanelli district was included in the West Glamorgan AOS.\nDue to subsequent local government reorganisation in the UK since 1972, many counties and districts have been divided, merged or renamed. Using the AOS system alone would make it difficult to search for individual SSSI citations via the Countryside Council for Wales (CCW) database without knowing 1972 region divisions. As a result, the CCW groups Welsh SSSIs using the subdivisions of Wales formed in April 1996 by the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994, resulting in 22 principal areas.\nFor SSSIs elsewhere in the UK, see List of SSSIs by Area of Search.\nThere are between 1,019 (as of 2017) and 1,078 (as of 2021) sites of special scientific interest in Wales, accounting for 235,000 hectares (580,000 acres), making up over 12% of Wales' land area. The smallest SSSI is the Lesser Horseshoe bat roost in Pembrokeshire (0.004 hectares (430 sq ft)), while the Berwyn mountain range (24,321 hectares (60,100 acres)) is the largest. In 2021, 17% of SSSIs were in an unfavourable condition, 13% favourable, with the remaining 70% of unknown condition, as part of a report in Wales' SSSIs the first since 2006. Many SSSIs are not monitored due to a lack of funding. Most SSSIs in Wales are in private ownership, however some are under the ownership and management of local wildlife trusts, or other voluntary conservation bodies. The first SSSI designated in Wales was from 1949. 99 coal tips in Wales are also SSSIs.\nThey are designated under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, amended by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 and Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006, with Natural Resources Wales being the responsible body for SSSIs in Wales.\n\n\n== List ==\n\n\n=== By Area of Search ===\n\n\n=== By principal area ===\nList of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Anglesey\nList of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Blaenau Gwent\nList of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Bridgend County Borough\nList of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Caerphilly County Borough\nList of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Cardiff\nList of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Carmarthenshire\nList of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Ceredigion\nList of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Conwy County Borough\nList of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Denbighshire\nList of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Flintshire\nList of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Gwynedd\nList of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Merthyr Tydfil County Borough\nList of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Monmouthshire\nList of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Neath Port Talbot\nList of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Newport\nList of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Pembrokeshire\nList of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Powys\nList of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Rhondda Cynon Taf\nList of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Swansea\nList of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Torfaen\nList of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in the Vale of Glamorgan\nList of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Wrexham County Borough\n\n\n=== By other ===\nList of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in the Brecon Beacons National Park\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Juan Delgado (c. 1675–1731) was a Spanish Baroque painter active in Madrid.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nSon of painter Juan Felipe Delgado and Isabel Durán, his marriage to María de Merlo, a native of Getafe, is recorded in 1689. According to Juan Agustín Ceán Bermúdez, he would have been the teacher of Juan García de Miranda (1677–1749).\nAlready mentioned as a professor of the art of painting in 1696, the first documented works are the four paintings from the collateral altarpieces of San Pedro in the church of the Trinity of Atienza, architecturally carved between 1697 and 1700. Ceán Bermúdez attributed to him the restoration of the paintings by Francisco Herrera the Younger for the choir of the disappeared convent of San Felipe the Real de Madrid. He also cited as his work, signed and dated 1719, a San Francisco Javier with some Indians in the foreground, of good color although of mannered execution, which was found on an altar in the hermitage of the Virgen del Puerto in Madrid.​ There is also news of his intervention in the creation of sets for the palace's theatrical performances. Thus, in 1722, for the representation of Angélica and Medoro by Antonio de Zamora, a musical drama premiered at the Real Coliseo del Buen Retiro, he painted stagecraft decorations for which he was paid 4,720 reales as \"painter of stageworks, decorations and galleys.\"\nHe died in Madrid, in the family home on Calle del Reloj on December 1, 1731.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nAgulló y Cobo, Mercedes (1981).

He was the recipient of the Ekman medal from the Swedish Association of Pulp and Paper (1989), and in 1992 received the prestigious Anselme Payen Award from the American Chemical Society for his yearlong scientific work.\nGierer was born on January 12, 1919, in Piesting, Austria. In 1948, he achieved his Ph.D. degree at the University of Vienna, working on topics relating to organic chemistry.\nHe afterwards moved permanently to Sweden, where he worked at the Swedish Forest Products Laboratory in Stockholm (1951–1983). He later became a professor of wood chemistry at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology.\nDuring his career, Gierer authored numerous publications in the area of wood chemistry. As of May 2024, he possessed more than 6,500 citations for his research work on Google Scholar.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGoogle Scholar",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Léon Lacombe (12 April 1885 – 5 April 1913) was a French anarchist, criminal and murderer. After being arrested in March 1913 for the murder of an anarchist newspaper editor, he was incarcerated at La Santé Prison in Paris after confessing to two additional murders, being charged with a total of four counts of murder. The following month, Lacombe committed suicide by diving off the prison roof.\n\n\n== Life ==\nLacombe was born on 12 April 1885, in Aubin, Aveyron, to Victor Lacombe and Marie-Joséphine Cibié, a coal sorter who raised him as a single mother. Lacombe began working in the coal mines as a 12-year-old and later underwent military service, after which he moved to Decazeville, working at a mine in Cérons. Lacombe began taking interest to anarchism and started participating in anarchist gatherings in the area. Afterwards, Lacombe was fired from the mine in Cérons resulted by accusations of theft. Engineer Albert Artous, the man who fired him, was fatally shot in his home on January 12, 1912. The perpetrator was suspected to be Lacombe, who, due to being an anarchist, struggled to find another job. After moving and finding work in Paris, he began burglarizing and shooting people, including a station dispatcher at Les Aubrais station on September 14, 1912. On November 9, he reportedly fatally shot a man at a post office in Bezons during a burglary. As he became sought by authorities, Lacombe began suspecting a bookstore seller of being an informant, and shot him at his home during the night of December 5, 1912.\n\n\n== Arrest ==\nLacombe was sought after by French authorities since December 1911. While on the run, he crossed in and out of the border to Belgium, and continued to evade authorities until being arrested by detectives on March 11, 1913, during a street fair on Boulevard de la Vilette in Paris. He was noticed by detectives for his distinctive heart tattoo on his right hand. While being subdued by authorities, Lacombe made an unsuccessful attempt to reach for his coat pocket. Authorities later found that he had been in possession of dynamite, two revolvers loaded with ammunition, and two fuzes. As Lacombe was escorted to the police station, a mob tried to physically attack him.\nLacombe had been further sought after for a three-month period for the murder of M. Ducret, an anarchist newspaper editor of L'Idee Libre. During interrogations, Lacombe confessed to murdering Ducret. He additionally made confessions for the murder of a Bezons postmaster as well as the murder of a Fleury-les-Aubrais railroad worker. According to Lacombe, he \"suspected Ducret ... of trying to betray him.\" In total, he received four murder charges. While he was incarcerated at La Santé Prison, prison officers took extra steps in monitoring Lacombe. He was expected to be executed by guillotine.\n\n\n== Suicide ==\nOn the morning of April 5, 1913, while in the prison courtyard, Lacombe quickly moved to climb a nearby ladder that provided access to the roof, which he was already on by the time officers could get to him. Standing on the edge of the roof, Lacombe made threats of jumping off towards the pursuing officers. Magistrate M. Drioux attempted to convince Lacombe to surrender himself, which he replied, \"It is too late. I have finished. I killed Ducret because he was a spy. I was at Bezons and shot the postmaster in self-defence, but I am innocent of any other murder.\" Lacombe, becoming adamant on his decision to take his own life, rejected negotiations by the warden. He spoke to Georges Boucheron, his lawyer, and began crying as he requested Boucheron to take care of his mother and grandmother. Lacombe continued to speak, \"I began to beg when I was seven years old. I tried to work, but fate followed me.\" His decision to jump from the roof was set for 11:30, saying, \"At half-past eleven all will be finished.\" He then gave a salute, shouting, \"It is the moment. Tell my mother that my last thought was of her. Farewell!\" Lacombe then committed suicide by diving off the roof.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Agrilitsa is a semi-mountainous village of the regional unit of Argolis in the Peloponnese. It is located at a height of 280 meters and is built on the valley of Xerias in the foothils of Mount Artemisio. Several tributaries of the river Xerias run through the village. In the Greek census of 2021 it had a permanent population of 98 people and it is the main settlement of the local community of Karya. The main church of the village is the Church of the Annunciation, but several chapels can also be found in the area.\nAgrilitsa was once the winter village of the inhabitants of Karya who moved their flocks from the high pastures of Mount Artemisio to the lowlands of Agrilitsa at the end of every October, only to return there in May. It was first recognized as a separate settlement in 1952 and since then it has become the main settlement in the area. The village has an active elementary school and several businesses, mostly related to the local olive oil and dairy/cheese production.\nThe climate is typical hot-summer Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters and is similar to that of Argos.\nAt a close proximity we can find the settlements of Stravi Rachi, Galati, Galanaiika, Spanaiika, Merkouri, Frengaina and Mazi (Aria).\n\n\n== Population ==\nThe population has remained stable for several decades, showing many ups and downs without a clear trend.\n\n\n== Citations ==",

        "content": "Travellers' Tour Through the United States is a geographical board game published in 1822, thought to be the first board game produced in the United States.\nThe educational game was published by F. & R. Lockwood, New York-based cartographers. The game consisted of a map, which players would traverse via 139 municipalities that they had to correctly identify in order to move forward, determining how far they could move with a teetotum. In an advanced version of the game, players were also required to name the populations of the cities and towns they landed on, and the game also offered trivia about each locality. The winner was the first player to reach New Orleans. \nTravellers' Tour was also the first board game based on a map of the United States. At the time, the nation's westernmost states were Louisiana and Missouri, the latter of which had only gained statehood a year prior to the game's publication.\nThe Mansion of Happiness (1843) was previously thought to be the oldest American board game, before Travellers' Tour was discovered in the American Antiquarian Society's archives in 1991. Mansion of Happiness was also based on a previously extant British game, while Travellers' Tour was a wholly American creation.\nA sister game, Travellers' Tour Through Europe, was released a few months after. This was later followed by Travellers' Tour Round the World.\n\n\n== External links ==\nA scan of Travellers' Tour at the Library of Congress\n\n\n== References ==",

The post-season would begin in February 2021 and conclude in April 2021.\nOn September 24, 2020, the season was cancelled due to COVID-19.\n\n\n== Cancellation ==\nOn September 24, 2020, the league held its annual meeting and the following statement was released:\n\n\"The impact of the COVID-19 outbreak has created a unique situation that is still evolving; the W.O.A.A. continues to work with its Senior Hockey Committee and participating Senior Hockey teams to prepare for the return to regular competition.\n\nHowever, the W.O.A.A. Senior Hockey membership held their annual meeting last evening, September 24, 2020, and at that time a motion was moved, seconded and carried \"that collectively as members of the W.O.A.A. Senior Hockey League a decision was made that there would be NO playing season for the 2020-2021 hockey season. It will be the responsibility of each member team to remit their 2020-2021 insurance premium and the W.O.A.A. registration fee.\n\nThe W.O.A.A. Senior Hockey records show that the program began in 1948-49 and has ran continuously for seventy-two (72) hockey seasons. We are hopeful that 2021-2022 will see the return of regular competition in our Senior Hockey League.\n\nAt this time, the W.O.A.A. would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our Senior Hockey participants, team officials, game officials, executives, league sponsors, fans and valued volunteers for their past and present support.\n\nYours in Senior Hockey\n\nDavid K. Black\n\nW.O.A.A. Immediate Past President and Acting Chairman.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWOAA website",

        "content": "The Spruce Tree Centre is a building in Saint Paul, Minnesota in  the US. Located at the intersection of University Avenue and Snelling Avenues, the 126,000 square feet (11,700 m2) building was built in 1988. An attached parking garage has over 350 spaces. The parking garage is owned by the city of Saint Paul and has electric car chargers. The building replaced a drug store built in the 1920s. \nA 37-kilowatt solar panel system was installed on top of the building in 2010 as part of an initiative to install solar power prior to the opening of the Metro Green Line. The panels cost about $350,000 with most of the cost covered by an Xcel Energy grant. Since 2012 the building has been LEED certified and is currently rated Gold. \n\nAcross the street is the Snelling Avenue Station of the Metro Green Line. Adjacent to the building is a Metro A Line station. The building was described as a model, albeit in need of improvement, for transit and pedestrian supportive infrastructure on the Snelling Avenue corridor.\n\n\n== Construction and tenants ==\nThe design and impetus for construction were led by Marie Slawik. Marie Slawik and her husband Harold Slawik were active in business in Saint Paul and Roseville. Their first names of 'Harold' and 'Marie' were used for the Har Mar Mall located due north in Roseville. The building was intended to be a mixed-use urban mall, similar to Seven Points in Minneapolis. Tax-increment financing helped fund construction and the attached parking ramp built with public money used bonds that were paid off in 2015. \nThe building architect was BRW Architects, a Minneapolis-based company. Construction began in July 1987 amid a wave of interest in redeveloping land around University Avenue and the Midway neighborhood. The project was expected to cost almost $18 million with $3 million in tax increment financing. The building was designed to have 40,000 square feet (3,700 m2) in retail space and 74,000 square feet (6,900 m2) in office space. At the time the intersection of University Avenue and Snelling Avenue exceeded federal standards for carbon monoxide levels but the building was expected to help reduce concentrations by changing traffic patterns and air currents. Leasing after the initial opening was slower than expected. Vacancies were high for several years after opening.\nThe original design as a mixed-use retail and office building faltered as did many other 1980s office-retail projects. The building was sold for $1.5 million in 1992 to a Boston real estate company at the same time as the sale of Har Mar Mall. The building was again sold in 1994 with roughly half the building unoccupied. The new owners pivoted away from leasing towards retail tenants toward office space. By 1996 the building was almost 97% leased. The building is now almost exclusively office space.\nApplebee's was the first tenant of the building in September 1988. The restaurant was located in the building for 19 years until 2007. About half of the tenants in 2010 were non-profits. A major tenant is a physical therapy company that installed a pool on the first floor. The building had 30 tenants and was over 80% occupied in 2015 when it went underwent a $1.4 million renovation. The Hamline-Midway and Union Park neighborhoods groups are moving to the Spruce Tree Centre in 2024.\n\n\n== Architectural design and reception ==\nThe exterior is clad in green bathroom tiles imported from Germany. The green color of the tile was intended suggest natural elements at what is a very urban and busy intersection. The shape of the building looks like an abstract spruce tree. The clock tower was mandated as part of the development agreement and has 6-foot long clock arms. The family logo for Marie and Harold Slawik was a spruce tree. Marie was surprised at the amount of green on the building and despite wishing the building appeared less green, thought the building was beautiful.\nReception of the architectural design of the building has been mixed with the unique look and design often highlighted. The building has been described as having \"grotesque green architecture\" and Reuters described the building as the 4th ugliest in the world in 2011. A Chicago Tribune columnist described it as a 1980s version of the Emerald City that \"almost forces residents to look at it\". Star Tribune readers identified it as the 7th ugliest building in the Twin Cities in 2000. One reader commented that it \"personified bad taste\" and looked \"like a tawdry example of what a bus station's tiled restroom would look like.\" Others have described it as \"spectacularly, ambitiously ugly\". Architectural critic Larry Millett described mixed feelings about the design but suggested the building deserved respect for making a statement and having the most architectural presence of buildings at the Snelling and University Avenue intersections.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Xie Nanguang (November 18, 1902 - July 26, 1969), formerly known as Xie Chunmu and pen name Zhui Feng, was born in Changhua. He was a famous social movement participant in Taiwan under Japanese rule and a well-known post-war Chinese political figure.\n\n\n== life before death ==\nXie Chunmu graduated from Taipei Normal School (now National Taipei University of Education) in 1921 and soon studied at Tokyo Higher Normal School (now Tsukuba University), Japan. He graduated in 1925 and transferred to higher education. While in school, Xie Chunmu participated in the second and third summer cultural lecture groups of the Taiwan Cultural Association. However, due to the Erlin Incident, he dropped out of school and returned to Taiwan to support the movement. Soon, he joined the Taiwanese People's Daily in Taipei to work. When the Taiwan People's Party was established in 1927, Hsieh Chun-mu served as a member of the Central Standing Committee, director of the Political Department, and chairman of the Labor and Peasants Committee. However, due to Hsieh Chun-mu's radical line that dominated the Taiwan People's Party, Japanese officials forcibly disbanded the Taiwan People's Party in 1931.\nAfter the Taiwan People's Party was dissolved, Hsieh Chun-mu moved his family to mainland China in 1931 and founded the \"Hualian News Agency.\" Xie Chunmu changed his name to Xie Nanguang in December 1933 and became the secretary of the Nanyang Overseas Chinese Federation. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Xie Nanguang entered the Institute of International Studies in Chongqing and was responsible for collecting Japanese military intelligence. In September 1940, he became the Secretary-General. After that, Xie Nanguang served as a standing committee member of the Taiwan Revolutionary Alliance and became the chairman in November 1943. After the Second World War ended, Xie Nanguang served as a member of the Chinese delegation in Japan and as deputy leader of the political and economic group. He stayed in Tokyo, Japan. In 1950, Xie Nanguang resigned, served as the chairman of the Tiande Trading Association, and was elected the chairman of the China-Japan Trade Association. A director of the China Friendship Association, he went to Beijing in 1952 to participate in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference as a \"special entertainer.\" He returned to serve as a representative of the National People's Congress of China and a member of the Standing Committee. He died of illness in Beijing on July 26, 1969.\n\n\n=== Before going to China ===\nWhen he was about to graduate, Wang Baiyuan took a cross-dressing photo with several Taipei Normal University classmates. Wang Baiyuan dressed up as a woman in a suit, one classmate dressed up as Chaplin, and another as a fortune teller; as for Xie Chunmu and other classmates, they \"wore a pair of Taiwanese clothes, holding a bicycle in both hands, doing As he was about to set off, there was a sign on the back of the car that read \"Promote Taiwan's Culture.\" A classmate was in front of him pretending to be Japanese and standing there refusing to let him go. The same was true for the front of the car. A sign was hung that read, \"No, just wait a little longer!\" \"The words\".\nWhen Xie Chunmu was studying at Taipei Normal School, he often read \"Taiwan Youth\" (the official journal of the New People's Association), which schools in Taiwan banned then. He was a sympathetic supporter of the magazine and an active member of the secret circulation of this publication in the school. In 1921, Xie Chunmu graduated from Taipei Normal University with first-place honors and accepted a scholarship from the Government-General's Bureau of Culture and Education to study at Tokyo Normal University. However, after he came to Japan, he became a critic of Japanese colonial rule. In 1922, Xie Chunmu published a short story \"Where Will She Go? To Troubled Young Sisters\" in \"Taiwan\" under the pen name \"Zhui Feng.\" Scholars later regarded this work as one of the most critical chapters in the history of Taiwanese literature. It is a significant work of vernacular fiction. After that, Xie Chunmu successively published his comments on Taiwan's colonial authorities' education, law, agricultural and industrial movements, and other issues in publications such as \"Taiwan,\" \"Taiwan People's Daily,\" and \"Taiwan Xinmin Daily.\"\nDuring Hsieh's stay in Japan, he actively participated in various overseas activities of the Taiwanese Cultural Association, as well as studying and writing. He also participated in the Cultural Association's Summer Cultural Lecture Group for International Students in Tokyo. He returned to Taiwan for promotion in the three years from 1923 to 1925. According to research by Taiwanese literature and history scholar He Yilin, the titles and contents of Xie Chunmu's first two speeches back home include: \"Generalization of Education,\" Scientific Attitude and Daily Life,\" Characteristics of Modern Education,\" Personalization of Education\" and socialization\" etc. Later, Xie Chunmu served as a secretary of the Tokyo Youth Association and Petition Movement for establishing a Taiwanese Parliament.\nDuring his stay in Japan, Xie Chunmu slept and ate together with Wang Baiyuan. The two often talked about the fate of Taiwanese people upstairs in their apartment until dawn. In 1931, Wang Baiyuan published the Japanese poetry collection \"The Way of Thorns\" (Chinese translation as \"The Way of Thorns\"). Xie Chunmu wrote a remarkable preface for Wang Baiyuan, explaining his friendship with Wang Baiyuan, Wang Baiyuan's ideological changes, and revealing his love for Japan. Dissatisfaction with assimilation policies and educational methods. This preface by Xie Chunmu was affirmed by Wang Baiyuan and was translated into Chinese by Wang Baiyuan many years later.\nThe \"Erlin Incident\" broke out in October 1925. This peasant movement gave Xie Chunmu a considerable shock because the location of the conflict between police and civilians on October 22 happened to be in the sugar cane field of Xie Chunmu's relatives, and many of those arrested were his Relatives and friends (for example friend Li Yingzhang). Xie Chunmu gave up his studies to support the peasant movement and returned to Taiwan to join the rescue team. After returning to Taiwan, Xie Chunmu worked in the Taipei branch of the Taiwan People's Daily, actively participated in the booming agricultural and industrial movement at that time, and participated in the activities of the Taiwan Cultural Association. In July 1927, Chiang Weishui established the Taiwan People's Party, with Hsieh Chun-mu serving as its first secretary-general. In August 1930, he and Huang Baichengzhi jointly served as editors of \"Flood\". His political stance gradually shifted to the left, and he paid attention to the survival rights of Taiwan's peasants and workers. This was related to his concern for cultural enlightenment, educational reform, and the petition movement to establish Taiwan's parliament when he was studying abroad. Different.\nBecause Xie Chunmu was actively engaged in politics and the agricultural and industrial movement from when he returned to Taiwan to his move to Shanghai in December 1931, Xie Chunmu became a target of surveillance by the Japanese special police. This was also true from when he moved to China to the end of the Sino-Japanese War.\n\n\n=== After going to China ===\n\"Don't Forget the Dream of Falling Flowers in Taiwan\" by Zhang Xiuzhe, twenty-nine, goes: After the Sino-Japanese Incident in 128, Japan's military power expanded and spread to the Shanghai Concession. Xie Junnai felt the danger around him because the Hualian News Agency's style was mainly anti-Japanese. , the Japanese quickly criticized his views, so he decided to flee to Shanghai to avoid being captured and sacrificed by the Japanese. Rumors spread that Xie Jun was killed or killed in Fujian... Xie Jun ran around but later went to Xiamen and ran away again. He went to Hong Kong, did some particular work, and later transferred to Chongqing, but he was a brave Taiwanese compatriot. ...is also an outstanding talent in Taiwan.\nAfter the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, Xie Chunmu served as the Secretary-General of the Institute of International Studies of the China Institute of International Studies. It is said that the elusive character \"Yangtze No. 1\" in the Taiwanese TV series \"Yangtze River Storm\" is his code name at the \"Institute of International Studies.\"\nXie Chunmu once told Lan Min, a Taiwanese female student who went to Chongqing: \"If China wins in the future, it will not be the world of the Kuomintang, but the world of the Communist Party.\" He also hoped that she would go to Yan'an.\n\n\n== Written works ==\nLiterary works written in Chinese and Japanese:\n\nJapanese novel \"Where Will She Go—To the Troubled Young Sister\" written by Xie Chunmu from May 21 to 23, 1922. The work was serialized in \"Taiwan Youth\" and was first published in the 5th issue of July 1922.\nNew Japanese poems \"Imitation of Poetry: Praise for the King of Bo,\" \"Imitation of Poetry: Ode to Coal,\" \"Imitation of Poetry: Love Will Thrive,\" and \"Imitation of Poetry: Before the Flowers Bloom\" Were written in May 1923 and published In April 1924, the fifth-year issue of \"Taiwan\" was published, which was delayed by eight months. The four poems mentioned above were initially written in Japanese and were later translated into Chinese by Taiwanese poet Chen Qianwu. Now, people can read the Chinese translations of these four poems through \"Selected Poems Translated by Chen Qianwu,\" edited by Chen Mingtai.

The Myanmar government identifies the group as a militant organisation, The Rohingya Solidarity Organisation launched an armed rebellion, in the previous century, however discontinued in 1998. The Tatmadaw continued operations against rebels for years.\nMyanmar claimed, that the person killed who's body they had, they thought was a Separatist, and accused Bangladesh of harbouring RSO insurgents, which led to the killing of Corporal Mizanur Rahman.\nBangladeshi official said “We told them very clearly that there was no such organisation in Bangladesh and will never be.”\nMaj Gen Aziz said he reiterated to the BGP, the government's stand against letting anyone use Bangladesh's soil to plan or launch attacks against any sovereign state.\n“We told them to give us information, if any, on where in Bangladesh the RSO is located or has set up camps … We will drive them out right away.”\nHe said the BGB, after the meeting, launched operations in collaboration with the army but did not find any RSO bases inside Bangladesh.\n\n\n== Conflict ==\nIn an unprovoked attack, BGP shot at BGB patrols at Naikhangchhari border in Bandarban on May 28, leaving Mizan dead. The Myanmar force then intruded into Bangladesh and took away his body, his firearm and ammunition, creating huge tension and firing at the border.\nOn May 30, Myanmar border guards attacked another BGB team, when it neared the border searching and waiting for Mizan. A gunbattle then took place between the two sides.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nAfter the incident, Myanmar deployed the Army to stand guard with its border police along its border with Bangladesh, while BGB called for reinforcement with heavy weapons.\nMyanmar finally handed over Mizanur's body to BGB the following day and the, 120 rounds of ammo, the foreign ministry summoned the Myanmar ambassador in Bangladesh, twice demanding the body and withdrawal of the army, That Myanmar had deployed along the border.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTatmadaw\nBangladesh Armed Forces\n2001 Bangladesh–India border clashes\n2005 Bangladesh-India Border Clashes\nDeaths along the Bangladesh–India border\n2019 Bangladesh-Indian border clash\n1979 Bangladesh-Indian skirmishes\n2015 Bangladesh-Arakan Army border clash\nBorder Guard Forces\nBorder Guard Police\nBorder Guard Bangladesh\nRohingya Solidarity Organisation\nBorder Security Force\nOperation Clean and Beautiful Nation\n\n\n== References ==",

The plot is not the least commendable, being fraught with interest from the rising of the curtain until the denouement; and the skill with which the author has preserved that interest throughout, will in our opinion stamp 'success' upon his labors.\"\nAnother review said \"The language in many portions of it is highly poetical and betrays an extent of reading and refinement of thought highly creditable to its author.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nZisca the Avenger at Ausstage",

        "content": "Canadien is a Canadian brand of ice hockey equipment owned by Birch Hill Equity Partners through its portfolio company Sport Maska Inc. The Canadien brand was created in 1969 in Drummondville, Quebec and was manufactured originally by the company Les industries du hockey Canadien, Inc. The original company was sold in 1978, and since that time the Canadien brand has gone through numerous ownership changes. Since 1998 it has been part of a consolidated group of six hockey brands that comprises Canadien, CCM, Heaton, Jofa, Koho, and Titan. In 2017, Birch Hill Equity Partners of Toronto acquired the group of brands, which are held by the company Sport Maska. While CCM remains the flagship brand of the group, products made under the Canadien name appear occasionally.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1969, a group of 15 investors joined to form a hockey stick manufacturing company called Les industries du hockey Canadien, Inc. Among the investors were Montreal Canadiens players Serge Savard, Yvan Cournoyer, and Guy Lapointe. The company established its operations in Drummondville, Quebec, the hometown of Cournoyer. Canadien grew rapidly and by 1976 held 17 per cent of the hockey stick market, the second largest market share after Sher-Wood.\nIn 1977, graphic designer Georges Huel designed the company's wordmark and triangle logo.\nIn late 1978, the Canadien company was acquired by Action Traders, Inc. of Toronto. Then, the following year, Action Traders sold Canadien to Amer of Finland. The previous year, Amer had bought Koho, thus the purchase expanded its hockey holdings. Amer continued to produce hockey equipment under the Koho and Canadien names until 1986, when it sold its hockey operations to Karhu, also of Finland. Karhu had entered the hockey market in 1972 when it acquired Titan, and then in 1985 it purchased Jofa from Volvo. In the early 1990s, Karhu acquired goalie equipment company Heaton, creating a portfolio of five hockey brands.\nKarhu's hockey operations were transferred to its Canadian arm Karhu Canada, Inc., which was renamed the Sports Holdings Corporation in the 1990s. In 1998, Sports Holdings was acquired by SLM International, the holding company for Sport Maska, Inc., which itself owned the CCM brand. In 1999, SLM renamed itself The Hockey Company. As the owner of the CCM, Jofa, Titan, Koho, Canadien, and Heaton brands, The Hockey Company became the dominant player in the hockey equipment market.\nIn June 2004, Reebok acquired The Hockey Company. After the sale, it phased out all brands save CCM and introduced its own RBK line of products. In August 2005, Adidas acquired Reebok. Adidas continued to produce hockey equipment under the CCM brand primarily.\nIn July 2017, Adidas sold its hockey holdings for $110 to Birch Hill Equity Partners of Toronto for around $110 million. Its hockey operations were at this time consolidated in the subsidiary Sport Maska, Inc., which owned the rights to the six brands. Since the purchase in 2017, CCM has remained the flagship brand of the group, the products that use the other five brand names appear sporadically.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "At least two local elections that directly elect chiefs of township were held in December 1998 in China. Although not considered as a mature democratic process and were not widely known, these two polls were still remarked with historical significance as they resulted in the first popularly elected executive leaders since the founding of the communist state.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in 1978 marked the start of \"Reform and Opening Up\", the policy of economic reform. Following the meeting, political reforms were pursued, albeit at a limited scale. On 1 July 1979, the 5th National People's Congress (NPC) enacted election law that regulates the NPC and people's congresses at local level, and a new legislation on local governance that includes expansion of election coverage. Pilot schemes were implemented for the election of county-level people's congresses between late 1979 and early 1980 by the Ministry of Civil Affairs under the directives of the CCP Central Committee, and the first formal election was held during that period. The two legislation were further amended in 1982, 1986, and 1995.:8-12 In 1997, the Central Committee asserted that \"grass-root regimes and autonomous organisations of townships shall have sound democratic electoral systems\". A year later the Law on Organization of Village Committees was implemented, and Sichuan branch of the CCP ordered other cities and townships in March 1998 to follow the precedence of Bazhong, where executives of the city were chosen by \"public nomination and selection\" mechanism (Chinese: 公推公选). In September Sichuan CCP published tentative rules on choosing executives and party seniors in towns and townships, which allows them to be nominated by organisations, public, or self-nomination, or through examinations. Between October and 27 December 1998, all 178 deputy chiefs of the 79 towns and townships in Nanbu County were chosen by the public nomination mechanism.:435\n\n\n== Nancheng Township ==\nNancheng local election was held on 5 December 1998 to elect the new Chief and Deputy Chief of Nancheng Township, Qingshen County, Sichuan. Incumbent Deputy Chief Shang Zhizhong was elected as the new Chief, while a nonpartisan candidate succeeded Shang as the new deputy.\n\n\n=== Prelude ===\nFollowing the provincial directive and with the arrangement of the Sichuan CCP, the local governments and party branches of Nancheng Township and Qingshen County, the upper administrative division, started planning the direct election of Nancheng Township chief and deputy chief. An opinion polling was conducted with a total of 750 questionnaire distributed.:434–5 Amongst the 723 responses, more than 95% of party executives and 85% of villagers agreed to the elections.:376\nAs a result, Qingshen County CCP, under the arrangement of the Sichuan CCP, established task force and election committee to materialise the election. Nancheng people's congress adopted three bills (on implementing the trial work of the direct election, the primary election, and the formal election) and a resolution (that confirms an election would be held) on 5 November that provide details of the conduct of the election.:376\n\n\n=== Electoral system ===\nResolutions adopted set out the eligibility of the election. Candidate of the township chief and the three deputies may be chosen amongst the residents. The chief shall have at least two years of experience as a deputy section head of a department (Chinese: 副科长) or other senior positions in the county's administration; a university degree; a Chinese Communist Party membership, and shall not be aged 40 or above. The deputy chief shall have at least three years of working experience in county's administration, people's organization, or township's administration; have completed high school; and shall not be aged 40 or above, but party membership is not compulsory.:440 One of the elected deputy chief shall be a woman and another shall be at most 30 years old. Residents fulfilling these criteria may receive early nomination.:376\nPotential nominee may nominate themselves, or be nominated by electorates or recommended by the party. They also need to be vetted by Nancheng and Qingshen CCP before entering the primary, which residents would select two candidates for township chief and four for deputy.:440 In the formal election on 5 December, each person is entitled to one vote for township chief, and three votes for deputy chief.:376:440\n\n\n=== Campaign ===\n10 people were nominated for the township chief but two withdrew later, and 5 withdrew amongst the 27 deputy chief nominees. Nancheng party branch then vetted the remaining nominees, approving 4 and 15 nominees for chief and deputy chief election respectively.:442 A further screening by Qingshen's official confirmed 3 candidates competing for the chief, and 8 candidates for the deputy chief.:377\nA campaigning conference was organised on 19 November at the Nancheng primary school. It was attended by more than 1,000 people including village executives, party seniors, deputies to people's congress, and electorates. Candidates made speeches on \"if I were the township chief\" or \"if I were the township deputy chief\", followed by a Q&A session which prompted 18 people asking 27 questions.:377:443\n\n\n=== Candidates ===\nThe primary was held on 28 November. Mobile ballot boxes were provided throughout the township. The result was announced on the next day. 14,635 ballot papers were issued, and 14,550 were returned. A total of 14,131 valid votes were counted, and confirmed the final two candidates for the township chief and the final four for the deputy chief.:442\nIt is known that one of the chief candidate is Shang Zhizhong (Chinese: 商志忠), the incumbent deputy chief. For the deputy chief election, Lu Guirong (Chinese: 鲁桂容) is the female candidate; Yu Zheyun (Chinese: 余泽云) was nominated by the electorates; and Yang Le (Chinese: 杨乐), aged 29, is the only candidate without the communist party membership. Both Yang and Yu were nominated by the villagers.:377\n\n\n=== Result ===\nOn 5 December, all 18 constituencies in the township conducted the election simultaneously. The officials announced a total of 14,753 ballot papers were issued, and 14,616 were returned. There were 14,323 valid votes, 293 invalid votes, and 162 blank votes. Shang Zhizhong received 9,611 votes and his rival got 4,197 votes. Shang thus was elected as the new chief.:434–5:377 The nonpartisan Yang Le was elected the deputy chief.\n\nThe election result was reported to the Nancheng people's congress, and the congress resolved not to elect the Chief and Deputy Chief in the first meeting of the session. Elected public officers shall carry out the duties in accordance with the local government's organization law.:377\nThis is believed to be the first official local election to elect an executive leader in the history of the People's Republic of China.:382 However, it was not publicly disclosed and was therefore more obscured than the Buyun election that was held a few weeks later on the New Year's Eve.\n\n\n=== Party election ===\nDays later, Nancheng communists conducted party election as well to elect the new party committee, including the secretary, 3 vice-secretaries, 7 committee members, along with the disciplinary committee secretary and 3 members.:377 Members may nominate themselves, or be nominated by party members or public organisations. Nominees were registered with the Organization Department of the county's government, and eligible nominees would become candidates. After giving a campaign speech, party members may cast their votes. Out of 587 electorates, 423 were involved in the nomination, and 536 voted in the party election.:199 Incumbent party secretary Li Xuequan (Chinese: 李学权) was re-elected after receiving 462 votes, or 86.2% of total votes cast.\n\n\n=== Reaction ===\nDu Gangjian, former professor at National Academy of Governance, said Nancheng's primary election prevented selection of candidates by a small group of people, and triumphs over other local elections that filter candidates by \"votes of elitism block\". Du, however, added the mobile voting in the primary election could still be prone to intervention, and criticised the unregulated proxy voting and the insecure secret ballot.:445,7\nZhou Shubin (Chinese: 邹树彬), a political science researcher at the Shenzhen University, said Nancheng held \"the earliest and most thorough trial on direct election\", but he expressed concern that the people's congress is sidelined. He recommended adopting \"incremental democratic\" measures for the direct elections by allowing the congresses to play a full role in order to advance township's democratization.\nLi Fan (Chinese: 李凡), an independent scholar from the think tank World and China Institute (Chinese: 世界与中国研究所), believes Nancheng election's eligibility requirement and vetting matches the party's reform on executive system, but contradicts the proper procedures for the public to elect an executive leader. Proxy voting and other issues were not addressed due to secrecy and confidentiality of the poll. Li concluded that whilst the election earned innovative achievements, problems remained to be solved.:381-2\nIn response to the subsequent party election, Yang Jirong (Chinese: 杨继荣), professor of Sichuan communist academy, said it encouraged party members to participate in the building of grassroot democracy, and the two polls fine-tuned the governance by integrating the party's and state's leadership. On the other hand, he noted the election weakened collective leadership, and the public nomination is restricted to party members without including the general public.:200-2\nWang Chuan (Chinese: 王川), deputy organisation minister of Sichuan CCP, said a series of communist's democracy trials, including Nancheng party election, accumulated experiences for \"public nomination\" of township officials, and deepened confidence in reforming the selection of provincial executives of the party.\n\n\n=== Aftermath ===\nIn the Nancheng campaign, Shang proposed a number of targets to be achieved by 2001. For the growth of economy, he sets out the annual growth of GDP to reach at least 10%, industrial output value at 4%, and government's revenue at 15%. He added farmer's share of grain per capita shall be more than 400 kg, annual growth of income per capital at RMB 250, and rate of natural increase controlled at less than 6‰. Researches believed all these goals were completed before 2001.:377 The elected administration invested in infrastructure by improving irrigation, developing small towns, and providing all rural villages with electricity, telecommunication, and road connection. Shang remains popular as the township reaches moderate prosperity.:378\n\n\n== Buyun Township ==\n\nBuyun local election was held on 31 December 1998 to elect the new Chief of Buyun Township, Suining City, Sichuan. Tan Xiaoqiu, the acting Chief backed by the communist, was elected with a majority of votes.\n\n\n=== Prelude ===\nZhang Jinming (Chinese: 张锦明), the CCP secretary of Shizhong District, Suining City in Sichuan since 1998, faced criticism over the economic troubles endured by the four townships under his administration. Zhang decided to shift the blame and risks by \"public selection\" of officials. The first was done in April 1998. Residents of Baoshi Town were allowed to vote and decide the candidates for the town chief, followed by the voting by the people's congress to confirm the successor. However, some residents was dissatisfied by the party's backdoor control over the selection. Zhang eventually settled on organising direct election, and decided to hold one in Buyun Township after field researches and discussions. He believed Buyun's remoteness, underdeveloped telecommunication, and limited population allow easier manipulation of the election and prevent possible interference.:434\nOn 27 November 1998, Buyun CCP requested permission from Shizhong CCP to hold an election for the chief of the township after a series of amendments to the plan, which was granted on the same day. Buyun CCP then established task force and direct-election committee to prepare for the poll.:5–6\n\n\n=== Electoral system ===\nCandidate shall aged 25 or above, completed high school studies, and has been registered as a resident of the township or is working in the township. Political parties, people's organizations, and public groups may propose nominations, while at least 30 signatures are required for self nomination. All nominees, except those endorsed by the party, will need to go through a \"constituency joint-session consultation\" (Chinese: 选区联席会议协商), which will confirm only two nominees as the formal candidates by secret ballot. Party nominees will be directly granted the candidacy. The formal election adopts a two-round system, where any candidates receiving a majority of votes will be elected, or else the top two candidates will enter the second round.:49–52\n\n\n=== Candidates ===\n15 people run in the election, including various senior officials such as Liu Shiguo (Chinese: 刘仕国), then-chairman of Buyun people's congress, and Zhou Kun (Chinese: 邹坤), deputy secretary of Buyun CCP. Tan Xiaoqiu (Chinese: 谭晓秋) was nominated by the CCP and thus confirmed as one of the candidates.:46 The remaining two candidates endorsed by the \"constituency joint-session consultation\" are Zhou Xingyi (Chinese: 周兴义) and Cai Rongfei (Chinese: 蔡荣辉).\nZhou, who won most vote in the preliminary selection, has been a chemistry teacher for a local high school for more than two decades. Cai is from the powerful local clan and the head of Village 10 after working as a village executive for 20 years. Tan, the incumbent Buyun CCP deputy secretary and the acting Buyun Township Chief, is foreign to the village. A long-time official who had previously served as the deputy chief of Buyun and the nearby Baiyun.:46 Tan was approved by the local government and was expected to be formally appointed to the chiefdom, but chose to run in the election following the introduction of the new system.\n\n\n=== Result ===\nTan won the election with around 51% of votes in the first round, surpassing the threshold of a majority in both valid votes and total votes. Officials said no irregularities were found during the voting, and declared Tan was elected the twelfth Chief of Buyun Township. On 4 January 1999, Buyun people's congress adopted resolution that confirmed the validity of the election. Tan, widely recognised as the first popularly elected head of local administration despite after Nancheng election, assumed office afterwards.\n\n\n=== Reaction ===\nIn contrast to the low profile handling of Nancheng election, various media including West China City Daily and Southern Weekly reported the success of Buyun poll. State media CCTV detailed the election process in a story on 26 February 1999. Buyun is therefore, inaccurately, referred to by the media as the \"first Chinese township with a direct election\".\nThe communist party committee of Shizhong, Suining praised the direct election for deepening the relations between the public and the senior officials in local government and party, while \"enriching\" the officials. During the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference meeting in March 1999, three motions were proposed which recommended gradually expanding direct elections from Residents' committee to main executives at town/township-level, and permit direct elections for chief of town/township under certain conditions as trials. The motions added direct elections at town/township-level will consolidate the fruits of villagers autonomy and grassroot democracy.\nWu Xiang (Chinese: 吴象), an official at Central Policy Research Office, considered the election as a breakthrough but conceded that it failed to raise attention. Wu believed it could excite ordinary villagers to be enthusiastic and creative and therefore significantly advance political reform if it had been publicised.\nZhao Yunfeng (Chinese: 焦运丰), former chairman of Buyun people's congress, was rather pessimistic and labelled Buyun's democracy as hollow due to a lack of comprehensive reform. Without changes to the mechanism that deviates higher-level policies, he argued, chiefs can hardly play a role; and without strengthening non-governmental groups, there will be no real competitions.\n\n\n=== Aftermath ===\nDuring Tan's three years in office, Buyun is the only township in Suining without any petitioning. No complaints were received as well against local officials. The survey conducted by Peking University Law School between July 1997 and late 2001 found that, in comparison to national average, Buyun residents were more positive towards elections and more rational when voting for their candidates.:236\nTan was re-elected once and held the office until 2004. But unlike other defeated candidates who were promoted during those six years, Tan had to stay in office as the chief. Cai, who lost to Tan in the election, said Tan in fact suffered because of the election.\n\n\n== Cancellation ==\nDespite receiving appreciations from officials and academics, the chiefdom elections were criticised by the state-owned Legal Daily. The paper cited the Constitution of the People's Republic of China and argued elections by the residents are unconstitutional, as \"Local people's congresses shall, at their respective levels, elect and have the power to remove from office ... township heads and deputy heads, and town heads and deputy heads.\" Buyun officials were also criticised by Sichuan authorities and were under pressure from the investigation panel of the National People's Congress.\nIn the next year, Dapeng Town of Shenzhen in Guangdong adopted the \"two-vote system\" (Chinese: 两票制) to choose the new chief, although practically there are three rounds of voting. The first round is for residents to propose nominations. Eligible nominees will enter the second round, where a limited franchise will vote for the formal candidate, to be elected by the people's congress in the third round as the new town chief.\nDue to unconstitutional concerns, the next 2001 local election in Nancheng adopted the public nomination procedures, where candidates were selected by the residents but voted into office by the people's congress. Buyun followed suit, and reverted to appointment system in 2004 without any public poll. In 2019, Buyun was dissolved and merged into Baima town.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nElections in China\nYao Lifa, believed to be the first municipal people's congress deputy elected through self-nomination\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

It was once considered the first play written and published in Australia although it seems to have been preceded by The Bushrangers and The Tragedy of Donohoe.\nAn October 1834 advertisement asked for subscriptions so the play could be published.\nIt debuted in Launceston in 1835. One review said \"We cannot do justice to ourselves, if we omit to notice the very little anxiety shewn on the part of the performers generally, to the success of the piece. It is not a production of Shakespeare, certainly, but, with so careless a performance, Shake-peare's best piece must have failed in effect.\"\nThe play was performed again in Hobart in 1836.\nNo copy of the play has been located. I\nThomas announced he would publish a romantic drama in five acts, entitled The Rose of the Wilderness, or Emily the Maniac but this does not seem to have happened.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Bandit of the Rhine at Ausstage",

He was a representative of the 13th, 14th, and 15th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party. He was a member of the 10th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nWang was born in the town of Buliu, Rongcheng County, Shandong, in November 1938. \nWang enlisted in the People's Liberation Army (PLA) in January 1956, and served in the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN). In 1958, after the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis, he served in the coastal province Fujian. In March 1960, he enrolled at the Advanced Vocational School of the People's Liberation Army Navy, and graduated in September 1961. He joined the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) at the same year. In November 1965, he served as the captain of the 126 torpedo boat squadron. He and his battle companion sank the Nationalist warship \"Yongchang\", wounded \"Yongtai\", and captured 9 enemies. As a result, he was personally honored with second-class merit. \nWang became deputy commander of the People's Liberation Army Navy Fujian Base in December 1976, rising to commander in August 1985. In July 1987, he was reassigned as commander of the People's Liberation Army Navy Zhoushan Base, and held that office until October 1991. Starting in 1992, he successively served as deputy commander of the East Sea Fleet and the North Sea Fleet. He was commissioned as deputy commander of the Guangzhou Military Region in November 1994, in addition to serving as commander of the South Sea Fleet. In August 1998, he led two marine corps with nearly 6,000 officers and soldiers to withstand the impact of the sixth, seventh, and eighth flood peaks of the Yangtze River, ruled out 15 major and minor risks, and successfully completed the flood control and rescue mission.   \nWang was promoted to the rank of rear admiral (shaojiang) in August 1988 and to vice admiral (zhongjiang) in August 1996.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sir John Maxwell, 4th Lord Herries of Terregles (1512? – 20 January 1583) was a Scottish nobleman and supporter of Mary, Queen of Scots.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMaxwell was the second son of Robert, fifth lord Maxwell, by Janet Douglas, daughter of Sir William Douglas of Drumlanrig, Dumfriesshire. He was born about 1512, and was educated at Sweetheart Abbey, Kirkcudbrightshire. As tutor to his nephews, and presumptive heir to them and his brother, he was for some time known as the Master of Maxwell. While his father and brother were prisoners in England in 1545, he with great valour held Lochmaben Castle, and refused to deliver it up. In 1547 he married Agnes Herries, eldest daughter and coheiress with her two sisters of William, third lord Herries. To win her hand he had to enter into complicated intrigues against her guardian, the Earl of Arran, who designed to marry her to his son, Lord John Hamilton. Although related to her within the prohibited degrees, he neglected to obtain a papal dispensation for the marriage, but on 26 May 1555 an absolution and grace of dispensation was granted him.\nOn 20 March 1551-2 the Master of Maxwell was appointed to succeed his brother Robert, sixth lord Maxwell, as warden of the west marches; but on 29 August 1553 resigned the office on the ground that he had come under deadly feud with various clans of the marches. It was therefore transferred to his uncle, James Douglas of Drumlanrig. In 1559 the master was committed by the queen regent to the castle of Edinburgh for declaring that he would to the uttermost of his power 'assist the preachers and the congregation' (Knox, i. 319), but on 1 August he made his escape. On the 15 August, John Knox advised Cecil to comfort him with \"favourable writings\", as his assistance would be invaluable to their cause. From this time Maxwell gave strenuous support to the reformed party. He was one of the commission who signed the treaty with Elizabeth at Berwick, 7 February 1560; he signed the band of 20 April following to defend the liberty of the Evangel, and for the expulsion of the French from Scotland;  and on 27 January 1560-1 he subscribed the Book of Discipline.\nAfter the return of Queen Mary to Scotland, Maxwell on 4 September 1561 was reappointed warden of the west marches (Reg. P. C. Scotl. i. 157). Henceforth his attitude towards the reformed party was uncertain; for while he continued nominally a Protestant, his political sympathies, like those of Secretary Maitland, were with the queen. He had been on terms of special friendship with Knox, who never lost respect for him, and refers to him as 'a man stout and wittie' (Works, i. 459), and as of 'great judgment and experience' (ib. ii. 351); but on account of a letter written by Knox in October 1563 in reference to the mass, the master gave Knox 'a discharge of the familiarity which before was great betwixt them' (ib. p. 399). Still the master did not break with James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray even when he rose in rebellion at the time of the Darnley marriage in 1565, and endeavoured to prevent the queen going to extremities against him. When Moray retreated westwards from Edinburgh, the master had an interview with him at Hamilton, after which he endeavoured without success to mediate an arrangement with the queen. On Moray passing southwards into Dumfries he entertained him in his house (ib. p. 512); but when the queen expressed her determination to revenge herself on Moray, he declined to arrest him and advised him to pass into England. The queen on Moray's retirement committed to the master the charge of guarding the borders, and returned to Edinburgh (Herries, Memoirs, p. 72). On 1 January 1565-6 an act was also passed absolving him from all charges of treason that had been made against him (Reg. P. C. Scotl. i. 415). On the queen's escape from Holyrood Palace, after the murder of David Rizzio, the master joined her with a strong force at Dunbar, and henceforth may be reckoned one of her staunchest supporters.\nAt the end of 1566 he became Lord Herries. Sir James Balfour states that he was created Lord Herries at the baptism of Prince James, 17 December; but according to a decision of the House of Lords, 23 June 1858, no new peerage was created in his person, and he was merely called to the peerage in right of his wife. He also acquired from his wife's sisters their share in their father's estates, and on 8 May 1566 a charter of Terregles was granted to him and his wife and their heirs, and failing these to his heirs male. The charter was confirmed by parliament on 19 April 1567.\nHerries was one of the assize who acquitted James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell of the murder of Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, and excused himself for doing so merely on the ground that in the indictment the murder was stated wrongly to have been done on the 9th instead of on the morning of the 10th February. He was, however, rather an enemy than a friend of Bothwell; and Sir James Melville states that when rumours reached Herries of the queen's intention to marry Bothwell, he besought her on his knees to eschew \"sic utter wrak and inconvenientis as that wuld bring on\". Still he remained faithful to the queen when the marriage resulted in disaster to her. Although not present at Carberry, he subscribed the band at Dumbarton on her behalf; and such was the faith in his honesty and ability that the queen's lords entrusted to him the management of her cause, and advised Francis Throckmorton that communications from Elizabeth I in reference to means of aiding her should be sent to him. Throckmorton informed William Cecil that Herries was \"the cunning horse-leech and the wisest of the whole faction; but, as the Queen of Scots says of him, there is nobody can be sure of him\".\nFor a time Herries declined to have any conference with Moray so long as the queen was imprisoned, and he refused to permit the herald to proclaim the regency of Moray at Glasgow. On 14 October 1567 he came to Edinburgh and gave in his acknowledgment of the regent's authority, but, as would appear from the letter of the Bishop of St Andrews to him, the submission was merely nominal. At the meeting of parliament in December, he made a remarkable speech to the effect that those who, in view of the queen's refusal to give up Bothwell, had \"sequestered\" her in Lochleven had done the \"duty of noble men\", and that therefore Argyll, Huntly, and others, ought to give in their acknowledgment to the king's party, as he and others had done. Notwithstanding these specious professions he subscribed the band for the queen's deliverance from Lochleven, joined her standard immediately after her escape, and fought for her at Langside on 13 May 1568, where he had the command of the horse.\nIt was to Herries that Mary entrusted herself when her cause was lost. When flight to Dumbarton was impossible, she sought refuge in his territories; but, probably in doubt also as to the strength of his loyalty, she finally decided, in opposition to his strong persuasions, to seek personally the assistance of Elizabeth. On 16 May Herries and the queen crossed the Solway into England. Mary wrote to Elizabeth I, from Workington mentioning Herries' help and his presence among her companions in England. On the 25th Herries was sent by Mary to Elizabeth I to solicit for her an interview that she might explain her position. Herries is said to have carried a diamond ring from Cockermouth to Elizabeth in London, a ring which Elizabeth had previously given Mary as a token of friendship and promise of support. Elizabeth, however, declined to see Mary, or to interfere in her behalf, or to permit her to leave the country until she had cleared her reputation. Whether at the instance of Mary or not, Herries thereupon seems to have suggested a compromise. He told Sir Francis Knollys that he \"misliked not\" that Mary \"should be bridled in her regiment by assistance of the noblemen of her realm in consideration of her rashness and foul marriage with the Earl of Bothwell\", and Henry Middlemore was under the impression that Herries desired that the \"regent with the noblemen should still bear rule, but under the direction of the Queen of England\".\nAt a meeting of the estates on 19 August 1568 Herries was formally forfeited, but proceedings against him were suspended pending the result of the proposed conference in England. The regent also intended to have demolished his castle, but the laird of Drumlanrig having stated that it was the intention of Herries himself to pull it down and build a new one, the regent, scorning to be \"a barrowman to his old walls\", allowed it to stand. Herries was chosen by Mary one of her commissioners to the conferences in England, sharing the chief responsibility with the Bishop of Ross. On 1 December he made a vehement speech against the regent and the Scottish commissioners, affirming that some of them had themselves foreknowledge of the murder.\nAfter Moray's return to Scotland in the spring of 1569, Herries joined the Hamiltons in an attempted revolt; and on coming to Edinburgh to arrange terms for an agreement he was on 16 April warded in the castle, on the ground that he had advised the Duke of Chatelherault not to take the oath to the regent. On 5 July he deemed it advisable to inform Elizabeth (Cal. State Papers, For. Ser. 1569-71, entry 314) and William Cecil (ib. entry 315) that he had not \"dealt doubly in the cause of his mistress\", nor had been \"committed to ward with his own will\". At the same time he gave 'good words' to the regent, who, however, distrusting his intentions, detained him in prison, and it was only after the regent's assassination that William Kirkcaldy of Grange set him free. There can scarcely be any doubt that he was at least indirectly concerned in Norfolk's conspiracy (cf. Murdin, State Papers; and Cal. Hatfield MSS. pt. i. passim).\nShortly after obtaining his liberty, Herries joined the queen's lords at Linlithgow, when it was determined to assemble at Edinburgh on 8 April. They so far carried out their purpose; but further serious results were frustrated by James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton, on whose advice (April 25, Cal. State Papers, For. Ser. 1569-71, entry 849) the Earl of Sussex caused a diversion by advancing across the borders into the territories of the Maxwells. At Morton's request the lands of Lord Maxwell were spared, but those of Herries and the Johnstones were devastated (Scrope, 9 May, ib. entry 907). The shelter given by Herries to the English rebel Leonard Dacre led to further proceedings against him; and finally finding himself exposed to two fires — those of Elizabeth and the regent — he resolved to attempt a compromise by coming to terms with Elizabeth, and promising to employ his 'will and power in her service' (Sussex, 10 September ib. entry 1249). To preserve Elizabeth's good will he refrained from assisting the Hamiltons against the regent in the following February; but he earnestly entreated her to \"take some good order for the restitution of Queen Mary, or her party would utterly despair of her goodness, and seek the aid of some other prince\" (ib. entry 1581). On 17 May 1571 he eluded the forces sent to watch him by Morton, and joined Kirkcaldy in the castle of Edinburgh (ib. entry 1710), but shortly afterwards returned home (ib. entry 1721), his purpose having been merely to assist in mediating an agreement with Morton (ib. entry 1726). On 7 June he, however, again returned to Edinburgh to attend a parliament of the queen's party on the 12th (Calderwood, iii. 78, 91). On 21 August he informed Elizabeth that \"he must do as the others do\", unless Elizabeth showed some disposition to interfere on behalf of the queen of Scots (ib. entry 1934); and when finally he became convinced that Elizabeth would not interfere, he saw that Mary's cause was hopeless, and some time before the capture of the castle came to terms with the regent.\nAlong with his relative, Lord Maxwell, who laid claim to the earldom of Morton, Herries took an active part in the scheme for depriving Morton in 1578 of the regency. He was one of those sent by the king and council to Morton on 15 March to demand the delivery of the castle of Edinburgh (ib. p. 3), and was chosen a member of the new privy council after Morton's resignation. On Morton's return to power he for some time held aloof from him, but on 8 September was nominated with seven other noblemen to proceed on 20 September to Stirling to assist the king in the adoption of measures for \"he repose and quietness of the troubled commonwealth\". On 21 January 1578–9 he presented a discourse to the king on the management of the west borders, and shortly afterwards he was appointed to succeed his nephew, Lord Maxwell, as warden. On 21 August 1579 he was succeeded as warden by his hereditary enemy, Johnstone of Johnstone.  On the execution of Morton in 1581, Herries, true to his Marian sympathies, became one of the most strenuous supporters of Esmé Stewart, 1st Duke of Lennox. After the raid of Ruthven in August 1582, he joined Lennox in Edinburgh, and was one of the nobles sent by Lennox to ask a private conference with the king, but had to return with a message that Lennox must leave Scotland. Herries died suddenly on Sunday, 20 January 1582–3, at Edinburgh, ‘in time of the afternoon preaching,’ in \"an upper chamber in William Fowler's lodging\", where, feeling too ill to go to the preaching, he had gone to \"see the boys bicker\". He was interred in the choir of the church of Terregles.\n\n\n== Family ==\nBy his wife Agnes Herries, he had four sons and seven daughters:\n\nWilliam Maxwell, 5th Lord Herries of Terregles\nSir Robert Maxwell of Spottes\nEdward Maxwell, commendator of Dundrennan and laird of Lamington\nJohn Maxwell of Newlaw\nElizabeth Maxwell, who married John Gordon of Lochinvar\nMargaret Maxwell, who married Mark Kerr, 1st Earl of Lothian\nAgnes Maxwell lady Amisfield\nMary Maxwell, who married William Hay, 6th Lord Hay of Yester\nSarah Maxwell, lady Johnstone\nGrizel Maxwell, lady Bombie\nNicolas Maxwell, lady Lag.\n\n\n== References ==\nSpecific\n\nGeneral\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Henderson, Thomas Finlayson (1894). \"Maxwell, John (1512?-1583)\".

        "content": "Abdul Rahim Ahmad Mahmoud al-Huwaiti (died; April 2020) was a Saudi citizen and member of the Howeitat tribe, known for his resistance against the Saudi government's eviction orders for a mega-project. A government employee at the Ministry of Finance, al-Huwaiti became a symbol of protest after he was killed by Saudi security forces in April 2020, following his refusal to give up his ancestral land. His death sparked international criticism and brought attention to the impact of Saudi Arabia's Neom project on the local population.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nAl-Hawiti was a civil servant in the Ministry of Finance.\n\n\n== Conflict with Saudi government ==\nIn April 2020, Al-Hawaiti and other residents were being pressured by the Saudi government to give up their properties and accept financial compensation for a Neom mega-project. Al-Hawaiti refused to allow the Land Registry Committee to enter his house. He posted several videos on social media protesting against the eviction.\nOn 13 April 2020, he posted videos online announcing that Saudi security forces were trying to evict him and other members of the Howeitat tribe from their historical homeland to make way for the development of Neom. In the videos, Al-Huwaiti said that he would defy the eviction orders, although he expected that Saudi authorities would plant weapons in his house to incriminate him.\n\n\n== Death ==\nAl-Hawaiti was shot dead by Saudi security forces after he refused to hand over his property for a mega-project on the Red Sea. According to Saudi activists, al-Hawaiti was shot dead after recording his last video of security forces storming his property. The Saudi government has not commented on the alleged killing.\nAl-Huwaiti's funeral was held near the village of al-Khoraibah and was well attended despite the presence of Saudi security forces.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nOn 9 June 2020, the MENA Rights Group and ALQST submitted a letter to the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, alleging that al-Hawaiti was subjected to excessive torture by law enforcement officials. and executed as a result of the use of disproportionate force acting on behalf of Saudi Arabia.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nAl-Hawaiti's death sparked international attention and criticism of the Saudi government's handling of the Neom project and its impact on the local population.\n\n\n== See also ==\nRabih Alenezi\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Juan Francisco de Cárdenas y Rodríguez de Rivas (5 May 1881 – 16 January 1966) was a Spanish diplomat.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nCárdenas was born in Seville on 5 May 1881 to Juan de Cárdenas, a magistrate and a state councilor. A member of an earlier generation of his family, Francisco de Cárdenas, served as Spain's Minister of Justice.\nAfter attending high school at the San Isidro Institute in Madrid, he was educated at the Universities of Salamanca and Seville.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAfter receiving a law degree, he entered the diplomatic service at 22 as chargé d'affaires in Lisbon. In 1917, after a term in Mexico, he came to the United States serving as first secretary and counselor of the Spanish embassy in Washington, D.C. in the 1920s, and as chamberlain to King Alfonso XIII. He then served as Minister to Bucharest, the capital of Romania.\nDuring the Second Republic, he was Spanish ambassador to Japan from 1931 to 1932, followed by ambassador in Washington, D.C. between 1932 and 1934. His appointment was met favorably in the United States, and a luncheon was given in his honor at the Newport, Rhode Island home of Mrs. Duncan E. Cameron. Among the attendess were Juan Riaño y Gayangos, the former Spanish diplomat who had married an American socialite and heiress.\nAfter Washington, he served as ambassador to the French Republic between 1934 and 1936. After the coup d'état of July 1936 that began the Civil War, it did not take long before he joined the rebels. Despite initially maintaining the appearance of respect for the Republican order, he did everything possible to sabotage the request for weapons that had been made to the French head of government Léon Blum, delaying the processing of the request, which nevertheless was formalized on July 20. ​José Giral sent Fernando de los Ríos, who was in Geneva, to reinforce the request and to deal with the succession of resignations in the embassy. Cárdenas presented his resignation on July 23.\nAn aristocrat with monarchical inclinations, he was sent to perform the functions of informal diplomatic representative of the Francoist side in the United States, as \"representative of the National government.\" He boasted of the change of editorial line favorable to Franco of La Nueva España publication from September 1937, pointing it out as his own merit. At the end of the war, he was again made Ambassador to the United States in 1939. He served as Ambassador until 1947 when he relinquished his post \"as a result of the December, 1946 United Nations vote that demanded the replacement of the Franco regime with one 'deriving its authority from the governed' and recommended that all member nations recall their ambassadors from Madrid.\" After leaving the United States, he became rector of Spain's School of Diplomacy, holding that position until 1957 while remaining honorary director until his death in 1966.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nOn 27 June 1923, Cárdenas married Lucienne Nano, sister of Frederick Nano, the then secretary of the Romanian legation (who was later appointed Minister of Romania in the United States in 1926). His wife was considered \"to be one of the most beautiful women in Washington\".\nCárdenas died in Madrid on 16 January 1966. His funeral was held in Seville.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nGrand Cross of the Order of Isabella the Catholic (1926)\nGrand Cross of the Most Distinguished Order of Charles III (1951)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "OU (pronounced oh) is a progressive metal band from Beijing, China, consisting of singer Lynn Wu, guitarist Zhang Jing, bassist Chris Cui, and drummer Anthony Vanacore. Their most recent album, II: Frailty, was released in April 2024. \n\n\n== History ==\nOU was formed by drummer and primary songwriter Anthony Vanacore, an American ex-pat who is fluent in Mandarin and originally moved to Beijing to work as a music teacher. Vanacore recruited guitarist Zhang Jing and bassist Chris Cui, both veterans of the local rock and jazz music community in Beijing, and later added singer Lynn Wu. The band lists Devin Townsend, The Gathering, and Radiohead as primary influences.   \nThe band signed with the German label InsideOut Music before ever playing live. They are reportedly the first Chinese rock band to sign with a western record label. The head of InsideOut, Thomas Waber, described OU as \"Very unique and modern, but still familiar sounding, a rare find these days!\" InsideOut released the band's debut album One in May 2022. Lynn Wu gained notice from critics due to her completely Mandarin lyrics and experimental style; several reviewers have compared her singing to Bjork and Kate Bush. The album was also praised for mixing the band's primary progressive metal sound with jazz, electronica, and ambient styles.\nOU gained the attention of labelmate Devin Townsend, who signed on to co-produce their second album. The album II: Frailty was released in April 2024, with Townsend contributing backing vocals on the song \"Purge\". Lynn Wu again earned praise from critics, with one reviewer describing her performance on the album as \" tak[ing] it somewhere stranger and more unsettling\". Another reviewer praised II: Frailty because \"it’s effortless to fall prey to the polyrhythmic hypnosis that OU has mastered,\" while The Prog Report called the album \"one of the year’s most unique releases.\"\n\n\n== Members ==\nLynn Wu – vocals\nZhang Jing – guitar\nChris Cui – bass\nAnthony Vanacore – drums, programming\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nOne (2022)\nII: Frailty (2024)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Comment: I note that you replaced \"exclusive\" with \"prestigious\" neither is appropriate neutral tone. Theroadislong (talk) 08:55, 12 May 2024 (UTC)\n Comment: Mostly not about the subject; none of the sources mention them; KylieTastic (talk) 15:26, 10 May 2024 (UTC)\n\nWilliam Hammerton Smith known familiarly as Bill Smith (b 1967) is a British underwater sonar expert and engineer whose 1997 initiative led to identifying anew the location on the Coniston Water lake-bed of Bluebird K7, the jet enginedhydroplane in which Donald Campbell lost his life whilst attempting to push the Water speed record beyond 300 mph in January 1967. As a result of commercial successes gained by introducing products into global automotive industry supply chains, Smith was free to pursue other interests. He was elected to join the Explorer's Club of New York and was a member for a few years.\n\n\n== Underwater exploration ==\nAs proprietor of Kiltech Underwater, a company specialising in sonar surveys, Bill Smith with his team undertook many high profile deep water searches. Most widely reported was the work surrounding the search for Bluebird K7.\nAn early expedition in 1995, Smith, with co-diver Paul Cairns, set out to explore the wreck of the German battleship Tirpitz which had been bombed and sunk towards the end of World War II. It was located in a Norwegian fjord twenty miles north of the Arctic Circle. The wreck had previously been explored by Jaques Cousteau.\nThe search for Bluebird K7 had begun as no more than an exploration: \"From 1996, for over four years, the team of specialist divers led by Bill Smith had kept the location of the wreck a secret as there was at the early stages no thought of raising K7. On 4 February 2001, The Sunday Telegraph revealed plans to salvage Bluebird. Such plans were being discussed by Smith's team, some members of of the Campbell family, and BBC TV, who were making a documentary about the dives. That evening, BBC TV News showed underwater pictures of K7's tail-fin. By Monday morning the story was across the UK National Media.\" Campbell's body was retrieved from the lake by Bill Smith on 28 May 2001 in the presence of Tonia Bern-Campbell, Campbell's widow. He was interred in Coniston cemetery on 12 September that year after a funeral service at St Andrews Church in Coniston. Bill Smith was a pallbearer.\nWorking closely with police divers, Smith brought his expertise to bear on a number of underwater searches. In 2002, a diver's body was retrieved from Ullswater in the English Lake District: \"Bill Smith, the man responsible for finding Donald Campbell's remains and his speedboat Bluebird from Coniston Water, recovered the body of a missing diver from Ullswater on Saturday. Clifford Purdham went missing during a diving expedition nearly four years ago. Previous attempts to retrieve his body by the Lancashire and Cumbria diving team had faltered because he was in a particularly deep and silted part of the lake. But police said Mr Smith managed to find Mr Purdham using equipment from the Donald Campbell dives.\"\nIn 2006-2007, three young Sikh men drowned in Ullswater, as, in a group of 26, they took part in the recreation of a Sikh Dipping Ceremony. The three were paddling on a trip with a martial arts group in Cumbria when one of them slipped. Bill Smith recovered the three's bodies.\nIn 2004, Bill Smith helped police officers look for evidence in the re-opened Lady in the Lake trial inquiry into the disappearance of Carol Ann Park, using sonar equipment to search for clues with police divers. \"The police asked me to get involved because I have become somewhat of an expert at finding small objects in deep water\" Smith added: \"We went down into the lake (Coniston Water) around January and February last year (2004) and spent a few months painstakingly searching the bottom.\" Bill Smith became an expert witness for the prosecution in the case. With Bill Smith, the police revisited the site where the body was discovered, and found a piece of Westmorland green slate, a stone matching the rocks that made up the wall of the family's bungalow. This crucial piece of evidence was nearly left behind in the search, but, by careful scheduling of the diving operations which had left a slot available at the end of the day, Smith was able to persuade the police team to make \"one last dive\" to recover the piece of slate.\nBill Smith was involved in the exploration of the wreck of HMHS Britannic, (a sister ship to Titanic) in order to ascertain the reasons for its sinking. \"In September 2003, an expedition led by Carl Spencer dived into the wreck. This was the first expedition to dive Britannic where all the bottom divers were using closed circuit rebreathers (CCR).  British Diver Leigh Bishop brought some of the first photographs from inside the wreck and his diver partner Richard Stevenson found that several watertight doors were open. It has been suggested that this was because the mine strike coincided with the change of watches. Alternatively, the explosion may have distorted the doorframes. A number of mine anchors were located off the wreck by sonar expert Bill Smith, confirming the German records of U-73 that Britannic was sunk by a single mine and the damage was compounded by open portholes and watertight doors. Spencer's expedition was broadcast extensively across the world for many years by National Geographic.\"\n\n\n== Recovery of Bluebird K7 ==\nHaving successfully located the wreck of Campbell's Bluebird, Bill Smith became the lead in its recovery, which was thwart with difficulties not only technical, but also legal and ethical. He was able to broker an understanding between the parties with their disparate views which led to a go-ahead for the raising of the craft in its dozen or so separate pieces.\nAs the work to recover K7 and the body of Donald Campbell from the lakebed was underway, Paul Foulkes-Halbard, a former business associate of Campbell and owner of Filching Manor Motor Museum in Polegate, claimed he had acquired ownership of the boat in the course of business dealings with DMC. His claim was rejected by a consent order lodged at the High Court in London on 7 September 2001, which declared Tonia Bern-Campbell and the executors of Campbell's will as the rightful owners. The court further directed that the wreckage raised in March 2001 should be kept at Bill Smith's premises in Newcastle-upon-Tyne from the March date pending their decision on K7's future ownership. The Argus also reported in September 2001: \"It is the family's intention that the boat will be displayed at the Ruskin Museum in Coniston, which will now have to be extended to accommodate it\".\nIn 1998, Mike Rossiter from BBC TV had approached the Bluebird Project team with a view to filming the wreck. He was there at the time K7 was brought ashore.\nAmongst the conflicting views over the recovery were those of the wider family, the Campbell Family Heritage Trust and the Ruskin Museum. Each had different opinions. Jean Wales, Donald Campbell's sister, was opposed in principal to the recovery of the K7 wreck, preferring the status quo of an undisturbed watery grave for her brother side by side with the wreck. She did not attend the funeral service, although she maintained daily contact with the recovery team as both the body, and then the wreckage were brought ashore. Mike Humphreys custodian of the Ruskin Museum was reported to have said at the time: \"It would be wrong to make commercial gain.\" John Hurst, a local newspaper editor wrote: \"Let the brave man and his spectacular boat rest in peace in Coniston.\"",

See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland, the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts passed from 1801 onwards, see the list of acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.  For acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nFor medieval statutes, etc. that are not considered to be acts of Parliament, see the list of English statutes.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number.  Acts are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".\nActs passed by the Parliament of England did not have a short title; however, some of these acts have subsequently been given a short title by acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom (such as the Short Titles Act 1896).\nActs passed by the Parliament of England were deemed to have come into effect on the first day of the session in which they were passed.  Because of this, the years given in the list below may in fact be the year before a particular act was passed.\n\n\n== 1377 (1 Ric. 2) ==\nThe 1st Parliament of King Richard II, which met from 13 October 1377 until 5 December 1377.\n\n(Confirmation of charters, etc.) c. 1 A confirmation of the liberties of the church, and of all statutes not repealed. — repealed by Statute Law Revision Act 1863\n(Peace of the realm, etc.) c. 2 The peace shall be kept, and justice shall be done to all persons. — repealed by Statute Law Revision Act 1863\n(Purveyance) c. 3 Prelants shall have their action of trespass against purveyors offending. — repealed by Statute Law Revision Act 1863\n(Penalties for maintenance) c. 4 The several penalties of several persons that do maintain quarrels. — repealed by Criminal Law Act 1967\n(Officers of the Exchequer) c. 5 The punishment of a clerk of the exchequer making process for a debt paid. — repealed by Statute Law Revision Act 1863\n(Villanies) c. 6 Commissions shall be awarded to enquire of and punish the misbehaviour of villains and land-tenants to their lords. — repealed by Statute Law Revision Act 1863\n(Maintenance) c. 7 There shall be no giving of liveries for maintenance. — repealed by Statute Law Revision Act 1863\n(Protections) c. 8 In what case a protection cum clausula volumus is not allowable. — repealed by Statute Law Revision Act 1863\n(Maintenance, etc.) c. 9 A feoffment of lands or gift of goods for maintenance shall be void.

        "content": "This is a list of acts of the Parliament of England for the years 1399 until 1411.\nFor acts passed during the period 1707–1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland, the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts passed from 1801 onwards, see the list of acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.  For acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nFor medieval statutes, etc. that are not considered to be acts of Parliament, see the list of English statutes.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number.  Acts are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".\nActs passed by the Parliament of England did not have a short title; however, some of these acts have subsequently been given a short title by acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom (such as the Short Titles Act 1896).\nActs passed by the Parliament of England were deemed to have come into effect on the first day of the session in which they were passed.  Because of this, the years given in the list below may in fact be the year before a particular act was passed.\n\n\n== 1399 (1 Hen. 4) ==\nThe 1st Parliament of King Henry IV, which met at Westminster from 6 October 1399 until 19 November 1399.\n\n(Confirmation of liberties, charters and statutes, indemnity, repeal of 21 Rich. 2, etc.) cc. 1–20\nc. 1 A confirmation of the liberties of the church, and of all statutes not repealed.

The team is scheduled to begin play in 2026 as a member of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA).\n\n\n== History ==\nOn 10 May 2024, it was reported that Toronto was awarded a WNBA expansion franchise. It is expected to begin play in the 2026 season.\nThe team will become the 14th in the WNBA and the first to be based outside the United States. The team will be owned by Kilmer Sports Inc., which is led by Toronto-based billionaire Larry Tanenbaum. He is a minority owner and chairman of Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment (MLSE), which owns fellow professional Toronto sports teams, the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Toronto Raptors. Tanenbaum originally pursued the WNBA venture through MLSE, though other members of the board turned it down. CBC.ca reported a source stating the WNBA expansion franchise is expected to play at the Coca-Cola Coliseum, an 8,500-seat arena at Exhibition Place that has hosted most Toronto Marlies AHL games since 2005.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sir John Marshal (1170?–1235) was an English baron and justice.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMarshal was a nephew of William Marshal, first earl of Pembroke, and consequently grandson of John Marshal. His father was probably Anselm, third son of the latter, for John, the eldest, appears to have died childless, while Henry, the youngest, was bishop of Exeter. Anselm Marshal is known only from the 'Histoire de Guillaume le Marechal' (ll. 337–8, 4037–8), where Sire Ansel li Mareschals, Franz e doz e proz e leials, is mentioned as taking part in a great tournament at Lagni-sur-Marne about 1180. John Marshal was probably born about 1170, for he first appears as a knight in 1197, when he accompanied his uncle, William Marshal, on his embassy to Count Baldwin of Flanders (ib. i. 10763). In September 1198 he was fighting under his uncle and Count Baldwin, and was sent by them to bear the news of Philip's retreat from before Arras to King Richard (ib. 11. 10901–17). On 31 January 1203 he was in charge of Falaise (Cat. Hot. Pat. p. 24), and a little later received a grant of the lands of the Count of Évreux in England (Stapleton, Rotuli Normanniæ, ii. clxxiii). In April 1204 he had license to go into Ireland as his uncle's representative, and to hold the stewardship of his lands in Ireland (Sweetman, i. 210, 216), He was still in Ireland on 13 February 1205, and probably remained there till late in 1207, when on 8 November we find him, in company with Meiler FitzHenry, at the king's court at Woodstock (ib. 254, 310, S48). On 12 November he received a grant of the marshalry of Ireland, and of the 'cantred of the vill of Kyhnie' (ib. 353). John Marshal appears at this time to have adhered rather to the king than to his uncle; in June 1210 he accompanied the former on his Irish expedition (ib. 401, 404). As marshal of Ireland he had an annuity of twenty-five marks (ib. 532). On 10 June 1213 he had charge of the castles of Whitchurch and Screward in Shropshire (Cal. Hot. Pat. p. 100), and on 25 January 1214 of the county of Lincoln and its coasts. He was also put in charge of the Welsh marches, and received a grant of the manor of Hingham and hundred of Fourho (ib. p. 109). On 25 June 1215 he received the custody of the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk, with the castles of Norwich and Orford, but surrendered them on 24–8 July in exchange for Somerset, Dorset, and Worcester, with the castles of Sherborne and Dorchester. At this time he also surrendered Lincolnshire (ib. pp. 150–1). On 17 September he received the charge of the forests in the same counties (ib. p. 155 b ). Marshal had supported the king in his struggle with the barons, and had been with him at Runnymede on 15 June. He was now appointed on 4 September to go to Rome on the king's behalf with Richard de Marisco' and others (ib. p, 182 b). He was back in England by the end of the year, and accompanied John on his northward march in December. On 2 June 1216 he had power to take into favour all rebels who surrendered (ib. p. 185). John Marshal was present at the coronation of the young king at Worcester on 28 October, and next year fought under his uncle at Lincoln on 20 May. Soon afterwards he was commissioned with Philip d'Albini to make preparations for opposing the expected French fleet, and presumably was present in the battle with Eustace the Monk on 24 August. Marshal had been made sheriff of Hampshire and custos of Devizes earlier in the year; in 1218 he was a justice of the forest, and in 1219 a justice itinerant for the counties of Lincoln, Nottingham, and Derby (Cal. Hot Glaus, i.407; cf. Shirley, i. 20).\nOn 15 July 1221 he was sent on a mission to Ireland to receive surrender of the justiciarship from Geoffrey de Marisco, which he did on 4 October. In December 1222 he was appointed for another mission to Ireland, though he did not cross over till February 1223. His duty was apparently to advise the new justiciar, Henry of London, archbishop of Dublin, as to the provisioning of the royal castles. On 3 June he received charge, as the king's bailiff, of the lands of Cork, Decies, and Desmond, with their castles, and on the same day the justiciar was specially instructed to act by his advice (Sweetman, i. 1000, 1015, 1062–3, 1083–7, 1107, 1118). Next year he was still in Ireland, and after assisting his cousin, William Marshal, in his war with Hugh de Lacy, was sent to England in October in charge of Hugh (ib. 1205; Ann, Mon. iii. 91). Marshal was one of the sureties for Walter de Lacy, sixth baron Lacy on 13 May 1225, and in August went abroad on a mission for the king (Cal. Hot. Clam. ii. 47, 59). In January 1226 he was sent to the council held by the legate Otto at Westminster to forbid the bishops from incurring any obligation to the Roman church in respect of their lay fees.\nIn February 1228 he was once more sent to Ireland (Sweetman, i. 1563, 1572), in June 1230 was a justice for assize of arms in Norfolk and Suffolk (Shirley, i. 375), and in 1232 was engaged on yet another mission to Ireland, apparently as one of the executors of William Marshal' (d. 1231), and on behalf of his widow, Eleanor, the king's sister (Sweetman, i. 1949; Excerpta e Rot. Fin. i. 217). On 26 September 1234 he witnesses a royal letter at Marlborough, and on 22 February 1235 the contract of marriage between the king's sister Isabella and the Emperor Frederick (Sweetman, i. 21 77 ; Fœdera, i. 223). Marshal died before 27 June 1235 (Recerpta e Hot Fin. i. 284). By his wife Aliva, daughter of Hubert de Rie (d. 1172), who was alive in 1263, when she is described as over ninety years of age (ib. ii. 406 ; Cal. Genealogicum, i. Ill), he had two sons, John and William (Sweetman, i. 2369). John married Margaret de Neubourg, sister of Thomas, sixth earl of Warwick, and after 26 June 1242 was in right of his wife earl of Warwick. He died without children in October 1242. William sided with the barons in 1263–4, and was one of their representatives at the Mise of Amiens. William's grandson, of the same name, was summoned to parliament as baron from 9 January 1309 to 26 November 1313, and was killed at Bannockburn in 1314 (Flores Historiarum, iii. 159, Rolls Ser.) John, son of William II, died in 1316, and his barony passed with his sister Hawyse to Robert, lord Morley, and was held by the Morleys, Lovels, and Parkers, barons Morley, till 1686, when it fell into abeyance.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Kingsford, Charles Lethbridge (1893). \"Marshal, John (1170?-1235)\".

        "content": "Candy Funhouse is a family-owned business based out of Mississauga, Ontario in Canada. They serve as an online confectionery retailer and employ more than 40 employees across North America. Candy Funhouse offers over 3000 confectionery options at a time on its .com and .ca websites.\n\n\n== History ==\nCandy Funhouse is a Canadian e-commerce confectionery brand founded by Jamal Hejazi in 2018.\nAfter its initial online launch, the Canadian-based company grew a significant online following, particularly during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.\nThe circulation of viral social media content partly aided online growth. This increased visibility led to interactions with notable figures in the sports industry, such as Giannis Antetokounmpo and others. Giannis Antetokounmpo and his family later became owners of the confectionary store.\n\n\n== Products and Services ==\nRecognized for its assortment of specialty snacks and nostalgic candies, Candy Funhouse expanded its product offerings in 2020 by introducing the Candy Funhouse Fun Box line. \nDuring a partnership rollout in 2023, they launched a limited-time Giannis Antetokounmpo Fun Box. In 2024 they introduced Mitch’s Mix, a promotional Fun Box in collaboration with Skip the Dishes and Mitch Marner, Toronto Maple Leafs Right Wing.\nFollowing the announcement of Giannis’ stake in the company, Candy Funhouse launched its .com website, expanding its reach across North America. \nCandy Funhouse’s selection of products ranges between nostalgic finds and popular snacks. Products include but are not limited to, Kinder Chocolate, Oreo, Pocky, Hi-Chew Candy, Warheads, and Nerds. The online candy retailer is known for carrying limited edition variations of these cult-classic snacks.\n\n\n== Notable Media Attention ==\n\n\n=== Candyologists ===\nTrademarked by the confectionary brand in 2021, Candyologists are known as the “experts of candy” and offer their insights on the latest sweets that enter the market. This role is what initially inspired the Chief Candy Officer position.\n\n\n=== Chief Candy Officer (CCO) ===\nCandy Funhouse made headlines in 2022 when it announced it was offering a $100,000 salary for its first Chief Candy Officer (CCO). The role requires the CCO to taste test the candy inventory alongside the Candyologists. \nIt was later revealed that they would be turning the CCO selection process into a reality TV show, partnering with Fly on the Wall (producers of Big Brother). Giannis Antetokounmpo also signed on as an Executive Producer.\n\n\n=== Giannis Antetokounmpo ===\nIn 2020, Milwaukee Bucks All-Star Giannis Antetokounmpo posted a video of himself opening a Candy Funhouse box. He claimed the candy box was something he needed at the time due to Covid-19 restrictions.\nIn June 2023, Candy Funhouse announced that Giannis Antetokounmpo and his brothers Thanasis, Kostas and Alex became shareholders and part-owners of the confectionery brand. \n\n\n=== Collaborations and Community Outreach ===\nNotable collaborations include a limited edition Skip the Dishes x Mitch Marner Fun Box in 2024. Candy Funhouse has previously partnered with charitable foundations such as Ronald McDonald Charity House in Toronto and Giannis Antetokounmpo’s family foundation, CAFF.\n\n\n== Cultures and Values ==\nCandy Funhouse sits at the intersection of candy and pop culture. They emphasize creating meaningful experiences that resonate with its audience. \n“At the intersection of pop culture and candy, you'll find Candy Funhouse, the largest online candy retailer that prides itself on creating meaningful experiences worth sharing!”\n\n\n== References ==",

He is Provost's Professor of Theology and Culture at Reformed Theological Seminary. He has authored books on African American theology and the church's global mission.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nEllis was born in 1946. He grew up in Gary Indiana and attended Hampton University in the late 1960s. He wanted to join the Air Force like his father, a WWII veteran and Tuskegee airman. But mix-ups with his draft papers made the government think he was dodging service. Even though he didn't have to go to Vietnam, he lost faith in the system.\nEllis holds a BA from Hampton University, a Master of Arts in religion from Westminster Theological Seminary, and a PhD from Oxford Graduate School. He studied under Francis Schaeffer at L'Abri in Ollon, Switzerland.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1969, Ellis became Senior Campus Minister in New York. From 1979 to 1989, he served as Assistant Pastor of Forest Park Community Church in Baltimore. He also was a faculty member at Chesapeake Theological Seminary and seminar instructor for Prison Fellowship. From 1986 to 2009, Ellis was an adjunct instructor at the Center for Urban Theological Studies and Dean of Intercultural Studies at Westminster Theological Seminary.\nEllis is assistant professor of practical theology at Redeemer Seminary in Dallas, Texas, and the associate pastor for cultural apologetics at New City Fellowship. He is the academic dean of The Makazi Institute, which he cofounded to train cultural analysts.\nEllis has authored several books promoting intercultural understanding and engagement within theological education. His work seeks to apply biblical theology to the concerns of different cultures, particularly minority groups.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nEllis married his first wife in 1969, they had two children and were married for seventeen years. In 2011, Ellis married his former student, Karen Bishop.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nEllis, C.F. (1995). Free at Last?: The Gospel in the African-American Experience. InterVarsity Press.

        "content": "This is a list of acts of the Parliament of England for the years 1411 until 1460.\nFor acts passed during the period 1707–1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland, the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts passed from 1801 onwards, see the list of acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.  For acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nFor medieval statutes, etc. that are not considered to be acts of Parliament, see the list of English statutes.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number.  Acts are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".\nActs passed by the Parliament of England did not have a short title; however, some of these acts have subsequently been given a short title by acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom (such as the Short Titles Act 1896).\nActs passed by the Parliament of England were deemed to have come into effect on the first day of the session in which they were passed.  Because of this, the years given in the list below may in fact be the year before a particular Act was passed.\n\n\n== 1422 (1 Hen. 6) ==\nThe 1st Parliament of King Henry VI, which met at Westminster from 9 November 1422 until 18 December 1422.\n\n(Mint) c. 1 The King's council may assign money to be coined in as many places as they will. — repealed by Statute Law Revision Act 1863\n(Purveyance) c. 2 All the statutes of purveyors shall be proclaimed in every county four times in the year. — repealed by Statute Law Revision Act 1863\n(Irishmen) c. 3 What sort of Irishmen only may come to dwell in England. — repealed by Statute Law Revision Act 1863\n(Mint) c. 4 The master of the mint shall send to the mint to be coined all the gold and silver that shall come to his hands by exchange. — repealed by Statute Law Revision Act 1863\nc. 5 A certain allowance made to those which were retained to serve King Hen.

        "content": "The following is a list of weather events that occurred on Earth in the year 2001. There were several natural disasters around the world from various types of weather, including tornadoes, floods and tropical cyclones. The deadliest disaster was Typhoon Lingling in November, which caused 379 fatalities. The costliest event of the year was Hurricane Michelle, which caused  $2.43 billion in damages.   \n2001 was the second hottest year on record at the time behind 1998, which was amplified by the end of a years-long La Niña. The Atlantic and Pacific tropical storm seasons were both unusually active.\nMany \n\n\n== Winter storms and cold waves ==\nIn January, a winter storm hit parts of the northern United States, causing an injury but no fatalities. \n\n\n== Droughts, heat waves, and wildfires ==\n\nIn May, a severe drought affected portions of the United States, but caused no injuries or fatalities. 2001 had a relatively low amount of droughts and heat waves. \nLarge wildfires took place in California in 2001, killing over 2 people, destroying over 390 buildings, and causing US$196 million (2001 USD) in damages. The Observation Fire was the largest fire to take place during the season, burning over 67,000 acres of land. \nThe Poe Fire in September was the most destructive wildfire of 2001, injuring over 23 people and destroying more than 133 buildings in parts of north-central California. No fatalities were reported.\n\n\n== Floods ==\n\nIn April, a historic flood occurred in portions of the Upper Mississippi River, rising to the highest water levels for the river since 1965. Many homes were washed away, and an unknown number of injuries were reported.\nOn May 21 a large flood in Lensk, Russia washed away 400+ homes and left over 2,000 people homeless.\nOn June 4, the 2001 Southeastern United States floods, were triggered by Tropical Storm Allison, killed over 30 people in the Houston, Texas area and left over 40,000 people homeless. Other smaller floods were also triggered as a result of Allison, but none were significant. \n\n\n== Tornadoes ==\n\nThere were 1,215 tornadoes in the United States, resulting in 40 deaths.In February, a tornado outbreak caused $35 million in damage, and one tornado killed 6 people. In April a large tornado outbreak killed 4 people and injured 18. In September, the tornado outbreak of September 24, 2001 killed 2 people, injured 57 others, and caused $105.157 million (2001 USD) in damages. In November, the Tornado outbreak of November 23–24, 2001 impacted the southern United States, killing 13 and injuring 219.  \n\n\n== Tropical cyclones ==\n\nIn 2001, tropical cyclones and hurricanes formed in various parts of the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. A total of 128 tropical cyclones formed within tropical cyclone basins, and 83 of them were named by weather agencies when they attained maximum sustained winds of 35 knots (65 km/h; 40 mph). Typhoon Faxai is the strongest tropical cyclone throughout the year, peaking with a pressure of 915 hPa (27.02 inHg) and attaining 10-minute sustained winds of 195 km/h (120 mph). \nThe deadliest tropical cyclone of the year was Lingling in the West Pacific which caused 379 fatalities in total as it struck the Philippines and Vietnam, while the costliest storm of the year was Michelle, with a damage cost of around $2.43 billion as it catastrophically affected the Greater Antilles and the Bahamas in late October. \n23 Category 3 tropical cyclones formed, and 2 Category 5 tropical cyclones formed. The accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index for the 2001, as calculated by Colorado State University was 672.4 units.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Demtel International (commonly shortened to Demtel) was an Australian home shopping and marketing company best known for television informercials during the 1990s. The name Demtel was a portmanteau of \"demonstration television\". As well as launching the media career of presenter Tim Shaw, Demtel's ubiquitous presence on commercial television during its peak saw the name as well as various marketing tactics and slogans used by the company being adopted as tropes in Australian vernacular.\n\n\n== History ==\nDemtel International was first registered as an Australian company in 1985, founded by Warwick Doughty and David Hammer, who had formerly worked with the local subsidiary of international marketing company K-tel. During the early 1980s, the Demtel name had been used to market a catalogue of compilation albums, working with artists including Gene Pierson and minor record companies. Pierson was encouraged by David Hammer to come up with \"something really crazy\", resulting in the 1983 album Beatle Barkers. On the back of Demtel's television marketing campaign the novelty album, consisting of tracks by The Beatles performed by an ensemble of dogs, sold 860,000 copies.\nIn 1988, the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs took Demtel International to court over misleading advertisements that misrepresented plastic costume jewellery as genuine, valuable items. The company, which sold more than 70,000 units of the stock was fined $12,000. Despite this, the company recorded sales of $6.9 million in 1989–90, a figure which grew to $19.6 million in 1992-93 even as the nation endured an economic recession.\nBetween 1992 and 1995, Tim Shaw presented Demtel's infomercials, which received as much as 23 minutes of air-time per day. Demtel had seen the success of Ron Popeil's infomercials in the United States that used phrases like \"But wait, there's more!\" to great effect. In Shaw, they had an Australian to become the face of the company and deliver the same lines. This proved to be highly effective, driving sales of over 1,000,000 steak knives and 600,000 compact discs during his time with the company, while Shaw himself gained national fame and recognition as \"the Demtel man\". In 1994 it was reported the company spent close to $10 million per year on advertising.\nIn July 1993, Demtel was sold by Hammer and Doughty to International Media Management (IMM), an ASX listed company with intentions of developing it into a stand-alone cable TV home shopping network. Within a year of sale, reports emerged of late payments to creditors by Demtel and legal disputes with the previous owners, causing IMM's share price to plummet. Amid ongoing legal disputes between IMM and the former owners relating to royalties and commissions, Shaw parted ways with Demtel in 1995. He was replaced by veteran talk-show host Don Lane. Shaw revealed in 2019 that despite the company's success during his time as their spokesman, he received only $200 from Demtel for each informercial he appeared in.\nIn November 1995, IMM launched The Value Channel on the Galaxy subscription television service, with Lane signed to host some of the programming. With IMM now focussing on this venture, Demtel's popularity waned in the late 1990s, competing with the rise of online services and emergence of dedicated home shopping networks. The company was wound down and liquidated in 2001.\nAn investigation by the Australian Federal Police into IMM's Chief Executive Officer Michael Milne would result in his conviction for tax fraud and money laundering in 2008. These charges related to a 13-year period, including falsifying his personal tax returns while in charge of Demtel. In November 2010, he was sentenced to four years and nine months in prison.\n\n\n== Products and marketing ==\nDemtel's business model involved purchasing bulk quantities of products, which it marketed by a telephone-order home shopping service, directly handling distribution from a central warehouse via regular post. Products were sold with a \"no questions asked, money back guarantee\", and were often bundled to create extra value and urgency. A common offer involved the inclusion of six free steak knives if the customer called within 15 minutes of the infomercial airing on television.\nProducts marketed by Demtel included kitchen knives, compact disc collections, pocket cameras, run-free pantyhose and other kitchen utensils. The infomercials themselves were usually between one and two minutes and included demonstrations of the product. Demtel's model was effective at creating consumer demand, but this left it vulnerable to competition from discount retailers who could stock the same products. This allowed discount retailers to quickly respond by undercutting Demtel's prices in store and making products immediately available to customers.\n\n\n== Cultural impact ==\n\n\n=== Politics ===\nUse of \"Demtel\", often in a disparaging way became a popular trope in Australian politics. Usually, this is a reference to empty spin or election sweeteners. Demtel references occur in political commentary and analysis as well as in parliament itself, with many examples including:\n\nIn 2010, Premier of Queensland Anna Bligh referred to the opposition Liberal National Party's website as providing \"No policies, 4,000 shopping items, and every one of them at a Demtel discount,\"\nCanberra Times cartoonist Geoff Pryor depicted Prime Minister Paul Keating as \"the Demtel man\" during 1995, a reference to perceived pork barrelling and broken election promises.\nSenator Joe Ludwig in 2006 likened a government bill to a marketing trick, offering to \"...sell you a Demtel square plastic box with nothing in it as well.\"\nIn a 1998 immigration debate, Pauline Hanson told the House of Representatives \"We have enough unemployment without multinationals bringing in foreign workers. But as the Demtel man says, But wait, there's more.\"\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nIn Australian rules football, the term \"steak knives\" is sometimes used to describe a deal sweetener, particularly in relation to player drafts. This is a direct reference to Demtel's promotional offer of free steak knives to incentivise a deal. A player may be referred to as a \"steak knife\" if they are included as part of a trade between players of higher value, such as in the case of Collingwood's Jack Crisp.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTim Shaw\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Frederick Adam Wright (16 February 1869, Gorleston-on-Sea  – 2 August 1946, Falmouth) was an English classical scholar known for his translations of Greek and Latin classics.\n\n\n== Life ==\nHe graduated from Great Yarmouth School and Magdalen College, Cambridge. He taught at schools in Brighton and Mill Hill (now in the London Borough of Barnet). From 1913 to 1935 held the chair of Classics at Birkbeck College (afterwards part of the University of London).\n\n\n=== Works ===\nWright wrote A History of Later Latin Literature (1931); A History of Later Greek Literature from the Death of Alexander in 323 BC to the Death of Justinian in 565 AD (1932); a biography of Marcus Agrippa, Organizer of Victory (1937); and an essay on Plautus, Catullus and Ovid, Three Roman Poets (1938). In 1916, he published a collection of his own poetry, The House on the Hill, and Other Poems. Of particular interest is Wright's monograph Feminism in Greek Literature from Homer to Aristotle (1923), an essay on the place of women in ancient Greece based on literary sources, in which Wright concludes that the debased position of women was an important reason for the decline of Greek civilisation.\nWright translated the letters of Alciphron (1922); a collection of love poems from the Palatine Anthology, The Girdle of Aphrodite (1923) and The Poets of the Greek Anthology (1924); Ovid's Ars Amatoria, translated as The Lover's Handbook (1923); the collected poems of Meleager of Gadara (1924); select epigrams of Martial (1925); the works of Liutprand of Cremona (1930); and select letters of St. Jerome (1933), among others. In addition, he edited and partially rewrote Thomas Underdown's Elizabethan translation of Heliodorus's Aethiopica.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nAlumni Cantabrigienses. Part II.

        "content": "The 1973–74 season was the 44th season of competitive football played by Hereford United Football Club and their second in the Football League. Following promotion in their debut league season, the club competed in Division Three, as well as the League Cup, FA Cup and Welsh Cup.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nHereford enjoyed a steady start to the season and were as high as fifth in the table by the end of October. A sequence of only four wins in 17 matches between December and March checked their progress, but a nine-match unbeaten run pulled them clear of danger to an eventual 18th-place finish, eight points above the relegation zone.\nIn the FA Cup, Hereford evoked memories of their giant-killing exploits two years earlier with a 2–1 replay win over West Ham United in the third round. Alan Jones struck the winning goal after a late Pat Holland equaliser had denied Hereford victory in the first match at Upton Park. The Cup run ended in the next round at the hands of Bristol City.\nOn 26 September 1973, Brian Evans, a pre-season signing from Swansea City, became the first Hereford player to win an international cap when he featured in Wales' 3–0 defeat against Poland in a World Cup qualifier.\n\n\n== Squad ==\nPlayers who made one appearance or more for Hereford United F.C. during the 1973-74 season\n\n\n== Third Division ==\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n=== Third Division ===\n\n\n=== League Cup ===\n\n\n=== FA Cup ===\n\n\n=== Welsh Cup ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\nBibliography\nParrott, Ron (1998).

        "content": "Neometanema is a genus of phagotrophic flagellates belonging to the Euglenida, a diverse group of flagellates in the phylum Euglenozoa. It is the sole genus within the monotypic family Neometanemidae and suborder Metanemina. It composes the order Natomonadida together with a closely related clade of osmotrophs known as Aphagea.\n\n\n== Description ==\nNeometanema is a genus of unicellular flagellates, microscopic eukaryotes or protists that swim by using two flagella that are equally long. The cells are flattened in shape, with a visible feeding apparatus. It is a euglenid, characterized by the presence of pellicle strips below the cell surface; in particular, Neometanema species have 22 pellicle strips arranged helically through the cell. Like other euglenids of the Spirocuta clade, Neometanema cells are capable of metaboly (flexible peristaltic movement), although more weakly than others. They are distinguished by the closely related genera Heteronema and Anisonema by their skidding motility that involves both flagella.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Hervey de Montmorency (fl. 1169) was an Anglo-Norman adventurer and invader of Ireland. His name also appears variously as Mount-Maurice, Monte Mauricii, Monte Marisco, Monte Marecy, Montmarreis, Montmorenci, Mumoreci, and Momorci.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMontmorency may not unreasonably be held to have belonged to the same line as the Montmorencies of France (of this there is no conclusive proof, but see André Duchesne, Histoire Généalogique de la Maison de Montmorency, pp. 9, 53, 87, 92; Montmorency-Morrès, Genealogical Memoir, passim; L'Art de Vérifier, xii. 9, and other French genealogists; the forms of the name borne by Hervey and the French Montmorencies suggest a common stock, and Hervé was a Christian name much used by the French house; in connection with this see Giraldus Cambrebsis, De rebus a se gestis, ii. c. 2, where the canon, afterwards the dean, of Paris there mentioned, the son of the castellan de Monte Mauricii,' was Herve, son of Matthieu ' de Montmorency; ' compare Duchesne, u.s. pp. 97, 106, and Preuves, pp. 39, 55). Hervey is said by M. de Montmorency-Morres to have been the son of a Robert FitzGeoffrey, lord of lands in Thorney and of Huntspill-Marreis, Somerset, by his wife Lucia, daughter of Alexander de Alneto, and to have been half-brother of Stephen, constable of Cardigan. This bit of genealogy has, however, been made up to fall in with the erroneous belief that Giraldus asserts that Hervey was the uncle of Robert FitzStephen, and may be dismissed at once. According to Duchesne (u.s.), followed in 'L'Art de Verifier les Dates' (u.s.), Hervey was the son of Bouchard IV de Montmorency, by Agnes, daughter of Raoul de Pontoise ; he served Louis VI and Louis VII of France, and coming to England married Elizabeth, daughter of Robert de Beaumont (d. 1118), Count of Meulan, and widow of Gilbert de Clare (d. 1148), earl of Pembroke, which would make him stepfather of Earl Richard, called Strongbow. Hervey, however, was paternal uncle of Earl Richard (Giraldus, Expugnatio Hibernica, p. 230), and must therefore have been a son by a second marriage of Adeliza, daughter of Hugh, count of Clermont (William of Jumièges, viii. 37), who married for her first husband Gilbert FitzRichard, the father of Gilbert, earl of Pembroke (see a charter in MS. Register of Thorney, pt. iv. c. 35, f. 30, printed in Monasticon, ii. 601, where Hervey is described as brother of Gilbert and the other children of Adeliza and Gilbert FitzRichard, and pt. ix. c. 11, f. 9, where Adeliza is styled 'de Monte Moraci, domina de Deneford,' and is also styled 'domina de Deneford,' pt. iv. c. 10, f. 2 b ; see also pt. iv. c. 8, f. 2). The father of Hervey was no doubt called 'de Monte Moraci,' or Mount Maurice, but nothing has been ascertained about him (it is impossible to accept M. de Montmorency-Morres's Hervey, son of Geoffrey, lord of Thorney, as an historic person, while his theory that there were two Herveys, cousins-German, is a mere device to get out of the difficulty caused by his confusing together Earl Richard and Robert FitzStephen).\nHervey was in early life a gallant warrior ('olim Gallica militia strenuus,' Expugnatio, p. 328, translated by Hooker, he ' had good experience in the feats of war, after the manner used in France,' Irish Historic, p. 38. This passage was no doubt the ground of Duchesne's assertion that he served Louis VI and Louis VII). He was a man of broken fortunes when he was sent by his nephew, Earl Richard, to Ireland with Robert FitzStephen in 1169 to report on aft'airs there to the earl. After the victory of these first invaders at Wexford their ally Derruot, king of Leinster, rewarded him with two cantreds of land on the coast between Wexford and Waterford, and he appears to have shared in Dermot's raids on Ossory and Offaly (Song of Dermot and the Earl, 11. 606, 749, 930). On the landing of Raymond FitzGerald at Dundunnolf, near Waterford, Hervey joined him, and shared in his victory over the people of Waterford and the chief, Donnell O'Phelan. Giraldus puts into his mouth a speech recommending the slaughter of seventy Waterford men who had been taken prisoners; but the Anglo-Norman poet of the Conquest gives a wholly different version of the event (ib. 11. 1474–89). He remained with Raymond in an entrenched position in Bannow Bay until they were reinforced on 23 August by the arrival of Earl Richard, who was joined by Hervey. Raymond's mission to Henry II having failed [see under Fitzgerald, Raymond], Earl Richard sent Hervey to the king, probably in August 1171 (Gesta Henrini, i. 24), to make his peace. On his return Hervey met the earl at Waterford, told him that Henry required his attendance, accompanied him to England, and at Newnham, Gloucestershire, was the means of arranging matters between him and the king. During Henry's visit to Ireland Hervey probably acted as the marshal of the royal army ; for in his charter for the foundation of the convent of Dunbrothy, where his name is given as ' Hereveius de Monte Moricii,' he is described as ' marshal of the army of the king for Ireland, and seneschal of all the lands of Earl Richard' (Chartularies of St. Mary's Abbey, ii. 151). While Earl Richard was in Normandy in 1173 Hervey was left in command. On the earl's return he is said to have found the Irish ready to rebel, and the troops dissatisfied and clamouring that Raymond should command them ; for Hervey is represented as having wasted the money that was due to them in action (Expugnatio, p. 308). The earl yielded to the demand of the soldiers, and gave Raymond the command, but shortly afterwards refused to appoint him constable of Leinster, and gave the office to Hervey. To the bad advice of Hervey Giraldus attributes the earl's disastrous expedition into Munster in 1174 (ib. p. 310 ; compare Annals of the Four Masters, sub an. iii. 15, 17). After the defeat at Thurles the earl was forced to shut himself up in Waterford ; he sent for Raymond to come to his help, and appointed him constable in place of Hervey (the order of these events is uncertain ; that adopted here, which is also followed in the article on Raymond Fitzgerald, is that of the ' Expugnatio ; 'the order followed in the ' Song of Dermot ' is on the whole represented in the article on Richard de Clare, 'Strongbow ; ' see Expuynatio, p. 308 n. 2, and p. 310 n. 2). Hervey received from the earl a grant of O'Barthy, of which the present barony of Bargy, co. Wexford, forms a part, was outwardly reconciled to his rival Raymond, and married Nesta, daughter of Maurice Fitzgerald (d. 1176), and Raymond's first cousin. Nevertheless, in 1175 he sent messages to the king, accusing Raymond of a design to make himself independent of the royal authority, and was evidently believed by Henry.\nHervey's power in Ireland was probably shaken by the death of his nephew, Earl Richard, in 1176, and we find him in England in 1177, when he witnessed a charter of Henry II at Oxford, at which date his lands between Wexford and Waterford were made to do service to Waterford, then held by William Fitz Aldhelm (Gesta Henrici II, i. 163, 164). In 1178 he made a grant of lands in present co. Wexford to the convent of Buildwas, Shropshire, for the foundation on them of a Cistercian house (the date is determined by the attestation of Felix, bishop of Ossory). These lands included Dunbrodiki, or Dunbrothy, in the barony of Shelburne, and there a few years later was founded the convent called ' de portu S. Marise.' In 1179 he became a monk of Christ Church, Canterbury (Annals ap. Chartularies of St. Mary's Abbey, ii. 304 ; Giraldus dates his retirementabout 1183 ; see Expugnatio, p. 352), making a grant to that house of lands and churches in Ireland. Many of these have been identified (Kilkenny Archæological Journal, I 1855, iii. 216) ; they were in 1245 transferred by the convent to the abbot of Tintern, co. Wexford, for 625 marks, and an annual rent of ten marks, with the obligation of maintaining a chaplain at St. Brendan's chapel at Bannow, to pray for the souls of Hervey and other benefactors (Liters Cantuar. iii. Pref. xl. sq. 361, 362). Giraldus says that Hervey was not a better man after his retirement than he had been before. A Hervey, cellarer and chanter of Christ Church, was excommunicated by Archbishop Baldwin for his share in the great quarrel between the archbishop and the convent, and was alive in 1191 (Epistolæ Cantuar. ed. Syubbs, pp. 308, 312, 315, 333), but he could scarcely have been Hervey de Mount-Maurice, who is described as 'con versus et benefactor' in the records of his obit on 12 March (MSS. Cott. Nero C. ix. i. if. 5, 6, Galba E. iii. 2, fol. 32). M. de Montmorency-Morres asserts, apparently without any ground, that he died in 1205, and says that his nephews, Geoffrey de Marisco and Richard, bishop of Leighlin, transported his body from Canterbury to Dunbrothy, where they erected a tomb of black Kilkenny marble to him in the conventual church. Of this tomb and the recumbent figure upon it he gives two engravings; it was overthrown in 1798, and has since perished (Genealogical Memoir of Montmorency, plates 1 and 2). Hervey left no legitimate children (Expugnatio, pp. 345, 409). He is described by Giraldus as a tall and handsome man, with blue and prominent eyes, and cheerful countenance ; he was broad-chested, and had long hands and arms, and well-shaped legs and feet. Morally, Giraldus says he belied his appearance; he was extremely lustful, envious, and deceitful, a slanderer, untrustworthy, and changeable, more given to spite than to gallant deeds, and fonder of pleasure than of profitable enterprise (ib. pp. 327, 328). From this estimate and from other evil things that Giraldus says of Hervey large deductions should be made, for Giraldus wrote in the interest of his relatives, the Geraldines, and speaks violently of all who opposed them. As, then, Hervey was the rival and enemy of Raymond Fitzgerald, he and his doings are represented in the ' Expugnatio ' in a most unfavourable light. Even Giraldus, however, allows that Hervey was one of the four principal conquerors of the Irish (ib. p. 409).\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Hunt, William (1894). \"Mount-Maurice, Hervey de\".

        "content": "George Thornley (1614 – after 1657) was an English writer, known for his oft-reprinted translation of the Greek novel Daphnis and Chloe.\n\n\n== Life ==\nGeorge Thornley was born in 1614. He was the son of a certain Thomas Thornley described as \"of Cheshire\", and was at Repton School under Thomas Whitehead, the first master appointed on the re-founding of the school in 1621. Whitehead's usher at the time, John Lightfoot, was afterwards master of St. Catherine's, and was elected Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge in 1655. Whitehead sent many of his scholars to his old college, Christ's, and it was here that Thornley was admitted sizar—sizarships were given to poor students—under Mr. King in 1631. This King is the Edward King who is the subject of Milton’s Lycidas, and Milton resided at Christ's from 1625 to 1632. In 1635 Thornley proceeded Bachelor in Arts, and we hear no more of him, save that in his forty-fourth year he is described upon the title-page of his Daphnis and Chloe as \"Gentleman\".\n\n\n=== Daphnis and Chloe ===\nThornley's only known work is his Daphnis and Chloe (1657). In making his translation Thornley had before him the parallel Latin and Greek edition of Jungermann, published in 1605. According to J. M. Edmonds, who revised Thornley's translation for the Loeb Classical Library, \"His [Thornley's] English is often suggested by Jungermann's Latin; in one or two places he has made mistakes through paying more attention to the Latin than to the Greek; and he sometimes prefers a reading only to be found in Jungermann's notes.\" Edmonds gives the following, glowing assessment of Thornley's sole achievement: \"There is nothing on Thornley’s title-page to tell us that his book is a translation, and if his 'most sweet and pleasant pastoral romance' ever came into the hands of the 'young ladies' for whom he wrote it, they may well have supposed it to be his original work. For although his rendering is generally close enough to the Greek to satisfy the most fastidious modern scholar, it has all the graces of idiom, rhythm, and vocabulary characteristic of the best English prose of the day. [...] He always shows you that he has a complete grasp of the situation he is describing. He not only sees and hears, but he thinks and feels. He knows what it was like to be there.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

It reached No. 49 on the UK Physical Albums chart and No. 97 Scottish Albums Chart.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nUpon release, Alexis Peditris of The Guardian described the set as \"lavish\", and added \"See That Girl, now presenting her oeuvre, MacColl remains a more complex figure than her everywoman public image suggested.\"\nBob Mehr of The New York Times commented: \"The release of “See That Girl” has given MacColl's friends and fans an opportunity to reassess her musical legacy, as well as consider what might have been.\"\nRecord Collector notes that \"It's a voyage that stops off at vintage girl group tropes, ironic country, indie guitar anthems, trip-hop and salsa, all underpinned by an impossibly attractive and very English conversational vocal style.\" Daily Express gave the set 5 stars, and described the set as \"a huge overview of a talented singer-songwriter\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nAdapted from the box set liner notes.\n\n\n=== Disc one: The Singles ===\n\n\n=== Disc two: 1979-1983 ===\n\n\n=== Disc three: 1983-1989 ===\n\n\n=== Disc four: 1989-1992 ===\n\n\n=== Disc five: 1993-1996 ===\n\n\n=== Disc six: 1999-2000 ===\n\n\n=== Disc seven: BBC Recordings 1981-2000 ===\n\n\n=== Disc eight: Other People's Songs ===\n\n\n== Credits ==\nAdapted from the box set liner notes.\n\nWritten By – Kirsty MacColl (tracks: 1-1, 1–3, 1–4, 1–6, 1–8, 1–10, 1–12 to 1–18, 1-20, 1-21, 2–1 to 2-20, 3–1 to 3-3, 3–5 to 3–10, 3–12 to 3–19, 3-21, 4–1 to 4–10, 4–12, 4–14 to 4–19, 5–1 to 5–11, 5–13, 5–14, 5–17 to 5-20, 6–1 to 6–14, 6–16, 6–18, 7–2, 7–4 to 7–8, 7–11 to 7–15, 7–17, 7–18, 7-20, 7-21, 7-23, 8–3, 8–4)\nProducer – Alison Moyet (tracks: 8–10), Andy Roberts (8) (tracks: 5–15), Baboon Farm (tracks: 5–1 to 5-5, 5–9, 5–10), Barry 'Bazza' Farmer* (tracks: 1–2 to 1–5, 2-2, 2–3, 2–7 to 2–9, 2–11), Boz Boorer (tracks: 1–19, 5–13, 5–14), Chris Whatmough (tracks: 7–19, 7-20), Colin Stuart (tracks: 3–19 to 3-21), Dave Jordan (tracks: 2–12 to 2-21), Dave Ruffy* (tracks: 1-20, 1-21, 6–1, 6–2, 6–4 to 6–7), Gavin Povey (tracks: 3–1, 3–2, 8–4), Johnny Marr (tracks: 3–19), Kirsty MacColl (tracks: 1–6, 1–18, 1–19 to 1-21, 2–10, 3–1, 3–2, 3–5, 3–6, 3-20, 3-21, 5–7, 5–8, 5–13, 5–14, 6–1, 6–2, 6–4 to 6–7, 8–4), Liam Sternberg (tracks: 1-1, 2–1), Mark E Nevin (tracks: 5–7, 5–8), Pete Glenister (tracks: 1-20, 1-21, 6–1, 6–2, 6–4 to 6–7, 6–9), Peter Watts (tracks: 7–4 to 7–10), Steve Lillywhite (tracks: 1–7 to 1–17, 3–4, 3–9 to 3–18, 4–1 to 4–10, 5–6, 8–14), Vic Van Vugt* (tracks: 1–18, 5–1 to 5-5, 5–9, 5–10)\nProducer [Additional Production] – Mint Royale (tracks: 6–1)\nProducer, Mixed By – Peter Kaye (tracks: 5–11, 5–12)\nEngineer – Phil Bodger (tracks: 2–12 to 2-21)\nMixed By – Jeremy Wheatley (tracks: 6–1), Pete Glenister (tracks: 6–9)\nRecorded By – Kirsty MacColl (tracks: 5–16, 5–17), Pete Glenister (tracks: 5–16, 5–17)\nRemix – Colin Stuart (tracks: 4–1), Fred Defaye (tracks: 4–1, 4–3), Steve Lillywhite (tracks: 4–2)\nRemix, Producer [Additional Production] – UR Production (tracks: 6–2)\nRemix, Producer [Additional] – Howard Gray (tracks: 4–9)\nArranged By – Kirsty MacColl (tracks: 5–14)\nSleeve Notes – Jude Rogers\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

Though a Russian citizen, she stated in an interview with The Times in 2024 that \"I'm not Russian\", and expressed a desire to become a British citizen.

        "content": "Nicholson Alexander Nathaniel Ducreay (20 December 1930 – 1 July 2017) was a Dominican politician.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nDucreay was born on 20 December 1930 in Wesley. His mother, Enid Matilda Ducreay, was from Cochrane and her family owned the Stewart Hall Estate. His father, Nicholson Thomas, was headteacher of Wesley Primary School. Ducreay attended Dominica Grammar School in Roseau between 1944 and 1949. After graduation, he worked as a teacher at the Cochrane Primary School for three years, before establishing his own lumber business in Roseau.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nThere was a turning point in Dominican politics on 24 May 1955 when Emmanuel Christopher Loblack and Phyllis Shand Allfrey established the new Dominica Labour Party (DLP). Ducreary was by this time well known in Roseau, particularly for his public speaking. Allfrey approached him in 1957 to ask him to join the DLP and run as a candidate for the Roseau North constituency in the 1957 Dominican general election. Ducreary won his election on 15 August and took his place in the legislature with two other DLP members: Edward Oliver LeBlanc and R. P. St. Luce. There were only eight constituencies at the time and the other five seats were held by the governing party, Frank Baron's Dominica United People's Party (DUPP).\nIn July 1960, DUPP legislators Lionel Laville and L. C. Didier resigned, forcing a new general election on 17 January 1961. Ducreay won re-election and the DLP won a majority of the increased eleven constituencies. In the newly-formed government, Ducreay was appointed as Minister of Trade and Production, under LeBlanc as chief minister. He held the position for five years, during which time the banana and citrus producers thrived and many new infrastructure projects were funded by the British Colonial Development and Welfare Fund. This included bringing \"roads, ports, new schools, health clinics and water supply systems among other developments to the island for the first time\".\nThe DLP was re-elected to government in a landslide on 7 January 1966, carrying ten of the eleven constituencies. The government quickly began to face issues, with internal dissension and the formation of the nascent Dominica Freedom Party (DFP) in 1968. In his role as a cabinet minister, Ducreay would sometimes step in for LeBlanc in foreign commitments, including representing Dominica at the 1968 establishment of the Caribbean Free Trade Association, a precursor to CARICOM.\nAhead of the 26 October 1970 general election, Ducreay and two other ministers, W. S. Stevens and Mabel Moir James, formed a new bloc to remove LeBlanc from the DLP on the basis that he was an autocrat. In response, LeBlanc established the LeBlanc Labour Party and beat all of his opponents in the election, with the exception of Stevens. Having lost the election, Ducreay left politics to return to his business. He later spoke favourably about the formation of the United Workers' Party in 1988. After the 2000 general election, a new generation of politicians sought out Ducreay's advice and he became an active supporter of the DLP again, as well as a radio commentator and platform speaker.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nDucreay built his own house in lower Goodwill. He died on 1 July 2017 at his home in Roseau, at the age of 87. Prior to his death, he had suffered from kidney complications and hypertension.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Hannah Wanjie Ryder is a Kenyan citizen known for her work on trade between China and Africa. As of 2024 she is the chief executive officer of the consulting firm Development Reimagined.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nRyder was born in Kenya and her family moved to the United Kingdom when she was ten years old. She studied economics first at Oaklands College and then the University of Sussex, and then earned an M.Sc. in economics. After graduation she started work at the Department for International Development and she worked on relationships between the United Kingdom and developing counties. From 2014 until 2016 she worked as the lead of the Policy and Partnerships at the United Nations Development Programme. During this time she worked on China's policies regarding funding for international aid. \nAfter working at the United Nations, she founded Development Reimagined, an international development consultancy in 2017 specializing in Africa-China relationship. The company's headquarters are in Beijing, as of 2024 Ryder is the chief executive officer. \n\n\n== Work ==\nRyder's early work was on the connections between climate and economics. She was one of the co-authors of the Stern Review, a 2006 report on the economic impacts of climate change.\nRyder is primarily known for her work on international relations between China and Africa. She has advocated for developing countries to ask for more when negotiating with China, and in 2019 Ryder was at a meeting centered on discussions of the Belt and Road Initiative, China's infrastructure plan. Ryder's writings were used to set the stage for a 2017 conference on China-Africa relations, and in 2018 she discussed the impact of debt to China on African countries. \nAt the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic Ryder spoke about African students potentially exposed to the virus in China, on the impact of COVID-19 on trade between China and Africa, and how blame for imported COVID cases maybe been attributed to migrants in China. Ryder participated in the 2020 Forum on China–Africa Cooperation, a collaboration aimed at improving relations between China and Africa. \nUpon the 2023 nomination of Ajay Banga to the World Bank, Ryder noted he should consider the example of the African Development Bank in terms of how the World Bank could function. She also spoke on Bloomberg News about the needs of Africa in regards to climate change.\n\n\n== Honors and awards ==\nIn 2012 The Guardian recognized her with their Observer Ethical Award for her writing on economics, poverty, and climate change. In 2016 Ryder was nominated as a rising star by the New African Woman Forum.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "In the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup, the performance of the Australia women's national soccer team (nicknamed \"the Matildas\") captivated nationwide attention and had a significant ongoing impact on the perception of women's sport in Australia. Some media outlets used the terms Matildas fever to describe the community spirit on display, and Matildas effect to express the team's impact.\nThroughout the tournament, more kits representing the Australian women's team were sold than for the national men's team (\"the Socceroos\"), for the first time. Every match featuring Australia sold out before the World Cup began. Australian TV viewership records were broken several times, with live viewing sites set up in major stadiums to cope with crowds growing each game. The Australia vs. England semi-final became the most-watched broadcast in Australian history, with 11.15 million watching on the Seven Network. It was the furthest an Australian soccer team had advanced in a World Cup. Both the Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, and other state leaders pushed for a public holiday if the Matildas won the tournament.\nAs a direct result of the Matildas' success, the Australian government pledged $200 million to improve women's sporting facilities. In the 2024 winter soccer season, clubs around the country reported a record number of registrations for female players, with a 34 percent increase compared to the year prior. This influx of new members overwhelmed many regional soccer clubs.\nThe Australian National University named Matilda the Word of the Year of 2023. A mural of the team was painted at Bondi Beach, and a statue outside of Suncorp Stadium was announced. As of March 2024, every professional game the Matildas have participated in following the World Cup has sold out.\n\n\n== Viewership ==\nAustralian TV broadcast viewership records were broken multiple times. The Australia vs. Denmark match on 7 August was watched by 3.56 million on average, eclipsing the audience of the NRL State of Origin series and every NRL Grand Final since 2016. On 16 August, the Australia vs. France quarter-final drew about 4.17 million viewers on the Seven Network, becoming the biggest broadcast of 2023 at the time. Four days later, the Australia vs. England semi-final became the most-watched broadcast in country's history, averaging 7.13 million viewers, with a total of 11.15 million watching at one point. That number did not take into account the crowds at pubs and viewing sites around the country watching, with three stadiums in Sydney screening the match to the public, in a first for the city.\nThe Seven Network delayed the start of their flagship 7 pm news bulletin to allow for the full quarter-final match to be shown live, in a rare move for the broadcaster. Further, the AFL delayed the opening bounce of the Carlton vs. Melbourne game that night. Stadiums in use that day including the MCG, SCG and Optus Stadium all showed the Matildas' match on their screens before and after the games of their respective fixtures.\n\n\n== Social impact ==\n\nCEO of Football Australia, James Johnson, said the Matildas' run was \"really bringing Australia [communities] together\". Several New South Wales public schools held \"green and gold mufti-days\" on the day of the semi-final match.\nMany writers said that Australia's 7–6 penalty shootout win against France in the quarter-final round was an iconic cultural moment comparable to Cathy Freeman's 400 meter sprint win in the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Referring to the game, Samantha Lewis for ABC News wrote: \"Years from now, when someone asks you to tell the story of the night the Matildas made World Cup history, what will you say? The France game. Maybe that will be all you'll need to say.\"\nAccording to research company Honeycomb Strategy, 69 percent of Australians said they were more likely to follow other women's sporting events following the Women's World Cup.\n\nWe are not so much watching a national team compete, as a changing nation at play... [The Matildas have] overturned misconceptions of women’s sport and more importantly, the place of women in contemporary Australia.\n\n\n== Economic impact ==\nDouble the amount of jerseys for the Matildas were sold during the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup compared to Socceroos jerseys in the Qatar World Cup the year prior. The Courier-Mail said the Matildas were responsible for a $50 million economic boom for Brisbane. British media company SportsPro said the Matildas' media value had built to $2.78 billion through the tournament.\nBoth the Prime Minister of Australia, Anthony Albanese, and other state leaders pushed for a public holiday if the Matildas won the tournament. Opposition leader Peter Dutton said this stance was a publicity stunt, and would have a dire economic impact.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Murder In Mahim is a 2024  Hindi-language crime drama TV series on JioCinema written by Mustafa Neemuchwala and Udai Singh Pawar and directed by Raj Acharya. It stars Vijay Raaz, Ashutosh Rana, Shivani Raghuvanshi and Shivaji Satam. It was released on 10 May 2024.\n\n\n== Plot summary ==\nPolice officer Shivajirao Jende and his friend, retired journalist Peter Fernandes, dive into a murder case in Mumbai's darker side. In a gripping story based on Jerry Pinto's highly praised book, they discover hidden truths about longing, avarice, hopelessness, and also face the ghosts of their estranged friendship.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nVijay Raaz as Shivajirao Jende\nAshutosh Rana as Peter Fernandes\nShivani Raghuvanshi as Firdaus Rabbani\nShivaji Satam as Dullar Jende (Shivajirao's father)\nDivya Jagdale as Millie\nSmita Tambe\nRajesh Khattar as Leslie\nSonal Jha as Shaheen\nBenafsha Soonawalla as Rehana\nRohan Verma as Sunil\nAshitosh Gaikwad as Unit\nNishant Kkhanduja as Viral\n\n\n== Release ==\nMurder in Mahim was released on JioCinema on 10 May 2024.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nShubhra Gupta of The Indian Express rated the film 2.5 stars and wrote \"The eight-part series focuses on regular people (and their families) to be found in modest dwellings and crowded police thanas, through a sharp look at the LGBTQi community\".\nRahul Desai of Film Companion wrote \"Murder in Mahim is not unwatchable, but it fumbles the fundamentals of its genre. It mistakes slow-burning for slow. If it were an Indian batsman, it would be criticized for its strike rate – in Test cricket no less.\"\nAbhishek Srivastava from The Times of India rated 3.5 stars stating \"Beyond its suspenseful plot, 'Murder in Mahim' offers a commentary on the challenges faced by the LGBTQ community.\"\nDeepa Gahlot from Rediff.com stated \"Among the many reasons to watch Murder In Mahim is that it may be a chance to wipe out -- if it is achievable by a Web series -- the air of judgment towards those who do not conform to the majority's idea of normal.\"\nShilajit Mitra or The Hindu said in his review that \"This (mostly) faithful adaptation of Jerry Pinto's novel lacks the subtlety and craft of a really great crime show.\"\nNandini Ramnath of Scroll.in stated in her review that \"Murder in Mahim can never escape the suspicion that it would have been more effective as a movie. Overloaded with family bonding scenes and slippery on the procedural aspect, the show steadies itself through its unwavering focus on the murderous consequences of homophobia.\"\nTroy Ribeiro of The Free Press Journal said that \"The series challenges societal norms and provokes conversations about acceptance, justice, and the complexities of human nature.\"\nRishil Jogani from Pinkvilla rated 3.5 out of 5 and stated that \"Murder In Mahim is more than just an investigation drama. It is layered and manages to ask some very tough questions. It also makes you self-introspect.\"\nSoumyabrata Gupta of Times Now wrote \"Raj Acharya directs Murder In Mahim, spotlighting the riveting portrayals of Ashutosh Rana and Vijay Raaz. The film delves into the chilling murders at Mahim railway station, exploring the perilous trend of honey-trapping within the LGBTQIA+ community. It blends elements of investigation and drama to illuminate this disturbing phenomenon.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMurder In Mahim at IMDb",

        "content": "A Beautiful Friendship: Remembering Shirley Horn is an EP by Mark Murphy.\nA Beautiful Friendship: Remembering Shirley Horn is the 47th recording (EP) by American jazz vocalist Mark Murphy. It was recorded when Murphy was 80 years old in 2012 and released by the Gearbox label in the United States and the UK in 2013. This album is collection of standards associated with Shirley Horn. The recording is dedicated to Shirley Horn and pianist George Mesterhazy, Murphy's accompanist. This was Mark Murphy's final recording.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn the liner notes Christopher Loudon attributes the initial idea of a Shirley Horn tribute album to George Mesterhazy. Pianist and arranger Mesterhazy had worked with vocalists Rebecca Parris (Spring, My Foolish Heart), Paula West (Live at the Jazz Standard), Shirley Horn (May the Music Never End, Loving You) and Murphy. Speaking about Horn Murphy said, \"I never knew her well but our paths would cross at festivals and clubs and it was always a pleasure to see and hear her. We liked each other, and I know she liked what I did. She even said to me once after a show, 'I thought I was good, and then I heard you.' Which is crazy, as I would never think that. It was her way of winking at me, the way like-minded artists communicate with each other, a way to let the other know one was a secret fan\".\nMeterhazy unexpectedly died before the recording began. Murphy and his manager Jean-Pierre Leduc were determined to record the project, now envisioned to be a tribute to Mesterhazy as well as Horn. The recording took place at the Merion Inn, Cape May, New Jersey, Mesterhazy's hometown. Mesterhazy had performed regularly at the inn which was owned by his long time companion Vicki Watson.\nThe chosen songs were all associated with Horn. Horn recorded Jimmy Van Heusen's \"But Beautiful\", from the film Road to Rio, Cole Porter's \"Get Out of Town\", from the musical Leave It to Me!, and \"A Beautiful Friendship\" on her album Close Enough for Love (Verve, 1988). Horn's recording of \"Here's to Life\" from Here's to Life (Verve, 1991) became her signature tune. She was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Jazz Vocal Performance for \"Here's to Life\" at the 35th Annual Grammy Awards but lost to Bobby McFerrin for \"Round Midnight\" in the album Play. Her album reached number one on the Billboard jazz chart.\n\n\n== Recording ==\nThe album was produced by Jean-Pierre Leduc, Murphy's manager, and Darrel Sheinman, from Gearbox Records. The recording took place near the time of the Cape May Exit Zero Jazz Festival during which Steve Williams, Shirley Horn's drummer of 25 years, and bassist Curtis Lundy were available. Murphy had also just performed at the festival. Curtis Lundy was Betty Carter's longtime bassist and a close friend of Horn. To replace Mesterhazy, Leduc hired pianist Alex Minasian. Till Brönner, who worked with Murphy on Once to Every Heart and Love Is What Stays accompanies on trumpet on two tunes, \"But Beautiful\" and \"Get Out of Town\". Murphy performs \"Here's to Life\" as a duet with pianist Alex Minasian.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nBruce Lindsay, writing for All About Jazz, calls the recording a \"superb tribute\" and finds \"Here's to Life\" to be \"extraordinarily affecting\".\nJeanie Barton gives the release a positive review in The London Jazz News writing, \"This EP is a warming tribute to two influential musicians with personal contributions from all involved...this record perfectly honors their Beautiful Friendship\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"A Beautiful Friendship\" (Donald Kahn, Stanley Styne) – 5:22\n\"But Beautiful\" (Jimmy Van Heusen, Johnny Burke) – 5:20\n\"Get Out of Town\" (Cole Porter) – 4:32\n\"Here’s to Life\" (Artie Butler, Phyllis Molinary) – 4:12\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nPerformance\nMark Murphy – vocals\nAlex Minasian – piano\nCurtis Lundy – bass (tracks 1, 2, 3)\nSteve Williams – drums (tracks 1, 2, 3)\nTill Brönner – trumpet (tracks 2 and 3)\n\nProduction\nBob Fowler – engineer\nStephan Branca– assistant engineer\nGeorge Mesterhazy – concept\nJean-Pierre Leduc – producer, cover photography\nDarrel Sheinman– producer\nAlan Foulkes – album design\nChristopher Loudon – liner notes\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nA Beautiful Friendship: Remembering Shirley Horn at MusicBrainz (release group)\nA Beautiful Friendship: Remembering Shirley Horn at Discogs (master release)\nA Beautiful Friendship: Remembering Shirley Horn at AllMusic (release)\nMark Murphy in The Penguin Guide to Jazz at Internet Archive\nMark Murphy in The Rolling Stone Jazz & Blues Album Guide at Internet Archive",

        "content": "Geoffrey de Marisco (died 1245) was the justiciar of Ireland.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMarisco is said to have been the nephew and heir of Hervey de Mount-Maurice, and nephew of Herlewin, bishop of Leighlin (d. 1217?) (Genealogical Memoir of Montmorency, Pedigree, d. ix ; Gilbert, Viceroys of Ireland, p. 78]), but these assertions seem to lack proof. He is also said to have been the brother of Richard de Marisco, bishop of Durham and chancellor (Gilbert, ut supra), which, though possible (see Sweetman, Documents, No. 745), appears to be a mere assumption (see Foss, Judges of England, ii. 400; Surtees, History of Durham, vol. i. p. xxviii). The arms used by the bishop (see Notes and Queries, 3rd ser. i. 91) are different from those carried by Marisco (see Matt. Paris, Chronica Majora, vi. 475). Another theory makes him the son of a Jordan de Marisco, described as lord of Huntspill-Mareys, Somerset, and other lands, which Marisco is supposed to have in- herited (Genealogical Memoir, ut supra, p. vi ; Collinson, History of Somerset, ii. 392), but save that Marisco had a brother named Jordan {Documents, No. 2119), and is represented as having a son of that name (Genealogical Memoir, ut supra, p. x), this also seems to be unsupported by evidence, for it is impossible to assume, with the pedigree-makers, that the Marisco FitzJordan mentioned in a charter of Quarr Abbey in the Isle of Wight (Monasticon, v. 317) is the justiciar ; and though Marisco is said to have possessed large estates in England (Gilbert, ut supra, p. 78), it is certain that he had no land in this country in 1238 (Documents, No. 2445). . His name, which, translated, is simply Marsh, was as common in England in the Middle Ages as the marshes from which it was derived (Monumenta Franciscana, vol. i. Pref. p. lxxvii), and the compilers of the pedigrees of the family of Mountmorres, or Montmorency, have caused much confusion by importing into their schemes the names of all persons of any note who were known by that common appellation, or by one at all like it [see under Mount-Maurice, Hervey de]. Nothing seems certain about Marisco's parentage further than that he was a nephew of John Comyn (d. 1212), archbishop of Dublin (Documents, No. 276), a fact which may account for his rise to wealth and power in Ireland ; and that his mother was alive in 1220 (Royal Letters, Henry III, i. 128).\nMarisco was powerful in the south of Munster and Leinster, and appears to have received large grants of land in Ireland from King John. He was with the king at Ledbury, Gloucestershire, in 1200 (Documents, No. 137), and received a grant of 'Katherain' in exchange for other lands in Ireland, together with twenty marks, to fortify a house there for himself (ib. No. 139). When war broke out among the English in Leinster, the lords and others who were discontented with the government of the justiciar Hugh de Lacy seem to have looked on Marisco as their leader. He was joined by a number of the natives, seized Limerick (Annals of Worcester, p. 396), and inflicted a severe defeat on the justiciar at Thurles in Munster (Annals of the Four Masters, iii. 15, 171 ; Annals ap. Chartularies of St. Mary's Abbey, ii. 311). For this he obtained the king's pardon (Gilbert, ut supra, p. 66), and in 1210 made successful war against the Irish of Connaught (Annals of Loch CS, i. 239, 245). When Innocent III was threatening, in or about 1211, to absolve John's subjects from their allegiance, he joined the other magnates of Ireland in making a protestation of loyalty (Documents, No. 448). In the summer of 1215 he was with the king at Marlborough, and on 6 July was appointed justiciar of Ireland, giving two of his sons as pledges for his behaviour (ib. Nos. 604, 608). On the accession of Henry III he advised that Queen Isabella, or her second son, Richard, should reside in Ireland (Gilbert, ut supra, p. 80). He built a castle at Killaloe, co. Clare, in 1217, and forced the people to accept an English bishop, Robert Travers, apparently one of his own relatives (Annals of the Four Masters, iii. 90; Documents, Nos. 1026, 2119). In 1218 he was ordered to raise money to enable the king to pay Louis, the son of the French king, the sum promised to him, and to pay the papal tribute. He was ordered in 1219 to pay the revenues of the crown into the exchequer at Dublin, and to present himself before the king, leaving Ireland in the care of Henry of London, archbishop of Dublin. Having already taken the cross he received a safe-conduct to make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land (Calendar of Patent Rolls, 3 Hen. Ill, n. 12), and went to England. There in March 1220 he entered into an agreement with the king at Oxford, in the presence of the council, with reference to the discharge of his office, pledging himself to pay the royal revenues into the exchequer, and to appoint faithful constables for the king's castles, and delivering one of his sons to be kept as a hostage by the king (Fœdera, i. 162). On his return to Ireland he was commanded to resume the demesne lands that he had alienated without warrant (Documents, No. 949). Complaints were made against him to the king by the citizens of Dublin, and in July 1221 the king wrote to the council in Ireland, declaring that he had received no money from that country since he came to the throne, and that Marisco, who had while in England made a fine with him to satisfy defaults, had not obeyed his wishes. Henry therefore desired that he should give up his office (ib. No. 1001). Marisco resigned the justiciarship on 4 October, was thanked for his faithful services, quit-claimed of 1,080 marks, part of the fine made with the king, and received a letter of protection during the king's minority, and the wardship of the heir of John de Clahull (ib. Nos. 1015 sqq.)\nDuring the absence of the justiciar, William, the earl-marshal, in 1224, Marisco had charge of the country, and carried on war with Aedh O'Neill. He was reappointed justiciar on 25 June 1226, and, being then in England, received on 4 July a grant of 580l. a year, to be paid out of the Irish exchequer as salary (ib. Nos. 1383, 1413; Fœdera, i. 182). This seems to be the first time that a salary was appointed for the viceroy of Ireland. On his return to Ireland he wrote to the king informing him that Theobald FitzWalter, who had married Marisco's daughter, was refractory, and had garrisoned Dublin Castle against the king. He advised that Theobald should be deprived of the castle of Roscray, and promised that he would use every effort to punish the king's enemies (Royal Letters, i. 290 sqq.) He endeavoured to detain the person of Hugh, or Cathal, O'Conor, king of Connaught; but Hugh was delivered by the intervention of William, the earl-marshal. In revenge, his son Aedh surprised William, the justiciar's son, near Athlone, and made him prisoner; nor could his father obtain his release, except on terms that were highly advantageous to the Connaught people (Annals of the Four Masters, iii. 245). Marisco built the castle of Ballyleague, in the barony of South Ballintober, co. Roscommon, about this time. While Hugh O'Conor was at the justiciar's house, one of Marisco's men slew him, on account of a private quarrel, and Marisco hanged the murderer (ib. p. 247). He resigned the justiciarship at his own wish in February 1228 (Documents, No. 1572). He was reappointed justiciar in 1230, and in July inflicted, with the help of Walter de Lacy and Richard de Burgh, a severe defeat on the Connaught men, under their king, Aedh, who was taken prisoner (Wendover, iv. 213). He resigned the justiciarship in 1232 (Royal Letters, i. 407).\nIn common with Maurice FitzGerald, then justiciar, and other lords, Marisco in 1234 received a letter written by the king's evil counsellors, and sealed by him, directing that should Richard, the earl-marshal, come to Ireland he should be taken alive or dead. Marisco accordingly joined the magnates of Ireland in their conspiracy against the marshal, who went to Ireland on hearing that his lands there had been ravaged. As soon as he landed Marisco joined him, and treacherously urged him to march against his enemies, promising him his aid. Acting by his advice, the earl, at a conference with the magnates at the Curragh, Kildare, refused to grant them the truce that they demanded. When they set the battle against him Marisco deserted the earl, who was wounded, taken prisoner, and soon afterwards died (Paris, iii. 273–9). Marisco fell into temporary disgrace with the king for his share in the business, but on 3 August 1235 Henry restored him his lands (Documents, No. 2280). In this year his son William, it is said, slew, at London, a clerk named Henry Clement, a messenger from one of the Irish magnates, and was consequently outlawed (ib. No. 2386). A man who was accused of an intent to assassinate the king at Woodstock in 1238 was said to have been instigated by William de Marisco; his father, Marisco, was suspected of being privy to the scheme, and his lands in Ireland being distrained upon, he fled to Scotland, where he was, with the connivance of Alexander II, sheltered by Walter Comyn, no doubt his kinsman. Henry was indignant with the king of Scots for harbouring him, and made it a special ground of complaint. After the treaty of July 1244 Alexander sent Marisco out of his dominions. He fled to France, where he died friendless and poor in 1245, at an advanced age, for he is described as old in 1234.\nMeanwhile, his son had taken refuge on Lundy Island, which he fortified. There he was joined by a number of broken men, and adopted piracy as a means of sustaining life, specially plundering ships laden with wine and provisions. Strict watch was kept, in the hope of taking him, and in 1242 he was taken by craft, carried to London, and there drawn, handed, and quartered, sixteen of his companions being also hanged. In his dying confession he protested his innocence of the death of Clement, and of the attempt on the king's life (Paris, iv. 196). He had married Matilda, niece of Henry, archbishop of Dublin, who gave her land on her marriage (Documents, Nos. 2528, 2853). William had also received a grant of land from the king for his support in 1228 (ib. No. 1640). Marisco appears to have been vigorous and able, a successful commander, and on the whole a just and skilful ruler. Like most of the great men of Ireland at the time, he did not scruple to act treacherously. To the king, however, he seems to have been a faithful servant. The accusation of treason brought against him and his son William is extremely improbable, and their ruin must be considered as a result, of the indignation excited by the fate of the earl-marshal. Marisco founded an Augustinian monastery at Killagh, co. Kerry, called Beaulieu (Monasticon Hibernicum, p. 304), and commanderies of knights hospitallers at Any and Adair, co. Limerick. An engraving of a tomb in the church of Any, which is said to be Marisco's, is in the 'Genealogical Memoir of Montmorency.'\nMarisco married Eva de Bermingham (Documents, Nos. 817, 1112), and apparently, for his second wife, a sister of Hugh de Lacy (Wendover, iv. 304; Paris, iii. 277), named Matilda (Documents, No. 2853). Marisco told Richard, the earl-marshal, that his wife was Hugh de Lacy's sister, but the genealogists assert that his second wife was Christiania, daughter of Walter de Riddlesford, baron of Bray, and sister of Hugh de Lacy's wife, Emmeline (Genealogical Memoir, Pedigree, p. ix). This is an error, for Christiania de Riddlesford married Marisco's son Robert (d. 1243), by whom she was the mother of Christiania de Marisco, an heiress of great wealth (Documents, No. 2645 and other numbers; comp. also Calendarium Genealogicum, i. 171). Of Marisco's many sons, William, Robert, Walter, Thomas, Henry, John, and Richard appear in various public records (see Documents passim). He is also said to have had an eldest son Marisco, who settled in Tipperary and died without issue; William was reckoned as his second son; a third and eldest surviving son, named Jordan, married the daughter of the lord of Lateragh, and continued his line; his youngest son was named Stephen (Genealogical Memoir, Pedigree, pp. x, xi, App. p. xl); a daughter is assigned to him named Emmeline, who is said to have married Maurice FitzGerald, 'earl of Desmond' (ib. and App. p. clxvii). The first Earl of Desmond, however, lived much later [see under FitzThomas, Maurice, d. 1356], and the genealogist seems to take for a daughter of Geoffrey de Marisco, Emmeline, daughter and heiress of Emmeline de Riddlesford, wife of Hugh de Lacy, and Stephen Longespee, who married Maurice FitzMaurice (see under FitzGerard, Maurice FitzMaurice, 1238?–1277; Kildare, Earls of Kildare, p. 17). Marisco had a daughter who married Theobald Fitz Walter. The assertion (Genealogical Memoir, Pedigree, p. x) that his son John was viceroy of Ireland in 1206 is erroneous. The father of the viceroy was Geoffrey FitzPeter. Geoffrey the justiciar had nephews named Richard, John Travers, and William FitzJordan (Documents, No. 2119).\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Hunt, William (1893). \"Marisco, Geoffrey de\".

        "content": "The Donsin Solar Power Station is a 25 megawatts solar power plant under development in Burkina Faso. The power station is owned and is being developed by the Government of Burkina Faso, through the Ministry of Energy, Mines and Quarries. The off-taker of the power generated here is Société Nationale d'électricité du Burkina Faso (SONABEL), the Burkinabe national electricity utility company. The project received funding support, in the form of a €45.7 million concessional loan from the Export-Import Bank of China.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe power station would occupy a piece of real estate on the premises of Donsin International Airport, in Loumbila, Oubritenga Province, in the Plateau-Central Region. This is approximately 38 kilometres (24 mi) northeast of Ouagadougou, the country's capital city.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe power station's generation capacity is 25 megawatts. Its output is to be sold directly to SONABEL for integration into the national electricity grid. The design calls for an attached 5 MW/20 MWh battery storage power station (BESS).\n\n\n== Funding and timeline ==\nThe Import-Export Bank of China agreed to make a €45.7 million (US$49.2 million or 30 billion CFA francs) soft loan available to the Burkinabe government for the purpose of building this renewable energy infrastructure project. Construction is expected to commence later in 2024 and conclude 15 months later.\n\n\n== Other considerations ==\nAs of April 2024 the Burkina Faso national electricity generation capacity was reported as 714.4 MW. Another 200 MW to 300 MW extra is imported, from Ivory Coast and Ghana, to meet national demand. This power station will enable the country reduce the electricity import bill.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of power stations in Burkina Faso\nPâ Solar Power Station\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nChina Commits $49 Million for Burkina Faso's Donsin Airport Solar Power Plant",

        "content": "Stanisław Basaj, pseudonym \"Ryś\" or \"Kraśka\" (24 November 1917 – 25 or 27 March 1945) , was a Polish soldier and later a partisan of the Peasant Battalions. According to Polish nationalists and patriots Stanisław Basaj is considered a National hero, while According to Ukrainian nationalists he is considered a war criminal. In 1944 during the Hrubieszów revolution he organized massacres against the Ukrainian population in Łasków and Szychowice. \n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Prior to the war ===\nBorn on the 24th of November 1917 in Polany to a family of peasants.  In 1924 the Basaj family moved to Małków in the Hrubieszów district. Stanisław Basaj attended the four-grade primary school in Małków and then the seven-grade school in Kryłów. As a student of the school in Małków, he joined the scouting movement. As a 16-year-old boy, Stanisław Basaj volunteered for the army. He served in the orchestra of the 23rd Infantry Regiment in Włodzimierz Wołyński. In 1937, due to his father's illness, he gave up his military service, which he had begun as a volunteer. He was an activist with the Union of Rural Youth \"Wici\". At the end of 1938, he married Genowefa Kołtoniuk, with whom he had two daughters.\nAs a corporal in the 2nd Regiment of Mounted Riflemen from Hrubieszów, he took part in the 1939 Campaign, in which he distinguished himself by his bravery in the Battle of Mokra and participated in the daring night attack on Kamieńsk. When it ended, he commanded a small unit of post-September partisans, which fought several skirmishes with Wehrmacht patrols between November 1939 and January 1940. In January 1940, he joined the Union of Armed Struggle (ZWZ) and became an active organiser of the underground in the southern part of the Hrubieszów district.\n\n\n=== Zamość Uprising and the fight against the Ukrainians and the Germans ===\nIn the spring of 1942, a partisan unit of the Peasant Battalions was formed in the village of Małków, whose organiser and commander (at the request of Stanisław Hulak \"Stępień\" a member of the Powiat People's Movement Management), was appointed Stanisław Basaj. This important event for him coincided with the birth of Kamilka, daughter of Stanisław and Genowefa. Later, Kamila and her mother had to go into hiding to avoid falling victim to the Gestapo or Ukrainian nationalists. They swore revenge on \"Rysi\" and aimed to strike at the corporal's weakest point - his family. This was, at first, the so-called \"OS\" Special Branch in Polish\nIn the second half of 1942, there were four major clashes from which the \"Ryś\" battalion emerged victorious (at Kryłów, Mircz, Poturzyn and Kosmów ). Moreover, liquidated an officer of the Ukrainian Police in Hrubieszów named Malesza, together with several other policemen. The Germans had already at that time set for the capture or killing of Basaj tens of thousands of złoty as a reward.\nFrom November 1942, the implementation of the next phase of the General Plan East, approved by Heinrich Himmler on 12 June 1942, began in the Zamojskie region; following this, Himmler issued another decree (12 November 1942), which was a formal act recognising Zamojskie as the first settlement area (Siedlungsstutzpunkte) in the General Government (GG); there were to be 14 of them in the GG. On 28 November 1942, a great displacement action began, the brutality and bestiality of which were unprecedented in the history of Europe; villages were surrounded at night, the entire population was herded to a selected square, often murdering the infirm and resistant; the population was also segregated; Children were separated and sent to resettlement or concentration camps in the interior of the country or to concentration camps, while \"racially pure\" children were sent to be germanised; as the action took place in late autumn and winter, trains full of frozen corpses of children circulated in the country.\nThe Poles immediately reacted to this rape, and the fighting went down in history as the Zamość Uprising, Stanislaw Basaj played a large part in the fight, his unit turned into a monster that was one of the largest units in the Hrubieszów region. On January 15, 1943, he fought a battle against the German gendarmerie and Ukrainian police in Tuchany near Dubienka, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy.But Ryś was not content with such achievements, as on January 20, near Józefów, with only a hundred-strong unit under his command, he easily confronted the enemy forces, inflicting a defeat on them. in February he made a successful operation against the Ukrainian police, in the same month an operation was carried out in which the entire livestock was recaptured from the Ukrainians and heavy losses were inflicted on the Cossacks at Małków The following month, 2 battles were fought against the Bandera at Modryń and Mircz, smashing the Ukrainian nationalist forces there. on 12 february the same year Stanislaw basaj successfully carried out an attack on wereszyne during a wedding where 3 ukrainian policemen were killed and some weapons were captured.\nOn 15 and 17 March, he liquidated Ukrainian posts in Modryń and Łasków. On March 18, the \"Ryś\" battalion carried out an operation against a detachment of Ukrainian nationalists in the village of Górki and, in pursuit of them, smashed a German car column, also destroying two cannons. On 20 March, he saved the Polish population in the village of Modryń from being murdered by driving out an Ukrainian Insurgent Army unit. On 3 April, attacking Prehoryłe, he smashed an Ukrainian Insurgent Army unit and took revenge for the murder of the Polish population. On 15 August, 3 platoons from the \"Ryś\" battalion, near the village of Mieniany, fought a victorious battle with Ukrainian police and units of the collaborationist Ukrainian 14th SS Grenadier Division. On 15 September, 3 platoons from the \"Ryś\" battalion struck a post in Sahryń, but without success; this is one of the few battalion's lost battles. On 22 October, 4 platoons from the Basaj battalion smashed a detachment of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army and German gendarmerie, saving the pacified Polish village of Górka. On 8 October 1943, Stanisław Basaj's \"Ryś\" BCh partisans, during their first joint combat action with Stefan Kwaśniewski's \"Wiktor\" Home Army unit, were to smash an Ukrainian police station in Mieniany. According to Sub-District IV B, eight Ukrainians were killed then, one partisan was killed and the building of the post was burnt down. However, according to Kwaśniewski's memoirs, the Ukrainian policemen at the sound of the first (accidental) gunshots left the police station and fled.\non 24 December of the same year two platoons of the BCh Stanisław Basaj \"Ryś\" unit came to the aid of the Polish population once again attacked by the UPA (Ukrainian Insurgent Army) militia in Kol. Modryń. As a result of the skirmish, 14 Ukrainians and 7 Poles were killed. The poles captured 3 kb\". From the Ukrainian side, the village was attacked by a BCh unit under the command of Stanislaw Basaj \"Rys\". \"At 10 p.m., near the Orthodox church and parish buildings, in the direction of the road, the village and the milk factory, a massacre began.\nA skirmish with Ukrainians and Germans was recorded on 18 January 1944. In late autumn and winter the battalion stayed in quarters and prepared for further fighting; the period of calm was interrupted by the enemy. On 29 January 1944, units of the 14th SS Grenadier Division, in the strength of 2 companies, attacked the villages of Górka-Zabłocie and Małków, where Home army units and the \"Ryś\" battalion were quartered.The enemy attack was repulsed without losses. On the following day, 250 Basaj soldiers attacked a detachment of Ukrainian gendarmerie and police near Malkow, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy; in this way the enemy was prevented from pacifying Małków.  On 16/17 February, in a night battle, an UPA unit was smashed in the village of Prehoryłe. On 27 February, in the village of Górka, the subordinates of \"Ryś\" clashed with members of the Chełm UNS. According to the OUN, five Bechniks were killed that day. There were also wounded on the Polish side. BCh materials, on the other hand, confirm the death of three Ukrainian partisans. A document of the Hrubieszów district BCh shows that also on 27 February the Ukrainian SD (ULS, 5th SS police regiment) arrived \"in the liege\". On the same day still Basaj's battalion fought a victorious skirmish near Małkow with a unit of the SS Beyersdorf Combat Group, and with the Ukrainian National Self-Defence (USN). Rescuing the Polish population, he attacked a detachment of the 14th SS Grenadier Division, as well as police and gendarmerie units pacifying the Górna and Łasków colonies, claiming another victory; on that day, Basaj and \"Bold\", going to collect ammunition, fought a battle with a Ukrainian militia in the village of Małków; 2 militiamen were killed and some weapons were captured.\nThroughout the month, Ukrainian partisan units and police officers carried out attacks on Poles, with several people falling victim to each (villages of Medycze, Terebiniec, Pielaki, Turka). On 22 February, a group of Poles, whom Grzegorz Motyka considers criminals, killed six Ukrainians in Cichobórz and robbed two more. In response, the Ukrainians killed eight Poles two days later whom they suspected of having committed this crime. The course of events in Małków on 3, 8 or 13 February was unclear. According to Polish studies, the \"Ryś\" unit prevented a unit of the 14th SS Grenadier Division from pacifying this village; according to Ukrainian studies, it committed a crime against 14 civilian Ukrainians. Grzegorz Motyka claims that both theses may be true. However Polish attacks on detachments of the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police continued. On 28 February, AK units, after a fierce battle with Ukrainian self-defence, burnt down the villages of Liski and Kościaszyn. The losses of both sides are unknown.\n\nOn 14 February, one of the biggest battles ever was fought with the Germans and Ukrainians at Zablocie, due to the breaking blow of the \"Cossack\", the Nimets were shocked for a while with the Ukrainians, but only the left part was broken through, and the direction to Mircze was open for the Germans, another conclusion is that the \"Hardy\" manoeuvre group from the Home Army did not manage to close the road for the Germans in the direction of retreat (to Szczur), to Laskowsky forest. The Germans started to retreat, but the usual retreat turned into a mass panic the only thing that saved the German forces were the unknown forces that were in the south, after the victorious battle it turned out that it was not the Germans who attacked the barrage group, but a platoon of the \"Hardy\" platoon (Mieczyslaw Olszak). It joined the barrage group in the Wólczański forest 28 February 1944, the \"Ryś\" battalion and the \"Czarusia\" AK unit from the Hrubieszów district fought a battle with the German units in defence of the pacified village of Małków, during the battle further 3 AK platoons joined in. After pushing the Germans out of Małków, their forces were taken in ticks from 3 sides, the German expedition ended in defeat, many enemy soldiers and their commander were killed, the Poles captured a large amount of weapons and ammunition; the partisans lost 6 soldiers and 16 were wounded; the next day 3 platoons of \"Rys\" battalion and an AK platoon (commanded by \"Huragan\") under the personal command of \"Ryś\" smashed an outpost of Ukrainian nationalists in the village of Prehoryłe; several dozen Ukrainians were killed, the village was burnt down; during this action the UPA sotnia \"Bradiagi\" was smashed. On March 5, 4 platoons from the \"Ryś\" battalion (116. soldiers under the command of \"Ryś\" and an AK platoon from the \"Czarusia\" company of 35 soldiers) were attacked in the area of Prehoryłe - Małków by strong units of the 14th SS Grenadier Division and Ortschutz; the attack was repulsed with small losses, equipment was captured.\nIn the summer of 1943, the Germans practically ceased their displacement actions in the Zamojszczyzna region, as they no longer had the strength to continue implementing the General Plan East, and pacifications and anti-partisan operations were carried out more with a view to ensuring security at the frontline; from the early spring of 1944, the Zamojszczyzna region experienced a new tragedy; the nationalist Ukrainian movement (OUN, UPA), aided by the Germans, undertook concentrated and ruthless actions aimed at pushing back or liquidating the Polish element from the south-eastern districts ofin Zamość (Hrubieszowski, Tomaszowski, Biłgorajski); at the end of February 1944, the Ukrainian Insurgent Army's command decided to move its operations to lands lying to the west of the Bug and San rivers. A group of Ukrainian Insurgent Army under the command of Myroslav Onyszkewycz crossed the Bug River and massacred the Polish villages of Tarnoszyn, Posady and Podlody in the Tomaszów County, as well as the villages of Ostrów and Chlewiska near Bełżec, in the forest between Dachny and Monastyre Ukrainians murdered a Polish partisan group, including Soviet paratroopers and a unit of the Home Army \"Krakusy\"; at the same time, on the land Lubaczów In April they massacred Polish villages Budka and Chotylub, and the town of Cieszanów; in April and May new Ukrainian Insurgent Army units under the command of Col. Ostrózka, in the strength of a dozen or so thousand riflemen; they were aiming at taking over the regions of south-eastern Poland (within today's borders) and establishing a base of operations to fight the Poles; UPA's units were supported by German police, SS-Galizien units and other collaborator formationsIn connection with this, the UPA command categorically demanded that all Poles should leave parts of Chelm and Lublin regions by 6 April 1944, and in the first place the districts of Chelm, Zamojski, Hrubieszowski and Tomaszowski; in these areas, with the consent of the Germans, Ukrainian was introduced as the official language, in addition to German and Polish\nThe Poles sent their best partisan units to fight, including the 1st BCh battalion \"Ryś\", which at the time numbered about 800 soldiers. On March 8, 1944 concentrated units of Ukrainian police and the 14th SS Grenadier Division, supported by the USN units from Szychowice, Kryłów and Gołębia attacked the Prehoryłe colony; 4 platoons of the 1st BCh battalion \"Ryś\" and OP AK J. Ochman (\"Kozak\") rushed to help the pacified population; after heavy fights Ukrainian nationalists were driven out of the colony, leaving numerous corpses of murdered Polish inhabitants; the next dayUkrainians attacked the Prehoryłe colony again, murdering the inhabitants and burning the village, the \"Ryś\" battalion rushed to help the inhabitants. The Ukrainian nationalists were driven out of the colony and retreated to Krylov and the surrounding area. The plan for the operation of 10 March 1944 was most likely created by Kwaśniewski. Describing in his memoirs the preparations for, among other things, the attack on Szychowice and referring to the orders given to the commanders of the subordinate units and subdivisions assigned to carry it out, he bluntly stated:\n\"The objective was clear. I called the large-scale moves undertaken the Tsarist cut. They were intended to lead, by their violence and brutality, to the blunting of the Ukrainian sting. None of the officers who were present [at the briefing in the Olszynka colony - M.Z.] made any amendments to the way I presented [the task]. Both technically, as well as formally, my point of view passed without a conclusion\".\nRyś, on the night of 9-10 March 1944, with an unguarded march, was to take the base for the assault on the village. About the course of the attack on Szychowice and the fate of the inhabitants, Kwaśniewski said that one attack was enough to easily break the Ukrainians. And so it happened. Within hours the resistance of the Ukrainians was broken. And also Kwasniewski wrote that not a single Ukrainian from the village escaped. The Ukrainian data mentioning numerous civilians killed by Poles in Szychowice and Łasków was confirmed by the chronicle of the \"Ryś\" battalion. Before attacking Sahryń, Polish troops surrounded the village and isolated it from neighbouring villages dominated by Ukrainians, making it impossible for them to warn Sahryń's inhabitants. Polish soldiers shelled the village with tracer bullets, setting fire to the buildings. The attackers were repulsed only by the station staff, and there were exchanges of fire near the church, in the cemetery and by the station building itself. The resistance of the policemen was broken rather quickly.  Ukrainian self-defence, on the other hand, quickly fled the battlefield.According to some Ukrainian accounts, the militiamen were outside the police station at the time of the attack. They may have been the ones defending themselves in the church and cemetery. Then a few of them retreated in the direction of Werbkowice.  The armed Ukrainians, if not killed in the fighting, were shot on the spot.  After entering the village, the Poles also killed civilian Ukrainian residents. Ukrainians they encountered were killed with gunshots, and grenades were also thrown into hiding places in farms. Usually the identity of civilians was checked to avoid killing Poles, but there were also cases of residents being fired upon without warning. The entire attack ended at around 2 p.m. According to data written down by a local priest, the attackers destroyed the Orthodox church, parish buildings and 280 houses. Zajączkowski writes that the village burned almost to the ground. And the perpetrators of this massacre were also Stanislaw Basaj.\nOn 15 March 1944 \"Ryś\", surprised near the village of Płoskie, smashed a German patrol. On 16-17 March, the \"Ryś\" unit fought against a pacification group consisting of gendarmes, SS men and Ukrainian police from the UPA \"Jahoda\" (in a force of about 600 men), which attacked the village of Łasków, the colonies of Zabłocie and Małków; the unit was assisted by AK units of M. Olszak \"Hardy\" and A. Aleksandrow \"Brawura\"; the Ukrainians were defeated; 30 SS men and UPA were killed in the fight, two cars were burnt and villages were saved. On 19 March, units of the 14th SS Grenadier Division, Ortyszutz, Ukrainian police, partly Schupo and gendarmes (about 800 men) launched a large-scale operation against a Basaj battalion and an AK battalion under the command of Zenon Jachymek \"Wiktor\". When they surrounded one of the Basaj platoons in the village of Łasków, the main forces of the Basaj battalion and the \"Wiktor\" battalion moved to the aid of the surrounded population, \"Ryś\" drove the enemy out and captured the Mircze-Kryłów road, at the same time, the \"Czarusia\" and \"Wiktor\" companies of the AK drove the enemy away from the Sokal-Hrubieszów road and captured Mircze. Having achieved these objectives, the Polish partisans captured the last Ukrainian resistance points in the villages of Modryń, Modryniec and Masłomęcz, in the third phase of operations, Ukrainian self-defence bases in the villages of Mieniany, Kozodawy, Cichobórz and Kosmów were attacked, completely driving out their crews, the Ukrainians sustaining significant losses.\nOn 21 March 1944, a team from the Basaj battalion, returning from Tyszowce in Tomaszów County, to which they were escorting evacuated Polish people, set up an ambush near the Marysin colony; a detachment of German gendarmerie was ambushed and, after a short battle, smashed. On 27 March, units of the SS Battle Group Beyersdorf and the Wehrmacht of the 154th Infantry Division (a total of about 2,000 men) attacked a BCh outpost in Smoligów; the BCh units of the \"Ryś\" battalion and part of the \"Hardy\" platoon (a total of approx. A bloody battle lasting many hours ensued, which ended in the defeat of the encircled units; 33 partisans were killed in the fight, and many were wounded. \"Rys\" activity worried the German command. As a consequence, a decision was made to carry out a large-scale counter-partisan operation in the southern part of the Hrubieszów district. The punitive expedition, commanded by Lt. Col. Werner Froemert, consisted of the Ukrainian Self-Defence Legion, sub-units of the 5th Galician SS Volunteer Regiment, a detachment of the German 154th Infantry Division, Ordnungspolizei officers and a battery of armoured guns. The operation began in the early morning of 27 March. The Germans and their Ukrainian collaborators surrounded the \"Ryś\" battalion, as well as an AK outpost commanded by Mieczysław Olszak, alias \"Hardy\". After a fierce battle, \"Ryś\" and part of his unit managed to break out of the encirclement, but the Polish partisans suffered heavy losses, Majewski writes that the Poles lost between 33 and 75 partisans killed, while the memoirs of the Peasant Battalion state that 27 Poles were killed.\nIn April 1944, the \"Ryś\" battalion regenerated its strength and prepared for new tasks; on 3 May the Basaj battalion, numbering 670 men, fought a battle with an armoured train near Krasnobród during its march to Puszcza Solska; after breaking the railway track, the train departed; the battalion suffered no losses. On 11 May, the 5th \"Ryś\" battalion, together with the Home Army unit of J. Turowski \"Norbert\" unit derailed a train with ammunition near the station of Krasnobród colony; part of the escort was liquidated, part fled towards the station; several Germans were killed; weapons and ammunition were captured, the track was blocked for 3 days; 28 May - 9 June, on the Tanew River in Biłgoraj district, a battle was fought between Polish and Soviet partisan units and a Kalmyk cavalry brigade; the \"Ryś\" battalion took part in the battle; during the two-week fighting, the front stabilised on the line of the Tanew and Wirawa rivers and on the edge of the Solska Forest; the Kalmyk units were changed by Wehrmacht units; the German actions were a preparation for the counter-partisan action code-named \"Sturmwind\" (\"Wicher\"); the Polish partisans had 10. killed and 20. wounded; enemy losses were 120. Kalmyks and several Germans killed.\n\n\n=== Sturmwind II ===\nOn 18-28 June 1944, one of the largest military operations against partisans under the code name \"Sturmwind II\" (\"Whirlwind II\") took place in the Solska Forest in the Biłgoraj Region. Partisan groups of the AK, BCh, AL and Soviet troops got into a huge cauldron; out of a total number of 3800 partisans, BCh units fielded 570, including the 1st Battalion \"Ryś\" - 300; the Germans against partisan units used ca. 30,000 soldiers; the BCh units, which were part of an AK grouping under the command of Major Edward Markiewicz \"Kalina\", fought heavy battles and attempted to break out of the encirclement, but suffering heavy losses, were repulsed; about 50 soldiers from the 1st Battalion were killed, many were wounded; some managed to escape from the encirclement. Basaj did not take part in the battle, as he left with two platoons in the Solska Forest for the Krasnostawski District. The commander of Rysia's unit in the fights in Puszcza Solska was platoon leader Antoni Warchał \"Szczerba\" from Kryłów, who was killed in the fight in the Maziarnia marshes. It was the last, unfortunately lost, big battle of the 1st BCh battalion of the Hrubieszów district; a few more smaller actions were performed and the fight was practically finished on 18 July 1944 with a skirmish with a detachment of Germans and Vlasov soldiers robbing the village of Stasin; the attackers withdrew, losing several dead. Further armed actions were no longer possible due to the heavy saturation of the area with German troops due to the approaching eastern front.\n  On 22 July 1944, the BCh \"Ryś\" unit was disbanded. With the advent of liberation, the threat from Ukrainian bands did not diminish. Stanisław Basaj, by order of the District Government Delegate for Poland - Lucjan Świdziński, was appointed to the position of Deputy District Commander of the State Security Corps. \"Ryś\" proceeded to create posts and self-defence points, manning them with former partisans.\n\n\n=== Death ===\n\"Ryś\" was hated by the Ukrainians, with whom he fought in the ranks of the MO formations after the Red Army drove the Germans away. On 25 March 1945 in the town of Kryłów Ukrainians organised an ambush into which \"Ryś\" fell, captured him and in a bestial way murdered him (crushing his body with a wheel), and then buried him in a place unknown to this day. For harbouring an \"enemy of Ukraine\", the Uprising organised the so-called Bloody Sunday in Krylov, at which time 17 officers of the Civic Militia and 28 civilians were murdered.\n\nAccording to another version, Basaj lost his life on 27 March 1945, two days after being abducted from Krylov. He was interrogated in Liski Waręskie in the presence of the highest-ranking members of the Ukrainian underground in the Chełm region, including probably the OUN-B Security Service referent Łeonid Łapinśki 'Zenon'. This is also where all trace of Basaj disappears. Presumably he was executed in this area\nAs one of the women who was carried along with \"Rys\" on the wagon testified, that she last saw him alive in the Malkov forest, near the St Anthony's chapel. There the women were placed on one wagon. After entering the Dołhobyczów forest, the carts were separated. During the journey through the forest, one of the cartmen (Karol Bardyga), managed to escape. The women were locked in a cellar in Żniatyń. They were freed after a few days by Polish Army soldiers. The others, including Stanisław Basaj \"Rys\", were murdered. Their burial place was never found. Three people managed to survive the massacre at the post.\n\n\n== Commemorate ==\nThe latest source research, witness testimonies and an accurate assessment of the political situation at the time after 22 July 1944 indicate that the murder was committed by an armed band of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army with the full approval or even assistance of the Hrubieszów UB or NKVD.\nDuring the communist years many difficulties were created in commemorating this tragic event. It was not until the mid 1980s that permission was obtained to erect a monument next to the then militia post. In 1990, a cross was erected and consecrated at the monument.\nIn the Sandomierz cemetery, in the shadow of a juniper tree, there is a tomb where Genowefa Basaj - Stanisław Basaj's wife - was buried on 21 July 2008. In addition to the name of the deceased, the monument bears the inscription Stanisław Basaj \"Ryś\". During a brief conversation, Mrs Kamila Bogowska said: \"I had my father's name put on the monument so that in this way we would have his symbolic grave. This is how I would like to live to see his remains found and buried with dignity\".\nPerhaps in the future it will be possible to clarify the whole truth about the tragic events of Sunday, 25 March 1945, to find out where \"Rys\" and the others were murdered and buried so that they can be given a dignified soldier's funeral. With their heroic attitude they fully deserved it.\n\n\n== Medals ==\nhaving been decorated with the - Order of Virtuti Militari\n\n\n== Assessment ==\nBasaj played a significant role in the Polish underground. Throughout the occupation, he led fight against the enemy, he created a large partisan unit, which in 1944 reached a strength of about 800 soldiers, and operated in the extremely difficult, forestless terrain where the Germans had begun the implementation of the General Plan East, with all its consequences, and soon later, German-backed Ukrainian nationalists attempted to create a 'Bander republic' and 'cleanse the Banderovska republic\" and \"purge\" these lands of Poles. The combat actions carried out by the 1 The BCh battalions of the Hrubieszów district were well organised and effective. They saved a dozen Polish villages from extermination, created combat protection for the hiding population in hiding and inflicted heavy losses on the enemy. Only in two cases did the \"Ryś\" battalion suffer a defeat, but this was due to the overwhelming superiority of the enemy. The following deserve special recognition also deserves the exemplary cooperation of \"Ryś\" with other groupings of the Fighting Poland, and especially with the Home Army.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPolish–Ukrainian ethnic conflict\nBattle of Osuchy\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nŁuny nad Buczwą i Bugiem - Walki oddziałów AK i Bch w Obwodzie Hrubieszowskim w latach 1939-1944 - Wacław Jaroszyński, Bolesław Kłembukowski, Eugeniusz Tokarczuk https://books.google.pl/books/about/%C5%81uny_nad_Huczw%C4%85_i_Bugiem.html?id=pjT4GgAACAAJ&redir_esc=y\nZajączkowski, Mariusz. „Legenda w najlepszym wypadku…”.

The spirit-child Azaro remains in the chaotic world of his African village, seeing the turbulent and fragile lives of the Living. These include his mother, who fights for justice, and his father, who is imprisoned for a crime he did not commit. The book is the third book of a trilogy which began with Famished Road in 1991.\n\n\n== Plot synopsis ==\nInfinite Riches begins where Songs of Enchantment ends, with Azaro's father being incarcerated for the suspected murder of a neighbor. Azaro is a child of spirit. He promised his spirit friends that he would die as soon as possible and return to them after he was born. However, Azaro breached his promise when he was born. So far, his spirit mates have dispatched five spirits, but they haven't succeeded in getting him back. The two most dangerous are dispatched in addition.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nFulford, Sarah (2009). \"Ben Okri, the Aesthetic, and the Problem with Theory\".

        "content": "Jan Holnicki-Szulc is a Polish structural engineer, author, and academic. He is a professor at the Institute of Fundamental Technological Research Polish Academy of Sciences (IPPT-PAN) and serves as the Head of the Department of Intelligent Technologies.\nHolnicki-Szulc's research interest lies in structural mechanics, optimal design, and material science. He has over 200 publications to his name, including book chapters, refereed journal articles, and authored books like Virtual Distortion Method and Structural Analysis, Design, and Control, as well as edited works such as Smart Structures and Smart Technologies for Safety Engineering. He received the Kobori Prize and was honored as a Director's Awards 2nd Degree Winner.\n\n\n== Education ==\nHolnicki-Szulc earned his M.Sc. in Engineering from the Warsaw University of Technology in 1969, followed by an M.Sc. in Mathematics from the University of Warsaw in 1972. He completed his Ph.D. in Technical Sciences at IPPT-PAN in 1973 and obtained his Habilitation degree in 1983.\n\n\n== Career ==\nHolnicki-Szulc started serving as an assistant professor in 1973 at IPPT-PAN. He held research positions at the University of Michigan in 1978 and Lehigh University in 1981 and later served as an associate professor from 1983 to 1999, also holding the appointment of Research Specialist at Virginia Polytechnic Institute in 1988 and Northwestern University in 1986. Since 1999, he has held the position of Professor at IPPT-PAN, where he leads the Division of Safety Engineering (Smart-Tech Centre) and the Department of Intelligent Technologies.\nHolnicki-Szulc has led research projects in space technology and energy production. As project coordinator, he oversaw the EU Project ADLAND (2008–2010), and EU Marie Curie Project SMART-NEST (2011–2015), focusing on adaptive shock absorbers for aircraft landing gears. Among national projects, he coordinated SMART and SAFE (2008–2012), and AIA Polish (2013–2016), which developed methods and tools for health monitoring, adaptive design, and vibration control.\n\n\n== Works ==\nHolnicki-Szulc explored the concept of virtual distortions as a computational tool for analyzing structural problems caused by incompatible deformations in his 1991 book, Virtual Distortion Method. In 1995, he co-authored Structural Analysis, Design, and Control by the Virtual Distortion Method with Jacek T. Gierlinski, introducing the Virtual Distortion Method (VDM) and its applications in structural analysis and design, providing theoretical foundations on how VDM facilitates efficient computational methods.\nHolnicki-Szulc, in collaboration with José Rodellar, edited Smart Structures, which delved into advancements in fundamental research, intelligent monitoring for structural identification, and damage assessment. He alongside Carlos Mota Soares, compiled invited lectures from the AMAS & ECCOMAS Workshop/Thematic Conference SMART'03 on smart materials and structures in the publication Advances in Smart Technologies in Structural Engineering. Tracy Kijewski-Correa in her review praised the book saying \"this book emphasizes the unique and promising solutions to societal problems.\" In the 2008 book Smart Technologies for Safety Engineering, he presented a decade's worth of research from the Smart-Tech Centre, highlighting interdisciplinary applications like intelligent structures, adaptive materials, and control systems.\n\n\n== Research ==\nHolnicki-Szulc has focused his research on creating adaptive impact absorption, virtual distortion methods, and innovative designs such as motor less landing capsules and adaptive landing gears.\nHolnicki-Szulc developed the Virtual Distortion Method (VDM) in the early eighties, highlighting its effectiveness as a numerical tool for rapid structural reanalysis across various engineering domains. Inspired by the theory of elastic distortions, which models dislocations within an elastic continuum, this method enabled swift reanalysis in structural optimization. The initial applications of his VDM method spanned diverse areas, including modeling elastic-plastic progressive collapse using a linear system formulation and representing physical nonlinearities through virtual distortions. Later, his focus shifted to Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) issues with a specific focus on applying the VDM technique to address the inverse problem of damage identification. Additionally, the need for developing \"smart\" techniques for Adaptive Impact Absorption (AIA) emerged from his product-oriented \"Copernicus\" projects. This led him to explore new techniques for impact load identification, both online and offline, essential for AIA applications and addressing black-box engineering problems.\nHolnicki-Szulc and his research group, Smart-Tech, delved in the challenging domain of AIA requiring multidisciplinary skills in mechanics, control, material science, electronics, optics, and informatics. He alongside this group, played a role in organizing the ECCOMAS Thematic Conference on Smart Structures and Materials, held biennially since September 2003 in Jadwisin, Poland. They developed Smart Technology Expert Courses and identified a new research field, stratospheric engineering, focusing on innovative helium-filled aerostats with adaptive morphing properties since 2014.\nHolnicki-Szulc introduced a design concept for adaptive materials comprising elements with controllable yield stresses showcasing numerical simulations of their adaptation to various impact scenarios. Collaborating with Grzegorz M. Mikułowski, he introduced an integrated feedback control concept for adaptive landing gears, addressing limitations of classical designs by proposing a system to adjust damping force based on sink speed. His development of a motorless landing capsule, integrating a rotor and adjustable landing gear to ensure secure landings of fragile cargo, resulted in an approved patent for enhancing stability during cargo descent. Furthermore, he engineered a mobile capsule with a docking connector, optimizing helium gas replenishment for tethered helium kites mid-flight, facilitated by a regulated sliding shut-off valve for precise gas flow control.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n2014 – Kobori Prize, International Association for Structural Control and Monitoring\n2019 – Director's Awards 2nd Degree Winner, IPPT PAN\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Selected books ===\nVirtual Distortion Method (1991) ISBN 978-3540537793\nStructural Analysis, Design and Control by the Virtual Distortion Method (1995) ISBN 978-0471956563\nSmart Structures: Requirements and Potential Applications in Mechanical and Civil Engineering (1999) ISBN 978-0792356127\nAdvances in Smart Technologies in Structural Engineering (2004) ISBN 978-3642061042\nSmart Technologies for Safety Engineering (2008) ISBN 978-0470058466\n\n\n=== Selected articles ===\nHolnicki‐Szulc, J., & Gierlinski, J.

        "content": "Devil Summoner: Soul Hackers New Generation is a role-playing video game developed and published by Bbmf. It is a spin-off from Atlus's Devil Summoner series, which in turn is part of the Megami Tensei series. It was released for Japanese feature phones starting on July 22, 2008, and was Bbmf's second time making a game based on Devil Summoner: Soul Hackers, following their 2007 strategy role-playing game Soul Hackers Intruder.\nThe game is focused on combat: the player, as a devil summoner, battles against other summoners' demons, with the goal of rising through the ranks and become a master summoner. It was well received for the depth of its combat gameplay, which critics found comparable to that of the original Soul Hackers.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\n\nDevil Summoner: Soul Hackers New Generation is a role-playing video game set in a network-based world in the Soul Hackers setting, where the player takes the role of one of many devil summoners who battle against each other's demons to rise through eight ranks and earn the rank of master summoner. The player develops and plans their team of demons, who have various strengths and weaknesses, access to different physical and magical attacks, and different compatibility with each other; they also determine their formation, with up to three demons placed in the front, and up to three in the back.\nThe player uses magnetite to summon demons into battle: an allied demon that has been defeated can be summoned again, so long as the player has the required amount. Stronger demons require larger amounts, and the player loses a battle if they run out of demons and the magnetite needed to summon more.\nIn addition to the challenge battles, through which the player earns higher ranks, there are repeatable free battles, through which the player can train and develop their demons. By visiting Victor in Hotel Goumaden, the player can buy more demons for their team, or fuse multiple demons into single stronger ones, which will inherit magic skills from the demons used in the fusion. There are over 200 types of demons, and a side objective is to collect all of them.\n\n\n== Release and reception ==\nNew Generation was developed and published by Bbmf, and was released for Japanese feature phones starting on July 22, 2008, through the Megaten Alpha mobile game distribution service, before being released on services for other carriers throughout the year. The developers chose to eschew the 3D dungeon crawling of the original Soul Hackers, and instead focused on strategic combat challenges. It was Bbmf's second mobile game based on Soul Hackers, after the 2007 strategy role-playing game Devil Summoner: Soul Hackers Intruder; unlike Intruder, which is a sequel set half a year after Soul Hackers, New Generation was not set during any specific time.\nGA Graphic liked New Generation's gameplay for being easy to grasp while offering depth; they and Game Watch both found it fitting for a mobile game as it allowed the player to play through battles in a short amount of time; Gpara, too, appreciated the depth of its battles, considering them similar to those of the original Soul Hackers, and the amount of demon allies for the player choose from.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Baby, I Couldn't See was a 1969 single for The Foundations. It enjoyed some popularity in the Netherlands there where it was a chart hit. It has been recorded by a number of other artists in the early 1970s which include, a number of South American acts, a Mexican band, and a New Zealand band.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn addition to the version by The Foundations, New Zealand group Quincy Conserve recorded their version of the song. Somehow, the song was credited to Macleod and Macaulay who the group had a previous partnership with. It was also covered by Brazilian bands, The Pops and Os Selvagens, and included on both of their albums, Reação! and  Os Selvagens that were released in 1970. Instrumental artist, Lafayette also recorded a version which appeared on his 1970 album, Apresenta Os Sucessos - Vol. 9. A Mexican group called Las Lineas Blancas (aka The White Lines) recorded a version which appeared on their 1971 album released on Harmony HLS-8570.\n\n\n== The Foundations version ==\n\nThe song features Colin Young on lead vocals.\n\n\n=== Composition and production ===\nBarry Class' Trend record label had taken on two new songwriters who had left Southern Music to come on board in 1969. They were David Myers and John Worsley. Together they wrote \"Baby, I Couldn't See\" for The Foundations. The recording session which was a Trend Production had Barry Class as executive producer. It took place under the direction of Eric Allendale who was the Foundations trombonist and Worsley. Allendale had also been employed by Trend as a producer since 1968. It is possible that Allendale was an uncredited producer on this track. \n\"Baby, I Couldn't See\" was backed with the Colin Young composition \"Penny Sir\" and released on single, Pye 7N 17849 on 7 November 1969.\n\n\n=== Reception ===\nThe song was reviewed in the \"Blind Date\" section of the November 8, 1969 issue of Melody Maker by Steve Marriott of Small Faces and Jerry Shirley. Jerry asked if it was The Foundations and said that he tried to cheat but couldn't read the writing. Steve said that he could see it at the Top of the Pops but said that he thought that \"they\" weren't that knocked out with it because \"they\" could do better.\nIt was also reviewed in the November 8 issue of New Musical Express by Derek Johnson. He mentioned that the Foundations had dissolved their partnership with their Macaulay, Macleod song writing team. The chart potential was noted. Johnson also mentioned that their previous single which was a ballad, and a thoroughly competent disc that just didn't catch on. This song had reverted to their happy effervescent style. He said that this could put them back in the chart.\nAn article appeared in the November 15 issue of New Musical Express about the B side of the single, \"Penny Sir\" which was composed by Colin Young. It explained that the song was being adopted as the official song for the Save the Children Fund. The group was donating the royalties from \"Penny Sir\" to the fund as well as performance royalties. The Foundations were also planning a concert at the Royal Albert Hall to support the cause.\n\n\n=== Chart ===\nIt was a hit in Holland where it registered on to the Dutch Tipparade chart. Peaking at no. 8 on week three, It stayed in the chart for four weeks.\n\nChart summary\n\n\n=== Performances ===\nThe song was performed for the Top of the Pops radio show on November 19, 1969. There was also an interview on that show.\n\n\n=== Later years ===\nSome five decades later, the song was performed live by Alan Warner's Foundations in 2020.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDiscogs - The Foundations – Baby, I Couldn't See / Penny Sir\nThe Foundations, channel Nov 24, 2022 - Baby, I Couldn't See (Stereo) (audio)\nsoulsteve100 channel, Apr 21, 2021 - The Foundations - Baby, I Couldn't See - Sixties Pop-Soul fave (audio)\nThe Foundations channel, Jul 21, 2021 - A Penny, Sir (audio)\nMarian Payne channel, Feb 2, 2020 - The Foundations - Baby I Couldn't See Live.

        "content": "Yangliujie Catholic Church is a former Catholic church in Zunyi, Guizhou, China. On the course of the Long March, the Chinese Red Army used the church to host its political directorate during the Zunyi Conference in January 1935. It was given to the local government in 1951, renovated, and opened to the general public in 1985 as a part of the site of the Zunyi Conference.\n\n\n== History ==\nAccording to Adrien Launay, in 1866, the Apostolic Vicar of Guizhou Louis-Simon Faurie divided his ecclesiastical province into two vicariates, with Zunyi being the seat of the northern one. By the end of 1867, Zunyi had five groups of Christians. In the same year, the French priest Simon-Jude-Alphonse Mihières purchased lands and houses for a location to host worship. In 1869 there was an anti-Christian riot in Zunyi. The church and the priests' house were looted, and 25 to 30 Christians were killed.\nIn 1874, the French priest Eugène-Charles Bouchard purchased a local house and founded a church in Zunyi. A 1876 letter recorded that the church in Zunyi was under the patronage of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In 1884 tensions between Christians and Zunyi populace rose again in Zunyi. Rioters destroyed the priests' house and attempted to burn down the church. Launay estimated a loss of 250,000 francs. There was another attack in 1886. An 1896 French-Qing agreement allowed the missionaries to return to Zunyi. The current church building was completed in 1897.\nThe Paris Foreign Missions Society (MEP) recorded the presence of the Chinese Red Army in the Apostolic Vicariate of Guiyang in 1935, noting that the army pillaged its residences and used them to station troops. In particular, when the army occupied Zunyi several times in 1935, Catholic missionaries had to flee to local Christian families or into the mountains. According to Chinese sources, the Red Army first arrived in Zunyi in January 1935 on its Long March, and its political directorate was stationed at the church during the Zunyi Conference, a CCP Politiburo meeting that reorganised its leadership. At the church, the political directorate convened a town hall with representatives from the local people and a meeting that delivered the resolutions of the Zunyi Conference to Red Army officers. During the Battle of Chishui River, the Red Army returned to Zunyi. The CCP Central Committee held another meeting at the church to summarise its military experience. The missionaries returned after the army left. According to the MEP, the army did not destroy any of its churches or houses in Zunyi, but \"all things were looted\".\nAfter the PRC was established in 1949, in 1951 the Zunyi government sought to use the church as part of the memorial for the Zunyi Conference. The church was given to the government in exchange of houses of the same size in the Sifangtai (四方台) area of the city, and the Catholic congregation moved in 1952. China's National Cultural Heritage Administration (NCHA) funded the church building's renovation in 1978. In December 1983, the church was included into the \"Site of the Zunyi Conference\", a Major Historical and Cultural Site Protected at the National Level of China. After another round of NCHA renovation in 1984, it was opened to the general public in 1985.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe church building is 36.5 m (120 ft) long and 14.5 m (48 ft) wide. It has a total area of 382.5 m2 (4,117 sq ft). Its façade is in the form of a Chinese Pailou, with up-pointing flying eaves. Its gates are adorned with Chinese Duilian verses, and its pillars have Chinese pedestals. However, it also contains Neo-Romanesque arches and a rose window. In 1978, some parts of the church were rebuilt with reinforced concrete to strengthen its structure. The church's interior is supported by pillars with capitals depicting flowers and figures. It has a vaulted ceiling illuminated by chandeliers. The church is covered with traditional Chinese roof tiles.\nThe church building has a Chinese-style quadrangle to its left, enclosed by its school house, offices, and residential house.\n\n\n== See also ==\nQiao'ergou Catholic Church, Yan'an, another former Catholic Church used by the Chinese Communist Party in the 1930s.\nSt. Joseph's Cathedral, Guiyang, 19th-century Catholic church in Guizhou still in use\nChristianity in Guizhou\n\n\n== Explanatory notes ==\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n=== Magazines and periodicals ===\n\n\n=== Mission reports ===\n\n\n=== Books ===",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Beaumaris Lifeboat Station is located in the town of Beaumaris, on the Isle of Anglesey, in Wales.\nA lifeboat was first stationed here by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) in 1891.\nFor many years, Beaumaris was home to four different Inshore lifeboats, all named Blue Peter II after funds were raised by the BBC TV programme, but since 2010, the station has operated the B-class (Atlantic 85) Inshore lifeboat Annette Mary Liddington (B-838).\n\n\n== History ==\nOn 7 November 1890, in very rough seas in the Menai Strait, the Penmon lifeboat Christopher Brown capsized after recovering 5 crew from the Undaunted, aground on Lavan Sands. The lifeboat self-righted, and all were recovered. Following this, the crew requested of the RNLI, that a larger sailing lifeboat be placed in the Menai Strait. Beaumaris Lifeboat Station started with the arrival of the 42-foot lifeboat Henry Dundas (ON 271), previously at St Mary's, on 6 October 1891. The boat was moored afloat, and renamed Tom and Jenny.\nThe lifeboat was called on service 6 times over the following 4 years, rescuing 2 lives. However, in 1896, a new larger boat was placed at Penmon, and the Beaumaris station was closed on 16 April 1896. Tom and Jenny (ON 271) would be transferred to Rosslare Harbour, where she would serve for a further 15 years.\nIn 1910, it was decided to re-open the Beaumaris station, and place a motor-powered lifeboat there. Construction began of a new boathouse, pier and deep-water roller-slipway near Tre-Castell Point, costing £4,500. An order was placed with Thames Ironworks for a 43-foot Watson-class lifeboat, with a 60 hp Tylor 'D' petrol engine, providing 7½ knots, and costing a further £3,727. Completed in August 1913, she was first taken to Cowes Regatta, where a short trip was taken by King George V. The boat remained in Cowes due to construction delays with the new boathouse, eventually arriving in Beaumaris in July 1914, where it would be named Frederick Kitchen (ON 621). Over the following 31 years at Beaumaris, Frederick Kitchen would launch 38 times, and rescue 46. The Penmon station was subsequently closed on 31 March 1915.\nIn 1966, the BBC TV programme Blue Peter launched an appeal for 60,000 paperback books, the sale of which would fund a new Inshore lifeboat for the RNLI. Such was the success of the appeal, that four new lifeboats were provided. The BBC TV programme would eventually fund 28 lifeboats located around the UK and Northern Ireland.\nBeaumaris would receive their first Inshore lifeboat, Blue Peter II (D-127), in 1967. A small boathouse was erected near Victoria Terrace, replaced with a more permanent building nearer the pier in 1975. Further works were carried out to extend the building in 1983 and 1991, with a completely new station being built in 2000.\nBlue Peter II (D-127) would serve for 7 years, launching 123 times, and saving 45 lives. She would be replaced by a larger B-class (Atlantic 75) lifeboat in 1976, and two further Atlantic type boats, all named Blue Peter II. After her service at Beaumaris, Blue Peter II (D-127) would go on display at Flambards Theme Park, Helston.\nIn 1991, with a Mersey-class lifeboat stationed at Llandudno, and a Tyne-class lifeboat at Moelfre, it was decided to close the boathouse and slipway near Tre-Castell Point, which was subsequently demolished. Beaumaris lifeboat The Robert (ON 955) was withdrawn and retired from service on 7 July 1991.\nIn 2010, Beaumaris received their latest Inshore lifeboat, an B-class (Atlantic 85) lifeboat, Annette Mary Liddington (B-838), the boat being funded by local donations, and from the bequest of Mr John Grover Liddington, in memory of his mother.\n\n\n== Station honours ==\nThe following are awards made at Beaumaris\n\nRNLI Silver Medal\nDavid Griffiths, Seaman - 1830\nWilliam Lewis Walker, Collegian - 1831 (Medal and Silver Boat, double award)\nRalph Williamson, Capt. of yacht Campeadora - 1831 (Medal and Silver Boat, double award)\nRNLI Bronze Medal\nDavid Gallichan, Coxswain - 1982\nThe Thanks of the Institution inscribed on Vellum\nJohn Charles Askew, Helmsman - 1976\nDavid Jones, Helmsman - 1978\nVellum Service Certificates\nJohn Askew, crew member - 1978\nSimon Dubberley, crew member - 1978\nDr Jack Dubberley, crew member - 1978\nA Framed Letter of Thanks signed by the Chairman of the Institution\nBeaumaris Coxswain and Crew - 1959\nMartin Broughton, crew member - 1998\n\n\n== Beaumaris lifeboats and tractors ==\n\n\n=== All-weather lifeboats ===\n\nAll-weather lifeboat withdrawn in 1991\n\n\n=== Inshore lifeboats ===\n\n\n=== Launch and recovery tractors ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of RNLI stations\nList of former RNLI stations\nRoyal National Lifeboat Institution\nRoyal National Lifeboat Institution lifeboats\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "The Bourne Valley Viaducts are two Victorian brick railway viaducts in Bournemouth and Poole, England. One bridge is disused while the other carries a section of the South West Main Line from London to Weymouth between Bournemouth railway station and Branksome railway station. \n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1888, London and South Western Railway constructed a viaduct consisting of ten curved arches. In 1893, another viaduct was built on its west side that created a triangle of routes, allowing incoming trains to travel west towards Poole bypassing Bournemouth West railway station. The railway bridge crosses the River Bourne. Underneath the bridge are Surrey Road and Gordon Road near Coy Pond and Bournemouth Gardens as the railway follows Bourne Valley Road towards Branksome. The original bridge was closed in 1965 during the Beeching cuts. On 27 March 1941, an Luftwaffe air raid in World War II hit the nearby canteen at Bourne Valley Gasworks killing 33 people. It is believed that the viaducts had been the intended target. In 2020, a lorry crashed into the bridge. The low arches at Bourne Valley Road reportedly make accidents common. In 2023, improvements to the bridge were carried out by BCP Council.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nThe military defences from World War II remain beneath the bridge.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPhotographic tour\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of railway bridges and viaducts in the United Kingdom",

        "content": "Atikur Rahman (born 1994) is a member of the banned Islamic political organisation Popular Front of India and a human rights defender who has been involved in activism in India. He was arrested on 5 October 2020, along with journalist Siddique Kappan, student Masood Ahmad, and taxi driver Mohammad Alam while they were on their way to meet the family of a Dalit woman who was raped and murdered in Hathras, Uttar Pradesh.\n\n\n== Arrest and charges ==\nAtikur along with three others was arrested in October 2020 whilst en path to Hathras, Uttar Pradesh, following the alleged gang rape and murder of a 19-year-antique Dalit girl. Uttar Pradesh's Special Task Force officially charged them with multiple offenses, including sedition, criminal conspiracy, terror funding, and promoting enmity among one-of-a-kind companies based on various factors like faith and place of house and claimed that they were purportedly journeying to Hathras with the purpose to disturb peace as part of a conspiracy. They were also charged with sections 17 and 18 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act associated with elevating funds for terror acts and numerous sections of the IT Act.\nIn March 2023, He was granted bail in the a case filed under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act. However, his release from detention was delayed due to the absence of bail in the Prevention of Money Laundering Activities case lodged against him. Subsequently, in May of the same year, a court in Uttar Pradesh granted him bail in connection with a case filed by the Enforcement Directorate.\n\n\n== Health deterioration ==\nRahman's health deteriorated while in detention; he developed a neurological disease in addition to an existing heart ailment, leading to paralysis on the left side of his body and memory loss. Despite his condition, there were reports of delays and denials of medical treatment. Amnesty International and other human rights organizations have called for his immediate release, stating that his detention was arbitrary and solely for peacefully exercising his human rights.\nAfter spending 32 months in jail, Atikur Rahman was finally released. He was a Ph.D. student at Meerut's Chaudhary Charan Singh University and also the national office bearer of Campus Front of India, a student movement. He was active during the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests and has been vocal about issues affecting marginalized communities in India.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Renato De Fusco (14 July 1929 – 30 April 2024) was an Italian architectural historian, art theorist and academic. He was professor emeritus of the University of Naples Federico II.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nBorn in Naples, De Fusco studied architecture at the University of Naples Federico II, graduating in 1959. Initially interested in painting, he was part of the art movements \"Gruppo Sud\" and \"MAC (Movimento Arte Concreta)\". \nAfter working as a designer and as an architect for a series of projects, notably a complex of public housing buildings in the Montedonzelli neighborhood in his hometown,  and after collaborating with the Institute of Architectural History directed by Roberto Pane and with the magazine Casabella, in 1961 he started his academic journey in his alma mater, first as a lecturer and starting from 1972 as an ordinary professor. In 1964, he founded the architectural and art journal Op.cit.selezione della critica d'arte contemporanea, which he directed for sixty years, until his death. \nDe Fusco was author of dozens of books, starting from the late 1950s. First close to Roberto Pane's theories, he developed a personal research and theoretical perspective, starting from his 1964 history of modern architectural criticism L'idea di architettura ('The Idea of Architecture').  Among his most important works, Architettura come mass medium ('Architecture as a mass medium', 1967), Storia dell’architettura contemporanea  ('History of contemporary architecture', 1974), Il progetto d'architettura ('The Architectural Project', 1983), Storia del design ('History of Design', 1985), Mille anni di architettura in Europa ('One thousand years of architecture in Europe', 1993), Trattato di architettura ('Treatise on architecture', 2001), and Filosofia del design ('Design philosophy', 2012). \nDuring his career De Fusco received various honors and awards, notably a Golden Compass for his career in 2008. He died on 30 April 2024, at the age of 94.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nRenato De Fusco at Open Library",

He was appointed a Doctor of Divinity by the Archbishop of Canterbury in 1873.\nOrdained priest in 1852 he carried out a curacy at St Mark's Kennington (1851–1856). In 1857 he became Rector of St Vedast Foster Lane with St Michael-le-Querne, St Matthew Friday-street, and St. Peter Cheapside, which he retained until his death. Much of his career was spent at St. Paul's Cathedral where he was a minor canon from 1861, Succentor (1876–1885), Junior Cardinal (1878–1881), and Sub-Dean from 1881.\nHe was an active librarian of St. Paul's Cathedral from 1861, and was additionally made an Honorary Librarian at Lambeth Palace Library in 1870. He was a noted antiquary and collectors of books and curiosities, and has been described as 'the best historian of St Paul's Cross'.\nHe was the father of William John Sparrow Simpson, who published his father's memoir in 1899.\n\n\n== Selected Works ==\nChapters in the History of Old S.

        "content": "Nato Shavlakadze or Nato Shavlaqadze (born January 15, 1966) is a Georgian human rights activist. In 2024 she and Eliso Amirejibi were awarded the Georgian Order of Merit for their work with the National Network of Protection from Violence.\n\n\n== Life ==\nShavlakadze was born in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi in 1966. She studied technology and law at the Agricultural University of Georgia in her home city. She then worked initially as a laboratory assistant in a number of organisations.\nIn 1998 she was elected as the chair of the women's organisation named \"Peony\" and in 2003 she began to lead Georgia's \"National Network of Protection from Violence\" which she and Eliso Amirejibi had founded with the support of the Open Society Georgia Foundation. In the following year the first Georgian shelter for families facing domestic violence was opened in Tbilisi and in 2005 the organisation partnered with similar organisations to draft new laws for Georgia that reflected the modern approach to dealing with domestic violence. The organisation soon had a dozen regional committees.\nOn International Women's Day on 8 March 2024 the President of Georgia, Salome Zourabichvili, spoke about the need to control violence against women and femicide. She saw it as a shame to the country. She gave Georgian Orders of Honour to Nato and four other women. The four others were Babutsa Pataraia, Tamuna Museridze, Eliso Amirejibi and Ana Arganashvili. They were all associated with human rights and the President gave them the award at the Orbeliani Palace.\n\n\n== References ==",

He taught at Harvard University from 1892 to 1937.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nCharles Burton Gulick, son of traveling salesman Horace Gulick and his wife Anna Louise Sillcocks Gulick, studied classical philology at Harvard University. He earned his bachelor's degree in 1890 and his master's degree in 1891. Following this, he traveled to Germany and Greece for further study. Gulick spent his entire academic career at Harvard, starting as an instructor in Greek in 1892. In 1894, he earned his doctorate and was promoted to assistant professor. He became a full Professor of Greek in 1909 and was appointed Eliot Professor of Greek in 1925. Additionally, he served as a visiting professor at the American School of Classical Studies at Athens in 1911–1912, President of the Classical Association of New England in 1928–1929, and President of the American Philological Association in 1929–1930. Gulick retired in 1937 due to deteriorating eyesight, which forced him to give up his academic work.\nGulick was interested in various aspects of Greek culture. He wrote two books on the private life of the Greeks and a bilingual edition of Athenaeus' \"Deipnosophistae\" for the Loeb Classical Library in 1927. With his considerable proficiency in the Greek language, he was able to revise the Greek grammar of his senior colleague, William Watson Goodwin, in 1930.\nIn 1913, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and in 1940, to the American Philosophical Society.\n\n\n== Selected works ==\nDe scholiis Aristophaneis quaestiones mythicae.

        "content": "Massive renaming of Crimean toponyms by Soviet government took place during the process of conversion of the Crimean ASSR into the Crimean Oblast, in four waves of renaming (in 1944, 1945, 1948, and 1949). Renaming occurred after the deportation in 1944 of Crimean Tatars and other non-Slavic peoples living in Crimea. The old names were mostly of Crimean Tatar origin, while the new ones were Russian. As a result of the renaming, over 1300 settlements in Crimea received new names (over 90% of the peninsula's settlements). A large part of the villages disappeared in the following decades. After 1990, three settlements returned to their historical names (Koktebel, Partenit, and Sarybash). The renaming is one of manifestations of de-tatarization in Crimea.\nIn 1944, Raions (districts) and Raion centers of Crimea were renamed; in 1945, village councils and their centers; and in 1948 and 1949, the majority of settlements. This list includes only settlements (i.e., it does not list the renamed districts and village councils). Settlements are divided by districts of the Crimean ASSR with their names before the renaming in the 1940s.\n\n\n== Ak-Mechet Raion ==\nAqmeçit (Ak-Mechet) → Chernomorskoye\nAblaq Acı →

        "content": "Wrestling with the Devil: A Prison Memoir is a 2018 memoir by Kenyan writer Ngugi wa Thiong'o. The book was published by the New York City-based publisher The New Press. It is an edited version of Thiongo'o's 1981 memoir, Detained: A Writer's Prison Diary, which was never published in the United States.\nThe book is about the drama and difficulties of creating fiction while under constant observation for twenty-four hours. In addition to capturing the unbearable anguish of being separated from his spouse and kids, he also depicts the spirit of defiance that characterizes optimism.\nThe memoir received positive reviews from Kirkus Reviews, The New York Times and Publisher's Weekly.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe memoir begins thirty minutes before his December 12, 1978, release from prison. He remembers, in one long flashback, the night a year prior, when he was taken from his home by armed police and imprisoned at Kenya's KamĪtĩ Maximum Security Prison, one of the biggest in Africa. He is segregated from the other inmates and resides in a prison block with eighteen other political prisoners.\n\n\n== Reference ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nMeenakshi, M.S.S.; Vennila, S.

        "content": "The Wuppertal poets' circle (German: Wuppertaler Dichterkreis or Wupperbund) was a literary circle that existed during the 1850s, remaining active into the 1870s and 1880s. The core of the loosely-knit group consisted of seven poets born in or around Wuppertal, Germany: the merchants Reinhart Neuhaus, Emil Rittershaus, Friedrich Roeber, Adolf Schults, Wilhelm Wens, Carl Siebel, Karl Stelter, and the bookseller Hugo Oelbermann. The circle \"opposed gloomy Wuppertal Pietism with a free and joyful view of existence.\"\n\n\n== History ==\nThe founders of the Wuppertal poets largely came from affluent merchant families. The forerunners to the circle included Biedermeier reading clubs, theatres and other societies in the 1830s and 1840s—directly, however, the association had its origins in an earlier reading circle and amateur theatre existing in the late 1840s, composed of Hugo Oelbermann, Emil Ritterhaus, Wilhelm Wens and later Carl Siebel.\nThis culminated in the founding of the circle in 1850, initially called the Wupperbund (lit. 'Wuppertal federation'), by Oelbermann, Rittershaus, Wens and Siebel. Aiming to give the circle credibility, they recruited figures already known in Wuppertal such as Adolf Schults and Friedrich Roeber, as well as lawyers, conductors and organists.\nThe members of the circle met at the coffeehouse of \"Knevels\" in the Old Market (Altenmarkt) in Barmen, Wuppertal.\nThe circle partially dissolved in 1853, after the departure of Oelbermann from Barmen, and was replaced by a Sunday circle (Sonntagskränzchen) at the house of Roeber, consisting of poetry recitations and drama readings. This successor itself dissolved in the early 1860s.\nAuthor Jost Hermand in 1998 summarised the circle as follows:\n\nIn their works is manifested the ideological dilemma of young merchants and factory owners' sons, who, despite their relentless desire for competition and their ruthless exploitation of the workers who laboured for them, continued to try to surround themselves with the early bourgeois-liberal appearance of education, even of poetic genius.\nThe term Wuppertaler Dichterkreis used to describe the group was coined by poet Wolfgang Müller von Königswinter in 1863.\nFriedrich Engels knew multiple members of the circle, keeping in contact with them during his residence in Bremen in 1838–1841, as some were fellow pupils of his at the Elberfeld high school.

        "content": "The Constitution Protection Region of Southern Fujian (Chinese: 閩南護法區; pinyin: Mǐnnán hùfǎ qū) was a de facto autonomous region of Republic of China established by the \"Guangdong Army to assist Fujian\" (Chinese: 援閩粵軍; pinyin: Yuánmǐn yuèjūn) led by General Chen Jiongming in 26 counties of southern and western Fujian with Zhangzhou as its capital. The region implemented some policies with anarchist characteristics.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Capture of Southern Fujian ===\nBy 1917, northern warlords had seized control of the Beiyang government. Revolutionaries in southern China responded by launching the Constitutional Protection Movement, calling for the restoration of the constitutional order. In October 1917, Chen Jiongming was appointed as commander-in-chief of the Guangdong Army, which was already planning a military expedition against the government.\nThe warlords of the Anhui and Zhili cliques sent their forces south to pacify the rebellion in Guangdong, acting with the assistance of Fujian's military governor Li Houji. Chen responded by ordering the Guangdong Army to \"assist Fujian\" (Chinese: 援閩粵軍; pinyin: Yuánmǐn yuèjūn) and bring it under the rule of the Constitutional Protection Junta. They transferred to Shantou, where Chen began recruiting thousands of people into his army. He established an arsenal in Shanwei, laid out an extensive military logistics network by building new roads and supply stations, and organised local militia to counter banditry and carry out guerrilla warfare against invading forces. He did this with little help from Guangdong's military governor Mo Rongxin, who denied him necessary funding, hoping to limit his growing influence.\nLi went ahead with his plans to attack Guangdong, recruiting thousands of people from Northern Fujian into his own army. On May 1918, Li attacked Guangdong, but faced heavy resistance from Chen's Guangdong Army and guerrilla militias. In August, Chen's forces mounted a counteroffensive and quickly advanced into Fujian. By the end of the month, they had captured the province's southern capital of Zhangzhou, which Chen established as his base of operations, while Li's army held onto its territory in Xiamen. In November 1918, the two sides arranged a brief armistice. Although Li received reinforcements from the north, the looting and arbitrary attacks carried out by the northern soldiers against the local population alienated the people of Fujian, who began cooperating with the Guangdong Army. By the end of 1918, Chen's numerically inferior forces had captured more than half of Fujian province.\n\n\n=== New Culture Movement ===\nWith a new base area in Minnan, Chen Jiongming began putting his ideas for reform into practice, building strong civilian institutions while maintaining his military strength. By this time, members of the New Culture Movement had begun calling for far-reaching modernizing reforms, including democratization, humanitarianism, scientific progress and mutual assistance. Chen's former teacher Zhu Zhixin invited members of the New Culture Movement to Zhangzhou, in order to carry out reforms, educate the populous and transform southern Fujian into a sustainable autonomous region. Chen himself believed that such a region could serve as a model for reforming the entire country, based on his federalist ideology.\n\nSome of the new invitees established a semi-weekly magazine, Minxing (Chinese: 閩星; English: Fujian Star), which was dedicated to discussion of reformist ideas; they also established a daily newspaper, Minxing rikan (Chinese: 閩星日刊; English: Fujian Star Daily News), which reported on global and local affairs and criticised existing traditions. Chen Jiongming himself frequently wrote for the magazine, penning critiques of the reform programs of Kang Youwei and Dai Jitao, publishing letters to and from the Chinese Women's Association, and even contributing poems to the publication. Aiming to reach the greatest number of readers, the magazine's editor Chen Qiulin (陳秋霖) made sure that all its works were published in written vernacular Chinese. The magazine published articles on many different subjects, including articles on sexuality, morality and religion; articles about the Russian Revolution, such as critiques of the Soviet Russian Constitution; and historical reports on Korean and Taiwanese independence struggles against the Empire of Japan. It also included contributions from Zhu Zhixin, Wang Jingwei and Hu Hanmin, who respectively wrote about societal, commercial and environmental reforms. Anarchists such as Liang Bingxian (梁冰弦) also contributed to the publication.\nChen Jiongming wrote extensively in Minxing about his views on the New Culture movement's philosophy. He believed that China ought to follow a process of sociocultural evolution, based in mutual aid, which he believed would eventually transform the country into a stateless society of social equality. In order to achieve this, he advocated for widespread \"thought reform\", while cautioning against the use of indoctrination or brainwashing. Chen also argued against individualism and nationalism, the latter of which he considered to be a way for \"ambitious politicians\" to \"fool their people and bully the world\", culminating in militarism and imperialism. Influenced by a synthesis of Social Darwinism and anarchism, Chen concluded his anti-nationalist remarks by calling for a \"socialism of all mankind\", based in fraternity and mutual aid. He believed that China could \"work for the benefit of the world\", but it had to start with internal reform, specifically thought reform. Chen also wrote the manifesto of Minxing rikan, in which he outlined its aims of liberty, equality and mutual aid.\n\n\n=== Anarchist and communist activity ===\nAs early as 1918, anarchist followers of Liu Shifu had moved from Guangdong to Fujian, in order to join up with Chen Jiongming. Chen, who was a former comrade of Shifu and sympathetic to anarchism, gave the anarchists his protection to operate with full freedom of association and freedom of the press. By early 1920, Fujian had become a center of the anarchist movement in China. During the May Fourth Movement, anarchist societies were organised in Zhangzhou and other cities, where they published periodicals and organised mass mobilisations.\nAlthough some anarchists had turned against Bolshevism by the outbreak of the Red Terror in early 1919, even a year later, other anarchists still supported it, considering it closely comparable to anarchism. Led by Liang Bingxian, the Fujian anarchist movement became a major source for news about the Russian Revolution. The Fujian anarchists were even contacted in March 1920 by the Communist International's official Grigori Voitinsky, who had been sent to China to organise the local communist movement. When Chen Duxiu started transforming New Youth into a nucleus for the foundation of the Chinese Communist Party, he appointed the Fujian anarchist Yuan Zhenying as its editor. With all this anarchist and communist activity, Chen's government became known in some circles as the \"Soviet Russia of Southern Fujian\".\nIn April 1920, the United States Department of State requested a report on the rise of \"Bolshevism\" in the region from the US consulate in Amoy. The report indicated that Bolshevism was gaining influence in Zhangzhou, where schools were teaching socialist doctrine and anarchist communist pamphlets were being circulated, some even by Chen Jiongming himself, who was also reported to have described Jesus as a socialist. At this time, the United States officials considered \"Bolshevism\" to be synonymous with \"anarchism\".\n\n\n=== Withdrawal ===\nThe Guangdong Army conducted two years of construction in the protectorate, achieving remarkable results. The Comintern's publication, \"Communist International,\" called Zhangzhou the center of revolution in southern China. On August 12, 1920, according to an agreement between Fujian and Guangdong, the Guangdong Army returned to Guangdong, and the Constitution Protection Region of Southern Fujian was subsequently abolished.\n\n\n== Relation with Soviet Russia ==\nThe achievements of the Constitution Protection Region of Southern Fujian attracted the attention of Soviet Russia. On April 29, 1920, General Alexey Potapov (also known as Lubo) who claimed to be a Soviet representative, met with Sun Yat-sen in Shanghai before visiting Chen Jiongming in Zhangzhou. Potapov brought a personal letter from Vladimir Lenin, expressing concern for the Chinese revolution and admiration and encouragement for Chen Jiongming. Potapov also conveyed Lenin's advice for Chen Jiongming to engage more in peasant movements and pay attention to mobilizing the masses. Chen Jiongming warmly welcomed Potapov and asked him to deliver a letter to Lenin. In the letter, Chen Jiongming expressed support for Lenin and his cause, hoping that \"the new China and the new Russia will join hands like intimate friends\" and declaring, \"I firmly believe that Bolshevism will benefit humanity, and I am willing to do my best to spread the principles of Bolshevism to the world.\"\n\n\n== Administration ==\n\n\n=== Government ===\n\nThe Constitutional Protection Region of Southern Fujian was administered by a combined civil-military government, which oversaw the region's economic and military consolidation. As commander-in-chief of the Guangdong Army, the region's de facto supreme ruler was Chen Jiongming, who appointed the administration's departmental heads.\n\nChen believed that the country needed full public participation in government, rather than a \"totalitarian government\", whether autocratic or oligarchic. Liang thus proposed that Chen discard the title of commander-in-chief, believing he could do \"more good for the society as a simple ordinary citizen\". But although Chen sympathised with anarchist arguments against taking power, he believed that, if he was not the one in power, it could have been taken by someone worse.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\nThe Constitution Protection Region of Southern Fujian consisted of 26 counties, in South Fujian and West Fujian, including:\nAdditionally, the Guangdong Army also contested for control over counties such as Putian, Xianyou, Yongchun, Nan'an, Jinjiang, Tong'an and Hui'an in Fujian with other local armed forces.\n\n\n== Economy and social policy ==\n\n\n=== Public works ===\n\nWith Zhou Xingnan appointed to head public works, the regional administration undertook a program to reform municipal infrastructure, aiming to turn Zhangzhou into China's first modern city. Over the course of six months, the administration demolished the city's defensive walls to make way for new infrastructure, building the city's first carriageways and public parks. In one of the parks, they erected a monument inscribed with the words \"liberty\" (Chinese: 自由; pinyin: zìyóu), \"equality\" (Chinese: 平等; pinyin: pingděng), \"fraternity\" (Chinese: 博愛; pinyin: bó'ài) and mutual aid (Chinese: 互助; pinyin: hùzhù), the four principles of the New Culture Movement. Zhangzhou also saw the construction of its first reinforced concrete bridge, first urban-rural road network, and first bank. Additionally, a factory for the poor, a grand hotel for guests, and a special district for prostitutes were established, and advanced agricultural production equipment was introduced. \nAccording to the American consul in Amoy, these public works were funded by progressive taxation, which was lower even than the Northern government's own taxes, and were largely welcomed by the general population. He contrasted Zhangzhou with the northern-occupied Amoy, \"the dirtiest city in China\", which had seen no meaningful improvements to public welfare in spite of the heavier taxation. According to Liang Bingxian, the infrastructure projects made Chen \"a hero to those who were concerned with the material improvement and reconstruction of China.\"\n\n\n=== Education ===\nAt Liang Bingxian's suggestion, and with the support of Zhu Zhixin, the civil-military administration established an education bureau. Liang himself was appointed to head the region's education program. In order to aid in the region's education and publication efforts, in late 1919, Liang brought several educators, mechanics, printers and writers to the region. The education bureau held an education conference, attended by school administrators and teachers from all of the region's 26 counties. Lectures were given by Wu Zhihui, who discussed the simplification of Chinese characters and the adoption of a phonetic alphabet, and Li Shizeng, who talked about democratic revolution.\nWhile maintaining support for primary education, the administration aimed to make higher education more accessible to the province's students. At least two students from every county in the region were sent to France, where they participated in work-study programs. Chen himself paid for more than 80 students to study abroad, including some future leaders of the Chinese Communist Party, such as the future Trotskyist leader Zheng Chaolin. The French study program was enthusiastically supported by Nationalist intellectual Wang Jingwei, who, in a speech to a teachers' college in Zhangzhou, proposed the creation of a university in southern China. Chen himself requested funds from the council in Guangdong for such a project, looking at possible construction sites and calling for officials to be appointed to oversee the project.\nChen Jiongming actively recruited talents nationwide, including a group of \"liberal socialists\" (followers of Chinese anarchist Liu Shifu), to assist him in educational efforts and the establishment of the university. The administration also set up study centers and education commissioners in each county, reforming old textbooks. They established modern schools in rural areas, aiming for \"one school per village,\" banning private schools and setting up normal schools, general high schools, vocational schools, night schools for commoners, and women's home economics training institutes. In 1920, they also established women's normal training institutes and women's vocational schools, setting up more than 90 night schools in the same year.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nChen, Leslie H.

There it is adorned with the only example in the Valle di Comino of a diamond-point rusticated portal, a valuable artistic element.\nTwo dovecote towers enrich the architectural complex and make it immediately recognizable in the city's urban system: the west tower is structured in three orders and, in the upper two, it features loopholes decorated with protruding corbels.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nRecchia A.P., La Val di Comino, in «Storia della città: rivista internazionale di storia urbana e territoriale», n° 23, 1982, p. 90–91.",

What if we put ourselves in their shoes and saw their state of victimhood?\". A common theme of the album is gun violence with songs such as XXL entirely focusing on the topic. In the album, Wakadinali frequently hint that gun violence is not always originating from the gangsters, but rather from police officers.

        "content": "On 10 May 2024, the Russian Armed Forces began an offensive operation in Ukraine's Kharkiv Oblast, shelling and attempting to breach the defenses of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the direction of Vovchansk.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nIn the first months of their invasion, the Russian Armed Forces managed to conquer large parts of northeastern Kharkiv Oblast, including the towns of Kupiansk, Izium, Shevchenkove, and Balakliia. Following a counteroffensive in September 2022, Ukrainian forces were able to recapture these settlements and push Russian forces out of almost the entire oblast.\nDuring the first months of 2024, reports appeared that the Russian army was rebuilding its forces in the north to launch a new offensive in the direction of Kharkiv later that year. Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov had also repeatedly threatened to attack Kharkiv Oblast and establish a buffer zone to protect Russia's Belgorod Oblast in response to cross-border attacks by Ukraine. On 8 May 2024, the governor of Kharkiv Oblast, Oleh Syniehubov, reported a large gathering of Russian forces north of the region.\n\n\n== Timeline ==\n\n\n=== 10 May ===\nAccording to the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Russian forces shelled positions with guided bombs in the direction of Vovchansk during the day and added artillery fire at night. An attempt to break through the front line was recorded at 5:00 am on 10 May. Up to 4–5 Russian infantry battalions from a newly created force crossed the state border, reportedly capturing the villages of Krasne, Borysivka, Strilecha, and Pylna. Vovchansk came under heavy artillery fire overnight, which continued the following day. Ukraine's armed forces urged residents of northern Kharkiv Oblast to evacuate.\nAccording to Ukrainian military journalist Yuri Butusov, the captured border area had been a \"gray zone\" behind the Ukrainian defensive line with no Ukrainian military presence, with the exception of Strilecha. Syniehubov also referred to the affected villages as a \"gray zone\", claiming that \"the Ukrainian armed forces have not lost a single meter\". According to DeepStateMap.Live analysts, citing confidential sources, Russian forces had occupied the village of Pylna several days before 10 May, but poor communication within the Ukrainian military had prevented any action from being taken.\nLater in the afternoon, reserve units were sent to Kharkiv Oblast to hold the front line, according to the Ukrainian Defense Ministry.\nUkrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that artillery has so far been able to repel the Russian offensive in Kharkiv Oblast and that Russia may pull more reserves to support the offensive but Ukraine’s armed forces are ready to resist them.\nLater that day a senior Ukrainian commander said that Russian forces had pushed Ukrainian forces back by one kilometer from the Russian-Ukrainian border and were aiming to advance 10 kilometers into Ukraine. The border city of Vovchansk was subjected to \"massive shelling\" and residents were being evacuated.\nFighting was also reported in the villages of Pletenivka, Hatyshche, Hoptivka, Morokhovets, Oliinykove and Ohirtseve. Russian bloggers claimed that Pletenivka, Hatyshche, Ohirtseve and Zelene had come under Russian control, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), which was unable to verify the claims. Ukraine's 42nd Mechanized Brigade published footage of its \"Perun\" unit destroying four Russian BMP infantry fighting vehicles in the area of Pylna using combat drones, claiming to have inflicted several casualties.\nA member of the Ukrainian partisan movement Atesh allegedly serving in the Russian military claimed that parts of his unit, a motorised rifle battalion of the 44th Army Corps, refused to participate in the assault on Kharkiv Oblast, owing to the failure of previous sabotage and reconnaissance and the strength of Ukrainian fortifications.\nBy 10 May, Russian forces, according to the ISW, had seized around “35 square miles of territory”, although Ukrainian forces claimed to have pushed Russian forces back.\n\n\n=== 11 May ===\nThe Ukrainians claimed to have destroyed 20 Russian units of armored equipment during the previous day’s offensive. Nazar Voloshyn, spokesman of Ukraine's Khortytsia operational-strategic group, claimed that the Russians were contained in the \"gray zone\" and that the offensive had effectively been repelled.\nAccording to the ISW, geolocated footage published on 11 May indicated that Morokhovets, Oliinykove and Ohirtseve had come under Russian control. Russian military bloggers claimed that Russian forces had also captured the villages of Hoptivka, Kudiivka and Tykhe, and were trying to advance into Vovchansk, though the think tank said it had not observed evidence to verify these claims. The Russian defence ministry claimed in a briefing that its forces had taken five villages: Strilecha, Pylna, Borysivka, Ohirtseve and Pletenivka.\n\n\n=== 12 May ===\nThe Russian Ministry of Defence claimed that its forces had captured the villages of Hatyshche, Krasne, Morokhovets and Oliinykove.\nCommander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Oleksandr Syrskyi wrote on Telegram that the situation in Kharkiv Oblast had \"significantly worsened\". Amid claims by Russian and Ukrainian sources of combat within Vovchansk, ISW assessed that Hatyshche, Pletenivka and Tykhe had come under Russian control.\n\n\n=== 13 May ===\nUkrainian outlets Rubryka and Ukrainska Pravda reported that the DeepState map indicated that Russian forces had taken control over the village of Zelene, while the village of Lukiantsi was almost wholly occupied. Russian forces subsequently claimed to have entered Vovchansk.\nUkrainian forces claimed to have killed over 100 Russian soldiers in the last 24 hours in northern Kharkiv Oblast. Some five Russian battalions were involved in Vovchansk. Ukrainian officials acknowledged that Russian forces had made \"tactical gains\" and that Ukrainian forces appeared to be avoiding direct engagements with Russian forces. The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said on Facebook that its forces were \"conducting defensive operations, inflicting fire damage on the enemy, widely using unmanned systems for reconnaissance and launching pinpoint strikes to inflict maximum damage\" adding that reserves were being deployed to \"stabilize the situation.\"\n\n\n== Reaction ==\nDavid Axe, a military correspondent for Forbes, suggested that the offensive might be \"an elaborate feint\" whose main goal was to pull Ukrainian resources away from Chasiv Yar and the area of Avdiivka.\n\n\n== Impact ==\nAs of 13 May 2024, nearly 6,000 residents have been evacuated from areas of Kharkiv Oblast affected by the fighting, particularly in Kharkiv, Bohodukhiv and Chuhuiv raions.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of military engagements during the Russian invasion of Ukraine\nBattle of Balakliia\nBattle of Kupiansk\n2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive\nBattle of Chasiv Yar\nBattle of Krasnohorivka\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Notes ==",

        "content": "Trish Kerin is an Australian safety expert, engineer, Director of IChemE, science communicator, and one of the Science Technology Australia, Superstars of STEM 2023-2024 cohort.\n\n\n== Education ==\nKerin graduated with honours in mechanical engineering at RMIT in 1994. Following graduation, Kerin worked for several years in project management, operational and safety roles for the gas, chemical and oil industries.\n\n\n== Career ==\nKerin has been a board member for the Australian National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority. She is a Chartered Engineer, registered Professional Process Safety Engineer, as well as a Fellow of IChemE, Engineers Australia and a senior member of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers. Kerin also holds a diploma in OHS, as well as a Master of Leadership and is a Graduate of the Australian Institute of Company Directors.\nKerin is the director of the IChemE Safety Centre, and leads a team who help organisations share and learn in process safety. Kerin uses her engineering experience and leadership to help organisations improve process safety outcomes.\n\nKerin's work involves safety and risk minimisation in the workplace. She commented, in The Chemical Engineer publication,“People have a right to stay safe, no matter where they are. As chemical engineers address our global challenges and pivot our technologies to deliver a low-carbon future, all those engaged in process safety will be a crucial component in minimising the risk of operating in new fields.”\n\n\n== Publications ==\nKerin is the author of two books, \"The Platypus Philosophy\", on how to identify and manage weak signals, in safety processing. The second book is \"Lets talk about your leadership\", learning through the art of storytelling.\nSelect peer-reviewed publications include:\nKerin, T. (2016) The evolution of process safety standards and legislation following landmark events—what have we learnt? Process Safety Progress 35 (2), 165–170–17.\nKerin, T. (2018) Accounting for hindsight bias: improving learning through interactive case studies. Loss Prevention Bulletin. 264: 17.\nKerin, T. (2020) Taming the wild river rapids: How process safety can apply outside the process industries. Process safety progress 39 (1), e12088.\n\n\n== Media ==\nKerin was interviewed for Occham's Razor, on the ABC, about chemical safety and improving safety processes, with Tegan Taylor. They discussed how \"everyone has a right to be safe at work\", and Kerin shared a creative way to encourage spotting warning signs early, saving mistakes ahead of time.\nKerin also hosts a podcast with Endeavour Business Media's Chemical Processing Magazine called \"Process Safety with Trish and Traci\", as well as regular column called \"Stay Safe\".\n\n\n== Awards ==\n2023-2024 - Science Technology Australia, Superstars of STEM.\n2022 - ASBPE Bronze Award.\n2022 - Leader of the Year award from Women in Safety in 2022.\n2018 - Mary Kay O'Connor Process Safety Centre Trevor Kletz Merit award.\n\n\n== External links ==\nMeet the 60 women named Superstars of STEM in 2022 – Women's Agenda article\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "NGC 7609 or known as Arp 150 and HCG 95A, is a large elliptical galaxy located in Pegasus. Its speed relative to the cosmic microwave background is 11,879 km/s, which corresponds the galaxy to be located 554 million light-years away from Earth (169.7 Mpc). NGC 7609 was discovered on October 5, 1864, by Albert Marth and included in Halton Arp's, Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies in galaxies that produces jets. \nWith a surface brightness of apparent magnitude 14.59, NGC 7609 is classified as a low surface brightness galaxy (LSB). LSB galaxies are diffuse galaxies with surface brightness that is one less magnitude, of the night sky. \n\n\n== A pair of interacting galaxies ==\nA SDSS survey image and from the Hubble Space Telescope, showed that NGC 7609 is interacting with nearby galaxy, PGC 71077 (HCG 95C) whose spiral arms is currently being absorbed by the larger entity. A double-nuclei is present in HCG 95C, which is considered a merger remanent of two disk galaxies. Two tidal tails are also found in NGC 7609 and HCG 95C region, which seems to connect together, and there is a linear bridge between two galaxies indicating nuclear activity is taking place in HCG 95C. From the study written from Vilchez & Iglesias-Paramo in 1998, Hα emission is detected in the nuclei of both galaxies and also the larger tidal tails (the eastern tail).\nA long slit spectra of NGC 7609 shows, it exhibits red-shifted H-alpha +[N II] and [S II] emission lines that is indicative to a LINER-type AGN (Active Galactic Nucleus). \n\nFrom the spatial profiles, this indicate non-nuclear starburst activity triggered by tidal forces while nuclear spectrum indicates non thermal activity. From the further IUE observations of HCG 95C, it presents a featureless continuum with transient outburst captured in one observation, showing galactic emission  of red-shifted N v (1240 A) and C IV (1550 A). This result depicts HCG 95C is in the early stages of merging with NGC 7609. \nAccording to another study, it is suggested that a dwarf galaxy might have been created at the tip of the northern tidal tails.\n\n\n== Hickson 95 group ==\nNGC 7609 is a member of Hickson Compact Group 95. There are total of four galaxies in the group, in which the members are PGC 71074, PGC 71077 and PGC 71080. Of all the four galaxies, PGC 71080 (HCG 95B) is a foreground galaxy, as its line-of-sight velocity of 8000 km/s significantly differs from the velocity of the other members per published by Hickson et al. \n\n\n== Prescence of ultra-diffuse galaxies around HCG 95 ==\nA study mentions there is a detection of 89 candidate ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs), around NGC 7609 and HCG 95, in which one is linked with. It is a gas-rich galaxy with H i mass 1.1 x 10 M⊙, detected by Very Large Array, and has a stellar mass of M 1.8 x 10 M⊙. This indicates that UDGs partially overlap with population of nearly dark galaxies found in deep H I surveys. The results show high abundance of blue UDGs in the HCG 95 field is favored by the poor galaxy cluster environment residing in H I-rich large-scale structures.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Edward Mortimer-Rose,  (1920 – 28 January 1943) was a flying ace who served in the Royal Air Force (RAF) during the Second World War. During his service with the RAF, he was credited with having destroyed at least thirteen German aircraft.\nBorn in Littleport, Mortimer-Rose joined the RAF in early 1939. Once his training was completed, he was posted to No. 234 Squadron. He flew in the Battle of Britain and the Circus offensive of 1941, during which he claimed a number of aerial victories. He was sent to Malta in December 1941 and took command of No. 249 Squadron during the siege of that island. He was wounded towards the end of the month and spent several weeks in hospital before returning to duty in February 1942 as commander of No. 185 Squadron. Rested from operations in May, he later served with No. 111 Squadron in the Tunisian campaign. He was killed in a flying accident when his Supermarine Spitfire fighter collided with another aircraft while taking off from an airfield in Tunisia.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nEdward Mortimer-Rose was born in 1920 at Littleport in Cambridgeshire, the United Kingdom. He attended Haileybury School and once his education was completed, he joined the Royal Air Force on a short-service commission. He commenced his initial training in February 1939 before proceeding to No. 6 Flying Training School at Little Rissington two months later as an acting pilot officer. His flight training was completed in November, by which time the Second World War had broken out.\n\n\n== Second World War ==\nMortimer-Rose was posted to No. 234 Squadron on 6 November. This was a newly formed fighter squadron based at Leconfield and working towards operational status with Bristol Blenheim heavy fighters. In March 1940, it began to re-equip with the Supermarine Spitfire fighter and two months later became operational, by which time it was based at Church Fenton. The following month the squadron moved to St. Eval as part of No. 10 Group, and then onto Middle Wallop. It subsequently became drawn into Fighter Command's efforts to defend against the Luftwaffe campaign against southern England. \n\n\n=== Battle of Britain ===\nMortimer-Rose made his first claim for an aerial victory on 8 August, for a share in a Junkers Ju 88 medium bomber that was probably destroyed in the region of Falmouth. A week later he shot down a Messerschmitt Bf 110 heavy fighter to the southwest of Swanage. In the afternoon of 18 August, what is now known as The Hardest Day, No. 234 Squadron was scrambled to intercept a Luftwaffe raid on Gosport. Mortimer-Rose destroyed a Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter that was escorting Junkers Ju 87 dive bombers attacking Gosport. He engaged a second Bf 109 but ran out of ammunition; this Bf 109 was deemed to have been probably destroyed. \nOn 26 August Mortimer-Rose destroyed a Bf 109 to the south of the Isle of Wight. The squadron's losses by this time saw it withdrawn back to St. Eval from where it saw out the final weeks of the Battle of Britain at a lowered operational tempo, with fewer sorties. Flying from here on 9 October, he shared in the probable destruction of a Ju 88 south of Falmouth. Another Ju 88 was claimed as probably destroyed by Mortimer-Rose over Land's End on 26 October. He shared in the shooting down of a Dornier Do 17 medium bomber near St. Eval on 24 November. He damaged another Do 17 on 20 December to the south of Land's End and on Christmas Day he damaged a Ju 88 near Falmouth.\n\n\n=== Circus offensive ===\nMortimer-Rose damaged a Ju 88 near St. Eval on 11 February 1941. Later in the month No. 234 Squadron moved to Warmwell, where it began to re-equip with the Spitfire Mk IIa and changed duties; while it still carried out defensive patrols, it also started to undertake offensive operations over occupied France and Belgium as part of the RAF's Circus offensive. On 11 March, some 20 miles (32 km) to the southwest of Portland, Mortimer-Rose shared in the destruction of a Bf 110. A few days later, he was mentioned in despatches in March.\nOn 23 March Mortimer-Rose shared in damaging a Do 17 over the Isle of Wight. Early the following month, on 2 April, he probably destroyed a Ju 88 to the southwest of Lyme Regis. He damaged a Do 17 near Portland on 8 May. Shortly afterwards the squadron began to receive new Spitfire Mk Vbs and flying one of these on 19 May, Mortimer-Rose destroyed a pair of Bf 109s over the English Channel. His successes over the previous several months was recognised with an award of a Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) in early June. The published citation read:\n\nhis officer has displayed great skill as a fighter pilot. In a recent combat he destroyed two of five enemy aircraft destroyed by his flight thus bringing his victories to at least six. He has set a splendid example and has contributed materially to the high standard of efficiency in his squadron.\nOn 17 June Mortimer-Rose shared in the destruction of a Bf 109 near Cherbourg. The following month, on 14 July, he destroyed one Bf 109 and damaged a second, also in the vicinity of Cherbourg. He damaged a pair of Bf 109s off Le Havre on 15 October.\n\n\n=== Siege of Malta ===\nIn November Mortimer-Rose was posted to the Middle East and soon after his arrival in Egypt, was sent to Malta as an acting squadron leader to assume command of No. 249 Squadron. This was based at Ta Kali and operated Hawker Hurricane fighters, defending the island from the bombing raids mounted by the air forces of Germany and Italy. A few days after his arrival on Malta on 6 December, he was awarded a Bar to his DFC. The published citation read:\n\nThis officer is a relentless and inspiring fighter pilot. He has participated in every operational sortie undertaken by his squadron and, many times, has carried out individual attacks in enemy occupied country with great success. Flight Lieutenant Mortimer-Rose has destroyed at least 7 and damaged a further 9 enemy aircraft.\nHe made his first claim with his new unit on 19 December, when he destroyed a Ju 88 over Malta. He shared in the destruction of another Ju 88 on 24 December. The day after Christmas, he was wounded in an engagement and crash landed his Hurricane on the airstrip at Luqa. His wounds, to his feet, required hospitalisation and it was not until late February 1942 that he returned to duty as commander of No. 185 Squadron. This was another Hurricane-equipped unit on Malta, based at Hal Far. He destroyed a pair of Bf 110s over the island on 21 March and this was followed two days later with shares in three damaged Ju 88s. The next day he was injured when the airfield at Hal Far was bombed. In May he was taken off operations.\nIn January 1943, Mortimer-Rose, having reverted to his substantive rank of flight lieutenant, was posted to No. 111 Squadron as one of its flight commanders. The squadron was serving in the Tunisian campaign at the time of his arrival. On 28 January he was involved in a collision with another Spitfire when taking off from Souk-el-Khemis Airfield. While the other pilot, Wing Commander George Gilroy, was slightly injured and successfully bailed out, Mortimer-Rose was killed.\n\nHis remains were interred at the Medjez-El-Bab War Cemetery in Tunisia. He is credited with the destruction of at least thirteen aircraft, four of which shared with other pilots. He is also credited with three aircraft probably destroyed, and shares in a further two probables. Additionally, he damaged eleven aircraft although six of these were shared.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nPrice, Alfred (1988) [1979]. Battle of Britain: The Hardest Day, 18 August.

        "content": "SS Skirmisher was a steel tugboat and passenger tender of the Cunard Line built in 1884 for service in the Mersey at Liverpool. She was used in this role through the Cunard-White Star merger until 1941. She was sold for scrap in 1947.\n\n\n== Career ==\nSkirmisher was constructed in 1884 to act as a tender and part time tugboat for the new RMS Umbria and RMS Etruria, which were too big to enter the landing stage in the Mersey at lower tides. Skirmisher was to carry passengers from the docks to these ships. Her machinery was a single ended boiler originally with six furnaces, replaced in 1908 with two boilers. Her engines produced 1,104HP, giving her an average speed of 13 knots.\nIn July 1886, the builder's model of the Skirmisher was up for display at Liverpool, as well as other Cunard vessels. In May 1894, she acted as an escort to Queen Victoria's yacht. She also sailed to Spithead for the 1897 Spithead Naval Review, where she acted as a tender exclusively to the RMS Campania. By 1902, she had permanently replaced the old Satellite as a Liverpool tender.\nDuring the ship's 1908 refit, an extra deck was added, her funnel was heightened, and her old boiler was replaced with 2 slightly smaller but more efficient ones. With this extra deck, it was easier for her to tend to the massive new RMS Mauretania and RMS Lusitania. She continued service in this configuration until 1941.\nIn April 1913, the Skirmisher steamed to the Clyde, to witness the launch of the RMS Aquitania. In 1917, Skirmisher was berthed across the Gladstone Dock gate, to protect the dock from being torpedoed by U-boats. From 1922 until 1923, she was used as a tender on the river Clyde as part of the Cunard-Anchor Line joint service.\n\n\n== War Service ==\nDuring the May Blitz in 1941, the SS Malakand was docked in Liverpool nearby the Skirmisher. When Makaland exploded, the bridge on the Skirmisher was completely destroyed by flying debris, and the mast pierced Skirmisher's hull, and quickly sank. She was refloated, and converted into a fireboat, where she could pump 100 tons of water per hour. In 1944, she visited Fishguard to serve the RMS Queen Mary, with Winston Churchill on board. Due to bad weather, the Queen Mary diverted to the Clyde, and Skirmisher returned to the Mersey.\nShe was withdrawn from service in October 1945, and her upper superstructure and remaining fittings were stripped. She was towed to Garston in March, 1947 where her hull was broken up for scrap.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Happy Birthday, Ratboy is a 2021 studio album by American indie rock band Ratboys. The surprise album is a re-recording of the band's earliest material and has received positive reviews from critics.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nEditors at Pitchfork Media scored this release 7.2 out of 10 and critic Pete Tosiello stated that this album contrasts \"cozy nostalgia with hard-rocking instincts\", with a more \"somber and reflective\" tone than 2020's Printer's Devil. Mark Moody of Under the Radar scored this album a 7 out of 10, stating that \"the addition of a permanent rhythm section in Marcus Nuccio (drums) and Sean Neumann (bass), the decade old songs are brought to fuller frame\" and praised several tracks, noting album closer \"Go Outside\" as a highlight. \"Go Outside\" was also recognized as one of the best songs of the week at Paste, where Carli Scolforo considered the title good advice to listeners during the COVID-19 pandemic which also marked a change in the band's sound to a country music influence and the album release was included on a short list of best albums of the week as well.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"The Stanza\" – 3:29\n\"Down the River\" – 2:34\n\"Intense Judgment\" – 5:04\n\"Key\" – 3:37\n\"At 39 Is Annie the Oldest Cat?\" – 4:17\n\"Space Blows\" – 1:46\n\"Collected\" – 4:16\n\"Cacao to Cacao\" – 2:17\n\"Have a Heart\" – 3:36\n\"88 Fingers Edward\" – 3:46\n\"Go Outside\" – 2:49\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nRatboys\n\nSean Neumann – bass guitar, production\nMarcus Nuccio – drums, percussion, production\nDavid Sagan – guitar, pocket piano, ukulele, lap steel guitar, production\nJulia Steiner – vocals, guitar, production\nAdditional personnel\n\nJason Cupp – mixing\nJohnny Fabrizio – photography\nLizzy Jordan – cello on \"Have a Heart\"\nMallory Linehan – violin on \"Have a Heart\"\nEvan Loritsch – Rhodes piano on \"Key\"\nPat Lyons – pedal steel guitar on \"Go Outside\"\nSam Porter – photography\nKim Rosen – audio mastering\n\n\n== See also ==\n2021 in American music\nList of 2021 albums\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHappy Birthday, Ratboy at Discogs (list of releases) \nHappy Birthday, Ratboy at MusicBrainz (list of releases) \nA Guide to Ratboys’ Happy Birthday, Ratboy from Talkhouse",

He was Professor of Greek at Stanford University for forty years.\n\n\n== Life ==\nAugustus Taber Murray was born in Manhattan on October 29, 1866. He graduated A.B. from Haverford College in 1885 and Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University (with a dissertation on Aristophanes) in 1890, before undertaking further studies at Leipzig and Berlin.\nHe was Professor of Greek successively at Earlham College, from 1888 to 1890; Colorado College, from 1891 to 1892; and Stanford University, from 1892 to 1932. For the nascent Loeb Classical Library he translated the Odyssey (2 vols., 1919), the Iliad (2 vols., 1924), and the Private Orations of Demosthenes (4 vols., 1936–1939).\nMurray was a prominent Quaker, and in 1929 and 1930, having obtained leave from Stanford, he resided in Washington as pastor to President Hoover, his personal friend. \nMurray died at Palo Alto, California on March 8, 1940. An able athlete and tennis enthusiast, Murray was the father of U.S. tennis champion Robert Lindley Murray and Olympic athlete turned cartoonist Frederick (\"Feg\") Murray.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Murray, A.

        "content": "The Attico is a Milan-based fashion label founded in 2016 by designers and creative directors Gilda Ambrosio and Giorgia Tordini.\nThe label has partnered with Nike Air Jordan, Sant Ambroeus, Eres, Linda Farrow, and Re/Done. It is distributed worldwide with over 200 top retailers, boutiques, and concept stores.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Attico was launched in 2016 by two fashion designers – Giorgia Tordini and Gilda Ambrosio. The Attico is the Italian word for \"penthouse.\" Initially, the designers launched the line around luxury dressing gowns and going-out attire.\nFollowing the label's debut, The Attico founders were profiled in American Vogue's May 2016 and 2017 issues. In 2017, the designers were awarded \"Launch of the Year\" at the 31st annual Footwear News Achievement Awards in New York City and listed as part of The BOF 500, a professional index of people shaping the fashion industry.\nIn 2018, Archive, an investment firm controlled by ou(R) group (Remo Ruffini's family holding), acquired 49% of the brand. The acquisition led to a shifting of brand strategy and overall company restructuring.\nIn 2019, Giorgia Tordini moved back to Milan to officially launch The Attico with Gilda Ambrosio during Milan Fashion Week. Also in 2019, The Attico founders were honored with \"The Young Business Award\" by the Altagamma Foundation, an institution supporting emerging companies within the Italian cultural and creative industry.\nThe Attico launched pop-up shops and installations at luxury retailers such as Harrods, Selfridges, The Webster, Bergdorf, Beymen, La Rinascente, and Level Shoes. In September 2022, during New York Fashion Week, The Attico launched its first pop-up retail concept in New York.\nWithin the 2022 Salone Mobile fair, The Attico launched a design exhibition with the New York-based gallery Superhouse to host its semi-annual exhibition in Milan, Italy.\nIn September 2023, The Attico hosted its first fashion show during Milan Fashion Week.\nThe Attico received attention from fashion magazines, retail stores, and celebrities. It has been worn by Dua Lipa, Beyonce, Rhianna, Kylie Jenner, Hailey Bieber, and more. Initially launched around luxury dressing gowns and going-out attire, the label included ready-to-wear offering, shoes, bags, beachwear, and leisurewear.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nThe 5 pieces a woman should always have in her wardrobe according to the coolest Italians in fashion Vogue France\nGiorgia Tordini and Gilda Ambrosio Reveal their Insider's Guide to Milan, from the Best Stores to the Coziest Restaurant for Date Night  W (magazine)\nAround the world with Gilda and Giorgia's\nForbes 30 under 30",

        "content": "The Karakengir (Kazakh: Қаракеңгір; Russian: Кара-Кенгир), also known as Kengir, is a river in the Ulytau District, Ulytau Region, Kazakhstan. It has a length of 295 km (183 mi) and a drainage basin of 18,400 km2 (7,100 sq mi).\nIt is one of the most important tributaries of the Sarysu. The city of Zhezkazgan, the capital of Ulytau Region, is located by its banks. A reservoir was built close to the city at the time of the Kazakh SSR \n\n\n== Course ==\nThe Karakengir river originates in the Zhaksy Arganaty massif of the Ulytau, Kazakh Uplands. Its source is in a spring near Barakkol lake. It heads first southeastwards, then midway through its course it bends slightly southwestwards. In its last stretch it bends again and heads roughly southwards through a floodplain. Finally it joins the right bank of the Sarysu 50 km (31 mi) to the south of Zhezkazgan.\nThe river valley is between 0.3 km (0.19 mi) and 0.5 km (0.31 mi) wide and its channel is bound by steep banks with up to 80 m (260 ft) high cliffs in some stretches. The river is fed by snow and its level is at its highest in April. By the summer the Karakengir stops flowing and splits into disconnected pools. The main tributaries are the 143 km (89 mi) long Sarykengir, the 100 km (62 mi) long Zhylandy, and the 91 km (57 mi) long Zhezdi.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of rivers of Kazakhstan\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Karakengir at Wikimedia Commons\nThe Great Silk Road in Central and Eastern Kazakhstan",

        "content": "Lori Bara (born Lori De Coppet Bara Goodman; October 30, 1897 – August 4, 1965), also known as Esther Goodman, was an American screenwriter, director, and silent film actress. She is best known for writing the screenplays of The Soul of Buddha (1918) and Samarang (1933) which also she directed along with Ward Wing, her then-husband.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBara was born Lori De Coppet Bara Goodman on October 30, 1897, in Avondale, Cincinnati, as the youngest child of Pauline Louise Françoise De Coppet and Bernard Berek Goodman. She had a brother, Mark J.N. Goodman, and a sister, Theda Bara.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nBara married Francis William Getty in London, England, on July 20, 1920, but the marriage was later. On July 6, 1925, Bara moved into a two-bedroom apartment in Los Angeles, California, with actress Nola Luxford. She later married Ward Wing, a writer, in Mexico, on November 23, 1927. In 1930, Bara resided in Beverly Hills, California. She divorced Wing in 1935.\n\n\n== Career ==\nBara started her career by working as an actress along with Nola Luxford. She then appeared in a few films as an extra and in bit parts before turning down her acting career to became a writer. Bara later explained the reason for turning down her acting career in an interview: \"I never really wanted to act and never liked it, because you've always got to be thinking of how you look.\" She made her writing debut with the screenplay for The Soul of Buddha (1918) which starred her sister, Theda Bara. Bara later appeared in Buster Keaton's comedy Seven Chances (1925). She made her last film appearance in George Hill's Tell It to the Marines (1926), which starred Lon Chaney, playing a Navy nurse.\nIn 1931, Bara began to work as a screenwriter at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. In 1933, she traveled with her husband to British Malaya and resided there for six months while they filmed Samarang (1933), a romance film with all native cast, in which Bara was screenwriter and director. She then wrote the screenplay for Tea Leaves in the Wind (1938). Her last screenplay was The Shark Women (1941), a documentary film about Malaysian pearl divers.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n== Death ==\nBara suffered from cardiovascular disease and was hospitalized at Marycrest Manor in Culver City, Los Angeles. She died there on August 4, 1965, at the age of 67 and was buried at Holy Cross Cemetery.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== General and cited sources ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nLori Bara at IMDb",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Data-driven astronomy (DDA) refers to the use of data science in astronomy. Several outputs of telescopic observations and sky surveys are taken into consideration and approaches related to data mining and big data management are used to analyze, filter, and normalize the data set that are further used for making Classifications, Predictions, and Anomaly detections by advanced Statistical approaches, digital image processing and machine learning. The output of these processes is used by astronomers and space scientists to study and identify patterns, anomalies, and movements in outer space and conclude theories and discoveries in the cosmos.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2007, the Galaxy Zoo project was launched for morphological classification of a large number of galaxies. In this project, 900,000 images were considered for classification that were taken from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) for the past 7 years. The task was to study each picture of a galaxy, classify it as elliptical or spiral, and determine whether it was spinning or not. The team of Astrophysicists led by Kevin Schawinski in Oxford University were in charge of this project and Kevin and his colleague Chris Linlott figured out that it would take a period of 3–5 years for such a team to complete the work. There they came up with the idea of using Machine Learning and Data Science techniques for analyzing the images and classifying them.\n\n\n== Methodology ==\nThe data retrieved from the sky surveys are first brought for data preprocessing. In this, redundancies are removed and filtrated. Further, feature extraction is performed on this filtered data set, which is further taken for processes. Some of the renowned sky surveys are listed below:\n\nThe Palomar Digital Sky Survey (DPOSS)\nThe Two-Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS)\nGreen Bank Telescope (GBT)\nThe Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX)\nThe Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)\nSkyMapper Southern Sky Survey (SMSS)\nThe Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (PanSTARRS)\nThe Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST)\nThe Square Kilometer Array (SKA)\nThe size of data from the above-mentioned sky surveys ranges from 3 TB to almost 4.6 EB. Further, data mining tasks that are involved in the management and manipulation of the data involve methods like classification, regression, clustering, anomaly detection, and time-series analysis. Several approaches and applications for each of these methods are involved in the task accomplishments.\n\n\n=== Classification ===\nClassification is used for specific identifications and categorizations of astronomical data such as Spectral classification, Photometric classification, Morphological classification, and classification of solar activity. The approaches of classification techniques are listed below:\n\nArtificial neural network (ANN)\nSupport vector machine (SVM)\nLearning vector quantization (LVQ)\nDecision tree\nRandom forest\nk-nearest neighbors\nNaïve Bayesian networks\nRadial basis function network\nGaussian process\nDecision table\nAlternating decision tree (ADTree)\n\n\n=== Regression ===\nRegression is used to make predictions based on the retrieved data through statistical trends and statistical modeling. Different uses of this technique are used for fetching Photometric redshifts and measurements of physical parameters of stars. The approaches are listed below:\n\nArtificial neural network (ANN)\nSupport vector regression (SVR)\nDecision tree\nRandom forest\nk-nearest neighbors regression\nKernel regression\nPrincipal component regression (PCR)\nGaussian process\nLeast squared regression (LSR)\nPartial least squares regression\n\n\n=== Clustering ===\nClustering is classifying objects based on a similarity measure metric. It is used in Astronomy for Classification as well as Special/rare object detection. The approaches are listed below:\n\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA)\nDBSCAN\nk-means clustering\nOPTICS\nCobweb model\nSelf-organizing map (SOM)\nExpectation Maximization\nHierarchical Clustering\nAutoClass\nGaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM)\n\n\n=== Anomaly detection ===\nAnomaly detection is used for detecting irregularities in the dataset. However, this technique is used here to detect rare/special objects. The following approaches are used:\n\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA)\nk-means clustering\nExpectation Maximization\nHierarchical clustering\nOne-class SVM\n\n\n=== Time-series analysis ===\nTime-Series analysis helps in analyzing trends and predicting outputs over time. It is used for trend prediction and novel detection (detection of unknown data). The approaches used here are:\n\nArtificial neural network (ANN)\nSupport vector regression (SVR)\nDecision tree\n\n\n== References ==",

The latest survivor was rescued on Friday 10 May after 118 hours trapped under the rubble.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn August 2020, Erf 15098 was sold for R 2.07 million to Pacific Breeze Trading 91. In March 2021, the owners of the land applied for amendments to the building; an increase from 4 to 5 storeys and inclusion of 66 parking bays in an underground basement parking lot. The developer, Neo Trend Group Ice Projects, submitted its final plans in December 2022; it had been approved in July 2023. On 14 March 2024, plans for the building were signed off for.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNeo Victoria Apartments website",

        "content": "PDBY (previously known as Perdeby, Die Perdeby, and Die Nuwe Perdeby) is the official independent student newspaper of the University of Pretoria. The newspaper was established in 1939 and serves as a development programme for students interested in journalism. It is distributed digitally and in hard copy on the campuses of the university. In 2024, the newspaper had bi-weekly publications with a readership of 20 000.\n\n\n== Content ==\nThe newspaper contains four sections: news, features, entertainment and sport.\n\n\n== Structure ==\nThe newspaper is managed by the Editor-in-Chief, who is also a permanent staff member of the university. The remainder of the editorial are students, serving in content as well as layout, copy, multimedia, and web sections.\n\n\n== Transformation ==\nUntil 2013, the newspaper was bilingual, publishing content in English and Afrikaans. The newspaper moved to English only content in an attempt to broaden its readership in line with the changing demographic of the university student body. In 2018, the newspaper changed its name from the Afrikaans word \"perdeby\", meaning wasp, to PDBY, an acronym for Print, Digital, and Broadcast Youth media in another attempt to align to the current student demographic.\n\n\n== Previous Editors and Editors-in-Chief ==\n\n\n=== Editors-in-Chief ===\n2008-present: Carel Willemse\n\n\n=== Editors ===\n2024: Kirsten Minaar\n2023: Katherine Weber\n2022: Leah Rees\n2021: Kayla Thomas\n2020: Kayla Thomas\n2019: Shaun Sproule\n2018: Shaun Sproule\n2017: Huvasan Reddy\n2016: Michal-Maré Linden\n2015: Michal-Maré Linden\n2014: Maxine Twaddle\n2013: Margeaux Erasmus\n2012: Beyers de Vos\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of newspapers in South Africa\nTuks FM\n\n\n== References ==",

It is located south of Ōsakikamijima (Upper Osaki Island) and southwest of Okamura Island.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nWith the development of the Western Circuit (西廻り航路, nishimawari kōro) shipping route through the Seto Inland Sea in the Edo period, the town of Mitarai (御手洗) grew as a port for ships waiting for rising tide or favourable winds.  The Wakaebisuya chaya, the largest in the Inland Sea, employed over 100 women, and in The Inland Sea, Donald Richie states that the daimyo of Kumamoto once spent a thousand gold pieces in one night there.\nToday, the town includes gabled houses with sangawarabuki roofs and is dotted with Western style houses. The port area retains its historical character with groynes, stepped piers and a lighthouse, and is gazetted as an Important Preservation District for Groups of Traditional Buildings.\nMost of Ōsakishimojima was formerly covered by the town of Yutaka, with a small portion on the west coast in Toyohama.  On March 20, 2005, both Yutaka and Toyohama, along with the towns of Ondo, Kurahashi and Kamagari (all from Aki District) and Yasuura (from Toyota District), were merged into the expanded city of Kure.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nŌsakishimojima is linked by the Akinada Island Connecting Bridges westwards to Toyoshima Island and onward to the mainland of Honshu near the city of Kure, Hiroshima, as well as eastwards to Okamura Island, the current terminus of the bridges.\nFerry services are also available to Ōsakikamijima.  There have been plans since 1972 to replace this with a bridge, or alternatively build one to Ōmishima Island, but none have come to fruition.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Abraham Peter Carl Siebel (13 January 1836 – 9 May 1868) was a German merchant, poet, and friend of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. His pseudonyms were Emil Thilva and Julius Morton.\n\n\n== Life ==\nBorn Abraham Peter Carl Siebel, in Barmen, Germany, he was the son of the lace manufacturer Karl August Siebel (1805 – 1888) and Emilia (Emilie) Kampermann (1812 – 1878). After being tutored by a private teacher, he attended the Barmer City School and then a higher school in Rheydt. In 1850, his father determined that he should apprentice in the family firm \"Abraham Siebel & Son.\" He was not very fond of the profession and therefore turned to poetry. His friends were Emil Rittershaus and Hugo Oelbermann. Together they founded the Wuppertal poets' circle. Later, he joined the Sonntagskränzchen (Sunday gathering) of Friedrich Roeber.\nFrom 1852, Siebel was associated with the literary journal Morgenblatt für gebildete Leser (Morning paper for educated readers) and its editor Hermann Hauff. From 1853 to 1866, Siebel corresponded with Wolfgang Müller von Königswinter. Between 1854 and 1858, he wrote eleven letters to Nikolaus Hocker.\nBetween 1856 and 1859, he spent a considerable amount of time travelling in Berlin and Manchester, where he met Friedrich Engels in 1859 and Wilhelm Wolff. In May 1859, Siebel was to report as a reserve soldier to the Prussian Guard in Berlin.\nHe participated in a festival marking the centenary of Friedrich Schiller's birth in Manchester on 10 November 1859, with the poem \"Epilogue\".\n\nIn 1860, he returned to his homeland to marry on 14 November 1860. His wife was Eleonora Augusta Christina Reinhilda (Reinhilde) Freiin von Hurter (1842–1880). The marriage produced three children: Emilie Maria Siebel (b. 1862), Anna Reinhilde Siebel (b. 25 August 1863), and Carl Reinhold Siebel (b. 17 August 1867).\nIn May 1861, Karl Marx visited him in Elberfeld. In 1864, Siebel founded a section of the International Workingmen's Association in Barmen.\nDue to a chest ailment, he travelled to Funchal on the island of Madeira for healing purposes in 1866 and 1867.\nSiebel supported Karl Marx through reviews and advertisements in the German press to promote Marx's Das Kapital throughout 1867.\nShortly after his return from Madeira, he died of consumption in Elberfeld on 9 May 1868—he had lost weight quickly in the fortnight before his death, and was planning to travel to the Rhine. He was buried in the Bartholomäusstraße Cemetery in Barmen.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nGerman politician Johann Viktor Bredt called him a \"poet by divine grace\" in 1937, while Friedrich Engels summarised him in a letter to Jenny Marx on 22 December 1859: \"Give me Siebel any day; he may be a rotten poet, but he does at least know that he is a thorough humbug and all he asks is to be allowed to advertise himself—nowadays a necessary procédé [process] without which he would be a complete nonentity.\"\nThe poet Eduard Mörike expressed negative opinions about the quality of his poetry in a letter to Karl von Grüneisen on November 17, 1860.\nFrom the year 1865, four letters from Siebel to Wilhelm Jordan are preserved. Two letters to Gottfried Kinkel are in Kinkel's literary estate, two letters to Karl Gutzkow are kept in Frankfurt, and one letter to Paul Heyse is in the Munich State Library.\n\n\n== Works ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nBrümmer, Franz (1913). \"Siebel, Karl\".

        "content": "José Cuevas vs. Thomas Hearns, billed as World War II, was a professional boxing match contested on August 2, 1980, for the WBA welterweight title.\n\n\n== Background ==\nFollowing an impressive 28–0 start to his career, Thomas Hearns was installed as the top contender to WBA welterweight champion José Cuevas with the bout being announced in June 1980 to take place in August in Hearns hometown of Detroit, Michigan. The 21-year old Hearns had won all but two of his 28 fights by knockout while the 22-year old Cuevas was in the midst of a four-year reign as WBA welterweight champion and had knocked out 11 opponents in his 12 title fights dating back to 1976, though at 6'1\", Hearns possessed a four-inch height advantage over the 5'9\" Cuevas. Hearns claimed to have \"no fear\" of Cuevas and stated \"If I see an opening to get my right hand on him, then I think I'll knock him out.\"\nThe fight was scheduled shortly after the heavily hyped and much watched Leonard–Durán fight in which Durán had defeated Leonard to win the WBC's version of the welterweight title. Both Cuevas and Hearns expressed heavy interest in a possible unification match with Durán should they win this bout with Cuevas stating he would \"outbrawl, outbox and outpunch\" Durán while Hearns exclaimed that he \"can't wait to get Durán\" after defeating Cuevas.\n\n\n== The fight ==\nDuring the first round, Hearns, with a distinct height and reach advantage, used his left jab effectively to keep the much shorter Cuevas at bay and frequently hammered him with numerous combinations while Cuevas struggled to penetrate Hearns' defense leading to Hearns easily winning the round on the judges scorecards. Hearns continued to control the fight in the second round before landing a big right hand to Cuevas' head which dropped the champion face first to the canvas. Cuevas was able to answer the referee's 10-count and rose to his feet but was clearly hurt and on wobbly knees causing his manager Lupe Sanchez to enter the ring to prevent further damage which in turn led referee Stanley Christodoulou to end the fight and award Hearns the victory via technical knockout at 2:39 of the round.\n\n\n== Fight card ==\n\n^Note 1 For WBA Welterweight title ^Note 2 For WBA and The Ring Super Featherweight titles ^Note 3 For WBA lightweight title \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Aguairenda was the site of a colony of American families founded by William H. Murray in the Tarija Department of Bolivia. Murray selected the location after deciding to try and found a colony in the Gran Chaco. The colony was sanctioned by the Bolivian government between 1923 and 1928, when the colony's charter was revoked and Murray returned to Oklahoma.\n\n\n== History ==\nAguairenda was the site of a Catholic mission in Bolivia selected by William H. Murray as the location of his Bolivian colony. Murray negotiated with Bautista Saavedra's government for a colony in Bolivia, this time in the Tarija Department twelve miles north of Yacuiba. He received 42,000 acres under a 99-year lease for $1,800. He agreed to settle 25 families by December 31, 1925, and the colony had its export taxes waived. While Saavedra supported the colony, Flores Adolfo from the Tarija Department argued against the colony being built on traditional Indian lands in his district. Proponents of the colony advocated it as a buffer between Paraguay and was approved by the Bolivian Congress in 1923.\nColonists were required to follow the laws of Bolivia and a code of laws personally written by Murray. Amongst Murray's laws were a ban on brothels and saloons, a requirement to build a poultry shed within two years, a law that Murray owned all agriculture equipment, and a requirement he must personally approve all land transfers. Any change to the laws required a majority vote and Murray's consent. He barred colonists who were members of labor unions, socialists, Republicans, or born outside the United States. 41 families signed up with 15 leaving on May 4, 1924. About 80 colonists boarded the Oroya in New Orleans before sailing through Havana, the Panama Canal, to Antofagasta, Chile. The caravan then traveled by rail to Tartagal and then on foot to the Tarija Department through the Andes Mountains. The group arrived at Aguairenda, the colony site, on June 18, 1924.\nThe colonists immediately discovered much of the best land in the area was already leased by local Indigenous people. Colonists, mostly living in the school run by the local Catholic mission, were dissatisfied with the colony's poor living conditions. Most colonists left by the end of 1924 and Murray returned home in June 1925 to recruit more colonists. Later that year he shifted to trying to recruit Indians from their village at El Palmer. With the shift in strategy, the colony grew to nearly 400 and ran Bolivia's first cotton gin. Conflict in the Bolivian Legislature led President Hernando Siles to demand he create a profitable cotton colony or relinquish his concession. His lease was cancelled on August 6, 1928, and Murray transitioned to raising cattle before finally leaving Aquairenda on July 24, 1929.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nWilliam H.

        "content": "Bjarne Store-Jakobsen (born 12 January 1944) is a Norwegian politician, activist, and journalist. In 2005, he was elected to the Sámi Parliament of Norway as a member of the Labour Party. He was selected by the Sámi parliament to serve as a representative for the Sami People of Norway at the Working Group on Indigenous Peoples at the Barents Euro-Arctic Council, where he would serve as leader. He served as advisor for President of the Sámi Parliament Egil Olli until his dismissal in 2011. He would later leave the Labour Party and serve as the leader of the Sámi People's Party.\nPrior to his time in politics, Store-Jakobsen served as a spokesperson and unofficial leader for the Sami people protesting against the development of the Alta Hydroelectric Power Station during the Alta controversy. Store-Jakobsen worked in the film and television industry as a journalist for 15 years, working for Nordlys, Sámi Áigi, and Sveriges Television. His life is depicted in the 2014 film Bihttoš, directed by his daughter, Elle-Máijá Tailfeathers.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nStore-Jakobsen was born on 12 January 1944 in the village of Karlebotn and was raised in the village of Vesterelv (Nesseby). He met his wife Esther Tailfeathers at the 1981 World Council of Indigenous Peoples General Assembly in Canberra.: 187 \nDuring the late 1970s and early 1980s, amid the Alta controversy, Store-Jakobsen served in a leadership position for the ČSV Sámi rights movement, dubbed the \"brains behind\" the movement,: 177  in challenging the development of a hydroelectric plant, the Alta Hydroelectric Power Station, by the Norwegian government on the Altaelva. He served as the spokesman for the Sami who were undergoing a hunger strike at the Storting to oppose the development,: 195  citing the dam's subsequent threat to flood the Sámi community of Masi, and as an assertion of self-determination on their pastoral lands. Store-Jakobsen opposed the development on the grounds that individuals in the reindeer husbandry sector were opposed to the development, and the importance in protecting the nature in the area. As an activist, he was referred to with the nickname Bihttoš Bierna (Rebel Bjarne). Amid the confrontation, Store-Jakobsen stated that he was allegedly contacted by several European terrorist organizations, whose assistance he turned down. During the confrontation, Store-Jakobsen insisted that the protests be exclusively peaceful, refusing a proposal to sink the Janina, a ship used to house police officers, citing that the action would be a violent escalation.\nA trained journalist, Store-Jakobsen worked in the film and television production industries for 15 years, working as a journalist and editor. Prior to January 1978, Store-Jakobsen worked for Nordlys as a correspondent for Alta,: 102  quitting over management of the Sami editorial line.: 102  In the 1980s, Store-Jakobsen worked for the newspaper Sámi Áigi in Karasjok, as its editor.: 186 : 187  In 2003, he was working as the head of the Sami editorial department for Sveriges Television in Kiruna. As of 2007, Store-Jakobsen was a member of the Sami Film Association.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nFrom 2005 to 2009, Store-Jakobsen was elected to the Sámi Parliament of Norway in the 2005 Norwegian Sámi parliamentary election, representing the Midt-Troms constituency as a member of the Labour Party (Ap). During his time in the Sami parliament, he served as a member for the business and culture committee.\nIn 2008, Store-Jakobsen was appointed by the Sámi Parliament of Norway as the representative of the Sami people of Norway at the Working Group of Indigenous Peoples in the Barents Euro-Arctic Council. He was appointed for a second time in 2010, continuing to represent the Sami people of Norway. During his time in the BEAC, he served as head of the Working Group of Indigenous Peoples. As part of BEAR, Store-Jakobsen led the \"Vyngy syo\" (Voice of the Tundra) project, aimed at organizing Nenets language broadcasting in the Nenets Autonomous Okrug. In his capacity as leader for the working group, he was critical of Russian government programs targeting Indigenous people's relationship with alcohol and the failure to provide alternative employment for communities. He called for the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to provide financial support and prevent the bankruptcy of Kola Sámi Radio. The position oversaw the attempted implementation of the reindeer husbandry industry within the Sami of the Kola Peninsula with the project \"Obsjina Kildin\".\nIn June 2011, Store-Jakobsen was removed from his post of advisor to the President of the Sámi Parliament of Norway. Incumbent President Egil Olli cited the need for renewal in the post, stating that the then 67-year-old man was too old for the position, while Store-Jakobsen cited internal power struggles as the reason for his ouster. Amid the confrontation, Olli revealed that Store-Jakobsen discussed with him his intent to undermine fellow Ap politician and vice president Marianne Balto. Store-Jakobsen replied that he had expressed his hesitancy at Balto's suitability as president and his intent to work for other candidates vying for the position. He was replaced by Johan Vasara.\nOn 22 March 2015, He was chosen as the Sámi People's Party's (SfP) mayoral candidate for the community of Nesseby. During his run, he called for increased transparency for the mayor's office, as well as improving infrastructure for the growing fishing industry in the municipality. He was subsequently elected to the municipal council, as one of three SfP representatives. Store-Jakobsen placed fourth overall for personal votes, with 57 votes cast. On 5 December 2015, Store-Jakobsen was elected leader of the SfP.  He ran for the party in the 2021 Norwegian Sámi parliamentary election for the SfP as the first ranked candidate for the Eastern (Østre) constituency.\n\n\n== Views ==\nStore-Jakobsen views the relationship between the Sami and the Norwegian people as one of \"colonization\", which Jonathan Crossen compared to the treatment of Indigenous Canadians by the Canadian government. Store-Jakobsen supports the establishment of a truth and reconciliation commission for the whole of Sápmi with regards to Sami children forced to attend schools that were distant from their communities. He is critical of the Sámi Parliament of Norway's effectiveness, expressing his dissatisfaction with its weakness and lack of sway within society. Store-Jakobsen described the Finnmark Estate as a quasi-solution to the ongoing issues and did not work for Sami rights. During the discussions on the 2-2-2 governance system of the Hålogalandsallmenningen, he opposed it on the grounds that it would weaken the position of the Southern Sami. He believed that the Norwegian government and the Sámi parliament should work harder to rectify racist perceptions through ensuring correct information is presented in primary school. He advocated for the implementation dual naming or monolingual Sami language names for Nesseby locales. He expressed opposition to the Ap-led municipal council's removal of Sami language names on road signs.\nAs leader of the SfP, Store-Jakobsen was critical of Sami Parliamentary President Aili Keskitalo's decision to form a coalition with the Centre Party, citing the NSR's stance on forming coalitions with solely Sámi political parties, criticizing Keskitalo's reluctance to work with his party. Keskitalo cited the SfP's demands as being difficult to meet as reason for her reluctance to form a coalition with the party. During his run for Nesseby mayor Store-Jakobsen expressed willingness to accept refugees on humanitarian grounds. He was critical of Nesseby mayor Knut Store's decision to reject the acceptance of asylum seekers to the municipality, labelling his rejection in accordance with the policies of the Progress Party. He was critical of the Sami Parliament under the Olli administration agreeing on compromise measures with the Norwegian government's with regards to the stifling of the Sea Sami's fishing rights.\nStore-Jakobsen advocated for the release of Leonard Peltier during the Barack Obama administration. He personally visited Peltier, and called on previous Sami parliament presidents Egil Olli and Vibeke Larsen in calling for his release.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nStore-Jakobsen currently lives in Nesseby, Finnmark. As of 2021, he worked as a freelancer.\nStore-Jakobsen is the father of Norwegian-Canadian filmmaker Elle-Máijá Tailfeathers. He is the subject of her 2014 film Bihttoš (Rebel). The film, narrated by Tailfeathers, details Store-Jakobsen's \"mythical love story\" meeting his future wife Esther Tailfeathers at the 1981 World Council of Indigenous Peoples assembly in Australia, his subsequent struggles with depression, his suicide attempt, as well as his reconnection with his daughter and sharing with his daughter his experiences at the Sàmi boarding school system.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Gerrit Wolf is an industrial and organizational psychologist, academic, and author. He is a professor emeritus in the College of Business (COB) and emeritus Director of the Innovation Center at Stony Brook University (SBU).\nMost known for his entrepreneurship research, Wolf focuses on wireless technology's impact on organizations and consumers and has published over 60 academic articles on conflict management, decision-making, and leadership. He held the Fulbright Alexander Hamilton Chair of Entrepreneurship in 1993, and served as the first Fulbright Chair of Wireless E-Commerce in 2001.  Collaborating with his students, he has consulted for firms like Symbol Technologies and Ericsson.\n\n\n== Education ==\nWolf served as the Anchor Editor of the Hope College newspaper and earned his B.S. in Psychology with a major at Hope College in Holland, Michigan, in 1963, followed by attending the University of Vienna in Austria for Summer School in 1961. Subsequently, he pursued his Ph.D. in Social Psychology at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, completing his doctoral degree in 1967. During his early career, he also held summer roles, including salesman for Britannica, research assistant for a market research firm, and reporter for a Chicago newspaper.\n\n\n== Career ==\nWolf has held various academic positions, beginning as a Teaching Assistant at Cornell University's Psychology Department from 1964 to 1966, later serving as an Instructor until 1967. Afterward, he worked at Yale University, progressing from Assistant Professor to associate professor in the Administrative Sciences and Psychology Departments. He then taught at Georgia Tech and the University of Arizona before joining Stony Brook University in 1985. Additionally, he contributed to the COB SBU Summer School Business Program in Rome, Italy, from 2013 to 2017. He has been appointed professor emeritus at Stony Brook University's COB since 2022.\nWolf directed undergraduate studies at Yale University from 1971 to 1975 before assuming various administrative roles, including positions at the Georgia Institute of Technology and the University of Arizona. He served as Chair of the Management and Policy Department at U Arizona from 1981 to 1985, Dean of Stony Brook University's Harriman School from 1985 to 1991, and directed the Technology Management Executive Program from 1996 to 1999. Since 2000, he has been a University Senator at SBU and directed the Honors Business Program from 2003 to 2010. He also serves as an Advisor Board Member of the Clean Energy Business Incubator Program and has been the Director of the Innovation Concentration and SBU's Innovation Center since 2010. From 2015 to 2017, he advised the online MBA in Innovation and Shift Group and co-chaired the Pandemic Shift Program at the CoB from 2020 to 2021.\nWolf has held research appointments, including project manager and co-investigator on studies funded by organizations such as NSF and the National Center for Health Services Research, collaborating on the Pandemic International Research Team from 2020 to 2021 and serving as a co-investigator on the NSF project \"Entrepreneurship in Engineering\" from 2004 to 2011.\n\n\n== Research ==\nWolf's research delves into innovation, covering product/service design, commitment, and implementation by startups and firms, along with cooperation within and between teams, including leadership and intergroup competition through gaming.\n\n\n=== Management and innovation ===\nWolf has contributed to innovation management, leadership, business development, entrepreneurship, organizational psychology, engineering education, and entrepreneurship development through his research. He extended Staw's research, exploring how problem-solving strategies affected allocation behavior post-setbacks, challenging previous findings, and suggesting a new perspective on escalation as a problem-solving process. In 1984, he introduced the life cycle model alongside Gregory B. Northcraft, utilizing the time-adjusted rate of return to assess the impact of sunk costs on decisions to continue or terminate failing ventures. He also presented a model outlining the antecedents of organizational slack and hypotheses detailing their impact on different types of slack resources.\nWolf addressed the integration of entrepreneurship into engineering education, drawing from experiences in an NSF-sponsored pilot program involving Stony Brook University and three Long Island institutions. In 2017, his case study at Stony Brook University illustrated how business school students transformed scientific ideas into market innovations through entrepreneurial activity.\nWolf also reconciled coding method discrepancies for dummy variables, proposing a general formula based on theoretical connections between multiple comparisons and dummy multiple regression, with diverse design examples, incorporating sample size assumptions.\n\n\n=== Strategy ===\nWolf has studied strategic management, decision-making processes, organizational behavior, and human performance within organizations. His highly cited research introduced methods for evaluating agreement among judgments from a single group of judges on a singular variable regarding a solitary target, focusing on mitigating response biases for more accurate reliability estimates. Additionally, he reassessed the suitability of the rwg statistic as an index of interrater agreement, addressing critiques by Schmidt and Hunter and supported by Kozlowski and Hattrup, while concentrating on interpreting rwg in rating a single target and presenting a new derivation.\nWolf collaborated with Larry Zahn to investigate social exchange as an analytical framework, exploring actions, rewards, relationships, and interactions with experimental implications. He contrasted minimum resource theory with game theory solutions in three-person coalitions, emphasizing power dynamics and questioning theory application in hypothesis testing, alongside Martin Shubik. Their experimental duopoly game assessed the impacts of market structure, opponent behavior, and information, revealing nuanced insights into decision behavior responses over time. Additionally, alongside G. Lawrence Zahn, he studied leadership dynamics between superiors and subordinates. He employed a Markov model to simulate various relationship types and behaviors, highlighting mutual influence and implications for testing, selection, and training. He also extended the customer-contact model to enhance the design of high-contact service systems by proposing four key design features and a simple methodology, demonstrated through applications to savings and loan branches.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n1993 – Alexander Hamilton Chair in Entrepreneurship, Fulbright Fellow, SEED Foundation and University of Budapest\n2000 – Fulbright Chair of Wireless E-Commerce, School of Economics and Royal Technology Institute\n\n\n== Selected articles ==\nConlon, E.

        "content": "Ilana (The Creator) is a 2019 studio album by Nigerien desert blues band Mdou Moctar. The album was the first where the guitarist Mdou Moctar converted his solo musical project into a full band and has received positive reviews by critics.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nAccording to the review aggregator Metacritic, Ilana (The Creator) received \"universal acclaim\" based on a weighted average score of 88 out of 100 from 5 critic scores. J. D. of The Economist wrote that this album \"mastery of Moctar's craft\" as a guitarist as this album \"makes use of brilliant and dense fingerpicking as well as the power chords favoured in hard rock\" Reef Younis of Loud and Quiet scored this album a 7 out of 10, summing up his review \"few have stories as compelling as Mdou Moctar but, as ‘Ilana (The Creator)’ testifies, he also has the Saharan sounds to back it up\". NPR's Bob Boilen called this \"the most insane psychedelic guitar album of the 21st century\" and recommended that listeners come at it \"with the volume cranked\". Editors at Pitchfork Media scored this release 8.0 out of 10 and critic Andy Beta praised this release as \"an incandescent set of guitar music with a spontaneous, celebratory air—and a latent urgency reflecting the region’s very real difficulties\". At PopMatters, Adriane Pontecorvo rated this album a 9 out of 10, writing that the album builds on the desert blues tradition and yet \"still sounds fresh and different from anything Moctar’s contemporaries do, but it is wholly based on his considerable skill as a rock guitarist and songwriter rather than on trying to get in on current trends\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nAll songs written by Mahamadou \"Mdou Moctar\" Souleymane.\n\n\"Kamane Tarhanin\" – 5:08\n\"Asshet Akal\" – 4:51\n\"Inizgam\" – 1:24\n\"Anna\" – 4:33\n\"Takamba\" – 2:50\n\"Tarhatazed\" – 7:27\n\"Wiwasharnine\" – 3:38\n\"Ilana\" – 4:46\n\"Tumastin\" – 4:21\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nMdou Moctar\n\nMikey Coltun – bass guitar, recording, production\nMazawadje Aboubacar Ibrahim – drums\nAhmoudou Madassane – rhythm guitar, backing vocals\nMdou Moctar – lead guitar, vocals\nAdditional personnel\n\nRobert Beatty – artwork\nAroudaini Daniel – djembe\nHeba Kadry – audio mastering\nChristopher Kirkley – production\nChris Koltay – recording\nRigo Luis – photography\nSeth Manchester – mixing\nCem Mısırlıoğlu – drum programming\nAnna Viotti – photography\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of 2019 albums\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nIlana at Discogs (list of releases) \nIlana at MusicBrainz (list of releases)",

        "content": "Great Wood is a nature reserve of Wiltshire Wildlife Trust, about 3 miles (4.8 km) west of Royal Wootton Bassett in Wiltshire, England.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Trust announced the purchase of Great Wood, formerly a commercially managed site, in March 2023. This was achieved with the help of a grant from Biffa Award, and donations. Gary Mantle, chief executive of the Trust, said: \"We will restore it to a fully functioning ancient woodland ecosystem, increasing biodiversity whilst ensuring it is more resilient to the impacts of climate change\".\nIts area is 71 hectares (180 acres); it is one of the twenty largest ancient woodlands in Wiltshire. It contains a great number of wild service trees, and some ancient oak trees.\nRestoration involves replacing conifers, formerly covering a third of the wood, with deciduous trees including field maple, hornbeam, rowan and wych elm, that provide a more varied habitat and attract previously absent species. Some areas are opened up to make woodland glades, which some species prefer, and invasive plants are removed. Since ponds in woodlands are habitats for a great variety of wildlife, an existing pond is restored, and a second pond is created. While restoration work is carried out by volunteers, the wood is not open to the public.\nIt is hoped that the wood will be connected to nearby woods and hedgerows, in cooperation with other landowners, so that it will be part of a wider network of nature recovery.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Helen Tredway Graham (July 21, 1890 – April 4, 1971) was an American pharmacologist known for her research contributions in pharmacology and her active involvement in social causes. She earned her academic degrees from Bryn Mawr College and the University of Chicago before marrying physician Evarts Graham in 1916. Despite societal expectations, Graham pursued a successful career in pharmacology while raising two children. Her research focused on histamine and peripheral nerve cells, yielding several scientific publications. Graham also engaged in social activism, particularly in advocating against air pollution and promoting education.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life and education ===\nHelen Tredway Graham was born on July 21, 1890, in Dubuque, Iowa, to Harry Ennis Tredway, a merchant, and Marian McConnell. She pursued higher education at Bryn Mawr College, where she graduated with both a B.S. and an M.A. in chemistry. Graham furthered her studies in Germany before obtaining her Ph.D. in chemistry from the University of Chicago in 1915.\n\n\n=== Career and family life ===\nIn 1916, Graham married physician Evarts Graham, and the couple had two children. Despite societal expectations at the time, Graham balanced her family responsibilities with a successful career in pharmacology. During World War I, while her husband served overseas, Graham worked as an assistant in pharmacology at Johns Hopkins University. After the war, the couple settled in St. Louis, where Evarts had a position at Washington University Medical School.\n\n\n=== Scientific contributions ===\nGraham returned to the laboratory in 1926 as an instructor in the pharmacology department at Washington University Medical School. She conducted research alongside Nobel Prize winner Herbert Gasser, focusing on the physiology and pharmacology of peripheral nerve cells. Graham steadily advanced through the academic ranks, becoming an assistant professor in 1931 and an associate professor in 1937. Graham was appointed as a full professor of pharmacy in 1954.\n\n\n=== Social activism and later life ===\nOutside of her scientific pursuits, Graham was involved in various social causes, including participating in the movement against air pollution in St. Louis, helping establish the Junior College District of St. Louis, and serving as a trustee of Bryn Mawr College and the Community School in St. Louis. She also contributed to civic causes, serving as president of the St. Louis League of Women Voters and sitting on the city's board of freeholders.\nFollowing the passing of her husband in 1957 due to lung cancer, Graham continued her contributions to scientific research and social activism. She was promoted to emeritus professor in 1958 but remained active in her scientific pursuits and social causes until her death in 1971.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nRudavsky, Shari (February 2000). \"Graham, Helen Tredway\".

        "content": "The Mikhail Mishustin's Second Cabinet (Russian: Второе правительство Мишустина) is the federal government of Russia, formed in May 2024, led by Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin.\nIt is the first government of Russia the entire composition of which will be approved by the State Duma and the Federation Council after the 2020 constitutional reform.\nThe first coalition Cabinet since 2004, which, in addition to representatives of United Russia, also included a representative of the Liberal Democratic Party.\n\n\n== Formation ==\nThe government began to form after the resignation of the First Mishustin cabinet on 7 May 2024, as a result of Vladimir Putin's accession to a new presidential term.\nOn 10 May 2024, Chairman of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin announced that Vladimir Putin had proposed Mishustin's candidacy for the post of Prime Minister. The confirmation hearing for Mishustin is scheduled to take place on the same day.\nEven before Mishustin's nomination, the deputy head of the United Russia faction, Yevgeny Revenko, said that the faction would support any candidate for the post of Prime Minister proposed by Vladimir Putin. Since United Russia has more than half of the seats in the State Duma, this means that Mishustin would become Prime Minister, even if all other parties voted against it. After Mishustin's consultations with the parliamentary factions, the leaders of the Liberal Democratic Party, A Just Russia – For Truth and New People also expressed support for Mishustin.\nThe Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, after meeting with Mishustin, said that his faction would abstain from voting.

        "content": "Parashurama Jayanti (Sanskrit: परशुरामजयंती, romanized: Paraśurāmajayantī) is a Hindu festival observed to celebrate the birth of Parashurama, the sixth incarnation of Vishnu. It is celebrated every year on Akshaya Tritiya, falling on the tritiya tithi (third lunar day) of the Shukla Paksha (first lunar fortnight) in the Hindu month of Vaisakha.\n\n\n== Description ==\nIt is believed that Parashurama was born on Akshaya Tritiya during the occasion of Pradosha. According to the Skanda Purana and the Bhavishya Purana, Vishnu was born as the son of the rishi (sage) Jamadagni and Renuka. The Brahmanda Purana describes the earth goddess Bhumi assuming the form of a cow to appeal to Vishnu to save her from the atrocities committed upon her by kings, who belonged to the Kshatriya class. The deity incarnated as Parashurama as a member of the Brahmin class, raised in his father's ashram and receiving Vedic education. As a child, he was blessed by the deity Shiva with a parashu (axe). When his father was slain in an attempt to protect his cow Kamadhenu from theft by a king named Kartavirya Arjuna, Parashurama swore vengeance and vowed to end the persecution of innocents. After killing Kartavirya Arjuna and his sons, he toured the land of Bharata twenty-one times, massacring kings of every Kshatriya lineage he came across in his path in a number of wars. He halted his destruction when his Bhargava ancestors appealed to him to show mercy to the surviving monarchs; he distributed the lands of his conquests to Brahmins, and started to perform a penance at the mountain called Mahendragiri. Parashurama is regarded to be a chiranjivi (immortal), prophesied to be the mentor of the tenth avatar of Vishnu, Kalki.\n\n\n== Observances ==\nDevotees of Parashurama fast on this day as a spiritual practice, denoting discipline. They share stories of the deity’s bravery and righteousness. On this occasion, bhajans, kirtans, and recitations are organised by adherents. Worship and havans are performed in different Parashurama temples. Bhandara Prasad is distributed to devotees. Shobha Yatras and Kalash Yatras are also taken out from different places in different cities, in which a large number of devotees participate.\n\nThe Tantric texts of the Parashurama Kalpasutra and the Parashurama Pratapa are recited by adherents.The Parashurama Jayanti celebration at Parshuram Mandir in Mokama has received status of a state festival by the Bihar Government due to the popularity of the grand Kalash Yatra organised there every year.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAkshaya Tritiya\nHanuman Jayanti\nNarasimha Jayanti\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "In semantics, gender (also known as natural gender) is a generic category of things according to which nouns, adjectives, numbers, verbs and prepositions are selected. Gender as a category of things differs from grammatical gender because it is not a class of nouns. Moreover, 'natural' in 'natural gender' is a misnomer because gender is a socially and linguistically construed category, not a category provided by Nature.\nLanguages differ as for what gets generified. Speakers of some languages construe a binary system of sex through gender whereas speakers of other languages don't. Latin is a langauge in which the female-male system ('sex') is generified, that is, it is a language wherein nouns for females are accompanied by inflected words ending in a (bella, ūna, vīsa, ...) and nouns for males are accompanied by inflected words ending in us (bellus, ūnus, vīsus, ...). However, inflected words ending in a are selected not only for females, but also for fruit trees; and those ending in us are selected not only for males, but also for humans irrespectively of sex. From a systemic perspective, there is a functional mapping from genders to inflectional endings, but not the other way round.\nIn Latin, there are a few frequent gender contrasts:\n\npersonal vs impersonal\nfemales vs males\nfruits vs fruit trees\n\n\n= Personal vs impersonal =\nBeings are divided into persons and stuff. In most genres of text, persons can be mortal or immortal, that is, they include humans and gods/goddesses; and stuff consists of the remaining beings, including pets and farm animals. In some genres such as fables, animals of any species count as persons.\nLatin pronouns often divide beings between these two genders.\nInterrogative pronouns\n\nQuis est intus? (Who is inside?)\nQuid est intus? (What is inside?)\nIndefinite pronouns\n\nAliquis est intus. (Someone is inside.)\nAliquid est intus. (Something is inside.)\nWord agreement\n\nAliquis vīsus est. (Someone was seen.)\nAliquid vīsum est. (Something was seen.)\n\n\n= Females vs males =\nMost humans are interested in the sex of other humans, but in our agrarian societies we humans may also want to know the sex of the animals that we breed. For that reason, different languages include different lists of animal species whose sex is construed through gender, but in no language thus far insects and plants belong to such a list. In Latin, humans, deities, pets and farm animals are typically divided into females and males whereas most wild animals are referred to irrespectively of sex.\nIn Latin, proper nouns were ascribed to humans according to their sex. If the stem of proper nouns end in a vowel, the nominative noun ends in a vowel for females and it ends in \"s\" for males. The stem for most proper nouns for females end either in \"a\", \"ē\" or consonants.\n\nMost common nouns for humans, pets and farm animals are selected according to sex:\n\nHowever, there are a few common nouns such as testis (the witness) for which someone's sex stays covert until an inflected word is selected according to it.\nWord agreement\n\nMulier vīsa est. (The woman was seen.)\nHomō vīsus est. (The man was seen.)\nWord selection according to sex\n\nTestis locūta est. (The female witness spoke.)\nTestis locūtus est. (The male witness spoke.)\n\n\n= Fruits vs fruit trees =\nFruit plants are divided into two developmental stages: fruits and fruit trees.\n\nWord agreement\n\nMālum vīsum est. (The apple was seen.)\nMālus vīsa est. (The apple tree was seen.)\n\n\n= Citations =\n This article incorporates text available under the CC BY 4.0 license.",

        "content": "Guardian Angel is a 1994 American action film directed by Richard W. Munchkin, starring Cynthia Rothrock, Lydie Denier, Daniel McVicar and Marshall R. Teague. Rothrock plays a cop-turned-bodyguard on assignment to protect a rich playboy from an unhinged woman, who is both the client's former mistress and the criminal responsible for the death of the heroine's fiancé. Although contemporary reviews were mixed, it is better regarded than most of the actress' American output.\n\n\n== Plot ==\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development and filming ===\nGuardian Angel was Rothrock's first and only collaboration with action specialists PM Entertainment. The company was typically reluctant to hire women in leading roles due to their limited track record in the genre, but gave her a chance based on the performance of some of her movies. Filming took place in the Los Angeles agglomeration between July 26 and September 3, 1993. The fictional \"Dick's Bar\", where Rothrock's character brawls with a group of thugs, was represented by the Yukon Belle in Thousand Oaks, once a legitimate criminal hangout that fell victim to the area's gentrification a few years after filming.\n\n\n=== Stunts ===\nRothrock's frequent screen partner Richard Norton contributed to fight choreography. A Mexican performer, hired by the production despite his limited credentials, was grazed by Rothrock during filming, and tried to extort them $250,000 due to an allegedly broken nose. Rothrock denied causing him any lasting damage, and the man quickly lowered his demands to a fraction of the initial amount. Co-star Lydie Denier was inspired to take kickboxing classes after witnessing Rothrock in action. The film marked the debut of veteran stuntwoman Anita Hart, who was introduced to PM stunt coordinator Cole McKay by a mutual friend. Playing the killer maid, she got her high fall on the first take and went on to become a PM regular herself. Although Rothrock performed her fight scenes, some of PM's trademark setpieces required the use of a stunt double, such as the horse chase. Reflecting the company's hectic shoots, the wig worn by the rider visibly slipped during the scene but it could not be redone, and the mishap had to be worked around in post-production. The character of Goddard, a fellow cop who helps the heroine commandeer the Cigarette Lady speedboat for the final chase, was played by its real-life owner and competitive driver Anna Dalva.\n\n\n== Release ==\nIn the U.S., Guardian Angel was released on VHS by Imperial Entertainment on November 23, 1994. It reached Australia the same month via 21st Century Pictures, under the title Beyond Justice, and the U.K. the previous July through Guild Home Video. The film received a domestic DVD re-issue on May 4, 2004, from Kreative Digital Entertainment via Universal Music & Video Distribution, as part of a slate of PM Entertainment releases.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nGuardian Angel received mixed reviews from mainstream publications. TV Guide criticized the inclusion of another ill-fated companion for Rothrock, but noted the novelty of the femme fatale antagonist played by Denier, and ultimately deemed that \"it's McVicar's tongue-in-cheek turn as the Robert Wagnerian poor little rich boy that makes Guardian Angel watchable, if hardly a standout.\" Ballantine Books' Video Movie Guide wrote: \"Martial arts expert Cynthia Rothrock is back in this pedestrian effort about an ex-cop out to avenge the deaths of her partner and lover. [...] Novelty here is the killer is a woman. Anyone for a good cat fight?\"\nBritish reference book Elliot's Guide to Home Entertainment called it \"[a] violent actioner that serves merely as an adequate showcase for Rothrock’s fighting skills.\" Pat Gillespie of Australian newspaper The Age described Rothrock as \"stilted but likeable\". However, he found that the film's humorous brand of feminism was \"short circuited by gratuitous focus on boorish fight scenes\", which amounted to little more than \"cheap thrills\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGuardian Angel at IMDb \nGuardian Angel at AllMovie",

        "content": "Rev. Nathan Scarritt (1821 — May 22, 1890) was an American educator, pastor, and real estate dealer.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nScarritt was born in 1821 in Edwardsville, Illinois, the seventh of twelve children. His parents, Nathan and Latty, traveled from New Hampshire on wagon. As a child, he worked on a farm in Alton, Illinois, and didn't receive a proper education.\nScarritt attended McKendree College, having to work as a cleaner for the school to pay for tuition. During his third year of college, his father became ill and he left school to care for him. The school paid for his final year, and he graduated in 1842 as valedictorian.\n\n\n== Education career ==\nTo pay off student debts, Scarritt worked briefly as a schoolteacher in Waterloo, Illinois until 1845, when he moved to Fayette, Missouri. There, he worked as a teacher and helped establish Howard Female College. For his efforts, the University of Missouri awarded him an honorary Master of Arts.\n\n\n== Religious career ==\nScarritt converted to the Methodist Episcopal Church, South demomination of Christianity in 1848, and began working at the Shawnee Methodist Mission. In 1850, he married Martha Matilda Chick, daughter of William Miles Chick. He left the Methodist Mission in 1852, and was later appointed by a bishop as an elder of the Kickapoo people. He also worked as a traveling minister for the Delaware, Shawnee and Wyandott tribes—with translations done by Silas Armstrong.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nScarritt died on May 22, 1890. His son William Chick Scarritt was a prominent lawyer and owner of the William Chick Scarritt House. William Chick Scarritt's daughter, and Nathan Scarritt's granddaughter was Dorothy McKibbin, a manager of the Manhattan Project.\n\n\n== Reverend Nathan Scarritt Home ==\n\nIn the 1850s, Scarritt moved to Kansas City, Missouri and bought land from liutenant Joseph Boggs and between 1847 and 1853, built an L-shaped two-story house for $2150. He lived in that house until 1862. The house is approximately 2,000 square feet, and is constructed of a limestone foundation, juglan clapboard painted olive-tan.\n\n\n== References ==",

It is classified under the Ministry of Public Health as a general hospital. It is an affiliated teaching hospital of the Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1979, Krathum Baen opened as a community hospital by the Tha Chin River with a capacity of 30 beds. The local community financially supported the construction of the hospital. The hospital was gradually expanded, with a five-storey building opened by Princess Sirindhorn in 2009. It became classified as a general hospital in 2012. Due to the large numbers of industrial estates and factories in the area, occupational medicine is a focus of the hospital. As of March 2024, it has a capacity of 300 beds.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHealthcare in Thailand\nHospitals in Thailand\nList of hospitals in Thailand\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The CF-V21P is a notebook-sized laptop released by Panasonic in 1993. It was the first notebook computer to have an integrated CD-ROM drive as an option, albeit it only supports up to 3.5-inch-diameter mini CDs instead of standard 4.7-inch-diameter discs. It was discontinued in 1994.: 111 \n\n\n== Specifications ==\nOn its release in October 1993, the stock CF-V21P featured an Intel i486SX microprocessor clocked at 25 MHz, initially upgradable to a 50-MHz i486DX2. Later, the company made the i486DX4 clocked at 75 MHz available as a processor upgrade. The stock amount of RAM on the motherboard is 4 MB, expandable to up to 20 MB with aftermarket RAM cards. The notebook was sold with either 80 MB or 120 MB internal hard disk drives, with a 450 MB drive later made an option on the high-end. For a pointing device, Panasonic built the CF-V21P with a trackball positioned at the center of the palm rest, with the left- and right-click buttons to either side of it.\nFor screen technology, the notebook was optioned with either a 9.5-inch monochrome STN display; a 10.4-inch color TFT display; or a 9.5-inch STN touchscreen with pen stylus. The screen housing can be detached from the bottom housing and either removed (for upgrading); or flipped around and closed onto the keyboard, making the laptop able to be operated like a tablet computer (useful when equipped with the touchscreen display). All displays were native VGA resolution: 640 × 480 pixels. The on-board graphics chip contains 1 MB of on-die VRAM, supporting a maximum resolution of 1024 × 768 pixels at 256 colors on an external monitor.\nBesides the two type-II or one type-III PC Cards, the CF-V21P supports a number of optional accessories via a multibay slot on the side of the computer—trademarked by Panasonic as the \"Multimedia Pocket\". In this multibaby fits either a 3.5-inch floppy drive, a second NiMH battery, a TV tuner card (allowing the laptop to be used as a television receiver), or a CD-ROM drive. The lattermost option made the CF-V21P the first notebook computer on the market to have an integrated CD-ROM drive as an option. However, it was hamstrung by the nonstandard maximum dimension of its supported media—3.5-inch-diameter mini CDs—for which very little commercial software on the market was available on its release. This option may have appealed to companies purchasing fleets of the CF-V21P, who likely had contracts with CD-ROM mastering facilities to manufacture proprietary software packages relevant to internal company functions; or to those who had access to early CD-R burners (which in 1993 were very expensive).\nPanasonic also offered for the CF-V21P a port replicator and a docking station, the latter of which houses 16-bit ISA slots for yet more options, including a Pentium upgrade board and a capture card to store analog video onto the hard drive. As stock, the CF-V21P has no on-board audio; Panasonic sold a 16-bit PC Card sound card to allow the notebook to classify as a multimedia PC. Depending on the configuration ordered, the CF-V21P weighs between 5.7 to 8.2 pounds (2.6 to 3.7 kg).\n\n\n== Development ==\nThe CF-V21P was designed and manufactured by Panasonic in Japan. The company's plants were equipped to produce between 40,000 and 50,000 units of the CF-V21P in a 12-month period. The company produced the LCD panels in-house, while Intel provided the chipset and Western Digital provided the on-board graphics chip.: 210 \n\n\n== Reception and legacy ==\nAnush Yegyazarian of PC Magazine concluded that the CF-V21P \"offers a lot of flexibility for upgrading (or downgrading) to suit most user needs, but [it] lags in performance. Specifically, he rated the computer's raw number-crunching performance below-average, as was its hard drive performance, although graphical performance scored high marks. Clare Newsome of PC User found the notebook \"an impressive piece of design which takes notebook modularity and upgradability to a new level. Unfortunately this level is both beyond the budgets of many users and the developments of software vendors, who have yet to accept the 3.5-inch CD format\". PC World's Bryan Hastings called the TFT display of his review unit \"luxurious\" and was impressed by the large hard drive but found the battery life subpar and the notebook overall overpriced for most users.\nPanasonic followed up the CF-V21P with the V41 in late 1994, which added a full-sized CD-ROM drive.: 111 \n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

Located just a few kilometers from the city limits of Saint John, Balls Lake lake has its own watershed, with the lake draining to McKenzie Brook.: 21  Balls Lake has been recorded containing multiple fish species including brook trout, lake chubs, and American eels.: 22  Additionally, it is part of the Balls Lake Formation, a formation dating back to around the Carboniferous period.\n\n\n== History ==\nAs early as the 19th century, Balls Lake has had its own fishing club known as the Balls Lake Fishing Club, which previously had its own club house until it was destroyed during a forest fire around June 4, 1903. Following a meeting held by the club later that year, a new club house was set to be built. Balls Lake additionally had a lumber mill operating as recent as the late 19th century. The lake has also had speckled trout introduced to it, with 518 being introduced from Big Salmon River in 1951.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of bodies of water of New Brunswick\n\n\n== References ==",

It is characterized by its relatively long tail, moderately long hindfoot, large skull, and large, inflated auditory bullae. Initially it was compared to the similar looking T. aureus and T. pyrrhonotus but has a few distinguishing characteristics. The skull is smaller than T. aureus. The tail is longer than T. pyrrhonotus. The auditory bullae is larger T. aureus but comparatively smaller than T. pyrrhonotus.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nThe species occurs in Polylepis forest within the páramo and montane forests primarily in region 6 and 7 of Ecuador, at medium and high elevations of 2,330 to 4,000 metres (7,640 to 13,120 ft).\nThere is a distinct population in Cañar that potentially may be a subspecies or separate species.\n\n\n== Status ==\nThomasomys auricularis is listed as data deficient by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in due to a lack of general knowledge.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "HMS Basilisk was a Beagle-class (from 1913 G-class) destroyer of the British Royal Navy. The Beagles were coal-fuelled ships, designed for a speed of 27 kn (31 mph; 50 km/h) and armed with a 4 in (102 mm) gun and two torpedo tubes. Built by J. Samuel White and launched in 1910, Basilisk was initially commissioned into the First Destroyer Flotilla at Portsmouth. In 1912, the warship joined the Third Destroyer Flotilla before being transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet as part of the Fifth Destroyer Flotilla in 1913. As the First World War approached, the destroyer was based in Alexandra, Egypt, but was swiftly redeployed to Malta, followed, in 1915, by action in the Dardanelles Campaign. After the Armistice of 1918 that ended the war, Basilisk was initially transferred to the Nore and then sold in 1921 to be broken up.\n\n\n== Design and development ==\n\nBasilisk was one of the Beagle-class destroyers ordered as part of the 1908–1909 shipbuilding programme.  The vessels were coal-burning after concerns had been raised about the availability of fuel oil in time of war and the bridge was larger and higher than previous designs. This reduced costs, although it also meant that five boilers were needed, the extra machinery meaning that deck space became more premium. The Beagle class vessels were not built to a standard design, with detailed design being left to the builders of individual ships in accordance with a loose specification, in this case J. Samuel White. The class were also known, on occasion, as the Basilisk class, named after this vessel.  In October 1913, as part of a wider renaming of the Royal Navy's warships into classes named alphabetically, the class was renamed as G-class.\nBasilisk was 275 ft (83.8 m) long, with a beam of 28 ft (8.5 m) and a draught of 16 ft 6 in (5 m). Normal displacement was 976 long tons (992 t). Five White-Forster boilers fed direct-drive Parsons steam turbines driving three shafts. Two funnels were fitted. The machinery was rated at 12,000 shaft horsepower (8,900 kW) giving a design speed of 27 kn (31 mph; 50 km/h). During sea trials, the destroyer reached a speed of 27.984 kn (32.203 mph; 51.826 km/h) at a displacement of 968 long tons (984 t). Up to 226 long tons (230 t) of coal was carried, giving a design range of 2,000 nautical miles (3,700 km; 2,300 mi) at 15 knots (28 km/h; 17 mph). The ship had a complement of 96 officers and ratings.\nArmament consisted of one 4 in (102 mm) BL Mk VIII gun forward and three 3 in (76 mm) QF 12-pounder 12 cwt guns aft. Torpedo armament consisted of two 21 in (533 mm) torpedo tubes, one placed forward and the other aft. Two spare torpedoes were carried. On 8 April 1916, the Admiralty approved fitting the destroyer with depth charges. Two depth charge launchers and two charges were carried.\n\n\n== Construction and career ==\nBasilisk was laid down by J. Samuel White at East Cowes on the Isle of Wight with the yard number 1293 on 11 May 1909, and launched on 9 February the following year. The ship cost £109.729. Basilisk was the ninth to serve in the Royal Navy named for the mythical creature. The vessel was commissioned at Portsmouth and joined the First Destroyer Flotilla on 17 September.  In 1912, a reorganisation of the Home Fleet resulted in the ships of the Beagle class forming the Third Destroyer Flotilla. The vessel remained part of the Third Flotilla in March 1913.. Basilisk was transferred, along with the rest of the class, to the newly-formed Fifth Destroyer Flotilla as part of the Mediterranean Fleet.\nAs the First World War approached, Basilisk was part of the Second Division of the Fifth Flotilla and based in Alexandra. The destroyer sailed to Malta, joining the rest of the flotilla on 9 August. The island had a coal shortage, which restricted the vessel's activity. On 6 August 1914, the Second Division was deployed searching for the German warships Goeben and Breslau but this was curtailed by a lack of fuel. On 18 August, the destroyer was deployed to Suez to deter the Ottoman Empire from restricting British access to the Suez Canal. From 25 October, the destroyer, along with sister ship Racoon, patrolled the Gulf of Suez. The ship subsequently joined the force based in the Suez Canal and Red Sea to protect the sea lane for Allied shipping.\nOn 19 November, Basilisk sailed for Tenedos and spent the next year supporting the naval operations in the Dardanelles Campaign. In preparation for the assault, the Admiralty decided to attack the defences on the Dardanelles strait with the pre-dreadnought battleships Albion, Majestic and Triumph. The attack was largely ineffective as the troops moved the batteries so they were safe from bombardment. On 26 February 1915, Basilisk, alongside Racoon, escorted the battleships Cornwallis, Irresistible and Vengeance as they attempted to land parties to attack the batteries. This was also largely ineffective and also exposed the force to the presence of large minefields across the narrows of the Dardanelles straits.\nOn the night of 1/2 March, along with sister ships Grasshopper, Mosquito and Racoon, the destroyer escorted trawlers attempting to clear the minefields. The force came under heavy fire from Turkish guns, and were forced to turn back before reaching the minefields. It was then decided to clear the minefields by day while the British and French battleships suppressed the Turkish guns that protected the minefields. This was attempted on the following day, with Basilisk, Grasshopper, Mosquito and Racoon again escorting the minesweeping trawlers. The attempt failed, however, with the fire from mobile guns forcing the minesweepers to turn back. Even more consequentially, the battleships Bouvet, Ocean and Irresistible hit mines and sank.  On 6 August, the ship carried troops of the IX Corps to their landing at Suvla Bay. After the army had retreated, the destroyer then escorted the light cruiser Chatham, the flagship of Admiral Rosslyn Wemyss, 1st Baron Wester Wemyss, in bombing Ottoman Army positions at Suvla.\nThe destroyer remained a member of the Fifth Destroyer Flotilla within the Mediterranean Fleet. The need for destroyer escorts increased dramatically as the German navy introduced unrestricted submarine warfare. By June 1917, the submarines were sinking 142,338 long tons (144,622 t) of shipping a month. In response, the Admiralty introduced convoys on major routes, including those between Malta and Egypt, escorted by destroyers. On 20 January 1918, Basilisk, along with the monitors M29 and M32, was detached to Alexandra.\nAfter the Armistice that ended the war, the Royal Navy quickly withdrew all pre-war destroyers from active service. By February 1919, Basilisk had been transferred to The Nore. As the force returned to a peacetime level of strength, both the number of ships and the amount of personnel needed to be reduced to save money. Declared superfluous to operational requirements, Basilisk was retired, and, on 1 November 1921, sold to Fryer of Sunderland to be broken up.\n\n\n== Pennant numbers ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nBrown, David K.

The dialect is slowly dying, as younger people don't use it as much anymore.\n\n\n== Classification ==\nCremish is an Eastern Lombard dialect belonging to the Gallo-Italic branch of the Romance languages. It is more closely related to the Langues d'oïl, Occitan, Catalan, the Rhaeto-Romance languages, and the Iberian Romance languages, than Italian. It is similar to the dialects of Bergamo (Bergamasque) and Brescia (Brescian).\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nThe dialect is mostly spoken in the Cremasque Territory, which is the area adjacent to Crema and surroundings. It extends from the area of Rivolta d'Adda to Gombito and Castelleone.\n\n\n== Orthography ==\nThe dialect is traditionally written in the Classical Cremish Orthography, which is shown in Bonifacio Samarani's book Vocabulario cremasco-italiano.\n\n\n== Literature ==\nThe Cremish dialect began thriving in literature in the 18th century. A notable poet that wrote in the dialect was Federico Pesadori, who wrote works such as A Crèma, Ai casòt d'ingürie, and L'ucarina.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nGeroldi Luciano, Vocabolario del dialetto di Crema, Edizioni Tipolito Uggè, 2004\nFrancesco Piantelli, Folclore Cremasco, ristampa, Arti Grafiche Cremasche, 1985, pag. 422 e seguenti.\nBonifacio Samarani, Vocabolario cremasco-italiano, 1852\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNature of Cremasque (with names of animals and plants in Cremish)\nNicknames of the inhabitants of the villages of the cremasque Archived 5 March 2016 at the Wayback Machine (scormagna or scurmagna)",

        "content": "Eunpyeong B (Korean: 은평구 을) is a constituency of the National Assembly of South Korea. The constituency consists of parts of Eunpyeong District, Seoul. As of 2024, 195,270 eligible voters were registered in the constituency. The constituency was created in 1988 from the Seodaemun–Eunpyeong constituency.\n\n\n== History ==\nThroughout its history, Eunpyeong B has elected members of liberal, centrist, and conservative political parties to represent the constituency. Despite conservative politician Lee Jae-oh being elected a total of five times in Eunpyeong B, in recent years, the liberal Democratic Party has been dominant in the constituency.\nDeputy Speaker of the National Assembly Kim Jae-kwang of the centre-right Reunification Democratic Party was the first member to represent the constituency. He was succeeded by Lee Won-hyung of the centre-left Democratic Party who won in the 1992 election. Lee Jae-oh made his debut in this election as the left-wing Popular Party candidate. Lee Jae-oh won the following election held in 1996 as a member of the centre-right New Korea Party, defeating incumbent Lee Won-hyung by over eight points. Lee comfortably won re-election in 2000 with 51% of the vote and narrowly won re-election in 2004 with 45.25% of the vote against Uri Party candidate Song Mi-hwa who received 43.07% of the vote. However, Lee was defeated by Moon Kook-hyun of the centrist reformist Creative Korea Party by a margin of over eleven points.\nOn October 22, 2009, Moon Kook-hyun lost his seat after he was found guilty of violating South Korean election law; specifically the political funds act. Accordingly, a by-election for the constituency was held in 2010 which saw the constituency's former member Lee Jae-oh of the conservative Grand National Party win in a landslide, securing 58.33% of the vote. In the 2012 election, Lee narrowly won re-election by a margin 1.14% against unified opposition candidate Cheon Ho-sun of the centre-left Unified Progressive Party.\nAhead of the 2016 South Korean election, incumbent Lee Jae-oh was not re-nominated as the Saenuri Party's candidate for Eunpyeong B. This move came as the Saenuri Party's pro-Park Geun-hye faction grew influential within the party and denied renomination for many party members considered to be anti-Park or pro-Lee Myung-bak. In response to this, Lee left the Saenuri Party on March 23, 2016, and announced his intention to run as an independent candidate on the following day. The Saenuri Party decided not to nominate a candidate in the Eunpyeong B constituency on March 28, 2016. Despite this, Lee Jae-oh failed to win re-election, being defeated by Kang Byung-won of the liberal Democratic Party who won with 36.74% of the vote. Kang won re-election in 2020, garnering 57.41% of the vote. Kang was not re-nominated as the Democratic Party's candidate ahead of the 2024 election after being defeated by Kim Woo-young in a party primary. Kim won the general election with 56.95% of the vote, defeating People Power Party challenger Chang Seong-ho by a wide margin.\n\n\n== Boundaries ==\nThe constituency encompasses the neighborhoods of Gusan-dong, Daejo-dong, Jingwan-dong, Bulgwang-dong, and Galhyeon-dong. The constituency is bordered Goyang B to the north and west, Eunpyeong A to the south, and Jongno to the east.\n\n\n== List of members of the National Assembly ==\n\n\n== Election results ==\n\n\n=== 2024 ===\n\n\n=== 2020 ===\n\n\n=== 2016 ===\n\n\n=== 2012 ===\n\n\n=== 2010 (by-election) ===\n\n\n=== 2008 ===\n\n\n=== 2004 ===\n\n\n=== 2000 ===\n\n\n=== 1996 ===\n\n\n=== 1992 ===\n\n\n=== 1988 ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of constituencies of the National Assembly of South Korea\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

After completing high school, she enrolled at St John's College, Cambridge to study architecture.\n\n\n== Environmentalism ==\nTheodora became interested in environmentalism and conservationism after volunteering at a zoological park in Verona. In 2014, she founded the environmentalist organization Green Teen Team Foundation to protect endangered wildlife and encourage youth involvement in conservation efforts.

        "content": "\"The Star\" or \"(Here Comes) The Star\" is a single by Australian pop music singer Ross D. Wyllie, released in September 1969. Written by Johnny Young and produced by Bob Foster for Festival. It reached number one on the Go-Set National Top 40. It was covered by British pop group, Herman's Hermits, as \"Here Comes the Star\", in November, which reached No. 33 on the UK singles chart.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\"The Star\" was released by Ross D. Wyllie in September 1969. Wyllie was the presenter of pop music TV show, Uptight, since October 1967, which was broadcast on ATV-0, Melbourne. He had issued singles both as a solo artist and as front man for the Uptight Party Team. He had a No. 17 hit on Go-Set's National Top 40 in July 1969, with his cover of Ray Stevens' 1963 song, \"Funny Man\". His next single, \"The Star\", is written by singer-songwriter Johnny Young, who was associated with Uptight. Young had previously written two number-one hits, \"The Real Thing\" and \"The Girl That I Love\" (both 1969), for another singer, Russell Morris.\nWyllie's version of \"The Star\" was arranged by John Farrar and produced by Bob Foster for Festival – the latter also produced Uptight. \"The Star\" peaked at number one on the Go-Set National Top 40. It was also released in the United States in November 1969. At the 1969 King of Pop Awards, which were presented during an Uptight episode in that month, Wyllie was a contender for King of Pop alongside Morris but both lost out to Johnny Farnham. Australian musician and music critic Robert Forster, praised three of the best late 1960s pop stars \"Pop singing is an art... it was cathedral-sized: listen to Normie Rowe sing 'It's Not Easy', or [Wyllie] 'The Star', or Colleen Hewett 'Superstar'\".\nWyllie was presented with a gold record, in 2003, for shipment of 35000 units of \"(Here Comes) The Star\". When the song's writer, Young, was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in 2010, by his former Young Talent Time cast mate, Tina Arena, she performed a rendition of \"The Star\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n7\" Single\nRoss D.

        "content": "The 2024 Moscow Victory Day Parade was a military parade held in Red Square, Moscow, Russia, on 9 May 2024, to commemorate the 79th anniversary of Victory Day which celebrates the defeat of Nazi Germany and the end of the Eastern Front of World War II. \n\n\n== Background ==\nVictory Day is a significant secular holiday in Russia that commemorates Germany's surrender in World War II, which marked the end of one of the deadliest conflicts in human history. The holiday celebrates the military might and moral fortitude of the Red Army, which suffered enormous losses in the war, with at least 20 million Soviet citizens losing their lives. Victory Day has been observed annually on May 9 since 1945, and it is one of the most revered and widely celebrated public holidays in Russia, with parades, fireworks, and concerts held across the country.\n\n\n== Parade summary ==\n\nAs light flurries of snow fell on Red Square, over 9,000 different troops from 30 various ceremonial regiments marched past the parade stand, 1,000 of which were involved in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Just like the previous Victory Day parade, the mechanized column section only featured one tank, a T-34-85, but for the first time in three years, aerial units took part in the parade: The Russian Knights aerobatic team flew Su-30 and MiG-29 fighters, followed by six Su-25 jets that emitted smoke in the colors of the Russian flag. As in prior parades, missile launchers, artillery, and ICBMs were shown. During the parade, Russian soldiers were equipped with what appeared to be drone jammers given the fear that there would be Ukrainian attacks during the ceremonies. For the first time since the 2015 Moscow Victory Day Parade, a president from an African nation was invited to the parade, as Umaro Sissoco Embaló of Guinea-Bissau was in attendance.\n\n\n== Putin's speech ==\n\nTwo days after Putin's fifth inauguration as President of Russia, he criticized former Eastern Bloc Soviet satellite states, as well as several other countries formerly occupied by the Soviet Union for the removal of Soviet-era monuments and memorials dedicated to the Russian victory during World War II, saying that they are now dedicating monuments to \"traitors and Hitler's accomplices\", while erasing the history of noble world liberators. He also claimed that the west was trying to forget major battles during the War, and stated that Russia is trying its best to avoid a global conflict, but also will not let itself be threatened.\n\n\n== Foreign dignitaries in attendance ==\nAmongst those in attendance were:\n\n  President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko\n  President of Cuba Miguel Díaz-Canel\n  President of Guinea-Bissau Umaro Sissoco Embaló\n President of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev\n President of Kyrgyzstan Sadyr Japarov\n  President of Laos Thongloun Sisoulith\n President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon\n President of Turkmenistan Serdar Berdimuhamedow\n President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n1945 Moscow Victory Parade\nVictory Day (9 May)\nVictory in Europe Day\nVictory Day Parades\n2024 Kharkiv offensive\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Chain boat navigation on the Main was a special type of ship transport on the Main from 1886 to 1936. Along a chain laid in the river, chain boats pulled themselves upstream with several barges attached. The technology of chain shipping replaced the previous practice of towed shipping, in which the ships were pulled by horses.\n\nAs the canalisation project progressed upstream, the barrages required for this made chain towage more challenging, particularly due to the extended waiting times at the locks. This led to the emergence of a new competitor in the form of the propeller, which was made possible by the greater depth of the navigation channel. The use of diesel engines made the propeller a profitable option. The use of steam engines for the labour-intensive chain navigation became unprofitable, and this method was completely discontinued in 1936.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Before chain boat navigation ===\nThe Main River has a relatively gentle gradient. Until the mean water level correction in the middle of the 19th century, the river was a slow-flowing shallow watercourse with numerous loops, bends, islands and, on occasion, several shallow river arms in close proximity to one another. In contrast, the occurrence of strong floods, particularly during the autumn and spring months, resulted in the flooding of areas, the erosion of riverbanks and sedimentation. Conversely, during the summer months, the water level in the channels, which were typically only half a metre deep, decreased to a few centimetres, resulting in the formation of shallows and sandbanks.\nUpstream, the ship trains were towed by line riders. A typical train consisted of a chain of wooden vessels, each with a carrying capacity of 15 to 30 tonnes. They usually began with a Frankensau or a market boat and continued via Schelche, Schlumper and Nachen to the smallest vessel, the Ankernachen. The towpath often changed banks before the mouths of the tributaries or before steep slopes. At these points, horses and riders had to cross the navigation channel or be ferried across. Downstream, the ships drifted in the water current. Sails were set when the wind was favourable. The cost of towing the mostly empty or lightly loaded ships was high. Therefore, profit could usually only be made when the fairway was sufficiently deep and with fully loaded ships travelling downstream.\nIn 1828, the Stadt Frankfurt was the inaugural paddle steamer to traverse the Main between Mainz and Frankfurt. However, the venture was unsuccessful due to design flaws in the steam engine and the challenging navigation conditions in the heavily silted Main estuary. The trials were terminated as early as 1832. It was not until 1841, following the Free City of Frankfurt's accession to the German Customs Union and the completion of the Taunus Railway line from Frankfurt to Wiesbaden, that steam navigation on the Main resumed. However, it was unable to establish itself for several reasons. Firstly, the unfavourable fairways of the Main at low water levels during the summer months presented a challenge for steamboats with their relatively large draught, particularly given that the promised fairway improvements from the Bavarian state were not implemented to the desired extent. Secondly, the railway, which was constructed at the same time, was more efficient than steamships. It was able to travel at faster speeds and had shorter routes. The waterway from Mainz to Schweinfurt was 88 per cent longer. Furthermore, the railway was able to bypass customs offices, eliminating the need for lengthy waiting periods. It was also exempt from customs duties and tariffs, reducing its financial burden. As early as 1858, the unprofitability of steam navigation with paddle steamers led to the discontinuation of this mode of transport.\n\n\n=== The time of chain boats on the Main ===\n\nAfter navigation on the Main had lost more and more of its transport capacity to the railway and the use of wheeled steam tugs had failed due to the shallow navigation channel of the Main, Heino Held, owner of the Mainz-based forwarding and coal trading company C.J.H. Held & Cie., had the idea of saving navigation by introducing chain tug navigation. On 15 February 1871, he applied to the authorities in Prussia, Bavaria and Hesse for a corresponding licence, encouraged by the companies that had just started up on the Elbe. In 1872, the various states and towns along the Main then established a committee in Aschaffenburg. The committee was supported by Ewald Bellingrath, who had already played a leading role in the introduction of chain navigation on the Elbe and Neckar rivers. The committee discussed the merits of chain shipping and the canalisation of the Main. Mainz, which was part of the Grand Duchy of Hesse, was in favour of chain shipping as it feared that the canalisation of the Main would allow Rhine ships to bring their goods directly to Frankfurt, which would result in Mainz losing its position as a transfer point. Frankfurt, which was then part of Prussia, sought to become a Rhine port and only agreed to the chain once the canalisation to Frankfurt had been completed. The Bavarian state parliament was also opposed to the chain, citing concerns about competition for the Bavarian state railway. Initially, it only approved the chain as far as Aschaffenburg.\nIn 1885, the Hessian joint-stock company Mainkette-AG was granted a concession to operate chain shipping on the Main and through the Rhine to the port of Mainz. The Mainkette-AG laid the chain and the chain boats were built at the Neckar shipyard in Neckarsulm in 1886. The plans for the construction were provided by the company Gebr. Sachsenberg from Roßlau (Elbe), which had already gained many years of experience with the construction of chain boats and also supplied the entire machinery for travelling with the chain to the Neckar. From the Neckar to the Main, the chain ships could be transported directly by water, which would not have been possible from the Elbe. The chain ships were capable of pulling themselves and up to ten attached barges at speeds of around five kilometres per hour.\nThe line between Mainz and Aschaffenburg was inaugurated on 7 August 1886. By October of that year, all three chain boats (Mainkette I-III) were operational on this route. The Fränkische Kurier published a review of the early days of chain navigation:\n\nThat was the time when one day the \"chain boat\" surprised the villages and towns. What a cheer back then! As if an ocean liner had come up the Rhine and Main! [...] Metre by metre, the chain rose from the depths, dripping like an iron snake, rolled across the deck, crawled away, and suddenly it was back again to disappear into the wet element. And the children and old people stood and marvelled.\nIn the following years, Mainkette-AG expanded its fleet of ships with three screw steam tugs. Initially, these were used mainly as feeder boats in Mainz-Kostheim and Frankfurt. However, they were then increasingly used for towing services between Mainz and Frankfurt itself.\n\nIn 1892, the Bavarian government granted the Mainkette-AG's repeated request to extend its chain to Miltenberg, subject to the proviso that it could be cancelled at any time. However, just two years later, the Bavarian government passed a law to establish its own chain navigation on the Main, with the chain being extended to Lohr in the summer of 1895. In the absence of its own chain tugs, the Mainkette-AG was authorised to operate on this section of the river in return for a chain usage fee. From 1895 to 1901, the Hessian Mainkette-AG continued to operate its chain boats on the Bavarian sections of the river as far as Miltenberg or Lohr.\nIn 1898, the Bavarian kingdom established the Königlich Bayerische Kettenschleppschiffahrt-Gesellschaft (KBKS) in Würzburg, which was managed by the Bavarian state railway. The newly established state company was tasked with constructing five chain tug boats, designated K.B.K.S. No. I to V, at the Übigau shipyard in Dresden. The boats were prefabricated at the shipyard, transported by rail to Aschaffenburg, and then riveted together and launched between 1898 and 1900.\nThe Bavarian state built a shipyard near Schweinheim for maintaining its chain ships. It is located below river kilometre 88.8 between the banks of the Main and the former Mainländebahn railway.\nHowever, following the deployment of all new Bavarian chain boats, the Hessian Mainkette-AG was forced to withdraw from Bavaria. The Königlich Bayerische Kettenschleppschiffahrt-Gesellschaft purchased the chain between Aschaffenburg and Miltenberg from the Mainkette-AG and extended it in the following years: 1900 to Kitzingen, 1911 to Schweinfurt and 1912 to Bamberg. The chain reached its greatest length of 396 kilometres. In 1910 and 1911, three additional boats, designated K.B.K.S. No. VI to VIII, were prefabricated in Übigau and assembled in Aschaffenburg. From 1912, eight Bavarian chain tugs were thus travelling between Aschaffenburg and Bamberg.\nThe chain boats were mostly only used for travelling uphill. In 1900, the Aschaffenburger Zeitung described the situation of chain navigation as follows:\n\nIn the month of June, the royal Bavarian chain ships transported 430 vehicles with a carrying capacity of 24,568 tonnes and 4,706 tonnes of cargo upstream in 22 tows. Downstream they towed 4 vehicles with a carrying capacity of 467 tonnes and 28 tonnes of cargo. The revenue for this totalled 8,026 M., 70 Pf.\nFollowing the abdication of King Ludwig III in 1918, the designation K.B.K.S. (Königlich Bayerisches Kettenschiff) was amended to remove the first 'K.' for 'Königlich'. Consequently, the ship number eight was no longer referred to as K.B.K.S.NoVIII, but simply B.K.S.NoVIII. (Bayerisches Kettenschiff Nummero acht). In 1924, the designation was changed to DRG. KS NrVIII (Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft Kettenschiff Nummer acht). Following the 1937 takeover by the Deutsche Reichsbahn, the designation was changed to DR.KS NrVIII (Deutsche Reichsbahn Kettenschiff Nummer 8).\n\n\n=== The end of chain navigation ===\n\nAs the people of Frankfurt were initially interested in the canalisation of the Main as far as their city, the Bavarian state now showed great interest in the canalisation of the Main as far as Aschaffenburg. All goods, in particular the Ruhr coal required to operate the Bavarian state railways, were to be transported there by ship, stockpiled, stored and distributed. This did not affect the state-owned Bavarian chain shipping company operating upstream on the Main, but the Mainz-based company Mainkette-AG had to bear the consequences. The damming of the river led to a greater water depth and, at the same time, a reduction in the flow speed. In particular, the long tows had to be split up at the locks of the barrages and sluiced separately. This could result in delays of up to five hours, as the barges had to be manhandled into and out of the locks.\nThe shift in profitability from chain shipping to propeller-driven vessels was significant. With the progressive canalisation of the Main as far as Aschaffenburg in 1921, the Mainkette-AG was only able to use its screw-driven boats economically and ceased tugboat operations entirely in the early 1930s.\nIn 1935, the Nuremberg Reichsbahn Directorate also had to state the following for the Bavarian route: \"The volume of traffic on the chain tugboat service on the Main has declined extraordinarily in the first half of this year [1935] due to competition from screw boats, so that operations have almost come to a standstill and the question of completely closing down the company must be considered.\" The reason given for this was:\n\nThe screw tugs benefit from the fact that they are considerably cheaper to purchase and operate than the chain boats, despite the greater engine power required. A motorised screw tug of the same power as the chain tugs requires only half the operating crew (3 instead of 6). The entire capital expenditure for the chain and its renewal is eliminated. The screw tugs can also navigate the locks more quickly and easily than the chain boats, and there are no chain breakages. Another significant economic advantage in light traffic is that, as smaller units, they do not have to wait for a large train of ships to arrive and can therefore serve the traffic more quickly, and they can also transport according to the new traffic task that now arises in the water flowing at a much lower current downstream, thus utilising the downstream journey. [...] In addition to the tugboats, motorised barges have also recently been coming up from the Rhine, which therefore require neither screw tugs nor chain tugs.\nAnother disadvantage of chain dragging was the sideways movement of the chain across the river bed, which could result in the chain being pulled into the inside of the bend. This resulted in the chain occasionally dragging large stones into the navigation channel or edging up stones already in place. Furthermore, the chain was not returned to its original position each time it was lifted.\nBavarian chain navigation was completely discontinued in July 1936 and the chain was lifted in 1938. On 14 May 1938, the Fränkische Kurier described the last voyage of a chain boat on the Main:\n\nThe 'Mainkuh' has started its last journey to Bamberg in Aschaffenburg. The whole journey will be a single farewell, because her chain is now leaving the river forever, and everywhere on the Main, not just in the well-known old shipping towns and villages [...] a thousand memories are linked with this Main chain and its 'chain boats'. The Mää-, the Maa-, the Meekuh, as the chain tugboat was christened upstream on the Main, is known to every child on the Main. Even today. But tomorrow it will be part of the history of Main navigation.\n\n\n== The name Mainkuh ==\nThe chain tow had priority over other ships in front of dangerous river sections. These had to turn round and allow the towed convoy to pass. To warn the other ships, the chain ships emitted a loud whistle signal well in advance. Such a signal was also sounded before ships were coupled or uncoupled. If a towed convoy passed the home harbour of the chain tug or one of the barges, signals were also given. The families of the skippers were aware of the convoy's arrival and were able to provide provisions, clothing, and news via small boats, known as \"Nachen.\" The tooting of the chain boats, which sounded like a loud mooing, and the loud rattling of the chains, reminiscent of a cowshed, led to the common name Mainkuh, or, depending on the dialect and pronunciation, the Lower Franconian Määkuh, Meekuh, Frankfurter Maakuh or Meankuh.\n\n\n== Technical description ==\nThe chain boats travelled on a chain laid in the riverbed, which was only fixed in the river at the beginning and end. The bar-less chain consisted of iron links 118 mm long, 85 mm wide and 26 mm thick. The chain's own weight and its natural entanglement with the river bed meant that it could exert a tensile force of around 40,000 newtons (equivalent to around 4,000 kg). Extensions (booms) were attached to the bow and stern of the ship, which could be swung sideways in either direction. The chain was taken out of the river bed via the front boom and guided above deck along the ship's axis to the chain drive in the centre of the ship. Guide rollers ensured that the chain was accurately aligned. From there, the chain ran across the deck to the boom at the stern and back into the river. Thanks to the lateral mobility of the boom and the two rudders mounted fore and aft, it was possible to lower the chain back to the centre of the river, even when the river bent.\n\nEduard Weiß, writing in the journal of the Association of German Engineers, described the ships as follows: \"The appearance of the ship is peculiar in that it is highest in the middle and slopes too much towards the ends to minimise the loss of work caused by the lifting of the towing chain\". This shape is typical of all chain tugs and is optimised for shallow water. The deeper the water, the lower the efficiency, as more and more energy is required to lift the chain from the bottom.\n\t3D reconstructions of the Bavarian chain boat K.B.K.S. No. V\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe chain lasted about 10 to 15 years. Due to the abrasive effect of the sand between the links, the chain broke more frequently. To prevent the chain from being fished up from the bottom using search anchors, catching devices in the form of locking hooks were fitted to the ships' booms to prevent the chain from running away after a chain breakage or while the chain was being repaired.\n\n\n=== The chain ships of Hesse ===\nThe three Hessian ships, designated Mainkette I-III, had a length above deck of 49.80 metres and a breadth at the waterline of 7.05 metres. Apart from the chain drive in the form of a drum winch, they had no other independent propulsion. These ships were therefore dependent on the chain to move up and down the river. Ships meeting had to pass each other in a complicated manoeuvre. First, the chain had to be opened at shackles (called \"chain locks\") spaced 400 metres apart in the chain. Using an auxiliary chain and rope, the downstream ship had to leave the chain and anchor. Once the vessel travelling against the current had passed, the downstream vessel could re-enter the chain with a time loss of approximately 45 minutes.\nThe draught with 20 tonnes of coal on board was 0.60 metres. The ships were powered by an 88 kW (120 hp) steam engine. Typical of this type of ship were two funnels placed side by side. This was because the ship had two boilers, each with one fire. The coal consumption per hour was 3 hundredweights (150 kg).\n\n\n=== The Bavarian chain ships ===\nThe Bavarian chain boats with the designations K.B.K.S. No. I-V were constructed in Übigau and, at 50 metres above deck (equivalent to 46.80 metres at the waterline), were slightly longer than the vessels of the Mainkette-AG. However, the width at the waterline was smaller at 6.40 metres (width above deck 7.40 metres). With a draught of only 0.56 metres, they had a displacement of 147 cubic metres, which equates to their weight in tonnes. With a propulsion power of 95 kW (130 hp) provided by a steam engine, they were able to pull up to 12 barges.\nThe Bavarian chain boats, designated K.B.K.S. No. VI-VIII, were slightly longer at the waterline than the previous version, at 48.00 metres. However, the width at the waterline remained unchanged at 6.40 metres. The steam engines on these ships were capable of 80 kW (110 hp) of propulsion power. Until 1924, the chain grip-wheel used for power transmission was manufactured by Bellingrath. Subsequently, a two-wheel chain wheel was used, around which the chain was looped.\nA distinctive feature of the Bavarian ships was the incorporation of two water turbines, designed by Gustav Anton Zeuner, which served as precursors to the modern water jet propulsion system. This enabled the ship to be steered and to travel downhill without a chain at a speed of approximately 14 kilometres per hour. The additional drive also permitted directional corrections to be made while travelling on the chain, as well as facilitating turning manoeuvres.\nThe Bavarian chain ships were equipped with a single chimney. This feature can be folded down if required. The hull was divided into seven compartments, each separated by a watertight bulkhead. The crew consisted of the captain, a helmsman, two sailors, an engineer and two stokers. The sleeping quarters and cabins were situated on the lower deck. The steering platform was covered with a canvas cover and a sun/rain sail was stretched over it. The steering position was subsequently converted into a wheelhouse.\n\n\n== Model ships ==\n\nA model of a chain boat is on display at the Wörth am Main Maritime and Shipbuilding Museum, along with a piece of the original chain. Additionally, there is a 1:5 scale model of a double winch that winds and unwinds the chain at the touch of a button. A second model of a chain boat is on display in the meeting room of Wörth town hall and can be loaned to other museums and exhibitions if required.\n\nThe model of a chain tugboat on display at the local history museum in Elsenfeld allows the chain to be moved on the model. Additionally, the museum displays an original ship's bell from the Royal Bavarian Chain Steamship No. 4 and a piece of the original chain. Please note that the museum is only open a few days a year.\nThe Museum Stadt Miltenberg and the Schlossmuseum Aschaffenburg also have a model of a chain ship. A piece of the original chain can also be seen in Aschaffenburg.\n\nAnother model (a shipyard model of the K.B.K.S. No. I on a scale of 1:25) is in the possession of the DB Museum in Nuremberg. However, this was only rarely exhibited at the museum. Since April 2010, the model has been on permanent loan in the Guild Hall of Aschaffenburg Castle.\nThe K.B.K.S. No. V chain ship is also available as a 1:250 scale cardboard model.\n\n\n== Germany's last chain ships ==\nThe final surviving example of a Main chain ship was on display in the former raft harbour of Aschaffenburg until March 2009. The Määkuh was used as a restaurant and jetty until the advent of the new millennium. The ship's superstructure had been modified to such an extent that it was no longer recognisable as a chain ship. Subsequently, she was moored in the Erlenbach am Main shipyard and has since been docked at the SMA harbour on the left bank of the Main at Main km 91 in Aschaffenburg, where she has remained since October 2009 (see illustration). The vessel has been dismantled and is no longer afloat. In the autumn of 2009, the associations \"Technikdenkmal Määkuh\" and \"AbaKuZ e. V.\" initiated a campaign to prevent the vessel from being scrapped and to facilitate its subsequent reconstruction in its original form. In 2010, the ship was sold. The ship's hull, with a maximum clearance height of approximately 1.80 metres, was to be used as a café or exhibition space in the immediate vicinity of the castle in the future. However, the city council rejected the plans in 2015. In 2021, the future of the ship remained uncertain. The dimensions of the ship indicate that it belongs to the series K.B.K.S. No. I to V. As a result of its historical significance and exceptional rarity, it was included as a movable monument in Part A – Monuments – Book 71 of the list of monuments – City of Aschaffenburg.\nThe last remaining example of a chain ship that can be identified as such is the Gustav Zeuner, which was used on the Elbe and is now moored in Magdeburg as a museum ship.\n\n\n== Literature ==\nBerninger, Otto. \"Bericht der Reichsbahndirektion Nürnberg vom 7.

It was released theatrically in India on 3 May 2019.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nSharanya Gopinathan of The News Minute called the film \"elegant\" and \"soul-quenching.\" She furher wrote, \"When dealing with a movie as subtle and saturated with beauty as Bornodi Bhoiai, there isn’t really a clear way to trace a specific or linear plot. Thanks to the beauty of its elements, themes and cinematography, you could easily forget that it has or needs a plot at all, and you’d be happy to see it carry on for a couple of hours longer just for the satisfaction it provides the soul.\"\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "ASF17 v Commonwealth of Australia is a 2024 decision of the High Court of Australia. It is an important case in Australian constitutional law.\nThe court held that the plaintiff's indefinite detention under the Migration Act did not exceed the constitutional limitation against detention for a punitive purpose, identified in NZYQ v Minister for Immigration. The plaintiff's detention was held to be justified as being for the non-punitive statutory purpose of removing an alien detainee from Australia. The court viewed that (unlike in NZYQ), deportation of ASF17 was reasonably capable of being achieved. His ongoing detention by the Commonwealth could therefore be authorised by the Migration Act.\nThe plaintiff was a bisexual Iranian man who refused to cooperate with Australian authorities to enable his own deportation to Iran. It had previously been found by a ministerial delegate he didn't have a well-founded fear of persecution; and a lower-court decision had held that ASF17 only alleged a fear of persecution on a narrow factual basis, arising from an incident which the primary judge found didn't actually occur. The High Court accepted the conclusion of the primary judge that ASF17 didn't have a genuine well-founded fear of persecution; and so wasn't eligible for a protection visa, nor would his deportation to Iran be prevented by any non-refoulment obligations within the Migration Act.\nASF17's deportation was held to be reasonably capable of being achieved, were he to decide to cooperate in undertaking the administrative processes necessary to facilitate his own removal to Iran. His cooperation was necessary due to Iran's policy of refusing to accept involuntarily deported citizens.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Adams Oyster Company was an oyster farm and seafood cannery business headquartered in Suffolk, Virginia, and by the 1950s was one of the largest oyster farm businesses in Virginia. The company held over 300 acres of oyster farms in the Nansemond River, Battens Bay, Bleakhorn Creek, Chuckatuck Creek, Cooper Creek, and the James River.\n\n\n== History ==\nBy 1870, oystermen had planted themselves and their families on the peninsula between Chuckatuck Creek and the Nansemond River and drew a livelihood from the water. Members of the Adams family were oysterman in the area by the late 1880s. The Nansemond River was one of the richest oyster grounds in the Chesapeake Bay, and seafood businesses in Suffolk were shipping approximately 75,000 bushels of oysters a year by 1900.\nIn the 1920s, Charles Gray Adams I established an oyster company and oyster shucking house on the Hobson side of Chuckatuck Creek. Adams operated a fleet of over 30 boats out of the creek. Adams died in 1938.\nThe Adams Oyster Company was formally established in the 1940s by Adams' son, Captain Charles Gray \"Charlie\" Adams II and later became a partnership with Carl Bagnell when they merged the holdings with the Nansemond Fish and Oyster Company. The Adams Oysters Company sold oysters at local markets in Norfolk and shipped them to locations throughout the U.S. East Coast. The company also canned and sold a packaged oyster product called \"Saltaire Oysters\" and operated a steamed crab business near the Chuckatuck Creek location.\nBy the 1950s and 1960s, the \"Saltaire Oysters\" brand could be found in Kroger supermarkets, Fass Brothers, or Ballards. The company also sold directly to Colonial Stores and Campbell Soup Company for their canned oyster stew product, and was a certified interstate shellfish dealer. Charles Adams III worked for the company during this period, before being deployed to serve a tour of duty in the Vietnam War. In March 1968, Charles Adams III and three other watermen drowned when the oyster boat Klondike capsized with all four men on board.\nThe business activity had slowed by the end of the 1970s due to the decline of the oyster population and the Army Corps of Engineers construction of a dam on Carter's Clove Creek, which closed Hobson's direct outlet to Chuckatuck Creek and the James River. From the 1980s to the 2010s, the business remained registered as an active oyster farm with the Virginia Marine Resources Commission.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Disappointment Lake (French: Lac Disappointment; formerly known as Mistake Lake) is a lake located in Charlotte County, New Brunswick. It was additionally known by the Passamaquoddy peoples as Esquagamook which translates to \"End Lake\", which they named due to the lake being located at the Lepreau River's head. Disappointment Lake contains brook trout, American eels, lake chubs, and white suckers.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1888, parties from Indiantown secured the lake and improvements were made to the road leading up to it. In the late 1800s, it was leased out and used as a fishing spot. The lake has additionally been used as a fish hatchery spot, with 20,000 speckled trout being hatched in 1952.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of bodies of water of New Brunswick\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "You Won't Go Before You're Supposed To is the third studio album by the American hardcore punk band Knocked Loose. It was released through Pure Noise Records on May 10, 2024, and produced by Drew Fulk. It is the band's first album to feature rhythm guitarist Nicko Calderon.\n\n\n== Background ==\nGuitarist Nicko Calderon joined the band in 2021. The band released an EP titled, A Tear in the Fabric of Life that same year. According to vocalist Bryan Garris:\n\n\"A Tear In The Fabric Of Life’ was the first time that we sat down and wrote with strict intention...So coming back around, figuring out what we should be, and then applying that to a full album was very interesting...We knew we wanted to have a bigger album in scale, and with that in mind, we could expect every single type of Knocked Loose song there is.\"\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe band announced the album and its release of May 10, 2024. The lead single, \"Blinding Faith\", was released on February 27, 2024. The second single, \"Don't Reach For Me\" was released on April 3, 2024. The third single, \"Suffocate\" featuring Poppy, was released on April 23, 2024.\n\n\n== Composition ==\nYou Won't Go Before You're Supposed To has been described as metalcore and hardcore punk.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nYou Won't Go Before You're Supposed To received widespread acclaim upon release. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has an average score of 92 out of 100 based on 6 reviews. Ellis Heasley of Distorted Sound Magazine compared it to Slipknot's Iowa \"in its complete disregard for what a band with this much hype is supposed to do in this situation...and ultimately stands as further irrefutable proof of a truly generational talent.\" Manus Hopkins writing for Exclaim! stated that \"at only 10 songs, with the longest still falling short of five minutes, You Won't Go Before You're Supposed To doesn't wear out its welcome.\" But they felt that \"Slaughterhouse 2\", featuring Chris Motionless, was \"slightly underwhelming in the shadow of its predecessor\", from Motionless in White's album, Scoring the End of the World. Ben Beaumont-Thomas of The Guardian called it \"an indulgently rich record that keeps revealing more on double-digit listens.\" According to Luke Morton of Kerrang!, \"the heaviness throughout is unrelenting. No acoustic number, no ballad, no concession... this isn’t just their best record yet, it’s one of the best albums of the year.\"\nStephen Hill of Metal Hammer of praised Drew Fulk's production stating, [his] production gives the record perfect definition while making it sound as loud as a jet plane taking off inside your cranium.\" Mandy Scythe of MetalSucks wrote, \"From start to finish, this is a solid, heavy record full of memorable and catchy moments that you’ll want to revisit time and time again.\" According, to Ian Cohen of Pitchfork, \"[Knocked Loose have] amplified and concentrated their sound into something so potent that it has its own gravitational pull.\" Dylan Tuck writing for The Skinny wrote, \"You Won't Go Before You're Supposed To takes their staunchly savage sound and dashes it with piercing playfulness and crushing confidence; conjuring a profoundly poisonous record containing some of their most deadly moments to date.\" Sputnikmusic wrote that \"[the] album destroys as much as possible while it’s on...[but] it leaves a little to be desired once it’s over.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nKnocked Loose\n\nBryan Garris – vocals, lyrics\nIsaac Hale – lead guitar, vocals\nNicko Calderon – rhythm guitar, backing vocals\nKevin Otten – bass\nKevin \"Pacsun\" Kaine – drums\nAdditional personnel\n\nPoppy – vocals (3)\nChris Motionless – additional vocals (7)\nTechnical\n\nDrew Fulk – production, mixing\n\n\n== References ==",

It was released in 9 May 2024 through Double P Records, as one of the singles for the former's fourth studio album Éxodo (2024). It is the former's seventh collaboration with Junior H and his second collaboration with the latter after their successful single \"Ella Baila Sola\".\n\n\n== Background ==\nAfter the former released \"Peso Completo\" with Arcángel, Peso Pluma posted a snippet of another single he would release, along with Junior H and Pedro Tovar of Eslabon Armado. He eventually announced the release date for Éxodo on 8 May 2024, through its accompanying teaser which features Irish professional mixed martial artist Conor McGregor. He also announced a single titled \"La Durango\" which would be released the next day.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Chalon Heads is a 1999 crime novel by the Australian author Barry Maitland.\nit was the fourth novel in the author's Brock and Kola series of novels.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe young wife of ex-criminal Sammy Startling has been kidnapped and the ransom note was decorated with Chalon Head stamps of the young Queen Victoria. These stamps are both rare and valuable and detectives Kathy Killa and David Brock go to Cabot's philately store to meet Startling and investigate the crime.\n\n\n== Publishing history ==\nAfter its initial publication in Australia by Allen and Unwin in 1999, it was reprinted as follows:\n\n1999, UK, Orion\n2000, Australia, Allen and Unwin\n2000, UK, Orion\n2001, USA, Arcade\n2002, USA, Penguin\n2007, Australia, Allen and Unwin\n2010, USA, Felony & Mayhem Press\nThe novel was also translated into Russian in 2008.\n\n\n== Epigraph ==\nEpigraph: \"Philately: The term was coined in 1864 by a Frenchman, Georges Herpin, who invented it from the Greek philos, 'love', and ateleia, 'that which is tax-free'. Britannica Online, 1997.\"\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nA reviewer in The Canberra Tmes noted: \"This is a very carefully crafted crime novel that is rich in detail and interesting minor characters. The plotting is suitably serpentine and Maitland keeps us on our toes with some very unexpected turns. The plot unfolds at a good pace, helped along by a couple of well-staged chase scenes and a particularly grisly discovery...Stamp collectors will also probably find the philatelic detail interesting and there is even an Australian angle in the form of the three Chalon Head stamps from Van Diemen's Land which are central to the plot...Overall The Chalon Heads is very good, although Brock lacks the distinctive edge to make him, and the series, stand out from the rest of the very good British police novels that are around.\"\nStuart Coupe in The Sydney Morning Herald was very enthusiastic about the novel: \"The Chalon heads is significantly better than almost all the police procedural novels I've read in recent years, with Maitland displaying an impressive and convincing grasp of the machinations and motivations of working police officers, their strengths, weaknesses and foibles. This novel is right up there with the best contemporary crime fiction and, with Allen & Unwin in Australia and Orion Books in Britain as Mailtand's new publishers, one can but hope the author gains the increased international recognition he so clearly deserves.\"\n\n\n== Awards ==\n2000 Barry Award - Best British Crime Novel finalist\n\n\n== See also ==\n1999 in Australian literature\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2012 Ivorian coup attempt was a failed coup d'état by exiled military officers loyal to former president Laurent Gbagbo to overthrow President Alassane Ouattara's administration in the Ivory Coast. State security seized documents that outlined plans for the eventual overthrow and replacement of the democratically elected leader with a transitional military council.\nIn a public interview to national television, Interior Minister Hamed Bakayoko accused pro-Gbagbo officers and former members of his administration of complicity in the plot to install a transitional military council, disclosing \"We had very specific information that a group of officers in exile in Accra were preparing a military operation in Ivory Coast aimed at destabilizing the country.\" He then proceeded to play a recorded video where a group of uniformed men, led by a spokesman, proclaimed the dissolution of the Ivory Coast's institutions and the establishment of a council for national sovereignty. The spokesman, later identified as Colonel Kate Gnotua, announces in the video, \"All state institutions are hereby dissolved. All political activities are suspended. A curfew has been put in place until further notice.\" The recorded video was intended to be broadcast to national television after the takeover.\nAmong the alleged leaders of the foiled coup plot were Moise Lida Kouassi, former defense minister and key ally of Laurent Gbagbo, and Colonel Kate Gnotua, former senior officer in Gbagbo's presidential guard. Kouassi later had a falling out with Kate Gnotua.\nThe coup plot involved a combination of Liberian mercenaries and Ivorian militias, with ties to Gbagbo's loyalists. The coup attempt was linked to recent violence, including the killing of seven UN peacekeepers, and involved elements from Gbagbo's presidential guard.\nIn the end several of the coup plotters were arrested, including Kate Gnatoa and Kouassi, who acknowledged awareness to the plot, admitting \"The documents that were seized during my arrest at my house in Lome did concern a transition and a crisis communication in Ivory Coast.\" He expresses regret for not informing the authorities sooner and indicated willingness to seek forgiveness from the president for his inaction.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Forrest & Maples was an American slave-trading company based in Memphis, Tennessee, United States during the mid-1850s. The principals, Josiah Maples and Nathan Bedford Forrest, were in business together as Forrest & Maples from July 1854 to December 31, 1855.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn November 1854 Forrest & Maples sold a nine-year-old girl named Page to Lavinia and Lemuel Smith for $600. According to Forrest biographer Jack Hurst:\n\nThe profits of the trade during this era, in which the prices of slaves in the burgeoning Southwest were rising quickly, are indicated by the return on a two-week investment Forrest & Maples made on three—'Ellick aged 30, Rhita aged 40 + her child Ellick 6 years'—purchased from Miss S. I. Stailey on October 16, 1854, for $1,450. On November 2 the firm sold what apparently was the same trio—listed this time in the Shelby County Register's records as 'Ellick age 33, Ritter age 38, Ellick Jr. 5 years old'—to Sam Tate for $ 1,600. Such profit (more than 10 percent in seventeen days) was commonplace, made possible by the economic tenor of the time and place.\nOn July 9, 1855, they sold Adisson, age 22, to V. Beckworth for $1,000. Also in 1855, Forrest & Maples sold Mary, age 15, for $800.\nOne interesting case of a runaway slave ad placed by the firm is told in Chase C. Mooney's Slavery in Tennessee (1957): \"Forrest and Maples offered the largest known reward for one of their escapees. They would pay $500 to the deliverer of Richard—if taken in a free state—a Charleston-reared carpenter about thirty years old who could read and write well\".\nOn New Year's 1856 the Maples and Forrest partnership was dissolved. \n\n\n== See also ==\nForrest's jail\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===",

He was a narrator of Hadith as well as an ascetic.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nWabisa ibn Ma'bad al-Asadi belonged to the tribe of Banu Asad. He converted to Islam between the years 630–631. Wabisa originally settled in Kufa but later moved to Raqqa where he spent the rest of his life and died there in the year 707.\nIn terms of personality, Wabisa was an ascetic who preferred sitting with the poor.\n\n\n== Hadith he narrated ==\nWabisa narrated that Muhammad said:\n\nConsult your soul, consult your heart, oh Wabisa. Righteousness is what is satisfying to your soul and your heart. Sin is what wavers in your soul and causes hesitancy in your chest, even if the people give you a judgment, and again give you a judgment.\n\n\n== Tomb ==\nWabisa died in 707, and was buried in Raqqa, at the site of the Great Mosque of Raqqa. A domed mausoleum was constructed over his purported grave in 1836 during the Ottoman period, but it was ultimately bulldozed and completely razed away in 2014 by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Recent research disputed the attribution of this domed mausoleum to Wabisa, and instead concluded that it was the tomb of Sa'deddin Pasha al-Azm, the Ottoman governor of Raqqa who had died of a plague and was buried in the courtyard of the ruined mosque. The real grave of Wabisa is believed to be located underneath a modern madrasa in the Mishlab neighbourhood of Raqqa.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Sahabah\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Andrew G. L. Whitelaw (born 31 August 1946) is a British neonatologist and academic, known for his work on treating conditions affecting newborn babies. He holds the position of Emeritus Professor at Bristol Medical School, associated with Bristol Neuroscience.\nWhitelaw is a member of the Royal College of Physicians and a Fellow of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. He also served as the president of the Neonatal Society.\nWhitelaw research has over 15,553 citations across 9,919 documents. Additionally, his h-index stands at 61.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nWhitelaw was born in West Fife, Scotland to Robert and Cicely Whitelaw.\nWhitelaw received early education at Commercial Primary School.\n\n\n== Research ==\n\n\n=== Intraventricular Haemorrhage (IVH) and Hydrocephalus in Premature Babies ===\nOne of Whitelaw's notable findings is the efficacy of ventricular lavage in reducing brain injury and disability in post-haemorrhagic hydrocephalus. Ventricular lavage removes toxic substances, such as free iron and pro-inflammatory cytokines, released by old blood.\n\n\n=== Hypoxic-Ischaemic Injury in Full-Term Babies ===\nWhitelaw's research has involved prevention and treatment of hypoxic-ischaemic injury in full-term newborns. He has been one of the pioneers developing and testing cooling by only a few degrees as a therapeutic approach for neonatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy. This intervention (therapeutic hypothermia) has been shown to improve the odds of survival without neurological impairment at 18 months of age.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nRaymond Horton-Smith Prize for the best medical thesis of the year (1978).\nPresident of the Neonatal Society (2006)\nElected member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters (2016)\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\nWhitelaw, Andrew; Jary, Sally; Kmita, Grazyna; Wroblewska, Jolanta; Musialik-Swietlinska, Ewa; Mandera, Marek; Hunt, Linda; Carter, Michael; Pople, Ian (1 April 2010). \"Randomized Trial of Drainage, Irrigation and Fibrinolytic Therapy for Premature Infants with Posthemorrhagic Ventricular Dilatation: Developmental Outcome at 2 years\".

Due to avoiding the war, his family relocated to Jiangjin County, Sichuan (now Jiangjin, Chongqing), where he attended the National No. 9 Middle School (now Jiangjin No. 2 High School). In 1945, he enrolled at Chiao Tung University (now Shanghai Jiao Tong University), majoring in the Department of Electrical Engineering. He joined the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in April 1949.\nAfter university, in 1950, Wang was assigned to Shanghai Electric Motor Factory, where he successively served as design department head, deputy chief engineer, deputy factory director and deputy chief engineer. In 1960, Wang changed his name to Wang Geng. He retired in July 2003. After retirement, he served as a part-time professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.\nOn 8 May 2024, Wang died in Shanghai, at the age of 96.\n\n\n== Contributions ==\nIn 1958, Wang participated in the design scheme and key component creation of the world's first 12000 kW double water-cooled steam turbine generator. In 1985, he won a State Science and Technology Progress Award (First Class) for participating in the creation of a dual water internal cooling steam turbine generator. He participated in the design and trial production of two sets of 80000 kVA AC pulse generator sets for the controlled nuclear fusion reaction research device's strong magnetic field power supply, for which he won a State Science and Technology Progress Award (Third Class) in 1987.\nIn 1983 and 1985, Wang served as the Chinese design leader twice and went to the United States to jointly develop a 300,000 kilowatt water hydrogen cooled steam turbine generator with Westinghouse Electric Corporation. In 1987, as one of the design leaders from the Chinese side, Wang went to Westinghouse Electric Corporation to optimize the design of a 600,000 kilowatt water hydrogen cooled steam turbine generator.\n\n\n== Honours and awards ==\n1985 State Science and Technology Progress Award (First Class)\n1987 State Science and Technology Progress Award (Third Class)\n1991 Member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)\n\n\n== References ==",
