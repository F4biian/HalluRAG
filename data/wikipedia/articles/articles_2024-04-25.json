        "content": "Francisco Almenar Quinzá (27 July 1876 – 7 March 1936) was a Spanish architect and sports leader who served as the 11th president of football club Valencia CF between 1933 and 1936.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nFrancisco Almenar was born on 27 July 1876 in Valencia, as the son of Bernardo Almenar Llácer and Rosario Quinzá Birgón. He married one of the daughters of the architect Antonio Martorell Trilles.\nAlmenar completed his high school studies in Valencia, going to live in Barcelona in 1893 where he studied architecture at the Barcelona School of Architecture, graduating on 27 April 1904.\n\n\n== Architect career ==\nAlmenar was an architect at the service of the State who designed some important works in the city of Valencia. For instance, for the Valencia Regional Exhibition in 1909, he designed the Pavilion for Agriculture and Industry and the Automobile Pavilion, the Circus Theater, and the Great Entrance Arch, all demolished and with an eclectic line.\nAlmenar is also the author of two performance halls that have not survived to this day, the Teatro Martí in 1915 located on the current Paseo de Ruzafa (formerly Pi y Margall) and the Gran Teatro (later Rex cinema) from 1923, located on Marqués de Sotelo Avenue no. 6 and which was demolished in 2003. In 1923, he was also in charge of the construction works of the Mestalla Stadium, the field where Valencia CF played. He directed the works of the Dominican Church on Cirilo Amorós Street in Valencia, executing the project of Joaquín María Arnau Miramón, who died before the church was built. He intervened with Javier Goerlich in the Banco de Valencia building and with José Cort Botí in the Casa de la Caridad.\nHis work is also the building he built on Játiva Street for the Hotel Metropol. He designed several garages in the city, and various residential buildings, such as the Casa Ernesto Ferrer, in the town hall square.\nOn 29 December 1906, Almenar was later appointed academic of the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Carlos de Valencia.\n\n\n== Presidency of Valencia CF ==\nA lifelong fan of football and his team, he was elected president of Valencia CF on 3 November 1935, but a few months later he died from a heart attack, so his time as president of the football club was short-lived. At the time of his death, Francisco Almenar was dean of the College of Architects of Valencia and Knight of the Order of Charles III.\n\n\n== Death ==\nAlmenar died in Valencia on 7 March 1936, at the age of 59. An architect by profession, he has a street in the city labeled with his name: Arquitecto Almenar.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Luis Casanova Giner (15 December 1908 – 4 May 1999) was a Spanish sports leader who served as the 12th president of football club Valencia CF, including two mandates in an interim basis in 1936, and one full mandate that lasted for nearly 20 years, between 1940 and 1959, in which the club won half of its fourteen national titles: Three league titles (1941–42, 1943–44, and 1946–47), three Copa del Reys (1941, 1949, and 1954), and one Copa Eva Duarte in 1949. He invested most of his own capital in the club, especially in the rebuilding of a war-torn Mestalla Stadium, to carry out a project that became personal. He is thus widely regarded as one of the most important presidents of Valencia, with his 19 years in charge remaining unmatched.\nHe was also known for being president of Cifesa, one of the most important film companies in the world at the time, which produced the best Spanish-American blockbusters of the time, turning the company, and Valencia (its headquarters), into Spanish Hollywood from the early 1940s until the mid-60s.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nLuis Casanova Giner was born on 15 December 1908 in Oliva, Valencia, into a wealthy family of industrialists. As a teenager, he was sent to London to study in one of the most important centers of the time. There he developed a deep interest in football, falling in love with the sport, and such was his passion that during his years in the British capital, he became a member of Arsenal F.C. because he had been captivated by the innovative spirit of Arsenal, a pioneer in installing artificial lighting in its Highbury fiefdom. Although he played football from an early age, his physical conditions made him give up his attempts to become a player.\n\n\n== Valencia CF ==\n\n\n=== First steps ===\nUpon his return to Valencia, he joined the ranks of his hometown club, Valencia FC, getting involved in its social life and thus becoming a member of the club in March 1934. He experienced promotion to the First Division as a member and later, now more closely linked to the board, witnessed the 1934 Spanish cup final, in which Valencia lost 1–2 to Real Madrid.\nOn 9 June 1935, Casanova Giner was appointed as the vice president of the club under the presidency of Francisco Almenar, a position that allowed him to become president on an interim basis in 1936 after the sudden death of Almenar from a heart attack. He became acting president when Valencia had the responsibility of organizing and hosting the 1936 Spanish Cup final between Real Madrid and FC Barcelona, the very first El Clásico final.\nDuring the Spanish Civil War, he remained closely linked to football, which led him to occupy the vice presidency again when, at the end of the Civil War, the club was reorganized. In those difficult moments, his work and financial contribution were essential; in fact, he delayed the date of his wedding by investing all his capital in the reconstruction of the Mestalla Stadium, which had been devastated during the war, doing it so alongside Eduardo Cubells, Luis Colina, the then president Alfredo Giménez and General Aranda, military governor of Valencia, in order to get the players who made up the Levante Mobile Park Recovery Army team.\n\n\n== Presidency ==\nAmong these players were Álvaro, Carlos Iturraspe, Mundo, and Vicente Asensi, the basis of Valencia's best team in its entire history. In 1940, Casanova Giner took charge of the club after the departure of Alfredo Giménez's military command that led the club during the war, and under his leadership, Valencia was League champion three times: 1941–42, 1943–44 and 1946–47; as well as three-time runner-up: 1947–48, 1948–49 and 1952–53; along with three Generalissimo Cup titles: 1941, 1949 and 1954, and four times finalist: 1944, 1945, 1946 and 1952. The club also won the Eva Duarte Cup in 1949 and played in the 1948 final. In addition to his sporting success, he also created CD Mestalla, the club's second team (now known as VCF Mestalla).\nWhen Casanova entered Mestalla to serve as president, he rarely sat in the stands since he wanted to be close to the grass, with the coaches.\n\n\n== Pros-presidency ==\nOn 25 January 1959, Casanova Giner presented his irrevocable resignation and was replaced as president by Vicente Iborra. This decision was motivated by a complicated and ambitious remodeling of the stadium, aggravated by the flood of 1957.\nOn 23 August 1969, the club assembly agreed to name the Mestalla stadium after Luis Casanova, and so it was until the arrival of Francisco Roig to the presidency, who in 1994 returned the popular name to the sports venue.\n\n\n== Cinematic career ==\nThe Valencian Casanova family ties to cinema date back to the early 1930s when his brother Manuel founded the Compañía Industrial del Film Español (Cifesa) in 1932. Under Luis's presidency, Cifesa produced highly successful films at the box office and had the widest staff of directors at his service and stated his origin at the beginning of each film with the music of the Serrano Anthem. In the 1960s, it fell, among other reasons because he made a large outlay for the rights to Visconti's La Dolce Vita and the regime did not allow its exhibition.\nNotably, Sara Montiel, the most internationally popular and highest-paid star of Spanish cinema in the 1960s, came to cinema thanks to the Casanovas, when Vicente, another brother of Luis, heard her sing a saeta in Orihuela and decided to gave her a singing teacher and launch her acting career.\n\n\n== Death ==\nCasanova Giner died in his birthplace in Oliva of natural causes on 4 May 1999, at the age of 90.\nHe married Pilar Iranzo Loygorri, and the couple had at least one son, Luis Casanova Iranzo, founder of Caster Alimentación, even considered running for president of the club, but ultimately did not do so and the Casanova family separated from the entity after its reconversion into a sports limited company in the early 1990s. His son died on 22 October 2021, at the age of 85.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Jordan Boyd (born 22 September 1998) is a professional Australian rules footballer playing for the Carlton Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL).\n\n\n== Early career ==\nBoyd played his junior football for Western Region Football League club Spotswood. He went through the Maribyrnong Sports Academy's AFL program, and worked through the reserves to become a senior player at Spotswood by 2018 – which even he believed at the time was the highest level his football career would reach. Throughout his junior career, he was never a part of the AFL's elite talent junior pathways and never played in the NAB League – something which was very rare among footballers who played in the AFL in the 2020s.\nIn 2019, Boyd was given a chance to play with Footscray (the Western Bulldogs reserves team) in the Victorian Football League. He played games with Footscray until mid-2021.\n\n\n== AFL career ==\nBoyd was drafted to the AFL by Carlton at No. 20 in the 2021 mid-season rookie draft. He played his first AFL game in round 3 of the 2022 season, playing seven games that year before two foot fractures ended his season. He returned to the senior team in round 10 of the 2023 season, playing nine games.\nFrom as early as his time at Spotswood, Boyd's greatest strength was noted as his long, accurate kicking. He began his senior career as a medium forward, but by 2023 was being used primarily as a rebounding defender.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJordan Boyd's profile on the official website of the Carlton Football Club\nJordan Boyd at AustralianFootball.com \nJordan Boyd's playing statistics from AFL Tables",

        "content": "Designed by architect Walter Booser “Chip” Detweiler in 1973 to be his private residence, Detweiler House, on Round Top Drive in Honolulu, Hawaii is a seamless blend of Tropical Modernism and Brutalist styles. The house was built by Waialea Builders, with structural engineer Richard M. Libbey.\n\n\n== Design elements ==\nPerched on a 45 degree hillside with sweeping views of the city of Honolulu, Detweiler's design for the small two-bedroom house is simple and elegant. The clean lines of the house's stacked horizontal levels are intersected by sweeping vertical planes. Detweiler's work was influenced by Frank Lloyd Wright, his desire for the house to fit into Wright's organic style is evident in this design. Detweiler held to the architectural tenet of “truth to materials”, with his choice of palette, his unfinished treatment of construction materials such as concrete and rough-hewn lumber throughout the house, and his use of indigenous materials such as volcanic rock and redwood.\nAn aspect of Detweiler's design that draws on the unique site is an ingeniously designed air circulation system. Detweiler planned the building's design being conscientious of air circulation in the tropical climate. Banks of clerestory windows with cantilevered glass run along the uphill (northeast oriented) side of the house and downhill (southwest oriented) facades of the house; other window-type openings have louvered wooden jalousie blinds. This system channels the Hawaiian trade winds through the house, cooling it naturally and eliminating the need for any mechanical system.\nDetweiler lived in the house—first with his wife, Virginia (Ginny) Detweiler, and then later with his professional and life partner designer Dian Cleve until he died in 1984. A series of subsequent owners made alterations to the house, including sealing off window openings which thwarted the intended air circulation as designed by Detweiler, and adding giant floor-to-ceiling mirror panels to the interior.\n\n\n== Restoration ==\nIn 2020, Vilcek Foundation President Rick Kinsel purchased Detweiler House, and worked with architects and artists to restore the house to Detweiler's intended vision using Detweiler's archive of drawings. In addition to removing the mirror panels and re-opening the sealed windows, Kinsel had both interior and exterior woodwork meticulously sanded back and refinished board by board, and the original electrical plan and furniture placement reinstated, as well as other projects that brought the house back the architect's original design and intention.\n\n\n== Recognition and awards ==\nDetweiler House's innovative design was recognized during Chip Detweiler's lifetime, winning an American Institute of Architects-Sunset Magazine Merit Award in 1978. In 2022, after Kinsel's restoration, the house won a project award from the Historic Hawaii Foundation; In 2023, it was an Editor's Pick for the 2023 Architect's Newspaper Best of Design Award in residential restoration, and was also accepted for inclusion on the Hawaii State Historic Register.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Microplastics remain a major problem for environmental health in Haiti, particularly their presence in a large quantity of water sources.\n\n\n== Origins ==\nHaiti does not have collective storage for plastic and other waste, and thus plastic is often disposed of in urban water evacuation canals, which then degrade to form microplastics. These microplastics, which are fragments of plastic invisible to the naked eye, enter the natural environment and contaminate soils, rivers and oceans. Microplastics refer to all plastic particles whose diameter is less than 5 millimeters.\n\n\n== Effects on the environment ==\nMicroplastics are emerging contaminants and their impacts on the aquatic and terrestrial environment are causing increasing concern. Microplastic contamination can have both beneficial and detrimental effects on soil properties. Additionally, microplastics have been shown to interact with a wide range of contaminants, including pesticides, persistent organic pollutants, heavy metals, and antibiotics, and can act as a vector for contaminant transfer in terrestrial environments.\nMicroplastics and their associated chemicals can be transferred through food webs and accumulate across multiple trophic levels, leading to potentially adverse health effects in humans and other organisms. Although several studies have focused on the occurrence and impacts of microplastic contamination in marine environments, their sources, fate, transport, and effects in terrestrial environments are less studied and poorly understood.\nMicroplastic pollution in the environment is closely determined by surrounding industrial and human activities. In light of pollutant control, it is important to trace the source and behavior of microplastics from terrestrial ecosystems. Freshwater systems can directly receive microplastics from several primary sources, such as manufacturing processes and landfill operations. Microplastics have been reported in fresh water from lakes, rivers and wastewater treatment plants. Pollution sources, anthropogenic impacts and hydrodynamics have been shown to potentially influence the rate at which microplastics accumulate and are transported. Although the proportion of plastics from wastewater in fresh water is largely unknown, effluents from industrial and domestic sources contribute significantly to microplastic pollution.\n\n\n== Measures and actions to mitigate the impact of microplastics ==\nOn August 9, 2012, the Hatian government published a decree prohibiting the production, importation, marketing and use, in any form whatsoever, of polyethylene bags and expanded polystyrene objects for foodstuffs. individual. However, 14 Caribbean countries (more than a third) have banned single-use plastic bags and/or polystyrene containers. \nOn July 10, 2013, a second decree was published to once again prohibit “the importation, production or sale of expanded polystyrene articles for food use.” In support of the second decree, the ministries of the Environment, Justice and Public Security, Trade and Industry as well as the Economy and Finance announced in a note published in January 2018 that specialists from the brigade will be deployed on the territory to force the application of the said decree.\n\n\n== Development of alternative solutions ==\nThe presence of miscroplastic in water poses a threat to the water and wastewater treatment technologies used. One solution to avoid the negative impact of microplastics on the performance of water processes would be to reduce the number of microplastics reaching these units. Which involves cleaning up plastic waste in natural environments and opting for biocompatible plastics, plastic degradation methods. For most scientists and policymakers, cleaning up the oceans is not an economic or logistical task. The further upstream the mitigation is, the greater the possibility of collecting more plastic with less degradation. Completely avoiding the production of new plastics wherever possible is the best solution and reliable way to avoid the generation of microplastics, whether primary (necessary for the production of new plastic items) or secondary (resulting from the breakdown of larger plastic objects). Collectively, all of these strategies help reduce leakage of low-value, single-use products.\nAlthough several strategies have been proposed to reduce environmental contamination by microplastics from wastewater, reduction at source appears to be the most effective method.\n\n\n== References ==",

In 1969 he wrote the song \"Hej, Hej\" which was later covered in 1978 by rock band Drugi način as \"Prođe ovaj dan.\" In 1973 he wrote the song \"Jefimija\" for the group Lutajuća Srca, which won the Union of Composers of Yugoslavia Award that year. The song was inspired by the life of medieval Serbian poet Jefimija. At the time Salković was in a relationship with the lead singer of Lutajuća Srca, Spomenka Đokić. He dedicated the song to her. \nIn 2006 \"Jefimija\" was ranked No. 94 on the B92 Top 100 Domestic Songs list.\n\n\n== Death ==\nSalković enjoyed recreational flying. In July 1989 while in Split, Croatia, he had an accident while piloting a glider. He died on 20 July 1989.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDženan Salković discography at Discogs\nDženan Salković at IMDb",

        "content": "Natascha M. Förster Schreiber (born 1970) is an astronomer specializing in near-infrared spectroscopy of early galaxies. Born in Canada, and educated in Canada and Germany, she has worked in France, The Netherlands, and Germany. She is a researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Garching, Germany, near Munich.\n\n\n== Education and career ==\nFörster Schreiber is originally from Canada, where she was born in 1970. She grew up near Montreal, and she became interested in astronomy through a summer program in high school. She completed a bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics at the Université de Montréal in 1992, and continued there for a master's degree in physics in 1995. Her master's thesis, jointly supervised by Daniel Nadeau and René Doyon, concerned infrared observations of Messier 82. Next, she went to Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich in Germany for doctoral study in astrophysics. Continuing her work on M82, she completed a doctorate (Dr. rer. nat.) in 1999. Her dissertation, Near infrared imaging spectroscopy and mid-infrared spectroscopy of M82: revealing the nature of star formation activity in the archetypal starburst galaxy, was advised by Reinhard Genzel; the American Astronomical Society also lists Linda Tacconi as a co-advisor.\nShe became a postdoctoral researcher in France, at the Direction des Sciences et de la Matière of CEA Paris-Saclay, from 1998 to 2000, and then in The Netherlands, at the Leiden Observatory, from 2000 to 2004. She joined the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics as a research associate in 2004, and became a tenured senior scientist there in 2013.\n\n\n== Research ==\nAfter early work on starburst galaxies such as M82, Förster Schreiber's research interests shifted to high-redshift galaxies, which provide a view of the universe at a much earlier time in its evolution. Her observations include both in-depth studies of individual galaxies and large-scale surveys of many galaxies. Through this work, she has found an unexpectedly rapid maturation of galaxies, producing a high population of massive and quenched galaxies and well-structured spiral galaxies in the early universe, and investigated the effects of galactic superwinds on star formation. Her contributions also include work on the instrumentation needed for these observations, including the Extremely Large Telescope under construction in Chile for the European Southern Observatory.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nFörster Schreiber's research at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics was funded from 2004 to 2008 by a Balzan Fellowship, and from 2008 to 2012 by a Minerva Fellowship of the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research. In 2019 she was given an honorary doctorate by the University of Bath in England.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHome page",

        "content": "Article 6ter of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property provides special provisions for the protection of state emblems, official hallmarks, and emblems of intergovernmental organizations against unauthorized registration and use as trademarks. Article 6ter is an integral part of international trademark law and is aimed at preventing the misuse of emblems that have national or international significance. It does not generate a trademark right, or any other type of intellectual property right, over the signs that are covered by that provision.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Paris Convention, established in 1883 and still in force in 2024, is one of the first intellectual property treaties. It was created to provide a unified system that offers protection of industrial property, including patents, trademarks, and industrial designs, among its member countries. Article 6ter was added to the Convention in 1925 during the revision conference held in The Hague.\n\n\n== Provisions ==\nSigns to which Article 6ter applies are of three types and covered by article 6ter(1), article 6ter(2) and article 6ter(3).\n\n\n=== Article 6ter(1): State armorial bearings, flags and other State emblems ===\nThis subsection prohibits the unauthorized registration and use of state emblems, official signs, and hallmarks indicating control and warranty, from countries of the Union, in trademarks. It mandates that member states refuse or invalidate the registration of a trademark containing such emblems, except where authorized by the competent authorities of the country concerned.\nState emblems generally constitute the symbol of the sovereignty of a State. They frequently contain heraldic elements, such as a lion, an eagle, the sun, etc. It is understood that the category of “other State emblems” comprises the escutcheons of reigning Houses, as well as emblems of States included in a Federative State. However, emblems of lower public bodies (such as municipalities) and signs adopted for a limited period of time (for instance, for the celebration of a State anniversary) are not covered.\n\n\n=== Article 6ter(2): Official signs and hallmarks indicating control and warranty adopted by States ===\nThis clause extends the protection to emblems, abbreviations, and names of international intergovernmental organizations, provided these are communicated to the member states through the International Bureau of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). Similar to state emblems, these cannot be registered or used without proper authorization.\nThe purpose of official signs and hallmarks indicating control and warranty is to certify that a State or an organization duly appointed by a State to that effect has checked that certain goods meet specific standards or have a given level of quality. Official signs and hallmarks indicating control and warranty exist in several States with respect to precious metals or products such as butter, cheese, meat, electrical equipment, etc. In principle, official signs and hallmarks indicating control and warranty may also apply to services, for instance those relating to education or tourism, etc. Only signs and hallmarks adopted by a State itself are eligible for the application of Article 6ter.\n\n\n=== Article 6ter(3): Armorial bearings, flags, emblems, names, and abbreviations of IGOs of which one or more States party to the Paris Convention are members ===\nUnder this provision, the countries of the Union undertake to prohibit the unauthorized use of emblems and names which are of such a nature as to mislead the public about the existence of a connection between the user and the organizations mentioned in Article 6ter(2).\nThe protection does not extend to signs of IGOs which are already the subject of international agreements in force, intended to ensure their protection. Examples of such agreements are the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces (1949) which protects the emblems of the Red Cross, or the Nairobi Treaty on the Protection of the Olympic Symbol (1981).\n\n\n== Procedure ==\nThe procedure for invoking Article 6ter protection involves a state party to the Paris Convention or an intergovernmental organization of which one or more member States are party to the Paris Convention, notifying WIPO of the emblems or marks it wishes to protect.\nWIPO then communicates this information to all member countries in the form of a semi-annual electronic publication in the Article 6ter Express Database on the WIPO website.\nUnder each record of the database, the category of the sign concerned, as well as the entity (State or IGO) having requested its communication, is published in English and French, together with the reproduction of the sign and any relevant information (contact details, classification of the figurative elements, etc.).\nThe date of publication, also mentioned in the record, is considered to constitute the date of receipt of the communication by any party bound to apply Article 6ter. Consequently, the time periods provided for in Article 6ter(4) and (6) of the Paris Convention are calculated as of that date of publication.\nThe countries must then take measures to prevent the use or registration of trademarks that include or imitate these emblems.\nHowever, after publication of the signs, any party bound to apply Article 6ter may, within a period of twelve months following the date of publication, issue an objection to the protection of a particular sign (Article 6ter(4)).\nThe following are examples of grounds on which objections have been based:\n\nthe sign is not a symbol of sovereignty of the communicating State\nthe sign does not constitute a hallmark for products\nthe sign pertains to a lower entity\nan earlier trademark right is already protected in the jurisdiction\nInformation concerning objections (the name of the objecting State and the date of the objection) is reflected in the bibliographical data of the sign, in the Article 6ter Express Database.\nA party that issued an objection is not under an obligation to apply Article 6ter to the sign concerned. Protection of such a sign in the parties that did not issue an objection is not affected.\n\n\n== Implications and enforcement ==\nEach member country is responsible for implementing Article 6ter into their national law, which can involve legislation, administrative procedures, or both.\n\n\n== Challenges ==\nDespite its intentions, the application of Article 6ter can be challenging. The determination of what constitutes an emblem of an international organization and the scope of \"misleading\" can be subjective and vary between jurisdictions. Moreover, enforcement relies heavily on the vigilance and legal frameworks of individual member states.\n\n\n== Search ==\nThe Article 6ter Express Database is a publicly available and free-of-charge database, which allows for the search of any sign that has been communicated under that provision (including withdrawn signs). Searches can be made by State, name of the requesting entity, category of the signs, Vienna Classification or Circular number (for signs communicated before March 2009). The database does not constitute a registry, but merely an information tool.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Article 6ter Express Database:  https://6ter.wipo.int/struct-search\nArticle 6ter at the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)\nParis Convention articles : https://www.unido.org/sites/default/files/2014-04/Paris_Convention_0.pdf",

        "content": "Israël-J.-D. Landry (December 1, 1843 – April 22, 1910) was a Canadian writer, teacher, musician, and publisher. He is known for founding the first French-language Acadian newspaper Le Moniteur acadien. In 1955 he was declared a Person of National Historic Significance as part of the Acadian Men of Letters.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nLandry was born on December 1, 1843, in Dorchester, Canada East, Province of Canada, British North America (present day Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, Canada) as the eldest son to Jean-Misaël Maynard, a farmer, and Constance Bélanger. He was baptized as Jean-Misaël Maynard on December 2, 1843, at the Church of St. John the Evangelist. He was likely educated at the Petit Seminare de Montreal as an Israël Ménard was enrolled there in 1857 and 1858.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1862, Landry moved to Rustico, Prince Edward Island to work with Father George-Antoine Bellecourt. There he worked at the Rustico School for two years, serving as its principal. He also took special attention in teaching music and voice and serving as both an organist and choirmaster. He was also involved in a youth brass orchestra which was well renowned on the island. In Rustico is where he became interested in the efforts of the Acadians to protect their language.\nHe then moved to Chatham, New Brunswick, where he was the organist for St. Michael's Basilica and a music teacher. In March 1867 he wrote and published a prospectus for a French-language newspaper. Landry then moved to Shediac and on July 8, 1867, he published the first issue of Le Moniteur acadien. Le Moniteur was the first French-language newspaper published in the Maritimes. The paper was successful and published weekly issues, and still publishes as of 2024.\nLater in 1867, he ran in the first Canadian general election as the Conservative candidate for the seat of Westmorland. He was defeated by Liberal candidate Albert James Smith.\nIn 1868, Landry suspended publication of the newspaper for financial reasons and later sold it to its publisher, F.-X.-N.-Norbert Lussier. He then moved to Saint John to work as an organist and choir conductor at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception. While in Saint John he opened a music store where he sold instruments and sheet music. He also published music, including some of his own compositions, in a monthly publication named Landry's Musical Journal. Copies of his music were included in the Canadian Musical Heritage Society and later Library and Archives Canada.\n\n\n== Personal life and death ==\n\nLandry was called Israël Maynard (or Ménard) from an early age. He changed his name from Jean-Misaël Maynard to Israël Landry around his arrival at Rustico.\nEarly in his career he was known as Mr. Landry of Montreal, and later as Israel J. D. Landry, Editor-Owner once he began publishing Le Moniteur acadien. \nHe married Ellen \"Ella\" McGourty on November 16, 1869, in Saint John, New Brunswick. Together they had two children, daughter Geneviève Landry (born August 1870) and son John Aimé Landry (12 July 1872 – September 1873).\nLandry died in Saint John on April 22, 1910, at the age of 66.\n\n\n== Awards and honours ==\nIn 1955 Landry was declared a Person of National Historic Significance as part of the Acadian Men of Letters. The Men of Letters also includes Pascal Poirier, Placide Gaudet, John Clarence Webster, and Ferdinand Robidoux.

        "content": "Pontiere (\"Bridgeman\") was a Soldato-class (\"Soldier\"-class) destroyer of the Italian Regia Marina (Royal Navy). Commissioned in 1910, she served in World War I. Reclassified as a torpedo boat in 1921, she was stricken in 1929.\n\n\n== Design ==\nPontiere was powered by two sets of triple expansion steam engines fed by three Thornycroft water-tube boilers, producing an estimated 6,000 indicated horsepower (4,474 kW) and driving two propeller shafts. As built, she could reach a maximum speed of 28.5 knots (52.8 km/h; 32.8 mph). Her fuel capacity of  65 tonnes (64 long tons) of fuel oil gave her a range of 1,600 nautical miles (3,000 km; 1,800 mi) at 12 knots (22 km/h; 14 mph). She was fitted with four 76-millimetre (3 in)/40 calibre guns and three 450-millimetre (17.7 in) torpedo tubes.\n\n\n== Construction and commissioning ==\nPontiere was laid down on 18 November 1905 at the Gio. Ansaldo & C. shipyard in Genoa, Italy. She was launched on 3 January 1910 and completed on 11 February 1910. She was commissioned in 1910.\n\n\n== Service history ==\nPontiere ran aground on a rock off Sardinia on 14 September 1911. She was salvaged, repaired at Taranto, and relaunched 1 November 1913.\nWorld War I broke out in 1914, and Italy entered the war on the side of the Allies with its declaration of war on Austria-Hungary on 23 May 1915. At the time, Pontiere, under the command of Capitano di corvetta (Corvette Captain) Mancini, was the flagship of the 4th Destroyer Squadron, based at Brindisi, which also included her sister ships Alpino, Ascaro, Carabiniere, and Fuciliere and the destroyer Zeffiro. On 29 May 1915 Pontiere, Alpino, and their sister ship Corazziere provided support to a formation of destroyers composed of Artigliere, Bersagliere, Garibaldino, and Lanciere as it bombarded the Adria Werke chemical plant in Monfalcone, a production site for poison gases. The ships carried out another bombardment of the Adria Werke on 7 June 1915.\nAt 19:00 on 8 June 1916 Pontiere departed Vlorë (known to the Italians as Valona) in the Principality of Albania with the protected cruiser Libia and the destroyers Espero, Impavido, and Insidioso to escort the armed merchant cruiser Principe Umberto and the troopship Romagna, which together had embarked the 2,605 men of the Italian Royal Army′s (Regio Esercito′s) 55th Infantry Regiment for transportation to Italy. The convoy had traveled only a short distance when the Austro-Hungarian submarine U-5 hit Principe Umberto in the stern with two torpedoes. Principe Umberto sank in a few minutes about 15 nautical miles (28 km; 17 mi) southwest of Cape Linguetta with the loss of 1,926 of the 2,821 men on board, the worst naval disaster of World War I in terms of lives lost. The escorting warships rescued the survivors but could not locate and counterattack U-5.\nOn 11 February 1917 Pontiere — now under the command of an officer named Cappelli — Alpino, Carabiniere, Fuciliere,  the torpedo boats 19 OS, 20 OS, 21 OS, and 22 OS, and six French airplanes provided escort and support to a group of two French and three Italian seaplanes as the seaplanes conducted a reconnaissance of the Austro-Hungarian Navy base at Pola.\nOn the night of 13–14 August 1917 Pontiere left Venice with Carabiniere and the destroyers Animoso, Ardente, Audace, Francesco Stocco, Giovanni Acerbi, Giuseppe Cesare Abba, Giuseppe Sirtori, and Vincenzo Giordano Orsini to intercept an Austro-Hungarian force made up of the destroyers Dinara, Reka, Sharfschutze, Streiter, and Velebit and six torpedo boats which had supported an air raid against the fortress of Venice. Only Vincenzo Giordano Orsini managed to make brief and fleeting contact with the Austro-Hungarian ships before they escaped.\nOn 24 September 1917 Pontiere, Carabiniere, and Zeffiro got underway from Venice to intervene in a clash between the Italian coastal torpedo boats 9 PN, 10 PN, 11 PN, and 12 PN and four Austro-Hungarian Navy destroyers. The battle ended following the intervention of Italian aircraft, and the Austro-Hungarian destroyers withdrew before the Italian destroyers could engage them.\nBy late October 1918, Austria-Hungary had effectively disintegrated, and the Armistice of Villa Giusti, signed on 3 November 1918, went into effect on 4 November 1918 and brought hostilities between Austria-Hungary and the Allies to an end. World War I ended a week later with an armistice between the Allies and the German Empire on 11 November 1918.\n\n\n=== Post-World War I ===\nPontiere was reclassified as a torpedo boat on 1 July 1921. She was stricken from the naval register on 1 July 1929. and subsequently scrapped.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nFavre, Franco. La Marina nella Grande Guerra.

        "content": "Ganmianpi, (Pinyin: Gǎn Miàn Pí, Simplified Chinese: 擀面皮, Traditional Chinese: 擀麵皮) is a type of Chinese noodle dish. The best-known version is made in Qishan County, Baoji City, Shaanxi Province. There are many varieties of Mianpi, which can be categorized into rolled, steamed, and griddled types.\n\n\n== History ==\nLegend has it that during the reign of Emperor Kangxi, a villager named Wang Tongren from Bamuchi Village, north of Qishan, worked in the imperial kitchen specializing in making Mianpi. As it was made with wheat flour and served as a royal dish in the capital, it was called \"Yu Jing Fen\" (Imperial Capital Flour). After Wang Tongren returned to his hometown in his old age, he focused on running a Mianpi snack business, gradually spreading it throughout the Guanzhong region, making it a famous delicacy in Baoji\n\n\n== Recipe ==\nThe production process of Mianpi is complex. It is also found in Henan, Shanxi, and other regions. During production, wheat flour is first washed with water to extract \"noodle water,\" which is essentially starch water. The mixture is then steamed in a steamer and rolled out with a rolling pin. The main seasoning is locally made chili oil, supplemented with gluten washed out from wheat flour, which has a high protein content. The gluten strands in rolled Mianpi are different from those in steamed Mianpi. The difference lies in the fact that the \"top\" is boiled in water rather than steamed. After cooking, the noodles are torn by hand and mixed evenly in a small pot (a pot without a stove). The main characteristic of this dish is that the surface of the cold noodles has indentations that can hold the chili oil, and the chewy gluten strands serve as a substitute for meat.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Satanoperca lilith, also known as the one-spotted eartheater or Lilith's eartheater, is a large species of eartheater cichlid endemic to blackwater rivers in Brazil, in the states of Amazonas, Pará, and Roraima. It is widely distributed throughout the northern Amazon basin.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe holotype specimen of this species, catalogued by the Museum of Zoology of the University of São Paulo's natural history collection as MZUSP 33003, was collected on October 6th, 1979, in the Rio Negro drainage of Brazil.\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe generic name of this species, Satanoperca, is a portmanteau of Satan and perca (Latin for \"perch\"). The specific name is a matronym dedicated to Lilith, a female demon in Mesopotamian and Jewish folklore, and was given as an allusion to its close relationship with Satanoperca daemon.\nIn Brazil, this species is commonly known as the acará bicudo, cará, cará-bicudo, and cará-pucu.\n\n\n=== Evolutionary history ===\nPhylogenetic analysis indicates that closest known relative of this species is Satanoperca daemon. Together with Satanoperca acuticeps, they form a morphologically distinct species group within the genus Satanoperca, characterized by the presence of a large, ocellated spot on the dorsal side of their caudal peduncle.\n\n\n== Description ==\nSatanoperca lilith is one of the largest species in Satanoperca, on average measuring 14 cm (5.5 in) standard length (SL), with a maximum recorded length of 25.5 cm (10.0 in) SL. It is only exceeded in length by Satanoperca jurupari, which can grow up to 26 cm (10 in) SL. The easiest way of distinguishing Satanoperca lilith from related species is the presence of a single dark blotch on its flanks, which is situated on or above scales 11–13 of its lateral line. Satanoperca daemon has two, Satanoperca auticeps has three, and members of the Satanoperca jurupari group have none.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nSatanoperca lilith is native to blackwater rivers in the northern Amazon basin. Its native range extends from the Rio Japurá to the Trombetas River, and it has also been observed within the Rio Negro and Branco River basins.\n\n\n== Ecology and behavior ==\n\n\n=== Diet ===\nSatanoperca lilith is omnivorous, and will vary its diet and foraging strategies depending on seasonal variations in the water level of its environment.\nDuring the wet season, when water levels are high, Satanoperca lilith will mostly feed on aquatic insect larvae (such as larval flies, beetles, and caddisflies) and planktonic crustaceans (such as ostracods, water fleas, and clam shrimp) - roughly 65% of their dietary volume during this time will consist of arthropods alone, with only 8.6% of their diet consisting of plant matter (mostly fruits and seeds). \nThe dry season corresponds with a marked shift in their diet from arthropods (now comprising just 28.3% of their diet) towards feeding on plant matter (now up to 27.3%, and mostly consisting of leaves). This, in conjunction with the increased prevalence of sand grains in their stomach contents (2.2% during the wet season, to 15.7% during the dry season), indicates that their foraging strategy shifts from active predation at the water's surface to sifting through detritus when water levels are low.\n\n\n== Relationship with humans ==\nSatanoperca lilith is one of several species commonly used as bait by boat tour operators to attract Amazon river dolphins during the dry season. Among the Ribeirinhos of the Amazon rainforest, it is consumed as traditional medicine to treat illness.\n\n\n=== In the aquarium ===\nPrior to being formally described in 1988, this species was sold in the aquarium trade as a morph of Satanoperca daemon. It is not commonly sought out by exporters — between the years of 2006 to 2015, only 1,069 specimens of Satanoperca lilith were exported from the Amazonas state of Brazil for the ornamental fish trade.\n\n\n== Conservation status ==\nDue to its wide distribution, abundance throughout its range, and lack of significant threats to its survival, the IUCN Red List considers Satanoperca lilith to be a least concern species.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Styphelia saxicola is a species of flowering plant in the heath family Ericaceae and is endemic to inland Western Australia. It is an erect shrub with sharply-pointed, linear or very narrowly elliptic leaves and white or pale cream-coloured, tube-shaped flowers usually arranged in groups of 2 or 3 in leaf axils.\n\n\n== Description ==\nStyphelia saxicola is an erect shrub that typically grows up to 1.0 m (3 ft 3 in) high and wide. Its leaves are linear to very narrowly elliptic or very narrowly triangular, 6–14 mm (0.24–0.55 in) long and 0.9–1.5 mm (0.035–0.059 in) wide, on a petiole 0.3–0.6 mm (0.012–0.024 in) long, the edges curved down and the tip sharply-pointed. The flowers are hairy and usually arranged in groups of 2 or 3 in leaf axils, with broadly egg-shaped to almost round bracts 0.7–1.0 mm (0.028–0.039 in) long, and similarly shaped bracteoles 1.0–1.3 mm (0.039–0.051 in) long at the base. The sepals are narrowly egg-shaped, 2.5–3.0 mm (0.098–0.118 in) long, straw-coloured to pale brown, sometimes tinged with pink. The petals are white or pale cream-coloured, and joined at the base to form a tube 3.3–4.7 mm (0.13–0.19 in) long, the lobes 3.0–4.6 mm (0.12–0.18 in) long and hairy inside. Flowering occurs between April and September and the fruit is a narrowly elliptic drupe 3.6–4.5 mm (0.14–0.18 in) long.\n\n\n== Taxonomy and naming ==\nStyphelia deserticola was first formally described in 2020 by Michael Hislop in the journal Swainsona from specimens he collected near Bulfinch in 2006. The specific epithet (saxicola) means \"rock-inhabitant\" or \"stone-inhabitant\".\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nThis styphelia grows in rocky places from Bulfinch to Bullabulling and Diemals in the Coolgardie and Yalgoo bioregions of inland Western Australia.\n\n\n== Conservation status ==\nStyphelia saxicola is classified as \"Priority Three\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions,  meaning that it is poorly known and known from only a few locations but is not under imminent threat.\n\n\n== References ==",

It was sold at Sotheby's in 2009.\nIt shows a scene of the artist's impression of the Checkered House in Cambridge, New York, a landmark dating from the Revolutionary War period. The figures in period costume are coming and going by horseback. It was a recurring theme she painted, remarking “The Checkered House is old... It was the Headquarters of General Baum in the revolution war, and afterwards he used it as a Hospital, then it was a stopping place for the stage, where they changed horses every two miles.\"\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nThis painting was a newer version of one of three sent by the artist to an exhibition in May 1941 in the Syracuse Museum of Art (today the Everson Museum of Art). One was awarded a prize and purchased by Thomas J. Watson, and this one was probably also later purchased by him, for it hung in the IBM headquarters in Armonk, New York for many years.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGalerie St. Etienne\n\n\n== References ==\n\nImage of the painting in the 1975 abridged version of Otto Kallir's 1973 catalogue raisonné\n\"Checkered House |\". sothebys.com.

        "content": "Ember Sword is an upcoming massively multiplayer online role-playing social sandbox game developed and published by Bright Star Studios for Windows and macOS. The game's narrative depicts a distance future in which an apocalyptic event devastated the fictional Galilean moon of Thanabus, on which Ember Sword's events take place.\nPresented from a three-dimensional isometric perspective, Ember Sword players battle against each other or non-player characters, enhancing their character's abilities by equipping different weapons and armor. Players can trade with each other for resources or loot them from slain foes. Powered by the Ethereum blockchain, players can use non-fungible tokens to acquire items.\nThe game is scheduled for early access release in late 2024, with browser accessibility.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nPlayers control a character avatar from a three-dimensional isometric perspective. With the camera locked onto their character, players may venture the landscape and engage in different activities. Characters are factionless; combat may be with hostile non-player characters (NPCs) called \"mobs\" or with other players in designated player versus player arena spaces. Abilities are tied directly to the types of weapons that are equipped, with armor complementing their respective character statistics. Items & currency may be acquired by looting corpses of slain NPCs or by trading with other players. Professions may be developed by earning points by participating in respective activities, such as mining, fishing and logging.\nEmber Sword follows a pay-to-earn business model; currency earned by slaying mobs, selling items and trading with players may be exchanged to ERC-20, which converts to Ethereum cryptocurrency. Players may acquire land, which they can use to build structures, crops and dungeons on.\n\n\n== Setting ==\nIn the distant future, humanity was once a space-faring race that originated from Mars & Io and united under an interplanetary dominion called \"Pangaea\". In 3220, after humans have terraformed and colonized the terrestrial worlds of the Solar System, a godlike entity named Starzhen arrives, wielding a reality-bending weapon called the Ember Sword, claiming to sanction a rising threat. In 3225, he attacks Jupiter, prompting reprisal from Pangaea. Although Starzhen is destroyed in the subsequent battle, his death triggers an apocalyptic event called the \"Catastrophe\", which devastates the fictional Galilean moon of Thanabus into a dark age and led to the collapse of Pangaea.\nEmber Sword takes place in the year 3460, on Thanabus, which is tidally locked with Ganymede. The moon is divided into four nations: the forested Solarwood, the desert of Duskeron, the jungles of Sevrend, and the arctic tundra of Ediseau.\n\n\n== Development ==\nProduction of Ember Sword began in 2018, under the Danish developer So Couch Studios, led by chief executive officer Mark Laursen. It was announced in October of that year. Initially developed on the Unity game engine, Ember Sword was intended designed for Windows & Android operating systems. The game is powered by the Ethereum blockchain, allowing for players to acquire tokenized cosmetics through gameplay, which can be traded for the in-game currency called \"PIXEL\". In April 2020, the venture capitalist firm Galaxy Interactive announced a $700,000 pre-seed investment alongside Play Ventures in the game's developer, renamed Bright Star Studios, with Unity Studios' former chief executive officer Allan Kirkeby & SK Gaming's former managing director Andreas Thorstensson joining as a senior producer & business consultant, respectively. An initial virtual sale of in-game land was held in May 2021; the four thousand available plots sold out within six hours.\nBy July 2021, the in-game currency was renamed from PIXEL to the ERC-20 token \"Ember\". Bright Star held a subsequent virtual land sale, resulting in over $203 million being pledged. From the approximately 35,000 applications received, 6,000 would be selected for plots in Solarwood. Shortly after the conclusion of the initial land sale, a $2 million investment deal from the previous May was announced, consisting of contributions from twenty individuals, including former chief creative officer of Blizzard Entertainment Rob Pardo, head of YouTube Gaming Ryan Wyatt, pseudonymous streamer Dr Disrespect, Twitch co-founder Kevin Lin, G2 Esports founder Carlos \"ocelote\" Rodríguez Santiago, chief operating officer of 100 Thieves John Robinson, Night Ventures, co-founder of Xfire Dennis Fong and co-founder of The Sandbox Sébastien Borget.\nEmber Sword initially relied upon Polygon (MATIC) as the platform for handling Ethereum, but with the establishment of Immutable Pty Ltd's Immutable X platform, Bright Star announced in March 2022 that it would migrate to the newer platform, with a $100 million partnership with GameStop. Due to issues with Unity's capabilities for sustaining an MMORPG, Bright Star opted to explore a proprietary engine that would favor browser accessibility & streaming media in 2021. According to Bright Star, the company initially contracted with a prolific engine developer, but due to misaligned expectations, decided to develop a proprietary engine in-house. Five game engines were attempted before Bright Star created Project SERIUS, which proved to be more acclimated for fast loading times in-browser.\n\n\n== Release ==\nIn April 2022, virtual land owners & VIP badge holders were given access to a pre-alpha technical test set in Solarwood. A year later, an alpha test was held, focused on the area surrounding Solarwood's capital of Burkhalter's Academy and featuring rudimentary core mechanics and weapon classes. A subsequent vertical slice alpha demo was released in October 23, taking raiding parties to the Ultra Deep dungeon.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "All Saints' Church is the parish church of Broughton, Craven, a village in North Yorkshire, in England.\nNo church in Broughton is recorded in the Domesday Book, the first reference to one being in 1120.  The oldest part of the church is part of the south wall including the main doorway, which is 12th century.  The rest of the church was rebuilt, probably in the early 16th century.  In 1873, William Henry Crossland heavily restored the chancel, and rebuilt the roof of the nave.  The church was grade I listed in 1954.\nAlan Bennett described a visit to the church: \"We sit outside listening to the wind streaming through a huge copper beech and talk about this ordinary enough church which has been bound up with great events in the nation's history\".  The grass in the churchyard is kept down by a small flock of sheep.  The church is described as \"rather cold in winter\".\nThe church is built of stone, with a stone slate roof.  It consists of a nave and a chancel under a continuous roof, a north aisle, a south porch and a west tower, and is in Perpendicular style.  The tower has angle buttresses, arched bell openings, gargoyles, and an embattled parapet with corner pinnacles.  The south doorway has one order of waterleaf capitals and the shafts lost.  In the south wall of the chancel is a round-headed priest's door, and the east window has three cusped traceried lights.  Inside are two alabaster sculptures of the Virgin Mary, found during the Victorian restoration; various monuments to the Tempest family; and a 12th-century font.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGrade I listed buildings in North Yorkshire\nListed buildings in Broughton, Craven\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Río Tinto Foundation (in Spanish: Fundación Río Tinto, FRT) is a Spanish cultural and non-profit institution based in the municipality of Minas de Ríotinto, in the province of Huelva. The Foundation's objective is the study and preservation of the industrial heritage of the Río Tinto Company Limited, as well as its recovery in projects that generate added value in the Río Tinto region. The foundation is involved in numerous cultural and recreational initiatives.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe foundation was created in 1987 by the Río Tinto Minera Company as a cultural and private institution, of a charitable nature, to take charge of the heritage generated over the decades by the companies that had operated the Rio Tinto Mines. Among the purposes of the FRT were the study of mining and metallurgy, as well as the conservation and restoration of the environmental and patrimonial heritage of the mining basin. To this end, the creation of a Mining Park for cultural, tourist and recreational purposes was foreseen, including the creation of a Mining Museum and the conservation of the Ríotinto railroad. After many years of work by the institution, the recovery of the historic railway line for tourist use, as well as the conservation and restoration of the railway heritage are to its credit. A fundamental part of this work was the launching, in November 1994, of the Tourist Mining Train. The FRT also manages the Riotinto Mining Museum, inaugurated in 1992, and the Mining Historical Archive, which holds the archival funds derived from the business activity of the successive owners of the mines.\n\n\n== Presidents ==\nErnest Lluch Martín (1987–1991)\nJosé Rodríguez de la Borbolla (1991–2002)\nRafael Benjumea Cabeza de Vaca (2002–2021)\nMaría Benjumea Cabeza de Vaca (2021–present)\n\n\n== See also ==\nRiotinto-Nerva mining basin\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nDelgado, Aquilino; Campos, Ángel; Fiñana, Francisco (2007). \"La recuperación del patrimonio ferroviario llevada a cabo por Fundación Río Tinto.

        "content": "Richard Christie (1918–1992) was an American social and personality psychologist. He was influential in many studies on human psychology, most notably in the creation of the personality trait known as Machiavellianism.\n\n\n== Life ==\nChristie was born in Perdue, Saskatchewan. Christie obtained his bachelor's degree from the University of Tulsa in 1942, became a U.S. citizen, and served in the Air Force during World War II. He earned a master's from the University of Nebraska in 1947 and a doctorate from the University of California, Berkeley in 1949. He joined Columbia's faculty as a fellow in 1956, and became a full professor in 1960. He chaired the Department of Social Psychology from 1962 to 1965 and 1967 to 1968, retiring in 1988. He was influential in studies of the authoritarian personality, and in creating the machiavellianism scale in his career.\nChristie was married to Delores Kreisman, an associate clinical professor of psychiatry, and had five children: a son named Lance, and three daughters, Rebecca, Gail, and Margaret Kellogg. He also had five grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.\nChristie died in his apartment in 1992 of a heart attack.\n\n\n== Studies in Machiavellianism ==\nStudies in Machiavellianism is a book published in 1970 by Christie and his research partner Florence L. Geis. The book consists of a series of studies into a personality style which is characterized by manipulativeness and callousness. It is the first book on Machiavellianism and was the catalyst of creating an entire field of study around the personality trait.\nIn the 1960s, Christie and his colleagues were interested in studying those who were skilled in controlling and manipulating others. He theorized that a manipulator would have affective-interpersonal characteristics which would be beneficial to their goals, such as having a lack of empathy, disregard for morality, a lack of mental illness, and an indifference to ideology. While conceptualizing a scale for manipulative behavior, he was reminded of the works of Niccolò Machiavelli as many of the political strategies that appeared in the diplomat's works had everyday parallels with behaviors which Christie observed in university faculty. Christie and his colleagues would then develop a psychometric test consisting of colloquialized statements similar to the ones found Machiavelli's works, naming their personality construct \"Machiavellianism\". High Machiavellianism scores correlated with an cold, unprincipled nature and a greater willingness to manipulate others.\nHe discovered that an individual's \"Mach score\" was also not linked to political views, racial attitudes, intelligence, or educational level, but rather stemmed from an individual's perspectives on tactics and morality.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Doris Bass Andrews (1920–2003) was an American artist and historic preservationist known for her efforts to protect Weir Farm in Connecticut, an important site for American Impressionism.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nAndrews was born in Louisville, Kentucky, in 1920. She attended the Erskine School in Boston and served as a Morse code telegraph operator during World War II. Post-war, she pursued art education at the Art Students League in Manhattan.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAndrews married Sperry Andrews, a fellow artist, in 1947. The couple became prominent watercolor painters and collaborated artistically while advocating for historic preservation.\nIn the late 1950s, Andrews and Sperry purchased the Weir Farm, historically associated with the Impressionist painter J. Alden Weir. Recognizing the farm's cultural and historical significance, they spearheaded efforts to prevent its commercial development. Their campaign culminated in the establishment of Weir Farm as a National Historic Site in 1990.\n\n\n=== Legacy ===\nAndrews' dedication to preserving Weir Farm helped maintain a vibrant artistic community and protect a landmark of American art history. She received the Connecticut Nature Conservancy's White Oak Award in 1977 for her conservation efforts at the Weir Farm. She passed away in 2003 in Danbury, Connecticut.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The constitution of the Federal Republic of Central America (Spanish: constitución de la República Federal de Centro América) was the governing document of the Federal Republic of Central America from 1824 to 1839. It was inspired by both the United States Declaration of Independence and the Spanish Constitution of 1812\n\n\n== History ==\nOn 1 July 1823, Central America declared its independence from Mexico after having been a part of Mexico since January 1822. The political leaders who declared independence from Mexico established the National Constituent Assembly, and the assembly was tasked with drafting a constitution for the newly independent United Provinces of Central America (later named the Federal Republic of Central America).\nOn 28 June 1824, the National Constituent Assembly drafted the country's constitution. It was published on 4 July, and on 22 November, the assembly officially ratified the constitution. The constitution was repealed upon the dissolution of the Federal Republic of Central America on 17 April 1839.\n\n\n== Contents ==\nThe constitution established a federal government composed of a legislative, executive, and judicial branch. All officials in these branches were elected through indirect elections. The legislative branch consisted of the Federal Congress (itself composed of the Senate and the Council of Deputies); the executive branch consisted of the president, the vice president, and the cabinet; and the judicial branch consisted of the Supreme Court. The constitution granted most of the federal government's power, including the executive power, to the Federal Congress; American historian William F. Slade described the federal government established by the constitution as a \"parliamentary dictatorship\".\n\n\n== Historical assessment ==\nThe Central American constitution was loosely based on the United States federal government, the United States Declaration of Independence, and the 1812 Spanish constitution. Central American historians have criticized the constitution as being \"too idealistic\", and cited this as a contributing factor to the collapse of the Federal Republic of Central America.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nChing, Erik K.

        "content": "Friedrichstein Palace (German: Schloss Friedrichstein is a former baroque palace near Königsberg, East Prussia. It was constructed between 1709 and 1714 based on a design by Jean de Bodt. The palace was the main residence of the Dönhoff family. The German journalist and publisher Marion Dönhoff was born at the palace and grew up here. The palace was one of the so-called 'royal palaces' of East Prussia, which could be used by the king of Prussia while travelling around. In January 1945, the Red Army looted and destroyed the palace. It was considered one of the most beautiful stately homes in Prussia.\nToday, nothing remains anymore of the main building. The park still exists, and various ancillary buildings.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe palace was located in Löwenhagen, twenty kilometres east of Königsberg, nowadays Kaliningrad, in the valley of the Pregolya river. After the Second World War, the village of Löwenhagen was renamed to Kamenka. It is part of the Guryevsky District in the Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 17th century ===\nThe lands where the palace was to come, were bought by count Bar in the 16th century. He creates a residential house, a barn and a granary. But due to financial difficulties, he had to transfer the estate to Friedrich von Waldburg in the 17th century. It is he, who builds the first manor house and gives his name to the estate ‘Friedrichstein’.\nWhen Friedrich von Waldburg passes away in 1625, the estate goes over to his widow, Maria von Waldburg. She dies in 1642, leaving the inheritance to Hans Albrecht von Waldburg. As the economic conditions are not good, he is forced to sell the property. At this time, the estate was around 450 hecatres.\nOn 2 September 1666, Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg and Duke of Prussia, approves that count Friedrich von Dönhoff (1639–1696) acquires the estate. Friedrich is a chamberlain of the elector and lieutenant colonel. The Dönhoff family will own the estate for eight generations from 1666 to 1945, when it is confiscated by the Soviet Union. Friedrich will be succeeded by his eldest son, Otto Magnus von Dönhoff (1665–1717), who will become a lieutenant general and diplomat for the Prussian king, Frederick I of Prussia (1657–1713). The king honours him with the Order of the Black Eagle, of which he becomes one of the first recipients.\n\n\n=== 18th century ===\nIn the winter of 1709, a fire destroys the manor house. There was talk of the guilt of \"fiery spirits\" believed in by the inhabitants of East Prussia, but it is assumed that the cause was set on fire by neighbours who felt hostility towards the ‘haughty aristocracy’.\nOtto Magnus von Dönhoff decides to construct a new palace in baroque style. The designs are by the architect Jean de Bodt and the building works are supervised by John von Collas. The works are executed between 1709 and 1714. Otto Magnus employs 100 soldiers of the regiment he commands to help.\nIn 1701, Otto Magnus married Wilhelmina Amalia, the daughter of count Alexander zu Dohna-Schlobitten. Together, they have five sons and five daughters. The heir was the eldest son, Friedrich II von Dönhoff (1717–1769), who was married to Wilhelmine Sophie von Kameke (1712–1758). Subsequently, the palace passes to their son, the Prussian Minister of War Christian von Dönhoff (1742–1803), married to Charlotte Amalie Rollaz du Rosey (1742–1813); and then to their son, count August von Dönhoff (1763–1838).\n\n\n== 19th century ==\nIn the middle of the 19th century, August Heinrich Hermann von Dönhoff (1797–1874), a diplomat and foreign minister of Prussia, lived at Friedrichstein. He was succeeded by his son, August von Dönhoff (1845–1920), a diplomat and member of the Prussian House of Lords and German Reichstag. In 1896, he married the 24 years younger Maria von Lepel (1869–1940), lady in waiting to the Queen of Prussia and German Empress, Augusta Victoria (1858–1921), wife of Wilhelm II (1859–1941). Together, they had eight children. The youngest of them was the journalist and writer Marion Dönhoff (1909–2002), who was born at Friedrichstein and grew up here.\nAugust von Dönhoff had a passion for collecting. Within the palace, he amassed an impressive array of valuable musical instruments, ornamental weaponry, exquisite carpets, and more.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nIn 1920, count Heinrich von Dönhoff (1899–1942) inherited schloss Friedrichstein. Initially, his mother managed the estate on his behalf, with advice of the former Saxon minister von Falkenhausen. Around 1922, count Heinrich took over the administration himself. He modernized the estate management according the latest standards, the palace was renovated in the 1930s, and the park was restored to its former baroque structures.\nIn Heinrich's time, the estate was one the largest private land holdings in Germany. The Friedrichstein estate, including the palace, pheasantry, and Amalienhof, the forest (protected forest), Groß Hohenhagen, and Wehnenfeld with the outlying Lottienenhof farm, covered 6,215 hectares. The Quittainen estate included another 9,907 hectares, totalling more than 160 square kilometres.\n\n\n=== World War II and thereafter ===\nAugust Karl and Maria von Dönhoff had eight children, who – as young people – took different positions towards Nazism, the problems of World War II and its consequences, i.e. the decisions of the Potsdam Conference of the Big Three. The daughter, Marion Dönhoff (1909–2002), joined the resistance movement, which led to questioning by the Gestapo after a failed assassination attempt on Hitler in 1944. Although many of her fellow resistance activists were executed, she was released reportedly because her name was not found in any of the documents seized by the Nazis.\nIn January 1945, as Soviet troops rolled into the region, Dönhoff fled East Prussia, travelling seven weeks on horseback before reaching Hamburg. She recounted her journey in a 1962 book of essays called Names No One Mentions Anymore.\nIn 1946, Marion Dönhoff joined the fledgling, Hamburg-based intellectual weekly Die Zeit as political editor. Ultimately, becoming its publisher in 1972. Also, she became a social activist fighting for the reconciliation of Germany with the countries of Eastern Europe. She was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1990.\nSoviet soldiers set the palace on fire. They made special efforts to destroy \"fascist Venus and stags\" (statues and bas-reliefs were blown up with dynamite). It is probable that at that time the valuable monument of Immanuel Kant by Christian Daniel Rauch was also destroyed. In 1944, Marion had it transported (with the consent of the Königsberg authorities) to Friedrichstein in order to protect it from the expected Allied bombings on the city.\nThe walls of the burned palace were slightly damaged, but no reconstruction was started and there was no objection to the devastation of the interior. It was supported by the information that it was a \"fascist lair\" and \"Göring's Dacha\". The ruins were gradually dismantled. When in 1989, Marion Dönhoff visited the constantly remembered and loved place of her birth, she found only traces of foundations (some farm buildings have been preserved).\nThe last owners of Friedrichstein were Marion's brothers, count Heinrich von Dönhoff (1920–1942) and count Dietrich von Dönhoff (1902–1991) – the eight generation of the Dönhoff family at Friedrichstein. The son of count Heinrich, count Hermann von Dönhoff was adopted by his uncle, the last prince of Hatzfeld-Wildenburg, Franz-Hermann, becoming one of the largest landowners in Rhineland-Palatinate and Brandenburg. He lives in Crottorf castle in Friesenhagen, from where he manages the Hatzfeld estates and Schönstein castle as well. Marion Dönhoff passed away in Crottorf in 2002.\n\n\n==== Gallery: A tour of the palace interior around 1910 ====\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nIn 1701, Prussia was elevated from ducal status to royal status, and its new king, Frederick I of Prussia (1657–1713), wished to see his kingdom to be provided with some magnificent baroque palaces for reasons of cultural representation. Hence, the East Prussian nobility constructed a range of so-called ‘royal palaces’. The counts von Dönhoff created Friedrichstein and Dönhoffstädt. The counts Dohna built Schlobitten and Schlodien. The counts Finck von Finckenstein erected Finckenstein Palace, and the counts Waldburg constructed Capustigall. Dönhoffstädt was build by a brother of Otto Magnus, and was modelled after Friedrichstein.\nThe palace constructed between 1709 and 1714 was considered one of the most beautiful stately homes in Prussia. It had 19 axes and was two-story (with a high basement and a mansard roof). The façade was almost 100 meters long and housed over 110 rooms. The rooms were decorated in the Rococo style between 1750 and 1770. On the courtyard side there was a portico with Ionic columns, and on the garden side there was a similar loggia. The pediment was decorated with decorative exotic trees growing in oak barrels with massive hoops. It stood on a hill, which gave the impression of lightness despite its large size.\nThe garden front is modelled after the Zeughaus in Berlin, also designed by Jean de Bodt. This front was considered as exceptional design, and probably Jean de Bodt's masterpiece.\nAn expansive view was provided from the windows of both longer walls; from the garden side - to an elongated pond (probably the Pregoła oxbow lake). Next to the palace, surrounded by vast deciduous forests, a French-style park was organized. Natural landscape parks are enriched with artificial waterfalls, caves, etc.\nFriedrichstein housed a valuable series of tapestries dating back to around 1630, depicting scenes from the life of Alexander the Great, designed by Jacob Jordaens.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Literature ==\nSieber, Helmut (1958).

The figures are coming and going in all manner of horse-drawn vehicles and taking part in various activities such as horse and cattle judging, buggy racing, and eating in a temporary festival tent. The central figure is a balloon man. It was one of the last large paintings she painted.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGalerie St. Etienne\n\n\n== References ==\n\nImage of the painting in the 1975 abridged version of Otto Kallir's 1973 catalogue raisonné\n\"Country Fair |\". sothebys.com.

        "content": "Rick and Morty: Worlds Apart is a limited series graphic novel, written by Josh Trujillo, illustrated by Tony Fleecs & Jarrett Williams, and colored by Leonardo Ito, which was published in four parts in 2021 by Oni Press, based on the fourth season of self-titled television series by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon, and serving as a direct sequel to the 2019 episodes \"Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat\" by Mike McMahan and \"Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty\" by Jeff Loveness, as well as a continuation of the 2013 first season episode \"Anatomy Park\" by Eric Acosta and Wade Randolph.\nTonally described as having \"a heightened sense of surrealism and mania\", Part One was released on February 3; Part Two was released on March 3; Part Three was released on April 7; and Part Four was released on May 5 (all in 2021). The series' dragons were later made available as playable characters in the free-to-play role-playing video game Pocket Mortys. Receiving a generally positive critical reception, the series was collected as an trade paperback in September 2021,  and as an omnibus edition (with Rick and Morty: Corporate Assets) in September 2023.\n\n\n== Development ==\nAnnounced in October 2020 for a February 2021 premiere, given free reign by Oni Press to write a sequel to any Rick and Morty episode of his choosing, Josh Trujillo stated that \"the moment he saw Balthromaw and his sensual dragon warriors [in Jeff Loveness' fourth season episode \"Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty\" that] he knew exactly what story he wanted to tell\", describing the miniseries as \"something that lives up the comedy and insanity of the [animated] series\", with \"the kinkiest team of super-villains to ever grace a comic-book page\". Series' artist Jarrett Williams considered the series \"the best project to have [done] during quarantine [with] some really ambitious comic layouts\", while supporting artist Tony Fleecs described the premise of the series as a whole as:\n\n\"I love when licensed comics take characters you saw for a SPLIT second in a show or movie and then tell a giant story about just that one character [and] when tiny characters get to have a whole life outside of the show. We're doing that in this book with not one but TWO beloved 'featured extras' and also there's just a ton of super horny dragons.\"\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n== Collected editions ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRick and Morty: Worlds Apart at Oni Press",

        "content": "Following the outbreak of the Israel–Hamas war on October 7th, 2023, the United Kingdom has provided Israel with extensive military and diplomatic support. In response to the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak asserted that the United Kingdom \"unequivocally\" stands with Israel. The UK also issued an \"unequivocal condemnation\" of Palestinian militant group Hamas and deployed British Armed Forces personnel and assets to the Eastern Mediterranean to support Israel.\nThe United Kingdom solidly aligns itself with the United States throughout the conflict, which has also given significant support to Israel, abstaining from three ceasefire resolutions put forth by the United Nations Security Council calling for a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza. This stance has led the United Kingdom to face increasing isolation along with the United States and Israel as global calls for a ceasefire intensify. British ministers have openly endorsed Israel's forced evacuation orders and unlawful collective punishment of the Gaza Strip, without condemning any of Israel's policies despite the mounting death toll.\nAccording to the Campaign Against Arms Trade, the UK has granted arms export licences to Israel amounting to £574 million ($727 million) since 2008, including £42 million ($53 million) in 2022. Despite growing calls from various international organizations, over 600 members of the British legal profession, and three former senior British judges who argue that the UK's arms sales to Israel violate international law, Foreign Secretary David Cameron said on April 9th, 2024, that the United Kingdom will not cease its arms sales to Israel. International human rights organizations such as Human Rights Watch have criticized the UK for its military and diplomatic support to Israel, arguing that such support could render the UK complicit in Israeli war crimes and genocide. As of April 2024, it is estimated that the conflict has resulted in the killing of over 34,000 Palestinians.\n\n\n== Timeline ==\n\n\n=== October ===\nOn October 8th, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the United Kingdom \"unequivocally\" stands with Israel. He also announced \"we will continue to provide Israel with every support that it needs as we stand steadfast with Israel, including its right to self defence to ensure that these attacks do not happen.\"\nOn October 12th, the UK announced that it would send two Royal Navy supports ships, 100 Royal Marines and surveillance aircraft to the Eastern Mediterranean from October 13th to support Israel. This includes Poseidon P-8 aircraft and other planes tasked partly with preventing weapon transfers to Hezbollah in Lebanon from Iran.\nOn October 18th, the UK abstained from a United Nations Security Council resolution calling for \"humanitarian pauses\" to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza.\nOn October 19th, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak arrived in Tel Aviv in a two-day visit to \"express solidarity with the Israeli people\", as the relentless Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip has killed over 3,400 Palestinians.\n\n\n=== December ===\nOn December 2nd, the UK Ministry of Defence announced that it would begin surveillance flights over Gaza “in support of the ongoing hostage rescue activity”.\n\n\n== Pro-Israel lobby ==\n\nDeclassified UK revealed that 20% of Labour Party MPs have been received funding from pro-Israel groups or individuals, totaling £280,000 in donations.\n\n\n== Opinion polls ==\nAccording to a December 2023 YouGov poll commissioned by Medical Aid for Palestinians and the Council for Arab-British Understanding, 71% of the British public believe that there should definitely (48%) or probably (23%) be an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, while only 12% though that there should definitely not (6%) or probably not (6%) be an immediate ceasefire. Additionally, the poll found that 17% of the British public approve of the British government's handling of the conflict, while only 9% approve of the opposition Labour Party's handling of the conflict, revealing that there is \"a total and utter lack of public confidence in the way both the UK government and the Labour Party have handled this\".\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Rotherham Swifts F.C. was an association football club from Kimberworth, near Rotherham, Yorkshire, England, active in the 19th century.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe first reference to the club is from July 1888, when a representative attended a meeting of 22 clubs to arrange fixtures before the 1888–89 season.  The club had enough members to field two XIs on its first match weekend in September 1888 (helped by recruiting several players from Ecclesfield), the first XI losing at Eckington Works, and the second XI beating Junior Cup champions Carbrook Church at home.\nIt also entered the FA Cup that season, although the competition now had qualifying rounds, and the Swifts were eliminated in the first qualifying round at Park Grange.  The club finished its first season with a £3 profit on income of £110.\nThe Swifts' best run in the national cup came in 1889–90; after hammering an under-strength Owlerton 9–1 - away from home - in the first qualifying round and going nap at Whitby in the second, it was drawn to host the senior club in Rotherham, Rotherham Town, in the third.  The tie ended goalless, an attempt to play 30 minutes of extra-time being curtailed when darkness fell after 10; the replay also went to extra-time, Town this time apparently winning 2–1.  \nHowever the match had ended 6 minutes early, and a successful Swifts protest saw the final 6 minutes being played off on 2 December, as a curtain-raiser to the Sheffield Football Association match against the Cheshire Football Association, which fortuitously had already been arranged to take place at Town's Clifton Lane ground; owing to injuries both sides only fielded 10 men, and Town scored a third goal in the extra time.  Several of the players - the Swifts' Pearce, Whittam, Howell, and Watson, and Town's Rodgers, Cross, Longden, and Bridgewater - played in the main event for the Sheffield FA.\nThe Rotherham sides also met in the third round of the Sheffield and Hallamshire Senior Cup the same season, Town this time winning at the first time of asking, 3–2 at the Swifts' Holmes ground.\nThe club was a founder member of the Midland Alliance, a competition at a level below the Midland League (in which Rotherham Town played), in 1890.  However, after three games, the Swifts withdrew, finding the costs of travel to be too great, and, before its resignation was accepted, applied to join the Sheffield & District League.  Its Alliance record of one win, one draw, and one defeat was expunged.\nThe obvious problem for the club was that Town had already secured the support of Rotherham, and, when the clubs played home matches on the same day, the crowds headed for Town rather than Swifts.  The club duly dissolved before the 1891–92 season.  There was a sad aftermath in May 1892, when former goalkeeper Thomas Pearce drowned himself in the canal near the Swifts' ground; a verdict of suicide by temporary insanity (blamed on being \"troubled about his love affairs\") was returned.\n\n\n== Colours ==\nThe club wore blue and amber stripes.\n\n\n== Ground ==\nThe club's first home match was played at the Richmond Park Ground in Kimberworth.  From November 1888 it played at the Holmes, which hosted the replay of the Sheffield Cup in 1890, won by Rotherham Town.  The Swifts used the Pigeon Cote Inn on Steel Street for facilities.\nThe highest recorded attendance at the ground was 4,000, for the FA Cup qualifying tie with Rotherham Town on 16 November 1889.\n\n\n== Notable players ==\nWalter Broadhead, who played in the club's first match, and who later joined Rotherham Town, playing for Town in the Football League.\nRab Howell, Arthur Watson, and Michael Whitham - all recruited from Ecclesfield as the first Swifts players.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Henry Sears Lodge Jr. (October 20, 1958 – 2017), known as Harry, was an American internist and health writer. \n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nLodge was born in Boston, Massachusetts, and raised in Beverly, Massachusetts. His father was a chairman of the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority, and his grandfather was Senator Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., a Massachusetts senator and U.N. ambassador. His mother, Elenita Ziegler, was a freelance writer and civic activist.\nLodge attended Groton School and later studied pre-medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, graduating in 1981. He earned his medical degree from the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1985.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAfter completing his residency at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, Lodge joined the staff at Presbyterian Hospital (now NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital) and held a professorship at Columbia University Medical Center.\nIn 1996, Lodge founded New York Physicians, a multi-specialty medical group affiliated with Columbia University and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital. As chairman and chief executive, he expanded the group, establishing it as an important entry point for emerging medical professionals.\nLodge was also a successful author, known for his Younger Next Year series, which includes books such as Younger Next Year for Women and Younger Next Year: The Exercise Program. His works, which promote maintaining vitality in later life, have sold over two million copies and have been translated into 21 languages.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nLodge was married, but the marriage ended in divorce. He is survived by his mother, daughters Madeleine and Samantha, sister Felicity, brothers Fred and John, and his partner Ms. Yorke's sons, Elliott and Coleman Snyder.\nLodge died in 2017.\n\n\n== References ==",

He previously coached for the St. Edward's Hilltoppers, Western Kentucky Hilltoppers, for the Qatar senior and youth national teams, Manama Sports Club, at LCC International University, for the Loyola Wolf Pack, Ole Miss Rebels and Texas Southern Tigers.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHollowell was born in Shreveport, Louisiana, and grew up in Mandeville. He attended Mandeville High School and played four years of basketball. He graduated from St. Edward's University in Texas with a degree in economics in 2001.\n\n\n== Coaching career ==\nHollowell had coached Biddy Basketball teams while in high school and decided to continue coaching afterwards. While at St. Edward's, he served as a student assistant coach. He later served one season as a volunteer assistant for the Western Kentucky Hilltoppers, in 2000–01, before returning to St. Edward's as an assistant coach for the 2001–02 season.\nHollowell began coaching overseas in 2003, serving from then until 2006 as an assistant coach for the Qatar men's national basketball team. He helped the team go 111–56 in his tenure there while reaching the 2006 FIBA World Championship, which was the only appearance in their history. He also served briefly as an advanced scout for the China men's national basketball team, helping them win the basketball tournament at the 2006 Asian Games.\nHollowell also coached the Bahrain team Manama Sports Club in 2006, helping them reach the national championship while missing their top player. He then worked as the coach of the basketball team at LCC International University in Lithuania for two years, leading them to the playoffs both seasons. He returned to Qatar as head coach of the national youth team in 2009 and remained there through 2010, before moving back to the United States.\nHollowell joined the Loyola Wolf Pack as an assistant coach in 2011. In his first year, he helped them win the conference title and have their first 20-win season since 1948. He was promoted to head coach in 2014. He ultimately served eight years as head coach and compiled an overall record of 166–78, helping them make their first postseason appearance in 71 years and reaching the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) Tournament in five of his last six years. In 2021–22, he directed them to a record of 37–1 and led them to their first national championship since 1945, as they led the country in scoring and steals.

        "content": "\"The Black Horse Troop\" is an American military march composed by John Philip Sousa in 1924 and published in 1925. It was dedicated to Troop A - Cleveland of the Ohio National Guard, today the 107th Cavalry Regiment. Sousa's first connection with Troop A was in 1881, when he marched with the unit as leader of the U.S. Marine Band in the funeral cortege of President James A. Garfield.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn his 1984 book, The Works of John Philip Sousa, Paul E. Bierley described the history and background of the march:\"Sousa’s love for horses is reflected in this march dedicated to the mounted troops of a Cleveland National Guard unit. Their exclusive use of black horses was the inspiration for the title. Troop A, once known as the First City Troop of Cleveland, was originally an independent militia group and has had a long, distinguished history since its formation in 1877. Sousa’s most noteworthy association with the troop came in 1898. The Sousa Band, having arrived in Cleveland just as the troop was preparing to leave for the Spanish-American War, marched in a parade escorting them from the Armory to the train depot. His first association was much earlier, however. As leader of the U.S. Marine Band in 1881, he marched with the organization in the funeral cortege of President James A. Garfield.\nAt a dinner held in Sousa’s honor in November, 1924, the march was requested by Captain Walker Nye of Troop A. The request was fulfilled promptly, and the march was presented in Cleveland on October 17, 1925, at a Sousa Band concert which also marked the forty-eighth anniversary of Troop A. For the occasion, the mounted troopers were dressed in the blue uniforms of 1877, complete with black fur busbies. Sousa presented a manuscript of the march to Captain Nye. Troop A reciprocated by presenting Sousa with a beautiful bronze statuette entitled “The Last Drop,” which depicted a trooper on horseback.\n\nMany of the former Sousa Band members expressed their fondness for this composition and commented on the descriptive character it assumed when performed by Sousa himself. Part of the effect was due to the 6/8 rhythm, which suggests the canter of horses. Also contributing to the effect was Sousa’s use of simulated hoofbeats.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of marches by John Philip Sousa\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nhttps://www.marineband.marines.mil/Audio-Resources/The-Complete-Marches-of-John-Philip-Sousa/The-Black-Horse-Troop/\nhttps://blogs.loc.gov/music/2023/05/the-triple-crown-of-researching-john-philip-sousa/\nhttps://www.windrep.org/Black_Horse_Troop",

A candidate governor and vice-governor are elected together on one ticket by indirect ballot by the members of the provincial assembly using a two-round system were the second round is used to select between the top two tickets of the first round if no ticket gets an absolute majority.\nThe elections will take place in four parts.  The elections of the governors of Kinshasa and 19 provinces will be held April 29 at the same time as the senate elections.  This is followed by the election of the governor of Equateur on May 7 and, on June 2, of the one of Mai-Ndombe.  The election of the last two governors will be scheduled after the July elections to complete the provincial assemblies of Kwilu and Nord-Ubangi.\nThese elections follow the re-election of President Félix Tshisekedi at the 2023 presidential election as well as the legislative and provincial elections held concurrently, with the results of the latter leading to the complete renewal of 22 of the 26 provincial assemblies whose members are responsible for electing governors.\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Inclusive Parliament (Kazakh: Инклюзивті Парламент, romanized: Ïnklyuzïvti Parlament; Russian: Инклюзивный Парламент) is a parliamentary group in the Mäjilis. It was formed in 2023 during the 8th convocation of the Mäjilis, which comprises deputies from all six parties and independents, as well as the Senate deputies.\nThe parliamentary group was formed after the election of deputies with disabilities to the Mäjilis in the 2023 legislative election. It aims to address issues related to disability rights, improve inclusion, and enhance the quality of life for people with disabilities in Kazakhstan.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2020, the Parliament passed a mandatory parliamentary quota law, requiring parties to nominate at least 30% of women and young people as deputy candidates for the lower house, the Mäjilis. However, the 2021 legislative election was held before another amendment to the law was enacted in late 2021 under President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev's proposal, including persons with special needs in the quota, which was expected to affect the composition of the Majilis in the next election.\nFollowing the early dissolution of the 7th Parliament of Kazakhstan, the 2023 legislative election saw the election of several lawmakers with disabilities for the 8th Parliament of Kazakhstan. This development prompted the creation of the Inclusive Parliament group consisting of 18 deputies on 27 June 2023 under the resolution of the Bureau of the Mäjilis, which would soon commence its duties under the leadership of Amanat deputy Erlan Äbdiev.\n\n\n== List of group leaders ==\n\n\n== Historical membership ==\n\n\n=== 8th convocation ===\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Swaffham Town Hall is a judicial building in Whitecross Road in Swaffham, a town in Norfolk, in England. The building, which is now in residential use, is a Grade II listed building.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe building was commissioned by the local justices and financed by public subscription. The site they selected was occupied at the rear by the local prison, which had been erected in 1798, but there was space available at the front of the site.\nThe new building was designed by the county surveyor for Norfolk, John Brown, in the neoclassical style, built in brick with a stucco finish and was completed in 1839. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage of five pays facing onto Whitecross Road. The central section of three bays featured a large portico formed by four full-height Doric order pilasters supporting an entablature and a modillioned pediment. The central bay contained a round-headed doorway with an architrave and a keystone and an oblong panel at first floor level, all within a full-height recess. The outer bays of the central section contained niches on the ground floor and sash windows on the first floor. The single-storey wings were fenestrated by round headed windows. The principal room was the courtroom where the quarter sessions were held; petty sessions were also held every Saturday.\nThe architectural historian, Nikolaus Pevsner, criticized the design of the portico saying that it was \"almost too big\".\nFollowing the formation of Norfolk County Council in 1889, the pediment was adapted to accommodate a carved coat of arms of the county council in the tympanum.\nIn 1894, the local urban sanitary district board was replaced by a new urban district council. The new council established its offices at the Shirehall but, in the early 1950s, civic leaders decided to relocate to a building at No. 4 London Street, which then became Swaffham Town Hall.\nThe building continued to serve in a judicial capacity until the court hearings relocated elsewhere in the county and the building was converted into apartments in the late 1980s.\n\n\n== References ==",

It sold by Christie's in 2006 for US$1,360,000.\nIt the artist's interpretation of maple syrup season with people busy at various tasks, set in a typical Moses winter setting. The figures are getting ready to pour sryup on snow for children, take empty buckets to hang on taps driven into maple trees, or carry full buckets with a yoke towards a bonfire to boil the sap down into syrup, known as sugaring off. The subject of this painting had been a recurring theme since 1939 and became a bestseller for the artist.\nThis painting was acquired by Cole Porter who gifted it to Cy Feuer.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGalerie St. Etienne\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\"Sugaring Off |\". christies.com.

In the Mešić family, in addition to father Meha and mother Zejfa, Hajrudin had a brother and two sisters. He completed eight years of school in Srednja and Donja Trnova. After finishing elementary school, he attended and graduated from the JNA non-commissioned officer school in Sarajevo. During his service in the JNA, he graduated part-time from the JNA military academy in Belgrade and received the rank of captain. The war in the territory of the former Yugoslavia found him in the rank of captain, in the service of the JNA in Karlovac, Croatia. In 1991 he left the JNA and Croatia, bringing his family back to Ugljevik. There, he was named the commander of the Ugljevik militia station. In the Teočak area, he spearheaded the creation of patriotic forces with a smaller faction. At the start of the war, he decided to leave the region because he was the commander of the Ugljevik Militia Station and refused to swear loyalty to the newly formed Serbian municipal government. With a group of like-minded people, he moved to Teocak, where he became the commander of the Territorial Defense of Teočak. On September 16, 1992, with the formation of the 1st Teočan, later the 255th famous mountain brigade, he became its commander. He died on October 30, 1992, in the village of Nezuk, while trying to break through the corridor towards the besieged Kamenica. After this, the 1st Teočan Brigade was renamed the Hajrudin Mešić Brigade. Captain Mešić is survived by his wife Radenka, daughter Lejla, and son Zlatko.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nHe received the highest war awards: the Order of Golden Lily and the Golden Police Badge. In addition, he was posthumously promoted to the rank of brigadier general, and awarded the Order of the Hero of the Liberation War of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Blues–Flyers brawl was a fight involving players, fans, and police officers that took place during a National Hockey League (NHL) game between the Philadelphia Flyers and the St. Louis Blues on January 6, 1972, at the Spectrum in Philadelphia. St. Louis-based television station KSDK called the event \"one of the worst player-fan-police fights in hockey history\".\nAt the end of the second period, with the Flyers leading 2–0, Blues head coach Al Arbour, followed by Blues defenseman Bob Plager, approached referee John Ashley on a ramp leading off the ice to complain about his officiating. While on the ramp, fans began pouring drinks on and pelting Arbour and Ashley with trash, and, after Plager said one fan \"took a swing at [Arbour]\", Plager rushed into the stands to confront the fan. He was quickly joined by other members of the Blues team as a largescale brawl broke out between the fans and players. A large group of police arrived and, after about 25 minutes, were able to restore order. Arbour and several other players received injuries that required multiple stitches, while several police officers and fans received minor injuries.\nAfter discussions with officials, the game was allowed to continue, with the Blues scoring three unanswered goals to win the game. Following the game, the police arrested Arbour and three players—John Arbour (no relation), Phil Roberto, and Floyd Thomson—who were charged with disorderly conduct and assault and battery on police officers, though these charges were later dropped. Reporting on the event in the 2020s, KSDK called the event the \"wildest night in franchise history\" for the Blues, while the SB Nation affiliate for the Blues listed the brawl as the number one fight in the franchise's history.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe Philadelphia Flyers and the St. Louis Blues had both joined the National Hockey League (NHL) as expansion teams during the 1967 NHL expansion, and going into the 1971–72 season, both teams were in the league's West Division. According to Jeremy Rutherford, a sportswriter for the Blues, both teams shared a rivalry in their early years, with Fox Sports commentator Scott Warmann describing the teams' matchups during this time as part of a \"heated rivalry\". On January 6, 1972, the two teams were scheduled to play each other in Philadelphia, at the Flyers' home arena, the Spectrum. Prior to the game, the Blues were 10–22–7 for the season, while the Flyers were 11–19–6.\n\n\n== Game ==\n\n\n=== Prior to the brawl ===\nFollowing a scoreless first period, the Flyers' Bob Kelly scored early in the second period. Near the end of the period, Jim Johnson of the Flyers scored quickly following a face-off, putting Philadelphia in a 2–0 lead. Following this second goal, St. Louis Blues Head Coach Al Arbour complained to the referee, John Ashley, regarding his officiating. At the end of the second period, Arbour followed Ashley across the ice and up the ramp towards the officials' dressing room, where the ice resurfacer comes onto the ice. Players from both teams were heading to their respective locker rooms for the intermission, but Blues defenseman Bob Plager decided to follow Arbour.\n\n\n=== Brawl ===\nWhile on the ramp, a fan in the bleachers poured a beer onto Arbour, which initiated a scuffle. Fans began throwing their drinks and trash at Arbour and Ashley and, according to Plager, after one fan \"took a swing at [Arbour]\", Plager dropped his ice hockey stick, took off his gloves, and rushed into the stands to confront the fan. Plager's brothers and teammates, Barclay and Bill, followed after him into the stands to confront the unruly fans. Soon, other Blues players had joined the fray, led by Plager, and began brawling with some of the fans in the stands. In total, about ten Blues players were involved in the incident, including Garry Unger, who swung his hockey stick while in the stands. As part of a giveaway promotion that night at the Spectrum, many fans received free miniature replica hockey sticks, which some used as weapons during the scuffle. Ed Snider, the founder and owner of the Flyers, was in the arena at the time and made his way to the area to intervene, later saying about the incident, \"I saw the glazed eyes of their players and got scared for myself\". No Flyers players were involved in the fray, in part because the entire team had returned to their locker room by the time the fighting had started.\n\nAt the time of the incident, there were a few members of the Philadelphia Police Department at the Spectrum. However, after a 16 year old in the stands made a call to the police on a payphone in the arena, a larger group arrived at the scene. Dave Moulder, a patrolman who was among the first to arrive, later said regarding the event, \"It was the Blues' sticks against our batons. They were swinging wildly, and caught a couple of people pretty good. Our advantage was that they couldn't keep their balance on the concrete floor on their skates\". In total, roughly 200 police officers were involved in the incident. At some point during the fracas, Arbour was struck in the head by a police officer with a baton, which led to more mayhem and direct confrontations between players and police. Plager attempted to intervene by pulling on the officer who had struck Arbour, during which time Plager was also hit with a baton. Blues player Phil Roberto later stated that he also grabbed the officer who struck Arbour and put him into a chokehold because he was afraid he would try to hit Arbour again. In a 2022 interview, Roberto said that many of the players became involved in the scuffle because of the immense support that Arbour had from his team members. The incident lasted about 25 minutes before order was restored, with police officers directing Blues players to their locker room area.\n\n\n=== After the brawl ===\nAccording to Gary Miller, a sportswriter for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch who was present at the game, the police initially wanted to place the entire Blues team under arrest, and multiple players were placed in handcuffs. While there was some discussion on cancelling the game, the police eventually reached an agreement with the referees to allow the game to finish. However, the brawl caused a delay to the start of the third period, due in part to the fact that the Blues' athletic trainer had to spend time resharpening ice skates that had been dulled by players walking on the concrete in the stands. Because Arbour had had pieces of his clothing removed, damaged, and bloodied, he coached the third period while wearing a t-shirt and a sport jacket. In the third period, the Blues rallied and scored three unanswered goals from players Roberto, Unger, and Gary Sabourin, to beat the Flyers 3–2.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\n\n=== Injuries ===\n\nTwo police officers and four fans suffered minor injuries from the fracas, with the fans receiving medical care from the arena's medical staff. On the Blues team, multiple players and staff members received cuts that required stitches, including Head Coach Arbour and player John Arbour (no relation), who both required multiple stitches for their injuries. John's injury, a gash on the back of his head that had been caused by a police officer striking him with a hockey stick, required 40 stitches.\n\n\n=== Arrests and legal actions ===\nDuring the game, Philadelphia Mayor Frank Rizzo ordered a police van to the Spectrum to arrest some of the Blues team members who had been involved in the brawl. At the start of the third period, as the Blues players left the locker room to go to the ice, police recorded the jersey numbers of several of the players for use in making arrests after the game. Bob Plager noticed the police presence and, worried about having his number recorded, told the team's athletic trainer to lock him in the locker room and tell the police the room was empty. Plager left the locker room and rejoined his team on the ice after the police had left the area. Plager's strategy seemingly worked, as despite being involved in the brawl, he was not one of the several players arrested following the game. Instead, after the game was over and the players changed out of their hockey uniforms, police arrested Al Arbour, John Arbour, Phil Roberto, and Floyd Thomson, taking them to the police precinct at 24th Street and Wolf Street in South Philadelphia. Both Miller and Blues owner Sidney Salomon Jr. followed the arrested team members to the precinct. No fans were arrested.\n\nOvernight, the players and coach were fingerprinted and interrogated by the police, and in the early morning of January 7, they were transported to the police department's main headquarters in Center City for arraignment. By 6 a.m., Snider had come to the police station and bailed out the Blues team members, paying $500 for each of the arrested. At their hearing, the arrested were charged with disorderly conduct and assault and battery on police officers, while an additional charge of conspiracy to incite a riot was dropped. All of the arrested except for John Arbour were charged with simple assault, with John receiving a harsher charge of aggravated assault. These charges carried maximum fines of $1,000 and jail sentences of up to two years. During their hearings, all of the arrested gave the address for the Blues' home venue, the St. Louis Arena, when the judge asked for their addresses. The four were ultimately released and able to reunite with the rest of the team at their hotel before their return flight to St. Louis.\nSalomon was described by Roberto as being \"livid\" and vowed to fight the charges against his players and staff. He also criticized the Flyers management and the actions of the Philadelphia Police Department, calling the latter \"police brutality\". The four had their preliminary hearing scheduled in Philadelphia for February 7, the day after another Blues–Flyers game. Immediately following the incident, NHL President Clarence Campbell declined to comment on the matter, saying that he needed more time to assess the facts on the case. In the middle of 1972, the arrested individuals met with Campbell to discuss the matter, but it became a moot issue, as the criminal charges against them were all eventually dropped.\n\n\n=== Legacy ===\nContemporary coverage of the event from the Associated Press described it as a \"near-riot\" and a \"melee-filled\" game, and it was given headline coverage by the Philadelphia Daily News. Later reporting from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch called it \"a wild stick-swinging melee\", while St. Louis-based television station KSDK has called the event \"one of the worst player-fan-police fights in hockey history\" and the \"wildest night in franchise history\" for the Blues. In 2021, St. Louis Game Time, the SB Nation affiliate for the Blues, ranked the fight number one in a list of the top ten fights in the franchise's history.\nIn 2022, a news report on the event from KSDK called the game a \"rallying point\" for the Blues, as the team made it to the playoffs that year, advancing as far as the semifinals before losing to the Boston Bruins, the eventual Stanley Cup champions. According to former Blues player and color commentator Bernie Federko, the Blues success against the Flyers, including in this game, may have played a part in the Flyers' shift to a more aggressive style of play in the following seasons, referred to as the \"Broad Street Bullies\" period, during which time Philadelphia became a more competitive team and won several Stanley Cup championships. Following this game, it would take the Blues 16 years before they were able to beat the Flyers in the Spectrum again.\n\n\n== Box score ==\n\nNumber in parentheses represents the player's total in goals or assists to that point of the season\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of violent spectator incidents in sports\nViolence in ice hockey\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nMacnow, Glen; Gargano, Anthony L.

        "content": "The 2024–25 Louisville Cardinals men's basketball team will represent the University of Louisville during the 2024–25 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The team will play its home games on Denny Crum Court at the KFC Yum! Center in downtown Louisville, Kentucky as members of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). They will be led by first-year head coach Pat Kelsey.\n\n\n== Previous season ==\nThe Cardinals began the season with a one-point win against UMBC but lost to Chattanooga in their second game of the season. After defeating Coppin State, they lost both of their games in the Empire Classic. They then went on a two-game winning streak, including an overtime victory over New Mexico State. They went on a three-game losing streak from there, including an opening ACC game loss to Virginia Tech. Their only other win in 2023 was on December 17 against Pepperdine. The Cardinals first ACC win game at Miami (FL) on January 10, 2024. This was Kenny Payne's first road win as head coach. The team lost six straight games after the win. Their next wins came on February 3 and February 10, 2024, and were split by a road loss to Syracuse. The Cardinals would lose their final seven games of the ACC regular season.\nThe Cardinals finished the 2023–24 season 8–24 and 3–17 in ACC play to finish in fifteenth place. As the fifteenth seed in the ACC tournament, they lost to tenth seed NC State in the First Round. They were not invited to the NCAA tournament or the NIT.

        "content": "Kaye Bernard is an activist known for her work as a refugee advocate and labor leader on Australia's Christmas Island. She served as general secretary of the Union of Christmas Island Workers from 2010 to 2012. \n\n\n== Work ==\nBernard first became involved with refugee issues on Christmas Island around 2003. Based in Perth, she began visiting the island to help those held at the major detention center there. Bernard went on to spend many years working to help support and release Southeast Asian refugee families being detained there. Her activism included campaigning, connecting refugees with legal services, visiting detainees, and writing about their situations in publications such as the Islander.\nBernard's increasing involvement with issues on Christmas Island led her, in November 2010, to become general secretary of the Union of Christmas Island Workers (UCIW), settling full time on the island. The union at the time was focused on representing the guards, cleaners, drivers, and administrative staff at the detention center, which at the time had a growing population of well over 2,000 detainees.\nIn 2011, as general secretary of the union, Bernard led criticism of overcrowding, understaffing, and lack of access to medical care for detainees at the center. She condemned privatization of the detention centers, which she argued had exacerbated poor conditions for both detainees and staff. \nShe continued to lead the UCIW until March 2012.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Tanaka Yoshimasa (田中吉政, 1548 - February 18, 1609), was a prominent military commander and daimyō during the Sengoku period to the early Edo period. He was the lord of Chikugo Province and played a significant role in the urban development of several cities, including Omihachiman in Omi Province (present-day Omihachiman City, Shiga Prefecture), Okazaki in Mikawa Province (present-day Okazaki City, Aichi Prefecture), and Yanagawa in Chikugo Province (present-day Yanagawa City, Fukuoka Prefecture). These cities still bear the influence of his city planning efforts to this day.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nThe birthplace of Tanaka Yoshimasa is said to be in either Mikawa village or Miyabe village in Asai District (currently Sanawa-cho, Nagahama City, and Miyabe-cho). There is a theory that Yoshimasa himself was a farmer living there. One piece of evidence for this is the record of Yoshimasa, who later became the head of the Takejima festival and Renkai-kai limited to the residents of Asai District, serving as the head of the Yanagawa Domain. There is a tradition in Mikawa village regarding the birth of Tanaka Yoshimasa. Records show that Yoshimasa served under Miyabe Tsugunobu, a local lord in Miyabe village. It is known that Yoshimasa's mother, the sister of Kunitomo Yosamon (a retainer of Miyabe Tsugunobu), hailed from Kunitomo village in Sakata District, which is close to Miyabe village and Mikawa village (at that time, a major producer of firearms, now known as Kunitomo-cho, Nagahama City). However, there are few records before the Omi-Hachiman era.  \n\n\n== Tenure as a chief retainer to Toyotomi Hideyoshi ==\n\nAround 1582, Tanaka Yoshimasa was granted 5,000 koku and became the chief retainer of Hashiba Hidekatsu (later known as Toyotomi Hideyoshi). In 1585, when Hideyoshi was granted 430,000 koku in Omi Yahata, Yoshimasa became the head clan retainer. At that time, other retainers who also served under Hideyoshi, such as Kazuie Nakamura, Hori Yoshiharu, Yamauchi Kazutoyo, and Ichiryu Naosue, each had their own castle. However, Yoshimasa resided in Hideyoshi's castle, Yahata-yama Castle, and managed political affairs as the chief elder statesman. In 1586, there is a description related to the involvement of the Oda government in the province of Mikawa. During this period, there are relatively many extant letters written by Yoshimasa. Oda Nobunaga relocated the town under Azuchi Castle to Hachiman Castle and carried out town planning. Until the middle of the Edo period, an area named Kyubei-cho remained as a part of the town of Omihachiman.\n\n\n== Mikawa-Okazaki period ==\nIn the Azuchi-Momoyama period, specifically in 1590, Toyotomi Hideyoshi successfully conquered the Hojo clan in the Kanto region and proceeded to reassign various daimyo to different territories. As a result of this reorganization, Tokugawa Ieyasu was transferred to the Kanto region, while Oda Nobukatsu was reduced to a 20,000 koku fief in Shimotsuke Province, Umayama. This reshuffling left an opening in Owari Province, which was then granted to Toyotomi Hidetsugu. Yoshimasa, who had previously distinguished himself as part of the Hidetsugu forces during the Siege of Odawara, was rewarded with a 57,400 koku fief at Okazaki Castle in Mikawa Province. He was also tasked with overseeing the construction of the Owari embankment, playing a crucial role in the procurement of necessary resources for the project. In 1595, Hidetsugu committed suicide. Along with him, ten others including Kimura Shigenari, Maeno Kageyasu, Haneda Masachika, Hattori Kazutada, Wadase Shigeari, Akashi Norizane, Ichigyu Kuyu, Hideyongu, Shirae Narisada, and Kumagai Naoyuki were executed. Many other retainers were punished, but there were no repercussions for Yoshimasa and other senior vassals. It's uncertain whether Ishida Mitsunari was involved. However, some suggested seppuku for Yoshimasa, who was once an elder advisor to the Shogun.\nUltimately, Yoshimasa was spared any punishment and was granted an increase of 28,358 koku and further 14,252 koku in 1596, making him a daimyo with a total of 100,000 koku in Okazaki Castle, Mikawa Province.\nYoshimasa renovated Okazaki Castle into a modern fortress. He constructed Tanaka moat, encircling seven townships with moats. He also reclaimed the low wetlands on the west side. Furthermore, he redirected the Tokaido, originally passing through the outskirts of Okazaki, to run through the heart of the town, creating a winding road known as \"Okazaki's 27 turns.\"\n\n\n== Battle of Sekigahara ==\n\nAfter Hideyoshi's death, Yoshimasa approached Tokugawa Ieyasu, and in September 1600, he sided with the Eastern army in the Battle of Sekigahara. During the Siege of Gifu Castle before the Battle of Sekigahara, he, along with Kuroda Nagamasa and Tōdō Takatora, annihilated the Western forces moving from Ogaki Castle to Gifu Castle at Kawawatari. At this time, Sugie Kanbei, a retainer of Ishida Mitsunari, was slain by Tsuji Shigekatsu, one of Yoshimasa's vassals. In the main battle, he clashed with the forces of Ishida Mitsunari alongside Kuroda Nagamasa's army.\nAfter the battle, he, along with Kuroda Nagamasa (a relative of Akashi Matatarō who fought on the frontline), aided the escape of Yamada Yukikazu and Akashi Matatarō.\nFollowing the victory of the Eastern army, Yoshimasa played a significant role in capturing Ishida Mitsunari, who was fleeing in the mountains of Ibuki, by infiltrating his stronghold, Sawayama Castle, from the rear with Miyauchi Nagafusa (Nagahiro). The actual captors were Tanaka Denshemon and Sawada Shōemon. Although Mitsunari was suffering from abdominal pain, he refused the medicine recommended by the physician. Therefore, Yoshimasa, after careful consideration, persuaded him to eat leek porridge under the guise of being good for his health, and Mitsunari is said to have consumed it. When Mitsunari met Yoshimasa, he presented Yoshimasa with a short sword granted by the Taiko (Sasayanagi Tantō, attributed to Ishida Sadamune, housed in the Tokyo National Museum), which is said to be a courteous gesture (It is said that Mitsunari, upon being captured, remarked, \"It's better to be captured by you than by anyone else\"). Mitsunari's Ōdachi (Sazenoyu, made by Bingo Kai Miyamoto Masamasa) was handed over to Tanaka Denshemon (Tanaka Yoshitada, the captor. After the war, recognizing these meritorious deeds, Yoshimasa was granted the domain of 320,000 koku at Yanagawa Castle in Chikugo Province, becoming a daimyo with territory holdings.\n\n\n== The Era of Chikugo Province Lords ==\nTanaka Yoshimasa, through the development of canal networks such as the Yanagawa moats, facilitated water transport and irrigation for rice cultivation, thus fostering modern urban development. He also focused on land infrastructure by constructing roads like the Tanaka Highway (present-day Fukuoka Prefectural Road No. 23), connecting Yanagawa and Kurume, as well as roads linking Yanagawa with Yame Fukushima and Kuroki. Furthermore, he undertook projects such as embankment reinforcement along the Yabe River and the construction of embankments called \"Keicho Hondoi\" along the Ariake Sea coastline, aiming to increase income. He also worked on land reclamation projects in the Ariake Sea.\nTanaka Yoshimasa died in Fushimi, Kyoto, at the age of 62 on February 18, 1620. Since Yoshimasa's successor, Tanaka Tadamasa passed away without leaving a male heir, the Tanaka clan was deprived of its domain in 1620. Some attribute this to Tadamasa's tolerance toward Christianity and his relatively mild policies following the ban on Christianity. However, collateral relatives managed to preserve the clan line by becoming retainers of other houses.\n\n\n== Burial sites ==\nMakyoji Temple (Pure Land Shinshu sect) in Teramachi, Kurume, served as a temporary mortuary temple (though there are no graves there).\nHis graves are located at Makasho-ji Temple in Yanagawa City (Pure Land Shinshu sect: mortuary temple), Zendoji Temple in Kurume City (Jodo sect head temple), Jishoji Temple in Komagome, Tokyo (Soto Zen sect), and Ryuko-in Temple at Kennin-ji Temple, Kurodani, Kyoto (Pure Land Shinshu sect: mortuary temple) cemetery, among others.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of han\nAbolition of the han system\nYanagawa Domain\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Frank Joseph Fogarty (1878–1925) was a vaudeville comedian, actor and singer, nicknamed the Dublin minstrel. While being among the best known vaudeville artists of his time, he is now mostly remembered for his association with the Last Word cocktail.\n\n\n== Life ==\nFogarty was the son of an Irish immigrant. His father Patrick Fogarty was born 1839 in Tipperary (Ireland) and moved to New York City shortly before the civil war. There he settled in Brooklyn, got married and worked for the Pinkerton detective agency. Fogarty had an older brother Frank, who became the manager of a jewelry firm and was involved in local politics for the Democratic party.\nFogarty started to perform on local stages in Brooklyn at the age of seven, where he was singing songs and doing impersonations of actors and celebrities of the day. As a young adult he shortly worked for a jewelry store before pursuing a career as a professional vaudeville monologist. Fogarty went on to become a well known vaudeville artist performing a throughout  the United States and acquired the nickname the Dublin minstrel. His performances usually started with a song and ended with a heart-throb recitation. In 1912 he won the The New York Morning Telegraph's contest for best vaudeville artist and 1914 he was elected president of The White Rats (vaudeville actors union).  Around 1918 he retired from professional performing and worked as the executive secretary to the borough president of Brooklyn for the last eight years of his life. He died of pneumonia on April 5 in 1925.\nFogarty was married twice. First to Helen Trix and then from 1915 until his death to the actress Grace Edmonds, with whom he had one son.\n\n\n== The Last Word cocktail ==\nThe Last Word cocktail is commonly associated with Fogarty although the exact nature of his connection to the drink remains unclear. His association with the Last Word is due to the description in Ted Saucier's 1951 cocktail book Bottoms Up!, which also yields the oldest known recipe of it. At the time of its publication Ted Saucier was working at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City.\n\nCourtesy, Detroit Athletic Club, Detroit \"This cocktail was introduced here about thirty years ago by Frank Fogarty who was very well known in vaudeville. He was called the 'Dublin Minstrel', and was a very fine monologue artist.\"\nResearch in the archives of Detroit Athletic Club revealed that a menu from 1916 did offer a Last Word cocktail as its most expensive cocktail for a price of 35 cents (equivalent to $9.8 in 2023). It also showed that Fogarty had visited the club in December 1916, when the Last Word was already on the menu. However neither a recipe for the cocktail nor any further information on Fogarty's connection to it was discovered.\nThis has led to different interpretations of Fogarty's role in the cocktail history. Some assume that he learned about the cocktail during his visit of the club in 1916 and introduced it afterwards to New York City. Others speculate that he was involved in the creation of the cocktail itself during one of his performances in Detroit in the 1910s or that his performances as monologist there simply inspired the name for cocktail.\nAfter the cocktail's resurgence in the 2000s it inspired a lot of variations. One of them is the Dublin Minstrel in which the gin gets replaced by a whiskey.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\ntombstone at Brooklyn cemetary",

        "content": "William Atkinson Lowther (11 February 1913 – 10 October 1982) was a motorcycle speedway rider from England.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nLowther, born in Low Fell, Gateshead, began racing speedway bikes on the grasstrack circuits in Newcastle. In 1936, after a trial with Southampton Saints he was offered a deal but chose to join Bristol Bulldogs, where he rode in the 1936 Provincial Speedway League season. He then signed on with New Cross Tamers.\nHowever, the following season in 1937, Lowther started racing at Leicester and then Middlesbrough and Rye House respectively before competing in the league for Harringay Tigers. Lowther struggled at Harringay in the reserve berth, which led to him completing the 1983 season on loan with the Lea Bridge Cubs in division 2.\nLowther returned to Middlesbrough Bears in 1939 and enjoyed a good season up to the point when Middlesbrough withdrew from the league, recording an average of 8.25. He then found a home at Glasgow, known as the Lions at the time but the season ended early due to World War II.\nIt was not until after the war that Lowther's career took off, when league speedway finally returned to Glasgow for the 1946 Speedway Northern League season. He became a fans' favourite at Glasgow Tigers and would ride for them for the next four years becoming their number 1 rider and captain and recording averages of 9.67 and 9.28 respectively.\nIn late 1949, after ten years with the club he shocked Glasgow by handing in a transfer request citing the fact that he had not been chosen to ride for the Scotland national speedway team (riders based in Scotland were eligible for the team). He rode for Newcastle until returning to Scotland to ride for the Motherwell Eagles from 1951 to 1952, where he ended his career.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "César, or César and Ernestine, is a Belgian comic strip series by author Maurice Tillieux.\nIt features a cartoonist, César, who has to cope with everyday problems, and Ernestine, his neighbor's daughter, whom he has to look after. He must also put up with his cleaning lady, Églantine, and his neighbor, police officer Petitcarné.\nThe series, first published in Spirou between 1957 and 1959, was then transferred to Le Moustique between 1959 and 1966 before the gags appearing in Le Moustique were republished in Spirou and its Dutch-language edition Robbedoes from 1969 to 1973. In parallel, the series was published in four paperback editions, then reissued as a complete series in the 1980s and 90s, as well as in November 2011.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe series follows the daily life of César, a single cartoonist. He'd like to lead a quiet life, but unfortunately for him, he has to put up with Ernestine, his neighbor's daughter, whom he has to look after, the police officer Petitcarné, neighbor and Ernestine's father, who gives him tickets for nothing, and the impossible-to-live-with cleaning lady Églantine.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe series was first published in Spirou between 1957 and 1959. Caesar's first appearance was in Spirou No. 1004, July 11, 1957, in a two-page story called Petit divertissement en chambre. This first appearance was a rough sketch of the character. He has black hair but already owns an old car.\n\nErnest returns in Spirou no. 1042 (April 3, 1958) for a special spring issue in which the police officer Petitcarné, disrupts César's spring cleaning. A third story appeared in Spirou's special issue no. 1055 of July 7, 1958, for the 1958 Brussels World's Fair, in which César and Ernest participate in a model-building competition. A fourth and final story appeared in Spirou no. 1107, July 2, 1959. César's appearance has changed, he wears glasses and his hair has thinned. He looks a little like Fantasio, one of the two heroes of the Spirou et Fantasio series drawn by André Franquin, who was at the time the model for the Spirou newspaper.\nThe series was then published in Le Moustique between 1959 and 1966. César left Spirou to join Le Moustique on December 31, 1959. Le Moustique is published by Dupuis, which also publishes Spirou. For a long time, it acted as a laboratory for Spirou's young authors, but by the end of the 1950s, it was mainly Anglo-Saxon series such as Judd Saxon and Caroline that were published there. Charles Dupuis wanted the magazine to have its hero, so he asked Maurice Tillieux - who had been drawing Gil Jourdan in Spirou since 1956 - to provide one. Maurice Tillieux brought out his character César, created three years earlier in Spirou for four short stories, and modified him slightly by replacing young Ernest with his sister Ernestine. In Le Moustique, the series was published on a half-page, but the layout of the squares - nine squares spread over three strips - would allow it to occupy a full page elsewhere. César's rapid success enabled the series to be published in a full-page format from the nineteenth strip on May 5, 1960.\nSecondary characters are grafted on around César, inspired to Maurice Tillieux by real people more or less close to him: Ernestine is inspired by his youngest daughter, the agent Petitcarné by one of his neighbors, and the cleaning lady Églantine by a cleaning lady who had worked for him. All this little world evolves in a neighborhood inspired to Maurice Tillieux by his neighborhood.\nThe series appeared regularly until July 28, 1966, when Maurice Tillieux stopped the series at gag two hundred and ninety-nine, feeling that he had come to the end of his subject and finding less and less inspiration. This was particularly true of his youngest daughter, who was about to turn eight and no longer uttered the spontaneous lines that inspired Ernestine.\nCésar found a second life when he returned to Spirou from no. 1603, January 2, 1969, and simultaneously to Robbedoes, the Dutch-language equivalent of Spirou until 1973.\nFor the occasion, the gags that had appeared in Le Moustique were put in color and published in no particular order, with the deletion of some whose puns were unadaptable in Dutch. César was published until no. 1863, December 27, 1973. At the same time, four albums featuring the gags published in Spirou were released by Dupuis, while the gags published in Le Moustique and the first gags published in Spirou remained unpublished until the release of the complete Tout César in two volumes.\nThe series was published in parallel in four paperback albums, then reissued as a complete series in the 1980s and 1990s, and again in November 2011.\nIn Spirou no. 3041 of July 24, 1996, cartoonist Godi paid tribute to the series and its author Maurice Tillieux by drawing the three-hundredth gag in the series. Despite its numbering, this gag is only the 298th in the series. There's an error in the numbering of the series. There are two gags no. 33, and no gags no. 35, no. 36 and no. 37. As for gags no. 277 and no. 293, they are seriously modified copies of gags no. 5 and no. 37, respectively. The first four stories published in Spirou between 1957 and 1959 have their numbering, and are not part of the official numbering of the series, which was reset to zero when the series moved to Le Moustique in 1959.\n\n\n== Characters ==\n\nThe hero of the series is César, a bohemian and hardened bachelor cartoonist. His ordinary life is punctuated by everyday troubles, of which he is often the victim. A rebel at heart, he's always repeating: “What's allowed by law must fit on the edge of a postage stamp!”; he's also hot-tempered and kind to the point of being trapped by his goodness. Despite his fits of anger, he's also a peaceful man who likes to smoke a pipe in his armchair and cook, an art in which he excels and knows. He could have a quiet life if he didn't have sticky neighbors around him, a housekeeper who makes trouble, and the local police officer who gave him 3,236 tickets in six months.\nCésar's great accomplice is Ernestine, his neighbor's daughter. She must be around five years old, and possesses the perverse innocence of a child. She doesn't understand the useless complications of the adult world, which leads to some funny, but common-sense remarks. With her incredible repartee, she loves to play tricks, the victim of which is often poor Caesar. Maurice Tillieux drew inspiration for Ernestine's reflections from his own youngest daughter, Anne.Constable Petitcarn is the neighborhood policeman, as well as César's neighbor and Ernestine's father. He likes to write tickets for the smallest of reasons, César being his first victim with 3,236 tickets received in six months. Speaking of César, he likes to say: “I give him tickets for his good ”. A former soldier who fought in the war, he often pesters César with his wartime memories. In his family, he is known to have a sister-in-law who is a farmer and, according to him, never stops having calves. Maurice Tillieux was inspired to create the character by one of his neighbors, who never realized it.\nCésar also has a cleaning lady, Églantine, whose main characteristic is that she's lazy. She buys brooms to lean on while she waits for time to pass, and often complains that pretending to work is more tiring than actually working. Nevertheless, César finds her a good woman; she, for her part, criticizes César for being too intellectual and complicated. A lazy cleaning lady who had worked for Tillieux gave her the idea for this character.\nAgent Petitcarné's son and Ernestine's brother is Ernest. He played Ernestine's role in the very first stories of the series, before being replaced by her. Thereafter, the only mention of him is that he's always busy playing marbles.\n\n\n== Publication ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n==== Album publication history ====\nThe first César et Ernestine album appeared in 1964 in the gag de poche collection published by Dupuis. Containing 123 black-and-white pages, its title was simply César, and the series was not yet called César et Ernestine. Shortly afterwards, César (Deuxième service), the second album in the César series, was released in the Gag de Poche collection, as no. 12. Like the first album, it is in black and white.\nThe revival of César's gags in Spirou gave the series a new lease of life. Editions Dupuis took advantage of the situation to bring out a first large-format album in 1971, entitled L'école des gags. Paperback and in color, the series was renamed for the occasion César et Ernestine (for publications in Spirou, it always bore the name César). The second album, entitled La vie à deux, came out a few months later. The third volume, Quel métier!, in 1972. The fourth volume, Au fil des mauvais jours, was not released until two years later, in 1974. Despite these four albums, many of the César et Ernestine gags published in Le Moustique and Spirou remained unpublished. \nThey remained unpublished until 1988, when the first volume of Tout César came out, entitled Tout César - L'école des gags, and listing in chronological order the issues published in Le Moustique. It runs to 156 pages and is numbered 7, following the numbering of the earlier Tout Gil Jourdan albums by the same author, which comprised six volumes. The following year, 1989, saw the release of volume two, Au fil des (mauvais) jours, with 160 pages and no. 8.\nIn 1997, a new 160-page complete edition was released, entitled Tout César - Tome 1. Followed a few months later by volume two.\n\n\n==== The original collection ====\nL'école des gags, Dupuis, 1971 (Script and drawing: Maurice Tillieux)\nLa vie à deux, Dupuis, 1971 (Script and drawing: Maurice Tillieux)\nQuel métier, Dupuis, 1972 (Script and drawing: Maurice Tillieux)\nAu fil des mauvais jours, Dupuis, 1974  (Script and drawing: Maurice Tillieux)\n\n\n==== Special issues ====\nGP 1 César, Dupuis, Gag de poche, 1964 (Script and drawing: Maurice Tillieux - Color: Black and white)\nGP 2 César (Deuxième service), Dupuis, Gag de poche, 1964 (Script and drawing: Maurice Tillieux - Color: Black and White)\nTT 7 Tout César - L'école des gags, Dupuis, 1988 (Script and drawing: Maurice Tillieux)\nTT 8 Tout César - Au fil des (mauvais) jours, Dupuis, 1989 (Script  and drawing: Maurice Tillieux)\nTT 1 Tout César - Tome 1, Dupuis, 1997 (Script and drawing: Maurice Tillieux)\nTT 2 Tout César - Volume 2, Dupuis, 1997 (Script and drawing : Maurice Tillieux)\n\n\n=== Magazines ===\n\nThe series was created in Spirou No. 1004 on July 11, 1957, for the duration of four short stories. At the request of publisher Charles Dupuis, it was transferred on December 31, 1959, to Le Moustique, also owned by Editions Dupuis. The series was published in gag form once a week until it was finally discontinued on July 28, 19665. Subsequently, the gags published in Le Moustique were colored and reprinted as “filler” in Spirou and its Dutch-language equivalent Robbedoes. Due to the difficulty of translating the puns into Dutch, not all the gags in the series were reprinted in Spirou. The series made its last appearance in Spirou no. 1863, December 27, 1973. However, in Spirou no. 1999, one of Caesar's first stories was reprinted under the name Classiques Dupuis and in no. 3041, July 24, 1996, cartoonist Godi paid tribute to the series with a gag, no. 300.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSpirou (magazine)\nMaurice Tillieux\nDupuis\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nTillieux, Maurice (1988).

        "content": "The Old Oaken Bucket, The Last is a 1947 oil painting by the American outsider painter Grandma Moses, produced at age 86 and signed \"Moses\". It was sold at Sotheby's in 2006 for US$598,400.\nIt shows a scene of the artist's interpretation of Samuel Woodworth's poem The Old Oaken Bucket, set in a typical Moses winter setting. The figures are taking part in various scenes described by the poem, but the central object, the oaken bucket itself, is barely visible near the well. A summer version of this painting won the New York State Prize in 1941 and the subject became a bestseller for the artist.\nThe title of this painting may indicate the artist felt at the time that this would be her last version, but she would continue to paint summer and winter versions of this story over the next five years. The painting was previously owned by Garson Kanin and Ruth Gordon. The painting also became the cover for Cathie Pelletier's novel The Weight of Winter, in 1991.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGalerie St. Etienne\n\n\n== References ==\n\nImage of the painting on artnet\n\"The Old Oaken Bucket, The Last |\". sothebys.com.

        "content": "The Museum of Solidarity Salvador Allende (MSSA) (Spanish: Museo de la Solidaridad Salvador Allende) is a contemporary art museum located in Santiago, Chile, named after Salvador Allende, President of Chile between 1970 and 1973.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Museum of Solidarity (1971-1973) ===\nIn 1971, Spanish art critic José María Moreno Galván proposed the creation of an art museum in support of the government of the Unidad Popular. After the project was approved by Salvador Allende himself, the Comité Internacional de Solidaridad Artística con Chile (CISAC) (International Committee of Artistic Solidarity with Chile) was formed, bringing together national and international intellectuals such as the Brazilian intellectual Mário Pedrosa and the Italian Carlo Levi.\nAllende call to artists worldwide through an open letter, and as a result of CISAC's efforts, artworks began to arrive promptly from different parts of the world between 1972 and 1973, totaling 650 artistic pieces, including paintings, prints, sculptures, drawings, tapestries, and photographs. Artists like Joan Miró, Roberto Matta, Lygia Clark, and Frank Stella sent their contributions during this period.\nThe Museum of Solidarity was officially inaugurated on May 17, 1972, by President Allende with an exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art of the University of Chile. However, it did not manage to have its own physical space nor did it have a legal entity, being managed by the Institute of Latin American Art of the University of Chile.\nAfter the coup d'état on September 11, 1973, the museum was closed, its managers suffered exile, and part of the collection was lost. Some pieces were stored in the Santiago Museum of Contemporary Art, while others ended up at the National Museum of Fine Arts.\n\n\n=== International Museum of Resistance Salvador Allende (1975-1990) ===\nThe project started up again in Havana and Paris, with the name Museo Internacional de la Resistencia Salvador Allende (MIRSA, International Museum of Resistance Salvador Allende), under the leadership of Miria Contreras, President Allende's former assistant, in collaboration with the museum founders. Exiled artists including José Balmes, Pedro Miras, and Carmen Waugh, continued to call for donations of artworks to support resistance in Chile, organizing exhibitions that denounced human rights violations throughout Europe.\".\n\n\n=== Museum of Solidarity Salvador Allende (1990-) ===\nWith the return to democracy in Chile, the Salvador Allende Foundation began the recovery of works from the collection in 1990. In September 1991, the Museum of Solidarity was reopened at the National Museum of Fine Arts at the same time that the Solidarity Collection was transferred from the museum to the national state.\nIn 1992, the Chilean state loaned the collection works to the Salvador Allende Foundation. Since 2005, the Arte y Solidaridad Foundation has been responsible for managing, disseminating, researching, and activating its collection and historical archive, and the Museum of Solidarity was moved to the Heiremans Palace in the Republic neighborhood of Santiago.\nOn December 10, 2023, the museum received 18 works from the Museum of Contemporary Art of Villafamés (MACVAC) in Spain, which had been stored in that country for over 30 years.\n\n\n== Building ==\nThe museum is housed in the Palacio Heiremans, which was constructed in 1925 for Belgian entrepreneur Amadeo Heiremans Vaerman. During the Military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, the building works as a detention center and a listening station of the DINA. It is located in the República neighborhood.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==",

        "content": "Boy is an extended play by Australian singer-songwriter Luke Hemmings. It was released on 26 April 2024.\nWriting about the inspiration for the project on social media, Hemming said “I wrote these songs in a moment in my life when I found myself questioning everything I thought I knew about the world & myself. All the emotions, fears and grief that came with it.”\n\n\n== Composition ==\n\n\n=== Song ===\n\"I'm Still Your Boy\" is about understanding my youth that was marred with trauma amidst beauty, whilst trying to become a good man. ‘I’m Still Your Boy’ walks on the high wire between boyhood and adulthood, looking both ways.\n“Shakes” was a song where I was putting myself in different perspectives. Whatever lens I see the world through seems to come through in the song. [It] is sort of that point you get to emotionally where you're just not really thinking or seeing clearly. Just talking and acting out of emotion.\n\"Benny.\" This song is named after my brother, Ben, but in its entirety, it represents all of my loved ones and the guilt I feel being away from my family and living on the periphery of their world.\nI wrote \"Close My Eyes\" as I headed into my late twenties and felt an unavoidable wave of fear and anxiety towards the inevitable death of my youth.\nI had the idea for \"Garden Life\" when I couldn't sleep in a hotel room somewhere in the world, sometime around 3am. It's really just an existential love song to my happiest and safest place.\nThe beauty in \"Close Enough to Feel You\" is all in the details, both sonically and lyrically. Sometimes when you suffer a big emotional loss, something so mundane and otherwise unnoticed can become earth-shattering. This song is about the willingness and desire to live in that pain in order to feel close to who or what you lost, rather than moving on.\n\"Promises\" was the song written for the EP that finally made me feel like I was really onto something. It's about a time in my life when I saw the world through grey-coloured glasses. I was a pessimist, struggling with depression and my mental health, who fell in love and started to see colour for the first time.\n\n\n== Tour ==\nOn 12 March 2024, Hemmings announced the Nostalgia for a Time That Never Existed (a tour by Luke Hemmings). The tour will begin on 4 May 2024, in Paris, France and will conclude on 16 June 2024, in Brisbane, Australia.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Bemidji Sports Arena in Bemidji, Minnesota was a multipurpose indoor ice rink. Built originally in 1935, the venue was demolished after heavy snow caused the roof to collapse in January of 1949.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the summer of 1935, the Bemidji city council cancelled plans to build a new airport hangar. Instead, they repurposed the $1,500 worth of timber that had been allocated for the project to build the first indoor ice rink for the town. After the local curling club agreed to chip in $2,000 towards construction and the local park board agreed to cover the maintenance costs once completed, the city began to move forward with the project. The former cite of Central High School, which had burned down in 1921, was chosen for the rink. Construction went quickly and the building was finished in time for the Christmas skating season.\nInitially the venue was used for curling and public skating, however, figure skating events were soon held as well. In 1947, the local teachers college, Bemidji State, began to sponsor ice hockey as a varsity sport and they used the Sports Arena as their first home. During the winter of the following year, heavy snow accumulated on the roof of the building during the Christmas season. On January 4, the roof gave way and collapsed over the skater's section. Fortunately, there were few skaters on the ice at the time and no one was seriously injured. The building was razed afterwards as it could not be safely repaired. It would be more than 15 years before another indoor rink would be built in Bemidji.\n\n\n== References ==",

It has been described as 'a piece of Italy's cultural, social and political history'.\n\n\n== History and profile ==\nThe magazine was founded by Max Stefani, Paolo Carù e Aldo Pedron in Rome in 1977 as a monthly music magazine, mostly focused on rock music. Initially centered on American and British classic rock, it gradually broadened its scope to include new trends such as punk and new wave, as well as the Italian rock scene.  \nIn 1980, the co-founders Carù and Pedron abandoned the magazine to fund a rival magazine, Buscadero. Another major split happened in the late 1980s, when most of the staff left the magazine to join Velvet, a competing magazine founded by the former Mucchio collaborators Maurizio Bianchini, Federico Guglielmi and Eddy Cilia, but in spite of it, the magazine kept selling strong. In September 1996, the magazine underwent a major reorganization, becoming weekly, and adopting a smaller format at a lower price. In 2001, Federico Guglielmi, who in the meanwhile had reprised his collaboration, launched a quarterly spin-off Mucchio Extra, which was published until mis-2010s. Starting from 2005, the magazine reprised its monthly frequence and its classical format. \nFollowing the abandon of its founder Max Stefani in 2011, and a scandal involving the public funds that the magazine had received and which had been used for personal purposes, the magazine went into crisis, eventually ending its publications in 2018 after 41 years and 767 issues. \n\n\n== See also ==\nList of magazines in Italy\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Fuciliere (\"Fusilier\") was a Soldato-class (\"Soldier\"-class) destroyer of the Italian Regia Marina (Royal Navy). Commissioned in 1910, she served during World War I. Reclassified as a torpedo boat in 1921, she was stricken in 1932.\n\n\n== Design ==\nFuciliere was powered by two sets of triple expansion steam engines fed by three Thornycroft water-tube boilers, producing an estimated 6,000 indicated horsepower (4,474 kW) and driving two propeller shafts. As built, she could reach a maximum speed of 28.5 knots (52.8 km/h; 32.8 mph). She had a fuel capacity of 65 tonnes (64 long tons) of fuel oil, giving her a range of 1,600 nautical miles (3,000 km; 1,800 mi) at 12 knots (22 km/h; 14 mph). She was fitted with four 76-millimetre (3 in)/40 calibre guns and three 450-millimetre (17.7 in) torpedo tubes.\n\n\n== Construction and commissioning ==\nFuciliere was laid down on 28 October 1905 at the Gio. Ansaldo & C. shipyard in Genoa, Italy. She was launched on 21 August 1909 and completed on 26 January 1910. She was commissioned in 1910.\n\n\n== Service history ==\n\n\n=== World War I ===\nWorld War I broke out in 1914, and Italy entered the war on the side of the Allies with its declaration of war on Austria-Hungary on 23 May 1915. At the time, Fuciliere, under the command of Capitano di corvetta (Corvette Captain) Angelo Levi Bianchini, was part of the 4th Destroyer Squadron, based at Brindisi, which also included her sister ships Alpino, Ascaro, Carabiniere, and Pontiere and the destroyer Zeffiro. On 24 May 1915, the day after Italy's declaration of war, Fuciliere, Alpino, Carabiniere, and their sister ships Garibaldino and Lanciere conducted a patrol in the upper Adriatic Sea.\nOn the nights of 3–4 May and 4–5 May 1916, Fuciliere and Zeffiro laid a minefield in the Adriatic Sea off Šibenik (known to the Italians as Sebenico) on the coast of Austria-Hungary.\nSupported by Fuciliere — still under Bianchini's command — as well as Alpino and the coastal torpedo boats 40 PN and 46 OS, Zeffiro, under the command of Capitano di fregata (Frigate Captain) Costanzo Ciano and with Lieutenant Nazario Sauro, an Italian irredentist, aboard as pilot, entered the port of Poreč on the western side of Istria, a peninsula on Austria-Hungary's coast, at dawn on 12 May 1916. A group of men from Zeffiro, including Sauro, captured a gendarme who showed them the location of an aircraft hangar. In the meantime, Fuciliere and the other ships had joined Zeffiro, and at 04:50 they began a bombardment which lasted about 20 minutes. The hangar suffered damage from hits by 76-millimetre (3 in) shells from the Italian ships. Austro-Hungarian coastal artillery batteries returned fire,  and then 10 Austro-Hungarian seaplanes attacked the Italian ships. Allied aircraft came to the defense of the Italians, resulting in a dogfight in which Austro-Hungarian seaplanes collided with two Italian and one French aircraft. All the Italian ships returned to base, although they suffered damage and a number of casualties, including four men killed in action.\nOn 11 February 1917 Fuciliere, Alpino, Carabiniere, Pontiere, the torpedo boats 19 OS, 20 OS, 21 OS, and 22 OS, and six French airplanes provided escort and support to a group of two French and three Italian seaplanes as the seaplanes conducted a reconnaissance of the Austro-Hungarian Navy base at Pola.\nBy late October 1918, Austria-Hungary had effectively disintegrated, and the Armistice of Villa Giusti, signed on 3 November 1918, went into effect on 4 November 1918 and brought hostilities between Austria-Hungary and the Allies to an end. World War I ended a week later with an armistice between the Allies and the German Empire on 11 November 1918.\n\n\n=== Post-World War I ===\nFuciliere was reclassified as a torpedo boat on 1 July 1921. She was decommissioned in 1932 — the last Soldato-class ship to be decommissioned — and was stricken from the naval register on 15 December 1932. She subsequently was scrapped.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nFavre, Franco. La Marina nella Grande Guerra.

        "content": "Henriette Bruns (28 October 1813 – 7 November 1899) was a German-American writer known for her observations on political and social life in the 19th century.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life and education ===\nBruns was born Anna Elizabeth Henriette Bernadine Geisberg in Stromberg, Prussia (now Germany). She was the oldest child of Maximilian Friedrich Geisberg, the mayor and tax collector of Oelde, and Johanna Hüffer. She had a brother, Heinrich Geisberg.\nBruns, called \"Jette\" by her family, grew up in a prominent Catholic family in Westphalia. She enjoyed a rich intellectual and cultural upbringing, receiving an excellent early education and participating in the local musical community. After her mother's death in 1827, Bruns continued her studies in Münster, receiving training in household skills as well as formal instruction in subjects like history, geography, and music.\n\n\n=== Marriage and immigration to America ===\nIn 1832, at the age of 16, Bruns married Johann Bernard Bruns, a medical doctor. By marriage she became the aunt of Caspar Geisberg, nephew of her husband, who served in Company D of the 8th Missouri Infantry.\nIn 1835, her husband traveled to the United States to find land for their family, and in 1836 the Bruns family, along with several other German emigrants, sailed from Bremen and settled in Gasconade County, Missouri.\n\n\n=== Life on the frontier ===\nOver the next 15 years, Bruns letters to her relatives in Germany document the struggles and successes of the German immigrants in the \"Westphalia Settlement.\" She took on the duties of caring for her growing family, her household, and her garden, while also helping sick neighbors and entertaining travelers. Despite the hardships of frontier life, Bruns maintained a cheerful attitude.\n\nWriting in 1846, she reported:This past week we had the visit from our bishop that had been promised us for a long time. Since he, as well as the superior, stayed with us, you can understand that we had a great deal on our minds. The bishop confirmed and dedicated the new cemetery. He is a very fine and kind gentleman, Irish by birth, perhaps of high birth, and was called Lordship. Mrs. Bruns participated in the conversation in English, which amazed the gentlemen.\n\n\n=== Move to Jefferson City ===\nIn 1853, the Bruns family moved to Jefferson City, Missouri, where Bruns wrote about political events and family tragedies during the years leading up to and during the American Civil War. After her husband's death in 1864, Bruns opened a boarding house to support her family.\n\n\n=== Later life ===\nIn her later years, Bruns tried her hand at farming with her youngest son, but failing eyesight made many of her previous activities difficult. She continued to comment on national and local news in her letters until her death on November 7, 1899, at the age of 86.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nOver 270 letters, mostly written to relatives in Germany, as well as an unfinished autobiography, document Bruns' life as a German immigrant woman on the American frontier. Her writings provide a unique perspective on one of the exciting periods in American history.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nSchroeder, Adolf E. \"Bruns, Henriette (1813-1899), writer and political observer.\" American National Biography.

        "content": "A resource rent tax is a tax on the rents gained on the exploitation of a resource. It can cover both renewable and non-renewable resources. It is classically understood to be a tax on the surplus value generated by resource exploitation beyond the necessary costs of production (which includes rewards to capital). An investor enjoys relief from taxation until a certain rate of return has been achieved, at which point profits are shared with the host government.\nResource rent taxes are particularly prevalent in mining and petroleum industries. Australia's Minerals Resource Rent Tax covers rents in the mining industry. Norway introduced a resource rent tax on aquaculture (i.e., salmon and trout farming) in 2023, and resource rent tax on onshore wind energy effective January 1, 2024. In Iceland, a resource rent tax has been placed on fishing industry profits. In Switzerland, there is a resource rent tax on hydropower.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGeorgism\nLand value tax\nMineral tax\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "EVM Hatao Sena is an apolitical and Nonprofit organization in India, advocating for the discontinuation of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) in the country's electoral process. Founded in 2023, the organization has been at the forefront of raising concerns regarding the security, reliability, and transparency of EVMs.\n\n\n== Background ==\nEVMs were introduced in India in the late 1990s as a technological upgrade to the traditional paper ballot system. They were intended to streamline the voting process and minimize electoral fraud. However, doubts and controversies surrounding the use of EVMs have persisted, leading to the emergence of organizations like EVM Hatao Sena.\n\n\n== Formation ==\nEVM Hatao Sena was formed in response to growing apprehensions about the integrity of EVMs among various political parties, civil society groups, and activists. It was founded by Pawan Kumar Sharma along with his companions, who spearheaded the organization's efforts to raise awareness and advocate for electoral reforms.\n\n\n== Objectives ==\nThe primary objective of EVM Hatao Sena is to advocate for the discontinuation of EVMs from the electoral process in India. The organization argues that EVMs are susceptible to manipulation, which could undermine the democratic principles of free and fair elections. EVM Hatao Sena demands the reinstatement of paper ballots as a more transparent and secure method of voting.\n\n\n== Activities and Campaigns ==\nEVM Hatao Sena has undertaken various activities and campaigns to achieve its objectives, including:\n\n\n=== Demonstration of working model of EVM-VVPAT in public ===\nOrganizing public meetings throughout the whole country to demonstrate alleged loopholes of EVM-VVPAT. The EVM Hatao Sena held its first public meeting at Press Club, Jaipur in which Pawan Kumar Sharma gave a demonstration of a working model of EVM-VVPAT created by IIT Delhi graduate Rahul Chimanbhai Mehta.\n\n\n=== Press conferences ===\nOrganizing press conference throughout various cities in every state in India to demonstrate alleged loopholes of EVM-VVPAT. EVM Hatao Sena held press conferences in following cities including New Delhi, Mumbai, Lucknow, Bangalore. In these conferences Pawan Kumar gave demonstration of working model of EVM-VVPAT to press reporters.\n\n\n=== Social Media Outreach ===\nLeveraging social media platforms to disseminate information, mobilize supporters, and highlight instances of alleged EVM inside tampering during elections.\nOn 6 January 2024, Pawan Kumar gave a public demo of working model of EVM-VVPAT at jantar mantar, whose video was shared by many YouTube channel including National Dastak, Ajit anjum, Punya Praun Bajpai. Indian National Congress official YouTube channel has also covered the press conference at Press club of India held by EVM Hatao Sena.\n\n\n== Controversies and Criticisms ==\nWhile EVM Hatao Sena has garnered support from sections of the public and political spectrum, it has also faced criticism and skepticism. Critics argue that the organization's concerns about EVMs are often based on anecdotal evidence and lack empirical verification. Some critics accuse EVM Hatao Sena of promoting conspiracy theories and attempting to delegitimize electoral outcomes. Election Commission Gujarat tweeted about EVM Hatao Sena demonstration at Mumbai press club and called it as fake. Also Election Commission of India tweeted about EVM Hatao Sena demonstration at Press Club of India and said that the EVM used in that demonstration was not original EVM that is used by ECI in election.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nDespite facing challenges and criticisms, EVM Hatao Sena has contributed to a broader discourse on electoral reforms and the need for greater transparency and accountability in the electoral process. The organization's advocacy efforts have kept the issue of EVM security and reliability in the public spotlight, prompting discussions and debates among policymakers, electoral authorities, and civil society stakeholders.\n\n\n== See also ==\nElectronic Voting in India\nElectoral Reform in India\nVVPAT\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Radical Optimism is the upcoming third studio album by English-Albanian singer Dua Lipa. It is scheduled to be released on 3 May 2024 through Warner Records, and marks her first studio album release in four years since Future Nostalgia (2020).\n\n\n== Background ==\nDua Lipa's second studio album, Future Nostalgia, was released in March 2020 to widespread acclaim. Credited as a significant factor in the revival of disco and dance-pop music in this decade,  the record yielded multiple singles including \"Don't Start Now\" and the diamond-certified \"Levitating\". It won Best Pop Vocal Album and British Album of the Year at the 2021 Grammy Awards and Brit Awards ceremonies, respectively. Future Nostalgia was succeeded by a remix album and reissue. Lipa embarked on its namesake tour, which included 91 shows across the Americas, Europe, and Oceania, from February to November 2022.\nIn 2023, Lipa revealed her third studio album would be released sometime in 2024 with a new sound that sees her moving away from the disco soundscape of Future Nostalgia; instead embracing more of 1970s-era psychedelia. After having deleted all of her Instagram posts in October 2023, she revealed she had gotten her hair coloured red via a picture of herself captioned \"miss me?\". In anticipation of new music, Lipa posted pictures to her social media with cryptic captions and temporarily replaced the cover art of her previous albums with kaleidoscopic versions on streaming services. In the cover story for the February 2024 issue of Rolling Stone, Lipa described her forthcoming album as a \"psychedelic-pop-infused tribute to UK rave culture\".\nLipa announced her third studio album, titled Radical Optimism, and its release date, via an Instagram livestream on 13 March 2024. The album is her first studio effort in four years, following Future Nostalgia.\n\n\n== Conception ==\nRadical Optimism is a record that \"taps into the pure joy and happiness\" of having clarity in situations, including \"hard goodbyes and vulnerable beginnings\" that eventually turned out to be milestones as a result of choosing optimism and grace to navigate \"through the chaos\". The album is inspired by \"the energy of [Lipa's hometown] London, and the rawness, honesty, confidence and freedom of 90s Britpop\". In a press release, she expressed her desire to \"capture the essence of youth and freedom and having fun\" with the record. The concept of the term \"radical optimism\", originally coined by the anthropology collective Allegra Lab, was introduced to her by a friend a few years prior, which resonated with her and allowed it to \"weave\" into her life. Inspired by the term, Lipa found herself doing research on the history of \"psychedelia, trip hop, and Britpop\". The concept turned out to be a \"confidently optimistic\" feeling to the singer that she sought to incorporate in her recording sessions.\n\n\n== Release and promotion ==\nRadical Optimism will be released through Warner Records on 3 May 2024. It will be available for streaming, digital download, cassette, CD, two box set variants, and two vinyl LP variants. Pre-orders for the album began on 13 March 2024.\n\n\n=== Marketing ===\nLipa unveiled the album's cover, title and tracklist on 13 March 2024.\n\n\n=== Title and artwork ===\nAccording to Lipa, the title Radical Optimism was inspired by \"the idea of going through chaos gracefully and feeling like you can weather any storm\". The artwork of the album was unveiled along with its announcement. Shot by Tyrone Lebon, it depicts the singer floating in an ocean and the silhouette of a nearby shark seemingly approaching her.\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nThe lead single \"Houdini\" was released on 9 November 2023, with its accompanying music video. The song topped the charts in Belgium, Bulgaria, and Greece; reached number two in the UK, the top-ten in various countries, and number 11 in the US. It also topped the Billboard Dance/Electronic Songs chart for twelve weeks, becoming her second-longest-running number-one on the chart.\nThe second single \"Training Season\" was released on 15 February 2024. It was issued for limited 7-inch vinyl, CD, and cassette formats. \"Illusion\" was released as the album's third single on 11 April 2024.\n\n\n=== Live performances ===\nLipa opened the 66th Annual Grammy Awards on 4 February 2024 with \"Houdini\" and debuted then-unreleased \"Training Season\", along with \"Dance the Night\", a song for the 2023 film Barbie. She performed the latter track again at the Brit Awards 2024 ceremony on 2 March. Lipa will headline the 2024 edition of Glastonbury Festival in June as well as Open'er Festival, Rock Werchter, NOS Alive, and Mad Cool in July. \nShe will also conduct a one-off concert on 17 October at the Royal Albert Hall in London. Fans who pre-ordered Radical Optimism were granted pre-sale access on 10 April, followed by the general ticket sale on 12 April via Ticketmaster.\n\n\n=== Tour ===\nOn 18 March 2024, Lipa announced the Radical Optimism On Road tour, a European concert tour in support of the album. Tickets went on general sale on 21 March via Ticketmaster; fans who pre-ordered Radical Optimism were granted pre-sale access.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nMusicians\n\nDua Lipa – vocals\nCaroline Ailin – backing vocals (tracks 2–3)\nDanny L Harle – backing vocals (track 2), drum programming (tracks 2, 7), synthesiser (tracks 2, 7), programming (track 3), keyboards (track 7), percussion (track 7), whistle (track 7)\nKevin Parker – backing vocals (tracks 2–3), bass guitar (tracks 2–3, 7), drums (tracks 2–3), guitar (tracks 2–3, 7), keyboards (tracks 2–3, 7), percussion (tracks 2–3, 7), programming (tracks 2–3), sound effects (tracks 2–3, 7)\nTobias Jesso Jr. – backing vocals (tracks 2–3)\nTechnical\n\nDanny L Harle – arranger (track 2)\nKevin Parker – engineer (tracks 2–3)\nCameron Gower Poole – engineer (tracks 2–3, 7)\nPatrick Gardner – assistant engineer (track 2)\nDaniela Sicilia – assistant engineer (tracks 2–3, 7)\nJan Brzezinski – assistant engineer (tracks 2–3, 7)\nJosh Kay – assistant engineer (tracks 2–3, 7)\nJosh Gudwin – mixer (tracks 2–3, 7)\nChris Gehringer – masterer (tracks 2–3, 7)\nWill Quinnell – assistant mastering engineer (tracks 3, 7)\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "Sutton Lifeboat Station is a former Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) station, which was located at the village of Sutton-on-Sea, in the county of Lincolnshire. A lifeboat was first stationed here by the Lincolnshire Coast Shipwreck Association (LCSA) in 1844, although it was preceded by a station at Huttoft from 1835. It was handed over to the RNLI in 1864.\nWith only a small number of launches and few lives saved over a 25-year period, the station was closed in 1913.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn July 1835, the Lincolnshire Coast Shipwreck Association (LCSA) decided to place a lifeboat at Huttoft. A 24-foot boat had been ordered from Bell & Grange, of Grimsby, costing £109-12s-6d. The boat was named Birmingham as some funds were raised in the city. John Shaw was appointed Coxswain. The boat was only launched once, in 1843, and saved 3 lives. Finding crew for the boat was proving difficult at the remote location, and so in 1844, the boat was moved to a new station at Sutton-on-Sea.\nShe would go on to launch 7 more times over the next twenty years, rescuing 28.\nLCSA transferred their lifeboats and stations to the RNLI in 1864. A new boat was ordered from Forrestt of Limehouse, London, a 30-foot Self-righting boat using oars and sail (a \"pulling and sailing\" lifeboat), costing £190, and a new boathouse constructed, costing a further £205. With all costs again met by funds raised in Birmingham, she was taken there for a naming ceremony on 29 November 1864, and named Birmingham No.1. She would launch 9 times, and save 13 lives, before she was replaced in 1876 with the Caroline, a boat that would serve Sutton on Sea for a further 12 years, and rescue 10.\nTwo matching 31-foot self-righting lifeboats were funded at the bequest of Miss Caroline Berrey, constructed by Hansen in 1888. One was provided to Chapel Lifeboat Station, named John Alexander Berrey (ON 217), with the second boat sent to Sutton, and named Elizabeth Berrey (ON 218).\nIn 1897, the last boat to serve at Sutton was the Sir John (ON 408). A 35-foot self-righting lifeboat constructed by Thames Ironworks. Sir John would be launched 5 times in 16 years, but with no lives saved.\nWith a record of 8 launches and 5 lives saved over a period of 25 years, Sutton lifeboat station was closed in 1913. Sir John (ON 408) was transferred to Cemlyn and served a further 5 years, before joining the relief fleet. The station building in Sutton-on-Sea still stands, and is currently the Meridale Centre.\n\n\n== Sutton lifeboats ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of RNLI stations\nList of former RNLI stations\nRoyal National Lifeboat Institution lifeboats\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

He was killed in action during the seizure of weapons at the Pretis weapons factory in Vogošća. He was posthumously awarded the rank of brigadier general. He also received war awards, the Order of the Golden Lily in 1992 and the highest military decoration, the Order of the Hero of the Liberation War in 1994. He was one of the founders of the Party of Democratic Action of Sarajevo, the first president of the SDA of Novi Grad, and one of the founders of the SDA Rudo.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nSafet Hadžić was born in Strgačina near Rudo. Hadžić was 20 years old when his father died. Due to the poor economic situation in his hometown, he moved to Sarajevo in the 1970s, where he got a job at the Sarajevo Waterworks. He lived in Švrakino Selo. He had three children with his wife Džemila: Nezira, Almira, and Amila. Hadžić opposed the one-party system of SFR Yugoslavia because of the legal provisions on religion.\nIn the 1983 Sarajevo Process, where Muslim intellectuals were arrested and detained for publishing the Islamic Declaration, among whom was the future first president of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Alija Izetbegović, Safet Hadžić organized the collection of funds to support the families of those arrested.\nAfter the outbreak of war in Slovenia and Croatia, Hadžić was one of the founders of the Patriotic League, which was later merged into the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. He gathered officers leaving the Yugoslav People's Army and included them in the Patriotic League. He had an operational headquarters from where he issued orders. For the last time, on April 18, 1992, he gave the order to move in the direction of Pretis in Vogošća and to prevent the confiscation of weapons by the Yugoslav People's Army. He died from an ambush attack.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe street passing through Švrakino Selo, the neighborhood where Safet Hadžić lived, was named \"Safet Hadžić Street\". In the song of the Hor Hazreti Hamza, \"Za nju vrijedi umrijeti\" (\"She is worth dying for\"), Safet Hadžić's most famous quote was inserted.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "Aclimação Park (Portuguese: Parque da Aclimação) is a public leisure area located in the Aclimação district, in the central area of the Brazilian city of São Paulo. It opened on September 16, 1939, and covers an area of 112,000 square meters. It dates back to 1892, when Carlos Botelho decided to establish a garden on the site inspired by the Jardin d'Acclimatation in Paris. It was acquired by São Paulo City Hall in the 1930s.\nThe park was listed as a protected area in 1986 by the Council for the Defense of Historical, Archaeological, Artistic and Tourist Heritage (Condephaat). It includes a lake with around 70,000 cubic meters of water, a Japanese garden with a water mirror, an acoustic shell, playgrounds, gym equipment, a jogging track and a walking track. The fauna counts around 111 species, including birds such as the southern lapwing, the shiny cowbird, the red ovenbird and the rufous-bellied thrush. The local vegetation has landscaped areas with native and exotic species, such as guanandi, jacaranda, an extensive eucalyptus grove and fruit trees.\n\n\n== History ==\nAfter years in Paris visiting the Jardin d'Acclimatation, Carlos Botelho returned to Brazil in 1880 with the desire to build a similar area in the city of São Paulo. In 1892, he founded the Aclimação Garden at Sítio do Tapanhoin, where he built a dairy farm, the first zoo in São Paulo, a cancer research center, the first silo in Latin America and the first riding club in Brazil. Access to the garden was provided by two monumental cast iron gates: the main one faced Aclimação Avenue and the other Muniz de Souza Street. Around 1930, the Botelho family began to subdivide the area, mainly the land of the private property attached to the park, which allowed for the creation of streets and boulevards.\nIn 1939, Francisco Prestes Maia, the mayor of São Paulo, displeased with the subdivision of the site, approached the family to present a proposal for purchase by the São Paulo City Hall, which was accepted. In the 1950s, the area received a library, an acoustic shell, a playground and a soccer field. In the 1980s, the neighborhood residents' association, park's defenders and ecological organizations mobilized and achieved the protection of the park by the Council for the Defense of Historical, Archaeological, Artistic and Tourist Heritage (Condephaat).\nIn 2007, the park's lake burst due to the intensity of the rainfall in the city. Thousands of tilapia and carp flowed into the Pedra Azul and Jurubatuba streams, which are heavily polluted. 300 fish and 48 birds were rescued and taken to Ibirapuera Park. It took seven days to fill the lake after the sludge had been removed to reduce the stench left by the dead fish. In 2009, the lake broke and emptied again due to the rains. In 2010, it underwent repairs to install a spillway to prevent further rains from causing it to collapse again.\n\n\n== Infrastructure, fauna and flora ==\n\nAclimação Park covers an area of 118,787 square meters, including 65,856 square meters of vegetation, 120 square meters of permeable surfaces, 18,110 square meters of impermeable surfaces, 33,380 square meters of lake and 1,321 square meters of buildings. There are 6 entrances for the public. Inside, the site has an acoustic shell, rest areas, drinking fountains, a bike rack with 15 spaces, 6 barbecue pits, 40 garbage cans, 49 benches, 3 kiosks, 3 toilets and bird feeders. Highlights include several areas for children to play and a \"longevity playground\" with equipment for the elderly to exercise.\n\nThe park includes a bocce court with 403 square meters, a soccer pitch with bleachers, a 172 square meters mesh court, 7 tables for games, a 1,500 meter jogging track, 3 sand ponds, a 136-meter trail, a pet nursery and a seedling nursery. It also has a library operated by the Municipal Department of Culture, which offers a collection of 31,000 copies of textbooks, dictionaries, encyclopedias, newspapers, magazines and maps.Among the vegetation, the highlight is the extensive eucalyptus grove that occupies a large part of the park's area. There are also exotic species, such as weeping willow, fig and rubber tree, and native species, such as diesel tree and jequitibá-rosa. The park is predominantly home to waterfowl, such as the night-heron, the neotropic cormorant and the ringed kingfisher. Migratory birds can also be spotted, such as the Brazilian teal and the white-faced whistling duck. The lake is home to fish such as tilapia, koi and mirror carp.\n\n\n=== Jack Marin Municipal Stadium ===\nAclimação Park features the Jack Marin Municipal Stadium, which is run by the Municipal Department of Sports and Leisure. It was founded in 1927 and became the first municipal soccer school in Brazil and Latin America. It has a soccer pitch measuring 60 meters wide by 90 meters long, two multi-sports courts, changing rooms, a medical and administrative department, a multidisciplinary care room and a cafeteria. Currently, it hosts an indoor soccer school for children and young people, and caters for grassroots clubs in the evenings and at weekends. The place was named after Jack Marin by Municipal Decree No. 18,721 on March 11, 1983.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nTourism in the city of São Paulo\nIbirapuera Park\nAclimação\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Parque da Aclimação at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "Butt Drugs was a drugstore in Corydon, Indiana, United States. Founded in 1952 by William H. Butt, the store operated until 2023. Butt Drugs was known for its unusual name, soda fountain, and service. The store gained further attention in 2010 when it was the subject of a commercial by YouTube personalities Rhett & Link. After years of declining sales, the store was shuttered in 2023.\n\n\n== History ==\nWilliam H. Butt founded the drugstore, originally known as William H. Butt Drugs and later as Butt Rexall, in 1952. It was located at 115 East Chestnut Street in downtown Corydon, Indiana. By 1998, the pharmacy was franchised as Valu-Rite and had just completed a renovation. William Butt sold the store to his granddaughter Katie Butt Beckort in 2001; she had been an employee of the store for several years prior.\nThe drugstore was noted as a local attraction in Corydon, due in part to its unique name. It also retained an operational soda fountain and offered 35-cent cups of coffee for patrons. Additionally, the store offered curb-side service to deliver prescriptions to customers' vehicles. A 2019 article published by WCPO stated that the store was known for its \"priority on family friendly service\" and was considered an integral part of the community. Its owners sold merchandise playing on the company name, such as T-shirts reading \"I love Butt Drugs\" and fanny packs, both of which were also sold online. The owners made further puns on the name by naming their liquor department Butt Liquors and advertising free parking in the rear.\nIn 2010, YouTube personalities Rhett & Link gave the store further attention when, as part of a project to film commercials for small local businesses, they recorded one for Butt Drugs. The commercial features the two singing a jingle about the store over footage of employees and customers. The two were recommended the business by a fan, and thought the recommendation was a joke until they visited Corydon and considered the business suitable for a commercial. Employees of Butt Drugs noted that sales of T-shirts for the store increased greatly after Rhett & Link's commercial became a viral video. The commercial was also shared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and by Howard Stern.\nDespite the popularity from this commercial, the store continued to decline in profitability for many years, ultimately closing in May 2023. Customers' prescriptions were transferred to the town's CVS/pharmacy. After the store's closing, the soda fountain was reinstalled at 1819 General Store in nearby Elizabeth, Indiana.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRhett & Link's commercial for Butt Drugs on YouTube",

Eriotes was an outfielder for the 1947 Griffin Pimientos and the 1948 Miami Owls. But he is most remembered for being the 3rd oldest professional baseball player when he took the field for the Sioux Fall Canaries at the age of 83. In his one at bat he swung and missed on the first 2 pitches and then fouled one off. But the next pitch he swung on and missed for a strikeout. He had apparently been taking around 1,000 swings a day to prepare. The only two older professional players are Buck O'Neil (94) and Ted Radcliffe (96). Eriotes passed away in 2012 at the age of 88.                                              \n\n\n== References ==",

The film is a sequel to The Big Trip. It was released in the UK as Little Bear's Big Trip.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn the United Forests of America, elections for president start. There are two candidates, John Grizzly and Don Vulture. But the first has no child yet and will be disqualified if no child is presented by Election Day.\nHowever he promises that a baby bear is on his way. Vultures and hyenas team up to hinder the delivery of the baby by a stork. \nMic-Mic and Oscar are joined by Giant Panda to help a stork deliver the baby despite the plot. They fly to America in their balloon.  Doug, a young vulture has been following them and makes a hole in their balloon forcing them land in emergency in a polar zone of snowy icebergs and mountains, from which they gradually reach America. On their way they meet a female bear, Michaela, who helps them deliver the baby on time.\n\n\n== Original voice cast ==\nDmitry Nazarov as Mic-Mic, an Asiatic black bear\nMaxim Galkin as Oscar, his hare friend\nVasily Rovensky Jr. as baby panda\n\n\n== Release ==\nLionsgate has acquired US distribution rights.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nCommon Sense Media gave the film 2 stars and found it was a \"unoriginal animated sequel\" while RaisingChildren.net stated, \"This movie is action packed and likely to appeal to many children. But you might find the voices annoying. Also the movie’s violence and scary scenes means it’s best suited to children aged 8 years and older.\" A review at Dove concluded that \"Parents will like the strong bonds of friendship and values such as honor, integrity and taking responsibility of one’s actions, as well as shedding a positive light on adoption and caring for life.\" A very negative review in The Guardian went as far as to write that the film was a \"dismal animation only good for punishing kids with.\" The Herald (Zimbabwe) noted \"the political agenda\" of the film and found it irrelevant.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBig Trip 2: Special Delivery at IMDb",

        "content": "Thomas Dixon (1831-1880) was a working class autodidact and literary correspondent of Sunderland in the north-east of England. A cork-cutter by trade, he lodged with a close friend of the head of the School of Art in Newcastle, William Bell Scott, and through this became acquainted with many of the artists later known as the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and others in their circle, including Tennyson, Thomas Carlyle and Dante Gabriel Rosetti.\nHis correspondence with the Pre-Raphaelites, some of whom appear to have found him a nuisance, was important in bringing the Pitman Poet Joseph Skipsey to wider notice. He enjoyed a lengthy correspondence with John Ruskin between February and December 1867. The 25 letters, collected by Ruskin as Time and Tyde by Weare and Tyne touched on themes of honesty in work, fairness and cooperation, in keeping with his essays engaging with John Stuart Mills, Adam Smith and Malthus.\nHe was widely read and a member of the Sunderland Literary and Philosophical Society. Though the recipient of many books as gifts from his correspondents, Dixon had few of them in his house, remarking that he saw no need for books as ornaments and that after reading and absorbing a book's contents, he would donate it to the local library.\nHe sat for many of the artists he corresponded with and a portrait of him by Alfred Dixon (no relation) is in the collection of Sunderland Museum and Winter Gardens.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\"E2 Joseph Skipsey: Poet and Pitman\".

        "content": "Abraham Kløcker (28 September 1673 - 2 February 1730) was a Danish merchant. He served as director of the Danish West Indies Company.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nKløcker was born on 28 September 1873 in Aalborg, the son of Jens Pallesen (død senest 1682) og Helvig Kløcker (1641–1718). He became a merchant in his home town. In 1707, he was granted citizenship as a merchant in Copenhagen. He was soon counted among the city's most industrious traders.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1726, he and two other prominent merchants succeeded in obtaining the capital's privilege of being the only place where wine, brandy, salt and tobacco could be stored. The motivation for this step was that it would make smuggling more difficult, but it was also to the greatest detriment of the independent trade in the provincial market towns, and it provoked countless complaints. In 1730 the privilege was therefore revoked again.\nKløcker was director of the Danish West Indian-Guinean Company. In 1720 he was a committee member in the Politi- og Kommercekollegiet for a few months. In 1720–30m he was a deputy in the Missionskollegiet. He combined this last position with his position as curator of the vajsenhuset. He had close ties to  Frederik Rostgaard.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nKløcker was married twice. His first wife was Elisabeth von Lengerken., daughter of merchantd Herman von Lengerken (died 1702) and Elisabeth Holst (c. 1665–1718). She died in 1718 in Copenhagen (funeral on 4 March in St. Peter's Church). On 26 August 1719, he was married to Johanne Heerfordt (1681–1756). She had previously been married to councilman Elovius Mangor (1662–1714). She was the daughter of pharmacist Christopher Herfordt (1642–91) amd Cecilie Iversdatter (1657–1721). He was the father of Herman Lengerken Kløcker (1706–65) who became vice mayor of Copenhagen and owned the estate Gjeddesdal. as well as the country house Kløckers Gård in Gentofte.\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nLengnick, J.

        "content": "Alpino was a Soldato-class (\"Soldier\"-class) destroyer of the Italian Regia Marina (Royal Navy). Commissioned in 1910, she served actively in the Italo-Turkish War, operating in the Ionian, Aegean, and Red Seas. During World War I she initially operated in the upper Adriatic Sea, conducting reconnaissance and  minelaying operations and supporting actions by motor torpedo boats and aircraft. She subsequently operated in the southern Adriatic and the Ionian Sea, where she was assigned to escort operations and patrolling the Otranto Barrage in the Strait of Otranto. Reclassified as a torpedo boat in 1921, she was stricken in 1928.\n\n\n== Design ==\nAlpino was powered by two sets of triple expansion steam engines fed by three Thornycroft water-tube boilers, producing an estimated 6,000 indicated horsepower (4,474 kW) and driving two propeller shafts. As built, she could reach a maximum speed of 28.5 knots (52.8 km/h; 32.8 mph). She had a fuel capacity of 65 tonnes (64 long tons) of fuel oil, giving her a range of 1,600 nautical miles (3,000 km; 1,800 mi) at 12 knots (22 km/h; 14 mph). She was fitted with four 76-millimetre (3 in)/40 calibre guns and three 450-millimetre (17.7 in) torpedo tubes.\n\n\n== Construction and commissioning ==\nAlpino was laid down on 4 December 1905 at the Gio. Ansaldo & C. shipyard in Genoa, Italy. She was launched on 27 November 1909 and completed on 1 April 1910. She was commissioned in April 1910.\n\n\n== Service history ==\n\n\n=== Italo-Turkish War ===\nThe Italo-Turkish War began on 29 September 1911 with the Kingdom of Italy′s declaration of war on the Ottoman Empire. At the time, Alpino was part of the 2nd Squadron's 3rd Division. On the afternoon of 29 September Alpino took part in one of the first clashes of the war, the Battle of Preveza, when she, along with the destroyers Artigliere, Carabiniere, and Zeffiro and the torpedo boat Spiga, engaged the Ottoman Navy torpedo boats Antalya and Tokad as they attempted to leave the port of Preveza on what then was the Ionian Sea coast of the Ottoman Empire. According to some accounts, the Italian ships attacked the two torpedo boats at 14:00, and Artigliere seriously damaged Tokad and pursued her into the anchorage as she attempted to return to Preveza. Meanwhile, Alpino, Carabiniere, Spiga, and Zeffiro surrounded Antalya. Hit repeatedly, seriously damaged, and on fire, with four members of her crew killed in action and numerous other crewmen wounded, Antalya struck her colors and ran herself aground on a nearby beach. As Antalya′s crew abandoned ship, members of Alpino′s crew boarded and captured her and removed her flag and her only usable gun, after which Alpino finished her off with gunfire. Carabiniere, Alpino, Spiga, and Zeffiro then joined Artigliere in the harbor and sank Tokad and an Ottoman gunboat. As the Italian ships departed, the crew of the Greek steamer Marte cheered them. \nIn a 1912 magazine article and a 1913 book based on contemporary sources, United States Navy Commodore W. H. Beehler offers a different version of the events of 29 September 1911. According to Beehler, the Italian ships sighted Antalya and Tokad in the Ionian Sea between Corfu and Preveza, steering north-northwestward, at either 15:00 or 16:00. The Italians opened fire, and the Ottoman ships returned fire only feebly. Tokad steamed northward chased by three Italian destroyers, while Antalya headed south with two Italian destroyers in pursuit. Hit 15 times and on fire, Tokad beached herself near Nicopolis and was totally destroyed, with her commanding officer and eight of her sailors either killed by the Italian gunfire or drowned. Meanwhile, Antalya reached Preveza undamaged. The Italian destroyers were undamaged and fired 100 76-millimetre rounds during the engagement.\nThe battle continued on the morning of 30 September 1911 when, according to some sources, Alpino was operating off Igoumenitsa with other Italian ships when they sighted a force of Ottoman torpedo boats leaving Preveza. When they reported the sighting to higher command, they received orders to let the torpedo boats move away from the coast and then, taking advantage of the greater speed of the Italian ships, close with them and sink them. The Italian ships managed to surround the torpedo boats, which at that point attempted to escape at full steam towards the south instead of heading back toward Preveza. The Italians found this suspicious, and while Artigliere and the destroyer Corazziere pursued the torpedo boats, Alpino steamed north to conduct a reconnaissance of the approaches to Preveza. Alpino soon discovered that the Ottoman torpedo boats were heading south to draw the Italians away from ships which appeared to be trying to reach Preveza unscathed. After sighting suspicious ships heading toward Preveza, Alpino reported the sighting and received orders to stop a steamer flying the Greek flag that was proceeding at her maximum speed toward Preveza. As Alpino approached the ship, she hauled down the Greek flag. After Alpino threatened to torpedo the ship if she did not stop, she came to a halt. She turned out to be the steamer Newa (or Neua) with a Greek captain and crew but carrying Ottoman troops (five officers and 162 soldiers) and a load of ammunition and grain. Meanwhile, Artigliere and Corazziere sank the torpedo boats Alpagot and Hamidiye without the Ottoman vessels being able to return fire, and the rest of the Ottoman torpedo boat force returned safely to Prevenza. Beehler again provides a different narrative, stating that Artigliere and Corazziere penetrated the harbor at Preveza and sank Alpagot and Hamidiye while the two torpedo boats were at anchor, without mentioning Alpino or her activities. According to Beehler, Corazziere then seized the armed yacht \"Telied\" and  tow her away as a prize as the two destroyers put back to sea.\nThe historian Charles Stephenson offers yet another version of events. According to him, the Italians decided not to attempt an incursion into the harbor at Preveza to attack Antalya after she reached that port on 29 September and instead proceeded to the waters off Igoumenitsa, where Alpagot and Hamidiye were anchored in the harbor. Alpino, Artigliere, and Corazziere penetrated the harbor at Igoumenitsa on the morning of 30 September, where Artigliere and Corazziere sank Alpagot and Hamidiye with gunfire while they still were at anchor. Meanwhile, Alpino came alongside the armed yacht \"Trablus,\" whose boilers were under repair. The yacht's crew opened her seacocks in an attempt to scuttle her and abandoned ship. Alpino sent a boarding party aboard the yacht and closed the seacocks to prevent her from sinking. The Alpino crewmen were cutting the yacht's mooring lines when civilians on shore opened fire on the boarding party, prompting Corazziere to bombard the town, silencing the civilian gunfire and damaging the fort at Igoumenitsa, which did not fire during the battle. Alpino then towed the yacht out of port.\nOn 4 May 1912 Alpino, under the command of Gustavo Nicastro, went to Rhodes, which Italian troops had occupied, to demand the surrender of the local wali (Ottoman governor), but he stalled the Italians and then escaped. The Italian destroyer Ostro captured him later. On 12 May, as Italian forces occupied the Dodecanese, Alpino and the battleship Regina Elena landed troops on Karpathos (known as to the Italians as Scarpanto), taking possession of the island. Alpino subsequently deployed to the Red Sea to reinforce the Italian squadron there. The war ended on 18 October 1912 in an Italian victory.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\nWorld War I broke out in 1914, and Italy entered the war on the side of the Allies with its declaration of war on Austria-Hungary on 23 May 1915. At the time, Alpino, under the command of Capitano di corvetta (Corvette Captain) Ruta, was part of the 4th Destroyer Squadron, based at Brindisi, which also included Carabiniere, Zeffiro, and the destroyers Ascaro, Fuciliere, and Pontiere. On 24 May 1915, the day after Italy's declaration of war, Alpino, Carabiniere, Fuciliere, and their sister ships Garibaldino and Lanciere conducted a patrol in the upper Adriatic Sea.\nOn 29 May 1915 Alpino, Corazziere, and Pontiere provided support to a formation of destroyers composed of Artigliere, Bersagliere, Garibaldino, and Lanciere as it bombarded the Adria Werke chemical plant in Monfalcone, a production site for poison gases. The ships carried out another bombardment of the Adria Werke on 7 June 1915.\nSupported by Alpino, Fuciliere, and the coastal torpedo boats 40 PN and 46 OS, Zeffiro, under the command of Capitano di fregata (Frigate Captain) Costanzo Ciano and with Lieutenant Nazario Sauro, an Italian irredentist, aboard as pilot, entered the port of Poreč on the western side of Istria, a peninsula on Austria-Hungary's coast, at dawn on 12 May 1916. A group of men from Zeffiro, including Sauro, captured a gendarme who showed them the location of an aircraft hangar. In the meantime, Alpino and the other ships had joined Zeffiro, and at 04:50 they began a bombardment which lasted about 20 minutes. The hangar suffered damage from hits by 76-millimetre (3 in) shells from the Italian ships. Austro-Hungarian coastal artillery batteries returned fire,  and then 10 Austro-Hungarian seaplanes attacked the Italian ships. Allied aircraft came to the defense of the Italians, resulting in a dogfight in which Austro-Hungarian seaplanes collided with two Italian and one French aircraft. All the Italian ships returned to base, although they suffered damage and a number of casualties, including four men killed in action. Alpino herself suffered one man killed and one seriously wounded.\nOn 11 February 1917 Alpino, Carabiniere, Fuciliere, Pontiere, the torpedo boats 19 OS, 20 OS, 21 OS, and 22 OS, and six French airplanes provided escort and support to a group of two French and three Italian seaplanes as the seaplanes conducted a reconnaissance of the Austro-Hungarian Navy base at Pola.\nBy late October 1918, Austria-Hungary had effectively disintegrated, and the Armistice of Villa Giusti, signed on 3 November 1918, went into effect on 4 November 1918 and brought hostilities between Austria-Hungary and the Allies to an end. World War I ended a week later with an armistice between the Allies and the German Empire on 11 November 1918.\n\n\n=== Post-World War I ===\nAlpino was reclassified as a torpedo boat on 1 July 1921. She was stricken from the naval register on 1 June 1928, and subsequently scrapped.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBeehler, W. H. (1913).

        "content": "Mary Leggett Cooke (1852–1938) was an American Unitarian minister. She was a member of the Iowa Sisterhood, a group of women ministers who organized eighteen Unitarian societies in several Midwestern states in the late 19th century and early 20th century.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nMary Lydia Leggett was born in Cayuga County, New York, April 23, 1852. She was the daughter of Rev. William Leggett and Frelove Frost Leggett. From earliest childhood, she was a worshipper of the religion of nature.\nShe was educated in Monticello Seminary, Godfrey, Illinois, and was the first woman graduate from Harvard Divinity School. She also completed special study and travel in Egypt, Greece, and Italy.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1887, Cooke was formally ordained to the Unitarian ministry in Kansas City, Missouri, Rev. Charles Gordon Ames, of Philadelphia, preaching her ordination sermon. \nShe built and dedicated a church in Beatrice, Nebraska, of which she was minister until 1891, when she went to Boston, Massachusetts, and became minister of a seaboard parish 36 miles (58 km) from that city. Her church in Green Harbor, Massachusetts was founded by the granddaughter of the statesman, Daniel Webster, whose summer home was in that hamlet. Leggett's study contained the office-table on which Webster penned his speeches. In that state, she also served at Dighton. Thereafter, she was at Fort Collins, Colorado, Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, and Revere, Massachusetts.\nCooke was also affiliated with the social settlements movement and women's suffrage.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nOn April 23, 1923, she married Rev. George Willis Cooke, who died a week after their wedding, at her home in Revere, Massachusetts.\nMary Leggett Cooke died in Brookline, Massachusetts, August 17, 1938.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Works related to Woman of the Century/Mary Lydia Leggett at Wikisource",

The town of Rajhrad grew around the monastery. It was founded by Moravian and later of Bohemian Duke Bretislav I before half of 11. cenbtury (1045). The first Benedictine male monastery and first historically mentioned monastery in Moravia. \nThe Moravian Literature Memorial (Museum) with a rich and valuable library is located in the monastery buildings.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe monastery was founded in 1045 by moravian and later bohemian Duke Bretislav I.. Originally was established filial monastery of Břevnov Abbey in Prague, in fact as a chapter type of comunity.\nThe monastery was founded in the place of an ancient settlement and in the neighborhood of the Great Moravian gord (hillfort). In these contexts, the possibility of an older monastic (monk) tradition from the time of Great Moravia, i.e. almost 200 years older, is occasionally discussed. But clear evidence has not yet been found.\nThe first Romanesque buildings were built with some delay from the beginning. The monastery owned several villages and other properties. It was looted several times in the Middle Ages and was restored again.\nIn the 18th century, during the powerful renewal of the Catholic confession, the monastery was in good condition and was generously rebuilt in the Baroque style. In particular, the convent church, designed by famous architect Jan Eichel Santini, is an excellent example of European Baroque architecture. With a unique and top composition of the internal vault system. A unique play of light and shadow.\nThe foundation stone of today's monastery church of St. Peter and Paul was laid on July 4, 1722. - Construction took 17 years. The \n== temple was re-consecrated on June 7, 1739 by the prince - bishop of Olomouc Jakob Ernst von Liechtenstein-Kastelkorn.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe nave is elongated, as it responds to the older medieval layout. It has a traditional orientation (west-east) and is divided into three semi-autonomous halls, spatially and optically continuous. each of the halls has its own vault system and geometry.\nVaults and walls are covered with beautiful baroque frescoes by the painter Johann Georg Etgens of Brno.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n[1] Benediktinské opactví Rajhrad – official webpage (in Czech)",

        "content": "Gianfranco \"JoJo\" Cassaro is a Canadian ice hockey defenseman who is currently a free agent. He was named a Second Team All-American in 2023–24.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\nAfter playing for the Youngstown Phantoms in his final two years of junior hockey, Cassaro signed on to play for Massachusetts after the team reached the NCAA championship for the first time. As a freshman, he was relegated to the third pair on defense. Though he scored just 3 points in 30 games, he was helping the team prepare for another run in the postseason when the season was ended abruptly. COVID-19 forced the entire playoff schedule to be abandoned and it was uncertain when Cassaro could resume his career. The 20–21 year started late and saw many cancellations throughout the year. Despite this, UMass played a total of 29 games. Unfortunately, Cassaro was only in the lineup for 10 matches and he ended up going pointless for the entire season. While the Minutemen ran up a tremendous record and ended up winning a National Championship, Cassaro was more of a spectator than a participant and he wasn't dressed for the championship game. With his career seemingly at a crossroads, Cassaro used the new NCAA transfer rules to move on to RIT and join the Tigers the following season. \nCassaro played all 38 games for the Tigers in his junior season. While his scoring numbers weren't outstanding, they were a distinct improvement over his time in Amherst. In his senior season, however, Cassaro found a new level to his game and broke out with a spectacular campaign. Cassaro quadrupled his point total and ended up scoring 14 goals over the course of the year. The pairing he made with Aiden Hansen-Bukata proved to be one of the most potent duos in the country and helped RIT win its first conference title in over a decade. While he was all-conference first team, Cassaro and the Tigers were stunned by Holy Cross in the semifinals and had their season ended abruptly.\nBecause of the COVID-19 pandemic, Cassaro was entitled to a fifth year and he remained in college for one final season. He ended up playing even better than he had as a senior and scored at nearly a point-per-game pace. His 18 goals on the season was tops in the nation for defensemen as was his 8 power play goals. Cassaro was named as a second team All-American for the outstanding year. His exploits of both sides of the puck helped RIT repeat as Atlantic Hockey champions and this time there was no repeat upset in the playoffs. RIT ran through the conference tournament and won all five games by at least 3 goals. The tournament championship sent RIT to the NCAA tournament for the first time in eight years and set up a match with #2 Boston University. The Terriers scored twice in the first period but Cassaro helped to spur on the RIT comeback. He assisted on one goal and scored a second to twice get his team within 1 but the BU offense was just too much for the Tigers. \n\n\n== Career statistics ==\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBiographical information and career statistics from Eliteprospects.com, or The Internet Hockey Database",

        "content": "Live is the first live album by English singer-songwriter Louis Tomlinson. It was a surprise album, released for streaming and digital download on 25 April 2024. It will be issued physically on 23 August 2024. Recorded at the Louis Tomlinson World Tour and Faith in the Future World Tour, which he embarked on to support his first two studio albums, Walls (2020) and Faith in the Future (2022), the live album consists of songs and performances on various dates.\n\n\n== Background and release ==\nOn 23 April 2024, Louis Tomlinson shared a link on social media while writing \"pre-save\", without confirming an album release. The singer later stated that specific locations would be sent a surprise by email to complete a puzzle, which contained the titles of the songs that later appeared on the track listing. While surprise-releasing Live, on 25 April, Tomlinson said: \"I’ve been lucky enough to spend the last 3 years touring the world twice over, the feeling I get sharing those live moments will be with me forever. This record is a true collaboration between me and you. Thank you for the amazing memories\". \nHis first live album contains 15 songs recorded live across 15 shows in 15 different cities, including London, Nashville, Vancouver and Barcelona. They were recorded throughout two concert tours, the Louis Tomlinson World Tour and the Faith in the Future World Tour, which Tomlinson embarked between 2020 and 2023. Live was released through digital download and streaming on 25 April 2024, while the physical editions of the album, including a double CD and 2 LP picture disc vinyl, will be released on 23 August 2024. To support the release, accompanying video clips of compiled tour footage were shared on Tomlinson's social media accounts.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nIn a positive review for Clash, Josh Abraham described Live as a \"emotional rollercoaster that keeps fans wanting more\", highlighted \"We Made It\" and \"Common People\" as standouts, and said that the theme of the album is \"the appreciation of what the artist has through music\". He also added: \"'Get as loud as you can' is shouted from [Tomlinson] on multiple tracks, which is exactly what every lover of his music is doing as they rundown the tracklist\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Eleanor Gwinnell Coit (May 6, 1894 – June 7, 1976) was an American labor educator and leader in adult education. Born in Newark, New Jersey, she graduated from Smith College in 1916 with a degree in history and English. Coit's career began with the Young Women’s Christian Association (YWCA), where she held various roles before pursuing further studies at Columbia University. She returned to the YWCA and later became the educational secretary for the American Labor Education Service (ALES), where she served until its closure in 1962. Coit's legacy includes pioneering work in workers' education and a lifelong commitment to social justice advocacy. She died in Hanover, New Hampshire.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBorn in Newark, New Jersey, Coit was the daughter of Henry Leber Coit, a pediatrician and advocate for pure milk, and Emma Gwinnell. She attended public schools in Newark before pursuing higher education at Smith College, where she earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in history and English in 1916.\n\n\n== Career ==\nFollowing her graduation, Coit initially explored more traditional female roles but soon found her calling in social work. After her father's death in 1917, she began her career as the work and industrial secretary of the Young Women’s Christian Association (YWCA) of the Oranges in New Jersey. Coit then pursued further studies in sociology, economics, and education at Columbia University, earning her Master of Arts degree in 1920.\nCoit's dedication and passion for social reform led her back to the YWCA, where she held various roles, including director and executive of industrial work in Bayonne, New Jersey, and later heading the business and industry department in Buffalo, New York. She conducted research for the Children's Bureau of the U.S. Department of Labor and the National Conference on the Christian Way of Life before returning to the YWCA as the industrial secretary for the national organization in New York in 1926.\nIn 1929, Coit was appointed educational secretary and director for the newly formed Affiliated Schools for Workers, later renamed the American Labor Education Service (ALES), where she served until its closure in 1962. Under her leadership, ALES expanded its focus to include a wide range of workers and developed innovative educational programs and materials.\nCoit's commitment to workers' education took her abroad, where she studied advanced methods in Scandinavia and Germany during the 1930s and 1940s. She secured funding from the Ford Foundation to conduct United Nations workshops and worker exchanges after World War II.\n\n\n== Legacy and later life ==\nLeading the American Labor Education Service (ALES), she facilitated the creation of innovative educational initiatives, influencing worker education domestically and internationally. Despite health challenges, Coit maintained her dedication to advocacy until her death in 1976.

Founded in 1893, the charitable foundation is run as a Gemeinnützige GmbH. The facility offers residential places in almost 40 groups, and also schools, workshops and assisted living facilities. It employs over 700 people.\n\nFrom 1991, the facility has included the Marienhausen children's and youth at the former Marienhausen monastery, which now offers inpatient residential groups, day groups, youth residential groups and assisted living. The former monastery church, Marienkirche, was restored from 2010 to 2014; inhabitants of the institution were included for the design of artwork.\nCaspar Söling has been director of the St. Vincenzstift from June 2006. The parish of the foundation is part of Heilig Kreuz, Geisenheim. Franz Kamphaus, the former bishop of Limburg until February 2007, was priest at the foundation after his retirement and is still a resident as of 2024. From 2010 Dagmar Bickmann took care of spiritual needs, and in 2023 Benjamin Rinkart followed as priest.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nFrings, Bernhard: Behindertenhilfe und Heimerziehung / Das Sankt Vincenzstift Aulhausen und das Jugendheim Marienhausen (in German) Aschendorff 2013\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nAulhausen, St. Vincenzstift (in German) lagis-hessen.de",

        "content": "Curt Elze (February 16, 1885 – April 9, 1972) was a German anatomist and professor at the universities of Rostock, Giessen, and Würzburg  during the Third Reich. He headed the anatomical institute at Würzburg and was associated with Werner Heyde for the supply of execution victims for use in medical studies.\nElze was born in Halle, son of a namesake lawyer and Lina née Frenkel (1857–1936). He went to school in Halle and studied medicine at the Universities of Freiburg and Halle, graduating in 1907. He studied human embryology and development under Franz Julius Keibel (1861–1929) and received a doctorate in 1908 after which he worked at the University of Vienna under Ferdinand Hochstetter. He completed his habilitation at the University of Heidelberg and became a lecturer. During World War I he served as a military doctor and returned in 1916 to work at the Heidelberg Hospital. He served in Heidelberg until 1921 when he became a professor of anatomy at the University of Rostock. In 1931 he served as a rector and the next year as vice-rector. In 1934 he joined the Nazi teachers' association and in 1940 he became a NSDAP member (number 8007883). He became chair of anatomy at Giessen in 1936. From 1940 he was a professor at the University of Würzburg where he succeeded Hans Petersen as director of the anatomical institute. During this period the institute received numerous bodies of Nazi execution victims for their use in dissection and study. Elze collaborated with Hermann Braus on his anatomical atlas (\"Anatomie des Menschen\") and served as an editor for the Zeitschrift für Anatomie und Entwicklungsgeschichte. From 1940 the anatomical institute received 80 bodies from Werner Heyde who headed a Nazi euthanasia program. Elze would later claim during denazification that he took his membership to the Nazi party only due to pressure from the teachers.\nElze married Annemarie Keil (1892–1995) in 1916 and they had two sons and two daughters. He is buried in the Protestant Laurentiusfriedhof in Halle.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "July Fourth is a 1951 oil painting by the American outsider painter Grandma Moses, produced at age 91 and signed \"Moses\". It is now in the White House, whose collections it entered in 1952.\nIt shows a summer scene of people celebrating Independence Day, set in a typical Moses green summer setting. The figures are taking part in a parade, a picnic, a revolutionary war re-enactment, and a game of baseball. The horse-drawn buggies show it's meant as a scene from the artist's childhood. The painting was given as a gift to Harry S. Truman for the White House collection in 1952, where it continues to hang today. Much later, it was selected as the basis for a commemorative 6 cent stamp in 1969.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nGalerie St. Etienne\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\"July Fourth | White House | Washingtn D.C.\" facebook.com/WhiteHouseHistory.

        "content": "Laurentius Boierus (born Boyer; Lithuanian: Laurencijus Bojeris; c. 1561 – c. 1619) was a Swedish-born Jesuit poet and theologist of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Boierus is most known for Carolomachia, a heroic poem written in 1606 dedicated to the Polish-Lithuanian victory in the Battle of Kircholm over the Swedish army.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\n\nLaurentius Boierus was born around 1561 in Stockholm, Sweden. His father, Willem Boy (also spelled Boiij, Boyen), was an architect and painter who served the King of Sweden Gustav I Vasa. It is thought that Boierus attended the Collegium regium Stockholmense, founded in 1567 by John III Vasa. It is believed that Boierus became acquainted with Jesuit diplomat Antonio Possevino. Possevino, Boierus, and other young Catholics left Stockholm to study in Prague, Olomouc, and Vilnius. After graduating from Prague's Clementinum, in 1579 Boierus moved to Olomouc. Boierus spent six years in the city studying philosophy despite the course only taking three years. He also contributed to the writing of a textbook in Swedish. From 1585 to 1587 Boierus studied theology in Vilnius. In Vilnius, Boierus joined the poetic activities of the university's students and wrote commemorative poems which were published in 1587. The poems had panegyric and satire elements. In one epigram, Boierus praises the defender of Catholicism, Andriejus Jurgevičius, and in another, Boierus condemns Jurgevičius's opponent, the Calvinist Andreas Volanus, making fun of his surname. Some sources mention that Boierus wrote scenic dialogues, panegyrics, and philosophical treatises. The same year, on 20 August 1587, he officially joined the Jesuit Order in Krakow. He lectured in the Tartu Jesuit College from 1595 to 1597.\n\n\n=== Jesuit lecturer ===\n\nIn 1594 he was ordained as a priest. From 1598 to 1601 Boierus lectured in the Jarosław Jesuit pedagogical seminary, and from 1598 to 1600 was a prefect of the Tartu Jesuit pedagogical seminary. Boierus worked intermittently at Possevino's interpreters' seminary (Seminarium interpretum Derpatense) in Tartu, which was intended for the development of Eastern and Northern European language translators for languages such as Swedish, Estonian, Russian, Polish, and German. It is thought that Konstantinas Sirvydas might have been Boierus's student. Between 1601 and 1603 Boierus was Laurentius Nicolai's assistant in Braniewo, Poland. Around 1603 he moved to Vilnius, where he lectured poetics, rhetoric, theology, and mathematics at Vilnius University. Boierus was reportedly gifted in scientific studies and knew Latin, ancient Greek, Italian, German, Swedish, and Estonian. A few years after his studies Boierus lectured in various seminars. While in Vilnius Boierus published Carolomachia in Latin; it was published under the name of Krzysztof Zawisza, then a student of Vilnius University, because Jesuit law prohibited authors from publishing poems with their own names.\n\n\n=== Later years ===\nAround 1610 Boierus left for Braniewo, where he lectured theology until 1612. He also lectured rhetoric in Nyasvizh from 1615 to 1616, and spent the remainder of his life from 1618 to 1619 as a study prefect in Braniewo. Boierus died there on either 3 February or 13 May.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "18×2 Beyond Youthful Days (Chinese: 青春18×2 通往有你的旅程) is a 2024 Taiwanese-Japanese romance film directed by Michihito Fujii and produced by Chang Chen. Starring Greg Hsu and Kaya Kiyohara, alongside an ensemble cast including Joseph Chang, Shunsuke Michieda, Haru Kuroki, Hitomi Kuroki, and Yutaka Matsushige, the film follows a recently fired Taiwanese video game developer (Hsu) on a solo trip to Japan, reminiscing about a past romantic entanglement with a Japanese backpacker (Kiyohara) that never blossomed into a relationship.\nAdapted from a travelogue published on the internet by Taiwanese video game developer Jimmy Lai in 2014, the film was stuck in development hell before Japanese filmmaker Michihito Fujii joined the project in 2019, turning it into a collaborative film between Taiwan and Japan. Fujii spent four years penning the screenplay, while lead actors Hsu and Kiyohara were announced to be part of the production in March 2023. Principal photography commenced in Japan in the same month and continued in Taiwan in April. Following the completion of filming in May 2023, the film underwent six months of post-production.\nThe film held its world premiere at the Ambassador Theatre in Taipei, on February 14, 2024, followed by a theatrical release on March 14 and May 3, in Taiwan and Japan, respectively.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nJimmy, the founder of a video game development studio, was fired from his own company during a board meeting. Devastated, he returned to his hometown of Tainan. While tidying his room, he stumbled upon a postcard he had received 18 years ago from his dear Japanese friend, Ami. He then received a phone call from the studio co-founder, Aaron, who invited him on the final business trip to Tokyo. After the business meeting, Aaron asked Jimmy about his future plans, to which Jimmy answered that he planned to embark on a trip without a destination.\nJimmy's thoughts drifted back 18 years to when he worked at the struggling Karaoke Kobe in Tainan during the summer before university. He met Ami, a Japanese backpacker looking for a place to work to save up money for an upcoming journey. Assigned to show her around, Jimmy and Ami had a chat, and Jimmy became romantically interested in Ami. The arrival of a foreign lady in the secluded town soon attracted numerous customers to the karaoke. During the welcoming meal, Ami was asked about her trip. She explained that she planned to go on a trip without a destination and showed her sketchbook of drawings recording her previous footsteps in Taiwan. Impressed, Jimmy suggested she decorate a wall at the karaoke. After the meal, Ami expressed her interest in motorcycles, and Jimmy took her to an observation deck with a stunning view of Tainan. They bonded and discussed their dreams. Jimmy confessed his uncertainty, and Ami encouraged him to search for a dream.\nIn the present, Jimmy arrived in Matsumoto and encountered Liu, a Taiwanese izakaya owner who suggested that he visit Ami's hometown, Tadami. On his journey, he met a young backpacker named Koji on the Iiyama Line, who recommended they stop at the snowing Nagaoka, where Jimmy was captivated by the scenery, reminiscent of the film Love Letter. Jimmy recalled that his co-workers had asked Ami to describe her ideal boyfriend, but her description contradicted Jimmy's characteristics. However, a co-worker encouraged him to pursue her anyway and gave him tickets to a romance film, Love Letter. During the movie, Ami cried miserably and found an excuse to leave the scene, leaving Jimmy confused.\nBack in the present, Jimmy met and befriended Yukiko, a staff member at a internet café who was playing the game he developed. Yukiko offered to drive him to the sky lantern festival. Jimmy then recalled Ami's sudden departure, where she announced one day that she was going back to Japan. Jimmy was furious with Ami and refused to talk to her, even when she finished the wall art. Jimmy's father, sensing his son's distress, encouraged him not to have regrets. Therefore, Jimmy asked Ami out once again and brought her to the sky lantern festival. They made a promise to meet each other again after they had the opportunity to pursue and fulfill their dreams.\nUpon arriving in Tadami, Jimmy met Ami's mother, Yuko, who revealed Ami's passing. Yuko gave Jimmy Ami's sketchbook, which contained drawings of Taiwan. Through the drawings, it was revealed that Ami had been suffering from cardiomyopathy and wished to travel around the world during the last days of her life. However, after meeting and falling in love with Jimmy in Taiwan, her desire to continue living was ignited, and she decided to seek alternative treatments in Japan. Therefore, she abruptly left Japan before her condition deteriorated and refused Jimmy's requests to see her in later years while she was hospitalized. Overwhelmed, Jimmy wept as he reached the last page of the sketchbook—a picture of them releasing sky lanterns, symbolizing their promise.\nOn his journey back, Jimmy wrote the first and last letter to Ami, sharing his life since their separation. He revealed that he became aware of Ami's death after finishing his first game and attempting to contact her. Subsequently, he spiraled into emotional numbness and lost all sense of purpose, which led to his alienation and eventual expulsion from the company. Finally, he expressed his gratitude for Ami's presence in his youthful days and promised to go on a trip without a destination in her honor.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nGreg Hsu as Jimmy: a successful video game developer who had a devastating falling out with his business partners, which prompted him to embark on a soul-searching journey in Japan.\nKaya Kiyohara as Ami: a Japanese backpacker who was romantically involved with Jimmy when they worked together at a karaoke bar in Tainan 18 years ago.\nJoseph Chang as Liu: a Taiwanese izakaya owner Jimmy encounters in Matsumoto.\nShunsuke Michieda as Koji: a Japanese young backpacker Jimmy befriends in Nagaoka.\nHaru Kuroki as Yukiko: an internet café staff member Jimmy acquainted during his stay.\nHitomi Kuroki as Yuko: the mother of Ami who resides in Tadami.\nYutaka Matsushige as Nakazato: a resident at Tadami who drives Jimmy to Yuko.\nAdditionally, Toyoharu Kitamura appears as Shimada, the Japanese boss of Karaoke Kobe. Co-workers of Jimmy at Karaoke Kobe include Buffy Chen as Hsiao-ting, Jane Liao as Shu-yi, and Lee Kuan-yi as Wei. Chu Chung Heng and Maggie Lu appear as the parents of Jimmy; and Figaro Tseng appears as Aaron, the university classmate and co-founder of Jimmy's video game development studio.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development ===\n18×2 Beyond Youthful Days is adapted from and based on real-life events recorded in a travelogue titled Wandering Journey on Slow Train in Japan, written by Jimmy Lai under the pseudonym \"Blue Fox\", a Taiwanese video game developer who embarked on a vacation journey across Japan using the Seishun 18 Ticket, aiming to reminisce about his romantic past with a Japanese backpacker. After publishing the travelogue on the Taiwanese blog Backpackers and it went viral in 2014, Lai was approached by film production studios interested in purchasing the adaptation rights. Eventually, producer Roger Huang acquired the rights and began searching for film directors and screenwriters to join the project. Actor Chang Chen and director-producer Lin Yu-Hsien became attached to the project in the early stages, with Chang making his debut as an executive producer at the invitation of his friend Huang, and he described the experience as a \"learning opportunity\". However, Lai became dissatisfied with the numerous screenplay drafts, feeling that the filmmakers and production companies were excessively expanding the story length and introducing new elements that deviated from the essence of his travelogue. As script after script was rejected and with Lai's subsequent relocation to the United States, the project was stuck in development hell for four years. In 2019, during the Kaohsiung Film Festival, Huang met Japanese director Michihito Fujii, who expressed interest in participating in Taiwanese film productions. Huang invited Fujii to helm the project, and Fujii accepted the role of director and screenwriter shortly after reading the travelogue. After Fujii joined the project, Huang rebranded the film from a domestic production with overseas location shoots into a collaborative film between Taiwan and Japan. Fujii initiated negotiations with Japanese production companies and sponsors, including CyberAgent, and East Japan Railway Company, which also permitted the crew to film on the railways with loaned train carriages.\n\n\n=== Pre-production ===\nAfter attaching to the project in 2019, Michihito Fujii spent four years penning the screenplay. He retained several background settings from Jimmy Lai's travelogue, including Lai's occupation as a video game developer and the names of the two main characters, Jimmy and Ami. However, he made numerous amendments, such as changing the story's background from Chiayi to Tainan, the hometown of Fujii's Taiwanese grandfather, as he found an older city more fitting for the film's tone. The time period was adjusted from 1996 to 2006, aligning it with Fujii's adolescence and allowing for a better grasp of the social atmosphere. Fujii also added backstories for Jimmy, detailing his venture into starting his own video game company, and explored the reasons why Ami traveled to Taiwan and her talent for drawing, which further enhanced their character arcs. Brian Lee, a real-life friend of Jimmy Lai and a video game developer for SIGONO, also influenced the portrayal of Jimmy's entrepreneurial failure. Opus: Rocket of Whispers and Opus: Echo of Starsong, two video games developed by Lee, were featured in the film.\nThe film's production was officially announced under the working title Youth (Chinese: 青春) in March 2023, with Far EasTone as a major sponsor and starring Greg Hsu, Kaya Kiyohara, Hitomi Kuroki, and Chang Chen in lead roles. Chang later dropped out of the acting role to focus on his duties as producer. The casting choices were all proposed by Fujii, and Chang Chen provided advice but did not have a direct role in the casting process. Greg Hsu was recommended to Fujii by his friends due to his ability to portray both the 18-year-old and 36-year-old versions of the character, which Fujii described as having \"a sense of both youthful and mature\". Hsu accepted the role after reading the script and was drawn to the film's robust production crew. Kaya Kiyohara, who had previously worked with Fujii on his 2019 film Day and Night and 2020 film The Brightest Roof in the Universe, readily accepted the role as she was fond of the story and interested in joining an international project. Hitomi Kuroki was invited by Chang Chen to make a cameo appearance, following their collaboration as award presenters at the 59th Golden Horse Awards, where Chang revealed to her that he was involved in a project with Michihito Fujii, and Kuroki gladly accepted the offer. The production crew consisted of an equal mix of Taiwanese and Japanese members, and Fujii prioritized the employment of crew members who were around 36 years old to better understand Jimmy's character traits in the film. Hsu was sent to Japan on the film's budget a week prior to filming to learn Japanese.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\nPrincipal photography began in Japan in March 2023. Michihito Fujii chose to film in Japan during March as Japan is undergoing seasonal change in that month, the crew was able to capture both snowfall at the beginning of the month and cherry blossoms at the end. Taiwanese cinematographer Chan Chih-teng was initially attached to the project but had to withdraw since his wife was scheduled to give birth in that period. Keisuke Imamura, a frequent collaborator of Fujii, stepped in as the substitute cinematographer. Keisuke intentionally included a snowfall scene shot in Japan as a tribute to the 1995 romance film Love Letter. He also established a fixed colour temperature and selected lenses with Fujii prior to filming, aiming to create a contrast between the warm orange tones of Taiwan and the cold blue tones of Japan. Filming took place in Tokyo, Kanagawa Prefecture, Nagano Prefecture, Niigata Prefecture, and Fukushima Prefecture, which the latter four are located on the JR Iiyama Line or Tadami Line. East Japan Railway Company provided assistance for the crew in set construction while filming in train carriages. Several scenes were cinematographed at Mori-Miyanohara Station, Nagaoka Station, and Tadami Station, as well as the railway crossing near Kamakurakōkōmae Station, a popular tourist spot due to its feature in the manga Slam Dunk, which Hsu himself is a fan of. On March 25, scenes of Hsu and Haru Kuroki's character releasing sky lanterns were shot at ski resort New Greenpia Tsunan in Tsunan, Niigata. Other filming locations included Shibuya Excel Hotel Tokyu and Sumida Park in Tokyo, Matsumoto Castle in Nagano, and Yuigahama in Kanagawa.\nAfter completing the scenes in Japan, the crew moved to Taiwan and commenced filming in April. The majority of the filming was completed in Tainan, with occasional shoots in Yunlin County, Kaohsiung, and New Taipei City. In Tainan, the filming locations included Fort Provintia, Shuei Sian Temple Market, Tiantan Tiangong Temple, Hsinchu East Gate, and Sihcao Boulevard, which served as the dating spots for Hsu and Kiyohara's characters in the film. Hsu and Kiyohara spent nine hours filming on a motorcycle, shuttling between these locations. Filming then continued at Chuan Mei Theatre, the only Taiwanese theater adorned with hand-painted movie posters, on April 12. The film also featured Wusheng Night Market, where the crew invited local hawkers to participate in the shoot. Other filming locations in Tainan included Bao'an railway station and Yuguang Island, as well as the campus of Tainan University of Technology, which Hsu's character attended.\nHsu took a brief hiatus to attend the 59th Baeksang Arts Awards which was held on April 28 in South Korea, before returning to film the scenes depicting Hsu and Kiyohara releasing sky lanterns at Shifen railway station in Pingxi District, New Taipei City, on April 29. The shooting schedule at Shifen was disrupted by weather conditions, resulting in a delay from nightfall to the following morning. The scenes set at Karaoke Kobe, a recurring location in the film where Hsu and Kiyohara's characters worked, were filmed at a spa centre in Huwei, Yunlin. The entire centre underwent renovation to recreate a nostalgic ambience. The exterior wall painting of the Karaoke was decorated by Fujii's sister and picture book illustrator Rumi Yoshida. Hsu mentioned that the scenes revolving around the Karaoke were grouped together and filmed intensively, describing those shoots as having \"boss-fighting level of difficulty\". Additionally, Fujii personally selected the observation deck of Mount Dagan in Kaohsiung as a recurring backdrop for the film due to its captivating night view. Filming ultimately concluded in late May.\n\n\n=== Post-production ===\nPost-production spanned across six months, and was carried out separately in Taiwan and Japan. The respective crews in each country handled the scenes shot within their jurisdiction. As the film was set in two separate timelines, Fujii personally drew storyboards for continuity editing to connect the junctions between scene changes. He also made an effort to group scenes from the same timeline together, minimizing the need for transitions. However, he allowed the two crews to employ different styles and pacing during the editing process to better convey the cultural differences between the two countries. The film was announced to be distributed by Happinet Phantom Studios in Japan, and sales were launched at the Asian Contents and Film Market on October 7, 2023. The film was officially announced to be released in Japan on October 27, 2023, with a projected theatrical release date of May 2024. In Taiwan, the film's title was changed to 18×2 Beyond Youthful Days during the official announcement on October 30, with an expected theatrical release date of March 14, 2024, coinciding with White Day.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nThe film is scored by Japanese composer Takashi Ohmama, featuring 32 original soundtracks. The film's theme song, \"Traveller of Memories\", is performed by the Japanese band Mr. Children. Production of the theme song began during the scriptwriting stage. Michihito Fujii is a long-time fan of the band who started listening to their songs in his teenage years and personally invited them to contribute to the film, which he considers a milestone in his career. Kazutoshi Sakurai, the lead vocalist of Mr. Children, described their collaboration as an effort to \"eliminate all impurities and present the music in its purest form\", aligning with the film's theme and emotions. Additionally, the film features the Taiwanese band Mayday's song \"Peter and Mary\", recommended by Fujii's Taiwanese assistant, who likened Mayday to the Taiwanese counterpart of Mr. Children. The film's score is scheduled to be released as a soundtrack album on May 1, 2024, in Japan.\n\n\n== Marketing ==\nThe Japanese version teaser of the film was released on October 7, 2023, followed by the Taiwanese version on October 30, alongside the official promotional poster. Both Taiwanese and Japanese versions of the official trailer were released on January 25, 2024. The Taiwanese version of the official trailer was edited by filmmaker John Hsu, who shared a similar background with the protagonist Jimmy, as they both aspired to become video game developers in their early lives. Jump! Boys, the film's production company, launched a marketing campaign in collaboration with the East Japan Railway Company and Klook in March 2024, which introduced a packaged rail pass that included the filming locations of Jimmy's journey. Additionally, a special collaboration with video game developer SIGONO took place, featuring a crossover poster with SIGONO's game Opus: Echo of Starsong released in selected cinemas on March 30 and 31. An official guidebook is scheduled for release on May 2 in Japan.\n\n\n== Release ==\n18×2 Beyond Youthful Days had its world premiere at the Ambassador Theatre in Taipei on February 14, 2024, and was released theatrically in Taiwan on March 14. A special screening event took place in Tokyo on March 27, with a theatrical release in Japan scheduled for May 3. Additionally, the film was selected to be screened at the 48th Hong Kong International Film Festival on March 29, 2024, and is scheduled for a screening at the 26th Far East Film Festival on April 27.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Box office ===\n18×2 Beyond Youthful Days grossed over NT$7.7 million on its first day of release, directly ascending to the top of the box office in Taiwan. By the end of the first weekend, it had accumulated a total gross of NT$28 million, securing the top position in the weekly box office. In its second week, the film grossed over NT$45 million, making it the highest-grossing 2024 domestic film in Taiwan. The film grossed over NT$50 million by the third week, and surpassed NT$60 million within the fourth week. It reached a cumulative gross of over NT$70 million by the fifth weekend.\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nAlan Chu, writing for United Daily News, lauded the film for its nostalgic and romantic elements, blending both Taiwanese and Japanese aesthetics, and its breathtaking cinematography. He also commended Greg Hsu for his versatile performance and Kaya Kiyohara for delivering an emotionally moving portrayal, while acknowledging the star-studded supporting cast that further enhanced the film's appeal. CommonWealth Magazine's Sumi Chen shared a similar opinion, praising director Michihito Fujii's meticulous attention to detail, the authentic performances of the actors, and the film's skillful exploration of love, nostalgia, and cultural differences, ultimately considering it a compelling cinematic experience. Conversely, James Marsh of South China Morning Post, while expressing compliments on the film as refreshingly conventional and surprisingly effective, noted that the film's formulaic story and Hsu's portrayal of the younger Jimmy lack emotional maturity.\nWriting for HK01, Keith Ho focused on the aesthetics of the film, highlighting its capture of picturesque landscapes in Taiwan and Japan, which contributed to the film's portrayal of a poignant and beautiful love story set in 2024 Japan and 2006 Taiwan. Ying Jou Chien, reviewing for Yahoo! Lifestyle, highlighted the film as a heartfelt love story that paid homage to classic youth films, particularly those by Japanese director Shunji Iwai, and captured the essence of youth and creates a new classic in the genre of youth romance, with the nature and realistic performances of the lead actors Hsu and Kiyohara.\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n18×2 Beyond Youthful Days at IMDb",

        "content": "The Sky of Salamanca (El Cielo de Salamanca) is a mural painting attributed to Fernando Gallego that corresponds to the third part of the decoration of the vault of the old Library of the Major Schools of the University of Salamanca. The original vault was painted in the 1480s and occupied the upper part of the current chapel of San Jerónimo. In the middle of the 18th century, the height of the nave used for the chapel was increased, leaving the painting hidden in a chamber of about four meters between the roof of the building and the new vault of the chapel. In these works, the other two thirds of the old vault in which the painting was located collapsed. In 1901 they were rediscovered by Professor García Boiza. In the 1950s the paintings were removed from the original vault, transferred to canvas and moved to their current location (University Museum in the Minor Schools) for contemplation.\nThe painting is an astrological representation (signs, constellations the Sun and Mercury) following the iconography of the Poeticon Astronomicon. It was inspired by the chair of astrology that had recently been established (c. 1460) at the University of Salamanca. In the original vault, the planets the Sun and the Moon were represented in their houses although this cannot be confirmed since only one-third of the original vault is preserved.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Shikarpur Christian Hospital (SCH) is a hospital in Shikarpur, Sindh, Pakistan. It is part of Indus Christian Fellowship.\n\n\n== History ==\nShikarpur Christian Hospital (SCH) was founded by Maybel Bruce, a missionary from the Conservative Baptist Foreign Missionary Society (now WorldVenture), who arrived in Pakistan in January 1957. The hospital was established to address the healthcare needs of women and children in the region, combining medical treatment with educational and preventive medicine.\nThe construction of SCH began in 1965 when missionary Frank Dobra purchased land in Shikarpur. Initially, temporary clinics in Shikarpur and Larkana provided outpatient services, home deliveries, and prenatal care. The hospital was officially inaugurated at its permanent site in Shikarpur in April 1969, with facilities including an outpatient department, offices, a laboratory, a pharmacy, surgical and medical wards, and a chapel.\nIn 1988, an operating-delivery block was added to expand the hospital's services.\nSCH gained recognition for its high-quality care, particularly under the leadership of Maybel Bruce, who was known for performing vesicovaginal fistula surgery. The hospital's staff comprises international healthcare workers from Canada, the United States, England, and New Zealand. The hospital also runs a nurses' aide training program and engages in community health outreach to contribute to local community development.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Highland Laddie is a six-issue comic book limited series by Garth Ennis and John McCrea (with Keith Burns). Originally published as a spin-off of The Boys, set between issues #47 and #48, it follows the story of \"Wee Hughie\" Campbell as in the aftermath of learning his ex-girlfriend Annie to be a Supe, he takes a sabbatical from the Boys and returns home to Auchterladle, the Scottish seaside town where he grew up, where he reunites with his mystery-solving childhood friends, Bobby and Det. Highland Laddie was collected in trade paperback in April 2011 as the eighth volume of The Boys, as The Boys: Highland Laddie. Storylines from the series would be continued in the 2020 The Boys epilogue series Dear Becky.\nElements of Highland Laddie were adapted to the Amazon Prime Video streaming television adaptation of The Boys, in the adaptation of Starlight's backstory from A Young Man's Fancy, and Simon Pegg and Rosemarie DeWitt portraying Hughie's parents.\n\n\n== Premise ==\n\n\n=== Part 1: The Harbour at the World's End ===\nHis mind still reeling from the events of The Innocents, Wee Hughie heads back home to the semi-idyllic Scottish seaside town of Auchterladle where he grew up, eight years after he left and two years after meeting Billy Butcher. While all he wants is some time to himself, Hughie finds his luck more cloud than silver lining, and the familiar surroundings he craves to not be what he encounters.\n\n\n=== Part 2: Great Glass Elevator ===\nHughie delves into his past, finding the halcyon days of a childhood long past to not be all they're cracked up to be, in-so-far as successes of his junior detective operations with Big Bobby and Det, unaware of a connection between their oldest case and a shadowy outfit now moving Compound V-infused narcotics through the otherwise idyllic town of Auchterladle.\n\n\n=== Part 3: Beware the Jabberwock, My Son ===\nLife in Auchterladle starts to settle down for Hughie, and with the return of his old love Annie, there may even be a ray of sunshine for our young hero. But into Eden comes the serpent, as Joe Tupper and the monstrous Big Sarah set about their bloody business. Just when things are looking up for Hughie, a new arrival throws his world into chaos yet again…\n\n\n=== Part 4: A Young Man's Fancy ===\nAs Hughie looks into the past of his erstwhile girlfriend Annie – a.k.a. Starlight of The Seven – but what he finds it to be is far from what he expected. Meanwhile, the true horror of Joe Tupper's Compound V-infused drug smuggling operation is explored…\n\n\n=== Part 5: Wisdom of the Ages ===\nAs Hughie does his best to get to the root of his personal troubles, events in Auchterladle begin spinning out of control.

        "content": "Adil Bešić (April 5, 1964 – November 28, 1992) was a Bosnian military officer in the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nHe started his military career in the Yugoslav People's Army as an officer, and from 1992 he was a member of the Territorial Defense of Bihać. As the commander of the 2nd battalion of the 502nd famous mountain brigade of the Fifth Corps, he died on November 28, 1992, in the Grabež region while performing a combat mission. He was posthumously awarded the Golden Lily and the Order of the Hero of the Liberation War of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHe was born in Banja Luka on April 5, 1964. He was named after his mother, Adila, who died 8 days after his birth. He grew up in a family originating from the Prijedor neighborhood of Kozarac, which consisted of his father Adem, stepmother Bahri, and brothers: the elder Nihad and two younger brothers Ilijaz and Izet.\nSoon after his birth, in 1964, the Bešić family moved from Kozarac to Prijedor, where Adil finished elementary school. In 1978, as an excellent student, he went to Zagreb, where he entered the Military High School, after which he continued his education at the Military Academy, majoring in the Army. He attended the first two years of the military academy in Sarajevo, and the remaining two years of study in Belgrade, where he graduated.\n\n\n=== Military career ===\nAfter graduating from the Military Academy, he continued his career in the JNA, as an officer. His office was originally located in Tolmin, Slovenia. Over time, he proves himself a promising officer. He completes a course for JNA reconnaissance units, after which he works as an intelligence agent in the border area, on the state triple border, between the former Yugoslavia, Austria, and Italy.\nWith the declaration of Slovenia's independence and the beginning of the Ten-Day War, the JNA unit he served was located on the Yugoslav border, in Nova Gorica. After the JNA withdrew from the territory of Slovenia, the JNA unit in which Adil Bešić was on August 29, 1991, together with about 100 vehicles was stationed in Bihać. Part of that unit, in which Adil was also, was transferred to Plitvice, over which JNA forces took control on March 31, 1991.\nAfter the start of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, he left the JNA. He then joined the Territorial Defense of RBiH in Bihać, where he took command of the Territorial Defense Detachment \"Gata-Vrsta\".\n\n\n=== Bosnian War ===\nAfter taking command of the TO \"Gata-Vrsta\" Detachment, Adil Bešić, as a professional military person, established a military organization and, through his activities in the Detachment, asked his subordinates to professionally perform the tasks entrusted to them while strictly punishing all illegal actions and respecting the Geneva Conventions.\nThe first significant event under the command of Adil Bešić took place on June 12, 1992, when, in an organized action, the TO \"Vrsta\" units liberated the populated place of Bulgar and went to the state border with Croatia.\nIn the next period, the Detachment preserved the defense lines and reached the Serbian Plateau and other defense lines around Bihać.\nWith the formation of the 2nd Bihać Brigade (502nd Knight's Mountain Brigade), Adil Bešić became the commander of its 2nd battalion.\nIn November 1992, the forces led by Bešić liberated Lohovska Brda. After the successes achieved in the Grabež region, he was killed on November 28, 1992, as the commander of the 2nd Battalion of the then 2nd Bihać Brigade, while performing a combat mission.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Raúl Casañ Martí (born 27 September 1976) is a Spanish retired footballer who played as a central midfielder, and currently the manager of CD Ibiza Islas Pitiusas.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\nBorn in Beniparrell, Valencian Community, Casañ made his senior debut in the Regional Preferente with Picassent CF in 1995, and moved straight to Segunda División B in the following year with SD Huesca. After suffering relegation, he signed for CF Badalona in Tercera División, but joined fellow league team CP Villarrobledo one year later.\nCasañ would play in the third and fourth tiers for the remainder of his career, representing Talavera CF, Benidorm CF (achieving promotion to the third division in 2004), CD Alcoyano, UB Conquense and SCR Peña Deportiva. In 2009, after the latter's relegation, he agreed to a deal with Catarroja CF.\nOn 4 July 2010, Casãn returned to Peña, with the club in the division four. In 2012, he retired at the age of 35.\n\n\n== Managerial career ==\nImmediately after retiring, Casañ became a sporting director of his last club Peña Deportiva, being later named manager of the Juvenil side. On 5 June 2018, following the main squad's relegation to the fourth division, he was named manager of the squad. \nCasañ led Peña to an immediate promotion in his first year, and reached the play-offs in his second, missing out a second consecutive promotion after losing to CD Castellón. He also reached the round of 32 of the Copa del Rey in the 2020–21 season, but opted to leave the club on 26 May 2021, after 11 years linked with Peña overall.\nHours after leaving Peña, Casañ was named manager of Primera División RFEF side UE Cornellà for the 2021–22 campaign. The following 21 March, after a four-match winless streak which saw the club enter the relegation zone, he was sacked.\nOn 15 June 2022, Casañ took over Unionistas de Salamanca CF also in the third division, but was dismissed on 19 February of the following year. On 26 May 2023, he was named at the helm of CD Ibiza Islas Pitiusas in Tercera Federación.\n\n\n== Managerial statistics ==\nAs of 28 April 2024\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRaúl Casañ at BDFutbol\nRaúl Casañ manager profile at BDFutbol",

        "content": "Daniel Floro da Silva (born 1 June 1996), known as Daniel Passira, is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as a forward for Bolivian club San Antonio Bulo Bulo.\n\n\n== Career ==\nNicknamed after his hometown, Passira (in the state of Pernambuco), Daniel played for Vitória das Tabocas and Central as a youth, but after receiving little first team opportunities at the latter, he opted to leave at the age of 19. He then went on to play amateur football while working in farms, before being invited to play in the Campeonato Pernambucano Série A2 for Centro Limoeirense.\nAfter impressing with Centro by scoring seven goals in 12 appearances, Daniel Passira moved to Salgueiro for the 2019 season. Unable to establish himself as a regular starter for the club, he served loan stints at Mixto, Caucaia and Guarany de Sobral.\nOn 7 October 2021, Daniel Passira was announced at Treze, but did not feature in any matches, and signed with URT on 2 December. After nine goalless matches, he moved to Pacajus in the Série D.\nAfter being Pacajus' top scorer with six goals, Daniel Passira agreed to a contract with Série C side Campinense on 4 July 2022, but the deal fell through three days later, as he already played for two clubs in national competitions during the season. Back to Pacajus, he helped the side to win the year's Copa Fares Lopes before being announced at Campinense on 12 November.\nOn 10 March 2023, Daniel Passira moved to Nacional-AM, but featured rarely and signed for Maranhão in April. On 11 February of the following year, he left the latter club to join Bolivian Primera División side San Antonio Bulo Bulo, managed by compatriot Thiago Leitão.\n\n\n== Career statistics ==\nAs of 24 April 2024\n\n\n== Honours ==\nSalgueiro\n\nCampeonato Pernambucano: 2020\nPacajus\n\nCopa Fares Lopes: 2022\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Louise de Schweinitz Darrow (August 15, 1897 – April 3, 1997) was an American physician and birth control advocate.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\n\nDe Schweinitz was born in Nazareth, Pennsylvania, the daughter of Paul de Schweinitz and Mary Catherine Daniel de Schweinitz. Her father was one of six bishops of the Moravian Church in the United States, and a descendant of Nicolaus Zinzendorf. Her grandfather Robert William de Schweinitz was a noted educator, and her great-grandfather was botanist Lewis David de Schweinitz. Her sister was social worker and federal labor official Dorothea de Schweinitz. She graduated from Smith College in 1918, attended Columbia University in 1919 and 1920, where she was a classmate and friend of Amelia Earhart, and earned her medical degree at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in 1924.\n\n\n== Career ==\nDarrow completed a residency at the New England Hospital for Women and Children, and was a staff physician at Yale University. Darrow was a suffragist, a strong advocate of sex education, and worked at an illegal birth control clinic in New Haven, Connecticut in the 1930s. \"I think every girl who has a chance to take the Pill and do what she wants should read a biography of Sanger and realize what it meant to get the laws changed,\" she said in a 1975 interview. \nShe and her husband moved to Kansas City in 1954, where they were both pediatric specialists. She was assistant director of the Children's Rehabilitation Unit at the University of Kansas Medical Center. She traveled in South American with the Pan American Medical Women's Alliance in 1975. She volunteered at the hospital well into her nineties, and was honored by the Exchange Club of Jackson County in 1988 for her volunteer work. \nDarrow sometimes spoke to community groups about her friendship with Amelia Earhart. Earhart visited Darrow in Connecticut in 1936, shortly before Earhart's final flight. \n\n\n== Publications ==\n\"Delays in Diagnosis of Deafness Among Preschool Children\" (1959, with C. Arden Miller and June B. Miller)\n\"How Infants Three, Four, and Five Months of Age Respond to Sound\" (1963, with June Miller and Cornelius P. Goetzinger)\n\"Perinatal and Environmental Factors in Late Neurogenic Sequelae\" (1966, with Eleni Bacola, Franklin C. Behrle, Herbert C. Miller, and Mary Mira)\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nDe Schweinitz married fellow pediatrician Daniel Cady Darrow in 1923. They had five children. Her husband died in 1965. She died in 1997, at the age of 99, at a retirement community for women in West Orange, New Jersey. Her papers and those of her sister Dorothea are in the Sophia Smith Collection of Women's History at Smith College. There is a Louise de Schweinitz Darrow Award at the University of Kansas, \"given to students who demonstrate scholastic achievement, leadership potential, and social consciousness.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

Nisan and Szegedy showed that degree and approximate degree are also polynomially related to all these measures. Their proof went via yet another complexity measure, block sensitivity, which had been introduced by Nisan. Block sensitivity generalizes a more natural measure, (critical) sensitivity, which had appeared before.\nNisan and Szegedy asked whether block sensitivity is polynomially bounded by sensitivity (the other direction is immediate since sensitivity is at most block sensitivity). This is equivalent to asking whether sensitivity is polynomially related to the various decision tree complexity measures, as well as to degree, approximate degree, and other complexity measures which have been shown to be polynomially related to these along the years. This became known as the sensitivity conjecture.\nAlong the years, several special cases of the sensitivity conjecture were proven.\nThe sensitivity theorem was finally proven in its entirety by Huang, using a reduction of Gotsman and Linial.\n\n\n== Statement ==\nEvery Boolean function \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        :\n        {\n        0\n        ,\n        1\n        \n          }\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        →\n        {\n        0\n        ,\n        1\n        }\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f\\colon \\{0,1\\}^{n}\\to \\{0,1\\}}\n  \n can be expressed in a unique way as a multilinear polynomial.

The label was founded in 2019.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2019 Sol Generation signed its first artist, Bensoul, a Kenyan musician. In the same year, the label signed Kenyan artists; Nviiri The Story Teller, Kaskazini (now Watendawili) and Crystal Asige. Within the same year Crystal Asige amicably left the label. Kaskazini (now Watendawili), also exited the label, citing having difficulties adjusting to being in a label The boy band mentioned that Sol Generation was their way of reinvesting the money invested into them by their fans to the growing artists. In 2021, the label signed Bien Aime Baraza, one of the cofounders and members of Sauti Sol  . The other cofounders and Sauti Sol members Savara, Chicano and Polycarp are also signed to the label.\nIn 2022, former signee Crystal Asige sued Sol Generation Records and Sauti Sol for breech of contract. She also wanted compensation for the songs she contributed towards while signed to the label.\nIn 2023, Bensol announced his departure from the label, to pave way for newer artists. In 2024, Nviiri the Story Teller also announced his departure from the label. \nIn 2023, Sol Generation announced an Artist Development Programme aimed at developing 300 East African artists. The program is meant to develop their skills includingnsongwriting, music distribution, brand development and financial management. \nIn 2024, Sol Generation signed a new Kenyan female artist, Le'Laika. In the same year, the label also signed Mordecai Mwini of the Kenyan band, H-art The Band\n\n\n== TV Show ==\nIn 2020, Sol Generation members; Bien, Savara, Chimano, Polycarp, Bensoul and Nviiri were part of the reality show Sol Family. The show followed their personal lives and business within the label. The show  aired from 2020 to 2021 for two seasons",

Referring to her as 'Vastad Bi' and 'Beti' in his letters, Gandhi valued her insights.\nThe correspondence between her and Mahatma Gandhi covered a range of topics. In a letter dated 22 December 1932, Gandhi expressed his anticipation of Zohra's weekly letters.

After a year as a reporter for the TV show Le Iene, in 2007 he made his acting debut with Il rabdomante, directed by Fabrizio Cattani, who discovered him after an argument between Gerardi and a driver for a parking lot in Trastevere, Rome, thinking Gerardi had the right skills for acting.\nSince then, he has worked for many films and television series. He starred in comedies and dramas such as Basilicata coast to coast, Qualunquemente, Diaz – Don't Clean Up This Blood, Balancing Act, Io sono Mia, Padrenostro, The Last Paradise, and Last Night of Amore.

It is now in the Philadelphia Museum of Art, whose collections it entered in 2009.\nIt shows an unusual theme of a large group of people, set in a typical Moses winter snow setting. The figures are ambiguous in relation to the title. The train could be arriving or departing, and the people could be arriving or departing. \nThe painting was donated by the Kallir Family Foundation in 2009 in memory of Anne d'Harnoncourt, the modern art expert and CEO of the museum who died suddenly in 2008. It featured as the most recent donation in the 2013 exhibition First Look: Collecting for Philadelphia, where other paintings had been donated for the same reason.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGalerie St. Etienne\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\"The Departure | Philadelphia Museum of Art | Philadelphia\". philamuseum.org.

        "content": "The peranemids are a group of phagotrophic flagellates, single-celled eukaryotes or protists. They belong to the Euglenida, a diverse lineage of flagellates that contains the closely related euglenophyte algae. Like these algae, peranemids have flexible cells capable of deformation or metaboly, and have one or two flagella in the anterior region of the cell. They are classified as family Peranemidae (ICZN) or Peranemataceae (ICBN) within the monotypic order Peranemida (ICZN) or Peranematales (ICBN).\n\n\n== Description ==\nPeranemids are unicellular eukaryotes or protists. They are flagellates, with one or two flagella for locomotion. The flagella are located in the anterior end of the cell, and are used in a gliding motion in contact with the substrate to propel the cell forward. In addition, like some other euglenids, their cells exhibit a certain movement known as metaboly or 'euglenid motion' characterized by extreme flexibility and malleability.\n\n\n== Evolution ==\nPeranemids are a group of Euglenida, a diverse lineage of flagellates containing the closely related euglenophyte algae. In particular, both peranemids and euglenophytes belong to the Spirocuta clade, which contains all flexible euglenids capable of elastic movement or metaboly. This quality is due to the high number of proteinaceous strips that are present underneath their cell membrane, in comparison to more basal euglenids such as ploeotids which are completely rigid.\nIn molecular phylogenetic analyses, they were solved as a paraphyletic group encompassing various independent clades scattered across the Spirocuta clade. More recent multigene analyses resolve peranemids as the monophyletic sister group of the photosynthetic Euglenophyceae. However, these analyses are incomplete, since there is a lack of molecular data for the peranemid genus Teloprocta, and other genera such as Urceolus and Heteronema are not fully represented. For these reasons, the monophyly of peranemids has not been completely tested. These findings are summarized in the following cladogram:\n\n\n== Classification ==\nCurrently, five genera are accepted within the peranemids: \n\nPeranema Christen, 1962\nChasmostoma Massart, 1920\nJenningsia Schaeffer, 1918 (=Peranemopsis Lackey, 1940)\nTeloprocta Cavalier-Smith, 2016\nUrceolus Mereschkowsky, 1877 (=Phialonema Stein, 1878; Urceolopsis Stokes, 1887)\n\n\n== References ==",

It is an inclination in which the person returns the favor, or in some cases passes it on to other people. Anthropologists have implied that the phenomenon is probably global. The urge to treat others good and the urge to return favors is useful for the entire group. Promoting co-operation could have provided an evolutionary benefit. One instance of reciprocity bias happens in restaurant tipping, since if the waiter gives tiny gifts or sweets, this way they raise the chance of getting tipped.\n\n\n== Negative bias ==\nReciprocity bias also works other way around, when someone does something bad to the person, they may feel the urge to do something equally bad to them.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

The river is 115 km (71 mi) long and the area of its basin is 6,056 km2 (2,338 sq mi).  \nThe water is fresh and is used by locals to irrigate crops and watering livestock. The area surrounding the Saryozen is a seasonal grazing ground for local cattle.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Saryozen valley is located in the Semipalatinsk Test Site complex. A total of 24 underground nuclear explosion tests were performed\nin wells between 1965 and 1980. The area is contaminated.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe Saryozen belongs to the Irtysh basin. It has its sources in parallel rivulets flowing from the southern slopes of the Myrzhyk range and a north-flowing watercourse of Akshok mountain, at the eastern sector of the Kazakh Uplands. The river heads initially eastwards, then it bends northeastwards and in its lower course it bends slightly again and heads roughly northwards. Finally it ends in the Akmolaisor (Shalkarsor), an endorheic salt lake.\nThe Saryozen flows across a hilly and rugged region of the highland Kazakh steppe. There are many small endorheic lakes along the river course. The river fills in the spring with melted snow and rain, reaching its highest level at the end of April. By the summer it breaks up into disconnected pools.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of rivers of Kazakhstan\nLake Shagan\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCharacterization of area radioactive contamination of near-surface soil at the Sary-Uzen site in the Semipalatinsk test site",

        "content": "Wicked is the second album by the American musician Shemekia Copeland, released in 2000. It peaked at No. 8 on Billboard's Blues Albums chart. Wicked was nominated for a Grammy Award for \"Best Contemporary Blues Album\". It won a W. C. Handy Award for \"Blues Album of the Year\". Copeland supported the album by touring with B. B. King.\n\n\n== Production ==\nCopeland spent three weeks recording Wicked. Nine of the songs were cowritten by John Hahn, who also coproduced the album with Bruce Iglauer and Jimmy Vivino. She duetted with Ruth Brown on \"If He Moves His Lips\". \"Beat Up Guitar\" is a tribute to Copeland's father, Johnny Copeland. \"It's My Own Tears\" was written by Johnny. The Uptown Horns contributed to \"Up on 1-2-5\". Sugar Blue played a harmonica solo on \"It's 2 A.M.\".\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nThe Globe and Mail wrote that Copeland \"has the kind of burly blues voice that used to make the juke joints shake when Bessie Smith was still singing about a pig's foot and a bottle of beer.\" The Austin Chronicle concluded: \"Her band is solid, the production smart, the song selection suitably diverse, but the story here is Copeland's undeniable presence, reflecting a confidence that belies her young age.\" Robert Christgau praised \"Steamy Windows\" and \"If He Moves His Lips\".\nThe Chicago Tribune noted that \"the conventional band, and blues-cliche songwriters such as John Hahn, can't find the right connection.\" The Gazette called Copeland \"an extremely powerful singer... She can shake the rafters.\" The Los Angeles Times opined that \"Wicked is the kind of standard-issue showcase that labels such as Alligator have been churning out for decades, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.\"\nAllMusic wrote that \"Copeland continues to prove herself as one of the strongest young talents in the blues.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Mário Castelhano (1896–1940) was a Portuguese anarcho-syndicalist, railway worker and journalist. During the time of the First Portuguese Republic, he began organising strike actions within the General Confederation of Labour (CGT). He edited the organisation's various newspapers, including that of the railway workers' union, during the early 1920s. He was elected general secretary of the CGT after the establishment of the National Dictatorship and was arrested for his part in the February 1927 Revolt, following which the CGT was banned. Exiled, he went on to participate in the Madeira uprising and later clandestinely returned to Portugal, where he organised the Portuguese general strike of 1934. He was again arrested and deported, later dying in Tarrafal concentration camp in Cape Verde. His memoirs about his exile in Angola, in which he clearly expressed his views on anti-colonialism and anti-racism, were published posthumously in 1975.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMário Castelhano was born into a working-class family in Lisbon, in 1896. At the age of 14, he began working for the Portuguese Railways, where he took part in the 1911 strike and was involved in organising the 1918 and 1920 strikes, for which he was dismissed from his job. He then went to work as a bookkeeper for the General Confederation of Labour (CGT), an anarcho-syndicalist trade union, within which he was a member of the railway workers' union. During the 1920s, he was editor-in-chief of the trade union newspapers A Federação Ferroviária and A Batalha, and a contributor to the magazine Renovação. He was also director of the newspapers O Ferroviário and O Rápido. In these newspapers, he wrote extensively about the revolutionary potential of workers in the transportation industry.\nAfter the 28 May 1926 coup d'état, which overthrew the First Portuguese Republic and established the National Dictatorship, he was elected as general secretary of the CGT and oversaw the reorganisation of its structure. Following the repression of the February 1927 Revolt, the CGT was outlawed and the offices of A Batalha were raided. Its last issue was published on 26 May 1927. Castelhano was arrested in October 1927 and deported to the following month to Angola, where he was imprisoned for nearly three years. He was sent to the coastal city of Novo Redondo, then to inland towns such as Amboiva, Conda and Seles, where he worked as a clerk for a plantation. In September 1930, he was transferred to Pico Island in the Azores. He was then transferred to Cape Verde, but managed to escape to Madeira. In April 1931, Castelhano participated in the Madeira uprising, which was also suppressed. He fled the island as a stowaway on board a ship, returning to Lisbon.\nUpon his return from exile, he wrote his memoirs about his years in exile. Half of the book was dedicated to analysing the material conditions of the Angolan people, and the consequences of Portuguese colonialism in the African country.  He was fiercely critical of the Portuguese Empire's claims to be carrying out a \"civilizing mission\" in Africa, which he described as having been a deceitful justification for exploitation and dehumanisation. Arguing that the so-called \"backwardness\" of African society had actually been caused by colonialism, Castelhano rejected the theses of scientific racism, which claimed that the \"inferior\" status of African people to Europeans was a result of biological determinism. He declared that it was his desire to \"undermine\" all forms of oppression, including racism; he therefore advocated for racial equality, calling for Portuguese workers to extend solidarity to African workers and establish a \"class-based unity\" across racial lines. He called for colonialism to be abolished, and instead for food and education to be provided to African workers.\nBy 1933, he had once again been elected as the general secretary of the CGT, with which he began planning the Portuguese general strike of 1934. He was arrested three days before the strike and sentenced to 16 years in exile. In September 1934, he was deported to the Fortress of São João Baptista on Terceira Island. Two years later, in October 1936, he was sent to the Tarrafal concentration camp in Cape Verde, where he died on 12 October 1940. In 1975, his book Quatro Anos de Deportação (English: Four Years of Deportation) was posthumously published in Lisbon by Seara Nova. He was posthumously awarded with the rank of Grand Officer of the Order of Liberty, on 30 June 1980. An excerpt of his memoirs was published in English, in 2017, as part of the Lusophone Anarchist Reader.\n\n\n== Selected works ==\nQuatro Anos de Deportação (1975) [1931]\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==",

        "content": "The Sheep Eaters (Finnish: Lampaansyöjät) is a 1972 Finnish comedy drama film written, produced and directed by Seppo Huunonen. It is based on the 1970 novel by the same name written by Veikko Huovinen. It tells the story of two men who decide execute the \"Operation Sheep Eaters\" they planned during the winter, with the intention of spending their summer vacation in the countryside, hunting sheeps and roasting them for \"robber's roast\". In its message, the film both parodies and admires the traditional Finnish man's longing for freedom from dreary everyday life. The film stars Heikki Kinnunen and Leo Lastumäki.\nAs a film producer, Huunonen won the best producer Jussi Award for the film. And like the original novel, the film adaptation also increased the recognition of the \"robber's roast\" recipe.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nForester Sepe (Heikki Kinnunen) and branch manager Valtteri (Leo Lastumäki) meet at the beginning of their summer vacation at the beach hotel in Kalajoki and launch the \"Operation Sheep Eaters\" they planned for the winter. They eat well and continue to celebrate with a bottle of cognac in the hotel room.\nIn the morning, they drive north through Oulu and spend the night in a travel home. They wake up at four in the morning by an innkeeper and prepare to execute their plans as the sun rises. Sepe changes the car's license plates, they find grazing sheeps and Valtteri poaching one of them by shooting. They drain the blood from the animal, chop the legs by axe with them and leave the rest of the sheep for the owner by the fence. When they go shopping, they send the host a postal address for 150 marks, which Sepe has filled out with the office machine shop's typewriter to cover their tracks. Sepe and Valtteri drive a motorboat to an island on the lake and camp. While the mutton is cooking in the cauldron, they talk about politics and drink booze. After eating, Valtteri is so drunk that he falls into the lake and refuses to come to the tent to dry off. In the morning, they cure their hangovers with new brews and prepare braised lamb.\nBefore long, the comrades get tired of their island life and go to the \"paint village\", where they go to the movies and the arcades. After spending time at the hotel in Suomutunturi, they are ready for another attack and Valtteri shoots his second sheep. This time they take the whole sheep to prepare an \"Outer Mongolian robber's roast\": they remove the entrails, fill the cavity with rice, potatoes, onions and spices and let the sheep cook in a clay crust in a stone-lined, heated pit, on top of which they build a campfire. While waiting for the roast, Sepe and Valtteri drink booze and develop their thoughts to praise the beauty of \"pussy\". The lamb turns out to be delicious, but they get tired of that too and start fantasize for the trout and fresh water of Lapland's mountain streams. A group of scantily clad German women canoeing has camped on the opposite shore. Two of them come to Sepe and Valtteri's camp and want to buy food: when the men offer their \"robber's roast\", the women back away in horror when they see the butchered sheep remains. Men turn it around so that permission saved them from the clutches of \"bad women\".\nSepe and Valtteri's journey continues further north from here. They stop by the liquor store, check their trash can left over from the previous summer at their familiar gravel pit, and continue their philosophical discussions. They decide to visit Norway to see the Arctic Ocean. On the way back, the men run over a sheep: they are afraid of the consequences of their action, knowing that Norway is part of NATO and the risk of being caught at customs is too high, so they throw the dead animal into the river. In the end, the men get drunk in the gravel pit where they've set up their tent and feel that life is back to normal.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\nDirector Huunonen makes a cameo role in the film only showing his hands washing the pot.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\nSpede Pasanen was the first person who became interested in adapting Veikko Huovinen's picaresque novel, which appeared in 1970 and quickly reached eleven editions, into a film. However, the rights were obtained by Seppo Huunonen, who worked as a producer of commercials and short films since 1966, and who in 1969 had founded his own company Filmi-Ässä Oy. The Sheep Eaters was his first feature film as both producer and director.\nThe Finnish Film Foundation granted the project a production loan of FIM 70,000, which turned into a grant after the fact, after the producer Huunonen announced that the distribution income of the film was FIM 722,000 and the production costs FIM 850,075. In the preliminary reports, the amount of production costs had been FIM 585,000, which would have required repayment of the loan.\n\n\n=== Casting ===\nActors Heikki Kinnunen and Leo Lastumäki, who had previously acted together in the 1971–72 television sketch show Ällitälli, were chosen for the roles of the film's main characters, Sepe and Valtteri.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\nThe film was shot between March and September in 1972. Filming locations have been located in different parts of Finland, including in Kalajoki, and also in Tromsø, Norway.\nAfter original cinematographer Kari Sohlberg moved to Rauni Mollberg's 1973 film The Earth Is a Sinful Song in accordance with the prior agreement, and after Heikki Katajisto, who was supposed to continue the work, got into a traffic accident, Risto Inkinen, Esko Jantunen and Pentti Auer took care of the final filming of The Sheep Eaters.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nThe film features an original soundtrack written for the film by Paroni Paakkunainen and Vexi Salmi, performed by singer Tapio Rautavaara in addition to Kinnunen and Lastumäki.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe film was premiered on November 17, 1972. The film gathered a total of 341,101 viewers, which was more than all other Finnish films of the same year combined. In Finland, it was the third most watched film after The Godfather and A Clockwork Orange.\nThe film was shown on Finnish television for the first time on April 5, 1975. During that time, the Ice Hockey World Championships match between Finland and the Soviet Union was broadcast on another channel. Despite this, the film gathered 1,147,000 viewers.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics. For example, in the premiere review, Eeva Järvenpää from Helsingin Sanomat said that she considers Kari Sohlberg's cinematography to be the best part of the film, which shows the landscapes of Northern Finland as \"beautiful as a travel film\", and she also praised the chemistry of Kinnusen and Lastumäki, a well-honed comedy couple on television, and said it was at its best when Huovinen's literary style and \"teen convention-like\" dialogue had been modified to suit the actors' mouths. However, she criticized the film's social message, or rather the lack of it: \"The Sheep Eaters is made for those people who don't worry unnecessarily, who have their own mouth first and money for their own needs. It's only good to hope that Finns will sometimes be surprised by other, perhaps more important films.\"\nPaavo Rautio, editor-in-chief of Helsingin Sanomat, wrote around the time of the 2019 TV presentation that the world has changed quite a bit in half a century; what once seemed like a harmless escape from the shackles of society by two friends longing for freedom, in the attitude climate of the late 2010s, looked completely different with its drunkenness, chauvinistic female comments and admiration of meat eating: \"When you sit on the sofa and stare at The Sheep Eaters, then alongside the work you see the current struggle for equality and a world that is less oppressive for lifestyle. And when you see it, then you have to do a reckoning with yourself: what does it say about me if I once found this production funny. That's when the smile freezes when what was intended as humor turns into the viewer's self-blame.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Finnish films of the 1970s\nThe Hair (film)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Sheep Eaters at AllMovie\nThe Sheep Eaters at IMDb",

Her works have been exhibited  internationally at Palais de Tokyo, Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, Kulte Gallery, Beirut Art Fair, Lyon Biennale, Het Nieuwe Instituut, Castlefield Gallery and West in The Hague.\n\n\n== Education ==\nSkali studied in France, first at Villa Arson in Nice and then in the post-graduate program of the École nationale supérieure des beaux-arts de Lyon. She then participated in a program at De Ateliers.\n\n\n== Oeuvre ==\nGhita Skali's oeuvre includes diverse video works which often try to see the humor in political and societal issues. Central to Skali's work are ironic inversion and myth-making, denouncing racism and sexism.\nIn September 2020, Skali provided a display at De Ateliers by cutting a hole in the wooden floor of the director's room, after which the so-called 'authority wood' was taken to Morocco to donate to people who had lost their habitat. The wood did not return to Amsterdam, in response to the flow of African art objects to Europe. She made the film The Hole's Journey about the journey of the wooden planks, which was screened at the International Film Festival Rotterdam in 2021 and acquired by the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam.\nCommissioned by the Stedelijk Museum in 2021, Skali made the short film The Invaders, a remake of a 1990s French parody of the television series The Invaders.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nGhita Skali's work is distributed by LI-MA, platform for Living Media Art. Skali's work can be found on   Mediakunst.net where museums or other cultural institutions can rent her work.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "George Spiller (December 1845, Nelson County, Virginia, USA - April 14, 1931, Jacksboro, Texas) was an American surveyor, abstractor, and insurance executive. He studied civil engineering at Virginia Military Institute (VMI) and served in the American Civil War as a part of the school's corps of cadets. After the war, he completed his education at VMI, graduating in 1866.  In the Fall of 1865 he was initiated into Alpha Tau Omega and was a founding member of the fraternity.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Reid's School ===\nGeorge Spiller attended Wm. S. Reid's school in Amherst County before matriculating at Virginia Military Institute.\n\n\n=== Virginia Military Institute ===\nGeorge Spiller matriculated at Virginia Military Institute (VMI) on January 1, 1862, from Fincastle, Virginia. His studies were interrupted by typhoid fever, causing him to lose a year, but he returned and participated in the Battle of New Market in 1863 as a cadet private in Co. A. Despite being slightly wounded, he continued at VMI and graduated on July 4, 1866, ranking ninth in his class. He was appointed a sergeant in Co. C in 1865.\n\n\n=== Alpha Tau Omega ===\nOn September 11, 1865 after the conclusion of the Civil War, Alpha Tau Omega was founded by the three founders, Otis Alan Glazebrook, Alfred Marshall and Erskin Mayo Ross.   Glazebrook and Marshall began initiating new member into the fraternity on the first day of the Fall term, October 16, 1865.   Six new members were initiated withing 10 days of the institutes opening with Spiller being the 6th initiate.   Spiller and Marshall were quite close.  After graduation 1870, Marshall contracted Yellow Fever in southern Alabama.   Spiller went to a Marshall's aid and nursed him through his entire illness.  Spiller was by Marshall's side when he passed away on September 22, 1870.   As a further testament to their strong friendship, Spiller named one of his children after Marshall.\n\n\n== Career ==\nGilmore's Mill\nAfter graduation, George Spiller's father gave him the store and mill known as \"Gilmore's Mill\" in Rockbridge Co., Va., where he was in business until May, 1870.\nMobile and Montgomery Railroad\nIn 1870, Spiller and his classmate, Alfred Marshall, worked as civil engineers for the Mobile and Montgomery Railroad in Alabama. The work was involved construction in a swampy area between Tensaw and Mobile, Al. Marshall contracted Yellow Fever shortly after arriving and passed away.\nEngineering, surveying, abstracting and insurance\nSpiller moved to Louisiana, where he worked on the Teche Division of the Southern Pacific system. He then moved to Houston, Texas, in 1871, where he worked as a civil engineer and surveyor for the Houston and Great Northern Railroad. In December 1872, Spiller relocated to Graham, Texas, where he formed the land and surveying firm of Graham, Hillard, and Spiller. Four years later, he was elected district surveyor of the Young County Land District, the first surveyor selected under the new state Texas Constitution of 1876. Spiller's district included sixteen counties, a vast expanse of land that extended from the Young County line west to New Mexico. His work included locating lands for Texas public universities. In 1881, Spiller had a short business stint in Jackson, Tennessee. He returned to Fort Worth, Texas, in 1883 and moved to Jacksboro, Texas, in 1884, where he established a successful insurance and abstract business. In 1894, he was named the official surveyor of Jack County and served in this capacity until January 1931, at which time he was succeeded by his son, Kyle Spiller. For many years in Jacksboro, he also operated the Spiller Abstract Company in conjunction with his work in the insurance business. \n\nA historically important job carried out by George Spiller was the surveying of the West Texas lands that would become part of the Permanent University Fund.  This work would prove pivitol in the development  of Texas higher education and continues to have great effect on the educational landscape of Texas. During a visit to Fort Worth, Texas in 1906, I. H. Burney said the following of Spiller.He did more surveying on the plains of Texas with his little party, 250 miles from civilization and the railroad, and among the Indians and buffaloes, than any other man in Texas. A vast amount of the grants of land made to the railroads in the early days were surveyed by him.\n\n\n=== Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association ===\nIn 1879, George Spiller married Belle Loving, the granddaughter of Oliver Loving, an historic cattle driver. Her father, James C. Loving, was a prominent rancher and one of the founding members of the Texas and Southwestern Cattle-Raisers Association . Spiller worked as an assistant secretary of the nascent association while his wife wrote the first draft of the organization's constitution and bylaws.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nGeorge Spiller, after suffering from an illness for three years, during which he became blind in the last year, George Spiller passed away on April 14, 1931. He was buried in Oakwood Cemetery. \nSpiller was survived by his wife Belle Loving-Spiller, a daughter and 8 sons several who became prominent in their own right.\n\nCarrie Belle Spiller of Santa Barbara, California\nE.

Dating back to the 13th-14th centuries, it is called \"Bashikesik \" by locals because its top is open. It has a height of 12 meters and a diameter of 5 meters.\nAfter Azerbaijan regained its independence, the mausoleum was designated as a locally significant immovable historical and cultural monument by Decision No. 132 of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Azerbaijan on August 2, 2001. Subsequently, the mausoleum was restored to its original form. Following the occupation of the Jabrayil district, the walls of the mausoleum were partially destroyed in several places. The Armenian Armed Forces used the mausoleum as an observation post.\nOn October 23, 2020, the village of Dagh Tumas, where the mausoleum is located, was liberated from occupation by the Armed Forces of Azerbaijan. When the Armenian Armed Forces withdrew from the village, they mined the surroundings of the historical monument.\n\n\n== External links ==\nThis is how the historical monument in Jabrayil was mined - APA TV\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Tzavelates or Tzavelaioi came from Dragani of Paramythia with Priest Zacho.\n\n\n== Known Members ==\nIts most famous members were Lambros Tzavelas, Fotos Tzavelas and Kitsos Tzavelas.\n\n\n=== Lambros Tzavelas ===\n\nLambros Tzavelas (1745-1792) was born in Souli and became the leader of the tribe of the Tzavelaion. In 1792 he was called by the infamous pasha of Ioannina to allegedly help him in his campaign, against Gjirokastër. Lambros and his son Fotos and 70 other Souliotes, despite the opinion of the other Souliotes, went to help Ali, but near Zitsa they caught them all and led them to Ioannina. Ali thought that if Lambros Zavelas was not the leader of the Souli, he would be able to understand it. However, his attacks were repelled with heroism and courage by the other Souliotes, so he resorted to deception. He freed Lambros from the Ioannina, holding Fotos hostage, and sent him to deliver the Souli to him. But when he arrived at Souli he wrote him the following historic letter: I am glad to have laughed at a trickster like you. I am here to crown Souli. If my son is not willing to die for the country, he is not worthy to live and be known as my son. Ali, full of anger and rage, threw himself in July 1792 against Souli with large forces. But he was defeated again and, ashamed, accepted peace and released the 70 Souliotes and Fotos. But in this battle Lambros died from his wounds.\n\n\n=== Fotos Tzavelas ===\n\nFotos Tzavelas (1770-1809) was a son of Lambros and Moscho Tzavela. After his release and the death of his father, he became the leader of the Souliotes. His fights against Ali Pasha were famous. He emerged as a great warlord and showed so much bravery that the Souliotes swore \"\"by the sword of Light\"\". Unfortunately, Souli surrendered in 1803, Fotos with 2,000 Souliotes managed to pass to Parga and from there to Corfu, which was held by the French. Fotos enlisted in the French army as a centurion of the Greek legion. In 1809 he was assassinated in Corfu by agents of Ali Pasha and was buried in the monastery of Platytera, where his tomb is preserved to this day.\n\n\n=== Moscho Tzavela ===\n\nMoscho Tzavela (1750-1803) she was the wife of Lambros Tzavelas. He was born in 1750 and fought in 1792 against Ali Pasha, in the battle of Kiafa, as the leader of 400 Souliotisses. When the Turco-Albanian tried to capture the Souliotisses, they attacked them and managed to put them to flight. The heroism of Moscho has been immortalized in folk songs. After the destruction of Souli, Moscho followed the road to Parga and from there to Eptanisa. He finally died in 1803.\n\n\n=== Zigouris Tzavelas ===\nZigouris Tzavelas he was the brother of Fotos Tzevelas. When he returned from Corfu in 1820, he fought alongside Ali Pasha against the troops of Hurshid Pasha. After the collapse of Ali and the new fall of Souli, he went down to Central Greece and took part in the Revolution at the head of the Souliotes. He was killed in the battle of Kaliakouda in Evrytania in 1823, fighting the Turks.\n\n\n=== Kitsos Tzavelas ===\n\nKitsos Tzavelas (1801-1855) he was the child of Fotos Tzavelas. He grew up in Corfu and in 1820 he returned with the Souliotes to Souli, where he was named captain at the age of just 19. He went to Pisa, Italy to confer with the Friends of the Revolution.\nHe collaborated with Karaiskakis in the victory of Ambliani in 1824. He fought at Distomo and the Onion. He broke up the troops of Reşid Mehmed Pasha in June 1825 at Missolonghi and entered the city. On March 25, 1826, he starred in the battle of Kleisova, in which, at the head of 137 fighters in the church of the Holy Trinity, they repelled the Turkish-Egyptian troops that tried to occupy the islet, causing them terrible losses (about 3,500 Ottoman dead and wounded). During the heroic exodus of the Messolongites, a leader of 2,500 men broke through the lines of the Turks and went to Salona with 1,300 men. He took part with Karaiskakis in the battles of Attica and, after the death of his partner, he was entrusted with the chief strategy temporarily. Kapodistrias made him a thousandaire. Together with Kolokotronis, during the years of the Regency, he was thrown into prison. Otto made him lieutenant general and later lieutenant general and adjutant. In 1844 he was appointed Minister of Military Affairs in the Kolettis government, in 1847-1848 Prime Minister and in 1849 Minister of Military Affairs again. He is one of the three best warriors of 1821 along with Kolokotronis and Androutsos.\n\n\n=== Giorgos Tzavelas ===\nGiorgos Tzavelas was the brother of Kitsos Tzavelas. He took part in many battles and was wounded in the second siege of Missolonghi. In the exodus of the Messolongites he was saved together with his brother Kitso. But he was killed in the military operations in Acropolis, in 1827.\n\n\n=== Nikolaos Tzavelas ===\nNikolaos Tzavelas (1881-1921) took part in the 1897 war as an officer, also in the Macedonian Struggle, the Balkan Wars and Asia Minor, where he was killed with the rank of major in the battle of Calais-Groto in 1921.\n\n\n=== Kostas Tzavelas ===\nKostas Tzavelas was a general during the Greco-Italian War of 1940. He distinguished himself in 11 victorious battles and fell on December 2, 1940, in the battle of Përmet.\n\n\n== References ==",

This institution had been founded to the debt of the state of Milan. Later on, under Napoleonic rule, the institution changed its name to Monte Napoleone, becoming the namesake for the famous street where the building stands.\nIn early 2024, the building was acquired by Kering for the record amount of 1.3 billion euros, making this the highest-value transaction ever in Italy involving a single asset.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe building stands along the luxurious and expensive Via Monte Napoleone. It features an early Neoclassical style.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Palazzo del Monte (Milan) at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "The Gasimbey Mosque is a historical architectural monument dating back to the 19th century, located in the city of Baku, Azerbaijan.\nThe mosque was included in the list of local significant immovable historical and cultural monuments by decision No. 132 of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Azerbaijan on August 2, 2001.\nAfter Azerbaijan regained its independence, the mosque resumed its activities.\n\n\n== About ==\nThe Gasimbey Mosque was constructed in Baku between 1892 and 1896. It is located at 23 Hazı Aslanov Street in the Yasamal district. The architect of the mosque is Mashadi Mirza Ghafar Ismayilov, and it was commissioned by Gasım bey.\nFollowing the Soviet occupation, official anti-religious campaigns began in 1928. In December of the same year, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan transferred many mosques, churches, and synagogues to the balance of educational clubs for secular purposes. If there were approximately 3,000 mosques in Azerbaijan in 1917, by 1927, the number decreased to 1,700, and by 1933, it was reduced to 17.\nAfter Azerbaijan regained its independence, the mosque was included in the list of local significant immovable historical and cultural monuments by decision No. 132 of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Azerbaijan on August 2, 2001. It resumed its activities in 1992. Currently, the Gasimbey Jumu'ah Mosque, registered with the state, operates as a religious community.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe total area of the mosque is 330 square meters, with an interior area of 250 square meters. It features a minaret that is 31 meters tall. The lower part of the minaret is rectangular with a width of 2.5 meters and a height of 6 meters. The minaret is constructed with oriented stones, and the lower section is adorned with triple-arched stalactites. Arabic script Quranic verses are inscribed on the lower part, and the minaret is crowned with a metal dome.\nOn the left side of the main entrance door of the mosque, there are five window openings shaped like mihrabs (prayer niches) in the wall. These windows are made of wood and are 3 meters in height. An alcove above the entrance door of the main prayer hall is intended for women. There is a wooden platform for entry into the prayer hall.\nThe prayer hall is supported by four large columns, each with a diameter of 1 meter, made of solid stone blocks connected by twelve ornamental bricks. The diameter of the dome is 6 meters, and it contains eight rectangular windows.\nBoth the dome and the bricks are adorned with intricate geometric and floral patterns. Circular Arabic script \"Shahada\" is carved on the joint part of the dome and the bricks. This inscription is repeated seven times. The mihrab is located in the central part of the mosque, with the \"Jumu'ah\" chapter inscribed on three sides of it.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTaza Pir Mosque\nAjdarbey Mosque\n\n\n== References ==",

Born in Richmond, Virginia, in 1850, Glazebrook attended the Virginia Military Institute (VMI), where he conceived the idea of establishing a fraternity that would help heal the sectional wounds inflicted by the Civil War. In 1865, alongside Alfred Marshall and Erskine Mayo Ross, he founded Alpha Tau Omega at VMI, emphasizing Christian brotherhood.After graduating from VMI in 1867, Glazebrook pursued theological studies and was ordained as an Episcopal priest. He served in various capacities within the church, including rectorships in several states and chaplaincies in educational institutions. His commitment to the church and education was evident throughout his life.\n\n\n= Contributions to Alpha Tau Omega =\nAs a founder of ATO, Glazebrook played a critical role in shaping the fraternity's principles and expanding its presence across the United States.

        "content": "The Order of the Arrow relies heavily on ceremonies and symbols. While the content of the ceremonies are secret and protected by the Order of the Arrow, the requirement to take part in these ceremonies are made publicly available by the Society.\n\n\n== Ceremonies ==\n\n\n=== Unit Election ===\nElections are held in the unit and organized by the Lodge. Members of the unit are invited to vote for those who best follow the Scout Oath and Law. Campaigning is not allowed and voting is done by secret ballot. All active members are entitled to vote and to be elected, a scout mist receive votes on at least half of the ballots submitted. Voting a blank ballot is considered voting against all the members on the ballot.\nTo be eligible for election, a youth must:\n\nbe a registered member of the Boy Scouts of America\nhave spent at least 15 days and nights camping within the last two years including one long-term camp consisting of at least five consecutive nights\nbe under the age of 21\nhold the Scouts BSA First Class rank, the Venturing Discovery Award, or the Sea Scout Ordinary rank or higher, be approved by their unit leader and be elected by the youth members of their unit.\nAdults aged 21 or older may be nominated after meeting the camping requirements and being approved by the lodge adult selection committee.\n\n\n=== Call-Out or Tapout ===\n\nPrior to Indiction, a Call-Out Ceremony (also known as tapout) takes place. This is a public ceremony that officially recognizes scouts that have been elected to be candidates for membership in the Order of the Arrow. This is an opportunity for the Lodges who organize it to present the OA to all the scouts present, its history, recognize the candidates and challenge the scouts who are not elected to strive to uphold the Scouting ideals with the hope of one day being selected. This ceremony is usually short, impressive and is made to allow all present to understand the importance of the Order of the Arrow membership.\n\n\n=== Induction (Ordeal) ===\n\nAfter being elected or nominated, candidates may participate in a call-out ceremony to recognize those Scouts and Scouters that were selected before they attend their Ordeal. The call-out ceremony may be performed at summer camp, a camporee, a call-out weekend or at a unit meeting. Candidates subsequently participate in the induction ceremony called the Ordeal, intended to emphasize service and selflessness. During the induction, \"candidates maintain complete silence, receive small amounts of food, work on camp improvement projects, and are required to sleep alone, apart from other campers, which teaches significant values.\" If they succeed in their ordeal the candidates are then welcomed as Ordeal members in a formal Ordeal Ceremony.\n\n\n=== Brotherhood ===\nOrdeal members are entitled to all the same rights and privileges of membership in the Order as Brotherhood and Vigil Honor members—there are no ranks within the Order. However, moving on to Brotherhood membership offers an opportunity to reaffirm one's commitment to the Order. Arrowmen may \"seal\" their membership after six months by demonstrating their knowledge of the traditions and obligations of the OA. They then participate in an induction ceremony and become Brotherhood members.\nWhile the Ordeal consists primarily of physical impressions, \"the Brotherhood ceremony is one of the deeper and quieter mental impressions.\"\n\n\n=== Vigil Honor ===\n\nThe Vigil Honor is a recognition given to Arrowmen for distinguished contributions beyond the immediate responsibilities of their position or office to their lodge, the Order of the Arrow, Scouting, or their Scout Camp. The Vigil Honor may be conferred upon Arrowmen who have completed a minimum of two years as a Brotherhood member and have performed exceptional service above and beyond their immediate responsibilities through leadership, exemplary efforts, and dedication. However, under no circumstances should tenure in Scouting or the Order of the Arrow be considered as reason enough for a Vigil Honor recommendation. Selection is annual and is limited to one person for every 50 members of the lodge, and members of the Order can be inducted into the Vigil Honor only with the written approval of the National Order of the Arrow Committee.\nAs a part of the Vigil Honor induction, each new Vigil Honor member is given a Vigil Honor name in the language of the Lenni Lenape or the language of their local Lodge. An English translation of the Vigil Honor name is also provided, and the name often represents a characteristic of the individual.\n\nOrder of the Arrow ceremonies were once considered to be secret, and consequently, the OA has been viewed by some as a secret society. With the introduction of Youth Protection program guidelines in 1980s, the BSA has made clear that any concerned parent, guardian, or religious leader may view a video of the ceremonies, attend meetings, or read ceremonial texts upon request to a council, district, lodge, or chapter official to assure themselves that there is nothing objectionable. Such persons are asked to safeguard (conceal) the details relating to ceremonies for the sake of the participants. The intent of the provision for parents and religious leaders to be allowed access to ceremonies is to ensure that there is no religious conflict or violations of youth protection guidelines occurring. Parents have long been discouraged in many Lodges from seizing the opportunity to use the provision for photo opportunities with their sons, and some lodges have instituted bans on photography during the ceremonies. Hazing or demeaning initiation pranks are also prohibited by the OA and the BSA.\n\n\n=== Paper Copies ===\nThere is no known written copy of the ritual used for the 1915 Treasure Island camping season. However, a few details are known, based on later testimonies. The first inductees were Robert Craig and Gilpin Allen who were inducted on July 16, 2015, and wore a black sash for the ceremony. E. Urner Goodman wore a black robe (similar to a graduation gown) with triangular badges on it with a black tortoise superimposed on the white triangle. He was the Chief of the Fire. Carroll Edson also wore a black robe similar to Goodman's with a white tortoise shaped badge on his chest. He was the Sachem. Harry A. Yoder, a staffer who had assisted in the construction of the fire guided the entire camp to the new campfire circle. He was however not a ceremonialist in the Frist Ceremony.\nThe first written Ordeal Ceremony was written in 1921 along with the formation of the Grand Lodge. It was mimeographed on Letter size paper and distributed to the Supreme Chief of the Fire of each member lodge. Some changes were also introduced there:\n\nWater was to be applied to the left bared breast to symbolize the cleansing of the candidate from selfishness and evil\nA root-stock was to be chewed to symbolize the increase in strength and vigor to be used in the service of others.\nThe format was changed in 1927. It became a 24 pages 5\"x7\" booklet folded vertically. This format remained in place until 1998 when it was changed to an 8 1/2 x 11 booklet. In the booklet, the Pre-Ordeal Ceremony and the Ordeal Ceremony could be found along with the Legend in poetic form. The Brotherhood Ceremony was made in a booklet only in 1936 remaining a mimeographed document until then.\nIn the 2015 Edition of the Order of the Arrow Handbook, it is mentioned that non-members of the Order of the Arrow should not attend ceremonies but that it recognizes and respects the right of adults such as parents, Scout leaders or religious leader to have questions about the ceremony. The lodge adviser or his representative can discuss the content of the ceremony and concernes brought by the adult enquiring and that the adult will maintain the confidentiality of the ceremony. If questions remain unanswered, the adult will be permitted to read the text of the ceremony. Parents are allowed to refuse that their child take part in the ceremony and therefore that they join the Order of the Arrow.\nThe ceremonies utilize symbolic settings, rites, and principles to convey various Scouting ideals to participants. \"The values of the Order of the Arrow, 'a brotherhood of cheerful service,' were passed on during a night-time ceremony: an arrowhead outlined with stones on the ground, candles on the stones, a huge bonfire at the base of the arrowhead, and at the point of the arrow a lectern from which was read, and danced, the story of heroic sacrifice for others.\"\n\n\n== Symbols ==\n\n\n=== Degree/Honor Symbols ===\n\n\n==== White Sash ====\n\n\n===== Evolution =====\nOriginally, the Sashes were called arrow bands. These bands were described as being in the original ceremony a black band with a white vertical stripe on the front made of the same material as black academic robes based on testimonies of early members. In the Ritual of the Second Degree (published around 1918 by Dr. William Hinkle), the band was moved from the right shoulder to the left shoulder right before the end of the ceremony. The same band was worn by First Degree (Ordeal) and Second Degree (Brotherhood) but on different shoulders. The earliest photographic evidence from 1919 from Treasure Island confirms that the bands were worn on both shoulders. No original sashes are known to exist today. This information comes from two testimonies from early members. According to Harry Yoder, the first guide and charter member of the Order wrote in 1921: \"In the early days of the Order the members wore a black sash with a white stripe running lengthwise instead of the white band with the red arrow.\" George Chapman recounted in the unpublished work The Arrow and the Vigil (1953): \"As has been previously mentioned, the officers of Wimachtendienk wore black robes for the induction ceremony. Members wore a black sash with a white arrow on it, very similar to the sash worn today except for the color.\"\n\nA black and white picture published in August 1921 in a Philadelphia newspaper on the Wimachtendienk shows the officers wearing black robes with a white band and a dark-colored arrow on top. It is unclear if that arrow was black or red. In 1921, when the Grand Lodge was formed, a picture was also taken showing members wearing the band on both left and right shoulder. It also shows Goodman and Edson wearing a sash in the shape of a triangle on the chest that appears to be a fraternal bib. This was the Third Degree bib-type sash. The first known physical examples of the white sash with a red arrow dates back from around 1922. First Degree and Second Degree had a white wool-felt band with red wool-felt arrows sewn on it. The Vigil Honor had a white wool-felt band without an arrow and a red Vigil triangle with arrows on each side. These were made by the Grand Lodge and remained mainly unchanged from 1921 to 1948. Region 7 however used bands made of twill cloth with arrows in red linen from the late 1920s to the mid-1930s.\n\nIn 1948, the Order retained the white wool-felt for the band but the red arrow was flocked silk-screened on it. The Vigil Honor had a large red wool-felt triangle with the white arrows silk-screened. In 1950, it was decided that the sash would go on the right shoulder only. The sash changed again: Brotherhood bars were flocked onto the sashed to distinguish Ordeal from Brotherhood. In 1951/1952, the Vigil oversized triangle was replaced by a small triangle. All the sashes used the same silk-screening process and were all the same size.\nIn 1955, the wool-felt was replaced with twill material and the silk-screen was replaced by embroidery. The Sash had two plies of material so the embroidery did not show through. Over the years, the stitching on the edge evolved but the sash remained the same. The arrows on the Vigil Honor triangle were manufactured both counterclockwise as well as clockwise. In 1988, the arrows and other red symbols were hot ironed on the sash. This was short lived as the sashes did not survive the wash and by 1990, the sashes were embroidered again. It has remained unchanged to this day.\n\n\n==== Today ====\nAt formal events or Order of the Arrow functions, Arrowmen can be readily identified by a white sash bearing a red arrow that is worn over their right shoulder. An Ordeal member wears a sash with a lone arrow. The Brotherhood member wears a sash bearing an arrow with a red bar at each end of the arrow. A Vigil Honor member wears a sash with the same bars of as the Brotherhood sash at each end of the arrow, and a Vigil Honor triangle on the center of the shaft. The OA sash is not worn at the same time as the merit badge sash, nor worn folded in the belt. The sash as a form of recognition dates to the founding of the Order and has a long history of changes in usage and design.\nIt is not to be worn at Troop Meetings, Campouts, Courts of Honor, Training and FOS Presentations as it is a symbol of the OA ideal, not a rank of an item to \"show off\" your honor. It is appropriate to wear it at events where OA business is taking place such as Unit Election, Lodge Fellowship, Lodge Meetings, etc.\n\n\n==== Ribbon ====\n\nThe early pins were replaced by the ribbon. However, the ribbon does not indicate the Honor of the wearer, only the membership to the OA and only the sash references the Honor today.\nOrder members may choose to wear the OA Universal Ribbon also known as \"Dangles\" suspended from the right uniform shirt pocket button.\nThe Ribbon was introduced in 1942. This was the first time Arrowmen could officially wear the OA symbol. It was very similar to the current version and was made of red and white silk with a sterling arrow. The first arrows pointed left instead of right, pointing left over the wearer's shoulder. In 1950, the OA removed the code words referencing \"left\" and replaced it with \"right\". In 1952, the ribbon also switched to point over the wearer's right shoulder.\nAdditional award pins can be attached to the ribbon including the Order of the Arrow 75th Anniversary Achievement from 1990 and the Order of the Arrow Arrowman Service Award Ribbon Pin issued between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2003.\n\n\n==== Other Symbolism ====\nArrowmen also exchange a special handshake as a token of brotherhood, along with other signs and passwords. A signature acronym, WWW (Wimachtendienk Wingolauchsik Witahemui – Brotherhood of Cheerful Service), is often depicted in publications, regalia, etc.\n\n\n=== Lodge Symbols ===\n\n\n==== Totem Pins ====\nSince the Order of the Arrow was founded as a fraternal organization, it followed similar traditions similar to its counterparts. These organizations often used small pins made of precious metals as insignias. In Article III of the first constitution of the Order of the Arrow from 1916, three recognition pieces are described:\n\na silver arrow pledge for candidates (now Ordeal)*\na gold tortoise and arrow pin for First Degree (now Brotherhood)*\na gold tortoise and triangle for Second Degree (now Vigil)*\n*The Ordeal in 1916 was considered a pledge and not a full membership. Therefore, there were only two degrees.\nThe pledge (Ordeal) pin is almost identical to the silver arrow pin still found today except it is now die-struck as opposed to poured into a die.\nThese pins were mandatory in the beginning of the order. However, due to the cost of the silver and gold used in their manufacturing, these pins were not always manufactured by the Lodges. The pins were made by several jewelers over the years. The use of pins became optional. These pins were not to be worn on the sash or on the BSA uniform but only on civilian clothes.\nThe Grand Lodge Insignia Committee required that each lodge have its own distinct totem in a similar way as the heraldry rule that no two coats of arms can be the same. The idea was that members could determine the status and local affiliation of another member just by looking at their pin while non-members would be clueless of the meaning of the pin. By 1930, the requirement for each Lodge to have its own totem became impractical due to the number of Lodges being created.\nThese were the ancestors of the current Lodge Pocket Flap Patches. These pins were used along with the Ribbon after it was introduced in 1942. Some lodges still make these pins but they are rare.\n\n\n==== Lodge Pocket Flaps Patches ====\n\nIn a 1938 National Meeting at Camp Irondale, Missouri, shows several arrowmen wearing lodges patches of different shapes. These patches were a deviation from the national uniform standard at the time. However, this practice would become mainstream and official. It would replace the Early Lodge Pins. Indeed, a pin could cost upward of $4.50 while a lodge patch could be purchased for 20 cents. Finally, in 1945, the BSA Uniform Committee agreed to the use of the Lodge Patch. However, it was omitted from the 1948 Order of the Arrow Handbook. The use of the lodge patch was advocated in the handbook but it did not indicate that it had to be worn on the right pocket. As a result, each lodge had its own way of placing the patches. It was the Ajapeu Lodge in Doylstown, PA around 1942 that had the right shirt pocket flap as the OA location.\nIt took until 1954 for the national OA committee finally offered clarification with the following decision:\n\"It is strongly recommended by the National Committee that these emblems be made to fit the shape of the right shirt pocket flap. The right shirt pocket flap has been approved by the National Committee on Badges and Insignia for official Order of the Arrow Insignia where the other emblems are only temporary insignia when used on the uniform. It should be realized that this is a great advantage and a complement to the Order of the Arrow.\"\nOA membership and Lodge affiliation are indicated by the wearing of the lodge emblem (commonly known as a lodge flap), an embroidered patch is worn on the right pocket flap of the uniform shirt. Each lodge flap has a unique design, generally reflecting the name, geography or history of the lodge. Part of this is a totem that represents the lodge. The flap was officially approved by the National Committee in 1954. No other organization has received the honor from Boy Scouts of America to have a portion of the uniform reserved for their own use. Special issues of flaps are created to commemorate anniversaries and other events, and are a popular item for those who engage in Scouting memorabilia collecting.\nThe Lodge Flap has over time grown and today many Lodge Flaps are actually two patches: one for the flap and one for the pocket itself. Since 2007 with Operations Update 07–8, Lodges can not create flaps that are larger than the flap itself. The two part sets comply with the guidelines if they are made of two separate pieces, the two parts can be worn independently from one another and the flap patch stays within the boundaries of the pocket flap.\n\n\n=== National Bonnets ===\nIn 1938, a bonnet made was made by members of the Anicus Lodge of Golden eagle feathers in the fashion of a Native American War bonnet. It was gifted to the National Lodge of the OA in 1940 to be worn by the chief of the National Lodge. It would be used for over 40 years for the opening and closing shows of NOAC as well as National Planning Meetings and other national events.\nSince 1918 with the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the Federal Government had started protected birds and slowly restricting the use of some bird feathers and other body parts. In 1940, the Bald Eagle Protection Act was past protecting Bald Eagles exclusively. This Act would be extended to the Golden Eagle in 1962. This is law is enforced by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). On January 1, 1976, with the encouragement of the USFWS the National OA Committee issued its \"Protected Feather Clarification\" policy prohibited the use of animal parts in the construction of Native American regalia used at Scouting events. The USFWS made an allowance for the use of the bonnet and it continued to be used after that date.\nIn November 1980, a fire destroyed BSA's National Office where the bonnet was on display and it was destroyed. The National OA Committee announced it would construct two replacement bonnets. For the first time, the national vice chief would also wear a bonnet. Various options were proposed to complete this while also complying with the Law. Eventually, the solution came from the USFWS itself. After confirming that the original bonnet was made of real eagle feathers obtained prior to the enactment of the laws, approval was granted to replace the original bonnet with two bonnets. Each was made of 32 real golden eagle feathers tipped with owl feathers provided by the USFWS. The feathers came from illegal bonnets confiscated by USFWS and were offered to BSA/OA by the Federal agency via a special permit/loan agreement for scientific and educational purposes. The replacement were first starting in 1982 and used until 2004.\nIn keeping with its policy on Protected Feathers, the bonnets were retired and replaced with new replica bonnets using imitation eagle feathers. These bonnets were first used in 2005.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External Links ==\nOrder of the Arrow Official Website",

        "content": "The Ellwood-Zimmerman House was an iconic mid-century modern house designed by Craig Ellwood built in Brentwood, Los Angeles, California in 1950. It was demolished, to much criticism, in 2024.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Zimmerman House was a low-slung, 2,770 square-foot, five-bedroom, three bathroom home. The non-profit group, USModernist, states that Martin and Eva Zimmerman commissioned the home in 1949.  The Zimmerman's sold the home to Richard Kelton in 1968, following that it was sold in 1975 to Hilda and Sam Rolfe for $205,000.\nIn 2022, the home was purchased for $12.5 million by actor, Chris Pratt and his wife Katherine Schwarzenegger who had it bulldozed to make way to build a 15,000 square foot mansion. The destruction of the home has been viewed as a systemic problem where older mid-century homes of significant historic value are seen as less valuable than the plot of land they occupy.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Zimmerman House was an early work by Ellwood. The Zimmerman House was exemplary of the California modernist style indicative of Ellwood, and other architects of the time such as Charles and Ray Eames, Pierre Koenig and Richard Neutra. Garrett Eckbo designed the home's garden which was also destroyed.\nThe one-story home was known for it's light-filled openness, featuring many sliding glass doors that provided views and passage into the garden. Similar to Ellwood's, Lappin House, the home was designed and arranged with a spine corridor, and featured a free-standing centrally-located brick fireplace that separated the living room area from the dining room, similar to Case Study House 9 designed by Charles Eames and Eero Saarinen. Progressive Architecture magazine published a feature story on the home, and was considered a \"showpiece\" that was featured in other architectural magazines as well. The home was located at 400 North Carmelina Avenue in the Brentwood neighborhood. The Los Angeles Conservancy stated that at the time of demolition, the home was \"highly intact and a noteworthy example of modernist design from this era.\" The façade of the structure featured recessed glazing creating a space, as described by Progressive Architecture as \"completely open to the lawn and vistas to the rear.\" Arts & Archtecture magazine described the façade as \"four ten-foot glass doors, each sliding, open (to the) living-dining area to the terrace of textured concrete which leads to the plant garden. The bedrooms alternate on either side of the spine.\nThe home was described by Ellwood's daughter, Erin Ellwood, an Ojai, California-based interior designer, as a \"time capsule.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nErin Ellwood, Michael Boyd.

        "content": "The Dapaong Solar Power Station is a planned 25 megawatts solar power plant in Togo. In April 2024, the Government of Togo announced an international tender for qualified international firms and consortia to submit bids of expression of interest in the design, procurement and installation of a 25 MW solar power plant, with attached battery storage power station (BESS) storage of 40MWh. The tender closes on 4 June 2024.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe power station would be located in the town of Dapaong, the capital city of Savanes Region, in the extreme north of the country, near the international border with Burkina Faso. Dapaong is located approximately 613 kilometres (381 mi), north of the central business district of the city of Lome, the national capital and the country's largest city.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nBefore 2024, a larger solar farm with generation capacity of 30 MW was envisaged. The successful EPC bidder will design a 25 MW solar photovoltaic plant with an attached 40 MWh BESS and a connected transmission and distribution network. The electricity is intended for distribution to about 60 locations in Savanes Region, servicing 600,000 to 700,000 Togolese customers.\n\n\n== Other considerations ==\nThe construction of this solar farm is part of a World Bank-supported regional energy infrastructure development project. The US$311 million \"Regional Emergency Solar Power Intervention Project\" (RESPITE), covers the countries of Sierra Leone, Chad, Liberia, and Togo. It is also part of Togo's national program \"Emergency Resilience Building Program in the Savanes Region\" (PURS).\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of power stations in Togo\nBlitta Solar Power Station\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPower plant profile: Dapaong Solar PV Park, Togo",

        "content": "Antisemitism in Columbia University was prevalent in the first half of the 20th century and resurged in the early 21st century. In 1920 Columbia University was the first American university to initiate quotas on Jews, halving the Jewish student population in two years. In the early 21st century and acutely after the October 7 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel, students and staff protests and commentary were criticized as antisemitic and scrutinized by the US Congress, which opened an investigation on Columbia University. In April 2024, Columbia University President Minouche Shafik condemned antisemitic acts by students and faculty in campus and said the university was in a \"moral crisis\". United States president Joe Biden and the mayor of New York, Eric Adams condemned the 2024 anti-Israel protests as antisemitic and condemned the calls for violence and harassment against Jews.  \n\n\n== 20th century ==\nDuring the 20th century American anti-Jewish sentiment was common in America, and American universities imposed quotas on Jews in order to restrict the number of Jews in universities. Such efforts first began in Columbia University. New York City, in which Columbia University is situated in the early 20th century had a population that was. In 1920, Columbia University had a 40% Jewish enrollment rate according to Oliver Pollak.\nSince most Jewish students at the time were came from poor families they had to work night jobs in order to pay their tuition and also lived at home to save money. Therefore, Columbia required students to live in dormitories in campus as well as limiting scholarships in order to limit the number of Jewish students who could afford to study in the university. Columbia also began to conduct interviews in admissions process and according to Mark Oppenheimer university representatives detected accents or telling signs of Jewish origin if the name of the applicant wasn't clearly Jewish. According to Nadell, elite Protestants students began to abandon Columbia due to its changing culture, after the initiation of the program Columbia halved the number of Jewish students within two years (1920–22).\nIn the early 20th century some school administrators held anti-Jewish beliefs which rationalized by them and that their sentiment was based on social reality. In 1903, dean of Columbia wrote that “What most people regard as a racial problem is really a social problem.”.\n\n\n== 21st century ==\n\nFollowing the October 7 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel, Joseph Massad a Columbia University professor in Middle Eastern, South Asian and African studies said that the attack on Israel, in which 1200 Israelis were killed including civilians, was a \"resistance offensive\" and \"awesome\". President Shafik condemned his comment in April 2024 and said he was under investigation, also saying Massad no longer has a leadership role in the university. InsideHigherEd reported however that in the 2024-24 Academic year Massad chaired an academic review panel in the college of the arts and sciences.\nFollowing the October 7 attack, Mohamed Abdou, a visiting scholar who had said that he sides with Hamas and Islamic Jihad was hired by the university. In April 2024, President Minouche Shafik said Abdou was on his way out of the university.\nKatherine Franke a professor of law in Columbia said that all students who have served in the IDF are dangerous and shouldn't be allowed on campus.\nA task force on antisemitism was created by the university in late 2023.  \nThe university was sued by Jewish students which said that in the university “mobs of pro-Hamas students and faculty march by the hundreds shouting vile antisemitic slogans, including calls to genocide.”\nIn a hearing before Congress in April 2024, Columbia University president Minouche Shafik condemned antisemitism and said that \"from the river to the sea\" is antisemitic. Professors in the university were under investigation according to the president for antisemitic remarks. Shafik said that dozens of students were disciplined and that Columbia University is in a \"moral crisis\".\nDuring anti-Israel protests, some students called for intifada and urged Hamas brigades to kill Israeli soldiers. Additionally, there were calls to burn Tel Aviv, a major Israeli city known for its liberal culture. Anti-Israel activists sang songs in support of Hamas and chanted slogans expressing solidarity with the organization. The Palestine Solidarity Working Group defended militancy and praised Hamas's attacks against Israel. Anti-Israel protestors also made derogatory remarks towards Jewish students, telling them to \"Go back to Europe\" and taunting them with calls of \"Jews\" and \"Go back to Poland\".\nJewish students reported feeling unsafe, being spat on, and expressed relief at leaving the university. They felt their grievances were not adequately represented by student representatives. One protestor threatened Jewish students, stating, \"The 7th of October is going to be every day for you!\". Some of the anti-Israel protestors also chanted \"From the water to the war (a reference to the Jordan river and the Mediterranean), Palestine is Arab\" which is considered a call for the cleansing of the region from Jews and the denial of Jewish rights for self sovereignty in their ancestral homeland.\nJournalist Seth Mandel argued that universities were promoting the idea that Jews should be displaced from their homes because they belong to a race that supposedly belongs elsewhere, citing incidents at Columbia University as an example. The Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) and the Workers Organizing for Liberation (WOL) both advocated for the destruction of Israel and the targeting of Jewish Israelis, and played a role in organizing the protests at Columbia University.\nThe President of the United States, Joe Biden condemned the protests saying “Even in recent days, we’ve seen harassment and calls for violence against Jews. This blatant antisemitism is reprehensible and dangerous – and it has absolutely no place on college campuses, or anywhere in our country.”\nThe protestors responded by saying they were peaceful and distanced themselves from non student protestors.  The mayor of New York said he was “horrified and disgusted with the antisemitism being spewed at and around the Columbia University campus.” And increased police presence around campus.\nShai Davidai, a prominent Israeli Jewish professor in Columbia University was barred from entering the main campus. Davidai is a supporter of Jewish students rights on US campuses,. Columbia University's COO said this was done to maintain community safety. Davidai wrote on X formerly known as Twitter \"To the best of my knowledge, the last time that a professor was denied access to their own university for being Jewish was Nazi Germany\". Davidai also said that Columbia University could not allow him to enter because they could not protect his safety as a Jewish professor. Davidai accused the university of being unable to stand up against anti-Israel protestors which had been condemned as antisemitic by US president Joe Biden; Davidai called the anti-Israel protest a \"Pro-Hamas mob\".\nFollowing the incident, Robert Kraft, owner of the \"patriots\" team said he would stop donating to the university due to its inability to keep Jewish students safe and was saddened by the hatred growing in campus and the country.\nDue to the intensity of anti-Israel protests, Columbia University allowed students to take classes and exams virtually.  Rep. Virginia Foxx, chair of the United States House Committee on Education and the Workforce, warned Columbia University that the failure of Columbia to ensure safety was In violation of the university's Title VI obligations, on which is conditioned federal assistance to the university. \nRabbi Elie Buechler who is linked to Columbia University's Orthodox Union Jewish Learning Initiative urged Jewish students to remain home or return home due to safety concerns.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAntisemitism in US Higher Education\n\n\n== References ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Qatari influence in Europe refers to Qatar's efforts to influence the culture and policies of European countries. This influence is achieved through strategic investments, lobbying, academic and cultural initiatives, and a prominent presence in European sports, primarily financed by the wealth of the royal family. These activities have been pioneered under the leadership of Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, gradually increasing Qatar's power as part of a broader strategy to diversify their influence.\nQatar's ownership of Al Jazeera has given it a powerful tool to influence public opinion in Europe and beyond. The network's coverage of global events, including those in the Middle East, has been both praised for its breadth and criticized for perceived biases, promotion of Islamist positions, and inciting terrorism. Qatar has been depicted as pursuing an Islamist agenda in its foreign policy, especially following the Arab Spring. Critics argue that Qatar's investments and cultural initiatives are part of a broader agenda to extend its influence and potentially spread its ideological views.\nQatar has a substantial involvement in European sports, and the country is integrated in many aspects of the sports value chain. This involvement has been described as a form of \"sportswashing,\" a strategy aimed at enhancing its global image through sports. Qatar's strategy differs from historical examples from Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, who also used mega-events to showcase national strength, by focusing instead on sports commentary, partnerships with major brands, and ownership of local sports clubs to enhance its influence.\nQatar's involvement in Europe has sparked controversy, marked by allegations of corruption and influence-peddling. Incidents such as \"Qatargate\" have emerged, along with accusations of financing and providing political cover for groups like Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). In addition, Numerous sources accused Qatar of allocating millions of dollars to Muslim Brotherhood activities in Europe and financially supporting the Muslim Brotherhood in France, the United Kingdom, Italy and Denmark, with more than $175 million over the years. According to European statistical data, “Qatar Charity is one of the main supporters of Islamic groups in Europe, donating money to 60% of Islamic institutions, including charities, relief programmes, Quranic schools and mosques”.\n\n\n== Background ==\nQatar's relations with Europe traces back to the early 20th century. The initial contact between Qatar and European countries were primarily driven by trade, with the Gulf region serving as a crucial node in the maritime routes connecting the East and the West. During the colonial era, European powers, notably the British Empire, established protectorates across the Middle East. In the case of Qatar, it became a British protectorate in the early 20th century. This period laid the groundwork for modern statehood in Qatar and introduced European political and legal systems, albeit in a context of external control and influence.\nThe discovery of oil in Qatar in 1940, followed by the development of its vast natural gas reserves in the latter half of the 20th century, marked a turning point in Qatar's international relations. Europe's growing energy needs led to increased engagement with Qatar, which quickly transformed into one of the world's leading exporters of liquefied natural gas (LNG).\nQatar gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1971. In the decades that followed, Qatar leveraged its hydrocarbon resources to develop its economy, gradually increasing its global presence and influence, including in Europe. This led to significant Qatari investments in Europe across various sectors, including finance, real estate, sports, and media. Such investments were not only economic in nature but also served to forge strategic alliances and enhance Qatar's influence on the global stage.\nThe establishment of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in 1981, which includes Qatar and other Gulf nations, provided a new framework for regional cooperation and interaction with external partners, including the European Union (EU). In 2018, the EU-Qatar Cooperation Arrangement was signed, providing a structured framework for political dialogue and sectoral cooperation.\nEducation City in Qatar was established in 1997 by the Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development. This initiative was part of a vision to enhance education and research in the region, promoting Qatar's development into a hub for academic excellence on an international scale. Universities from the UK, France and the Netherland opened campuses in Qatar, offering programs in fields ranging from museum studies to business administration. These institutions attract students from around the world, leveraging Qatar's stature and its investments in education to serve as a bridge between Western and Eastern educational practices. The involvement of European schools in Qatar has not been without controversy. For example, UCL became the first British university to open a campus in ‘Education City’ in 2012. But in 2014, Dame Nicola Brewer, UCL's International Vice-Provost, said that the university should reevaluate its engagements in Qatar, taking into account the new political circumstances. This was in response to the transition of power in 2013, where Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad became the Emir.\nIn 2005, the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), was established by the Qatari government as a sovereign wealth fund. Its primary purpose is to manage the surplus revenue from Qatar's oil and natural gas exports. The creation of the QIA was part of a broader strategy to diversify Qatar's economy away from its traditional reliance on hydrocarbon sectors. The QIA was endowed with a large amount of capital to invest internationally. This fund quickly grew in size, becoming one of the world's largest sovereign wealth funds, with assets worth hundreds of billions of dollars and major investments in European markets, including real estate purchases and stakes in key industries.\nIn 2017, a blockade on Qatar was initiated by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt, who severed diplomatic and trade ties with Qatar. These nations accused Qatar of supporting terrorism, particularly pointing to its alleged backing of groups like the Muslim Brotherhood and its perceived close relations with Iran. They also criticized Qatar's independent foreign policy and the influential role of its global media outlet, Al Jazeera. In response, Qatar denied the allegations, asserting its commitment to fighting terrorism and sought to bolster its own economic independence and diplomatic ties. The blockade on Qatar was lifted in January 2021.\nIn the wake of the Qatar diplomatic crisis, Qatar faced a complex geopolitical challenge when US President Donald Trump appeared to support the blockade against them. Recognizing the potential vulnerability, Qatar perceived a need to diversify its international alliances and reduce its geopolitical risk. Thus, Qatar turned its focus towards Europe, aiming to cultivate deeper ties with influential European nations such as the UK, France, and Germany.\nEconomic investments were central to Qatar's approach to strengthen ties with European nations. The QIA had already been actively investing in significant European sectors such as automotive, construction, and finance. For example, major companies like Volkswagen and Siemens, reflecting a longstanding economic relationship that was further solidified during the crisis. In addition, Qatar increased its role in Europe's energy security, becoming a crucial supplier of LNG to several European countries, thus embedding itself as a key player in Europe's energy landscape. These strategic moves not only diversified Qatar's international relations but also enhanced its economic security and political leverage in Europe.\n\n\n== Economic Influence ==\n\nQatar's economic influence has been both broad and significant, reflecting a strategic approach to diversify its investment portfolio beyond the traditional energy sector, reflecting the Gulf state's strategic deployment of its considerable financial resources to achieve both economic growth and geopolitical power. These investments span various industries, including finance, real estate, sports, and technology, and have had a considerable impact on the economic ties between Qatar and European countries. Qatar has been accused of leveraging its economic resources to expand its influence on the global stage.\n\n\n=== Energy sector ===\nQatar's initial engagement with the European market commenced in the energy sector, where it utilized its substantial natural gas reserves to establish itself as a significant player. The country secured long-term contracts to supply liquefied natural gas (LNG) to various European countries, which became foundational to its economic and diplomatic relations with Europe. This strategic use of energy reserves not only fostered economic benefits but also served as an instrument of diplomatic influence, embedding Qatar within the European energy discourse and affecting security and policy deliberations among EU member states.\nA principal aspect of Qatar's influence in the European energy sector is its role as a major LNG exporter. Qatar has become a critical supplier of NLG to the European market, which has been increasingly seeking cleaner energy alternatives. Qatar's exports to Europe are managed through long-term contracts and adaptable supply agreements, ensuring a reliable and diversified energy source for European countries. For example, QatarEnergy signed long-term agreements with ConocoPhillips for LNG deliveries to Germany.\nBeyond LNG exports, Qatar has entered into several strategic partnerships with European energy companies and governments. These partnerships often involve joint ventures, technological exchanges, and collaborative projects aimed at enhancing energy efficiency, exploring renewable energy opportunities, and developing new gas fields. Through these collaborations, Qatar seeks to solidify its position as a key player in Europe's energy landscape while supporting the continent's energy transition goals.\nQatar's investment in Europe extends to critical energy infrastructure, including terminals for LNG reception, storage facilities, and pipelines. These investments are crucial for ensuring the efficient transportation and distribution of natural gas across the continent. By investing in energy infrastructure, Qatar not only secures its export routes but also contributes to the development of a more integrated and resilient European energy network. Qatar currently exports about one-third of its LNG to Europe, with the United Kingdom, Belgium, Italy, and France also receiving significant volumes.\n\n\n=== Real estate ===\nOne of the most visible aspects of Qatar's investments in Europe is in the real estate sector. QIA has acquired significant assets in major European cities. One of the most visible indicators of Qatar's presence in the European real estate market is its acquisition of iconic properties and luxury real estate. In London, Qatar's investment portfolio includes prestigious landmarks such as The Shard, Europe's tallest skyscraper, and the Harrods department store, one of the world's most famous luxury shopping destinations. Similarly, in Paris, Qatar owns significant stakes in luxury hotels and historic buildings, underscoring its interest in high-value, high-profile real estate assets.\nAn analysis revealed that the number of properties in London owned by individuals from Qatar increased by nearly 50% from 2018 to 2021, comprising 21.5 percent of all London properties held by Qatari buyers. Qatar's real estate investments in Europe have significant economic and political implications. Economically, these investments contribute to the development and dynamism of the European real estate market, bringing in capital and potentially driving up property values. Politically, the investments can be seen as part of Qatar's broader strategy to forge strong bilateral relations with key European nations, using economic ties to enhance diplomatic and strategic partnerships. Critics argue that significant foreign investments in strategic sectors or iconic properties could give countries like Qatar undue influence over local markets and policies.\n\n\n=== Strategic Investments ===\nOne of the emerging focal points of Qatari investment in Europe is the biotech and technology sectors. Recognizing the potential for high returns and the strategic importance of innovation, the QIA has been actively positioning itself within the European biotech ecosystem. This includes investments in cutting-edge research and development projects that promise to drive advancements in healthcare, renewable energy, and digital technologies.\nFrance and Germany rank as the second and third largest recipients of Qatari investments in Europe, with an estimate of $27 billion and $24 billion. In France, similar to its investment strategy in the UK, Qatar has acquired significant holdings in luxury real estate in Paris and has taken equity positions in a diverse array of leading French companies. These include Lagardère, a major media group; TotalEnergies, an oil giant; EADS, an aerospace conglomerate; Veolia, a utility firm; Areva, a nuclear power producer;Accor, a leading hospitality group, and more. In Germany, Qatar has established a significant presence as the largest shareholder of the Volkswagen Group. Additionally, Qatar holds stakes in Siemens, a major technology firm; Deutsche Bank, a leading financial institution; Hapag-Lloyd, a prominent shipping company; and Hochtief, a construction giant.\nQatar's investment activities in Europe have drawn severe criticism, encompassing issues from claims of receiving unfairly privileged treatment through tax exemptions to more serious accusations of human rights abuses, money laundering, and terrorism financing. These concerns highlight the complex and often contentious nature of significant foreign investments, especially those involving strategic sectors and sensitive political contexts.\nThe rationale behind Qatar's extensive investment in Europe is twofold. Firstly, it aims to diversify its investment portfolio and reduce its dependency on oil and gas revenues. Secondly, it seeks to establish Qatar as a key player in the global economy, capable of influencing economic trends and developments. By investing in Europe, Qatar gains access to some of the world's most developed markets, offering stability and potential for growth, and creating long-term economic ties with other powerful economies.\nA notable example of Qatar's investment strategy in Europe is its commitment to invest $5 billion in Spain's EU-funded recovery projects. This investment underscores Qatar's interest in supporting European economies while securing lucrative opportunities for its sovereign wealth fund. Spain, with its diverse economy and strategic location, presents an attractive destination for Qatari investments, ranging from infrastructure and energy to technology and tourism.\n\n\n== Qatar and European sports ==\nQatar's involvement in European sports, particularly football, is considered a prominent example of Qatars strategic use of soft power to enhance its global standing. Hosting significant events like the FIFA World Cup has played a crucial role in this strategy. Despite the significant financial burden, Qatar views these events as opportunities to enhance its international image and attract further investment and tourism, aligning with its long-term economic diversification goals.\nA key element of Qatar's influence in European sports is its ownership and sponsorship of football clubs. The acquisition of Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) by QSI in 2011 stands as a prominent example. This investment has significantly elevated PSG's status, making it one of the richest and most successful clubs in Europe, capable of attracting elite players and securing numerous domestic championships. Additionally, Qatar has extended its sports sponsorship beyond PSG, establishing agreements with various European football leagues and branching into other sports through major Qatari companies such as Qatar Airways and the telecommunications firm Ooredoo.\nQatar's influence in European sports extends to the broadcasting sector, particularly through its ownership of beIN Sports, a global sports network. This network holds the broadcasting rights for key European football leagues and competitions across various regions, including the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Among the competitions covered are the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, and the UEFA Europa Conference League, broadcast in multiple languages such as Arabic, English, and French across all 24 MENA countries. The broadcasting agreement emphasizes beIN Sports' significant role in distributing European football in this region but also enhances its influence over how the sport is presented to a global audience.\nIn 2017, beIN Sports television channels were banned in Saudi Arabia during a four-year blockade initiated by a Saudi-led coalition against Qatar, citing Qatar's alleged links to Islamist groups, such as al-Qaeda. The conflict escalated when a Saudi-led consortium attempted to purchase Newcastle United, a move opposed by beIN Sports due to its ownership of regional Premier League broadcasting rights. The blockade lasted until January 2021, when it was resolved, allowing for a restoration of relations.\nQatar's sports sponsorship strategy extends beyond club ownership including sponsorships of prestigious tournaments and competitions, offering Qatar an opportunity to promote itself as a destination for major sports events, leading up to the FIFA World Cup 2022 hosted by Qatar. PSG soccer star Neymar Jr., for example, became a global brand ambassador for Qatar National Bank (QNB). As part of the deal, Neymar will exclusively feature in the bank's marketing campaigns and appearances. QNB, a major sponsor of Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), funded Neymar's record-breaking transfer to the club in 2017. In August of last year, QSI financed Neymar's historic transfer from Barcelona to PSG, amounting to a staggering €222 million. Subsequently, the transaction has faced heightened scrutiny, with various reports indicating PSG's potential exploitation of owner-funded sponsorship agreements to navigate around UEFA's Financial Fair Play regulations.\nAllegations of corruption and undue influence have surfaced, particularly in relation to FIFA's decision to award Qatar the hosting rights for the 2022 World Cup. Critics argue that such strategies aim to divert attention from domestic issues or project a certain image internationally, while proponents see them as legitimate efforts to participate in and contribute to global sports and culture. In addition, Critics have raised concerns about the implications of state-owned entities investing heavily in European clubs and leagues, questioning the impact on competition integrity and the potential for political leverage. Additionally, the issue of \"sportswashing\" has been highlighted, with accusations that Qatar is using its sports investments to distract from criticisms of its human rights record and labor practices.\n\n\n=== The 2022 FIFA World Cup ===\nThe 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar has drawn considerable attention not only for being the first hosted in a majority-Muslim country but also for the influence Qatar exerted in the realms of sports and politics through the event. According to sources, this World Cup was part of Qatar's broader strategy to enhance its global standing and influence through \"soft power\". The event also served to project Qatar's cultural values and national identity to a global audience, in part by adhering to Islamic cultural norms such as restricting alcohol sales in stadiums.\nThe process by which Qatar was awarded the World Cup was steeped in controversy, with allegations of corruption and bribery. Critics argued that Qatar used its considerable financial resources to influence the voting process within FIFA. There were accusations by European and United States representatives that Qatari officials offered financial incentives to key football figures and nations to secure their votes, which Qatar has consistently denied.\nIn addition, Qatar faced criticism for its strict laws regarding alcohol consumption and LGBT rights, which are in stark contrast to the norms in many Western countries. The country's policies and attitudes toward these issues led to concerns about the safety and freedom of international visitors coming to the World Cup.\n\n\n== Diplomatic relations ==\nWith significant financial resources but limited human resources, Qatar's leaders have used personal connections and strategic support for intermediaries as their main approach to foreign policy. Qatar's diplomatic relations with European countries are characterized by an interplay of mutual interests, strategic partnerships, and evolving geopolitical dynamics. These relations are underpinned by a shared interest in maintaining stability in the Middle East, energy security, and economic cooperation, alongside dialogue on human rights and labor practices. Qatar has actively sought to strengthen its diplomatic ties with European nations through high-level visits, strategic dialogues, and participation in international forums. These engagements are aimed at fostering mutual understanding, exploring areas of cooperation, and addressing global challenges such as terrorism, climate change, and regional conflicts. Qatar's diplomacy is informed by its desire to be a mediator in the Middle East, offering its good offices to facilitate peace talks and conflict resolution, a role that has been recognized and appreciated by many European countries.\nRecent years have seen significant developments in Qatar's diplomatic relations with European countries and its neighbors in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). Qatar has established a series of bilateral agreements and strategic dialogues with various European nations, aiming to strengthen cooperation across multiple sectors. For example, France's relationship with Qatar is marked by the establishment of a Strategic Dialogue in 2019. This framework facilitates operational follow-up on major projects that structure the bilateral relationship, encompassing defense, energy, investment, and cultural exchanges. In addition, in April 2023, France welcomed the announcement that Qatar and Bahrain had resumed diplomatic relations and reopened embassies, marking a positive step towards regional stability.\nHuman rights and labor practices, particularly the Kafala system, have been points of contention in Qatar's relations with European countries. European nations have consistently called for reforms to improve labor conditions and protect the rights of migrant workers in Qatar. In response, Qatar has implemented a series of reforms aimed at addressing these concerns, including the partial dismantling of the Kafala system. These efforts are part of a broader dialogue on human rights between Qatar and its European partners, reflecting a commitment to addressing international concerns.\nThe criticism of Qatar in Europe itself has been subject to scrutiny, with some observers pointing out perceived hypocrisy and racism in the European response. Accusations of bias and double standards have been raised, noting that similar issues in other countries have not always elicited the same level of outrage. Some claim that Qatar and other Muslim states may apply different sets of principles depending on their interests, highlighting the complex interplay of ethical stances, geopolitical interests, and historical grievances. In the Ukraine conflict, for example, Qatar emphasizes that sovereignty is a \"redline\" in its discussions about Ukraine. Despite this stance, Qatar continues to engage with Russia, particularly regarding global energy markets. This demonstrates Qatar's problematic approach to maintaining its interests in global energy, even while holding a principled stance on national sovereignty.\nQatar's alleged involvement in influence campaigns and political lobbying within European institutions has also been a source of controversy. The \"Qatargate\" scandal, involving accusations of corruption and influence-peddling within the European Parliament, has highlighted concerns about the transparency and integrity of Qatar's political engagements in Europe. The organization emphasized that this isn't an isolated incident but part of a larger issue of ethics and transparency within the European Parliament, suggesting that the institution has long suffered from a \"culture of impunity\". Critics argue that such activities undermine democratic processes and could potentially skew policy decisions in favor of Qatar's interests.\nThe scandal erupted when several current and former Members of the European Parliament were arrested on charges of corruption, accepting bribes in the form of large sums of money and significant gifts from Qatari representatives. This was purportedly in exchange for influencing parliamentary decisions and legislation favorable to Qatar. This has led to a significant backlash, with the European Parliament suspending access to its premises for Qatari representatives and halting all pending legislation involving Qatar as investigations continue. Transparency International, an NGO, has labeled this scandal as \"the most blatant case of alleged corruption witnessed by the European Parliament in many years\".\nQatar's political soft power is also rooted in its extensive network of foreign relationships. Qatar's foreign policy of maintaining relations with various groups has faced criticism, with accusations that the state is a major financial supporter of 'terrorist' organizations. Qatar has developed a reputation for supporting various Islamist groups across the Middle East, from Hamas and groups in Syria and Libya to the Taliban. This has sometimes led to perceptions of Qatar as a promoter of Islamist agendas.\n\n\n== Culture and education ==\n\nEuropean educational institutions have established a notable presence in Qatar. Universities such as University College London and HEC Paris have opened campuses in Qatar, as part of Qatar's education city program, offering programs in fields ranging from museum studies to business administration. These institutions attract students from around the world, leveraging Qatar's strategic location and its investments in education to serve as a bridge between Western and Eastern educational practices.\nHowever, the involvement of European schools in Qatar has not been without controversy. Instances involving the leadership of French educational institutions in Qatar highlight some of the challenges faced. For example, Hafid Adnani, the former headmaster of the Bonaparte French School of Doha, was dismissed and required to leave the country following a dispute with the school's financial director, who accused Adnani of lying about his credentials and expressing anti-Muslim sentiments. This incident raised questions about cultural and administrative clashes in international educational ventures.\nFurther complicating the scenario, Franck Choinard, another headmaster from the Voltaire French School, was forced out under troubling circumstances, accused of paedophilia, an allegation he denied. The underlying issues reportedly stemmed from conflicts over the curriculum that pitted the Qatari authorities against the secular board managing the school. These incidents illustrate the delicate balance required when foreign educational policies and practices meet local cultural and regulatory frameworks, often leading to misunderstandings and conflicts.\n\n\n== Media influence ==\n\nQatar's strategic investments in European media are driven by several key factors, encompassing both financial gains and geopolitical influence. Qatar's media ventures in Europe, such as its ownership stakes in Al Jazeera and the launch of Al Arabiya TV in London, are part of a broader strategy to influence cultural and political discourse. Al Jazeera, known for its extensive global reach, has expanded into European markets, strengthening Qatar's presence in international media. Additionally, Al Arabiya TV targets Arabic-speaking youth in Europe, further extending Qatar's media influence. They provide Qatar with a platform to promote narratives that align with its interests, influence public opinion, and participate in cultural exchange. However, this has also raised concerns about potential biases and the impact on editorial independence within European media. The presence of Qatari investments has sparked discussions about the balance between necessary financial support for media outlets and safeguarding against undue foreign influence.\n\n\n=== Al Jazeera ===\nQatar's influence in the global media landscape is significant, particularly through its flagship media enterprise, Al Jazeera. Founded by the Qatari royal family in 1996, Al Jazeera is a global news network broadcasting in Arabic, English, and several other languages. The network serves as a medium for Qatar to reach international audiences. However, it notably refrains from scrutinize the royal family's associations with various groups such as Hamas.\nDue to its ties to the royal family, Al Jazeera operates with a degree of financial independence uncommon among other cable news networks, which are typically subject to market pressures. This has allowed it to serve as an alternative to the often censored state media in the region, focusing on reporting popular grievances and protest movements. This approach has upset powerful regimes such as Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt, and Bahrain, which accuse Al Jazeera of inciting terrorism. Al Jazeera, however, contends that these accusations are attempts to stifle free expression in the region.\nSince the launch of Al Jazeera English in 2006, the network has established a robust presence across the European continent, offering in-depth coverage of European affairs and providing alternative perspectives on global news. With broadcast centers in London and other European cities, the network has been able to cover European news with a depth and breadth that rivals many domestic European news outlets. Al Jazeera's bureaus across Europe, from the Balkans to Scandinavia, enable it to report on a wide range of issues, from political developments and economic crises to social movements and cultural trends. Al Jazeera has gained a reputation among European audiences for its comprehensive coverage of the Middle East, offering insights that often challenge the narratives presented by Western media. Its coverage of events such as the Arab Spring and the Syrian conflict has been particularly noted for providing a platform to voices that are less heard in mainstream European media.\nAl Jazeera has faced controversies and criticisms. According to BBC, \"Al-Jazeera network remains the standard bearer for the Islamist position\". Some governments and critics have accused the network of bias, particularly in its coverage of Middle Eastern politics. These accusations often stem from the network's willingness to broadcast dissenting viewpoints, which has led to tensions with various countries. Additionally, Al Jazeera's ties to the Qatari government have raised questions about its editorial independence, although the network maintains that it operates with journalistic autonomy.\n\n\n==== The case of Yusuf al-Qaradawi ====\nYusuf al-Qaradawi was a prominent Egyptian Islamic theologian known for his extensive work in contemporary Islamic thought and his influential role in the Muslim Brotherhood. He passed away in 2022, but his impact and legacy in the Islamic world remain significant. Al-Qaradawi was born in Egypt in 1926 and became involved with the Muslim Brotherhood in his youth. His academic achievements in Islamic theology earned him a high profile in religious circles. He was known for trying to reconcile Islamic traditionalism with modernity, advocating for what he saw as a moderate interpretation of Islam that was both progressive and adaptable to the challenges of modern life.\nHe was incarcerated during Egypt's monarchical period due to his anti-British activities and was imprisoned three times under Nasser's rule for his affiliations with the Muslim Brotherhood. In 1963, he fled to Qatar, where he became a citizen in 1968, eventually emerging as a leading global Islamic scholar. Residing in Qatar for many years after being exiled from Egypt, al-Qaradawi found a receptive base for his activities and a platform from which he could reach a global audience, particularly through the Qatar-based Al Jazeera network. This relationship allowed him to disseminate his views widely and positioned Qatar as a critical player in the realm of Islamic discourse.\nQatar's support for al-Qaradawi brought Qatar under scrutiny and criticism. Al-Qaradawi's controversial positions, especially his support for what he considered resistance efforts against oppression, aligned with Qatar's own complex and sometimes contentious foreign policy. For instance, his endorsement of groups like Hamas, his support for Palestinian suicide bombings and his outspoken views on conflicts in the Middle East, reflected a bold stance that often conflicted with the policies and sentiments of Western nations and some Arab states.\nThis alignment with al-Qaradawi thus had dual effects: it bolstered Qatar's image as a significant Islamic intellectual hub, but it also attracted accusations of supporting extremism, particularly from neighboring countries like Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt, and Bahrain. These nations, which have had strained relations with Qatar, particularly pointed to Qatar's support for figures like al-Qaradawi as evidence of its problematic foreign policy.\n\n\n== Security and terrorism ==\nQatar has engaged in significant military and defense collaboration with several European countries. This includes joint training exercises, defense procurement, and strategic dialogues aimed at enhancing military capabilities and interoperability. Qatar's purchases of military hardware from European defense contractors not only bolster its own defense posture but also strengthen defense industrial ties with Europe. Additionally, Qatar hosts military bases that serve as strategic assets for Western allies, including the United States, which further cements its role as a key security partner in the region.\nIn the face of growing cyber threats, Qatar has prioritized cybersecurity cooperation with European partners. This includes sharing best practices, collaborating on cyber defense strategies, and participating in international efforts to combat cybercrime. The exchange of information and expertise in this area is vital for protecting critical infrastructure and ensuring the security of digital communications. Qatar and several European countries have collaborated on security preparations for major events, such as the FIFA World Cup 2022, highlighting the importance of international security partnerships.\nQatar's security cooperation with Europe in the realm of counter-terrorism is controversial. Qatar and European nations share intelligence, collaborate on law enforcement efforts, and work together to combat the financing of terrorism. Qatar's role in mediating conflicts and its diplomatic ties with a wide range of actors in the Middle East position it as a valuable partner in efforts to address the root causes of terrorism and violent extremism.\nQatar's involvement in counter terrorism is controversial as they are also considered a significant supporter and financer of numerous terrorist groups such as Al-Qaeda, Hamas, Hezbollah and Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Between 2012 and 2015 multiple reports suggested that Qatar was backing the Al Nusra Front, recognized as a terrorist organization and the Syrian branch of Al-Qaeda by the US in 2012. Notable publications such as the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times highlighted occasions when Al Nusra leaders visiting Doha and concerns voiced by President Obama to Qatari leadership about arming extremists. In addition, reports from the Washington Post in 2015 indicated that Qatar played a role in forming the “Army of Conquest,” a coalition where Al Nusra was a significant participant.\nQatar has a history of supporting Hamas, a designated as a terrorist organization by Israel, the United States, European Union, Canada, Egypt and Japan. Qatar has provided financial aid, estimated at $1.8 billion over the years, political support. In addition, Qatar has also hosted Hamas officials including Ismail Haniyeh and Khaled Mashal and provided them with a political platform. Qatar's support has positioned it as a key negotiator in conflicts between Hamas and Israel, despite questions about its neutrality due to its ongoing relationship with Hamas. While the Qatari government is not directly funding ISIS, there have been concerns about private individuals in Qatar contributing to the group. The U.S. has noted that Qatar could be seen as a permissive environment for the financing of extremist groups, and although significant steps have been taken to improve its counter-terrorism financing laws, challenges remain in fully curbing the flow of private funds from Qatar to groups like ISIS.\n\n\n=== The Muslim brotherhood ===\nThis funding strategy aligns with Qatar's broader foreign policy objectives, which appear to be aimed at expanding its influence within Islamic communities in Europe. Investigations and reports have shown that Qatar has been a major funder of Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated projects across Europe. European governments have expressed concerns about this involvement, particularly wary of the potential for radicalization and the creation of isolated communities that may not integrate well with broader European society. The Muslim Brotherhood's ideological stance and its implications for integration and security remain contentious issues in European political and social spheres.\n\"Qatar Papers\" by French journalists Georges Malbrunot and Christian Chesnot uncovers Qatar's extensive funding of the Muslim Brotherhood (MB) in Europe, particularly through financial contributions aimed at spreading Islamist ideology. The book, based on a wide range of documents and testimonies across its 295 pages and 14 chapters, discusses how over the past eight years Qatar funded over 140 projects in Europe to spread MB ideology.\nThe authors provide detailed accounts of how funds were distributed, including €72 million funneled directed to influential figures within the MB network in seven European countries. Notably, the book details how Tariq Ramadan, a prominent but controversial MB figure in Europe, received a substantial consultancy fee of €35,000 per month from the Qatar Foundation. Furthermore, just before his arrest on charges unrelated to the funding, Ramadan withdrew a large sum of €590,000 from Qatari bank accounts, underscoring his deep financial ties with Qatar. In addition, the book reveals a strategic document found in the Swiss home of Youssef Nada, a key MB leader, which outlines plans to influence European local governments and officials. This strategy was aimed at increasing the MB's ideological influence through local governance.\n\"Qatar Papers\" also highlights French intelligence concerns regarding Qatari support for the Union des Organisations Islamiques de France, a key umbrella group in France known for its MB affiliations. Beyond individuals and political strategies, the book exposes Qatari funding of institutions like Mucivi, or the Musée des Civilisations de l'Islam in Geneva, which is accused of promoting MB propaganda.\n\n\n== See also ==\nQatar corruption scandal at the European Parliament\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nAntwi-Boateng, O.

        "content": "Carl Gustaf (Carl-Gustaf) Bore Regårdh (25 March 1921 – 20 March 2009) was a Swedish engineer. Regårdh had a distinguished senior career in the Swedish Army, starting as an engineer and progressing through various roles of increasing responsibility and rank. Noteworthy positions included serving as an assistant military attaché in Washington, D.C., where he facilitated technology transfers to Sweden. Upon returning to Sweden, he held administrative positions in the Royal Swedish Army Materiel Administration. He eventually became Chief of the Swedish Army Electrical and Mechanical Engineers' Corps, overseeing significant advancements in maintenance systems and advocating for technical education reform. After two terms, he transitioned to private business, where he conducted investigations for prestigious institutions and government agencies.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nRegårdh was born on 25 March 1921 in Helsingborg Parish in Malmöhus County, the son of Carl Regårdh and his wife Lilly (née Ohnell). Regårdh passed studentexamen in Helsingborg in 1941. He began his military career at the Karlskrona Coastal Artillery Regiment and became a second lieutenant in the Swedish Coastal Artillery reserve on 1 September 1944. After that, he pursued studies at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, where he obtained a Master of Science degree in mechanical engineering in 1948.\n\n\n== Career ==\nRegårdh served as an engineer at the Materiel Maintenance Office in the Ordnance Department of the Royal Swedish Army Materiel Administration from 1948 to 1949, and as a second-grade army engineer (arméingenjör av 2. graden) with the rank of lieutenant at the Gothenburg Anti-Aircraft Corps from 1 July 1949 to 1950. On 11 April 1950, he was already assigned to the Army Staff's Anti-Aircraft Department in Stockholm and was appointed as a first-grade army engineer (arméingenjör av 1. graden) with the rank of captain on 1 October 1951. Regårdh also served as a teacher in materiel science (fire control doctrine) at the Anti-Aircraft Officer School (Luftvärnsofficersskolan) from 1951 to 1954. He later joined the Royal Swedish Army Materiel Administration's Ordnance Department, where he was assigned to the Fire Control Section of the First Weapons Office (Första vapenbyrån), starting on 1 October 1953. Afterwards, Regårdh served as a section chief at the Ordnance Department in the Royal Swedish Army Materiel Administration from 1953 to 1954 and as a section chief at the Royal Swedish Army Ordnance Administration from 1954 to 1956.\nFrom 1 October 1956, to 30 September 1962, Regårdh served in Washington, D.C. as the assistant military attaché at the Swedish embassy, a position held by army engineers. During that time, he was promoted (on 1 April 1958) to the rank of second-grade army director (armédirektör av 2. graden). As an attaché, he made an important contribution to facilitating the transfer of technology to Sweden, including new missile systems. Upon returning to Sweden, he resumed his service at the Royal Swedish Army Materiel Administration, this time as a senior administrative officer (byrådirektör). Starting from 1 July 1958, it was no longer permissible to hold civilian-military positions in departments other than the Workshop Department and the Materiel Inspection, which meant that Regårdh had to bid farewell to his civilian-military service. It was also not possible to enter the reserve of the Swedish Army Electrical and Mechanical Engineers' Corps according to the parliamentary decision in 1958. Thus, Regårdh became a conscripted civilian-military major. On 1 April 1964, Regårdh succeeded Bo Ehnbom as Chief of the Swedish Army Electrical and Mechanical Engineers' Corps. The chief held the title of arméöverdirektör with the rank of colonel, and was also the head of the Royal Swedish Army Ordnance Administration's Workshop Department.\nRegårdh was the head of the Maintenance Department in the Army Material Administration (which was renamed the Main Department for Army Materiel in 1972) at the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration (FMV) from 1968 to 1976. Under his leadership, a modern computer-based maintenance system was introduced at FMV, allowing for the first time an overview of the status and costs of equipment maintenance. Modern methods and resources were also introduced at the army's regiments to streamline maintenance and training. He strongly advocated for the establishment of a joint school for all technical branches in 1977: the Swedish Army Technical School (Arméns tekniska skola). He proposed that it should be co-located with the Svea Engineer Regiment in Almnäs, Södertälje Municipality, but despite his vigorous protests, the government decided to locate the school in Östersund.\nThe Chief of the Swedish Army Electrical and Mechanical Engineers' Corps was appointed for six-year terms. By 1 April 1976, Regårdh had served two terms. There was a rule that those who had served two terms and reached the age of 55 could receive a pension. Regårdh took advantage of this and transitioned to private business. Regårdh became the last to hold the title of arméöverdirektör. From 1976, Regårdh worked as a self-employed entrepreneur.

He returned to Megisti Lavra and was appointed assistant and then Principal of the Athoniada School (1886–1889) and later secretary of the Holy Community (1889–1894). He was ordained presbyter by Patriarch Joachim III when he was Metropolitan of Thessaloniki. He was elected head-abbot (1897) and served the Lavra as Commissioner and Representative. He was a member of the educational brotherhood of Madytians and the Society of Medieval Studies of Constantinople.\n\n\n== His murder ==\nOn his way to the Christmas celebration at the Great Lavra, on December 22, 1908, he was murdered at the borders of the I.M. Iviron. Regarding the reasons for his murder, his subordinate novice Alexander, who accompanied him, expressed the opinion that Chrysostomos was a victim of the Kelliotiko issue, i.e., the dependency of a large number of monks from the I.M. Great Lavra.\n\n\n== Literary work ==\nCompiled a catalog of manuscripts of the brotherhood of Ioasaphites I.

        "content": "\"Yours\" is a single released by South Korean DJ Raiden and singer-rapper Chanyeol, featuring singer Lee Hi and rapper Changmo. It was released digitally on May 12, 2020, by SM Entertainment and its EDM label, ScreaM Records, and distributed by Genie Music. The lyrics of the song was written by Lee Jae-kwang (JQ), Lee Ji-won, and Changmo. The song was composed by Raiden, Rob Adans, and Benjamin Samama, and arranged solely by Raiden.\n\n\n== Background and release ==\nOn May 7, 2020 SM Entertainment announced that its artists DJ Raiden and Chanyeol of boy band Exo would team up for a single called \"Yours\", which will feature Lee Hi and Changmo. The following day on May 8, the agency uploaded teaser images of Raiden and Chanyeol. On May 11, SM uploaded two different teasers on YouTube; the first one shows Raiden playing organ, while Chanyeol sets up a camera. The second teaser meanwhile, revealed more of the song as Chanyeol sang its chorus by the window, while Raiden plays the organ and an electric guitar.\n\n... previously, I was more focused on my career as a DJ and producer in the dance/electronic music scene, but this song was everything I had dreamed of – being able to collaborate with brilliant musicians from many musical genres to make wonderful music.\nOn May 12 the single was digitally released alongside its music video. A day later, the agency released the acoustic version of the song with Chanyeol on drums, Changmo on piano, and Raiden on guitar. This version premiered on Naver TV, and V Live, before being uploaded to SM Entertainment's YouTube channel on May 14.\n\n\n== Composition and lyrics ==\n\"Yours\" was composed by Rob Adans, Raiden, Changmo, and Benjamin Samama. Musically, \"Yours\" is a synth-pop song infused with funky rhythms reminiscent of funk music from the 1970s. CNN Indonesia described the song as a fusion between disco and R&B with a touch of retro by the synthesizer.\n\"Yours\" tells the story of someone who is still pining for an ex-lover after their romantic relationship fell apart. The lyrics also refer to the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent social distancing. Raiden aimed for the song to spread positivity and warmth worldwide. Chanyeol, who was also involved in the song's production process revealed that he had been wanting to collaborate with Raiden for quite some time, stating \"I've been writing a lot of music and wanting to release new material but I simply could not find the \"one.\"\" After listening to the demo of \"Yours\", Chanyeol was satisfied as it matched what he had envisioned. \nChangmo, who was responsible for writing the rap lyrics joined the project after expressing his desire to be part of the song. He claimed that writing the rap lyrics was \"cool\" as it was different from his usual style of hip-hop music.\n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe music video for the song was released simultaneously with the single on May 12.\nThe concept for the music video originated from Changmo's direction which Lee Hi and Chanyeol liked. The video itself was quite simplistic as it shows Chanyeol moving across four different rooms that portray winter, autumn, summer, and spring. Raiden makes an appearance on the music video playing guitar and a synthesizer.\nOn May 15, SM Entertainment uploaded a video of the song's production process.\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\nWithin the first week of its release, \"Yours\" debuted at number 49 on the Gaon Digital Chart for the week of May 10–16. The song debuted at number 5 of Gaon's Download Chart issue for the week of May 10 – May 16. The song ranked at number 44 of Gaon's Download Chart issue of May 2020. The song entered Billboard's K-pop Hot 100 chart debuted at number 99 before peaking at number 53, and spent two weeks on the chart.\nIn United States, \"Yours\" debuted on the World Digital Song Sales and peaked at number 8, where it stayed on the chart for a week.\n\n\n== Live performances ==\nThe song was performed live for the first time on August 5, 2020, at the 2020 CASS Blue Playground, followed by the upload of the behind-the-scenes video of the artists' participation two days later.\nThe song was then performed at the SM Town Live 2023: SMCU Palace at Kwangya, with Winter and Mark Lee taking the places of Lee Hi and Changmo respectively.\n\n\n== Remix ==\nOn September 17, 2020, SM Entertainment released a remixed version of the song called \"Blinders Remix.\"\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Parnaíba Thermal Power Complex (Portuguese: Complexo Termelétrico Parnaíba) is a set of thermal power plants located in the Brazilian city of Santo Antônio dos Lopes, in the state of Maranhão. The gas used in power generation is produced in fields located near the complex. With 1.8 GW of installed capacity, it is currently the second largest natural gas-fired power station in Brazil.\n\n\n== Natural gas in Maranhão ==\n\n\n=== Initial research ===\nOil exploration began in the Parnaíba Basin at the end of the 1940s with two wells being drilled in Maranhão by the National Petroleum Council (CNP). Between the 1960s and 1980s, research was carried out by Petrobras and contract companies. However, the volume of data acquired during this period was considered insufficient due to the large size of the basin. In June 2002, the National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP) offered exploration blocks in the Parnaíba Basin in the fourth bidding round, but no blocks were acquired.\nIn 2007, in the ANP's ninth bidding round, some sectors were acquired by Petra Energia (PN-T-48/49/50/67/68/84/85), Devon (PN-T-66), Petrobras (PN-T-86) and Comp (PN-T-102). In September 2009, OGX, the oil and natural gas branch of the EBX group, announced the purchase of a 70% stake in seven onshore blocks belonging to Petra Energia, which remained with 30%.\n\n\n=== Discovery and production ===\nDrilling activities began on July 5, 2010. On August 12, 2010, OGX announced the discovery of natural gas reserves in well 1-OGX-16-MA, in block PN-T-68. A new discovery was made in the OGX-16 well on September 2 and on November 17 and 26 discoveries were made in the OGX-22 well. In September 2011, OGX Maranhão acquired a 50% stake in the onshore exploration block PN-T-102 in the Parnaíba basin held by the companies Imetame Energia S.A., DELP Engenharia Mecânica Ltda. and Orteng Equipamentos e Sistemas Ltda.\nIn September 2012, OGX Maranhão obtained an operating license to start production in the Parnaíba Basin at the Gavião Azul and Gavião Real fields. Commercial gas production began in January 2013. Currently, gas exploration in the Parnaíba Basin is carried out by the company Eneva and has the capacity to produce 8.4 million cubic meters of gas per day. It has installed 153 kilometers of gas pipelines at an investment cost of R$9 billion.\nThe largest natural gas producing states in 2021 were: Rio de Janeiro (64%); São Paulo (12.4%); Amazonas (10.15%); Maranhão (4.38%); Espírito Santo (4.09%); Bahia (4.06%); Ceará/Rio Grande do Norte (0.50%); Sergipe/Alagoas (0.45%). Maranhão is a pioneer in onshore gas exploration and transportation via pipelines to a thermoelectric plant and the second largest onshore gas producer in Brazil. The cities involved in gas exploration are: Lima Campos, Santo Antônio dos Lopes, Capinzal do Norte, Trizidela do Vale and Pedreiras.\n\n\n=== Plant construction ===\nIn August 2011, the Maranhão III TPP project won the A-3 auction held by the Brazilian Electricity Regulatory Agency (ANEEL). The MC2 Nova Venecia 2 TPP (Parnaíba III) and Parnaíba I (a combination of the Maranhão IV and Maranhão V plants) originated from projects that had won the A-5/2008 Auction to be built in other locations and were transferred to the Parnaíba Complex project.\nOn January 19, 2013, Parnaíba I began supplying energy to the National Interconnected System (SIN) on a test basis through the operation of the first turbine; it received commercial authorization on February 1, 2013. On February 8, the second turbine went into operation. The third turbine started commercial operation on March 16 and the fourth on April 5.\nThe first generating unit of Parnaíba III (MC2 Nova Venecia 2) started commercial operation on October 14, 2013, and the second on February 18, 2014. Parnaíba IV started commercial operation on December 13, 2013, and Parnaíba II (Maranhão III) on July 1, 2016.\n\n\n== Property ==\nEneva operates a concession area of more than 40,000 square kilometers in the Parnaíba Basin. It also owns the Porto do Itaqui Thermal Power Plant in São Luís, which can produce up to 360 MW and is powered by coal. It has ten commercial fields in Maranhão: five in production (Gavião Real, Gavião Vermelho, Gavião Branco, Gavião Caboclo, Gavião Azul and Gavião Preto) and five under development (Gavião Branco Norte, Gavião Tesoura, Gavião Carijó, Gavião Belo and Gavião Mateiro). It also has seven Discovery Assessment Plans (PADs), seven exploration blocks obtained in the ANP's 13th Bid Round in 2015 and five blocks obtained in the ANP's 14th Bid Round in 2017.\nThe gas is produced based on demand from the Parnaíba Complex. Onshore non-associated gas is more competitive in terms of the cost of discovery, development and production per cubic meter, resulting in the generation of energy at more attractive costs for the Brazilian electricity system. In 2017, Eneva reached the milestone of more than 100 wells drilled in the Parnaíba Basin.\n\n\n== New projects ==\nIn the 2018 A-6 New Energy Auction, a new project provided for the installation of the Parnaíba V TPP, which would add 386 MW of power to the complex. It should generate energy through the combined cycle, using the steam generated from the heat produced by Parnaíba I (a combination of the Maranhão IV and Maranhão V plants), without the need for additional natural gas to generate energy.\nIn the A-6 Auction held in October 2019, another project included the construction of the Parnaíba VI project with a capacity of 92 MW, also using the combined cycle. It is the result of the expansion of the MC2 Nova Venécia 2 thermal power plant (178 MW), which will increase to 270 MW. The total capacity of the complex should increase to 1.9 GW.\n\n\n== Energy capacity ==\nThe complex is divided into:\n\nMaranhão IV, with 337.6 MW;\nMaranhão V, with 337.6 MW;\nMC2 Nova Venecia 2, with 178 MW;\nMaranhão III, with 519 MW;\nParnaíba IV, with 56 MW;\nParnaíba V, with 385.7 MW.\n\n\n== Reservoir-to-Wire model ==\nThe reservoir-to-wire (R2W) model consists of thermal generation in the vicinity of onshore natural gas producing fields. The energy produced in the Parnaíba Complex is sent to the National Interconnected System (SIN) via the transmission network that passes nearby.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSuzano Maranhão Thermal Power Plant\nThermal power station\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Maria Platilda Afonso e Dias (born 2 August 1949) is an Indian singer, comedian, and actress known for her work in Konkani films, television, and tiatr (theatre) productions.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMaria Platilda Afonso was born on 3 August 1949, in Betalbatim, Goa, a region that was part of Portuguese India under the governance of the Portuguese Empire. She was born into a Goan Catholic family, with her parents, Roberto Antonio Francisco de Nazareno Afonso and Maria Ansucia Riveira Santana Rodrigues, being landowners in the area. Displaying a passion for music from an early age, Platilda began her singing journey during her school years. She actively participated in the church choir and engaged in singing competitions held at her school, often collaborating with her brother Aires. It is worth noting that Afonso's father was employed in Karachi, British India, while her mother possessed a singing voice. Around the year 1957–58, when Afonso was approximately eight years old, her residence became the site of an annual cross feast, located just outside their house. These feasts attracted the attention of the director of the nearby Portuguese school (known as Aula), who resided in their neighborhood and would attend the novenas (a series of nine religious devotions). During one such novena, Afonso and her brother Aires, who were studying in Portuguese, were inspired by the previous singers and spontaneously sang along with the rosary in Portuguese. Impressed by their talent, the organizers extended an invitation to Afonso and her brother to perform at one of the feasts. Following this, the local catholic priest in Betalbatim acknowledged Aires' talent in singing and extended an invitation to him to perform the song \"Veronica\" for the passion play during the Lent period at their parish church.\nIn 1959, Professor Alicia orchestrated a ceremony to commemorate her first prize achievement in paddy cultivation, which had been bestowed by the Portuguese administration that year. The event was graced by the presence of the Governor-general, who was invited to attend. During this gathering, Afonso and her brother Aires showcased their musical prowess, captivating the then Governor-general of Portuguese India, Manuel António Vassalo e Silva, who was specially summoned to present the award. Professor Alicia, director of Iscola de Portuguese, was honored with the Golden Konnos accolade. In the course of their performance, Afonso and her brother demonstrated their vocal talents, impressing the Governor-general to such an extent that he sought a personal encounter with them. Deeply moved by their abilities, he extended a generous offer of scholarships for their educational pursuits and graciously invited them to his residence in Porta de Gaspar Dias. In preparation for the occasion, Professor Tertoliano DSa, a violinist, trained Afonso and her brother in executing a harmonious Portuguese duet entitled \"Que Saudades,\" which served as a tribute to the Governor-general, who did not comprehend the Konkani language. Subsequently, Afonso and her brother achieved recognition within their local community as accomplished singers. Later that same year, the village youth organized a theatrical production known as a \"tiatr\", a customary form of entertainment prevalent in rural areas during that era. Eager to include Afonso and Aires in the performance, they approached Afonso's mother for consent. However, her mother declined the request, citing the necessity of obtaining Afonso's father's authorization, as he happened to be situated in Karachi, British India at the time.\nIn the rural village of Betalbatim, a group of young boys, led by Afonso's future husband Ivo Dias, a tiatr writer, approached Professor Alicia with a request. Professor Alicia, in turn, approached Afonso's mother to obtain permission for Afonso and her brother to participate in their endeavors. Afonso's mother agreed to correspond with Afonso's father in Karachi, seeking his consent. After a period of correspondence, Afonso's father granted permission, taking into account the respectable backgrounds of the boys involved and their commitment to the village. Ivo provided the Afonso siblings with three songs: one solo for Aires, one solo for Afonso, and a duet for Afonso and her brother, Aires. Their performances in the village garnered acclaim, propelling them to local fame. As a result, they received an invitation to showcase their talent at the Majorda tiatr. Established tiatrists such as Jacinto Vaz, M. Dod de Verna, and Kid Boxer were also part of this event. Impressed by the singing abilities of Afonso and her brother Aires, these professionals expressed a keen interest in learning more about their background and place of residence. M. Dod, in particular, visited their home the very next day to meet Afonso's mother. Although initially hesitant, Afonso's mother eventually relented, granting permission for Afonso and Aires to participate exclusively in village tiatrs, provided that M. Dod would ensure their safe return. The siblings embarked on a series of village tiatrs, collaborating with both local playwrights and contractors. Through these engagements, Afonso and Aires had the opportunity to interact with established artists such as M. Boyer, Jacinto Vaz, Remmie Colaço, and the Trio Kings. In their debut tiatr under M. Dod's guidance, Afonso captivated audiences with a  duet alongside her brother, garnering appreciation.\nM. Boyer found himself in need of a young performer and selected Afonso's brother, Aires, to join him in Bombay for his theatrical production titled Kazarache Ratri (Wedding Night). Aires delivered a performance that received acclaim. In a subsequent production called Thevoi Thomas, written by M. Dod de Verna, Afonso and her brother were cast and embarked on an extensive tour for about year. Despite not receiving remuneration in the form of shares, they were generously gifted monetary contributions in envelopes by the audience as a token of appreciation for their performances in these local theater productions. In due course, Afonso and her brother became members of the Young Stars of Goa, a theater group formed by Nelson Afonso, where they established themselves as regular contributors to the tiatr scene as child artistes.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAfonso's talent gradually caught the attention of popular directors, propelling her into the spotlight. Initially performing alongside her brother Aires, she expanded her collaborations to include other male singers, showcasing her vocal abilities. Her talent attracted several male singers who eagerly sought to perform duets with her. Afonso's professional acting debut occurred in the tiatr production Dha Mandament (Ten Commandments), directed by Jephsis Hitler, where she entertained audiences with her acting skills. Subsequently, she received a growing number of offers, leading to her breakthrough role in the acclaimed tiatr Kantteantlem Ful (Thorn Flower), produced by Star of Curtorim. The performance was presented by members of the Young Stars of Goa collective. This widely performed production garnered significant praise in both Goa and Bombay, providing Afonso with extensive exposure and establishing her as a recognized figure in the realm of tiatr. During her stage career, Afonso married her fiancé Ivo Dias, who himself was a semi-professional tiatrist from their shared village. Following a hiatus to fulfill family commitments, Afonso made a return to the stage, captivating audiences once again with her performances.\nAfonso became a leading figure in the field of Konkani theater during the 1990s, receiving significant support from her husband Ivo, who recognized her acting and singing abilities. Despite Ivo having retired from the stage, he encouraged Afonso to pursue her talents. Afonso successfully transitioned to comedy roles, establishing herself as the leading female comedienne in the Konkani theater scene. Afonso's mere presence on stage would elicit laughter from the audience. Her poise, along with her fluent delivery of the \"Salcete-Konkani\" or \"Saxtti\" dialect, charmed theatergoers and proved to be an aspect of her performances. Afonso's talent took her to various countries abroad, including the Gulf countries and the United Kingdom, where she captivated audiences with her acting skills as a tiatrist. Throughout Goa and Bombay, Afonso remained in high demand, consistently entertaining theater enthusiasts with her comedic roles. Her versatility extended beyond acting, as she showcased her singing prowess through audio cassettes and performances on platforms such as All India Radio and Doordarshan. Afonso's talent was not limited to the theater, as she also ventured into telefilms and was even considered for a significant role in a feature film during the mid-1990s. Over the course of her career, Afonso had the privilege of working with popular Konkani directors in the Konkani theater industry, including C. Alvares, M. Boyer, Remmie Colaço, Prem Kumar, Robin Vaz, Aristides Dias, M. Dod de Verna, J. P. Souzalin, Anthony D'Sa, Anthony Mendes, John Claro, and Mike Mehta. Furthermore, Afonso occasionally participated in non-stop shows, further demonstrating her talent and versatility as an artist.\nAfonso, as a vocalist, exhibited her musical prowess by engaging in collaborative performances ranging from duos, duets, trios to quartets. A significant portion of her repertoire comprises compositions by her husband, Ivo, who is recognized for his adeptness as a lyricist and prior involvement in dramatic endeavors. While she frequently collaborated with her brother, Aires, in duets, Afonso also found success in partnering with Tony Sax and Luis Rod. Her artistic ventures have led her on extensive tours across the Gulf countries, where she has enthralled audiences through her participation in tiatr and khell-tiatr productions. Throughout her career, Afonso has embraced a diverse array of roles, embodying characters such as a mentally unstable woman, a youthful damsel, a comedic figure, simpleton, drunkard, Kunbi, mother, old lady, and various other archetypes, thereby showcasing her versatility as an actress. She harbors a particular sentiment towards her depiction of a university student in the theatrical production Hello Daddy, under the direction of Mike Mehta. Afonso showcased a portrayal as a genuine bhattkann (landlady) during a performance, that left an impression with the audience, astonishing spectators who failed to recognize her in that particular show. Her affinity for comedic roles and skill in uplifting the audience's spirits have made her a sought-after choice for directors of khell-tiatr productions. In 2018, Afonso made a return to the stage after a 15-year hiatus, gracing the tiatr production Tukai Tench Assa written and directed by Sharon Mazarello. In this production, she assumed the role of Marikin, a character fluent in Portuguese, alongside Wilson Mazarello, who portrayed Santu. Additionally, Afonso participated in a well-received trio performance alongside Josephine and Jessie Dias, which garnered an encore from the audience.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nAfonso is the sibling of Aires, who also actively participated in the Konkani performing arts. Afonso entered into marriage with Venancio Antonio lyode Tadeu \"Ivo\" Dias, a former semi-professional tiatr writer and composer. Together, they had four daughters: Ila, Ilma, llena, and Ivilda. Afonso's husband died in Margao, Goa on 3 June 2013. As a result, Afonso assumed the role of the moiety sharer of her husband's estate on 29 November 2019, as he had not executed a will before his death. Afonso's success as an artiste can be attributed to her diligent approach to her craft. She is known for her meticulous study of scripts and her commitment to understanding and portraying her roles authentically. Drawing inspiration from individuals in her immediate environment, Afonso keenly observes their moods, mannerisms, and nuances, refining her performances accordingly. She places great importance on character development and portrayal. As of 2012, Afonso was a resident of Thondwaddo, Betalbatim, Goa.\n\n\n=== The moustache incident ===\nDuring a tiatr performance, Afonso was engaged to Jacinto Vaz, a fellow actor known for always donning a false mustache. However, a peculiar incident occurred on a particular day that led to an unexpected turn of events. As Afonso energetically moved about the stage, her hand inadvertently made contact with Jacinto's mustache, causing it to dislodge and fall off. The audience burst into laughter, much to Jacinto's dismay, as he felt his pride wounded. Sensing the need to rectify the situation, Afonso quickly devised a clever plan. With quick thinking, she addressed Jacinto, uttering the words, \"Tum muge mai-paik muko friendly ass mhun kollot mhun heo mixeo laita nhu? Pun mhaka tum sarko kess dissot to choichea zaieo mixio nastanam,\" which loosely translates to, \"Are you wearing this mustache in fear of my parents since you're so friendly with me? However, I'm curious to witness your appearance without it.\" Afonso's impromptu remark not only managed to salvage the performance but also garnered applause from the audience. In the aftermath of the scene, Jacinto's anger subsided, and he expressed his gratitude by embracing Afonso for her quick wit and ability to avert a potentially embarrassing situation.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPlatilda Dias at IMDb",

This single was released on June 23, 1967, by Deram Records on a double A-side together with the song Tom Hark by Rupert Bopape.\nShortened to Little Miss Mary, it was published the same year in October with lyrics in a version by the Dutch band The Cats. They recorded the song on their first LP Cats as Cats Can and again a few years later on Times Were When (1972); both albums achieved gold status. In 2014, the song was released again in a remastered version on Complete, a limited edition of 1000 copies during the 50th anniversary of The Cats. The Cats' version was sung by Cees Veerman.\nIn July 1968 there was another cover, this time on the A-side of the American band The Convention on the Buddah Records label.\nIt is a love song in which the singer asks Mary to come out of her garden and to his yard. He wants their love to have time to grow, because nothing would blossom if she stayed with the other person.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Pietro Bruzzi (20 March 1888 – 19 February 1945) was an Italian mechanic, anarchist activist and partisan.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBruzzi was born on 20 March 1888, in the Lombard town of Maleo, where he was educated at a vocational school. After graduating, he moved to Milan, where he became involved with local socialist groups, before joining the Italian anarchist movement. In October 1909, he was made editor-in-chief of the newspaper La Protesta umana, but his radical articles soon made him a target for arrest, forcing him to flee into exile in France the following year. Stopping in Marseilles, he briefly contributed to the newspaper La Rivolta, before heading on to Paris, where he arrived in July 1910 and joined up with the anarcho-syndicalists. In January 1911, he stayed in the United States, but had returned to Europe by April 1912.\nFollowing the Italian entry into World War I, in 1916, he was arrested and repatriated to Italy, where he was conscripted into the Royal Italian Army. He quickly deserted and fled to neutral Switzerland, where he met up with a number of Milanese individualist anarchists that had taken refuge in Zürich. Bruzzi was soon arrested by the Swiss police, under suspicion of involvement in a bombing, who expelled him from the country. Back in Milan, he was sentenced to death for desertion, but he was granted amnesty after the war ended.\nIn post-war Milan, he joined the individualist movement as editor of the newspapers Individualista and Iconoclasta. In March 1921, he became a prime suspect of organising the Diana massacre. Together with Ugo Fedeli, he fled over the Swiss border in disguise as railway workers. He then went on to Berlin, where, with the support of the local anarchist communists and Rudolf Rocker, he was able to travel to Moscow, in Soviet Russia. He soon returned to Germany, and stayed briefly in Austria and Belgium, before returning to France. In April 1922, he settled in Courbevoie, where he worked as a mechanic for the rest of the 1920s. During this period, the Italian authorities weren't able to trace his movements.\nTogether with Ugo Fedeli and Mario Mantovani, he contributed articles to the magazine Eresia, and after the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic in 1931, he moved to Barcelona, where he joined the libertarian correspondence office and collaborated on the magazine Il Risveglio anarchico. In June 1931, he attended an anti-fascist rally that protested the execution of Michele Schirru by the authorities of Fascist Italy. He worked as the secretary of the French anarcho-syndicalist Pierre Besnard and travelled around Spain, giving lectures and participating in anti-fascist activism, under the pseudonym \"Pietro Bucci\". He was expelled from the country in March 1933, but returned to Barcelona clandestinely. On 28 January 1935, he was extradited to Fascist Italy, which caused mass protests from the anarchist movement.\nFollowing his repatration, he was acquitted of the charges of conspiracy that had been on the books since the 1920s. Nevertheless, he was deported to the penal colony on Ponza, where he was imprisoned for five years. On 8 July 1940, he was released and decided to return to work in Milan. After the fall of the Fascist regime in Italy, in 1943, he linked up with his old anarchist comrades and joined the Italian resistance movement, establishing the Malatesta Brigade. He also covertly attempted to publish the newspaper L'Adunata dei libertari, but only a single issue was printed, on 18 July 1944. He was captured in Melegnano by the Nazis, who imprisoned him at San Vittore Olona. On 19 February 1945, he was shot by the Nazi Schutzstaffel (SS), in reprisal for the fascist losses in the Italian campaign. His comrades subsequently renamed their unit, in his honour, to the Bruzzi-Malatesta Brigade.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==",

        "content": "Leonardo Frescobaldi (1485–1529) was an Italian merchant based in England at the court of Henry VIII.\n\n\n== Career ==\nHe was a son of Jerome Frescobaldi (died 1517), a merchant of Florentine origin based in Antwerp and Bruges, and Dianora Gualterotti. The Frescobaldi family had a wide mercantile interest. Jerome (Girolamo) Frescobaldi supplied luxury goods to the court of James IV of Scotland, and some textiles for the coronation of Henry VII of England in 1485.\nHis brother Francesco Frescobaldi is said to have offered hospitality and employment to Thomas Cromwell in Florence around the year 1504, according to Matteo Bandello.\nLeonardo and his brother Filippo Frescobaldi based themselves at the English court from 1511, where there were several other Italian merchants in residence. Leonardo obtained a licence to export 100 sacks of wool from Southampton without paying custom duty.\n\nLeonardo Frescobaldi stood as a guarantor with John (Giovanni) Cavalcanti for the Florentine artist Pietro Torrigiano when he was contracted to make the tomb of Margaret Beaufort in 1511. He was a party to Torrigiano's indenture of 23 November 1511. His name however does not appear with the Florentine merchants listed in Torrigiano's indenture for a tomb for Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon, or in an agreement underwritten by merchants from Lucca printed by John Britton. A Netherlandish artist involved in the project for Lady Margaret Beaufort's tomb, Meynnart Wewyck had been in Scotland in 1502 and 1503 painting portraits.\nLeonardo Frescobaldi and John Cavalcanti were partners in supplying harness (armour), saltpetre of good quality \"after the finest making in Naples\", guns, and cable to Henry VIII for the Tower of London armoury and John Heron.\nIn 1513, Leonardo Frescobaldi was given an annuity or pension by Henry VIII as a vendor of cloth of gold and silver, and he was made an usher of the king's chamber, with an income of 50 marks.\nLeonardo Frescobaldi supplied damask gold thread to the king's embroiderer John Milner. He also supplied guns and military equipment to Henry VIII, including halberds, axes and handguns, 4,500 suits of armour, cables for the king's ships, and a suite of twelve cannons called the \"Twelve Apostles\". Some of this weaponry may have been used in France and against Scotland at the battle of Flodden. Cardinal Wolsey raised loans to pay for the armour and artillery purchases of Henry VIII from the Frescobaldi and Cavalcanti banks.\nFrescobaldi undertook to convey money from Henry VIII to Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor in 1516, but failed to make the transfer in due time, compromising the Emperor's military operations in Italy. Under pressure, and despite the advocacy of Cardinal Campeggio in England, the Frescobaldi firm was bankrupted in May and June 1518.\nLeonardo Frescobaldi was advised of plans for the meeting of Henry VIII and Francis I of France at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520, and notified Italian merchants that Henry VIII would order a large quantity of silks and cloth of gold. Some of the textiles used were supplied by the Bardi and Cavalcanti families.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ashutosh Chilkoti is an Indian American biomedical engineer, academic and researcher. He is the Alan L. Kaganov Professor of Biomedical Engineering and Senior Associate Dean in the Pratt School of Engineering at Duke University.\nChilkoti has published over 350 papers, has been cited 47,00 times, has a Google Scholar H-index of 115 and has 62 US patents awarded. His research is focused on genetically encoded materials and biointerface science and he has pioneered the development of high-throughput and scalable methods for the recombinant synthesis of repetitive polypeptides, invented a method to purify protein drugs without chromatography, and developed a technology for point-of-care clinical diagnostics. He has founded five start-up companies, including PhaseBio Pharmaceuticals in 2002, Sentilus in 2011, Gateway Bio in 2017, Isolere Bio in 2018, and inSoma Bio in 2019.\nChilkoti is a Fellow of American Association for the Advancement of Science, National Academy of Inventors, Biomedical Engineering Society, Controlled Release Society, International Union of Societies for Biomaterials Science and Engineering and American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering (AIMBE).\n\n\n== Education ==\nChilkoti obtained his Bachelor of Technology degree in Chemical Engineering from the IIT Delhi in 1985. He pursued his graduate studies at the University of Washington, where he earned his Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering in 1991, and carried out post-doctoral studies in the Center for Bioengineering from 1991 to 1995, also at the University of Washington.\n\n\n== Career ==\nChilkoti joined Duke University in 1996 as an Assistant Professor of Biomedical Engineering. He was promoted to Associate Professor in 2002 and Professor in 2006. He was the Theo Pilkington Chair Professor of Biomedical Engineering from 2008 to 2013, and has been the Alan L. Kaganov Distinguished Professor of Biomedical Engineering at Duke University since 2013.\nFrom 2002 till 2007, Chilkoti served as associate director of the Center for Biologically Inspired Materials and Material Systems at Duke University and was the Director of the center from 2007 to 2011. In 2014, he became Chair of the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Duke University and served as chair until 2022. As Chair of the Duke BME department, he launched an incubator—BRiDGE—for Biomedical Engineering faculty and student startups, and he created the Duke Engineering Entrepreneurship program (DEEP)—a post-doctoral fellowship program for recent PhD graduates of the department interested in entrepreneurship. Since 2023, he has been serving as the Senior Associate Dean of Pratt School of Engineering at Duke University.\nChilkoti founded two Gordon Research Conferences (GRCs)—one on Biointerface Science in 2006 and a second on Bioinspired Materials in 2012. Furthermore, he is the founder of five start-ups. These companies include Sentilus, a clinical diagnostics company that was acquired by Immucor in 2014, Phase Bio Pharmaceuticals—a drug delivery company—that had an IPO on NASDAQ in 2018, Isolere Bio—that uses ELPs to purify complex biologics without chromatography—that was acquired by Donaldson in 2023, and inSoma Bio, that has focused on commercializing injectable biomaterials developed in his laboratory for tissue reconstruction.\n\n\n== Research ==\nChilkoti's research has focused on protein engineering, polymer chemistry, biointerface science, and nanobiotechnology.\n\n\n=== Genetically encoded polymers ===\nChilkoti is most known for his work on genetically engineered elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs), which exhibit thermally responsive behavior and have been exploited by his group to develop new technologies and materials for protein purification, controlled drug release, and tissue engineering. He has also pioneered the development of high-throughput and scalable methods for the recombinant synthesis of repetitive peptide polymers that are useful for the recombinant synthesis of ELPs and other repetitive polypeptides. He developed a new non-chromatographic method for the purification of proteins. He also pioneered the development of injectable depots of ELPs fused to peptide and protein drugs for sustained—week or longer—release, and ELP nanoparticles loaded with small molecule chemotherapeutics for cancer therapy. His research group also developed a new class of partially ordered polypeptides that undergo a phase transition from a liquid into a highly porous solid network at body temperature.\n\n\n=== Intrinsically disordered proteins ===\nUsing a method for the rapid and multiplexed gene synthesis of repetitive polypeptides, Chilkoti created new variants of ELPs that show phase separation. He then built upon these findings to identify new sequence heuristics that enable the de novo design of repetitive polypeptides that show LCST and UCST phase behavior. He postulated that the low sequence complexity, structural disorder, and  phase separation behavior of these repetitive polypeptides make them an interesting class of minimal synthetic intrinsically disordered proteins IDPs (synIDPs), and suggested that these SynIDPs can provide insights into the behavior of other more complex, native IDPs. His group has started to exploit the phase transition behavior of two classes of SynIDPs—ELPs that exhibit LCST phase behavior and resilin-like polypeptides (RLPs) that exhibit UCST phase behavior—to create artificial condensates within cells whose material properties and function can be precisely programmed at the sequence level of the SynIDP to reprogram cellular function by spatio-temporally controlling the flow genetic information and biochemical signals within the cell. His later work on functional artificial condensates of SynIDPs in cells includes sequestration of mRNA in a condensate regulate protein translation, sequestration of an enzyme in an artificial condensate  to amplify its activity, sequestration of a plasmid to control gene flow in bacteria and recruitment of the transcriptional machinery to amplify gene expression.\n\n\n=== Next generation PEGylation ===\nChilkoti's research group has developed next-generation polyethylene glycol (PEG)-like conjugates that overcome the immunogenicity issues associated with traditional PEGylation. PEGylation—the attachment of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to biologics—is commonly used to increase their half-life or reduce their immunogenicity, but PEG has itself proven to be antigenic and can elicit a serious anaphylactic response. To overcome these limitations, he designed a new PEG-like stealth hyperbranched polymer that breaks up the long antigenic ethylene glycol sequence in PEG and presents them as much shorter side-chains along a polymer backbone. Peptides and proteins conjugated to this next-generation PEG-like polymer show even longer circulation than PEG conjugates, do not bind to pre-existing anti-PEG antibodies that most people have developed, and do not generate an immune response to this new polymer. He has demonstrated the utility of this technology with a peptide drug for type 2 diabetes, an enzyme drug used to treat gout and an aptamer drug.\n\n\n=== Clinical diagnostics ===\nChilkoti has made contributions to biosensors and clinical diagnostics. His group was the first to demonstrate the use of surface-initiated polymerization to synthesize \"nonfouling\" polymer brushes from diverse surfaces that completely resist the adsorption of proteins and the adhesion of cells. He then used these nonfouling polymer brushes to develop a protein microarray that enables multiplexed detection of protein analytes with a femtomolar limit-of-detection directly from whole blood. Building upon this work, his group then invented the D4 point-of-care testing (POCT) technology, which enables rapid and accurate disease diagnosis by the quantitative measurement of multiple analytes at sub-picomolar concentrations from a drop of blood without user intervention. This technology led to the formation of a startup company —Sentilus—‚  that was acquired by Immucor in 2014. His group later used the D4 POCT for serology for COVID-19, COVID-19 variant detection, and detection of Ebolavirus.\n\n\n=== Plasmonic biosensors ===\nChilkoti introduced an optical method to quantify biomolecular interactions in real time at the surface of an optically transparent substrate. He used this approach to design a label-free plasmonic biosensor in a chip format. Furthermore, he identified several factors to improve the performance of immobilized metal nanoparticle sensors. Moreover, he also conducted a study to discuss the applications of tunable absorption in designing controlled-emissivity surfaces for thermophotovoltaic devices, producing detector elements for imaging and tailoring an infrared spectrum for controlled thermal dissipation.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n1998 - NSF CAREER Award, National Science Foundation\n2002 - 3M Nontenured Faculty Award, Duke University\n2005 - Stansell Family Distinguished Research Award, Duke University\n2007 - Fellow, American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering (AIMBE)\n2010 - Humboldt Senior Researcher Award, Alexander von Humboldt Foundation\n2011 - Clemson Award for “Contributions to the Literature”, Society for Biomaterials\n2013 - Pritzker Distinguished Lecture Award, Biomedical Engineering Society\n2013 - Fellow, Biomedical Engineering Society\n2013 - Fellow, Controlled Release Society\n2014 - Fellow, National Academy of Inventors\n2018 - Chandra P.

        "content": "Veronika is a 2024 Swedish psychological thriller, crime drama television series, which was developed by Viaplay. It was streamed on Viaplay's Australian partners SBS On Demand from 1 March 2024 and accross Europe on SkyShowtime from 24 March. Veronika had been due for streaming in Scandinavia from late 2023 but was delayed due to downsizing by Viaplay. The eight-episode series was created by Katja Juras and Anna Lindblom, who also co-wrote its screenplay. Veronika was directed by Jonas Alexander Arnby. The titular protagonist Veronika, portrayed by Alexandra Rapaport, is a small town policewoman, who has a pill addiction which suppresses her psychic visions. Her husband Tomas (Tobias Santelmann) is the local music teacher and primary carer for their children Liv (Sarah Rhodin) and Simon (Eddie Eriksson Dominguez). When Veronika sees the dead boy Oskar's image, she begins to doubt her sanity. She finds a young woman, Hanna's corpse and assists in the associated murder investigation led by police detective Nassir (Arvin Kananian).\n\n\n== Premise ==\nAction is set in a fictitious central Swedish mining town of Älvsbruk, c.2022. Policewoman Veronika has psychic visions but has suppressed them since childhood by taking prescription pills. Periodically her visions have provoked nightmares and traumatic breakdowns. When Veronika sees a dead boy, Oskar, in a river she believes its a hallucination. Her long-suffering husband, Tomas is frustrated by her apparent indifference to their family's problems with their son, Simon's attention-seeking behaviour and teenage daughter, Liv's misbehaviour when her swimming aspirations are thwarted. Veronika discovers Hanna's corpse and sees the young woman in a vision. Police detective Nassir works with Veronika on Hanna's murder case. Initially they consider popular ice hockey champion Alexander as their suspect. Alexander is arrested when his alibi proves falsified by his team and coach. Veronika begins to doubts Alexander's guilt when she has visions of another murdered young woman, Josefin. Josefin's case was closed earlier as a pedophile confessed to her murder. Veronika finds Hanna wore a butterfly necklace and kept a diary, which mentions another man, \"T\".\nAfter being hypnotised, Veronika better remembers her father, Bengt, including his death. She tracks down her child psychologist who admits to being bribed by Veronika's mother, Ann-Charlotte to sedate her. Veronika's visions sharpen when she stops taking pills. She has a vision of Oskar losing his gumboot in the forest near Hanna's corpse location. After learning Josefin also wore a butterfly necklace, Veronika aligns the deaths of Oskar, Hanna and Josefin. They had occurred during the times that Veronika was hospitalised for her breakdowns. Ann-Charlotte and Tomas are worried that Veronika is heading toward another breakdown by delving into her past. Tomas confronts Veronika when he finds her unprofessional investigations at home. She explains having her psychic visions. Despite professing that he believes her, Tomas calls the hospital for assistance. Veronika drives off distraught, has another vision of Josefin and crashes into a tree. Suspecting attempted suicide, Veronika is committed to the psychiatric ward and sedated by hospital staff. She convinces Nassir to recover her material and to follow up on Oskar's gumboot, Hanna and Josefin's necklaces and Hanna's diary.\n\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n\n\n=== Main cast ===\nAlexandra Rapaport as Veronika Gren (née Löef): Tomas's wife, uniform policewoman, has psychic visions but suppresses them via insomnia pills\nTobias Santelmann as Tomas: Veronika's husband, their children's primary carer, music teacher\nArvin Kananian as Nassir Hakim: newly transferred police detective, investigates Hanna's murder\nSarah Rhodin as Liv: Veronika and Tomas's teenage daughter, swim team aspirant\nEddie Eriksson Dominguez as Simon: Veronika and Tomas's son, has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)\n\n\n=== Additional cast ===\nPer Graffman as Martin: Oskar's father, Ivar's son, swimming coach\nAnders Mossling as Göran: police chief, Veronika and Nassir's boss\nEmelie Garbers as Katrin: Martin's wife, Oskar's mother, senses that Veronika knows about Oskar\nOlle Sarri as Tommy Sand: Sara's drunken abusive husband, Agnes's father, sometime welder\nAdrian Macéus as Jack: Liv's contemporary, swim team member\nChatarina Larsson as Ann-Charlotte: Veronika's mother, Bengt's widow, bribed child psychologist to sedate Veronika\nThea Gotensjö as Hanna Hagman: 16-year-old murder victim, disappeared in October 2017.

        "content": "Jews have faced antisemitism and discrimination in universities and campuses in the United States, from the founding of universities in the Thirteen Colonies until the present day in varying intensities. From the early 20th century, and until the 1960s, indirect quotas were placed on Jewish admissions, quotas were first placed on Jews by elite universities such Columbia, Harvard and Yale and were prevalent as late as the 1960s in universities such as Stanford. These quotas disappeared in the 1970s.\nIn the early 21st century, there was a resurgence of antisemitism, especially after the BDS campaigns in the early 2000s and notably after the October 7, 2023 attacks on Israel when anti-Israel activists and protestors were reported to have engaged in physical and verbal violence toward Jewish students and staff in American universities. American university administrations were criticized for failing to protects Jewish students and the president of Harvard, Penn and MIT were criticized for failing to clearly define calls for genocide of Jews as violating their universities' code of conduct. Some called for the genocide or ethnic cleansing of Jews living in Israel.\n\n\n== 18th century and 19th century ==\nOnly one Jew, Judah Monis, received a college degree from an American university prior to 1800. Monis was given a job in Harvard to teach Hebrew on the condition he converted to Christianity. Despite having converted and married a Christian, he was not embraced by his Harvard colleagues.\nDue to the low proportion of Jews in the overall American population (a quarter million out of 63 millon) according to Nathan Glazer \"… before 1880 or 1890 there were too few American Jews for them to constitute a question\".\n\n\n== 20th century ==\nIn the beginning of the 20th century, US administrators in elite universities in the United States sought to solve what was called to as \"the Jewish problem\" referring to there being too many Jews in campuses. Administrators restricted Jewish enrollment and created the modern admissions process to restrict the number of admitted students of Jewish origin. According to the Washington Post, every major section in the application process, including geographic diversity, legacy preference, the interview and freshman class cap were part of an effort to address \"the Jewish problem\" and reduce the number of Jewish students. Columbia University in New York City, Harvard, Yale and Princeton were among the first universities to restrict Jewish enrollment, following elite universities, hundreds of other US colleges restricted Jewish admission until the 1960s.\nAccording to Mark E. Oppenheimer, vice president of Open Learning at American Jewish university, universities were considering finishing schools for elite Protestant boys, Jewish students sought to use universities as an engine of social mobility and were less interested in the social activities of the university and instead preferred to invest in academic performance and studying, leading to a change in character of American universities which was perceived as a threat to the Protestant American elite.\nJerome Karabel, a sociologist of the University of California wrote in \"The chosen: The hidden history of admission and exclusion at Harvard, Yale and Princeton\" that Jews were seen as socialist proselytizers by nativists as well as a genetically inferior race by some Americans. Jews were considered unacceptable by some elite social circles according to Karabel.\n\nEfforts to restrict Jewish enrollment started in New York City, a city whose population was 30% Jewish in the early 20th century. In Columbia university in 1920 had a 40% Jewish enrollment rate according to Oliver Pollak. Since most Jewish students at the time were poor, worked night jobs to pay their tuition and lived at home, Columbia required students to live in dormitories in campus as well as limited scholarships. Columbia also began to conduct interviews in admissions process and according to Oppenheimer, university representatives detected accents or telling signs of Jewish origin even if the name of the applicant was not clearly Jewish. According to Nadell, elite Protestants students began to abandon Columbia due to its changing culture, after the initiation of the program Columbia halved the number of Jewish students within two years. In Harvard Jews composed about 22% of the student population in 1922. Harvard began a geographic diversity program to enroll students from states with low numbers of Jews. Harvard president Abbott Lawrence Lowell, according to historians James Davidson and Deborah Coe, was \"the most significant proponent of restricting Jewish admissions\".\nUS admissions tests were designed to fit a White Protestant elite education with questions on Classical subjects as well as Greek and Latin which were not taught in schools in which the Jews and other immigrants learned. Yale, Dartmouth and other universities introduced legacy admissions that favored the Protestant elite.\nAccording to sociologist, Stephen Steinberg, Jews were most commonly restricted through character and psychological exams. Jews were often given descriptors that were in contrast to the values which the universities sought and those Jews who managed to prove they exhibited such values were considered \"pushy\". School administrators who were mostly Protestant would characterize Jews with stereotypes and prevented their entry to universities.\nStanford University under President Marc Tessier-Lavigne admitted in 2022 of having limited the admission of Jewish students in the 1950s which he called \"appalling antisemitic behavior\". According to the Stanford committee, Stanford stopped or limited recruiting students from schools with high ratios of Jewish students. Between 1949 and 1952 following the introduction of the quota for example the number of students enrolled from Beverly Hills High School declined from 67 to 20 while Fairfax declined from 20 to 1. Stanford also misled investigations, parents and alumni who inquired for decades.\nIn the 1970s quotas on Jews gradually disappeared and admission of students of Jewish origin rose in American higher education.\nIn the late 20th century, Holocaust deniers were given a platform to run disinformation campaigns in multiple student run newspapers as well as through visits to universities. According to the ADL, through principles of academic freedom and student activism extremists and antisemitic rhetoric were allowed a say in university campuses. According to ADL this forced universities to directly fight antisemitism and extremism.\n\n\n== 21st century ==\nIn 2001 the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement began to pressure American universities to cut ties with Israeli academics and from Israel. Although such efforts mostly failed, the US Civil Rights commission issued a report in 2005 which states that \"antisemitism persists on college campuses and is often cloaked as criticism of Israel\". Jewish students were said to often feel isolated and targeted for harassment by BDS activists.\nIn 2022 the American Jewish Congress released a report stating that a third of Jewish students felt unsafe or uncomfortable in campus due to their Jewish identity.\nIn northern autumn 2023, before the October 7th attack a Palestinian literature festival was held in Penn campus, critics of the event pointed to controversial guests including Roger Waters who had called for the destruction of Israel as well as used antisemitic language.\n\n\n=== Following the October 7th attacks ===\nFollowing the October 7th attack on Israel, Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) celebrated the attack and said that all Israeli Jews were legitimate targets. The organization is supported and financially sponsored by the American Muslims for Palestine which according toe the Foundation for Defense of Democracies is linked to Hamas. A bipartisan group of lawmakers called for a federal investigation in funding of SJP. Columbia university and Rutgers university suspended the SJP chapter in their university in late 2023. In late November 2023, the center for Antisemitism research found that 73% of Jewish college students and 43.9% of non-Jewish students experienced or witnessed antisemitism in the 2023–2024 school year.\nIn the first 16 days after the October 7th massacres by Hamas against Israel there was an increase of 400% in antisemitic incidents, including assault, harassment and vandalism against Jews in the United States, the Washington Post said that some of the most visible instances of antisemitism occurred in US campuses.\nIn 2023 the American Jewish Congress released a report that found that 44% of Jewish students were affected by antisemitism on campus. 25% of Jewish students avoided wearing or displaying items that could identify them as Jewish. More than 50% of Jewish students were excluded or felt excluded from other students more than once.\nOf the non-Jewish students targeted 46% said it was because they were assumed to be Jewish. According to the research centre only 38.6% of Jewish students reported feeling comfortable in universities compared to 63.7% prior to the October 7th attack on Israel. A majority of students, Jews and non-Jews reported feeling their campus administration did not do enough to fight anti Jewish prejudice. Only 45.5% of Jewish students said they felt physically safe and 32.5% emotionally safe in universities.\nThe center also found that only 18% of American students underwent any training related to anti-Jewish prejudice compared to 55.8% having undergone DEI training.\n\nIn December 2023, President of Harvard, MIT and Penn testified before congress regarding the state of antisemitism in their universities and were asked if \"calling for the genocide of Jews\" is against the codes of conduct in Penn, MIT and Harvard. The three presidents answered that it was a violation depending on the context. The President of Harvard, Claudine Gay and president of Penn, Magill subsequently resigned following criticism. In December 2023, The United States Congress launched an investigation into antisemitism at the American universities.\nIn late 2023 the New York Times reported that some Jews in Harvard have stopped wearing openly Jewish headwear.  In the New York Times article, Mark Oppenheimer noted in light of the history of antisemitic quotas against Jews in Harvard, \"To see newly resurgent antisemitism against this backdrop of fairly recent, wonderful acceptance is a very, very painful thing for a lot of Jews,\". Dr Gay after her resignation apologized for her testimony in congress as well as saying that chants heard in Harvard such as \"globalize the intifada\" and \"from the river to the sea\" are antisemitic and a call for violence against Jews. A Jewish student told the New York Times that some students may have different definitions for their chants and gave the benefit of the doubt while another student remarked that after October 7 there has been a major shift and felt the campus was an alien place, saying his classmates explicitly praised Hamas and denied the rape and abduction of Israeli women.\nIn late 2023 a protest that began in the outskirt of Penn campus resulted in the targeting of a Jewish owned restaurant in Philadelphia.\nIn 2024 American President Joe Biden and US vice president Harris condemned antisemitism in campuses.\nIn April 2024 Columbia university barred Israeli professor Shai Davidai a supporter of Jewish students rights on US campuses, from access to the main part of campus, Columbia university's COO said this was done to maintain community safety. Davidai wrote on X formerly known as Twitter \"To the best of my knowledge, the last time that a professor was denied access to their own university for being Jewish was Nazi Germany\". Students called for intifada,  as well as calling for Hamas brigades to kill Israeli soldiers. Some protestors called to burn Tel Aviv, a major Israeli city known for its liberal culture, to the ground. Anti Israel activists also sang \"Oh Hamas, our beloved, strike strike Tel Aviv\".  Students also chanted \"Go Hamas, we love you. We support your rockets too\". The Palestine Solidarity Working group said that militancy breeds resistance as well as praised Hamas' attack against Israel. The Jews of New York Instagram shared a video of a woman protestor with a sign reading \"Al-Qassam's next targets\" pointing toward a counter protest waving Israeli and American flags.\nAnti Israel protestors also called for Jews on campus to \"Go back to Europe, you have no culture. All you do is colonize\". A counter protest was taunted with calls of \"Jews\" and \"Go back to Poland\". According to Jerusalem Post, a Jewish counter protestor tried to stop anti Israel activists from burning an Israeli flag while another Jew was splashed with water. The anti Israel protestors also proclaimed \"From the water to the water (a reference to the Jordan river and the Mediterranean), Palestine is Arab\" which is considered a call for the cleansing of the region from Jews and the denial of Jewish rights for self-sovereignty in their ancestral homeland.\nJewish students in Columbia reported feeling unsafe, being spit on and feeling relief at leaving the university. A student told Jerusalem Post that they felt their student representatives did not represent their grievances. A protestor yelled at Jewish students \"The 7th of October is going to be every day for you!\". Seth Mandel wrote in the \"Commentary\" that universities were teaching students that Jews must be supplanted from their homes because they represent a race that belongs elsewhere which according to Mandel is the reason why Jews were told to go back to Poland by students in Columbia. SJP had celebrated the October 7th attack and called for the targeting of Jewish Israelis and both SJP WOL which have both called for the destruction of Israel and the targeting of Jewish Israelis, helped organize the protests in Columbia.\nThe Anti-Defamation League graded 85 American universities in 2024 regarding policies to protect Jewish students from antisemitism on campus. 12 universities including Harvard, MIT, Stanford, University of Chicago, Princeton and others received an F. Two schools received an A. Columbia and Penn university received a D in the ADL ranking. Brandeis and Elon received an A in the ADL ranking.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAntisemitism in Columbia University\n\n\n== Citations ==",

Spearheaded by Pallavi Patel of Apna Dal (Kamerawadi) and AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi, this alliance aims to champion the interests of marginalized communities.\nIn addition to AIMIM and Apna Dal (Kamerawadi), the PDM alliance includes other parties like Premchand Bind's Pragatisheel Manav Samaj Party and Rashtriya Uday Party. This development follows the dissolution of ties between the Samajwadi Party (SP) and Apna Dal (Kamerawadi), which surfaced amid differences over candidate selection.\nThe rift between the SP and Apna Dal (K) came to light during the February Rajya Sabha polls when Apna Dal (K) leader and SP MLA, Pallavi Patel, refused to support two SP candidates. Patel cited alleged deviations from the SP's PDA (Pichda, Dalit, Alpasankhyak) formula in candidate nominations. Apna Dal (K) traces its roots back to the Apna Dal, founded by OBC leader Dr. Sone Lal Patel, whose legacy persists despite his passing in a tragic road accident in 2009.\n\n\n== Candidates ==\non 13 April PDM Declared its 7 seats.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Dönnhoffstädt Palace (German: Schloss Dönnhoffstädt or Polish: Pałac rodu von Dönhoff w Drogoszach or Polish: Pałac w Drogoszach) is a baroque palace in Drogosze, in the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship in Poland. Formerly, it was part of East Prussia. The palace was constructed between 1710 and 1714, and it was the seat of the Dönhoff family, members of the Prussian nobility. The palace was one of the so-called 'royal palaces' of East Prussia, which could be used by the king of Prussia while travelling around. Due to its 100 metres wide façade, it was the largest palace in Masuria and one of the largest in East Prussia as well.\nToday, the palace is in poor condition and deteriorating. Also, the landscape park is fully neglected.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 17th century and before: Creation of the estate and a renaissance castle ===\nOriginally, the lands where the village of Drogosze stands today belonged to German colonizers. On land received from the Teutonic Order, a member of a Saxon noble family, Konrad von Wolffersdorff, founded a settlement in 1361, which he named Groß Wolfsdorf.\nSubsequently, in 1477, the estates passed into the hands of the Von Rautter family. Ludwig Rautter (1542–1614) built a renaissance castle here between 1596 and 1606. Already at that time, there was a large deer park covering an area of 76 hectares, a gift from the Polish king John II Casimir Vasa (1609–1672).\n\n\n=== 18th century: A new name and a baroque palace ===\nIn 1690, the castle was struck by lightning and burned down. The remains were demolished in 1711.\nIn the same period, the estate passed hands from the Rautter family to the Dönhoff family, a Westphalian family who in the 14th century had moved to Livonia. Count Friedrich von Dönhoff (1639–1696) married the last member from the Rautter family and subsequently acquired the Groß Wolfsdorf estate. Their son, count Boguslaw Friedrich von Dönhoff decided to construct a new palace. He changed the name of the palace and estate to Dönhoffstadt, while leaving the name of the village unchanged.\nThe new palace was constructed near the site of the old castle. It was built on a raised platform between 1710 and 1716. The design was by the architect John von Collas, who modelled it after Friedrichstein Palace near Königsberg, a design by the architect Jean de Bodt. Friedrichstein was the main residence of the Dönhoff family and was erected by Boguslaw's brother, count Otto Magnus von Dönhoff.\nWhen travelling through Prussia, the kings of Prussia often stayed at the palace, as it was safe and comfortably.\nDuring the 18th century, various additions were made. In 1725, a chapel was constructed in the left wing. In 1766, new outbuildings were added basis plans by Gotthold Wilhelm Maurach. A little later, in place of the previously existing mirror stairs, a wide representative driveway for carriages was built leading to the main entrance, decorated with fountains, flower pots and sculptures.\n\n\n=== 19th century: Stolberg-Wernigerode ===\nIt remained the property of the Dönhoff counts until 1816 when the last heir, count Stanislaus Otto von Dönhoff, died at the age of 20 years in a duel with the student Friedrich von Saldern in Göttingen. Upon the division of his inheritance, his five sisters divided the extensive family estate. Angélique Dönhoff inherited the estate with Schloss Dönhoffstadt. Later, she married count Georg von Dohna-Lauck, transferring the property to the Dohna noble family.\nIn 1863, Angélique Dönhoff's niece, countess Marianne zu Stolberg-Wernigerode, inherited the vast Dönhoffstadt estate. Her descendants inhabited it until 1945. Her son was count Udo zu Stolberg-Wernigerode, a prominent president of the German Reichstag and opponent of the Nazis, who also owned an estate in Silesia, named Kreppelhof. Last owner was count Albrecht zu Stolberg-Wernigerode (1886–1948).\nAt the end of World War II, the Stolberg-Wernigerode family fled from Dönhoffstädt. The palace was plundered and most of its treasures were lost. And subsequently, the estate and palace were confiscated.\n\n\n=== Modern times: Decline ===\nWhen the southern part of East Prussia came under Polish administration after World War II, the palace was used as an agricultural school from 1954 to 1991. A restoration took place in 1975. Much of the beautiful stucco and monumental fireplaces have been preserved. Unfortunately, a large part of the interior has been lost due to looting and vandalism. Beautiful ceiling paintings still exist in two rooms on the first floor overlooking the park.\nSince 1993, the castle has been privately owned and vacant. It is threatened by decay because the owner has not carried out any maintenance. Plans to convert the castle into a hotel have not been realized so far.\nRemnants of the archive are now located in the archives in Olsztyn. The Dönhoffstädt library, two trucks filled with books, including two Egyptian papyrus scrolls and a guest book with notes from Napoleon Bonaparte and Emperor Wilhelm II, were given to the university of Toruń after World War II. What remained of the furniture and paintings is now located in the palace of Morąg and the Olsztyn museum.\n\n\n== Architecture: the Versailles of East Prussia ==\nIn 1701, Prussia was elevated from ducal status to royal status, and its new king, Frederick I of Prussia (1657–1713), wished to see his kingdom to be provided with some magnificent baroque palaces for reasons of cultural representation. Hence, the East Prussian nobility constructed a range of so-called ‘royal palaces’. The counts von Dönhoff created Friedrichstein and Dönhoffstadt. The counts Dohna built Schlobitten and Schlodien. The counts Finck von Finckenstein erected Finckenstein Palace, and the counts Waldburg constructed Capustigall.\nJohn von Collas modelled Dönhoffstadt after schloss Friedrichstein near Königsberg. The main block was similar, but the wings were extended creating a façade of 100 metres wide. It became one of the largest palaces in East Prussia. The castle was also known as the Versailles of East Prussia.\nThe palace had four columns representing the four seasons, 12 chimneys representing the 12 months, 52 rooms representing the 52 weeks in a year, 365 windows representing the 365 days in a year, and 7 balconies representing the 7 days of the week.\nThe palace had its own theatre in the western wing. The eastern wing housed an extensive library and a chapel. Around 1830, the chapel was first transformed into Neo-Gothic style, and a few years later (around 1850), the entire palace was renovated.\nAbove the entrance there is a colorful and richly decorated cartouche of the coat of arms of the Stolberg-Wernigerode family with the date 1902. The roof of the main building is of a mansard structure, while the side wings added in 1766 are covered with a gable roof.\n\n\n== Park ==\n\nThe site is surrounded by a landscape park, which has now lost its original composition and gently transitions into the forest. There are several ponds with artificial islands in its area, and in a slightly further area, in the forest, deer breeding was carried out from 1690, which was later created as a reserve. In the park in the immediate vicinity of the palace, from the garden side, there is a large plaque commemorating the faithful servants of the estate and a monument to the Stolberg-Wernigrode family\nRemnants of the baroque garden, in the form of sandstone sculptures and vases, were preserved in the vicinity of the palace until 1945.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Literature ==\nSieber, Helmut (1958).

        "content": "Perthshire Society of Natural Science (PSNS) is one of the oldest scientific societies in Scotland, having been established in 1867. Under its parent body, it has four sections covering botany, ornithology, archaeology and history and photography.\n\nNow based at the A. K. Bell Library in Perth, Scotland, the society was founded by eighteen women, and by the end of the 19th century, around a quarter of its members were female.\nWhereas specimens were physically collected by the society's members during its early years, now digital photography is used, along with digital data, to create records.\nIn 1935, the society donated paintings and natural-history collections to Perth Museum and Art Gallery to display in its new extension, which was opened by the Duke and Duchess of York, the future King George VI and Queen Elizabeth.\nThe society undertook an excavation at Pitmiddle village (whose history dates to the 12th century) and Elcho Nunnery, and published its report in 1988.\nThe society's longest-serving member is Rhoda Fothergill, who died in 2019. She joined in 1965, and was its secretary when she retired 47 years later. Many of her papers, such as A History of King James VI Hospital, were published in the journals of the PSNS. Other notable past members include Charles Macintosh, who was known as \"the Perth Naturalist\".\nThe society published The Flora of Perthshire, by Francis Buchanan White, in 1898, using records provided by members, including Macintosh. White identified thirteen species of fungi previously unknown in the British Isles, four of them new to science. He shared this interest with Beatrix Potter, who had often visited the area since she was a child, and they exchanged specimens and drawings. He left his collection of specimens, together with some botanical illustrations by Beatrix Potter, to Perth Museum.\nArchitect John Young was one of the society's early members. His son, George, also joined the society.\nSir Thomas Moncreiffe, 7th Baronet, was a president of the society. The building's museum, formerly at 62–72 Tay Street in Perth, was built in his memory in 1881, two years after his death.\nAnother former president was W. H. Findlay, a noted photographer. Around a quarter of his lifetime collection of 25,000 photographs are now housed in A. K. Bell Library, with the rest in the society's possession. Fellow photographer Magnus Jackson became a member in 1877.\nAs of 2024, the society's president is David Bowler. He was preceded in the role by Nancy Boyd.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "NDHU Graduate Institute of Marine Biology (Chinese: 國立東華大學海洋生物研究所, abbreviated NDHU IMB) was established in 2005. Originally known as the National Dong Hwa University College of Marine Sciences, it is located in Kenting National Park, Taiwan, and was Taiwan's first partnership model between university and museum. NDHU IMB was co-founded by National Dong Hwa University (NDHU) and National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium (NMMBA), and is part of NDHU College of Environmental Studies and Oceanography, operating as an independent research institute in the field of oceanography. It offers MS in Marine Biotechnology (MBT) and Marine Biodiversity and Evolution (MBE) and PhD in Marine Biology.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== NDHU College of Marine Sciences ===\nNDHU College of Marine Sciences originated from the university's founding proposal, which included plans to establish a college of marine sciences. Similar collaborations between prestigious schools and museums abroad, such as USA's University of California, San Diego with Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO), France's University of Paris with Paris Museum of Natural History (MNHN), and UK's University of Bristol with Natural History Museum, London (NHM), have been successful in nurturing graduate's research talent. The National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium has also built a substantial capacity for scientific research and social education reputation since its establishment. Therefore, NDHU College of Marine Sciences was founded under the promotion by the 2nd President of National Dong Hwa University, Wen-Shu Hwang, and Founding Director of National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium, Lee-Shing Fang.\nIn 2004, National Dong Hwa University and National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium formally signed a partnership agreement, establishing the NDHU College of Marine Sciences at the newly established National Dong Hwa University Pingtung Campus (within NMMBA). This 'independent establishment, cooperative education' model was the first of its kind in Taiwan. The campus originally housed two institutes: Graduate Institute of Marine Biotechnology and Graduate Institute of Marine Biodiversity and Evolution. In 2014, these two institutes were merged into a single Graduate Institute of Marine Biology, with divisions for Marine Biotechnology (MBT) and Marine Biodiversity and Evolution (MBE). In 2017, NDHU IMB launched a Ph.D. program in Marine Biology.\n\n\n=== NDHU College of Environmental Studies and Oceanography ===\nIn 2022, NDHU College of Environmental Studies and Oceanography (NDHU CESO) was established through integrating NDHU College of Marine Sciences and NDHU College of Environmental Studies in response to the global trend of interdisciplinary integration in sustainable development involving environmental studies and oceanography. NDHU Graduate Institute of Marine Biology became an independent research institute under NDHU CESO. In 2023, Pei-Jie Meng, Vice Dean of NDHU College of Environmental Studies and Oceanography, took over as Director of Taiwan Ocean Research Institute (TORI).\n\n\n== Academics ==\n\n\n=== NDHU Graduate Institute of Marine Biology ===\n\nThe NDHU Graduate Institute of Marine Biology (IMB) originally consisting of the Marine Biotechnology Institute and the Marine Biodiversity and Evolution Institute in 2005, later merged into Graduate Institute of Marine Biology. NDHU IMB is Located in Checheng Township, Pingtung County, within National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium, and situated in Kenting National Park, where is the resource-rich marine environment surrounded by coral reefs and diverse tropical marine life, NMMBA provides academic research facilities and doctoral level faculty, allowing students to directly utilize these resources for research and learning.\n\n\n==== Research Themes ====\nAquaculture research\nCnidarian cell, molecular biology, physiology, and biochemistry studies\nIntegrated research and education on coral reef ecology conservation\nExhibition biology and environmental science\nMarine natural compounds\nMarine biodiversity\n\n\n=== Academic programs ===\n\n\n==== M.S. in Marine Biotechnology ====\nThe MS program in Marine Biotechnology at NDHU IMB requiring 26 credits including 12 mandatory credits, 14 elective professional credits, and an academic thesis.\n\n\n==== M.S. in Marine Biodiversity and Evolutionary Biology ====\nThe MS program in Marine Biodiversity and Evolutionary Biology at NDHU IMB requiring 26 credits including 13 mandatory credits, 13 elective professional credits, and an academic thesis.\n\n\n==== Ph.D. Program in Marine Biology ====\nThe PhD program in Marine Biology at NDHU IMB requires 30 credits, including 25 mandatory professional credits, 5 elective professional credits, and academic thesis.\n\n\n=== Facilities ===\nRV Jiangshu (Chinese: 絳樹號海洋研究船) is Taiwan's first vassel dedicated to Marine Research, which was launched in 2023 by National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium. NDHU IMB leverage its Remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) capability to achieve research at a maximum depth of 500 meters underwater.\n\n\n== Publications ==\n\n\n=== Academic Journal ===\nPlatax: Published by National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium\n\n\n=== Books ===\nDrifters of the Sea\nFish Atlas of Southern Taiwan (Volume One)\nFish Atlas of Southern Taiwan (Volume Two)\nPeninsula Crabs 2.0\nSea Slugs of Taiwan\nThe Truth About Seafood\n\n\n== References ==\n\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Chalabilar Mosque- is a local significant historical and architectural monument dating back to the 17th century, located in the village of Çələbilər in Jabrayil district.\nThe mosque was included in the list of local significant immovable historical and cultural monuments by decision No. 132 of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Azerbaijan on August 2, 2001.\n\n\n== About ==\nChalabilar Mosque is located in the village of Chalabilar in Jabrayil district. It was built in 1678 by Muhammad ibn Haji Garaman Ahmed. The mosque also served as a madrasa where both religious and secular subjects were taught. The Azerbaijani poet Molla Vali Vidadi, who lived in the 18th century, also taught at this madrasa.\nFollowing the Soviet occupation of Azerbaijan, official anti-religious campaigns began in 1928. In December of that year, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan transferred many mosques, churches, and synagogues to the balance of educational clubs for secular purposes. If there were approximately 3,000 mosques in Azerbaijan in 1917, by 1927, the number decreased to 1,700, and by 1933, it was reduced to 17. Chalabilar Mosque also ceased its activities after the Soviet occupation.\nAfter Azerbaijan regained its independence, the mosque was included in the list of local significant immovable historical and cultural monuments by decision No. 132 of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Azerbaijan on August 2, 2001. Until the occupation of Jabrayil district, the Chalabilar Mosque-Madrasa complex was restored and brought back to its original form. However, after the village of Chalabilar was occupied by the Armenian Armed Forces in 1993, the complex was burned and looted by Armenians, rendering the mosque building unusable. On October 26, 2020, the village was liberated from occupation by the Armed Forces of Azerbaijan.\n\n\n== See also ==\nKhudafarin Bridges\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The autograph of Nicolaus Copernicus' De revolutionibus is a manuscript of six books of De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (1543) by Nicolaus Copernicus written between 1520 and 1541. Since 1956, it is kept in the Jagiellonian Library in Kraków (signature 10,000).\nThe autograph was handwritten by Nicolaus Copernicus in Latin and Greek, using humanistic cursive. The manuscript consists of 213 paper leaves sized 28 × 19 centimeters, two endpapers, and four protective cards. The binding of the manuscript dates back to the early 17th century and is made of cardboard glued with waste paper and a parchment document from the 16th century.\nIt is a unique object on a global scale, inscribed in 1999 on the UNESCO Memory of the World list. It is also the most valuable and famous autograph kept in the collections of the Jagiellonian Library of the Jagiellonian University, of which it has been the property since 1956.\nThe text of the autograph, which was first published in 1543 in Nuremberg in the first edition of De revolutionibus orbium coelestium, revolutionized the perception of the universe from a historical point of view and was a starting point for modern astronomy and science.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe autograph contains the text of the six books authored by Nicolaus Copernicus that make up the work De revolutionibus.\n\n\n=== Contents of the manuscript of De revolutionibus ===\n\nLeaf 1 contains the incipit: (I)nter multa ac varia litteraturum artiumaque studia, Leaf 1 verso: Capitulum primum. Quod mundus sit sphaericus. Principio advertendum nobisest globusm est mundum.\nLeaf 212 verso contains the explicit: remanebit praepollens latitudo quaesita.\n\n\n=== Provenance notes ===\n\nThe endpaper of the front cover contains an ex libris with the coat of arms of the Nostitz family and the inscription:Ex Bibliotheca Maioratus Familiae Nostitzianae 1774Below the ex libris, there is a note written in ink over the previous one made in pencil, stating:Das Manuscript enthält: 212 Blätter, ausserdem 3 Vorblätter von denen das 1-e leer ist, das 2-e die Aufzählung der verschiedenen Eigenthümer und das 3-e Blatt den Namhen Otto F. v. Nostitz\n\nThe inserted leaf b contains a note attributed to Jakob Christmann:Venerabilis et eximii Iuris utriusque Doctoris, Dni Nicolai Copernick Canonici Varmiensis, in Borussia Germaniae mathematici celeberrimi opus de revolutionibus coelestibus propria manu exparatum et haectenus in bibliotheca Georgii Ioachimii Rhetici item Valentini Othonis conservatum, ad usum studii mathematici procurauit M. Iakobus Christmannus Decanus Facultatis artium, anno 1603, die 19 DecembrisThe reverse side of leaf b contains a note by John Amos Comenius:Hunc librum a vidua pie defuncti M. Jac. Cristmanni digno redemptum pretio, in suam transtulit Bibliothecam Johannes Amos Nivanus: Anno 1614. 17 Januarii. Heidelbergae.On leaf c, there is the signature Otto F. v. Nostitz mp.\n\n\n=== Paper ===\nThe manuscript consists of four types of paper with characteristic watermarks designated in the literature by letters: C, D, E, and F. These symbols were used in their descriptions by Ludwik Birkenmajer, followed by his son Aleksander Birkenmajer.\n\n\n==== Types of paper used for the manuscript of De revolutionibus ====\n\nPapers of different types occur irregularly in the manuscript.\n\n\n==== Type C paper ====\nPaper C is the oldest used in the manuscript. Its watermark depicts a rather thick snake, resembling the stance and curvature of a seahorse, with its head bent beyond the axis towards the margin, while its tail points in the opposite direction, although its end is also directed towards the margin. On the snake's head, there is a fleur-de-lis resembling a crown, and a tongue protrudes from its mouth directed upwards and ending in a blade-shaped tip. The snake's body is divided by a dorsal line into two parts, which are further divided into segments by oblique horizontal lines descending downwards. In Charles Briquet's catalogue, the most similar watermark is cataloged as number 10,738.\nAs established, this watermark was often found on papers from southern France, Spain, and Italy in the 15th and 16th centuries. However, the most similar ones to those found in the De revolutionibus manuscript were discovered on paper known from Middelburg from 1525. There, an even earlier paper was discovered, with a watermark featuring a similar depiction of the snake's tongue, dated to 1520.\nDating the paper is also facilitated by the fact that the text written on paper C, on leaf 88 verso, discusses an astronomical observation made by Copernicus on 11 March 1516. The occurrence of paper C ends on leaf 89.\n\n\n==== Type D paper ====\nPaper D contains a watermark depicting a hand protruding from a cross with 9 pinnacles, with fingers raised upwards and spread out, placed beneath a crown. This paper is of inferior quality. Analysis of watermarks on similar paper has shown its origin from the town of Tulle in France, dating back to the years 1523 and 1526. Presumably, this paper reached Copernicus through the Netherlands, similar to paper C. In Charles Briquet's catalogue, the most similar watermarks are cataloged as number 10,944 and 10,946.\nOn paper D, Copernicus provided information and comments on astronomical observations from 27 September 1522 (leaf 128), 22 February 1523 (leaf 166), and 12 March 1529 (leaf 173). It is assumed that this paper was used by Copernicus from 1523 to 1533. Paper D occurs between leaves 9 and 192.\n\n\n==== Type E paper ====\nPaper E contains a watermark in the shape of the letter P, with a fleuron placed above it. This watermark is almost identical to the one known from Maastricht in 1540. However, this paper reached Copernicus earlier, as he wrote letters in August 1537 and March 1539, and extensive portions of the manuscript were written on this paper before 1540. Paper E occurs between leaves 22 and 213. In Charles Briquet's catalogue, the most similar watermark is cataloged as number 8,698.\n\n\n==== Type F paper ====\nPaper F contains a watermark similar to the one on paper D. It depicts a hand with fingers spread out, with a sleeve ending in a circular fold, above which is a three-leaf clover. This watermark has been identified in full accordance with other watermarks on papers from Osnabrück from 1538 and from Lorraine from 1540. Copernicus used the same paper in a letter to Duke Albert of Prussia dated 15 June 1541. Pages from paper F were therefore used in either 1540 or 1541.\nIn Charles Briquet's catalogue, the most similar watermark is cataloged as number 11,466. This watermark appears only once – on leaf 24, but paper F was used three times – on leaves 24, 25, and 209.\n\n\n=== Sections ===\nThe paper block containing Copernicus' autograph is divided into 21 sections, which were marked in the 16th century with consecutive letters of the Latin alphabet from a to x. The numbering of the pages in individual sections was probably added around 1854 in the Nostitz Library, as the list of the number and completeness of the manuscript's leaves placed under the ex libris dates from the same year.\n\n\n==== Characteristics of sections in the manuscript of De revolutionibus ====\n\nThe notation of the sections with letters occurred in the final stage of editing the autograph. Aleksander Birkenmajer expressed the view that for many years of working on the autograph, Copernicus completely managed without any numbering of its leaves or notebooks.\nThe letter signatures of the sections, except for the letter a on leaf 1, were applied by Copernicus in 1539.\nResearchers paid particular attention to the absence of the first leaf from paper D in section a, which was very carefully cut out – almost without a visible trace – and its remaining edge was glued to the preceding protective leaf.\nAleksander Birkenmajer leans towards the view that the leaf, conventionally called zero, served for some time as the title page of Copernicus' work. Presumably, the leaf was removed during the binding of the manuscript, in 1603 or 1604 in Heidelberg.\nThe content of the zero leaf remains unknown. It is not known whether it contained only the title written by Copernicus' hand, or perhaps a dedication or notes about the history of the autograph or its successive owners. It cannot be ruled out that the zero leaf contained some glaring damage, stains, or doubtful notes. The structure of the autograph itself and the changes made by Copernicus in individual sections suggest that if Copernicus himself removed the zero leaf, he would have replaced it with another leaf and corrected the content on it.\nCopernicus made frequent changes in the structure of the sections. He most often exchanged and rewrote sheets, and sometimes added additional leaves within the section. As a result, various types of paper from different periods of its acquisition are encountered in different sections.\n\n\n=== Writing ===\n\nThe autograph is written by the hand of Nicolaus Copernicus in humanistic cursive. Marginalia and interlinear notes made by Georg Joachim Rheticus are found on leaves 21, 24, 71, 72, 188, and presumably 87 verso and 187 verso. Leaves 107 verso and 109 contain marginalia – two words written in the 17th century, attributed to Jakob Christmann.\nOne of the primary pieces of evidence supporting the assertion that this is Copernicus' handwritten autograph is a note attributed to Jakob Christmann: Nicolai Copernik [...] opus [...] propria manu exaratum.\nTo confirm or exclude the authenticity of Nicolaus Copernicus' handwriting, various autographs of Copernicus were examined, including, in particular, his letters, which serve as unquestionable and authoritatively attributed comparative material. Six handwritten letters of Nicolaus Copernicus to Johannes Dantiscus, preserved in Kraków and held at the National Museum in Kraków, were selected for this analysis. These letters were written over three years – 1536 and 1539 – between the ages of 63 and 66, and they bear his signature and date. The signature and handwriting are undoubtedly original.\nAs a comparative material for De revolutionibus, handwritten notes made and signed by Copernicus, providing samples of his handwriting from the years 1503, 1511, 1512, 1513, 1518, 1521, and 1529, were also considered. These notes, which raise no doubts about authorship or authenticity, have been preserved in the accounts of the Warmia Chapter and in the locational entries of Locationes mansorum desertorum. Their chronology complements the chronology covered by Copernicus' letters.\nFrom the comparison of Copernicus' handwriting samples from 1503 to 1541, written between the ages of 30 and 68, it can be inferred that this is the handwriting of a mature individual, with well-formed shapes and no significant differences dependent on chronology. There are no signs of immature handwriting in these examples, even in later years.\nDuring the examination of the De revolutionibus autograph, Birkenmajer identified certain differences depending on the speed at which Copernicus wrote: Two ducts of handwriting appear in the autograph: a hasty but well-shaped and legible cursive, and a calmer, more vertical handwriting, which is a typical humanistic antiqua.\nThe most noticeable are the characteristic shapes of letters, their inclinations, elements of cursive writing, the sweep of the handwriting, the direction of pen strokes, and the spacing of lines and margins. The analysis also revealed that in certain periods and fixed records of the autograph, some characteristics became fixed.\nCopernicus did not adhere to the custom of a fixed number of lines per page, as professional copyists of manuscripts contemporaneous to him did. The number of lines per page varies between 37 and 43. The text block averages 19 centimeters in width and 28 centimeters in height.\nThe autograph text is primarily written in ink shades ranging from brown to full black. Red ink was used in the tables crossed out from leaves 15 verso to 70 verso.\nExaminers emphasize that the notation style indicates the writer's preference for order, cleanliness, and harmonious arrangement of text columns and accompanying drawings. Despite the aesthetic form of the manuscript, some strange mistakes were found. Between leaves 125 and 175, Copernicus incorrectly wrote the word iusta instead of iuxta at least six times. This error was described as an interesting case of perpetuating a once-made mistake and unconsciously repeating it.\nMany ink stains and blots of various sizes appear on clean and carefully written leaves. From their distribution, it is inferred that they were created during later erasures and corrections made in haste.\nGeometric drawings, of which there are 162 in the entire manuscript, distributed over 129 pages, also deserve attention. The drawings are also made by the hand of Nicolaus Copernicus, as evidenced by the style of letters used to label them. The drawings are made carefully, using a compass and ruler, although minor flaws occasionally occborn Copernicus extensively uses lines in astronomical tables, which appear on 118 pages of the manuscript.\nThe conclusion of the conducted research was that the handwriting of the De revolutionibus manuscript is – except for minor foreign annotations – the handwritten autograph of Nicolaus Copernicus.\n\n\n=== Binding ===\n\nDuring the work on the De revolutionibus autograph, the section and leaves accumulated by Copernicus did not have a binding. Presumably – according to the customs prevailing in that era – Copernicus stored loose sections of his work in a cover such as a bag, envelope, or folder made of leather or parchment. It could also have been a box or chest. This is indicated by the significantly greater dirtiness of the external leaves of the sections, which was the result of their separate storage.\nThe cover of the manuscript consists of 4 protective leaves (a, b, c, and d) and 2 endpapers. However, it is more accurate to consider that the manuscript has an endpaper and protective leaf a at the beginning and protective leaf e and endpaper at the end because leaves b and c are not strictly protective leaves but substitutes for a title page.\nLeaf a was made from paper A, while cards b, c, and e were made from paper B.\nThe watermark of paper A depicts a large letter P, split at the bottom, with a rosette above it in the form of a four-petaled flower on a single stem. Below the letter is a faint drawing of an object – either a trumpet or a pine cone. In Briquet's catalog, the watermark most similar is cataloged as number 8,833.\nThe watermark of paper B depicts a heraldic shield cut by a horizontal band, above which is a rod pointing upwards topped with a three-leaf clover entwined by a snake sticking out its long tongue. In Briquet's catalog, the watermark most similar is cataloged as number 1,451.\nThese papers date from 1580 to 1600 and originate from Württemberg paper mills.\nDuring conservation work, after removing the endpaper, it was discovered that the cover made of cardboard consisting of parchment pulp under an external parchment cover contained a parchment document of Emperor Maximilian II from 1566 and a corrected printout of De inquisitione Hispanica, Heidelberg 1603.\nThe fact that correction leaves of a book published in 1603 were found inside the cover proves that the cover certainly was not made before that year, and at the same time, its creation could not have been too far from the 1603/1604 transition.\nBefore the binding from 1603/1604, the manuscript was neither sewn nor trimmed, and the current binding is its first binding.\n\n\n== History of the manuscript ==\n\nThe preserved form of the De revolutionibus autograph represents a certain stage in the work on this piece. It is the stage closest to completion and closest to the death of Nicolaus Copernicus, which occurred on 24 May 1543.\nThe preserved copy of the De revolutionibus autograph was not used for publishing purposes either in Wittenberg in 1542 or in Nuremberg in 1543 during the printing of the first edition, nor in Basel during the printing of the second edition. This is evidenced by the cleanliness of the manuscript and the absence of traces associated with contemporary printing work such as stains, marks, etc. Not only does the appearance of the manuscript indicate that it was not a copy used in the printing process, but also the lists of printer's errors included in the published copies and referring to a comparison with the manuscript, which contain words not present in the original autograph.\n\n\n=== Owners of the De revolutionibus manuscript and where it is stored ===\n\n\n=== Period from Copernicus' death to 1600 ===\nAfter Copernicus' death, his papers and books were inherited by his close friend Tiedemann Giese, the Bishop of Chełmno, and later, from 1548, the Bishop of Warmia. Giese passed away on 23 October 1550, and according to his will, his library was bequeathed to the Warmia Chapter.\nHowever, the De revolutionibus autograph did not end up in the chapter library. Instead, during Tiedemann Giese's lifetime, it came into the possession of Georg Joachim Rheticus (also known as von Lauchen). This could have happened as early as 1545 or as late as 1550.\nRheticus actually had access to the content of the autograph in the form of a copy even earlier, when in 1540 he published the first account of Copernicus' work in Gdańsk in the Narratio prima. He also used a copy of the De revolutionibus autograph when he published De lateribus et angulis triangulorum in Wittenberg in 1542, which was intended to be the second book of Copernicus' work for some time.\nThe exact moment when Georg Joachim Rheticus received the De revolutionibus autograph remains unknown. What is certain is that the remaining collection of Copernican materials in Tiedemann Giese's possession was transferred to the Warmia Chapter library.\nGeorg Joachim Rheticus undoubtedly played a major role in disseminating Copernicus' thoughts and works. It was under his influence that Copernicus agreed to publish his autograph and helped in making a copy of it. However, Copernicus did not directly pass on the autograph to Rheticus during his lifetime.\nIn 1551, Rheticus had to urgently leave Leipzig and abandon his further career at the university. Eventually, in 1554, he found himself in Kraków. Around 1569, Valentinus Otho, a student of Johannes Praetorius, joined Rheticus as his collaborator. During this time, the De revolutionibus autograph was in Kraków, together with Rheticus.\nShortly before his death, Georg Joachim Rheticus left Kraków for Košice, where he stayed as a guest of Albrecht Łaski, the voivode of Sieradz, and the Hungarian magnate Jan Rüber. During Rheticus' stay in Košice, Valentinus Otho brought the De revolutionibus manuscript from Kraków, left there by Rheticus. This happened on 28 November 1574. A few days later, on 4 December 1574, Georg Joachim Rheticus died, and Valentinus Otho became his heir and the next owner of the manuscript.\nOtho soon left Košice and sought new employment. He obtained a position as a professor of mathematics at the Calvinist University of Heidelberg. During his stay there, the De revolutionibus manuscript and other papers acquired from Rheticus were stored haphazardly among stacks of other books and papers. This disorderly state of storage was reported by Otho's associate, Bartholomaeus Pitiscus, in the preface to his work Thesaurus Mathematicus.\n\n\n=== From 1600 to 1945 ===\nWhen Valentinus Otho died, his collections were acquired by the orientalist professor Jakob Christmann, who wrote a note on leaf b attributed to him, stating ad usum studii mathematici procuravit dated 16 December 1603. It is likely that Christmann did not include the manuscript in the university library but instead kept it for personal use when Simon Petiscus, who held the chair of mathematics at the time, took possession of it. Petiscus died in 1608, and at that point, the manuscript most likely returned to Christmann's possession. Christmann unquestionably owned the manuscript at the time of his death on 16 June 1613, and his widow, who took over the manuscript, sold it to John Amos Comenius on 17 January 1614.\nComenius acquired the manuscript just over half a year after his enrollment at the Heidelberg University (which occurred on 19 June 1613). The purchase transaction was completed for an unspecified \"fair price\" paid to Christmann's widow. Comenius noted this information on leaf b verso of the manuscript, signing himself as Johannes Amos Nivanus (from his birthplace – Nivnice in Moravia). It is known that he resided in Poland several times (Leszno 1626–1641, Elbląg 1642–1648, again Leszno 1648–1656), but it is not known whether he had the De revolutionibus manuscript with him during any of his stays. The moment when Comenius lost Copernicus' autograph is also unknown.\nThe next owner of the De revolutionibus autograph was Otto von Nostitz. The autograph is mentioned in the inventory document of the Nostitz Library under the signature MS e 21 (leaf 360 verso) with an entry from 5 October 1667. This date is later than the moment when von Nostitz became the owner, as he had already passed away at the time of the entry, but he left his signature on the protective leaf c of the De revolutionibus autograph. At that time, the manuscript was kept at Jawor Castle.\nLater on, along with the Nostitz Library, the autograph became part of the estate created by them and was transferred to the Nostitz Palace in Prague. The autograph remained the property of the Nostitz family for nearly 300 years and was mentioned several times in the inventories of this library in the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\n\n=== From 1945 to the present day ===\nIn 1945, the Prague collections of the Nostitz family, along with the autograph of De revolutionibus, were nationalized. Eleven years later, on 5 July 1956, the government of Czechoslovakia offered this artifact as a gift to the Polish nation.\nOn 25 October 1956, the autograph of De revolutionibus by Nicolaus Copernicus was handed over to the Jagiellonian University in Kraków, and since then it has been kept in the special collections of the Jagiellonian Library.\nOwen Gingerich, who examined almost all copies of the first and second editions of De revolutionibus from 1543 from Nuremberg and from 1566 from Basel, and who saw the autograph in Kraków around 1976, states in his book that this priceless treasure was lent to Poland by Czechoslovakia, and the Poles simply kept it and deposited it in the Jagiellonian Library at the Alma Mater of Copernicus. Since it was not customary for one communist country to protest too vehemently against the conduct of a brother nation, the valuable manuscript remained in Poland.\nHowever, this opinion is not confirmed by the facts and is even contradictory to the findings in this regard made and conveyed by UNESCO.\n\n\n== Autograph storage in modern times ==\nThe autograph of De revolutionibus is stored in a secured, fireproof vault, in a specially prepared room within the Jagiellonian Library, where a constant temperature and humidity are maintained.\nProtection of objects from special collections is one of the most important statutory obligations of the university and the Jagiellonian Library. Direct access to the autograph of De revolutionibus is permitted only for scientific and editorial purposes.\nAccess to this object is strictly controlled and limited. According to the regulations governing access to special collections, independent academic staff and individuals with a doctoral degree, doctoral students, adjuncts, and assistants with a master's degree can use them after presenting a letter of recommendation from their supervisor or academic advisor. Students preparing master's theses can also access them after presenting a letter of recommendation from their supervisor, and employees of scientific, cultural institutions, or publishing houses can access them after presenting a letter of recommendation or a certificate informing about the research topic and purpose. Individuals outside of the above groups can only access the special collections with the permission of the head of the manuscripts department.\nDue to its unique value and the need for protection from external factors, the autograph of De revolutionibus is rarely displayed in public exhibitions. The last time this occurred was in 2012 during the 6th European Congress of Mathematics, and previously in 2005 during the Lesser Poland Days of Cultural Heritage.\nDuring the last exhibition, the autograph of De revolutionibus, as one of the most valuable treasures, was exhibited only temporarily, after which, for safety and conservation reasons, it was replaced with facsimile editions.\n\n\n== Facsimile editions ==\n\n\n=== 1944 – Munich ===\nThe facsimile was produced using the photolithography technique, in monochrome. This edition does not capture all the details of the original and has been assessed as not possessing significant aesthetic qualities.\nFull bibliographic information for the edition: Nicolaus Copernicus, Gesamtausgabe, vol. 1: Opus de revolutionibus caelestibus manu propria. Faksimile-Wiedergabe, München, Berlin 1944. Introduction by Fritz Kubach, afterword by Karl Zeller.\n\n\n=== 1972 – Kraków ===\nVolume I of the Complete Works of Nicolaus Copernicus, also published in foreign languages (Latin 1973, French 1973, Russian 1973), containing images of all pages of the autograph, printed on third-class offset paper. The volume is accompanied by an introduction by Jerzy Zathey. The publication was initiated on the occasion of the five hundredth anniversary of Nicolaus Copernicus' birth in 1973.\n\n\n=== 1974 – Hildesheim ===\nEdition of De revolutionibus: mit einem Vorwort zur Gesamtausgabe und einem Vorbericht über das Manuskript – the first volume containing a facsimile of the autograph.\n\n\n=== 1976 – Kraków ===\nThe reproduction was made using offset printing, using a halftone contact screen, ensuring full tonal compliance of the facsimile background with the original. The contact screen used allowed for the preservation of writing shades from brown to black and faithful reproduction of even small dots, spots, and distortions.\nPrinting was done on 120 gsm offset paper in shades adjusted to the four types of paper used in the manuscript. The dimensions of the pages are faithful to the original and cropped according to the prototype.\nThe fidelity of the reproduction to the original is as follows:\n\nBackground texture – 95%\nBackground shades – 90%\nLow black intensity writing texture – 85%\nBlack writing texture and shades – 95%\nRed writing shade and texture – 95%\nThis facsimile version looks so authentic that some people mistake it for the original when viewing it. Owen Gingerich mentions in his book about a certain bookseller from Chicago who donated the facsimile to the Adler Planetarium and wanted to deduct the value of the donation from taxes. Believing he was donating the original autograph of Copernicus, he asked Gingerich to appraise it.\n\n\n=== 1996 – electronic Neurosoft ===\nPublished as a \"digital reprint\" of the autograph. The publication consists of a CD-ROM containing images of all manuscript pages. It also includes an article by Marian Zwiercan entitled The History of Nicolaus Copernicus' De revolutionibus Autograph.\n\n\n=== De revolutionibus autograph online ===\nImages of all pages of Nicolaus Copernicus' De revolutionibus autograph are available in the online collections of the Jagiellonian Library.\n\n\n== Autograph on the Memory of the World list ==\nThe manuscript of De revolutionibus handwritten by Nicolaus Copernicus has been inscribed on the UNESCO Memory of the World list since 1999, as one of twelve Polish objects on the list and three hundred globally.\nThe entry emphasizes that De revolutionibus is one of the greatest achievements of an individual that shaped new eras and influenced the development of civilization and culture.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Studies ===\nBriquet, Charles M.

        "content": "Brave Inventors Platform is a non-governmental platform of Ukrainian military invention, bringing together Ukrainian inventors, investors, businesses, and volunteers. The platform was founded in December 2022. Its main project is the financing of UAV Punisher.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe project aims to support Ukrainian mil-tech manufacturers, promote scaling, and strengthen the local market of modern technologies and engineering solutions needed by the army. By the end of 2023, the platform numbers nearly 100 teams of manufacturers. They receive mentorship support, access to a base of investors and partners, find customers and like-minded people through the platform, and get recognition through international and leading Ukrainian media.\n\n\n== Inventions ==\nThe inventions include the artificial intelligence-based TGP combat module, Khrushch UAV, Jupiter UAV, demining drone Kaban, remote detonator RF v1.0, mobile power station Burevii, and more.\nThe platform features more than 130 inventions in total:\n\nWeapons and accessories\nReconnaissance systems and anti-drone guns\nTrucks and motor vehicles\nInnovative equipment\nUAVs & drones\nAutomated demining devices\nMobile power and telecommunication stations\n\n\n== Flagship case ==\nCosmolot, the initiator of the platform, in Winter 2023 became a partner of the Ukrainian manufacturer of UAV Punisher and provided them with systematic assistance. They donated 100 million hryvnias for 50 modernized drones of new generation resistant to REB, allowing them to destroy the enemy far behind the front lines. In the summer of 2023, they launched the Cosmolot Airlines project, which is currently the flagship case of cooperation within the platform.\n\n\n== Funding for inventions ==\nDRACARYS buggy invention of a team of Kyiv developers has already received donations for 300,000 UAH. The vehicle, with increased cross-country ability, has raised funds thanks to Cosmolot's charity tournament.\nThe Brave Inventors project also raised UAH 340,000 in donations from Ukrainians. The funding was provided to UA Dynamics, which manufactures attack UAV Punisher.\nThere is also a case of investment collaboration, where an investor has selected a team to invest a sum of money to produce one or a few copies of their invention. Once the invention is realized, the revenue will constitute the capital of their co-venture company, and they become partners.\n\n\n== Partners and companies ==\nWithin the project we have 7 partners who strengthen the platform with their help, providing mentoring, legal, informational, and other support to the development teams. Case in point, legal services company Axon Partners assists with their robust legal expertise, they provide inventor teams with counseling, lectures, and drafting of legal paperwork.\nBeryl Design Office backs with technical expertise, especially those with projects that are at the concept stage. Meanwhile, the investment portal InVenture publishes projects from the platform in its investment digest.\nBesides, the project features its own pool of experts consisting of Maxim Subbotin - a representative of the team of the manufacturer of the Ukrainian UAV Punisher, Boris Volkov - an experienced volunteer and development director of the charity fund Future Protection, as well as Dmitry ″Fox″; - a military person who is a certified UAV operator and an instructor in anti-tank and tactical training.\n\n\n== Events ==\nOn November 30, 2023, Brave Inventors supported an investment event, a networking expo Investman. Brave Inventors presented 4 inventions at the expo. These are UAV Khrushch, robotic bionic prosthesis, Fury Pro copter, and UAV Shulika.\nBrave Inventors project is included in the Ukrainian Book of Records for \"The largest number of investment projects simultaneously presented.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "The Ennerdale black pearl is a rare black pearl formed in freshwater pearl mussels found on stretches of the Ehen and Irt rivers in the English county of Cumbria.\nThe pearls were probably known as far back as Roman times. Both Tacitus and Bede mention British pearls, and William Camden says of the Irt \"In this brook the shell-fish , eagerly sucking in the dew, conceive and bring forth pearls, or (to use the Poet’s word) shell-berries. These the inhabitants gather up at low water and the jewellers buy them.\" In about 1695, a company was formed to search for pearls in the Irt, and Thomas Patrick of Ennerdale is said to have employed people to gather the pearls.\nIn recent times, freshwater mussel populations have been affected by several issues, including wildlife crime, habitat degradation and declining water quality. Between 2015 and 2018, the West Cumbria Rivers Trust carried out conservation work on the River Irt to try and protect the habitat and prevent the complete eradication of the freshwater mussel from the river.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Harmattan Haze on an African Spring is a book written in 2012 by Nigerian writer, Wole Soyinka. The novel is set in Africa and their challenges; it also reflects the author's desire for a positive change in continent Africa.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe novel centers around the different ways which Africa is seen both as a concept and a tangible reality, It portrays the different reactions people have towards the African continent both in positive and negative light. Africa is seen as more than just a geographical location, it has a mix of aspirations, historical context, and memories.\nThe novel acknowledges the abundant natural resources found in Africa and the way it serves as a source of desire for some and a source of fear for others while addressing the wrong perception portrayed by various foreign explorers, writers, and thinkers who had no or little knowledge of the people and culture of the Africans.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Gertrude Mary Walton (April 1, 1881 – February 20, 1951) was a UK born headmistress of the Methodist Ladies' College in Perth. She was the longest serving head and she introduced the Dalton Plan.\n\n\n== Life ==\nWalton was born in Derby in 1881. Her parents were Margaret Ellen (born Hanesworth) and James Pollitt Walton who was a school teacher. Her father, a keen Methodist, became the Chief School Inspector in Perth and in the following year her mother brought their five children to join him. Her private education took her to both the University of Adelaide and The Sorbonne in Paris. She had a degree from 1904 and for a year she taught in France.\n\nIn 1917 she became the head of the Methodist Ladies' College, Perth taking over from the founding Maud Connell who has served from 1908 when the Methodist Church opened the school. Her brother was killed fighting in France in 1918.\nWalton was the head but she was overseen by an all-male and Methodist school council who would demand to see her speeches before they were given.\nMargaret Bailey at Ascham College introduced the Dalton Plan in 1922 but Walton introduced the idea a year before. Walton had spent time in 1920 travelling in the UK and when she returned, this was one of her new ideas.\nIn 1936 she took a long holiday in Europe being seen off by the school's old girls association. She attended the conference that year organised by the New Education Movement in England. In the following year she also attended the New Education Conference - as it was in Perth.\n\n\n== Retired and legacy ==\nWalton retired in 1945 but her link to the school continued as she began to write its history. In 1949 her book, \"The Building of a Tradition\" was published.\nShe had travelled throughout her life and in 1951 she died while in Blackpool in Lancashire.\nIn 1957 the school opened the Gertrude Walton Library which was later named the Gertrude Walton Centre.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBiography at ADB",

        "content": "Dyngjufjöll. The Dyngjufjöll is a volcanic mountain range in the northeast of Iceland which belongs to the Askja volcanic system. Sometimes called Dyngjufjöll, it is part of the Vatnajökull National Park. The Askja caldera is also located there.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe huge mountain massif is located in the highlands of Iceland, more precisely in the Ódáðahraun and covers around 600 km2. It forms an almost perfect square with a side length of around 24 km.\nVatnajökull with its Dyngjujökull glacier tongue is 15 km south of the mountains.\nOn the west side, the Dyngjudalur valley cuts into the mountains, so that this is called the Vestari-Dyngjufjöll . These also include the central volcano of the Askja volcanic system.\nThe region is only accessible for a few months of the year.  Being situated in the rain shadow to the northeast of the Vatnajökull glacier, the area receives only about 450 mm (18 in) of rainfall annually.  \n\n\n=== NASA ===\nThe area was used by NASA during training for the Apollo program to prepare astronauts for the lunar missions. Their main objective in Askja was to study geology. The Astronaut Monument in Húsavík lists the 32 astronauts who participated.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nMany peaks in Dyngjufjöll reach between 1,300 and 1,500 m and thus rise above the bottom of the Askja Caldera by around 100 – 300 m.\nThe highest peak is Þorvaldstindur with a height of 1,510 m. It is named after an Icelandic geologist, Þorvaldur Thoroddsen.\nThis is the central volcano of an approximately 150 km long fissure system, which is also called Askja after its main caldera.\nThe mountains are mostly made of palagonite . They appear to be the remains of a large Ice Age stratovolcano. But since then the volcano has continued to work steadily, so that thick layers of lava and ash cover the palagonite in most places.\nOne of the passes between the peaks, Jónsskarð, is also named after an Icelandic geologist, Jón Þorkelsson, who was the first to describe the Askja volcano. He examined it after the great eruption of 1875. The lowest pass between these mountains, which also form the edge of the Askja caldera, is the Öskjuop.\nHere the caldera opens to the east and a hiking trail leads through it to Lake Öskjuvatn. Two German researchers, Max Rudloff and Walther von Knebel, who disappeared in the area around this time, probably drowned in this in 1907 . Knebel's fiancée, Ina von Grumbkow, organized an unsuccessful search expedition the next year, in which she also took part.\n\n\n=== Drekagil Gorge ===\n\nAlso to the east of it is a gorge called the Drachenschlucht (Isl. Drekagil). There is a Dreki hut belonging to the Akureyri hiking club. This hiking club also runs the Dyngjufjöll hut, which is located north-northwest of the Askja.\n\n\n=== See also ===\nList of volcanic eruptions in Iceland\n\n\n== References ==\n\n Media related to Dyngjufjöll at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "The Ets Haim Synagogue (\"Tree of Life\") was located in the historic center of Angra do Heroísmo, on Terceira Island, in the Azores, in Portugal.\n\n\n== History ==\nFounded in the second half of the 19th century, its history was first heavily connected to the life and work of the Jewish merchant Mimom ben Abraham Abohbot, who was its founder and served as its officiant and religious master. It was established in his residence and was also inaugurated when he borrowed a Torah from Rabbi Judah Azagury, who left the Azores to live in Lisbon.\nAs a consequence of the spread of liberal ideas in Portugal, several Jewish families living in Morocco, many of Portuguese ancestry (Sephardic), began to move to Portugal, particularly to the Algarve and the Azores, where they settled from the 1820s onwards. This migratory wave consisted of individuals who identified as British citizens initially, although later they became Portuguese nationals.\nThe Portuguese liberal monarchy allowed for the existence of various religious cults in its Constitution, while maintaining Catholicism as the official religion of the State. For example, this led to synagogues not being authorized to have direct access to the public road; it had to have  a courtyard or intermediary area of connection.\nAmong the representative surnames of Jewish families in Angra do Heroísmo, include:\n\nAbohbot\nAthias\nBaroche\nBenarus\nBen Ayon\nBenithé (ou Benitarre)\nBenjamim\nBen-Sabat (ou Bensabat)\nBenzaquim\nBozaglo\nCohen\nHanon\nLevy\nSabag\nSeriqui\nZagori\n\n\n== Mimom Abohbot ==\nMimom Abohbot was a Sephardic Jew born in Mogador. He was the son of Abraham Abohbot and Raquel Abohbot and was educated in Jewish studies and theology. The exact date of his arrival in the Azores or Angra is unknown, but historian Pedro de Merelim's first reference to him dates back to March 5, 1827, in the Book of the Port of the General Captaincy of the Azores. In 1833, he married Elisabeth Davis Abohbot in London, through a Jewish contract written in the Hebrew language, which is recorded in the register book of the \"Porta do Céu\" synagogue.\nIn 1835, he took advantage of the public auction of national assets from the dissolved convents in 1834 and acquired the property of the former Convent of Esperança, located at the corner of Sé Street and Esperança Street, where the RIAC facilities and TAP store are currently located. He remodeled and reconstructed this old building, giving it the appearance it retains today, and established his residence there. Later, in 1857, he acquired a farm in Canada dos Folhadais. In Terceira, he became a prominent merchant with establishments in Angra, selling goods on credit and lending money at interest. He also exported oranges to Great Britain. The newspapers of the time and public references portray him as a socially respected figure, not only within the Jewish community but throughout the city. He passed away in Angra do Heroísmo on July 21, 1875, \"reciting Psalms of David,\" and was buried in the Campo da Igualdade cemetery, located on Caminho Novo, in the same city.\n\n\n== Citations ==",

        "content": "The Cemitério dos Hebreus (The Hebrew Cemetery in Portuguese), also referred to as Campo da Igualdade (Field of Equality), is located on Caminho Novo, in the historic center of Angra do Heroísmo, on Terceira Island, in the Azores. It stands out for being one of the only remnants of Jewish culture in the archipelago.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe first references to the establishment of Jewish families in the Azores date back to the first half of the 19th century, originating from Morocco, where they left due to economic restrictions imposed on them at the time. During the same period, the influence of the Holy Office declined in Portugal, and the advent of Liberalism, particularly after the Liberal Revolution of Porto (1820), attracted these populations, likely of Portuguese descent. Consequently, several families began to migrate to the Azores, with the settlement of families such as Abohbot, Benarus, Levy, Zagory, or Besabat being recorded. The archipelago even had synagogues on the islands of São Miguel, Terceira, and Faial. The acceptance of Jews in these communities at the time contrasts with the persecutions carried out by the Holy Office in previous centuries.\nAccording to the sales deed dated September 24, 1832, Joaquim Zagory (also spelled as Zagury) acquired at a public auction from the Municipal Council of Angra, for the amount of 300 thousand réis, a piece of land previously designated as the council's corral, to establish a Jewish cemetery. According to the same deed, the aforementioned amount had been bequeathed in a will by Abraão Benaoim, for the construction of a \"(...) decent cemetery for all those who were of his Nation\". In that same year, Fortunato Benjamim and Abraão Sebag were buried there.\nIn 1958, the cemetery became the property of the Jewish Community of Lisbon, but in 1994, due to its state of abandonment, the Bensaúde Group took on its restoration, being responsible for its maintenance ever since. Starting from 2014, it became the responsibility of the Municipality of Angra do Heroísmo, which incorporated it into the historical heritage under its management.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nThe plot has a rectangular layout, currently containing 53 graves. Above the gate, a bilingual epigraphic inscription (Hebrew-Portuguese) reads:\n\"CAMPO DE IGUALDADE / OS HEBREOS COMPRARAO ESTE CAM= / PO A OS ILLUSTRISSIMOS MEMBROS / DA CAMERA DA CIDADE D ANGRA PA= / RA FAZEREM SEO JAZIGO / ANNO DE 1832\"\n\"FIELD OF EQUALITY / THE HEBREWS BOUGHT THIS FIELD / FROM THE ILLUSTRIOUS MEMBERS / OF THE CITY CHAMBER OF ANGRA TO / MAKE THEIR BURIAL PLACE / YEAR OF 1832\"\nHere lies buried Mimom ben Abraham Abohbot, founder of the Ets Haim Synagogue in Angra.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nGOMES, Augusto.

        "content": "The 2014 Lampung gubernatorial election took part on 9 April 2014, simultaneous with national legislative elections in Indonesia. It was the second direct election for Lampung's governor. Four pairs of candidates contested the election, with Muhammad Ridho Ficardo winning a plurality of the votes.\n\n\n== Timeline ==\nThe gubernatorial election was initially planned to be held on 2 October 2013. However, due to regional finances, this was deemed impossible and thus the election date was delayed to 9 April 2014, coinciding with national legislative elections. The Lampung provincial government had also offered January 2014 and early 2015 as potential election dates, but these were rejected. The gubernatorial election and legislative elections were held at the same location, with voters receiving five ballots (four for legislative candidates and one for the gubernatorial election), and the provincial government continued to fund the gubernatorial ballot boxes.\n\n\n== Candidates ==\nFour pairs of candidates contested the election. A fifth independent pair had registered to run in the election, but withdrew citing distrust in the provincial General Elections Commission due to the delay in the election date. Incumbent governor Sjachroedin Zainal Pagaralam was ineligible to run in the election, having served two terms.\n\n\n== Results ==\n\nFicardo and Bachtiar were sworn into office on 2 June 2014.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Jean-François Callet (25 October 1744 – 14 November 1798) was a French professor of mathematics who wrote an influential book of logarithm tables and taught spherical trigonometry and navigation. \nCallet was born in Versailles and became a professor of hydrographic engineering. Callet's most influential work was a portable table of logarithms (based on the work of William Gardiner) Tables Portatives de Logarithmes published in 1795 which went into many editions until 1906. It has fifty pages with logarithms of the sine, cosine and tangent, as well as natural sines and cosines. It was influential and led to other improved logarithm tables such as those of Edward Sang. Another work of his was a spherical trigonometric text for use in navigation published in 1798. It was made in collaboration with instrument maker Jean François Richer who was attempting to create a navigation instrument called the trigonometric circle or Compas Trigonométrique in his application for the Abbe Raynal Prize which sought a reliable and accurate method for the reduction of the apparent to the true distance between two stars. This would be usable to determine the longitude of the ship's position. Richer's application won the 1791 price.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTables Portatives de Logarithmes (1808, 3rd edition)\nSupplément à la Trigonométrie sphérique et à la navigation de Bezout (1798)",

He won the 2019 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly Election on YSR Congress Party ticket from Jaggampeta Constituency in East Godavari district. He was denied a ticket by YSRCP for the 2024 Andhra Pradesh Assembly Election.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBabu was born in Irripaka Village in Jaggampeta, East Godavari District.

He studied political science and completed his post-graduation from Andhra University in 1998.\n\n\n== Career ==\nBabu started his political journey in Telugu Desam Party and in 2009, he was incharge of TDP in his district. Later, he shifted to YSR Congress Party. In 2019, he contested the Jaggampeta Assembly Constituency on YSR Congress Party ticket and won the 2019 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assemble Election.

YSRCP's regional coordinator Pilli Subhash Chandra Bose made it clear to Babu that his name may not be considered for the Jaggampeta seat for the 2024 election due to the internal survey. Babu met Pawan Kalyan of PRP in December 2023 to trigger rumours of his exit from YSRCP.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Harley Davidson Guindon (born 15 October 1985) is a Canadian businessman, outlaw biker and criminal.\n\n\n== Youth ==\nGuindon was born in Oshawa, the son of Bernie Guindon and his stripper girlfriend known by her stage name Angel. Owing to his mother's substance abuse, Guindon was raised solely by his father along with another of his girlfriends from the age of 4 onward. On 28 June 1996, Guindon retired as the national president of Satan's Choice to spend more time with his son.  Guindon followed his father's footsteps by taking boxing as his main hobby as a teenager. At the age of 15, Guindon left home to live with his older half-sister Shannan and her daughter Rori. Guindon stated of his teenage years: \"After leaving my sister's on good terms, I move right into the worst part of Oshawa, the real south end. There were times I drank hot water in the winter to stay warm and had migraines from not eating for days at t time. Then I started selling dope and stealing cars and got myself into trouble. We probably stole about three hundred cars. We'd go joy-riding\". Guindon was convicted several times of assault, and served his sentence at the Brookside youth centre in Cobourg.\n\n\n== Criminal ==\nGuindon joined a street gang called the Cash Money Brothers that sold crack cocaine. In late 2005, Guindon was arrested by the Ontario Provincial Police as part of Project Superman.  In early 2007, Guindon made a plea bargain with the Crown where pleaded guilty to one count of extortion with a gun; two counts of forcible confinement and two counts of assault causing bodily harm in exchange for the Crown dropping the charges of attempted murder against him. In March 2007, he started serving his five year prison sentence at Millhaven Institution. Guindon was soon transferred to Collins Bay Institution. Guindon was released on parole in 2009 and was sent back to Collins Bay for parole violations. On 18 November 2009, he became father when his girlfriend gave birth to his son. Guindon went on a violent rampage when prison officials refused his request to see his son, and was placed in solitary confinement for his attacks on other prisoners. Guidon was sent back to Millhaven. At Millhaven, Guindon became a close friend of Juan Ramon Fernadnez, the Spanish gangster who served as the Toronto agent for the Mafiosi Vito Rizzuto and Gregory Woolley, the president of the Rockers, a Hells Angels puppet gang. In late 2010, Guindon was released on parole, but he was sent to Kingston Penitentiary in February 2011 for violating his parole by associating with criminals. On 15 April 2011, he was once released on parole.\n\n\n== Hells Angels ==\nIn March 2014, Guindon joined the Hells Angels. In October 2015, he was arrested following a car chase by the police on charges of robbery, impersonating a police officer, possession of illegal guns, forcible confinement, and three counts of assault. In March 2017, Guindon led a hunger strike by the prisoners at the Lindsay jail to protest living conditions. Later in 2017, the charges were stayed by the Crown.\nGuindon is a prominent businessman in Oshawa and has close links to Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario. In 2017, he opened a clothing store, Harley G's, and has 8, 000 fans on his Instagram account. Guindon is a successful retailer and has the image of a public spirted businessman generous in helping the less fortunate in society. The Oshawa city councilor Brian Nicholson has stated that \"negative activity\" in south Oshawa has stopped since Guindon moved Harley G's into the neighborhood and that: \"Since they moved to the new space, I’ve have found their operation to be like a shot in the arm for the neighborhood. Any new investment we can have along the south Simcoe corridor is important — the key to that corridor is bringing in businesses and having people there on a daily basis\".  Guindon is a close friend of John Mutton, the former mayor of Clarington who served from 2000 to 2006. In an Instagram post, Guindon praised Mutton for introducing him to \"the moguls of politics, media, marketing, franchise owners, billionaire developers, producers and much more.\" In 2022, Guindon was photographed with Mutton and the Conservative MPP and cabinet minister David Piccini at an election event, which caused some controversy.\n\n\n== Books ==\nEdwards, Peter (2017).

        "content": "\n== Moh-Mol (Tangsa) Festival ==\nThe Moh-Mol festival is the chief annual festival celebrated by the majority of sub-tribes of the Tangsa tribe, the largest tribe in the Changlang district of Arunachal Pradesh, India. The Tangsa inhabit the eastern hills of Changlang along the India-Myanmar border, dwelling in the hills of the Patkai ranges. The word \"Tangsa\" literally means \"Children of the Hill\" (Tang = Hill, Sa = Children). Despite consisting of as many as twenty-one dialectical sub-communities, the Tangsa people are bound together by common social, traditional, cultural, and mythological beliefs.\n\n\n== Origin and Cultural Significance ==\nThe Moh-Mol festival acts as a cultural nexus, connecting all the sub-tribes of the Tangsa community to come together and celebrate with grandeur and gaiety. It marks the beginning of the new year according to the traditional Tangsa calendar. The festival season starts in April and continues until August, with different Tangsa sub-tribes celebrating it on different dates within these months based on their agricultural cycles.\nFor some sub-tribes like the Muklom, Havi, Ponthai, Longchang, and Mossang, the Moh-Mol festival is rooted in the mythological story of the discovery of the \"nong\" (drum), the main musical instrument played during the festival. According to Muklom and Havi folklore, the nong was originally possessed by animals and was forcefully taken from them by the ancestors of the \"Solwa\" clans, who became the hereditary priests responsible for initiating the drum-beating rituals. The festival is believed to have started after this mythical event. Thus, the Solwa plays a central role and the Moh-Mol cannot be celebrated without them in these sub-tribes.\nAt its core, the Moh-Mol is an agricultural festival celebrated as a pre-harvest ritual, where the spirits of \"Tungja-Chamja\" (spirits of crops like arum and paddy) are venerated and worshipped for a bountiful harvest. It marks the end of one agricultural season and the beginning of a new crop cycle.\nHowever, the festival holds a deeper cultural and spiritual significance beyond just agriculture. It is an occasion for all people, irrespective of age and gender, to come together, strengthen community bonds, and pass on cultural knowledge to younger generations. Colorful traditional costumes, ornaments, arts, and crafts that showcase the rich cultural heritage of the Tangsa tribe are displayed during the festival. The festival reminds the Tangsa people of their glorious cultural past and inspires the youth to inherit, protect, preserve and continue their traditions.\nThe Moh-Mol also has a spiritual and religious dimension underlining its celebration. Some Tangsa communities ritually bid farewell to the departed souls of the family on the eve of Moh-Mol, offering food and drinks for their peaceful rest in the ancestral realm. Prayers are offered to various deities like the Goddess of Crops (Tungja-Chamja) for a bumper harvest, the Goddess of Prosperity for the productivity and well-being of families, livestock and fowl, and the Goddess of Home for the good health of all family members. A special prayer called \"nong rom\" is also performed over the drums in the drum master's house for the longevity of the nong culture.\n\n\n== Rituals and Customs ==\nNong Rom and the Role of the Solwa\nIn sub-tribes like Muklom, Havi, Longchang, and Ponthai where the drum (nong) holds a sacred significance, an important ritual called \"nong rom\" is performed by the Solwa priest to initiate the drum-beating. The Solwa comes from a particular hereditary clan believed to be the descendants of those who originally discovered the nong. On the first day of the festival, the Solwa performs a prayer over the drums, attaches three cone-shaped \"nabphaanyak\" to it, sprinkles rice grains, and chants:\nChori-ko o, laangri-ko o Etey eh shing ta ewa a shing ta\nTung wang phu o cham wang phu o\nThis roughly translates to: \"To mark the seasons 'Chori' and 'Laangri', this Mol is celebrated and the drum worshipped. My grandfather and father fixed this ritual. May the arum and paddy come to us.\" The Solwa then leads the Mol dance group, going around the village beating the drum, which others follow.\nYakri-Khab - The Wrist-Tying Ceremony\nOn the third day, a ceremony called \"Yakri-khab\" is observed where maternal uncles tie a wrist band made of \"rithing\" bark on the left wrists of their nieces and nephews. They bless them to protect against \"sok-a-wi\" (illnesses occurring from seasonal changes). The ceremony also has a deeper meaning - in the past, the period between Moh-Mol and harvest was one of food scarcity for the poor who depended solely on agriculture. The uncles' blessings were meant to protect their kin from starvation. Similar 'hunger-banishing' symbolic rituals are observed in subtribes like Mossang and Kimsing.\nBidding Farewell to the Deceased - Uraang/Raang/Lenghog\nAs Moh-Mol marks a new beginning, it is also an occasion to properly send off those who passed away in the previous year. In the Havi, Muklom and Jugli subtribes, elaborate farewell ceremonies like \"Lenghog\", \"Raang\" and \"Boygjong\" respectively are performed for the deceased by their families a few days prior to Moh-Mol. The rituals involve offering food, drinks and meat to the departed soul, hanging their belongings and skulls/tails of sacrificed animals in a temporary bamboo hut, emotionally reenacting the mourning, and finally cremating a lock of the deceased's hair that was preserved. This releases their soul to the afterlife and ends their connection to the living.\n\n\n== Roonhun Song - The Repository of Tangsa History and Culture ==\nAn integral part of Moh-Mol, especially for non-Pangwa Tangsa groups like Muklom, Havi, Longchang and Ponthai, is the singing of the \"Roonhun\" song by experts on the first two evenings. The Roonhun is an oral repository of Tangsa history, mythology, and culture. Sung in an ancient language different from the modern tongue and largely unintelligible to the common populace, it narrates the Tangsa cosmogony, evolution tales, the origin of humankind, the discovery of crops, the invention of traditional attires and ornaments, ancestral legends, and other etiological myths. Each entity mentioned is referred to by a specific esoteric name only known to the Roonwa (Roonhun expert).\nFor example, in the Muklom Roonhun, the original discovery of the nong by the Rekhung ancestor is described. Stories like how God's sister turned into a human, married a mortal and later became an elephant; how the rice beer starter (pi-ru) was found in the wild; the acknowledgement of salt wells by non-tribals through Dongwa; two brothers trading boar teeth to cannibals; and many more are narrated poetically. The Roonhun song metaphorically speaks of a time when the realms of gods and men were closer before being separated.\nThe Roonhun is not merely a form of entertainment but a sacred traditional knowledge system. In villages that celebrate Rom Mol, singing it on any day besides Moh-Mol is considered blasphemous. The experts say Roonhun is endless and cannot be completed even if sung continuously for two nights. It is an unbroken stream of knowledge that can go on as long as one's memory of the folklore persists. For the Pangwa sub-tribes, a similar traditional knowledge repository called \"Sahwishey\" is sung during their \"Wihu Kuh\" festival.\n\n\n== The Festival Celebration ==\nOn the Moh-Mol day, male and female artists adorn themselves in vibrant traditional costumes and ornaments. Carrying musical instruments like drums, gongs, and cymbals, they dance from one end of the village to another in a fixed pattern, usually circling the perimeter thrice. The rhythm of the drums, chimes of the gongs and jingles of cymbals blend to create a joyous, immersive atmosphere.\nThe celebrations continue in the evening and throughout the night, where people of all ages, including the hosts and guests, don informal dresses and gather in one or two houses to perform community dances while the Roonwa and selected artists engage in singing the traditional Roonhun folksong. The singers display their knowledge of folklore and engage in playful singing competition, while the interested younger generation keenly listens, learning and inheriting the oral traditions in the process.\nThe festival usually spans 4–5 days (duration varies between sub-tribes but is never less than 3 days). Different rituals and ceremonies are conducted on specific days, with the drum-beating and dancing performances being the highlights. Moh-Mol is also an occasion for relatives and friends from near and far to visit each other, gather together, exchange news, views, well-wishes and blessings, and simply revel in each other's company. The host village welcomes guests heartily, believing that a festival without ample guests is considered incomplete and unsuccessful.\n\n\n== Evolution and Current Status ==\nThe Moh-Mol has evolved over time, with some old practices fading away while some integral customs continue. Many traditional rituals have been abandoned due to the mass conversion of the Tangsa sub-tribes to Christianity, especially among the Pangwa group where nearly 99% have adopted the new faith which prohibits them from making traditional offerings and sacrifices to ancestral spirits. The high expenses involved have also caused some sub-tribes like Tikhak and Ponthai to simplify, clubbing different occasions into one celebration.\nDespite these changes, most sub-tribes strive to preserve the essence and spirit of Moh-Mol. The festival has now also acquired a new significance - that of displaying and celebrating a pan-Tangsa cultural identity. Since 1989, a unified \"Tangsa Mol\" is celebrated annually on April 25 in the parade grounds of Kharsang town, where all sub-tribes gather in their traditional finery to perform the Mol dances together. Similar unified celebrations also happen in major towns like Changlang, Miao and Nampong. Though these lack the spiritual rituals, they serve to showcase Tangsa unity.\nHowever, many Tangsa elders and cultural experts express concern that the core essence of Moh-Mol is fading, with the festival becoming more of a cultural performance than a spiritual and community experience as it used to be. They fear that the deep philosophies and traditional knowledge embedded in the festival may fade away if the younger generation does not participate in the full festivities and imbibe the semantic and sacred aspects.\n\n\n== Tangsa Community's Efforts to Preserve Moh-Mol ==\nRecognizing the cultural significance and the risk of losing the essence of Moh-Mol, various Tangsa cultural organizations and community leaders are making efforts to preserve and promote the festival.\nDocumentation and Research\nOne key initiative is the documentation of the festival's rituals, customs, folksongs, and folklore. Tangsa scholars, students, and enthusiasts are actively engaging in research to record the oral traditions associated with Moh-Mol. They are interviewing elders, Roonhun experts, and other cultural practitioners, and documenting the festival through videos, photographs, and detailed written accounts.\nSome researchers are focusing on deciphering and interpreting the esoteric Roonhun language, creating glossaries and translations to help the younger generation understand the profound meanings embedded in these ancient songs. Others are studying the symbolism and philosophy behind the various rituals and customs, providing insights into the Tangsa worldview and value system.\nCultural Education and Transmission\nTo ensure that the younger generation continues to value and participate in Moh-Mol, community leaders are organizing cultural education programs. These include workshops where elders teach the youth the traditional songs, dances, and customs associated with the festival. Some villages have started \"Roonhun Schools\" where interested youngsters can learn the art of singing the Roonhun from the experts.\nCultural competitions are also being held during Moh-Mol, where youth can showcase their skills in traditional music, dance, and folklore narration. These serve to encourage the younger generation to actively engage with their cultural heritage and take pride in it.\nCommunity Engagement and Support\nTangsa community organizations are working to mobilize resources and support to help villages organize Moh-Mol celebrations. They are creating funds to assist villages in procuring the necessary materials, costumes, and instruments, and to host community feasts. Some organizations are also working with local authorities to develop infrastructure in villages to facilitate the celebration of festivals like Moh-Mol.\nCommunity leaders are also encouraging Tangsas living outside their native villages to return home during Moh-Mol and participate in the celebrations. This helps to strengthen community bonds and allows the diaspora Tangsas to stay connected with their roots.\nPromoting Cultural Tourism\nThe Tangsa community is also exploring ways to promote Moh-Mol as a cultural tourism event. By inviting outsiders to witness and participate in the festival, they hope to create awareness and appreciation for Tangsa culture, while also generating economic opportunities for the community.\nHowever, they are cautious about maintaining the sanctity and authenticity of the festival, and are developing guidelines for respectful and sustainable cultural tourism. The focus is on creating immersive experiences that allow visitors to understand and appreciate the deeper significance of Moh-Mol, rather than just being spectators to the surface-level festivities.\n\n\n== Moh-Mol's Significance in the Larger Cultural Landscape ==\nThe Moh-Mol festival of the Tangsa tribe is not just significant for the community itself, but also holds importance in the larger cultural landscape of Arunachal Pradesh and the North East region of India.\nArunachal Pradesh is home to 26 major tribes and over 100 sub-tribes, each with its own distinct cultural heritage. Festivals like Moh-Mol serve as important markers of this cultural diversity and richness. They offer a glimpse into the unique worldviews, value systems, and ways of life of the different tribal communities.\nMoreover, festivals like Moh-Mol also highlight the deep connection that tribal communities have with nature. The rituals and customs associated with agricultural cycles reflect an eco-centric worldview that sees humans as part of a larger ecosystem, dependent on and responsible towards the forces of nature. In an era of environmental crisis and climate change, these traditional knowledge systems hold valuable lessons for sustainable living.\nMoh-Mol, along with other tribal festivals of Arunachal Pradesh, is also significant from a national perspective. They showcase the cultural diversity that is the hallmark of India. The Indian constitution, under Article 29, grants all citizens the right to conserve their distinct language, script, and culture. Festivals like Moh-Mol are living embodiments of this constitutional principle.\nFurthermore, the North East region of India, of which Arunachal Pradesh is a part, has often been marginalized in the national discourse. Festivals like Moh-Mol provide an opportunity for the rest of the country to learn about and appreciate the rich cultural heritage of this region. They serve as a bridge for cultural understanding and integration.\n\n\n== Challenges and Way Forward ==\nDespite its significance and the community's efforts to preserve it, the Moh-Mol festival faces several challenges. The primary challenge is that of cultural erosion due to modernization, urbanization, and the influence of external religions and value systems. As more and more Tangsa youth move out of their villages for education and employment, they risk losing touch with their cultural roots.\nMoreover, the oral nature of Tangsa tradition makes it vulnerable to being lost over generations. With the passing away of elders and cultural experts, there is a risk of the rich repository of folklore, songs, and rituals being forgotten.\nTo address these challenges, a multi-pronged approach is needed. While the efforts of the Tangsa community to document, transmit, and promote their culture are laudable, they also need the support of the wider society and the state.\nThe government, both at the state and central level, needs to create an enabling environment for the preservation and promotion of tribal cultures. This can include policies and programs for cultural documentation and research, support for cultural education and transmission initiatives, and the creation of platforms for cultural exchange and showcasing.\nEducational institutions also have a role to play. Schools and colleges in Arunachal Pradesh can integrate local cultural heritage into their curriculum, helping students understand and appreciate their roots. Research institutions can partner with tribal communities to study and document their culture in a collaborative and respectful manner.\nMedia and civil society also need to be more proactive in highlighting the importance of festivals like Moh-Mol. By creating awareness and appreciation among the wider public, they can help create a social environment that values and supports cultural diversity.\nUltimately, the future of Moh-Mol, and indeed of all tribal festivals, rests on the ability of the community to adapt to change while retaining the essence of their culture. It requires a delicate balance between tradition and modernity, between preservation and evolution.\nThe Tangsa community's efforts to preserve and promote Moh-Mol offer a model for other tribal communities facing similar challenges. By taking pride in their heritage, actively engaging the youth, and reaching out to the wider society, they are ensuring that the rhythms of the nong and the melodies of the Roonhun will continue to resonate through the hills of Changlang for generations to come.\n\n\n== Conclusion ==\nThe Moh-Mol festival is a vibrant, multifaceted celebration that intertwines the agricultural, social, cultural, and spiritual life of the Tangsa tribe. Beyond the colorful song and dance, it is a sacred occasion for expressing gratitude to the forces of nature, remembering and revering the ancestors, reaffirming as well as transmitting ancient knowledge systems to the younger generation, and strengthening the bonds of kinship and community. It is a vital link that connects the Tangsa to their rich cultural heritage and roots. Though the festival has evolved with the changing socio-religious landscape, its essence as a marker of Tangsa identity continues to beat in the rhythms of the nong, the melody of the Roonhun, and the hearts of the people who gather to celebrate it every year. The Moh-Mol's future vitality rests in the collective willingness of the Tangsa community to preserve and pass on this integral cultural legacy to the future generations.\n\n\n== References ==\n• Boro, K.

A lifeboat was first stationed here by the RNLI in 1870. \nAfter only 14 launches in 28 years, the station was closed in 1898.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn April 1870, the RNLI decided to create a new lifeboat station at Chapel St Leonards. A new boathouse was constructed at The Pullover, at a cost of £158, and a carriage was provided, costing £93-12s-0d. An order had been placed with Forrestt of Limehouse, London for a 30-foot Self-righting lifeboat, which cost £235-10s-0d, funded by Lady Jane Barbara Bourchier (1810–1884) of Hampton Court Palace, and was named Godsend  at a ceremony on 22 July 1870 attended by over 10000 people. Edward Grunnill was appointed Coxswain.\nGodsend was replaced in 1876 with another 30-foot self-righting lifeboat, built by Woolfe of Shadwell, costing £275. Funded by Miss Jennie Landseer, the lifeboat was named Landseer, in memory of her late brother and acclaimed artist Sir Edwin Landseer, RA (1802–1873).\nTwelve years later, a third and final boat was provided to Chapel. A 31-foot self-righting boat, constructed by Hansen, and costing £288. She was funded, along with a second boat for Sutton Lifeboat Station, from the legacy of Miss Caroline Berrey, and was named John Alexander Berrey at a ceremony on 25 May 1888.\nIn October 1888, Matthew Grunnill was appointed Coxswain, following the retirement of his father Edward Grunnill. Matthew would later serve as crew and then Coxswain of Skegness lifeboat.\n14 people owed their lives to the Chapel lifeboat. However, with very few services recorded, Chapel lifeboat having launched only 14 times in 28 years, it was decided to close the station in 1898. John Alexander Berrey (ON 217) became a reserve lifeboat, and was used for demonstrations. The Chapel boathouse still remains, and is currently a shop.\n\n\n== Chapel lifeboats ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of RNLI stations\nList of former RNLI stations\nRoyal National Lifeboat Institution lifeboats\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "Azerbaijan Railway Museum (Azerbaijani: Azərbaycan Dəmiryol Muzeyi) is a railway museum in Baku, Azerbaijan. The museum was opened in 2019.\nThe museum is located in historic building of Sabunchu Railway Station of Baku City, near Jafar Jabbarli Square (28 May metro station).\n\n\n== History ==\nThe opening of the Azerbaijan Railway Museum took place on November 19, 2019, with the participation of President Ilham Aliyev.\nReconstruction works were carried out in the museum, which was closed during the pandemic, and after being enriched with new exhibits, it started welcoming visitors on December 28, 2023.\nThe historic Sabunchu Railway Station (near the 28 May metro station), one of the three buildings comprising the historical station complex of the Baku Passenger Station, is home to the Azerbaijan Railway Museum. This building was commissioned on July 6, 1926, the day of the opening of the first electrified railway in Azerbaijan. Sabunchu Railway Station in Baku was the first station building to receive electric trains.\nThe building was constructed based on the national architectural traditions of Azerbaijan and is reminiscent of the Palace of the Shirvanshahs due to its appearance and many elements. The windows of the building made in the style of national “shabaka” art, the decor of the Shirvanshahs period in the upper part of the facade of the entrance, and the stone carvings of lions on the clock tower are noteworthy. \nThe museum has 2 exhibition halls, a cinema hall, and halls for organizing cultural and corporate events. Events such as book signing days, reading hours, book and art exhibitions, meetings with public figures are held here. \nIn the halls, various interesting exhibits related to the development stages of the railway sector of Azerbaijan, including photo and video materials reflecting the history of the creation of the railway in the 19th century, and train models are displayed. Also, a photo corner was created to reflect the incomparable services rendered by the National Leader Heydar Aliyev in the development of railways in Azerbaijan.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of museums in Azerbaijan\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Gunslinger is a board wargame published by Avalon  Hill in 1982 that simulates gunfights and brawls in an Old West setting.\n\n\n== Description ==\nGunslinger is a game for 2–7 players, each of whom controls one character engaged in sudden combat in a stereotypical Western town. \n\n\n=== Components ===\nEach player has a set of 12 double-sided cards that are used for initiative order, action designation and combat resolution. Each player also has a counter to represent the position of their character on a hex grid map that is formed from one or more eight 8\" x 11\" double-sided geomorphic tiles scaled at 6 feet per hex. One side of each tile displays rural terrain such as gullies, trees, corrals, watering troughs, wells, hitching posts, or Boot Hill , while the other side has part of a Western frontier town such as a bank, saloon or small store. Rural and town tiles can be mixed to produce the desired terrain. The hex grid is distorted to fit the buildings rather than the other way around, resulting in \"hexagons\" that have four, five, six or seven sides. Critic Jay Selover noted \"This innovation is one of the most impressive accomplishments of the game. Hexes have always been used to regulate movement and range, but here they have finally been relegated to their proper positions as tools of the game designer, subordinated as needed to the realities of the true terrain.\"\n\n\n=== Set-up ===\nEach player selects one of 48 pregenerated characters. Each character has a name, and is defined by shooting and brawling skill, endurance, special abilities, ambidexterity, and standard weapons carried. Players can also create their own characters using guidelines provided in the rules.\nThe players select one of 26 scenarios, each of which has several variants. The scenarios cover most Western-themed combat situations, including High Noon- and OK Corral-type gunfights, bank robberies, and barroom brawls.\n\n\n=== Gameplay ===\nEach turn represents 2 seconds of game time. Each player selects an action to take such as movement, an attack, a defense, or utilizing strength (to add power to a throw or attack), and these are revealed simultaneously. The cards are then placed in order and executed from fastest to slowest.\nHitting a target with a firearm is influenced by range, skill of the attacker, and time spent aiming the weapon. There are nine possible body locations that can be hit, and 13 types of damage that can occur, from \"Lose Aim\" to \"KIA\".\nEach scenario lasts for a set amount of time. Victory points are added up at the end of the scenario to determine a winner. \n\n\n== Publication history ==\nGunslinger was designed by Richard Hamblen, and was published by Avalon Hill in 1982 as a boxed set with artwork by Charles Kibler, Scott Moores, Dale Sheaffer, and Chris White.\nAn identically named game of Western gunfighting had been published by Richard R. Sartore & Associates five years previously, but this had no connection to the Avalon Hill product.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIn Issue 36 of Fire & Movement, Jay Selover liked this game, writing, \"Whoa, pardner! Don't skip this one.\" Given the small map scale and 2-second turns, Selover called this a \"micro-tactical wargame\". He liked the combat system, and also admired the quality of the game components, noting that the ability mix and match town and rural elements meant that \"the possible configurations are innumerable.\" Selover warned that \"without time limits, you can spend 10 minutes on a two-second turn and thus five hours to simulate a one-minute gunfight.\" However, Selover concluded on a positive note, writing, \"this game can be habit-forming. ¡Vaya con Dios, desperado!\" \nWriting for Black Gate, Ty Johnston pointed out that rules are not simple, but on the other hand, \"gameplay is actually pretty fast once you’ve got a feel for the Gunslinger system.\" Johnston also believed that \"the meticulous rules of this game make it one of the more realistic small-scale combat systems I've run across, far surpassing any rpg and bringing a strong dose of realism.\" Johnston concluded by recommending the game. \"If you are a fan of all things Old West or if you’re an experienced war gamer, you might love Gunslinger. Experienced rpgers will also likely find a lot of love for Gunslinger. Beginners will probably be somewhat overwhelmed. But hey, everybody’s got to learn sometime, right?\" \nAfter giving a quick summary of how the game is played, Matt Sall warned, \"The Gunslinger board game comes with MANY, MANY more rules for whatever amount of granularity you’d like. There are rules for different heights, horses, terrain features, dynamite, as well as a fully realized campaign and scenario guide.\" Sall concluded, \"Overall, Gunslinger is the sort of Avalon Hill game I could get into. Macro enough to avoid getting bogged down, but enough options to really fine-tune to my liking.\"\nOn the website Do You Remember, Michael Johnson called this a game that \"was actually really well thought out ... great at creating that old western cliché of the gunfight. It had a quick and easy game system that recreated the split-second nature of high noon!\" Johnson concluded, \"Real good fun, and like being in your own episode of Bonanza!\n\n\n== Other recognition ==\nA copy of Gunslinger is held in the collection of the Strong National Museum of Play (object 116.78490).\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Deepak Hegde (born November 5, 1977) is an Indian born American business scholar. He is the Seymour Milstein Professor of Strategy at the New York University, Stern School of Business.\nHegde is best known for his study of how innovation and entrepreneurship is shaped by public policy and private business practices. Notably he has offered evidence for the benefits of speedy approval and early publishing of patents. He has also studied multiple factors that impact entrepreneurship, including asymmetry of information on employee qualifications, the relevance of shared ethnic backgrounds, and bankruptcy protection regimes.\nHegde is also the founder and director of entrepreneurship programs notable for their practical pedagogy in helping real-life start-ups commercialize scientific innovations by bringing together scientists, business managers, and investors.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life and education ===\nHegde was born in Yellapur in Karnataka, India. He graduated from the National Institute of Engineering in Karnataka in 2000 with a bachelor's degree in industrial engineering. In 2004 he earned a master's degree in public policy from the Georgia Institute of Technology, and in 2010 he completed his PhD in Business and Public Policy from the University of California, Berkeley.\nHegde has credited professors David C. Mowery, Bronwyn Hall, and Bhaven Sampat, as mentors influential in his work.\n\n\n=== Academic career ===\nHegde joined the New York University's Stern School of Business as Professor of Management in 2010, received tenure in 2016, and became a full professor in 2020. In 2023 he was appointed to the chaired professorship Seymour Milstein Professor of Strategy.\nHegde has taught courses on business strategy, innovation, and entrepreneurship. He has researched how entrepreneurs and innovators bring their ideas to market, especially within science and technology intensive industries.\nHegde serves or has served in editorial positions at academic journals including the Journal of Economics & Management Strategy, Organization Science, Management Science, and Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal.\nHegde has also been a visiting scholar at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and subsequently was  named Thomas Alva Edison Scholar to study how past policies have affected the USPTO patent quality metrics and the patent examination quality.\n\n\n=== Practical entrepreneurship programs ===\nSince 2017 Hegde has launched multiple practical entrepreneurship programs at NYU, including the Endless Frontier Labs program in 2019. These programs are notable for their innovative pedagogy in helping real startups commercialize scientific and technological innovations, by bringing together the scientists who developed these innovations, business managers that can run the startups, and venture capitalists that can provide the necessary funding.\nHegde is also the academic director of NYU's Berkley Center for Entrepreneurship, which provides education, coaching, and funding for startups.\n\n\n=== Awards and accolades ===\nIn 2012 Hegde was named a Kauffman Junior Faculty Fellow in Entrepreneurship Research – an award that recognized scholars who exhibit the potential to make significant contributions to the body of research in the field of entrepreneurship.\nIn 2015 Hegde was listed among the top 40 MBA professors under the age of 40 by Poets & Quants.\nFor his innovative pedagogy and impact on the practice of entrepreneurship, he received the 2018 NYU Stern School of Business Faculty Leadership Award, and the 2022 Entrepreneurship Pedagogy Award by the Academy of Management. Hegde has also received distinguished teaching awards.\n\n\n== Notable research ==\n\nHegde has studied the consequences of business practices and public policy on innovation and entrepreneurship.  His research on entrepreneurship notably showed that workers with skills greater than what their résumés suggest gravitate towards entrepreneurship. Also that shared ethnic backgrounds among investors and entrepreneurs led to superior investment returns. His innovation policy research offered evidence that speedy approval of a startup's first-time patent application significantly bolstered its growth and success; that earlier publishing of patent applications lead to faster licensing, diffusion, and innovation; and that increased complexity in the patent approval process put larger firms at an advantage over smaller ones.\n\n\n=== Entrepreneurship ===\nHegde found that individuals with skills greater than what their résumés show are undervalued by employers and gravitate towards entrepreneurship. He posited that employers assess potential workers based on their educational qualifications, especially early in their careers when there is little direct information on their work accomplishments and productivity. This leads those who correctly believe that they are better than their résumés show to become successful entrepreneurs. This not only applies to high-tech entrepreneurs, but everyone who chooses to be self-employed. The conclusion is that entrepreneurs have higher ability scores, lower levels of educational attainment, as well as greater and more variable earnings. This may explain why several groups with less credible ability signals, such as immigrants, gravitate toward entrepreneurship.\nAlso, Hegde found that venture capitalists (VCs) are more likely to invest in startups with executives from the same ethnic background, and that when VCs and entrepreneurs shared the same ethnicity, startups were more successful. This is likely not discrimination against others but instead reflect the benefits from closer VC-entrepreneur communication and coordination when they share the same ethnic background.\nHegde also found that more bankruptcy protections for debtors led to shrinking investments and innovation. Higher levels of bankruptcy exemptions (debtor protections where some assets cannot be used to repay creditors in a bankruptcy), meant greater risks for investors, in turn lowering their levels of capital investment. That made firms (especially small ones and in industries with high costs of innovation) to cut back on innovation expenditures, resulting in fewer patents and lower overall patent quality.\n\n\n=== Patent approvals ===\nHegde found that the speedy approval of a startup's first-time patent application greatly bolstered its growth and success, with greater growth in revenue, employment, investor funding, and subsequent patent approvals. Conversely, the research also showed that when ultimately-approved patents experienced protracted review processes, those growth rates were significantly dampened. Hegde posited that patents facilitate information sharing between potential investors and startups, and generate more investments to fuel their growth. Entrepreneurs can more openly share inventions without fear of being misappropriated. Investors can more confidently invest in firms that hold patents as those serve as indicators of greater quality and potential success.\nHe also found that increased complexity in the patent approval process led to fewer approvals and put large firms at an advantage over small firms. His research showed that applications filed by large firms were more likely to result in patents than those filed by small firms, suggesting it was getting more difficult for small companies to get patents, while large companies had both the financial resources and time to wait out the lengthy and costly approval process.\n\n\n=== Patent disclosures ===\nHegde also found that the earlier disclosure by the U.S Patent and Trademark Office of inventions through patent publication accelerated innovation. He found that a change in policy, where publication was shortened from 3–4 years to 18 months, accelerated further patenting and innovation.\nHegde also found, contrary to common belief, that a majority of investors chose to opt out of secrecy and publicly reveal their patent applications while they were still pending, to reap the benefits of informing potential investors and licensees. On the flip, side Hegde found that the least valuable and least-impactful patents were those that opted for pre-grant secrecy.\n\n\n=== Politics of disease research funding ===\nHegde tested the supposedly political independence of the grant-making activities of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), tasked with funding disease research, through an independent and non-political peer-review system. Hegde nevertheless found that despite their merit-based aims, NIH grant decisions were skewed toward greater funding to rare disease research advocated by constituencies from states that had more members on the U.S House subcommittee with oversight of the NIH.\nThe U.S. Congress aimed to curb the power of lobbyists through a 2010 ban on setting aside money in bills for specific projects, known as earmarks. In response, lobby groups shifted strategies, seeking to steer funds using ‘soft’ earmarks: language in spending bills that encourages or urges an agency to perform some action, such as funding Alzheimer's research, rather than setting aside funds for it.\n\n\n== Publications ==\n\n\n=== Selected journal articles ===\nHicks, Diana; Hegde, Deepak (June 2005). \"Highly innovative small firms in the markets for technology\".

        "content": "James Hooper is an Australian rugby league journalist for News Limited. He regularly appears as a panelist on NRL 360 and blogs regularly on rugby league.\nIn 2018 Hooper was charged by police with destroying and damaging property. \nIn 2022 Hooper was involved in an altercation on air with Triple M broadcaster Anthony Maroon which resulted in Maroon walking out and then resigning from Triple M. There were accusations Maroon was bullied by Hooper and co presenters Gorden Tallis and Paul Kent. Kent wrote an article criticising the \"social justice hypocrites backing Anthony Maroon\", adding “The pile-on for Hooper, both in social and mainstream media, is ten-fold to what Maroon copped yet none of these mental health warriors have considered that, instead taking comfort in being part of the righteous majority.\"\nHooper is often satirised in the newspaper Betoota Advocate. One article claims \"Even the players struggle to remember his name, unless they have been directly targeted in his tabloid rugby league blogging... This lack of recognition in the game comes as a body blow to Hooper, as he works tirelessly to become the new Buzz Rothfield.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

It is a live recording of their 1990 grunge album Ragged Glory, with each track retitled with a phrase taken from the lyrics (with the exception of the cover version of \"Farmer John\"). The final song on Ragged Glory, \"Mother Earth (Natural Anthem)\", was not performed. The album was recorded at a private birthday party held at the Rivoli in Toronto, Canada on November 4, 2023. Fuckin' Up received positive reviews from critics.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nFuckin' Up received a score of 81 out of 100 on review aggregator Metacritic based on five critics' reviews, which the website categorised as \"universal acclaim\". Mojo commented that there is an \"undeniable zip\" to the tracks, while Uncut felt that the album \"captures Young and the Horse on blazing form\", noting that Nelson is \"a capable duelling partner for Young\" and \"Lofgren's honky-tonk piano lends a shimmying quality to these craggy, elemental songs\". PopMatters' Christopher J. Lee said that it \"highlights Neil Young and Crazy Horse at their best – loose, loud, and long-lasting, but without being long-winded\".\nA staff review from AllMusic stated that the tracks are \"refram[ed ...] in a live setting that's somehow even more ragged, and just as glorious\" and \"stretche[d] out a little more than on record [...] as Young tries new tricks with his guitar tones and the band injects some exploration into the jammier sections of the tunes\". Nick Seip of Slant Magazine felt that the live setting adds \"even more grit and grime\" as \"it's truer to the spirit of the material, as the messier mix captures the energy of a one-and-done performance\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nNeil & the Horse\n\nNeil Young – lead vocals, guitar, harmonica, production\nRalph Molina – drums, backing vocals\nBilly Talbot – bass, backing vocals\nNils Lofgren – guitar, piano, backing vocals\nAdditional contributors\n\nNiko Bolas – production\nJohn Hanlon – mixing\nTim Mulligan – engineering\nMark Humphries – monitor engineering\nMicah Nelson – guitar, piano, backing vocals\nDani Reiss – presenter\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Swainsona parviflora is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae and is endemic to the eastern Australia. It is a low-lying perennial with imparipinnate leaves with 5 to 11 narrowly elliptic  to narrowly lance-shaped or oblong leaflets, and racemes of 3 to 10 purple flowers.\n\n\n== Description ==\nSwainsona parviflora is a low-lying perennial plant with a few slender, hairy stems. The leaves are imparipinnate, mostly less than 50 mm (2.0 in) long with 5 to 11 narrowly elliptic to narrowly lance-shaped or oblong leaflets, the side leaflets mostly 10–25 mm (0.39–0.98 in) long and 1–2 mm (0.039–0.079 in) wide with stipules 1–2 mm (0.039–0.079 in) long at the base of the petioles. The flowers are purple, 5–8 mm (0.20–0.31 in) long, arranged in racemes of 3 to 11, 80–200 mm (3.1–7.9 in) long, on a peduncle 0.5–1.0 mm (0.020–0.039 in) long. The sepals are joined at the base to form a tube 1–2 mm (0.039–0.079 in) long, with lobes equal to or slightly longer than the tube. The standard petal is 5–9 mm (0.20–0.35 in) long and 6–11 mm (0.24–0.43 in) wide, the wings 5–8 mm (0.20–0.31 in) long and the keel 5–8 mm (0.20–0.31 in) long and 2.5–3.0 mm (0.098–0.118 in) deep.\n\n\n== Taxonomy and naming ==\nSwainsona parviflora was first formally described in 1864 by George Bentham in his Flora Australiensis from specimens collected near Wide Bay by John Carne Bidwill. The specific epithet (parviflora) means \"small-flowered\".\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nThis species of swainsona grows in well-watered grassland on the Northern Tablelands, North West Slopes and plains of New South Wales and in south-eastern Queensland.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Barangay Ginebra–Meralco rivalry is an PBA rivalry between the Barangay Ginebra San Miguel and the Meralco Bolts. It is an intense rivalry that often features contested games. It is a part of SMC–MVP rivalry since Ginebra was owned by San Miguel Corporation and Meralco was part of the MVP Group.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early days ===\nBarangay Ginebra and Meralco first met in October 3, 2010, in the 2010-11 PBA Philippine Cup opening and Bolts win the game 73-72, but after the win, Meralco is still eliminated from the conference because of bad performance for the last remaining games.\n\n\n=== The rivalry is born ===\n\n\n==== 2016 Governors' Cup Finals ====\nUnder the tutelage of Norman Black, with Jimmy Alapag as one of its players, he led the Bolts to its first PBA Finals appearance in 2016 PBA Governors Cup. But that time, Barangay Ginebra came from being a quarterfinalist to a title contender under Tim Cone. After Bolts leading in the series twice, Barangay Ginebra won in Games 4, 5 & 6, thanks to a run led by its veteran superstars Jayjay Helterbrand and former Alaska Aces player LA Tenorio, with Justin Brownlee's buzzer-beater.\n\n\n==== 2017 Governors' Cup Finals ====\nThe two teams met again in the 2017 Governors' Cup Finals, but the only difference is Greg Slaughter was in the Barangay Ginebra's lineup, Ranidel de Ocampo was in the Meralco and Alapag retired. Barangay Ginebra lead the series 2-0, but Meralco resurgence, and ties the series. But Barangay Ginebra won in seven games.\n\n\n==== 2018 Commissioner's Cup Quarterfinals ====\nBarangay Ginebra swept the Bolts in the best-of-three quarterfinals series.\n\n\n==== 2019 Governors' Cup Finals ====\nIn this time they met again in the 2019 PBA Governors' Cup Finals. Jared Dillinger was now a Barangay Ginebra, after Meralco released him, while Raymond Almazan was added to the latter. The series resulted in Barangay Ginebra winning the series, 4–1 .\n\n\n==== 2020 Philippine Cup Semifinals ====\nAt the middle of the bubble, Barangay Ginebra won the best-of-five semifinals series against Meralco by a Scottie Thompson game winner. In Game 4, Reynel Hugnatan of Meralco was allegedly said in the middle of the game that the game is cooked and the calls favored Barangay Ginebra by stating 'Ref, lutong luto to ah'. He later denied the accusation.\n\n\n==== 2021 Governors' Cup Finals ====\nThe Meralco Bolts traded Baser Amer now have Chris Banchero, and Barangay Ginebra have their former player John \"Nards\" Pinto. The Bolts led the series 2-1, but just like in 2016, Barangay Ginebra wins 3 straight to win the championship. In Game 1 of the series, Barangay Ginebra's Arvin Tolentino and Meralco's Raymar Jose have altercation.\n\n\n==== 2022 Philippine Cup Quarterfinals ====\nDue to Norman Black's temporary leave, Tim Cone's former lieutenant Luigi Trillo acted as interim coach. Due to a Raymond Almzan three-pointer and a Scottie Thompson offensive foul, Bolts finally won their first playoff series against Barangay Ginebra.\n\n\n== Players who played for both teams ==\nLocal\n\nPaul Artadi\nMarlou Aquino\nMac Baracael\nKG Canaleta\nMike Cortez\nJared Dillinger\nJohn Ferriols\nJammer Jamito\nChico Lanete\nMark Macapagal\nAllein Maliksi\nSol Mercado\nJohn \"Nards\" Pinto\nJay-R Reyes\nNico Salva\nSunday Salvacion\nJohn Wilson\nJoseph Yeo\nImport\n\nTony Bishop\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "The Rendezvous Hotel Perth Scarborough is a high rise beachside hotel in the Perth suburb of Scarborough, Western Australia. Originally known as Observation City, the hotel was constructed in the 1980s by Bond Corporation to accommodate visitors for the 1987 America's Cup, which was held off the coast of Perth. At 70 metres (230 ft) tall, the hotel is the tallest coastal building in Perth.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Rendezvous Hotel is located at 148 The Esplanade, Scarborough, Western Australia, on the north-western corner of Scarborough Beach Road and West Coast Highway. According to the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, the hotel is 70 metres (230 ft) tall, making it the tallest coastal building in Perth and the 61st tallest building in Perth overall. The building is variously described as 17, 18, or 19 storeys tall.\nThe hotel has 337 rooms and suites. Facilities include a gym, outdoor pool, spa, tennis courts, pool bar, and games room. The hotel has a restaurant named Straits Café and a bar.\nThe Rendezvous Hotel chain is owned by Australian company TFE Hotels, a joint venture between Singaporean company Far East Hospitality and Toga Group. Far East Hospitality is a joint venture between Far East Orchard and Straits Trading Company.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Planning and construction ===\nIn October 1974, the City of Stirling, the local government area in which Scarborough belongs, gazetted a 7.6-hectare (19-acre) area of Scarborough as a \"Special Beach Development Zone\", requiring special approval from the Stirling council for development in the area, in an attempt to encourage a high standard of development, as apposed to piecemeal development. By the end of 1981 though, little development had occurred within the zone.\nAustmark submitted a proposal to the Stirling council in early 1982 for the development of at least one 20 storey building and 10 storey building in the Special Beach Development Zone. Council approved the proposal as a concept plan in May 1982, but the development did not proceed because Austmark had not acquired all the land required. A syndicate led by Alan Bond won the America's Cup in September 1983, meaning the cup had to be defended about four years later off the coast of Perth. Bond Corporation acquired Austmark in late 1983 and the development was revived.  A new development application was made to the Stirling council in November 1983, this time with all the necessary land already acquired. The development was named \"Observation City\" as it was intended to be used to observe the America's Cup in 1987.\nDue to the desire for the hotel's completion before the 1987 America's Cup, Bond Corporation wanted to speed up the development's approval. Bond Corporation property manager Bruce Buckley said in a letter to the mayor of Stirling in February 1984 that \"we have set ourselves a difficult task in scheduling to have this project completed by late 1986 and we can only make this time frame by way of receiving positive Council support in all aspects in the shortest possible time.\" During February and March 1984 was a 21-day period where the development was advertised for public comment. The City of Stirling Planning Department received 5,327 submissions, of which 4,534 were in support of the development and 793 were opposed. The Scarborough Ratepayers Association was strongly opposed, and they presented a petition with 4,000 signatures opposing the project. The ratepayers association also claimed that a majority of councillors would vote against development approval, which also convinced Bond Corporation that the development approval was at risk. The Planning Department recommended that council approve the development, subject to numerous conditions, which were described as \"onerous\" by the WA Inc royal commission report.\nOn 20 March 1984, the development application was approved by council. Voting in favour were councillors Cash, Strickland, Tyzack, Grierson, McNamara, Satchell, Venville, Hancock, Anderson, and Britton. Voting against approval were councillors Camilleri, Smith, and Edwards. The hotel was built in 1986.\nIn the early 1990s, the Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters investigated allegations of bribery during the approval of the hotel. In 1987, former premier of Western Australia Ray O'Connor falsely told Labor MP Terry Burke that he had bribed City of Stirling councillors on behalf of Bond Corporation to approve the hotel's development application. The commission eventually determined that no bribery took place, and that O'Connor had kept the $25,000 cheque given to him by Bond Corporation for himself. O'Connor was charged in May 1993 with stealing the $25,000 cheque, and in February 1995, he was convicted and sentenced to 18 months in prison. He was released on parole after six months in prison.\n\n\n=== After opening ===\nSingaporean company Straits Trading Company bought Observation City for $45.5 million in 1994, the company's first property purchase in Australia.\nCelebrities to have stayed at Observation City include Michael Jackson, Bono, and Kylie Minogue.\nIn March 2008, Straits announced a proposed $120 million redevelopment of the hotel. The plan involved converting the existing 333 hotel rooms to 102 luxury apartments, a new eight storey hotel on the southern end of the site with 142 rooms, and two levels for restaurants, cafes and retail outlets. Architecture firm Hassell designed the redevelopment. 28 out of 34 public submissions during March 2008 supported the proposal. In July 2008, the City of Stirling's Planning and Development Committee recommended that council reject the proposal, as the development did not retain enough hotel or retail space, which would hurt Scarborough's standing as a tourist spot. The Stirling council voted the following month to reject the proposal. In September 2008, Straits appealed the decision at the State Administrative Tribunal, but the same month, the minister for planning and infrastructure, Alannah MacTiernan, used call-in provisions of the Planning and Development Act to give herself the power of final approval. Straits announced in March 2009 that the proposal had been put on hold due to the Global Financial Crisis, with Straits Trading Company President Norman Ip saying that \"due to the current economic environment, it is not an ideal time to launch a luxury apartment project of this scale\".\nA draft planning scheme revealed in November 2009 proposed restrictions to the Observation City site, restricting it to tourism use only, preventing conversion to apartments. Planning Minister John Day said the hotel was critical to the growth of tourism in the area.\nA new proposal was made in October 2011, which involved two new eight storey apartment buildings to the north and south of the hotel building, and a refurbishment of the hotel. The northern building would have 60 apartments and the southern building would have 84 apartments. The Stirling council approved the development application in December 2011, and it was sent to the Western Australian Planning Commission for final approval.\nIn May 2014, the Rendezvous Hotel was reopened following a $60 million refurbishment.\n\n\n== See also ==\nRendezvous Hotel Singapore\nPacific Tower, Christchurch\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\"Bribery Allegations – Observation City\".

It was written by Makoto Ueda and directed by Junta Yamaguchi, starring Riko Fujitani. It was produced by Europe Kikaku, and is a sequel to Ueda and Yamaguchi's Beyond the Infinite Two Minutes (2020).\nSet in an old ryokan in the village of Kibune in winter, the movie follows the story of a group of people who get caught in a repeating two-minute loop and are unable to get out.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nFujiya is a long-established winter ryokan and restaurant in Kibune, Kyoto. Mikoto, a waitress, is standing by the Kibune River behind the annex, clenching her fist gently and thinking about something. Soon she returns to work and cleans up the room with the head waiter, but somehow she finds herself repeatedly returning to the bank of the river where she was two minutes ago.\nAfter an introduction and the title screen, the film is composed of two-minute sequences shot in a single take. All the characters remember what happened before the clock resets, so that they quickly realize that they are in a time loop. Some strangers also appear, such as a woman asking for help due to a breakdown. After some sequences, the main characters try to guess the possible causes of the loop in order to break the cycle, which will be done at the last sequence, thanks to cooperation between the characters.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRiko Fujitani as Mikoto\nYūki Torigoe as Taku\nManami Honjō as Kimi\nSaori as Chino\nMunenori Nagano as the head clerk\nTakashi Sumita as head chef\nYoshifumi Sakai as Eiji\nYoshimasa Kondo as Obata\nMasashi Suwa as Nomiya\nKōda Ishida as Kusumi\nHaruki Nakagawa as Sugiyama\nShiori Kubo as Hisame\nKazunari Tosa as hunter\nMasahiro Kuroki as Shiraki\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRiver at IMDb\nOfficial site (in Japanese)",

        "content": "The EcoCute (エコキュート, ekokyūto) is an energy-efficient electric Air source heat pump, only for water heating and supply system, not use for air conditioning or alike,  that uses heat extracted from the air to heat water for domestic, industrial and commercial use. Instead of the more conventional ammonia or haloalkane gases, EcoCute uses supercritical carbon dioxide as a refrigerant. The technology offers a means of energy conservation and reduces the emission of greenhouse gas. It is a registered trademark of Kansai Electric Power Company.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name of the EcoCute comes from the Japanese phrase Shizen Reibai Hīto Ponpu Kyūtō-ki (自然冷媒ヒートポンプ給湯機), which literally means \"natural refrigerant heat pump water heater\".\n Eco is a contraction of either ecology or economical and Cute is a near homonym to kyūtō (給湯); literally \"supply hot water\".\n\n\n== Features and demand ==\nIn Japan in 1998, water heating (Kyuto (給湯, kyūtō)) accounted for 33.8% of typical domestic energy consumption, with air conditioner and kerosene heater heating accounting for another 26.9% and cooling by air conditioner another 2.3%. Most of the remaining 37% was spent on electrical home appliances, a field where 21st-century innovations in energy conservation began to make considerable energy savings. This left hot water supply as the most difficult area for energy conservation, leaving a gap in the market for the EcoCute. By January 2005, 26 Japanese companies were producing more than 450 models of EcoCute machines, and sales of domestic units increased 130–150% each year between 2001 and 2005.\nDenso first introduced the EcoCute outside Japan at the COP9 Milan, Italy on December 9, 2003. From 2007, Denso began concentrating on marketing the EcoCute in the EU. In Japan, the Japanese government incorporated the EcoCute into its CO2 reduction program under the Kyoto Protocol, mandating the installation of 5.2 million units in commercial and domestic properties by 2010.\n\n\n== History ==\nSee - Air source heat pump#History\n\n\n== EcoCute machine basics ==\nAn EcoCute machine or system consists of a heat pump and hot water storage unit. The sealed components are serially connected with refrigerant CO2 gas in circulation.\n\nAt the first stage, a heat exchanger collects heat from the air outside to use as energy for the refrigerant. Air flow is usually obtained using a centrifugal fan; in cold areas with ambient temperatures around −20 to −25 °C an auxiliary fan heater is attached.\nA gas compressor is used to increase the temperature of the gaseous CO2 refrigerant to around 100 °C under pressure of 10MPa via adiabatic compression. The carbon dioxide becomes a supercritical fluid.Several types of compressors can be used, including dual layer cylindrical compressors, scroll compressors, and dual stage rotary compressors.\nAt the third stage a heat exchanger transfers energy from the hot refrigerant into water to produce hot water. Water temperatures around 50 °C and up are suitable at this stage.\nFinally, ejector or expansion valvesreduce pressure on the refrigerant, letting it cool via adiabatic expansion and revert to CO2 gas from supercritical fluid, then circulation back to the first stage.\nRefrigerant carbon dioxide (CO2) is numbered or coded as R-744 by ASHRAE standard 34. The EcoCute can derive two to five unit ratio of COP (Coefficient Of Performance) to heated hot water energy from outdoor air with single unit input of electrical energy, resulting in reduced CO2 emissions compared to water heating via electricity or natural gas.\nThe COP value changes on temperature of outside air and water feed in.\nTo produce 90 °C hot water, an EcoCute consumes 75% less electricity than an electric water heater, and costs 80% less than heating water by natural gas in Japan. Also, by reducing use of fossil fuels, the EcoCute results 50% reduction in CO2 emissions.\nNot considering upstream losses of input source energy, as one example reference value, the EcoCute's COP is 3.8 in industrial use, while electric power water heating is 1.0, and gas boiler is 0.88 including pilot light loss.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCategory:Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning companies\nTranscritical cycle\nAir source heat pump\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAbout Heat Pump water heater, About Eco Cute Archived 2012-07-12 at the Wayback Machine English Home > LEARNINGS > About Eco Cute, Heat Pump & Thermal Storage Technology Center of Japan (HPTCJ), access date 2024 Feb. 8\nHeating/Residential heat pump systems/Hot water/European EcoCute?

        "content": "Chetan Nayak is an American physicist and distinguished professor known for his contributions to the field of condensed matter physics and quantum computing. He is currently a Technical Fellow at Microsoft and holds a professorship in physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB).\nNayak's research topics include topological phases of matter, high-temperature superconductivity, quantum Hall effect, and periodically driven quantum systems.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nNayak was born and raised in New York City. He attended Stuyvesant High School, graduating in 1988. In his senior year, he won 1st place in the national Westinghouse Science Talent Search. He then pursued his undergraduate studies at Harvard University, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1992.\nHe obtained his Ph.D. at Princeton University in 1996. Following his doctoral studies, he completed a post-doctoral fellowship at the Institute for Theoretical Physics at UCSB.\n\n\n== Career ==\nNayak served as a professor of physics at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) from 1997 to 2006 before joining UCSB as a professor of physics in 2007. Additionally, he was a visiting professor at Nihon University in Japan in 2002.\nIn 2005, Nayak transitioned to a role at Microsoft.\nIn 2014, he became the principal research manager of Microsoft Station Q, a research lab focused on quantum computing and condensed matter physics.\nIn 2018, he assumed leadership of the quantum hardware division of Microsoft's quantum program. He was named a Technical Fellow in 2023.\n\n\n== Research ==\nNayak has conducted pioneering research on topological phases of matter, which has laid the groundwork for the development of fault-tolerant quantum computation. In collaboration with physicist Frank Wilczek in 1996, Nayak discovered the non-Abelian statistics associated with Majorana zero modes, a fundamental concept crucial for Microsoft's quantum computer architecture.\nIn 2000, along with Sudip Chakravarty, Bob Laughlin, and Dirk Morr, he proposed the concept of hidden order in high-temperature superconductors.\nIn 2005, Nayak, along with Michael Freedman and Sankar Das Sarma, initiated efforts to build a topological quantum computer utilizing the 5/2 fractional quantum Hall state.\nNayak's research interests also extend to high-temperature superconductivity, 'strange metals,' the effects of impurities on electronic behavior, and phases of periodically driven quantum systems. In 2008, he authored a seminal article surveying the field of topological quantum computing.\nIn 2016, Nayak, along with Dominic Else and Bela Bauer, revived the concept of \"time crystals\" and predicted their occurrence in periodically driven systems. This prediction was experimentally verified shortly thereafter.\n\n\n== Recognition and awards ==\nNayak is a Fellow of the American Physical Society and has received the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Fellowship, the National Science Foundation Early Career Award, and the Outstanding Young Physicist Award from the American Chapter of the Indian Physics Association.\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\nNayak, Chetan; Simon, Steven H.; Stern, Ady; Freedman, Michael; Das Sarma, Sankar (12 September 2008). \"Non-Abelian anyons and topological quantum computation\".

The galaxy lies 720 million light-years from the solar system and has an estimated diameter of 180,000 thousand light-years meaning the galaxy is much larger compared to the Milky Way. IC 3053 was first discovered by Royal Harwood Frost on May 7, 1904. Despite listed in the Virgo Cluster Catalogue as VCC 95, it is not a member of the Virgo Cluster due to its high redshift and instead a background galaxy.\n\n\n== Supernova ==\nCore-collapse supernova, iPTF14bbs was discovered in January 2014 in IC 3053. It was located at Right Ascension of (12hr 13min 51s.816) and Declination of (+14 degrees 13'10\".85). The type was unknown.\n\n\n== References ==",

The ground floor still houses the functioning Caffè dell'Ussero, founded in 1775.\n\n\n== History and description ==\nThe palace was built in the 14th-century from the combination of two medieval towers at the site by the Astajo family. Over the following century, the palace was owned by various other families including the Della Seta, Fantini and Venerosi, until it was acquired in 1496 by the Agostini family. Descendants of the family still own the palace.\nThe structure is made of red brick and terracotta, and also known as the Palazzo Rosso (Red Palace). The mullioned windows are framed with decorative terracotta facing. Originally the 3rd floor was an open loggia. Adjacent to the palace was one of the oldest Italian cinemas, the Cinema Lumière, inaugurated in 1905 and closed in 2011 and transformed into a stage venue for concerts and music.\nThe Caffè dell'Ussero gained its name from a group of hussars who arrived in Pisa with Grand Grand-Duke Francis I in 1750, and who lodged in the palace. The coffee shop became a meeting spot for educated Pisans. It also became of spot for meeting of Italian patriots, and was a spot for departure of the locals who joined the Tuscan university battalion for the 1848 Battle of Curtatone and Montanara was organized.\n\n\n== References ==",

The song was described by Swims as about saving his own life and finding the courage to walk out on an abusive relationship that played a part in driving his friends and family out of his life. He further said: \"It was so hard to convince myself of that at the moment, but that’s when my priorities shifted from her to me, to saving myself, to loving myself again. ‘The Door’ is about believing that you're always going to be okay if you trust in yourself.\"\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Bernardo Francisco Timmermann Buschung (18 August 1912 – 1 November 1986), was a Chilean politician, mountaineer, and photographer of German origin, accused during the World War II of espionage, being prosecuted for sending information to the Nazi Germany government, leading an espionage group with other Germans Chileans. which would be dismantled by the Chilean police, with the help of the FBI. Decades after serving his prison sentence, he served as mayor of Cabrero, being appointed by the Government of Chile, during the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBernardo Francisco Timmermann Buschung was born in Concepción, on August 18, 1912. He was the son of Richard Timmermann and Adelhaide Bouschong, two German immigrants who arrived in Chile at the time of the German colonization of Valdivia, Osorno and Llanquihue.\n\n\n== Life at war ==\nWhile World War II was taking place in the rest of the world, Timmermann lived in Chile, a country that did not have direct participation in the conflict until its end in 1945. At that time, according to an inquest by the Investigations Police of Chile, through its Departamento 50, German Chileans circles were formed that supported the Nazi Regime, to carry out a process of Nazification of the resident German community. Those involved maintained a radio network, where they maintained communication of secret information to Germany. The Chilean police, with the help of the FBI, disrupted the network and mass arrests were made of those involved, among them its main leaders Albert von Appen, Augusto Kroll, and Timmermann himself.\n\n\n== After the war ==\nHaving already served his sentence, Timmermann moved to Yumbel, where he acquired a series of properties between 1957 and 1963, adjacent to Laja Falls, some of which suffered expropriation in 1968, during the Chilean land reform; and in addition, he suffered a series of attempts to illegally appropriate his land, when the reform became radicalized, during the Unidad Popular government of Salvador Allende. His political differences with the Allende government, which was finally overthrown in 1973, made Timmermann approach the new dictatorial government of Augusto Pinochet, being appointed mayor of Cabrero in 1976, as successor to Manfred Suiter, renowned racing driver, also German Chilean.\nHe died on November 1, 1986, in Santiago, Chile. He is buried in Monte Águila, Cabrero.\n\n\n== References ==",

Craven graduated from Roxbury Latin School in 1952, Harvard College in 1956, and the Portia School of Law in 1962.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nCraven was an unsuccessful candidate for the Massachusetts Senate in 1964. From 1967 to 1969, he represented the 2nd district on the Massachusetts Governor's Council. He unsuccessfully ran for sheriff of Suffolk County rather than seeking reelection. In 1969, Craven was elected to the Boston School Committee. He was one of the committee's more conservative members and opposed efforts to desegregate the city's schools. In 1970, he sought the Democratic nomination for Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts, but finished fifth out of five candidates with 8% of the vote. In 1971, he was an unsuccessful candidate for the Boston City Council.\nIn 1973, Craven was appointed clerk of the Boston Municipal Court for criminal business by Governor Francis Sargent. In 1982, he was appointed to a judgeship on the Boston Juvenile Court by Governor Edward J. King. He retired from the bench in 2005.\nCraven died on November 22, 2011, in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, of complications of Lewy body dementia. \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Henry Blair (born David Lewis Blakely; 1932 or 1933) is an American former film and radio actor. \n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nBorn in Los Angeles, Blair is the son of Lewis Herbert Blakely and Winifred Myrtle \"Winnie\" Pollard, the latter a British Columbia native and a skilled performer in her own right, who—after emigrating from Vancouver to Los Angeles in 1923—founded and directed the Winifred Pollard School of Dancing from 1925 until at least 1935. The family resided in Roscoe, California, where Kevin attended the Vineland Elementary School. He later attended Hollywood Professional School and Chapman College.\nOf particular note among Blair's recurring radio credits are his portrayal of Ricky Nelson on The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet from its inception in 1944 until 1949 (at which point Nelson himself joined the cast), as well as the roles of \"Donnie Henderson\" on Beulah, \"Skipper\" on One Man's Family, \"Little Quincey\" on The Baby Snooks Show, \"Eddie Powers\" on Masquerade, and Blair's favorite among his radio characters, \"Little Beaver\" on Red Ryder. One especially notable non-recurring highlight was the April 29, 1947 episode of My Favorite Story, featuring Blair as the title character in Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist, as adapted for radio by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee.\nOn the night of February 11, 1948 (as reported the following day by The Hollywood Reporter), Blair made his 1,000th radio appearance.  On February 11, 1951, Blair, along with fellow \"Radiomites\" Michael Blair—no relation—and Norma Jean Nilssen, were the featured guests on local disc jockey Al Jarvis's talk show on KLAC-TV in Los Angeles. \nAmidst Blair's largely unsung film career, comprised principally of bit parts, often uncredited, one notable exception stands out. Zeroing in on Blair's contribution to Trail Blazers (Allied Artists' 1953 juvenile delinquency-themed second feature), the Waterloo Courier concludes its otherwise purely descriptive three-sentence review, \"Henry Blair, as Spike, whose destructive prank more than once put police upon his trail, is excellent, particularly in those scenes depicting him as a reformed youngster.\"\nApart from Blair's radio work, notable audio-only assignments include voicing the title characters, respectively, on three albums produced by Alan Livingston: Sparky and the Talking Train, Sparky's Magic Piano, and Rusty in Orchestraville. Onscreen, he voiced the titular antagonist of MGM's 1944 animated cartoon short subject, Barney Bear's Polar Pest.\n\n\n== Partial filmography ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHenry Blair at IMDb\nHenry Blair at Old Time Radio Researchers.",

        "content": "The No Quarter Catch Crew (NQCC) is an American professional wrestling stable, current performing in WWE on the NXT brand. The group currently consists of Charlie Dempsey, Damon Kemp and Myles Borne. They also included founder and leader Drew Gulak before he was removed from television. Dempsey is the current NXT Heritage Cup Champion in his first reign.\n\n\n== History ==\nAt the end of 2022, Drew Gulak was assigned to NXT, where he played the role of Hank Walker's mentor. On February 14, 2023, episode of NXT, Gulak turned on Walker and aligned with Charlie Dempsey, creating the stable No Quarter Catch Crew (NQCC). On the August 8 episode of NXT, Damon Kemp assisted both Gulak and Dempsey during their tag team match, officially joining NQCC. On the September 12 episode of NXT, Myles Borne joined the NQCC by turning on both Josh Briggs and Brooks Jensen during their six-man tag team match.\nOn the February 27, 2024, episode of NXT, Dempsey defeated The Meta-Four's Noam Dar 2–1 under British Rounds Rules for the NXT Heritage Cup. The following week at NXT: Roadblock, NQCC announced that the NXT Heritage Cup will be defended by the whole stable under the \"Catch Clause\". Under the Catch Clause, NQCC as a whole referred to themselves as the NXT Heritage Cup Champions but WWE only recognize Dempsey as the official champion. The Catch Clause was invoked on the March 19 episode of NXT, with Gulak defeating Chase University's Riley Osborne 2–1 to successfully defend the Cup. On the April 16 episode of NXT, The D'Angelo Family leader Tony D'Angelo revealed that his Family were hired by NQCC to (kayfabe) eliminate Gulak. In reality, Gulak was written off following allegations from Ronda Rousey that Gulak grabbed her pants' drawstrings backstage in 2022. D'Angelo demanded payment for the job but NQCC refused, causing a brawl between the two factions and resulting in a six-man tag team match between the two factions at Week 1 of Spring Breakin', which was won by the D'Angelo Family (D'Angelo, Channing \"Stacks\" Lorenzo and Luca Crusifino).\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Former ===\n\n\n== Championships and accomplishments ==\nWWE\nNXT Heritage Cup (1 time, current) – Charlie Dempsey\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNo Quarter Catch Crew at Cagematch.net",

        "content": "Xi'an Chongde Ronghai Football Club (Chinese: 西安崇德荣海足球俱乐部) is a Chinese professional football club based in Xi'an, Shaanxi, that competes in China League Two, the third tier of Chinese football. Xi'an Chongde Ronghai plays its home matches at the Xi'an Olympic Sports Center, located within Baqiao District.\n\n\n== History ==\nXi'an Ronghai Football Club was founded in January 2021 by Yang Xiaolong, the owner of the now-defunct Xi'an Wolves, registering as a member of the Xi'an Football Association. In May 2021, they participated in the Xi'an FA Cup, and after winning five matches out of a possible five, they were crowned winners, becoming eligible to compete in the 2021 Chinese Champions League (CMCL). In the regional competition, Xi'an Ronghai topped their respective group, grabbing two wins and a draw, which set up a place in a play-off to progress into the final round. After beating local opponent Xi'an Yilian on penalties, the club advanced into the final sixteen. They were drawn into Group C which consisted of Jinan Xingzhou, Jiangsu Zhongnan Codion, and Yuxi Yukun Steel, Xi'an Ronghai finished bottom, putting an end to the season, ranked 16th. In the 2022 CMCL season, Xi'an Ronghai finished second in their respective group, but were knocked out by Tianjin Fusheng in the elimination play-off round.\nBy April 2023, the club rebranded its name to Xi'an Chongde Ronghai Football Club. They were slotted into the Changzhi region, where, after picking up three wins, one draw, and a loss to Langfang Glory City, they progressed into the final round. After the seventh match against Shenzhen Juniors that could have seen Ronghai jump to first place and subsequently win promotion, Xi'an Chongde Ronghai finished in second place, entering the promotion play-offs. On 21 October 2023, Ronghai hosted Guangxi Hengchen in the first round, which ended in a loss for Ronghai through a penalty shoot-out, missing out on promotion. By 6 February 2024, Xi'an Chongde Ronghai were not included in the initial list of teams in the 2024 China League Two. However, Xi'an Chongde Ronghai were confirmed a spot on 22 February, a few days after Jinan Xingzhou announced its dissolution. During this period on 20 February, the club appointed Wu Yan as their new head coach.\nOn 15 March 2024, a week before the upcoming China League Two season, Xi'an Chongde Ronghai announced that they would use Shaanxi Province Stadium as their home ground, groundsharing with fellow China League Two club Shaanxi Union, who they form a Shaanxi derby in the professional leagues with, for the first time in twenty years in Shaanxi football history. On 5 April 2024, in a 2–2 league draw with Dalian K'un City, Gong Zheng scored the club's first professional goal. On 11 April 2024, after a single home league game, Xi'an Chongde Ronghai reached out to the public to resolve issues with their home ground, as they could not remain financially stable if they kept using Shaanxi Province Stadium. By 15 April, the club started using Xi'an Olympic Sports Center as their home ground.\n\n\n== Players ==\n\n\n=== First-team squad ===\nAs of 23 March 2024\n\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules. Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality.\n\n\n== Managerial staff ==\n\n\n== References ==",

It has a production of more than 2,000,000 tons of coal per year and employs nearly 1,500 workers.\nIn 2018, the company went into liquidation.\n\n\n== History ==\nVictorino Alonso's takeoff in the mining sector began when he acquired Minero Siderúrgica de Ponferrada in 1994, a company that was in technical bankruptcy and owned by Caja España, one of its creditors. Already in 1989, Alonso became a shareholder of Hullas de Barruelo, which exploited the coal mining area of the Rubagón region, in Barruelo de Santullán (Palencia).\nIn 1994, through its company Lexomosa, it absorbed Carbonia and Minas de Ventana, forming Carbones León Norte, S.A. (CARLENOR). In March 1998, CARLENOR changed its name to Unión Minera del Norte, S.A. (UMINSA) to acquire, three months later, Antracitas de Fabero, Antracitas de Brañuelas, Mina de Fontoria, Explotaciones Mineras de Caboalles, Minas Santa Leocadia and all of Hullas de Barruelo.\nIn 1999, it purchased almost the entire Palencia mining basin, formed at that time by Antracitas de Velilla, in Velilla del Río Carrión, Antracitas del Norte in Aviñante and Velilla de Tarilonte, Sociedad Minera San Luis de Guardo, Antracitas de San Claudio (which had closed its last subway mine a few months before) in Castrejón de la Peña and Antracitas de Montebismo in La Pernía. Only Carbones San Isidro, with a small operation in Velilla del Río Carrión, remained outside the domain of Victorino Alonso's group. By 2010, Alonso had closed all these exploitations, keeping only \"Las Cuevas\" pit in Velilla del Río Carrión and two open pit mines in Guardo and Castrejón de la Peña open, and employing only about 150 workers. In 2012 it announced the closure of the \"Las Cuevas\" pit, and the transfer of its 80 employees to Tinéu. In 2014 it only maintains active the Muñeca open pit in Guardo and plans to reopen the Castrejón de la Peña open pit.\nIn the province of León, UMINSA absorbed Antracitas de Fabero in 1997 and Coto Minero del Sil in 2000, as well as the entire basin of the Laciana and Torre del Bierzo region, including operations such as Mina Mora Primera and Sociedad Santa Bárbara, both in the area of Piedrafita de Babia. Thus, in 2003, the company had 1,053 employees in the province of León. In 2010 it closed the San Miguel group in Laciana, significantly reducing the number of mining operations in this region of Leon. In 2011 it closed the Brañuelas mine in Torre del Bierzo, so that in El Bierzo, after the closure of the Santa Cruz group in Páramo del Sil in 2012 it only maintains the open pit of Fabero with 250 workers and the Salgueiro Group in Torre del Bierzo. In 2014 it only kept open in the Bierzo area the Salgueiro Group and the open pit Gran Corta de Fabero.\nIn Asturias, the company had operations in Cangas del Narcea, Tinéu, Degaña and Ibias, where it acquired Coto Minero del Narcea and Antracitas de Tinéu in 2003. In 2011 it closed Coto Narcea in Monasterio and Antisa in Tinéu, so in 2012 it only had the Pilotuerto mine in Tinéu. In 2014, only the Pilotuerto mine in Tinéu remains in operation. It also keeps some layers of the Cerredo inland mine owned by Minera AsturLeonesa in operation, although this agreement is in the process of being dissolved.\nIn 2010, UMINSA was the main private company in the mining sector in Spain, ahead of Coto Minero Cantábrico, which is also owned by Victorino Alonso and which arose in 2008 as a result of the merger of Minero Siderúrgica de Ponferrada and Hullas del Coto Cortés, with activity in the Asturian basin.\nUMINSA has received from different sectors accusations of capturing its profits thanks to state aid to coal mining. In 2010, the company received 81.6 million euros in aid to the sector from the state.\nIn July 2013, the company entered voluntary insolvency proceedings, due to its high debt, and in 2018 into liquidation as a step prior to its dissolution.\n\n\n== Properties ==\nUMINSA's annexes by province and year of acquisition are as follows:\n\n\n=== Province of León ===\n1998: Antracitas de Fabero, Antracitas de Brañuelas, Minera de Fontoria, Minas Santa Leocadia, Explotaciones Mineras Caboalles and Minas de Lumajo.\n1999: Antracitas La Silva.\n2000: Minera de Torre.\n2002: Coto Minero del Sil, Mina Mora and Sociedad Santa Bárbara.\n2003: Minas y Expl. Industriales, Carbones El Túnel, Industrias Carfema and Minas del Bierzo.\n2004: Antracitas de La Granja, Antracitas de Arlanza, Adelina Mine and Los Compadres Mine.\n2009: Campomanes Hermanos and Virgilio Riesco.\n\n\n=== Province of Palencia ===\n1998: Hullas de Barruelo\n1999: Antracitas de Velilla, Sociedad Minera San Luis, Antracitas del Norte, Antracitas San Claudio and Antracitas de Montebismo.\n\n\n=== Asturias ===\n2004: Coto Minero del Narcea and Antracitas de Tinéu.\n2008: González y Díez S.A. (Tinéu).\n\n\n== Controversy ==\nUMINSA's methods have been criticized by both trade unions and environmental groups, due to the non-payment of the miners' salaries as a means of pressure to receive public funds on the one hand, and the exploitation of open-pit mines in protected areas in the provinces of León and Palencia on the other. In addition, Victorino Alonso's business network has aroused the suspicions of various groups, who maintain that his sole objective in leading the sector is to obtain state subsidies and to close the mines. Thus, in 1996 he was the subject of an investigation by the judicial police unit of the Guardia Civil which revealed possible fraud and an unjustified increase in assets, although the Ministry of Industry subsequently informed that it would not initiate investigations into his alleged irregularities.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "State of Arizona v. Kelli Ward, et al. is a state criminal prosecution concerning the Trump fake electors plot in Arizona. The eighteen defendants, including eleven Arizona Republicans and seven Donald Trump associates, are accused of producing and attempting to use a certificate of ascertainment to falsely claim Trump had won the state's electoral votes in the 2020 U.S. presidential election in Arizona. The eleven fake electors included former Arizona Republican Party chair Kelli Ward, who allegedly led ten other Republicans in signing the fraudulent certificate. The indictment contains nine criminal counts, including felony fraud, forgery and conspiracy.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nJoe Biden won the 2020 presidential election in Arizona, carrying the state by 10,457 votes, and gaining all of the state's eleven electoral votes. Incumbent President Donald Trump lost the election in Arizona (as well as nationally), in both the popular vote and in the electoral votes. Trump and his allies refused to accept the election results, launching an extensive and ultimately unsuccessful campaign seeking the subvert the election outcome, and remain in power. Lawsuits filed by Trump and Arizona Republicans, seeking to overturn the election, were rejected by the courts.\nOn December 14, 2020, Arizona's legitimate electors met to formally cast their ballots for Biden, typically a procedural formality. On the same day, the 11 Arizona fake electors—designated by the Republican Party as the slate for Trump—gathered at the Arizona Republican Party headquarters in Phoenix and signed a certificate of ascertainment falsely asserting that they were the \"duly elected and qualified\" electors, and purporting to cast the state's electors for Trump. The Arizona Republican Party posted video of the signing on social media, including Twitter, that day. As part of Trump's pressure campaign to overturn the election results, similar slates of \"alternate\" Republican Party electors cast invalid electoral votes for Trump in other swing states where Trump was defeated, namely Georgia, Michigan, and Nevada. The fake electors' certificates were sent to Congress and the National Archives, which did not accept them.\nIn 2021, Maricopa County ballots were audited by Arizona Republican senators to search for fraud that might show Trump had won Arizona. No fraud was found.\n\n\n== Investigation ==\nArizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, a Republican, did not investigate the matter. His successor, Democrat Kris Mayes, took office in January 2023. She examined the fake elector scheme, initially focusing the investigation on actions in Phoenix. In October 2023, Kenneth Chesebro began cooperating with investigators in election interference cases after he pleaded guilty in the Georgia prosecution. Arizona investigators interviewed him in December, and he provided information that allowed Mayes to target Trump allies from out of state who participated in the Arizona scheme.\nIn addition to the Georgia prosecution, Michigan and Nevada have also brought charges against fake electors, making Arizona the fourth state to do so as part of a broader Trump fake electors plot.\n\n\n== Indictment ==\nOn April 25, 2024, an Arizona grand jury in the Arizona Superior Court for Maricopa County handed up a 58-page indictment against 11 Arizona Republicans and seven top Trump aides. The defendants are charged with nine counts of conspiracy, fraud, and forgery (all felonies) from the approximate date range of the November 3, 2020 election through the electoral vote certification on January 6, 2021: \n\nCount 1, class 2 felony of conspiracy: Conspiring with others \"known and/or unknown\"\nCount 2, class 2 felony of fraudulent schemes and artifices: Knowingly benefiting from any fraud designed for \"preventing the lawful transfer of the presidency of the United States, keeping President Donald J. Trump in office against the will of Arizona voters, and depriving Arizona voters of their right to vote and have their votes counted\"\nCount 3, class 5 felony of fraudulent schemes and practices: Concealing facts or making false statements related to both Trump/Pence certificates \"filed by the Arizona Republican electors with the Arizona Secretary of State\"\nCount 4, class 4 felony of forgery: Forging a Trump/Pence certificate \"filed by the Arizona Republican electors with the President of the United States Senate\"\nCount 5, class 4 felony of forgery: Forging the first of two Trump/Pence certificates \"filed by the Arizona 8 Republican electors with the Arizona Secretary of State\"\nCount 6, class 4 felony of forgery: Forging the second of two Trump/Pence certificates \"filed by the Arizona Republican electors with the Arizona Secretary of State\"\nCount 7, class 4 felony of forgery: Forging the first of two Trump/Pence certificates \"filed by the Arizona Republican electors with the Archivist of the United States\"\nCount 8, class 4 felony of forgery: Forging the second of two Trump/Pence certificates \"filed by the Arizona Republican electors with the Archivist of the United States\"\nCount 9, class 4 felony of forgery: Forging a Trump/Pence certificate \"filed by the Arizona Republican electors with the Chief Judge of the Federal District Court for the District of Arizona\"\nThe indictment alleges that, from the day after the 2020 election, Trump allies began discussing a fake elector scheme to change the election results. This challenges a claim typically made by Republicans that the slate of pro-Trump electors was merely an \"alternate\" option in the event that the election results were challenged.\nThe indictment also alleges that local Republicans in Arizona in November meanwhile tried to cast doubt on the validity of the election results, and that on November 30, 2020, Giuliani and Ellis came to Phoenix to speak to Rusty Bowers.\n\n\n=== Defendants ===\n\n\n==== Fake electors ====\n\n\n==== Trump aides ====\n\n\n=== Unindicted co-conspirators ===\nThe indictment describes, but does not name, five unindicted co-conspirators, whom are identifiable based on the indictment's descriptions of their conduct.\n\n\"Unindicted Coconspirator 1\": Trump\n\"Unindicted Coconspirator 2\": Kelly Townsend, Republican former state senator\n\"Unindicted Coconspirator 3\": Mark Finchem, Republican former state representative\n\"Unindicted Coconspirator 4\": Trump attorney Kenneth Chesebro, who promoted the scheme to send alternate electors to Congress\n\"Unindicted Coconspirator 5\": Jack Wilenchik, an Arizona attorney who worked for the Trump campaign and facilitated the vote by the fake electors\n\n\n== See also ==\n2021 Maricopa County presidential ballot audit\nMichigan prosecution of fake electors\nGeorgia election racketeering prosecution\nPost-election lawsuits related to the 2020 United States presidential election from Arizona\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Michael Watts (born 1993) is an American television sports commentator. He has commentated soccer games including for the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL), USL Championship, and CONCACAF Champions League, and worked in other sports.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBorn in 1993, Watts grew up in the Cleveland suburb of Shaker Heights, Ohio. He played football in his youth until he had a back injury as a sophomore at Saint Ignatius High School. He then commentated school soccer, ice hockey, and other sports for the online Saint Ignatius Broadcasting Network, a new student club that he eventually led. He also helped run the school's Student Sports Information Department, writing a media guide about the football team. He graduated from Saint Ignatius in 2011 and received his degree in finance from Fordham University in New York City in 2014. While in college, he was a sports reporter, anchor, and manager for the NPR affiliate WFUV, covering college and professional sports in the New York area.\n\n\n== Broadcasting career ==\nWatts has worked as a freelance sports commentator for a range of sports leagues and networks. He first commentated professionally in 2014 for Sky Blue FC of the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) and was the league's youngest commentator. He became \"the voice of USL Championship\" as a play-by-play announcer on ESPN after first commentating for the league at the 2015 USL Cup final. He began commentating weekly during the 2016 USL season. Working with broadcast partner VISTA Worldlink led to him also commentating for the CONCACAF Champions League. He has hosted a Sirius XM radio show about the USL, USL All-Access, with analyst Devon Kerr since April 2021 and formerly hosted the radio show USL Coast to Coast.\nOutside of soccer, Watts has been a preseason commentator for the National Football League's Cincinnati Bengals, alongside color commentator Anthony Muñoz on the local WKRC-TV broadcast, since 2018. He has also commentated college football for the radio network Westwood One and been a public address announcer for sports events at Madison Square Garden in New York City.\nDuring a U.S. Open Cup game in April 2024, Watts and Kerr wove 235 song titles by Taylor Swift into their broadcast, and later that month he worked fifteen song titles from Swift's The Tortured Poets Department into an NWSL broadcast the day the album was released.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "On April 19, 2024, a Tupolev Tu-22M3 strategic supersonic bomber belonging to the Russian Air Force crashed in southern Russia's Stavropol region. The incident occurred after the bomber completed a combat mission.\n\n\n== Aircraft ==\nThe aircraft was a Soviet-Era Tupolev Tu-22M3, owned and operated by the Russian Air Force.\n\n\n== Accident ==\nOn April 19, 2024, a Tupolev Tu-22M3 strategic supersonic bomber belonging to the Russian Air Force met with disaster in southern Russia's Stavropol region. The incident occurred after the bomber completed a combat mission, occurring in the Krasnogvardeysky district, approximately 300 kilometers (185 miles) from Ukraine's borders. The crew members managed to eject from the aircraft. Of the four Russian Air Force crew on board, Two were rescued, one killed, and one missing as of April 28. According to Ukrainian reports, the Tu-22M3 was returning from an air strike on Ukraine when it was shot down. The Ukrainian Air Force and the GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine allegedly cooperated in bringing down the bomber. The Ukrainian Defense Intelligence claims that the Tu-22M3 was shot down at a distance of about 300 kilometers from Ukraine using the same means previously used to shoot down the Russian A-50U long-range radar detection and control aircraft. If confirmed as a “kill” by the Ukrainian Air Defense, this would be the first successful downing of a Russian strategic bomber since the beginning of the war in Ukraine.\n\n\n== Cause ==\nThere are conflicting reports about the cause of the crash. According to the Russian Ministry of Defense (MOD), the Tu-22M3 experienced an engine fire that eventually led to the crash. However, Ukrainian sources assert that the bomber was shot down in cooperation by the Ukrainian Air Force and the GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Igor Krutogolov's Toy Orchestra is an Israeli experimental band founded by the Israeli musician and composer Igor Krutogolov. The band was formed in 2005 and is based in Tel Aviv, Israel. The band has released five albums and has taken part in international festivals and acclaimed cinema and theatre productions.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nThe band's music has a unique style due to a blend of specific recognizable sound produced by toy instruments and a big variety of genres covered. The band's first album represented a mixture of styles and was described as \"experimental noise comedy\". Further albums contained both original songs with gibberish lyrics composed by Igor Krutogolov as well as a number of innovative and complex arrangements of songs of various genres including funk metal,  industrial, alternative rock, folk, jazz, electronic music etc. The band has lately produced a number of original disco songs influenced by the band's recent involvement in theatre and cinema work.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Igor Krutogolov's Karate Band ===\nIn 2005, Igor Krutogolov gathered a group of fellow musicians and friends to form a toy orchestra named Igor Krutogolov's Karate Band. The idea of the project was to use only toy musical instruments and toys to produce music. The band consisted of 11 members including Igor Krutogolov (composer, toy guitar, toy clarinet, voice), Ruslan Gross (toy guitar), Guy Schechter (toy drums), Olya Yelensky (toy keyboard), Ido Azaria (toy clarinet), Victor Levin (toy clarinet), Leonid Ulitsky (toy saxophone), Gregory Bado (toy trumpet), Tanya Bogoslavsky (toy xylophone), Einav Cohen (rubber toys), and Shelly Dublinsky (rubber toys). The band's first performance took place on April 7, 2005, at the Green Racoon club in Tel Aviv following the literary evening of the Russian postmodern writer Vladimir Sorokin.\nThe band's first album Children 4 Muzik was released in October 2005. The album was presented in November 2005 at the avant-garde music festival at the Zappa club in Tel Aviv.\nIn 2006, the band recorded a 56-minute cover of \"Consume Red\" by the Japanese musician Otomo Yoshihide and released it as a digital album Plays Ground Zero: Consume Red in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe album How to Be a Crocodile was released in 2014 and was presented at the Levontin 7 club in Tel Aviv on February 27, 2014. The band recorded original songs to the gibberish lyrics written by Igor Krutogolov under the nickname Mursulik. The album also includes the song to the poem by Daniil Kharms \"Zhuravli i Korabli\" (\"The Cranes and the Ships\"). The album featured a new line-up: Igor Krutogolov (toy guitar, vocals, toy accordion, toy noise), Guy Shechter (toy drums), Victor Levin (toy clarinet), Mihai Cernea (toy clarinet), Naomi Rosin (toy clarinet), Dror Pikielny (toy clarinet), Neil Kalman (toy clarinet, toy trumpet), Slava Frenklakh (toy keyboards, toy piano), Niv Majar (toy glockenspiel, toy xylophone, pigs), and Inbar Livne Bar-On (vocals). All the music on the album was composed by Igor Krutogolov.\n\n\n=== Igor Krutogolov's Toy Orchestra ===\nIn 2017, Igor Krutogolov's Karate Band was joined by a vocalist Yam Umi, the singer with the Israeli electric hardcore band Killing Machine. Thanks to Umi's voice, the band acquired new sound and the band's name was changed to Igor Krutogolov's Toy Orchestra. In 2017, the band released a new album Roots Over Roots consisting of two covers (\"Roots Over Roots\" by Sepultura and \"Over\" by Portishead). The band was also joined by the Israeli-British singer Yifeat Ziv (The Hazelnuts/האחיות לוז). The new line-up gave a concert in December 2018 at the Levontin 7 club in Tel Aviv.\nIn 2019, Israeli drummer Roy Chen (Megason, Malox) joined the band. The group performed live as part of the cultural and educational project \"Eshkolot\", supported by the Embassy of Israel in Russia. The band performed new covers, \"Little God in My Hands\" (by Swans) and \"Guerrilla Radio\" (by Rage Against the Machine) as well as other band's songs, including \"Zhuravli i korabli\" (\"The Cranes and the Ships\") performed by the Russian singer Anna Khvostenko. The concert program also included a masterclass for kids and the kids’ participation in the live performance with the band.\nIn 2022, the band released the album Live at Musrara Mix recorded at the Musrara Mix Festival 2020 in Jerusalem and issued two singles, \"Bebe La Sangre\" (2022) and \"Sucky\" (2022).\n\n\n== Film and theatre productions ==\nIn 2018, the band collaborated with the Israeli-American director, writer and artist Roee Rosen on the film Kafka for Kids (2022). The idea to use the toy orchestra in the film belonged to Igor Krutogolov, who composed music for the film. This brilliant idea, according to Roy Rosen, significantly influenced the visual and musical direction of the film. The band's musicians performed on set as part of the film's cast, with Yam Umi and Yifeat Ziv also playing additional parts. The film sketches including three songs performed live by the band, with Yifeat Ziv as a lead singer, were presented at the Steirischer Herbst Art Festival on September 22, 2018, at the Graz Orpheum theatre in Graz, Austria. The film Kafka for Kids premiered at the 2022 International Film Festival in Rotterdam, Netherlands (IFFR 2022) and was shown at the international film festivals in Marseille, France (FIDMarseille 2022), Curitiba, Brazil (Olhar de Cinema 2022), Lisbon, Portugal (Doclisboa 2022), Vienna, Austria (Viennale 2022) and Copenhagen, Denmark (CPH:DOX 2023). At the FIDMarseille festival, the film was awarded the Camargo Foundation award and the festival's highest prize, Air France Panavision. The film's soundtrack was released on LP in 2022.\nIn 2021, the band joined a multi-genre theatrical project TOYZZZ in collaboration with the Israeli dance theatre group led by Or Marin and Oran Nahum. The initial intention was to incorporate the band's current songs into the performance, but eventually Igor Krutogolov composed five more songs and co-authored the project. The band's musicians performed and interacted with nine theatre-group dancers in what was described as \"a combination of a party, a circus, an orgy and a closed ward\". The musical show TOYZZZ premiered at the 2021 Acre Fringe Theatre Festival in Israel and was presented at the festival 11 times. The show won several awards: best show, best design (space, costumes, light and music), best dance and a special prize for musical achievements (to composer Igor Krutogolov, singer Yam Umi and band Igor Krutogolov's Toy Orchestra). The show was presented to a wider audience in December 2021 in Tel Aviv at the Tmuna theatre where it was shown seven times.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n2005 – Children 4 Music, CD\n2014 – How to Be a Crocodile, CD\n2017 – Roots Over Roots, 7\"\n2021 – Plays Ground Zero: Consume Red\n2021 – TOYZZZ (soundtrack to show by Or Marin)\n2022 – Kafka for Kids (soundtrack to film by Roee Rosen), LP\n2022 – Live At Musrara Mix, CD\n2022 – Bebe La Sangre (single)\n2022 – Sucky (single)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nIgor Krutogolov's Toy Orchestra discography at Discogs \nIgor Krutogolov's Toy Orchestra on SoundCloud \nIgor Krutogolov's Toy Orchestra on Facebook \nIgor Krutogolov's Toy Orchestra on Instagram",

        "content": "Palazzo Gambacorti is a Gothic-style former aristocratic palace, located in Lungarno Gambacorti #1 corner with Piazza XX Settembre, near the spot the Ponte the Mezzo crosses over to the South bank of the Arno, in the historic center of Pisa, region of Tuscany, Italy. It is connected through the second floor of the white marble Loggia di Banchi, once the town archive. The palace is now houses the city council meetings in its Sala delle Baleari.\n\n\n== History and description ==\nA palace at the site was likely erected in the mid 11th century, along with a defensive tower to the south. The river facing facade we see today was commissioned between 1370 and 1392 by Pietro Gambacorti, a wealthy merchant; the design is attributed to Tommaso Pisano, son of Andrea Pisano. In the 1400s, after Pisa fell to the Florentines, the palace took over various government functions from customs to home of the priors. In 1533, it became property of the Tignoso family, who enlarged the palace. In 1698, with the new Grand-Ducal rule under the Lorraine, the palace housed the Magistrates. During the 19th-century, it housed the Archives of State in Pisa and barracks. From 2012 to 2015 the Sala Rossa and the Sala delle Baleari, were restored as well as their frescoes.\nThe Gothic facade has multichrom stone blocks. The mullioned windows, four on the ground floor and five in the floors above overlook the bank of the Arno. The south facade of via Toselli was erected in the 17th-century and above the portal is a crown with a shield honoring the Medici. An inscription recalls the capture of Pisa by Florence in 1509.\nThere are three grand halls of the palace, the Sala Rossa (Red Hall), so named for the red wall-paper has a ceiling fresco depicting Pisa honoring San Ranieri painted by Giuseppe and Francesco Melani. The Sala delle Baleari (Hall of the Balearics) is the largest and the ceiling is frescoed with the maritime victories by the Pisans, including a crusade in 1113 against the Muslim fources occupying the Balearic islands and the 1258 assault of Cagliari in Sardinia. These scenes were completed in 1693 by Giacomo Farelli. The central fresco shows the role of Pisans in the siege and capture of Jerusalem in 1099; this was completed by Cesare Dandini in 1695. The Sala degli Stemmi, decorated with the heraldic shield of prominent Pisan families, is presently used to officiate civil weddings.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nDerived from Italian Wikipedia entry",

        "content": "Lepperton railway station is a rural railway station on the Marton–New Plymouth line serving the village of Lepperton in New Zealand's Taranaki district. It is also the junction with the 7.25-kilometre (4.50 mi) Waitara Branch railway line.\nThe station no longer has goods handling facilities but is still used for the crossing of trains. It is also used by the Waitara Railway Preservation Society as a destination for their trains from Waitara.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe original railway station was opened on 6 February 1878, approximately 2.5 km (1 mile 45 chain) south of Sentry Hill, then the junction between the Waitara–New Plymouth Railway and the new southern line to Inglewood. The station was located close to the intersection of Mountain and Manutahi Roads. Facilities included a shelter shed and passenger platform, a loading bank for goods and a loop big enough to hold 26 wagons.\nThe station was originally called Manutahi, but this was changed in 1882 after the Patea–Wanganui railway reached the town of Manutahi in southern Taranaki. To avoid confusion, this station was renamed Lepperton after the closest settlement. The station must have been fairly quiet as on 30 November 1894 petitioners were recorded as protesting against the closure of the station. The station remained open but bigger changes were in store.\nIn 1907, it was desired to interlock the Sentry Hill station yard (the next station to the north of Lepperton). However, Sentry Hill station was located on a grade that caused issues for trains proceeding southwards to get underway after stopping. To rectify this, a new station was built on flatter land south of Sentry Hill, and roughly 1,400 metres (70 chains) north of Lepperton Station. Because of the short distance between the proposed new station and the existing Lepperton station, the railways decided to close the existing station and name the new station Lepperton Junction. On 25 May 1908, the old station was closed.\n\n\n== Lepperton Junction ==\nThe new Lepperton Junction was a much larger station. It featured an island platform with a station building and signal box, interlocked points and semaphore singles, water tanks, a mainline and passing loop on alternate sides of the station, and an engine turning triangle.\nFor goods traffic, there was also a goods shed and loading bank, stockyards, two goods loops off the main line that could hold 37 and 22 wagons respectively, two loops for branch line traffic that could hold 36 and 21 wagons, and a 19 wagon back shunt. Electricity was provided in 1927.\nThe Waitara branch railway was extended parallel to the main line from the former Sentry Hill to the new junction station, allowing for much easier transfers between branch and mainline services.\nDespite protests that the new station was less convenient for locals (and that the name board for the station was unnecessarily hidden under the station verandas), the new station was much more successful operationally. In the early 20th century, most passenger services from the mainline were met with connecting services on the Waitara Branch, including the Hawera–New Plymouth mixed trains and the passenger-only New Plymouth Mail train to Wellington.\n\n\n=== Replacement station ===\nBy 1965, the station and buildings were in a poor state of repair, so as part of the modernisation of New Zealand Railways, the original island station was demolished and replaced with a much smaller weatherboard station just south of the goods shed and stockyards. Shortly afterwards, the signal box and island platform were also removed, replaced with centralised traffic control and 3-aspect colour light signals.\nThe new station building featured a passenger waiting room and station master's office for tablet working. There were two dogboxes on the platform and a station master's house. The platform was a short, concrete-fronted passenger platform with electric lighting, long enough for the RM class Standard railcars then being used on New Plymouth–Wellington services. The new station building was not directly accessible to Waitara Branch trains, connecting passenger services on the branch having ceased almost 20 years earlier on 29 April 1946.\nThe station continued to serve the local district for many years, as well as goods and livestock traffic from the meat works in Waitara. In 1983, a new spur siding was laid for the transport of concrete prefabricated units for use in the construction of the new Petragas Chemicals methanol plant outside of Waitara.\n\n\n== Decline and closure ==\nOn 21 January 1983, the New Plymouth–Taumaranui carriage train (final daytime successor to the New Plymouth Night Express) was terminated, ending all passenger services through Lepperton. By this time, all remaining mixed services had also been withdrawn.\nIn 1986, with the completion of the methanol plants, remaining freight was non-existent and the station closed to goods traffic on 22 September. The station building was sold in 1992 and removed from the site in 1994. Trains stopped using the yard in 1995 after the closure of the Waitara freezing works, and the branch officially closed in 1999.\n\n\n== Today ==\nToday Lepperton Station is still used for the crossing of trains and the station remains under CTC control. The two former branch sidings are leased to the Waitara Railway Preservation Society, who now own the former branch line and use the sidings to turn the society trains.\nFreight trains continue to pass through but none stop at the station.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Vince McMahon sexual trafficking scandal is an ongoing scandal regarding professional wrestling promoter Vince McMahon, long-time owner of WWE, and allegations by a former WWE employee that McMahon sexually trafficked and assaulted her at WWE's corporate headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut, and New York City.\n\n\n== Background ==\nVince McMahon (born 1945) is a professional wrestling promoter who bought his father Vincent J. McMahon's promotion – then called the World Wrestling Federation – in 1982. Under McMahon's ownership, WWF underwent an aggressive national expansion during the 1980s professional wrestling boom which effectively made the WWF – later renamed to World Wrestling Entertainment, and later still, simply WWE – the leading professional wrestling promotion in the United States and, later, the world. In June 2022, WWE's board of directors started investigating a $3 million hush money payment, and the board found that McMahon had made $12 million in payments to four women, two of whom alleged sexual misconduct against McMahon. This was not the first time McMahon had been publicly accused of sexual misconduct: in 1992, former WWF referee Rita Chatterton alleged McMahon raped her in 1986; and in 2006, a tanning salon employee in Boca Raton, Florida, alleged that McMahon had sexually harassed and groped her.\nAs a result of the investigation, McMahon retired in July 2022 as chief executive officer of WWE, but still remained its largest shareholder. McMahon was succeeded as CEO by his daughter Stephanie McMahon and company president Nick Khan. In November 2022, WWE's internal investigation into the hush money payments was completed, but the company did not publicly disclose its results. In January 2023, McMahon exited retirement and returned as executive chairman of WWE amid rumours that the company would be sold; McMahon's public statement also referred to WWE's ongoing negotiations regarding its media rights. In September 2023, WWE officially merged with mixed martial arts promotion Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) to create TKO Group Holdings, of which McMahon was appointed executive chairman.\n\n\n== Lawsuit ==\nOn January 25, 2024, former WWE employee Janel Grant filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut against WWE, McMahon, and former WWE Head of Talent Relations John Laurinaitis alleging that McMahon had sexually assaulted and trafficked her, and sought to have a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) relating to the conduct voided, both under the auspices of the Speak Out Act, which makes such NDAs illegal and unenforceable, and as nullified by McMahon's refusal to follow the contracted obligations within the NDA. Grant, a former paralegal who lived in the same apartment block as McMahon, was offered employment with WWE in 2019 after the death of her parents. During the course of her employment, Grant alleged that McMahon recruited individuals, most notably Laurinaitis, for the purpose of sexual relations with her. Of the alleged conduct, Grant made several noteworthy allegations, including:\n\nIn June 2020, Grant, McMahon, and a personal friend of McMahon engaged in a threesome and at one point, McMahon defecated upon Grant. McMahon temporarily retired to the restroom to clean himself, at which point the threesome continued for an hour and half with Grant still covered in McMahon's feces.\nIn June 2021, Laurinitis and McMahon \"cornered her and pulled her in between them, forcibly touched her, before ultimately putting her on top of a table in between them. She begged them to stop, but they forced themselves on her, each taking turns restraining her for the other\".\nDuring the course of her employment, McMahon shared sexually explicit media with a \"world-famous athlete\" and former UFC Heavyweight Champion – identified by the Wall Street Journal as Brock Lesnar – to entice him to sign a new WWE contract, which the talent eventually did sign.\nGrant alleged that the misconduct continued until 2022, at which point McMahon's wife Linda – a former WWE executive and politician – discovered the affair and threatened to divorce him. After several months of negotiations, WWE, McMahon, and Grant signed an NDA in which Grant would be awarded $3 million for her silence; after signing the contract, Grant alleged that McMahon attempted to assault her again. Grant also alleged that key figures in WWE were fully aware of the conduct, and actively sought to conceal McMahon's wrongdoing.\n\n\n== Reactions ==\nGrant's lawsuit was filed during a prolific week for WWE: just two days prior, WWE had closed a 10-year deal with Netflix worth $10 billion in which the domestic media rights to its flagship television show WWE Raw and the international media rights to its wider content library would be provided to the streaming service; on the same day, former WWE wrestler Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson was appointed to the TKO board. Upon the filing of the lawsuit, the TKO board issued a statement that, whilst the allegation predated their control of WWE, they \"took the allegations very seriously\", while McMahon denied the allegations and vowed to \"vigorously defend himself\".\nOn January 26, 2024, snack food brand Slim Jim – a long-time sponsor of WWE, and sponsor of the Royal Rumble premium live event that was due to take part on January 27, announced that it was withdrawing its sponsorship of the event. That evening, TKO executives Ari Emanuel and Mark Shapiro met with McMahon to convince him to resign. At 8:30 pm (EST) that evening, McMahon publicly announced his resignation as TKO executive chairman. Slim Jim announced the next day that it was resuming its sponsorship of the Royal Rumble.\nOn February 1, 2024, Laurinitis' lawyer Edward Brennan told Vice News that Laurinitis was also a victim of McMahon's coercive control, and said that Laurinitis would defend himself on that basis. On February 7, Laurinitis alleged that WWE's executives were fully aware of allegations that former WWE wrestler Ashley Massaro was raped by someone posing as a US military doctor during a WWE tour of Kuwait, which contradicted earlier statements by WWE that they were unaware of them, but denied that the company had engaged in a cover up. Two days later, Vice published a previously unseen statement by Massaro which accused McMahon of predating upon other female wrestlers.\nOn March 11, 2024, Front Office Sports published an article which revealed the identities of four unnamed corporate figures referenced in the lawsuit, which Grant's attorney Ann Callis confirmed was correct:\n\nCorporate Officers #1 and #2, which were described in the lawsuit as McMahon's \"fixers\", were identified as WWE president Nick Khan and WWE COO Brad Blum;\nCorporate Officer #3, which was \"mentioned once [in the lawsuit] in an ambiguous context\", was identified as former WWE CEO, and Vince's daughter, Stephanie McMahon;\nCorporate Officer #4, who was alleged to have treated Grant with hostility within WWE's legal department, was identified as WWE's former general counsel Brian Nurse.\nOn April 1, 2024, the New York Post published a purported \"love letter\" from Grant to McMahon which was dated to December 24, 2021, which was taken from Grant's work laptop during the course of the internal investigation. Callis alleged that the love letter was written under duress, whereas McMahon's attorney Jessica Taub Rosenberg said that the letter was proof that Grant was not coerced into writing it, or that she was assaulted by McMahon.\nOn April 23, 2024, McMahon's lawyers filed a motion to compel arbitration in the case under the terms of the NDA, and stated that McMahon withheld payments as he believed that Grant had broken the terms of the agreement. A day later, Grant's attorneys filed a motion to strike McMahon's motion, alleging that he had used the motion and his preliminary statement to further intimidate Grant.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMeToo movement, a social movement against sexual assault harassment, especially in the entertainment industry.\nSpeaking Out movement, a social movement against sexual assault and harassment within the professional wrestling industry.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGrant's complaint, as provided to the The Wall Street Journal",

        "content": "\"Happy\" is a song by Swedish band Legacy of Sound featuring Swedish singer-songwriter Meja, released in 1993 by Ariola, BMG and RCA as the first single from their debut album, Holy Groove (1993). The song was written by Meja with Anders Bagge and released in 20 countries. In their native Sweden, it reached number 18 on the Swedish Singles Chart, spending five weeks within the chart. It became a surprise hit in the US, peaking at seven and 20 on the Billboard Maxi-Singles Sales and Hot Dance Club Play charts. On the Billboard Mainstream Top 40 and Hot 100 charts, the song reached numbers 29 and 68, spending 12 weeks within the Hot 100.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nLarry Flick of Billboard wrote, \"Wildly infectious hi-NRG/house music confection is delivered with lots of charisma and diva charm by lead singer Meja. Producer/writers Bag & Snowman have concocted a sing-along chorus that embeds the brain upon impact, and melts it into a white-hot arrangement of rolling piano lines, and butt-shaking beat breaks. Although story will begin at club level, this record has summer pop radio smash written all over it. It gleefully brings\nyou back to the days of platform pumps and disco togs. Have a nice trip.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n12\", Sweden (1993)\nA1. \"Happy\" (Club Mix) — 7:47\nA2. \"Happy\" (Happy Radio Mix) — 4:02\nB1. \"Happy\" (After Hour Mix) — 4:51\nB2. \"Happy\" (Nice & Stoned Dub) — 5:36\nB3. \"Happy\" (Club Edit) — 4:18\n12\", US (1993)\nA1. \"Happy\" (Full Vocal Gypsy Mix) — 6:44\nA2. \"Happy\" (Garage Mix) — 6:35\nA3. \"Happy\" (Instrumental) — 6:41\nB1. \"Happy\" (Original Mix) — 7:48\nB2. \"Happy\" (Radio Version) — 4:02\nCD single, Europe (1993)\n\"Happy\" (Radio Mix) — 4:02\n\"Happy\" (Club Edit) — 4:18\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",
