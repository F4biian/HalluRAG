In 1937 she was hired by the Colombian government and a few months later she held the post at the Normal School of Señoritas in Medellin, which would later change its name to Instituto Central Femenino. Sèculi tried to make important changes in both the sports and social vision of the school, but, due to social conservatism in Medellin and the persecution she suffered from the Colombian church for her progressive positions, the ministry forced to resign from office.\n\n\n== Death ==\nAs a posthumous tribute, in 2010 the Barcelona City Council dedicated gardens that bear his name.\n\n\n== References ==",

His first political position was as head of the Algiers Autonomous Zone after the arrest of ZAA leader Saadi Yacef after Yacef's arrest by French authorities on September 24, 1957. Following Algerian independence in 1962, Mohammedi's role as head of the ZAA was transferred to wali of Algiers Province, and he received the keys to the city from French head of Algiers Vitalis Cros. Christian Fouchet stated that Cros and Mohammedi worked together during the transfer of control of Algiers from France to Algeria.\nBetween 1961 and 1962, Mohammedi participated in Algeria's transition to independence under Commander Azzedine and kept the peace during the 1962 Algerian independence referendum. Nadir Kassab succeeded Mohammedi as wali of Algiers on July 6, 1962, just nineteen days after Mohammedi became wali.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "A pelota was an improvised hide boat used in South and Central America for crossing rivers.  It was similar in some respects to the coracle of the British Isles or the bull boat of North America, but it had little or no wooden framework or internal supporting structure, sometimes relying entirely on the stiffness of the hide to keep it afloat.  Thus, it could be carried about on horseback and set up quickly in an emergency, a commonplace rural skill.  The vessel was towed by an animal or a human swimmer, women being considered particularly dexterous.  Pelotas could convey substantial loads—around a quarter of a ton was common—and even small artillery pieces.  They continued to be used well into the 20th century.\n\n\n== Necessity ==\nThere were few bridges in these regions and rivers had to be forded or, if too deep, crossed in a pelota.  To cross a river in an emergency e.g. when swollen by torrential rains or during a military campaign, travellers on horseback had to employ such means as were to hand.  They were unlikely to be carrying wood, which in some regions e.g. the treeless pampas might be hard to procure.  Ox-hides were common, however, and some travellers were in the habit of carrying one under their saddle.\n\nWrote Auguste de Saint-Hilaire:Since I left the province of Santa Catarina, I had travelled about six hundred leagues, and I had crossed a country cut by numerous rivers; part of this country is rich and flourishing, and yet I did not see a single bridge, sometimes I did not even find any canoe on the banks of the rivers. When this happens, the inhabitants of the country take a rawhide, they knot the four corners of it, and thus form a sort of rounded boat (pelota), to which they attach a strap. Anyone who wants to cross the water sits in this type of canoe and remains motionless while a swimmer, holding the strap between his teeth, pulls it until he reaches the other bank. I have had luggage transported in this way, often very heavy though the naturalist was understandably reluctant to trust his rich collection of specimens to this means of conveyance.\n\n\n== Construction ==\nA sun-dried rawhide is inherently stiff, and tends to curve with the hairy side outwards.  The legs were cut off to form a roughly rectangular structure and tied at the four corners to sustain its curvature.\nSince animal hides were habitually dried by staking them out on the ground, they came with peg-holes along the margins.  By passing a cord through these eyelets, the curvature could be further enhanced.  The vessel has been compared to the gigantic water-lily of the Amazon. Martin Dobrizhoffer, a Jesuit missionary in Paraguay, recorded that the four sides were raised \"like the upturned brim of a hat\", a distance of about 2 spans.  Sometimes, a few sticks were inserted for internal support, but this was not usually necessary, or always possible.\nIf no cowhide was available, one might be procured by slaughtering an animal on the spot and skinning it.  Since this hide lacked stiffness, however, it was necessary to vary the construction.  The skin was stuffed with, and tied around, a bundle of straw, and only served as a rudimentary float.\n\n\n=== Stiffness ===\nIf the hide was allowed to get wet, it tended to become soft and pliable, hence useless.  Then it was necessary to dry it out, or to use bracing sticks if these could be found.\nFélix de Azara, a Spanish colonial official whose duties compelled him to travel through remote regions and who often used the pelota to cross rivers, complained in his travel diary that torrential rains not only caused flooding but gradually made the pelota useless.\nIt was said that if a pelota should take too long to cross a river, as might happen if the towing swimmer grew tired, or lost his hold, the hide would soften up and the vessel might sink.\n\n\n== Propulsion ==\nThe hide boat was towed across the river, either by a swimmer pulling a cord with his teeth, or by a bullock, or by holding onto the tail of a horse.\n\n\n=== Women ===\nAn artillery officer wrote that, at certain river pass in northern Argentina, the local women were reputed the best swimmers, their dextrous handling of the pelotas being \"justly admired\"; indeed according to the French geographer Martin de Moussy \"they had a monopoly on this singular industry\".  Likewise, Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, who grew up in a completely different part of the country, upon reading James Fenimore Cooper, remarked When the fugitives in The Prairie arrive at a river, and Cooper describes the mysterious way in which the Pawnee gathers together the buffalo's hide, \"he is making a pelota,\" said I to myself, — \"it is a pity there is no woman to tow it,\" — for among us [Argentines] it is the women who tow pelotas across rivers with lassos held between their teeth. \n\n\n== Classification ==\nThe pelota resembled the coracle of the British Isles or the bull boat of North America, but it lacked the internal supporting framework of those vessels, except insofar as a few sticks might be added as bracing.  Unlike the pelota, the hide of the bull boat was soft and pliable, and applied to the supporting wicker framework with hair side facing inwards.\n\n\n== Utility ==\n\nThe boat served for transporting clothing and gear that one wanted to keep dry, or which must not get wet e.g. ammunition.  It also served to convey those who could not swim, or would not.  In the colonial era, Spanish military commanders, though they knew how to swim, held it was beneath their dignity to strip in front of the common soldiery, and were conveyed by pelota; \"scorning the assistance of another person, they impel forwards by two forked boughs for oars\".\nA pelota could carry two men.  Azara wrote that it could easily carry a load of 16 to 25 arrobas (180 to 280) kilos.  Azara felt it was safer than a native canoe, and so did Father Dobrizhoffer.   Military stores and even (small) artillery pieces could be conveyed across rivers.\nGeneral Manuel Belgrano recalled taking a small revolutionary army across the Corriente River in 1811 with nothing but two bad canoes and some pelotas.  The river was about a cuadra (80 metres) wide, and unfordable.  He noted that most of his men knew how to use a pelota, implying that it was standard rural knowhow. \nThe French traveller de Moussy, who rode very extensively over Argentina, wrote:\n\nThis way of crossing rivers was naturally perilous, and more than one accident, sometimes fatal, was the result; but every Argentine countryman knew how to do it and did not hesitate to put it into practice. \nThe postal service in colonial and newly independent Argentina appointed officials whose job its was to carry the mail over rivers that could not be forded, towing pelotas for the purpose.  Apparently, some of these rivers were a mile or more across.\n\n\n== Diffusion and origins ==\nIts origin is uncertain, but it may have pre-dated the Columbian exchange.  Some have denied this, arguing that the indigenous peoples lacked domestic animals that could provide a large, strong hide.  Another view is that they sewed several small camelid hides together: after the Spanish introduced cattle and horses, this became unnecessary.\n\nEven in the 20th century the pelota could be found on the llanos of Colombia and Venezuela, in Matto Grosso, and Rio Grande do Sul, in Uruguay, on the rivers of the pampas of the Argentine and Paraguay, and by the Mojos or Moxos of northern Bolivia.  Southern Bolivia has also to be added .. Southward it ranges (or ranged) almost to the farthest limits of Patagonia.   \nIn the 1890s it could be found in most parts of Brazil,  and in Central America.\n\n\n== Nomenclature ==\nThere is no specific word for this vessel.  The Spanish word pelota is general, meaning a round object.  It is sometimes specified more precisely as pelota de cuero (hide ball), but this can still mean a football.  The Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy has the verb pelotear, to cross a river on a pelota, but it can also mean to bounce from place to place, a victim of buck-passing bureaucracy.\nIn Brazil it was also called pelota, but in Bahia it was called banguê in the indigenous language.\nIn parts of South America the boat was called a balsa but this is an only general word that can include raft or inflatable lifejacket.  Amongst the Chiquitos people of Bolivia it was called natae; amongst the Abipones of the Chaco, ñataċ.\n\n\n== Eponym ==\nThe city of Pelotas, Brazil (pop. c. 350,000) is thought to have derived its name from the water craft, used in the 18th century for crossing a local stream.\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nArenales, José (1833).

        "content": "The Memphis and Hernando plank road was a toll road between Memphis, Tennessee and Hernando, Mississippi in the United States. The plank road was built and opened in approximately 1852. The road was originally known as the Panola and DeSoto Plank Road. The distance covered was 22 miles (35 km). There was a toll gate every eight miles. The road passed by large plantations, colonial-style homes, and small farms. At the same time a similar toll road, known as the Memphis and Pigeon Roost Plank Road, was built between Memphis and Holly Springs, Mississippi.\n\n\n== History ==\nThere were several plank roads built out of Memphis in the 1850s; in addition to the roads to Mississippi there were roads to Big Creek and Raleigh in Shelby County, and LaGrange in Fayette County, Tennessee.\nIn August 1851, Thomas Peters and slave trader Byrd Hill advertised that they sought to hire out between 50 and 100 enslaved male laborers to build the road. According to a 1921 reminiscence by a longtime citizen of White Haven, Tennessee, the road was \"constructed by grading the roadbed and laying two and one-half-inch oak planks on stringers of timber laid flush with the roadbed. It made an excellent highway and made hauling and travel easy.\" Col. Charles Edward Ware may have been surveyor and contractor for both the Hernando and Pigeon Roost roads. Polly Turner Cancer of Marshall County, Mississippi told a WPA Slave Narratives recorder that the plank roads to Memphis had been considered dangerous places, known to be frequented by bandits: \"In dose days hit was dang'us to travel 'cause dere was so many robbers 'festin' de roads; when de folks was fixin' to go to Memphis dey wud all go in gangs; dey wud meet at de Ferry at Wyatt an' go togedder; dey wud all have fierce dogs an' guns; Marster wud tell 'bout ridin' on de Plank Roads to Memphis.\" The opening of the Tennessee and Mississippi Railroad train station in Hernando in 1856 significantly cut into the plank road's revenues. \nDuring the American Civil War, the death of a civilian named William H. White who lived along the Memphis and Hernando plank road led to an exchange of tersely worded letters between U.S. Army general William T. Sherman and the Confederate Army commander in Mississippi J. C. Pemberton. According to a WPA-produced history of DeSoto County, Mississippi, Nathan Bedford Forrest and his men rode the plank road into Memphis at the time of their infamous 1864 raid.: 133 \n\nThe present-day Interstate 55 follows the same route as the old Memphis to Hernando plank road.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPlank Road Boom\nTransportation in Memphis, Tennessee\n\n\n== References ==",

It was released by Fania Records in 1970.\n\n\n== Background and release ==\nColón hired Puerto Rican musician Yomo Toro to play cuatro on the album, which gave a boost to his career. John Bush of AllMusic noted that Toro's presence on the album gave it a jíbaro feel, which \"any Puerto Rican native or person with heritage would recognize and appreciate during the Christmas season\".\nColón and Lavoe released a second Christmas album in 1973, entitled Asalto Navideño Vol. II. The album again featured Toro playing the cuatro, and he also appeared on the cover dressed as Santa Claus. Both albums were later re-released together.\nThe track \"La Murga\" was a particular hit, and was later covered by Víctor Piñero with Los Melódicos.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nWillie Colón – leader, trombone, chorus vocals\nHéctor Lavoe – lead vocals\nWilliam \"Sweet\" Campbell – trombone\nMilton Cardona – congas, percussion\nJosé Mangual Jr. – bongos, percussion\nJohnny Pacheco – percussion, chorus vocals\nProf. Joe Torres – piano\nLouie \"Timbalito\" Romero – timbales\nSanti \"Choflomo\" González – bass\nYomo Toro – cuatro\nRoberto García – cuatro\nMiguel \"El Túnel\" Matos – \"band boy\", minor percussion\nJusto Betancourt – chorus vocals\nTechnical\n\nJerry Masucci – production\nJohnny Pacheco – recording\nIrv Greenbaum – engineering\nArtistic\n\nElliot Sachs – cover location\nIzzy Sanabria – design\nLen Bauman – photography\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Nutwith Cote is a historic building in Burton-on-Yore, a village in North Yorkshire, in England.\nThere was already a farm on the site in the 12th century, when Fountains Abbey acquired it from Richard de Hedune.  It served as a monastic grange until the Dissolution of the Monasteries, when it was given to Richard Gresham.  In 1582, his descendant, William Gresham, sold the farm to Christopher Beckwith, and it remained in the Beckwith family for many generations.\n\nThe oldest parts of the present house are the rear wings, dating from the early 17th century.  The main front was added in the late 18th century.  A grand stable was constructed in the early 18th century, and the farm became a noted centre for racehorse breeding, with the horse Bartlett's Childers being stabled there.  Of similar date is a coach house, which incorporates 16th-century beehives.  Further south are a mid-18th century barn and dovecote.  The house, stables, coach house and barn are all grade II* listed, while the dovecote is grade II listed.\n\nThe farmhouse is built of stone, with a moulded cornice, a coped parapet, and a stone slate roof with stone coping and shaped kneelers.  The main range dates from the 18th century, and has two storeys and a cellar, and four bays.  The central doorway has an architrave, a pulvinated frieze and a pediment, and above it is a sundial.  The windows on the front are sashes with plain surrounds and moulded sills.  To the right and lower is the 17th-century wing, which contains two windows, one with a chamfered surround and above one with a moulded architrave.\n\nThe stables are also built of stone, and have chamfered quoins and a corrugated asbestos roof.  There are two storeys and seven bays.  On the front are three doorways with chamfered quoined surrounds and tripartite keystones.  The windows are casements with projecting plain stone surrounds and tripartite keystones.\nThe coach house, is similarly built of stone, with quoins, an eaves band, and a stone roof with stone coping.  It is a small building, with a single storey and a single bay.  It contains an arched entrance with rusticated voussoirs and a keystone.  Above, in the gable, is an arched opening with a keystone.  To the right is a range of six 16th-century arched bee hives with moulded surrounds and semicircular apses.\n\nThe stone barn has a stone slate roof with moulded kneelers and stone coping.  There is a single storey and three bays.  In the centre is an arched wagon entrance with moulded imposts, voussoirs and a keystone.  This is flanked by two giant Doric pilasters on plinths, carrying an entablature with a band, a frieze and a moulded cornice.  In each outer bay is a doorway with a square opening above.\nThe stone dovecote is now a ruin.  It has quoins and a coved cornice.  It contains a doorway with a lintel, and above it is a partially ruined oval window.\n\n\n== See also ==\nListed buildings in Burton-on-Yore\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Russian submarine Nerpa (Russian: Нерпа, lit. 'Baikal seal') was the second boat of the Morzh class of submarines of the Imperial Russian Navy. It was laid down and launched on the same day in August 1913, and completed its sea trials in December 1914. Built for the Black Sea Fleet, the submarine saw action during World War I, and spent much of the war raiding Ottoman merchant shipping that transported coal from Zonguldak to Constantinople. Nerpa was credited with sinking 24 ships during the conflict for a total of 2,443 gross register tons (GRT), making it the fourth most successful Russian submarine in the Black Sea.\nNerpa was undergoing major repairs at the shipyard in Nikolayev when the October Revolution occurred. During the Russian Civil War the city was occupied over time by several forces, including Germany, the Western Allies, and the White Army, before being taken by the Bolsheviks and becoming part of the Soviet Union. Nerpa was the only prewar Russian submarine in the Black Sea captured by the Bolsheviks, and it was commissioned into the Soviet Navy in June 1922, before being renamed Politruk (Russian: Политрук, lit. 'political leader') in January 1923. The boat became part of the Detached Submarine Division of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet, along with four AG-class submarines. Politruk remained on active service until November 1929, when it was removed from the fleet, and it was scrapped in 1931.\n\n\n== Design and construction ==\nAfter being defeated in the Russo-Japanese War, the Russian Empire began rebuilding its Navy. Initially the main focus of the naval arms programs was on the Baltic and Pacific fleets, but as tensions increased with Austria-Hungary due to the Bosnian crisis in 1908 and with Ottoman Turkey after the expansion of its navy, the Black Sea Fleet was given more attention. The 1911 naval program approved by the State Duma included the order of six submarines for the Black Sea Fleet, which ended up being three Morzh-class boats and three Narval class. The naval engineer Ivan Bubnov was the designer of the Morzh class and developed it from his earlier submarine Akula, which was considered to be the most advanced of the Russian submarines at the time. In the years before the 1911 program, there was debate in the Imperial Russian Navy on whether to purchase and build the submarines designed by Ivan Bubnov, the chief submarine engineer of the Baltic Yard, or a foreign inspired design, based on the popular Holland type, which became known as the Narval class. Bubnov was supported by the Naval General Staff, while the foreign type was favored by members of the Naval Technological Committee. In the end, a conference led by Navy Minister Stepan Voevodskiy settled the matter by ordering three submarines of each class.\nThe Morzh-class submarines were well-armed for the time, having one deck gun, four internal torpedo tubes and eight Dzhevetskiy torpedo-launching collars. However, the vessel had numerous shortcomings. It suffered from having only a single hull, lacking bulkheads, having a slow diving time of 3+1⁄2 minutes due to poor ballast tank venting, and a diving depth of only 25 fathoms (150 ft; 46 m). An additional problem was that twin 1,140 horsepower (850 kW) diesel engines to power all three Morzh-class boats had been ordered from Germany, but were not delivered by the time World War I broke out. They had to be replaced by severely underpowered engines from the Amur River gunboats, each of which delivered only 250 horsepower (190 kW). This meant that the designed 16-knot (30 km/h; 18 mph) surface speed could not be attained. The designed 12-knot (22 km/h; 14 mph) underwater speed also could not be attained due to a poorly designed hull shape, which was more like that of a surface vessel than a submarine. The construction of all three submarines began on 25 June 1911 and took place at the Nikolayev department of the Baltic Yard, which was created specifically to build the Morzh class. Some of the components were made in Saint Petersburg before being sent to Nikolayev to be assembled.\nNerpa was laid down and launched in August 1913, and received its engines in November 1914, with the sea trials taking place until the end of the following month. This made Nerpa the first of the Morzh-class boats to enter service, and at the time were they considered to be the best submarines in the Black Sea Fleet.\n\n\n== World War I service ==\n\nAt the same time when Nerpa was undergoing sea trials and began active service, the Russian Black Sea Fleet was following a defensive strategy, but this changed in early 1915 when the Stavka ordered it to attack the Bosporus to support the Gallipoli campaign of the British and the French. Nerpa carried out its first patrol near the Bosporus from 5 to 8 March 1915, becoming the first Russian submarine to do so. The patrol was uneventful. But by April, the Russian focus changed to stopping coal shipments along the Turkish coast from the area of Zonguldak to Constantinople, and the submarines, working with destroyers, implemented a partial blockade of the Bosporus. It eventually had the effect of forcing the German ships in the Black Sea to limit their operations to save fuel. Initially it was Nerpa and its sister ship Tyulen working on this task, and they were later joined by the final boat of their class, Morzh. At first the two submarines took turns going on patrol, but they later began patrolling at the same time, with each taking a position on either side of the entrance to the strait.\nOn 5 September 1915 the submarine Nerpa, commanded by V. V. Vilken, worked together with the destroyers Bystry and Pronzitelny to attack an Ottoman merchant ship convoy on its way to Constantinople from Zonguldak. It was escorted by the cruiser Hamidiye and the destroyers Nümune-i Hamiyet and Muavenet-i Milliye. After spotting the submarine and the destroyers, the escorts abandoned the convoy and sped toward the Bosporus, while also sending a message to the battlecruiser Goeben for assistance. The coal transport ships beached themselves on the shore and were attacked by the destroyers. Goeben arrived some time later and opened fire at Nerpa after spotting the submarine on the surface. Nerpa crash dived and was able to escape.\n\nNerpa was attacked by the German submarine UB-7 on 21 August 1916 while traveling on the surface near the Bosporus. Of the two torpedoes fired by UB-7 one missed completely, while the second glanced off the stern but did not detonate because its detonation mechanism did not work properly. By late 1916, there were seven Russian submarines carrying out patrols in the Black Sea in total, which included Nerpa and the other two Morzh-class boats, the three boats of the Narval class, and the submarine minelayer Krab.\nAfter the February Revolution in 1917, the Russian Provisional Government continued operations in the Black Sea, including the attacks on Ottoman coal shipping. On 24 April 1917 Nerpa was close to the entrance of the Bosporus when two transport ships left on their way to Zonguldak. They stayed close to the coast where they were protected by coastal artillery, but the submarine fired at it with its own deck guns, and then destroyed both of the transports. Nerpa was on patrol in that area again as of 26 June 1917, when the cruiser Breslau was returning to port after laying mines near the entrance of the Danube and was being pursued by several Russian warships. But the submarine was not close enough to make an attack and Breslau made it back. \nSometime after June 1917, the submarine underwent major repairs at the shipyard in Nikolayev, and that is where it was when the October Revolution occurred. During the war Nerpa was credited with destroying 24 ships for a total tonnage of 2,443 GRT, making it the fourth most successful submarine of the Black Sea Fleet and one of the more successful ones in the Imperial Russian Navy overall.\n\n\n== In the Soviet Navy ==\n\nIn the years after the October Revolution, the port of Nikolayev was controlled by several different factions. The German Army advanced into the territory of the Ukrainian People's Republic, which it recognized on 9 February 1918, and occupied Nikolayev by 17 March 1918. After the surrender of Germany, the Western Allies were present in the area, along with elements of the Russian White Army, but they withdrew and the Bolsheviks took over the area by the end of 1920. Nerpa was the only prewar submarine in the Black Sea that was in Bolshevik control by the end of the Russian Civil War. It was commissioned into the Soviet Navy on 3 June 1922 and was renamed Politruk in January 1923. The Bolsheviks established the Naval Forces of the Black and Azov Seas (renamed the Naval Forces of the Black Sea in 1922), which included a Detached Submarine Division that was formed on 21 October 1920 in Nikolayev before being moved to Sevastopol. This division included Politruk along with four American Holland-type submarines that arrived in Russia in separate pieces and still had not been assembled by the time of the Revolution (AG-23, AG-24, AG-25, and AG-26).\nPolitruk  stayed in active service for several years and underwent another repair between 1925 and 1926. On 3 November 1929 the submarine was removed from the fleet, and it was scrapped in 1931.\n\n\n=== Gallery ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Works ===",

        "content": "Margaret Berry (24 August 1832 – 3 November 1918) was an Irish Australian headteacher and educationist. She was the head teacher at Brisbane Girls' Normal School for 43 years.\n\n\n== Life ==\nBerry was born in Ireland at Kildare's county town of Naas. Her mother was Margaret (born Allen) and her father Terence Berry was a clerk. Marlborough Street Training College in Dublin had begun training women to be teachers in 1844 and in 1851 Berry was there for six months to become a teacher. She taught in Ireland and she then migrated to Australia. Her younger sister, Ellen, also migrated at some time.\n\n\n== Australia ==\nIn 1857 she was teaching at a Catholic school in Bathurst and in the following year she was in Sydney at the National School. The new state of Queensland was establishing its own schools. She was in Sydney until 1860 when she moved to Queensland. Brisbane Normal School opened in 1860 when it was co-educational. A separate building for boys was complete in 1862 and she was the head of the Girls' School. She was to lead the school for 43 years until she was succeeded by Elizabeth Large in 1905. In 1874 there was royal commission into education and Berry went to give evidence. Some had refused, but she spoke out boldly against the Queensland school inspector Randal MacDonnell. MacDonnell had been instrumental in getting her the job of head but she complained about his interference in her school. MacDonnell had appointed an assistant teacher and he interfered with the school's music curriculum. Berry spoke out. She also complained about salary levels. In the following year new legislation made education up to the age of twelve compulsory and it was to funded by the government if the school was not associated with a church.\nBerry died in the Brisbane suburb of New Farm. There is a plaque in the school she led for so long that celebrates her and her successor's contribution.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBiography at ADB",

        "content": "Travel is a 2024 studio album by Australian jazz trio The Necks. It has received positive reviews by critics.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nAccording to the review aggregator Metacritic, Travel received \"universal acclaim\" based on a weighted average score of 91 out of 100 from 5 critic scores. Editors at AllMusic rated this album 4.5 out of 5 stars, with critic Thom Jurek writing that the music is \"impeccably recorded and mixed by longtime collaborator Tim Whitten\" and the album \"blossoms with new ideas, fluid spontaneity, and fresh ideas\", with a recommendation to new listeners to start here in the band's discography. The site also included this on their list of the best jazz albums of 2023. Online retailer Bandcamp included this among the best jazz albums of the year, with critic Dave Sumner writing that it \"captures a facet of [the band's] growth by recording extended sections of studio improvisations that mark the start of each day, a glimpse into the process that has led to so many of past albums\". In The Big Takeover, Michael Toland summed up his review, \"every song on Travel is intriguing and compelling, as this band’s music always is, and it’s heartening to see that putting the tunes in bite-sized nuggets (even if the bites are Tyrannosaurus-sized) doesn’t make it any less so\". Kevin Whitlock of Jazzwise gave this album 5 out of 5 stars, calling this the band's best since Unfold in 2017 and \"each track constitues a musical journey\" with an uncertain endpoint. A short review in The New Yorker by Michaelangelo Matos praised the musicianship of the bandmembers and stated that this work \"showcases their singular style as effectively as any of their past work, with four songs of around twenty minutes apiece\". Richard Williams of Uncut rated Travel 4.5 out of 5 stars, noting elements of blues music and part of the band's multi-decade evolution.

        "content": "The Castle Chapel of St. Thomas Becket (also known as, the Pearl of Silesian Gothic, or the Silesian Sainte-Chapelle) was built at the end of the 13th century and is located in the eastern wing of the castle in Racibórz. Originally constructed in the Gothic style, the building incorporates elements of Baroque and Neo-Gothic architecture.\nFrom 1288 to 1416, a collegiate church was located next to the chapel, founded by the Bishop of Wrocław, Tomasz II. The temple was repeatedly ravaged by fires, including those in 1519, 1637, and 1858. In 1988, during renovation works, the so-called Schneider's map was discovered, showing a handwritten depiction of a legendary tunnel leading under the Oder river. The chapel likely housed relics of Thomas Becket or St. Stanislaus of Szczepanów.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe chapel was built in the 1280s (between 1288 and 1293) as a result of the construction of a new stone castle. It was likely erected on the site of a Romanesque rotunda, as indicated by archaeological excavations conducted in the 1960s and 1980s. The previous church was probably dedicated to St. John the Baptist, whose patronage was transferred in 1307 to the church in Ostróg, built around the 12th century by Mieszko IV Tanglefoot. The foundation of the new chapel could not have occurred later than 1292 when construction began, funded by Przemysław of Racibórz. The dedication was most likely performed by Tomasz II, who sought refuge in Racibórz from Duke Henry Probus at that time, although the exact date of the dedication is unknown. In 1288, Bishop Tomasz II founded a collegiate church near the castle chapel as an expression of gratitude for the hospitality received. This event was described by Jan Długosz in the Annals or Chronicles of the Famous Kingdom of Poland:Gathering a large army, both from his own soldiers and mercenaries hired with monetary contribution which he levied on the Wrocław Church, he militarily invaded the lands of Duke Casimir of Opole and besieged the city of Racibórz due to the presence of Bishop Tomasz of Wrocław and his clergy there. Although the wealthier citizens of Racibórz endured the siege for some time and promised to endure it even longer, the startled populace, feeling the scarcity and lack of food, tormented by hunger, continually wept, groaned loudly, and sighed, hurling curses and insults at Bishop Tomasz and his clergy. Touched by this, Bishop Tomasz, out of great kindness for which he was reputed, said: 'Rather let me and my clergy fall into the hands of the tyrant than these innocent people perish from hunger. We will immediately release from danger those besieged who are dying of fear and hunger. Let us, by our capture or, if it pleases God, by our death, avert the destruction threatening this city, which has sustained us for a long time and granted us refuge'. Then he puts on liturgical garments and orders some clergy to do the same. And thus, wearing the mitre and the episcopal insignia, he sets out from the city with all his clergy in exile, to face the tyrant's camp, to appease his wrath with the greatest humility. (...) The tyrant, who saw his arrival from afar, by God's grace, was seized with such great fear that, leaping from his tent, he ran as fast as he could to meet the bishop, fell face down on the ground, and as if recognizing something divine in the bishop and honoring in him the Eternal Shepherd, begged for forgiveness for his actions. Bishop Tomasz, raising him from the ground, tearfully promised to forgive him all the apostasy he had committed, as long as he persevered in this contrition and piety. And after mutual tearful embraces and kisses, the prince and the bishop entered the nearest church of St. Nicholas without witnesses.As a commemoration of this reconciliation between Bishop Tomasz II of Wrocław and Duke Henry Probus, a monument called Unity was erected in Stara Wieś. It was also then that the chapel received the rare dedication of St. Thomas Becket, whose relics were probably brought to the castle. At the collegiate church, three canons and several vicars served, their livelihood supported by tithes from several villages in the duchies of Racibórz, Opole, and Cieszyn. In addition, the clergy at the collegiate church served as chancellors, secretaries, as well as tutors and educators to the duke's children. In the early 14th century, a wing of the duke's castle was added to the chapel. In 1309, the altar of St. Margaret was mentioned. In the 14th century, the chapel was further expanded with a porch.\nIn 1416, at the behest of John II, the chapter was transferred from the castle chapel to the parish church. In the 15th and 16th centuries, many of the revenues of the chapel disappeared, as Augustin Weltzel mentions:As for the chapel's revenues, many of them completely disappeared in the 15th and 16th centuries. However, if the parsons, like the custodians and scholastics, faithfully remained here and did not stray from their flock, their income would be better represented. Before leaving abroad, Count Karol Sobeck established in his will of 1739 a fund of 1,000 guilders for the castle vicar, who would receive accommodation and sustenance in the castle, serve in the chapel, and annually celebrate a requiem for all deceased subjects of the duchy, and established the feast day of St. John of Nepomuk (May 16) as a holiday for the entire duchy.In 1519, due to a fire that broke out in the castle, the chapel suffered the most damage, with the southern wall and vaults collapsing. After the fire in 1519, the collapsed southern wall was rebuilt, and the vaults were reconstructed, with the upper level lowered. Additionally, a sacristy was added on the southern side. Even after the castle passed into the hands of the Austrians, masses continued to be held in the chapel. This fact is mentioned by Augustin Weltzel:After the extinction of the Piast dynasty of the Opole and Racibórz duchies in 1532, they passed to the Austrian house as kings of Bohemia. Although later, due to the sale, the castle was separated from the duchy, the emperor retained the patronage rights, and the hereditary owners received only demesne estates, but not the privileges of founders. Both masses were to be celebrated in the presence of the duke, but now they are performed with greater benefit and with a larger congregation in the town church, one at 7:00 AM (matins), the other at 9:00 AM (high mass).Every year, four solemn processions with the martyr's relics proceeded to the chapel. The first took place on December 29, the feast day of the patron saint, St. Thomas. The second procession went to the chapel on Tuesdays during Rogation days or Maundy Thursday, while the third took place on the eve of the feast of St. John the Baptist. The last procession fell on the feast day of St. Marcellus I, the patron of Racibórz, and was established in commemoration of the foundation of the collegiate church. However, as they coincided with market days, it was conducted around the market square to the Dominican monastery. When the castle was owned by individuals of different denominations than Catholicism, such as George von Brandenburg, Jan Zygmunt Bathori, and Bethlen Gabor, masses could not be held in the chapel. From 1542 to 1629, processions, except for the Corpus Christi procession, did not take place, which was conducted in the presence of armed citizens and the chapter. An urbarium from 1595 describes the chapel as follows:At the entrance, there is a gate building and a wooden chamber, next to it, an old entrance to the castle. Right nearby stands the church with a sacristy, which, however, threatens to collapse; underneath it, there are chambers and an attic. Under the church is a vaulted room and a prison.By the end of the 16th century, the technical condition of the building had significantly deteriorated: the roof had not been repaired, the chapel had subsided, and the object, along with the sacristy, had numerous cracks, and the altars had collapsed. This was mainly due to the large space, which lacked a vault, located below the church, and the beams separating the rooms were rotten. In 1594, the castle was inspected by an imperial commission, which proposed the demolition of the chapel.\nIn the 17th century, during the reconstruction of the castle, the facade of the chapel acquired a Baroque appearance. In 1609, the castle was acquired by Baron von Mettich, who undertook to rebuild the church. It was probably then that a side extension was built in place of the porch. Additionally, he promised not to limit the former endowments for the local priests, and the chasubles, chalices, and monstrances were to be returned to the Church. In 1637, another fire broke out at the castle, which also affected the chapel. The reconstruction probably lasted from 1642 to 1651, resulting in a barrel-vaulted ceiling with lunettes above the crypt. In addition, the western bay was shortened, and the facade was rebuilt in the Baroque style. An urbarium from 1642 mentions a clock on the chapel tower. In 1642, the castle and the church were taken over by George von Oppersdorff. In 1670, through the efforts of George von Oppersdorff, the building was renovated, which, according to the land register, had been desecrated during the Thirty Years' War:[The chapel] completely deteriorated during the wars and became impure, but, thanks to the holy memory of Count George von Oppersdorff, it was restored in honor of Almighty God and St. Thomas Becket.During the reconstruction of the chapel, new windows, benches, oratories, matronea, and an altar were created. In 1687, a baptism ceremony took place in the church for a Turk and a Turkess. The Turk named Mahomet took on a new name, Theophilus, and his godparents were Bernard von Oppersdorff, Wenceslaus von Reiswitz, and his wife. The Turkess assumed the names Barbara Antonina Eufrazja, and her godparents were the von Reiswitz couple and George von Oppersdorff.\nAt the turn of the 17th and 18th centuries, several aristocratic weddings were held in the chapel. On 29 March 1688, Baron of Karol Gabriel von Węgierski and Countess Benigna Ester Praschma were united in holy matrimony by Scholaster Frederick Ferdinand Flade. Witnesses at this ceremony included Count Jan Jerzy von Oppersdorff, Countess Marianna von Hohenems, Count Bernard von Praschma, Frederick von Oppersdorff, and his son Frederick. On 12 February 1713, Baron Teofil von Tracha and Countess Helena Sobeck, daughter of Count Karol Henryk Sobeck, were married, and the ceremony was officiated by Abbot Józef Bernard von Strachwitz.\n\nIn the 18th century, the chapel ceased to hold religious services despite such an obligation in the founding document. This fact was met with a sharp reaction from the imperial authorities. The whole situation was described by Augustin Weltzel:At the end of 1731, an imperial decree was issued to all churches in Silesia, according to which all privileges granted by the founders had to be submitted for approval by the imperial court within six months, under the penalty of invalidation if not submitted within the specified time. The county governor (Landeshauptmann) reported to the superior office (Oberamt), and on 26 June 1732, the emperor was informed by Count Franz Anton Schaffgotsch and Lazarus von Brunetti about the cessation of daily masses and annual processions, which were endowed in the castle chapel to honor St. Thomas Becket, depriving the local pastor of various incomes, which were taken over by the chapter. Charles VI, or rather the highest chancellor of Czechia, Francis Ferdinand Count Kinsky, on 25 August 1733, summoned the royal superior office in the Upper and Lower Silesia duchies to demand from the members of the chapter a proper justification for why they had discontinued the daily services in the castle chapel against the literal content of the founding document and to present a relevant report as soon as possible. The superior office (Count Franz Anton Schaffgotsch and Lazarus von Brunetti) addressed the general vicariate, and it (Baron Jan von Redinghoven and Baron Adam Joseph von Keller) on September 12, turned to the chapter in Racibórz to submit the documents within two weeks.On 24 November 1733, the Racibórz chapter responded to the letter sent by the imperial authorities. According to the chapter, the two endowed masses had not been celebrated in the chapel for over 200 years, but their intentions were carried out in the parish church.\nIn 1852, a description of the castle chapel was published in the architectural monthly Zeitschrift für Bauwesen:The chapel is part of the old Piast Castle, which, built in an irregular shape, has only partially survived, as the wing towards the Oder river collapsed. Due to its strong walls, the castle served more as a fortress than as a decoration. The chapel, with its noble and pure Gothic style, undoubtedly fascinates every art lover. From the outside, squeezed between two buildings, the church does not make the best impression, with a Baroque gable closed on both sides by the roof. However, the interior is all the more beautiful, measuring 37.5 feet in length, 20 feet in width, and 44 feet in height. The boldest cross vault rises on slender columns and bundles of shafts. Ten windows and window niches, two large windows in the rear wall, and two smaller ones above the door divide the walls with graceful lines and give the chapel a free, airy look. To the left of the entrance, in the wall between four columns (three connected each), there are nine niches next to each other, which, at a height of 11 feet above the floor, were used for placing sculptures. Both the profiles of the niches and columns, vaults, and arches are of the finest shape. The right side seems to have suffered from the fire. The main altar and two side altars with modest gilding are not particularly ornate. During the castle fire in January 1858, part of the vault collapsed, but it was rebuilt by the builder Starck, and the chapel was adorned with a spire. The main decoration, beautiful stone window works, were made a few years later, however, the wooden altar and organ were erected in 1873. The restored castle chapel was consecrated on 18 October 1876.In 1858, another fire broke out, sparing no part of the chapel. The western span of the building collapsed as a result of the fire. After the fire, a brewery was built, followed by the reconstruction of the chapel (lasting until 1873), overseen by Juliusz Starcke. During the reconstruction works, the interior of the building was modernized, and the western facade of the exterior was redesigned in the Neo-Gothic style. Triangular gables were added to the eastern and western elevations. Additionally, the gable of the western facade transitioned into a spire, crowned with a pyramid. Inside the church, space was made for a musical choir loft, supported by two columns. In 1873, a Neo-Gothic wooden altar of St. Thomas Becket, likely crafted by Adalbert Siekinder from Munich, along with a painting of the patron by Jan Bochenek and organs, were installed in the chapel. A few years later, the interior was enriched with stonework. The three-part windows were adorned with tracery. The consecration of the chapel took place on October 18 of the same year.\nDuring World War II, the chapel did not suffer significant damage. On 5 December 1953, the church, along with the entire castle complex, was listed as a historic monument. However, due to the lack of interest from the authorities, the building gradually deteriorated from the early 1950s onwards. It was during this time that the altar, organs, and benches in the chapel were destroyed. From 1985 to 1987, archaeological and architectural work was conducted in the church by B. Muzolf and Z. Hejda. In 1988, an agreement was reached between the city and church authorities that the renovated chapel would be used for religious worship. In the 1990s, through the efforts of the city authorities, the facade was renovated, and conservation work was carried out on the stonework of the windows in the church. The chapel is currently owned by the State Treasury, and the facility is under the administration of the Racibórz County authorities. On 3 June 2001, at 12:00 PM, after a long hiatus, a Mass was celebrated in front of the church, presided over by Father Jerzy Hetmańczyk, the parson of St. John the Baptist Parish. However, the chapel is not currently in use.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe temple, along with the castle house, was added to the first section of the walls from the east. It is located in the eastern wing of the castle, between the gate building and the main castle buildings. The chapel stands on the foundations of the previous temple. Initially freestanding, it is erected on a rectangular plan measuring 8.5 by 13 meters, oriented, built of brick in the Wendish work, plastered, and has stone details from hewing. The chapel was the first freestanding religious building built on a rectangular plan.\nThe chapel is of the aisleless type, three-bay, cross-ribbed vaulted. The western bay (Neo-Gothic) is slightly narrower than the others, the vault of the central bay is six-part, and the eastern bay is seven-part and has a transverse rib on the axis of the eastern wall. In the keystone there is a Neo-Gothic heraldic cartouche. The ribs of the eastern and central bays date from the turn of the 15th and 16th centuries, with a profile in the form of a roll with a break. The ribs flow into columnettes with chalice capitals from the late 13th century in the corners and the north wall. The capitals are decorated with floral and flower motifs. Triple shaft bundles are located between the bays. The southern wall has shafts from the turn of the 15th and 16th centuries. The shafts are profiled and have corniced capitals. The shafts on the north side are cantilevered on brackets decorated with plant motifs, probably partially reconstructed in the 19th century. The shafts on the southern side reach the cornice, which runs around the interior at the height of the window sills.\nThe chapel windows are divided and have tracery. The side walls of the eastern and central bays have two two-part pointed-arch windows, while the eastern wall has two three-part windows with tracery. There is also tracery with a fish bladder motif on the eastern wall, which was probably reconstructed. The windows on the north side have tracery with a trefoil motif, also partially reconstructed. There are sedilia niches under the windows. Between the shafts in the eastern part of the north wall there are 3 niches, which are closed with trefoil and surrounded by richly profiled frames, the closures of which are slightly cantilevered. Triangular wimpergs with stylized crockets and crosses are present in the crowning. At the base of the sedilia there is a cornice. In the middle bay on the north side there is a passage to the castle. In the western part there is a matroneum half the width of the bay. The chapel is surrounded by buttresses with a stone cornice.\nThe chapel has a two-story layout, connected by stairs in the wall from the east. The upper level served liturgical purposes. There is a Neo-Gothic, brick choir supported by two columns. The lower level served as either the tomb oratory of Przemysław and his family or as a place for storing holy relics, functioning as a sanctuary. The first purpose seems unlikely, as after the death of Przemysław, he was buried in the Dominican monastery in Racibórz. The crypt under the chapel has a ribbed vault from the second half of the 17th century supported on two pillars and on chalice-shaped corbels located in the perimeter walls. In the western part there is a church porch.\nIn the crypt there was a tombstone of Joanna Wilhelmina Ihlee née Gröschner (died 1790). The slab was marble, had an inscription, and the ornamental top depicted the sun. In addition, the chapel housed six pewter lanterns from the first half of the 19th century. In the museum in Racibórz there is a painting of St. Thomas Becket from the altar and statues of the apostles that adorned the dismantled canon sedilia.\nOn the outside of the building, in the eastern corners and also at the western bay, there are trusks. The western facade of the building is Neo-Gothic, with a portal and a gable that turns into a tower topped with a spire. The chapel is covered with a saddle roof with sheet metal.\nSince the mid-19th century, the castle chapel has been called the Pearl of Silesian Gothic due to its high artistic level. It is also called the Silesian Sainte-Chapelle.\n\n\n== Chapter ==\n\nBishop of Wrocław, Tomasz II, founded a collegiate church at the castle chapel in 1288, where three canons and several vicars served. The first canon at the castle church was Tylco, who served from 1293 to 1305. He is mentioned in documents of Duke Mieszko I and Przemysław of Racibórz. After 1305, a canon named Godin is mentioned in documents. Przemysł I had a chaplain named Jeszko, who in 1295 was also titled as a canon, and later in 1299 as the pastor of Rybnik. Documents from 1290 also mention a chaplain named Otto. From the names of the clergy, it can be inferred that they originated from Western Europe. The bishop and the duke endowed the canon prebends with tithes collected from villages belonging to the Duchy of Cieszyn and Racibórz.\nIn the 14th century, it is likely that none of the three canons resided in the castle anymore, because Bishop Przecław of Pogorzela obligated at least one canon to stay at the castle for a period of one year. Their task was to guard the relics, equipment, and liturgical vestments. In 1308, Duke Leszek of Racibórz became the founder of a prebend from the altar of St. Margaret, and also transferred judicial power over the colonists living in the castle settlement to the canons. On February 27, 1359, Bishop Przecław decided that the canons of the castle chapel would be directly subject to the authority of the Bishopric of Wrocław. In addition, the bishop determined the appearance of their attire and ordered them to appear before the Wrocław chapter annually during the commemoration of St. Thomas. They were also required to report on the activities of Bishop Tomasz II's foundation. The bishop, for his part, undertook to protect the legal rights of the canons, the chapel, and its possessions. Everything was recorded in a special document, which emphasized the great importance of the Racibórz collegiate church at the local castle.\n\nIn 1416, the chapter was moved to the parish church. At that time, it was served by five prelates, twelve canons, and a host of vicars. The reason for changing the location of the chapter was that the city had greater significance than the castle at that time. According to Augustin Weltzel:There was great zeal in establishing canonries to have a magnificent chapter. The castle chapel was insufficient for this purpose; moreover, canons and vicars living in the city had difficulty in punctually and promptly performing their duties due to the closure of the city and castle gates. When fourteen canonries were already established, the duke decided to request the bishop to transfer the collegiate chapter from the castle chapel to the parish church.\n\n\n== Schneider's map ==\n\nIn 1988, the city authorities, along with the Catholic Church, reached an agreement regarding the renovation of the castle chapel. During the renovation work, a map dating back to 1843 was found in the small tower on the spire. The map depicted the urban development of the city in 1843 and 1858, thanks to handwritten annotations.\nThe map became a historical discovery due to the annotations made by Robert Schneider, who likely oversaw the reconstruction of the castle after the fire. He marked on the map an underground tunnel that started at the site of the old castle tower and ended at the Dominican convent. This was probably the legendary passage under the Oder river described by Hyckel.\n\n\n== Relics ==\n\nIn the chapel, there were likely relics of saints placed in the lower chamber. Although in 1416 the collegiate chapter was transferred to the parish church, daily Masses were still held in the castle chapel, and four times a year a solemn procession to honor the relics kept there took place.\nThe first saint whose relics may have been in the chapel was its English patron, Thomas Becket. This might have been dictated by the custom of displaying the garments or bones of patrons in special places within the churches. Obtaining the relics of St. Thomas was not difficult in those times, as the Canterbury Cathedral was one of the largest pilgrimage sites.\n\nAnother saint whose relics might have been in the castle chapel was Stanislaus of Szczepanów. This could be explained by the reverence shown to this saint by the rulers of Racibórz – Vladislaus I and Przemysław. Jan Długosz mentions Przemysław's piety in the Annals or Chronicles of the Famous Kingdom of Poland:Each year, to honor him [St. Stanislaus] on his birthday, he [Przemysł] usually carried from Racibórz Castle to the Dominican monastery a candle so large that it exceeded his strength. (...) When he [Przemysł] lay in his last sickness, St. Stanislaus appeared to him and, having kindly comforted him, admonished him to prepare for the observance of his feast. To his reply: 'How can I do that when I am weak and pressed down by a severe illness?' the saint of God added: 'I will help you,' he says, 'and add strength'. Duke Przemysł promised that he would do this, and he died childless on the vigil of St. Stanislaus. He was buried on his feast day, although two of his brothers: Prince Kazimierz of Bytom and Prince Mieszko of Cieszyn, as well as the lords of Racibórz, were strongly opposed to it and wanted to keep his body longer to arrange the funeral on another day. Since the dukes and lords changed their minds, he was buried in the Dominican monastery in Racibórz, to celebrate the feast of St. Stanislaus not every year, but continuously in the future.The relics might also have come from the ancient Romanesque rotunda that presumably stood in the place of the current chapel. Consideration is given to fragments of the True Cross, which relics were very popular at the time. In the treasury of the parish church, there is even a Renaissance pax with glazed pieces of the True Cross.\nHowever, the authenticity of the relics is doubtful because there are no records confirming their existence. It is assumed that they probably were destroyed during the fire in 1519. The scenario of the relics being destroyed during the Reformation, when the castle was owned by George the Pious Hohenzollern, is also considered. Augustin Weltzel mentions relics in the 19th century.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nWawoczny, Grzegorz (2002). Zamek w Raciborzu (in Polish).

        "content": "On 5 August 1993, six Kazakhstani hikers died in the Khamar-Daban mountain range under uncertain circumstances. The event has been likened to the Dyatlov Pass incident, earning it the name \"Buryatia's Dyatlov Pass\".\nThe six hikers who died were members of a seven-person hiking group led by Lyudmila Korovina; Valentina Utochenko was the group's sole survivor. Although the police receiving a report, no formal search was carried out until 24 August. It took two days for helicopters to locate the remains, because Utochenko had not yet been able to recount her version of what had happened. According to an autopsy report, all of the victims died of hypothermia, except Korovina, who died from a heart attack.\n\n\n== Background ==\nKhamar-Daban, a mountain range in Southern Siberia, in the Republic of Buryatia, Russia, was a popular tourist hiking spot. In the summer of 1993, Lyudmila Korovina of the Petropavl \"Azimut\" tourist club, an experienced hiking instructor and a Master of Sports in hiking, planned a hiking trip to the Khamar-Daban mountains. She was joined by six of her students: Aleksander \"Sacha\" Krysin, Tatyana Filipenko, Denis Shvachkin, Valentina \"Valya\" Utochenko, Viktoriya Zalesova and Timur Bapanov. Korovina had previous experience hiking in the Khamar-Daban area, and the students trained with her for the trip.\n\n\n== The trip ==\nThe group of seven hikers, led by Korovina, arrived in Irkutsk by train in August 1993. Korovina's hiking group was one of three in the area, one of which was being led by her daughter, Natalia. Starting on 2 August 1993, their trip led from the village of Murino, along the Langutai river, through the Langutai Gates pass, along the Barun-Yunkatsuk river, up the Khanulu mountain and along its ridge, ending on the watershed plateau of the Anigta and Baiga rivers. Korovina's group was meant to cross paths with her daughter's on 5 August.\nThe first two days of the hike turned out to have went better than the group had planned, with them making good time up Retranslyator peak, however, on 4 August, as they were beginning their descent, they were hit with an unexpected rainstorm. Korovina decided to make camp in an exposed location, with the group failing at an attempt to build a fire that night. They managed to build a fire in the morning of 5 August and ate breakfast together before continuing their path.\n\n\n== The deaths ==\nAccording to Valentina Utochenko, the sole survivor, while descending down the mountain, at the altitude of 2,396 metres (7,861 ft), Krysin, who was at the back of the group, started screaming. He was bleeding from his eyes and ears, frothing at the mouth. He fell to the ground convulsing and then went still. Korovina ran up to him, trying to get him to gain consciousness. A moment later, she cried out, having the same symptoms as Krysin. She convulsed and then collapsed on top of Krysin. Filipenko, who had gotten to Korovina first, was the next to collapse, grabbing at her throat as though she couldn't breath. She crawled over to a nearby rock and bashed her head against it until she went limp. Zalesova and Bapanov started to run. While running, they collapsed and died throwing up blood and clawing at their own throats, tearing their clothes off. Utochenko and Shvachkin hurried away, but shortly after Shvachkin also collapsed convulsing.\nUtochenko ran down the mountain, set up a tent for the night under tree cover and fell asleep. On the next day, she returned to the site of her friends' death to retrieve supplies she needed from their bodies. For four days, she followed power lines down the mountain in hopes that someone would find her. She found a river and started following it. On 9 August, she was found by a group of Ukrainian kayakers, who took her to the nearest police station where a report was filed.\n\n\n== Search and discovery ==\nUtochenko did not speak for several days. The official search was conducted on 24 August, led by Yuri Golius. Because Utochenko had not been able to recount her version of events yet, it took two days to find the bodies using helicopters. The hikers' bodies were noted to have been partially undressed.\nAll of the dead hikers were found to have signs of bruised lungs. An autopsy, carried out in Ulan-Ude, concluded that Krysin, Filipenko, Bapanov, Zalesova and Shvachkin died of hypothermia, and Korovina had a heart attack. Protein deficiency due to malnutrition was listed as a contributing factor to their deaths.\n\n\n== Theories ==\nMultiple theories have been proposed to explain what caused the hikers' deaths. Rescuers Valery Tatarnikov and Vladimir Zinov, who took part in the search operation for the bodies, claimed that it was impossible for the hikers to die of cold. Zinov suggested that they might have died of altitude sickness. Tourist Vladimir Borzenkov and member of the search operation Nikolai Fedorov suggested that the hikers went mad due to infrasounds. Yuri Golius, the leader of the search operation, blamed their deaths on Korovina's negligence, claiming she was starving her students, which caused them to have vitamin deficiency. In a 2018 interview for Komsomolskaya Pravda, Utochenko denied the theory that Korovina might have been responsible for the deaths. She believes that the cause of the hikers' deaths was pulmonary edema.\n\n\n=== Hypothermia ===\nThe first explanation proposes that the hikers died in the exact way the autopsy report concluded they did: by succumbing to hypothermia after not being properly sheltered that night. In severe hypothermia, there may be hallucinations and paradoxical undressing, in which a person removes their clothing, which would explain why the hikers were found partially undressed.\nCertain parts of Utochenko's story could have been unintentionally exaggerated by her, due to the fact that people who undergo a traumatic experience often misremember details of it.\n\n\n=== Military experiment ===\nOne theory suggests that the hikers might have stumbled upon a Russian military experiment conducted in the mountains and were killed so that the experiment would remain a secret. This theory was deemed uncredible due to the Khamar-Daban mountain range being a public area with many people traveling through it during tourist season, making it an unlikely place and time for conducting secret experiments.\n\n\n=== Nerve agents ===\nSymptoms described by Utochenko bear resemblance to death by nerve agents. In particular, the frothing at the mouth and convulsing match death by a strong nerve agent. The bruising of the lungs could also be a sign of death by nerve gas, as contact with it might cause respiratory distress. Cardiac arrest is also caused by it, matching Korovina's cause of death.\nNovichok, a family of nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union and Russia up to 1993 and considered to be the deadliest nerve agents to exist, were reportedly tested in areas near Khamar-Daban.\n\n\n=== Contaminated water ===\n\nThe nearby Lake Baikal is known to be a \"toxic waste dumping ground\". If the waste was washed downstream, the hikers might have drank the toxins in their water. Some toxins might not have been visible in a standard toxicology report.\n\n\n=== Mushroom poisoning ===\nAnother theory suggests that the hikers might have hallucinated and got sick due to a mushroom poisoning. Korovina was known to be a forager and she taught the art to her students. One of the hikers might have accidentally added poisonous mushrooms to their breakfast. An overdose of psilocybin might cause psychosis, convulsions, cardiac arrest, and send a person into a coma. A common hallucination caused by psilocybin is to see other people cry blood.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDyatlov Pass incident, an event in 1959 in which nine Soviet hikers died in the northern Ural Mountains under uncertain circumstances\nChivruay Pass incident, a tragedy occurring in 1973, involving a group of explorers mysteriously dying in the Russian wilderness during the Soviet era\nYuba County Five, known as the \"American Dyatlov Pass\", a 1978 incident in which five men mysteriously died or disappeared on their way back from a basketball game in Yuba County, California\nList of unsolved deaths\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Welfenschloss (English: Guelph palace) is a former royal palace in Hanover, Germany, which serves as the main building of the Leibniz University Hannover. The university is housed in the palace since 1879. The palace is surrounded by a large English landscape garden, named the Welfengarten (English: Guelph garden).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== A new royal residence ===\nIn 1856, king George V of Hanover (1819–1878) decided to build a new royal residence. Initially, only as a summer residence, but later intended as the main seat replacing the Leineschloss in the city center. The king engaged the architect Christian Heinrich Tramm (1819–1861) to make the designs in neo-Gothic style. When Tramm passed away, he was replaced by the construction manager of the project, Eduard Heidelberg.\nThe site of the palace of previously occupied by another palace, Schloss Monbrilliant. This palace dated from the first half of the 18th century. It served as a summer residence of kings Ernest Augustus (1771–1851) and George V. Before the building started of the new palace, it was demolished. It was rebuilt in Georgsmarienhütte, before it finally was teared down in 1923.\nConstruction of the Welfenschloss palace started in 1857. Workers used yellowish-white sandstone from the Danndorf and Velpke areas near Helmstedt, one of the hardest sandstones in Germany, and sandstone from Nesselberg near Nesselberg.\n\nThe palace was named Welfenschloss in1861 after the reigning dynasty, the House of Welf, of which the House of Hanover was the surviving branch. This also determined the iconography of the palace. On the side of the garden, the Welfengarten, the exterior is decorated with sculptures of eight significant Welf rulers. The sculptor Wilhelm Engelhard created around 1862 the most important one, that of Henry the Lion (1129/1131-1195). On the entrance side, Adolf Rosenthal created the bronze Lions.\nGeorge V's reign ended as a result of the Austro-Prussian War in 1866, after which Prussia annexed Hanover. Construction works ended, leaving the Welfenschloss palace empty for over a decade.\nIn the same time as the Welfenschloss was built, king George V also constructed another neo-gothic castle between 1858 and 1867, Marienburg castle. This he presented as a birthday present to his wife, queen Marie (1818–1907).\n\n\n=== A new purpose: the University of Hanover ===\n\nIt was not until 1879, that a new purpose was found for the palace: the Higher Vocational School moved in, now named the University of Hanover. Extensive renovations works were performed by Hermann Hunaeus to transform the palace into a school building. In 1899, emperor Wilhelm II elevated the school the status of a university.\nDuring the Allied aerial raids on Hanover, the chapel on the east side of the palace was heavily damaged. In 1955, it was demolished. On its location, an extension was erected between 1956 and 1958 to house an auditorium and a lecture hall.\nIn 2006, the University of Hanover was renamed Leibniz University Hannover.\n\n\n== Saxon Steed ==\nIn front of the palace, there is a bronze statue of a Saxon Steed (German: Sachsenross), created in 1866. It is a duplicate from a sculpture made by Albert Wolf for the entrance of the Altes Museum in Berlin, the Löwenkämpfer. The Saxon Steed is a heraldic motif associated with the German provinces of Lower Saxony and Westphalia, and the Dutch region of Twente.\n\n\n== Panorama ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Literature ==\nWeiß, Gerd (1983). \"Ehemaliges Welfenschloss\".

        "content": "The Statue of N. F. S, Grundtvig, situated in the central courtyard of Vartorv, close to the City Hall Square in central Copenhagen, Denmark, was created by Niels Skovgaard. It depicts N. F. S. Grundtvig knealing by the Spring of Life.\n\n\n== Description ==\nGrundtvig is depicted knealing by the Spring of Life. Skovgaard has signed the sculpture with his monigram (NKS) and the inscription Grundtvig og Livskilden (Grundtvig and the Spring of Life)  on the sole of his back-facing left shoe.\nNiels Skovgaard based his portrail of Grundtvig on his father P. C. Skovgaatrd's 1948 portrait drawing of Grundtvig. It is believed that P. X. Skovgaard's drawing was inspired by a three years older drawing by Gertner.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nNiels Skovgaard was the son of P. C. Skovgaard and Georgia Skovgaard. Grundtvig was a close friend of the family. He conducted the ceremony at the parents' wedding and their children Niels, Joakim andSuzette were also baptized by him. Niels Skovgaard and his brother Joakim were also good friends of Grundtvig's two sons. Throughout his career, Skovgaard received numerous commissions from independent Grundtvigian congregations and folk high Schools.\nGrundtvig died in 1872. A statue of him by Vilhelm Bissen was installed at the Frederick's Church construction site in 1894. In 1904, Rasmus Bøgebjerg proposed another Grundtvig statue. His proposal depicted Grundtvig with a lark sitting on his left hand. The proposal was subject to a prolonged debate.\n\n\n=== The teo competitions ===\n\nIn 1912, a competition for a Grundtvig monument was launched. Skovgaard's proposal received an award but none of the 32 submissions were selected as the final winner. Skovgaard was around the same time working on a portrait relief of Grundtvig for the Grundtvig House on Studiestræde. A new invited competition was launched in 1913. The new competition was won by Niels Hansen Jacobsen. Peder Vilhelm Jensen-Klint awarded second prioze. It was later decided by the jury to go with Jensen-Klint's proposal. He had proposed a bell tower. It was later expaneed into the monumental Grundtvig's Church (1921–1940).\n\n\n=== Creating the sculpture ===\n\nSkovgaard kept working on his 1912 proposl. In 1925 he was finally commissioned by the Nt Carlsberg Foundation to create a granite version of the sculpture for Vartov's courtyard. It was executed with fewer details than the original proposal.

        "content": "The probability of superiority or common language effect size is the probability that, when sampling a pair of observations from two groups, the observation from the second group will be larger than the sample from the first group. It is used to describe a difference between two groups and was proposed, as well as named, by Kenneth McGraw and S. P. Wong in 1992.\n\n\n== Examples ==\nMcGraw and Wong gave the example of sex differences in height, noting that when comparing a random man with a random woman, the probability that the man will be taller is 92%. (Alternatively, in 92 out of 100 blind dates, the male will be taller than the female.)\nThe population value for the common language effect size is often reported like this, in terms of pairs randomly chosen from the population. Kerby (2014) notes that a pair, defined as a score in one group paired with a score in another group, is a core concept of the common language effect size.\nAs another example, consider a scientific study (maybe of a treatment for some chronic disease, such as arthritis) with ten people in the treatment group and ten people in a control group. If everyone in the treatment group is compared to everyone in the control group, then there are (10×10=) 100 pairs. At the end of the study, the outcome is rated into a score, for each individual (for example on a scale of mobility and pain, in the case of an arthritis study), and then all the scores are compared between the pairs. The result, as the percent of pairs that support the hypothesis, is the common language effect size. In the example study it could be (let's say) .80, if 80 out of the 100 comparison pairs show a better outcome for the treatment group than the control group, and the report may read as follows: \"When a patient in the treatment group was compared to a patient in the control group, in 80 of 100 pairs the treated patient showed a better treatment outcome.\" The sample value, in for example a study like this, is an unbiased estimator of the population value.\n\n\n== Equivalent statistics ==\n\nAn effect size related to the common language effect size is the rank-biserial correlation.  This measure was introduced by Cureton as an effect size for the Mann–Whitney U test. That is, there are two groups, and scores for the groups have been converted to ranks.\nThe Kerby simple difference formula computes the rank-biserial correlation from the common language effect size. Letting f be the proportion of pairs favorable to the hypothesis (the common language effect size), and letting u be the proportion of pairs not favorable, the rank-biserial r is the simple difference between the two proportions: r = f − u.  In other words, the correlation is the difference between the common language effect size and its complement.  For example, if the common language effect size is 60%, then the rank-biserial r equals 60% minus 40%, or r = 0.20. The Kerby formula is directional, with positive values indicating that the results support the hypothesis.\nA non-directional formula for the rank-biserial correlation was provided by Wendt, such that the correlation is always positive.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPairwise comparisons\nCondorcet winner criterion\nIntransitive dice\n\n\n== References ==",

The sixteen participating national teams are required to register a squad of 23 players, including at least three goalkeepers. Only players in these squads are eligible to take part in the tournament.\nEach national team has to submit to CONMEBOL, via the COMET system, a provisional list with a minimum of 35 and a maximum of 55 players (including at least four goalkeepers) by 5 May 2024, 18:00 PYT (UTC−4) (Regulations Article 58). The final list or squad list of 23 players per national team must be submitted to CONMEBOL by 12 June 2024, 18:00 PYT (UTC−4), a week prior to the start of the tournament. All players in the final selection have to be chosen from the respective provisional list (Regulations Article 60).\nOnce the final lists are submitted, teams are only permitted to make replacements in cases of serious injury, illness or due to medical reasons up to 24 hours before the first match of the team in the competition. All the substitutions have to have the approval of the CONMEBOL Medical Commission and replacement players have to come from the provisional list (Regulations Article 71).\nThe provisional lists are not published by CONMEBOL as they are only for internal use.\nThe age listed for each player is as of 20 June 2024, the first day of the tournament. The numbers of caps and goals listed for each player do not include any matches played after the start of the tournament. The club listed is the club for which the player last played a competitive match prior to the tournament.

        "content": "Thurrock Town Hall is a newest part of municipal complex in New Road in Grays, Essex, a town in England. The complex accommodates the offices and meeting place of Thurrock Council.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nFollowing significant population growth, largely associated with chemical manufacturing, a local board of health was established in Grays in 1886. The board was succeeded by Grays Thurrock Urban District Council in 1894, and council offices were established at No. 53 High Street. After the urban districts of Grays Thurrock, Purfleet and Tilbury, as well as the Orsett Rural District were amalgamated to form Thurrock Urban District Council in 1936, the enlarged council established its offices in a house, previously known as \"Farley\", in Whitehall Lane in Grays. This remained the meeting place for Thurrock Council after it was formed in 1974.\nHowever, in the early 1980s, in the context of the increased responsibilities of local authorities, council leaders decided that they needed more substantial facilities. The oldest part of the new complex was the eastern section, on the corner with Derby Road. It was designed in the modern style, built in red brick and opened as Thurrock Council Offices in 1986. This building later became known as Council Offices Building 1 ('CO1'). The design of the three-storey building involved an asymmetrical main frontage of 11 bays facing onto New Road. The eighth bay contained a full-height plate-glass wall, which was projected forward and surmounted by a semi-circular stone clad roof. The upper floors were slightly canted forward and fenestrated by a series of tall bi-partite and tri-partite casement windows. Internally, the principal rooms were the council chamber, the committee rooms and the offices themselves.\nThe complex was extended to the west in a similar style in 1992. This building later became known as Council Offices Building 2 ('CO2'). Again, the first and second floors were slightly canted forward and fenestrated by a series of tall tri-partite casement windows. However, there was an additional floor which was fully clad in plate glass. Internally, the new block including a reception area and additional offices.\nIn October 2019, the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, visited the council offices to sign a book of condolence commemorating 39 Vietnamese people who had died in the trailer of a refrigerator lorry.\nBy the 2020s, the offices needed refurbishment.  The council decided to vacate the 1986 building, to refurbish the 1992 extension, and to erect an additional block even further to the west on the corner of the New Road and the High Street, facing St Peter & St Paul's Church. The site was occupied by four shops which were demolished. The new block was designed by LSI Architects, built in buff brick at a cost of £10 million and was completed in 2022. This building was known during the development phase as Council Offices Building 3 ('CO3'). The design of the new block involved an asymmetrical main frontage in two sections facing onto the High Street. Both sections were jettied out over the pavement with the left-hand section supported by piers. Internally, it incorporated a new reception area, committee rooms, a council chamber, a registry office, a cafe, and new offices.\nFollowing its completion, the council voted to rename new building \"Thurrock Town Hall\". The vacated 1986 building was marketed for sale on August 2023. The council indicated that it was suitable for conversion, or for redevelopment to allow new housing to be erected on that site.\n\n\n== References ==",

In a 1660 report, he described a man who refused to repent of \"living in sin\" being eaten by a caiman.\nFrom 1661 to 1664, Cabrero was assigned as visitor general in New Spain. In consultation with the provincial superior, Pedro Antonio Díaz, he finalized a new code for the Jesuit missions in New Spain on September 20, 1662.\nIn 1676, Cabrero approved the foundation of the Jesuit Missions of Moxos.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Lucky Man: Music from the Film is the soundtrack to the 2010 film Lucky Man, directed by Jean-Marie Boulet and Markus Hansen, documenting violinist and Vietnam veteran Billy Bang's 2008 visit to the country, 40 years after his participation in the Vietnam War as a tunnel rat. The album consists of field recordings created during Bang's travels across Vietnam, during which he interacted with local musicians, and came to appreciate the country's culture while at the same time seeking closure for the trauma he experienced during the war. The recording was released in 2021 on vinyl, CD, and as a digital download by BBE Music in association with IF Music.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nIn a review for Jazzwise, Kevin Le Gendre wrote: \"Bang was nothing if not open-minded and his ability to blend a wide range of black music, from hard blues to open avant-garde, serve him well here in the company of skilled traditional players... This is deeply poignant music that offers invaluable catharsis to the horrors of war.\"\nKarl Ackermann of All About Jazz stated: \"The music is unlike anything else that Bang had recorded... Bang sometimes sounds like he has conquered his demons, but at other times, his pain is palpable... Bang's trademark acerbic but animated style is peppered with the violinist's inner dialog.\"\nWriting for Strings Magazine, Greg Cahill called Bang's playing \"poignant,\" and commented: \"The personal nature of these field recordings has a healing effect and sheds new light on Bang’s own dogged pursuit of peace.\"\nJazz Journal's Matthew Wright described the music as \"wonderful,\" with Bang \"relating to and recognising the link between the Vietnamese style of playing and sound and his own.\" He praised the track titled \"Mystery of the Mekong,\" featuring Bang's violin \"soaring above a rich aggregation of strings, resonant cellos and almost rhapsodic support from the piano.\"\nIn an article for Truth and Lies, Justin Turford called the album \"an extraordinary soundtrack to an extraordinary film about an extraordinary man,\" with music that is \"unlike anything I've heard before.\" He singled out the track titled \"Dan Da,\" on which Bang's violin joins Duc Dau's dan da, a stone lithophone, describing it as \"the most perfect example of improvisational skill between two masters from different worlds,\" and noting: \"Their elation and excitement is palpable as they push and drive each other to new heights and is a privilege to behold.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"Lucky Man: Introduction\" – 4:10\n\"Billy playing with the Banhar Gong Group of Kuntum (traditional and improvised)\" – 6:16\n\"Lucky Man: Flashback Tunnel Reflections\" – 1:26\n\"Mystery of the Mekong\" – 6:59\n\"Lucky Man: The Sun Rising - Introduction to Song for Don Cherry\" – 1:03\n\"Song for Don Cherry\" – 13:26\n\"Lucky Man: Flashback Memories\" – 1:45\n\"New Saigon Phunk (Extended Version)\" – 11:35\n\"Lucky Man: Traditional Vietnamese Catru Music\" – 0:59\n\"Lucky Man: Billy Reflecting on Memories and Feelings\" – 0:51\n\"Jungle Lullaby (Live at the Sax n'Art Club)\" – 12:26\n\"Lucky Man: Quynh Anh Pham's Memories About Her Father\" – 1:07\n\"Dan Da\" – 9:45\n\"Lucky Man: Billy Speaking About Music and Art\" – 0:47\n\"Lucky Man: Flashlight and a 45 Tunnel Memories\" – 1:53\n\"Lucky Man Title Music: Vietnam 1967 Battle Composition\" – 1:06\n\"Lucky Man: Teach Me Banhar\" – 1:09\n\"Traditional Quan Ho\" – 5:47\n\"Lucky Man: Billy Reflecting on America, Music and Being Left Alone\" – 1:05\n\"Moments for the KIAMIA (Solo in a Hotel Interior Courtyard)\" – 2:30\n\"Lucky Man: Quynh Anh Pham Lullaby\" – 0:44\n\"New Saigon Phunk\" – 5:51\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nBilly Bang – violin, voice\nBanhar Gong Group (track 2)\nHanoi Symphony Orchestra conducted by Tuan Phuong (track 4)\nDuc Dau – dan da (tracks 6, 8, 13, 22)\nPhu Dong Family Band (tracks 6, 8, 9, 22)\nTrần Mạnh Tuấn – saxophone (track 11)\nQuynh Anh Pham – voice (track 12)\nCau River Singers  – vocals (track 18)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Hot Girl Walk is a 4-mile outdoor walk that encourages participants to focus on gratitude, goals, and confidence. Created by Mia Lind in 2020, Hot Girl Walk's goal is to bring women together through accessible and inclusive fitness training that promotes both mental and physical well-being. The walks can be taken as an individual activity, or they can be done in groups. Hot Girl Walk events are organized by Hot Girl Walk LLC and its Ambassadors.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe concept of Hot Girl Walk was created in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic when American student Mia Lind, a graduate of the University of Southern California, began taking four-mile walks as a means of relieving stress. During these walks, Lind reflected on gratitude, goals, and confidence, and she began calling it a \"Hot Girl Walk\". She began to promote the concept on TikTok under her account \"exactlyliketheothergirls\" on January 23, 2021.\nLind trademarked the name \"Hot Girl Walk\" in April 2021, receiving official trademark status from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) on April 25, 2023. She established Hot Girl Walk LLC in February 2023, based in California and registered in Delaware (File Number: 7286657). She subsequently registered the trademark in the United Kingdom, the European Union, Japan, Monaco and Canada. Hot Girl Walk LLC also has several trademarks filed with the USPTO and in other countries for additional classes andservices, including the term HGW as a shorthand for Hot Girl Walk (Registration Number: 7037847).\nIn 2023 Hot Girl Walk began a marketing partnership with the fitness app company Strava.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Yamada–Watanabe theorem is a result from probability theory saying that for a large class of stochastic differential equations a weak solution with pathwise uniqueness implies a strong solution and uniqueness in distribution. In its original form, the theorem was stated for \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n  \n-dimensional Itô equations and was proven by the Japanese mathematicians Toshio Yamada and Shinzō Watanabe in 1971. Since then, many generalizations appeared particularly one for general semimartingales by Jean Jacod from 1980.\n\n\n== Yamada–Watanabe theorem ==\n\n\n=== History, generalizations and related results ===\nJean Jacod generalized the result to SDEs of the form\n\n  \n    \n      \n        d\n        \n          X\n          \n            t\n          \n        \n        =\n        u\n        (\n        X\n        ,\n        Z\n        )\n        d\n        \n          Z\n          \n            t\n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle dX_{t}=u(X,Z)dZ_{t},}\n  \n\nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        \n          Z\n          \n            t\n          \n        \n        \n          )\n          \n            t\n            ≥\n            0\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (Z_{t})_{t\\geq 0}}\n  \n is a semimartingale and the coefficient \n  \n    \n      \n        u\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle u}\n  \n can depend on the path of \n  \n    \n      \n        Z\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle Z}\n  \n.\nFurther generalisations were done by Hans-Jürgen Engelbert (1991) and Thomas G. Kurtz (2007). For SDEs in Banach spaces there is a result from Martin Ondrejat (2004), one by Michael Röckner, Byron Schmuland and Xicheng Zhang (2008) and one by Stefan Tappe (2013).\nThe converse of the theorem is also true and called the dual Yamada–Watanabe theorem. The first version of this theorem was proven by Engelbert (1991) and a more general version by Alexander Cherny (2002).\n\n\n=== Setting ===\nLet \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n        ,\n        r\n        ∈\n        \n          N\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n,r\\in \\mathbb {N} }\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        C\n        (\n        \n          \n            R\n          \n          \n            +\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          \n            R\n          \n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C(\\mathbb {R} _{+},\\mathbb {R} ^{n})}\n  \n be the space of continuous functions.

distribution. And if for every initial distribution, there exists a weak solution, then for every initial distribution, also a pathwise unique strong solution exists.\nJacod's result improved the statement with the additional statement that\n\nIf a weak solutions exists and pathwise uniqueness holds, then this solution is also a strong solution.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Rimo Bacigalupi (1901–1996), known as \"Bach\", was an American botanist and taxonomist, an expert in the flora of California. He was the first curator of the Jepson Herbarium at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nRimo was a son of Prospero and Gisella Bacigalupi, who were of Genovese origin. He was educated at Lowell High School and entered Stanford University intending to become a lawyer, but changed his major from English to botany, receiving the A.B. degree in 1923 and A.M. in 1925. He then taught botany and Italian at Mills College before studying at Harvard for his Ph.D. degree which was awarded in 1931. He worked for the California Forest Experimental Station of the U.S. Forest Service 1933–1938. He served with the U.S. Army during World War II, then returned to Stanford as an instructor in biology. He was president of the California Botanical Society 1957–1958.\nWhen Willis Linn Jepson, professor of botany at UC Berkeley, died in 1946, he left his estate to the University of California for the purpose of continuing his studies of Californian flora. With the bequest the university established the Jepson Herbarium and Library, and Bacigalupi was appointed its first curator in 1950. He retired in 1968 but continued his botanical studies until suffering a stroke in 1983.\nBesides his mastery of botany, Bacigalupi was an expert in operatic scores, Romance languages, postage stamps and railroads. He was a member of the Sierra Club for 71 years.\n\n\n== Eponyms ==\nPerideridia bacigalupii\nDeinandra bacigalupii\nDowningia bacigalupii\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Polly Rowena Atkin  (born 1980) is an English poet and non-fiction writer based in Grasmere, Cumbria.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nAtkin was born in 1980 in Nottingham and grew up there, then lived seven years in East London before moving north. She has a PhD (2010) from Lancaster University, for which her  thesis was \"A place re-imagined : the cultural, literacy and spacial making of Dove Cottage, Grasmere\".  She has an MA in creative writing from Royal Holloway, University of London, for which her thesis was \"Writing the Body Well: Poetry and Illness\".\n\n\n== Career ==\nAtkin taught English and creative writing at the Lancaster University from 2010 to 2014, and at the University of Strathclyde from 2014 to 2017, and has since taught creative  writing at the universities of Lancaster and Cumbria.\nAtkin's pamphlet bone song was shortlisted for the first Michael Marks Award for Poetry Pamphlets, in 2009. Her second pamphlet, Shadow Dispatches (2013), won the Mslexia pamphlet prize, and was shortlisted for the 2014 Lakeland Book of the Year.\nIn 2018, Atkin was writer in residence at Gladstone's Library.\nIn 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, she was awarded a Northern Writers Award for Poetry, and said of it \"This award not only offers creative encouragement when I really need it, but financial support which will make continuing to create possible. It has saved my year.\"\nAtkin's 2021 biography of Dorothy Wordsworth, Recovering Dorothy: The Hidden Life of Dorothy Wordsworth, draws on Dorothy's letters and unpublished diaries and \"argues for Dorothy's place in the writing of illness\". It was longlisted for the 2022 Barbellion Prize for books by ill or disabled writers.\nHer 2023 memoir Some of Us Just Fall was longlisted for the 2024 Lakeland Book of the Year. It has been described as \"a raw and exquisite meditation on chronic illness and our place within the landscape\", \"An empowered and patient story, at times murky and tedious, but still poignant\", and \"Essentially ... a book about bearing the unbearable\".\nShe is a founder and director of The Gravestone Project, \"a digital humanities collective that brings together scholars, taphophiles, students, writers, teachers, and others interested in history, literature, and the arts, to think about the various ways that people memorialize the dead\".\nShe was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 2022.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nAtkin has one of the  Ehlers–Danlos syndromes and genetic haemochromatosis, and writes and talks about living with chronic illness especially in relation to rural life and access to nature.  She was a speaker at the 2023 Kendal Mountain Festival but published an open letter criticising the announcement that the festival's events would not be filmed that year, announced as an  \"enrichment\" at short notice, arguing that this deprived many people, because of disability, geography, finance or other barriers, of the joy of  access to the festival whose theme, that year, was \"joy\".\nAtkins lives in Grasmere, Cumbria. In 2023 she and her partner Will Smith bought Sam Read's, Grasmere's independent bookshop established in 1887, where Smith had worked since 2012.\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\n\n\n=== Non-fiction ===\n\n\n==== Books ====\nAtkin, Polly (2023).

        "content": "The Bewitched Tour (known as Bewitched: The Goddess Tour for the 2024 dates) is the ongoing second concert tour by Icelandic musician Laufey.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn September of 2023, Laufey released her second full-length album Bewitched. In the fall of 2023, Laufey embarked on a North American headlining tour, which sold out instantly. In early 2024, Laufey embarked on a European tour. Laufey also embarked on a second North American leg, titled \"Bewitched: The Goddess Tour\", which also sold out instantly. In May 2024, Laufey will perfform multiple shows in Asia. In July, Laufey will perform more European dates. In August and September 2024, Laufey will return to Asia again for tour dates, as well as Australia for the first time.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nThe tour received positive reviews. Writing for Boston.com, Maddie Browning said, \"She is the leading lady in a theatrical performance about the trials and immense joys of young love, drawing inspiration from artists like jazz icon Ella Fitzgerald.\" Writing for The Harvard Crimson, Claire Elliott wrote \"The shared theme of love across her songs only intensified her brilliant performance. Laufey’s songs are not simply about love in its vague sense. She treats every type of love — ecstasy, heartache, anger, and even confusion — with the same delicacy and attention. As a result, her performance becomes an encapsulation of what it means to love — making it quite hard not to love her.\"\n\n\n== Setlist ==\nThis set list is representative of the show in Chicago, Illinois on April 28, 2024. It is not representative of all concerts for the duration of the tour.[\n\nWhile You Were Sleeping\nValentine\nSecond Best\nDreamer\nFalling Behind\nBeautiful Stranger\nI Wish You Love (Keely Smith cover)\nPromise\nLike the Movies\nNocturne (Interlude)\nLet You Break My Heart Again\nCalifornia and Me\nGoddess\nFragile\nBewitched\nBored\nLovesick\nFrom the Start\nLetter to My 13 Year Old Self\nIt Could Happen to You (Jimmy Van Heusen cover)\n\n\n== Tour dates ==\n\n\n== References ==",

The genus is mainly characterized by its jaws: in the upper jaw there's an absent upper Molar\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle ^{2}}\n  \n, and greatly enlarged but thin upper Premolar\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          \n            4\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle ^{4}}\n  \n and Molar\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          \n            1\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle ^{1}}\n  \n; while the lower jaw has a small and forward P\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle ^{2}}\n  \n, the absence of a lingual or labial cingulum around the P\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          \n            4\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle ^{4}}\n  \n and a well developed  M\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          \n            1\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle ^{1}}\n  \n; neither jaw has a present Premolar\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          \n            1\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle ^{1}}\n  \n. In regards to skull morphology, it is smoother and narrower than in living skunks, with a large, flask-shaped basicranial bulla.\n\n\n=== Martinogale alveodens ===\nThis species was described in 1930 as a small mustelid from a fragmentary lower jaw found in the Edson Quarry, from late Hemphillian Kansas. It was described as the type of the new genus. Due to its fragmentary nature, the placement of Martinogale within Mustelidae was uncertain, but seemed feasible due to some similarities to the earlier Martes nambianus. In 1938, a better preserved jaw indicated similarities with the spotted skunks of Mephitidae. The species name, alveodens, hails from Latin alveus, “a hollow, cavity or channel\" and dens, \"tooth\"\n\n\n=== Martinogale chisoensis ===\nThe largest species, M. chisoensis hails from the early Hemphillian Crew Bean Local, it was described in 2003 based on a rather complete skull. Due to the cranial similarities with Buisnictis it was named \"Buisnictis\" chisoensis. In 2005, along with the description of M. faulli, it was reassigned to Martinogale. The species name, chisoensis, comes from Chisos Mountains in Big Bend National Park, Texas, and ensis, Latin for “from”.\n\n\n=== Martinogale faulli ===\nThe oldest and smallest of the species, M. faulli was described in 2005 from a partial skull found in the Late Clarendonian Dove Spring Formation, from Kern County, California. M. faulli has a smoother skull than M. chisoensis and relatively smaller teeth, with a better defined basicranial bulla. The species name faulli is in honor of Mark Faull, a former ranger at Red Rock Canyon State Park.\n\n\n=== Martinogale? nambiana ===\nIn 1874, a P\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          \n            3\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle ^{3}}\n  \n, P\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          \n            4\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle ^{4}}\n  \nand an incredibly fragmentary M\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          \n            1\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle ^{1}}\n  \nwere discovered in the Santa Fé Marls, New Mexico. Cope originally identified it as Martes nambianus, uncertain of this association, a year later Cope moved it to Mustela nambiana. When Hall erected Martinogale, he moved M. nambiana into his new genus, where it has since remained. In 2005, Wang et. al. argued that the few characteristics present in these teeth were too non-specific, arguing that they simply represent the basal mustelid condition and that M? nambiana should not be considered a part of Martinogale; that the specimen can't be ascribed to a concrete genus.\n\n\n== Phylogeny ==\nWhen compared to modern genera, both extant: Spilogale, Mephitis and Conepatus, as well as extinct: Brachyprotoma and Osmotherium, Martinogale presents reasonable differences in the premolar structure, thin postorbital skull, slightly expanded mastoid process and the general structure of the  basicranial bulla. In 2005 Wang et al.'s phylogenetic analysis recovered Martinogale as a somewhat paraphyletic association, although as their chronology advances so does their derivation:\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Francisco Xavier Villarroya (1734–1768) was a Jesuit missionary to New Spain.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nVillarroya was born in Villarroya de los Pinares, Spain, on November 20, 1734. Along with his close friend and fellow Jesuit, Custodio Ximeno, Villarroya traveled to Sonora in the spring of 1763. The two men were also accompanied by Juan Claudio de Pineda, the new governor of Sonora.\nVillarroya was initially assigned to Missions Los Siete Príncipes del Átil and San Pedro y San Pablo del Tubutama. In August 1763, he was reassigned to Mission Nuestra Señora de los Remedios de Banámichi. Over the next few years, he served intermittently at Banámichi, Mission Santa María de Bacerac, and Mission San Miguel de Ures.\nIn July 1767, Spanish soldiers from Presidio Santa Gertrudis del Altar arrived to carry out the orders of Charles III by expelling the Jesuits from Mexico. Along with about fifty other Jesuits, Villarroya was escorted to a church in Mátape, near Hermosillo. From there, the soldiers took them to Guaymas, down the Gulf of California, through Tepic, and to Guadalajara. Many of the Jesuits died on the way, including Villarroya, who died on September 1, 1768, in Ixtlán del Río.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "John Thomas Smith  (16 April 1805 – 14 May 1882) was a British colonel in the Royal Engineers.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nSmith was the second son of George Smith of Edwalton, Nottinghamshire, and afterwards of Foëlallt, Cardiganshire, by his wife Eliza Margaret, daughter of Welham Davis, elder brother of the Trinity House. He was born at Foëlallt on 16 April 1805. He was educated at Repton and at the high school, Edinburgh, entered the military college of the East India Company at Addiscombe in 1822, and received a commission as second lieutenant in the Madras engineers on 17 June 1824. He was promoted to be first lieutenant on the following day, and went to Chatham for a course of instruction in professional subjects. Smith left Chatham on 4 February 1825, and arrived at Madras on 2 September of the same year.\nOn 28 April 1826 Smith was appointed acting superintending engineer in the public works department for the northern division of the presidency, and on 2 May 1828 he was confirmed in the appointment. He thereupon began a series of investigations in reference to lighthouse-lanterns, devising a reciprocating light. Smith suggested to government the improvement of the lighthouse at Hope's Island, off Coringa, and at the end of 1833 his services were placed at the disposal of the marine board, with a view to the improvement of the lighthouse at Madras. On 11 February 1834 ill-health compelled Smith to sail for England on leave of absence. Before his departure the governor in council informed him in very complimentary terms that the marine board had adopted his plans for remodelling the lighthouses both at Madras and at Hope's Island. He was promoted to be captain on 5 March 1835.\nSmith remained in England until 28 July 1837, and in the same year he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. He was given an extension of furlough to superintend the manufacture of apparatus for the Madras lighthouse. He employed his leisure in the translation of J. L. Vicat's valuable treatise on mortars and cements, to which he added the results of many original experiments, and saw the work through the press before leaving for India. It appeared as ‘A Practical and Scientific Treatise on Calcareous Mortars and Cements, Artificial and Natural, with Additions,’ 8vo, London, 1837. On his return to Madras on 13 December 1837 he was appointed to the command of the Madras sappers and miners, but remained at Madras on special duty. On 20 March 1838 he was appointed to the first division of the public works department, comprising the districts of Ganjam, Rajamandry, and Vizagapatam, and on 24 April he took charge of the office of the chief engineer. He served on a committee to inspect and report upon the state of the Red-hill railroad and canal, and he surveyed the Ennore and Pulicat lakes, to ascertain the practicability and cost of keeping open the bar of the Kuam river by artificially closing that of the Ennore river; thereby the whole of the waters collected in the Pulicat lake would be turned into the Kuam, a measure which he considered would afford peculiar facilities for cleansing the Black Town, besides improving the water communication between Madras and Sulurpet. Meanwhile, he superintended the erection of the Madras lighthouse, which was begun in 1838 and completed in 1839. On 5 April 1839 Smith was appointed to the sixth division of the public works department, and on 7 May to officiate as superintending engineer at Madras.\nOn 24 September 1839 Smith was relieved from all other duties to enable him to inspect and report upon the machinery of the mint at Madras. On 7 February 1840, the date of the re-establishment of the mint, Smith was appointed mint-master, and by a thorough reformation of the whole establishment soon brought the mint into a high state of efficiency. The satisfactory results obtained by Smith's skilful adaptation to steam power of the old and simple mint machinery driven by animal power were referred to in a financial despatch of 16 March 1841 to the court of directors as highly creditable. On 13 January 1846 he visited the Cape of Good Hope on leave of absence, returning to the mint on 28 December 1847. An innovation which Smith introduced of adjusting the weights of the blanks by means of the diameters of the pieces, instead of by their thickness, resulted in his design of a very ingenious and beautiful machine, by which twenty or a hundred blanks could be weighed to half a grain and deposited in a separate cell by a single person with two motions of the hand. After the pieces had been thus sorted they were passed through a set of circular cutters, which removed a certain weight according to the excess of each over the standard. By this means almost the whole of the blanks were obtained of the exact weight without further correction. This machine gained an award at the London International Exhibition of 1851.\nSmith was promoted to be major on 2 March 1852, and lieutenant-colonel on 1 August 1854. About this time he made some ingenious inventions, which he proposed to apply to the demolition of Cronstadt; and he also invented a refracting sight for rifles. On 21 Septrember 1855 he was appointed mint-master at Calcutta. The following year he went to England to arrange about copper machinery for the mint, and did not go back, retiring on a pension, with the honorary rank of colonel, on 23 October 1857. After his return to England he devoted himself to currency problems, and favoured the introduction of a gold standard into India. He was deputed to attend the international monetary congress held in Paris in 1865, besides taking active part in the proceedings of many learned societies.\nSmith was for a long time consulting engineer to the Madras Irrigation Company; he was also a director of the Delhi bank and of the Madras Railway Company, of which he was for some years chairman. On 17 May 1866 he was appointed a member of the consulting committee, military fund department, at the India office, which post he held until the committee was abolished on 1 April 1880. He died at his residence, 10 Gledhow Gardens, London, on 14 May 1882. Sir Arthur Cotton observes of him: ‘He was one of the most talented, laborious, clear-headed, and sound-judging men I have ever met with, or known of by other means.’ He married, on 27 June 1837, Maria Sarah, daughter of R. Tyser, M.D., by whom he had five sons (for the eldest of whom see below) and eight daughters. A portrait was in possession of his daughter-in-law, Mrs. Percy Smith.\nSmith, who was a member of many learned bodies, was author of:\n\n‘Observations on the Management of Mints,’ 8vo, Madras, 1848.\n‘Observations on the Duties and Responsibilities involved in the Management of Mints,’ 8vo, London, 1848.\n‘Report on the Madras Military Fund, containing New Tables of Mortality, Marriage, &c., deduced from the Fifty Years' Experience, 1808–1858,’ by Smith, in conjunction with S. Brown and P. Hardy.\n‘Remarks on a Gold Currency for India, and Proposal of Measures for the Introduction of the British Sovereign,’ 8vo, London, 1868.\n‘Silver and the Indian Exchanges,’ 8vo, London, 1880.\nSmith initiated the ‘Professional Papers of the Madras Engineers,’ and edited vols. i. ii. and iii. of ‘Reports, Correspondence, and Original Papers on various Professional Subjects connected with the Duties of the Corps of Engineers, Madras Presidency’ (4to, Madras, printed between 1845 and 1855; the third edition of the first four volumes was printed at the American Press, Madras, in 1859). Smith contributed to these volumes many papers, mainly on mintage and lighthouse construction.\nThe eldest son, Percy Guillemard Llewellin Smith was an officer in the Royal Engineers.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Vetch, Robert Hamilton (1898). \"Smith, John Thomas (1805-1882)\".

        "content": "Daniel George Robinson (8 March 1826 – 27 July 1877) was a British colonel in the Royal Engineers and the director-general of telegraphs in India.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nRobinson was born 8 March 1826, and entered the military college of the East India Company at Addiscombe in 1841. He was appointed a second lieutenant in the Bengal engineers on 9 June 1843, and, after going through the usual course of instruction at Chatham, embarked for India in 1845. He arrived in time to join Sir Hugh Gough's army and take part in the Sutlaj campaign. He was engaged in the battle of Sobraon, and received the war medal. He was promoted first lieutenant on 16 June 1847. In 1848 and 1849 Robinson served in the Panjab campaign, and took part in the battles of Chillianwallah, 13 January 1849, and Gujerát, 21 February 1849, again receiving the war medal. In 1850 he was appointed to the Indian survey, upon which he achieved a great reputation for the beauty and exactitude of his maps. His maps of the Rawal Pindi and of the Gwalior country may be specially mentioned. He received the thanks of the government for his book, and the surveyor-general of India observed: ‘I have no hesitation in saying that these maps will stand in the first rank of topographical achievements in India, and I can conceive nothing superior to them executed in any country.’ On 21 November 1856 Robinson was promoted captain, and on 31 Deember 1862 lieutenant-colonel.\nIn 1865 Robinson was appointed director-general of Indian telegraphs. He entered on his duties at a critical time in the development of telegraphs. During the twelve years he was at the head of the department, the telegraphs, from a small beginning, spread over India, and were connected by overland and submarine lines with England. His zeal and activity, joined to great capacity for administration and organisation, enabled him to place the Indian telegraph department on a thoroughly efficient footing, and the lines erected were executed in the most solid manner. He took a leading part in the deliberations of the commission at Berne in 1871, and of the international conferences at Rome and St. Petersburg, on telegraphic communication. He was promoted to be brevet-colonel on 31 December 1867, and regimental colonel on 1 April 1874. He died on his way home from India on board the Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamer Travancore, at sea, on 27 July 1877.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Vetch, Robert Hamilton (1897). \"Robinson, Daniel George\".

They acquired modest local taxation and spending functions in the 19th century before being superseded by the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898.\n\n\n== History and etymology ==\n\nThe Ó Floinn were the ancient chiefs of the territory of Uí Baghamna (Uí Badamna). Parts of the region were part of the ancient land of Corcu Loígde. Abbeymahon Abbey was also called the monastery of Uí Badamna.\nThe Ó Cobhthaigh clan had seven castles on the coast and were lords of a region called Triocha Meona. The Ó Cuileannáin family also had land in Ibane, while the O'Fehilly of Tuatha O Fitcheallaigh were rulers of west Barryroe and the Ardfield parish.\nBarryroe is named for the Barry Roe (\"Red Barrys\") sept of the Anglo-Norman De Barry family. The name \"Ibane and Barryroe\" is misleading as it implies two separate regions, when it is actually a single area, before the Norman invasion \"Ibane\" and after that \"Barryroe.\"\nThe 1340 Book of Ballymote mentions that the Corco Laige Cuil are descended from Mac Niad, son of Lugdach; the descendants of his son Eocho became the Hui Badamna (Ibane).\nIt was a holdout of the Irish language; the 1871 census showed Ibane and Barryroe with 59% Irish speakers, the highest rate in County Cork.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nIbane and Barryroe is located in the south of County Cork, comprising two chunks of coastal land either side of Clonakilty.. \n\n\n== List of settlements ==\nSettlements within the historical barony of Ibane and Barryroe include: \n\nCastlefreke\nCourtmacsherry\nTimoleague\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of townlands of the barony of Ibane and Barryroe\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "On 11 April 2024, at 4:00 AM, a 21-year-old Chinese male gamer known as \"Fat Cat\" (simplified Chinese: 胖猫; traditional Chinese: 胖貓; pinyin: Pàngmāo) committed suicide by jumping off the Shibanpo Yangtze River Bridge after transferring RMB 66,000 (US$9,000 at the time) to his girlfriend, who wanted to break up with him. The incident gained widespread media attention the following month, especially in Southeast Asian countries. The incident has been called the Fat Cat Jumps into the River Incident (胖猫跳江事件), the Fat Cat Tan Zhu Incident (胖猫谭竹事件) and the 11 April Chongqing Young Man Jumps into the River Incident (4·11重庆男生跳江事件).\n\n\n== Background ==\nFat Cat, whose real name is Liu Jie (simplified Chinese: 刘杰; traditional Chinese: 劉傑; pinyin: Liú Jié), was born in Hunan Province in 2003. In 2022, he met Tan Zhu (born 1997 in Chongqing) through the mobile game Honor of Kings. Tan Zhu repeatedly requested money transfers from Fat Cat under various pretenses. Fat Cat's primary source of income was playing the game for others (\"game boosting\"). According to chat logs, Fat Cat and Tan Zhu had agreed to marry in May 2024. However, in April 2024, Tan Zhu broke up with Fat Cat, saying that he \"could not provide her with emotional value\". Determined to salvage the relationship, Fat Cat traveled from Hunan to Chongqing, but Tan Zhu refused his suggestion of cohabitation. Fat Cat then transferred his remaining RMB 66,000 (US$9,000 at the time) to Tan Zhu and jumped off the Shibanpo Yangtze River Bridge in Chongqing. According to Fat Cat's family, he had transferred a total of RMB 510,000 to Tan Zhu online over the course of two years.\n\nFat Cat's body was found 12 days later. Following the incident, Tan Zhu publicly apologized for her actions and expressed regret. She also denied the claim that Fat Cat had transferred RMB 510,000 to her. In the aftermath of the incident, Tan Zhu reached an agreement with Fat Cat's father to pay RMB 130,000 in compensation. However, upon recalculating the total amount transferred between the two, Fat Cat's sister discovered that the actual figure was RMB 510,000. She subsequently posted a video online exposing the discrepancy, bringing the incident to widespread public attention. Fat Cat's body was cremated on 3 May 2024.\n\n\n== Aftermath and condolences ==\nIn early May, the \"Fat Cat incident\" was the top trending search topic on Weibo's hot search list. \nAround 3 May 2024, many Chongqing residents began gathering at the Shibanpo Yangtze River Bridge to pay their respects to Fat Cat. They placed flowers, McDonald's meals, and bubble tea at the site, inspired by Fat Cat's profile picture that read, \"I don't want vegetables, I want McDonald's.\" The quote is believed to be his last wish and the last frame in his WeChat profile picture. On the evening of May 3, Fat Cat's sister, concerned about the growing congestion and disruption to traffic, took to live streaming to urge netizens to refrain from ordering takeout to the bridge. The Beijing News stated that using food to commemorate the deceased was \"wrong\" and \"wasteful,\" instead urging people to commemorate the victims solely with flowers on the bridge.\nMany netizens who had ordered takeout to be delivered to the Chongqing Yangtze River Bridge in his memory found that the packages were empty, containing no food. In some cases, bubble tea was replaced with plain water, sparking outrage among netizens. In response to the public outcry, five brands involved in the incident—ChaPanda, Mixue Ice Cream & Tea, Wallace, NewYoBo, and Zhu Xiaoxiao Snail Noodle—issued apologies. They announced various punitive measures against the offending stores, including temporary closure, suspension of operations, and termination of contracts. Additionally, they pledged to fully refund the affected orders and provide 10 times the amount as compensation. Furthermore, ChaPanda and Wallace announced the dismissal of the employees involved in the incident. ChaPanda also made a RMB 1 million donation to the Sichuan Youth Development Foundation in Fat Cat's name.\nAccording to VnExpress, McDonald's Vietnam launched a new slogan: \"If you don't like vegetables, eat chicken with BBQ cheese.\" This slogan has aroused great anger among netizens, and many people have criticized the chain store for being \"cold-blooded\" and \"immoral.\" Vietnamese netizens expressed outrage at the slogan and called for a boycott of the brand. McDonald's later realized the gaffe and posted an apology on its Facebook page.\nAmidst a wave of online outrage, Tan Zhu issued an apology through two videos on the evening of May 4. She expressed her deep regret and sorrow over the passing of Fat Cat. She revealed that she had told Fat Cat that she wanted to break up to test whether he still loved her.\n\n\"I truly regret it, Fat Cat; I didn't cherish you properly. Now I just want to make amends. Can you come back? I'm truly sorry for disappointing you.\"\nHowever, Tan Zhu's apology was not recognized by netizens. Many netizens felt that her apology lacked sincerity and remorse, viewing it as a temporary measure to escape public pressure.  Some netizens even expressed outrage at Tan Zhu's attire in the apology video.\nFriends of Tan Zhu have revealed that she had previously admitted to liking girls and had broken up with Fat Cat in April of last year. However, they continued their relationship because Fat Cat continued to send her money.\nThe incident quickly sparked online discussions in China about the loss of life values and goals among young people, as well as the lack of conscience and moral bottom line in society. Some netizens also believe that the authorities are trying to use the \"Fat Cat\" incident to divert public attention from the recent collapse of the collapse of the Melong Expressway in Guangdong, which caused significant casualties.\nAfter news of the incident broke, numerous social media accounts circulated images accompanied by sorrowful commentary purportedly depicting Fat Cat. However, it was later revealed that these images were not of Fat Cat but of a teacher named Yang Ruo, who operates the Douyin account under the same name. Based in Guangxi, Yang Ruo creates educational content related to his teaching profession. The mix-up led to unfortunate misunderstandings for Yang Ruo, prompting criticism on social media platforms. Yang Ruo clarified that he is not acquainted with Fat Cat and has no connection to his story.\nMany netizens have compared this incident with the Suicide of Su Xiangmao, expressing regret for the Fat Cat and accusing Tan Zhu of PUAing Fat Cat. Tan Zhu has continued to face heightened scrutiny and criticism online, with many asserting she \"digs mines\" and deceives and manipulates others' emotions.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

Rehman also worked as a correspondent for Kyodo News Agency, a Japanese news organization, and contributed to Nucleonics Week, a publication focused on the nuclear industry and proliferation issues. Kyodo recognized his coverage of the September 11, 2001 attacks and his 2005 interview with then-President of Pakistan, Pervez Musharraf, regarding the transfer of nuclear technology to North Korea by Pakistani nuclear scientist A.Q. Khan.\nRehman authored multiple books including, Who Owns Pakistan, a study on wealth concentration in Pakistan, published in May 1998, and Long Road to Chagai, a history of Pakistan's nuclear program, released in May 1999. He also contributed to various publications, including McGraw Hill, Asia Week, North-South News Agency, and the International Herald Tribune.\nAlong with fellow journalist Ziauddin, Rehman played a role in establishing the Senior Journalists' Forum in Islamabad, which held meetings at the National Press Club library. However, following the deaths of Rehman and Ziauddin, the Forum's activities diminished.\nRehman died in April 2020 at the age of 74 while working on his book Pakistan: The Reckoning Begins.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nWho Owns Pakistan (1998)\nThe Long Road to Chagai (1999)\nPakistan Sovereignty Lost (2006)\nPakistan: The Reckoning Begins (2024)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Halevi Monastery (Greek: Μονή Χαλεβή), also spelled as Chalevi, is an abandoned 16th-century monastery located near the village of Chromonastiri, Rethymno regional unit in north-central Crete. The monastery stands on a hill, about 5 km south of the city of Rethymno. It ceased to function as a monastery near the end of the Ottoman occupation of Crete and currently only its principal church remains.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Halevi monastery was founded in the 16th century when Crete was under Venetian rule and soon became stavropegic, i.e. directly answerable to the Patriarch of Constantinople. The monastery was erected upon the ruins of an old fortified establishment. It was dissolved around 1900 and latter became a metochion of Arsani Monasteri. In 1980, it was listed as a preserved monument by the Greek state and in 1991 the convent was attached to the restored monastery of Agia Irini.\nToday, the Halevi monastery is deserted and its buildings are in ruins. Only the single-aisled principal church (katholikon) of Theotokos is standing, known for its magnificent teardrop-shaped windows. Among the vestiges of the buildings, elements of the popular Cretan architecture of past centuries can be seen. The church celebrates on August 15 each year, attracting large numbers of people.\n\n\n== Current status ==\nAccording to an inscription, the katholikon church of Halevi was reconstructed in 1864. Today, it is awaiting restoration.\n\n\n== External links ==\nΙερά Mονή Παναγίας Xαλεβή, Ι.Μ. Ρεθύμνης και Αυλοποτάμου\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Hippocampus Well (Danish: Havhestebrønden) is a fountain by Niels Skovgaard, carved in stone in the shape of a Hippocampus. Originally installed on Kultorvet in Copenhagen, it has now been moved to the central courtyard of the Danish Design Museum on Bredgade. A plaster model  is on display in Vejen Art Museum.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe fountain was created as Niels Skovgaard's submission to a competition for a new fountain on Vesterbros Torv in Copenhagen. Elijah's Church was inaugurated on the square in April  1906. At its meeting on 20 May 1908, Foreningen til Hovedstadens Forskønnelse decided to launch a competition for the design of a fountain for the \"new square\". The three other artists who were invited to participate in the competition were Rasmus Harboe, Hans Tegner and J. F. Willumsen. The deadline for submissions of their proposals were already in July the same year. Hans Tegner did not submit a proposal. Willumsens proposal was believed to require too much water. The board of the association did not have a clear favourite between Skovgaard's and Harboe's proposals. It was initially decided to install 1;1 models of both works on the square but Skovgaard was unable to meet the deadline and Harboe's proposal was therefore selected as the winner.\nThe architect Hans Henrik Koch had been strongly in favour of Skovgaard's proposal. In November 1910, at a board meeting in Fonden til Kunstneriske Formaals Fremme, he proposed that it should be installed in another location. It was ultimately decided to install it on Kultorvet. It was unveiled in August 1916. The greenish stone from Norway soon turned out to be badly affected by the weather. In 1923 the fountain was therefore moved to a more protected location in the courtyard of the Danish Museum of Arts & Crafts.\n\n\n== Other versions ==\n\nA plaster model from 1908 was acquired by the Ny Carlsberg Foundation in 1943. It is in the collection of Sorø Art Museum.\nA 1:1 plaster model was put on storage in  Christiansborg Palace. In 1996, the severely damaged model was transferred to Vejen Art Museum. It was subsequently restored and is now on display in the museum's Skibbelund Hall. Om April 2004, Bejen Kunstmuseum bought another plaster model of the work (19.2 × 18.8 × 28.2 cm) at auction. A stoneware version is located in a private garden.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVintage photo of the fountain on Kultorvet",

        "content": "Kiswahili is one of the ten most popular and widely spoken languages on the African continent that owes its origin from the ethnic Bantu languages around East Africa\" These words were said by UNESCO Director general in his statement for the World's Swahili Language Day (July 7, 2023).\nIn 2024, The African Union adopted Swahili as one of its official working languages. The step followed other achievements that Swahili language has made: becoming one of the official languages of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the East African Community (E. A. C). These adoptions show the importance and dignity of the language.\n\nDespite the growth, maturity and dignity earned by Swahili, its stakeholders have revealed that the language is facing multiple challenges. In their article written in Swahili titled (translated), Kiswahili becomes an official AU language: what opportunities this unveils to its speakers?  the London based broadcasting corporation's wing, BBC Swahili  cautions, kuna haja ya tahadhari (Swahili for 'precaution is needed')  The radio station's article topples in the following list of challenges faced by the language\n\nSome of the Swahili speakers and journalists replace original Swahili words/terminologies with unnatural ones. Onni Sigalla, BAKITA Senior Editor, corrected the community of sports journalists via Clouds FM radio that they have always been wrong with their favourite expression kupata matokeo (' getting results ') while what they intend to say is 'winning the game'. Their influence is so far reaching that the majority of Tanzanians follow them. Unfortunately, the influence is not in favor of Kiswahili's health \n\nDoctor Nasra Habibu of the Department of Linguistics and Literary Studies of the Open University of Tanzania in her contribution to \"The 4th International Symposium of Swahili Broadcasting Stations\"  offers examples whereby Swahili speakers have been misusing some words either by lack of knowledge of their proper meanings or through sheer recklessness. For example, the wrong usage of the word 'sura' in place of the word 'uso'. Sura denotes the morphology of the organs on one's face (thus, is it ugly, handsome or beautiful?), while uso simply means 'face'. If someone would feel so ashamed following an event, he/she might regretfully say, nitauficha wapi uso wangu (where shall I hide my face); NOT, nitaificha wapi sura yangu (where shall I hide my looks). Another example is the use of the word binti (daughter) in place of the word msichana (girl). It's not correct because not every daughter is a girl and not every girl is a daughter of the speaker.\n\nEntry 29 in Scribd.com ' Swahili Proverbs ', offers a good example of distorted meaning of a proverb. Kufa kufaana has a figurative meaning of: ' in times of need the community comes together ' (relatives and neighbors helping the deceased family). However, the Swahili people of today take it to mean 'a demise leaves behind plenty of opportunities' (as confirmed by Scribd.com (a near literal translation which yields a tit for tat tone). Again, some sayings have their original morphology (phrasing) being changed. For example, mali bila daftari hupotea bila habari (unrecorded wealth will be lost unnoticeably), is now phrased as mali bila daftari hupungua bila habari (unrecorded wealth will decrease unnoticeably). Daftari (a book) insists on the recording to keep track of movement of the wealth, not to curb a decline \n\n\" Mtindo wa kuondolewa maneno asilia na kuwekwa maneno mengine kwa sababu ya utashi wa watu au wa kisiasa tu ni dosari kubwa inayotishia uimara wa lugha ya Kiswahili \" - Mohammed Abdulrahman.\n'The tendency of replacing the original words with other words because of personal will or mere political motivation is huge flaw that endangers the firmness of Swahili' - Mohammed Abdulrahman.\nAbdurahman (a retired BBC Swahili presenter) wrote the statement in the article Kiswahili becomes an official AU language: What opportunities this unveils to its speakers? criticizing the undue replacement of words. Neno la siri is a natural equivalent to \"pass word\" but BAKITA  officials announced the unpopular nywila as a replacing term. In 2023, while paying visits to radio stations such as Radio One and TBC, an official told listeners in a live broadcast that it's wrong to say \"bahati mbaya\" (bad luck) because 'bahati' (luck) can never be a bad thing. The officer proceeded by saying, \"substitute the expression bahati mbaya for isivyo bahati, which is a queer equivalent to 'unlucky' or 'unfortunate'. The expression bahati mbaya and its equivalents in other languages, have same idiomatic meaning. They are not to be literally examined.\nThe foreign language equivalents to bahati mbaya (which happen to take the 2 word phraseology as bahati mbaya itself) are provided by Google Translate as: English _ bad luck, French _ mal chance, Luganda _ emikisa emibi, Lingala _ makila mabe/ chance ya mabe, Espanol _ mala suerte, Portuguese _ mà sorte and Arabic _ Haza sayi\n\nThey are not to be referred to as unskilled for they are journalists with insufficient degree of proficiency in Swahili. Doctor Kamfipo Gidion, lecturer at the University of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, tried to examine the challenge more closely and revealed the underlying factors in his paper named Kiswahili language deficiencies in print media In the article, Kamfipo reveals the use of in-depth interviews as insufficient for employing editors and reporters for Swahili newspapers. They can  enact on-the-job training policies aimed at fostering mastery in Swahili. Remedies proposed by other sources have a projected outcome of promoting and developing the language.\nFree content creation by writers who display their content via various platforms on the internet such as social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, TikTok, Threads, Reddit, etc.), websites, blogs, and the like also affect Swahili. Content creation and display on such platforms don't have to go through formal scrutiny of any editor. Any error or discrepancy affecting Kiswahili go unchecked through to the audience. Such errors and discrepancies include  misspellings, mispronunciation, misuses and other linguistic noises affecting the literature and grammatical structures of Swahili.\nThe concerns which have been raised about misuse, abuse and misconceptions relating to various aspects of Swahili, mean that Swahili language stakeholders have a work to do: strategizing to overcome the challenges facing the language and the formulated strategies should be both; preventive and curative.",

        "content": "Sodium chlorodifluoroacetate is the organofluorine compound with the formula CF2ClCO2Na.  It is a salt formed by neutralization of chlorodifluoroacetic acid with sodium hydroxide.  The compound, a white solid, is of interest as a source of difluorocarbene:\n\nCF2ClCO2Na   →   NaCl  +  CF2  +  CO2\nThis reaction is conducted in a hot solution also containing the substrate. Diglyme is a typical solvent. The conversion of sodium chlorodifluoroacetate is proposed to start with decarboxylation, which generates the carbanion ClF2C−.\nOne set of applications is difluorocyclopropanation.  Thermal decomposition of sodium chlorodifluoroacetate in the presence of triphenylphosphine and an aldehyde allows for a Wittig-like reactions  In this case, (C6H5)3P=CF2 is proposed as an intermediate.\n\n\n== References ==",

The Merrys were the Irish noble family, originally from County Waterford, that settled in Seville in the 18th century. Those of the Val were a noble lineage from the Kingdom of Aragon, originally from Zaragoza.\nThe parents of the 1st Marquess were Sofía Josefa de Zulueta (1839–1925), and Rafael Carlos Merry del Val (1831–1917), a career diplomat who served as the Spanish Ambassador to Belgium, to the Holy See, and Minister at the Imperial Court of Vienna, and Gentlemen of the Bedchamber to Queen Elizabeth II and Kings Alfonso XII and Alfonso XII. The 1st Marquess served as Spanish Ambassador to the United Kingdom from 1913 until 1931. The younger brother of the 1st Marquess was Rafael Merry del Val (1865–1930), who became Cardinal Secretary of State to Pope Pius X. The 2nd Marquess served as the Spanish Ambassador to the United States, among other countries. As the 2nd Marquess died without issue, he was succeeded by his nephew, Rafael Merry del Val y Melgarajeo, son of the 2nd Marquess's younger brother Pablo, whose children inherited the title Count of Valle de San Juan.\n\n\n== Marquesses of Merry del Val (1925) ==\nAlfonso Merry del Val y de Zulueta, 1st Marquess of Merry del Val (1864–1943)\nAlfonso Merry del Val y Alzola, 2nd Marquess of Merry del Val (1903–1975)\nRafael Merry del Val y Melgarejo, 3rd Marquess of Merry del Val (d. 2004)\nRafael Merry del Val y Roca de Togores, 4th Marquess of Merry del Val (b. 1964)\n\n\n== Line of descent ==\n\n\n== References ==\nNotes\n\nSources\n\n\n== See also ==\nCount of Torre Díaz\nCount of Valle de San Juan",

There are two separate populations, both in Indonesia.\nThis frog has been found in paddy fields, perched on paddy plants, and on oil palm plantations. The frog has been observed between 191 and 400 meters above sea level.\nThe species' breeding habits have yet to be observed, but scientists presume they lay eggs in streams and grow through larval development, like other frogs in Chirixalus.\nThe IUCN classifies this frog as endangered because of its small range, which is undergoing continued degradation. Pesticides can also kill this frog.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Colonnade is a 14-storey mixed-use building in Toronto, Ontario. The building was conceived in 1959 by architect Gerald Robinson, whose design was influenced by the work of Le Corbusier. Construction began in 1961 and the building opened in the fall of 1963, though it was not completed until the spring of 1964. The building occupies a property owned by Victoria University that was leased in 1961 for 100 years. When it opened, the building contained stores, a theatre, offices, and apartments. The Colonnade is one of the earliest examples of brutalist architecture in Canada.\n\n\n== History and design ==\nIn 1959, architect Gerald Robinson (1930–) and engineer Irwin Burns (d. 2016) met at a Toronto Film Society programme. The men had a coffee at the end of the evening and talked about the decline of cities and how to revitalise them. The following morning, a real estate developer named Murray Webber (d. 2008) telephoned Burns to tell him about a property on Bloor Street, owned by Victoria University, that was available for long-term lease and development. At noon that day, Burns went to Bloor to look at the property. By chance, he ran into Robinson on the street. As the two examined the property, Burns said, \"there is the place to demonstrate what we talked about last night.\"\nBurns and Webber formed a corporation called One Thirty One Bloor West Limited, of which Burns was the president and general manager. The corporation owned half the project, while the other half was owned by Arthur Minden (1910–1966). In Robinson's telling, \"the inspiration came from Burns, the respectability from Webber, and the money from Minden.\" The group's proposal won out over 25 other projects submitted to Victoria University for the site. Burns and Webber announced the project on 5 October 1961. The 100-year lease they acquired from Victoria was the largest ground lease in the city's history. The developers built The Colonnade in conjunction with Britannica House at 151 Bloor, which sits on the same parcel. Shortly after the project got underway, Minden sold his half-stake to the Rubin Corporation, which became Revenue Properties later.\nGerald Robinson served as architect for the project, while Wells and Tampold were the associate architects. Norbert Seethaler was the structural engineer, John Garay Associates were the mechanical engineers, and Ellard Wilson Associates were the electrical engineers. Sasaki-Strong Associates served as landscape architects.\nMayor Donald Summerville opened The Colonnade on 16 October 1963. At the time of the opening, the building was incomplete. Construction continued until April 1964.\n\nRobinson drew inspiration from the concept that Le Corbusier used in his Unité d'habitation projects. The main block of the structure sits on a 20-foot column grid, and is 16 bays long and three bays wide. The first three storeys form the base of the structure and terminate in arches below the fourth floor. An article in The Canadian Architect compared Robinson's treatment of the arches to those of a Gothic cathedral. On either side, a two-storey podium that is two bays deep extends from the main block. Both sides of the podium include semi-elliptical cutaways that form forecourts. In the front forecourt, a floating staircase leads to a terrace on the second floor deck.\nBelow ground there are two levels of parking. The three-storey base has shops at street level and on the second floor, while the third floor serves as a mechanical area. Originally, the second floor included a 190-seat theatre called the Colonnade Theatre. Previously, Burns had served as producer for the Arts Theatre Club. The first play to run at The Colonnade Theatre was Before Compiegne, which was written by Jack Winter and opened on 3 April 1964. The play was directed by George Luscombe of Toronto Workshop Productions.\nThe fourth and fifth floors of the main block were offices originally. Floors 6-13 are apartments, and two of the 13th floor units extend to the 14th floor penthouse. Both penthouse units include open terraces, one of which has a pool. When it opened, the 164 apartments ranged in price from $110 to $1,400 per month. Over the years, The Colonnade's residents included performers Jan Rubeš and Susan Douglas Rubeš, Simpsons chairman G. Allan Burton, lawyer Ronald Rolls, professor Thomas Howarth, judge Hugh Foster, member of parliament Marvin Gelber, and literary agent Beverley Slopen.\nRobinson believed The Colonnade should have served as a template for new downtown developments. He said, \"the whole city should be like this. [...] The principles we have used here will be needed in any downtown development if it is not to be dehumanized. Do you want something like Place Ville Marie where the great towers stand empty at night and the shops are below ground?\"\nThe Globe and Mail's architecture critic, Adele Freedman, wrote later that\n\nin the mid-sixties, when it opened, the Colonnade was Bloor Street. If you lived anywhere near, or even if you didn't, it became part of your life, somewhere that you could wind up or down depending on your mood. Along with Holt Renfrew across the street, the Lothian Mews and Cakemaster, all since relocated, the Colonnade spelled civilization. Toronto's urban chic entertained in the apartments, University of Toronto students drank expresso at the Jack and Jill, and various and sundry came to fondle the merchandise. When guests came to town, it was the place to take them for a gawk and squawk.\nA few years after The Colonnade was completed, Webber and Burns sold their half-share of the building to Revenue Properties, making the latter the outright owner. By the mid-1970s, the mixed-use concept it had pioneered had been repeated widely, thus reducing its uniqueness and prestige. In 1977, architects Jack and Raji Shukla designed a renovation. Revenue proposed to turn the apartments into a hotel in 1983, though after facing resistance from tenants, the plan was cancelled.  In the mid-1980s Henno Sillaste designed a renovation of the lobby. Architecture critic Christopher Hume of the Toronto Star wrote of the various renovations, \"sadly, the Colonnade was made over during the 1980s in the glitzy manner then in vogue. That meant a lot of shiny surfaces and metallic finishes, none of it appropriate to this gently brutalist structure.\"\nIn November 1983, The Colonnade was added to the city's heritage register.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Thomas Oldfield (21 June 1756 – 1799) was an English major in the Royal Marines.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nOldfield was the third son of Humphrey Oldfield, an officer in her majesty's marine forces. He was born at Stone, Staffordshire, on 21 June 1756. His mother was a daughter of Major-general Nicholls, of the Honourable East India Company's service. His father died in America shortly after the affair of Bunker's Hill. Oldfied accompanied his father to America in the autumn of 1774, or in the following spring. He served as a volunteer with the marine battalion at Bunker's Hill on 17 June 1775. In this action he was twice wounded, and his wrist was permanently injured. After the action Oldfield accepted a commission in a provincial corps -it is believed Tarleton's legion. In 1775 he took up a commission in the royal marines which was intended for his brother, although it was by an error made out in his name.\nOldfield, who did not join the marines until the close of the American war, served with the 83rd regiment at the siege of Charleston, South Carolinia, in 1780. He was promoted to a first lieutenancy in the royal marines on 16 April 1778, and, being distinguished by his intelligence and gallantry, was placed on the stall of the quartermaster-general's department. As deputy assistant-quartermaster-general he was attached to the headquarters of the Marquis (then Lord) Cornwallis and to lord Rawdon (afterwards Marquis of Hastings). He was constantly engaged under their immediate eye, and the repeatedly bore testimony to his zeal, gallantry, and ability. Oldfield was taken prisoner with Lord Cornwallis at the capitulation of Yorktown.\nAt the termination of the war Oldfield went to England, and was quartered at Portsmouth, when he purchased a small place in the parish of Westbourne. He named it Oldfield Lawn. In 1788 Oldfield went to the West Indies, returning in very bad health. In 1798 he was promoted captain, and again went to the West Indies in the Sceptre, 64 guns, Captain Dacres. In 1794 Oldfield commanded the royal marines landed from the squadron to co-operate with the army in the island of St. Domingo. Oldfield distinguished himself on every occasion that offered. In storming one of the enemy's works at Cape Nicholas mole, he was the first to enter it, and with his own hand struck the enemy's colours, which are now in possession of the family. He returned to England in the autumn of 1795 in precarious health.\nIn 1796 Oldfield was employed on the recruiting service at Manchester and Warrington. The following year he embarked on board the Theseus, 74 guns, and sailed to join the squadron under the orders of the Earl of Saincent of Cadiz. Upon the Theseus reaching her destination, she became the flagship of Horatio Nelson, then a rear-admiral. Oldfield was engaged in two bombardments of Cadiz in June 1797, in one of which he was wounded while in the host with the admiral.\nImmediately after the second bombardment he sailed in the Theseus, accompanied by a small squadron, for Teneriffe. In the pliant but unsuccessful attempt upon this island Oldfield commanded the force of royal marines which effected a landing from the squadron. His boat was swamped, but he swam to shore, and on landing received a contusion in the right knee. He materially contributed to the saving of the British detachment, whose temerity in attacking with so inferior a force was only equalled by the gallantry with which they carried the attack into execution. Its failure may be attributed to the loss of the cutter Fox, 10 guns, which was sunk by the enemy's fire, with a considerable part of the force destined for the enterprise. It was in this affair that Nelson lost his arm. In a private letter, written after the battle of the Nile, Oldfield said that \"it was by no means so severe as the affair at Teneriffe, or the second night of the bombardment of Cadiz.\"\nUntil the Theseus was detached to join Nelson (who had shifted his flag to the Vanguard, and gone in pursuit of the French squadron up the Mediterranean), Oldfield remaining with the fleet under the orders of the Earl of St. Vincent. At the battle of the Nile Oldfield was the senior officer of royal marines in the fleet, and obtained the rank of major for his services, his commission dating 7 October 1798. Oldfield relates in a private letter how, after the disappointment of not finding the French fleet at Alexandria, the Zealous made the signal at midday on 1 August that it was in the bay of Aboukir. At half-past three the French fleet was plainly seen, and an hour afterwards Nelson bade the Theseus go ahead of him. Oldfield in the Theseus was alongside the Guerrier at a quarter to seven o'clock, and having poured in a broadside which carried away her mainmast and mizzenmast, he passed on to the Sparticle and anchored abreast of her, the admiral anchoring on the other side ten minutes later. After the action Oldfield was sent with his marines on board the Tonnant, and from 1 to 14 August he only occasionally lay down on deck. Upwards of six hundred prisoners were on board, of whom 150 were wounded. Nelson sent word to Oldfield that nothing would give him greater pleasure than to serve him; but Oldfield replied that he wanted nothing.\nThe Theseus remained for some time at Gibraltar and Lisbon to repair damages. Early in the spring of 1799 she sailed to join Sir Sidney Smith off the coast of Syria, and Oldfield took part in the defence of St. Jean d'Acre. On 7 April, at daybreak, a sortie in three columns was made, Oldfield commanding the centre column, which was to penetrate to the entrance of the French mine. The French narrative of General Berthier, chef d'état-major of the French army in Egypt, relates how Oldfield's column advanced to the entrance of the mine and attacked like heroes ; how Oldfield's body was carried off by their grenadiers and brought to the French headquarters. He was dying when taken, and breathed his last before he reached headquarters. 'His sword,' says Berthier, 'to which he had done so much honour, was also honoured after his death. . . . He was buried among us, and he has carried with him to the grave the esteem of the French army.' His gallant conduct was eulogised in the official despatch of Sir Sidney Smith, and Napoleon, when on passage to St. Helena, spoke of Oldfield's gallantry to the marine officers on board the Northumberland.\nOldfield was of middle stature and dark complexion. He was of a social and generous disposition, and had a strong sense of religion. A tablet in his memory was erected in the garrison chapel at Portsmouth.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Vetch, Robert Hamilton (1895). \"Oldfield, Thomas (1755-1799)\".

        "content": "Ahmad Aramesh (1908 – October 20, 1973) was an Iranian politician, journalist, and pro-democracy activist. He served as the editor-in-chief of Bahram newspaper, director of Diplomat newspaper, and was a prominent member of the Iran Democratic Party.\n\n\n== Early Life and Career ==\nAramesh was born in 1908 into the Ashtari family in Yazd, a family of old accountants. At age 19, he began working as a teacher in the Yazd Education Department. A few years later, he moved to Tehran and studied at the American College of Tehran (later Alborz High School) while also working for the Railway Organization and briefly at the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in Abadan.\nHe went on to study political economy and rose through the ranks to become the head of accounting for northern ports, roads, and streets. In 1941, he was transferred to the Ministry of Trades and Crafts as the head of accounting. With the rise of Qavam al-Saltaneh's government in 1945, Aramesh was promoted to deputy minister of Commerce and Trades. He also served on the Supreme Economic Council, Supreme Labor Council, and in 1954 became a member of the supervisory board of the Plan Organization.\n\n\n== Political Activities ==\nAramesh became involved in politics through the Iran Democratic Party founded by Qavam al-Saltaneh in 1945 to counter the Tudeh Party and Azerbaijan Democratic Party. He took charge of the party's propaganda commission and later served as its secretary-general for a period.\nIn 1960, during Jafar Sharif-Emami's first cabinet, Aramesh was appointed advisory minister and managing director of the Planning and budget Organization. However, he soon exposed political and administrative corruption in the parliament, leading to his impeachment and imprisonment. The security apparatus falsely claimed he had opened fire on officers and was killed in retaliation.\n\n\n== Criticism of Foreign Influence ==\nAramesh was a vocal critic of American presence in Iran, which is believed to be one of the reasons for his eventual murder. He founded the \"Progressives\" group in 1955 and frequently questioned foreign influence in articles published in Tehran Mosavvar magazine. His writings also supported Palestinian rights and condemned the actions of American and British oil companies in the Middle East, provoking reactions from Prime Minister Manouchehr Eghbal, who tore up copies of the magazine in parliament.\n\n\n== Imprisonment and Later Life ==\nIn 1961, Aramesh was arrested but released due to lack of evidence. He continued criticizing the government, leading to the founding of the \"Committee of Iranian Republicans\" in 1965. The group questioned the 1953 coup and the Shah's rule, resulting in Aramesh's re-arrest after a military trial. He spent around seven years in prison, with the last three in solitary confinement.\nAfter his release in 1972, Aramesh lived briefly with his daughter before being forced to relocate to the Sina Hotel due to warnings from SAVAK, the intelligence agency. Rumors spread about his alleged moral issues and gambling debts, which his family denied.\n\n\n== Assassination ==\nOn October 20, 1973, Aramesh was killed in Farah (Laleh) Park in Tehran. Authorities claimed he was shot in a confrontation with officers after a meeting with a communist saboteur. However, it was widely believed that SAVAK assassinated him due to his pro-democracy activism and writings envisioning an Iranian Republic.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nAramesh's grave is located in section 7, row 53, number 30 of Tehran's Behesht-e Zahra cemetery. He is remembered as a devoted advocate for the Iranian people, fighting against oppression and injustice through his writings and political activities. His dream of an Iranian Republic remained unfulfilled during his lifetime but inspired later pro-democracy movements.\n\n\n== Resources ==",

Of this enrolled acreage, 5,000 acres are defined as shallow water wetlands, with water levels maintained by over 30 miles of landscaped levees.  The Wildlife Area also includes 1,300 acres of reconstructed tallgrass prairie.  With both water and upland dry parcels for habitat, the Wildlife Area has logged the sighting of more than 260 species of birds.  \nThe Nature Conservancy, which helped sponsor creation of the Wildlife Area in 2005, encourages visitation.  The parcel was further improved in 2016 by the construction of a headquarters office and Visitor Center, featuring a birders' observation deck and interpretive signage to enhance the birdwatching experience.  Nearby trails offer opportunities for hiking, including ADA-compliant paved trails with more signage.\n\n\n== References ==",

The book was reviewed by Dawn and The Nation. Previously, in the same year, he became the first person with a disability in Pakistan to receive certification as a Microsoft Associate.\nIn 2022, Alvi was named as the Pride of Pakistan by ISPR.\nIn January 2023, Alvi was selected as a Global Shaper, an initiative of the World Economic Forum. Two months later, he was appointed as the ambassador of the Pakistan Health Parliament.\nThe author of the 2023 comic book, Adventures of the Trail Master, features a character named Tray. The author, Haider, met Alvi while working on the illustration part of his book. The Language of Paradise, which chronicles Alvi's experiences living in a world of sounds he cannot hear, mirrors Tray's character, who is also deaf and mute, and communicates using sign language.\nIn 2024, Alvi wrote and starred in the film A Walk with God. The film explores themes of identity, faith, and individual life journeys.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ode to O is the second album by the OGJB Quartet, a collaborative ensemble named after the first letters of the musicians' first names, featuring saxophonist Oliver Lake, cornetist Graham Haynes, double bassist Joe Fonda, and drummer Barry Altschul. Named after the title track, a tribute to Ornette Coleman, it was recorded on June 7 and 8, 2019, at Sear Sound Studios in New York City, and was released in 2022 by TUM Records.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nIn a review for All About Jazz, John Sharpe wrote: \"one of the most striking traits is how much they sound like a band... This is an outfit which merits a longer run than it may get given the difficulty of getting the four principals together.\"\nWill Layman of PopMatters stated: \"If 'vintage' sometimes means seeming old-fashioned or left behind, then these gentlemen demonstrate that fresh thinking is possible at any age. They play here with an exquisite connection to each other and to music history.\"\nWriting for Burning Ambulance, Phil Freeman commented: \"The mere fact that there's a second album by this group makes me happy. They've got a unique sound, based entirely on the interplay between the four members' personalities... there's a significant distance between what each of them does in other contexts. So listening to them cross those spaces to find somewhere to meet is what makes this music interesting.\"\nThe Big Takeover's Michael Toland remarked: \"These veteran heavy hitters bring all of their talents to bear on Ode to O... It would be extremely difficult for these players to create bad music in the first place, but it's clear on Ode to O the extra inspiration they take from each other's presence.\"\nIn an article for The Quietus, Peter Margasak noted that the musicians have found \"a bracing freebop sweet spot together,\" and wrote: \"there's an abiding equanimity to the proceedings, imbuing the performances with grace regardless of how fiery things might get... The themes are elegant and memorable, elastic enough to support some fiery blowing and rhythmic dissection.\"\nDaniel Spicer of Jazzwise praised the title track, calling it \"a deceptively conventional hard-bop swinger with a big-grinned joie de vivre,\" as well as \"Da Bang\" (dedicated to Billy Bang), which \"bursts out of an extended solo drum intro with an irresistible bass vamp heavy enough to establish its own gravitational field. Serious fun.\"\nThe New York City Jazz Record's George Kanzler also singled out the title track, on which Altschul and Fonda \"mesh, expanding and contracting rhythms like images in a kaleidoscope, Lake and Haynes trading and jamming lines, cornet floating long notes, alto bobbing and weaving, pinching a note, arpeggiating a string of them.\"\nA writer for Glide Magazine stated: \"OGJB take in both a wide swath of sound and emotion as they journey into startling, ever-unpredictable territory.... the spirit of Coleman's free expression prevails throughout, as if to form a more contemporary but less direct version of the acclaimed quartet Old and New Dreams... who directly channeled Coleman's music.\"\nGary Chapin of The Free Jazz Collective commented: \"I'm not going to call it effortless, but there's an ease to the group that comes from their decades of experience and the naturalness of their musical relationships. To me, OGJB represents a great time in the past, and a great time in the present.\"\nJon Garelick of The Arts Fuse selected the album as one of the ten best jazz releases of 2022.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"Ode to O\" (Barry Altschul) – 6:52\n\"Justice\" (Oliver Lake) – 5:22\n\"Me without Bela\" (Joe Fonda) – 12:24\n\"Da Bang\" (Barry Altschul) – 9:06\n\"The Other Side\" (Graham Haynes) – 6:55\n\"Caring\" (Barry Altschul) – 4:56\n\"OGJB #3\" (Barry Altschul / Joe Fonda / Graham Haynes / Oliver Lake) – 3:53\n\"Bass Bottom\" (Oliver Lake) – 2:37\n\"OGJB #4\" (Barry Altschul / Joe Fonda / Graham Haynes / Oliver Lake) – 5:10\n\"Apaixonado\" (Graham Haynes) – 5:10\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nOliver Lake – alto saxophone\nGraham Haynes – cornet, electronics\nJoe Fonda – double bass\nBarry Altschul – drums, percussion\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Brazil Song (Cancões Do Brasil) is a studio album by Mark Murphy.\nBrazil Song (Cancões Do Brasil) is the 20th album by American jazz vocalist Mark Murphy. It was recorded when Murphy was 51 years old in 1983 and released by the Muse label in the United States in 1984. This album is collection of Brazilian jazz songs.\n\n\n== Background ==\nMark Murphy had a fondness for Brazilian songs. Murphy had recorded Brazilian music previously on Mark Murphy Sings (\"Empty Faces\"), Who Can I Turn To (\"Star Sounds\"), Midnight Mood (\"Sconsolato\"), and others. However, Brazil Song was Murphy's first all-Brazilian jazz album. He later released Night Mood in 1987 dedicated to Ivan Lins. He continued to record many Brazilian songs during his career, singing many of them in Portuguese. In his book A Biographical Guide to the Great Jazz and Pop Singers, Will Friedwald pointed out that Murphy dedicated his late nightclub sets to Brazilian rhythms in his Birdland engagements.\nAfter touring in 1982 Murphy spent two weeks in Rio. He absorbed the music and culture and collected recordings of Brazilian jazz. He was inspired to do an album devoted to the music. In the liner notes to Brazil Song, he told Michael Bloom, \"We've lost the great era of singer/songwriters and the Broadway stage. They write musicals but they don't write songs anymore - not songs you can take out and do as independent numbers. I don't hear much new material that knocks me out. So, the best songs now being written are coming from Brazil. It's almost as though they’ve written into the Brazilian Constitution that it is illegal to write a bad song”.\nAlso in the liner notes Murphy writes about his experience visiting a museum dedicated to Carmen Miranda \"who personally brought the Samba (her country's gift to popular music) to the USA and the world\". He had been a longtime fan of Miranda after seeing her movies. Murphy dedicated the album to her and to \"Elis Regina, the greatest of the contemporary Brazilian singers - who brought us so much joy and excitement and died much too soon\" who \"must be mentioned in this dedication as well, as must my two new favorite Brazilian lady singers. Rose and Leny Andrade\".\n\n\n== Recording ==\n\"No one asked me to make this album\", Murphy told Bloom in the liner notes. \"I did it because I thought that Brazilian songs were not being done correctly - that North American singers have not been able to capture the correct musical pulse of this music, mainly because of the Tin-Pan-Alleyish lyrics given to some of the tunes. The rhythmic pulse has a different timing; I think that's a quality inherent in the Portuguese language. So I try to sing the English lyrics as though they were Portuguese.\"\nThe recording was made with a San Francisco-based group, Viva Brasil, who Murphy found to be authentic interpreters of Brazilian songs. \"I knew I couldn't do this project with a pickup group,\" Murphy explained to Bloom. \"I had to have a unit, musicians that knew each other well.\" Jay Wagner, Viva Brasil's keyboardist, did the arranging and played synthesizer. The other members included singer Julia Stewart, percussionist Michael Spiro, pianist Michael Austin-Boe, guitarist Claudio Amaral, and drummer Rubens Moura.\nMurphy sings \"Outubro\" in Portuguese, his first recording in Portuguese. Jones points out in his Murphy biography that many singers prefer original lyrics in Brazilian songs because the English versions tend to drastically change the original meaning. Murphy produced the album with Lupe De Leon, who had worked on Stolen Moments and would go on to produce Night Mood and September Ballads.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nScott Yanow assigns 3 stars to this release in the AllMusic Guide to Jazz.\nAuthour Will Friedwald said, “When it comes to the bossa nova, no other American jazz singer can touch Murphy”.\nMurphy biographer Peter Jones singles out \"Two Kites\", \"Nothing Will Be\", and \"Bridges\" for praise.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"Desafinado\" (Antônio Carlos Jobim, Newton Mendonça) – 4:02\n\"Two Kites\" (Jobim) – 3:36\n\"The Island\" (Ivan Lins, Vítor Martins) – 4:03\n\"Bolero De Satã\" (Paulo Cesar Pinheiro, Guinga) – 3:49\n\"She\" (Claudio Amaral) – 2:58\n\"Someone To Light Up My Life (Se Todos Fossem Iguais A Voce)\" (Jobim, Gene Lees, Vinicius de Moraes) – 2:57\n\"Nothing Will Be\" (Ronaldo Bastos, Milton Nascimento, Renee Vincent) – 3:57\n\"Outubro (October)\" (Nascimento, Fernando Brant) – 3:58\n\"Bridges\" (Brant, Lees, Nascimento) – 3:59\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nPerformance\nMark Murphy – vocals\nMichael Austin-Boe – piano\nClaudio Amaral – guitar\nRubens Moura – drums\nChalo Eduardo – percussion\nMichael Spiro – percussion\nJulia Stewart – vocals\nJay Wagner – synthesizer, arranger\n\nProduction\nJack Leahy – engineer, Russian Hill Recording, San Francisco, Ca.

        "content": "Colonel John Wilson (died 1865) was an American politician. He served as the Speaker of the House of the Arkansas House of Representatives from 1836 to 1837. He killed fellow representative Joseph J. Anthony in 1837, being acquitted but expelled from the House. He was later reelected in 1840. Wilson died in Texas in 1865.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nJohn Wilson represented Clark County at the constitutional convention to create the first constitution of Arkansas in 1836. He was elected as the president of the convention. He later represented Clark County in the Arkansas House of Representatives, serving as the Speaker of the House. On December 4, 1837, Wilson entered a knife fight with fellow representative Joseph J. Anthony after arguing with him about the Arkansas Real Estate Bank, which Wilson was the president of. Wilson won the knife fight and stabbed Anthony, killing him. He was arrested for the crime, with the trial occurring in May 1838. He was also expelled from the House on December 11, with Grandison Royston being chosen as the new Speaker.\nBefore the trial began, Wilson's lawyer, Chester Ashley, was able to argue that he could not have a fair trial in Pulaski County. The trial was moved and became the first murder trial held in Saline County. It concluded with Wilson being found guilty of excusable homicide and released. He was later re-elected to the Arkansas House in 1840 after moving to Pike County. In 1842, during a debate on the Real Estate Bank, Wilson became angry with another representative, this time Whig representative Lorenzo Gibson. However, other House members intervened and stopped a fight from occurring.\nLater in life, Wilson moved to the state of Texas. He ran for election to the Texas state legislature, but was unsuccessful. He died there in 1865.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLegislative violence\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "John Oldfield  (29 May 1789 – 2 August 1863) was an English general and colonel-commandant in the Royal Engineers.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nOldfield was the only son of John Nicholls Oldfield, lieutenant in the royal marines, who served with distinction on the staff of the army and with the 63rd regiment in the American war, and of Elizabeth, only daughter of Lieutenant Hammond of the royal navy. He was born at Portsmouth on 29 May 1789. He was descended from Sir Anthony Oldfield, created a baronet in 1660, and he claimed to be fifth baronet, but the proof was incomplete. A re-creation was deemed to be necessary, the cost of which Oldfield declined to incur, and the matter dropped. His father retired from the service about the date of Oldfield's birth, and purchased a small estate at Westbourne, Sussex. He died in 1793.\nIn 1799 Oldfield's uncle, Major Thomas Oldfield, of the royal marines, was killed at St. Jean d'Acre. The distinguished conduct of this officer led to offers from Lord St. Vincent, Lord Nelson, and Sir Sidney Smith to provide for John Oldfield in the navy, while Earl Spencer offered a commission in the royal marines, and the Marquis Cornwallis a nomination for the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich. The latter was accepted. When Oldfield was old enough to go to Woolwich, he was only four feet six inches high, and a dispensing order had to be obtained from the master-general of the ordnance to allow of his admission to the Royal Military Academy, the minimum standard being then four feet nine inches. The junior cadets at that time went first to Great Marlow, Buckinghamshire, where he joined, on 23 August 1803, and was afterwards transferred to Woolwich. When George III inspected the cadets on 29 May 1805, Oldfield was one of the seniors. The king was struck with his diminutive stature, asked his name and age, and spoke to the lad of his uncle's services at St. Jean d'Acre.\nOldfield joined the Trigonometrical Survey at Bodmin in Cornwall in September 1805. He was commissioned as second lieutenant in the royal engineers on 2 April 1806, and quartered at Portsmouth. He was promoted to be lieutenant on 1 July. The following summer he was sent to Halifax, Nova Scotia, and after two years' service in North America he returned to England, and in September 1809 was stationed at Dorchester. He was promoted second captain on 1 May 1811.\nFrom Dorchester he went to Fort George in Scotland, and remained there until he embarked for Holland in 1814. He landed at Hellevoetsluis on 28 March, and entered Antwerp with Sir Thomas Graham on 5 May. He was promoted captain on 26 January 1815. He was at Brussels on 7 April 1815, when he heard of Napoleon's escape from Elba, and at once packed his family off to England, to Westbourne. Oldfield was sent to Ypres to construct new works of defence, and was entrusted with the inundation of the country round, a troublesome and thankless operation. He shortly after joined the army of the Duke of Wellington as brigade-major of royal engineers. He made a sketch-plan of the plains of Waterloo for the use of the duke, and took part in the battle of Waterloo and the occupation of Paris. In April 1819, in consequence of a reduction in the corps of royal engineers, he was placed on half-pay, and passed his time chiefly at Westbourne.\nIn October 1823 he was sent on a special commission to the West Indies. He returned in 1824, and was quartered for some years in Ireland. On 23 July 1830 he was promoted brevet-major and made a K.H. for his services in 1815. In September he was appointed commanding royal engineer in Newfoundland. On 19 November 1831 he was promoted lieutenant-colonel. In October 1835 he returned to England, and was appointed to the command of the royal engineers at Jersey. In March 1839 he was sent to Canada as commanding royal engineer and colonel on the staff. He was there during the rebellion and rendered good service. On 9 November 1841 he was promoted colonel in the army, and appointed aide-de-camp to the queen. He returned from Canada in the spring of 1843, and was appointed commanding royal engineer in the western district. He was promoted regimental colonel on 9 November 1846, and was appointed to command the royal engineers in Ireland in 1848. On 20 June 1854 he was promoted major-general, and went to live at Westbourne. He became lieutenant-general on 10 May 1859. He was made a colonel-commandant of the corps of royal engineers on 25 October 1859, and was promoted general on 3 April 1862. He died at Emsworth on 2 August 1863, and was buried at Westbourne.\nOldfield was thrice married: first, on 12 March 1810, at Dorchester, to Mary, daughter of Christopher Ardens, esq., of Dorchester, Dorset, by whom he had seven children (she died at Le Mans, France, on 6 July 1820); secondly, on 8 July 1822, at Cheltenham, to Alicia, daughter of the Rev. T. Hume, rector of Arden, by whom he had eight children (she died at Plymouth on 5 February 1840); and, thirdly, on 12 March 1849, at Plymouth, to Cordelia Anne, daughter of the Rev. D. Yonge (she survived him). Oldfield's eldest son, John Rawdon, was a colonel in the Bengal engineers; Anthony, a captain in the royal artillery, was killed at Sebastopol; Rudolphus, a captain in the royal navy, C.B., and aide-de-camp to the queen, died on 6 February 1877; Richard was in the royal artillery, and was also a general officer. Oldfield contributed 'Memoranda on the Use of Asphalte' to the 'Professional Papers of the Corps of the Royal Engineers,' new ser. vols. iii. and v.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Vetch‎, Robert Hamilton (1895). \"Oldfield, John (1789-1863)\".

        "content": "\"Every Beat of My Heart\" is a song by English singer-songwriter Chris Rea released by Magnet on 7 May 1982 as the second and final single from his fourth studio album, Chris Rea. The song was written by Rea, and produced by Jon Kelly and Rea. It failed to reach the top 100 of the UK Singles Chart, but did reach number 129 in Record Business magazine's Bubbling Under Singles chart.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nUpon its release as a single, Denis Kilcommons of the Huddersfield Daily Examiner praised \"Every Beat of My Heart\" as a \"beautiful ballad\" which is \"immacuately performed\". The Mansfield & Sutton Recorder described it as an \"extremely powerful ballad that should put Chris in the charts\" and added, \"Undoubtedly he is one of the best singer/songwriters we have in this country today.\" The Runcorn Guardian called it a \"taste of Rea at his best\" and continued, \"This Geordie singer/songwriter produces consistently high quality sounds, but hitherto, has only received vicarious success for his work.\" Sunie of Record Mirror was negative in her review, noting that Rea \"husk[s] away on an Adult Orientated (i.e. Boring) ballad, and highly soporific it is too\". She continued, \"Not much to my taste, but of inestimable therapeutic value for insomnia sufferers.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n7–inch single (UK)\n\n\"Every Beat of My Heart\" – 3:20\n\"Don't Look Back\" – 3:44\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\"Every Beat of My Heart\"\n\nChris Rea – vocals, guitar\nMartin Kershaw – guitar\nSkaila Kanga – harp\nDavid Snell – harp\nSteve Lawrence – string bass\nAndrew Powell – string arrangement, conductor\nProduction\n\nJon Kelly – production, engineer\nChris Rea – production\nOther\n\nBrian Aris – cover photography\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

He was the ambassador to Greece (2008–2012) and to Serbia (2015–2019).\n\n\n== Biography ==\nFuertes Suárez was born in Oviedo, Asturias. His mother Eloína Suárez (1922–2024) was the city's first female mayor in 1978, while his father Alfonso Fuertes (died 1959) was a professor of law.\nAfter graduating in law, Fuertes Suárez entered the diplomatic profession in 1978. He was named the ambassador to Greece in 2008. In July 2011, when Greece blocked a Spanish non-governmental organisation's flotilla of aid to the Gaza Strip, members of the group Rumbo a Gaza criticised Fuertes Suárez's alleged indifference to the situation and organised an occupation of the embassy in Athens.\nFrom 2012, Fuertes Suárez was the consul general in Naples, Italy. In March 2015, he was named ambassador to Serbia. He shared the official Spanish position of non-recognition of the declaration of independence of Kosovo. Fuertes Suárez supported the accession of Serbia to the European Union.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Griffith George Lewis (10 November 1784 – 24 October 1859) was an English lieutenant-general and colonel-commandant in the Royal Engineers.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nLewis was born at Woolwich on 10 November 1784. He was educated privately and at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. On completing the course of study at the academy, he was sent with the next two senior cadets to the west of England to be instructed in surveying under Major William Mudge, before obtaining his commission in the Royal Engineers. He was gazetted second lieutenant on 15 March 1803, and lieutenant on 2 July the same year. After a year at Chatham he joined the Portsmouth command, and in May 1805 embarked with the expedition under Sir James Craig. He served for a time at Malta, and then took part in the campaign of Naples and Calabria. He was present at the battle of Maida on 4 July 1806, and after it joined Colonel Oswald's brigade in a projected attack on the castle of Scylla. They arrived before the place on the night of 11 July. Lewis and the English engineers laboured unceasingly in the construction of the siege batteries, from which fire was opened on the 21st. So great was the effect that on the following day the garrison capitulated. It consisted of some four hundred sappers and miners and artillerymen, being all the men of the technical corps of the Calabrian army, under Colonel Michel of the French engineers.\nLewis was promoted second captain on 18 November 1807. He served under Sir John Stuart at the capture of Ischia and Procida in the Bay of Naples in August 1809, and in the Ionian Islands under Sir John Oswald at the siege of Santa Maura in 1810. In February 1811 he returned to England, staying at Gibraltar on his way, and was stationed at Woolwich. On 10 July he embarked with the expedition for Sweden and the Danish island of Anhalt, and returning in September was sent to the eastern district. In December 1812 he embarked for Portugal, and was employed in throwing up the lines round Lisbon. In 1813 he served in the campaign in Spain under Wellington. He was promoted captain on 21 July 1813. At the siege of San Sebastian he was twice wounded, and in the assault of the breach on 25 July so severely, that his leg had to be amputated above the knee. He was mentioned in Lord Lynedoch's despatches as having distinguished himself by gallant conduct, and was promoted brevet major on 21 September for his services. The same month he returned to England invalided. After some time on the sick list he joined the army of occupation in France, and in the autumn of 1817 was employed on special service.\nOn 18 January 1819 he embarked for Newfoundland, where he served for some years. On 29 July 1825 he was promoted lieutenant-colonel. He returned to England on 18 September 1827. On 1 April 1828 he embarked for Canada to serve on a commission on the Rideau Canal, and came home again on 6 September. He was commanding royal engineer at Jersey from December 1830 till January 1836; at the Cape of Good Hope from March 1836 until the autumn of 1842; in Ireland from January 1843 to January 1847, and at Portsmouth from January 1847 till 3 April 1851. On 20 June 1838 he was promoted brevet colonel, and on 23 November 1841 regimental colonel. From April 1851 until July 1856 he was governor of the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich.\nHe was promoted to be major-general on 11 November 1851, and lieutenant-general on 12 August 1858, and was made a colonel commandant of the corps of Royal Engineers on 23 November 1858. He received the Peninsular war medal with two clasps (Maida and St. Sebastian), and was made a C.B. for his war services. He also received a pension of 200l. per annum for life for his wounds, and a distinguished service pension of 100l. per annum. He died at Brighton on 24 October 1859.\nOn 6 March 1821 Lewis married Miss Fanny Bland at St. John's, Newfoundland. Lewis was joint editor with Captain J. Williams of the ‘Professional Papers of the Corps of Royal Engineers,’ and of the ‘Corps Papers,’ from 1847 until 1854. He also contributed to them the following papers: quarto series, vol. vi. ‘Use of Fascines in forming Foundations;’ vol. vii. ‘Application of Forts, Towers, and Batteries to Coast Defence and Harbours;’ vol. ix. ‘On the Value of Fortresses;’ vol. x. ‘Memoir of Professional Life of Lieutenant-Colonel Brandreth, R.E.,’ ‘Defence of Country South of London,’ ‘Campaign of the Sutlej;’ octavo series, vol. i. ‘Observations on the Explosion of Mines at Seaford;’ vol. ii. ‘Description of Military Chapel at Dublin,’ ‘De la Défense Nationale en Angleterre;’ vol. iii. ‘Field Works for the Defence of Sicily in 1810;’ vol. iv. ‘Topographical Notes on the Seat of War in Turkey;’ vol. v. ‘Coast Defences;’ vol. vi. ‘Preponderance of Attack over Defence in Sieges;’ vol. vii. ‘Influence of Fortification upon Military Operations.’ ‘Corps Papers,’ No. 1, ‘Remarks on Casemates for Sea Batteries,’ ‘Drawbridges.’\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Vetch, Robert Hamilton (1893). \"Lewis, Griffith George\".

        "content": "Pre-Islamic Arabic poetry (or simply pre-Islamic poetry) refers to the corpus of Arabic poetry composed in pre-Islamic Arabia roughly between 540 and 620 AD.\nOne of the first major poets in the pre-Islamic era is Imru' al-Qais, the last king of the kingdom of Kinda. Although most of the poetry of that era was not preserved, what remains is well regarded as among the finest Arabic poetry to date. In addition to the eloquence and artistic value, pre-Islamic poetry constitutes a major source for classical Arabic language both in grammar and vocabulary, and as a reliable historical record of the political and cultural life of the time.\nPoetry held an important position in pre-Islamic society with the poet or sha'ir filling the role of historian, soothsayer and propagandist. Words in praise of the tribe (qit'ah) and lampoons denigrating other tribes (hija') seem to have been some of the most popular forms of early poetry. The sha'ir represented an individual tribe's prestige and importance in the Arabian peninsula, and mock battles in poetry or zajal would stand in lieu of real wars. 'Ukaz, a market town not far from Mecca, would play host to a regular poetry festival where the craft of the sha'irs would be exhibited.\nAlongside the sha'ir, and often as his poetic apprentice, was the rawi or reciter. The job of the rawi was to learn the poems by heart and to recite them with explanations and probably often with embellishments. This tradition allowed the transmission of these poetic works and the practice was later adopted by the huffaz for their memorisation of the Qur'an. At some periods there have been unbroken chains of illustrious poets, each one training a rawi as a bard to promote his verse, and then to take over from them and continue the poetic tradition. For example, Tufayl trained 'Awas ibn Hajar, 'Awas trained Zuhayr, Zuhayr trained his son Ka`b, Ka`b trained al-Hutay'ah, al-Hutay'ah trained Jamil Buthaynah and Jamil trained Kuthayyir `Azza.\n\n\n== Major collections ==\nThe five major collections of pre-Islamic Arabic poetry were made in the 8th and 9th centuries and are, alongside published editions and translations:\n\nThe Mu'allaqat (\"The Suspended Odes\" or \"The Hanging Poems\"), a group of seven long poems collected in the 8th century. It may have been collected by Hammad Ar-Rawiya.\nArberry, The Seven Odes: The First Chapter in Arabic Literature, Routledge, 1957. Available\nJohnson, Frank (ed.).

(ed.), Diwan 'Antarah ibn Shaddad: A Literary-Historical Study, Library of Arabic Literature, 2018.\n\n\n== Poets ==\nAmong the most famous poets of the pre-Islamic era are Imru' al-Qais, Samaw'al ibn 'Adiya, al-Nabigha, Tarafa, Zuhayr bin Abi Sulma, and Antarah ibn Shaddad. Other poets, such as Ta'abbata Sharran, al-Shanfara, Urwa ibn al-Ward, were known as su'luk or vagabond poets, much of whose works consisted of attacks on the rigidity of tribal life and praise of solitude.\n\n\n=== Jewish poets ===\nIslamic compilations of pre-Islamic poetry occasionally mention Jewish poets, although it is difficult to assess their authenticity and, compared to epigraphs, are more difficult to date and are subject to later influences of Islamicization. The Ṭabaqāt fuḥūl al-shuʿarā (\"The generations of the most outstanding poets\"), composed by the Basran traditionalist and philologist Muḥummad ibn Sallām al-Jumaḥī (d. 846), records a list of Jewish poets. The Arabian/Arab antiquities collector Abū l-Faraj al-Iṣfahānī (d. 976) also has scattered reference to eleven Jewish poets in his Kitāb al-agānī (\"Book of Songs\"). The poets they refer to are as follows, followed by (J) if mentioned by al-Jumahi and (I) if they are mentioned by al-Isfahani:\n\nSamaw'al ibn 'Adiya (J) (I)\nAl-Rabi ibn Abu al-Huqayq (J) (I)\nKa‘b ibn al-Ashraf (J) (I)\nShurayḥ ibn ʿImrān (J) (I)\nSaʿya (Shuʿba) ibn Gharīḍ/ʿArīḍ (J) (I)\nAbū Qays ibn Rifāʿa (J) (I)\nDirham ibn Zayd (J)\nAbū l-Dhayyāl (J) (I)\nSarah of Qurayẓa (I)\nKaʿb ibn Saʿd of Qurayẓa (I)\nAws ibn Danī of Qurayẓa (I)\nThe poetry ascribed to these figures rarely make reference to precise historical details or religious expressions, although some poems ascribed to al-Samaw'al in the Asma'iyyat collection are explicitly religious. In addition, al-Jumahi offers very little by way of biography for each of these figures other than to recount popular anecdotes that a few are associated with. Al-Isfahani gives more detailed biographical information. For example, he says Al-Samaw’al ibn ‘Ādiyā was a native of Tayma (in northwestern Arabia) whose father had ties to the Ghassanids. He lived in a family home often called a castle and whose name was al-Ablaq. Popular stories described his fidelity and loyalty, such as one where he refuses the surrender of the possessions of Imru' al-Qais to Imru's enemies despite their attempt to besiege his castle. Asides from Samaw'al, the only other Jewish poet to earn some renown was al-Rabī‘ ibn Abī l-Ḥuqayq, chief of the Naḍir tribe. The earliest sources make no mention of this figure, but only his son Kināna. Instead, it is only with the work of al-Isfahani that the exploits of al-Rabī‘ are described.\n\n\n== Authenticity ==\nInitial rejection of the authenticity of the corpus of pre-Islamic poetry came in the early 20th century, from a paper by D.S. Margoliouth in 1925 and the book On Pre-Islamic Poetry by Taha Husayn in 1926. Use of pre-Islamic poetry in the field of Quranic studies also declined compared to earlier eras after the skeptical turn of the field in the 1970s, a trend lamented by a number of relevant experts. Most work from previous decades on the poetry as a source is now obsolete, however. Margoliouth argued the monotheism of the poetry was out of place, but archaeological findings have since shown monotheism was widespread in pre-Islamic Arabia, contrary to later representations. Margoliouth also relied on the assumption that authentic pre-Islamic poetry would need to share the dialect of the Quran, which is no longer accepted. \nEarly responses to sweeping rejections of the authenticity of pre-Islamic poetry came from Arafat and, in recent decades, historians have retreated from blanket skepticism of these poems, viewing the majority of them as potentially pre-Islamic in origin. A recent study of the toponyms mentioned in pre-Islamic poetry suggests that they refer to real places, but that these places were also unknown in later periods, indicating that they originate in periods at least a few generations prior to their compilation into the major poetry collections when knowledge of these place-names had not yet been lost. The grammatical forms of the archaic place names also indicates that the transmission of pre-Islamic Arabic poetry was in written form, as opposed to oral form, from an earlier period than previously assumed, at least by the last 1st century AH. Another investigation indicates the general authenticity of the corpus with respect to how it trats the rite of Hajj. References to Hajj in pre-Islamic poetry are relatively few, especially in comparison to the number of references in Muslim-era poetry, and are concentrated among poets living in and near Mecca but largely absent from the poetry of authors from northern and eastern Arabia (contrasting Islamic-era histories which conceived of the Hajj as a pan-Arabian ritual of pre-Islamic Arabia). They contain references to archaic names and practices absent from Muslim-era ritual, and, like the Quran but unlike later Arabic-era historiographies, describe the Hajj not as a practice involving a polytheistic pantheon but instead centered around the worship of Allāh. Structural features of the poetry may have also helped its preservation, such as the meter and rhyme.\nA number of criteria have been proposed to distinguish authentic from inauthentic pre-Islamic poetry: namely, lines attributed to pre-Islamic poetry are suspect if they use or depend on overtly Quranic or Islamic phraseology, or if they are recruited by the authors that record them as support for specific political or exegetical positions. Likewise, heightened confidence might be placed on poems or lines which cluster with other poems or lines absent any suspicious material, lack anachronisms, and comport with beliefs held by pre-Islamic Arabs, especially when those are the views attributed by the Quran to its opponents but differ from the types of views attributed to Muhammad's opponents in later Arabic histories.\n\n\n== Comparison with post-Islamic poetry ==\nThere are several characteristics that distinguish pre-Islamic poetry from the poetry of later times. One of these characteristics is that in pre-Islamic poetry more attention was given to the eloquence and the wording of the verse than to the poem as whole. This resulted in poems characterized by strong vocabulary and short ideas but with loosely connected verses. A second characteristic is the romantic or nostalgic prelude with which pre-Islamic poems would often start. In these preludes, a thematic unit called \"nasib,\" the poet would remember his beloved and her deserted home and its ruins.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Arabic-language poets\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nAllen, Roger (2005) [1998].

        "content": "Eva Best (née, Williams; pen name, Saturn; 1851–1925) was an American story writer, poet, music composer, dramatist, and painter. She worked as a newspaper editor. She wrote a great deal in dialect.\nBest was among the first persons to recognize the poetry of Paul Laurence Dunbar and was influential in bringing him before the public. In his youth, Dunbar was an elevator attendant in the same building in which Best's father conducted an architect's office, and she became acquainted with the youth and his literary endeavors through seeing him in her father's building.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nEva Williams was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, December 19, 1851. She was the eldest daughter of John Insco Williams and Mrs. Mary Williams, who removed to Chicago, Illinois. Her father was an artist and painted the first bible panorama ever exhibited in the United States. Her mother is also an artist of merit as well as a writer of verse and prose. Eva's brother, Charles Insco Williams, was an artist and architect. A sister, Lulu, married William I. Buchanan.\n\n\n== Career ==\nBest started her literary career as a poet. \"The Beautiful Thought\", \"Love and Hate\", \"A Promised Day\", and \"Thou Art\" are included in The New Cycle (1899), while \"The Power of Thought\" was included in the Bible Review (1905).\nShe began writing for the papers in 1871, encouraged to do so by W. D. Bickham, of the Dayton Journal (now, Dayton Daily News). In 1872, she began contributing to the Cincinnati Saturday Night, and afterward for The Cincinnati Times-Star, under the nom de plume of \"Saturn\". She then wrote for Godey's Magazine, for Arthur's Lady's Home Magazine , and for Peterson's Magazine. Her first short story appeared in one of the Frank Leslie's periodicals. That was followed by stories in other publications. In 1882, her services were sought by the editor of the Detroit Free Press, with Best becoming the editor of the household department of that paper. She was also a regular contributor to Ansel Nash Kellogg's Newspaper Company. In 1900, Best joined The New Cycle where her editorial work focused on \"The Home Circle\" department; she also provided poems and short stories.\n\nBest wrote several dramas. The first, An American Princess, ran at least six seasons. A comedy drama, Sands of Egypt, was in the hands of Miss Elisabeth Marbury, of New York City. A Rhine Crystal was being used by Miss Floy Crowell, a New England artist. Best's other plays, The Little Banshee and Gemini, the former in Irish dialect, the latter a two-part character piece, were written for Miss Jennie Calef. In all these plays the music, dances, ballads and all incidental scores were distinctively original. In her dramatic work, she composed both the songs and the music with which her dramas were interspersed.\nBest wrote a number of ballads. One of her peculiar advantages in the writing of stories was her ability to sketch such illustrations as she required to visualize her thoughts. She devoted some attention to art. She often painted landscapes, flower pieces, and fruits, and was also extremely apt and original in the art of designing.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1869, she married William H. Best, of Dayton, Ohio, and made her home in that city. They had two children, a son and a daughter.\nEva Best died in Dayton, Ohio, April 17, 1925, after being ill for four months. Burial was in that city's Woodland Cemetery and Arboretum.\n\n\n== Selected works ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Works related to Woman of the Century/Eva Best at Wikisource",

For his diplomatic work, he was awarded numerous national and foreign decorations, including Medal of the Campaign, Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Isabella the Catholic, Knight of the Order of Charles III, Grand Cross of Military Merit, Grand Cross of Naval Merit.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nIn 1931, Merry del Val married his second cousin, María del Carmen de Gurtubay y Alzola, 2nd Marchioness of Yurreta y Gamboa (1910–1959), the only child of Juan Gurtubay y González de Castejón and Blanca de Alzola, 1st Marquesa of Yurreta and Gamboa (after her father's death her mother married Don José de Bustos y Ruiz de Araña Bustos, Duke of Andría). They divorced and the marriage was annulled by Papal decree. She then married Ángel Fernández de Liencres, Marquis of Nájera, in 1936. In 1948, she married John McKee-Norton, a Canadian living in England, whom she met at the Hôtel Ritz Paris.\nHe later married Mercedes de Ocio y Ureta, a daughter of Zoilo Enrique de Ocio y López de Haro (1908–1994). \nThe Marquess of Merry del Val died in San Sebastián on 8 January 1975. As he had no surviving issue, his nephew, Rafael Merry del Val y Melgarejo, became the 3rd Marquess of Merry del Val.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAlfonso Merry del Val y Zulueta (1864-1943), Spanish ambassador to England at the National Portrait Gallery, London",

        "content": "Alvadee Eugenia Hutton Adams (June 15, 1917 – August 11, 2003) was an American journalist and editor. She was editor of U.S. Lady beginning in 1956, a free monthly magazine for women in the military and military wives.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nHutton was born in Forman, North Dakota, and raised in New Cumberland, Pennsylvania, the daughter of Frank Zinn Hutton and Carrie May Sloat Hutton. Her father was a soil scientist in the lumber industry. She graduated from Temple University in 1940. She earned a master's degree in journalism at Columbia University in 1941. She was later vice-president of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism alumni association.\n\n\n== Career ==\nHutton worked as a waitress on cruise ships during her college years, and became familiar with Latin America from these summer travels. She was awarded a Pulitzer Traveling Fellowship in Journalism to report from Latin America. During the term of her fellowship, she met her husband, fellow journalist John B. Adams.\nIn 1956, Adams became editor of U.S. Lady magazine, a monthly publication for military women and military wives, published by her husband. In this role, she traveled widely, visiting American military bases and attending international conferences. She was a member of the National Press Club, the Overseas Press Club, and the American Newspaper Women's Club. In her later working life, she was involved in publications for Prince George's County Public Schools in Maryland. She retired in 1979, and moved to the Pacific Northwest to be near family.\n\n\n== Publications ==\n\"The Dog Star and its Unique Companion\" (1943)\n\"Lepers' Children: Eunice Weaver Spearheads Brazil's Battle Against an Ancient Scourge\" (1952)\n\"U.S. Wheat Licks Red Propaganda in Pakistan, Nation of 80 Million\" (1953)\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nHutton married John Bucher Adams in 1942, in Rio de Janeiro. They had two daughters, Alice and Abigail, both born in Alexandria, Virginia.  Her husband died in 1968, and Adams died in 2003, at the age of 86, in Mercer Island, Washington, from complications of Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAlvadee and John B.

The highway immediately enters the Peguis First Nation as it winds it way through residential areas while following along the banks of Bottle Creek for the next few kilometers. Passing by where Bottle Creek and another tributary converge to form the Fisher River, PR 224 begins following the river as it travels through the business district/settlement of Peguis. The road passes some more residential areas before leaving the First Nation and curving eastward to travel through wooded areas for a few kilometers. It now passes through the community of Dallas/Red Rose, where it meets the southern end of PR 412 (Jackhead Road), which provides access to the Kinonjeoshtegon First Nation as well as the Provincial Parks of Lake St. Andrew and Lake St. George, before entering the Fisher River Cree Nation. PR 224 crosses a bridge over the Fisher River to pass through the main settlement of Fisher River, including its business and residential districts. The highway leaves the First Nation and turns northward away from the river to travel through a short section of Fisher Bay Provincial Park before entering the community of Fisher Bay and coming to an end at a T-intersection with a residential street along the coastline of Lake Winnipeg's bay of the same name. The entire length of Provincial Road 224 is a paved two-lane highway.\n\n\n== Major intersections ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Arthur Leahy (5 August 1830 – 18 July 1878) was an Irish colonel in the Royal Engineers.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nLeahy was the seventh son of John Leahy, esq., J.P., of South Hill, Killarney. He was born 5 August 1830, and educated at Corpus Christi Hall, Maidstone, and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. He obtained a commission as lieutenant in the Royal Engineers on 27 June 1848, and, after completing his military studies at Chatham, was quartered in Ireland until 1853, and after that at Corfu.\nOn the outbreak of the war with Russia in 1854, he joined the army at Varna and proceeded with it to the Crimea. He was present at the battles of Alma and Inkerman. During the early part of the siege he was acting adjutant, and in charge of the engineer park of the left attack under Major (later General Sir) Frederick Chapman. In managing the park and the engineer transport train he first had an opportunity of showing his characteristic energy and industry. As the winter set in Leahy was appointed deputy-assistant quartermaster-general for the royal engineers. In the 'Journal of the Siege Operations,' published by authority, Leahy is credited with invaluable services in providing for the comfort and proper maintenance of the engineer troops. He received the Crimean war medal with three clasps, the Sardinian medal, the Turkish war medal and the 5th class of the Medjidie.\nFrom the Crimea he returned to Corfu in and became a second captain on 2 December. His brevet majority for service in the Crimea, which he received some time after, was antedated 8 December 1857. He returned home early in 1858, was stationed for a short time at Woolwich, and in June was appointed to the staff of the inspector-general of fortifications at the War Office. In 1864 he became assistant-director of works in the fortification branch of the War Office. When he went to the War Office, the defence of the home arsenals and dockyards had become a matter of urgency, and tie defence loan, the result of the royal commission on the defences of the United Kingdom of 1859, provided the necessary funds. The work thrown upon the fortification branch was enormous, and Leahy's share of it large. In addition to his regular work, he was a member of many committees, and in 1870 was secretary of that presided over by Lord Lansdowne on the employment of officers of royal engineers in the civil departments of the state.\nLeahy was employed at the Paris Exhibition of 1867, and made three able reports, which were published, on military hospitals and barrack buildings, on field hospital equipment, and on military telegraphy and signalling. He became a brevet lieutenant-colonel on 29 November 1868. In July 1871 he was appointed instructor of field works at the School of Military Engineering at Chatham, and owing to his efforts the instruction in fieldworks and kindred subjects was made available not only for the whole regular army but also for the militia and volunteers, it was also due to his initiative that classes for pioneer sergeants of infantry were introduced, and he himself prepared the official manual for their instruction. He took considerable interest in the field park and its workshops, and brought them into a high state of efficiency. He was promoted to be regimental lieutenant-colonel 10 December 1873, and in March 1876 was sent to Gibraltar as second in command of the Royal Engineers. He was promoted brevet-colonel 1 October 1877. The following year he was attacked by rock fever, was taken home, and died on 18 July 1878 at Netley Hospital, Southampton. Leahy was twice married, first in 1857 to Miss Tabuteau, by whom he had two children; and secondly to Miss E. J. Poynter, by whom he had five children. He was the author of a pamphlet on army reorganisation, 1868, 8vo.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Vetch, Robert Hamilton (1892). \"Leahy, Arthur\".

        "content": "Chaunax suttkissi, the pale-cavity gaper, spotted frogmouth, spotted gaper or Sutkus sea toad, is a species of marine ray-finned fish belonging to the family Chaunacidae, the sea toads. This species is found in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nChaunax suttkisi was first formally described in 1989 by the American ichthyologist John H. Caruso with its type locality given as off Venezuela in the Caribbean Sea at 11°40'N, 62°33'W, at a depth of 585–622 m (1,919–2,041 ft). Within the genus Chaunax this species is placed in the Chaunax fimbriatus species group. The genus Chaunax is one of two genera classified by the 5th edition of the Fishes of the World within the family Chaunacidae, the sea toads. The sea toads are placed within the monotypic suborder Chaunacoidei within the anglerfish order Lophiiformes.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nChaunax, the genus name, means \"one who gapes\", from chanos meaning \"to gape\", an allusion to the large, wide mouths of these fishes. The specific name suttkusi, honours Royal D. Suttkus, an ichthyologist at Tulane University for his contributions to ichthyology and the extensive collection of fish specimens he collated during his career at the university.\n\n\n== Description ==\nChaunax suttkusi has a globular, slight compressed body which tapers to a small, rounded caudal fin. The large head is somewhat cuboid with small eyes which are covered in transparent skin. The large, oblique mouth is equipped with many small, thin, sharp vertical teeth and the gill opening is small. Of the three dorsal spines, two are embedded in the skin on the nape and only the first, the illicium is visible. The illicium is tipped with a lure, or esca which is a mop-like tuft of filaments. The illicium is lowered into a flat, concave depression on the snout when not being used to attract prey. The dorsal fin is on the rear of the body and contains between 10 and 12 soft rays while the anal fin has 6 or 7 soft rays. The loose, flabby skin has a dense covering of robust denticles. The lateral line is open and runs from from the caudal peduncle to the head, with obvious canals connecting to branches under the eye, on the chin and along the lower flanks. The main part of the lateral line on the upper body contains between 29 and 42 pores with between 11 and 13 pores on the head. The overall colour is pale pink to rosy pink, with red on the top and sides of the head and fins and the undersides of both the head and body are whitish. The cavity on the snout for the illicium is pale while the illicium and esca are uniform in color, varying from pale through to dusky with the filaments of the esca being black. This species has a maximum published total length of 26.7 cm (10.5 in) and a maximum published weight of 359 g (12.7 oz).\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nChaunax suttkusi is found in the Atlantic Ocean. In the eastern Atlantic it occurs from Ireland south as far as Angola, its range includes the Azores, while in the western Atlantic it can be found from South Carolina as far south as the Rio Grande Rise. It has also been found in the Mediterranean Sea. The range of this species is thought to be extending northwards due to increasing temperatures as a result of climate change.This is a bathydemersal species found at depths between 220 and 1,060 m (720 and 3,480 ft) on soft bottoms on the continental shelf.\n\n\n== References ==",

It is classified under the Ministry of Public Health as a general hospital and is one of three general hospitals in the province. It is an affiliated teaching hospital of the Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University. The hospital is located nearby Damnoen Saduak Floating Market.\n\n\n== History ==\nConstruction of Damnoen Saduak Hospital started in 1959 due to a cholera outbreak in 1957 and the difficulty of traveling to Ratchaburi Hospital, the main hospital of the province which could only be done by canal boats. It was funded by the Ministry of Public Health and opened by Phra Bamrasnaradura in 1964 with a capacity of 50 beds. The hospital has underwent significant renovation and construction, reaching a capacity of 272 beds in 2022. \nOn 4 February 2023, a fire broke out in the emergency department. There were no casualties, with a financial damage valued at 10 million baht.

        "content": "Edward John Lake CSI (19 June 1823 – 7 June 1877) was a British major-general in the Royal Engineers.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nLake born at Madras on 19 June 1823. He was the son of Edward Lake (d. 1829), major in the Madras engineers, who served with distinction in the Mahratta war of 1817, and was author of ‘Sieges of the Madras Army.’ Sent to England with a sister at an early age, Edward was left an orphan when six years old by the foundering at sea of the ship Guildford, in which his parents with their four younger children were on passage home. He was brought up by his grandfather, Admiral Sir Willoughby Lake, who placed him at a private school at Wimbledon. He afterwards entered the military college of the East India Company at Addiscombe, and passed through the course in three terms instead of the usual four. He obtained a commission as second lieutenant in the Bengal engineers on 11 June 1840. After a year at the royal engineers' establishment at Chatham, he went to India, and was posted to the Bengal sappers and miners at Delhi.\nShortly after his arrival at Delhi, Lake was sent with a company of sappers to suppress an outbreak at Kythul, near Kurnaul. He there made the acquaintance of Henry and John Lawrence, and was employed for a time in road-making under the former. He was promoted lieutenant on 19 February 1844. During the autumn of 1845 he served as a settlement officer in the Umballa district under Major Broadfoot. On the outbreak of the Sikh war in the same year he was ordered to the Sutlej, and joined Lord Hardinge in time to be present at the battle of Moodkee on 20 December, when he had a horse shot under him and was himself severely wounded in the hand. After the battle he was sent to the frontier station of Loodiana, where he strengthened the defences and forwarded troops and supplies to the army in the field. When Sir Harry Smith's camp equipage fell into the hands of the enemy just before the battle of Aliwal, Lake was able to replace it, and received the commendation of the governor-general for his zeal and promptness. He was present at the battle of Aliwal, and received a medal and clasp for his services in the campaign.\nOn the restoration of peace in March 1846, the trans-Sutlej territory of the Jalundhur Doab was made over to the British as a material guarantee. John Lawrence was appointed commissioner for the newly acquired territory, and Lake was nominated one of his assistants and placed in charge of the Kangra district, with headquarters at Noorpoor, whence he was soon moved to Jalundhur.\nIn May 1848, when Sir Henry Lawrence, the commissioner of the Punjab, had left India on furlough to England, open hostility was manifested by Mulraj, governor of Mooltan, and his turbulent Sikhs; Patrick Alexander Vans Agnew and Lieutenant Anderson were foully murdered, and the Punjab was in a blaze. Herbert Edwardes, who was in political charge of the Dera Ismail Khan district and nearest to Mooltan, hastily collected a body of Pathans and managed to hold his own against Mulraj. Lake was specially selected as political officer to the nawab of Bahawalpoor, a friendly Mahometan chief, whose territories adjoined the Punjab, and in virtual command of the nawab's troops he co-operated with his old friend Edwardes. He took part on 1 July in the second battle of Suddoosam, close to Mooltan, and for seven months was engaged in the operations for the reduction of Mooltan before it fell. During these stirring times Lake, then only a lieutenant like Edwardes, was in fact commander-in-chief of the Davodpootra army, and although directed to co-operate with Edwardes, and in no way under his orders, he nevertheless magnanimously subordinated himself, and was content to do his utmost to further his friend's plans (Edwardes, A Year in the Punjab). On the fall of Mooltan, Lake was again in the field, and took part in the final victory of Gujerat on 21 February 1849. He accompanied General Gilbert to the Indus in his pursuit of the Afghans, and was present at Rawul Pindee when the Sikh army laid down its arms. The war over, Lake received a medal and two clasps. Going to Batala, he next had charge, under John (afterwards Lord) Lawrence, for two years of the northern portion of the country between the rivers Beas and Ravee. In 1852 he went home on furlough, travelling through Russia, Prussia, Norway, and Sweden. He returned to India in 1854, having been promoted captain on 21 August, and a brevet-major on 22 August for his services in the Punjab campaign. He took up his old charge in the trans-Sutlej province at Kangra as deputy-commissioner. In 1855 he was appointed commissioner of the Jalundhur Doab. When the mutiny broke out in 1857, Lake occupied and secured the fort of Kangra against the rebels, and held it until the mutiny was suppressed. His calmness and resource were a tower of strength to the government throughout the crisis.\nIn 1860 his health failed, and he was obliged to go to England. He was promoted lieutenant-colonel on 18 February 1861, and in July married the youngest daughter of T. Bewes, esq., of Beaumont, Plymouth. He returned to his post at Jalundhur in the same year. In 1865 he was appointed financial commissioner of the Punjab, and the following year was made a companion of the Star of India. In 1867 ill-health again compelled him to go to England, and subsequently to decline Lord Lawrence's offer of the much-coveted appointment of resident of Hyderabad. He had been promoted colonel on 31 December 1868, and on 1 January 1870 he retired on a pension with the honorary rank of major-general. After he left India the ‘Lake Scholarship’ was founded by public subscription in January 1870 in his honour at the Lahore High School.\nAbout 1855 Lake had come under deep spiritual impressions, and was thenceforth earnestly religious. At home he became honorary secretary of the East London Mission Relief Fund in 1868, and worked hard between 1869 and 1876 as honorary lay secretary of the Church Missionary Society. From April 1871 to June 1874 he was sole editor of the ‘Church Missionary Record,’ and contributed articles to the ‘Church Missionary Intelligencer,’ the ‘Sunday at Home,’ &c. In the summer of 1876 lung disease made it necessary for him to remove from London to Bournemouth, and in the following spring he went to Clifton, where he died on 7 June 1877. He was buried on 13 June 1877 in Long Ashton churchyard, near Clifton. In 1873 he edited the fifth edition of the ‘Church Missionary Atlas,’ and was engaged on another edition at the time of his death. Lake was a man of slight and delicate frame, but of a very cheery and lovable disposition. He had great aptitude for business, and remarkable tact in the management of natives, by whom he was known as Lake Sahib, and was much beloved. Lord Lawrence, Sir Robert Montgomery, and other great Indian administrators had a very high opinion of him. Sir R. Montgomery wrote: ‘The names of Herbert Edwardes, Donald McLeod, and Edward Lake will ever be remembered as examples of the highest type of public servants and devoted friends.’\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Vetch, Robert Hamilton (1892). \"Lake, Edward John\".

        "content": "Seahouses Lifeboat Station is located in the village of Seahouses, in the county of Northumberland. \nA lifeboat was first stationed here by the Crewe Trustees in 1827. The station was taken over by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) in 1859. Originally known as North Sunderland Lifeboat Station, the name was formally changed to Seahouses Lifeboat Station in 1999.\nThe station currently operates a Shannon-class All-weather lifeboat 13-36 John and Elizabeth Allan (ON 1343), and a D-class (IB1) Inshore lifeboat Grace Darling (D-828).\n\n\n== History ==\nWhen a harbour was created near the village of North Sunderland in Northumberland, it gradually developed to become the separate village of Seahouses. Over the years, the two villages grew in size, and have now effectively merged.\nA new lifeboat station was established in North Sunderland in 1827 by the Crewe Trustees, a charitable organisation founded by Nathaniel Crewe, Bishop of Durham in 1704. A stone-built boathouse was constructed, and a lifeboat transferred here from Holy Island, a 31-foot 10-oared boat, built by Henry Greathead in 1802. There are no records of any service by this lifeboat, which was replaced in 1838 by a 27-foot lifeboat, designed by Capt. John Foulerton, RN, and built by Shore.\nOn 7 September 1838, the paddle steamer Forfarshire ran aground on the Farne Island Rocks and broke in two. Much is available to read of the subsequent heroism of Grace Darling and her father William Darling. The North Sunderland lifeboat did not launch to the wreck, the coxswain instead opting for a small coble that he believed more suited to effect a rescue around the rocks. One of the seven crew was William Darling, brother of Grace. They battled to arrive at the wreck, only to find the rescue had been completed, but unable to return home due to the weather, they then spent 2 days seeking shelter in a disused building, all other 'accommodation' at the Farne Island Lighthouse being full.\nWhen the 1838 lifeboat was deemed unfit for service in 1851, an order was placed with Forrestt of Limehouse, London for a 30-foot 'Self-righting', similar in design to the James Beeching lifeboat, which had won the prize awarded by the president of the Royal National Institute for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck (RNIPLS), Algernon Percy, 4th Duke of Northumberland. \nIn 1859, the secretary of the Crewe Trustees requested that the RNLI take over the management of the North Sunderland Lifeboat Station, for which the trustees would give a grant of £30 per annum to the RNLI. The existing 30-foot lifeboat was never launched on service for the RNLI, who in 1865 decided to replace it. A 33-foot 10-oared self-righting 'Pulling and Sailing' (P&S) lifeboat, (one using oars and sail), was built by Forrestt of Limehouse, London, costing £274-19s-3d, and a new launch carriage cost a further £102-11s-0d. The lifeboat and carriage were transported to North Sunderland free of charge by the Great Northern and North Eastern railway companies. At a ceremony on 12 June, the boat was named Joseph Anstice by the donor, Mrs Anstice of Tynemouth.\nThomas Pringle retired in May 1886 after serving as Coxswain for 21 years. As was common practice, he was awarded the RNLI Silver Medal in recogniton of his many service calls. Only 17 months later, he would drown in a boating accident on 6 October 1887.\n\nNorth Sunderland would receive their first motor-powered lifeboat in 1936, the non-self-righting Liverpool-class lifeboat, with a 35 hp petrol engine, delivering a speed of 7.47 knots. A new boathouse nearer the harbour was constructed. Previously, P&S lifeboats had cost a few hundred pounds. Costing £3,447, the cost was met from the combined funds of three legacies, and the boat was in effect given three names, The William and James, the Ridge Matthews, and the Abigail Gardiner, each chosen by the donor. At a ceremony on 5 September 1936, the boat was formally named W.R.A. (ON 781) by Helen Percy, Duchess of Northumberland. Each name was inscribed on a plaque inside the boat.\nA D-class (RFD PB16) Inshore lifeboat would be stationed at North Sunderland in 1964. The rise in leisure activity at the coast demanded a quick response vessel, and these boats would quickly show their value. In the first 35 years on station to 1999, the inshore boats would launch just over 300 times, saving 85 lives.\n\nIn 1991, a new boathouse was constructed to house the Mersey-class lifeboat 12-16 Grace Darling (ON 1173) and Talus launch tractor, with improved crew facilities, and storage for the D-class.On 9 April 1999, on the request of station personnel, the RNLI agreed that North Sunderland station be formally renamed Seahouses Lifeboat Station with immediate effect.\nFor two years, the station had the unusual occurrence of having two lifeboats with the same name, the new D-class (IB1) also being named Grace Darling (D-828) in 2018.\nAfter 29 years on station, Mersey-class lifeboat 12-16 Grace Darling (ON 1173)  was retired in 2020, and sold to the ADES Uruguay lifeboat service. She was renamed ADES 28 Grace Darling, based in Colonia del Sacramento. She would be replaced by 13-36 John and Elizabeth Allan (ON 1343), a 25 knot Water-jet powered Shannon-class lifeboat, costing over £2 million. The boat was funded by the late professor James Allan, and named after his parents.\n\n\n== Station honours ==\nThe following are awards made at North Sunderland / Seahouses\n\nRNLI Gold Medal\nLt.

        "content": "Mabel Rehnfeldt (born 1964) is a Paraguayan reporter and editor for ABC Digital–ABC Color. \nHer investigations into corruption and human rights abuses in her country have made her the target of violent threats. In 2004, she received the Courage in Journalism Award from the International Women's Media Foundation.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nMabel Rehnfeldt was born in Villarrica, Paraguay, in 1964.\nShe first sought out a career in journalism in the early 1980s, studying communications and later working as a press consultant for the Universidad Católica \"Nuestra Señora de la Asunción\".\n\n\n== Career ==\nWhen dictator Alfredo Stroessner was overthrown in 1989, Rehnfeldt began working at the independent newspaper ABC Color's weekly magazine Dominical. After becoming an investigative reporter in 1991, in 1994 she was named the head of ABC Color's investigative unit, as well as its website. Decades later, she continues to work as an investigative reporter and editor at ABC Digital–ABC Color, where she is considered one of the publication's most prominent journalists.\nAt ABC, Rehnfeldt covers human rights abuses and government corruption. She investigated illegal tobacco trafficking as part of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists' 2007–2008 \"Tobacco Underground\" project and has also collaborated on other ICIJ projects, including the 2020 FinCEN Files.\nFor over two decades starting in 1998, Rehnfeldt also hosted a daily radio program on Radio Primero de Marzo. She served as the founding president of the Forum for Paraguayan Journalists (FOPEP), and she teaches journalism at the Universidad Americana in Asunción.\nRehnfeldt has faced significant pushback against her investigations. In 1989, she was attacked by an unknown assailant after investigating police corruption. She has also been the target of personal harassment and blackmail, as well as legal battles and further threats on her life. In 2003, unknown attackers attempted to kidnap her daughter as she returned from school, after Rehnfeldt published investigations into the Paraguayan Catholic Church's handling of sexual abuse.\nIn 2004, she received the Courage in Journalism Award from the International Women's Media Foundation, becoming the first winner from Paraguay. The following year, she was awarded Columbia University's Maria Moors Cabot Prize.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Riverside Consolidated School is a historic Canadian public consolidated school located in Riverside-Albert (now part of Fundy Albert), Albert County, New Brunswick. Built in 1905, the schoolbuilding is three-storeys tall and is made from wood. It is recognized as a Provincial Heritage Building, and continues to operate.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nSchools in rural Canadian areas had a growing trend of becoming consolidated in the early 1900s, with New Brunswick supporting the creation of them through 1903 legislation. $5,000 in funding for the school was provided by Abner Reid McClelan, a former Senator and Lieutenant Governor of New Brunswick, with additional funding being provided by the province and through taxes. Riverside Consolidated School was built in 1905, designed by architect Watson Elkinah Reid. H. Copp and Dixon, contractors from Sackville, were hired by Reid for the construction. The wooden building, measuring three storeys tall, sits next to the Shepody River. Succeeding the Grammar School for Albert County, the school opened in September 1905 with an initial enrollment of 275 students, serving grades 1–11 at the time. On June 15, 1906, the school's opening ceremony began. Established as a consolidated school, it previously served high school-level students.\nOn May 27, 1997, the school was recognized as a Provincial Heritage Place under New Brunswick's Heritage Conservation Act. In 2015, the Anglophone East School District held a council meeting addressing the potential closure for the school, which local residents campaigned against citing concerns such as the lengthy busing distance to the closest alternative in Hillsborough. The council unanimously voted to continue running the school. Riverside Consolidated School still features a distinctive escape chute on the schoolbuilding.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRiverside Consolidated School",

He specialized in Yemeni history. Some narrations from him are present in The Book of Crowns on the Kings of Himyar, a semi-legendary book about the rulers of the Himyarite Kingdom.\n\n\n== Life ==\nThe birth date of 'Ubayd bin Shari'a al-Jurhami is unknown. However, he was a contemporary of Muawiyah and also met him in the year 660. He died in 686 during the rule of Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan, the fourth Umayyad Caliph. His age is disputed upon amongst historians; 'Ubayd told Muawiyah that he was 240 years old, something which the latter refused to believe, while 'Ubayd himself has also said that he is 150 years old in some of his works. Another narrative also states that he lived for at least three hundred years. Zarif Marzouk denied the ages stated in the narratives, and came to the conclusion that 'Ubayd died much lesser than what had been stated previously.\n\n\n== Historicity ==\n\n\n=== Existence ===\nSome scholars have disputed whether 'Ubayd bin Shari'a was a real person. Qarunqu denied his existence, and instead concluded that he was a character invented by the historian Ibn al-Nadim, the author of the Fihrist.\n\n\n=== Authenticity ===\nHamilton Gebb mentioned that 'Ubayd did provide the Arabs with early historical information that lacked historical senses. Jawad Ali, on the other hand, accused 'Ubayd of taking stories from Arabian Jewish tales and folklore. \nAbdul Aziz al-Douri regarded any narrations of 'Ubayd as mere folktales and poetic imaginary stories of Yemeni history.\n\n\n== Works ==\nThe book Kitab al-Muluk wa al-Akhbar al-Madhi was attributed to 'Ubayd bin Shari'a, and a more recent copy was first printed in Hyderabad in 1928, while another older copy still exists in the British Museum. This book, however, is disputed in terms of its authenticity.\n\n\n== See also ==\nWahb ibn Munabbih\nAl-Tabari\nIbn Kathir\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2024 Music City 150 was the 3rd stock car race of the 2024 ARCA Menards Series East season, and the 4th iteration of the event. The race was held on Saturday, May 11, 2024, at the Nashville Fairgrounds Speedway in Nashville, Tennessee, a 0.596 mile (0.959 km) permanent asphalt oval shaped short track. The race took the scheduled 150 laps to complete. William Sawalich, driving for Joe Gibbs Racing, would put on a blistering performance, leading all but five laps in the race to earn his fifth career ARCA Menards Series East win, and his first of the season. Pole-sitter Gio Ruggiero led the first four laps of the race, before he spun and hit the wall on lap 6. He continued to race until lap 49, where he pulled into the pits and retired from the race, officially credited with a 14th place finish. To fill out the podium, Isabella Robusto, driving for Venturini Motorsports, and Connor Zilisch, driving for Pinnacle Racing Group, would finish 2nd and 3rd, respectively. \n\n\n== Report ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\n\nNashville Fairgrounds Speedway is a motorsport racetrack located at the Nashville Fairgrounds near downtown Nashville, Tennessee. The track is the second-oldest continually operating track in the United States. The track held NASCAR Grand National/Winston Cup (now NASCAR Cup Series) races from 1958 to 1984.\nThe speedway is currently an 18 degree banked paved oval. The track is 0.596 mi (0.959 km) long. Inside the larger oval is a 1⁄4 mi (0.40 km) paved oval.\nThe track was converted to a 1⁄2 mi (0.80 km) paved oval in 1957, when it began to be a NASCAR series track. The speedway was lengthened between the 1969 and 1970 seasons. The corners were cut down from 35 degrees to their present 18 degrees in 1972. The track was repaved between the 1995 and 1996 seasons.\n\n\n==== Entry list ====\n(R) denotes rookie driver.\n\n\n== Practice ==\nThe first and only practice session was held on Saturday, May 11, at 2:00 PM CST, and lasted for 60 minutes.

        "content": "Mistislaw, also known as Mstislav (d. after 1018), was an Elbe Slavic prince of the Nakonid lineage and ruled over the Obotrites in what is now Mecklenburg and eastern Holstein from 990/995 to 1018.\nThe Nakonids were among the most powerful Christian Slavic princes in the second half of the 10th century. In the retinue of the Saxon Duke Bernhard I, Mistislaw participated in Otto II's campaign against the Saracens in southern Italy in 982, from which he returned with only a few survivors. In the subsequent Slavic revolt of 983, the Nakonids relinquished their sovereignty over several Obotrite branches to the victorious Lutici. Upon the death of his father, Mstivoj, in 990 or 995, Mistislaw attempted to establish royal rule over the remaining peoples. While he managed to secure the support of the Church and the Empire, the opposition within the Obotrites joined forces with the Lutici. From 1003 onwards, Mistislaw's ability to secure Saxon support was eroded by Henry II's alliance with the Lutici against the Polish prince Boleslaw I. This ultimately resulted in Mistislaw's inability to assert his authority. In February 1018, the Lutici invaded the Obotrite kingdom, incited unrest among the population, and compelled Mistislaw to seek refuge in the Saxon Bardengau.\nThe majority of recent research views Mistislaw as a Christian Slavic prince with close ties to the Holy Roman Empire. This research suggests that his attempt to reorganise the Obotrite kingdom from a personal state to a territorial state failed, despite the support of the Church and the Saxon duchy.\n\n\n== Life ==\n\n\n=== Origin and family ===\nMistislaw, also known as Mistizlavus and Missizla in historical sources, was the son of the Obotritic sovereign (Samtherrscher), Mstivoj. He had two sisters, Tove and Hodica. A marriage to the niece of the Saxon Duke Bernhard I was unsuccessful in 983 due to the opposition of Dietrich of Haldensleben. Mistislaw had a son, Pribignew, with an unknown wife, who assumed control of the confederation around 1020 with the support of Danish and Saxon forces.\n\n\n=== Campaign against the Saracens in southern Italy ===\nBefore assuming the role of ruler, Mistislaw participated in Emperor Otto II's Italian campaign in 982 as a representative of the Nakonid family. At the head of a delegation of Obotrite armoured horsemen, he crossed the Alps in 981/982 in the wake of the Saxon Duke Bernhard I to reinforce the imperial army in the southern part of the empire. At this juncture, the emperor initiated a military campaign against the Saracens, who had advanced from Sicily to the southern Italian mainland under the leadership of their emir Abu al-Qasim. The contingent led by Mistislaw is said to have consisted of 1,000 armoured horsemen. By medieval standards, this number is hardly believable, particularly when one considers that the emperor had only requested a total of 2090 armoured riders from the northern part of the empire in his call-up order. Nevertheless, the number of Obotrite warriors must have been exceptionally high, as Bernhard I promised the marriage of his niece to Mistislaw in return for their participation in the campaign, thus creating a dynastic connection between the two princely houses. While Bernhard I was compelled to return to the north at an early stage due to an invasion by the Danes, the vast majority of the Abodrites perished in Italy. Although their ultimate fate remains unknown, it seems likely that they participated in the Battle of Cape Colonna, in which the imperial army was decisively defeated on 15 July 982.\nMistislaw returned to Mecklenburg with the few survivors. Upon demanding the fulfilment of the marriage promise, Count Dietrich von Haldensleben refused to provide him with the bride, stating that a duke's blood relative should not be given to a dog. It seems probable that Dietrich's reasons for opposing a dynastic union between the Billungers and the Nakonids were power-political. As Margrave of the Nordmark, he competed with the Billungers and Nakonids for influence in the Circipanian territory, which was traditionally subject to Obotrite rule. Conversely, it seems unlikely that Dietrich's ethnic reservations about a marriage between the Slavic prince's son and the Saxon princess were a significant factor in his opposition to the union. Such unions were not uncommon at the time. In 978, Dietrich himself had sponsored the marriage of his eldest daughter Oda to the Polish prince Mieszko I, and his other daughter Mathilde had married the Hevelli prince Pribislaw. Mistislaw's father, Mstivoj, was married to the sister of the Oldenburg bishop, Wago, and a relative of the Saxon duke, Bernhard I, Weldrud, had been given in marriage to the Wagrian prince, Sederich.\n\n\n=== Sovereignty ===\nAs the sovereign of the Obotrite confederation, Mistislaw ruled over the eponymous Obotrite branch on both sides of Lake Schwerin and the princes of the various branches. They owed him military allegiance and tribute.\n\n\n==== Accession to power ====\nThe date of Mistislav's accession to power is uncertain. The majority of research has concentrated on the years 990 and 995. Christian Lübke has proposed that a significant shift in Obotrite policy could be identified from 990 onwards, which would indicate a change in leadership. In contrast, Peter Donat and Jürgen Petersohn propose that a friendly visit by King Otto III to Mecklenburg in September 995 could have taken place on the occasion of Mistislav's enthronement.\n\n\n==== Exercise of power ====\n\nAs his father Mstiwoj had done before him, Mistislaw also used Mecklenburg Castle as a central seat of power and place of representation. This is evidenced by the official residence of the Oldenburg bishops Reginbert (991/992-1013/1014) and Bernard (1013/1014-1023), who resided at Mecklenburg Castle during Mistislaw's reign. Additionally, a nunnery was situated either on or close to Mecklenburg Castle. Following the Saxon model, this nunnery may have been established to provide accommodation for the daughters of the nobles of the Obotrite lands, to foster a sense of local loyalty among the noble families, binding them to location of the rulers seat. This is at odds with the account in Thietmar of Merseburg, which states that Mistislaw was imprisoned and besieged in Schwerin Castle in 1018. Nils Rühberg does not perceive any inconsistency in this account; rather, he suggests that Mistislaw had fled from Mecklenburg to Schwerin Castle.\nThe question of which of the Obotrite branches Mistislaw ruled over remains unresolved. It is assumed that he ruled over the Polabians to the west and the Kessinians to the east of Lake Schwerin, as well as the Linones to the south, who later emerged with their own tribal princes. The extent of his influence on the most significant branch besides the Obotrites, the Wagri in eastern Holstein, remains uncertain. The majority of scholars today assume that the ecclesiastical structures were permanently abolished in 990 and that Mistislaw still held at most a loose overlordship over the Wagrian prince Sederich. However, Thietmar of Merseburg expressly described him as the ruler of the Obotrites and Wagri in 1018. However, it is certain that the Circipania people along the Lower Peene were not under Mistislaw's rule. It is evident that the Circipanians had already allied themselves with the victorious Lutici, either concurrently or shortly after the Slavic uprising of 983.\nMistislaw sought to establish a form of autocracy within his territory, akin to that of a king. In Obotrite society, the ruler was not the sole bearer of political will. Rather, the lower nobility possessed a range of ancestral rights, including the independent administration of their castle districts and the installation and removal of the ruler. Mistislav's attempt to disempower the lesser nobility led to their opposition to him. The opposition nobles found allies in the pagan priesthood, whose influence Mistislaw sought to eliminate by expanding the Christian church organisation and the associated missionary work among the population. The veracity of reports by the Bosau priest Helmold in his Chronica Slavorum from around 1167 that Mistislaw had turned against the Christian church and dissolved the nunnery on Mecklenburg Castle is increasingly being questioned by researchers. This is particularly the case given that these reports contradict older reports that Bishop Bernhard's missionary endeavours among the Slavs were very successful and that Mistislaw remained a Christian until the end of his life.\n\n\n==== Alliance policy ====\nMistislaw renewed his alliance with the Saxon Duke Bernhard I, to whom the Nakonids had been obliged to follow the army and pay tribute as vassals, at least under Mistislaw's father Mstivoj. King Otto III's friendly visit to Mecklenburg in the autumn of 995 was also an expression of cordial relations with the royal court, which had its roots in the common enmity with the Lutici. Consequently, no attacks by the Obotrites on Saxon territory are recorded during the tenure of Otto III as emperor (996-1002).\n\n\n==== Downfall ====\nThe death of Emperor Otto III marked the beginning of Mistislaw's political decline. Initially, his allies, the Saxon Billungers, lost their royal proximity in the empire with the accession of Henry II. The primary cause of this was the conflict that erupted in Merseburg in the summer of 1002 between Henry II and the Polish ruler Bolesław I, with whom both the Nakonids and the Billungers were closely aligned. Subsequently, Henry II concluded an alliance with the pagan Lutici, Mistislaw's enemies, in Quedlinburg at Easter 1003. The altered political landscape resulted in a significant reduction in Saxon support for Mistislaw against the Liutizen and the inner-Abodrite opposition. The pagan priesthood and the lower nobility found a natural ally in the Lutici, whose constitution, without a monarchical leadership, was attractive to the nobles due to its \"freedom in the manner of the Lutici\". In February 1018, Mistislaw's position in the Obotrite kingdom became untenable. The accusation that Mistislaw had refused to join their army in the campaign against Boleslaw in autumn 1017 was used as a pretext for the Lutici to invade the Abodrite kingdom with an army, stir up the population and besiege Mistislaw in Schwerin Castle. From this point onwards, he and the princely family were able to flee to the Bardengau, probably to Lüneburg, the residence of the Saxon Duke Bernhard II. In the meantime, the rebels proceeded to destroy the Christian institutions in the Obotrite kingdom. Upon learning of the events in his diocese, Bishop Bernhard expressed his profound concern to Emperor Henry II, though he \"sighed heavily, but postponed a decision until Easter in order to resolve the unfortunate web of conspiracy according to a well-considered plan\". Nevertheless, the emperor refrained from intervening on behalf of the Church or reinstating Mistislav. In the year 1018, Mistislav died in exile in Saxony. No surviving memorial entries commemorate him.\n\n\n== Availability of sources ==\nThe availability of historical sources is adverse, as there are no surviving written sources from the Obotrites. The existence and rule of Mistislaw are attested exclusively by Saxon reports, for the first time in 1018 in the chronicle of Thietmar of Merseburg, written between 1012 and 1018. In his Hamburg Church History, written around 1070, Adam of Bremen reports learning of a Slavic prince named Mistislaw, under whom peace had reigned in the territory of the Obotrites. However, chronologically, Adam places Mistislaw before his father Mstivoj and confuses the two when he has Mstivoj flee from an uprising in 1018. In Helmold of Bosau's Slavic Chronicle, Mistislaw, the son of an otherwise completely unknown Billug, ultimately becomes a \"furious hater of Christians\" who plots against his Christian stepmother until his father disowns her, raids and plunders Christian institutions and finally dissolves the convent on Mecklenburg Castle out of anti-Christian sentiment to marry the nuns to his warriors and his sister Hodica to a Boleslaw.\n\n\n== Research history ==\nPrevious research on Mistislaw was primarily genealogical and church historical in nature. Confusion between Mistislaw and his father Mstivoj by Adam of Bremen and Helmold of Bosau led to ambiguities that hindered historians' attempts to establish a lineage of the Nakonids. Since Bernhard Schmeidler's investigation in 1918, Mistislaw's descent from Mstivoj has been generally recognised. As Helmold depicts Mistislaw as a vehement opponent of Christianity, in contrast to Adam, interest in ecclesiastical history was directed towards the question of whether Mistislaw actually adhered to the Christian faith until 1018. This question was finally answered by Albert Hauck.\nIn contrast, more recent research on the history of the Elbe Slavs has focused on the failed nation-building of the Obotrites and their relations with the neighbouring Saxons.\nIn 1960, Wolfgang H. Fritze, in his foundational work on the challenges of Obotritic tribal and kingdom governance, classified Mistislaw's rule during the partial tribal state as a form of authority over an association of individuals. Fritze's assessment has recently been contradicted by the archaeologist Fred Ruchhöft, who recognises the beginnings of nation-building under Mistislaw in particular. This involved a shift in Mistislaw's rulership from the \"accumulation of a princely rule over several tribal princes\" to a \"territorial rule of followers\". Previously, various historians had posited that Mistislaw had endeavoured to establish a royal-like rule based on territorial succession by eliminating the hereditary rights of the lower nobility.\nThe relationship between Mistislaw and the Saxon dukes and Otto III is also viewed differently by scholars. Mistislaw's flight to the Bardengau has consistently led historians to posit an alliance with the Saxon dukes. In order to consolidate his authority, he was compelled to consent to the permanent incorporation of the Obotrite settlement area as the Mark of the Billunger into an Ottonian system of marks. Mistislaw's role has been variously characterised as that of a governor and \"tax collector\" of the Billungers. This interpretation has been subject to criticism on several occasions, as it is incompatible with the otherwise strong and independent position of the Obotrite ruler. Finally, the reassessment of Otto III's visit to Mecklenburg in 995 as a friendly visit by the royal patron represents a departure from previous research findings. In contrast, Christian Lübke categorised Mistislaw as an enemy of the Saxons and the empire. During his tenure, the Obotrites devastated Northern Albingia, incinerated Hamburg, and destroyed the diocese of Oldenburg. This was followed by a series of military confrontations between the Obotrites and the Saxons, which culminated in the king's conquest of Mecklenburg in September 995 and the subjugation of Mistislaw.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nThietmar of Merseburg (1935).

        "content": "Aegista oldhami is a species of air-breathing land snails, a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod in the family Camaenidae.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe diameter of the shell attains 13 mm.\nThe fairly large, rather thin shell is orbiculately depressed and widely  umbilicate. It is greenish brown. The spire is depressedly conoid and has an obtuse apex. The suture  is impressed. The shell contains six to seven narrow whorls. These are slowly increasing and subplanulate. The sculpture consists of closed raised striae, that are irregularly oblique and flexuous, and fine decussating spiral lines. The body whorl is shortly and rapidly descending in front and obtusely angulated above the periphery. The aperture is oblique and lunately rounded. The base  of the shell is convex and angular around the  umbilicus. The thin peristome is a little  expanded with the margins approaching.  \n\n\n== Distribution ==\nThis species occurs in Myanmar and India.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBenson, W.

        "content": "Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition is a 2024 upcoming video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch system. It is based on the esports competition, Nintendo World Championships. The game is set to be released on July 18, 2024 digitally on the Nintendo eShop and as a physical deluxe edition in stores.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nNintendo World Championships: NES Edition focuses on players speedrunning certain objectives, known as Challenges, in NES-era Nintendo video games, aiming to complete these tasks as fast as possible. Players are given specific grades for completing these Challenges based on how fast they completed them and are given coins to spend on unlocking new Challenges. Unlike the actual Nintendo World Championships in 1990 or the Nintendo World Championships Remix mode within NES Remix, there is no mode within NES Edition that uses a points system over three games.\n\n\n=== Modes ===\nSpeedrun Mode - Players have to speedrun specific Challenges as fast as possible on their own. Coins earned in the game can be used to unlock new Challenges to complete in this mode.\nWorld Championships - Players speedrun five different Challenges consecutively, with the time spent on them being tallied and placed onto an online leaderboard. The World Championships mode consists of weekly Competitions, with the list of Challenges updated each week.\nParty Mode - Up to 8 players in local multiplayer compete to see who can complete Challenges the fastest. Each player is given points after each Challenge (known in the mode as a Match) that are accumulated to determine a winner.\n\n\n== Games ==\nThe following games are set to be featured in this game:\n\n\n== Development and release ==\nThe game was initially accidentally leaked early by the ESRB on May 3, 2024. \n\n\n== See also ==\nNES Remix, the video game series on the Wii U with similar play style\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Yasuyuki Kawahigashi (河東 泰之, born 1962), formerly known as Yasuyuki Asano, is a Japanese mathematician and a professor at the Graduate School of Mathematical Sciences, the University of Tokyo. His primary area of expertise is operator algebra theory.\n\n\n== Career ==\nBorn in Ōta, Tokyo, Kawahigashi was raised in a family where his father worked for an oil company and his mother was a teacher at a Kumon learning centre. Kawahigashi graduated from Azabu High School in 1981, where he was classmates with Hiraku Nakajima. He matriculated at the University of Tokyo in 1981. During his years as an undergraduate, he worked for ASCII and authored several bestselling software books, supporting himself through royalties.\nKawahigashi completed his undergraduate degree at UTokyo's Department of Mathematics in 1985. He then went on to study at the University of California, Los Angeles in 1985 under the supervision of Masamichi Takesaki, a proponent of the Tomita–Takesaki theory. he earned his master's degree from UCLA the following year. He earned his first Ph.D. from UCLA in 1989 and the second from UTokyo in 1990. He has held various academic positions at various institutions before attaining his current role. \n\n\n=== Major Contributions ===\nAccording to Kawahigashi, his most notable achievement so far is the completion of the classification theory for local conformal nets with central charge less than one, co-authored with Italian mathematician Roberto Longo in 2004.\n\n\n== Supervision ==\nKawahigashi has supervised Narutaka Odaka as a doctoral candidate. Although educated at the Department of Physics of UTokyo, Yoshiko Ogata joined Kawahigashi's seminar as a student, and she worked with him at the Department of Mathematics at the university for more than a decade.\nKawahigashi believes that one should never stop questioning, researching, or consulting others until complete understanding is achieved, asserting that 'It is absurd for someone who cannot do this to be in a doctoral programme.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Black Paintings are a series of 24 minimalism related works executed by the painter and sculptor Frank Stella (1936–2024) in the late 1950s and 1960 in what is seen as being a response to abstract expressionism.  The series was executed between 1958 and 1960.  Some consider the works to be examples of minimalism and others one of the precursors of that movement in the visual arts.\nStella used commercial enamel paint and a house-painter's brush, he painted black stripes of the same width and evenly spaced on bare canvas, leaving the thin strips of canvas between them unpainted and exposed, along with his pencil-and-ruler drawn guideline.\nThese works are considered to have been Stella's breakthrough works.  Four paintings from the series were included in the seminal exhibition at MoMA curated by Dorothy Miller, Sixteen Americans.\nDie Fahne Hoch! (1959) now in the permanent collection of the Whitney Museum of American Art is perhaps the most famous work in this series. The title  of this work which means Raise the Flag!, in German, is taken from the anthem of the Nazi Party, the \"Horst-Wessel-Lied\", and is one of three paintings in the series which makes direct reference to Nazism.  Stella maintained that there was zilch in the work beyond what is observable and notoriously remarked What you see is what you Get.\n\n\n== References ==",

Adults can grow to 10 to 25 millimeters in length. The body of Labidura cryptera is bilaterally symmetrical and it sports a pair of membranous wings beneath its forewings. Individuals have black stripes that run the length of their body with a dark pattern on the back edge of the forewings. Like all earwigs, Labidura cryptera has a pair of pincers or cerci of the back of the abdomen.\n\n\n== Range ==\nLabidura cryptera is found in small regions of China in very specific habitats.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\nThe earwig prefers dark, moist environments under some sort of cover or shelter in the daytime. It is a primarily nocturnal insect doing most of its activity under the cover of night. Labidura cryptera can be found in coastal and inland dunes with vegetation and cover.\nLabidura cryptera is an omnivorous insect and very generalistic when it comes to feeding. It will eat plant matter, hunt smaller insects and larvae, and also eat decaying matter. due to its willingness to eat insects and decaying matter, Labidura cryptera plays an essential role in agriculture, as many farmers will use it as pest control.\n\n\n== Nesting and life cycle ==\nWhen the time comes, female specimens will find a dark covered area usually under a rock or tree bark, and using its specialized mouth parts, it will begin digging a nesting chamber that will serve multiple purposes, such as laying eggs and as a safe place to molt. Females lay eggs one at a time and usually lay around 30-50 eggs at once and are arranged in a cluster. The female will guard and groom the eggs while also collecting food for herself and for when the eggs hatch. After around 10 days, the eggs begin to hatch and the mother will maintain and protect the nymphs until they become independent and can leave the nest. Females can repeat this process up to three times in their lifetime.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Vidya Madhavan is an Indian American physicist who is Professor of Condensed Matter at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Her research considers the spin and charge of quantum materials. She combines high resolution characterization techniques with precise fabrication and growth techniques. She was elected Fellow of the American Physical Society in 2015.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nMadhavan studied metallurgical engineering at the Indian Institutes of Technology. She remained there for her graduate studies, where she worked on solid state physics and materials science. She moved to the United States for her doctoral research, where she joined Boston University. After earning her PhD, Madhavan joined the University of California, Berkeley as a postdoctoral researcher.\n\n\n== Research and career ==\nIn 2002, Madhavan was appointed to the faculty at Boston College, where she found that phonons (lattice vibrations) were involved in superconductivity. She moved to the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign as a professor in 2014. Her research considers the interaction between spin, charge and structure in quantum materials. She has developed (spin-polarized) scanning tunnelling microscopy to understand emergent phenomena in unconventional superconductors, topological systems and two-dimensional materials. She has studied unconventional superconductors (with a focus on chiral superconductors), which maintain their superconductivity when in the presence of high magnetic fields likely due to the presence of Majorana particles on their surfaces. Madhavan used STM to identify these Majorana quasiparticles on the surface of uranium ditelluride.\nTopological insulators exhibit spin momentum locking, a quantum phenomenon in which the spin of an electron depends on its direction of travel. Madhavan has observed spin-polarized tunnelling in anti-feromagnets.\nMadhavan has pursued quantum systems with long lifetimes for quantum information science. She is particularly interested in Mott insulators, which can be fabricated using exfoliation and controlled using lithography. She has demonstrated that they can achieve lifetimes of a few seconds at room temperature.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n2015 Elected Fellow of the American Physical Society\nFellow of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research\n2020 Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation Fellow\n2023 Appointed Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\nMadhavan V V; Chen W; Jamneala T; Crommie MF; Wingreen NS (1 April 1998). \"Tunneling into a single magnetic atom: spectroscopic evidence of the kondo resonance\".

        "content": "The Niagara Falls Cataracts were a Canadian minor professional ice hockey team located in Niagara Falls, Ontario. The franchise played for four seasons with the first three coming in the Canadian Professional Hockey League. In 1929, the league was reformed as the International Hockey League.\n\n\n== History ==\nNiagara was one of the founding members of the CPHL in 1926 which consisted entirely of Canadian teams from southern Ontario. The team was rather unsuccessful, finishing last in the league in two out of three seasons. Despite their struggles, the Cataracts joined the rest of the league members in 1929 by dissolving the CPHL and reforming in the International Hockey League. Niagara once again finished last in the standings and decided to call it quits after the season.\nDuring their final season, tragedy befell a member of the team when Edward Baker was fatally injured during a game. On January 9, against the Buffalo Bisons, Baker collided with his teammate, Lloyd Gross and suffered a skull fracture as a result. Baker remained conscious and skated off of the ice under his own power. He was later taken to a local hospital where he died the following morning at the age of 26. His death was ruled to have been accidental and no inquest was held.\nFormer NHL star and Hockey Hall of Famer Newsy Lalonde coached Niagara Falls during the 1928–29 season.\n\n\n== Season-by-season record ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Internet Hockey Database",

        "content": "Air Marshal Darren James Goldie,  (born 1975) is a senior officer in the Royal Australian Air Force. He joined the RAAF through the Australian Defence Force Academy in 1993 and gained his pilot's wings in 1997. He has deployed on operations to East Timor, Iraq and Afghanistan, and has commanded No. 37 Squadron RAAF (2012–15) and No. 92 Wing RAAF (2017–18). He was Air Commander Australia from April 2022 to June 2023, and served as the inaugural National Cyber Security Coordinator from July to November 2023.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nGoldie was raised on the Gold Coast of Queensland and educated at The Southport School, where he was a member of the Australian Air Force Cadets.\n\n\n== RAAF career ==\nGoldie entered the Australian Defence Force Academy as a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) officer cadet in 1993. He graduated from the academy with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Studies in 1995 and was posted for flying training, gaining his pilot's wings in 1997. He was then appointed to No. 37 Squadron RAAF, operating the Lockheed C-130 Hercules, and flew on operations in East Timor. After serving as aide-de-camp to the Chief of the Defence Force from 2000 to 2001, Goldie returned to No. 37 Squadron as a flight commander and served on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nGoldie was appointed the Air Force Pilot HR Manager in 2007 and then, in 2008, became Staff Officer VIP Operations, responsible for the air transport of royalty, visiting dignitaries and government officials, including the prime minister and governor-general. For his \"outstanding achievement\" in this role, Goldie was awarded the Conspicuous Service Cross in the 2012 Australia Day Honours. He graduated with a Masters of Management from the University of New South Wales in 2010 and a Masters of Strategic Studies from the USAF Air War College in 2012, before being appointed commanding officer of No. 37 Squadron in July that year. Goldie's squadron oversaw 650 personnel and a fleet of twelve C-130J Hercules aircraft, which were engaged in domestic and overseas operations and included a detachment posted to the Middle East Area of Operations. In January 2013, as pilot of a C-130J, Goldie was involved in the successful search-and-rescue of French yachtsman Alain Delord, who was located approximately 500 nautical miles (930 km) south of Tasmania. Goldie and his crew received a Chief of Joint Operations Gold Commendation for their role in the rescue. In recognition of both his command of the squadron and \"exceptional service ... in airlift operations\", Goldie was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia in the 2015 Australia Day Honours.\nGoldie was made Director Military Strategic Commitments in 2015, Officer Commanding No. 92 Wing RAAF in 2017, and Director General Air Combat Capability in 2018. In 2020 he was seconded to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, serving as Assistant Secretary of Global Interests in the International Division and providing strategic advice on foreign policy to the Australian government. Goldie returned to the RAAF in 2022 and succeeded Air Vice-Marshal Joe Iervasi as Air Commander Australia that April, with responsibility for the training and operational preparedness of 12,000 personnel in the operational arm of the RAAF. Goldie handed over the role to Air Vice-Marshal Glen Braz in June 2023.\nIn July 2023 Goldie was promoted to air marshal and appointed the inaugural National Cyber Security Coordinator. The role was created in the Department of Home Affairs to oversee Australia's cyber security policy and to coordinate the government's strategic response to cyber security threats. Goldie served in the role for only four months. He was recalled to the Department of Defence in November \"to deal with a workplace matter\" arising from \"a complaint concerning [Goldie's] alleged past behaviour\" in the RAAF. The Deputy Secretary of Cyber and Infrastructure Security, Hamish Hansford, was appointed acting National Cyber Security Coordinator in the interim, until Goldie was formally replaced by Lieutenant General Michelle McGuinness in February 2024.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nGoldie is married to Kirsty, a nurse in the RAAF, and has two children.\n\n\n== References ==",

She is a three time Pan American Games gold medalist.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nThalita began practicing gymnastics at the age of seven, after her teacher saw her playing and noticed her abilities for the sport. By age 14 she was part of the Brazilian national team.\nShe was selected to compete at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney in the group competition alongside Natália Scherer, Flávia de Faria, Alessandra Ferezin, Dayane Camilo and Camila Ferezin. They placed 7th in the qualifying round and 8th in the final. This was the first time Brazil's group qualified for the Olympics.\nIn 2003, she was part of the group that repeated the gold medal in the All-Around at the Pan American Games in Santo Domingo, adding another two in the finals with 5 ribbons and 3 hoops & 2 balls. She competed in the 2003 World Championships in Budapest, where Brazil took 9th place, one position below the spot for the Olympic Games, but the country secured classification based on the technical index.\nAlthough she was a starter in the group, she chose not to compete in the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens and retired from competitive sport at the age of 18. After leaving competitions, she graduated in physical education.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Gilberte Montavon de Courgenay  (20 March 1896 – 2 May 1957) was a Swiss waitress who became a national symbol of spiritual national defense during World War I and World War II. She entertained Swiss Army troops at the Hôtel de Gare in Courgenay, which was owned by her family, and became popular with the soldiers. In 1917, the composer and folklorist Hanns In der Gand gave a concert at the hotel and performed his new song La petite Gilberte, written about Montavon. The song was adopted by the army to boost morale throughout the war. Montavon inspired Rudolph Bolo Mäglin's 1939 novel Gilberte de Courgenay and his play of the same name. Two films, August Kern's Marguerite et les soldates in 1940 and Franz Schnyder's Gilberte de Courgenay in 1941, were based on her life.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMontavon was born on 20 March 1896 in Courgenay to Gustave Montavon, a watchmaker and hotelier, and Lucine Laville. She was born on the first floor of her family home on Fontaine-Allée. She had two older sisters, Fernande and Camille, and two younger brothers, Gustave and Paul.\nMontavon was sent to a boarding school in German-speaking Alemania for her education. In 1914, Montavon returned from school, due to the war, and began working as a waitress at her parent's hotel, the Hôtel de Gare.\n\n\n== National symbol ==\n\nDuring World War I, she entertained Swiss Army soldiers who were stationed in Ajoie, including many Swiss-German speakers. She was fluent in Swiss-French and Swiss German and would serve as a translator between the German-speaking troops and the French-speaking municipal officials. She would also repair uniforms and play the piano for soldiers visiting the hotel.\n\nIn 1915, the composer and folklorist Hanns In der Gand visited Courgenay to collect popular songs to pass on to the troops. On 11 October 1917, In der Gand gave a concert at the Hôtel de Gare where he performed his song about Montavon titled Le petite Gilberte de Courgenay in German and French. The song was adopted by the Swiss Army to boost morale throughout the war.\nIn 1939, Rudolph Bolo Mäglin wrote a novel based on Montavon, titled Gilberte de Courgenay, and a stage play of the same name that was performed at the Schauspielhaus Zürich and in Basel. In 1940, August Kern produced the film Marguerite et les soldates, loosely based on Montavon. In 1941, the filmmaker Franz Schnyder made a film, Gilberte de Courgenay, based on Mäglin's novel. She was portrayed by Anne-Marie Blanc in the film.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nIn 1923, Montavon married Louis Schneider, a businessman from St. Gallen, in a Catholic ceremony at Mariastein Abbey in Metzerlen-Mariastein. The couple moved to Zürich, where they lived at Bergstrasse 122. Gilberte gave birth to a daughter, Jeanne. The family moved to another house, located at Bionstrasse 10, where they settled permanently.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nMontavon died in Zürich on 2 May 1957 and was buried at the Friedhof Nordheim.\nA street and a bus station in Courgenay are named after her. In 1995, the filmmaker Jacqueline Veuve dedicated an episode of her television series, Ma rue histoire, to Montavon.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Choma Solar Power Station is a solar power plant, under development in Zambia, with generation capacity of 60 megawatts and an attached 20 MWh battery energy storage system (BESS). The privately owned solar farm is being developed by a joint venture company, comprising \"YEO Teknoloji Enerji ve Endustri AS\" (YEO), a  Turkish energy company and \"GEI Power Limited\", a Zambian independent power producer (IPP). The off-taker is ZESCO (Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation Limited), the national electricity utility, under a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA).\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe power station would located in Choma District, in the Southen Province of Zambia. Choma, the district headquarters is located approximately 285 kilometres (177 mi), southwest of Lusaka, the national capital and the largest city in the country.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThis solar farm is the first grid-ready photovoltaic solar installation with an attached BESS in the country. The design calls for a ground-mounted solar panel layout, with maximum generation capacity of 60 megawatts. An attached 20 MWh BESS, based on lithium-battery technology will be incorporated in the design to allow the station to supply power even when sun is not up.\n\n\n== Developers ==\nThe developers/owners of this power station have formed a special purpose vehicle (SPV) company to own, design, develop, construct, operate and maintain this power station. The name of the SPV company is Choma Solar Power Plant Limited. The ownership of the SPV company is as outlined in the table below.\n\n\n== Construction costs and timeline ==\nThe construction costs for the power station are reported as US$65 million. Construction is expected to begin in 2024, with commercial commissioning expected in September 2025. As of May 2024, the necessary feasibility, grid impact and environmental impact assessment studies had been concluded.\n\n\n== Other considerations ==\nAs of April 2024, Zambia had installed generation capacity of 3,030 MW, of which 2,393 MW (79 percent) was derived from hydroelectric sources. Due to severe drought in the sub-region in recent months, the river levels are low and Zambian electricity output is low. As of February 2024, Zambia was grappling with a 500 MW deficit in electricity supply. This solar farm is expected to help to partially mitigate that shortage.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of power stations in Zambia\nZambia Riverside Solar Power Station\nItimpi Solar Power Station\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nZambia-Turkey partnership kicks off sustainable energy revolution: GEI Power and YEO to build $65 million solar power plant",

        "content": "Eunpyeong A (Korean: 은평구 갑)  is a constituency of the National Assembly of South Korea. The constituency consists of parts of Eunpyeong District, Seoul. As of 2024, 219,044 eligible voters were registered in the constituency. The constituency was created in 1988 from the Seodaemun–Eunpyeong constituency.\n\n\n== History ==\nSince its establishment, Eunpyeong A has elected members of the Democratic Party and predecessor parties in all but two elections and is thus regarded as a stronghold for the Democratic Party.\nOh Yu-bang of the right-wing Democratic Justice Party was the first member to represent the constituency, narrowly defeating Cho Dong-hoe of the Peace Democratic Party. Oh was succeeded by Son Sae-il of the centrist-liberal Democratic Party after losing re-election in the 1992 election. Son won re-election in 1996, defeating Kang In-sop of the centre-right Grand National Party. Son was defeated by Kang In-sop in the following election by a margin of around 5,000 votes, marking the last time a conservative party candidate won in Eunpyeong A. In the 2004 election, Lee Mi-kyung of the liberal Uri Party won the seat, securing 51.79% of the vote. Lee won re-election in 2008 and 2012, receiving 45.82 and 49.05% of the vote respectively.\nAhead of the 2016 South Korean legislative election, the Democratic Party then led by Kim Chong-in, did not re-nominate incumbent Lee Mi-kyung for the Eunpyeong A constituency. The party instead nominated lawyer Park Joo-min as its candidate on March 20, 2016. Park went on to win the general election with 54.93% of the vote, defeating opponents Choi Hong-jae and Choi Sang-hyeon of the Saenuri Party and Labor Party respectively. Park won re-election in a landslide in 2020, securing 64.29% of the vote and defeating United Future Party opponent Hong In-jung. The 2024 election saw rematch between incumbent Park Joo-min and Hong In-jung; Park won re-election with 60.78% of the vote.\n\n\n== Boundaries ==\nThe constituency consists of the neighborhoods of Nokbeon-dong, Yeokchon-dong, Jeungsan-dong, Sinsa-dong, Eungam-dong, Susaek-dong. It borders the constituencies of Eunpyeong B to the north, Goyang B to the west, Mapo B to the southwest, Seodaemun B to the south, and Jongno to the east.\n\n\n== List of members of the National Assembly ==\n\n\n== Election results ==\n\n\n=== 2024 ===\n\n\n=== 2020 ===\n\n\n=== 2016 ===\n\n\n=== 2012 ===\n\n\n=== 2008 ===\n\n\n=== 2004 ===\n\n\n=== 2000 ===\n\n\n=== 1996 ===\n\n\n=== 1992 ===\n\n\n=== 1988 ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of constituencies of the National Assembly of South Korea\n\n\n== References ==",

He was born on 4 June 1783 at Newton, his father's property, on the banks of the Dee, Aberdeenshire. He passed through the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and obtaining a commission in the corps of Royal Engineers joined at Portsmouth as second lieutenant in March 1800. He was promoted lieutenant the following year, and in 1803 was sent to Ceylon, where he served for nine years. He returned to England in August 1812 with the rank of captain, and in September was sent to Spain to join the Duke of Wellington's army operating in the Peninsula. He distinguished himself at the Siege of San Sebastián, for which he was mentioned in despatches and received the gold medal; he also took part in the battles of the Nive, Nivelle and Orthez, for which he received the war medal with two clasps. At the close of the war he was stationed in Ireland and, after his marriage, in Canada till 1819, when he returned to England. He attained the rank of lieutenant-colonel on 30 December 1824, and retired from the service on 9 April 1825. In 1830 he devoted himself to the formation of the London and South Western Railway Company, and was connected with that line, first as general superintendent, and subsequently as director, from its commencement until his death in Southampton on 21 April 1855. In May 1837 he was elected an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers. For some years prior to his death he was chairman both of the London Equitable Gas Company and of the Southampton Gas Company.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Vetch, Robert Hamilton (1891). \"Henderson, George\".

        "content": "Sir Robert Grant  (10 August 1837 – 8 January 1904) was a British lieutenant-general and royal engineer.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nGrant was born at Malabar Hill, Bombay, on 10 August 1837, was younger son of Sir Robert Grant, governor of Bombay, and was nephew of Lord Glenelg. His mother was Margaret (d. 1885), only daughter of Sir David Davidson of Cantray, Nairnshire, N.B., who married as her second husband Lord Josceline William Percy, M.P., second son of George fifth duke of Northumberland.\nRobert was educated at Harrow with his elder brother Charles [see below]. When he was seventeen he passed first in a public competitive examination for vacancies in the royal artillery and the royal engineers caused by the Crimean war, and was gazetted second lieutenant in the royal engineers on 23 October 1854, becoming first lieutenant on 13 December of the same year. After six months' training at Chatham Grant was sent to Scotland. In February 1857 he was transferred to the Jamaica command in the West Indies, and at the end of 1858 he served on the staff as fort adjutant at Belise in British Honduras. He passed first in the examination for the Staff College, just established; but after a few months there (Jan.–May 1859) he was aide-de-camp to Lieut.-general Sir William Fenwick Williams, the commander of the forces in North America for six years. On 8 August 1860 he was promoted second captain. He was at home for the final examination at the Staff College, in which he again easily passed first, despite his absence from the classes, and from January to June 1861 he was attached to the cavalry and artillery at Aldershot.\nFinally returning from Canada in June 1865, Grant did duty at Chatham, Dover, and Portsmouth, and was promoted first captain on 10 July 1867 and major on 5 July 1872. From 1 January 1871 to 1877 he was deputy assistant adjutant-general for royal engineers at the war office, and from 1877 was in command of the royal engineers troops, consisting of the pontoon, telegraph, equipment and depot units at Aldershot. He was promoted lieut.-colonel on 1 July 1878. In May 1880 he was appointed commanding royal engineer of the Plymouth subdistrict, and on 31 December 1881 commanding royal engineer of the Woolwich district. He was promoted colonel in the army on 1 July 1882, and a year later was placed on half pay. He remained unemployed until 5 May 1884, when he was given the R.E. command in Scotland, with the rank of colonel on the staff.\nOn 20 March 1885 he left Edinburgh suddenly for Egypt to join Lord Wolseley, who had telegraphed for his services, as colonel on the staff and commanding royal engineer with the Nile expeditionary force. He served with the headquarters staff and afterwards in command of the Abu Fatmeh district during the evacuation, but he was taken seriously ill with fever and was invalided home in August. For his services he was mentioned in despatches of 13 June 1885 (Lond. Gazette, 25 August 1885). Not anticipating so speedy a termination to the campaign, the authorities had filled up his appointment in Scotland and he had to wait nearly a year on half pay.\nOn 1 July 1886 Grant was appointed deputy adjutant-general for royal engineers at the war office. On 25 May 1889 he was created C.B., military division, and on 23 October made a temporary major-general. Before he had quite completed his five years as deputy adjutant-general Grant was appointed to the important post of inspector-general of fortifications (18 April 1891), with the temporary rank of lieut.-general, dated 29 April 1891. He succeeded to the establishment of major-generals on 9 May 1891, and became lieut.-general on 4 June 1897. As inspector-general of fortifications Grant was an ex-officio member of the joint naval and military committee on defence, and president of the colonial defence committee. During his term of office important works of defence and of barrack construction were carried out, under the loan for defences and military works loan. His services were so highly valued that they were retained for two years beyond the usual term. He was promoted K.C.B. on 20 May 1896. On leaving the war office (17 April 1898) Grant's work was highly commended by the secretaries of state for war and the colonies, and he was awarded a distinguished service pension of 100l. a year. He was given the G.C.B. on 26 June 1902, and retired from the service on 28 March 1903. His health was failing, and he died on 8 January 1904 at his residence, 14 Granville Place, Portman Square, London, and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery.\nAlways cool and self-contained, Grant was gifted with a sure judgment and a retentive memory. A portrait in oils by C. Lutyens, painted in 1897, hangs in the R.E. officers' mess at Aldershot, and a replica was in Lady Grant's possession. She also had a portrait in oils of Sir Robert Grant by Henty, painted in 1887. He married in London, on 24 November 1875, Victoria Alexandrina, daughter of John Cotes of Woodcote Hall, Shropshire, and widow of T. Owen of Condover Hall in the same county. There were three children of the marriage, a daughter who died young, and twin sons, both in the army, of whom the younger, Robert Josceline, was killed at Spion Kop on 24 January 1900.\nSir Charles Grant (1836–1903), elder brother of Sir Robert Grant, was born in 1836, and educated at Harrow, Trinity College, Cambridge, and at Haileybury. He entered the Bengal civil service in 1858, was appointed a commissioner of the central provinces in 1870, and acting chief commissioner in 1879, when he became an additional member of the governor-general's council. In 1880 he was acting secretary to the government of India for the home, revenue, and agricultural departments, and in 1881 was appointed foreign secretary to the government of India. He was created C.S.I. in 1881, and in 1885 K.C.S.I. on retirement. He died suddenly in London on 10 April 1903. He married: (1) in 1872 Ellen (d. 1885), daughter of the Rt. Hon. Henry Baillie of Redcastle, N.B.; and (2) in 1890 Lady Florence Lucia, daughter of Admiral Sir Edward Alfred John Harris, and sister of the fourth earl of Malmesbury. She was raised to the rank of an earl's daughter in 1890. Sir Charles Grant edited the 'Central Provinces Gazetteer' (2nd edit. 1870).\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Vetch, Robert Hamilton (1912). \"Grant, Robert (1837-1904)\".

        "content": "Komaba Junior and Senior High School, University of Tsukuba (筑波大学附属駒場中学校・高等学校) is a national boys' school located in Ikejiri, Setagaya, near Komaba. It is better known by the abbreviation Tsukukoma (筑駒). Tsukukoma is affiliated with the University of Tsukuba and provides six-year secondary education programmes. Tsukukoma is the only national boys' school in Japan and is regarded as one of the most selective secondary educational institutions in the country.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nIn 1947, Tsukukoma was established as a new junior high school affiliated with the former Tokyo Agricultural School. It was later renamed Komaba Junior and Senior High School, affiliated with Tokyo University of Education in 1952, and then, in 1978, it came under the purview of the University of Tsukuba, which replaced Tokyo University of Education that year. Although it is an affiliated school of the University of Tsukuba, very few students choose to study at the university after graduation.\nKnown for its liberal school spirit, the school has no uniforms for both junior and senior high students. It is located on the site of the former Komaba Agricultural School and maintains a tradition of rice cultivation training in paddy fields, known at the school as 'Kernel Paddy'. In its vicinity there are Komaba Toho Junior and Senior High School, Tokyo Metropolitan Komaba High School, Komaba Gakuen High School, and Nihon University Komaba Junior and Senior High School.\nTsukukoma is one of the largest sources of successful applicants to the University of Tokyo, which is generally regarded as the nation's most selective and prestigious university. The school is located on a hill approximately 700 metres south of the Komaba Campus, University of Tokyo, which mainly accommodates first and second-year undergraduates.\n\n\n== Notable alumni ==\n\n\n=== Politicians ===\nHiroyuki Hosoda\nShigeyuki Goto\nYasuhiro Hanashi\nAkira Koike\nKen Saito\nYoshihide Yoshida (Chief of Staff of the Self-Defence Forces of Japan)\n\n\n=== Scholars ===\nShinichi Mochizuki (mathematician, did not attend the high school and moved to the United States instead)\nKazuo Ueda (economist, Govenor of the Bank of Japan)\nHaruhiko Kuroda (Govenor of the Bank of Japan)\nFuhito Kojima (economist)\nMasaru Kaneko (economist)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Cornubian Massif was an upland area and source of sediment in southwest England during parts of the Late Permian to Early Cretaceous period and through most of the Cenozoic. In extent it covered approximately the current area of Devon and Cornwall.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Cornubian Massif is underpinned by the extensive granitic Cornubian batholith that was intruded into Variscan thrust sheets of low-grade metamorphic rocks over a period of about 25 million years, between 300 and 275 Ma (million years ago), during the Early Permian. Related volcanism produced both acid and basic lavas, although only the latter are partly preserved within the lowermost parts of the Exeter Group, with the acid lavas only found as clasts in younger rocks, apart from one small exposure near Kingsand.\nThe unroofing of the batholith had already started in the Late Permian, as shown by the presence of granitic clasts in  the St. Cyres beds. During the later Permian to Triassic the massif was bordered by a set of rift basins. To the north lay the Bristol Channel Basin, extending westwards into the South Celtic Sea Basin, to the east the precursor to the Wessex Basin and to the south the Plymouth Bay Basin. It is unclear to what extent the higher parts of the massif were covered by Permo-Triassic deposits. Latest Triassic to Lower Jurassic times saw a regional marine transgression, that may have covered much of the massif, although an emergent \"spine\" of land was probably still present.\nDuring the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous, rifting restarted in the basins surrounding the massif. Particularly the development of thick growth sequences in the Wealden Group show that the rifting reached a maximum at this time. The massif was actively uplifting during this period providing a source for coarse clastic sediments as seen in the Wessex Basin.\nDuring the Late Cretaceous, rifting stopped and sea levels rose, clastic sediments were cut off as the fine-grained Chalk Group was deposited. To the east of the massif there is evidence of progressive westward onlap of the Upper Cretaceous sequence onto the older rocks and it is thought likely that the whole of the massif was eventually submerged.\nDuring the latest Cretaceous, southern Britain was affected by the early stages of the Alpine orogeny. This is marked by some indications of basin inversion and regional uplift, as shown by a lack of Maastrichtian (uppermost Cretaceous) and Danian (lowermost Paleocene) strata onshore. The opening of the North Atlantic Ocean at the start of the Eocene was accompanied by the development of the North Atlantic Igneous Province. In western Britain this caused uplift, possibly due to underplating, as shown by Apatite fission track analysis with up to 300 m of uplift in western Cornwall, reducing to 50 m in south Devon. The main phase of Alpine deformation occurred during the Oligocene to Miocene, when structures such as the Portland-Wight Monocline and the Wealden Dome were formed.\nAs shown by the current form of the southwestern peninsula, the area of the massif remains mostly a relatively uplifted region, shedding sediment into the surrounding basinal areas. The current topography is thought to represent an amalgamation of erosion surfaces of varying origin acquired during its Cenozoic history.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2024 Championship League is an upcoming professional ranking snooker tournament that will take place from 10 June to 3 July 2024 at the Leicester Arena in Leicester, England. The event will feature 128 players and will be played as three rounds of round‑robin groups of four, before a best‑of‑five final. It will be the fifth edition of the ranking version of the Championship League, and the first ranking tournament of the 2024‍–‍25 season.\nShaun Murphy is the defending champion, having defeated Mark Williams 3‍–‍0 in the final of the previous ranking edition of the tournament.\n\n\n== Tournament format ==\nThe 2024 Championship League will take place from 10 June to 3 July 2023 at the Leicester Arena in Leicester, England. 128 players will take part in the event. The competition begins with 32 rounds of group matches with each group consisting of four players. Two groups are to be played to a finish every day during four blocks using a two‑table setup in the arena. The groups are to be contested using a round‑robin format, with six matches played in each group. All matches in group play are played as best of four frames, with three points awarded for a win and one point for a draw. Group positions are determined by points scored, frame difference and then head‑to‑head results between players who are tied. Places that are still tied are then determined by the highest break made in the group. If the highest break is also tied, the next highest break made by the players will be used.\nThe 32 players that top the group tables qualify for the group winners' stage, consisting of eight groups of four players. The eight winners from the group winners' stage qualify for the two final groups, with the final taking place later on the same day. The winner takes the Championship League title and a place in the Champion of Champions.\n\n\n=== Prize fund ===\nThe breakdown of prize money for the tournament is shown below.\n\nTournament total: £328,000\nNote: The champion receives a total of £33,000 (£3,000 + £4,000 + £6,000 + £20,000).\n\n\n== Stage one ==\nStage one consists of 32 groups, each containing four players.\n\n\n=== Order of

        "content": "Sir John Fretcheville Dykes Donnelly  (2 July 1834 – 5 April 1902) was a British major-general and royal engineer.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nDonnelly was born in the Bay of Bombay on 2 July 1834. He was the only child of Lieutenant-colonel Thomas Donnelly (1802–1881), at one time deputy adjutant-general of the Bombay army, and from 1851 staff captain and afterwards staff officer at the East India Company's military college at Addiscombe until the closing of the college in 1861 (see Vibart's Addiscombe, with portrait). His mother was Jane Christiana, second daughter of Joseph Ballantine Dykes of Dovenby Hall, Cumberland. Educated at Highgate School (1843–8), he entered the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich at the head of the list after a year's private tuition in August 1849, passed out first, and received a commission as second-lieutenant in the royal engineers on 23 June 1853, and after professional instruction at Chatham was promoted first-lieutenant on 17 February. Going out to the Crimea in June, Donnelly joined his corps on its march to Balaklava on 23 September, and next month was detailed for duty with the left attack on Sevastopol. He was present at the battle of Inkerman on 5 November, and subsequently worked in the trenches before Sevastopol with an energy to which Sir John Burgoyne called Lord Raglan's attention (21 November). Through the severe weather of the winter of 1854-5 he was on duty in the trenches forty-one times by day and forty-three times by night. On the day after the abortive assault on the Redan (18 June), when he was with the second column, he by his promptitude and zeal obtained a substantial lodgment in the Russian rifle pits at the Little Mamelon. Donnelly was mentioned in Lord Raglan's despatches for this service. Soon after the fall of Sevastopol in September during which he was thrice in all mentioned in despatches (London Gazette, 18 December), he was appointed aide-de-camp to Colonel E. T. Lloyd on 12 November 1855, the commanding royal engineer in the Crimea, and accompanied him home in June 1856. He received the Crimea medal with clasps for Inkerman and Sevastopol, the Turkish medal, and the 5th class of the legion of honour. He had been recommended for the Victoria Cross without result, and received no promotion nor British distinction.\nJoining the London military district in 1856, he was placed in command of a detachment of royal sappers and miners employed in preparing for building purposes the ground purchased at South Kensington out of the surplus funds of the Great Exhibition of 1851. It was intended to erect there a permanent museum and centre of science and art. Sir Henry Cole, the director of the scheme, secured Donnelly's services on 1 April 1858 in reorganising at South Kensington the science and art department, which was controlled by the privy council's committee of education. On 1 October 1859 he was appointed inspector for science in connection with the department. He had been promoted second captain on 1 April 1859, and was now seconded in his corps for ten years. But he did not return to regimental duty, and the rest of his career was identified with South Kensington. In 1869 he was allowed two and a half years' special leave, and in 1872 was placed on the reserve list. His promotion continued, as he was still liable for emergency service, and he became lieutenant-colonel on 1 October 1877 and brevet-colonel on 1 October 1881, retiring with the honorary rank of major-general on 31 December 1887.\nThe success of the scheme for national instruction in science and art was largely due to Donnelly, although some of his methods came to be reckoned reactionary. In agreement with a much controverted principle he arranged (by minute of 1859) that grants should be made to certificated teachers on the results of the examinations of their pupils. Prizes were at the same time to be awarded to successful students, whether trained in recognised schools or otherwise. He obtained due recognition for drawing and manual training as class subjects, and having induced the Society of Arts, which he joined in 1860, to form a class in wood-carving, he procured from City companies and other sources funds to carry it on as the School of Art Wood-carving, which is now located in Thurloe Place, South Kensington.\nIn 1874 his title at South Kensington became 'Director of Science,' and his duties included the supervision not only of the science schools and classes throughout the country but of other important scientific institutions like the Government School of Mines, the Museum of Practical Geology, the Royal College of Chemistry, the Edinburgh Museum of Science and Art, and the Museum of Irish Industry, which developed into the Royal College of Science for Ireland. In 1868, as a member of a commission appointed to consider the question, he had drafted a report adverse to the establishment of a separate department of science and art for Ireland. In 1881 he was appointed in addition assistant secretary of the science and art department, and in 1884 secretary and permanent head of the department. Joining the council of the Society of Arts in 1870, he was mainly responsible in 1871 for the society's scheme of technological examinations, out of which by his advice the City Guilds Institute for technical education was developed. As chairman of the council of the Society of Arts in 1894 and 1895, he led the society to organise the International Congress on Technical Education in 1897.\nFor many years the museums of science and art at Kensington had been housed in temporary and straggling makeshift galleries and sheds, and Donnelly was untiring in his efforts to secure parliamentary grants for the erection of permanent buildings. In 1896 the House of Commons appointed a select committee on whose report in 1899 a sum of 800,000l. was voted to complete the museums. In the course of the inquiry Donnelly's administration was called in question (see Report and Evidence of Committee of House of Commons on the Museums of the Science and Art Department, 1899). Whatever the defects of the educational policy pursued, the study of science grew immensely under Donnelly's direction. In 1859 the total number of science students was under 400; ten years later there were over 1400 classes comprising 25,000 students, while at the time of Donnelly's death these numbers were increased eight-fold. In accordance with the civil service rule he retired on 2 July 1899 on attaining the age of sixty-five. A minute of the privy council dated the following day animadverted on the committee's Report, stating that the sole responsibility lay on their lordships for the administration of the Science and Art Department, wluch had been loyally carried out by Colonel Donnelly and his staff, in whom they retained the fullest confidence. Sir John Gorst, vice-president of the committee of council on education, when presenting Donnelly with a testimonial from 500 of the South Kensington staff (29 November), warmly defended him from adverse criticism, and Sir John presided at a complimentary dinner given by his old colleagues (12 December).\nDonnelly was made C.B. in 1886 and K.C.B. (civil) in 1893. In 1888 he was elected a member of the Athenaeum under Rule II. He was no mean artist, and from 1888 to 1901 he exhibited water-colour paintings and etchings at the Royal Academy or the New Gallery. In 1888 he took part in the formation of the committee for the preservation of the monuments of ancient Egypt. He wrote two pamphlets, on 'The Employment of Iron Shields in Siege Operations' (1868), and on 'Army Organisation' (1869) in which he advocated personal service.\nHe died on 5 April 1902 at his residence, 59 Onslow Gardens, London, and was buried at Brompton cemetery.\nA portrait in oils by H. T. Wells, R.A. (exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1901), and a charcoal head by Sir E. J. Poynter, P.R.A., were in Lady Donnelly's possession. Donnelly was twice married : (1) at Bridekirk, Cumberland, on 5 January 1871, to his first cousin Adeliza (d. 1873), second daughter of Fretcheville Lawson Ballantine Dykes of Dovenby Hall, Cumberland; by her he had two daughters; (2) at Neuchatel, Switzerland, on 17 December 1881, to his first wife's elder sister, Mary Frances Dykes; by her he had two sons, Thomas and Gordon Harvey, both lieutenants in the royal garrison artillery, and a daughter.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Vetch, Robert Hamilton (1912). \"Donnelly, John Fretcheville Dykes\".

        "content": "Thomas Matthias Weguelin (died 23 May 1828) was an English soldier.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nWeguelin born at Moorfields in London. He was the eldest son of John Christopher Weguelin by his second wife, Elizabeth. He was appointed a cadet in the East India Company's service in March 1781 on the Bengal presidency. He arrived in Calcutta in April 1782, having previously been promoted to an ensigncy on 16 June 1781. He joined the third European regiment at Burhánpur, and received a lieutenant's commission on 22 September 1782. In November he was removed to the first battalion of the 22nd native infantry, at the frontier station of Fatehgarh in the dominions of the nawáb of Oudh. In March 1783 he proceeded to the Farukhábád district, where he took part in some petty operations, and in 1796, when his regiment was incorporated with the 2nd native infantry, he received the brevet rank of captain. He served against Tipú Saib from 1790 to 1792 with Lieutenant-colonel John Cockrell's detachment. He took part in the battle of Seringapatam on 13 May 1791, in the assault on the enemy's entrenched camp on 6 February 1792, and in the siege of the city. In December 1797 he was transferred to the first battalion of the 13th native infantry, which he commanded in 1799 during the deposition of the nawáb of Oudh, and shortly after joined the 1st European regiment at Cawnpur, removing with it to Dinápur at the close of the year. On 10 August 1801 he received the regimental rank of captain, and in September 1803 he proceeded in command of the flank companies of his regiment to join the army under Lord Lake, then engaged with the Marattas in the north-west, where he took part in the siege of Gwalior. In September 1804 he accompanied Lake's army in the capacity of judge-advocate-general in the field provinces north and west of Allahábád, and took part in the siege of Bhartpur. He continued to hold the post until his appointment to a majority on 3 March 1808. In June he was nominated to command an expedition for the defence of the Portuguese of Macao against any French attempt, receiving the local rank of colonel. On his return to Bengal in February 1809 he received the thanks of the governor-general for his conduct. On the establishment of the commissariat in Bengal on 1 February 1810 Weguelin was appointed deputy commissary-general. He accompanied Major-general Sir John Abercromby in the expedition against Mauritius in 1810 as head of the commissariat department, and after the reduction of the island was appointed by the governor, Sir Robert Townsend Farquhar, commissary-general of Mauritius, Bourbon, and their dependencies. He returned to Bengal in March 1812 with a letter from Farquhar to the governor in council expressing his approbation of his services. On 1 July 1812 he was nominated commissary-general of Bengal with the rank of lieutenant-colonel, attaining the regimental rank on 16 March 1814. He discharged the duties of commissary-general through the two wars with Nepál between 1814 and 1816, and that with the Pindáris from 1816 to 1818, conducting the business of his office with so much ability that the extra expenses of the wars did not exceed the comparatively small sum of 600,000l. Being obliged by private affairs to return to England, he resigned his office at the close of 1820, embarking in January 1822. He received the rank of colonel commandant on 20 July 1823, and died in London at Montagu Square on 23 May 1828. He was twice married. By his first wife he had a son and a daughter, and by his second wife three sons.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Carlyle, Edward Irving (1899). \"Weguelin, Thomas Matthias\".

        "content": "Fiat ESVs (Experimental Safety Vehicle) are a small series of prototypes built by Fiat in the early 1970s, intended for research on passive safety features.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn Spring 1971, Fiat starts a project to research passive safety of small (up to 1,200 lb, 540 kg) and middle class cars (up to 1,800 lb, 820 kg). In that year, the Fiat 500 has a 23.3% market share in Italy, and thus is an important factor in the safety on the Italian roads. In the same year, the American organization NHSB - National Highway Safety Bureau (later known as National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, NHTSA) launches a competition reserved for American manufacturers, for the construction of an entirely new vehicle, intended to guarantee maximum passive safety.\nAt the end of 1971, only two American manufacturers, which do not even produce automobiles, have applied to the NHSB competition. Given the lack of interest, it is decided to extend the offer to all global manufacturers. In 1972, the American manufacturers Ford and General Motors as well as Fiat, Daimler-Benz, Volkswagen, Nissan and Honda join this initiative.\nThese ESV cars are designed on the basis of the specifications established during the various conferences held around the world: January 1971 in Paris, France; September 1971 in Sindelfingen, Germany; July 1972 in Washington DC; March 1973 in Kyoto, Japan and June 1974, in London, England.\nFiat is the only manufacturer in the NHSB project to present one model each in three different weight categories. They stand out with very visible black protection of the front and rear of the cars, and have the ESV logo and a number indicating the weight of the vehicle in pounds, as prescribed in the American specifications.\nThe main safety test requirements of this project are protection of the passengers in:\n\na frontal or rear collision against a barrier at 80 km/h (50 mph)\na collision against a pole, frontal or at the rear, at 80 km/h (50 mph)\na lateral collision against a pole at a speed of 24 km/h (15 mph)\ncase of a rollover\nAs main differences with the standard cars they are based on, the three Fiat ESVs have in common: a reinforced inner skeleton, big polyurethane bumpers (in two versions: one developed by Pirelli with air chambers, the other filled with foam) at both ends with matching side protection strips, and a padded interior. The weight increase varies between 43% for the largest model and 50% for the smallest model. Also the production cost goes up, between 37% and 43%. Due to the higher weight, the cars all need a larger engine than standard, and the fuel consumption increases. Also the suspension is enforced and the wheels and tires are a size bigger than standard.\nIn all, Fiat produces 47 ESV vehicles between 1972 and 1974, at a total cost of 4.5 billion Lire (40-50 million euros). None of the experimental models designed by Fiat (or the other companies participating in this automotive safety experiment) makes it to mass production, but many elements can be seen on production models in the years to follow. Examples of the Fiat ESVs are the shock absorbing bumpers, fuel tank behind the rear seat and reinforced passenger cell with side impact protection bars in the doors of the Fiat 131, introduced in 1974 for Europe and in 1975 for the USA.\nMost of the Fiat ESVs are scrapped, but three are kept and are on display at the Heritage HUB in Turin, Italy.\n\n\n== Fiat ESV 1500 ==\n\nThe ESV 1500 project commences before the NHSB invitation to join the program. It is derived from the Fiat 500, with rear engine and rear-wheel drive, and is presented at the 1972 convention in Washington DC. Originally, it weighs no more than the targeted 680 kg (1,500 lb), with styling done by the engineers, who borrow certain elements from the yet-to-be-released Fiat 126. After the presentation, Fiat updates the experimental model for the 1973 presentation in Kyoto as the first versions would not pass the frontal pole collision test.\nThe extra reinforcements mean that the eventual prototype weighs 780 kg (1,720 lb). This means it is above the target of 1,500 lb (680 kg). Because of its weight, it is fitted with an enlarged engine: 600 cc instead of 500 cc. One of the safety features that Fiat also tests in the ESV 1500, is the use of airbags, among other restraint systems. The conclusion is that at that time, there is no satisfactory restraint system for speeds of 50 mph (80 km/h) for a car of this size, including airbags. In total, thirteen ESV 1500 prototypes are built.\n\n\n== Fiat ESV 2000 ==\n\nThe ESV 2000 is first presented in 1973, in Kyoto. It has five doors and front wheel drive; it is derived from the 128. The engine displacement is 1300 cc instead of 1100 cc, because the car weighs 360 kg (794 lb) more than the standard model. For the styling of this car, Fiat Centro Stile is asked to make the proposals. While the original Fiat 128 is not marketed with five doors Fiat decides to add a tailgate for the ESV 2000 to provide an additional emergency exit.\nAlso, the windshield is deeply curved so it sits further from the front occupants' heads than in the 128, without any change in the position and rake of the original A-pillars. The roof is slightly raised from the B-pillar aft, to allow for an extra strong roll-over bar. Finally, the spare wheel is moved from the engine bay to the trunk and the fuel tank is moved forward from below the trunk to right behind the passenger compartment. In testing, the concessions to the styling of the car that the Centro Stile wanted, turn out to have negative consequences for the crash test results. Twenty examples of the ESV 2000 are built.\n\n\n== Fiat ESV 2500 ==\n\nThe ESV 2500 is based on the Fiat 124 and has a front engine with rear wheel drive. In terms of weight, it is almost twice the 124, and it would also cost much more, thus making it unviable on the market. Although the shape of the car remains that of a three box sedan, the ESV 2500 gets a tailgate like the ESV 2000. Also here the windshield is curved compared to the original, and the fuel tank is moved to a safer position right behind the passenger compartment.\n\n\n== Notes and references ==",

        "content": "Fritz Bing (22 September 1934 – 24 September 2023) was a South African cricketer and businessman who became a leading cricket administrator.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nBing was born in Cape Town and attended Wynberg Boys' High School, where he was head prefect in 1952. He was a right-handed batsman who played eight matches of first-class cricket for Western Province, spread over seven seasons. His most successful matches were his last two. Batting at number three against Border in the 1960–61 Currie Cup, he scored 20 and 85 (the highest score on either side) in a 237-run victory. A week later, he scored 62 and 12 against Orange Free State, this time in a 28-run loss.\nIn 1957, Bing married Jenny Jones, whose father, A. P. Jones, owned a department store under his name in Fish Hoek, a coastal suburb of Cape Town. Bing joined the store, managing the men's department. He established a sporting goods department in the store, and also established South Africa's first cricket ball making factory. Bing bought the A. P. Jones store in 1984; it is now run by later generations of his family. Fritz and Jenny had four children, all boys.\nBing served as president of the Western Province Cricket Union between 1981 and 1989. He played an active role during the unification process between the (white) WPCU and the (non-white) Western Province Cricket Board during 1991. In 1994 he served as manager of the first post-apartheid South African team to tour England. \nBing lived in Noordhoek, Cape Town, for more than 60 years. He died in September 2023, two days after his 89th birthday. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFritz Bing at ESPNcricinfo",

He was born 29 October 1786, and was baptised at St. Martin’s-in-the-Fields, London, in November the same year. He was nominated to a cadetship in 1806, and passed an examination in Persian and Hindustani, for which he was awarded a gratuity of twelve hundred rupees and a sword. His commissions in the infantry were: ensign 13 August 1807, lieutenant 14 July 1812, captain (army 5 February 1822) 30 January 1824, major 30 April 1835, lieutenant-colonel 26 December 1841, colonel 25 May 1852. He became major-general in 1854, lieutenant-general in 1866, general in 1870. He shared the Deccan prize as lieutenant 1st Bengal native infantry for ‘general captures.’ He sought permission in 1824 to change his name to Mattenby, but the request was refused as beyond the competence of the Indian government. He served with the 2nd native grenadier battalion in Arracan in 1825, was timber agent at Naulpore in 1828, and was in charge of the commissariat at Dinapore in 1832. As major he commanded his regiment in Afghanistan under Sir William Nott in 1842, and commanded the garrison of Candahar when, during the temporary absence of Nott, the place was assaulted on 10 March 1842 by an Afghan detachment, which was repulsed with heavy loss (see London Gazette, 6 Sept. 1842). Lane received the medal for Candahar and Cabul, and was made C.B. 27 December 1842. He died in Jersey 18 February 1872, aged 85.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Chichester, Henry Manners (1892). \"Lane, Charles Edward William\".

He sold the business in 2022.\nHis company Fullers Foods International, specialised in distributing frozen food products. The company, with origins in a business founded in 1876 by Harry Fuller in the Leeds markets,  initially focused on selling fruit and vegetables. Subsequently, the company diversified into frozen foods and became a supplier to major UK supermarkets and the food service industry.\nIn 2022, Jason Fuller and his co-CEO Adam Fuller, engaged in a sale to a group of private investors. Under Jason's co-leadership, Fullers Foods achieved revenues of  £420 million.\nBrown Butler, an accountancy firm, and DJP Advisory advised the management buyout. Jason Fuller's role in this strategic shift was to ensure the company's sustained leadership and future prosperity in the food industry. The company supplied retailers such as M&S, Asda, Morrison's, Tesco, and Aldi.\nFuller, alongside his brother Adam, led Fullers Foods, a family business with origins in the 19th century. Under their leadership, the company expanded its operations and infrastructure, including a significant £600,000 investment in 2021 to enhance its headquarters in Leeds. Fuller and his brother sold their stakes in the business, resulting in a management buyout supported by a group of private investors.\nIn 2023, the Yorkshire Post ranked him as the 37th richest person in Yorkshire, along with his brother Adam Fuller.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "revision_id": 1223010724,
        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "The European Convention on the Legal Status of Children born out of Wedlock is a treaty (E.T.S. No. 85) adopted in 1975 under the auspices of the Council of Europe to harmonise the legal status of children born out of wedlock, and promote their equality with children born in wedlock, in the relevant legislation of the Contracting Parties. Accession is open to CoE Member States. As of 2024, it has been signed by 26 countries, and ratified by 23 countries. The Convention imposes an obligation on the Member States to eliminate discriminatory treatment of children born out of wedlock. The Council purposefully uses the term children born out of wedlock instead of illegitimate children.: 55  Historically, it is the first adopted multilateral treaty of this type.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe status of children born outside of wedlock is, indirectly, or directly, also treated in provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights (Articles 8, 12 and 14), the European Social Charter (Articles 16, 17), the and the European Convention on Nationality (Articles 5, 6).\nThe convention is one of the early, significant instruments in family law, especially on matters involving children, of the Council of Europe. The convention is a part of a set of other Council Treaties on matters involving children: the European Convention on the Adoption of Children, the European Convention on Recognition and Enforcement of Decisions Concerning Custody of Children and on Restoration of Custody of Children, the European Convention on the Exercise of Children's Rights, the Convention on Contact concerning Children, the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse. The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, and the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, have also adopted a slew of recommendations. Three committees deal with the legal protection of children, in part or in full: Committee of Experts on Family Law (CJ-FA) – the most relevant – Convention Committee on the Custody Convention (T-CC), and the Committee of Experts on Nationality (CJ-NA) Other bodies of the Council concerned with this area of the law are the Conference of European Ministers of Justice, and the European Conference on Family Law. Additionally, some of the council's Colloquies on European law have been devoted to family law.: 54–56 \n\n\n== History ==\nEuropean jurisdictions had recognised the concept of legitimate and illegitimate children, who had different legal status, and rights. This started to change through the rulings of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), and the legislative work of the council. This occurred concurrently with national reforms intended to reduce or eliminate inequalities between children born out of wedlock and children born in wedlock, and to abolish the distinction between legitimate and illegitimate children.\nGermany adopted the Law on the Legal Status of Children Born out of Wedlock/Children Born outside Marriage (Legal Status) in 1969, or Non-marriage Law, for short. The Law on Family Matters of 16 December 1997 further enhanced the legal protections, but a disadvantage remained with regard to illegitimate children born before 1949. Even if recognized, those children could not be their statutory heirs. This led to the case Brauer v. Germany in 2009, which overturned this inequality.: 87 \nLess expansive measures were also introduced by the Law of January 3, 1972 on Filiation in France, which allows mothers to recognise children born out of wedlock, although it required a legal formality. Only in the 21st century was the principle of equality fully upheld (through Act no. 2002-305 of 4 March 2002, removing mention of illegitimacy – filiation légitime and filiation naturell; and through Law no. 2009-61 of 16 January 2009). In 2001, France was forced in Mazurek v. France by the ECHR to change several laws that were deemed discriminatory, and in 2013 the Court ruled in Fabris v. France that these changes must also be applied to children born before 2001.\nIn the United Kingdom, discriminating treatment regarding illegitimate children by the common law progressed for a long time. Under English law, the child was considered filius nullius, that is, noone's child, and a bastard. As a result, the United States, Canada and Australia followed suit. In time, the traditional rule concerning these children was discarded, but an unmarried father could only acquire parental rights through specific means enumerated by Children Act 1989. These means were, basically, marriage or a court order.6 Eventually, with the Children Act 2004, parental responsibility was given to all those unmarried fathers who registered the birth of their children on the basis of a formal agreement with the mother.: 85–87 \nOriginally, because of the stigma related to birth outside of wedlock, the EConvHR was not interpreted in such a way to protect the rights of children born outside of wedlock, but this changed through landmark decisions of the Court, beginning in 1979 with the case Marckx v. Belgium. The illegitimate child was Alexandra Marckx, daughter of Paula Marckx. The Belgian Civil Code recognised no legal bond between an unmarried woman and her child from the mere fact of the birth. Article 8 of the EConvHR makes no distinction between legitimate and illegitimate children. This confirmed that that the protection of family life out of marriage had to be extended so as to give children born out of wedlock the same inheritance rights, between parents and child, involving other relatives, and between grandparents and grandchildren.: 85 \nIn 1970, the question of legal status was discussed by the Committee of Ministers in the Intergovernmental Work Programme of the Council of Europe. This was recommended by the European Committee on Legal Co-operation (CCJ), and noted improvements in legislation. The Committee adopted Resolution (70) 15 on 15 May 1970, on the social protection of unmarried mothers and their children, which touched upon some legal aspects of the protection of children born out of wedlock. The Committee opened the convention to signature at their 249th meeting, of October 1975.\n\n\n== Core normative provisions ==\nThe Convention seeks to assimilate the status of children, and to contribute to the harmonisation of the laws. However, Article 14 provides for a system of reservations enabling gradual implementation. The convention's main provisions relate to paternal and maternal affiliation, recognition, denial and contesting of paternity, the assignment of parental responsibilities, and children's succession rights. Under this convention, both parents have the same obligation to maintain their children as if these children were born in wedlock. Children have the same right of succession in the estate of their parents and a member of their parent's family as if they had been born in wedlock.\nHowever, Article 14 provides for a system of reservations similar to the European Convention on Adoption, requiring reservations to be re-examined every five years, for States who cannot immediately implement certain provisions. The convention also does not cover all questions, such as whether retrospective effect should be applied after the establishment of parental affiliation, or the child's legitimation by marriage.\nThe Convention sets off some basic principles dealing with the establishment of children's status, as follows:\n\n\n=== Article 2 ===\nThe maternal affiliation of every child born out of wedlock shall be based solely on the fact of the birth of the child. Where the mother is unknown, the maternal affiliation would only come into full effect when the identity becomes known. In some States, maternal affiliation is established when further information is included about the mother in the relevant documents, and they may make reservations. The International Commission of Civil Status (ICCS) relating to the establishment of maternal affiliation of natural children of 12 September 1962 can only be an intermediate stage in relation to the convention. This holds the principle of mater semper certa est to be absolute.\n\n\n=== Article 3 ===\nThe paternal affiliation of every child born out of wedlock may be evidenced or established by voluntary recognition or by judicial decision. The internal law shall determine the form of voluntary recognition. This can be a declaration on the birth certificate or other official document.\n\n\n=== Article 4 ===\nThe voluntary recognition of paternity may not be opposed or contested, unless the person seeking to recognise or having recognised the child is not the biological father.\n\n\n=== Article 5 ===\nScientific evidence which may help to establish or disprove paternity shall be admissible.\n\n\n=== Article 6 ===\nThe parents of a child born out of wedlock shall have the same obligation to maintain the child. The content, the extent, the duration, of this obligation are left to the internal law establishing the rules likewise for children born in wedlock.\n\n\n=== Article 7 ===\nWhere the affiliation to both parents has been established, parental authority may not be attributed automatically only to the father. This provision does not prevent the parental authority from being attributed jointly, or to a third party, or to take away parental authority from one of the parents.\n\n\n=== Article 8 ===\nWhere a parent does not have parental authority over or the custody of the child, that parent may obtain a right of access to the child in appropriate cases. The exercise of this right to access would be granted or refused by a judicial or administrative authority.\n\n\n=== Article 9 ===\nA child born out of wedlock shall have the same right of succession, as if it had been born in wedlock.\n\n\n=== Article 10 ===\nThe marriage between the father and mother of a child born out of wedlock shall confer on the child the legal status of a child born in wedlock. It was agreed that this assimilation need not be automatic but could be subject to a judicial or administrative authority establishing that the conditions have been fulfilled. It was understood that the Convention does not forbid a Contracting Party from providing, by its internal law, a single legal status for all children and also does not forbid this party from taking special measures of protection for those children who do not live with their parents.\n\n\n== Status ==\nAs of 2024, these are the Parties to the convention within the CoE:\n\n\n== Impact ==\n\n\n=== Rulings of the European Court of Human Rights ===\nThe court determined in the case of Inze v. Austria, in 1987, that the applicant, who is a child born out of wedlock, must be legally heir to his mother's farm, on which he had worked until the age of 23. A violation of Article 14 of the EconvHR, and Article 1 of the Additional Protocols was found. Austria's reservation was determined to not be relevant to the case, as it only applied to the estate of the father and the father's family.\n\n\n=== Further developments ===\nThe 6th Conference on Family Law took place in Strasbourg on 14 and 15 October 2002 on the theme of “The legal protection of the family in matters of succession”. The legal protection is important due to various reservations made by States to Article 9.\nIn 2011, a Draft Recommendation on the rights and legal status of children and parental responsibilities was written.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nInternational Conventions in the Field of Family Law\nCouncil of Europe Achievements in the Field of Law: Family Law and the Protection of Children",

        "content": "The Treaty on the Russian-Ukrainian border is a bilateral international treaty between the Russian Federation and Ukraine, which delineated the land border line between the two countries.\n\n\n== Terms of the Treaty ==\nThe Treaty defines the \"Russia-Ukraine state border\" as the line and vertical surface passing along this line, separating the state territories (land, waters, subsoil, and airspace) of the Contracting Parties from the point of junction of the state borders of the Russian Federation, Ukraine, and Republic of Belarus to the point located on the shore of the Taganrog Gulf.\nThe border follows the path as specified in the Description of the Passage of the State Border between the Russian Federation and Ukraine. The description and maps of the state border attached to the Treaty are its integral part.\nIt is considered that the junction point of the borders of Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus is the \"Friendship Mound,\" or \"Three Sisters Mound\" — the Border Junction in the village of Senkivka of the Chernihiv District of the Chernihiv Oblast, entirely within the territory of Ukraine. According to the official classification of the UN, this triple junction point is designated as \"080 byruua\" (in alphabetical order: by — Belarus, ru — Russia, ua — Ukraine). However, it is not enshrined at the level of a trilateral international treaty.\n\n\n== Signing and Ratification ==\nOn January 28, 2003, during the visit of the President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin to Kyiv, the Treaty  on the state border between the two countries was signed, which fixed its land part.\nUkraine ratified the Treaty on April 20, 2004, and the Russian Federation on April 22.\nDuring the period between the signing and ratification of the Treaty, the Tuzla Island conflict occurred, sparked by Russia's construction of a dam in the Kerch Strait from the Taman Peninsula to Tuzla Island. Analysts believed the conflict aimed to pressure Ukraine regarding the delimitation of the border in the Kerch Strait and the Sea of Azov.\nThe Treaty entered into force on the date of the exchange of instruments of ratification, namely on April 23, 2004.\n\n\n== Implementation and Violation of the Treaty ==\nThe simultaneous ratification of the Treaty  on the Russia-Ukraine state border and the Treaty Between the Russian Federation and Ukraine on Cooperation in the Use of the Sea of Azov and the Kerch Strait on December 24, 2003, completed the legal formalization of the border line on land. On July 29, 2010, the Treaty on the demarcation of the Ukrainian-Russian state border entered into force, creating the legal basis for initiating the process of marking the Russia-Ukraine state border on the ground.\nThe problem of demarcating the land part of the Russia-Ukraine border remained a \"frozen\" issue in bilateral relations for many years. For many years, the Russian Federation obstructed this process.\nAs no measures to demarcate the border were taken due to the resistance of the Russian Federation, the Ukrainian side decided to unilaterally carry out activities to mark the border on the ground. Direct demarcation of the border is carried out based on the Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine of May 14, 2015, \"On marking the Ukrainian-Russian state border on the ground\".\nBeginning its armed aggression against Ukraine in 2014, Russia violated fundamental norms and principles of international law, as well as a number of bilateral and multilateral treaties and agreements, including the Treaty on the Ukraine-Russia state border.\n\n\n== See also ==\nState Border of Ukraine\nState Border of Russia\nRussia-Ukraine relations\nProject Wall\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTreaty between Ukraine and the Russian Federation on the Ukrainian-Russian State Border on the website of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine\nTreaty between Ukraine and the Russian Federation on the Ukrainian-Russian State Border on treaties.un.org",

Opened in 1941, and located on Market Street, it is one of the few single-screen Art Deco movie houses in the country still in operation, and forms part of Lewisburg Historic District. It is now co-owned by Campus Theatre Ltd. and Bucknell University.\nThe theater, designed by David Supowitz, was founded by the Steifel brothers (Oscar, Harold, Moritz (Morris) and Barney), Russian immigrants who ran an empire across New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Its opening night was January 17, 1941, when it showed the Jack Benny and Fred Allen musical comedy Love Thy Neighbor.\nMoriss's son, Harold, took over the management of the theater in 1953, when his uncle, Barney, retired.\nIn 2001, Bucknell University film and media studies professor Eric Faden leased the theater from Jacquie Steifel, Harold's widow, and founded Campus Theatre Ltd. as a nonprofit organization. Five years later, Bucknell purchased the building and leased it back to Campus Theatre Ltd. for $1 a year.\nThe theater underwent a $2.5 million renovation in 2011, including the addition of the Bucknell Bison logo on its facade.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

F. Fenger, pastor in  Lynge, \"I can't help but ask you for a little Christmas carol or carol for children of the same kind as the morning carols\". A few days later, Ingemann sent his song to Lynge Rectory. It was published in Nordisk Tidsskrift for christelig Theologi under the title Børnenes Julesang in 1840.\nThe musical setting wasarranged by C.E.F. Weyse in 1841.  It was his choise to reduce the number of stanza from six to three. He had also composed the tunes for Ingemann's morning songs and evening songs.\n\n\n== Lyricks ==\n1. Julen har bragt velsignet bud,\nnu glædes gamle og unge.\nHvad englene sang i verden ud,\nnu alle små børn skal sjunge.\nGrenen fra livets træ står skønt\nmed lys som fugle på kviste;\ndet barn, som sig glæder fromt og kønt,\nskal aldrig den glæde miste.\n2.

Frelseren selv var barn som vi,\ni dag han lå i sin vugge.\nDen have, Guds engle flyve i,\nvil Jesus for os oplukke.\nHimmerigs konge blandt os bor,\nhan juleglæden os bringer;\nhan favner hver barnesjæl på jord\nog lover os englevinger.11\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "A process of cabinet formation took place following the Dutch general election on 16 May 1946. This resulted in the formation of the First Beel cabinet on 3 July 1946. The coalition was formed by the Catholic People's Party (KVP) and the Labour Party (PvdA).\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== Schemerhorn-Drees cabinet ===\nAfter the liberation from the German occupation in the Netherlands in 1945 , queen Wilhelmina appointed the Schermerhorn-Drees cabinet, consisting of the Roman Catholic State Party (RKSP), the Social Democratic Worker's Party (SDAP) and the Free-thinking Democratic League (VDB). This cabinet was tasked with getting the government back in order after the occupation and prepare for elections.\n\n\n=== Election ===\n\n\n== Formateur Beel ==\nThe KVP wanted one formateur to be appointed from their party. The PvdA wanted their leader Willem Drees to be appointed as co-formateur. Because the PvdA objected to KVP leader Carl Romme, Romme proposed appointing KVP Minister of the Interior Louis Beel as formateur, despite objection from Beel himself. Wilhelmina accepted this advice and appointed Beel on 27 May. His assignment was to form a cabinet \"that can be expected to have the confidence of the House of Representatives\".\nBeel wrote an extensive program, which he discussed with Romme on 31 May. On 3 June, he then discussed the program with PvdA parliamentary leader Marinus van der Goes van Naters. Van der Goes van Naters objected to involing parties in the coalition other than KVP and PvdA. Other parliamentary leaders Beel spoke to refused as well to participate, because they disagreed with too many points in the program, including on Indonesia. On 17 June, the KVP and PvdA reached an agreement on the program.\nBeel wanted to obtain additional information about the policy regarding Indonesia. Together with Drees, he traveled to London on 22 June to speak with the diplomats Alidius Tjarda van Starkenborgh Stachouwer, Edgar Michiels van Verduynen and Eelco van Kleffens. They recommended that the matter be dealt with in the United Nations. Against their advice, Beel and Drees continued to send troops and wanted the British to mediate.\nOn 1 July, the constitutive deliberation took place and two days later the ministers were sworn in.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nDuynstee, Frans (1966).

Over the years, it has become a benchmark for lawyers, politicians and historians.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Docile (c. 1989 – 1994) was a female Briard dog. Owned by football manager Egil Olsen, the dog became a national celebrity animal during Olsen's tenure as manager of the Norway national football team.\nThe dog quickly became known for accompanying Olsen to work, both in the Football Association offices and in training sessions. In addition, the Briard breed was rare in Norway, with approximately 300 individuals. According to a biographer of Egil Olsen, Docile was used as a figurehead to shield his family members from media attention. Another reason that Olsen kept a dog was to walk the dog to ailment his ankylosing spondylitis.\nThe media attention around the Norwegian men's national football team increased significantly during the 1994 FIFA World Cup qualification run, which was the first successful qualification for Norway since the late 1930s. As training sessions were crowded with journalists, in early 1994 VG's Bjørn Delebekk won the Norwegian Press Photographers' annual prize for sports photography. His photoseries of Docile frolicking around the national team players was titled \"En hund etter ball\".\nDuring the 1994 World Cup, Docile did not follow Olsen to the US and was stationed at Olsen's in-laws in Egersund. They claimed that the dog was recognised around town. The same period saw several spin-off products inspired by the dog. A woolwear factory started marketing a \"World Cup yarn\" under the name Docile. The pub Docile in Hamar acquired Olsen's acceptance to use Docile's name and likeness, both on the pub itself as well as on caps and clothing. The newspaper Dagbladet arranged a letter column in Docile's name during the 1994 World Cup. People would contact Docile's supposed fax machine number and have the chance to win a book by Tor Røste Fossen. The same newspaper arranged a naming contest for Olsen's next dog, which would be of the same breed.\nIn early November 1994, Docile escaped from the front yard of Olsen's home. As some boys played in the street outside, the dog bit the pant leg of one of the boys, causing minor clothing damage. Reportedly against the wishes of the boy's parents, the decision was made to euthanize the dog. Docile was regarded as a national celebrity and \"Norway's most publicized dog\". Norway's largest newspaper VG stated that Olsen's unusual choice of footwear, wellington boots, coupled with Docile resting at his feet was \"A sort of trademark for the most Norwegian of all Norwegian things\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of individual dogs\n\n\n== References ==",

The cows appear in close-up as large, moving bodies, on the TV-sets that were knocked over juxtapositioned left, right, and upside down.\n\n\n== Interpretation ==\nAs in all of McCaslin's work humor is an important constituent but there's also a critique of today's consumer society. The installation is equally much about television as a conveyor of information as about life in the country.\n\n\n== Pathology ==\nFood For Thought could further be a sort of virtual edition of a mad cow disease affecting all living things in a sort of mass psychosis devoid of pain.\nIt could then be stated that the cows is trapped in a sort of virtual reality highlighting life conditions that, albeit a simulated reality, manifests itself as not that much of a difference to the cows usual life.\nIn an ironic twist every art exhibitioneer then gets infected by this disease upon evaluating the piece but to no other avail than to experiencing art.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Anne Austin (September 13, 1895 – ?) was an American journalist and writer of romance and mystery novels.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nAnne Austin was born in Waco, Texas. She married Charles Benson in 1912, whom she divorced soon after the birth of their child, Ellen Elizabeth. In 1922, she married Stewart Edmund Book (whom she also divorced). From 1912 to 1914 she attended Baylor University. Her first occupation was as a high school teacher in Marfa and Moody, Texas. She then worked as a feature and fiction writer and a dramatic critic for the Waco Morning News, the Kansas City Post, and other periodicals. From 1926 to 1930, she wrote for Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA Service), where she produced several serialized romance novels that were later published as books. In 1934, one of them was turned into the movie A Wicked Woman.\nIn 1929, Austin's first mystery novel The Black Pigeon was serialized in newspapers and subsequently published as a book. The story, written in the heyday of the Golden Age of Detective Fiction, was a success and translated into several languages (e.g., German and French), which led to five more mystery novels featuring the investigator James \"Bonnie\" Dundee.\nStarting in 1933, Austin was under contract as a writer at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios; in 1939, she was living in Hollywood, California. After the 1930s, she published no more books and seems to have disappeared entirely from the public; nothing is known about her further life.\n\n\n== Mother of child prodigy ==\nAustin's only child, Ellen Elizabeth Benson (born 1913 in Waco, Texas), was measured with an I.Q. of 214 at the age of 8, then the highest ever recorded, and became a celebrity. At 13, during her sophomore year at Barnard College in New York City, she published a book of her own, The Younger Generation. In a series of newspaper articles, Austin described how she managed to support her child while being a single working mother, unusual at the time.\n\n\n== Publications ==\n\n\n=== Mystery novels ===\nThe Black Pigeon, New York: Greenberg (1929); previously serialized in newspapers in 1929\nThe Avenging Parrot, New York: Greenberg (1930); previously serialized in newspapers in 1929. This novel introduced the investigator James \"Bonnie\" Dundee, who was also featured in the following mysteries.\nMurder Backstairs, New York: The Macmillan Company (1930); previously serialized in newspapers in 1930\nMurder at Bridge, New York: The Macmillan Company (1931);  previously serialized in newspapers in 1930\nOne Drop of Blood, New York: The Macmillan Company (1932)\nMurdered, But Not Dead, New York: The Macmillan Company (1939)\nResurrected Press reissued all of Austin's mystery novels between 2012 and 2015.\n\n\n=== Other novels ===\nJackson Street, New York: Greenberg (1927)\nDaughters of Midas, Chicago: The White House (1929)\nThe Penny Princess, Chicago: The White House  (1929)\nGirl Alone, Chicago: The White House (1930)\nRival Wives, Chicago: The White House (1930)\nA Wicked Woman, New York: The Macmillan Company (1933)\nSaint and Sinner (1936)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Wat San Chao (Thai: วัดศาลเจ้า, pronounced [wát sǎːn t͡ɕâw]) is an ancient Thai Buddhist temple in Mueang Pathum Thani district, Pathum Thani province on the northern outskirts Bangkok.\nThe temple has a history dating back to the late Ayutthaya period for at least 200 years. Believed that its creator was a Mon who fled from war in Burma (present-day Myanmar).\nWat San Chao is a small civil temple next to Wat Makham, another ancient temple and border to the Chao Phraya river and Khlong Chiang Rak canal. What makes it famous is that it is the location of Sian Pae Rong Si Shrine, a shrine is dedicated to Nathi Thongsiri or Ngow Kim Koi, a Chinese man who was highly respected by locals and the general public as an expert in Feng Shui and Chinese astrology. Affectionately known as Sian Pae Rong Si (เซียนแปะโรงสี). He was so loved by the locals for his tirelessness in assisting the locals with their ailments, financial difficulties, and in helping to change their luck around, from bad to good. He was a Chinese citizen who immigrated to Thailand when he was 10 years old and settled down to own a rice mill here and had transferred his nationality to Thai and had a Thai wife. During his life, he was a Feng Shui consultant for businessmen or leading companies in Thailand, such as CP Group.\nAlthough he passed away in 1984, the public's faith in him continues today. Yantra amulets (fabric talisman) and medallions with his image have become popular amulets among Thai people, especially traders. This is believed to help business prosperity and success. His shrine was crowded with worshipers and oaths. It's only closed on Mondays.\nIn addition, another thing that attracts people to the temple is the Wat San Chao Floating Market, a riverside market is famous for its variety of Thai food and traditional desserts. Some types are rare, such as Khao chae (cooked rice served in cool fragrant water), etc. The market is only open on Saturdays and Sundays and public holidays.\n\n\n== See also ==\nThai amulet\nFeng Shui\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Polish Society \"Oświata\" (also known as the Society \"Oświata\" and \"Oświata\") was a Polish social organization founded in 1905, operating in Minsk and in the Minsk Governorate of the Russian Empire. Until 1907, its activities were carried out clandestinely, legally from 1907 to 1909, and then again clandestinely. The society aimed to educate the inhabitants of the Minsk region, especially children, in the spirit of Polishness, as well as to disseminate Polish culture, language, and strengthen national consciousness in these lands. The organization was persecuted, and during its legal activity, it was treated with hostility by the Russian authorities because strengthening Polish identity in the annexed lands contradicted the state administration's strategy of Russification and assimilation.\n\n\n== Poles in Minsk and Minsk Governorate ==\nAt the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, the Polish-speaking population and/or those declaring Polish nationality constituted a significant minority in Minsk and the Minsk Governorate. According to the census organized in 1897 in the Russian Empire, in the city of Minsk, people considering Polish as their native language accounted for 11.4% of the population, being the third largest linguistic group after those speaking Yiddish (51.2%) and Russian (25.5%). In the entire Minsk Governorate, according to the same census, people considering Polish as their native language constituted 3% of the population, trailing behind Belarusian (76%), Yiddish (16%), and Russian (3.9%). In absolute numbers, according to the census, there were 10,369 Polish-speaking individuals in Minsk and 64,617 in the Minsk Governorate. According to the census conducted in December 1919 in the territories administered by the Civil Administration of the Eastern Lands (the temporary Polish administration during the Polish–Soviet War), Poles constituted 18.3% of the population in Minsk, being the third ethnic group after Jews (44.9%) and Belarusians (22.9%). In the entire Minsk District, according to the same census, Poles constituted 14.6% of the population, second only to Belarusians (64.5%). In absolute numbers, there were 18,713 Poles in Minsk and 159,706 in the Minsk District.\n\n\n== Circumstances of creation ==\n\nOn 12 December 1904, with the advent of the so-called \"liberal times\" in the Russian Empire, a tsarist decree was issued partially lifting restrictions on the teaching of the Polish language. It allowed for its instruction in Russian elementary and secondary schools as an optional subject, conducted outside of mandatory class hours, for an additional high fee. This fee was higher the fewer parents expressed a desire to send their children to such classes. Such conditions did not meet the educational needs of the Polish community residing in the Minsk Governorate. They expected not only the teaching of the native language to their children but also education in a Polish patriotic spirit. Therefore, efforts were made to establish educational institutions with a purely Polish character.\nIn mid-1905, the illegal Polish Society \"Oświata\" was established in Minsk. Its founders were Father Kazimierz Mikołaj Michalkiewicz, Jan Offenberg, Michalina Łęska, and Mieczysław Porowski. The society's activity mainly involved coordinating and expanding Polish clandestine education, which, according to reports from the tsarist police, was widespread in the Minsk Governorate. On 4 March 1906, a decree facilitating the establishment of social organizations was issued. In connection with this, Polish educational activists in Minsk decided to engage in public activities, which in their opinion could bring much better results. The Polish Society \"Oświata\" was officially registered by the Russian authorities on 11 January 1907. On March 12, a founding meeting took place, during which, according to witnesses, there was a general excitement and eagerness to work. The organization's statute was adopted, and the first board was elected. It included: president – Father Kazimierz Mikołaj Michalkiewicz, vice president – doctor Jan Offenberg, secretary – doctor Czesław Grabowiecki, treasurer – lawyer Zygmunt Węcławowicz. After Father Michalkiewicz left Minsk in 1908, the position of president remained vacant, and his duties were performed by the then vice president Mieczysław Porowski. The Society's Council also included priests: Kazimierz Bukraba, Adam Lisowski, and I. Krukowski.\n\n\n== Program ==\nAccording to the statute, the organization's program aimed at the intellectual and moral upliftment of all layers of the Polish society in the Minsk Governorate. Its implementation was to take place through comprehensive cultural and educational activities, including the establishment of Polish schools, running a library, organizing lectures, and summer camps for children. However, in practice, the intention to open Polish schools could not be realized because it required the approval of the Russian authorities each time. Throughout the entire period of the society's legal operation, Russian officials never once granted permission to open a Polish school in the Minsk region and in other territories of the former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth to the east of Minsk.\n\n\n== Structure and operations ==\n\nThe society had its main headquarters in Minsk and five provincial branches: in Mazyr, Pinsk, Uzda, Novogrudok, and Rakaw. It was divided into sections dealing with various areas of activity: elementary education, adult literacy education, teacher training seminars, summer camps, lectures, libraries, book lending, and financial:\n\nThe section for elementary education focused on teaching children in secret classes. This was illegal activity. The education had a coordinated character and was based on a uniform curriculum. Due to the conditions of secrecy, its exact scope is not known. According to Mieczysław Porowski, there were approximately half a thousand children taught in 32 groups in Minsk. In the initial period of the society's existence, this work was not heavily pursued by the authorities. However, in 1911, with the increasing effectiveness of police repression, the number of students decreased, for example, in Minsk to around 400.\nThe section for adult literacy education taught illiterate adults reading and writing skills, and introduced them to social work. In Minsk, about 180 people were taught with its help, mainly craftsmen.\nThe teacher training seminar section focused on preparing female teachers for educational work among the people. This activity was significant because the expansion of educational activities created a significant demand for female teachers, and at the same time, few candidates had suitable qualifications, especially in terms of proficiency in the Polish language. Therefore, the section aimed to conduct fast training courses. From the beginning to the end of its existence, it operated illegally. It was led by Michalina Łęska and Anna Czekotowska. Initially, in December 1905, there were six-month courses for female teachers opened in Minsk. Soon, the illegal Polish Society \"Oświata\" took over the supervision, gradually transforming them into teacher training seminars. It had two departments – completing the higher one gave the title of a people's teacher, while the lower one – so-called \"rural\" teacher. The most involved person in this venture was Michalina Łęska, who dealt with organizational matters of the seminar, conducted classes, and helped weaker students. The teacher training courses included subjects strictly related to promoting Polishness (Polish language, history and literature, Catholic religion) as well as other disciplines: nature, arithmetic, singing, children's games, pedagogy, and methodology. Participants also familiarized themselves with popular publications. However, Belarusian and Russian issues were treated in a specific way. Although Belarusian and Russian languages were taught, support for the Belarusian national movement was not provided. Teachers expressing opinions that schools should be non-denominational or conducted in the Belarusian language were sidelined from work. The seminar ceased its activities in 1911 due to the intensified fight against illegal Polish education by the Russian police.\nThe section for summer camps was created for the poorest children from cities, e.g., from Minsk. It organized summer camps for them on the estates of landowners, e.g., in Sawicz, Ustronie, Nacza, and Ihnatycze. Their aim was the mental and physical development of the children educated. Jadwiga Kostrowicka, the sister of Edward Woyniłłowicz, was the initiator of running camps in Sawicz.\nThe lecture section aimed to disseminate Polish culture through presentations, lectures, and popular talks. Its activities began on 29 April 1907. It was led by Jan Offenberg, and provincial branches of \"Oświata\" took an active part in it. For example, the Pinsk branch dealt exclusively with organizing lectures on Polish literature and vocabulary, which, according to a report by the Russian police, contributed to the growth of Polish national consciousness. Events organized by the lecture section were highly popular among the audience.\nThe library and book lending section were established with the permission of the Russian authorities on 22 December 1907 for the establishment of a Polish library by \"Oświata\" in Minsk. This facility was officially opened on 4 May 1908. At the time of its launch, it had 700 books, most of which were donated by Józef Tyszkiewicz from Lahoysk, while the rest were purchased from the bookstore of Wacław Leon Makowski. Despite giving permission for the opening of this facility, the Russian authorities consistently rejected similar requests from provincial branches of the society. For example, on 14 October 1908, a request from the Pinsk branch was rejected. In 1915, the Minsk library was located in the rectory of the Church of Saints Simon and Helena. It was initiated by Jadwiga Kostrowicka.\nThe financial section was responsible for collecting funds for the society's activities and educational work. Membership fees were collected, but they were not enough to meet the needs. Polish education faced constant financial problems, often relying on a foundation of debts and hopes. With the aim of acquiring other sources of funding, concerts, lectures, annual balls were organized, which were popular and brought significant income. \"Oświata\" was also supported by donors. Significant donations for its activities were made by, among others: Father Kazimierz Mikołaj Michalkiewicz, Wilhelm Jelski, Marian Obiezierski, and Konstanty Prószyński from Ustronie. The society announced its budgetary data, including expenditure data, for the needs of the authorities, but the values provided were often fictitious because the management concealed funds spent on secret Polish schools.\n\n\n== Pogoń magazine project ==\nOn 17 October 1907, the Polish Society \"Oświata\" presented a project for the publication of a Polish magazine titled Pogoń in Minsk. The intention was for it to be a weekly publication featuring texts on religion, history, social and political matters, literature, and specialized topics. The request for permission to publish it was made to the authorities by Włodzimierz Dworzaczek, the former editor-in-chief of the Kiev weekly Kresy, with the support of the society. On 18 January 1908, the Russian authorities responded positively. The idea generated significant interest among the Polish community. Discussions were held, including in the pages of the Vilnius Polish press, regarding the nature of the future publication. There were debates about whether Pogoń should be a daily or a weekly for the people. Ultimately, although the magazine project was well thought out, it was not realized. It was not possible to gather the required number of 4,000 subscribers, which would guarantee the cost recovery of the publication.\n\n\n== Working conditions of teachers ==\nThe Polish Society \"Oświata\" oversaw a network of illegal Polish schools. Graduates of the teacher training seminars run by the society were directed to work in these schools. The conditions of their work were harsh. They received symbolic remuneration, barely enough to survive, and it was often withheld during the summer break. This was particularly problematic in rural areas, where due to agricultural work, the school year lasted from October 1 to April 1, or sometimes even shorter. Often, the main factor determining the continuation of educational work was the gratitude and attachment of the children.\n\n\n== Attitude of the population ==\nThe attitude of the indigenous population of the Minsk Governorate towards the educational activities of the Polish Society \"Oświata\" was generally positive. Parents willingly sent their children to learn in illegal Polish schools, despite the risk of punishment if the practice was discovered by the Russian police. Occasionally, there were cases of reporting the rural teachers to the authorities. Sometimes, even Catholic priests and landowners, traditionally associated with Polish culture in these lands, were involved in such reports. They were likely motivated by fear of repression or enlightenment among the lower social classes, which landowners might have perceived as unfavorable to their interests. However, these were isolated cases. Sometimes, peasants justified sending their children to Polish schools because that's what the landlord wanted.\nSome Russian organizations, including members of the so-called Black Hundreds, protested against the development of Polish education. From 28 to 31 August 1908 in Minsk, a congress of the \"Orthodox Brotherhood\" took place, where a resolution was adopted demanding stricter punishment for clandestine teaching. Negative opinions were also expressed in the Russian press.\n\n\n== Attitude of Russian authorities ==\nFrom its founding in 1905 until its registration in 1907, the Polish Society \"Oświata\" operated clandestinely and illegally. Its activities were monitored by the Russian authorities and opposed, although not very intensively. In January 1907, the society was legalized. However, this did not mean that efforts to strengthen Polish identity would be tolerated. The authorities believed that such efforts hindered the assimilation of the Polish element by the Russian and, in various ways, obstructed the activities of \"Oświata\" and similar organizations in the western part of the Russian Empire. Continuous and detailed inspections were conducted to find any violations of the statutes, which could serve as grounds for its closure. In the spring of 1909, the governor of Minsk assessed that closing \"Oświata\" would be difficult because it did not violate the law, and its members generally did not establish schools or officially finance them.\nIn 1909, the chief of police of Mozyrsky Uyezd issued a report stating that the local branch of the Society \"Oświata\" was illegally operating five schools there. This served as the basis for the organization's disbandment. Consequently, and also because the Russian authorities had previously disbanded similar organizations in Kyiv and Vilnius, the general assembly of the Minsk \"Oświata\" on 5 December 1909 decided to self-dissolve the organization. In reality, the society returned to clandestine activities.\nFrom 1909 onwards, there was a significant intensification of the fight against illegal Polish education. These actions proved effective and led to the restriction of the Polish educational network. To reduce the risk of discovering clandestine schools, in 1911, the leadership of \"Oświata\" instructed that secret classes should consist of no more than four children. This significantly reduced the number of students but also led to the creation of more clandestine schools and increased involvement in Polish education among the Minsk bourgeoisie.\n\n\n== Termination of operations ==\nUnder the increasing pressure from the Russian authorities, the activities of \"Oświata\" gradually dwindled. As late as October 1911, the police received reports that Mieczysław Porowski and Father Kazimierz Bukraba were organizing illegal Polish education in Minsk. Illegal gatherings of Polish teachers were also organized every year. The situation only changed in 1917. The liberalization in education following the February Revolution allowed for the resumption of legal activities in this field. On April 20 (May 3), 1917, the Polish Educational Society of the Minsk Region was established, with its board including creators and leading activists of the former \"Oświata,\" such as Mieczysław Porowski, Michalina Łęska, and Zygmunt Węcławowicz.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nRomer, Eugeniusz (1920).

It was produced at a time when Australian plays were extremely rare.\nThe play was also revived a number of times.\nBells Life said \"it has all the requisites of a good drama – the plot is excellent and clearly developed; tho situations are of thrilling interest; the characters naturally drawn, and tbo language is powerful\nwithout hyperbole or exaggeration.\"\nLeslie Rees later called it \"a longer, multicoloured melodrama set in the reign of Charles the Second, with a comic Irishman and his biddy thrown in for good measure. The dialogue was highfalutin, to say the least. Mr Belfield gallantly attempted to breathe life into it by filling the title-role himself.\"\nThe play was published in 1850.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Rebel Chief at Ausstage\nFull copy of play at State Library of New South Wales",

        "content": "(3Z)-Nonenal is an unsaturated aldehyde that occurs naturally in various plants.\n\n\n== Occurrence ==\n\n(3Z)-Nonenal is a flavor component in various plants, such as cucumber, honeydew melon, and soy. It is the biosynthetic precursor to (2E)-nonenal, formed by isomerases. It also occurs in the brown algae Laminaria angustata. In the oysterplant, it contributes to its oyster-like taste.\n\n\n== Biosynthesis ==\nIn various plants such as cucumbers and melons, (3Z)-nonenal is formed from linoleic acid to 9-hydroperoxy-10,12-octadecadienoic acid and its splitting. In Laminaria angustata, formation also occurs via arachidonic acid and its 12-hydroperoxide.\n\n\n== Synthesis ==\n(3Z)-Nonenal can be synthesized by oxidation of (3Z)-nonen-1-ol with pyridinium chlorochromate. The compound can also be obtained through a multi-step reaction starting from 1,4-butanediol.\n\n\n== Properties ==\nThe scent is described as fruity, melony, or maritime in low concentrations. In an in vitro study, (3Z)-nonenal acted as a fungicide against various types of fungi.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Almighty So 2 is the fifth studio album by American rapper Chief Keef. It was released on May 10, 2024, through 43B. The album serves as a sequel to Chief Keef's 2013 mixtape Almighty So, as well as the follow up to both Keef's fourth studio album, 4NEM (2021), as well as DIRTY NACHOS (2024), his commercial mixtape in collaboration with Mike WiLL Made It. The album features guest appearances from Ballout, G Herbo, Lil Gnar, Tierra Whack, Sexyy Red and Quavo. Production was handled primarily by Keef himself, with uncredited co-production from a variety of producers including DP Beats, Mike WiLL Made It, Shawn Ferrari and Johnny Juliano, among others.\n\n\n== Promotion, delays and release ==\nAlmighty So 2 was originally announced by Keef in October 2018, during an interview subsequent to his performance at the Rolling Loud music festival in Oakland, California. In response to inquiries regarding upcoming projects for his fans, Keef disclosed plans for Back from the Dead 3, The Cozart and Almighty So 2 all slated for release in the near future.\nRoughly seven months subsequent to the initial announcement of Almighty So 2, Keef unveiled the official cover art for the project via his Instagram account on April 6, 2019. Shortly thereafter, on April 9, 2019, Keef dropped the track titled \"Boost\", serving as a promotional single for the upcoming project.\nDuring the album's rollout speculation arose surrounding a track titled \"Mooliani\", featuring Lil Uzi Vert, which was initially rumored to be included in Almighty So 2. However, the song was ultimately allocated to fellow rapper Lil Reese for his project Supa Savage 3. This decision was influenced by clearance issues with Lil Uzi Vert's record label.\nOn July 23, 2022, Chief Keef and producer Akachi released \"Tony Montana Flow\", the album's lead single.\nChief Keef took to social media on October 14, 2022, to reveal that the album would release on December 16, 2022. On the same day, he dropped the album's second single, \"Racks Stuffed Inna Couch\". Despite not being initially included in the leaked track list, both \"Racks Stuffed Inna Couch\" and \"Tony Montana Flow\" were part of the original list and made it to the December 2022 track listing.\nOn January 17, 2023, Chief Keef's new label 43B, posted a recording session for the album, featuring a choir for one of the tracks, as well as announcing that the entire project would be produced by Sosa himself. On November 5, 2023, Keef revealed two new cover arts for the album. After a span of two years marked by several delays and limited updates on the album's progress, an announcement was made via social media on March 7, 2024, revealing that the album had been finalized. Alongside this announcement, a purported tracklist was leaked, revealing a compilation of sixteen tracks, featuring contributions from Ballout, Lil Gnar, G Herbo, and Quavo, each making appearances on four of the tracks.\nOn May 6, 2024, Chief Keef unveiled the official and conclusive track listing. Alongside this revelation, the official trailer for the album was released, confirming its official release date set for May 10. Sexyy Red and Tierra Whack were included as the sole additional features, enhancing the final track list to include six collaborators in total. \"Racks Stuffed Inna Couch\" was also omitted from the album.\nOn May 9, 2024, Chief Keef released the second single, \"Drifting Away\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nCredits adapted from Spotify. All songs produced by Chief Keef except as noted.\n\nNotes\n\n^[u]  signifies an uncredited songwriter and/or producer\nSample credits\n\n\"Runner\" contains a sample of \"Streetrunner\", written by Gene Page and Billy Page, as performed by Nancy Wilson.\n\"1,2,3\" contains samples of \"And I Love Her\", written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, as performed by Bobby Womack; and \"Land of 1000 Dances\", written by Christopher Kenner, as performed by Wilson Pickett.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"Martsa ng Taguig\" (Filipino for \"Taguig March\"), also known as \"Awit ng Bayang Taguig (Martsa)\" (\"The Song of Taguig (March)\"), and generally referred to as the Taguig Hymn, is the official anthem of the city of Taguig in the Philippines.\n\n\n== History ==\nDuring the tenure of the former municipal mayor Rodolfo de Guzman, he suggested to several local officials including Councilor Mario Reyes of Barangay Calzada and Councilor Dr. Rene Labuntog of Signal Village that Taguig must have an official hymn.\nSubsequently, a meeting was held on May 12, 1989, between Mayor de Guzman and the officers and members of Banda-1 Tipas Foundation, Inc. led by its president, Felipe C. Santos, vice-president Engr. Danilo Dueñas, advisor BIR Deputy Commissioner Eufracio Santos, members of the Board of Directors Engr. Ricardo Natividad, Resty Mañosca, Ador Estacio, Noli Lagkalinawan, Francisco Mariano, Venancio Cruz, Jacinto Herrera, Brigido Manalo and coordinator Charlie Prophet, to inspire the plan to create the Hymn and Song of Taguig.\nIn order to accomplish this more, the group approached Lt. Col. Demetrio E. De Jesus, the then-leader and conductor of the Philippine Constabulary Band for the music and Victoriano R. Dimaguila for the lyrics. There was also a consultation with National Artist Lucio San Pedro to ask for a comment on the created song.\nOn March 28, 1990, during a gathering at the grounds of the Taguig Town Government, Santos formally presented the anthem and hymn's music sheet to de Guzman. Following this, the anthem was heard for the first time to the public, as being sung by the Metro Manila Commission Choir Group, accompanied by the Banda 1 Tipas Foundation.\nOn July 26, 2016, De Jesus' original music sheet of the anthem and hymn was given to Taguig Heritage Society during its exhibit in Plaza Quezon in Brgy. Sta Ana for safe custody of THS and is destined to be housed when the Taguig City Museum is built.\nDe Jesus and Dimaguila were honored and recognized by mayor Lani Cayetano on October 3, 2022, as outstanding citizens of the city in their contribution.\nOn October 17, 2022, Councilor Gigi Valenzuela De Mesa filed City Resolution No. 31 s. 2022 in the City Council that the anthem is recognized as the Official Hymn of the City of Taguig and encouraged that this should be sung after Lupang Hinirang at all levels of public and private schools in Taguig and in the barangays and offices of the Taguig subjugated government during gatherings and flag raising ceremonies. The resolution would be later approved by all members of the city council led by vice-mayor Arvin Alit.\nFor the first time since the resolution on the adoption of the song as approved by the City Council, the song was sung at the start of the 18th Regular Session of the 7th City Council on November 7, 2022.\n\n\n== Lyrics ==\nThe anthem's lyrics is to serve as inspiration and the love and appreciation for Taguig.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Deborah Tshimpaka Mulanga (born 5 December 1997), known professionally as Rebo Tchulo, is a Congolese singer-songwriter and dancer. She began her music career as a gospel singer. In 2017, Tshimpaka signed a record deal with Ferré Gola's FG Production label. She rose to prominence after releasing several hit singles including \"Coeur Fragile\", \"Ni Nani\", and \"Biloko\". \nIn 2020, she left FG Production and went on to release her debut single, \"Mbote.\" Tshimpaka's subsequent single \"Pepele\", which premiered on 30 June 2021, amassed over one million views on YouTube within four months. In October 2022, she released \"Contaminée\" and followed it up with \"Mukaji Internationale\" in March 2023. She guest performed on Jules Ysok's single, \"Mata Kuna Yo\", which garnered over three million YouTube views in a month and debuted in the top 10 most popular Congolese videos on YouTube. Her single \"Choquer\", released on 15 March 2024, peaked at number two among the Congo's most-watched YouTube videos, with 446,000 views in April of that year.\n\n\n== Early years ==\nDeborah Tshimpaka Mulanga was born on 5 December 1997, in Kinshasa, a metropolis situated in the western expanse of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Growing up in the challenging and unstable Barumbu commune, she developed a penchant for gospel music and often performed interpretations at a Protestant church. Between 2005 and 2008, Tshimpaka began singing in church choirs and soon gained public attention. In 2015, she became a member of another revivalist congregation, where she was noted for her extravagant outfits. However, due to her ostentatious appearance, she was repudiated and later joined Chapelle du Phare church in Kinshasa in 2016. There, she participated in several competitions that allowed her to sing with several Congolese singers.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 2017–present: Widespread recognition with \"Coeur Fragile\" and standalone releases ===\nIn November 2017, Tshimpaka made a guest appearance on Innoss'B's music video for the track \"Top Model,\" from his five-track maxi single Plus. The feature propelled her into the limelight and seized the attention of Ferré Gola, who subsequently featured her in his Congolese rumba-infused music video for the single \"Ma Meilleur Chemise.\" Following this, Tshimpaka signed with Ferré Gola's FG Production label and released her debut single, \"Coeur Fragile,\" which also spawned the singles \"Ni Nani\" and \"Biloko.\" After the success of her singles, she ventured out as an independent artist and released \"Mbote\" on 5 September 2020. \"Mbote\" quickly gained popularity and amassed one million views on YouTube in three months.\nOn 28 June 2021, Tshimpaka announced that her ndombolo-infused single \"Pepele\" was in the conclusive phases of production and slated for debut on 30 June. To promote \"Pepele,\" Tshimpaka released a teaser on the same day, which sparked controversy due to its depiction of lesbianism. As a result, she was mandated to remove contentious scenes by the DRC's Commission Nationale de Censure (National Censorship Commission) before the song's official release. Paradoxically, despite the reproof, the song received widespread recognition and accumulated over one million views on YouTube within four months. \nOn 17 July 2021, Tshimpaka made a guest appearance on Innoss'B's single \"No No\", which swiftly gained widespread acclaim and peaked at second place on BBC Radio 1Xtra. On 8 July 2022, she was again featured in Samarino's ndombolo-infused single \"Epesi Pasi\", from his album Chambre Noire, which has garnered over a million views on YouTube. On 15 October, she unveiled the urban-inspired single \"Contaminée,\" produced by Maisha Soul Records, followed by \"Mukaji Internationale\" in March 2023. Within three weeks of its release, \"Mukaji Internationale\" peaked at number seven in the top 10 most-viewed YouTube videos in Congo for March.\nTshimpaka also featured on Mputu Meya's remix of the track \"Loketo\" alongside Innoss'B on 28 September 2023, which has been viewed over 10 million times on YouTube. On 15 November 2023, she contributed to the collaborative single \"Rumba Forever,\" which brought together several Congolese artists from all generations to honor Congolese rumba, paying tribute to great female figures who have left an indelible mark on the genre. She later joined Innoss'B on stage during his \"Umoja\" humanitarian concert at the La Madeleine concert hall in Brussels, where she performed alongside Yemi Alade and Awilo Longomba. On 15 March 2024, she debuted the single \"Choquer,\" which quickly peaked at number two among the Congo's most-watched YouTube videos, with 446,000 views in April. She was subsequently invited to Frédéric Musa's Planète Rap on Skyrock, where she performed the \"Loketo\" remix.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== References ==",

It is located 729 million light-years from the Solar System and has a dimension of 0.30 x 0.3 arcmin meaning its diameter is 64,000 light-years across. IC 4588 was discovered by Stephane Javelle on July 15, 1903.\n\n\n== Supernova ==\nOne supernova has been discovered in IC 4588 so far: SN 2023ifv.\nSN 2023ifv\nSN 2023ifv was discovered on May 13, 2023 by ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System) which was developed by the University of Hawaii. It was reported by multiple astronomers from University of Hawaii, South African Astronomical Observatory, ESO, UAI Obstech, Oxford/QUB, Queen's University Belfast, Oxford and Harvard; via a cyan-ATLAS filter which was taken using ATLAS Haleakala telescope. The supernova reached a magnitude of 18.\nOn May 19, 2023, C. Fremling, D. Neill, and Y. Sharma on the behalf of the SDEM Team from Caltech and the Zwicky Transient Facility, confirmed SN 2023ifv to be a Type Ia supernova. The supernova probably resulted from the destruction of a white dwarf in a binary system.\n\n\n== References ==",

Despite receiving a total insurance amount of 860 crores from both central and state governments, farmers have only received a fraction of it, amounting to just 13 crores. This disparity has led to widespread discontent among farmers, prompting strikes and hunger strikes organized by the Shetkari Sangharsha Samiti (Farmers' Struggle Committee) under the leadership of Gangabhishan Thaware. The protests have seen active participation from various farmers, demanding fair compensation for their losses.\n\n\n== References ==",

Sonaly village is located 10 km (6.2 mi) upriver from its mouth. \n\n\n== Course ==\nThe Sonaly river originates in the Amantau (Амантау), a small massif of the Kazakh Uplands. Its source is in the southeastern slopes, 106 km (66 mi) to the NNW of lake  Shoshkakol. It heads first southwestwards and describes a wide arch bending westwards and northwestwards while still in its upper reaches. Then it heads roughly northwards all along its course. In its last stretch it bends northwestwards and joins the left bank of the Kulanotpes. The border of Korgalzhyn District, Akmola Region, stretches along the opposite bank.\nThe river valley is wide and its channel is bound by steep banks. In the summer the Sonaly usually stops flowing and splits into disconnected pools.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of rivers of Kazakhstan\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Great Silk Road in Central and Eastern Kazakhstan",

This Invasion made the Pratiharas weak and opened the opportunity for Dharmapala to invade Kannauj.\n\n\n== The Conquest ==\nDharmapala went on to invade Kannauj , where he defeated  and overthrew Indrayudha and installed Chakrayudha on the throne of Kannauj. The 12th verse of the Khalimpur copper plate and the 3rd verse of the Bhagalpur copper plate tells about the attendance of various chieftains from various parts of the India. The verse mentioning the installation of Chakrayudha\n\n जितेन्द्रराज - प्रभृतिनरातीनुपार्जिता येन महोदय श्रीः । दत्वा पुनः सा वलिनार्थयित्रे चक्रायुधायानति वामनाय ॥ ३ ॥\n॥\nThe 12th verse of the Khalimpur Cooper plate inscription mentions the chieftains who attended the imperial assembly   \n\n \nभोजैमत्स्यैः समद्रैः कुरु यदुयवनावन्ति गन्धार कीरैः भूपैर्व्यालोल - मौलि - प्रणति परिणतैः साधु सङ्कीर्यमाणः । हुष्यत् - पञ्चालवृद्धोद्धृत कनकमय स्वाभिवेको - कुम्भो दत्तश्रीः कन्यकुब्जस सललित चलित भूलता लक्ष्म येन ॥ १२ ॥\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nAfter the victory over the capital, Dharmapala had assembled an imperial assembly or durbar which was attended by a number of chieftains who bowed down respectfully and granted approval.\n\n\n== References ==",

He was the former councillor of the Aam Aadmi Party who was elected from Ward 59 in Nehru Vihar, East Delhi.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nHe was born in Uttar Pradesh, India. His early life was marked by modest beginnings and challenges typical of many Indian families. He pursued his education with determination despite the financial constraints.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nIn his political journey with the Aam Aadmi Party, he has been involved in various community development initiatives and has been vocal on issues concerning the welfare of the common people. His work in Delhi has garnered attention, especially in his efforts to address local concerns and advocate for better governance practices.\n\n\n== Delhi riots case ==\nHe came into the spotlight due to his alleged involvement in the 2020 Northeast Delhi communal violence. The Delhi High Court granted him bail in five of the eleven cases registered against him related to the riots. However, he remains in prison in connection with the remaining cases, including the main conspiracy case.\nHussain has also faced a money laundering case for allegedly funding the riots. In a separate case, a Delhi court stated that Hussain was not only a conspirator but “an active rioter” as well, and framed charges against him under various provisions of the Indian Penal Code.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Swedish Film Academy (Swedish: Svenska Filmakademin), formerly the Swedish Film Society (Svenska Filmsamfundet),  is a Swedish association that promotes film in artistic, cultural, and technical terms. It is located in Stockholm, and awards the annual Kurt Linder Scholarship to young filmmakers who have made significant contributions to the Swedish film industry.\n\n\n== History ==\nLike the Swedish Film Institute, the origins of the Swedish Film Academy (Svenska Filmakademin) are in the Swedish Film Society (Svenska Filmsamfundet), which was established in October 1933 by filmmakers and writers Bengt Idestam-Almquist, Arne Bornebusch, Artur Lundkvist, Gustaf Molander, Per-Axel Branner, and others. Writer Eyvind Johnson was also a member.\nThe society created a film archive and museum, which later achieved independence as Filmhistoriska samlingarna, and was in 1964 donated to the newly-formed Swedish Film Institute.\nThe other activity of the society was organising and hosting debates and lectures, and awarding scholarships for filmmaking. In 1967, the Swedish Film Association transformed itself into the Swedish Film Academy, and continued these activities. Director Gösta Werner was the inaugural president of the new academy.\n\n\n== Functions ==\nThe Swedish Film Academy continues to promote film in artistic, cultural, and technical terms.\n\n\n== Governance and membership ==\nThe Swedish Film Academy is governed by a board comprising eight people, known as the Presidium. New members can be proposed by the Presidium, and need to be elected to the academy. As of 2024 the president is Bo-Erik Gyberg.\nAs of 2024 the academy has around 140 members, who pay an annual fee of 300 Swedish krona after being elected.\n\n\n== Scholarships and other awards ==\n\n\n=== Kurt Linder Scholarship ===\nThe academy has awarded the Kurt Linder Scholarship, also known as Kurt Linder Memorial Fund Grant, almost every year since 1969, when the inaugural scholarship was awarded to cinematographer Jörgen Persson. Kurt Linder (1912−1955) was chairman of the student film studio from 1939 to 1945, and later worked on a volunteer basis in the library of the Swedish Film Society. He also wrote articles, and was employed from 1938 until his death as advertising manager at Columbia Film AB in Stockholm.\nEligibility is limited to people under 35 who have made significant contributions to Swedish film. As of 2024 the scholarship is worth 20,000 krona.\n\n\n=== Silver Plaquette ===\nThe Swedish Film Academy's Silver Plaquette (Svenska Filmakademins silverplakett) was awarded to filmmakers in some years between 1968 and 1994, when at least five were awarded. The award itself was a silver disc of 6 cm (2.4 in) diameter, featuring a naked man with a laurel in one hand, and embossed with the words \"Svenska Filmakademin\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "IRAS 05189-2524 is a galaxy merger located in the constellation Lepus. It is located 603 million light-years away from the Solar System and has an approximate diameter of 75,000 light-years.\n\n\n== A luminous galaxy ==\nIRAS 05189-2524 is classified as an ultraluminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG), which is formed by two interacting gas-rich spiral galaxies that merged together. Signs left by merging process, included a single bright nucleus and an outer structure consisting one-sided extension of the inner arms, with its tidal tail  formed by material ripped from the galaxies by gravitational forces.  \nIRAS 05189-2524 is one of the brightest local ULIRG in X-ray with a E = 2–10 keV continuum luminosity of ∼1043 erg s−1 This tend to vary overtime in which the E = 0.5–2 keV was relatively constant during the 2001-2002 observation done by XMM Newton and Chandra. But in 2006 study done by Suzaku shows it was a factor of ∼30 lower. The galaxy has a power output above 10 times that of our sun, emitting a tremendous amount of light at infrared wavelengths. \nMoreover, IRAS 05189-2524 is classified an optical Seyfert 2 galaxy, presenting a hidden broadline region. A study noticed there is ∼70% percent of the bolometric luminosity attributed to its active galactic nucleus, thus making it a quasar. It is represented by its dust enshrouded stage which is shed overtime by the nuclei. There is a sign of high-velocity large-scale outflows detached in neutral, ionized and molecular gas phrases.\nAn observation by XMM Newton and NuSTAR, shows evidence for a blueshifted Fe K absorption feature at E = 7.8 KeV which indicates there is an ultrafast outflow (UFO) with vout = 0.11 ± 0.01c. A relative disk reflection in the broadband X-ray spectrum, shows a highly asymmetric board Fe Kα emission line that extends down to 3 KeV with a Compton scattering component above 10 KeV.\nFurther studies shows there is a new, quasi-luminous hard X-ray and near-IR spectra in IRAS 05189-2524. The Seyfert nucleus is Compton-thin and the near-IR board lines are seen in transmission, similar to X-rays and the medium has an Aṿ/ɴH ratio that is lower to Galactic.  Also, the increase in obscuration at latter approach shows less △Aṿ/△Nн compared to Galactic, thus supporting a correlation between the proximity to the center and properties of obscuring matter. Most of the observed polarization is due to dichroism given the fact, the measured AV is compatible with the broad component of Нα seen in transmission. \nThere are Na i D emission in the system traces dusty filaments on the near side of an extended active galactic nucleus in IRAS 05189-2524 which has projected velocities up to 2000 km s−1. These filaments simultaneously obscure the stellar continuum, serving as complementary probe of the wind, in which they are the strongest in regions of low foreground obscuration.   \n\n\n== References ==",

Trained at the National Theatre School of Canada and at Emily Carr Institute of Art & Design and Concordia University, respectively, Lawson and Pollard are also known both as Gigi L’Amour and Pipi Douleur. This creative team and real-life couple work in video-supplemented performance, video itself, and installation and have presented in arts and queer spaces across the Western Hemisphere, Europe and New Zealand. The duo are known above all for extravagant and intense stage spectacles.\nPerformance studies scholar Peter Dickinson notes their performance work, \"supplements a camp aesthetic derived from drag with sophisticated video projections, original and found sound scores, the art of lipsynch and object-oriented and site-based installation (...)\". As artists, 2boys.tv are interested in the plasticity of video, often using it in a sculptural way instead of as a large screen.\nThe name 2boys.tv was in fact a result of looking for a web domain name for the project. \"(...) we came across this .tv which both references transvestism and transversalism.\" the duo told The New York Times in a 2011 interview, \"But it's actually the domain of the small island in the South Pacific called Tuvalu. The country sold off its domain name to raise money because it's sinking due to global warming. And, of course, we're two boys.\"\n\n\n== Selected performance and presentation history ==\n\n\n=== CatoptROMANTICS (2019) ===\nEncuentro - Hemispheric Institute for Performance and Politics (Mexico City)\nThe artists set up a seance-like environment for a participatory, bilingual performance that explored who is missing at the table. Language, translation and understanding were important themes and practices at Encuentro, with events in Portuguese, Spanish and English. Canadian Art (magazine) reported that performance studies scholar, Diana Taylor called this piece, 'significant'.\n\n\n=== Tightrope (2011 - 2016) ===\n2016 - Operación Queer (Granada, Nicaragua)\n2015 - Phenomena Festival at La Sala Rossa (Montreal)\n2015 - Bienal de la Habana (Cuba)\n2013 - Encuentro - Hemispheric Institute for Performance and Politics (São Paulo)\n2012 - Laboratorio Arte Alameda / International Festival of Cabaret (Mexico City)\n2011 - Triennale, Musee d'art contemporain de Montreal (Montreal)\n2011 - Buddies in Bad times (Toronto)\nTightrope includes original music by Alexis O’Hara and Radwan Ghazi Moumneh and kaleidoscopic video projections and shadow images by Montreal-based lighting designer, Lucie Bazzo. Taking its inspiration from the stories of the disappeared in South America, Tightrope offers a cast of young, local drag queens recruited from the cities to which the work has toured to channel an historical archive of grief and loss around HIV/AIDS. Together with their collaborators, Lawson and Pollard suit the spectating requirements of the local audiences by adapting the content of the piece, especially the language in which it is presented. Tightrope has been presented in English, French, Spanish and Portuguese, shifting the title of the piece for each location thusly: Tightrope (EN) / Code raide (FR) / Cuerda Floja (SP), Corda Bamba (PT). The show uses site-specificity as a key element. Since the piece debuted at Toronto's Buddies in Bad Times Theatre, every iteration begins outside, leading the audience on a public promenade from a place of local significance in the neighbourhood towards the performance venue. The 2015 version for Phénomena Festival performance processed from parc Lahaie in Montréal's Plateau Mont-Royal to the venue the Sala Rossa with members of Montréal drag troupe \"House of Bogue\" Judy Virago, CT Thorne, Jamie Ross, and 2Fik leading while O’Hara gave random spectators letters written by the show's creators to read out recounting different scenarios of vigil for the missing.\n\n\n=== (re)Generation (2012) ===\nPhenomena Festival at La Sala Rossa (Montreal)\nCreated to mark the 10th anniversary of 2boys.tv collaboration, (re)Generation pays tribute to the duo's body of cabaret work after Phenomena Festival asked them to produce a retrospective. Thinking with drag culture where knowledge is passed from queen to queen, instead of performing the retrospective themselves 2boys.tv cast favourite local drag artists to learn and embody the performances and, as Lawson says, \"perhaps in a way own them afterwards.\" Lawson and Pollard were onsite, \"like mad scientists to bring these Frankensteins to life.\" Re-performers included favourites of the Anglo-Montreal underground: Jordan Arseneault, Antonio Bavaro, Joshua Pavan, An T Horné, Holly Gaulthier-Frankel.\n\n\n=== Phobophilia (2008, 2009, 2011) ===\n2011 - Under the Radar Festival (NYC)\n2009 - National Review of Live Art (Glasgow)\n2008 - Studio 303 (Montreal)\ndate unknown - (Chile)\ndate unknown - (Argentina)\nDesigned as a meditation on fear following the Abu Ghraib photography torture scandal, Phobophilia (meaning 'arousal from fear') is a 1-hour, multimedia production performed for very small audiences, i.e.: 20 - 25 people at a time. Participants are blindfolded and led \"in a human chain of trusting hands on shoulders\" to a second location into the near-darkness of a small room to observe what Lawson calls \"a peculiar interrogation\". Canadian performance studies scholar Peter Dickinson notes, \"In this piece a pop-up book is transformed into a scale-model theatre, which Lawson’s projected shadow self navigates in a way that contrasts with our initial glimpse of his live body: perched precariously on a box, arms outstretched, head hooded by a paper bag (...).\" Projection and shadow are used in this very dark, surreal, highly visual and sonic piece referencing the poetic and cinematographic World War II era work of Jean Cocteau. The piece examines the line between fear, torture, their sexualization, and pop culture's voyeurism of both. \"It is a project specifically designed to address fear, as an emotional but also as a political weapon\" Pollard told Le Devoir.\n\n\n=== Zona Pellucida (2009) ===\nBuddies in Bad Times Theatre (Toronto)\nThe title, Zona Pellucida refers to the translucent protective material around a human egg. This 45-minute performance that Toronto's NOW magazine called, \"Queer film theory meets stylish techno-savvy (...)\" works with multiple, small format projection and frequent audio samples of Vincenzo Bellini's opera La Sonnambula and Bing Crosby's Just One More Chance to create a dreamlike, filmic puzzle. An interrupted fairy tale allegory is re-played via projection on a succession smaller and smaller miniature proscenium stages in what scholar Dickinson suggests is a mise en abyme of each previous version. Lawson plays a gothic drag queen who communicates mainly through classic lines of film dialogue, invoking many campy screen heroines from cult movies, such as Anne Baster from All About Eve, Gene Rowlands from Opening Night and Elizabeth Taylor from Suddenly, Last Summer. These lip synchings convey a sense of alienation and distance exploring themes of victimization, internal struggle with sexuality, and guilt. Critics have compared the effect to the works of film maker David Lynch and Quebec Playwrights, Marie Brassard and Robert Lepage.\n\n\n=== Battle Hymn (2002, 2013) ===\n2013 - Dixon Place (NYC)\n2002 - Club Plastic, Festival Mix Milano (Milan)\n\n\n== Installation ==\n\n\n=== ARCADE series (2009, 2011) ===\n2011 - darlingARCADE - Darling Foundry / Urban Occupations Urbaines\n2009 - boutiqueARCADE - Festival Les Escales Improbables\nAn ongoing work for the duo, the 2011 variation collaborated with an artist-run centre and Shauna Janssen's curatorial collective Urban Occupations Urbaines, creating a site-based installation in Griffintown, one of Montreal's many historically working-class and rapidly gentrifying neighbourhoods. Collaborators from the Montreal art scene were hired to produce short audio narratives with diorama's contained in shoeboxes which were animated by Lawson & Pollard when visitors selected a corresponding shoe from display on the walls of the venue. Laura Levin writing for Canadian Theatre Review remarked, \"Soon, I had toured a dozen shoeboxes on my own, experiencing memetic, fantastical, strange, and celebratory performances.\"\n\n\n=== Persephone (2007) ===\nLa Biennale de Montréal\nIn this new-genre cabaret performance and installation moving beyond cross-dressing and gender-bending, the duo collapses linguistic distinctions, bridges the divide between stage, gallery and street, and operates as actor, director, and audience to produce an incessant relocation of boundaries.\n\n\n== Selected film and video ==\nTeddy Bears’ Picnic (2001)\n15 Questions (Something Blue) (2002)\n\n\n== Publications ==\nLawson, Stephen. \"Emcee Etiquettes: Experts Weigh In on How to Host the Perfect Cabaret Night.\" Canadian Theatre Review, vol. 177, 2019, p. 67-72.\nPollard, Aaron and Stephen Lawson. \"Bonus Insert.\" Canadian Theatre Review, vol. 150, 2012, p. 1-17.\nPollard, Aaron and Stephen Lawson. \"Tightrope, Translation and Transformation.\" Performance Research, vol. 21:5, 2016, p. 131-133.\n\n\n== Prizes and awards ==\n2009 Victor Martyn Lynch-Staunton Award for outstanding achievement by a mid career artist working in the Interdisciplinary Arts, Canada Council for the Arts\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "The Duchess of Coolgardie is a 1896 British stage play by \nCyril Clare and Euston Leigh. It has been called an \"important play\" because of its overseas success.\nThe play was first produced at Drury Lane Theatre in London, where it was acted during the entire autumn Season of 1896, under the management of John Coleman. This production was backed by West Australian businessmen. The writers had never visited Australia but it was set in Western Australia.\nThe West Australian said the play \"claimed the close attention of an immense audience, and each tableau was cheered with enthusiasm... a complete success, a success which has been generously endorsed by the leading press critics.\"\nThe Age called it \" a melodrama of the crudest and most conventional type... sheer drivel from beginning to end, and it speaks very little for the common sense of the West Australian ring that they should have found tho money for so ridiculous a melodrama.\"\nThe play was presented in Australia in 1898 and 1899 by Alfred Dampier. The Sunday Times said the play is \"seemingly, not one of very great merit from a literary standpoint. It is, hotvever.'a\npiece full of life and color.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Duchess of Coolgardie at Ausstage\nComplete text of play at Project Gutenberg",

        "content": "Linda G. Lambert is an American academic and an author. She is a professor emeritus at California State University, East Bay.\nLambert is most known for her work connecting the domains of leadership and literature, with a primary emphasis on the concepts of constructivist leadership, leadership capacity, liberation and literature. Her authored works include The Constructivist Leader (1st and 2nd editions), which also received the National Book Award from the NCSD in 1997. Her works have been translated into Arabic, Chinese, Hebrew, Lithuanian, and Malay, and they have been published in academic journals, including the Journal of Educational Change and the Canadian Journal of Educational Administration and Policy.\n\n\n== Education ==\nLambert earned her B.A. from Washburn University in 1966. In 1978, she completed her M.A. in Educational Administration. Later, in 1983, she obtained her Doctor of Education degree from the University of San Francisco in Organization and Leadership.\n\n\n== Career ==\nBetween 1966 and 1975, she served as a secondary school teacher in junior and senior high schools. From 1977 to 1980, she directed the Reform in Intermediate and Secondary Education project while concurrently acting as the curriculum coordinator in Castro Valley from 1978 to 1980. Following this, she assumed the position of principal at San Jose Middle School in Marin County, California. During a brief period from 1986 to 1987, she served as the director of professional development at the Marin County Office of Education. Subsequently, she transitioned to academia, serving as a professor in the Department of Education Leadership at California State University East Bay from 1987 to 1999. Throughout her tenure at the university, she held additional roles including department chair during two terms (1991–93 and 1995–97) and director of the Center for Educational Leadership from 1995 to 1998. She also served as the Staff Development Director sponsored by the U.S. State Department and Egyptian Ministry of Education from 1989 to 1991. Since 1992, she has served as a Consultant in leadership, alongside her position as professor emeritus at California State University East Bay, a title she has held since 1998.\n\n\n== Works ==\nIn 1995, Lamber was the lead author of The Constructivist Leader. The book provides educational leaders with a framework for reciprocal, purposeful learning within a community, emphasizing constructivist leadership principles, updated theory, strategies for implementing standards-based reform and authentic assessment, and addressing issues of equity, diversity, and multiculturalism. Her 1997 book Who Will Save Our Schools?: Teachers as Constructivist Leaders offered a synthesis of teaching, learning, and leading principles, proposing innovative strategies for school reform.\nWhile exploring the impact of leadership on student learning through stories of three schools of varying leadership capacities, her publication titled Building Leadership Capacity in Schools offered a new framework for building organizational and human capacities and improving educational outcomes. Moreover, in 2003, she co-authored a book titled Building Leadership Capacity for School Improvement with Alma Haris. Her books emphasized the importance of maximizing leadership capabilities at all levels within schools to sustain and enhance improvement efforts.\nLambert's 2016 publication Liberating Leadership Capacity: Pathways to Educational Wisdom explored the evolution of leadership in education. The book also advocated for educators to become the primary designers of their own and their students' learning through constructivist principles. In her review of the book, Arthur L. Costa, said \"In Liberating Leadership Capacity, a compelling driving concept is that 'leadership capacities are present in the room'. The authors describe organizational conditions that promote skillful dialogue, continual learning, building trust, and sharing a common vision among members. In such schools teachers become the leaders of learning and students become the leaders of the future\". She also co-authored the book Women's Ways of Leading. The book explored a new paradigm of leadership based on values, self-awareness, and community, arguing for the importance of qualities traditionally associated with women in shaping a more enlightened and inclusive world. Moreover, she also authored The Cairo Codex. The novel followed anthropologist Justine Jenner's journey through ancient and present-day Egypt as she uncovers an ancient codex that threatens to challenge the foundations of major world religions amidst political turmoil and personal discovery. The second novel in the trilogy, The Italian Letters, was set in Italy and the third novel, A Rapture of Ravens: Awakening in Taos was set in Taos, New Mexico.\n\n\n== Research ==\nLambert's research explored and drew conclusions in multiple areas: teacher leadership in professional development schools; adult learning among policy makers, researchers and staff developers; high leadership capacity schools; shared leadership; and women in leadership. In related research, she discussed the transition from a traditional model of educational leadership with the principal as the sole instructional leader to a collaborative approach involving multiple educators, highlighting the untapped potential of teachers' talents and advocating for sustainable improvements in learning outcomes. In her 2003 paper, she advocated for redefining leadership in education to include teachers as leaders through the concept of constructivist leadership, promoting broad-based participation and skill development among teachers. She also conducted a study on schools with high leadership capacity and those in the process of developing it, analyzing their characteristics, relationships, and patterns contributing to lasting school improvement through effective leadership. Her more recent work has focused on promoting learning and engagement for both students and adults in schools, highlighting the role of effective leadership, collaborative decision-making processes, and district support in sustaining school improvement efforts.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n1996 – Helen Heffernan Award, California Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development\n1997 – National Book of the Year Award for The Constructivist Leader, National Council on Staff Development\n1998 – Professor of the Year, California State University, East Bay\n2023 – Woman Icon in Leadership, San Diego, California\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Books ===\nPhoenix: A Guide to Phoenix, Scottsdale, and the Valley (1986) ISBN 0915719029\nThe Constructivist Leader (1995) ISBN 9780807734629\nWho Will Save Our Schools?: Teachers as Constructivist Leaders (1996) ISBN 9780803964624\nBuilding Leadership Capacity in Schools (1998) ISBN 9780871203076\nLeadership Capacity for Lasting School Improvement (2003) ISBN 9780871207784\nWomen's Ways of Leading (2009) ISBN 9781608441129\nThe Cairo codex (2013) ISBN 9781933512464\nA Rapture of Ravens: Awakening in Taos: A Novel (The Justine Trilogy) (2015) ISBN 9781933512501\nLiberating Leadership Capacity: Pathways to Educational Wisdom (2016) ISBN 9780807757512\n\n\n=== Selected articles ===\nLambert, L.

He was named a Living National Treasure in 2023 for his work in the field of Nagaita-Chugata.\n\n\n== Style ==\nThe Nagaita-Chugata dyeing technique is typically used in the making of Yukata. Ise katagami, handcut paper stencils from the Mie Prefecture are used to apply resist paste to both sides of the kimono cloth. This technique was common until the last century where a cheaper technique called chusen became popular to dye fabric on both sides.\n Matubara mainly uses real indigo to dye his kimonos.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "2MASX J22550681+0058396 or known as PGC 1180817, is a type E-S0 lenticular galaxy located in constellation Pisces. It is located 733 million light-years from the Solar System and has an approximate diameter of 95,000 light-years.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n2MASX J22550681+0058396 has an active galactic nucleus (AGN). It is a LINER galaxy whose nucleus presents an emission spectrum characterized by broad lines of weak ion atoms. This is an interesting object since not only it represents the most numerous active galactic nuclei population but the link between normal and active galaxies suggested by low-X-ray luminosity.\nMoreover, 2MASX J22550681+0058396 is a post-starburst galaxy which is caused by end product of galaxies that have merged within the past billion years. The merger event had caused the gas to drive up to the center and created an abundance of new stars, of which the brightest are visible in the remanent galaxy's core. This might be due to burst duration increasing with stellar mass, from 120 to 250 Myr, indicating there is enough molecular gas available in close pairs to fuel the burst.\nVisible shells and tails surrounding 2MASX J22550681+0058396, are also caused in which the shells are formed through radial merger events while tails are remnants of circular merger infall, suggesting that the orbital angular momentum plays a more crucial role in transforming the host galaxy as expected.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Edwin Dalton was a portrait painter and photographer active in England and Australia from 1818 to 1865.\n\n\n== England ==\n\nEdwin (Edward) Dalton was born in England in the early 1800s. He exhibited at the London Royal Academy between 1818 and 1844, and received the Society of Arts' silver palette in 1824. In either 1841 or 1842 he married  Magdalena (née Ross). She was the sister of William Ross, one of Queen Victoria's favourite portrait painters, and one of England's last great miniature painters. Initially specialising in portrait painting Dalton and Magdalena enjoyed the patronage of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in the 1840s. They both worked at Buckingham Palace where they made copies after works in the Royal collection by other artists. In 1846, Dalton also taught lithography to Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.\n\n\n== Australia ==\n \nDalton travelled to Australia sometime before 1853, as by this time he had set up a business as a portrait painter in Victoria. In May of that year he exhibited portraits by himself, and portraits by Queen Victoria at the Melbourne Fine Arts Exhibition.\nIn January 1855, Dalton arrived in Sydney from Melbourne and set up a temporary studio above Piddingtons Bookshop in George Street. The following month, the Empire newspaper singled Dalton's crayon portraits out for praise, particularly those of Chief Justice Sir Alfred Stephen and Mr. Lamb. In March Dalton travelled to Melbourne to exhibit works assuring his patrons in Sydney he would be returning in a few weeks.  A few months later he pledged several works, including drawings by Queen Victoria, to be included in the Fine Art Exhibition held at Mr Baker's Repository, Swanston Street, Melbourne.\nBy November 1855, Dalton seems to have settled in Sydney. The Sydney Morning Herald enthused about the number of portraitists now working in the Colony and the proliferation of those using the daguerreotype. While citing the merits of photographers Gow, Glaister and Freeman they made special mention of Dalton's crayon portraits.These they felt were the equal of any produced by photography or an artist using oils. They also mention Dalton was taking collodion-type portraits to which he applied his artistic skills.\n\nOn 22 December 1855, Dalton exhibited his crayon portraits and collodion miniatures at the new Sydney Mechanics' School of Arts, alongside the work of other Sydney photographers. He also exhibited signed pictures, drawn and lithographed by Queen Victoria. These included portraits of the Prince of Wales, Albert, Alice and Alfred, all completed in 1846.\nIn January the following year Dalton opened the doors to his new photographic studio at 245 George Street, Sydney - just five doors down from King Street. Advertising announcing the event indicates the studio was following the latest trends from London and Paris by  specialising in collodion portrait photography. It also invited the public to visit the studio to look at works by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert made while under the tutelage of the Dalton's. The benefits of the new process were also pointed out in a quote from the London Times, \nThe collodion portraits equal the finest mezzotint engravings. They are clear and distinct—free from glare and reflection—and convey a pleasing resemblance of the human features. Scarcely a more valuable present could be given to a friend.\nOver the course of 1856, Dalton Studio established itself as a destination for visiting celebrities as well as local dignitaries, including Premiere Stuart Donaldson. Dalton's portrait of English operatic soprano Madame Anna Bishop was singled out by the Sydney newspaper Empire for,  \n\n  its fidelity of portraiture, depth of tone, and beauty of, colouring, and further stating it ranked, with any work, in its particular line of art, we have yet seen in the colony.\nIn March 1857 Dalton moved his studio two doors down the road to 243 George Street, above the offices of the auctioneers Chatto and Hughes. This move appears to have enabled Dalton to set up a separate studio devoted to crayon painting, and by May he was advertising sittings devoted to that process. At this time other photographic studios produced similar hand finished photographic portraiture. Primary among these was William Hetzer who in September announced his ability to produce full size photographic portraits of Dr Aaron and Dr Bland, with no slurring of the eyes, and the very near approach to natural colour. The colour was presumably added by Hetzer's wife Hekla.\nThroughout 1857 Dalton continued to work in a variety of mediums but specialising in collodion and crayon portraits which were finished in a style similar to ivory miniatures. One of these, a portrait of Killner Walker who died when the ill-fated Dunbar was shipwrecked at South Head, was copied directly from a dim and faded daguerreotype. This painting, and one of Mariann Egan (another of the 121 passengers who died in the wreck) was put on public view in Dalton's studio where they formed part of the many expressions of grief by Sydneysiders shocked by the disaster.\n\nBy the end of 1858 Dalton had opened the Royal Photographic Portrait Establishment at 480 George Street. The name, it seems, reflects his continued promotion of his connections to Queen Victoria. On 8 December Dalton exhibited three examples of his \"crayotype\" process which combined, \"the finish and brilliancy of artistic portraiture with the truthfulness, relief, and power of the photograph\", at the conversazione of the Philosophical Society. Dalton claimed that the process (photographs hand finished using crayons) was his own invention, although there were others in Sydney producing work using similar hand-colouring processes.\n\nIn October 1859, the first copies of Dalton's composite photograph of 79 portraits of the members of the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales were made available for sale. Sourcing such a large number of individual portraits required 3–4 months of Dalton's time and the result was touted as being, far beyond anything of its kind previously attempted in the colony. At the centre of the image was Sir Daniel Cooper wearing his official robe while around him were members of his administration, supported by those who occupied prominent positions in the political arena. At 43 x 33 centimeters the final print was thought to be a convenient size for either framing or transmission to distant friends. The photograph, along with his \"crayotypes\",  was displayed in that year's conversazione hosted by the Philosophical Society in the hall of the Australian Subscription Library, in Bent Street, Sydney. It is clear that by the end of 1859 Dalton was using a range of photographic processes including portraits in crayon, oils, watercolours, paper, collodion, as well as microscopic and stereoscopic photography.\nOn Wednesday 27 August 1862 disaster struck. A fire which started in the George Street premises of Mr. Foster (a confectioner) quickly spread and engulfed the Dalton's photographic studio on the upper stories of the building, completely destroying its contents. Losses included photographic instruments, chemical supplies, several hundred negative plates, crayotype portraits and etchings made by Queen Victoria which the Dalton's had brought with them from England. Just a week after losing his entire stock Dalton opened a new premises at 320 George Street, near Hunter Street, and immediately resumed his photographic work.\n\n\n== End of Dalton's Photography Studio ==\nIn December 1863 Dalton again exhibited his work at the conversazione of the Philosophical Society of New South Wales in the Australian Conscription Library. In May 1864, he was displaying life sized crayon portraits of Sir John Young, Reverend John West, Mr. TW Cape, Thomas Cooper and Charles J Fairfax - the last three of which were made directly from old photographs as the sitters were no longer living. Dalton also intimated that he was preparing to leave Australia and there was talk of his employees, Bradley and Allen taking over his business. Later Bradley would claim to have taken all the photographic portraits at Dalton's studio between 1859 and 1865.\nBy the end of the year Dalton was advertising a reduction in the price of his stock of cartes-de-visites, perhaps an indication of wanting to wind up his business. But in a surprise move Bradley and Allen rather than taking over from Dalton opened their own premises at 360 George Street, in January 1865. Here they advertised crayon portraits, vignetted heads, miniatures on ivory, carte-de-visite and collodiotypes. Mrs Oswald Allen, who had worked as a photographer and artist in Manchester before working for Dalton, did all of the crayon portraits and ivory miniatures. Bradley took the photographs. By March 1867 photographer William Bradley had split from Oswald and Allen and opened his own business at 140 Pitt Street Sydney.\nDalton auctioned his household furniture in February 1865 and sold his studio to Thomas Felton. Six months later the young Scottish artist Montague Scott was the principal artist at Dalton's Royal Photographic Studio where he was commissioned to finish a painting of John Sullivan delivering an address. The painting was 1.29 metres high x 1.57 metres wide. In 1867, Felton won a medal at the Intercolonial Exhibition of Australasia for tinted and untinted photo portraits produced in Dalton's old studio. By August, Montague Scott had also split from Dalton's and was now manager of the Sydney and Melbourne Photographic Company, at 392 George Street, above Mr Sands.\nIn April 1868, Dalton's premises at 320 George Street were sold to Mr. Freeman (Late of Freeman Brothers and Freeman Brothers and Prout) who moved from his premises in Castlereagh Street. In doing so Freeman also purchased Dalton's photographic equipment and a large stock of negatives which were combined with the carte-de-visite photographs taken by Freeman Brothers up until 10 February 1867 - in total 22,000 negatives. Here Freeman continued to work in collodiotypes, children's portraits, and photographs finished in oils, watercolours and crayons under the name of Freeman's Studio.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Gaji bags (Chinese: 茄芷袋; pinyin: Jīa Zhǐ Dài) are large, typically unfastened bags with parallel handles that emerge from the sides of its pouch, often used as reusable shopping bags. Gaji bags originated from the rural village of Jing Liao in the Houbi District of Tainan, Taiwan during the Japanese Colonial Period.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name \"Gaji\" comes from the Japanese term for bag weaving, かぎ編み (kagiami).\n\n\n== History ==\nInitially woven by rice farmers seeking extra income, these bags were crafted from Cyperus malaccensis, a plant abundant in nearby marshes. During Taiwan's industrialisation in the 1960s, Gaji bags transitioned from plant to machine-sewn nylon mesh, offering higher durability and affordability. Thus, Gaji bags became popular Taiwanese household items due to their practicality, used by mothers for grocery shopping and farmers for harvests. However, they faced a decline in the 1980s among younger consumers seeking more fashionable alternatives.\nThe resurgence of Gaji bags began in the early-mid 2000s, after the documentary film Let It Be released in 2004 highlighted the resilience of Jing Liao farmers, while a famous singer adopting the Gaji bag as a logo further boosted its popularity.\nToday, Gaji bags have evolved beyond traditional handbags, with designers incorporating the nylon mesh into various products. Available in a range of colours and styles, they appeal to both older generations, valuing heritage, and younger generations appreciating retro-chic aesthetics as well as foreign travellers to Taiwan.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "The Sundarbans Biosphere Reserve is a biosphere reserve in the Indian state of West Bengal, based on the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere (MAB) Programme list. It is one of the 18 biosphere reserves in India and the third largest in terms of area. The Biosphere Reserve is constituted of the Sundarbans area spread across South 24 Parganas and North 24 Parganas district districts of West Bengal. The Indian Sundarbans as a Biosphere Reserve is bounded by the Muri Ganga River in the west and the Hariabhanga and Raimangal rivers in the east. Sundarbans has a very rich diversity of aquatic and terrestrial flora and fauna. In fact, the highly productive ecosystems of the Sundarbans act as natural fish nurseries. It provides habitat for the Royal Bengal Tiger (Panthera tigris tigris).\nThe Sundarbans Biosphere Reserve or Indian Sundarbans covers an area of ​​9,630 square kilometers (3,720 sq mi) and is divided into core, buffer, and transi-tion zones. The area of ​​reserved forest under the Biosphere Reserve is about 4263 km2, of which 55% land is under vegetation cover and the remaining 45 per cent under wetland/intertidal zone. About 40% of the reserved forest area is covered under the protected area. The protected areas under the Biosphere Reserve are Sundarbans National Park, Sajnekhali Wildlife Sanctuary, Lothian Island Wildlife Sanctuary and Haliday Island Wildlife Sanctuary. The Sundarbans Biosphere Reserve area includes the Sundarbans Tiger Reserve, which comprises a total of 2558 km2 of protected forest area.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe Sundarbans Biosphere Reserve covers an area of ​​9,630 square kilometers (3,720 sq mi) in the South 24 Parganas and North 24 Parganas district districts of south-eastern West Bengal, as well as over 100 small and large islands. It extends from Haroa and Hasnabad blocks of North 24 Parganas district in the north to the Bay of Bengal in the south. There are numerous wide rivers running through the biosphere reserve, which flow mainly from north to south; Seawater flows into the biosphere reserve through river channels. The eastern boundary of the biosphere reserve is Haribhanga and Raimangal rivers. Wetlands are observed in the northern part of the biosphere reserve, which are mainly fresh water. The western boundary is determined by the Hooghly river basin.\n\n\n==== Geology ====\n\n\n==== Hydrology ====\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Geologic history ===\n\n\n=== Human history ===\n\n\n==== Early inhabitants populations ====\n\n\n==== Sundarbans Biosphere Reserve established ====\nAs part of the Man and the Biosphere Program (MAB) adopted by the UNESCO General Conference in 1970, the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India has adopted the National MAB Program and declared the entire 9630 km2 area of ​​the Indian Sundarbans as a biosphere. The Indian part of the Sundarbans was established as a Biosphere Reserve by a notification in 1989, with the objective of coordinating and integrating conservation, research and training activities to create conditions for better harmony between man and the environment. In 1989, Sundarbans National Park, the core part of the biosphere reserve, was recognized as a World Heritage Site due to its unique ecosystem. The Sundarbans Biosphere Reserve was included in the global network of Biosphere Reserves in November 2001 as the second Biosphere Reserve from India after the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve.\n\n\n== Natural resources ==\n\n\n=== Flora ===\nThe 4,263 square kilometer area of the biosphere reserve consists by dense forest and watersheds, known as reserved forest, and the forest contains mangrove trees. Other than reserved forest areas, other parts of the biosphere reserve contain mangroves as well as other plants, while reserved forest areas contain a variety of mangrove species. The main trees in the forest area are sundari and garan, but an abundance of garan trees is observed. Forms almost monotonous forest with hoglar bushes along the banks of rivers and watersheds.\n\n\n=== Fauna ===\nThe Sundarbans Biosphere Reserve has 58 species of mammals, 55 species of reptiles and around 248  birds species. Bengal tiger are the largest apex predators that live in forests and have no predators of their own except humans and crocodiles. River beds and wetlands are home to gharials and crocodiles, but these species are listed as endangered species in the IUCN Red List. Most of the native mammal species of the area are in the forest, except for the locally extinct rhinoceros and wild buffalo.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nGhosh, Priyanka (October 2015). \"Conservation and conflicts in the Sundarban Biospher Reserve, India\".

        "content": "Swainsona plagiotropis, commonly known as red swainsona-pea is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae and is endemic to eastern continental Australia. It is a prostrate or ascending perennial herb with imparipinnate leaves with 13 to 25 narrowly egg-shaped or narrowly lance-shaped leaflets and racemes of 2 to 5 reddish-purple flowers.\n\n\n== Description ==\nSwainsona plagiotropis is a prostrate or ascending perennial herb, that typically grows to a height of up to 15 cm (5.9 in) and sometimes has hairy stems. Its leaves are imparipinnate, mostly 50–120 mm (2.0–4.7 in) long with 13 to 25 narrowly elliptic or narrowly egg-shaped leaflets with the narrower end towards the base, the side leaflets 10–17 mm (0.39–0.67 in) long and 1–4 mm (0.039–0.157 in) wide with broadly egg-shaped stipules mostly 5–9 mm (0.20–0.35 in) long at the base of the petioles. The flowers are reddish-purple, arranged in racemes of 2 to 5, the flowers 10–15 mm (0.39–0.59 in) long, on a hairy pedicel about 3 mm (0.12 in) long. The sepals are joined at the base to form a tube about 2.5 mm (0.098 in) long, with lobes longer than the tube. The standard petal is 12–15 mm (0.47–0.59 in) long and 10–20 mm (0.39–0.79 in) wide, the wings about 8–10 mm (0.31–0.39 in) long and the keel about 9–10 mm (0.35–0.39 in) long and 4–5 mm (0.16–0.20 in) deep. Flowering occurs from August to November, and the fruit is an oval to oblong pod 15–25 mm (0.59–0.98 in) long and 8–10 mm (0.31–0.39 in) long, with the remains of the strongly curved style 8–9 mm (0.31–0.35 in) long.\n\n\n== Taxonomy and naming ==\nSwainsona plagiotropis was first formally described in 1875 by Ferdinand von Mueller in his Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae from a specimen he collected near the junction of the Murray and Campaspe Rivers.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nRed swainson-pea grows in grassland, often in table drains in the west of New South Wales and a few places in north-central Victoria, mostly along the upper Murray River.\n\n\n== Conservation status ==\nSwainsona plagiotropis is listed as \"vulnerable\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and the Victorian Government, the New South Wales Government Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016 and the Victorian Government Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988.\n\n\n== References ==",

They formed a tribe named Munzuroğlu, inspired by the name of the region they were in. They left Munzur in 1759-1760, and came to the Zeyve region of Baskil and settled here. In 1789-1790, the daughter of Veli, the tribal leader, was kidnapped by members of the same tribe, and the kidnappers were killed by the sons of Veli. After the incident, the tribe decided to leave Zeyve, with one of the conflicting sides going to Erzurum and the other going to Malatya, so that the blood feud would not grow any more. The Ottoman state, who wanted to eliminate the authority gap in the region, wanted to give the tribe principality (Ağalık) to the Munzuroğlu tribe. They started migrating, which was when they stopped using Munzuroğlu and began using Velioğlu after their original leader. Today they largely live in the provinces Sivas, Yozgat, Giresun, Sakarya, Trabzon, Esiroğlu, Kastamonu, Bayburt, Zonguldak, Erzurum, Malatya, Elazığ, Şanlıurfa, Kars, Iğdır, Gaziantep, Rize, İstanbul, Ankara, İzmir, Osmaniye, Adana, Tunceli, Sinop, and many other Turkish provinces and even in some other former Ottoman states.\nThe tribe has no relation to Hüseyin Velioğlu.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Yasuhiro Nakura (Japanese: 名倉 靖博, Hepburn: Nakura Yasuhiro) is a Japanese animator, illustrator, character designer, and director.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nNakura was born in Hamakita, Shizuoka, Japan, on January 10, 1959. His parents ran a textile shop.\n\n\n== Career ==\nHe enrolled in an animation course offered by Toei Animation that he saw advertised in Manga Shounen and moved to Tokyo. After completing the course, he joined Studio Carpenter where he debuted as an in-between animator on Starzinger (1978), and later as a key animator on Dotakon (1981). He worked at Studio Carpenter for about three years and then went freelance, mainly for Toei Animation's works.\nHis character concepts were used for the 1984 television series Little Memole, which he also worked on as an animation director (his debut in the role). The following year, he was the animation director for Mamoru Oshii's film, Angel's Egg, with designs by Yoshitaka Amano, in which he supervised and corrected drawings to follow Amano's original image boards. In 1987, he served as character designer and animation director to another feature film, The Tale of Genji (1987) with director Gisaburō Sugii. In 1990, he participated in Moomin as the animation character designer, having been a fan of the series prior.  He also served as the character designer and chief animation director for Rintaro's Metropolis (2001).\nAt some point in his career, Nakura began to take on more work as an illustrator, rather than an animator or animation director. While he continued to work on animated series and films, his output in either decreased significantly during the 1990s and 2000s. He was the character designer and chief animation director for the Tenshu Monogatari arc of Ayakashi: Samurai Horror Tales and was the animation director for Gothicmade in 2012, but contributed in minor key animation roles between them.\nIn the early 2010s, Nakura developed a relationship with animation studio Shaft as a key animator and animation director on the Monogatari series. His output in the industry increased during this time as he contributed to other Shaft series like Mekakucity Actors (2014) and contributed as a guest director, designer, and animator for an episode of the Bones series Space Dandy (2014). In 2016, Nakura worked as the main layout artist, layout setting designer, and art setting designer for Shaft's adaptation of March Comes In like a Lion. He also regularly contributed to some of the series' ending animation themes, which he storyboarded, directed, and animated on his own.\n\n\n=== Style ===\nDirector and founder of studio Satelight Tsuneo Maeda, who was the animation technical director for The Tale of Genji, described Nakura as an emotional person, which he called rare among key animators, and that he was slow, which was connected to his tenacity and made his work attractive. Maeda also considered Nakura to not be pattern-based, and thus it was always difficult or mysterious as to how his drawings and work would come out. Although he said that it may be difficult for some of his drawings to be used, Maeda lamented that Nakura was able to create cuts of animation that others could never draw as well.\n\n\n== Works ==\n\n\n=== Teleivison series ===\n  Highlights main staff roles.\n\n\n=== OVAs/ONAs ===\n\n\n=== Films ===\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n=== Book citations ===\nAnimage October (1985).

He represented Ada in the Assembly of Vojvodina from 2004 to 2008. Elected as the candidate of a local citizens' group, he later served with G17 Plus.\n\n\n== Private career ==\nMicsíz is a graduated mechanical engineer from Ada. He is a longtime owner and director of the metal industry company Termometal.\n\n\n== Politician ==\nAn independent political movement called With Knowledge and Heart for a Successful Municipality won a plurality victory in Ada in the 2004 Serbian local elections, taking eleven out of twenty-nine seats in the local assembly. The movement's leader Ferenc Ürményi became mayor and formed a coalition government with other independent groups and with G17 Plus. Micsíz was elected to the local assembly as one of the movement's candidates. He was also elected to the provincial assembly under the movement's banner in the concurrent 2004 Vojvodina provincial election.\nMicsíz chaired Ada's sports and technical committee in the 2004–08 term and was appointed to its security council in 2007.

        "content": "The Ensoniq EPS-16 Plus is a sampling keyboard produced by Ensoniq starting in 1990. It was the successor to the EPS, one of the first truly affordable samplers on the market. The EPS-16 Plus uses 16-bit samples at seven sample rates ranging from 11.2 kHz to 44.6 kHz and features 13 onboard effects. The unit was available in both keyboard and rackmount versions (EPS-16R). Some versions of the EPS-16 Plus were sold as \"Turbo\" units, which included an extra 1 MB of flash memory and SCSI upgrades. These units are designated with a \"T\" after the model number.\nThe EPS-16 Plus features a mono input and stereo outputs, made useful by the unit's stereo panning and internal effects. It was succeeded in 1992 by the stereo-capable ASR-10.\n\n\n== Notable users ==\nNotable users include Havoc of Mobb Deep, RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan as well as Wu-Tang affiliate True Master, and Speech of Arrested Development.\nDe facto Wu-Tang Clan leader RZA produced some tracks for Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) on an EPS-16 Plus, including the group's biggest single \"C.R.E.A.M.\". He then sold the unit to True Master, who used it to produce \"Fish\" from Ghostface Killah's debut solo album Ironman as well as \"Brooklyn Zoo\" from Ol' Dirty Bastard's debut solo album Return to the 36 Chambers: The Dirty Version. Havoc of Mobb Deep has stated that he produced \"Shook Ones, Part II\" an EPS-16 Plus.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Jessie Stephens (born 1990) is an Australian writer, editor, novellist, television presenter and podcast host. She is an executive editor for Mamamia's flagship podcast Mamamia Out Loud and co-hosts the show with Mia Freedman and Holly Wainwright.\nStephens majored in Modern History and Gender Studies at the University of Sydney, and has a Master of Research.\nShe joined the staff of Mamamia as an editorial assistant in 2015.\nStephens has toured with her Mamamia Out Loud co-hosts as they present live shows in a similar format to the podcast to audiences around Australia. They toured in 2018 (Tamworth, Newcastle, Melbourne, Brisbane, Sydney, Dubbo), 2019 (Hobart, Brisbane, Perth, Darwin, Adelaide, Cairns, Orange, Geelong, Sydney), 2022 (Orange, Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne Sydney), and 2024 (Brisbane, Melbourne, Sydney).\nStephens is also a regular presenter on television current affairs and talk show The Project.\n\n\n== Books ==\nStephens is the author of two books published by Pan Australia: the non-fiction book Heartsick: Three Stories About Love And Loss, And What Happens In Between (2021) and a novel, Something Bad is Going to Happen (2023).\nHeartsick was received very favourably. It was voted #8 in Booktopia's Favourite Australian Book (FAB) award for 2021 and was included in the top 101 recommended books for 2022 by major Australian bookseller Dymocks. It was also shortlisted as general nonfiction book of the year at the Australian Book Industry Awards in 2022. It was published internationally by Pan Macmillan in the UK and by Henry Holt in the US. Reviewer Rebecca Wu in Glam Adelaide highlighted Stephens' \"wonderful skill of interweaving seemingly ordinary occasions of life in a way that tells a story without any drudgery. In fact, she makes it enticing.\" Although Emily Paull's review in The AU Review was generally unfavourable, she acknowledged that \"the ideas behind the book are strong, and that there is a need for more books which examine the not so happy endings in life, and don't hold romantic partnerships up to be the thing that completes us as humans.\"\nThe enthusiastic reception of the book in the US led Sue Smethurst in The Australian to call Stephens \"our [Australian literature's] next big thing\".\nSomething Bad is Going to Happen deals with themes of the mental health of its young protagonists. For this, it has been likened to \"a modern-day Bell Jar\", and Alexandra Hill in The Australian called it \"a very important new release.\"\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nStephens' identical twin sister, Clare Stephens, also works for Mamamia. In 2023, Jessie married Luca Lavigne, son of Mamamia founder Mia Freedman. The couple's first child, Luna, was born later that year.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Internet brainrot, also known simply as brainrot, is an Internet slang term used to describe either cringeworthy or nonsensical videos or memes heavily posted on Social media websites such as YouTube and TikTok. The term first started getting popularized in 2023 and 2024 with the main cause of the term \"brainrot\" being caused by the fictional meme syndrome Skibidi Toilet Syndrome. This \"syndrome\" was supposed to be appearing in young kids such as ones in Generation Alpha who would get hooked on the Skibidi Toilet YouTube web-series and supposedly act either more violent or stimulated when they could not watch it, or being too obsessed with the series in general and the act the characters in the series.\nSlang terms that would usually get called \"brainrot\" include:\nRizz: Having good charisma with other people.\nGyat: A big butt, popularized by Twitch (service) streamer Kai Cenat, who is also credited with being pioneer of \"brainrot\".\nFanum tax: The taking of other people's food as a \"tax\". This slang term was popularized by another Twitch streamer who is friends with Kai Cenat, Fanum (streamer).\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Holly Wainwright (born December 1971) is an Australian novellist, magazine editor, podcast host, and since 2014, an editor of the Mamamia website. \nShe was born in Manchester, UK. She came to Australia as a backpacker in 1995 and settled in Sydney. She lived in Coogee for about 20 years. \n\n\n== Career ==\nIn Sydney, she worked as a journalist and then editor for travel and celebrity magazines. Among other titles, she worked for Woman's Day.\nWainwright was Deputy Editor for OK! Magazine before joining Mamamia's parenting site iVillage Australia as Editor in 2013. The following year, she was appointed Editor of the main Mamamia site itself. She says that the motivation for her transition from print \"gossip magazines\" to digital (at a substantial pay cut) was driven by the traditional media becoming \"meaner. Especially about women, their relationships and their bodies.\" \nIn 2016, Mamamia split into two divisions — news and entertainment — with Wainwright appointed editor of the latter. By 2018, she was Head of Content and was co-hosting Mamamia's flagship podcast Mamamia Out Loud together with Mamamia founder Mia Freedman and Executive Editor Jessie Stephens.\nWainwright has toured with her Mamamia Out Loud co-hosts as they present live shows in a similar format to the podcast to audiences around Australia. They toured in 2018 (Tamworth, Newcastle, Melbourne, Brisbane, Sydney, Dubbo), 2019 (Hobart, Brisbane, Perth, Darwin, Adelaide, Cairns, Orange, Gelong, Sydney), 2022 (Orange, Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne Sydney), and 2024 (Brisbane, Melbourne, Sydney). Wainwright has described the live shows as \"absolutely one of the best professional experiences I’ve ever had.\"\n\n\n=== Novels ===\nFour of her novels have been published:\n\nThe Mummy Bloggers (Allen & Unwin, 2017)\nHow to be Perfect (Allen & Unwin, 2018)\nI Give My Marriage a Year (Pan Australia, 2020)\nThe Couple Upstairs (Pan Australia, 2022)\nMia Freedman compared the style of her first novel to that of Liane Moriarty and Zoë Foster Blake. \nAlicia Franceschini in Glam Adelaide wrote that although the book \"does sometimes fall into the trap of painting an almost caricature of women’s experiences of motherhood, it never fails to do so with a light-hearted nature and a tongue in cheek self awareness that is rarely seen in modern literature for women.\"\nWriting for the New Zealand Herald, reviewer Hannah Tunnicliffe praised I Give My Marriage a Year for its \"back-story, humour, psychological insight and explanations that deepen your interest and attachment\" to the characters depicted. Rosalind Moran, reviewing the same book for ArtsHub, concluded \"through investigating the personalities and relationships of her characters with a fine-tooth comb, Wainwright prompts the reader to consider their own life and relationships; how these might be fraying at the seams; and whether they might do better.\"\nThe Couple Upstairs was listed at #24 on Better Reading's list of the \"Top 100 Books of 2023\". Dee Young in Brisbanista described it as \"a novel that delves into the darker side of human nature, relationships, and where they lead. Is there a way of preventing another person from making similar mistakes to those made by oneself in the past? AND, is intervention an option or should one leave well alone?\" The Australian Women's Weekly called it \"an important read.\"\nWainwright's writer's festival appearances include:\n\nBurdekin Readers and Writers Festival 2018\nNorthern Beaches Readers Festival 2022\nBrisbane Writers Festival 2023\nCairns Tropical Writers Festival 2023\nStoryFest (Shoalhaven) 2023\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nWainwright has a partner and two children. In 2021, she and her family relocated to regional New South Wales, which she describes as a \"treechange\".\n\n\n== References ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Papelon (foaled 22 July 2006), also spelled Papelón, is a Chilean Thoroughbred racehorse best known for winning the Group 1 Clásico Club Hípico de Santiago Falabella four times. He was named a Chilean divisional champion for five years and was considered the 'King of Staying' in Chile during his career.\n\n\n== Background ==\nPapelon is a chestnut stallion with an off-center star and a small strip. Papelon was bred by Haras San Patricio.\nPapelon's sire, Monthir, was bred and raced in the United States. Monthir was thought to have promise for the Kentucky Derby as a two-year-old, but he failed to win any stakes races, although he did finish second in the Grade 3 Nashua Stakes and Grade 2 Hutcheson Stakes and third in the Grade 3 Bay Shore Stakes. Monthir was exported to Chile to stand at Haras San Patricio. Papelon was part of Monthir's second crop.\nPapelon's dam Encubierta was unraced and had produced two foals before Papelon, of which one was unraced and the other won twice. Encubierta is a full sister to Escania, Chilean Champion 2-Year-Old Dirt Filly and winner of the Group 1 Tanteo de Potrancas, and Eccellenza, Chilean Champion 2-Year-Old Dirt Filly and Champion 3-Year-Old Dirt Filly and winner of the Group 1 Tanteo de Potrancas and Group 1 Mil Guineas.\nPapelon was named after an anecdote from Dr. Ignacio Coloma's father.\nPapelon was owned by Stud Kekita and trained by Carlos Urbina during his racing career. He specialized in long distance turf races and heavy track conditions.\n\n\n== Racing career ==\n\n\n=== 2008/09: Two-year-old season ===\nPapelon ran five times in 2009 as a two-year-old, all in maiden races at Hipódromo Chile on the dirt. He lost all five races, although he did finish third twice and second once.\n\n\n=== 2009/10: Three-year-old season ===\nPapelon broke his maiden on his seventh try, in his second race as a three-year-old, on July 30, 2009. He won the 1200-meter race at Hipódromo Chile by five and a half lengths. Papelon's connections then pointed him towards stakes races, starting with the Group 2 Clásico Domingo Segundo Herrera Martínez on August 15, run over 1500 meters on the dirt at Hipódromo Chile. Papelon finished fourth, but ran credibly enough that he was next entered in the Group 1 Dos Mil Guineas, a 1600-meter dirt race at Hipódromo Chile. In the Dos Mil Guineas, Papelon performed poorly, finishing second to last in the fourteen horse field, seventeen lengths behind the winner.\nWithin the month, Papelon raced again, in his first race at a new track, finishing second in the 1700-meter Clásico Criadores F. S. de Carreras S. A., an ungraded stakes race run at Valparaiso Sporting Club. He next ran at the third of Chile's major racetracks, and the track where he would eventually mark his greatest victories: Club Hípico de Santiago. The race, the listed stakes Clásico Preparación Luis Cousiño S., was also his first time running clockwise, on the turf, and at a distance of 2000 meters. Papelon won the race by a head, and was next pointed to the Group 1 Clásico El Ensayo, one of the most important races on the Chilean calendar and first race of the Chilean Triple Crown. In the Clásico El Ensayo, Papelon ran fourth behind Belle Watling, who would go on to be the Chilean Horse of the Year for that season. Papelon faced Belle Watling again in his last race of 2009, the Group 2 Gran Clásico Coronación, finished second to her by two and a quarter lengths.\nIn January 2010, Papelon ran in the Group 1 Clásico El Derby at Valparaiso Sporting Club and finished sixth. He remained at Valparaiso Sporting Club through March and achieved his first graded stakes victories there, winning the Group 3 Clásico Thompson Matthews and Group 2 Clásico Municipal de Viña del Mar, with the latter being his first race against older horses.\nPapelon then returned to Club Hípico de Santiago for the Group 1 Clásico Club Hípico de Santiago Falabella, the most important race in Chile for turf stayers. He was one of three three-year-olds in the race. Papelon won the 2000-meter race by one and a quarter lengths in a time of 1:56.00. With the win, Papelon earned an entry into the Group 1 Gran Premio Latinoamericano, run at Club Hípico de Santiago that year, also over 2000 meters on the turf. The Gran Premio Latinoamericano had originally been slated to be run in March 2010, but was postponed to September due to an earthquake. \nIn total, Papelon won five of twelve starts and was named the Chilean Champion Three-Year-Old Turf Male for his campaign.\n\n\n=== 2010/11: Four-year-old season ===\nPapelon's first race as a four-year-old was the ungraded stakes Clásico Estados Unidos de América on July 16, run over 1700 meters on the turf at Club Hípico de Santiago. He won, and headed towards the Gran Premio Latinoamericano on a four-race long win streak, all in stakes races. Papelon finished fourth in the Gran Premio Latinoamericano behind Belle Watling, but acquitted himself well in what was later called \"one of the most emotional finishes of the Latinos\" by El Turf.\nIn October 2010, Papelon won the first of an eventual three Group 3 Clásicos Primavera Hernan Braun P. y Carolina Budge de B., and he finished third in the Group 3 Clásico La Copa to finish out 2010. Papelon won the Group 3 Clásico Verano Arturo Cousiño L. in February 2011 before heading outside Chile for the first time to run in the 2011 Gran Premio Latinoamericano, run over 2000 meters on the turf at Hipódromo de San Isidro that year. In the race, he closed late and failed to make up enough ground, finishing fifth.\nPapelon returned to Chile to run in his second Clásico Club Hípico de Santiago Falabella in May 2011, his final race as a four-year-old. Despite starting as the favorite, he failed to repeat his previous performance, finishing third behind the three-year-old Sin Respeto.\nIn total, Papelon won three of seven starts as a four-year-old and was named the Chilean Champion Older Horse for his campaign.\n\n\n=== 2011/12: Five-year-old season ===\nPapelon didn't return to the racetrack until December 2011, when he won the ungraded stakes Clásico Mega at Club Hípico de Santiago. He next raced in March 2012, taking the Group 2 Clásico Municipal de Viña del Mar, before finishing third in the Group 3 Clásico Otoño Pedro Garcia de la Huerta M. in April.\nIn late May, Papelon ran in the Clásico Club Hípico de Santiago Falabella for the third time. The turf track was heavy, a condition that Papelon favored, and he won by five lengths, becoming the first horse since 1989 to \nHe raced once more as a five-year-old, finishing second in the Group 3 Clásico Invierno Sergio del Sante M. as the favorite.\nIn total, Papelon won three of five starts as a five-year-old, including the Group 2 Clásico Municipal de Viña del Mar and his second Clásico Club Hípico de Santiago Falabella, and was named the Chilean Champion Grass Horse for his campaign.\n\n\n=== 2012/13: Six-year-old season ===\nIn his first start as a six-year-old, Papelon again won the Clásico Estados Unidos de América before finishing fourth in the Group 2 Clásico Copa de Oro. He won his next two starts, the Group 3 Clásico Primavera Hernan Braun P. y Carolina Budge de B. and the ungraded Clásico Raúl Ovalle U., then ran second in the ungraded Clásico Torbita and Group 2 Clásico Verano Arturo Cousiño L. He added a win in the listed Clásico Luis Aldunate C. and a third in the Group 2 Clásico Copa de Oro Viñas de Chile, all run at Club Hípico de Santiago, before heading to Hipódromo Chile for the Group 1 Gran Premio Hipódromo Chile, in which he finished fourth.\nIn May, Papelon achieved the unprecedented feat of winning a third Clásico Club Hípico de Santiago Falabella when he won the race by four and a half lengths. He closed out his six-year-old season with a win in the Group 2 Clásico Otoño Pedro Garcia de la Huerta M.\nIn total, Papelon won six of eleven starts as a six-year-old, including the Group 3 Clásico Primavera Hernan Braun P. y Carolina Budge de B., Group 2 Clásico Otoño Pedro Garcia de la Huerta M., and his third Clásico Club Hípico de Santiago Falabella, with the year being regarded as his best. He was named the Chilean Champion Older Horse for his campaign.\n\n\n=== 2013/14: Seven-year-old season ===\nPapelon won the Group 3 Clásico Invierno Sergio del Sante M. in his first race as a seven-year-old in July 2013 before heading to Hipódromo Chile, where he ran third in the Group 3 Clásico Libertador Bernardo O'Higgens Riquelme. Returning to Club Hípico de Santiago, he won the listed Clásico Carreras del '20 and his third Clásico Primavera Hernan Braun P. y Carolina Budge de B., finished second in the Group 3 Clásico La Copa and Group 2 Clásico Verano Arturo Cousiño L., and third in the ungraded Clásico Tobrita.\nPapelon attempted the Gran Premio Hipódromo Chile again in 2014, again finishing fourth, before running in the Clásico Club Hípico de Santiago Falabella for the fifth time and winning it for the fourth.\nFollowing the win, Papelon went to Hipódromo Chile to train, but suffered a significant injury that forced his retirement from racing. According to Dr. Ignacio Coloma of Haras San Patricio, the injury was severe enough to kill most horses.\nIn total, Papelon won four of nine starts as a seven-year-old, including the Group 3 Clásico Invierno Sergio del Sante M., Group 3 Clásico Primavera Hernan Braun P. y Carolina Budge de B., and his fourth Clásico Club Hípico de Santiago Falabella. He was named the Chilean Champion Older Turf Horse for his campaign.\nPapelon retired with earnings of CLP$269,836,129, a record of 21 wins in 49 starts, including four editions of the Group 1 Clásico Club Hípico de Santiago Falabella and five Group 3 and four Group 2 wins, and five Chilean divisional championships.\n\n\n== Race record ==\n\nAn asterisk after the odds means Papelon was the post time favorite.\n\n\n== Stud career ==\nAfter retiring from racing, Papelon entered stud at Haras San Patricio where he was bred. He has had limited success at stud, with his most successful progeny being the Group 3-placed colt El Mañio.\n\n\n== Pedigree ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nRepeat winners of horse races\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Susan Blanchard Elder (April 19, 1835 – November 3, 1923) was an American writer known for her contributions to literature, particularly focusing on themes of family, religion, and the American South. She was born in Fort Jessup, Sabine Parish, Louisiana, to Albert Gallatin Blanchard, a military officer, and Susan Thompson. Despite her father's military obligations, which often took him away from home, Susan spent her formative years in both the North and South.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life and education ===\nElder was born on April 19, 1835, in Fort Jessup, Sabine Parish, Louisiana, to Albert Gallatin Blanchard, a military officer in both the U.S. and Confederate armies, and Susan Thompson. Following her mother's death during her childhood and her father's military duties, she spent several of her formative years living with relatives in the North. She later returned to Louisiana as a teenager and received education at the Girls' High School of New Orleans and St. Michael's Convent of the Sacred Heart in St. James Parish.\n\n\n=== Marriage and career ===\nDuring her adolescence, using the pen name \"Hermine,\" Elder began publishing poems, essays, and stories in local newspapers. Notable examples from this period include the poems \"Babies\" and \"First Ride.\" In 1855, she converted to Catholicism and married Charles D. Elder, brother of William H. Elder, the Archbishop of Cincinnati. The couple relocated to Selma, Alabama, during the Civil War, where they established their home as a Confederate hospital. After the war, they returned to New Orleans, where Elder pursued a career in education, teaching math and natural science at various institutions.\n\n\n=== Literary contributions ===\nElder's literary career flourished post-war, with her writings published in several Roman Catholic periodicals. She served on the editorial staff of the Morning Star from 1882 to 1890, contributing extensively to Catholic publications. Her works encompassed a range of genres, with a particular emphasis on historical novels. Notable publications include James the Second (1874) and The Leos of the Papacy (1879).\n\n\n=== Legacy and later years ===\nSusan Blanchard Elder's notable literary contributions include The Life of Abbé Adrien Rouquette (1913), a biographical study of the poet-priest and missionary to the Louisiana Choctaw Native Americans. Her novel Ellen Fitzgerald (1876) and patriotic work A Mosaic of Blue and Gray (1914) reflect her interest in Southern themes.\nIn her later years, Elder resided in Cincinnati with her daughter until her death on November 3, 1923.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nPierce, Jacklyn R.

        "content": "Outram Prison, also known as Pearl's Hill Prison or Civil Jail, was a prison at Pearl's Hill, Outram, Singapore. Originally occupied by the Civil Jail, Outram Prison was opened in 1882 and served as the main prison complex before the construction of Changi Prison in 1936.\nIt was demolished in 1963 and replaced by Housing and Development Board (HDB) blocks and a shopping complex.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Civil Jail ===\n\nIn 1847, Charles Edward Faber built the Civil Jail, also known as Her Majesty's Gaol, at the present site at Pearl's Hill, Outram. Two time capsules were buried at the base of the foundation, containing parchment with revenue figures and different types of currency.\nIn 1872, a Commission of Inquiry into the prison system suggested that current prison regimes had 'lost sight of the punitive aspect of prison life'. After the riot at Bras Basah Jail, a plan to build an extension that would be more secure was considered at either Bras Basah Jail or the Civil Jail; they later decided to build the extension at Civil Jail.\n\n\n=== Outram Prison ===\n\nWhen Outram Prison was built between 1879 and 1882 at the Civil Jail site by J. F. A. McNair, they adopted a more cellular concept that included stricter control of the prison perimeter. Outram Prison was also built using convict labour from Bras Basah Jail.\n\nAfter the 1915 Singapore Mutiny, 47 sepoys were publicly executed by firing squad at Outram Prison while others were sentenced to imprisonment for up to 20 years. The executions were witnessed by an estimated 15,000 people.\nIn the 1930s, Outram Prison suffered from overcrowding and was considered a hazard. The prison was designed to hold up to 1,080 prisoners but, in the 1920s, gained an average daily number of convicts of 1,043 and had reached up to 1,311 by 1931. This led to plans for a new prison to be built at Changi.\nAfter the construction of Changi Prison, Outram Prison was used to hold convicts serving short sentences whilst Changi Prison was used for longer sentences.\n\nDuring the Japanese occupation of Singapore, Outram Prison was known as Outram Road Gaol and was controlled by the Japanese and used to hold prisoners of war. 1,470 prisoners died of starvation, torture, and diseases while only 400 survived by 1945. As a result, 44 Japanese officers were convicted of war crimes committed at Outram Prison with 3 generals executed. The prison was handed back to the British following the end of the occupation.\nIn 1952, a new block for female convicts was made, replacing the block for European convicts. In 1954, a new block for remanding convicts was made. In 1956, a centre for reforming youths was opened at Outram Prison, replacing the remanding block.\n\n\n=== Demolition ===\nIn 1963, then-Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew announced plans to demolish Outram Prison and replace it with a Housing and Development Board (HDB) estate. Convicts from Outram Prison were transferred to Changi Prison and Bedok Reformation Centre.\nOutram Prison was replaced by Queenstown Remand Prison in 1966, which cost S$2 million to build. In 1966, works began to build 1,000 housing units and 400 shops. In 1970, public housing and a shopping complex called Outram Park Complex were built.\n\n\n== See also ==\nChangi Prison\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Nicole Sahin is an American entrepreneur, philanthropist and author best known as the CEO and founder of G-P (Globalization Partners), the first global SaaS-based employer of record (EOR) platform. In 2022, the company received a $4.2 billion valuation after a $200 million investment from Vista Equity Partners.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nRaised in St. Louis, Missouri, Sahin had originally intended to become an anthropologist after studying humanities and environmental studies. In 2001, she undertook an extended period of fieldwork in the remote village of Todos Santos in the northern highlands of Guatemala. Sahin was learning the ancient Mayan language of Mam while progressing the work of Maude Oakes, one of the first female ethnologists, who lived and worked in Todos Santos in the 1950s to record the shamanic traditions of its Mayan indigenous group.\nAfter returning to the United States, however, Sahin decided to pursue a career in international business. She has said that she believes it is possible to run a business that is both ethical and profitable.\nIn 2003, Sahin moved to California to secure an MBA in International Management at Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. She later relcoated to Boston where she founded G-P.\n\n\n= Career =\n\n\n=== Early career ===\nIn 2005, Sahin joined the newly founded High Street Partners (HSP), a software-enabled international business services firm which facilitated the international expansion of fast-growing tech companies including Tesla and HID Global by setting up subsidiaries around the globe on their behalf, and then managing the payroll, HR, tax, and accounting issues for each of those subsidiaries. In 2014, HSP merged with Nair & Co in 2014 to form Radius Worldwide, which was then acquired by Vistra International Expansion in 2018. During her six-year tenure at High Street Partners, Sahin held various roles including Senior Director of Sales and managing director (West Coast and Southwest Regions).\n\n\n=== Globalization Partners (G-P) ===\nIn 2011, Sahin left High Street Partners to focus on developing the Employer of Record (EOR) business model to accelerate international corporate expansion.\nIn 2012, Sahin founded Globalization Partners (G-P), the first global, SaaS-based EOR platform in the world. G-P provides the legal infrastructure for companies to hire employees in new countries without having to set up their own branch offices and subsidiaries, enabling them to bypass the bureaucracy and expense of setting up subsidiaries around the globe. As of May 2024, G-P has established companies in more than 180 countries to facilitate global hiring on behalf of its customers.\nIn June 2023, Sahin announced that G-P would be expanding its offerings beyond the traditional EOR platform it created by aggregating a decade of learnings and technological developments into a suite of customizable tools known as the G-P Meridien Suite.  This suite of tools is designed to help companies through all elements of their international expansion and is foundational to their emerging category of technology known as Global Growth TechnologyTM, a series of SaaS-based products that simplify and automate global HR, legal, and tax issues using AI and machine learning and proprietary data.\n\n\n=== Other endeavors ===\nIn 2023, the World Economic Forum invited Sahin to join its Global Innovators Community. She has spoken at Davos and other World Economic Forum events alongside renowned thought leaders and policy makers including economist Ian Bremmer and UN Deputy High Commissioner for Refugees, Kelly Clements.\nIn June 2023, Sahin and G-P co-founded the EOR industry watchdog, The Global Employment Innovation Organization (GEIO).\n\n\n== Boards and memberships ==\nSahin serves on the board of School the World, a nonprofit organization which builds educational infrastructure for rural communities in Latin America.\nIn 2023, Sahin was invited to join the Philanthropy Circle of the Nobel Women's Initiative.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\n2016 — Fortune named Sahin one of the World's Most Powerful Women\n2017 — Ernst & Young honored Sahin as Entrepreneur of The Year® (New England)\n2020 — Inc. magazine included Sahin in its Founders 100 list\n2022 — Inc. magazine named Sahin a Top 100 Female Founder\n2022 — Fast Company honored Sahin's blueprint for the EOR industry as one of its World Changing Ideas\n2024 — Sahin named by PitchBook as one of their 102 Female Founders and Investors to Know in 2024\n\n\n== Philanthropy ==\nIn 2011, Sahin co-founded Sweet Life School for Girls in Cambodia, a project to establish a school in rural Cambodia that provides elementary education to more than 600 students.\nSince 2019, Sahin has been a board member of School the World, an international nonprofit solving extreme poverty through education.\nSahin is a member of the Philanthropy Circle of the Nobel Women's Initiative.\n\n\n== Book ==\nIn December 2021, Sahin's book, Global Talent Unleashed, became a Wall Street Journal Bestseller. Published by ACompass Printing Press in May 2021, the book is a guide for executives on how to leverage global talent by building remote teams.\n\n\n== Documentary ==\nSahin is an executive co-producer of the documentary Of Night and Light which premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2023. The long-format documentary relates ibogaine’s history in North America as a successful but under-recognized one-off treatment for severe depression, PTSD, and drug and alcohol addiction.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Prosper of Reggio Emilia (died 1332/1333) was an Augustinian hermit and scholar.\nProsper was born in the 1270s. He was sent by his order to study theology at the University of Paris. He served the order as a lector at Milan before returning to Paris to complete his studies. He became a Master of Theology in March 1316. In 1318, he was appointed examiner of the Augustinian schools in Italy. By 1321, he was the regent of the Augustinian studium generale in Bologna, where he taught until his death in 1332 or 1333.\nProsper's notebook survives in the Vatican Library, where it has been bound together with his extensive but incomplete commentary on the Sentences as Vat. lat. 1086. Marginal notes were added later in the 14th century. A citation of his commentary is also found in Thomas of Strasbourg's commentary. His notebook contains reports (reportationes) of various quodlibeta, including his own.\nLike Durand of Saint-Pourçain, Prosper attacked the then reigning theory of cognitive habits. Rather than see such habits as entities in the intellect, he views them as products of the \"imaginative\" or \"ostensive\" power of the soul to \"show\" things to the intellect.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVat. lat. 1086",

In December 2023, he expelled a problematic student from the school. On 7 May 2024 at 10:00 in the morning, the student returned to the school unexpectedly, and upon seeing Oktugan doing his daily duties, he took out a pistol from his waistband and shot Oktugan five times, leaving him in critical condition. The shooter immediately fled the scene. Students and teachers panicked until police and ambulance came. The shooter was later arrested and confirmed to be 16-year-old Yusuf K, from Iraq, who received Turkish citizenship with his family. Although extensive measures were taken to save Oktugan, he died on the same day at 74 years old.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Richard Heyn (1933 – 3 April 2024) was a former Sri cricketer and field hockey player who also represented Sri Lanka men's national field hockey team playing as a right full back. His younger brother David Heyn also played cricket at club level representing Burgher Recreation Club. His father Bertram Heyn was a former Sri Lankan Army general who also holds a special feat of having dismissed legendary Australian cricketer Don Bradman in a first-class match in Sri Lankan soil.\n\n\n== Career ==\nHe plied his trade in cricket and field hockey at his younger age. He went onto captain St. Peter's College cricket and field hockey teams. During his playing career as a cricketer, he was an automatic choice for Burgher Recreation Club during the 1960s. He also played a vital part in Burgher Recreation Club's triumph at the 1967 Domestic season as he pioneered the club leading from the front as a standout captain.\nHe represented the Mercantile Hockey Association at the National Championships from 1965 to 1967. He was also a key member of the Sri Lankan hockey team as part of the Sri Lankan contingent which took part at the 1962 Asian Games. He was named in Sri Lanka field hockey squad for a three match test series against a strong Indian side in 1967. During the first test of the three test series, Sri Lanka lost by a margin of 1-0 which is still regarded as the best ever performance by Ceylonese hockey side against India.\nFollowing his retirement from sporting career, he pursued his career in commercial sector until 1968. He then migrated to Australia and began fulfilling his career ambitions by taking up key managerial positions. He later moved to the United States and was living in Virginia until his death. \n\n\n== Death ==\nHe died on 3 April 2024 in Virginia, United States, at the age of 81 due to age-related ailments. \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Shu-ou Shan is a Chinese American biologist who is a professor at the California Institute of Technology. Her research combines mechanistic enzymology with biophysical characterization techniques (e.g. cryo EM and fluorescence spectroscopy) to understand biogenesis pathways. She was awarded the 2024 National Academy of Sciences Award in Molecular Biology.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nShan was born and raised in Shanghai. She moved to the United States after high school, and studied chemistry at the University of Maryland, College Park. She was a doctoral researcher at Stanford University, where she worked alongside Daniel Herschlag on RNA catalysis. She was first introduced to mechanistic enzymology there. She moved to University of California, San Francisco as a postdoctoral researcher, where she worked with Peter Walter on cell biology.\n\n\n== Research and career ==\nIn 2005, Shan joined the faculty at California Institute of Technology. Her science is driven by questions about how cells control biological processes and the molecular principles that underpin biological recognition and mechanisms that define protein delivery.\nShan looks to understand the molecular mechanisms of co-translational protein machineries; including folding, assembly, targeting and biogenesis. Co-translational describes processes that occur at the same time as translation during protein synthesis. Using an array of biophysical characterization techniques, Shan looks to build a model that can predict what happens to nascent proteins as they emerge from the ribosome and their environment impacts these processes.\nShan studies molecular chaperones (proteins that assist in the folding or unfolding process) and how they protect proteins from mis-folding, sometimes even repairing mis-folding or aggregation.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n2007 David and Lucile Packard Foundation Fellow\n2007 Arnold and Mabel Beckman Fellow\n2011 Protein Society Irving Sigal Young Investigator Award\n2013 American Chemical Society Nobel Laureate Signature Award for Graduate Education in Chemistry\n2013 American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Young Investigator Award\n2020 Caltech Altair Professor of Chemistry\n2024 National Academy of Sciences Award in Molecular Biology\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\nDavid Akopian; Kuang Shen; Xin Zhang; Shu-ou Shan (13 February 2013). \"Signal recognition particle: an essential protein-targeting machine\".

Wade, the New York Senate passed the resolution in favor of the amendment by a vote of 49–14, then the New York Assembly also adopted it by a vote of 98–43.\nOn January 24, 2023, the New York Senate passed it by a vote of 43-20 and the New York Assembly passed it by a vote of 97–46, therefore allowed the referendum to take place.\n\n\n== Legal challenges ==\nOn May 7, 2024, Livingston County Supreme Court justice Daniel J. Doyle ruled that the referendum cannot take place since the New York Attorney General issued an opinion of the proposed amendment after lawmakers voted on it, rather than before.\nNew York Governor Kathy Hochul stated that referendum will still take place in November 2024.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNew Yorkers for Equal Rights - the coalition supporting the amendment",

        "content": "Saturn Electrostatic Discharges (also referred to as SEDs) are atmospheric lightning events in convective weather storms on Saturn that produce high frequency (HF) radio emissions (1-40 MHz). Terrestrial lighting events on Earth, in comparison, occur in the very low frequency (VLF) radio band, between 3 Hz and 30 kHz. This makes SED signals at least 10,000 times stronger. While first discovered by NASA's Voyager 1 mission, the scientific community has gained further understanding through the following Voyager 2 and Cassini missions in conjunction with ground-based observation and data gathering methods.\n\n\n== Voyager ==\nSaturn Electrostatic discharges were first recorded by the Voyager 1 mission as it passed near Saturn in November 1980. The term was subsequently coined by Warwick et al. in April 1981 in the Journal Planetary Radio Astronomy Observations from Voyager 1 Near Saturn. It was initially uncertain whether these SEDs were associated with storms in the planet's atmosphere or if they were originating in its rings. Evans et al. hypothesized that they originated from a satellite located within Saturn's B Ring, which was also the proposed reason for a narrow feature also found. This was disputed in 1983 by Kaiser et al., who argued that the occultation caused by the planet lasted too long for SEDs to originate in the rings.\n\n\n== Cassini ==\nWhen the Cassini mission reached Saturn in 2004, SEDs and optical storm observations were finally directly linked. This occurred when Cassini ISS imaged the Dragon Storm, which was located by the SEDs it produced and then optically verified. It and other white storm clouds were found to be brighter in conjunction with higher rates of SEDs. The Dragon Storm can range over 2,000 miles and is located at a planetocentric latitude of 35° south. This planet region is called \"storm alley\" as all storm activity on Saturn was concentrated here in a 1.5° band from 2002 to 2010.\nDuring the Cassini mission, it was also discovered that SEDs could be detected over the horizon. This phenomenon, known as over-the-horizon events, was made possible by the previously mentioned combination of radio and optical observations. It is theorized that this occurs when SED radio waves are temporarily trapped under Saturn's ionosphere.\n\n\n== Ground Based Observations ==\nThe first reliable ground-based detections of SEDs occurred in Ukraine in January/February 2006. At this time, SED storm E lasted approximately one month. The ground team used the UTR-2 radio telescope, and the data was combined with real-time information from Cassini. These efforts were made easier by the high intensity of the SEDs occurring during the month-long SED storm E. The process was repeated in November 2007 during the eight-month-long storm F and produced a high degree of coincidence between the UTR-2 and Cassini.\nAt this same time as storm E, amateur astronomers became engaged in observing Saturn's storms. Storm E, observed by Cassini, was the first long-lasting SED storm while Saturn was distant from solar conjunction, making it high in the sky for ground-based observers. In the images captured by amateurs, the SED storms proved easily detectable, manifesting as bright white spots.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Goodenia perfoliata is a species of flowering plant in the family Goodeniaceae and is endemic to a small area of New South Wales. It is a mostly glabrous, perennial herb with erect flowering stems, lance-shaped leaves with sometimes deeply-toothed edges, and yellow flowers with bracteoles joined to form a disc-like funnel.\n\n\n== Description ==\nGoodenia perfoliata is a glabrous, perennial herb with erect or ascending flowering stems up to 50 cm (20 in) long. Its leaves are elliptic to lance-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, 100–250 mm (3.9–9.8 in) long and 25–60 mm (0.98–2.36 in) wide, sometimes with deeply-toothed edges. The flowers are borne on the flowering stem with bracteoles fused to each other, forming a disc-like funnel up to 80 mm (3.1 in) in diameter. The lower sepal is broadly elliptic, up to 8 mm (0.31 in) long, and the petals are yellow, 10–12 mm (0.39–0.47 in) long and hairy mostly only on the outside, with wings about 2 mm (0.079 in) wide, almost to the base of the lower sepal. Flowering mainly occurs in spring, and the fruit is a more or less spherical capsule about 4 mm (0.16 in) in diameter, containing a seed about 3 mm (0.12 in) in diameter with a narrow wing.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThis species was first formally described in 1810 by Robert Brown who gave it the name Velleia perfoliata in his Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. In 2020, Kelly Anne Shepherd and others transferred it to the genus Goodenia as G. perfoliata in Australian Systematic Botany.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nGoodenia perfoliata grows in open forest from near Wisemans Ferry and the Colo River to the upper Hunter Valley, in New South Wales.\n\n\n== Conservation status ==\nThis species is listed as \"vulnerable\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and the New South Wales Government Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Adidas All-Canadian Basketball Game was an annual all-star game sponsored by Adidas that featured the top Canadian high school basketball prospects. The first annual event was held in May 2004 at the Hershey Centre in Missisauga. \nThe top 50 Canadian senior-level high school basketball players were nominated for the event. The initial list was gathered by the Canadian Sports and Media Group and experts from across the country, including college, university and high school coaches, media members, provincial sports organizations and general high school basketball experts. In addition, every major basketball publication in Canada was reviewed. The top 20 players were selected as finalists to play in the national high school all-star basketball game. The selection committee also determined the game's final lineups after they narrowed the top 50 list to twenty names.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1st Annual Adidas All-Canadian ===\nThe first Adidas All-Canadian game was played on May 8, 2004, at the Hershey Centre in Missisauga. The game aired live on cable sports channel The Score and it was the first-ever nationally televised game featuring the top rising high school talent across Canada. Players had the opportunity to compete in front of approximately 5,000 fans, along with scouts from top Canadian and American universities. The event featured a three-point shootout, a slam dunk competition, and an all-star game.\nOakville's Ivan Chiriaev  was named the game's most valuable player as the leading scorer with a game-high of 17 points.\n\n\n=== 2nd Annual Adidas All-Canadian ===\nThe second annual Adidas-sponsored event was televised on TSN in April 2005 and took place at the Hershey Centre in Mississauga.\n\n\n=== 3rd Annual Adidas All-Canadian ===\nThe organizers of the third annual Adidas All-Canadian event selected East and West teams from a list of the top 100 high school players across Canada. In March 2006, the Adidas All-Canadian Game East Vs. West took place at the Cathedral High School in Hamilton. Over 2,100 basketball fans packed the venue to witness the East beat the 10-player West squad 96–83.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Kevin Jousset (born 2 May 1993) is a French professional mixed martial artist, currently competing in the Welterweight division in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). A professional competitor since 2019, Jousset formerly competed for the Hex Fight Series in Australia, where he has been the first simultaneous double Welterweight and Middleweight Champion.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nKevin Jousset was born on (1993-05-02)2 May 1993 in Bordeaux, France and then quickly moved with his family to Gap where he grew up. Jousset started judo as a child and received his 2nd dan black belt at the age of 14. He pursued his judo career along with other French prospects at the Rennes Academy and Bordeaux France Academy before moving to Paris and joining INEF and INSEP.\nUnfortunately, he had to stop his career after a serious shoulder injury and chose to spend one year and a half in Scotland for learning English at the age of 21. Two years later, he moved to Melbourne, Australia in November 2016 where he got a fitness coach diploma and started mixed martial arts.\n\n\n== Mixed martial arts career ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nJousset quickly joined Absolute MMA in Melbourne where he met Alexander Volkanovski and elite grappler Craig Jones. He stayed there for four years and prepared his first fights with the team. After a few amateur wins, he made his professional debut in March 2019 at Hex Fight Series 18 and went on to win the bout via knockout with a knee strike in the first round. For his third professional fight, he lost against Jack Della Maddalena on 4 October at Eternal MMA 48 for the EMMA Welterweight Championship after a doctor stoppage at the end of round 2. He then settled down in Auckland, New Zealand in January 2020 and joined City Kickboxing where he made a training camp the previous year.\nIn 2023, he became the first fighter ever to become a two-division champion in the Australian elite MMA promotion HEX Fight Series after winning the HEX Vacant Middleweight Belt in February and then the HEX Welterweight Belt in May.\n\n\n=== Ultimate Fighting Championship ===\nIn August 2023, Jousset signed with the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) after becoming the first HEX double champion. His City Kickboxing teammate and friend Israel Adesanya as well as his coach Eugene Bareman recommended to the UFC staff to sign him after Jousset's progress and dominance in training. On 10 September 2023, he made his promotional debut against Irish fighter Kiefer Crosbie at UFC 293 in Sydney, Australia and won by submitting him with a rear-naked choke at the end of round one. Following his fast win, he called out fellow UFC Welterweight Ian Machado Garry in an attempt to continue the theme of defeating Irish fighters.\nHe faced Song Kenan on 9 December at UFC Fight Night 233. He won the fight via unanimous decision with all three judges scoring 30–27 for the Frenchman. For his third bout in the UFC, he was scheduled to face Jared Gooden on 11 May 2024 at UFC on ESPN 56. However, due to medical reasons, Gooden was unable to compete and the bout was cancelled.\n\n\n== Championships and accomplishments ==\n\n\n=== Mixed martial arts ===\nHex Fight Series\nFirst ever HEX double champion\nHEX Welterweight Championship (One time)\nHEX Middleweight Championship (One time)\n\n\n== Mixed martial arts record ==\n\n\n=== Amateur record ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of current UFC fighters\nList of male mixed martial artists\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKevin Jousset at Tapology.com\nKevin Jousset at UFC",

Male and female flowers are borne in leaf axils on separate plants, male flowers in clusters of 7–9, 20–30 mm (0.79–1.18 in) long, the individual flowers 4–5 mm (0.16–0.20 in) in diameter on a pedicel about 8 mm (0.31 in) long, with about 30 stamens. Female flowers are borne in clusters of 7–9, 30–50 mm (1.2–2.0 in) long, the individual flowers 5–7 mm (0.20–0.28 in) in diameter on a pedicel about 10–15 mm (0.39–0.59 in) long, with about 35 carpels. Flowering occurs from July to December and the fruit is a glossy, olive-black drupe, 15–22 mm (0.59–0.87 in) long and 10–15 mm (0.39–0.59 in) wide, with an orange fruiting receptacle 10–15 mm (0.39–0.59 in) in diameter.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nWilkiea austroqueenslandica was first formally described in 1926 by Karel Domin in Bibliotheca Botanica, from specimens collected on Tamborine Mountain.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nThis species of Wilkiea grows in rainforest at altitudes up to 850 m (2,790 ft) from the McPherson Range in south-east Queensland to the Richmond and Tweed Rivers in north-eastern New South Wales.\n\n\n== References ==",
